    "summary": "<p>On March 24, 2020, the ACLU of Massachusetts, along with the Committee for Public Counsel Services and the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, filed this emergency petition asking the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts to take immediate action to limit the outbreak of COVID-19 in Massachusetts correctional facilities. Specifically, the petitioners asked that the Court exercise its superintendence powers under state law to: 1) reduce the volume of those entering Massachusetts correctional facilities by requiring trial courts to weigh the threat of COVID-19 when analyzing the need for pretrial detention; 2) order release of those held pretrial who do not pose a public safety risk; and 3) deem served the sentences of those who are vulnerable to COVID-19, near the end of their sentence, eligible for parole, or who do not pose a threat to the public. The petitioners named the Chief Justice of the Trial Court as respondent.</p>\r\n<p>The petitioners argued that the exercise of the Court&rsquo;s supervisory powers was &ldquo;necessary to protect substantive rights.&rdquo; They claimed that subjecting non-dangerous prisoners to a likely outbreak of COVID-19 violated the Eighth Amendment and Massachusetts prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. In addition, they claimed that continuing detention during the COVID-19 pandemic did not comport with substantive and procedural due process as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment and the analogous state provision.</p>\r\n<p>Just prior to the filing of the petition, three incarcerated individuals and one officer received positive COVID-19 diagnoses in Massachusetts. In response to this pandemic, the Supreme Judicial Court had already closed courthouses, canceled trials, and ordered hearings by videoconference.</p>\r\n<p>On March 25, the Court ordered that the petitioners add the following parties as respondents: the Department of Correction; each county Sheriff; each District Attorney; the Parole Board; and the Attorney General.</p>\r\n<p>On March 25, the Middlesex District Attorney filed a response to the petitioner&rsquo;s request for relief. The party expressed concern for unconditional release and advocated for the court to immediately convene an emergency committee involving various stakeholders. On March 27, the Berkshire District Attorney also filed a response brief, opposing a potential decarceration order from the Supreme Judicial Court but supporting the appointment of the Special Master.</p>\r\n<p>On the same day, the Bristol District Attorney responded and requested that the court dismiss petitioners claim. Similarly, sheriffs of 14 counties requested that the court deny the petition, arguing that continuing detention did not violate the Eighth Amendment or analogous state provisions, the petitioners failed to exhaust administrative remedies, and the remedy would pose potential harm to public safety. In contrast, the Suffolk District Attorney&rsquo;s March 27 response brief expressed support for the relief sought by the petitioners. On March 28, the Attorney General filed a brief requesting that the court adheres to certain principles in fashioning relief.</p>\r\n<p>On March 25, the Court had appointed a Special Master to explore a possible negotiated settlement and make recommendations to the court. The Special Master submitted a Report and Recommendations to the court on March 30. For pretrial proceedings, it recommended factoring age and health in detention decisions and suspending existing warrants for non-violent probation violations, failures to appear, and alleged commission of new offenses excluding certain felonies and violent offenses. It included a review process for considering the release of certain prisoners and a reporting provision for prisons and jails. The Attorney General, and the District Attorneys of Berkshire County, the Northwest Counties, Middlesex County and Suffolk County supported the Report. The petitioners supported the framework, the timelines, and the individualized review recommendations, but objected to the definition of certain excluded offenses. The petitioners also filed a reply brief on March 30, advocating for immediate of an order that allows for rapid and individualized incarceration reduction.</p>\r\n<p>Prisoners&rsquo; Legal Services moved to intervene on March 30. As Massachusetts&rsquo;s sole provider of civil legal services to those in prison, the organization argued that its expertise and knowledge were necessary to develop a solution that incorporates its clients&rsquo; voices. PLS sought additional relief including: (1) release of all individuals civilly committed to a correctional facility under state law provisions, whether held at the Massachusetts Alcohol and Substance Abuse Center operated by the Department of Correction or the Hampden County Jail and House of Correction; (2) consideration for release of all persons civilly committed to the Massachusetts Treatment Center who have not been adjudicated a sexually dangerous person, as well as all persons committed to Bridgewater State Hospital for evaluation of competency or criminal responsibility; (3) a policy that no person should be categorically excluded from relief due to the underlying criminal offense, without consideration of actual dangerousness; (4) consideration for release of all individuals over 50; and (5) an order that the Parole Board (a) explicitly consider COVID-19 when it evaluates whether release is &ldquo;incompatible with the welfare of society&rdquo; pursuant to state law, and (b) shall presumptively grant parole to all parole eligible individuals unless it makes a determination based on clear and convincing evidence that the person cannot live at liberty without violating the law.</p>\r\n<p>On Tuesday, March 31, the court heard <a href=\"https://boston.suffolk.edu/sjc/pop.php?csnum=SJC_12926\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">oral argument</a> on the emergency petition. The parties included MACDL, Committee for Public Counsel Services, the Attorney General, District Attorneys, and sheriffs of 14 counties. Subsequently, on April 1, the court ordered the Department of Corrections and the Sheriffs to submit post-argument letters answering questions about percentages of prisoners who share eating, sleeping, and recreation spaces within six feet.</p>\r\n<p>On April 3, Judge Gaziano entered an order, holding that certain detainees were entitled a rebuttable presumption of release and to an expedited hearing within two business days on their motions for reconsideration of bail. The court required defendants to submit daily reports to the special master on population, releases, COVID-19 testing and results, which in turn would be reported weekly to the court.</p>\r\n<p>On April 17, the plaintiffs submitted a motion for reconsideration, requesting further response from the court because--since the order was issued--five inmates had died from COVID-19, 180 inmates were infected, and at least 138 correctional staff were infected. According to the plaintiffs, the overall population reduction was only 168 people, or 2.17%, which was not enough to mitigate COVID-19. They also alleged that the DOC did not submit daily reports, including facility-specific information, as required by the order. They asked the court to order the defendants to provide all missing data and to provide daily reports, including facility-specific information on weekdays, weekends, and holidays moving forward.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 22, the plaintiffs submitted a complaint for civil contempt, but dismissed the complaint the following day. According to the weekly report dated April 27, 824 inmates had been released.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 28, the Supreme Judicial Court affirmed their prior decision regarding their constitutional authority to stay final sentences absent an ongoing challenge to the underlying convictions or a violation of constitutional rights. However, the court agreed with the requested relief given by the lower court for additional reporting, and amended the reporting requirements to include additional information to aid individuals to pursue release, such as the identity of those who were serving sentences in houses of correction who had not reached their parole eligibility dates, but were eligible for early consideration. 484 Mass. 1029.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The special master has continued to file weekly reports and, according to the October 15, 2021 report, 7,301 inmates had been released. The case remains ongoing.</p>",

The Department \nstates that the concerns raised by the petitioners in the Motion \nare properly addressed to and resolved by the Special Master for \nin the first instance. \n \n \n1 \n \n\n \n \nFACTS \nI.  The Department’s Data Reporting. \nSince  April  6,  2020,  the  Department  has  provided  daily \nreports to the Special Master containing the information sought in \nAppendix  B  of  the  Opinion—-its  overall  inmate  population;  the \nnumber of COVID-19 tests of inmates, and the number of positive \nresults  for  all  inmates,  correction  officers  and  other  staff \nmembers  (including  contractors),  and  the  number  of  inmates  who \nhave  been  released  pursuant  to  the  procedures  or  guidance  set \nforth  in  this  decision.    The  Department’s  COVID-19  Data \nspreadsheet for April 21, 2020, which shows these numbers on a \ndaily basis, is attached and is explained further below.   \nAs  stated  at  argument,  the  Department  cannot  provide  the \nnumber of COVID-19 tests of its correction officers or other staff \nmembers because it does not conduct COVID-19 tests of its staff —-\nstaff are tested by their own private physicians or at testing \nsites for first responders—-at this point the Department does not \nhave the total number of tests or the number of negative tests.  \nAccordingly, the Department reports daily the number of positive \nresults for its correction officers and other staff based on these \nindividuals’ self-reports of this information to the Department. \nThe  COVID-19  Data  spreadsheet,  attached,  shows  the \nDepartment’s daily population for each day since April 6, 2020, \nbroken  down  by  jurisdiction  (those  detained,  committed,  or \n2 \n \n\n \n \nsentenced  to  Department  custody  regardless  of  where  they  are \nhoused)  and  custody  (those  housed  in  Department  facilities \nregardless of what jurisdiction detained, committed, or sentenced \nthem).  As the custody population shows who are actually housed in \nDepartment facilities, it is most relevant here. \nFrom the time period of April 6 through April 21, 2020, the \nDepartment’s criminally-sentenced population has decreased by 134 \ninmates, from 7,227 to 7,093.  Over this same fifteen-day period, \nthe Department’s civilly committed population has decreased by 68 \ncommitments  (from  437  to  369),  and  its  pretrial  population  has \ndecreased by 9 detainees to a current total of 63 detainees.  See \nCOVID-19 Data spreadsheet (April 21, 2020). So, a total of 211 \nindividuals have been released from Department custody in fifteen \ndays, a decrease of 2.73% from its April 6, 2020 population of \n7,735.    Of  these  211  releases,  12  sentenced  inmates  have  been \nreleased  by  order  of  the  trial  court,  following  a  stay  or \nrevocation of sentence.  See COVID-19 Data spreadsheet at total of \nInmates Released Pursuant to Decision (Sentenced) column.  Since \nApril 6, 2020, two medical parole petitions have been approved, \nand six inmates have been released from custody on medical parole \nsince the state of emergency was declared on March 10, 2020. \nThe  COVID-19  Data  spreadsheet’s  number  of  inmate  tests \nconducted,  number  of  inmate  positive  tests,  DOC  staff  positive \ntests, and other staff positive tests, contain total numbers as of \n3 \n \n\n \n \nthe  date  of  the  daily  report.    As  of  April  21,  2020,  the \nDepartment’s medical vendor has conducted 294 tests, the majority \nof  them  being  for  unique  inmates,  but  some  inmates  have  been \ntested multiple times (e.g., an inmate remaining symptomatic after \na  negative  test  result;  a  positive  inmate  being  tested  after \nbecoming  asymptomatic).    In  addition  to  sick  and  symptomatic \ninmates,  the  Department’s  vendor  also  tests  inmates  being \ntransferred  to  non-Department  facilities,  e.g.,  long-term  care \nfacilities, as well as high-risk inmates being released so as to \nlimit the spread of COVID to such facilities and to the community.   \nThat the Department’s vendor has conducted 294 total tests \n(as of April 21, 2020) in fifteen days does not show that it is \n“rarely testing anyone” as claimed; it shows that the Department \nis  responsibly  managing  its  resources  by  prioritizing  tests  of \nsymptomatic  inmates,  multiple  times  if  necessary,  as  well  as \ninmates who are being transferred or released to the community or \na medical/nursing care facility.  As of Wednesday, April 22, 2020, \nthe  Department  will  host  a  mobile  COVID-19  test  site  with  the \nability to test up to 200 individuals, both inmates and staff, per \nday. \nThe  report  for  April  21,  2020  shows  that  there  are  123 \ninmates who have tested positive.  COVID-19 Data (April 21, 2020).  \nThis number includes inmates who have died as well as those who \nhave tested positive and recovered—-as of this filing there have \n4 \n \n\n \n \nbeen 4 inmates (all at the Massachusetts Treatment Center) who had \ntested positive but have fully recovered.   \nThe Special Master requested that the Department break down \nthe number of inmate positives by facility, so, beginning with the \ndaily report on April 13, 2020, the Department did so.  See COVID-\n19 Data By Facility/INMATE DATA, attached.  The main spreadsheet \nand the breakdown includes all inmates who have tested positive, \nand  does  not  take  inmate  recovery  into  account.    Over  the \nreporting period from April 13 through 21, 2020, the report shows \nthat  inmate  positives  have  remained  the  same  at  Bridgewater \nHospital  (12),  and  the  Department’s  unit  at  Lemuel  Shattuck \nHospital  (1).    See  COVID-19  Data  By  Facility/INMATE  DATA, \nattached.    The  report  also  shows  that  inmate  positives  had \nremained steady at the Massachusetts Treatment Center from April \n13  through  17,  2020,  at  41,  had  decreased  to  38,  and  have \nincreased to a current 43 as of the April 21, 2020 report.  While \nthe number has changed, it has remained in the 41-43 range (or \nless) over the nine-day reporting period.\n \nThe report shows that there has been one inmate positive test \nat MCI-Norfolk beginning on April 18, 2020. The report also shows \nthat, while the positives increased from 26 to 28 overnight from \nApril 18 to 19 at MCI-Framingham, the inmate positive tests at \nthis  facility  had  remained  steady  at  26  from  April  14  through \n5 \n \n\n \n \nApril 18, 2020, and have just decreased to 27.1  The data does \nshow that there has been an increase in inmate positive tests at \nMCI-Shirley from 9 on April 13th to 39 on April 21, 2020.  As of \nApril  13,  2020,  MCI-Shirley  held  1,053  inmates,  so  the  39 \npositives  results  in  a  3.7%  infection  rate  at  this  facility.  \nDepartment facilities remain in lockdown to contain the spread of \nCOVID, so these numbers will be closely monitored.  \nAs of the April 21, 2020 report, there have been five deaths \ndue to COVID of the 7,524 inmates housed in Department facilities:  \nfour who had been housed at the Massachusetts Treatment Center, \nand one who had been housed at MCI-Shirley.  The five inmates who \nhave died ranged in age from 59 to 79.  All five were treated in \noutside  hospitals  and  had  COVID-aggravating  conditions  and  co-\nmorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and cancer.   \nThe overall number of DOC staff reporting positive is, as of \nApril 21, 2020, 61.  See COVID-19 Data (4/21/2020).  Until the \nApril  21,  2020  report,  the  Department  had  been  reporting  the \nnumber of staff who had tested positive and had not recovered (and \nreturned to work).  Based on a request from the Special Master, \nhowever,  starting  on  April  21,  2020,  the  Department  began \nreporting the total number of staff positives, and the 61 reported \nin that report included 11 DOC staff who tested positive, fully \n                                                 \n1 As of April 13, 2020, MCI-Framingham held 198 inmates, so the highest number of \n28 positives does reflect a 14% infection rate for that facility.   \n6 \n \n\n \n \nrecovered, and returned to work.  Other staff positives, including \nvendor staff, have remained in the 20-24 range since April 14, \n2020.  Ibid.   \nBased on a request from the Special Master, the Department \nbegan reporting its staff self-reported positives broken down by \nfacility beginning with the daily report on April 15, 2020.  See \nCOVID-19 Data By Facility/STAFF DATA COVID-19 POSITIVES (April 21, \n2020).  This break-down report takes into account DOC staff who, \nas  of  that  day,  have  tested  positive  and  have  not  returned  to \nwork.2    Over  the  course  of  the  seven-day  reporting  period,  the \nreport  shows  that,  for  those  facilities  where  there  have  been \nstaff  positives,  these  numbers  have  remained  steady  (with  the \nexception of MCI-Cedar Junction and MCI-Shirley).  See COVID-19 \nData By Facility/STAFF DATA COVID-19 POSITIVES.  The data shows \nthat,  while  there  have  been  increases  in  two  facilities,  the \nnumber of staff testing positive for COVID-19 has remained in a \nsteady range. \nIn the end, Department-reported numbers simply do not support \npetitioners’ sweeping contention that “there can be no credible \nclaim that the current pace of releases will suffice to curb the \nspread  of  COVID-19,  and  with  it  the  risk  of  more  illness  and \ndeath,  in  the  Commonwealth’s  carceral  settings.”    Motion  at  3.  \n                                                 \n2 Note that the total number of staff on the STAFF DATA COVID-19 POSITIVES \nspreadsheet for 4/21/2020 is 50.  The difference between this total (50) and \nthe 61 reported on the COVID-19 Data spreadsheet is the 11 staff who have \nrecovered and returned to work. \n7 \n \n\n \n \nRather, the Department’s reporting shows that the number of inmate \ninfections  has  remained  steady  at  the  vast  majority  of  its \nfacilities, as has the number of staff infections.   \nII.  The Department’s Efforts to Accommodate the Defense Bar. \n  To the extent the Motion insinuates that the Department has \nnot been facilitating communication between petitioners and their \nclients, Motion at pp 12-13, this is inaccurate.  On April 10, \n2020, the Department sent petitioners and other inmate advocacy \norganizations  an  Announcement  for  Attorneys.    This  document \ninforms attorneys of a newly-established centralized process for \nattorneys  to  change  their  telephone  numbers  on  their  client’s \ncalling lists, and also announced a process designed to arrange a \ntelephone call between attorney and client within 24 hours, and, \nas of April 21, 2020, within a pre-established call window.  See \nAnnouncement  for  Attorneys  (Changes  Made  Effective  April  21, \n2020), attached.  These two processes are in addition to the free, \nnon-recorded calls inmates may make to the CPCS COVID-19 hotline, \nthe Prisoners’ Legal Services hotline, and the newly-established \nCPCS parole assistance hotline.   \nARGUMENT \nI.  Motions for Reconsideration. \nPetitioners do not identify any change in circumstances or \nnew  information or  evidence  that  would  warrant reconsideration \nof the Court’s prior decision.  See Town of Dartmouth v. Greater \n8 \n \n\n \n \nNew Bedford Regional Vocational Technical High School District, \n461 Mass. 366, 368 n. 4 (2012)(“Where there has been no change \nof circumstances, a court or judge is not bound to reconsider a \ncase,  an  issue,  or  a  question  of  fact  or  law,  once  decided.”  \n(quoting Peterson v. Hopson, 306 Mass. 597, 599 (1940)).  That \nthe  pandemic  has  progressed,  both  inside  Department  facilities \nand  in  the  rest  of  the  Commonwealth,  is  not  a  change  in \ncircumstances warranting the Court to reconsider its twenty-day \nold opinion. \nTo  the  extent  that  the  petitioners  repeat  the  same \narguments made before, see generally Motion, that is not grounds \nfor  reconsideration.    Parties  are  not  entitled  to  seek \nreconsideration merely to repeat “prior unsuccessful arguments.”  \nAudubon  Hill  South  Condominium  Ass’n  v.  Community  Ass’n \nUnderwriters of America, Inc., 82 Mass.App.Ct. 461, 471 (2012).  \nA “motion for reconsideration is not ‘the appropriate place to \nraise new arguments inspired by a loss before the motion judge’” \nor  to  “tender  new  legal  theories  for  [the]  first  time.”  \nCommissioner  of  Revenue  v.  Comcast  Corp.,  453  Mass.  293,  312 \n(2009), quoting Commonwealth v. Gilday, 409 Mass. 45, 46 n. 3 \n(1991). \nII.  The Petitioners Should Be Required To Take Any Proposed \nChange to the Reporting Requirements to the Special Master. \n   \n9 \n \n\n \n \n  The Motion requests that the Court now order the Department \nto  provide  the  petitioners  information  regarding  certain \ncategories of sentenced inmates.  Motion at pp 16-17.  The Motion \ndoes not state that the petitioners have first made this request \nthrough the Special Master, and the Court should direct them to do \njust that in the first instance. \nThis Court has ordered that “the Special Master may assist \nthe  court  with  implementing  any  orders  if  such  orders  issue.”  \nDocket at Paper #2.  Moreover, in its opinion, the Court states \nthat “[t]he special master shall report weekly to this court, as \nset  forth  in  this  opinion,  in  order  to  facilitate  any  further \nresponse  necessary  as  a  result  of  this  rapidly  evolving \nsituation.”  Docket at Paper #65.  It is clear that the Court’s \nOrder that the Special Master report weekly in order to facilitate \nany further response includes the ability to resolve disputes when \nit comes to the reporting requirements in the Opinion.  Any claim \nfor new information not requested in Appendix B of the opinion \nshould  be  first  brought  to  the  Special  Master  for  possible \nresolution.   \n  In accordance with Appendix B of the opinion, the Department \nreports daily the following information concerning each pretrial \ndetainee  in  its  custody:    name,  Department  commitment  number, \ngender, housing institution, date of birth, age, jurisdiction of \ndetaining  court,  county  of  detaining  court,  name  of  detaining \n10 \n \n\n \n \ncourt,  docket  number(s)  for  which  detention  order  has  been \nreceived, type of warrant received and disposition of such warrant \n(where  this  information  is  known).    It  takes  considerable \nDepartment  staff  time  to  obtain  this  information  and  the  other \ninformation provided in the daily report.  Because of the strain \nthat the daily reporting requirements place on the Department’s \ndata  collection  and  analysis  divisions,  any  change  to  existing \nreporting requirements must consider the efficacy and importance \nof this additional information sought.   \n  Finally, the Motion states that “[p]etitioners have had to \nundertake substantial efforts just to get the DOC to report as \nmuch information to the Special Master as it does to the media,” \nrelying  on  a  Tweet  in  support  of  this  proposition.    Motion  at \np.12.  As stated above, the Department has consistently reported \nthe information requested in Appendix B of the Court’s decision.  \nWhere  additional  information  has  been  sought  by  the  Special \nMaster—-either new categories of information in the daily report, \ninformation  concerning  specific  inmates,  or  clarification \nregarding information already proved—-the Department has provided \nthis information fully and promptly.   \n \n \n \n \n11 \n \n\n \n \n \nCONCLUSION \n  For  the  reasons  stated  above,  petitioners’  Motion  for \nReconsideration or Modification of Decision should be DENIED.  \n \n        Respectfully submitted, \n \n        THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION, \n \n        By its attorneys, \n \n        NANCY ANKERS WHITE \n        Special Assistant Attorney General \n \n \n        /s/ Charles W.

These measures are for \ncontacting inmates housed in DOC facilities only; attorneys contacting inmates housed in \njails and houses of correction must contact that facility or the respective Sheriff’s Office. \n \nThe first measure is to establish a standard and centralized process so attorneys can change their \ntelephone numbers on the PIN list of inmates in DOC custody during the pandemic.  Attorneys \nrequesting to change their telephone numbers must call DOC’s Office of Investigative Services \n(OIS) at 508-958-3668, which will be staffed on Mondays through Fridays from 8:00 a.m. to \n3:00 p.m.  Attorneys should provide their old telephone number, the new telephone number, and \nthe name(s), DOC commitment number(s), and current housing facility (facilities) of their \nclients. The contact person in OIS for this process is Officer Thomas Perry.  OIS staff will make \nthe requested changes and notify the facility, who will then notify the inmate. \n \nIf, after completing this process, there are any difficulties with the change in number, attorneys \nshould contact Assistant Deputy Commissioner Pat DePalo at: \nPatrick.Depalo@MassMail.State.MA.US.    \n \nAttorneys are strongly encouraged to use this process, as contacting the housing facility directly \nwill likely result in a delay in getting the telephone number changed. \n \nThe second measure is designed to ensure that attorneys can contact their clients housed in DOC \nfacilities to arrange for a call with their new or existing client within 24 hours, and during a \nspecified time window (9 a.m. to 11 a.m.; 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.; 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.).  Attorneys are \nstrongly encouraged to use the following process:   \n \n1)  The attorney will call the facility (Point of Contact and number are provided below for \neach facility) Monday through Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.  After 5:00 p.m. on \nweekdays and weekends, attorneys will call the same line and ask for the Shift \nCommander.  Attorneys should provide the time window which they are available to \nreceive the return call (9 a.m. to 11 a.m.; 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.; or 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.). \n2)  The inmate will be given the message they need to call their attorney within a 24 hour \nperiod, and during the specified time window. \n3)  The inmate will be allowed access to the unit phone to call. \n4)  Any updates or changes to the attorney’s numbers will be addressed by OIS using the \nprocedure above, so the most accurate number will be in the Inmate Calling System for \nthe attorney to receive the call. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 \n \n\n \nFor federal detainees held at MCI-Cedar Junction, the following process is to be used: \n \n1)  Vanessa Rideout is assigned to the Federal Unit as the Correctional Program Officer. \n2)  Attorneys for federal detainees can contact CPO Rideout from 8:30am - 3:00 PM \nMonday through Friday by telephone at 508-660-3000 ext. 106, or by email at \nVanessa.Rideout@doc.state.ma.us. \n3)  CPO Rideout will coordinate with the attorney the date and time for the telephone call to \nbe placed to the attorney from the detainee at MCI-Cedar Junction. \n \n \nFacility  Point of Contact #  Off Hours Number (Ask for Shift Commander) \n     \nBoston Pre-Release   617-822-5000  x 6125  617-822-5000 x 6135/6100 \nLemuel Shattuck Hospital  508-889-2742  617-971-3384 \nMCI-Cedar Junction  508-660-8000 x 111  508-660-8000 x 201 \nMCI-Norfolk  508-660-5900 x 424  508-660-5900 x 477 \nPondville Corr.

ChiefJ ustice ofrhe Tr;a[ Court, el. a/. \nSJC Docket No. SJC-12926 \nTn response to the Court's order of April I, 2020, the Middlesex Sheriff's Office (\"MSO\") \nprovides the following information as of April I, 2020: \n1)  A)lpt·oximately what percentage of inmates or detainees sleep within six feet of another \ninmate or detainee? Individuals in disciplinary isolation should be excluded fl·om this \nestimate. \n64.01% of our incarcerated population sleep within six feet of each other.  This \npercentage could be significantly reduced if we moved our incarcerated population in a \nway to rnaximize space and minimi7.e physical distance.  However, we have followed the \nrecommendations of our infectious disease specialist and external medical experts \nregarding movement to ensure COVlD-19 is not spread throughout the entire facility. \nThis approach to limit inmate movement has allowed us to contain the number of \nCOVID-19 positive cases to two (2) within our incarcerated population. \nIn addition, the MSO has taken steps lo reduce this percentage where practical.  We are \nactively reviewing the CDC guidelines that allo\"v for our incarcerated population to slet:p \nin a head-to-toe arrangement.  rn addition, those incarcerated individuals that arc double \nbunked have a steel plate that separates them from one another while sleeping.  The MSO \nhas taken additional preventative measures to sanitize and clean the living enviro1m1ent \nfor incarcerated individuals during each shift. \n2)  Approximately what percentage of inmates or dctninces eat meals within six feet of \nanother inmate or detainee? \n92.67% of our im:arccrated population could possibly eat meals within six feet of each \nother.  llowcver, the MSO has worked diligently to limit the oppottunilies for this to take \nPage 1 of2 \n\nplace. Meals arc provided to one section of a housing unit at a time lo limit large \ngatherings. We have also repeatedly educated, encouraged and directed our incarcerated \npopulation regarding proper hygiene (hand washing, not sharing utensils, proper disposal \nof trays) and physical distancing while eating. There is more than adequate space in each \nhousing unit for individuals to comply, however, many choose not to.  We have not \nenforced any discipline for individuals thai have not complied. \nAgain, this percentage could be significantly reduced if we moved our incarcerated \npopulation in a way to maximize space and minimize physical distance.  However, we \nhave followed the reconunendations of our infectious disease specialist and external \nmedical experts regarding movement to ensure COVID-19 is not spread throughout the \nentire facility. \n3) Approximately what percentage of Inmates or detainees arc permitted to he within six \nfeet of each other du.-ing recreation periods? \n96.84% of our incarcerated population could possibly recreate within six feet of each \nother.  However, the MSO has worked diligently to limit the opportunities for this to take \np!Hce.  Recreation is provided to one section of a housing unital a time to Ii mit large \ngatherings .. We have also repeatedly educated, encouraged and directed our incarcerated \npopulation regarding appropriate physical distancing wrule recreating.  There is more \nthan adequate space in each housing unit for individuals to comply, however, many \nchoose not to.

The \nfoJIO'\\.ving statistical data and responses were gathered by Superintendent Daniel Hart and \neffective April 2, 2020 in response to questions posed by the Court. \n1. Approximately what percenLage of inmates or detainees sleep within six feet of another inmate \nor detainee? fndividuals in disciplinary isolation should be excluded from this estimate. \nAnswer:  0% \nExplanation: Out of current inmate population of 175, 127 or 73% of our inmates are either \nhoused in single cells or single occupancy rooms. We have physically distanced the beds to \nallow at minimum six foot separation while sleeping for 4R remaining im11ates housed in \nmultiple occupancy rooms to the point of using a tape measure to ensure proper distancing if the \ndistances are remotely close to 6 feet. Wherever possible we exceed that 6 foot minimum \n2. ApproximaLely what percentage of inmates or detainees eat meals within six feet of another \ninmate ot detainee? \nAnswer: 0% \nExplanation: Within the main building and the modular units feeding continues to occur in the. \nmain dining hall. The main dining hall has space to feed 64 total inmates at any one seating. We \nhave expanded our feeding period fl:om four to five feeding periods in order lo increase the space \navailable to the inmates while they eat. Security staff has been enforcing the six foot rule \nbetween diners for several weeks now. The increase in feeding gnmps has allowed for smaller \ngroups to be fed at any given feeding period. \n3. Approximately what percentage of inmates or detainees are permitted to be within six feet of \neach other dllling recreation periods? \nAnswer: 0% \n\nRecreation periods have been increased or staggered for the same reason feeding periods have \nbeen increased or staggered: more periods result in smaller numbers recreating at any given time. \nThe recreation areas aJe open air sufficiently large for the officers to maintain at least six feet of \nspacing between people.  If inmates/d.etainee.s try to congregate, oflicers separate them to keep \nadequate distances. We have also suspended those recreational activities that by their nature \nwould necessarily involve closer contact than 6 feet including basketball, volleyball etc ..... \nVery truly yours, \nCharles M.

Approximately 49.2% of irunates or detainees sleep within six feet of one \nanother. This is based on a housing analysis of all inmates and detainees in \nthe Facility, excluding disciplinary detention inmates as instructed.  Inmate \nbunks are constructed of 3/16 inch thick steel. \n2.  Approximately 56.72% of inmates eat their meals within six feet of one \nanother.  This estimate is based on observation of irunates in typical units on \nthe date of the Order.  The inmates in most housing units come out in two \nseparated groups to eat and have multiple seating options which provide \nsignificant opJ10rtunity for social distancing. \n3.  Approximately 4 7.36% of inmates are pennitted to be within six feet of one \nanother during recreation periods. This is based on observation of inmates in \ntypical units on the date of the Order.  The inmates in most units have split \nrecreation periods which offer significant opportunity for social distancing, \nand the officers and supervisors routinely reinforce the importance of such \nsocial distancing. \nsubmitted, \nGeneral Counsel \nABINGTON· BRIOGFWATFR • BROCKTON • CARVER • f')UXRURY • EJIST BRIDGEWATFR-HALIFAX· HANOVER • HANSON • HINGHAM \nHULL• KINGSTON • LAKEVILLE· MARION • MARSHFIELD • MATit.POISETI ·I /IDOL EBOROUGH ·NORWELL • PEMBROKE • PLYMOUTH \nPLYMPTON· AUCHES~EP • ROCKLAND • SCITUATE • WAREHAM-WE&T BRIDGEWATER • WHITMJIN \n\nOFFICE Of THE SHERIFF \nBARNSTABLECDINTY \nThe Common~alth of MassachWJett8 \n6000 Sheriff's Place, Oou~, MA 01532 \nS08.S6H300 Fax: 508.563.4574 \nB~ bsheriff.net \nACCREDITED \nSbllftl \nJamu I.

AJ1proximately what percentage of inmates or detainees sleep within six led of another inmate or detainee? \nfndividuals in disciplinary isolation should be excluded from this estima1e. \n6 inmates out of 178 (3 %) are double-bunked.  These double-bunked inmates have a sted bunk \nseparating the inmate on the upper bunk from lhc.:: inmate on the lower bunk.  Inmates sleep in a head-to \ntoe an-angement as recommended by tl1e CDC.  In other words, the inmate 011 the Lop bunk sleeps vvith \nhis head closest to the cell door while lhe inmate on the lower bunk sleeps \\Vith his feet are closest to the \ncell door. \nThe 172 other inmates (97 %) have their own individual cells with their o~n toilets. sinks. hot water and \n:soap. \n2.  Approximately what percentage of inmates or detainees eat meals within six feet of another inmate or \ndetainee? \nWe have 7 open pods housing lrmn 7 inmates to 39 inmates per housing unit (pod).  All housing units \nconsist of 862 7 square feet of space.  So each inmate h<ls alleasr 221 square feet of space in the housing \nunit.  When recreation decks are open (weather permitting), there is another I ()05 square feet of space \nper housing unit.  Despite this and despite repeatedly educating inmates to stay at least 6 feet away from \none another, most inmates (approximately 75%) choose to sit within six feet of another imnatc while \neating.  F.very inmate has the ability to go to his cell and cat with 6 leel of separation.  In double-bunked \ncells, one inmate could eat in the cell and the other on the dayroom floor.  We could, but have not, \nlocked inmates down to force the 6 foot separation. \n3.  Approximately what percentage of irunatcs or detain~es an: pennilted to be within six feet of each other \nduring recreation periods? \nAll inmates have the ability to recreate six feet fl om one another.  Inmates ha\\ c the ability to walk inside \nor (weather pcnnitting) outside on re<.-T~ation decks, do pull ups, pushups, situps, dips, etc. with 6 feet of \nseparation.  The inmates who choose to play basketball or go to the weight room (totaling approximately \n40% of the inmate population) are normally within 6 feet of one another for some portion of the \nrecreation period. We could order itunatcs to recreate six feet from one another and lock them down if \nthey don \"t ~;om ply. but you can only lock inmates in and take away their tavorite recreational activities \nfor so long under such conditions before you have unrest. \nIf these inmates were released from custody, what would prevent them from congregating, recreating and eating \nwithin six feet from one another if they chose to do so?  Martial Jaw has not been imposed. \n\nIf we did lock inmates down to force separation, the petitioners who brought this action would complain about \nthose conditions. \n\nSupreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth    Full Court:   SJC-12926      Filed: 4/2/2020 12:38 PM\n~ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n~-CDC 21./7: Saving Lives. Protecting People'M \nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) \n-----------------------------------\nInterim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus \nDisease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and \nDetention Facilities \nPrinter fnendly version \nThis Interim guidance is based on whal is currently known about the transmission and severity of coronavirus \ndisease 2019 (COVID-19) as of the date of posting. March 23, 2020. \nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this guidance as needed and as additional \ninformation becomes available. Please check the CDC website periodically for updated interim guidance. \nThis document provides Interim guidance specific for correctional facilities and detention centers during the \noutbreak of COVID-19, to ensure continuation of essential public services and protection of the health and safety of \nincarcerated and detained persons, staff. and visitors. Recommendations may need to be revised as more \ninformation becomes available. \nWho is the intended audience for this guidance? \nThis document is intended to provide guiding principles for healthcare and non-healthcare administrators of correctional \nilnd detention facilities (including but not lim1ted to federal and state prisons, local jails, and detention centers). law \nenforcement agencies that have custodial authority for detained populations (i.e., US Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement and US Marshals Service), and their respective health departments, to assist in preparing for potential \nintroduction, spread. and mitigation of COVID-19 in their facilities. In general. the document uses terminology referring to \ncorrectional environments but can also be applied to civil and pre-trial detention settings. \nThis guidance will not necessarily address every possible custodial setting and may not use legal terminology specific to \nindividual agencies' authorities or processes, The guidance may need to be adapted based on individual facilities' \nphysical space, staffing, population, operations, and other resources and conditions. Facilities should contact \nCDC or their state, local, territorial, and/or tribal public health department If they need assistance in applying these \nprinciples or addressing topics that are not specifically covered in this guidance. \nWhy is this guidance being issued? \nCorrectional and detention faCilities can Include custody, housing. education, recreation, heafthcare. food servrce, and \nworkplace components in a single physical setting. The integration of these components presents unique challenges for \ncontrol of COVID-19transmiSSion among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, and visitors. Consistent application of \n\nspecific preparation, prevention, and management measures can help reduce the risk of transmission and severe disease \nfrom COVID-19. \n•  Incarcerated/detained persons live, work, eat, study, and recreate within congregate environments, heightenmg the \npotential for COVID-19 to spread once introduced. \n•  In most cases, incarcerated/detamed persons are not permitted to leave the faCility. \n•  There are many opportunities for COVID-19 to be introduced Into a correctional or detention facility, including daily \nstaff ingress and egress; transfer of incarcerated/detained persons between facilities and systems, to courl \nappearances. and Lo outside medical visits; and visits from family, legal representatives, and other community \nmembers. Some setlings, partiCUlarly jails and detention centers, have high turnover, admitting new entrants daily \nwho may have been exposed to COVID-19 in the surrounding community or other regions. \n•  Persons incarcerated/detained in a particular facility often come from a variety of locations. increasing Lhe potential \nto introduce COVID-19 from different geographic areas. \n•  Options for medical isolation of COVID-19 cases are limited and vary depending on the type and size of facility, as \nwell as the current level of available capacity, which is partly based on medical isolation needs for other cond1tions. \n•  Adequate levels of custody and healthcare staffing must be maintained to ensure safe operation ofthe facility, and \noptions to practice social distancing through work alternatives such as work1ng from home or reduced/alternate \nschedules are limited for many staff roles. \n•  Correctional and detention facilities can be complex, multi-employer settings thal include government and private \nemployers. Each is organizationally distinct and responsible for its own operational, personnel. and occupational \nhealth protocols and may be prohibited from issuing guidance or providing services to other employers or their staff \nwithin the same setting. SimiiCJrly, correctional and detention facilities may house individuals from multiple law \nenforcement agencies or jurisdictions subject to different policies and procedures. \n•  Incarcerated/detained persons and staff may have medical conditions Lhal inuease 1heir nsk of severe disease from \nCOVID·19. \n•  Because lim1ted outside information is available to many Incarcerated/detained persons. unease and \nmisinformation regarding the potential for COVID·19 spread may be high, potentially creating security and morale \nchallenges. \n•  The ability of incarcerated/detained persons to exercise diseCJse prevention measures (e.g .. frequent handwashing) \nmay be limited and is determined by the supplies provided In the facility and by security considerations. Many \nfacilities restrict access to soap and paper towels and prohibit alcohol-based hand sanitizer and many disinfectants. \n•  Incarcerated persons may hesitate to report symptoms of COVID-19 or seek medical care due to co-pay \nrequirements and fear of isolation. \nCDC has 1ssued separate COVID-19 guidance addressing hevlthcare infection control and clinical care of COVID-19 cases \nas well as close contac~s of cases in community-based settings. Where relevant, community-focused guidance documents \nare referenced in this document and should be monitored regularly for updates, but they may require adaptation for \ncorrectional and detention settings. \nThis guidance document provides additional recommended best practices specifically for correctional and detention \nfacilities. At this time. different facility types (e.g., prison vs. jail) and sizes are not differentiated. \nAdministrators and agencies should adapt these guiding principles to the specific needs of their facility. \nWhat topics does this guidance include? \nThe guidance below includes detailed recommendations on the following topics related to COVID-19 in correctional and \ndetention settings: \n\n•  Operational and communications preparations for COVID-19 \n•  Enhanced cleaning/distnfecting and hygiene practices \n•  Social distancing strategies to increase space between individuals m the facility \n•  How to limit transmission from visitors \n•  Infection control, including recommended personal protect1ve equipment (PPE} and potential alternatives during \nPPE shortages \n•  Verbal screening and temperature check protocols for incoming incarcerated/detained individuals, staff, and visitors \n•  Medical isolation of confirmed and suspected cases and quarantine of contacts, includmg considerations for \ncohorting when individual spaces are limited \n•  Healthcare evaluation for suspected cases. including testing for COVID-19 \n•  Clinical care for confirmed and suspected cases \n•  Considerations for persons at higher risk of severe disease from COVID-19 \nDefinitions of Commonly Used Terms \nClose contact of a COV I D· 19 case - In the context of COVID-19, an individual is considered a close contact if they a) \nhave been within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time or b) have had direct cont<:~ct \nwith Infectious secretions from a COVID-19 case (e.g., have been coughed on}. Close comacl can occur while caring for, \nliving with. visiting, or sharing a common space with a COVID-19 case. Data to inform the definition of close contact are \nlimited. Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g .. longer exposure time likely \nincreases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure \nrisk, as does exposure to a severely ill patient). \nCohorting- Cohorting refers to the practice of isolating multiple laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases together as a \ngroup, or quarantining close contacts of a particular case together as a group. Ideally, cases should be isolated \nindividually, and close contacts should be quarantined individually. However, some correctional facilities and detention \ncenters do not have enough individual cells to do so and must consider cohorting as an alternative. See Quar<Jntine and \nMedical Isolation sections below for specific details about ways to implement cohorting to minimize the risk of disease \nspread and adverse health outcomes. \nCommunity transmission of COVID-19 -Community transmission of COVID-19 occurs when individuals acquire the \ndisease through contact with someone in their local community, rather than through travel to an affected location. Once \ncommunity transmission is identified in a particular area, correctional facilities and detention centers are more likely to \nstart seeing cases Inside their walls. Facilities should consult with local public health departments if assistance 1s needed \nin determining how to define \"local community'' in the context of COVID-19 spread. However, because all states have \nreported cases, all facilities should be vigilant for introduaion into their populations. \nConfirmed vs. Suspected COVID-19 case-A confirmed case has received a positive result from a COVID-19 \nlaboratory test, with or without symptoms. A suspected case shows symptoms of COVID-19 but either has not been \ntested or is awaiting test results. If test results are positive. a suspected case becomes a confirmed case. \nIncarcerated/detained persons- For the purpose of this document. \"incarceruted/detained persons\" refers to persons \nheld in a prison, Jail, detention center. or other custodial setting where these guidelines are generally applicable. The term \nincludes those who have been sentenced (i.e .. in prisons) as welt as those held for pre-trial (i.e., jails) or civil purposes (i.e, \ndetention centers). Although this guidance does not specifically reference individuals in every type of custodial setting \n(e.g .. juvenile facilities. community confinement facilities). facility administrators can adapt this guidance to apply to the1r \nspecific circumstances as needed. \n\nMedical Isolation-Medical isolatron refers to confining a confirmed or-suspected COVID-19 case (ideally to a single cell \nwith soltd walls and a solid door that closes), to prevenL contact with others and to reduce the risk of transmission. \nMedical isolation ends when the indivtdual meets pre-established clinrcal and/or testing cnteria for release from isolation, \nin consul1:ation with clinical providers and public health officrals (detailed in guidance below)\" In this context. isolation \ndoes NOT refer to punitive isolation for behavioral infractions wrthin the custodial setting. Staff are encouraged to use the \nterm \"medical isolation\" to avoid confusion. \nQuarantine-Quarantine refers to the practice of confining individuals who have had close contact with a COVID-19 case \nto determine wherher they develop symptoms of the disease. Quarantine for COVID-19 should last for a period of 14 \ndays. Ideally. each quaranlined individual would be quarantined in a single cell with solid walls and a solid door that \ncloses. If symptoms develop during the 14-day period, the individual should be placed under medical rsolatron and \nevaluated for COVID-19. If symptoms do not develop, movement restrictions can be lifted. and the individual can return \nto their previous residency status within the facility, \nSocial Distancing- Social distancing is the practice of increasing the space betvveen individuals and decreasing the \nfrequency of contact to reduce the risk of spreading a dise.ase (ideally to maintain at least 6 feet between all individuals, \neven those who are asymptomatic). Social distancing strategies can be applied on an individual level (e.g., avoiding \nphysical contact), a group level (e.g., canceling group activities where individuals will be in close contact), and an \noperational level (e.g., rearranging chairs in the dining hall to increase distance between them). Although social distancing \nis challenging to practice in correctional and detention environments, it is a cornerstone of reducing transmission of \nrespiratory diseases such as COVlD-19. Additional information about social distancing, Including information on its use to \nreduce the spread of other viral illnesses, is available in this CDC publication \nStaff -In this document, \"staff' refers to all public sector employees as well as those working for a private contractor \nwithin a correctional facility (e.g., private healthcare or food service). Except where noted. ''staff' does not distinguish \nbetween healthcare, custody, and other types of staff including private facility operators. \nSymptoms- Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough. and shortness of brecth. Like other respiratory infections, \nCOVID-19 can vary in severity from mild to severe. When severe, pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death are possible. \nCOVID-19 is a novel disease, therefore the full range of signs and symptoms, the clinical course of the disease, and the \nindividuals and populations most at risk for disease and complications are not yet fully understood. Monitor the CDC \nwebsite for updates on these topics. \nFacilities with Limited Onsite Healthcare Services \nAlthough many large facilities such as prisons and some jails usually employ on site health care staff and have the capacity \nto evaluate incarcerated/detained persons for potential illness within a dedicated health care space, many smaller \nfacilities do not. Some of these facilities have access to on-call healthcare staff or providers who visit the facility every few \ndays. Others have neither onsite healthcare capacity nor onsite medical isolation/quarantine space and must transfer ill \npatients to other correctional or detention facilities or local hospitals for evaluation and care. \nThe majority of the guidance below is designed to be applied to any correctional or detention facility. either as written or \nwith modifications based on a facility's individual structure and resources. However, topics related to healthcare \nevaluation and clinical care of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases and their close contacts may not apply directly to \nfacilities with limited or no onsite healthcare services. It will be especially important for these types of facilities to \ncoordinate closely with their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health department when they encounter confirmed or \nsuspected cases among incarcerated/detained persons or staff. in order to ensure effective medical isolation and \nquarantine, necessary medical evaluation and care, and medrcal transfer if needed. The guidance makes note of \nstrategies tailored to facilities without onsite health care where possible. \n\nf\\Jote that all staff in any sized facility, regardless of the presence of onsite healthcare services, should observe guidance \non recommended PPE in order to ensure their own safety when interacting with confirmed and suspected COVID-'19 \ncases. Facilities should make contingency plans for the likely event of PPE shortages during the COVID-1 g pandemic. \nCOVID-19 Guidance for Correctional Facilities \nGuidance for correctional and detention facilities is organ1zed into 3 sections: Operational Preparedness, Prevention, and \nManagement of COVID-19. Recommendations across these sections can be applied simultaneously based on the \nprogress of the outbreak in a particular facility and the surrounding community. \n•  Operational Preparedness. This guidance is mtended to help facilities prepare for potential COVID-19 \ntransmission in the facility. Strategies focus on operational and communications planning and personnel practices. \n•  Prevention. This guidance is intended to help facilities prevent spread of COVID-19 from outside the facility to \ninside. Strategies focus on reinforcing hygiene practices, intensifying cleaning and disinfection of the facility, \nscreening (new intakes, visitors, and staff), continued communication with incarcerated/detained persons and staff, \nand social distancing measures (increasing distance between individuals). \n•  Management. This guidance is intended to help facilities clinically manage confirmed and suspected COVID-19 \ncases inside the facility and prevent further transmission. Strategies include medical isolation and care of \nIncarcerated/detained persons with symptoms (including considerations for cohorting), quarantine of cases' close \ncontacts. restricting movement in and out of the facility, infection control practices for individuals interacting with \ncases and quarantined contacts or contaminated items, intensified social distancing, and cleaning and disinfecting \nareas visited by cases. \nOperational Preparedness \nAdministrators can plan and prepare for COVID-19 by ensuring that all persons in the facility know the sympLorns of \nCOVID-19 and how to respond if they develop symptoms. Other essential actions include developing conlingency plans \nfor reduced workforces due to absences, coordinating with public health and correctional partners. and communicating \nclearly with staff and incarcerated/detained persons abouL these preparations and how they may temporarily alter dally \nlife. \nCommunication & Coordination \n•  Develop information-sharing systems with partners. \no  Identify pofnts of contact in relevant state. local, trlbal. and/or territorial public health departments before \ncases develop. Actively engage with the health department to understand in advance which entity has \njurisdiction to implement public health control measures for COVID-191n a particular correctional or detention \nfacility. \no  Create and test communications plans to disseminate critical information to incarcerated/detained persons, \nstaff, contracLors. vendors, and visitors as the pandemic progresses. \no  Communicate with other correctional facilities in the same geographic area to share information including \ndisease surveillance and absenteeism patterns among staff. \no  Where possible, put plans in place With other jurisdictions to prevent confirmed and suspected COVID·19 case5. \nand their close contaas from being transferred between jurisdictions and facilities unless necessary for \nmedical evaluation, medical isolation/quarantine, clinical care, extenuating security concerns, or to prevent \novercrowding. \no  Stay informed about updates to CDC guidance via the CDC COVID-19 website as more information becomes \n\nknown. \n•  Review existing pandemic nu, all-hazards. and disaster plans, and revise for COVID-19. \no  Ensure that phystcallocations (dedicated housing areas and bathrooms) have been identified to Isolate \nconfirmed COVl0-19 cases and individuals displaying COVID-19 symptoms, and to quarantine known dose \ncontacts of cases. (Medical isolation and quarantine locations should be separate). The plan should include \ncontmgenoes for multiple locations if numerous cases and/or contacts are identified and require medical \ntSolatton or quarantme simultaneously. See Medical Isolation and Quarantine sections below for details \nregardmg individual medical isolation and quarantine locations (preferred) vs. cohorting. \no  Facilittes Without onstte healthcare capac1ty should make a plan for how they will ensure that suspected COVID· \n19 cases will be isolated, evaluated, tested (if indicated), and provided necessary medical care. \no  Make a list of possible social distancing strategies that could be tmplemented as needed at different stages of \ntransmission intensity. \no  Designate officials who will be authorized to make decisions about escalating or de-escalating response efforts \nas the epidemiologic context changes. \n•  Coordinate with local law enforcement and court officials. \no  Identify lawful alternatives to in-person court appearances, such as virtual court, as a social distancing measure \nto reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. \no  Explore strategies to prevent over-crowding of correctional and detention facilities during a community \noutbreak. \n•  Post signage throughout the facility communicating the following: \no  For all: symptoms of COVID-19 and hand hygiene instructions \no  For incarcerated/detained persons: report symptoms to staff \no  For staff: stay at home when sick; if symptoms develop while on duty, leave the facility as soon as possible and \nfollow CDC recommended steps for persons who are ill w1th COVID-19 symptoms including self-isolating at \nhome, contacting their healthcare provider as soon as possible to determine whether they need to be \nevaluated and tested, and contacting their supervisor. \no  Ensure that signage is understandable for non-English speaking persons and those with low literacy, and make \nnecessary accommodations for those with cognitive or intellectual disabilities and those who are deaf, bltnd, or \nlow-vision. \nPersonnel Practices \n•  Review the sick leave policies of each employer that operates in the facility. \no  Review policies to ensure that they actively encourage staff to stay home when sick. \no  If these policies do not encourage staff to stay home when sick, discuss with the contract company. \no  Determine which officials will have the authority to send symptomatic staff home. \n•  Identify staff whose duties would allow them to work from home. Where possible, allowing staff to work \nfrom home can be an effective social distancing strategy to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. \no  Discuss work from home options with these staff and determine whether they have the supplies and \ntechnological equipment required to do so. \no  Put systems in place to implement work from home programs (e.g .. time tracking, etc.). \n•  Plan for staff absences. Staff should stay home when they are sick, or they may need to stay home to care for a \nsick household member or care for children in the event of school and childcare dismissals. \n\no  Allow staff to work from home when possible, within the scope of their duties. \no  Identify critical job funct1ons and plan for allernalive coverage by cross-training staff where possible. \no  Determine minimum levels of staff in all categories required for the facility to function safely. If possible, \ndevelop a plan to secure additional staff if absenteeism due to COVID-19 threatens to bring staffing to \nminimum levels. \no  Consider increasing keep on person (KOP) medication orders to cover 30 days in case of llealthcare staff \nshortages. \n•  Consider offering revised duties to staff who are at higher risk of severe illness with COVID-19. Persons \nat higher risk may include older adults and persons of any age with serious underlying medical conditions including \nlung disease, hearl disease. and d1abetes. See CDC's website for a complete list, and check regularly for updates as \nmore data become available to inform this issue. \no  Facility admtnistrators should consult with their occupational health providers to determine whether it would \nbe allowable to reassign duties for specific staff members to reduce their likelihood of exposure to COVID-19. \n•  Offer the seasonal influenza vaccine to all incarcerated/detained persons (existing population and new \nintakes) and staff throughout the influenza season. Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of influenza. \nPreventing influenza cases in a facility can speed the detection of COVID-19 cases and reduce pressure on \nhealthcare resources. \n•  Reference the Occupational Safety and Health Administration website [1  for recommendations \nregarding worker health. \n•  Review CDC's guidance for businesses and employers to identify any additronal strategies the facility can use \nwithin its role as an employer. \nOperations & Supplies \n•  Ensure that sufficient stocks of hygiene supplies, cleaning supplies, PPE. and medical supplies \n(consistent with the healthcare capabilities of the facility) are on hand and available, and have a plan in \nplace to restock as needed if COVID-19 transmission occurs within the facility. \no  Standard medical supplies for daily clinic needs \no  Tissues \no  Liquid soap when possible. If bar soap must be used, ensure that it does not irritate the skin and thereby \ndiscourage frequent hand washing. \no  Hand drying supplies \no  Alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol (where permissible based on security restrictions) \no  Cleaning supplies. including EPA-regts:ered drs1nfectants effewve against the vrrus :hat causes COVID-19 B \no  Recommended PPE (facemasks, N95 respirators, eye protection, disposable med1cal gloves, and disposable \ngowns/one-piece coveralls). See PPE section and Table 1 for more detailed tnformation. including \nrecommendations for extending the life of all PPE categories in the event of shortages. and when face masks \nare acceptable alternatives to N95s. Visit CDC's website for a calculator to help determine rate of PPE usage. \no  Sterile viral transport media and sterile swabs to collect nasophmy11g~al specimens if COVID-19 testing is \nindicated \n•  Make contingency plans for the probable event of PPE shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic, \nparticularly for non-healthcare workers. \no  See CDC guidance opt1mrzing PPI: supplies. \n\n•  Consider relaxing restrictions on allowing alcohol-based hand sanitizer in the secure setting where \nsecurity concerns allow. If soap and water are not available, CDC recommends cleaning hands with an alcohol· \nbased hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Consider allowing staff to carry individual-sized boltles for \ntheir personal hand hygiene while on duty. \n•  Provide a no-cost supply of soap to incarcerated/detained persons, sufficient to allow frequent hand \nwashing. (See Hygiene section below for additional detail regarding recommended frequency and protocol for hand \nwashing.) \no  Provide liquid soap where possrble. If bar soap must be used, ensur·e that it does not irritate the skin and \nthereby discourage frequent hand washing. \n•  If not already in place, employers operating within the facility should establish a respiratory protection \nprogram as appropriate, to ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons are fit tested for any \nrespiratory protection they will need wrthin the scope of their responsibilities. \n•  Ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons are trained to correctly don, doff, and dispose of \nPPE that they will need to use within the scope of their responsibilrties. See Table 1 for recommended PPE \nfor incarcerated/detained persons and staff with varying levels of contact with COVID-19 cases or their close \ncontacts. \nPrevention \nCases of COVID-19 have been documented in all 50 US states. Correctional and detention facilities can prevent \nintroduction of COVID-19 from the community and reduce transmission if it is already inside by reinforcing good hygiene \npractices among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, and visitors (including increasing access to soap and paper towels), \nintensifying cleaning/disinfection practices, and implementing social distancing strategies. \nBecause many individuals infected wfth COVID-19 do not display symptoms, the virus could be present in facilities before \ncases are identified. Both good hygiene practices and sodal distandng are critical in preventing further transmission. \nOperations \n•  Stay in communication wilh partners about your facility's current situation. \no  State, local, territorial, and/or tribal health departments \no  Other correctional facilities \n•  Communicate with the public about any changes to facility operations, including visitation programs. \n•  Restrict transfers of incarcerated/detained persons to and from other jurisdictions and facilities unless \nnecessary for medical evaluation, medical isolation/quarantine, clinical care, extenuating security \nconcerns, or to prevent overcrowding. \no  Strongly consider postponing non-urgent outside medical visits. \no  If a transfer is absolutely necessary, perform verbal screening and a temperature check as outlined in the \nScreening section below, before the individual leaves the facility. If an individual does not clear the screening \nprocess, delay the transfer and follow the protocol for a suspected COVID-19 case-including putting a face \nmask on the individual, immediately placing them under medical isolation, and evaluating them for possible \nCOVID-19 testing. If the transfer must still occur, ensure that the receiving facility has capacity to prope1·1y \nisolate the individual upon arrival. Ensure that staff transporting the individual wear recommended PPE (see \nTable 1) and that the transport vehicle is cleaned thoroughly after transport. \n•  Implement lawful alternatives to in-person court appearances where permissible. \n\n•  Where relevant, consider suspending co-pays for incarcerated/detained persons seeking medical \nevaluation for respiratory symptoms. \n•  Limit the number of operational entrances and exjts to the facility. \nCleaning and Disinfecting Practices \n•  Even if COVID-19 cases have not yet been identified inside the facility or in the surrounding community, \nbegin implementing intensified cleaning and disinfecling procedures according to lhe \nrecommendations below. These measures may prevent spread of COVID-19 if introduced. \n•  Adhere to CDC recommendations for cleaning and disinfection during the COVID-19 response. Monitor \nthese recommendations for updates. \no  Several times per day, clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched, especially in \ncommon areas. Such surfaces may include objects/surfaces not ordinarily cleaned dally (e.g., doorknobs, light \nswitches, sink handles, countertops, toilets~ toilet handles, recreation equipment, kiosks, and telephones). \no  Staff should clean shared equipment several times per day and on a conclusion of use basis (e.g., radios, \nservice weapons, keys, handcuffs). \no  Use household cleaners and EPA-registered dls1nfectants effective against the virus that causes COVID-19 13 \nas appropriate for the surface, following label instructions. This may require lifting restrictions on undiluted \ndisinfectants. \no  Labels contain instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product. including precautions that should \nbe taken when applying the product} such as wearing gloves and making sure there is good ventilation during \nuse. \n•  Consider increasing the number of staff and/or incarcerated/detained persons trained and responsible \nfor cleaning common areas to ensure continual cleaning of these areas throughout the day. \n•  Ensure adequate supplies to support intensified cleaning and disinfection practices, and have a plan in \nplace to restock rapidly if needed. \nHygiene \n•  Reinforce healthy hygiene practices, and provide and continually restock hygiene supplies throughout \nthe facility, including in bathrooms, food preparation and dining areas, intake areas. visitor entries and \nexits, visitation rooms and waiting rooms, common areas, medical. and staff-restricted areas (e.g., \nbreak rooms). \n•  Encourage all persons in the facility to take the following actions to protect themselves and others from \nCOVID-19. Post signage throughout the facility, and communicate this information verbally on a regular \nbasis. Sample signage and other communications materials are available on the CDC website. Ensure \nthat materials can be understood by non-English speakers and those with low literacy, and make necessary \naccommodations for those with cognitive or intellectual disabilities and those who are deaf, blind. or low-vision. \no  Practice good cough etiquette: Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow (or ideally with a tissue) rather \nthan with your hand when you cough or sneeze, and throw all tissues in the trash immediately after use. \no  Practice good hand hygiene: Regularly wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, \nespecially after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose; after using the bathroom; before eating or preparing \nfood; before taking medication; and after touching garbage. \no  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth without cleaning your hands first. \no  Avoid sharing eating utensils, dishes, and cups. \no  Avoid non-essential physical contact. \n\n•  Provide incarcerated/detained persons and staff no-cost access to: \no  Soap - Provide liquid soap where possible. If bar soap must be used, ensure that it does not irritate the skin, as \nthis would discourage frequent hand washing. \no  Running water, and hand drying machines or disposable paper towels for hand washing \no  Tissues and no-touch trash receptacles for disposal \n•  Provide alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol where permissible based on security \nrestrictions. Consider allowing staff to carry individual-sized bottles to rnainta1n hand hygiene. \n•  Communicate that sharing drugs and drug preparation equipment can spread COVID-19 due to \npotential contamination of shared items and close contact between individuals. \nPrevention Practices for Incarcerated/Detained Persons \n•  Perform pre-intake screening and temperature checks for all new entrants. Screening should take place \nin the sallyport, before beginning the intake process, in order to identify and immediately place individuals \nwith symptoms under medical isolation. See Screening section below for the wording of screening questions and a \nrecommended procedure to safely perform a temperature check. Staff performing temperature checks should wear \nrecommended PPE (see PPE section below). \no  If an individual has symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath): \n•  Require the individual to wear a face mask. \n•  Ensure that staff who have direct contact with the symptomatic individual wear recommended PPE. \n•  Place the individual under medical isolation (ideally in a room near the screening location, rather than \ntransporting the ill individual through the facility), and refer to health care staff for further evaluation. (See \nInfection Control and Clinical Care sections below.) \n•  Facilities without onsite healthcare staff should contact their state, local, tribal. and/or territorial health \ndepartment to coordinate effective medical isolation and necessary medical care. \no  If an individual is a close conLact of a known COVID-19 case (but has no COVID-19 symptoms): \n•  Quarantine the individual and monitor for symptoms two times per day for 14 days. (See \nQuarantine section below.) \n•  Facilities without onsite healthcare staff should contact their state, local. tribal, and/or territorial heallh \ndepartment to coordinate effective quarantine and necessary medical care. \n•  Implement social distancing strategies to increase the physical space between incarcerated/detained persons \n(ideally 6 feet between all individuals, regardless of the presence of symptoms). Strategies will need to be tailored to \nthe individual space in the facility and the needs of the population and staff. Not all strategies will be feasible in all \nfacilities. Example strategies with varying levels of intensity include: \no  Common areas: \n•  Enforce increased space between individuals In holding cells, as well as in lines and wailing areas such as \nintake (e.g .. remove every other chair in a waiting area) \no  Recreation: \n•  Choose recreation spaces where individuals can spread out \n•  Stagger time in recreation spaces \n•  Restrict recreation space usage to a single housing unit per space \n(where feasible) \no  Meals: \n•  Stagger meals \n•  Rearrange seating in the dining hall so that there is more space between individuals (e.g., remove every \nother chair and use only one side of the table) \n\n•  Provlde meals inside housing uni\"Ls or cells \no  Group activities: \n•  Limit the size of group activities \n•  Increase space between individuals during group activities \n•  Suspend group programs where participants are likely to be in closer contact than they are in their \nhousing environment \n•  Consider alternatives to existing group activities, in outdoor areas or other areas where individuals can \nspread out \no  Housing: \n•  If space allows, reassign bunks to provide more space between individuals, Ideally 6 feet or more in all \ndirections. (Ensure that bunks are cleaned thoroughly if assigned to a new occupant.) \n•  Arrange bunks so that individuals sleep head to foot to increase the distance between them \n•  Rearrange scheduled movements to minimize mixing of individuals from different housing areas \no  Medical: \n•  If possible, designate a room near each housing unit to evaluate individuals with COVID-19 symptoms, \nrather than having them walk through the facility to be evaluated in the medical unit. If this is not feasible, \nconsider staggering sick call. \n•  Designate a room near the intake area to evaluate new entrants who are flagged by the intake screening \nprocess for COVID·19 symptoms or case contact before they move to other parts of the facility. \n•  Communicate clearly and frequently with incarcerated/detained persons about changes to their daily \nroutine and how they can contribute to risk reduction. \n•  Note that if group activities are discontinued. it will be important to identify alternative forms of \nactivity to support the mental health of incarcerated/detained persons. \n•  Consider suspending work release programs and other programs that involve movement of \nincarcerated/detained individuals in and out of the facility. \n•  Provide up~to-date information about COVID-19 to incarcerated/detained persons on a regular basis, \nincluding: \no  symptoms of COVID-19 and its health risks \no  Reminders to report COVID-19 symptoms to staff at the first sign of illness \n•  Consider having healthcare staff perform rounds on a regular basis to answer questions about COVID-\n19. \nPrevention Practices for Staff \n•  Remind staff to stay at home if they are sick. Ensure that staff are aware that they will not be able to enter the \nfacility rf they have symptoms of COVID-19, and that they will be expected to leave the facility as soon as possible if \nthey develop symptoms while on duty. \n•  Perform verbal screening (for COVI0-19 symptoms and close contact with cases) and temperature \nchecks for all staff daily on entry. See Screening section below for wording of scr'eening questions and a \nrecommended procedure to safely perform temperature checks. \no  In very small facilities with only a few staff, consider self-monitoring or virtual monitoring (e.g., reporting to a \ncentral authority via phone). \no  Send staff home who do not clear the screening process, and advise them to follow CDC-recommended steps \nfor persons who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms. \n\n•  Provide staff with up-to-date information about COVID-19 and about facility policies on a regular basis, \nincluding: \no  symptoms of COVlD-1 9 and its health nsks \no  Employers' sick leave policy \no  If staff develop a fever, cough, or shortness of breath while at work: immediately put on a face mask. \ninform supervisor, leave the facility, and follow CDC-recommended steps for persons who are ill w1th COVID-19 \nsymptoms. \no  If staff test positive for CO VI D-19: inform workplace and personal contacts immediately, and do not return \nto work unlll a dec1s1on to discontinue home medical isolation precautions is made. Monitor CDC guidance on \ndiscontmuing home 1sola~ion regularly as circumstances evolve rapidly. \no  If a staff member is identified as a close contact of a COVI0-19 case (either within the facility or in \nthe community): self-quarantine at home for 14 days and return to work If symptoms do not develop. If \nsymptoms do develop, follow CDC-recommended steps for persons who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms. \n•  If a start member has a confirmed COVID-19 infection, the relevant employers should inform other staff \nabout their possible exposure to COVI0-19 in the workplace, but should maintain confidentiality as \nrequired by the Americans with Disabilities Act. \no  Employees who are close contacts of the case should then self-monitor for symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, or \nshortness of breath). \n•  When feasible and consistent with security priorities. encourage staff to maintain a distance of 6 feet or \nmore from an individual with respiratory symptoms while interviewing, escorting, or interacting in \nother ways. \n•  Ask staff to keep interactions with individuals with respiratory symptoms as brief as possible. \nPrevention Practices for Visitors \n•  If possible, communicate with potential visitors to discourage contact visits in the interest of their own \nhealth and the health of their family members and friends inside the facility. \n•  Perform verbal screening (for COVID-19 symptoms and close contact with cases) and temperature \nchecks for all visitors and volunteers on entry. See Screening section below for wording of screening questions \nand a recommended procedure to safely perform temperature checks. \no  Staff performing temperature checks should wear recommended PPE. \no  Exclude visitors and volunteers who do not clear the screening process or who decline screening. \n•  Provide alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol in visitor entrances, exits, and waiting \nareas. \n•  Provide visitors and volunteers with information to prepare them for screening. \no  Instruct visitors to postpone their visit if they have symptoms of respiratory 1llness. \no  If possible, inform potential visitors and volunteers before they travel to the facility that they should expea to \nbe screened for COVID-19 (Including a temperature check), and will be unable to enter the facility if they do not \nclear the screening process or if t:hey decline screening. \no  Display signage outside visiting areas explaining the COVlD-19 screening and temperature check process. \nEnsure that materials are understandable for non-English speakers and those with low literacy. \n•  Promote non-contact visits: \no  Encourage incarcerated/detained persons to limit contact visils in the inlerest of their own health and the \nhealth of their visitors. \no  Consider reducing or temporarily eliminating the cost of phone calls for Incarcerated/detained persons. \n\no  Consider increasing incarcerated/detained persons· telephone privileges to promote mental health and reduce \nexposure from direct contact with community visitors. \n•  Consider suspending or modifying visitation programs, if legally permissible. For example, provide \naccess to virtual visitation options where available. \no  If moving to virtual visitation, clean electronic surfaces regularly. (See Clearing guidance below for instructions \non cleaning electronic surfaces.) \no  Inform potential visitors of changes to. or suspension of, visitatton programs. \no  Clearly communicate any visitation program changes to incarcerated/detained persons, along with the reasons \nfor them {including protecting their health and their family and community members' health). \no  If suspending contact vtslts, provide alternate means (e.g., phone or video visitation) for Incarcerated/detained \ntndivtduals to engage with legal representatives, clergy, and other individuals with whom they have legal right \nto consult. \nNOTE: Suspending visitation would be done in the interest of incarcerated/detained persons' physical health and the \nhealth of the general public. However, visitation is important to maintain mental health. If visitation is suspended. \nfacilities should explore alternative ways for incarcerated/detained persons to communicate with their families, friends, \nand other visitors in a way that is not financially burdensome for them. See above suggestions for pr'omoting non-contact \nvisits. \n•  Restrict non-essential vendors. volunteers. and tours from entering the facility. \nManagement \nIf there has been a suspected COVID·19 case inside the facility (among incarcerated/detained persons. staff. or visitors \nwho have recently been inside), begin implementing Milnagement strategies while test results are pending. Essential \nManagement strategies include placing cases and individuals with symptoms under medical isolation, quarantining their \nclose contaas. and factlitating necessary medical care, while observing relevant infection control and environmental \ndisinfection protocols and wearing recommended PPE. \nOperations \n•  Implement alternate work arrangements deemed feasible in the Operational Preparedness \n•  Suspend all transfers of incarcerated/detained persons to and from other jurisdictions and facilities \n(including work release where relevant), unless necessary for medical evaluation. medical \nisolation/quarantine, care, extenuating security concerns, or to prevent overcrowding. \no  If a transfer is absolutely necessaty, perform verbal screening and a temperature check as outlined in the \nScreening section below, before the individual leaves the facility. If an individual does not clear the screening \nprocess, delay the transfer and follow the protocol for a suspected COVID-19 co~e- including putting a face \nmask on the individual, immediately placing them under medical isolation, and evaluating them for possible \nCOVID-19 testing. If the trcJnsfer must still occur, ensure that the re1:eiving facility has capacity to appropriately \nisolate the individual upon arrival. Ensure that staff transporting the individual wear recommended PPE (see \nTable 1) and that the transport vehicle is cleaned thoroughly after transport. \n•  If possible, consider quarantining all new intakes for 14 days before they enter the facility's general \npopulation (SEPARATELY from other individuals who are quarantined due to contact with a COVID-19 \ncase). Subsequently in this document, this practice is referred to as routine intake quarantine. \n•  When possible, arrange lawful alternatives to in-person court appearances. \n•  Incorporate screening for COVID-19 symptoms and a temperature check into release planning. \n\no  Screen all releasing individU<Jis for COVID-1 C) symptoms and perform a temperature check. (See \nScreening section below.) \n•  If an individual does not clear the screening p1o cess, follow the protocol for a suspected COVID-19 case -\nincluding putting a face mask on the individual, immediately placing them under medical isolation, and \nevaluating them for possible COVID-19 testing. \n•  If the Individual is released before the recommended medical isolation period is complete, discuss release \nof the indiVIdual with state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health departments to ensure safe medical \ntransport and continued shelter and medical care, as part of release planning. Make direct linkages to \ncommunity resources to ensure proper medical isolation and access to medical care. \n•  Before releasing an incarcerated/detained lndiv1dual w1th CO VI 0-19 symptoms to a community-based \nfacility, such as a homeless shelter. contact the facility's staff w ensure adequate time for them to prepare \nto continue medical isolation, or contact local public health to explore alternate housing options. \n•  Coordmate with state, local, mbal, and/or territorial heClltll departments. 13 \no  When a COVID-19 case is suspected, work with public health to determine action. See Medical Isolation section \nbelow. \no  When a COVID-19 case is suspected or confirmed, work with public health to identify close contacts who should \nbe placed under quarantine. See Quaran:ine section below. \no  Facilities wilh limited ons1te medical isolation, quarantine, and/or healthcare services should coordinate closely \nwith state. local. tnbal. and/or territorial health departments when they encounter a confirmed or suspected \ncase, in order to ensure effective medical isolation or quarantine, necessary medical evaluation and care, and \nmedical transfer if needed. See Facilities with Limited Onslte Healthcare Services section. \nHygiene \n•  Continue to ensure that hand hygiene supplies are well-stocked in all areas of the facility. (See above.} \n•  Continue to emphasize practicing good hand hygiene and cough etiquette. (See above.) \nCleaning and Disinfecting Practices \n•  Continue adhering to recommended cleaning and disinfection procedures for Lhe facility at large. (See \nabove.) \n•  Reference specific cleaning and disinfection procedures for areas where a COVID-19 case has spent \ntime (below}. \nMedical Isolation of Confirmed or Suspected COVID-19 Cases \nNOTE: Some recommendations below apply primarily to facilities with onsite healthcare capacity. Facilities \nwithout onsite healthcare capacity, or without sufficient space to implement effective medical isolation, \nshould coordinate with local public health officials to ensure that COVID-19 cases will be appropriately \nisolated, evaluated, tested (if indicated), and given care. \n•  As soon as an individual develops symptoms of COVID-19, they should wear a face mask (if it does nol \nrestrict breathing) and should be immediately placed under medical isolation in a separate \nenvironment from other individuals. \n•  Keep the individual's movement outside the medical isolation space to an absolute minimum. \no  Provide medical care to cases inside the medical isolation space. See Infection Control and Clinical \nCare sections for additional details. \n\no  Serve meals to cases inside the medical isolation space. \no  Exclude the individual from all group activities. \no  Assign the isolated individual a dedicated bathroom when possible. \n•  Ensure that the individual is wearing a face mask at all times when outside of the medical isolation \nspace, and whenever another individual enters. Provide clean masks as needed. Masks should be changed ar \nleast da1ly, and when visibly so1led or wet \n•  Facilities should make every possible effort to place suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases under \nmedical isolation individually. Each isolated individual should be assigned their own housing space and \nbathroom where possible. Corortmg should only be practiced if there are no other available options. \no  If cohorting IS necessary: \n•  Only individuals who are laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases should be placed under \nmedical isolation as a cohort. Do not cohort confirmed cases with suspected cases or case \ncontacts. \n•  Unless no other options exist, do not house COVID-19 cases with individuals who have an undiagnosed \nrespiratory infection. \n•  Ensure thal cohorted cases wear face masks at all times. \no  In order of preference. individuals under medical isolation should be housed: \n•  Separately, in single cells with solid walls (i.e .• not bars) and solid doors that close fully \n•  Separately, In single cells with solid walls but without solid doors \n•  As a cohort. in a large, well-ventilated cell with solid walls and a solid door that closes fully. Employ social \ndistancing strateg1es related to housing in the Prevention section above. \n•  As a cohort, m a large. well-ventilated cell with solid walls but without a solid door. Employ soc1al \nd1stanc1ng strategies related to housing in the Prevention section above. \n•  As a cohort, in single cells without solid walls or solid doors (i.e., cells enclosed entirely with bars), \npreferably With an empty cell between occupied cells. (Although individuals are in single cells in this \nscenario, the airflow between cells essentially makes it a cohort arrangement in the context of COVID-19.) \n•  As a cohort. in mulli-person cells without solid walls or solid doors (I.e., cells enclosed entirely with bars), \npreferably with an empty cell between occupied cells. Employ social distancing strategies related to \nhousmg in lhe Prevention section above. \n•  Safely transfer' individual(s) to another facility with available medical isola lion capacity in one of the above \n.;rrangements \n(NOTE- Transfer should be avoided due to the potenw:~l to introduce Infection to another facility; proceed \nonly If no other options are available.) \nIf the ideal choiCe does not exist in a facility. use the nex1: best alternative. \n•  If the number of confirmed cases exceeds the number of individual medical isolation spaces available \nin the facility, be especially mindfu I of cases who arc at higher risk of severe illness from CO VI D-1 9. \nIdeally, they should not be cohorted with other infected individuals. If cohortlng is unavoidable, make all possible \naccommodations to prevent transmission of other infeaious diseases to the higher-risk individual. (For example. \nallocate more space for a higher-risk individual within a shared medical Isolation space.) \no  Persons at higher nsk may include older adults and persons of any age with serious underlying medical \nconditions such as lung disease, heart disease, and diabetes. See CDC's website for a complete list, and check \nregularly for updates as more data become available to i11form this issue. \no  Note that incarcerated/detained populations have higher prevalence of infectious and chronic diseases and are \nin poorer health than the general population, even at younger ages. \n\n•  Custody staff should be designated to monitor these individuals exclusively where possible. These staff \nshould wear recommended PPE as appropriate for their level of contact wtth the indiVidual under medical isolation \n(see PPE section below) and should limit their own movement between different parts of the facility to the extent \npossible. \n•  Minimize transfer of COVID-19 cases between spaces within the healthcare unit. \n•  Provide individuals under medical isolation with tissues and, if permissible, a lined no-touch trash \nreceptacle. Instruct them to: \no  Cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when they cough or sneeze \no  Dispose of used tissues immediately in Lhe lined trash receptacle \no  Wash hands immediately with soap and waLer for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, \nclean hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol (where security concerns \npermit). Ensure that hand washing supplies are continually restocked. \n•  Maintain medical isolation until all the following criteria have been met. Monitor the CDC website for \nupdates to these criteria. \no  For individuals who will be tested to determine if they are still contagious: \n•  The individual has been free from fever for at least 72 hours without the use of fever-reducing \nmedications AND \n•  The individual's other symptoms have improved (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) AND \n•  The individual has tested negative in at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24 \nhours apart \no  For individuals who will NOT be tested to determine if they are still contagious: \n•  The individual has been free from fever for at least 72 hours without the use of fever-reducing \nmedications AND \n•  The individual's other symptoms have improved (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) AND \n•  At least 7 days have passed smce the first symptoms appeared \no  For individuals who had a confirmed positive COVID-19 test but never showed symptoms: \n•  At least 7 days have passed since the date of the individual's first pos1t1ve COVID-19 test AND \n•  The Individual has had no subsequent illness \n•  Restrict cases from leaving Lhe facility while under medical isolation precautions, unless released from \ncustody or if a transrer is necessary for medical care, infection control, lack of medical isolation space, \nor extenuating security concerns. \no  If an incarcerated/detained tndividual who is a COVID-19 case is released from custody during their medical \nisolation period, contact public health to arrange for safe transport and continuation of necessary medical care \nand medical isolation as part of release planning. \nCleaning Spaces where COVID-19 Cases Spent Time \n•  Thoroughly clean and disinfect all areas where the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case spent time. \nNote - these protocols apply to suspected cases as well as confirmed cases, to ensure adequate \ndisinfection in the event that the suspected case does, in fact, have COVID-19. Refer to the Definitions \nsection for the distinction between confirmed and suspected cases. \no  Close off areas used by the infected individual. If possible, open outside doors and windows to Increase air \ncirculation in the area. Wait as long as practical. up to 24 hours under the poorest air exchange conditions \n(consult CDC Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control ifl Health-Care FaCilities for wait t1me based on \ndifferent ventilution conditions), before beginning to clean and disinfect, to minimize potential for exposure to \nt·espiratoly droplets. \n\no  Clean and disinfect all areas (e.g., cells. bathrooms, and common areas) used by the infected individual, \nfocusing especially on frequently touched surfaces (see list above in Prevention seclton). \n•  Hard (non-porous} surface cleaning and disinfection \no  If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior m dismfect1on. \no  For disinfection, most common EPA-registered household distnfectants should be effective. Choose cleaning \nproducts based on security requirements within the facility. \n•  Consult a list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the vints that causes COVID-19 ~ . Follow \nthe manufacturer's instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration. application \nmethod and contact time, etc.). \n•  Diluted household bleach solutions can be used if appropriate for the surface. Follow the manufacturer's \ninstructions for applicatton and proper vemilatton, and check to ensure the product is not past its \nexpiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Unexpired household \nbleach will be effecttve agamst coronaviruses when properly diluted. Prepare a bleach solution by mixing: \n•  5 tablespoons ( 113rd cup) bleach per gallon of water or \n~  4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water \n•  Soft (porous) surface cleaning and disinfection \no  For soft (porous) surfaces such as carpeted floors and rugs, remove visible contamination if present and clean \nwith appropriate cleaners indicated for use on these surfaces. After cleaning: \n•  If the items can be laundered, launder items in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions using the \nwarmest appropnate water setting for the items and then dry items completely. \n•  Otherwise, use products that are EPA-approved for use against Ihe virus that causes COVlD-19 B  and are \nsuitable for porous surfaces. \n•  Electronics cleaning and disinfection \no  For electronics such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, and remote controls, remove visible contamination If \npresent. \n•  Follow the manufacturer's instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. \n•  Consider use ofwipeable covers for electronics. \n•  If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or spray containing at \nleast 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids. \nAdditional information on cleaning and disinfection of communal facilities such can be found on CDC's website. \n•  Ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons performing cleaning wear recommended PPE. (See \nPPE section below.) \n•  Food service items. Cases under medical isolation should throw disposable food service items in the trash in their \nmedical Isolation room. Non-disposable food service items should be handled with gloves and washed with hot \nwater or in a dtshwasher. Individuals handling used food service items should clean the1r hands after removing \ngloves. \n•  Laundry from a COVID-19 cases can be washed with other individuals' laundry. \no  Individuals handling laundry from COVID-19 cases should wear disposable gloves, discard after each use, and \nclean their hands after. \no  Do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air. \no  Launder items as appropnate in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. If possible, launder items \nusing the warmest appropriate water setting for the 1tems and dry items completely. \no  Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. If permissible, consider using a \nbag liner that is either disposable or can be laundered. \n\n•  Consult cleaning recommendations above to ensure that transport vehicles are thoroughly cleaned \nafter carrying a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case. \nQuarantining Close Contacts of COVID-19 Cases \nNOTE: Some recommendations below apply primarily to facilities with onsite healthcare capacity. Facilities \nwithout onsite healthcare capacity, or without sufficient space to implement effective quarantine, should \ncoordinate with local public health officials to ensure that close contacts of COVID-19 cases will be \neffectively quarantined and medically monitored. \n•  Incarcerated/detained persons who are close contacts of a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case \n(whether the case Is another incarcerated/detained person, start member, or visitor) should be placed \nunder quarantine for 14 days (see CDC guidelines). \no  If an individual is quarantined due to contact with a suspected case who is subsequently tested for COVI D-19 \nand receives a negative result, the quarantined individual should be released from quarantine restrictions. \n•  In the context of COVID-19, an individual (incarcerated/detained person or staff) is considered a close \ncontact if they: \no  Have been within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of t1me OR \no  Have had direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., have been coughed on) \nClose contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a common space with a COVID-19 case. Data to \ninform the definition of close contact are limited. Considerations when assessing close contact include rhe duration of \nexposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely Increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-\n19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk, as does exposure to a severely ill patient). \n•  Keep a quarantined individual's movement outside the quarantine space to an absolute minimum. \no  Provtde medtcal evaluation and care inside or near the quarantine space when possible. \no  Serve meals inside the quarantine space, \no  Exclude the quarantined individual from all group activities. \no  Assign the quarantined individual a dedicated bathroom when possible. \n•  Facilities should make every possible effort to quarantine close contacts of COVID-19 cases individually. \nCohorllng multiple quarantined close contacts of a COVID·19 case could transmit COVID-19 from those who are \ninfected to those who are uninfeaed. Cohorting should only be practiced if there are no other available options. \no  If cohortmg of close contacts under quarantine Is absolutely necessary, symptoms of all individuals should be \nmonitored closely, and individuals with symptoms of COVID-19 should be placed under medical isolation \no  If an enure housmg un1t 1s under quarantine due to contact with a case from the same housing unit. the entire \nhousmg untt may need to be treated as a cohort and quarantine in place. \no  Some facilities may choose to quarantine all new intakes for 14 days before moving them to the facility's \ngeneral population as a general rule (not because they were exposed to a COVID-19 case). Under this scenario, \navoid mixing individuals quarantined due to exposure to a COVID-19 case with individuals undergoing rourine \nintake quarantine. \no  If at all possible, do not add more individuals to an existing quarantine cohort after the 14-day quarantine clock \nhas started. \n•  If the number of quarantined individuals exceeds the number of individual quarantine spaces available \nin the facility, be especially mindful of those who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. \nIdeally, they should not be cohorted with other quarantined Individuals. If cohorting is unavoidable, make all \npossible accommodations to reduce exposure risk for the higher-risk Individuals. (For example, intensify social \n\ndistancmg stroteg1es for higher-risk individuals.) \n•  In order of preference. multiple quarantined individuals should be housed: \no  Separately, in single cells with solid walls (i.e., not bars) and solid doors that dose fully \no  Separately, m single cells With solid walls but without solid doors \no  As a cohort. in a large. well-ventilated cell wilh solid walls, a solid door that closes fully, and at least 6 feet of \npersonal space assigned to each individual in all directions \no  As a cohort, in a large. well-ventilated cell wilh solrd walls and at least 6 feet of personal space assigned to each \nindividual in all directions, but without a solid door \no  As a cohort, in single cells without solid walls or solid doors (i.e., cells enclosed entirely with bars), preferably \nwith an empty cell between occupied cells creating at least 6 feet of space between individuals. (Although \nindividuals are in single cells in this scenario, the airflow between cells essentially makes It a cohort \narrangement in the context of COVID-19.) \no  As a cohort, in multi-person cells without solid walls or solid doors (i.e., cells enclosed entirely with bars), \npreferably with an empty cell between occupied cells. Employ social dis{ancing strategies related to housing 1n \nthe Prevention section to maintain al least 6 feet of space between individuals housed in the same cell. \no  As a cohort, in individuals' regularly assigned housing unit but with no movement outside the Unit (If an entire \nhousing unit has been exposed). Employ social d1stanc.ing strategies related to housing In the Prevention \nsecrion above to maintain at least 6 feer of space between 1nd1viduals. \no  Safely transfer to another facility with capacity to quarantine in one of the above arrangements \n(NOTE-Transfer should be avoided due to the potential to introduce infection to another facility; proceed only \nif no other options are available.) \n•  Quarantined individuals should wear face masks if feasible based on local supply, as source control, \nunder the following circumstances (see PPE section and Table 1) : \no  If cohorted, quarantined individuals should wear face masks at all times (to prevent transmission from infected \nto uninfected individuals). \no  If quarantrned separately, individuals should wear face masks whenever a non-quarantined individual enters \nthe quarantine space. \no  All quarantined Individuals should wear a face mask if they must leave the quarantine space for any reason. \no  Asymptomatic individuals under routine ir1take quarantine (with no known exposure to a COVID-19 case) do \nnot need to wear face masks. \n•  Staff who have close contact with quarantined individuals should wear recommended PPE if feasible \nbased on local supply, feasibility, and safety within the scope of their duties (see PPE sectron and Table 1) . \no  Staff supervising asymptomatic incarcerated/detained persons under routine 1nLake quarant1ne (with no known \nexposure to a COVID-19 case) do not need to wear PPE. \n•  Quarantined individuals should be monitored for COVID-19 symptoms twice per day, including \ntemperature checks. \no  If an individual develops symptoms, they should be moved to medical isolation immediately and further \nevaluated. (See Medical Isolation section above.) \no  See Screening section for a procedure to perform temperature checks safely on asymptomatic close contacts of \nCOVID-19 cases. \n•  If an individual who is part of a quarantined cohort becomes symptomatic: \no  If the individual is tested for COVID-19 and tests positive: the 14-day quarantine clock for the rernainder \nof the cohort must be reset to 0. \no  If the individual is tested for COVID-19 and tests negative: the 14-day quarantine clock for this individual \nand the remainder of the cohort does not need to be reset. This individual can return from medical isolation lo \n\nthe quarantined cohort for the remainder of the quarantine period. \no  If the individual is not tested for COVID-19: the 14-day quarantine clock for the remainder of the cohort \nmust be reset to 0. \n•  Restrict quarantined individuals from leaving the facility (including transfers to other facilities) during \nthe 14-day quarantine period, unless released from custody or a transfer is necessary for medical care, \ninfection control, lack of quarantine space, or extenuating security concerns. \n•  Quarantined individuals can be released from quarantine restrictions if they have not developed \nsymptoms during the 14-day quarantine period. \n•  Meals should be provided to quarantined individuals in their quarantine spaces. Individuals under \nquarantine should throw disposable food service ttems in the trash. Non-disposable food service items should be \nhandled with gloves and washed with hot water or in a dishwasher. Individuals handling used food service items \nshould clean their hands after removing gloves. \n•  laundry from quarantined individuals can be washed with other individuals' laundry. \no  Individuals handling laundry from quarantined persons should wear disposable gloves, discard after each use, \nand clean their hands afLer. \no  Do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the ai1. \no  Launder Items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. If possible, launder items \nusing the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. \no  Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. If perm1ssible. consider using a \nbag liner that is either disposable or can be laundered. \nManagement of Incarcerated/Detained Persons with COVID-19 \nSymptoms \nNOTE: Some recommendations below apply primarily to facilities with onsite healthcare capacity. Facilities \nwithout onsite healthcare capacity or without sufficient space for medical isolation should coordinate with \nlocal public health officials to ensure that suspected COVID-19 cases will be effectively isolated, evaluated, \ntested (if indicated), and given care._ \n•  If possible, designate a room near each housing unit for healthcare staff to evaluate individuals with \nCOVID-19 symptoms, rather than having them walk through the facility to be evaluated in the medical \nunit. \n•  Incarcerated/detained individuals with COVID-19 symptoms should wear a race mask and should be \nplaced under medical isolation immediately. Discontinue the use of a face mask if it inhibits breathing. \nSee Medical Isolation section above. \n•  Medical staff should evaluate symptomatic individuals to determine whether COVID-19 testing is \nindicated. Refer to CDC guidelines for information on evvluation and testing. See Infection Control and Clinical \nCare sections below as well. \n•  If testing is indicated (or if medical staff need clarification on when testing is indicated}, contact the \nstate, local. tribaL and/or territorial health department. Work with public health or private labs as \navailable to access testing supplies or services. \no  lr the COVID-19 test is positive, cont1nue medical isolation. (See Medical lsolat1on section above.) \no  If the COVID-19 test is negat1ve, return the individUal to their prior housing assignment unless they require \nfurther medical assessment or care. \n\nManagement Strategies for Incarcerated/Detained Persons without \nCOVID-19 Symptoms \n•  Provide clear information to incarcerated/detained persons about the presence of COVID-19 cases \nwithin the facility, and the need to increase social distancing and mainlain hygiene precautions. \no  Consider having healthcare staff perform regular rounds to answer questions aboul COVID-19. \no  Ensure that information is provided in a manner that can be understood by non-English speaking individuals \nand those with low literacy, and make necessary accommodations for those with cognitive or intellectual \nd1sab11ities and those who are deaf, blind, or low-vision. \n•  Implement daily temperature checks in housing units where COVID-19 cases have been identified, \nespecially if there is concern Lhal incarcerated/detained individuals are not notifying staff of \nsymptoms.See Screenmg section for a procedure to safely perform a temperature check. \n•  Consider additional options to intensify social distancing within the facility. \nManagement Strategies for Staff \n•  Provide clear information to staff about the presence of COVID-19 cases within Lhe facility, and the \nneed to enforce social distancing and encourage hygiene precautions. \no  Consider having healthcare staff perform regular rounds to answer questions about COVID-19 from staff. \n•  Staff identified as close contacts of a COVID-19 case should self-quarantine at home for 14 days and \nmay return to work if symptoms do not develop. \no  See above for definition of a close contact. \no  Refer to CDC guidelines for further recommendations regarding home quarantine for staff. \nInfection Control \nInfection control guidance below is applicable to all types of correctional facilities. Individual facilities \nshould assess their unique needs based on the types of exposure staff and incarcerated/detained persons \nmay have with confirmed or suspected CO VI D-19 cases. \n•  All individuals who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to COVID-19 cases or infectious \nmaterials (including body substances; contaminated medical supplies, devices, and equipment; \ncontaminated environmental surfaces; or contaminated air) should follow Infection control practices \noutlined in the CDC Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with \nSuspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcarc Senings. Monitor these \nguidelines regularly for updates. \no  Implement the above gu1dance as fully as possible w1th1n the correctional/detention context. Some of the \nspecific language may not apply directly to healthcare sett1ngs wlthin correctional facilities and detention \ncenters, or to facililies without onsite healthcare capacity, and may need to be adapted to reflect facility \noperations and custody needs. \no  Note that these recommendations apply to staff as well as to incarcerated/detained individuals who may come \nin contact with contaminated materials during the course of their work placement in the facility (e.g., cleaning). \n•  Staff should exercise caution when in contact with individuals showing symptoms of a respiratory \ninfection. Contact should be minimized to the extent possible until the infected individual is wearing a face mask. If \nCOVID-19 is suspected, staff should wear recommended PPE (see rPE section). \n•  Refer to PPE section to determine recommended PPE for individuals persons in contact with confirmed \nCOVID-19 cases, contacts. and potentially contaminated items. \n\nClinical Care of COVID-19 Cases \n•  Facilities should ensure that incarcerated/detained individuals receive medical evaluation and \ntreatment at the first signs of COVID-19 symptoms. \no  If a facility is not able to provide such evaluation and treatment, a plan should be in place to safely transfer the \nindividual to another facility or local hospital. \no  The Initial medical evaluation should determine whether a symptomatic individual Is at higher risk for severe \nIllness from COVID-19. Persons at higher risk may include older adults and persons of any age with serious \nunderlying medical conditions such as lung disease. heart disease, and diabetes. See CDC's website for a \ncomplete list, and check regularly for updates as more data become available to inform th1s issue. \n•  Staff evaluating and providing care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases should follow the CDC \nInterim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) \nand monitor the guidance website regularly for updates to these recommendations. \n•  Healthcare staff should evaluate persons with respiratory symptoms or contact with a COVID-19 case in \na separate room, with the door closed if possible, while wearing recommended PPE and ensuring that \nthe suspected case is wearing a face mask. \no  If poss1ble, designate a room near each housing unit to evaluate individuals with COVID-19 symptoms, rather \nthan having them walk through the facility to be evaluated in the medical unit. \n•  Clinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness (e.g. • influenza). \n•  The facility should have a plan in place to safely transfer persons with severe illness from COVID-19 to \na local hospital if they require care beyond what the facility is able to provide. \n•  When evaluating and treating persons with symptoms of COVID-19 who do not speak English. using a \nlanguage line or provide a trained interpreter when possible. \nRecommended PPE and PPE Training for Staff and \nIncarcerated/Detained Persons \n•  Ensure that all staff (healthcare and non-healthcare) and incarcerated/detained persons who will have \ncontact with infectious materials in their work placements have been trained to correctly don, doff, and \ndispose of PPE relevant to the level of contact they will have with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 \ncases. \no  Ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons who require respiratory protection (e.g., N95s) for their \nwork responsibilities have been medically cleared, trained, and fit-tested in the context of an employer's \nrespiratory protection program. \no  For PPE training materials and posters, please visit the CDC website on Protecting Healthcare Personnel. \n•  Ensure that all staff are trained to perform hand hygiene after removing PPE. \n•  If administrators anticipate that incarcerated/detained persons will request unnecessary PPE, consider \nproviding training on the different types of PPE that are needed for differing degrees of contact with \nCOVID-19 cases and contacts, and the reasons for those differences (see Table 1 ). Monitor linked CDC \nguidelines in Table 1 for updates to recommended PPE. \n•  Keep recommended PPE near the spaces in the facility where it could be needed, to facilitate quick \naccess in an emergency. \n•  Recommended PPE for incarcerated/detained individuals and staff in a correctional facility will vary \nbased on the type of contact they have with COVID-19 cases and lheir contacts (see Table 1) . Each type of \nrecommended PPE Is defined below. As above, note that PPE shortages are anticipated in every category \nduring the COVID-19 response. \n\no  N95 respirator \nSee below for guidance on when face masks are acceptable alternatives for N95s. N95 respirators should be \nprioritized when staft anticipate contaa with mfecrious aerosols from a COVID-19 case. \no  Face mask \no  Eye protection - goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face \no  A single pair of disposable patient examination gloves \nGloves should be changed if they become torn or heavily contaminated. \no  Disposable medical isolation gown or single-use/disposable coveralls, when feasible \n•  If custody staff are unable to wear a disposable gown or coveralls because it limits access to their duly bell \nand gear, ensure that duty belt and gear are disinfected after close contact with the individual. Clean and \ndisinfect duty belt and gear prior to reuse usmg a household cleaning spray or Wipe, according to lhe \nproduct label. \n•  If there are shortages of gowns, they should be prioritized for aerosol-generating procedures, care \ni'lctivitles where splashes and sprays are anticipated, and high-contact patient care activities that provide \nopportunities for transfer of pathogens to the hands and clothing of stJff. \n•  Note that shortages of all PPE categories are anticipated during the COVID-19 response, particularly for \nnon-healthcare workers. Guidance for optimizing the supply of each category can be found on CDC's \nwebsite: \no  Guidance in the event of a shortage of N95 respirators \n•  Based on local and regional Situational analysis of PPE supplies, face masks are an acceptable \nalternative when the supply chain of respirators cannot meet the demand. During this t1me, \navailable respirators should be prioritized for staff engaging in activities that would expose them to \nrespiratory aerosols, wh1ch pose the highest exposure risk. \no  Guidance in the event of a shortage of face masks \no  Guidance in the event of a shortage of eye protection \no  Guidance in the event of a shortage of gowns/coveralls \nN95  Face  Eye  Gown/ \nClassification of Individual Wearing PPE  respirator  mask  Protection  Gloves  Coveralls \nIncarcerated/Detained Persons \nAsymptomatic mcarcerated/detained persons  Apply face masks for source control as feas1ble \n(under quarantine as close contacts of a COVID-19  based on local supply. especially if housed as a cohort \ncase*) \nIncarcerated/detained persons who are  X \nconfirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, or \nshowing symptoms of COVID-19 \nIncarcerated/detained persons in a work  X  X \nplacement handling laundry or used food service \nitems from a COVID-19 case or case contact \nIncarcerated/detained persons in a work  Additional PPE may be needed  X  X \nplacement cleaning areas where a COVID-19 case  based on the product labeL See \nhas spent time  CDC guidelines for more details. \n\nStaff \nStaff havmg direct contact with asyrrptomatic  Face mask. eye protection, and \nincarcerated/detained persons under quarantine  gloves as local supply and \nas close contacts of a COVID-19 case* {but not  scope of dulies allow. \nperforming temperature checks or providing \nmedical care) \nStaff performing temperature checks on any  X  X  X  X \ngroup of people (staff, visitors, or \nmcarcerated/detained persons), or providing \nmedical care to asymptomatic quarantined \npersons \nStaff having direct contact with (including  X**  X  X  X \ntransport) or offering medical care to confirmed \nor suspected COVID-19 cases (see CDC infection \ncontrol guidelines) \nStaff present during a procedure on a confirmed  X  X  X  X \nor suspected COVID-19 case that may generate \nrespiratory aerosols (see CDC infection control \nguidelines) \nStaff handling laundry or used food service items  X  X \nfrom a COVID-19 case or case contact \nStaff cleaning an area where a COVID-19 case has  Addttlonal PPE may be needed  X  X \nspent time  based on the product label.

However, based on local and reg1onal situational analysis of PPE supplies. face masks are an \nacceptable alternative when the supply chain of respirators cannot meet the demand. During this time, available respirators should \nbe priorit1zed for procedures that are likely to generate respiratory aerosols, which would pose the highest exposure risk to staff. \n\nVerbal Screening and Temperature Check Protocols for \nIncarcerated/Detained Persons, Staff, and Visitors \nThe guidance above recommends verbal screening and temperature checks for mcarcerated/detained persons, staff, \nvolunteers. and visitors who enter correctional and detention facilities, as well as incarcerated/detained persons who are \ntransferred to another facility or released from custody. Below. verbal screening questions for COVID-19 symptoms and \ncontact with known cases, and a safe temperature check procedure are detailed. \n•  Verbal screening for symptoms of COVID-19 and contact with COVID-19 cases should include the \nfollowing questions: \no  Today or in the past 24 hours. have you had any of the following symptoms? \n•  Fever, felt feverish, or had chills? \n•  Cough? \n•  Difficulty breathing? \no  In the past 14 days. have you had contact with a person known to be infected with the novel coronavirus \n(COV/D-19}? \n•  The following is a protocol to safely check an individual's temperature: \no  Perform hand hygiene \no  Put on a face mask. eye protection (goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and srdes of the \nface), gown/coveralls. and a single parr of disposable gloves \no  Check Individual's temperature \no  If performing a temperature check on multiple individuals, ensure that a clean pair of gloves is \nused for each individual and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each \ncheck. If disposable or non-contact thermometers are used and the screener did not have physical contact \nwith an individual, gloves do not need to be changed before the next check. If non-contact thermometers are \nused, they should be cleaned routinely as recommended by CDC for infec~ion control. \no  Remove and discard PPE \no  Perform hand hygiene \nPage last reviewed: March 23, 2020 \nContent source; Naliunal Center for lmmunmJPon and Resp ratory D1seases (NCIRD), DiviSIOn of Viral Disea<;es ",

      "text": "Supreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth    Full Court:   SJC-12926      Filed: 4/22/2020 3:27 PM\nTHE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS \nOFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\n \nONE ASHBURTON PLACE \nBOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS 02108 \n  (617) 727-2200 \n  (617) 727-4765 TTY \n  www.mass.gov/ago \n \nApril 22, 2020 \n \nBY ELECTRONIC FILING AND EMAIL \n \nFrancis V. Kenneally, Clerk for the Commonwealth \nSupreme Judicial Court \nJohn Adams Courthouse \nBoston, MA  02108 \n \nRe:  No. SJC-12926, Committee for Public Counsel Services, et al. v. Chief Justice of the \nTrial Court, et al. \n \nDear Mr. Kenneally: \n \n  I write on behalf of the Attorney General’s Office (“AGO”) in response to petitioners’ Motion \nfor Reconsideration or Modification of Decision, filed on April 17, 2020 (the “Motion”).1 \n \n  The AGO has previously argued in its brief filed March 28, 2020, and its post-argument letter \nfiled April 2, 2020, that a change to the 60-day time limit in Mass. R. Crim. P. 29, such that \npresently-incarcerated individuals could seek to revise and revoke their sentences due to the COVID-\n19 pandemic along the lines set forth in the Special Master’s Report and Recommendation, would not \noffend the separation of powers.  However, this Court did not agree with that view.  See slip op. at \n34-37.2  Petitioners now urge that courts could invoke their inherent authority to stay sentences of \nincarcerated persons for similar reasons, relying on Commonwealth v. Charles, 466 Mass. 63 (2013).  \nSee Motion at 7-8. \n \n  For two reasons, the AGO believes that courts’ inherent authority does not allow a stay of \nsentence in these circumstances, and therefore that the relief sought in section I of the Motion is not \navailable.  First, this Court’s opinion in this case appears already to have foreclosed the possibility \nthat such a stay might be proper.  See slip op. at 34 (holding that “[o]ur broad power of \nsuperintendence over the courts does not grant us the authority to authorize courts to revise or revoke \ndefendants’ custodial sentences, to stay the execution of sentence, or to order their temporary release \nunless” Rule 29’s terms are met, or there is a pending appeal or new trial motion) (emphasis added).  \nSecond, Charles authorized a stay only “pending the disposition of [the defendant’s] motion for a \nnew trial.”  466 Mass. at 74.  The Court held that “the interest of justice is not served by the \n \n1 This letter is filed only on behalf of the Attorney General.  \n2 In light of the Court’s decision, the AGO concurs with the Chief Justice of the Trial Court that guidance on the \napplication to motions for relief under Mass. R. Crim. P. 29 of paragraph 12 of this Court’s Order of April 1, 2020, \nregarding the tolling of certain deadlines until May 4, 2020, would assist courts and litigants. \n\ncontinued imprisonment of a defendant who may be entitled to a new trial,” id. (emphasis added), but \nthe authority recognized in Charles does not extend to situations where no appeal, new trial motion, \nor other proceeding calling into question the validity of the original conviction is pending.   \n \n  Petitioners also argue that constitutional claims raised in the as-yet undecided motion to \nintervene in this case (No. SJC-12926, dkt. #50), and in a separate action (Foster v. Mici, No. SJ-\n2020-212), justify stays of sentence “while the above actions are adjudicated.”  Motion at 9-10.  But \nwe know of no authority holding that the mere filing of a motion to intervene could justify a stay of \nsentence, and entitlement to any relief pursuant to the claims raised in Foster v. Mici should be \naddressed in that case, not this one. \n \n  The AGO agrees that the relief sought in sections II-1 and II-2 of the Motion (pages 13-15) is \nwarranted to expedite appropriate reduction in populations within jails, houses of correction, and \nprisons, to the extent that such relief is consistent with the AGO’s previously-stated position.  See AG \nBr. 21 (“A detainee who has tested positive, or been deemed presumptively positive, for COVID-19 \nshould not be released into the community without adequate provision for quarantine and medical \ncare.”).3  The AGO takes no position on the relief sought in section II-3 (pages 16-18). \n \n  Finally, petitioners apparently fault state and county officials for “rarely testing anyone” and \nfor “burying [their] head[s] in the sand.”  Motion at 6.  The AGO agrees that the lack of widespread \ntesting of inmates and staff in Massachusetts jails, houses of correction, and prisons is a serious \nproblem, but the responsibility for that problem may not lie primarily with the administrators of those \ninstitutions.  It is the AGO’s understanding that sufficient testing supplies are simply not available to \nundertake comprehensive surveillance of staff, inmates, and potential releasees for infection.  This \nregrettable situation reflects the larger problem of an insufficient supply of COVID-19 tests in \nMassachusetts and other states, as has been widely reported in the press.  See, e.g., Rick Rojas, \n“‘Delusional’: Governors Reject Pence’s Claim on Virus Testing,” New York Times, Apr. 19, 2020, \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/19/us/coronavirus-governors-trump-tests.html (“Governors facing \ngrowing pressure to revive economies decimated by the coronavirus said on Sunday that a shortage of \ntests was among the most significant hurdles in the way of lifting restrictions in their states.”).  It is \nnot clear how this problem can be solved in this litigation, but one step this Court should consider is \nto require regular reporting of the “[a]vailability of COVID-19 test kits, nasal swabs, thermometers, \nmasks and gloves” at Massachusetts jails, houses of correction, and prisons, as recommended at page \n9 of the Special Master’s Report and Recommendation. \n \nI would appreciate your circulating this response to the Justices.  Thank you for your \nassistance. \n \nYours sincerely, \n \n              /s/ David C. Kravitz \n \nDavid C. Kravitz \nDeputy State Solicitor \ncc:  All counsel of record \n \n3 With respect to the relief sought in section II-2, the AGO suggests that the Court clarify that the Commonwealth should \nrespond to Rule 29 motions within 48 hours of receipt, or on the next business day following receipt, whichever is later. \n2 \n ",

PLS is a not-for-profit legal \nservices corporation, founded in 1972, that provides civil legal assistance to people who are \nincarcerated in Massachusetts state prisons and in the county jails and houses of correction.   \nFor the reasons discussed below PLS strongly supports the relief sought by petitioners as \nurgently necessary to avert, or at least mitigate, a coming catastrophe in Massachusetts prisons \nand jails. \nThroughout this crisis we have received constant communication from incarcerated \npeople (through our toll-free telephone and by mail), their family members, doctors, attorneys \nand even from prison staff.  We have also been in dialogue with correctional administrators and \npublic safety officials.  While we recognize that good-faith efforts are being made, it is clear that \nthese are not sufficient and, given the nature of the epidemic, prisons cannot be made safe for \n\n  2 \nprisoners or for staff.  As former Suffolk County Sheriff and Secretary of Public Safety told \nWGBH, “It is insane to say that adequate protocols already exist for a disease about which you \nknow virtually nothing.”1 \nMassachusetts prisons and jails will inevitably be breeding grounds for COVID-19, as \ndocumented in the amicus letter in support of petitioners submitted by 14 medical professionals.  \nScreening of staff and prisoners entering into facilities cannot keep the disease out,2 and the virus \nis already spreading invisibly within prison walls.  On March 21, 2020 the first prisoner in a \nMassachusetts prison tested positive for COVID-19.  Three days later, eight prisoners and two \nstaff (including a medical provider) in the Massachusetts Treatment Center (MTC) had the \ndisease, along with a staff member at MCI-Shirley.3  It is also doubtless already within county \njails, which have much greater turnover; a Middlesex County prisoner has tested positive for the \ndisease,4 and we have received reports that a Corrections Officer in Norfolk County has as well.  \nThese cases will multiply exponentially as those incubating the disease develop symptoms. \nSpread within our prisons and jails, COVID-19 will cause illness and death in prisoners \nat a rate far higher than the general population.  Massachusetts has the oldest incarcerated \npopulation in the United States,5  a group at much greater likelihood of death and severe \ncomplications necessitating hospitalization and intensive care.6  And a catastrophe in prison will \nalso be a catastrophe for public health.  As prisons rapidly lose capacity to quarantine those \n                                                           \n1 https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2020/03/26/cabral-jails-need-new-protocols-for-dealing-with-covid-19 \n2 Asymptomatic transmission is discussed in the amicus letter of medical professionals p. 6.  See also Matter of \nExtradition of Toledo Manrique, No. 19-mj-71055, 2020 WL 1307109 (U.S. District Court, N.D. Cal. March 19, \n2020) (“Symptoms of COVID-19 can begin to appear 2-14 days after exposure, so screening people based on \nobservable symptoms is just a game of catch up,” and therefore requiring detainee to wait for a confirmed outbreak \nis impractical.   “By then it may be too late.”).  \n3 See https://commonwealthmagazine.org/criminal-justice/covid-19-cases-at-bridgewater-prison-facility-up-to-10/. \n4 See https://www.lowellsun.com/2020/03/27/billerica-inmate-tests-positive-for-covid-19/ \n5 See “Aging Prison Populations Drive Up Costs,” Pew Charitable Trusts (2018), available at  \nhttps://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2018/02/20/aging-prison-populations-drive-up-costs \n(visited March 26, 2020). \n6 See https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications/older-adults.html \n \n\n  3 \nincarcerated, and as more and more prisoners require hospitalization, this will substantially \nburden hospitals and health care resources throughout the Commonwealth, as the epidemic \nstrains the state’s available hospital beds, staff and equipment. \nThese extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary action.  The broadest possible \nprisoner release is needed as part of our broader efforts to stem the tide of this deadly disease.  \nPrison and Jail conditions \nPLS is familiar with Massachusetts state and county facilities through decades of \nlitigation on prison conditions and treatment7 and through participation in official commissions \nand oversight bodies such as the Restrictive Housing Oversight Committee and Special \nCommission to Study the Health and Safety of LGBTQI prisoners.  Even cursory knowledge of \nprison design makes clear that it is impossible to limit COVID-19 exposure in Massachusetts \njails and prisons by maintaining the recommended social distancing of six feet or more and \nmaintaining virus-free surfaces.   \nThroughout DOC and county facilities, prisoners are housed in dormitories, including \nthose housing 50 or more people in Bristol, Essex, and Worcester counties.8  Contagion in a \ndormitory will spell danger for each person living there, as beds are often some two feet apart \nfrom each other (or less) and residents live in close proximity to each other twenty-four hours a \nday.  Of particular concern are medical dormitories such as the Nursing Care Unit at MCI-\n                                                           \n7 See, e.g., Reaves v. Department of Correction, 404 F.Supp.3d 520 (D. Mass. 2019)(ruling that DOC incapable of \nproviding adequate medical care to quadriplegic prisoner and ordering his transfer to non-correctional hospital);  \nBriggs v. Department of Correction, C.A. No. 1:15-cv-40162-GAO (2019 class action settlement providing \naccommodations to deaf and hard of hearing prisoners); Fowler, et al. v.  Commissioner of Correction, C.A. NO. \n1:15CV12298- NMG (2018 class action settlement mandating DOC provide prisoners access to modern Hepatitis C \nmedications); Does v. Commissioner of Correction, Suffolk NO. 1984-CV-00828 (2019 class action challenge to \nDOC confinement of men civilly committed under Section 35); Richardson v. Sheriff of Middlesex County, \nMiddlesex C.A. No. 05857 (class action resulting in the 2014 closure of Cambridge Jail based on overcrowded and \nunsanitary conditions); Ahearn v. Vose, 64 Mass.App.Ct. 403 (2005) (class action resulting in DOC installing flush \ntoilets in medium security prison) \n8 Some of the other facilities that rely on dormitory housing are, ant minimum, the DOC’s North Central \nCorrectional Institute, and facilities in Hampshire, Middlesex and Plymouth counties.  \n \n\n  4 \nShirley, which has rooms of 4-6 prisoners each.  Dining halls and medication lines are also \nplaces where prisoners still are inevitably in close contact.  The attached photographs illustrate \nhow difficult it is for prisoners to keep apart in all these settings.9 \nIndeed, some of the most vulnerable prisoners in the Department of Correction are held \nin a dormitory, the Clinical Stabilization Unit (CSU) at MCI-Norfolk.  Some sixteen prisoners, \nlargely elderly, with medical conditions such as COPD and congestive heart failure, live, sleep \nand eat in close proximity to each other.  No matter how staff access is limited, if and when the \ndisease enters it will be catastrophic for those in the CSU.   \nWith over half of the facilities in Massachusetts operating above their approved capacity, \nboth dormitories and double- and triple- celled units have remained full or close to capacity.   \nWhere prisoners are housed two or three to a cell, they are locked in close proximity to another \nperson or persons for hours during the day as well as overnight.  For example, in the North side \nof Souza Baranowski Correctional Center, many prisoners are double-celled and are locked in \ntogether nearly 22 hours a day, if not longer, creating a near certainty of transmission if and \nwhen one of the cellmates is infected through contact with a staff member or a surface area in the \nprison or on an outside medical or court appointment.  \nThe vast majority of prisoners share toilets, sinks, and showers with others.  DPH \nregulations require at least one working toilet and one working sink for every 12 male prisoners, \none working toilet for every eight male prisoners, and one working sink for every 12 female \nprisoners.10  In the best of circumstances, facilities have struggled with maintaining sanitation \nstandards set forth by the Department of Public Health.  For example, the most recent DPH \n                                                           \n9 See Exhibit 1.  \n10 See 105 CMR 451.114. \n \n \n\n  5 \nreport for the largest facility, MCI-Norfolk, notes 475 repeat violations.  Given the current state \nof staffing in correctional institutions, it is virtually impossible to ensure virus free surfaces. \nJails including those in Hampden and Franklin counties have established separate \nhousing units where newly admitted detainees are held during the possible incubation period, in \norder to limit transmission into the facility.  It goes without saying that some detainees coming \ninto these units will have COVID-19 and all others held in these units will be at tremendous and \ndeadly risk of infection. \nLack of capacity to quarantine and provide medical care   \nAs the crisis inevitably grows, prisons and jails will be unable to isolate those showing \nsymptoms of COVID-19 and quarantine of those who have the disease will likely be impossible \nas numbers climb.  Single-celled rooms in health service units and even in general population \nunits are scarce in nearly every facility. We fear that solitary confinement in Restrictive Housing \nUnits (RHUs) will be used for quarantine, which would be extremely dangerous as well as \ninhumane.  In fact, this is already happening, at least in the RHU of MCI-Norfolk.   In these \nunits, prisoners are locked in their cells 22 -24 hours a day under the supervision of corrections \nofficers. While most RHUs have daily medical rounds, prisoners with COVID can develop \nrapidly worsening symptoms within a matter of hours, with only COs to attend them.   \nIndeed, correctional culture poses a barrier to treatment for all prisoners.  From our long \nhistory of litigation and advocacy, we know that corrections officers frequently neglect or \ndisbelieve prisoner complaints.  In Massachusetts11 as nationwide, prisons and jails are notorious \nfor severe medical neglect.  An emerging disease such as COVID-19, which is not yet fulling \nunderstood, presents a grave risk that prisoners with serious and urgent medical developments \nwill be ignored by  increasingly stressed officers and staff. \n                                                           \n11 https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2020/03/26/cabral-jails-need-new-protocols-for-dealing-with-covid-19. \n \n\n  6 \nThe lack of prison hospital beds is cause for grave concern.  Lemuel Shattuck Hospital is \nthe only hospital serving both DOC and the counties; it has only 28 beds, 23 of which are \ncurrently occupied.12   A conservative estimate for the general population is that some ten \npercent of those infected will require hospitalization,13 likely much higher in the older and sicker \nprison population.   As outside hospitals fill,14 a surge in prison admissions will strain those \nsystems – and prisoners may well be de-prioritized for admission, placing them in serious \ndanger.    \nProtective practices \nThe Massachusetts Department of Health (DPH) has not issued COVID-19 guidelines for \nprisons and jails, though the DPH has issued statewide guidance for residential and congregate \ncare programs.15  As a result, there is no uniformity in the protective measures being put in place \nand practices continue to evolve daily.  While some facilities have improved practices, it simply \nis not possible to keep the disease at bay in prison. \nAs noted above, screening of staff and others entering prisons and jails cannot detect \nasymptomatic carriers, whose numbers will skyrocket.  Therefore the use of personal protective \nequipment (PPE), such as masks and gloves, will be essential.  Massachusetts DPH guidance \ndesigned to conserve the use of PPE recommends the use of “standard medical masks and \nstandard gloves” for “cleaners or caregivers” in correctional facilities and other shared spaces \n                                                           \n12 See DOC Weekly Count Sheets, https://www.mass.gov/doc/weekly-inmate-count-3232020/download   \n13 See “What does the coronavirus mean for the U.S. health care system? Some simple math offers alarming \nanswers,” Stat news (March 10, 2020), available at https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-\nalarming-answers-covid-19/ \n14 See “What does the coronavirus mean?” supra. \n15 See https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-guidance-and-directives#guidance-on-prioritization-of-ppe-in-\nma- \n \n\n  7 \nwith suspected Covid-19 patients.16  If needed for “cleaners or caregivers,” this equipment is \nclearly needed for anyone having contact with prisoners.  And while the need to conserve \nequipment may not permit this at present, if cleaners and caregivers risk transmission through \ncontact with residents, then residents themselves face the same risk and – especially in a \ncontagious setting such as prison – arguably should have this equipment as well.   \nWhile in many facilities at least some staff do have personal protective equipment (PPE), \nsuch as masks and gloves, prisoners do not.  Given the national shortage affecting even medical \nprofessionals, it will not be possible to provide PPE to all staff and others entering the facility, \nmuch less to prisoners.  We have spoken with prison health care providers who are already very \nconcerned that there will not be enough PPE and other critical supplies to meet the crisis.    \nWe recognize the tremendous strain that every jail and prison is under, and it is clear that \nthe DOC and several counties have made efforts to improve practices over the past week.  \nHowever, several weeks into the crisis we continue to receive reports of problems with \nscreening, use of protective equipment, and sanitation.  Here is a small sample:  \n  A prisoner in MCI-Shirley reported today, March 27, 2020, that the medical and DOC \nstaff interacting with prisoners in the Nursing Care Unit were not wearing masks - even \nthose doing mouth checks.  And prisoners stood next to each other in a crowded line \nwaiting for medication.    \n  Also from MCI-Shirley, the “sanitation team” of prisoners that spray down and clean the \nprison had not been called out for four days. And the “chow hall” continued to seat 300 \npeople at a time, in tables so full that people were touching, with tables not wiped down \nbetween meal services. \n  Reports from other DOC facilities indicate that staff are not routinely wearing masks or \ngloves; that Correctional Officers are making hospital trips without safety precautions; \nthat Correctional Officers have entered facilities without screening; and that tactical \nteams are circulating between the various prisons with no protective gear for COVID-19.    \n  Reports from staff employed by Suffolk County indicate that the thermometers used to \ntest staff temperatures on entry were broken, but nevertheless used to clear staff for entry; \nstaff have no face masks; some 20-30 officers were exposed to COVID-19 at a training \nfacility, with some using sick leave and vacation time to self-quarantine but many others \n                                                           \n16 See https://www.mass.gov/doc/guidance-for-prioritization-of-personal-protective-equipment-ppe-in-\nmassachusetts/download. \n \n\n  8 \nforced to return to work.  They also reported that officers are accompanying prisoners on \nhospital details with no extra safety protocols. \n  While we would hope attitudes have changed by now, we had a report that Corrections \nOfficers at the DOC’s Lemuel Shattuck Hospital were told before March 20 not to wear \nmasks because it would cause panic. We also received a report that a Correctional Officer \nat MCI-Framingham was sent home for wearing a mask.  \n \nAnother protective measure, frequent hand washing, is impossible in most correctional \nfacilities, and access to hand sanitizer with alcohol (the only type effective against COVID-19) is \neither denied or limited in many places.  PLS also has received numerous complaints from \nprisoners unable to disinfect their cells and common areas, or wipe off telephones, due to lack of \nadequate supplies.   These large institutional settings present a tremendous challenge to any \neffort to maintain personal hygiene and constant cleanliness of commonly used surfaces. \nGroup activities \nAs discussed above, it is virtually impossible for prisoners to maintain the recommended \nsix feet of distance from others in dormitories, shared cells and in common areas.  This creates a \nproblem for prisons, which must negotiate a tradeoff between locking prisoners in their cells \nversus permitting group activities.  Group programs in DOC and counties seemed to have ceased \nfor the most part, but prisoners are given at least some recreation time necessary for their \nphysical and mental health.  But given population levels, it is often impossible to maintain \ndistance during recreation.    \nPrisoners performing essential tasks such as food preparation must work closely with \nothers during their job shift, such as one prisoner who was reportedly working 12 hour daily \nshifts with 15 other men at SBCC.  Prisoners are also in close contact as they wait for \ndistribution of medication.  For example, we have received reports that some 50 prisoners in \nMCI-Shirley, largely sick and elderly, must wait for medication in the same small room.  \n   \n \n\n  9 \nPrisoners are safer outside, and families are waiting for them. \nDespite the extreme dangers of incarceration during this crisis, some correctional \nadministrators and others have suggested that people may be safer remaining incarcerated.  This \nis patently not the case.  As former Secretary Cabral said,  “. …The second [assertion] is that \ninmates have access to better healthcare inside the facility than outside the facility. That’s not \ntrue.”17  Attempts to portray prisoners as rootless and lacking family ties are destructive.   Just \nthis year, PLS received over one hundred phone calls from family members concerned for their \nincarcerated loved ones. In recent days and weeks, we have spoken to countless family members \nwho are begging for the release of their loved ones, both for their own health and safety and to \nprovide critical support that they cannot provide while incarcerated.   Some examples include: \n  The wife of a 64 year old prisoner serving time for a non-violent offense is a nurse who is \nneeded at work.  She is terrified for the safety of her husband and needs him home to \nprovide critical child care for their disabled child. \n  A prisoner’s girlfriend reported that he is detained for a misdemeanor probation violation \nand his most recent court date to resolve his case was cancelled. They are worried that \novercrowding, including holding eight men in four men cells, and traffic in and out of the \nprison will make him sick. \n  The girlfriend of a prisoner with autoimmune disease and five months remaining on his \nsentence reported that he is under immense stress and subject to lock down in unsanitary \ncondition. \n  The wife of a prisoner with severe asthma and other medical conditions is terrified that \nher husband, who is set for release in October, cannot socially distance in a prison that is \nover 160% capacity. \n  A family member called about his brother at the MTC who is terrified about the rapidly \ndeteriorating situation there as COVID spreads. \n \nRelief beyond that requested by Petitioners is necessary \n \nPLS asks that the Court consider expanding the categories of prisoners eligible for release \nsought in the Petition.  In particular, we suggest that release be considered for: (1) all individuals \ncivilly committed to a correctional facility, whether the Massachusetts Alcohol and Substance \n                                                           \n17 https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2020/03/26/cabral-jails-need-new-protocols-for-dealing-with-covid-19 \n \n\n  10 \nAbuse Center or the Hampden County Jail and House of Correction; and (2) all individuals over \n60, regardless of whether they are sentenced under G.L. c 265. \nG.L. c. 123 Section 35.  The Petition does not address the plight of individuals civilly \ncommitted to correctional facilities for alcohol and substance use disorders under G.L. c. 123, § \n35.  There are currently almost 250 individuals civilly committed to prisons and jails under \nSection 35, 143 at the Massachusetts Alcohol and Substance Abuse Center and 95 at Hampden \nCounty.18  Concerns about the safety of these individuals are heightened because the rapid \nturnover of the population in these facilities makes it impossible to adequately screen newly \nadmitted residents.  The average stay is only 30-40 days.  Furthermore, the congregate living \narrangements and group activities make it extremely difficult or impossible to provide social \ndistancing.  Several MASAC patients on March 25 filed a motion in an unrelated case that PLS \nhas in federal court, Briggs v. Dep’t of Corr. (D., Ma. No. 1:15-cv-40162-GAO), stating that \nduring the COVID outbreak over 80 patients eat together in the dining hall “inches in \nproximity.”  The motion also contains multiple affidavits describing the use of unclean portable \ntoilets.  \nPLS has extensively investigated the conditions under which these men are held as part of \nongoing litigation in Doe et al. v. Mici et al.(Suffolk NO. 1984CV00828).   These men have \nparticular vulnerabilities including high rates of hepatitis C and other infectious disease, and \ngenerally poor health and nutrition. On entry to the DOC’s Section 35 facility, the Massachusetts \nAlcohol and Substance Abuse Center (MASAC), the men go through withdrawal and \ndetoxification in dormitory setting that dozens of men in recent years have consistently described \n                                                           \n18 See DOC Weekly Count Sheets for March 23, 2020.  https://www.mass.gov/doc/weekly-inmate-count-\n3232020/download  \n \n\n  11 \nas unsanitary, including blood, urine, vomit and feces, with extremely limited cleaning.  After \ndetox, they live in crowded housing units and attend group programs together. \nThe purpose of Section 35 confinement is negated by the fact that, according to the filing \nin the Briggs case only 0-2 substance use disorder classes are held each day.  The state is \nexposing a vulnerable population of men with SUD, not charged with any crime, to the \npotentially deadly risks of incarceration in during the COVID-19 outbreak – while at the same \ntime having little or no ability to safely continue treatment programs. \nIndividuals over 60.   The Petition asks for release of all men over 60 only if they have \nnot been sentenced for “crimes against the person” under G.L. c. 265.  See Petition at 30.  By \ncontrast, it seeks release of all persons with “a condition or disease that puts them at increased \nrisk of severe COVID-19 complications and death.  Id. This is unreasonably restrictive for \nseveral reasons.  First, advanced age is itself a condition which places a person at increased risk \nfor COVID-19, and therefore age should be treated as any other such condition. According to the \nCenter for Disease control, 8 out of 10 deaths from COVID-19 have been persons 65 years old or \nolder, with this age group disproportionally requiring hospitalization and intensive care.19  Both \nDOC and County prisoners who need to hospitalization are placed in the correctional unit at the \nLemuel Shattuck Hospital, which has only 28 beds, 23 of which are already occupied.20  It is \nalmost inevitable that Shattuck will soon be overrun as COVID-19 cases multiple in the \ncorrectional facility.  Indeed, one of the 10 prisoners with COVID-19 at the Massachusetts \nTreatment Center has already required hospitalization at Shattuck. \nSecond, Chapter 265 is an overbroad barometer for determining who should be granted \nthe relief in this case because not all such crimes are serious; they include trivial offenses such as \n                                                           \n19 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications/older-adults.html \n20 Weekly Count Sheet for March 23, 2020 https://www.mass.gov/doc/weekly-inmate-count-3232020/download  \n \n\n  12 \nplaying a radio without headphones on public transportation.  See G.L. c. 265, § 42.  And many \nof the most common chapter 265 crimes, such as assault or assault and battery, are merely \nmisdemeanors. See. G.L c. 265, § 13A(a). \nThird, it is well known that people largely “age out” of crime, meaning people over the \nage of 60 simultaneously are at high risk for COVID-19 and low risk for public safety. \nCategorically excluding these prisoners from release on the basis of conviction will be \ncounterproductive and needlessly risk lives and public health and safety. \nConclusion \n  Every incarcerated person faces a substantial risk of serious harm during this crisis, \nespecially older and medically compromised individuals.   State and county systems are uneven \nat best in the protective measures they are taking, and even the most stringent measures cannot \nprevent tragedies from multiplying as the epidemic progresses.  As infection spreads in our \nprisons and jails, it will result in disproportionate need for hospitalization and intensive care, \nwhich will needlessly contribute to a crisis of resources in our health care systems.  We must be \ntaking all measures we can as a Commonwealth to reduce the spread of infection in all arenas, \nespecially high risk arenas such as prisons and jails.  The most effective way to reduce the spread \nof infection in prisons and jails is to release as many people as we can, as quickly and efficiently \nas possible. \nWe must radically revise our conception of public safety and the way in which we \nbalance the need for incarceration.  No state prisoner was sentenced to death or permanent \ninjury.  Pretrial detainees are convicted of nothing, and those civilly committed have been \ncharged with nothing.  Prison staff and outside contractors deserve every effort to reduce their \n \n\n  13 \nexposure.  The relief sought by CPCS is necessary and reasonable, and PLS concurs with the \nlegal reasoning put forth in its brief. \nMarch 27, 2020            Respectfully submitted, \n \nPRISONERS’ LEGAL SERVICES OF \nMASSACUSETTS  \n \n \n    /s/ \n______________________________ \nELIZABETH MATOS, BBO # 671505 \nJAMES PINGEON, BBO # 541852 \nBONITA TENNERIELLO, BBO # 662132 \nJESSE WHITE, BBO# 673332 \nPrisoners Legal Services \n50 Federal Street, 4th Floor \nBoston, MA  02110 \n(617) 482-2773 \nlmatos@plsma.org \njpingeon@plsma.org \nbtenneriello@plsma.org \njwhite@plsma.org \n \n \nCertification pursuant to Mass RAP 17(c) \nI hereby certify that: \n(A) counsel for petitioners did not author the brief in whole or inpart; \n(B) No party or party’s counsel contributed money that was intended to fund preparing or \nsubmitting the brief; \n(C) No person or entity—other than the amicus curiae, its members, or its counsel—\ncontributed money that was intended to fund preparing or submitting the brief; and \n(D) the amicus curiae or its counsel does not represent any of the parties to this petition \nin another proceeding involving similar issues or nor was amicus involved in any related \nproceeding or transaction.  \n/s/ \n___________________________ \nBONITA TENNERIELLO, BBO # 662132 \n   \n \n\n  14 \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT 1 \n   \n \n\n  15 \nEssex County Correctional Facility, May 2018: \n \nSource: https://www.salemnews.com/news/local_news/prison-spending-up-as-inmate-population-\ndrops/article_9aa24139-058c-57cb-a1b4-5acf7946ce72.html \nEssex County Detox Unit for Women, 2016 \n \n \n\n  16 \nSource: https://www.salemnews.com/news/local_news/middleton-jail-opening-detox-unit-for-\nwomen/article_1c8be797-4e65-5a41-9294-5fb346a15793.html \nBristol County Jail, 2018 \n \nSource: https://commonwealthmagazine.org/immigration/detainees-at-jail-say-they-fear-covid-19-outbreak/ \nMCI-Shirley, 2011 \n \n\n  17 \n \nSource: https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2011/11/14/minimum-security-high-\nconcerns/DZznX932fWIMKaLtM6xwLK/story.html \nSouza Baranowski Correctional Center \n \n \n \n \n ",

No. SJC-12926 \n \nCOMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC COUNSEL SERVICES and \nMASSACHUSETTS ASSOCIATION OF  \nCRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYERS, \nPetitioners, \n \nv. \n \nCHIEF JUSTICE OF THE TRIAL COURT, et al., \nRespondents. \n \n \nREPLY MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF  \nMOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OR MODIFICATION OF DECISION \n \n \nNone of the Respondents say they believe this Court’s April 3 decision is \noperating to save sufficient numbers of incarcerated individuals from illness and \ndeath. Nor could they. In the DOC, few prisoners are being released; it seems less \nthan half of the 300 people with positive parole votes as of March 31 have actually \nreceived their parole permits. Although more people have been released from \ncounty facilities, none of the sheriffs claim that the relief ordered by this Court has \nenabled them to make strides in physical distancing or anything else.1 \n                                         \n1 In the Middlesex House of Correction, a population reduction has enabled the \nSheriff to close dormitory style units, but the Sheriff reports that this reduction is not \na result of this Court’s decision. See MSO COVID-19 Information, April 10, 2020 – \n9:23 a.m. (Update #20) at https://www.middlesexsheriff.org/covid19.  \n1 \n \n\nNevertheless, in opposing Petitioners’ request for the kind of “further \nresponse” that this Court anticipated might be necessary, Committee for Public \nCounsel Services v. Chief Justice of the Trial Court, 484 Mass. 431, 453 (2020), \nseveral Respondents imply that the situation is under control. It is not. \nIf the situation were under control, it would be getting better, not worse. But \nat least 279 incarcerated individuals and at least 209 corrections staffers have been \ninfected with COVID-19, up from a combined total of 29 on the day this petition \nwas filed,2 and prisoner deaths have risen from zero to at least seven during that \ntime. And Respondents effectively concede that the true extent of the outbreak is a \nmystery. Two Respondents acknowledge the lack of widespread testing is a serious \nproblem, see AGO at 2; SCDAO at 14, many of the sheriffs appear to be testing \nonly those who are symptomatic for COVID-19, see Sheriffs Resp. at 1, and the \nreports from all Respondents demonstrate that a high percentage of those being \ntested are positive3—a telltale sign of inadequate testing.4 The known infections, \naccordingly, are likely the tip of the iceberg, since “a symptom-based testing protocol \n                                         \n2 See Deborah Becker, 29 People in Mass. Prisons and Jails Diagnosed With \nCOVID-19, WBUR (March 23, 2020). \n3 See DOC Resp. at 4 (123 positives from 294 tests is 41.8%); Affidavit of Essex \nCounty Sheriff Kevin Coppinger ¶12 (38 positives from 89 tests is 42.6%). \n4 See Declaration of Yoav Golan, M.D. ¶ 9, Foster v. Mici, SJC-12935 (Apr. 14, \n2020) (explaining how “[t]he much higher positive rate in prisons and jails is \nconsistent with severely restricted ability to test, with testing limited to those with \ntypical and substantial symptoms, missing many with atypical or less severe \nsymptoms”). \n2 \n \n\nwill not capture the true extent of the disease within jails and prisons.” Affidavit of \nDr. Elisa Choi ¶5.  \nDespite not knowing the scope of the outbreak they need to fight, and \ncontrary to this Court’s view that “a reduction in the number of people who are held \nin custody is necessary” to curb outbreaks, CPCS v. Chief Justice, 484 Mass. at 445, \nRespondents appear to be adopting harsh measures that might accomplish very little \nbesides visiting psychiatric damage on incarcerated people. Some Respondents are \nlocking prisoners in their cells for at least 23 hours a day, or only permitting them \nout for showers and phone calls.5 Without sufficient testing, there will be no ability to \ngauge the success of the lockdowns or whether they can be discontinued, and this \ninhumane treatment could go on indefinitely.6  \nIf we continue down this path, it is very likely many incarcerated individuals \nand corrections staffers will get sick, more will die, and undetected outbreaks will \nspread into the community. Petitioners respectfully suggest a different path, one with \nsignificantly increased testing, better data reporting in order to identify “hotspots,” \nand a process for quicker and more releases. \n                                         \n5 See DOC Resp. at 6 (“facilities remain in lockdown”); Coppinger Aff. ¶18 (inmates \n“locked-in” and let out of cells “for showers and telephone calls”); Affidavit of Lisa \nNewman-Polk ¶8 (client locked in cell 23.5 hours per day). \n6 See Connecticut prison warning: Prolonged solitary confinement may ‘amount to \ntorture’, UN expert warns; UN NEWS, at https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/02/\n1058311. \n3 \n \n\nI.  More testing and more detailed reporting are essential. \n \n“You cannot contain what you don’t know.” Choi Aff. ¶7. Insufficient testing \nmakes it impossible to locate, isolate, and treat outbreaks of the virus.7 Inadequate \nreporting leaves defense attorneys and the courts in the dark. Yet these problems are \npresent in this case. \nA. This Court should order more testing. \nRespondents’ submissions reveal that testing of incarcerated individuals in \nMassachusetts has focused on those exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms. Although the \nAttorney General suggests that a lack of widespread testing may be attributable to \nresource constraints, AGO Resp. at 2, the sheriffs themselves do not attribute their \nlimited testing to resource constraints. Instead, they candidly acknowledge that many \nof them have a practice of not testing asymptomatic individuals. Sheriffs’ Resp. at Ex. \nA (Wurcel Aff.). The sheriffs tested just 58 incarcerated individuals between April \n17 (the day this motion was filed) and April 24.  \nIn contrast, during that same period, the DOC reportedly began using a \nmobile COVID-19 testing site with the capacity to test up to 200 people per day. \nDOC Resp. at 4. This is a commendable step. Between April 22 and April 23, the \nDOC increased its number of tests by 181, from 296 to 477. As shown below, where \n                                         \n7 See Coppinger Aff. ¶11 (“Our team of medical experts have advised us that \naggressive testing is the key to isolation and treatment of the virus. We have engaged \nthat process knowing it will allow for better inmate treatment and care”).  \n4 \n \n\nincarcerated individuals are tested, infections are found; where officials are not \nlooking for infections, they are indeed not finding them.8 \n \n                                         \n8 This mirrors what is occurring at jails and prisons throughout the country. See, e.g., \nCary Aspinwall and Joseph Neff, These Prisons are Doing Mass Testing for \nCOVID-19—And Finding Mass Infections, The Marshall Project (Apr. 24, 2020), \nhttps://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/04/24/these-prisons-are-doing-mass-testing-\nfor-covid-19-and-finding-mass-infections. For example, when North Carolina’s \nNeuse Correctional Institution tested all 700 prisoners at its facility, it discovered that \n“at least 65 percent of the prisoners have the virus,” 98 percent of whom did not \nreport symptoms at the time they were tested. Id. \n5 \n \n\n \nThis limited assessment of the prevalence of COVID-19 in Massachusetts \nprisons and jails is unacceptable. “In order to stop an outbreak, you need to first \nunderstand how many infections there are.” Choi Aff. ¶7. For COVID-19, that \nmeans testing those without symptoms. The CDC estimates that infected individuals \ncan spread COVID-19 up to 48 hours before the onset of any symptoms,9 and that \nup to 25% of infected individuals never develop any symptoms at all.10 Indeed, \ntesting asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic people is especially crucial because \n                                         \n9 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Public Health Recommendations for \nCommunity-Related Exposure, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/php/public-health-recommendations.html. \n10 Apoorva Mandavilli, Infected but Feeling Fine: The Unwitting Coronavirus \nSpreaders, The N.Y. Times (March 31, 2020), https://www.nytimes.com/2020/ \n03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html. \n6 \n \n\n“trying to understand who is infected as early as possible before there has been any \nsecondary transmission is key to controlling an epidemic.” Choi Aff. ¶11. The way \nto do this is through testing of individuals without symptoms. \nTo the extent that some sheriffs believe that it is appropriate to decline to test \nsuch individuals, they are mistaken. The Massachusetts Department of Public \nHealth (DPH) has recognized the importance of asymptomatic testing in congregate \nsettings; for nursing homes, it urges those using its mobile testing program to order \n“tests for all residents and staff, NOT just symptomatic individuals.” (Emphasis in \noriginal.)11 When it comes to disease transmission, carceral settings and nursing \nhomes are analogous. Choi Aff. ¶13. As a result, it “is reasonable to apply what is \nalready being recommended by DPH in a very similar congregate setting of nursing \nhomes to Massachusetts jails and prisons.” Id. ¶14. Likewise, Governor Baker has \nasserted that the DOC is following guidance from the DPH, including on testing \nprotocols.12 Consistent with DPH recommendations, this Court should order the \n                                         \n11 Massachusetts COVID-19 Nursing Home, Rest Home, and ALR Mobile Testing \nProgram (April 13, 2020), http://www.massmed.org/Patient-Care/COVID-\n19/Massachusetts-COVID-19-Nursing-Home,-Rest-Home-and-ALR-Mobile-Testing-\nProgram/. \n12 “[DOC officials] are in constant contact with the Department of Public Health \naround the policies and protocols that they’re using, whether it’s related to hand \nsanitizer or testing protocols or almost everything they’re doing with respect to \ndisinfectant and visitation and everything else.” Remarks by Gov. Charlie Baker, \nApr. 23, 2020, at https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2775&v\n=z4hWo6yIIi0&feature=emb_logo (from 45:12 to 47:03). \n7 \n \n\nDOC and sheriffs to pursue testing of all incarcerated individuals and staff, \nsymptomatic or otherwise. Choi Aff. ¶14. \nIf there are sheriffs who lack either the resources or the willingness to learn \nthe scope of the outbreak in their facilities, they should take immediate steps to \nremove prisoners from those facilities. Cf. G. L. c. 126, § 26 (authorizing the \nremoval of prisoners to any “suitable place” if “disease breaks out in a jail or other \ncounty prison”). Upon release, some sheriffs and DOC facilities are providing a flyer \nfrom Boston Medical Center’s Office Based Addiction Treatment program offering \n“immediate linkage to treatment with buprenorphine (Suboxone) or naltrexone \n(Vivitrol) by phone intake with addiction nurse and provider” for those suffering \nfrom substance use disorder. See attached BMC flyer. Our understanding is that \nthey have helped at least 34 people referred through the sheriffs and some DOC \nfacilities, and that they are eager to coordinate with every correctional facility to \nensure individuals have their contact number before or at release. We ask the Court \nto order the remaining sheriffs and DOC facilities to provide this flyer as well. \nB. This Court should order clearer, more detailed reporting. \nThis Court should clarify and expand the Respondents’ reporting obligations \nto ensure that, once tests have been conducted, the Petitioners and this Court will \nhave the information necessary to adequately monitor outbreaks at each facility, and \nlawyers will have the facts necessary to file informed motions for their clients. \n8 \n \n\nFirst, the Court should order facility-specific reporting by every Respondent, \njust as it has already done for the DOC. CPCS v. Chief Justice, 484 Mass. at 435, \n448 n.20. Without facility-specific information, it is impossible to assess which \nfacilities are testing for COVID-19, which ones have cases of the virus, and how \nmany people have been released from each facility. \nSecond, Respondents should be ordered to report in greater detail. At \npresent, the reporting does not consistently specify whether the numbers of positive \ncases include those who (a) are currently symptomatic, (b) have been moved to \noutside hospitals, (c) have recovered, or (d) are dead. This information should be \ndisclosed.13 Just as important, Respondents should be required to report deaths from \nall causes as well as those they attribute to COVID-19. Otherwise, individuals dying \nof COVID-19 might be overlooked simply because no one ever tested them.  \nII.  Staying sentences during the pandemic is both necessary and \npermissible. \n \nThe deadly coronavirus outbreak equally threatens pretrial detainees and \nsentenced DOC prisoners, yet this Court’s decision limited relief only to the former. \nThis ongoing threat requires this Court to reconsider its April 3 pronouncements \nconcerning stays of sentences and declare certain prisoners presumptively eligible for \nstays. Motion to Reconsider at 7-11. At least 176 DOC prisoners have had \n                                         \n13 See, e.g., Coppinger Aff, ¶12 (noting 38 reported positive cases and that “25 of \nthose inmates have already been design[ated] as ‘recovered’ by medical staff”). \n9 \n \n\nconfirmed COVID-19 cases, and at least seven have died. Yet, per the April 21 \nSpecial Master’s report, just 12 sentenced prisoners, eight pretrial detainees, and 127 \nparolees had been released from DOC custody since this Court’s April 3 decision. It \nis unclear how many were released because of the decision. But it is clear that the \npace of releases, particularly from the Parole Board, is not meeting the challenge. \nCommendably, the Parole Board is reportedly conducting more hearings, \nexpediting the review of home plans and required notifications, treating vulnerability \nto COVID-19 as a compelling reason to grant early parole, and significantly \nincreasing its decisions on change of vote requests, reconsideration, and appeals. \nParole Board Resp. at 2-6. And yet things are still not moving quickly. For example, \neven people who have been found suitable for parole, but whose receipt of a parole \npermit is contingent upon serving time in a minimum-security facility, are still being \nrequired to complete their time in minimum, even though the system-wide \nlockdown means that all prisoners, including those in minimum, are being detained \nin what amounts to solitary confinement. See Newman-Polk Aff. ¶¶4-9.  \nOther individuals deemed suitable for release on parole contingent upon the \ncompletion of programming remain incarcerated because no programming is \nhappening. Affidavit of Debra Beard Bader ¶5. Tragically, individuals deemed \nsuitable for release on parole have contracted the virus while awaiting action by the \nParole Board. Id. ¶11. In fact, the 127 parolees released as of April 21 represent less \n10 \n \n\nthan half of the 300 people who had already been deemed suitable for release and \nwere awaiting parole permits when this case was argued on March 31. Simply put, \neven though the Parole Board is considering the pandemic and moving faster than it \nhas in the past, prisoners who are suitable for release on parole are still having to \nwait far too long to get out. \nContrary to the arguments of several Respondents, staying sentences is a \npermissible life-saving alternative to the ongoing bottleneck.14 For starters, after \nPetitioners filed their motion for reconsideration, a putative class action raising \nconstitutional claims on behalf of all people who are incarcerated in Massachusetts \nprisons and jails has been reserved and reported to this Court. Foster v. Mici, SJC-\n12935. Even if it were true that separation of powers principles prohibit staying a \nsentence in the absence of a separate challenge to its legality, those principles could \nnot reasonably hinge on whether the challenge takes the form of an appeal, a new \ntrial motion, or a class action. Otherwise an injustice that plagues hundreds of \nsentenced individuals would be less likely to be addressed than an injustice that \naffects just one. \nRegardless, it is not true that separation of powers principles prohibit staying a \nsentence without a challenge to its legality. Plucking language from Commonwealth \n                                         \n14 Because Petitioners have no intention of seeking a stay without first confirming the \nclient wants a stay, the remedy does not pose any due process concerns. See DAO \nBr. at 8 n.10. \n11 \n \n\nv. McLaughlin, 431 Mass. 506 (2000), certain Respondents assert that a stay is \npossible only with a challenge to the underlying conviction. See, e.g., Opposing DAs \nResp. at 4-9. But the language from McLaughlin on which they rely involves this \nCourt’s statutory authority to grant stays. McLaughlin separately discusses the \nCourt’s inherent authority to issue stays that are not subject to the restrictions of Rule \n31. Id. at 518-519 (citing examples of stays where no challenge to underlying \nconviction). Acknowledging the judiciary’s ability to exercise this inherent power, id. \nat 520, McLaughlin cautioned that such stays were meant to confer “a true reprieve,” \nand should not to be used “for punitive purposes,” id. at 518. The clear implication \nof McLaughlin and Commonwealth v. Charles, 466 Mass. 63 (2013), is that courts \ncan indeed stay sentences under their inherent power, but only where justice \nrequires. See McLaughlin, 466 Mass. at 519-520 (acknowledging this authority \nwithout “delineat[ing] in detail the contours of trial judges’ inherent power to stay \nexecution of sentence”); Charles, 466 Mass. at 75 (holding “exceptional \ncircumstances warranted the judge’s exercise of his inherent power to stay the \nexecution of [the defendant’s] sentences pending the disposition of his motion for a \nnew trial”).  \nStaying sentences now would fall within these parameters, as it would be \npunitive not to permit prisoners to seek a stay during an outbreak that threatens to \n12 \n \n\nkill them.15 This Court has recognized that it would be contrary to “the interest of \njustice” for a defendant to serve a sentence that may be vacated due to government \nmisconduct. Charles, 466 Mass. at 74. Similarly, it is contrary to the interest of justice \nfor defendants to remain incarcerated to face the risk of infection and death while an \noutstanding lawsuit seeks their release for the duration of the pandemic. Pausing a \nsentence until the emergency has subsided ends that needless risk, and is thus \nsquarely within the inherent power of the judiciary. \nCONCLUSION \n  WHEREFORE, Petitioners respectfully request that this Honorable Court \nreconsider and modify its April 3 decision by:  \nA. Ordering additional testing and reporting by the DOC and sheriffs; \nB. Permitting all sentenced inmates to seek stays, and establishing a rebuttable \npresumption of a stay in certain categories of cases; \nC. Allowing individualized release decisions for those exposed to COVID-19; \nD. Expediting hearings on Rule 29 and stay motions; \n                                         \n15 Respondents also rely on Commonwealth v. Jackson, 369 Mass. 904 (1976), but \nthat case is inapposite. Opposing DAs Resp. at 7. In Jackson, the question was \nwhether the court could “defer imposition of sentence by means of probation, a \ncontinuance without a finding, or the filing of a case” where the statute imposed a \nmandatory minimum sentence and explicitly prohibited such dispositions. Id. at 920. \nHowever, a stay, which is just a pause, is not comparable to probation, a suspended \nsentence, or a continuance without a finding which would be in lieu of the \ncommitted time. \n13 \n \n\nE. Ordering further action and reporting by the Parole Board “to expedite parole \nhearings, to expedite the issuance of parole permits to those who have been \ngranted parole, to determine which individuals nearing completion of their \nsentences could be released on time served, and to identify other classes of \ninmates who might be able to be released by agreement of the parties.” CPCS \nv. Chief Justice, 484 Mass. at 436;  \nF.  Ordering all sheriffs and the DOC to hand out the attached flyer from Boston \nMedical Center; and \nG. Awarding all other relief deemed equitable and just. \n14 \n \n\nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n  /s/ Rebecca A. Jacobstein      /s/ Matthew R.

I am an attorney licensed to practice law in the Commonwealth of\nMassachusetts. For thirty years, I have represented indigent defendants\nand prisoners, civil and criminal.\n2. In the course of my professional work, I have represented several juvenile\nlifers who are eligible for parole pursuant to Diatchenko v. District\nAttorney for the Suffolk Dist., 466 Mass. 655 (2013).\n3. Two of my juvenile parole clients recently received positive parole\ndecisions declaring them rehabilitated and suitable for release, yet\nneither has been released. Both men contracted COVID19 after their\npositive parole orders and were/are hospitalized with complications.\n4. Delays between a positive a parole vote and actual release on parole are\nto be expected in ordinary times. But in the context of the COVID-19\npandemic, these delays have effectively prevented my clients from being\nreleased at all while risking their lives.\n5. One client (W52968) has been ordered to complete a program and serve a\nterm in minimum security before being released to his home plan. But,\ndue to the pandemic, everyone is locked down, no programming exists,\nand all reclassifications/transfers between facilities have stopped.\n\n6. I have learned that this client was hospitalized with COVID-19\ncomplications and has since been released back to the prison on a\nmedical unit with no hope of actual release.\n7. It is frustrating that this client’s release on parole is being held up\npending completion of conditions that are impossible under present\ncircumstances. I have made inquiries of the parole regarding this\nproblem but have received no reply.\n8. With respect to my other juvenile parole client (W32301), the parole\nboard issued a record of decision on March 23, 2020, granting him\nrelease on parole as soon as the District Attorney’s office notifies the\nparole board that the DA will not petition against him under G.L. c.123A.\n9. Although the parole board issued its record of decision on March 23,\n2020, the parole board did not send it to me for almost a month (April\n22), despite multiple requests.\n10. This client is 69 years old and has several pre-existing medical\nconditions involving his lungs and heart that leave him particularly\nvulnerable to the virus.\n11. During the month that it took the parole board to notify me of its\ndecision, an inmate who had just been discharged from the hospital for\nCOVID-19 was placed in my 69 year-old client’s cell. My client has now\ntested positive and is hospitalized, under DOC guard, with COVID-19\ncomplications.\n12. I have sent to the appropriate District Attorney’s office\ndocumentation together with reasons why this client is highly unlikely to\nmeet the probable cause standard for commitment as a sexually\ndangerous person under Chapter 123A.\n13. I have defended SDP petitions for over twenty years. I have also\nsupervised as CPCS counsel and as a bar advocate several dozen SDP\ndefense lawyers. I have direct experience with hundreds of SDP cases. I\nhave never seen anyone like my client -- who has a single juvenile sex\noffense, 52 years in prison, advanced age, and a remarkably positive\ninstitutional record -- face a civil commitment petition under G.L.\nc.123A; nor, have I ever heard of anything remotely similar.\n-2-\n\n14. The parole board has not informed me of what steps, if any, it has\ntaken to get the District Attorney to sign off on this client’s release on\nparole.\n15. In my experience, the parole board has not “expedited release” of\nthese “previously-approved individuals” since the SJC’s April 3 decision\nin Committee for Public Counsel Services v. Chief Justice of the Trial Court,\n484 Mass. 431, 452-453 & n.24 (2020).\nElectronically signed this 26th day of April, 2020.\n/s/ Debra Beard Bader\nDebra Beard Bader\nBBO 553375\nP.O.

SJC-12926 \n \n \n \nCOMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC COUNSEL SERVICES and \nMASSACHUSETTS ASSOCIATION OF  \nCRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYERS, \nPetitioners, \n \nv. \n \nCHIEF JUSTICE OF THE TRIAL COURT and others, \nRespondents. \n \nAFFIDAVIT OF DR. ELISA CHOI \n \nI, Dr. Elisa Choi, state that the following is a true and accurate statement to the best of my \nknowledge and belief: \n \n1.  I submit this declaration on my own behalf. The views expressed herein are my own \npersonal professional opinions, and do not represent the policies or opinions of any \norganizations with which I am affiliated. \n \n2.  I am a Board Certified physician in Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases, and the \nChief of the Internal Medicine department at Harvard Vanguard’s Somerville location. I \nalso have a faculty appointment at Harvard Medical School. I received my undergraduate \ndegree from Stanford University and my medical degree from the University of Medicine \nand Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark (now Rutgers New Jersey Medical School). I \ncompleted my internship, residency and fellowship at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical \nCenter. A copy of my CV is attached as Exhibit 1.  \n \n3.  In my professional capacity, I have been a front line physician caring for COVID-19 \npatients during the pandemic. As an infectious disease specialist, I have also closely \nfollowed the medical literature on COVID-19. \n \n4.  The current literature indicates that pre-symptomatic people—individuals who are already \ninfected with SARS-CoV2, the virus causing COVID-19, but have not yet begun to \nexperience symptoms—can still transmit COVID-19 infection to others. We also know that \nthere are some people who show little or very mild symptoms of the disease, yet they too \ncan transmit COVID-19 to others. We are now recognizing that pre-symptomatic \nindividuals, and those who have such mild symptoms that they do not even realize that they \n1 \n \n\nare infected with COVID-19, can significantly contribute to the transmission and spread of \nthe disease. \n \n5.  A strictly symptom-based testing protocol in congregate settings will miss individuals who \nare infected with COVID-19 but are either pre-symptomatic or have very mild symptoms \nwhich may not be recognized as requiring testing. In congregate settings like jails and \nprisons, there will be a percentage of individuals who are COVID-19 positive who will not \nbe diagnosed if the facility only tests individuals who exhibit “typical” COVID-19 \nsymptoms. As a result, a symptom-based testing protocol will not capture the true extent of \nthe disease within jails and prisons. \n \n6.  This failure is particularly dangerous in congregate settings like jails and prisons where \nsocial/physical distancing is difficult to achieve at current population levels. Under these \nconditions, pre-symptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals who remain undiagnosed in \na jail or prison can rapidly spread the disease to other people.  \n \n7.  You cannot contain what you do not know. In order to stop an outbreak, you need to first \nunderstand how many infections there are. A symptom-based testing protocol will not \nprovide complete information about how many infections are present. \n \n8.  I have read the declaration that Dr. Alysse Wurcel submitted in this case. See Sheriffs’ \nResp. Ex. A. Based on my review of Dr. Wurcel’s declaration, it is my understanding that \nmany, if not all, of the Massachusetts sheriffs are testing only symptomatic prisoners. You \nhave to test more broadly than this to know the extent of COVID-19 infections in \nMassachusetts jails and prisons. Any facility that is testing only symptomatic prisoners will \nnot have a complete picture of the number of positive COVID-19 cases in their facility. \n \n9.  I have reviewed the data supplied by the sheriffs and the Department of Correction in \nresponse to the Court’s April 3, 2020 order in this case. It is my understanding that as of \nApril 24, 2020, Dukes and Barnstable counties had not tested any prisoners in their jails. If \nyou have tested zero number of prisoners, you cannot say with any degree of certainty that \nthere are no infections among prisoners in a facility.  \n \n10. Based on my review, it is also my understanding that as of April 24, 2020, Bristol, \nHampden and Worcester were each reporting zero confirmed positive COVID-19 \nprisoners, while simultaneously reporting 7, 10 and 4 confirmed positive COVID-19 staff \nmembers, respectively. As of that date, Bristol had tested 14 of their 595 prisoners; \nHampden had tested 7 of their 783 prisoners, and Worcester had tested 13 of their 574 \nprisoners. Given the low number of tests they each have conducted under a symptomatic-\ntesting protocol and the existence of confirmed-positive staff members at each of these \nfacilities, it is my professional opinion that Bristol, Hampden and Worcester cannot be \ncertain that there are no COVID-19 infections amongst their incarcerated population.  \n \n11. From an epidemiological perspective, part of disease containment involves attempting to \nget ahead of an infection to try to prevent its spread. Along with social/physical distancing, \ntrying to understand who is infected as early as possible before there has been any \n2 \n \n\nsecondary transmission is key to controlling an epidemic. Within a congregate setting, a \nsymptom-based testing approach will not be able to fully capture the extent of the actual \nnumber of infections. As a result, this protocol will be inadequate to support COVID-19 \ncontainment efforts in preventing outbreak in Massachusetts jails and prisons.  \n \n12. My understanding is that Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) now \nrecommends that nursing home facilities using the DPH mobile-testing program “order \ntests for all residents and staff, NOT just symptomatic individuals.”1  \n \n13. The congregate setting of jails and prisons is similar to nursing homes, and presents much \nof the same heightened risks of COVID-19 transmission. \n \n14. Therefore, the same concerns that animate DPH’s recommendation that nursing homes \ntest asymptomatic residents suggest that jails and prisons should similarly expand their \ntesting protocol beyond symptomatic prisoners. It is reasonable to apply what is already \nbeing recommended by DPH in a very similar congregate setting of nursing homes to \nMassachusetts jails and prisons. Extrapolating from DPH’s recommendation, it is \nappropriate to pursue testing of all prisoners and staff in Massachusetts facilities, regardless \nof whether they are symptomatic.  \n \n[signature on the next page] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n1 Massachusetts COVID-19 Nursing Home, Rest Home, and ALR Mobile Testing Program, \nRevised Guidance: April 13, 2020.  \n3 \n \n\n\n\n \n \nUpdated: April 2020 \n \nName:          \nElisa I.

I am an attorney and I have been licensed to practice law in Massachusetts since 2006. I \npreviously worked as a lawyer in the public defender division of the Committee for Public Counsel \nServices (CPCS) and I currently have a solo law practice. \n \n2.

On June 17, 2019, the Parole Board (“Board”) granted parole to my client, Julio Nazario, \nstating that he had “demonstrated a level of rehabilitative progress that would make his release \ncompatible with the welfare of society.”1 In reaching this decision, the Board noted that Mr. \nNazario had “participate[d] in numerous programs” and had also “explained the emotional growth \nthat he experienced through programming, not only understanding his flaws, but in empathizing \nwith the damage he caused to the families of his victims.”2  \n \n5.   The Board further stated that before Mr. Nazario could be released, he must complete 18 \nmonths in lower security. Mr. Nazario transferred to minimum security at Northeastern \nCorrectional Center in Concord on September 24, 2019. While housed in minimum security, Mr. \nNazario has been rule-compliant, employed, and involved in programming. \n \n1 Parole Board Decision in the Matter of Julio Nazario, June 17, 2019.  \nhttps://www.mass.gov/doc/julio-nazario-life-sentence-decision/download \n2 Id. \n \n\n \n \n6.  On April 8, 2020, pursuant to 120 CMR 304, I filed a petition asking the Board to reduce \nMr. Nazario’s minimum security requirement from 18 months to six months in light of his good \nbehavior and the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic that has impacted Massachusetts particularly \nhard. I also provided details of a solid home plan where Mr. Nazario would be supported \nfinancially and emotionally by a highly educated and stable family. \n \n7.  On April 19, 2020, I received notice that Mr. Nazario’s minimum security requirement was \namended from 18 months to 12 months. This means that Mr. Nazario will not be released for \nanother five months and therefore is not alleviated of the current risks posed to him in a prison \nenvironment during this pandemic.  \n \n8.   In addition to the heightened risk of COVID-19 contraction in prison, Mr. Nazario has \nbeen subjected to solitary confinement since April 3, 2020, when the Department of Correction \n(DOC) instituted a system-wide lockdown, confining prisoners in their cells or dorms. Mr. Nazario \nhas been locked inside his cell for 23.5 hours a day. He (like many of my other clients housed in \ncells) is permitted out only for 30 minutes a day (or less) to take a shower and make a brief phone \ncall. He is not allowed outside for fresh air.  \n \n9.  As of this writing, the prisons are on lockdown for an indefinite period of time, and Mr. \nNazario has been subjected to confinement for 25 days and counting. \n \n10.   As a former mental health clinician in the DOC, I understand the limited options available \nto contain the spread of COVID-19 given the numbers of incarcerated people. I am concerned for \nboth staff and prisoners with regard to this potentially deadly disease and I appreciate that the \nsystem-wide lockdown is intended to save lives. At the same time, I am acutely aware of the \npsychological and physiological damage inflicted by prolonged solitary confinement. The current \nsituation where prisoners are locked in their cells and allowed on the tier for a maximum of 30 \nminutes a day is worse than “normal” solitary confinement used as punishment in the DOC where \nprisoners are permitted outside in a recreation cage for one hour per day. \n \n11.  The United Nations has declared that “[t]he use of solitary confinement can only be \naccepted in exceptional circumstances where its duration must be as short as possible and for a \ndefinite term that is properly announced and communicated.”3 Importantly, “[t]he adverse acute \nand latent psychological and physiological effects of prolonged solitary confinement constitute \nsevere mental pain or suffering.” For these reasons, the Special Rapporteur for the United Nations \nconcluded that “any imposition of solitary confinement beyond 15 days constitutes torture or cruel, \ninhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . . . .”4 \n \n12.  The reason for requiring prisoners granted parole to reside in minimum security before \nreturning to the community is to provide a transitional phase where there is no prison wall and less \n \n3 United Nations General Assembly, Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or \npunishment, Sixty-Sixth Session, p. 20. August 5, 2011. \nhttp://solitaryconfinement.org/uploads/SpecRapTortureAug2011.pdf \n4 Id. at 21. \n \n\n \nstructure. However, with the lockdown in response to the COVID-19 risk, Mr. Nazario is being \nsubjected to confinement more extreme than if he were housed in Massachusetts’s supermax \nprison (the Departmental Disciplinary Unit at MCI-Cedar Junction). In short, this is not preparing \nhim for the community and instead is inflicting harm.  \n \n13.  As a final note, Mr. Nazario appeared before the Board on June 21, 2018. He received the \ndecision a year later on June 17, 2019. It took over three months to transfer to minimum security. \nThus, at this time, Mr. Nazario has been in prison nearly 22 months since the Board assessed his \nsuitability for parole. \n \n  Signed under the pains and penalties of perjury this 27th day of April 2020. \n             \n                         \n              Lisa Newman-Polk \n              BBO #665570 \n \n\n \nImmediate linkage to \ntreatment with buprenorphine \n(Suboxone) or naltrexone \n(Vivitrol) by phone intake with \naddiction nurse and provider \nFor buprenorphine (Suboxone) \nassessment call or text: \n \nMonday to Friday, 8AM to 6PM: \nSusan Dickerman at 857-326-3285 \n \nAfter Hours: \nColleen LaBelle at 617-797-6712 ",

      "text": "Supreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth    Full Court:   SJC-12926      Filed: 4/21/2020 9:13 PM\nCOMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS \nSUPREME JUDICIAL COURT \n \n \nSuffolk, ss.                    SJC-12926 \n \n \nCOMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC COUNSEL SERVICES and \nMASSACHUSETTS ASSOCIATION OF  \nCRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYERS, \nPetitioners, \n \nv. \n \nCHIEF JUSTICE OF THE TRIAL COURT and others,  \nRespondents. \n \n \n \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR CIVIL CONTEMPT AGAINST  \nTHE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION  \nPURSUANT TO MASS. R. CIV. P. 65.3 \n \n \n  This Court has established a process for the expedited release of certain \nincarcerated people in light of an “urgent and unprecedented” pandemic. \nCommittee for Public Counsel Services v. Chief Justice of the Trial Court, 484 \nMass. 431, 445 (Apr. 3, 2020) (CPCS v. Chief Justice). To facilitate that process, the \nCourt required the Department of Correction (DOC) to provide the defense bar \nand the Special Master with detailed, daily reports, including facility-specific \ninformation from the DOC.  Id. at 445, 448 n.20, 456. \n1 \n \n\nIn key respects, that is not happening. The DOC’s reports in this litigation \nhave never included facility-specific information on the overall incarcerated \npopulation; the number of COVID-19 tests of incarcerated individuals; the number \nof COVID-19 tests of correctional officers, other staff, and contractors; or the \nnumber of people released as a result of the decision. Moreover, petitioners did not \nreceive daily reports over the weekends of April 11 to April 12, 2020, or April 18 \nthrough 20. Yet, on April 20, the DOC did report facility-specific information to \nmembers of the news media. Petitioners therefore bring this contempt action in \norder to enforce and confirm the DOC’s reporting obligations. The DOC should be \nordered to provide all missing data back to April 3 and to provide daily reports \nincluding facility specific information on weekdays, weekends, and holidays moving \nforward.1 \nThe DOC’s noncompliance with the court’s order \n1.  As part of its protocol for reducing population density and limiting the \nspread of COVID-19 in correctional facilities, this Court ordered that the DOC \n“shall” provide “the special master daily reports of inmate counts and rates of \nCOVID-19 cases at each facility, as explained in Appendix B.” CPCS v. Chief \nJustice, 484 Mass. at 445 (emphasis added); see also id. at 448 n.20 (same). \n                                                        \n1 Although Petitioners bring this action only against the DOC, the duty to provide \ndaily reports applies equally to the sheriffs. \n2 \n \n\n2.  The DOC has not done so. In the first week after this Court’s decision, \nthe DOC’s reports in this case did not provide any facility-specific data regarding the \nspread of COVID-19. Instead, it provided the overall numbers for the entire DOC \nsystem, making it impossible to assess testing, outbreaks, or releases in any single \nfacility. \n3.  Petitioners’ understanding is that the Special Master flagged this error \nfor the DOC after Petitioners raised this problem with the Special Master.  \n4.  The following Monday, April 13, the DOC provided some facility-\nspecific information for the first time,2 in the following form: \n \n5.  Although this chart provides some of the ordered information, it falls \nshort of satisfying the requirements of the Court’s order. Specifically, the document \n                                                        \n2 Under normal circumstances, a 10-day delay may not be unreasonable. But these \nare not normal circumstances. For reference, between the time of this Court’s \ndecision (April 3, 2020), and the time that DOC first provided at least some of the \nfacility-specific information that the decision ordered (April 13, 2020), cases of \nCOVID-19 in Massachusetts grew from 10,402 to 26,867, and the number of deaths \nspiked from 192 to 844. See Archive of COVID-19 cases in Massachusetts, \nhttps://www.mass.gov/info-details/archive-of-covid-19-cases-in-massachusetts. \n3 \n \n\nlists the number of COVID-19 positive incarcerated people in each DOC facility, \nbut it does not provide facility-specific numbers with respect to population, testing \namong incarcerated people, testing or confirmed cases among correctional staff, or \nreleases.  \n6.  Nor do the DOC’s submissions in this case make clear whether the \nreported COVID-19 numbers include, or do not include, people who have \nrecovered, people who have been sent to outside hospitals, or people who have \ndied. Petitioners, as well as defendants and defense lawyers across the \nCommonwealth, have been left to guess at what these reports mean. \n7.  Around the same time that Petitioners received this document, an \ninvestigative reporter at WGBH News tweeted the following image.3 \n                                                        \n3 See Jenifer McKim (@jbmckin), Tweet Dated April 13, 2020 @ 5:41 P.M., \nhttps://twitter.com/jbmckim/status/1249814890279247872. \n4 \n \n\n \n8.  This image, which appears to come from the DOC, provides a facility-\nspecific breakdown of confirmed prisoner cases, deaths, and staff-reported positive \ncases. The DOC did not provide this same information to Petitioners or this Court.  \n9.  On April 14, the DOC again provided Petitioners with facility-specific \ndata only with respect to COVID-19 positive incarcerated people, while the WGBH \nreporter tweeted an image with updated facility specific numbers for confirmed \nprisoner cases, deaths, and staff-reported positive cases.4 \n10.  On April 15, the DOC began reporting the number of staff positive \ncases per facility for the first time. It updated these numbers through April 17.   \n                                                        \n4 See Jenifer McKim (@jbmckin), Tweet Dated April 14, 2020 @ 5:30 P.M., \nhttps://twitter.com/jbmckim/status/1250174496889282568. \n5 \n \n\n11.  The DOC provided no daily reports to Petitioners over the weekend or \non Monday, April 20. This information was not provided to Petitioners until the \nevening of Tuesday, April 21. Yet, on April 20, the DOC apparently provided \nmembers of the news media with updated information. This information appears to \ninclude the following chart, which contains numerous details—including deaths due \nto COVID-19 and the number of incarcerated people who had recovered from the \nvirus—that the DOC has never included in its reports as part of this litigation:5 \n                                                        \n5 See Jenifer McKim (@jbmckin), Tweet Dated April 20, 2020 @ 5:53 P.M., \nhttps://twitter.com/jbmckim/status/1252354666874064899. See also Sarah \nBetancourt (@sweetadelinevt), Tweets Dated April 20, 2020 @ 5:43 P.M. and 5:47 \nP.M., https://twitter.com/sweetadelinevt/status/1252352334530670593?s=20 \n(reporting “Today’s counts” from the DOC); Deborah Becker (@wburdebbecker), \nTweet Dated April 20, 2020 @ 6:44 P.M., https://twitter.com/wburdebbecker/status/\n1252367541084676096?s=20 (“Massachusetts DOC reports 109 prisoner \ncoronavirus cases in 6 prisons. Four prisoners recovered. 62 Cases among DOC and \nvendor staff”). \n6 \n \n\n \nThe DOC is in civil contempt of this Court’s order \n12.  “‘Civil contempt is found where there is a clear and undoubted \ndisobedience of a clear and unequivocal command.’” Commonwealth v. One 1987 \nFord Econoline Van, 413 Mass. 407, 411 (1992), quoting Allen v. School Comm. of \nBoston, 400 Mass. 193, 194 (1987). Respondents have violated at least two such \nunambiguous directives here. \n13.  First, notwithstanding the clear and unequivocal terms of this Court’s \nApril 3, 2020 decision, the DOC has never provided the overall incarcerated \npopulation at each facility, the number of COVID-19 tests of incarcerated people at \neach facility, the number of COVID-19 tests of correctional officers, other staff, and \n7 \n \n\ncontractors at each facility, or the number of people released as a result of the \ndecision at each facility as mandated by the Court.  \n14.  The failure to furnish this facility-specific information during a growing \npandemic puts incarcerated people, prison staff, and the surrounding communities \nat greater risk from an outbreak. It prevents incarcerated people and their lawyers \nfrom giving complete information to courts about the spread of COVID-19 within \nthe Commonwealth’s prison system, which is highly pertinent to any request for \nrelease. And it prevents this Court, the Petitioners and the public from meaningfully \nassessing the impact of the April 3, 2020 Order at the facility level and evaluating any \nnecessary response “to further changes in this rapidly–evolving situation.” CPCS v. \nChief Justice, 484 Mass. at 453.   \n15.  Second, notwithstanding the clear and unequivocal terms of this Court’s \nApril 3, 2020 decision, Respondents have never provided daily reports during the \nweekend or over a holiday. In addition to failing to provide reports on April 18-20, \nRespondents did not provide any information during the weekend of April 11 \nthrough April 12. Petitioners’ understanding is that the Special Master excused \nRespondents from their reporting obligations during that weekend. \n16.  To the extent that Respondents’ failure to supply daily reports has been \nexcused by the Special Master, their actions are less blameworthy. But they are no \nless violations of the Court’s order requiring “daily” reports, CPCS v. Chief Justice, \n8 \n \n\n484 Mass. at 435, 448, 456, and they are no less an impediment to the work of \ngauging and addressing the scope of the outbreak in Massachusetts prisons, jails, and \nhouses of correction. \n17.  This failure causes delays and creates additional hurdles in the process \ncreated by the Court’s April 3 decision, as it prevents incarcerated people from filing \nfully-informed motions for release on Mondays that take into account current \nnumbers. \nRequested relief  \n18.  The DOC should be ordered to immediately provide to Petitioners \nboth cumulative data from the start of their daily reporting obligation on April 6, as \nwell as daily data going forward, in each of the following categories of data that this \nCourt has already ordered them to provide: \n  Inmate population, by facility; \n  Inmate tests, by facility; \n  Staff tests, by facility; and \n  Releases, by facility. \n19.  The DOC should be instructed that the “daily” reporting obligation \nordered by this Court is applicable through the weekend and on holidays. \n20.  Finally, particularly in light of the detailed charts that the DOC has \nbeen providing to members of the news media, the DOC should be instructed to \n9 \n \n\nreport its numbers in a comprehensible format. At the very least, this would entail \ndisclosing, for each incarcerated individual who has tested positive for COVID-19, \nwhether that individual has recovered, been sent to the hospital, or died. The \nundersigned counsel should not have to go on Twitter to find out what is really \nhappening inside the DOC.  \nWHEREFORE, Petitioners respectfully request that this Honorable Court: \nA. Issue a summons, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 65.3(d), ordering the DOC \nto appear before this Court for the purpose of a hearing on the merits; \nB. Petitioners respectfully request that the hearing be set at the Court’s \nearliest convenience given the exigencies of the situation; \nC. After a hearing, find the DOC civil contempt for failing to comply with this \nCourt’s April 3, 2020, order; \nD. Order the DOC to provide comprehensible and cumulative data, from the \nstart of the daily reporting obligation and going forward, including each of \nthe categories of data that it had already been ordered to provide by this \nCourt’s April 3 order, as well as the categories of data it has been reporting \nto the news media;  \nE. Order the DOC to provide reports every day, including weekends and \nholidays; and \nF.  Award all other relief deemed equitable and just. \n10 \n \n\n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n  /s/ Rebecca A.

The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has created\nenormous challenges for every aspect of our communities. While\nscientists are racing to discover whether any existing drugs can\nhelp to treat the virus and improve outcomes for critically ill\npatients, and others are working at top speed to develop a\nvaccine, currently there is no cure and no vaccine. Health care\nworkers on the frontlines of the epidemic are coming down with\nthe virus in much higher percentages than others, while surgical\nmasks and other basic protective equipment are in short supply,\nand hospitals with already close-to-capacity intensive care unit\nbeds confront the possibility of inadequate resources to care\nfor critically ill patients, such as lack of needed ventilators.\nEveryday life is heavily disrupted; most businesses, schools,\nand houses of worship are closed,3 while grocers, pharmacies, and\ndelivery services stretch to provide essential services to meet\nbasic needs, and families without paychecks worry about how to\nmeet those needs. The Centers For Disease Control (CDC)\nguidelines recommend that, to avoid exposure, individuals limit\ncontact with others, maintain a distance of at least six feet\nfrom other individuals if they are together, engage in frequent\n3 See Order Extending the Closure of Certain Workplaces and\nthe Prohibition of Gatherings of More than 10 People, COVID-19\nOrder 21 (Mar. 31, 2020), https://www.mass.gov/doc/march-31-\n2020-essential-services-extension-order [https://perma.cc/SU87-\nGTAV].\n\n4\nhandwashing, and clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces\ndaily in order to \"flatten the curve,\" i.e., to reduce the\nnumber of cases the beleaguered health care system must treat at\nany one time.\nOn March 10, 2020, the Governor declared a state of\nemergency to support the Commonwealth's response to the threat\nof COVID-19. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization\nformally declared the expanding spread of the COVID-19 virus a\nglobal pandemic. Since then, infections have spread alarmingly,\nrapidly, and at an increasing rate, both in Massachusetts and\nthroughout the world. In an attempt to mitigate the spread of\nthe disease, the Governor has imposed strict restrictions on\nmany aspects of everyday life, including closing business and\nschools and stringently restricting public and private\ngatherings. In the week between the filing of this petition and\noral argument, confirmed cases in the Commonwealth increased\nmore than eight-fold, from 777 cases to 6,620 cases.4\n4 Of course, during that same period, the number of people\ntested also has increased exponentially, as more laboratories\nhave begun processing tests. For example, in one day, March 26,\n2020, 5,570 more tests were processed by the Department of\nPublic Health than had been processed the previous day. Prior\nto that, between March 23 and 24, the number of residents tested\ndoubled in two days, from 6,004 to 13,749. According to the\nDepartment of Public Health, more than 46,000 people in the\nCommonwealth had been tested as of March 31, 2020, resulting in\n6,620 positive tests.\n\n5\nPursuant to its supervisory authority, this court has\nissued a series of orders with respect to court proceedings, new\nfilings, and trials, designed to \"protect the public health by\nreducing the risk of exposure to the virus and slowing the\nspread of the disease.\" As the health crisis has deepened, we\nhave been forced to limit physical access to our court houses to\naddress only \"emergency matters that cannot be resolved through\na videoconference or telephonic hearing, either because such a\nhearing is not practicable or because it would be inconsistent\nwith the protections of constitutional rights,\" and have\ndirected each trial court department to issue a standing order\nto determine what constitutes an emergency matter. Each trial\ncourt department subsequently has done so. We have emphasized,\nas well, that, \"[i]n criminal cases, where appropriate, a\ndefendant may ask the court for reconsideration of bail or\nconditions of release.\"\nThe petitioners, the Committee for Public Counsel Services\n(CPCS) and the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense\nLawyers (MACDL), bring our focus to the situation with respect\nto COVID-19 confronting individuals who are detained in jails\nand houses of correction pending trial, and individuals who have\nbeen convicted and are serving a sentence of incarceration in\nthe Commonwealth. To allow the physical separation of\nindividuals recommended by the CDC, the petitioners seek the\n\n6\nrelease to the community of as many individuals as possible as\nexpeditiously as possible, indeed, on the day of argument in\nthis case, according to one of them. They offer a number of\ndifferent legal theories under which a broad-scale release might\nbe accomplished.\nWe conclude that the risks inherent in the COVID-19\npandemic constitute a changed circumstance within the meaning of\nG. L. c. 276, § 58, tenth par., and the provisions of G. L.\nc. 276, § 557. To decrease exposure to COVID-19 within\ncorrectional institutions, any individual who is not being held\nwithout bail under G. L. c. 276, § 58A, and who has not been\ncharged with an excluded offense (i.e., a violent or serious\noffense enumerated in Appendix A to this opinion) is entitled to\na rebuttable presumption of release. The individual shall be\nordered released pending trial on his or her own recognizance,\nwithout surety,6 unless an unreasonable danger to the community\n5 The petitioners further request that this court vacate all\nbench warrants and order the trial courts to cease issuing new\nbench warrants; suspend all conditions of probation that would\nviolate the CDC's recommended physical distancing; and vacate\nprobation orders that would require immediate detention. Based\non the record and the affidavits before us, which suggest that\nactions already are happening to the extent consistent with\npublic safety, we decline to order further relief.\n6 Conditions of release may be imposed, consistent with\ncurrent limitations on probation supervision and global\npositioning system monitoring restrictions.\n\n7\nwould result, or the individual presents a very high risk of\nflight.\nThe special master previously appointed by this court in\nconjunction with this case will work at the county level with\neach relevant court to facilitate these hearings.7 The sheriffs\nof each county shall provide the special master daily census\nreports for each correctional institution, and the special\nmaster shall file weekly reports with this court, as detailed in\nAppendix B to this opinion, so that the court will be better\npositioned to respond to further changes in this rapidly-\nevolving situation. In addition, the Department of Correction\n(DOC) shall furnish the special master daily reports of inmate\ncounts and rates of COVID-19 cases at each facility, as\nexplained in Appendix B.\nWith respect to those individuals who are currently serving\nsentences of incarceration, absent a finding of a constitutional\nviolation, our superintendence power is limited. Those who have\nbeen serving sentences for less than sixty days may move to have\ntheir sentences revised or revoked under Mass. R. Crim. P. 29,\nas appearing in 474 Mass. 1503 (2016) (Rule 29). Those who are\n7 We acknowledge the extraordinary efforts of the special\nmaster, Brien T. O'Connor, who, together with his colleagues at\nRopes and Gray, LLP, already has worked tirelessly with the\nparties to draft a report and recommendation for our\nconsideration prior to argument in this case.\n\n8\npursuing appellate proceedings or a motion for a new trial may\nseek a stay of execution of sentence pursuant to Mass. R. A. P.\n6, as appearing in 481 Mass. 1608 (2019). See Commonwealth v.\nCharles, 466 Mass. 63, 83 (2013). Where there is no\nconstitutional violation, however, art. 30 of the Massachusetts\nDeclaration of Rights precludes the judiciary from using its\nauthority under Rule 29 to revise and revoke sentences in a\nmanner that would usurp the authority of the executive branch.\nRemoving any limitation on the time in which a motion to revise\nand revoke a sentence may be brought, however, would do\nprecisely that. See Commonwealth v. McCulloch, 450 Mass. 483,\n488 (2008), quoting Commonwealth v. McGuinness, 421 Mass. 472,\n476 n.4 (1995) (\"A judge may not interfere with the executive\nfunction of the parole board by using postconviction evidence in\nan order to revise and revoke\").\nTo afford relief to as many incarcerated individuals as\npossible, the DOC and the parole board are urged to work with\nthe special master to expedite parole hearings, to expedite the\nissuance of parole permits to those who have been granted\nparole, to determine which individuals nearing completion of\ntheir sentences could be released on time served, and to\nidentify other classes of inmates who might be able to be\n\n9\nreleased by agreement of the parties, as well as expediting\npetitions for compassionate release.8\nAs the petitioners have argued, and the respondents agree,\nif the virus becomes widespread within correctional facilities\nin the Commonwealth, there could be questions of violations of\nthe Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution and art. 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of\nRights; nonetheless, at this time, the petitioners themselves\nclarified in their reply brief and at oral argument that they\nare not raising such claims.\n1. Background. a. COVID-19 in jails and prisons. All\nparties agree that, for several reasons, correctional\ninstitutions face unique difficulties in keeping their\npopulations safe during this pandemic. First, confined,\nenclosed environments increase transmissibility. Maintaining\nadequate physical distance, i.e., maintaining six feet of\ndistance between oneself and others, may be nearly impossible in\nprisons and jails. Second, proper sanitation is also a\nchallenge; the petitioners have submitted affidavits from\n8 We acknowledge the amicus letters of the Boston chapter of\nBlack and Pink, Joseph Buckman and others, Citizens for Juvenile\nJustice, Dominick Donovan and others, the families of certain\nincarcerated loved ones, Massachusetts Office for Victim\nAssistance, Mental Health Legal Advisors Committee, Prisoners\nLegal Services, certain public health professionals, and Jose\nRivera.\n\n10\nDepartment of Public Health (DPH) officials stating that, during\nrecent routine inspections of Massachusetts correctional\ninstitutions (prior to the declaration of emergency), DPH\ninspectors discovered a concerning number of repeat\nenvironmental health violations.\nFinally, while many people who contract COVID-19 are able\nto recover without the need for hospitalization, those who\nbecome seriously ill from the virus may require hospitalization,\nintensive treatment, and ventilator support. Severe cases are\nmost likely to occur among the elderly and those with underlying\nmedical conditions. Those in prisons and jails have an\nincreased prevalence, relative to the general population, of\nunderlying conditions that can make the virus more deadly. The\nDOC and the petitioners agree that hundreds of those\nincarcerated in the Commonwealth suffer from chronic diseases,\nand nearly 1,000 incarcerated individuals are over sixty years\nof age.\nExperts warn that an outbreak in correctional institutions\nhas broader implications for the Commonwealth's collective\nefforts to fight the pandemic. First, the DOC has limited\ncapacity to offer the sort of specialized medical interventions\nnecessary in a severe case of COVID-19. Thus, as seriously ill\nindividuals are transferred from correctional institutions to\noutside hospitals, any outbreak in a correctional institution\n\n11\nwill further burden the broader health care system that is\nalready at risk of being overwhelmed. Second, correctional,\nmedical, and other staff enter and leave correctional\ninstitutions every day. Should there be a high concentration of\ncases, those workers risk bringing infections home to their\nfamilies and broader communities.\nb. Response to COVID-19 by courts and correctional\ninstitutions. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and\npursuant to orders of this court, the Superior Courts, the\nDistrict Courts, the Boston Municipal Court, and the Juvenile\nCourts remain open for in-person proceedings only for emergency\nmatters that cannot be resolved remotely.9 The courts are\ndeciding motions related to COVID-19, including motions for\nrelease and motions for bail reduction, via remote hearings or\nbased on the pleadings and without argument.10\n9 See Superior Court Standing Order 3-20 (Mar. 17, 2020);\nDistrict Court Standing Order 2-20 (Mar. 18, 2020); Boston\nMunicipal Court Standing Order 3-20; Juvenile Court Standing\nOrder 3-20 (Mar. 25, 2020). These emergency matters include\narraignments.\n10 The Superior Court has reported to this court that, as of\nMarch 25, 2020, fifty-one such motions were pending, twenty-\neight were denied, and nineteen were allowed in part or in full.\nThe Juvenile Court received twenty-five motions for release or\nbail reduction between March 14 and March 25. As of March 27,\n2020, ten had been allowed, five had been denied, and ten were\npending.\n\n12\nc. Commonwealth's response to COVID-19 crisis. The\ndistrict attorneys have taken various proactive steps in\nresponse to COVID-19 to reduce the incarcerated population. The\ndistrict attorneys for the Suffolk, northern, and northwestern\ndistricts have sought to identify detainees and inmates whom\nthey believe would be appropriate for release. The district\nattorney for the Berkshire district notes that her office has\nsought unsuccessfully from the sheriff in Berkshire County\ncensus information necessary in order to identify appropriate\ncandidates for release.\nAccording to affidavits by the DOC and the various\nsheriffs' offices that operate correctional facilities, they\nhave enacted screening procedures for all individuals entering\nthese facilities. Employees with symptoms or positive test\nresults are instructed to self-quarantine at home. New inmates\nand detainees also are screened for symptoms of COVID-19; those\nwithout symptoms are quarantined for fourteen days, and those\nwith symptoms are isolated.\nIndividual correctional institutions also have restricted\naccess to the facility only to essential staff. General\nvisitation is suspended,11 and transfers among facilities have\n11 Most correctional facilities have offered limited free\ntelephone calls as a replacement to visits by family and\nfriends.\n\n13\nbeen restricted or completely suspended. Group programming has\nbeen curtailed, and scheduling changes within facilities have\nbeen enacted to reduce the number of individuals simultaneously\noccupying shared spaces.\nThe availability of hygiene products also has been\nincreased. The DOC, the Attorney General, and the sheriffs\nreport that bar soap has been made available to all inmates and\ndetainees without charge. Hand sanitizer has been made\navailable in many locations. Inmates and detainees have been\ninstructed on techniques to reduce the spread of COVID-19.\nPersonal protective equipment, including masks, gowns, gloves,\nand goggles, are available to staff in correctional facilities.\nAll facilities are below their maximum capacities, based on\n\"operational capacity\" as designated by the DOC.12 The prison\nsystem as a whole is at seventy-three per cent capacity; the\nmost crowded facility is the North Central Correctional\n12 \"Operational capacity\" differs from \"design capacity.\"\nOperational capacity is based on guidelines issued by the\nAssociation of State Correctional Administrators. Design\ncapacity is measured by the DOC and reported upon by the\nGovernor quarterly, pursuant to St. 1985, c. 799, § 21. See,\ne.g., Governor, Quarterly Report on the Status of Prison\nCapacity, Second Quarter 2019 (July 2019), https://archives.lib\n.state.ma.us/bitstream/handle/2452/807941/on1124679772-2019-\n2.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y [https://perma.cc/AL5Z-67QT].\n\n14\nInstitution, at ninety-five per cent of capacity.13 Jails and\nhouses of correction are operating, on the whole, at fifty-six\nper cent capacity.14 The Norfolk County house of correction, at\nninety-six per cent occupancy, is the closest to capacity.\nAs of April 1, 2020, there were three correctional\nfacilities with confirmed cases of COVID-19 among inmates; the\nmajority were at the Massachusetts Treatment Center (treatment\ncenter). Seventeen members of the treatment center's\npopulation, one inmate at another DOC facility, two inmates who\nhad been in close contact at a county jail, and three staff\n13 All prisons except the Souza-Baranowski Correctional\nCenter, which houses largely inmates serving life sentences,\ncurrently are operating at above fifty per cent of capacity.\nOccupancy rates in men's prisons are as follows:\nMassachusetts Correctional Institution (MCI), Cedar Junction\n(maximum security), 64%; Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center,\n41%; Massachusetts Treatment Center, 84%; MCI, Cedar Junction,\n86%; MCI, Concord, 78%; MCI, Norfolk, 85%; MCI, Shirley, 89%;\nNorth Central Correctional Institution, Gardner, 95%; Old Colony\nCorrectional Center (OCCC), 92%; Shattuck Correctional Unit,\n79%; State Hospital at Bridgewater, 74%; Massachusetts Alcohol\nand Substance Abuse Center at Plymouth, 57%; MCI, Shirley\n(minimum security), 84%; OCCC (minimum security), 64%; Boston\nPre-Release, 55%; North Eastern Correctional Center, Concord,\n68%; and Pondville Correctional Center, 78%. For women's\nprisons, occupancy rates are as follows: MCI Framingham, 37%;\nand South Middlesex Correctional Center, 31%.\n14 Based on operational capacity, the county houses of\ncorrection have the following rates of occupancy: Barnstable\nCounty, 38%; Berkshire County, 36%; Bristol County, 55%; Dukes\nCounty, 28%; Essex: County, 77%; Franklin County, 52%; Hampden\nCounty, 51%; Hampshire County, 67%; Middlesex County, 54%;\nNorfolk County, 96%; Plymouth County, 51%; Suffolk County, 50%;\nand Worcester County, 62%.\n\n15\nmembers at two other facilities had tested positive; six\nadditional individuals had symptoms of COVID. Three inmates\nwere at hospitals, and the rest were housed in an isolated unit\nor the health services unit at the treatment center.\nCorrectional facilities report that they have developed\nplans in the event of a wider outbreak within their facilities,\nbased on CDC and DPH guidelines. At least some of these plans\ncontain contingencies for staffing shortages. For the most\npart, details on these plans have not been made available in the\nrecord or at argument before this court.\nd. COVID-19 response in other jurisdictions. In response\nto the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of State courts throughout\nthe country have instituted various forms of relief in order to\nreduce the number of incarcerated individuals in their States.\nThe Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of South Carolina, for\nexample, issued a memorandum to all judges and court staff\ndirecting that \"[a]ny person charged with a non-capital crime\nshall be ordered released pending trial on his own recognizance\nwithout surety, unless an unreasonable danger to the community\nwill result or the accused is an extreme flight risk.\" The\nSupreme Court of Washington issued an order that, among other\nmeasures, declares that the COVID-19 pandemic shall be presumed\nto be a \"material change in circumstances\" for the purposes of\nsuch motions for bail review if the individual has been\n\n16\nidentified as part of a vulnerable or at-risk population by the\nCDC, and that the pandemic may constitute a material change in\ncircumstances and \"new information\" for all others seeking\namendment of a prior bail order. The order designates as\npriority matters all motions for pretrial release and bail\nmodification, as well as plea hearings and sentencing hearings\nthat will result in the anticipated release of a defendant\nwithin thirty days of the hearing.\nThe Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Michigan issued\nan order and further guidance instructing judges to \"take into\ncareful consideration\" the present state of the COVID-19\nemergency in making pretrial release decisions, including\nsetting bail and conditions of release or probation,. The Chief\nJustice later issued a statement directing that judges should\nrelease \"far more people on their own recognizance\" and \"should\nuse probation and treatment programs as jail alternatives.\" The\nstatement called on judges and sheriffs to \"use the statutory\nauthority they have to reduce and suspend jail sentences for\npeople who do not pose a public safety risk,\" and urged that\n\"law enforcement should only arrest people and take them to jail\nif they pose an immediate threat to people in the community.\"\nThe Supreme Court of New Jersey ordered mediation in\nresponse to a petition from the State's Office of the Public\nDefender. The mediation resulted in a consent order that\n\n17\nsuspends or commutes county jail sentences for low-risk inmates\nin light of the public health crisis, unless a State or county\nprosecutor objects to the release of a particular individual.\nIf there is such an objections, a judge or special master will\nhold a hearing to determine if release would pose a significant\nrisk to the safety of the inmate or the public.\n2. Relief sought. All parties agree that a significant\nCOVID-19 outbreak in Massachusetts correctional institutions\nwould pose considerable risks to those who are incarcerated,\ncorrectional staff, and the broader community. They disagree\nsignificantly about current conditions in correctional\ninstitutions, whether widespread release for some populations\nwould be more harmful than beneficial, and the proper means by\nwhich to reduce the number of people held in custody, before\ntrial and after conviction.\na. Petitioners' arguments. The petitioners ask this court\nto use its extraordinary superintendence power under G. L.\nc. 211, § 3, to take a number of unprecedented steps to reduce\nthe number of people held in Massachusetts correctional\nfacilities, both pretrial and postsentence. These actions, they\ncontend, are necessary practically, to save lives, and legally,\nto prevent what could become substantial and widespread\nviolations of constitutional rights.\n\n18\nSpecifically, the petitioners' brief describes potential\nthreats to the rights of those held in State custody to be free\nfrom cruel and unusual punishment, embodied in the Eighth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution, and cruel or\nunusual punishment prohibited by art. 26. Those provisions\nrequire the Commonwealth to furnish conditions of confinement\nthat do not create an unreasonable risk of future harm to inmate\nhealth and safety, an obligation the petitioners argue is\neffectively impossible to meet under conditions of global\npandemic.\nThe petitioners argue as well that inaction could violate\nrights to due process of law, inscribed in the Fourteenth\nAmendment, and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of\nRights. For pretrial detainees, the petitioners contend that\nthe risk of infection and death constitutes punishment prior to\nadjudication, which is not reasonably related to a legitimate\ngovernment interest, and therefore is inconsistent with due\nprocess. For those who have been convicted and sentenced, the\npetitioners argue that due process protections are violated when\nthe deprivations suffered are \"qualitatively different from the\npunishment characteristically suffered by a person convicted of\ncrime.\" Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 493 (1980). Because the\nsubstantial threat of infection, serious illness, and death is\nnot part of the sentence imposed on anyone in the Commonwealth,\n\n19\nthe petitioners contend that inaction would constitute\nadditional punishment without due process of law.\nIn their reply brief, and at argument before us, the\npetitioners state that they are not raising any constitutional\nclaim at this time, and rather are pointing out the possibility\nof such violations if something is not done to mitigate the\nsituation. The petitioners ask this court to reduce drastically\n(they suggest by a factor of one-half of the population\ncurrently held in custody) the number of individuals entering\ndetention, held pretrial on unaffordable bail, and serving\nlawful sentences. They propose specific measures with respect\nto preventing individuals from entering State custody,15\nreleasing those who are detained prior to trial,16 and reducing\n15 To reduce the flow of individuals into the correctional\nsystem, the petitioners ask this court to: (1) order that risks\nassociated with a COVID-19 outbreak be considered in bail\nhearings, probation revocation hearings, and determinations of\ndangerousness under G. L. c. 276, § 58A; (2) vacate bench\nwarrants related to fines and fees; (3) vacate conditions of\nprobation that automatically trigger probation violation\nproceedings upon an alleged violation; and (4) suspend pretrial\nand probation conditions incompatible with social distancing.\n16 For individuals being detained prior to trial, the\npetitioners seek the release of those held on unaffordable bail;\nheld on a bail revocation for a technical violation of\nprobation; those over sixty years of age; and those who have\nunderlying health conditions that heighten their risk.\n\n20\nsentences, staying sentences, or paroling certain groups of\nindividuals who are serving a sentence of imprisonment.17\nTo accomplish this latter set of releases, the petitioners\nsuggest that this court amend Mass. R. Crim. P. 29, which allows\njudges to revise sentences within sixty days of imposition \"if\nit appears that justice might not have been done,\" to eliminate\nthe sixty-day time limit, so that judges, including the single\njustice of this court, thereby lawfully could reduce sentences\ndue to COVID-19. Alternatively, they ask the court simply to\norder the releases using its purported authority under G. L.\nc. 211, § 3.\nb. Respondents' arguments. While acknowledging the\nserious nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the respondents take\nvarying positions in response to it and the petitioners'\narguments. To begin, they do not agree as to whether relief\nunder G. L. c. 211, § 3, is appropriate. The district attorneys\nof the northern, northwestern, Suffolk, and Berkshire districts\n17 The petitioners ask this court to order the release of\nthose serving sentences who are (1) eligible for parole and not\nserving a sentence for an offense under G. L. c. 265; (2) set to\nbe released within six months; (3) reincarcerated after\nviolations of parole or probation that did not involve a new\noffense; (4) over sixty years of age and not serving a sentence\nfor an offense defined in G. L. c. 265; (5) suffering from a\npreexisting condition that heightens their risk of death from\nthe virus; (6) eligible for medical parole; or (7) serving\nsentences in a house of correction for offenses other than those\nlisted in G. L. c. 265.\n\n21\nagree with the petitioners that the risk of this pandemic is an\nunprecedented, deadly threat to incarcerated individuals,\ncorrectional officers, and civilian staff, and that\nextraordinary action is needed to address this rapidly-growing\npublic health emergency expeditiously. The Attorney General\nstates that government officials within and outside the\ncorrectional system are committed to taking the steps necessary\nto protect the health and welfare of everyone within the\ncriminal justice system, while acknowledging that the situation\nis rapidly evolving and that extraordinary relief under this\ncourt's superintendence powers may be appropriate in some\ncircumstances.\nThe district attorneys for the Bristol, Cape & Islands,\neastern, Hampden, middle, Norfolk, and Plymouth districts (seven\ndistrict attorneys) state that they \"are committed to taking\nappropriate steps consistent with public safety to mitigate the\nrisks of infection in jails and prisons\" for inmates and\ncorrectional staff, and that \"such measures are already\nunderway.\" They assert that judges have been advised to take\ninto account, and are doing so, COVID-19 risks in making bail\ndeterminations and deciding issues involving pretrial detention,\ncourt houses are staffed to handle and act upon all emergency\nmotions for release, and correctional officials are acting\n\n22\npromptly and allowing \"meritorious petitions for release based\non medical vulnerability.\"\nThe seven district attorneys maintain as well that the\npetitioners' arguments disregard risks to public safety,\nparticularly the physical and mental safety of victims and their\nfamilies, especially victims of domestic violence, in addition\nto abrogating rights granted under the victims' bill of rights\nset forth in G. L. c. 253B. They contend that immediate release\nof some medically vulnerable individuals could pose a greater\nrisk to the individual than remaining incarcerated with\navailable medical care and treatment. They point out that\nseventy-three per cent of incarcerated males, and sixty-four per\ncent of incarcerated females are serving a sentence for a\nviolent offense, and that their release into the community,\nparticularly given the reduced levels of supervision currently\navailable, where most supervision is by telephone and not in\nperson, increases risks to the community and could overburden\nalready overworked criminal justice systems.\nThe seven district attorneys also argue that relief under\nG. L. c. 211, § 3, is inappropriate, for several reasons. They\ncontend that the petitioners have not shown that existing\navenues of relief are inadequate. See Callahan v. Superior\nCourt Dep't of the Trial Court, 432 Mass. 1023, 1023 (2000).\nThey argue as well that the relief requested by the petitioners\n\n23\nis not available under G. L. c. 211, § 3, because the\npetitioners do not have standing to bring an individual claim\nunder that statute. See Slama v. Attorney Gen., 384 Mass. 620,\n624 (1981) (\"Representative standing is generally limited to\ncases in which it is difficult or impossible for the actual\nrightholders to assert their claims\"). In addition, they assert\nthat the relief sought by the petitioners would amount to a\nsuspension of laws, in violation of art. 30, and would be an\nattempt to exert this court's superintendence power over the\nexecutive branch, in violation of art. 30. See Commonwealth v.\nDonohue, 452 Mass. 256, 264 (2008). They argue as well that the\npetitioners are asking this court impermissibly to abrogate the\nprovisions of numerous statutes on parole, revocation,\ncommutation, compassionate release, and pardons. Similarly, the\nsheriffs' offices argue that the petitioners cannot obtain\nrelief because they have not exhausted the administrative remedy\nof the grievance processes of the penal institutions. See G. L.\nc. 127, § 38F; 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).\nThe respondents also disagree on the substantive merits and\nthe putative constitutional claims. The district attorney for\nthe Suffolk district agrees with the petitioners that COVID-19\ncreates a situation in which the \"evolving standards of decency\nthat mark the progress of a maturing society\" have been altered\nby COVID-19. See Michaud v. Sheriff of Essex County, 390 Mass.\n\n24\n523, 527 (1983). She states that appropriate physical\ndistancing is impossible in a correctional facility, and that\ncontinued incarceration will constitute cruel and unusual\npunishment for some individuals.\nNeither the Attorney General nor the district attorneys for\nthe northern, northwestern, or Berkshire districts take a\nposition on whether any constitutional rights would be violated.\nThe district attorney for the Berkshire district adds that \"all\nof the experts and government officials in Massachusetts have\nopined or suggested that the only hope of . . . reducing the\nnumber of deaths caused by COVID-19\" is physical distancing and\nfrequent handwashing and cleaning, which she states is\n\"impracticable\" in jails and prisons.\nThe seven district attorneys and the sheriffs argue that\nthe Eighth Amendment and art. 26 claims lack merit because the\npetitioners have not shown \"deliberate indifference\" on the part\nof any prison or jail official. See Torres v. Commissioner of\nCorrection, 427 Mass. 611, 613–614 (1998). They support this\nargument with affidavits from the DOC and the various sheriffs,\ndetailing the steps taken by the correctional institutions to\naddress the COVID-19 pandemic, summarized supra.\nBased on their substantive and factual disagreements, the\nrespondents propose contrasting dispositional requests. The\nseven district attorneys and the sheriffs ask that the petition\n\n25\nbe denied in its entirety. They argue that the steps already\nbeing taken towards reducing the population of incarcerated\nindividuals are sufficient to address the advancing public\nhealth emergency.\nThe remaining district attorneys and the Attorney General\nask that this court grant relief in the form of individualized\nreview, with the goal of quickly reducing the incarcerated\npopulation. They do not approve of the blanket release of\nclasses of inmates, noting, as do the seven district attorneys,\nthe public safety concerns regarding the release of those\nconvicted of domestic violence or sexual assault; the dangers to\nreleased inmates and detainees who may not have a home, a\nmedical provider, or a means to obtain substance abuse\ntreatment; and the currently decreased availability of shelters\nand other social services. The district attorneys for the\nSuffolk, northern, northwestern, and Berkshire districts ask\nthat we create an emergency committee responsible for rapidly\nand collaboratively creating and implementing a policy to reduce\nthe incarcerated population. The district attorney for the\nSuffolk district argues that COVID-19 should be considered in\nvarious types of judicial decisions, and further requests that\nnew bench warrants not issue for failure to appear or failure of\nindigent defendants to pay fines or fees. The Attorney General\nsuggests that we establish guidelines for the release of\n\n26\npretrial detainees, and that we explore ways to allow relief for\nsentenced inmates, such as an amendment to Mass. R. Crim. P. 29.\n3. Discussion. We agree that the situation is urgent and\nunprecedented, and that a reduction in the number of people who\nare held in custody is necessary. We also agree with the\nAttorney General and the district attorneys that the process of\nreduction requires individualized determinations, on an\nexpedited basis, and, in order to achieve the fastest possible\nreduction, should focus first on those who are detained pretrial\nwho have not been charged with committing violent crimes.\nHaving carefully examined the petitioners' arguments, we\nconclude that a modification of Rule 29 in the manner requested\nby the petitioners, such that judges could revise and revoke\nindefinitely valid sentences that have been imposed posttrial\nwould result in a violation of art. 30 by allowing judges\nessentially to perform the functions of the parole board. See,\ne.g., Commonwealth v. Ly, 450 Mass. 16, 22, (2007); Commonwealth\nv. Amirault, 415 Mass. 112, 116-117 (1993). Absent a violation\nof constitutional rights, which the petitioners agree has not\nbeen established on this record, we also do not have authority\nunder G. L. c. 211, § 3, to exercise supervision over parole,\nfurlough, or clemency decisions by the DOC, the parole board,\nthe sheriffs, and other members of the executive branch.\n\n27\na. The court's superintendence authority. General Laws\nc. 211, § 3, provides that the Supreme Judicial Court \"shall\nhave general superintendence of all courts of inferior\njurisdiction to correct and prevent errors and abuses therein if\nno other remedy is expressly provided.\" The court's general\nsuperintendence authority extends to \"the administration of all\ncourts of inferior jurisdiction,\" and permits the issuance of\n\"writs, summonses and other process and such orders, directions\nand rules as may be necessary or desirable for the furtherance\nof justice.\" In the past, we have exercised our extraordinary\nsuperintendence authority to remedy matters of public interest\n\"that may cause further uncertainty within the courts\"\n(quotations omitted). Simmons v. Clerk-Magistrate of the Boston\nDiv. of the Hous. Court Dep't, 448 Mass. 57, 61 (2006). See\nBridgeman v. District Attorney for the Suffolk District, 471\nMass. 465, 474 (2015) (court utilized broad powers of\nsuperintendence to address drug lab crisis affecting thousands\nof potential defendants); Lavallee v. Justices in the Hampden\nSuperior Court, 442 Mass. 228, 239 (2004) (relief under G. L.\nc. 211, § 3, is necessary to remedy shortages of attorneys to\nrepresent indigent defendants).\nA petitioner seeking relief under G. L. c. 211, § 3, \"must\npresent a substantial claim involving important substantive\nrights, and demonstrate that any error cannot adequately be\n\n28\nremedied in the course of trial or normal appellate review.\"\nLavallee, 442 Mass. at 233. See Costarelli v. Commonwealth, 374\nMass. 677, 679 (1978) (discretionary review under court's\nsupervisory authority is \"extraordinary\" and only available \"in\nthe most exceptional circumstances\"). Here, the petitioners\nclaim that continued confinement in a jail or prison implicates\nconcerns of fundamental fairness, and rights secured by the due\nprocess clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions (pretrial\ndetainees) and the Eighth Amendment (inmates serving a sentence\nand pretrial detainees).\nb. Pretrial detainees. We conclude, given the severity of\nthe COVOID-19 pandemic, that the petitioners, as representatives\nof incarcerated individuals, have established standing to bring\ntheir claim, and an entitlement to relief. To establish\nrepresentative standing, \"[f]irst, the relationship of the\nlitigant to the third party whose right the litigant seeks to\nassert must be such that the enjoyment of the right is\ninextricably bound up with the activity the litigant wishes to\npursue. Second, there must be some genuine obstacle that\nrenders the third party unable to assert the allegedly affected\nright on his or her own behalf.\" Planned Parenthood League of\nMassachusetts, Inc. v. Bell, 424 Mass. 573, 578 (1997), citing\nSingleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 113-118 (1976).\n\"Representative standing is generally limited to cases in which\n\n29\nit is difficult or impossible for the actual rightholders to\nassert their claims\" (citation omitted). Slama v. Attorney\nGen., 384 Mass. 620, 624 (1981). Here, the relationship between\nthe petitioners and the detainees and incarcerated individuals,\nnow focused on having their clients released from custody,\nclearly is \"inextricably bound up with the activity the litigant\nwishes to pursue,\" e.g., obtaining release through litigation in\nthis court. In the present circumstances, it is difficult, at\nbest, for incarcerated individuals to assert their claims; in\nparticular, the enormous volume of claims, the urgency of\nexpeditious hearings, the delays multiple individuals and\nattorneys have averred are occurring in holding hearings on\nmotions for release, and the apparent belief by some trial\njudges that they have no authority to allow reconsideration of\nbail because detainees have not shown changed circumstances, all\nplace severe obstacles in the path of any individual detainee\nseeking relief.\nTo effectuate such relief, pretrial detainees who are not\ncharged with an offense listed in Appendix A, and who are not\nbeing held without bail subsequent to a determination of\ndangerousness under G. L. c. 276, § 58A, as well as individuals\nwho are being held pending a final probation violation hearing,\nare entitled to expedited hearings on their motions for\nreconsideration of bail. These categories of pretrial detainees\n\n30\nshall be ordered released on personal recognizance unless the\nCommonwealth establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence,\nthat release would result in an unreasonable danger to the\ncommunity or that the individual presents a very high risk of\nflight.18\nIn making a determination whether release would not be\nappropriate, the judge should consider the totality of the\ncircumstances, including (1) the risk of the individual's\nexposure to COVID-19 in custody; (2) whether the defendant,\nalthough not held in preventative detention pursuant to G. L.\nc. 276, § 58A, nonetheless would pose a safety risk to the\nvictim and the victim's family members, witnesses, the\ncommunity, or him- or herself if released; (3) whether the\ndefendant is particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 due to a\npreexisting medical condition or advanced age; (4) for a\ndefendant who is accused of violating a condition of probation,\nwhether the alleged violation is a new criminal offense or a\ntechnical violation; and (5) the defendant's release plan.19\n18 This ruling does not preclude other pretrial detainees,\nwho have been charged with one of the excluded offenses\nenumerated in Appendix A, from seeking reconsideration of bail\non the ground of changed circumstances, which we have concluded\nexist as a matter of law. These individuals, however, are not\nentitled to a rebuttable presumption of release.\n19 Of course, those individuals who have tested positive or\nare symptomatic for COVID-19, or who are in quarantine due to\nhaving been in close contact with someone else who has tested\n\n31\ni. Process to be followed. Each sheriff in charge of a\nhouse of correction shall inform the special master, CPCS, the\ndistrict attorney for the district in which the institution is\nlocated, the clerks of the Superior, District, Boston Municipal,\nand Juvenile courts in that district, and the probation service\ndaily of the identity of each person who is detained awaiting\ntrial in the sheriff's facility, in reports setting forth the\ninformation specified in Appendix B.20 The defense bar and the\ndistrict attorney in each district shall make good faith efforts\nto reach agreement with respect to the release of as many\npretrial detainees as possible, so that agreed-upon motions for\nreconsideration of bail may be presented to trial court judges.21\nBased on the daily census reports to be provided by the\nsheriffs, CPCS shall facilitate the filing of any motions for\nreconsideration of the amount of bail or conditions of release,\nincluding contacting counsel for each detainee. Defense counsel\nshall be permitted promptly to convene video or teleconferences\nwith their clients; the sheriffs' offices and DOC are to work\npositive, must remain in isolation or quarantine and would not\nbe eligible for release during those periods.\n20 In addition, the DOC shall furnish the special master\ndaily reports of inmate counts and rates of COVID-19 cases at\neach facility, as explained in Appendix B.\n21 Upon request by a defendant, the sheriffs also are\nrequired timely to provide the defendant with his or her\nrequested medical records.\n\n32\nwith the defense bar to facilitate such communications. The\ndistrict attorneys should make every effort to inform any victim\nof the motion, to be consistent with statutory requirements, to\nthe extent practical. In light of the public health emergency\nposed by COVID-19, the inability of the Commonwealth to provide\nthe type of notice called for by the victims' rights statute,\nG. L. c. 258B, shall not be grounds for the continued detention\nof a detainee otherwise entitled to release in accordance with\nthis decision.\nHearings on motions for reconsideration of bail will take\nplace by videoconference or teleconference no later than two\nbusiness days after the filing of the motion. A decision on the\nmotion shall be rendered promptly. To enable expeditious\nprocessing of such motions, each relevant court shall establish\na designated session to hear motions for reconsideration of bail\nand release; a primary judge, a first backup, and a second\nbackup judge shall be assigned to each session. Individuals who\nare aggrieved by the denial of a motion for reconsideration of\nbail may seek review under G. L. c. 211, § 3, from the single\njustice of the county court.\nc. New arrests. We are persuaded that the limitations\nthat courts in other jurisdictions have placed on new detentions\nand incarcerations are compelling, and we adopt similar measures\nto reduce as far as possible the influx of new individuals into\n\n33\ncorrectional institutions. Following any arrest during the\nCOVID-19 state of emergency, and until further order of this\ncourt, a judicial officer should consider the risk that an\narrestee either may contract COVID-19 while detained, or may\ninfect others in a correctional institution, as a factor in\ndetermining whether bail is needed as a means to assure the\nindividual's appearance before the court. Given the high risk\nposed by COVID-19 for people who are more than sixty years of\nage or who suffer from a high-risk condition as defined by the\nCDC, the age and health of an arrestee should be factored into\nsuch a bail determination. This is an additional, temporary\nconsideration beyond those imposed by the relevant bail\nstatutes, G. L. c. 276, §§ 57 and 58, and by due process\nprinciples. See Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 702-705\n(2017); Querubin v. Commonwealth, 440 Mass. 108, 113-114 (2003).\nA judge also must consider the same factors in deciding whether\nto detain an individual pending a revocation hearing based on an\nalleged violation of probation.\nd. Incarcerated individuals serving sentences. The\npetitioners also seek release of multiple groups of individuals\nwho are currently serving sentences of incarceration. They\nsuggest, inter alia, that, in order to do so, we eliminate the\nrequirement in Rule 29 that motions to revise or revoke a\nsentence be filed within sixty days of the imposition of the\n\n34\nsentence or the issuance of the rescript. See Mass. R. Crim.\nP. 29 (a) (2).\n\"As a general matter, Massachusetts courts have recognized\nthat 'it is within the inherent authority of a trial judge to\n\"reconsider decisions made on the road to final judgment.\"'\"\nCommonwealth v. Charles, 466 Mass. 63, 83 (2013), quoting\nHerbert A. Sullivan, Inc. v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., 439 Mass. 387,\n401 (2003). See Commonwealth v. Cronk, 396 Mass. 194, 196,\n(1985), and cases cited (\"While the Massachusetts Rules of\nCriminal Procedure do not expressly permit a judge to rehear a\nmatter, no policy prohibits reconsideration of an order or\njudgment in appropriate circumstances\"). That authority is\nlimited once final judgment has entered.\nOur broad power of superintendence over the courts does not\ngrant us the authority to authorize courts to revise or revoke\ndefendants' custodial sentences, to stay the execution of\nsentence, or to order their temporary release unless a defendant\n(1) has moved under Mass. R. Crim. P. 29, within sixty days\nafter imposition of sentence or the issuance of a decision on\nall pending appeals, to revise or revoke his or her sentence,\n(2) has appealed the conviction or sentence and the appeal\nremains pending, or (3) has moved for a new trial under Mass. R.\nCrim. P. 30.\n\n35\nRule 29 allows revisions of a final sentence within sixty\ndays of its issuance or sixty days of the issuance of a decision\non any appeal from the sentence or from the underlying\nconviction. Rule 29 \"recognizes that '[o]ccasions inevitably\nwill occur where a conscientious judge, after reflection or upon\nreceipt of new probation reports or other information, will feel\nthat he [or she] has been too harsh or has failed to give due\nweight to mitigating factors which properly he should have taken\ninto account.\" Commonwealth v. Rodriguez, 461 Mass. 256, 260\n(2012), quoting Commonwealth v. McCulloch, 450 Mass. 483, 487\n(2008). \"In such cases, a judge under rule 29 may 'reconsider\nthe sentence he [or she] has imposed and determine, in light of\nthe facts as they existed at the time of sentencing, whether the\nsentence was just.\" Rodriguez, supra, quoting McCulloch, supra.\n\"A judge, therefore, is not barred from reducing a sentence the\njudge has imposed until the time limits established in rule 29\nto revise or revoke a sentence have expired.\" Rodriguez, supra.\nAbsent an assertion of an illegal sentence, such review is time-\nlimited both as to the filing of a motion for review and the\nissuance of a judge's decision within a \"reasonable\" time. See\nCommonwealth v. Layne, 386 Mass. 291, 295-296 (1982), and cases\ncited.\nThe petitioners do not address the requirement of Rule 29\nthat the reduction be based on a sentencing judge's later\n\n36\ndetermination (with or without a hearing) that \"justice may not\nhave been done\" due to some factor present at the time of\nsentencing, or the reasons for that requirement. See Layne, 386\nMass. at 295-296, and cases cited. They apparently discount the\nrequirement that review under Rule 29 (a) is to \"permit a judge\nto reconsider the sentence he [or she] has imposed and\ndetermine, in light of the facts as they existed at the time of\nsentencing, whether the sentence was just [emphasis in\noriginal].22 Commonwealth v. Amirault, 415 Mass. 112, 117\n(1993), quoting Commonwealth v. Sitko, 372 Mass. 305, 313–314\n(1977).\n\"The granting of parole, [on the other hand,] is a\ndiscretionary act of the parole board.\" Amirault, 415 Mass. at\n116-117, citing Lanier v. Massachusetts Parole Bd., 396 Mass.\n1018, 1018 (1986). \"It is a function of the executive branch of\ngovernment.\" Amirault, supra, citing Stewart v. Commonwealth,\n22 In support of their argument that this court modify\nRule 29 to remove any period of limitation on a judge's\nauthority to revise and revoke a valid sentence, the petitioners\npoint to Commonwealth v. Tejeda, 481 Mass. 794, 797 (2019).\nThat case, however, does not advance their position. In Tejeda,\nwe reiterated that \"we have repeatedly and unequivocally held\nthat a judge may not take into account conduct of the defendant\nthat occurs subsequent to the original sentence\" (citations\nomitted). Id. Although we indicated that the judge in that\ncase could consider, post sentencing, that a more culpable\ncoventurer received a lesser sentence than had the defendant, we\nemphasized that \"the grounds for each sentence were known\" at\nthe time of defendant's trial. Id.\n\n37\n413 Mass. 664, 669 (1992), and Baxter v. Commonwealth, 359 Mass.\n175, 179 (1971). \"By allowing a motion to revise or revoke\nsentences when the parole board does not act in accordance with\na judge's expectations, the judge is interfering with the\nexecutive function. The judge cannot nullify the discretionary\nactions of the parole board.\" Amirault, supra, and cases cited.\nRule 29 is designed to protect the separation of powers as\nset forth in art. 30. See Clark, petitioner, 34 Mass. App. Ct.\n191, 195 (1993). \"The execution of sentences according to\nstanding laws is an attribute of the executive department of\ngovernment.\" Sheehan, petitioner, 254 Mass. 342, 345 (1926).\nTo attempt to \"revise,\" i.e., cut short, sentences in the\ncurrent situation would be to perform the function of the parole\nboard, thereby \"effectively usurp[ing] the decision-making\nauthority constitutionally allocated to the executive branch.\"\nSee Stewart, 413 Mass. at 669, quoting Commonwealth v. Gordon,\n410 Mass. 498, 501 (1991); Amirault, 415 Mass. at 117 (\"[T]he\njudge imposed sentences that he noted were within the\nguidelines. In considering requests for revision of those\nsentences under rule 29 the judge may not consider the denial of\nparole\").\nWhile we cannot order that relief be granted to sentenced\ninmates who have been serving a legal sentence, and who have not\ntimely moved to revise or revoke that sentence, mechanisms to\n\n38\nallow various forms of relief for sentenced inmates exist within\nthe executive branch. The parole board, for example, has\nauthority to release individuals who have become eligible for\nparole because they have reached their \"minimum term of\nsentence.\" See G. L. c. 127, § 133. An inmate in a house of\ncorrection can receive early parole consideration and be\nreleased up to sixty days prior to the minimum term based on\n\"any . . . reason that the Parole Board determines is\nsufficiently compelling.\" 120 Code Mass. Regs. § 200.10 (2017).\nOnce an inmate reaches eligibility, the parole board must hold a\nhearing to decide whether to grant the inmate a parole permit.\nSee G. L. c. 127, § 133A; 120 Code Mass. Regs. § 301.01 (2017).\nSee also G. L. c. 127, § 134 (allowing employees other than\nparole board members to conduct hearings for inmates at houses\nof correction).23 The parole board \"shall only grant a parole\npermit if they are of the opinion that there is a reasonable\nprobability that . . . the offender will live and remain at\nliberty without violating the law and that release is not\nincompatible with the welfare of society.\" 120 Code Mass. Regs.\n§ 300.04 (2017). See G. L. c. 127, § 130. If denied parole,\ninmates generally are entitled to a rehearing after either one\n23 The parole board reported at oral argument before us that\nit has made arrangements to hold hearings via video\nconferencing, and indeed was conducting two such hearings on the\nday of argument.\n\n39\nor five years, but the board may hold an earlier rehearing at\nits discretion. See G. L. c. 127, § 133A; 120 Code Mass. Regs.\n§ 301.01.\nThe parole board nonetheless reported at oral argument that\nit has made no efforts to accelerate the scheduling of parole\nhearings. The board reports that currently approximately 300\nindividuals have been deemed appropriate for release and have\nbeen awarded parole through the ordinary process, but have yet\nto be granted parole permits that would result in their actual\nrelease from custody because the board has not reduced what the\nboard says is a standard delay in preparing for release.24\nDuring normal times, the two-week delay the board states is\nstandard might be reasonable. But these are not normal times.\nWe urge the board to expedite release of these previously-\napproved individuals, as well as to expedite hearings on other\ninmates who are eligible for parole.\ne. Constitutional claims. As stated, while the\npetitioners argued in their initial brief that the failure to\n24 The parole board stated at oral argument that release\ngenerally is delayed for two weeks after a favorable decision\nwhile the board finalizes the inmate's housing plan and contacts\nany victims or law enforcement agencies as required by statute.\nSee G. L. c 258B, § 3; G. L. c. 127, § 133A; 120 Code Mass.\nRegs. § 301.06(3)(a) (2017). The parole board should use every\neffort to expedite the several stages of this process as far as\nreasonably possible so as to reduce the over-all number of\nincarcerated inmates as quickly as possible.\n\n40\nrelease incarcerated individuals violated the Eighth Amendment's\nprohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, and the failure to\nrelease pretrial detainees violated due process protections\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment and art. 26, in their reply brief\nand at oral argument they asserted that they are not pursuing\nsuch claims. Accordingly, we do not consider their\nconstitutional claims. See Commonwealth v. AdonSoto, 475 Mass.\n497, 506 (2016), quoting Commonwealth v. Raposo, 453 Mass. 739,\n743 (2009) (\"We do not decide constitutional questions unless\nthey must necessarily be reached\").\n4. Conclusion. Due to the crisis engendered by the COVID-\n19 pandemic, pretrial detainees who have not been charged with\nan excluded offense as set forth in Appendix A are entitled to a\nrebuttable presumption of release on personal recognizance, and\na hearing within two business days of filing a motion for\nreconsideration of bail and release, in accordance with the\nprocedures set forth in this opinion.\nThe special master shall report weekly to this court, as\nset forth in this opinion, in order to facilitate any further\nresponse necessary as a result of this rapidly-evolving\nsituation.\nSo ordered.\n\n41\nAppendix A.\nEXCLUDED OFFENSES\n1.

SJC-12926 \n \nCOMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC COUNSEL SERVICES & \nMASSACHUSETTS ASSOCIATION OF CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYERS, \nPetitioners \n \nv. \n \nCHIEF JUSTICE OF THE TRIAL COURT,  \nRespondent \n______________________________________________________ \n \nRESPONSE OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS FOR THE BRISTOL, CAPE & \nISLANDS, ESSEX, HAMPDEN, MIDDLE, NORFOLK, & PLYMOUTH DISTRICTS TO \nTHE PETITIONERS' MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION  \n______________________________________________________ \n \nBy their April 17, 2020 “Motion For Reconsideration Or Modification Of Decision” \nunder  Mass.  R.  App.  P.  27,  the  Petitioners  seek  to  “correct”  what  they  deem  are \n“misapprehensions of law and fact” in this Court’s decision in Committee for Public Counsel \nServices & another v. Chief Justice of the Trial Court & others, 484 Mass. 431 (2020) (“CPCS”).  \nThe petitioners decry the remedial measures ordered as “not nearly enough” and seek various \nnew and additional relief particularly as to sentenced defendants.  The District Attorneys for the \nBristol, Cape and Islands, Essex, Hampden, Middle, Norfolk, and Plymouth Districts [“seven \ndistrict attorneys”] respond to specifically address the petitioners’ requests: 1) to vacate the \nCourt’s opinion, and settled law, concerning stays of sentences; and 2) that confirmedly infected \ninmates be considered for release.1  In short, the Court did not “bury[] its head in the sand,” \nMotion at 6, but instituted robust measures to reduce, where consistent with public health and \nsafety, the incarcerated population, while respecting limits on its superintendence powers under \nG.L.  c.  211,  §  3  and  avoiding  unconstitutional  encroachment  on  legislative  and  executive \nfunctions per Article 30.  In two weeks, these measures have resulted in hundreds of releases; \n                     \n1  Other claims and requests are more properly answered, if necessary, by the parole board, the \ncarceral authorities, or the trial court.   \n1 \n \n\nhearings,  and  implementation  of  other  measures  the  Court  has  ordered,  continue.    The \npetitioners’ motion -- which does not allege, much less establish, any constitutional violation -- \nshould be DENIED.   \nThe CPCS and Christie decisions \nAs to pre-trial detainees, among other measures, the Court in CPCS: 1) established \ncategories entitled to presumptive release and articulated the burden the Commonwealth must \novercome in such cases, id. at 447;2 2) ordered the defense bar and custodial authorities to work \ntogether to facilitate prompt attorney-client video or teleconferences, id. at 448; 3) ordered \nhearings within 48 hours on motions for reconsideration of bail and release, id.; 4) urged district \nattorneys  to  make  “every  effort”  to  inform  victims,  as  required  by  G.L.  c.  258B,  on  this \ncompressed timeframe, id. at 449;3 5) enumerated factors for judges to consider at such hearings, \nid.  at  448;  6)  created  designated  sessions  to  hear  such  motions,  id.  at  449;  7)  mandated \n“prompt[]” decisions, id. at 449; 8) provided for review by a single justice of the county court, \nid. at 449; and 9) mandated daily and weekly census reporting, id. at 435, 456, Appendix B.  \nWhere release is ordered, the Court provided that conditions of release may be imposed while \nacknowledging  “current  limitations  on  probation  supervision  and  [GPS]  monitoring \nrestrictions.”4  Id. at 435 & n.6.  Further, to “reduce as far as possible” the influx of new \narrestees, the Court mandated consideration, in setting bail, of the arrestees’ age and health, and \nthe risk of infection that they may face while incarcerated or pose to other detainees.  Id. at 449.  \nIt also mandated consideration of these factors when determining whether to hold a defendant \npending a probation revocation hearing.  Id.   \n                     \n2  At the same time, it did not preclude others not in a presumptive category (e.g., those held on \nserious excluded offenses) from also moving for release.  Id. at 447 & n.18. \n3   It ordered that the “inability” to provide such notice “shall not be grounds” for the continued \ndetention of those otherwise entitled to release under its decision.  Id. at 449.   \n4   New orders requiring modification of probation conditions and supervision to be consistent \nwith social distancing eliminate or severely limit conditions such as GPS monitoring and home \nvisits.  See Mass. Probation Service Supervision Practices in Response to COVID-19 (March 18, \n2020) and Supreme Judicial Court Order concerning the imposition of global positioning system \n(GPS) monitoring as condition of release or of probation (March 24, 2020).   \n2 \n \n\nAs to sentenced individuals, the Court recognized that its power is “limited.”  CPCS at \n435-436, citing inter alia, Sheehan, petitioner, 254 Mass. 342, 345 (1926)(“The execution of \nsentences  according  to  standing  laws  is  an  attribute  of  the  executive  department  of \ngovernment.”). It re-affirmed that “[t]hose who have been serving sentences for less than sixty \ndays may move to have their sentences revised or revoked under Mass. R. Crim. P. 29 . . . [and] \n[t]hose who are pursuing appellate proceedings or a motion for a new trial may seek a stay of \nexecution of sentence pursuant to [Mass. R.  Crim. P. 31 and] Mass. R. A. P. 6[].”  Id., citing \nCommonwealth v. Charles, 466 Mass. 63, 83 (2013).  It declined the petitioners’ request to \nremove time limits on Rule 29 motions, as this would “usurp” the parole function entrusted to \nthe executive branch in violation of Art. 30.  Id. at 452.  The unanimous Court held:  \nOur broad power of superintendence over the  courts does not grant  us the \nauthority to authorize courts to revise or revoke defendants' custodial sentences, \nto stay the execution of sentence, or to order their temporary release unless a \ndefendant (1) has moved under Mass. R. Crim. P. 29, within sixty days after \nimposition of sentence or the issuance of a decision on all pending appeals, to \nrevise or revoke his or her sentence, (2) has appealed the conviction or sentence \nand the appeal remains pending, or (3) has moved for a new trial under \nMass. R. Crim. P. 30. \n \nId. at 450 (emphasis added).  \nAt the same time, the Court highlighted numerous “mechanisms to allow various forms \nof relief . . . within the executive branch,” id. at 452, and “urge[d]” the parole board to expedite \nrelease of those previously-approved, and to expedite use of other identified mechanisms to \nspeed  release  of  eligible  inmates.    Id.  at  452;  see  id.  at  436.5    “Absent  a  violation  of \nconstitutional rights, which the petitioners agree has not been established on this record, we \n                     \n5  Id. at 452, citing, e.g., G. L. c. 127, § 133 (parole board authority to release those eligible for \nparole because they have reached their “minimum term of sentence.”); 120 Code Mass. Regs. § \n200.10 (house of correction inmates may receive early parole consideration and be released up to \nsixty days prior to the minimum term based on “any … reason that the Parole Board determines \nis sufficiently compelling.”); G.L. c. 127, § 133A; 120 Code Mass. Regs. § 301.01 (2017) \n(requiring  parole  hearing  when  inmate  reaches  eligibility);  G.L.  c.  127,  §  134  (allowing \nemployees other than parole board members to conduct hearings at houses of correction); G.L. c. \n127, § 133A; 120 Code Mass. Regs. § 301.01 (if denied parole, board may at its discretion hold \nan earlier rehearing that the usual 1 to 5 year set back).   \n3 \n \n\nalso do not have authority under G.L. c. 211, § 3, to exercise supervision over parole, furlough, \nor clemency decisions by the DOC, the parole board, the sheriffs, and other members of the \nexecutive branch.”  Id. at 446 (emphasis added).    \nThree days before CPCS, the court issued Christie v. Commonwealth, No. SJC-12927, \n2020 WL 1545877 at *2–3 (Slip Op. Apr. 1, 2020), making  clear that judges considering \notherwise valid stay motions must consider the health risk to the defendant from incarceration, \nincluding  both  “the  general  risk  associated  with  preventing  COVID-19  transmission  and \nminimizing its spread in correctional institutions to inmates and prison staff and the specific risk \nto the defendant, in view of his or her age and existing medical conditions, that would heighten \nthe chance of death or serious illness if the defendant were to contract the virus.”  Id. at *2–3 \n(emphasis omitted).  The Court also mandated consideration of “the circumstances under which \nthe defendant would quarantine if he were to be released” and “the actual availability of such a \nresidence where he might be safely quarantined and the suitability of such a residence if it were \navailable.”  Id. at *3.  It added that “because of the pandemic, and because time is of the essence, \nit may not be realistic to conduct the usual due diligence to provide assurances of availability and \nsuitability, but that should not prevent the judge from relying on the information that reasonably \ncan be provided under the circumstances.” Id. at *3.   \nThe Court should reject the proposed substantial \nrevision of the law concerning stays \nThe petitioners seek reconsideration of the Court’s “needless[]” “pronouncement[]” that \nstay motions require a predicate appeal or new trial motion.  Motion at 2.  They ask this Court to \nsuspend  this  requirement,6  Motion  at  7-9,  and  further  request  that  this  Court  “establish  a \n                     \n6  The petitioners seek this specific relief for the first time.  See EMERGENCY PETITION FOR \nRELIEF PURSUANT TO G. L. c. 211, § 3 filed March 24, 2020 at pp. 16-17, 30 (seeking \nrelease of “Any other individuals for whom a release or stay is appropriate. See Commonwealth \nv.  Charles,  466  Mass.  63  (2013).”)  and  REPLY  BRIEF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS  ON \nRESERVATION AND REPORT FROM THE SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT FOR SUFFOLK \nCOUNTY filed March 30, 2020 at pp. 21-22 (same).    \n4 \n \n\nrebuttable presumption of a stay for certain individuals.”7 Motion at 10.  This Court correctly \nfound that motions for stays of execution of sentence were limited to cases where, through \nappeal or motion for new trial, a defendant was challenging his conviction.  Neither Mass. R. \nCrim. P. 31, nor this Court’s inherent authority, allows for an expansion into motions based on \nindependent grounds not affecting the legality or propriety of the conviction. Stays of execution \nof sentence under Mass. R. Crim. P. 31 are grounded on the raising of a meritorious legal issue. \nSee Commonwealth v. Hodge (No. 1), 378 Mass. 851, 855 (1980) (consideration given of \nrequest for stay to potential danger to any person or the community and the possibility of further \ncriminal acts during the pendency of the appeal, as well as the likelihood of success on appeal). \nRule 31 does not authorize a judge to stay an execution of sentence when an appeal is not \npending.  Commonwealth  v.  McLaughlin,  431  Mass.  506,  517  (2000).  In  McLaughlin,  in \nreviewing the history of Rule 31 and prior statutes concerning stays of sentences, this Court \nfound the authority of judges to grant stays was largely unchanged; “[t]hat is a strong indication \nthat  trial  judges  lack  authority  to  stay  execution  of  sentence  ‘on  independent  grounds  not \naffecting the legality or propriety of the conviction.’” Id. at 517-518, quoting Commonwealth v. \nO’Brien, 175 Mass. 37, 39 (1899). 8 Medical condition, an independent ground from the validity \nof the inmate’s conviction and sentence, is not a basis for a stay of execution of sentence. See \nMcLaughlin, 431 Mass. at 516 (noting in Commonwealth v. Hayes, 170 Mass. 16 (1897), the \n                     \n7 They also request that the carceral authorities issue further reports concerning those who meet \nthese categories, provide access to medical records within 24 hours, and seek hearings with 48 \nhours.  Motion 7-11.   \n8 Nor is the practice of allowing a defendant to arrange his affairs prior to the imposition of the \nsentence (Mot. Recon. 8-9) relevant to the determination of the ability of a judge to pause a \nsentence  during  its  execution  for  reasons  unrelated  to  the  legality  of  the  conviction.  See \nMcLaughlin, 431 Mass. at 518-519, quoting Commonwealth v. Gilnes, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 95, 97 \nn.2 (1996) (“Ordinarily, a judge would employ a stay only to allow a convicted person to arrange \nhis or her affairs, or . . . pending determination of an appeal”). \n \n \n5 \n \n\nCourt, under early version of G.L. c. 279, § 4, found trial judge lacked authority to grant stay of \nexecution of sentence on grounds of defendant’s poor health). 9 \nThe language in Commonwealth v. Charles, 466 Mass. 63, 72 (2013), that a judge has the \ninherent power to stay sentences for “exceptional reasons permitted by law”, id. at 72, quoting \nMcLaughlin, 431 Mass. at 520, quoting Mariano v. Judge of Dist. Court of Cent. Berkshire, 243 \nMass. 90, 92 (1922), does not assist the petitioners’ argument. In Charles, the defendants’ \nchallenge to the validity of their convictions was based on the misconduct of the analyst who \ntested the drugs that formed the basis for their conviction. A successful claim was based on the \nvalidity of the conviction and if successful would have permitted the reprieve of the sentence \nbased  on  the  conviction.  Cf.  Stewart  v.  Commonwealth,  413  Mass.  664,  667-668  (1992) \n(inappropriate to release defendant on bail under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30(c)(8) where success \nwould only increase parole eligibility; judge’s decision “effectively usurped the decision-making \nauthority  constitutionally  allocated  to  the  executive  branch”),  quoting  Commonwealth  v. \nGordon, 410 Mass. 498, 501 (1991)). This Court in Stewart distinguished stays of execution of \nsentence as in Commonwealth v. Levin, 7 Mass. App. Ct. 501 (1979), finding Levin “focused on \nthe importance of persons’ not being forced to spend time in prison on a conviction that may be \nreversed. Levin did not address the issue of bail for a defendant who would not be released if \nsuccessful on appeal.” Id.at 667 n.7. \nThe motion to intervene by Prisoner Legal Services, or, as represented by petitioners, \nPrisoner Legal Services’ lawsuit under G.L. c. 214, §1 filed with the single justice on April 17, \n2020, does not change the analysis. The motion to intervene concerns this case, in which this \nCourt  has  already  rendered  a  decision,  and  does  not  challenge  the  validity  of  individual \ndefendants’ convictions, such that success on the merits that would potentially lead to a reprieve \nof the sentence. To the extent there is a civil lawsuit, not part of this record, which seeks civil \n                     \n9 Christie, where this Court found that COVID-19 was an appropriate factor to consider on a \nmotion to reconsider the denial of a motion to stay, is not to the contrary. Christie, 484 Mass. at \n*3. In Christie, the defendant had appealed the order revoking his probation; accordingly, his \nmotion to stay execution of his sentence was valid under Rule 31.  \n6 \n \n\nrelief for alleged violations of rights, such relief would not affect the validity of the inmates’ \nconvictions. Additionally, as stated in the Seven District Attorneys’ response to the petition \nunder G.L. c. 211, § 3, remedies of claims of violations of rights related to the conditions of \nconfinement would generally be the injunction of the conduct causing the harm, a claim not \nentitling any specific individual incarcerated due to a criminal conviction to release.  See Seven \nDistrict Attorneys' Response at 20; see, e.g., Glaus v. Anderson, 408 F.3d 382 (7th Cir. 2005) \n(“If an inmate established that his medical treatment amounts to cruel and unusual punishment, \nthe appropriate remedy would be to call for proper treatment, or to award him damages; release \nfrom custody is not an option”). \n  Nor does this Court’s inherent power extend to pausing a properly executed sentence for \nreasons independent of the validity of the conviction. “The ability to defer the imposition of \nsentence, although a valuable feature in our legal system, is not necessary to the very existence \nof a court, and, as such, is not an inherent power beyond statutory limitation.” Commonwealth v. \nJackson, 369 Mass. 904, 922 (1976) (discussing validity of mandatory minimum sentences). \n“Although it is the court’s function to impose sentences upon conviction, it is for the Legislature \nto establish criminal sanctions. . . . If we were to conclude that the judiciary could exercise its \ndiscretion to suspend imposition or execution of sentence despite statutory proscription, a serious \nquestion concerning the separation of powers would arise, for, taking this proposition to its \nlogical extreme, it would mean that the judiciary impliedly possesses the power to nullify the \nLegislature’s authority.” Id. at 922-923.  \nThe petitioners’ recommendation that categories of inmates be presumptively entitled to \nstays (Mot. Recon. 10-11) reinforces that the requested relief would encroach on executive \nfunctions.    The  first  four  proposed  categories  concern:  individuals  eligible  for  parole  and \nincarcerated for an offense not listed in Appendix A, CPCS, 484 Mass. 454-455; individuals \nserving time in a house of correction for a non-excluded offense; individuals completing their \nsentences within six months; and individuals incarcerated for a parole or probation violation \nwhere the violation is not a new criminal offense. All four categories involve the conditions and \n7 \n \n\nlength of time an inmate is serving, a function, as noted by this Court in its decision, squarely \nwithin the power of the Executive Branch and Parole Board.  CPCS, 484 Mass. at 446-452. 10 \nThe proposal for a rebuttable presumption and expedited release also effectively abrogates the \nstatutory notice and response period concerning petitions for commitment as sexually dangerous \npersons. See, e.g., G.L. c. 123A, § 12. The fifth and sixth categories concern those who are \nvulnerable to COVID-19 due to age or medical condition, or medically qualified for parole, but \nmedical condition would be an independent ground from the validity of the inmate’s conviction \nand sentence, and not a ground for a stay of execution of sentence. See McLaughlin, 431 Mass. \nat 516, citing Commonwealth v. Hayes, 170 Mass. 16 (1897). Additionally, if the petitioners’ \ncategory of those who are “medically qualified” for medical parole excludes any consideration of \nwhether the individual presents a public safety risk, they are creating a category the Legislature \ndid not include in setting out who was eligible for medical parole. See G.L. c. 127, § 119A \n(definitions of permanent incapacitation and terminal illness both include that the condition, “is \nso debilitating that the prisoner does not pose a public safety risk”). This request for a rebuttable \npresumption also infringes upon the careful balancing set out by the Legislature as to the grant of \nmedical parole.  See, e.g., Buckman v. Commissioner of Correction, 484 Mass. 14, 19 (2020) \n(medical  parole  available  where  determined  that  inmate  is  terminally  ill  or  permanently \nincapacitated, would live and remain in society without violating the law, and whose release is \nnot incompatible with the welfare of society).   \nFinally, the petitioners do not address the clear legislative grant of broad power to the \ngovernor to act to protect the health and safety of inmates from the pandemic.  By his March 10, \n2020 declaration of a State of Emergency to respond to COVID-19, Executive Order No. 591, \nthe governor invoked powers granted under the Civil Defense Act. See Acts of 1950 c. 639 and \nG.L. c. 17, § 2A; Executive Order No. 591, paragraph 13.  The Act explicitly grants plenary \n                     \n10 Defendants have a due process right to serve sentences promptly and continuously.  See \nCommonwealth v. Ly, 450 Mass. 16, 22 (2007). Absent waiver by the defendant, pausing a \nsentence raises due process concerns.  \n8 \n \n\npowers to the governor regarding the health or safety of inmates.  Acts of 1950, c. 639, § 7 \n(providing  the  governor  “any  and  all  authority  over  persons  and  property  necessary  or \nexpedient for meeting said state of emergency,” and providing that he “shall have and may \nexercise such authority relative to any or all of the following: - - -  a.  Health or Safety of \ninmates of all institutions.”) (emphasis added). In his emergency declaration the Governor \ninvoked  the  powers  of  Section  7  and  declared  that  he  would  “from  time  to  time  issue \nrecommendations, directives, and orders as circumstances may require.”  Executive Order No. \n591,  paragraph  13.11    These  powers  are  in  addition  to  others  granted  to  the  executive, \nindependent of a state of emergency, to provide for the health and safety of inmates relative to \ndisease outbreaks.  See, e.g., G.L. c. 111, § 108 (removal of sick prisoners).12   \nThe Court should not authorize release of infected or quarantined inmates \n  In CPCS, this Court held that “[o]f course, those individuals who have tested positive or \nare symptomatic for COVID-19, or who are in quarantine due to having been in close contact \nwith someone else who has tested positive, must remain in isolation or quarantine and would not \nbe eligible for release during those periods.” 484 Mass. at 448 & n.19.  The petitioners argue this \nrests on the “incorrect” view “that keeping those individuals incarcerated will protect public \nhealth”  and  seek  “individualized  release  decisions,”  i.e.,  potential  release,  of  confirmedly \ninfected and contagious inmates who “have a place to self-quarantine in a private setting.” \nMotion at 13-14.  The proposal evinces a striking disregard for the realities of the pandemic and \n                     \n11 Pursuant to G.L. c. 17, § 2A, the governor’s emergency order also thereby invoked the powers \nprovided by the legislature to the Commissioner of the Department of Public Health.  Executive \nOrder No. 591, paragraph 13.  G.L. c. 17, § 2A (“Upon declaration by the governor that an \nemergency exists which is detrimental to the public health, the commissioner may, with the \napproval of the governor and the public health council, during such period of emergency, take \nsuch action and incur such liabilities as he may deem necessary to assure the maintenance of \npublic health and the prevention of disease . . . .”). \n12 The clear legislative grant of authority to the governor would of course not preclude further \nremedial action by the legislature itself.  See e.g., Commonwealth v. Galvin, 466 Mass. 286, \n290–291 (2013) (giving effect to legislative intent to provide retroactive relief to those convicted \nof certain crimes carrying mandatory minimum sentences). \n  \n \n9 \n \n\nthe risk to vulnerable communities on the outside.  It ignores the current uncertainty about how \nlong infected persons, even if deemed “recovered,” nonetheless remain contagious.13  It also \nignores  that,  owing  to  the  pandemic,  authorities  will  be  unable  to  meaningfully  verify  a \ndefendant’s representations about the availability of “a place to self-quarantine in a private \nsetting” or to monitor and enforce compliance with quarantine.  This Court has acknowledged as \nmuch.  CPCS, 484 Mass. at 435 & n 6; Christie, 2020 WL 1545877 at *3.  If such defendants are \nreleased to, or later move to, congregate residential settings full of vulnerable individuals -- \nelderly housing, rooming houses, trailer parks, homeless shelters -- this could have dire public \nhealth consequences.14  The Court should leave in place its sensible approach.  \nConclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, the motion should be DENIED. \n         \nTHOMAS M.

We  had  to  make  temporary  changes  to  the  process \nlast  week,  as  Lisa  Deliz  was  out.  Going  forward  please  direct  all  requests  to \narrange  to  speak  with  your  clients  at  Ludlow  or  Chicopee  facilities  to: \nAttorneyContact(@sdh.state.ma.us \nPlease  provide  them  with  your  client’s  name,  D.O.B  and  person \nnumber  if you  have  it.  They  will  get  back  to  you  by  email  with \ntimes  that  you  can  expect  a  call  from  your  clients.  We  have  limited \nstaff  right  now  due  to_the  Governor’s  order  regarding  non- \nessential  employees.  Please  be patient.  Our  staff will  do  the  best \nthat  they  can  in  getting  back  to  you  in  a  timely  manner. \nA  few  important  things  to  know  to  ensure  the  smooth  operation  of this \nprocess  and  that  you  will  be  able  to  maintain  confidentiality  with  your \nclients: \n1.  If you  need  your  client  to  call  you  at  a  number  that  is  not  already  in \nour  system  you  should  send  an  email  with  your  phone  number  and \nBBO  number  to  ICS@sdh.state.ma.us  .  Please  do  not  email  this  link \nunless  you  are  fairly  certain  your  phone  number  Is  not  already \nregistered. \n2.  It1is  best  to  have  your  clients  contact  you  from  the  blue  phones  on  the \nhousing  units  as  opposed  to  using  a  counselor’s  phone.  Neither  would \nbe  recorded,  but  more  privacy  and  time  for  the  phone  call  will  be \nafforded  to  your  clients  if they  use  the  housing  unit  phones.  If they \nneed  to  use  a  counselor’s  phone,  time  1s  limited  as  they  cannot  have \ntheir  phones  tied  up  for  large  periods  of time.  Additionally,  those \ncalls  have  to  occur  with  the  staff  member  either  in  the  office  or  in  the \ndoorway  for  security  reasons. \n3.  Please  make  every  effort  to  send  your  emails  prior  to  3  p.m.  so  that \nthe  call  times  can  be  set  up  for  you  on  the  day  requested. \nThank  you  for  your  patience  as  we  all  navigate  these  highly  unusual  and \ndifficult  times.\nNorfolk  County  Sheriff's  Department \nAttorney  /  Client  Teleconference  Procedures \nSJC  Order  12926 \nAttorneys  wishing  to  schedule  a  teleconference  with  their  clients  should  send  their  request  by  email  to: \nFOR  CLIENTS  RESIDING  AT  THE  NORFOLK  COUNTY  HOUSE  OF  CORRECTION \ndboomhower/@norfolksheriffma.org \ne  Requests  received  prior  to  2:00PM,  will  be  answered  in  a  same  day \nresponse,  with  teleconferences  scheduled  for  the  following  day, \n(Monday  —  Friday),  between  the  hours  of 9:00AM  —  3:00PM. \ne  Email  requests  should  originate  from  a  law  office  email  address. \ne  Attorneys  wishing  to  add  their  cellphone  numbers  to  the  attorney  /  client \nprivileged  call  list  should  forward  such  requests  to  the  appropriate  email \naddress  listed  above.

To \nmitigate the mortal harm that the COVID-19 pandemic will inflict upon incarcerated \npeople, on corrections staff, and on all of our communities, this petition asks the \nCourt to exercise its superintendence powers under G. L. c. 211, § 3, to reduce the \nnumbers of people who are now in or who will enter Massachusetts jails, prisons, \nand houses of correction. \nThe novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is spreading exponentially \nacross the country and across this Commonwealth. There is no vaccine, and no \nuninfected person is immune. This Court and the Trial Court have already \nrecognized that this pandemic poses dire threats not only to everyone in the \nCommonwealth, but also to its legal system. The courts have issued a flurry of orders \ndesigned to slow the spread of COVID-19 by limiting the numbers of people who \ncome to court.1 And Chief Justice Gants has observed that this crisis will require us \nto “find new ways to protect the most vulnerable, preserve individual rights, resolve \ndisputes, and somehow keep the wheels of justice turning in the midst of this \nfrightening pandemic.”2 \n                                                           \n1 See generally Court System Response to COVID-19, https://www.mass.gov/guides/\ncourt-system-response-to-covid-19. \n2 Letter to the Bar from Chief Justice Ralph D. Gants (Mar. 20, 2020). \n2 \n \n\nProtection is now needed for the roughly 16,500 vulnerable people \nincarcerated in Massachusetts. Over the weekend, the first confirmed COVID-19 \ncases—three prisoners and one officer—were reportedly diagnosed inside the \nMassachusetts prison system.3 This does not bode well. Correctional facilities, where \nphysical distancing and vigilant hygiene are impossible, can be petri dishes for the \nrapid spread of infectious disease. Outbreaks in our prisons will, of course, imperil \nthe lives of incarcerated people, but they will also endanger correctional officers and \nmedical staff, their families, and their communities as staff cycle through the \nfacilities. The more people who contract the virus, the more treatment they will \nneed, and the more precious resources their treatment will require. Prison outbreaks \nimperil us all.4  \nConfronted with this reality, at least eight state and local court systems—in \nAlabama, Maine, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas and \nWashington—as well as the District of Columbia, have already taken steps to limit \nincarceration during this crisis. See infra at nn. 27-30. As explained by Montana \nChief Justice Mike McGrath, releasing prisoners is warranted for a simple and \n                                                           \n3 See John Hilliard, Mass.

A, Affidavit of Danielle C. Ompad, PhD, regarding SARS-CoV-2 \ninfection (otherwise known as COVID-19) in correctional settings [hereinafter \nOmpad Affidavit] at ¶ 6(e). \n3 \n \n\nterrifying reason: “Due to the confines of [correctional] facilities, it will be virtually \nimpossible to contain the spread of the virus.” See infra at n.28.  \nFor the reasons explained below, petitioners the Committee for Public \nCounsel Services (CPCS) and the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense \nLawyers (MACDL) respectfully ask this Court to join these other courts and take \nimmediate steps to reduce the number of incarcerated people in Massachusetts in a \nmanner that is consonant with both public safety and public health. Specifically, the \npetition asks this Court to:  \n1)  reduce the volume of those entering Massachusetts jails and prisons by, \namong other steps, requiring trial courts to account for the threat of \nCOVID-19 in jails and prisons when they analyze the need for pretrial \ndetention;  \n \n2)  order the release of those held prior to the disposition of their case who \nare not detained because they pose a danger to public safety; and \n  \n3)  deem served the sentences of incarcerated individuals who are vulnerable \nto COVID-19, near the end of their sentence, or who do not pose a threat \nto the public, and release on parole those eligible for parole (including \nmedical parole).  \n \nIf taken immediately, these emergency measures will mitigate the spread of \nCOVID-19 among and beyond the incarcerated population. They will keep the \nwheels of justice turning, and will save lives.5 \n                                                           \n5 See Siobhan Roberts, The Exponential Power of Now, N.Y.

As of March 23, 2020, Massachusetts has 777 confirmed diagnoses.7 Given \nthe limitation of testing capacity, there may be many times more people infected \nthan are presently diagnosed.8 \n  COVID-19 is a tragic combination of infectious and deadly. The disease \nspreads “easily and sustainably” from person-to-person.9 Both symptomatic and \nasymptomatic people can spread COVID-19,10 and scientists estimate that the \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \na single infection today averts “four times as many infections in the next month: \nroughly 2,400 averted infections, versus just 600 if you wait one week”). \n6 See Mass.

But this disease “can kill healthy adults in addition to \nelderly people with existing health problems.”17 Recent reports suggest that 40% of \nhospitalized COVID-19 cases were under the age of sixty.18 \n  Because there is no vaccine, there are only two ways to prevent the spread of \nCOVID-19: physical social distancing (i.e., remaining at least six feet away from \nother people) and hygiene (i.e., hand washing and regular cleaning of surfaces).19 \nThis makes jails and prisons especially ill-suited to the prevention of outbreaks. \n[B]ehind bars, some of the most basic disease prevention measures are against \nthe rules or simply impossible. Separating sick people from well people to \nprevent the disease from spreading can be nearly impossible in prison, since \nprisoners  are  already  grouped  according  to  security  and  other  logistical \nconsiderations. Even so-called social distancing can prove impossible. People \nin prisons and jails live every minute of the day in close proximity to each \nother.20 \n \n  Almost 8,000 people are incarcerated in Department of Correction (DOC) \nfacilities, and another 8,500 are in county jails and houses of correction.21 Physical \ndistancing is impossible in these facilities, and the problem is particularly dire in the \nnine DOC facilities and seven county facilities that, according to the most updated \n                                                           \n17 Bill Gates, Responding to Covid-19 – A Once-in-a-Century Pandemic?, New Eng.  \nJ. of Med.

According to client reports from nine Massachusetts \ncorrectional facilities, two facilities do not allow access to soap at all and only three \nallow access to free soap; in four facilities, there is no access to hand sanitizer.23  \n  It is therefore no surprise that several Massachusetts prisoners and corrections \nofficers have already been diagnosed with COVID-19.24 More cases are doubtless \nsoon to follow. The ripple effects of this outbreak endanger everyone in the \nCommonwealth; it could exceed the capacity of the DOC’s medical services and \nrequire the hospitalization of incarcerated people in already-strapped community \nhospitals.25 The outbreak will also spill over into community, as staff enter and exit \ncorrectional facilities on a daily basis.  \n                                                           \n22 See Mass.

Relief is sought in this Court because, \ngiven the exponential growth of an ongoing pandemic, there is no other timely and \neffective remedy. COVID-19 not only poses a deadly threat to every single \nincarcerated person’s life; any outbreak can cascade into the community. Under \nthese extraordinary circumstances, “G. L. c. 211, § 3, is the only . . . remedy \navailable” that has any conceivable hope of effectively avoiding or mitigating \noutbreaks of this deadly, infectious virus in Massachusetts correctional facilities. \nCommonwealth v. DeJesus, 440 Mass. 147, 150 (2003).  \nCONSTITUTIONAL BASES FOR RELIEF \nThe exercise of this Court’s supervisory powers here is “necessary to protect \nsubstantive rights.” Barber v. Commonwealth, 353 Mass. 236, 239 (1967). \nContinuing to detain individuals without any modification in the face of the current \ncrisis raises significant Eighth Amendment, article 26, and due process concerns. \nI.  Subjecting non-dangerous prisoners to a likely outbreak of COVID-19 \nraises significant Eighth Amendment and article 26 concerns. \n \nConditions that pose an unreasonable risk of future harm violate the \nconstitutional protections of the Eighth Amendment and article 26. See Helling v. \nMcKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993) (“That the Eighth Amendment protects against \nfuture harm to inmates is not a novel proposition”); Good v. Comm’r of Corr., 417 \nMass. 329, 336 (1994) (“An inmate need not wait until he suffers actual harm . . . a \n12 \n \n\nclaim is made out if there is a substantial risk that the inmate will suffer serious harm \nas a result of the conditions of his confinement”). The Eighth Amendment requires \nthat “inmates be furnished with . . . reasonable safety,” and the Supreme Court has \nexplicitly recognized that the risk of contracting “serious contagious diseases” may \nconstitute such an “unsafe, life-threatening condition” that it threatens “reasonable \nsafety.” McKinney, 509 U.S. at 33-34 (cleaned up);31 see also Hutto v. Finney, 437 \nU.S. 678, 682-685 (1978) (recognizing the need for a remedy where prisoners were \ncrowded into cells and some had infectious diseases).  \nIn the past, courts have found claims of future harms cognizable under the \nEighth Amendment that involved the risks posed by second-hand smoke,32 \ncontaminated water,33 use of chemical toilets,34 and paint toxins.35 A potential \nCOVID-19 outbreak poses at least such a substantial risk of serious harm to every \nincarcerated person in the Commonwealth. \nII.

See \nCommonwealth v. Knapp, 441 Mass. 157, 164 (2004). Due process demands a \nbalancing of the liberty interest at stake, the risk of erroneous deprivation, and the \ngovernment’s asserted interest. See Doe v. Att’y Gen., 426 Mass. 136, 140 (1997), \nciting Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334-335 (1976) (“[d]eprivation of greater \nindividual liberty interests requires greater procedures and stronger countervailing \nState interests”). \nIn light of the pandemic, detention now not only deprives individuals of their \nfreedom, but also subjects them to a serious risk of loss of life or permanent injury.  \nThese additional burdens, not accounted for in the traditional analysis, implicate \nsubstantive and procedural due process concerns that demand action. \nPETITIONERS \nCPCS was created by G. L. c. 211D, §§ 1 et. seq.,  “to plan, oversee, and \ncoordinate the delivery of criminal . . . legal services by salaried public counsel, bar \nadvocate and other assigned counsel programs and private attorneys serving on a per \ncase basis.” CPCS provides constitutionally required representation to over eighty \npercent of all pretrial and post-conviction defendants throughout the \nCommonwealth and, as such, “has a compelling interest in advocating for uniform \npractices and solutions that will ensure consistent treatment for all of those \n14 \n \n\ndefendants.” Bridgeman v. Dist. Atty. for the Suffolk Dist., 471 Mass. 465, 486 \n(2015). The issues raised in this petition are directly connected to CPCS’s ability to \nensure that all defendants across the Commonwealth are receiving the same \ntreatment and to provide representation for all defendants during a time of required \nphysical distancing. CPCS also has a strong interest in safeguarding the constitutional \nrights of its clients. \nMACDL is an incorporated association representing more than 1,000 \nexperienced trial and appellate lawyers who are members of the Massachusetts Bar \nand who devote a substantial part of their practices to criminal defense. MACDL \ndevotes much of its energy to identifying, and attempting to avoid or correct, \nproblems in the criminal justice system. \nREQUESTS FOR RELIEF \n \n  As described in more detail below, to mitigate the harm that the COVID-19 \npandemic will inflict upon incarcerated people, corrections staff, and Massachusetts \ncommunities, this petition asks this Court to order the Trial Court to: \n1)  consider the serious health risks posed by detention to the defendant, other \nincarcerated individuals, and the community in probation detention hearings, \nbail determination and reconsideration hearings, and dangerousness hearings; \n \n2)  vacate all bench warrants, and cease issuing new bench warrants, for failures to \nappear or failures to pay outstanding fees and fines; \n \n3)  vacate all provisions of probation orders, and cease issuing new provisions in \nprobation orders, that require the immediate instigation of probation violation \nproceedings upon an alleged probation violation; \n15 \n \n\n \n4)  suspend all probation or pretrial conditions—including drug testing, \nemployment requirements and education requirements—whose adherence \nwould require the individual to violate the World Health Organization’s \nphysical isolation instructions; \n \n5)  order the relevant custodians to immediately release, with or without \nconditions, the following categories of individuals currently held pretrial: \n \na.  individuals held on unaffordable bail under G. L. c. 276, § 58; \n \nb.  individuals held on a bail revocation for a technical violation of their \nconditions of release; \n \nc.  individuals over the age of 60 and thus at increased risk of severe \nCOVID-19 complications and death; and \n \nd.  individuals who have a condition or disease that puts them at increased \nrisk of severe COVID-19 complications and death, including \ncardiovascular and respiratory disease, diabetes, and liver disease. \n \n6)  order the relevant custodians to immediately release, with or without \nconditions, the following categories of individuals serving sentences of \nincarceration: \n \na.  individuals who are eligible for parole as a matter of law under G. L. \nc. 127, § 133, and who are incarcerated solely for an offense or offenses \nnot appearing in G. L. c. 265; \n \nb.  individuals who will complete their sentences and be entitled to release \nwithin six months;  \n \nc.  individuals who are incarcerated as a result of a finding of a violation of \nprobation or parole that does not include the allegation of a new \ncriminal offense; \n \nd.  individuals who are over the age of 60 and thus at increased risk of \nsevere COVID-19 complications and death, and are incarcerated solely \nfor an offense or offenses not appearing in G. L. c. 265 (crimes against \nthe person); \n16 \n \n\n \ne.  individuals who have been diagnosed with a condition or disease that \nputs them at increased risk of severe COVID-19 complications and \ndeath, including cardiovascular and respiratory disease, diabetes, and \nliver disease;  \n \nf.  individuals who qualify for medical parole under G. L. c. 127, § 119A; \n \ng.  individuals serving a sentence in a house of correction for an offense \nnot appearing in G.L. c. 265; and \n \nh.  any other individual for whom a release or stay is appropriate. See \nCommonwealth v. Charles, 466 Mass. 63 (2013).  \n \nThis petition also asks this Court to urge prosecutors to exercise their sound \ndiscretion to reduce substantially the number of defendants in the Commonwealth, \nand to encourage police departments to forgo custodial arrests when possible during \nthis state of emergency. \n \nI.   This Court should take immediate steps to limit the number of \nindividuals taken into custody.  \n \nThis Court should take immediate steps to limit the number of people who \nare taken into custody during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adding new incarcerated \nindividuals exacerbates the risks of transmission that already exist in jails, prisons, \nand lockups. This is because each new detained person crowds those facilities—and \nthus undermines physical distancing—and presents a risk of introducing COVID-19 \nto, or getting COVID-19 from, a facility, and then spreading it further. To mitigate \n17 \n \n\nthat risk, this Court should exercise its superintendence authority to implement three \ntypes of measures to limit the number of individuals entering state custody.  \nA.  Issue guidance for the trial courts’ detention analysis.  \nThis Court should instruct trial courts that, when making probation and \npretrial detention decisions, they should consider the dangers posed by incarceration \nduring this public health crisis.   \n(i)  Violations of probation \nTypically, a judge may choose between custodial or non-custodial responses \npending a probation violation hearing. See Rule 5, Dist. Ct. and Mun. Ct. R. Prob. \nViolation Hearings. The current rules instruct judges that “the decision whether to \norder such custody shall include, but not necessarily be limited to” several factors. \nId. Given the current state of emergency, this Court should instruct trial courts that \nthe risk that a probationer, if detained, may either contract COVID-19 or infect \nothers, constitutes an additional factor that weighs against detention. Under this \ninterpretation, technical violations of probation—i.e., violations other than an \nallegation of a new criminal offense—can never outweigh the public health risk of \nincarceration to justify detention. And any other probation violation could result in \nincarceration in only limited circumstances.36 \n                                                           \n36 The Trial Court Emergency Administrative Order 20-2 seems to suspend final \nrevocation hearings. See https://www.mass.gov/trial-court-rules/trial-court-emergency-\nadministrative-order-20-2-order-concerning-probation [hereinafter Trial Court Order \n18 \n \n\n(ii)  Pretrial detention \nThis Court should also make clear that the pandemic must impact the trial \ncourts’ analysis of pretrial detention.  \nUnder ordinary circumstances, this Court has authorized pretrial detention in \ntwo instances. The first is for failure to pay bail where “neither alternative \nnonfinancial conditions nor a bail amount the defendant can afford will adequately \nassure his appearance for trial.” Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 693 \n(2017); see also Querubin v. Commonwealth, 440 Mass. 108, 116 (2003). The  \nsecond is where the individual is charged with certain enumerated offenses and \npersonal recognizance “will not reasonably assure the presence of the arrested \nperson at trial or the safety of any other person.” Mendonza v. Commonwealth, 423 \nMass. 771, 774 (1996). In authorizing detention in those circumstances, this Court’s \nconsideration of the defendants’ countervailing interest was focused solely on their \nloss of freedom.  \nIn light of the current pandemic, however, substantive due process now \nmandates consideration of the serious risk of death or permanent injury that faces \nanyone taken into pretrial detention. To comport with substantive due process, the \ngovernmental interest in pretrial detention must outweigh its curtailment of an \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n20-2].To the extent such hearings are still occurring at the Superior Court or are \nresumed at the District Court during the pandemic, this Court should ensure that \njudges consider the health risks of incarceration as a “mitigating factor” in revocation \nanalyses. See Rule 8(D), C. Ct. and Mun. Ct. R. Probation Violation Hearings.  \n19 \n \n\nindividual’s fundamental rights. See United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 748, 750 \n(1987). Although this Court has said that the government’s interest in community \nsafety or assuring an individual’s presence at trial can, under certain circumstances, \noutweigh that individual’s liberty interest, the scale must move differently when \nweighted with the individual’s right to avoid the serious risk of death or substantial \npermanent injury. Quite simply, the government’s interest in assuring the \ndefendant’s presence in court can never overcome this recalibrated individual \ninterest. As a result, this Court should instruct the trial courts that individuals cannot \nbe incarcerated for inability to pay bail during this public health emergency.37 This \nCourt should also indicate that the government’s interest in ensuring community \nsafety can outweigh the defendant’s risk of death only when that individual presents \nthe most serious danger to the community. \nThe current public health crisis similarly implicates procedural due process \nconcerns. A constitutionally adequate process “must balance the interests of the \nindividual affected, the risk of erroneous deprivation of those interests and the \ngovernment’s interest in the efficient and economic administration of its affair.” \nQuerubin, 440 Mass. at 117 (quoting Commonwealth v. Barboza, 387 Mass. 105, \n112 (1982), cert denied, 459 U.S. 1020 (1982)). As noted above, the risk of potential \nexposure to COVID-19 has significantly altered the relevant interests. Procedural \n                                                           \n37 And, as noted infra, all people currently held on an unaffordable bail should be \nreleased immediately. \n20 \n \n\ndue process demands that any process for pretrial detention must account for this \nshift. Thus, this Court should instruct trial courts that their analysis during bail and \ndangerousness hearings must consider the serious health risks posed by detention to \nthe defendant, other incarcerated individuals, and the community.38 \nB.  Require Trial Courts to suspend practices that detain criminal \ndefendants for minor infractions. \n \nAs long as Massachusetts remains in a state of emergency due to the COVID-\n19 pandemic, this Court should also order the trial courts to halt or vacate several \npractices that require criminal defendants to be taken into custody for minor \ninfractions, or that require defendants to take actions that are incompatible with the \nphysical distancing necessary to safeguard public health. \nFirst, this Court should instruct trial courts to vacate all bench warrants, and to \ncease issuing new bench warrants, for failures to appear or failures to pay outstanding \nfees and fines. At least two court systems have already taken similar actions. Last \nweek, Maine trial courts vacated more than 12,000 warrants in these exact \n                                                           \n38 This Court should also order the Chief Justice of the District Court Department to \nvacate so much of Amended Standing Order 2-20  as permits a judge to indefinitely  \ncontinue a § 58A hearing where a “witness is unavailable or unable to participate by \nvideoconference or telephonic conference” and requires that the defendant remain \nin custody during that time. See attached, Ex. B, Memorandum from Paul C. \nDawley, Chief Justice of the District Court., to District Court Judges, Clerk-\nMagistrates, Assistant Clerk-Magistrates, and Chief Probation Officers, Re: \nAmendment and Guidance on District Court Standing Order 2-20 (Mar. 18, 2020). \nIndefinite pretrial detention is constitutionally impermissible in ordinary times. See \nMendonza, 423 Mass. at 783 (holding that § 58A is constitutional in part because it \nis not indefinite). It must not be permitted during this pandemic. \n21 \n \n\ncategories,39 and the Supreme Court of South Carolina directed that “bench warrants \nfor failure to appear shall not be issued at this time.”40 This Court can and should \nissue a similar order as an exercise of its superintendence authority under G. L. c. \n211, § 3. \nSecond, this Court should instruct trial courts to vacate all provisions in \nprobation orders, and to cease issuing new provisions in probation orders, requiring \nthe immediate instigation of probation violation proceedings upon an alleged \nprobation violation. Judges typically can choose whether to include in their \nprobation orders a condition that proceedings must occur for any allegation of \nprobation. Cf. Rule 4, D. Ct. and Mun. Ct. R. Prob. Violation Hearings. Eliminating \nautomatic hearings could decrease the number of individuals brought into court on \ntechnical probation violations, which during this pandemic exposes both the \nprobationer and court officers to serious, and needless, risk. \nThird, this Court should instruct trial courts to suspend all probation or \npretrial conditions, including drug testing, employment requirements, and education \n                                                           \n39 Judy Harrison, Maine Courts Vacate Warrants for Unpaid Fines and Fees, Bangor \nDaily News (Mar. 16, 2020), \nhttps://bangordailynews.com/2020/03/16/news/state/maine-courts-vacate-warrants-\nfor-unpaid-fines-and-fees; see also Emergency Order Vacating Warrants for Unpaid \nFines, Unpaid Restitution, Unpaid Court-Appointed Counsel Fees, and Other \nCriminal Fees (Me.

The Trial Court Emergency Administrative Order 20-\n2 curtailed some probation conditions, but more limits are necessary to protect the \nhealth of both defendants and the broader community. For instance, Order 20-2 \nsuspended drug testing by probation employees but specifically ordered testing by \noutside vendors to continue, noting that individuals “remain subject to sanctions for \nviolation of probation or conditions of pretrial release for non-compliance.”41 These \noutside entities pose no less risk of exposure to the defendant or their employees \nthan the testing administered by probation officers. Indeed, petitioners have learned \nthat at least one outside vendor, Averhealth in Lawrence, temporarily closed for \nCOVID-19 exposure, though it has since re-opened. Accordingly, this Court should \norder the trial courts to extend the drug testing suspension to all defendants—\nwhether it is a condition of probation or bail, and regardless of vendor—and to end \nany other conditions that cannot comport with physical distancing practices.  \nC.   Encourage prosecutors and police to exercise discretion to decrease the \nnumber of people taken into custody.  \n \nFinally, this Court can and should exercise its superintendence authority to \ninform the exercise of discretion by prosecutors and police departments during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. Alongside the trial courts, these actors have significant power \n                                                           \n41 Trial Court Order 20-2, supra n.36. \n23 \n \n\nto decrease the number of individuals entering the criminal system. This Court \nshould encourage them to do so.  \nSadly, the availability of court personnel, prosecutors, and defense counsel \nmay soon be more restricted, and not just by the need to work remotely. Schools are \nclosed. People are getting sick. And visiting clients—even when the visit is “non-\ncontact” as between attorney and client—may be unsafe. Under these dire and \nunprecedented circumstances, it may be challenging to ensure that defendants are \nafforded the assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution and article 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Cf. ABA \nComm. on Ethics and Prof’l Responsibility, Formal Op. 06-441 (2006). Simply put, \nas Chief Justice Gants has already recognized, due to the COVID-19 pandemic \ncourts have “little choice but to ration justice.”42 Potential cases, accordingly, may \nneed to be triaged.  \nThis Court can guide that process. In an analogous context, where the \nnumbers of relevant cases exceeded the numbers of available lawyers, this Court \npreviously urged prosecutors to dismiss “large numbers” of cases. Bridgeman v. Dist. \nAtt’y for the Suffolk Dist., 476 Mass. 298, 325 (2017) (addressing the Hinton Lab \ncrisis). Here, too, this Court should urge prosecutors to exercise their “sound \ndiscretion to reduce substantially” the number of defendants in the Commonwealth. \n                                                           \n42 Letter to the Bar from Chief Justice Ralph D. Gants, (Mar. 20, 2020). \n24 \n \n\nIndeed, reducing the number of criminal cases may soon be necessary in order to \nconserve legal resources and assure the availability of counsel in cases that, in the \nCommonwealth’s view, involve a direct physical threat to public safety. \nThis Court should likewise urge police departments to exercise their sound \ndiscretion to limit the numbers of custodial arrests during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nArrests themselves may threaten public safety, because they require physical \ninteraction at arrest, at booking, and during procedures that are simply incompatible \nwith physical distancing. Each of these interactions could risk the health of arrestees, \nlaw enforcement officers, and the community. Presumably for these reasons, the \nSuperior Court for the District of Columbia has issued an order enabling law \nenforcement to release an individual not otherwise eligible for release under D.C. \nlaw, upon approval of the prosecuting authority.43 This Court should likewise \nencourage Massachusetts police departments to forego custodial arrests when \npossible during this state of emergency. \nII.  This Court should exercise its superintendence powers to significantly \nreduce the pretrial detained population. \n \nFor reasons similar to those discussed in the previous section, this Court \nshould instruct the trial courts that the danger of COVID-19 must be considered as a \nsignificant mitigating factor in any bail reconsideration analysis. In addition, under its \n                                                           \n43 See Order, D. C. Sup. Ct. (Mar. 16, 2020), https://www.dccourts.gov/sites/\ndefault/files/Order_3-16-20.pdf. \n25 \n \n\nsuperintendence powers pursuant to G. L. c. 211 § 3, and its authority under G. L. \nc. 248, § 25, this Court should grant a writ of habeas corpus for the immediate \nrelease of the following categories of individuals44 currently held pretrial: \n  Individuals held on unaffordable bail under G. L. c. 276, § 58; \n \n  Individuals held on a bail revocation for a technical violation of their \nconditions of release. \n \n  Individuals over the age of 60 and thus at increased risk of severe COVID-\n19 complications and death; 45 and \n  Individuals who have a condition or disease that puts them at increased \nrisk of severe COVID-19 complications and death, including \ncardiovascular and respiratory disease, diabetes, and liver disease.46  \n \nThis release would mirror similar actions undertaken by the Supreme Court of \nSouth Carolina,47 be consistent with the statements of four elected prosecutors in \nMassachusetts,48 and comport with constitutional due process requirements. \n“Under the due process clause, a pretrial detainee may not be punished prior \nto an adjudication of guilt in accordance with due process of law.” Richardson v. \nSheriff of Middlesex Cty., 407 Mass. 455, 461 (1990) (cleaned up). As a result, \n                                                           \n44 Of course, should an individual, knowing the risks, wish to remain incarcerated, \nthey should be permitted to do so.  \n45 The World Health Organization identifies people over sixty as being at increased \nrisk for severe COVID-19. See World Health Organization, Coronavirus Disease \n2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report – 51 (Mar. 11, 2020), https://www.who.int/docs/\ndefault-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200311-sitrep-51-covid-19.pdf, at 2. \n46 See Ompad Affidavit, supra n.4, at ¶ 5(b). \n47 Chief Justice Beatty Memorandum, supra n.28.  \n48 Fair and Just Letter, supra n.26.  \n26 \n \n\nconfining pretrial detainees “in such a manner as to cause them to endure genuine \nprivations and hardship over an extended period of time” violates constitutional \nprotections when such conditions are “not reasonably related to a legitimate \ngovernmental objective.” Id. (cleaned up). Continuing to detain the categories of \nindividuals listed above during this pandemic raises exactly these concerns. \nFirst, this Court has previously held that requiring pretrial detainees to “sleep \non floors without any mattresses,” share inadequate toilet access, or double bunk in \ncrowded areas, each constitutes a “genuine privation[] and hardship” that triggers \nconstitutional analysis. Id. at 462-465. Forcing every pretrial detainee to risk serious \nillness or death during a public health emergency is, of course, worse. Pretrial \ndetention should not be a death sentence. \nSecond, pretrial detention for the categories of individuals listed above, under \nthe current circumstances, is not reasonably related to any legitimate government \ninterest. As this Court has made clear, dangerousness cannot be a consideration in \nsetting bail under G. L. c. 276, § 58. See Brangan, 477 Mass. at 706-707. \nAccordingly, safety considerations play no role in holding pretrial detainees on an \nunaffordable bail under § 58. Similarly, there is no indication of dangerousness for \npeople held on a bail revocation for a technical violation of their conditions of \nrelease. Finally, the letter signed by the four Massachusetts District Attorneys \nadvocates for the immediate release of two groups whose continued detention also \n27 \n \n\ncannot reasonably be justified on dangerousness grounds under the current \ncircumstances, namely (a) individuals who are elderly, and (b) individuals classified \nas vulnerable by the CDC due to underlying medical conditions.49 \nIII.   This Court should exercise its superintendence powers to reduce the \nsentenced prisoner population. \n \nFinally, this Court should exercise its authority under G. L. c. 211, § 3, to \ndrastically reduce the number of individuals now confined in Massachusetts prisons \nand jails pursuant to a sentence imposed by a judge.  \nFailure to reduce the density of Massachusetts correctional facilities will result \nin cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment and article \n26. “[I]t is cruel and unusual punishment to hold convicted criminals in unsafe \nconditions.” Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 315–316 (1982). Supreme Court \nprecedent makes clear that, pursuant to this principle, the Eighth Amendment does \nnot tolerate “exposure of inmates to a serious, communicable disease.” McKinney, \n509 U.S. at 33. Given the impossibility of physical distancing, the lack of adequate \nhygiene, and the reported cases of COVID-19 in Massachusetts correctional \nfacilities, everyone incarcerated in Massachusetts is currently exposed to a serious, \ncommunicable disease, in violation of the Eighth Amendment and article 26. \nConfining incarcerated people to a setting where they will likely contract a \ndeadly disease also violates due process. A valid criminal conviction may extinguish \n                                                           \n49 See Fair and Just Letter, supra n.26.  \n28 \n \n\ndue process concerns with respect to a lawfully imposed sentence, but the criminal \nprocess does not authorize deprivations “qualitatively different from the punishment \ncharacteristically suffered by a person convicted of crime.” Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. \n480, 493 (1980). Incarcerated people have a constitutionally-protected liberty \ninterest in avoiding “atypical and significant hardship . . . in relation to the ordinary \nincidents of prison life.” Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995); see also id. (a \nhardship may “exceed[] the sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to \nprotection by the Due Process Clause of its own force”). “Whether a particular \nrestraint imposes an ‘atypical and significant hardship’ depends, in turn, on its \n‘duration and degree.’” Torres v. Comm’r of Corr., 427 Mass. 611, 618 (1998), cert \ndenied, 525 U.S. 1017, (quoting Sandin, 515 U.S. at 486).  \nThis situation is far from typical. A serious threat of contracting a severe, life-\nthreatening illness is “a dramatic departure from the basic conditions” of prison life. \nSandin, 515 U.S. at 485. Contraction of COVID-19 was not “within the sentence \nimposed upon” these men and women by Massachusetts trial courts prior to the \npandemic. Montanye v. Haymes, 427 U.S. 236, 242 (1976). People confined in our \njails and prisons therefore face permanent injury or loss of life that was not imposed \npursuant to due process of law. \nTherefore, to accomplish a reduction in the number of incarcerated persons, \nand at the very least ensure there is no double bunking or large numbers of sleeping \n29 \n \n\npeople in the same room, this Court should issue orders (or amend existing rules)50 \ndirecting the Trial Court and relevant custodians to release individuals, with or \nwithout conditions, who fall into one or more of the following categories: \n  Individuals who are eligible for parole as a matter of law under G. L. c. \n127, § 133, and who are incarcerated solely for an offense or offenses not \nappearing in G. L. c. 265; \n \n  Individuals who will complete their sentence and be entitled to release \nwithin six months;  \n \n  Individuals incarcerated as a result of a finding of a violation of probation \nor parole that does not include the allegation of a new criminal offense; \n \n  Individuals who are over the age of 60 and thus at increased risk of severe \nCOVID-19 complications and death, and are incarcerated solely for an \noffense or offenses not appearing in G. L. c. 265 (crimes against the \nperson); \n \n  Individuals who have been diagnosed with a condition or disease that puts \nthem at increased risk of severe COVID-19 complications and death, \nincluding cardiovascular and respiratory disease, diabetes, and liver \ndisease;  \n \n  Individuals who qualify for medical parole under G. L. c. 127, § 119A; \n \n  Individuals serving a sentence in a house of correction for an offense not \nappearing in G.L. c. 265; and \n \n  Any other individuals for whom a release or stay is appropriate. See \nCommonwealth v. Charles, 466 Mass. 63 (2013).  \n                                                           \n50 For example, this Court could immediately amend Rule 29 of the Massachusetts \nRule of Criminal Procedure to permit, in cases of pandemic and where a state of \nemergency has been declared, the revision of sentences by judges other than the trial \njudges and could waive the usual sixty-day time frame for such revisions. \n30 \n \n\n \nAs the Supreme Court has emphasized, “[t]here is no iron curtain drawn \nbetween the Constitution and the prisons of this country.” Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 \nU.S. 539, 555-556 (1974). Under the current circumstances, releasing people in the \ncategories listed above is necessary “to dramatically reduce the number of \nincarcerated individuals and the threat of disastrous outbreaks.”51  \nCONCLUSION \nThere are about 16,500 human beings in our prisons and jails. 52 None of \nthem have been sentenced to death. Yet, without aggressive and immediate \nintervention, COVID-19 will likely kill many of them. This is intolerable. This Court \nshould reduce the number of deaths by ordering the release of individuals whose \ncontinued incarceration cannot be justified under these life-or-death circumstances. \nTime is of the essence. This Court is the only entity that can act in time to mitigate \nthe coming catastrophe in our jails and prisons. It should do so.  \n \n[counsel signature block on next page] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n51 Fair and Just Letter, supra n. 26.  \n52 See Mass.

      "text": "Supreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth    Full Court:   SJC-12926      Filed: 4/22/2020 3:14 PM\nCOMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS \nSUPREME JUDICIAL COURT \nSUFFOLK, ss.  No. SJC-12926 \n \nCOMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC COUNSEL SERVICES & ANOTHER, \nPetitioners \n \nv. \n \nCHIEF JUSTICE OF THE TRIAL COURT & OTHERS, \nRespondents \n \n \nSUFFOLK COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY RACHAEL ROLLINS \nRESPONSE TO THE MOTION TO RECONSIDER \n \nSuffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins \nhas  continued  to  work  expeditiously  to  protect  the \npeople  of  Suffolk  County  --  outside  and  inside  the \nprison  walls  --  in  response  to  the  global  health \ncrisis presented by COVID-19. To that end, as of last \nFriday, our staff reviewed more than 630 cases, 563 of \nwhich  were  pre-trial.  Of  the  503  pre-trial  dockets \nreviewed, we assented to 200 motions, representing 127 \n1\nindividuals.   As  of  the  same  date,  we  have  received \nonly  60  post-conviction  motions.  Based  on  these \nmotions and the extraordinary challenges presented by \nthis pandemic we will continue to work as quickly as \npossible but ask the Court to address three issues we \n                                                 \n1\n  Despite the Commonwealth’s assent to 200 motions, \nonly 50 individuals have been released. \n\n \n  2\nsee escalating daily: 1) the lack of public access to \nhearings on emergency matters in the trial court; 2) \nthe lack of widespread testing inside prisons; and 3) \nthe  need  to  implement  a  process  whereby  those \nindividuals  that  remain  incarcerated  can  effectively \nsocial distance. \nTurning  now  to  the  petitioners’  arguments,  they \nurge the Court to allow for presumptive release of a \ncategory  of  post-conviction  defendants  and  to  permit \nthe  allowance  of  a  stay  where  there  is  no  pending \nappeal  or  motion  for  new  trial.  We  respectfully \nrequest that those suggestions be rejected. \nFirst,  though  the  petitioners  treat  pre-trial \ndetainees  and  post-conviction  detainees  as  the  same, \nunder  the  law  they  are  not.  Pre-trial  detainees  are \nmerely accused of a crime; a post-conviction detainee \nhas  been  proven  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  to  have \ncommitted  a  crime.  Additionally,  many  times  a  grand \njury and a trial jury have heard the facts presented \nagainst the defendant and found that the Commonwealth \nhas  met  its  burden.  Legal  standards  concerning  their \nrelease, even in light of extraordinary circumstances, \nshould reflect that significant difference. \n\n \n  3\nSecond, the ability of a judge to allow a stay in \nthe  absence  of  a  pending  post-conviction  motion  or \nappeal  is  constrained.  In  Massachusetts,  a  sentence \nSee\nonce imposed must be executed forthwith.   G.L. c. \n279,  §  4.  The  rules  of  criminal  and  appellate \nprocedure codify that a judge may stay the execution \nof  a  sentence.  Mass.  R.  Crim.  P.  31;  M.R.A.P.  6.  A \njudge also has an inherent authority to issue a stay. \nSee Commonwealth v. Charles\n  , 466 Mass. 63, 72 (2013). \nHowever, inherent authority to stay is limited in that \nsee  Commonwealth  v. \nthe  exercise  must  be  lawful, \nMcLaughlin\n,  431  Mass.  506,  520  (2000),  and  the \ndefendant  must  “satisfy  the  necessary  criteria  for  a \nstay  in  the  execution”  of  his  or  her  sentence, \nCharles\n, 466 Mass. at 75. The necessary criteria, even \nwhere a judge issues a stay under his or her inherent \npower, “are the same as those relating to a stay of \nId\nexecution of sentence pending appeal.”  . at 77. The \ninherent  authority  of  a  judge  to  stay  “‘does  not \nextend  so  far  as  to  permit  a  further  stay  of  the \nsentence  on  independent  grounds  not  affecting  the \nMcLaughlin\nlegality or propriety of the conviction.’”  , \nCommonwealth v. Hayes\n431 Mass. at 517 (quoting  , 170 \n\n \n  4\nMass.  16,  17  (1897)).  Because  of  that,  an  appeal  or \npost-conviction motion which challenges the propriety \nor  legality  of  a  conviction  or  sentence  must  be \npending for a stay to be entered lawfully. \nAny  standard  governing  whether  or  not  it  is \nappropriate  to  grant  a  stay  must  include  not  only  a \nconsideration  of  whether  a  defendant  has  presented  a \ncolorable appellate or post-conviction claim but also \na  weighing  of  the  general  and  specific  health  risks \nposed by the COVID 19 pandemic alongside the risk that \nthe  defendant  will  flee  and  the  danger  posed  by  the \nSee Christie v. Commonwealth\ndefendant’s release.    , 484 \nMass.  397,  398  (2020).  Absent  from  the  petitioners \nproposal  in  its  motion  to  reconsider  is  any  real \nconsideration of those necessary factors. \nCharles\n  is  instructive  on  this  point.  Two  years \nafter  pleading  guilty  to  reduced  charges  related  to \ncontrolled  substances  and  unlawful  possession  of \nammunition,  Charles  moved  to  stay  execution  of  his \nsentence  when  he  learned  of  the  misconduct  in  the \nstate’s Hinton Drug Laboratory. He then filed a motion \nfor  a  new  trial,  raising  claims  pertaining  to  the \nalleged  misconduct  at  Hinton.  The  “magnitude  of  the \n\n \n  5\nserious  allegations  of  serious  and  far-reaching \nmisconduct”  constituted  “exceptional  circumstances” \nthat  warranted  the  judge's  exercise  of  his  inherent \npower  to  stay  the  execution  of  Charles's  sentences \npending the disposition of his motion for a new trial. \nCharles\nIn  ,  the  inherent  power  to  stay  execution  of \nsentence  was  thus  extended:  a  judge  could  do  so  not \njust pending an appeal, but also pending a motion for \nCharles\nnew  trial.  However,  even  in  ,  this  Court \nexpressly held that even in exceptional circumstances \na  defendant  must  still  show  that  he  or  she  has  a \ncolorable post-conviction or appellate claim and that \nSee\nhe  or  she  does  not  pose  a  danger  if  released.   \nCharles\n,  466  Mass.  at  75.  That  holding  echoes \nMcLaughlin Hayes \n and all the way back to the 1800s in \nand  contemplates  that  to  be  a  lawful  exercise  of  a \nstay  there  must  be  a  challenge  to  the  conviction  or \nsentence itself. \nIn  part,  trial  courts  have  not  granted  stays \nallowing  post-conviction  individuals  to  be  released \nbecause  such  stays  have  not  been  requested.  In  the \nover two weeks since this Court issued its decision, \nthe Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office has only \n\n \n  6\nreceived 60 motions to stay, reflecting just 3.3% of \nthe approximately 1,819 individuals serving sentences \n2\nfor convictions arising out Suffolk County cases.  This \ndata suggests that the number of individuals who have \nbeen  released  is  low  because  the  number  of  motions \nseeking to stay their sentences is low. \nGoing forward, in order to facilitate expeditious \nreview  of  such  motions,  the  Suffolk  County  District \nAttorney’s  Office  asks  that  this  Court  give  guidance \nabout  motions  to  stay  and  explain  that  such  motions \nmust contain, in Suffolk County at the very least: \n \n1. the defendant’s name; \n \n2. the docket number(s); \n \n3. the  crime(s)  for  which  the  defendant  was \nsentenced; \n \n4. the sentence received;  \n \n5. where the defendant is housed;  \n \n6. the basis for relief; \n \n7. information  about  which  of  the  CDC’s  20 \nlisted  underlying  medical  conditions  the \ndefendant  has  been  diagnosed  with  rendering \n3\nthem more susceptible to contracting COVID-19.  \n                                                 \n2\n  Of these individuals, 400 are in the custody of \nthe  Suffolk  Sherriff  and  the  remainder  are  in  the \ncustody of the Department of Corrections. \n3\n Based on what is known now, the CDC states that those \nat  high-risk  for  severe  illness  from  COVID-19  are: \npeople  65  years  and  older;  people  who  live  in  a \nCommittee \nnursing home or long-term care facility. See \nfor Pub. Counsel Servs. & Another v. Chief Justice of \nthe Trial Court & Others\n, 484 Mass. 431, at *10, 19 \nn.16  (2020);  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/  2019-\nncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html \n\n \n  7\n \n8. include medical records (or a statement that \nmedical records were requested on a certain \ndate); and \n \n9. a plan for the defendant’s release. \nIt  is  extremely  difficult  to  quickly  respond  to \n4\nmotions that do not contain this basic information.  \nThe  Suffolk  County  District  Attorney’s  Office \nalso requests a reasonable amount of time to respond \nto  such  motions.  As  noted  above  we  have  received  60 \npost-conviction  motions  to  stay,  15  (25%)  of  which \nwere  filed  in  the  past  week  alone.  We  have  already \n                                                                                                                                     \n(last visited April 22, 2020). Additionally, people of \nall  ages  may  be  high-risk  if  they  have  underlying \nmedical  conditions,  particularly  if  not  well \ncontrolled, including those with chronic lung disease \nor moderate to severe asthma, those with serious heart \nconditions, and people who are immunocompromised. Many \nconditions can cause a person to be immunocompromised, \nincluding  cancer  treatment,  smoking,  bone  marrow  or \norgan  transplantation,  immune  deficiencies,  poorly \ncontrolled  HIV  or  AIDS,  and  prolonged  use  of \ncorticosteroids  and  other  immune  weakening \nmedications.  Also  at  risk  are  people  with  severe \nobesity (body mass index of 40 or higher); people with \ndiabetes;  people  with  chronic  kidney  disease \nundergoing dialysis; and people with liver disease. \n4\n  The  efforts  to  move  expeditiously  have  been \nsignificantly  hampered  by  the  inability  to  access \ncritical  data  from  our  law  enforcement  partners, \nincluding  real  time  information  about  those \nindividuals  who  have  actually  been  released.  Enacted \nin 2018, G.L. c. 6A, § 18 ¾ mandates the sharing of \ninformation.  This  simply  is  not  happening.  District \nAttorney Rollins again specifically asks this Court to \nhighlight the urgency of this real need and to order \nthe sharing of information in full compliance of the \nlaw. \n\n \n  8\nresponded  to  24  (40%)  of  these  motions  and  do  so \ntypically  within  four  business  days,  despite  the \nfourteen  day  timeframe  set  forth  in  the  standing \norders.  However,  time  is  required  to  pull  the \nnecessary  trial  files,  to  run  records,  to  obtain \ndisciplinary  reports,  to  try  to  get  medical  records, \nand  to  file  a  written  response  to  each  defendant’s \nmotion. Without the review of those documents, all of \nwhich  are  necessary  to  assess  the  claims,  Assistant \nDistrict  Attorneys  would  be  unable  to  reasonably, \nintelligently,  and  ethically  respond  to  the  filed \nmotion.  Indeed,  22  of  the  50  Superior  Court  post-\nconviction  COVID  motions  in  Suffolk  County  are \nhomicide  convictions.  Each  requires  significant  time \nto  carefully  examine  the  voluminous  trial  record,  to \nensure  that  victim’s  families  are  properly  contacted \nas required by G.L. c. 258B, to respond in writing to \nthe motion, and to have a hearing. None of that can \nreasonably,  intelligently,  effectively  or  ethically \nhappen in 48 hours as the petitioners suggest. \nThe Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office has \nalso recognized two distinct problems that have arisen \nsince  the  issuance  of  the  opinion  in  this  case.  The \n\n \n  9\nfirst  is  that  obtaining  medical  records  has  been  a \nstumbling  block  for  both  defense  counsel  and  the \nCommonwealth.  For  example,  the  Commonwealth  assisted \ncounsel in one stay request in an effort to obtain the \ndefendant’s  medical  records  to  confirm  for  the  trial \ncourt  the  claims  made  in  the  motion  to  stay. \nCommonwealth  v.  Watson\n,  Docket  No.  8084CR28954.  Even \nwith  the  assistance  of  the  Department  of  Correction, \nthe  parties  did  not  receive  the  medical  records  for \n5\nten  days.   The  bar  needs  guidance  as  to  how  to \nefficiently  address  that  problem  going  forward  as \nthese  records  are  vital  and  necessary  for  the \nresolution of the motions presented. \nThe  second  problem  not  yet  contemplated  by  this \nCourt  is  that  many  hearings  on  emergency  matters  in \nthe  trial  courts  are  being  held  in  contravention  to \nthe  First  and  Sixth  Amendment  right  to  a  public \ncourtroom  and  G.L.  c.  258B(b),  the  Victim’s  Bill  of \nRights.  Most  troubling  is  that  G.L.  c.  258B(b) \n                                                 \n5\n  In  order  to  comply  with  the  Health  Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), \ninstitutions are constrained from providing access to \nmedical  records  without  the  inmate’s  signature.  At \ntimes,  these  signatures  are  challenging  to  obtain \nbecause of the lockdown of carceral facilities due to \nCOVID-19.  \n\n \n  10\nexplicitly states that a victim not only has a right \nto  be  notified  about  a  hearing  but  a  right  to  be \npresent\n.  However,  that  is  not  routinely  happening  in \nCommonwealth \nSuffolk County.  Just last week alone, in \nv. Rodriguez\n, Suffolk Superior Court No. 1984CR00134, \nwe requested that the victim’s mother in a child rape \ncase be permitted to call into the conference line to \nhear argument in a bail reduction hearing. The judge \nrefused  to  let  the  victim’s  mother  call  in  and  said \nthat the victim and her mother could listen but only \nin the presence of the Commonwealth. To try and comply \nwith the court’s order, when the court called the ADA \nassigned,  she  made  a  three  way  call  to  the  victim \nwitness  advocate,  who  then  made  a  three  way  call  to \nthe  victim’s  mother,  who  initially  missed  the  call. \nThe VWA was then dropped from the call. The victim’s \nmother  shortly  thereafter  called  back  the  VWA. \nUnfortunately,  the  hearing  was  underway  the  ADA  was \nstill on the phone arguing the bail motion and could \n6\nnot answer the VWA’s calls or texts into her phone.  \n                                                 \n6\n   As  recently,  as  this  past  Friday,  an  Assistant \nDistrict  Attorney  was  precluded  from  using  a \nspeakerphone  to  allow  others  to  listen  to  a  bail \nreconsideration hearing in a first degree murder case, \n\n \n  11\nBecause  the  mother  was  not  physically  with  the \nCommonwealth, she and her daughter did not participate \nin  the  process.  The  defendant’s  bail  was  reduced  to \n$5,000  and  he  was  released.  The  victim  was  not \n“present”  during  the  process  in  any  way,  shape  or \nform.  \nCommonwealth  v. Anthony  Kelley\nSimilarly,  in    , \nBoston  Municipal  Court  Dorchester  Division  No.  2007-\nCR-01044,  an  arraignment  of  a  eighteen  year  old  for \nthe  murder  of  a  seventeen  year  old  girl,  though  the \nvictim’s family was able to listen to the hearing, the \ndefendant’s  family  was  having  difficulty  making \narrangements  to  hear  the  arraignment  of  their  loved \none. Of course their loved one has a right under the \nSixth Amendment for the courtroom to be public and for \nSee Commonwealth v. Cohen\nhis family to be present.    , \nWaller  v. \n456  Mass.  94,  105-106  (2010)  (citing \nGeorgia\n,  467  U.S.  39,  46  (1984)).  Through  previous \nacquaintance with the office, the defendant’s brother \nwas able to obtain the number of the assigned homicide \nprosecutor  and  she  patched  in  the  defendant’s  family \n                                                                                                                                     \n0884CR10354,  because  she  was  told  speakerphone  use \ndeteriorates the recording of the hearing. \n\n \n  12\nto the call so that they could hear the arraignment. \nConstitutional rights should never be guaranteed only \nthrough acts of kindness. \nPre  COVID-19,  these  proceedings  would  have \nhappened in open court. Anyone could have walked into \nany  of  these  courtrooms  and  listened  to  the \nproceedings.  Now,  due  to  the  trial  court’s  inability \nor  refusal  to  adapt  or  evolve  technologically,  our \nvictims and family members of victims, the public, and \ndefendants  are  being  excluded  from  the  process.  This \n7\namounts  to  a  significant  constitutional  violation.  \nGiven the above, any reconsideration in this case must \ninclude  meaningful  and  concrete  steps  for  these \nemergency  hearings  in  the  trial  court  to  be  open  to \nthe  public  including  most  critically  victims  and \n8\ndefendant’s families.  \n                                                 \n7\n  For example, organizations such as CourtWatch and \nmembers of the media have likewise been excluded, an \nexclusion that may come to the detriment of “the basic \nfairness of the criminal trial and the appearance of \nfairness  so  essential  to  public  confidence  in  the \nSee Cohen  Press-\nsystem.”  , 456 Mass. at 106 (quoting\nEnterprise  Co.  v.

NO. SJC-12926 \n \nCOMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC COUNSEL SERVICES & \nMASSACHUSETTS ASSOCIATION OF CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYERS, \nPetitioners \n \nv. \n \nCHIEF JUSTICE OF THE TRIAL COURT,  \nRespondent \n______________________________________________________ \n \nRULE 16(l) LETTER BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS FOR THE BRISTOL, CAPE & \nISLANDS, ESSEX, HAMPDEN, MIDDLE, NORFOLK, & PLYMOUTH DISTRICTS \n______________________________________________________ \n   \n  Pursuant to the comments at the oral argument in the above-referenced case, we write to \noffer supplemental authority as to the violation of separation of powers that would result from \nthe proposed amendment to Mass. R. Crim. P. 29. \nIn response to the Court’s inquiry about the powers of the courts under Rule 29, or to \nenter a stay of some sort, various theories have now been propounded about how the expansion \nof such powers under the common law or the rules would be lawful.  In fact, if the rules permit \nsuch considerations and conduct then there is no need for extraordinary relief or supervisory \norders at all.  But the arguments now being proffered notably fail to mention that rules \ncontemplating a stay of sentence also require evidence of a meritorious appeal based upon an \nerror in the conduct of the trial.  Here, there is no evidence, or even an attempt to suggest there is \nevidence, of meritorious appeals.  They also fail to mention that motions to revise or revoke are \nprohibited from considering post-conviction events, because to do so would encroach on the \nconstitutional role of the executive branch in granting pardons, commutations, and parole. \n1 \n \n\n  Proposed amendment to Mass. R. Crim. P. 29 would in practical effect allow the \nsuspension of certain sentences until the conclusion of the COVID-19 State of Emergency.  \nSuspension of a lawfully imposed sentence violates articles 20 and 30 of the Massachusetts \nDeclaration of Rights, as the power to suspend laws lies only in the Legislature, and it is not for \nthe Judiciary to infringe upon. To the extent amendments in Rule 29 may be termed a “stay;” \nthere is no pending legal motion with an accordant legal issue tied to the conviction, as in \nCommonwealth v. Charles, 466 Mass. 63 (2013) to be resolved. Mass. R. Crim. P. 29 is designed \nto promote fairness in judicial decisions given the information at the time of imposition of \nsentence, and does not include post-conviction conduct.  Considering post-conviction events \nwould encroach on the constitutional role of the executive branch in granting pardons, \ncommutations, and parole.  Even in Commonwealth v. Tejeda, 481 Mass. 794, 797 (2019), where \nthis Court allowed a motion to revise and revoke based on a coventurer’s later-imposed sentence, \nthis Court noted that the disparity of the culpability between defendants was known at the time of \nthe sentencing. And the notion of a “nunc pro tunc” imposition of a sentence based on events that \noccurred post-sentencing is both a flawed post-hoc rationalization and an inappropriate use of the \ndoctrine to rewrite history.  See Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Juan, Puerto Rico v. \nAcevedo Feliciano, 140 S. Ct. 696 (2020) (“Put colorfully, ‘[n]unc pro tunc orders are not some \nOrwellian vehicle for revisionist history—creating ‘facts’ that never occurred in fact.’ . . . Put \nplainly, the court “cannot make the record what it is not.”’”) (cites omitted).1   \n \n1 The suggestion that other state courts (California, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, and North Dakota) \nhave exercised superintendence power to release prisoners under similar circumstances is an \ninapt comparison.  First of all, it does not appear that those courts are issuing supervisory orders \nor edicts.  Further, these state courts either elect judges or subject judges to recall by voters.  \nThus, any decision made by the courts can be checked by the voters at some level.  Such is not \nthe case in Massachusetts.  Though judges in Massachusetts are not elected, our state \n2 \n \n\n        Respectfully submitted,  \n        THOMAS M.

      "text": "BLACKSPINK \n  \nMarch  26,  2020 \nMaura  S.  Doyle,  Clerk \nSupreme  Judicial  Court for  The  County  of Suffolk \nJohn Adams  Court house,  15t  Floor \nOne  Pemberton  Square  —Suite  1300 \nBoston,  MA  02108-1707 \nRe:  Committee for Public  Counsel Services  and Massachusetts Association  of Criminal \nDefense  Lawyers  v.  Chief Justice  of the  Trial  Court,  No.  SJC-12926 \nDear  Clerk  Doyle, \nThe  Boston  chapter  of Black  and  Pink!  has  160  members  that identify  as \nLGBTQ  or  living with  HIV  currently  incarcerated  in  Massachusetts.  We  offer  our \nmembers  a  monthly  newsletter  and  an  opportunity to  be  paired  with  a  pen  pal.  We \nprovide  re-entry  services  to  formerly  incarcerated  people  such  as  emergency \nhousing,  food,  clothing,  and  referrals  to  medical  care.  Finally,  we  serve  on  the \nSpecial  Commission  to  Study the  Health  and  Safety  of LGBTQI  Prisoners?2. \n  \n1  Black  and  Pink  is  a  501(3)c  non-profit that serves  LGBTQ  (lesbian,  gay,  bisexual, \ntransgender,  those  questioning their  sexual  identity),  and  those  living  with  HIV who \nare,  or  were,  incarcerated.  We  send  a  monthly  newsletter to  over  14,000 \nincarcerated  LGBTQ  people  and  coordinate  a  robust pen  pal  program  that connects \nincarcerated  members  with  someone  from  the  “free  world”. \n2  Michael  Cox,  director  of policy  for the  Boston  chapter  of Black  and  Pink,  was \nappointed  by  Massachusetts  Attorney  General,  Maura  Healey,  to  serve  on  the  Special\nBLACKSPINK \n  \nWe  write  in  support of the  Petitioners’  request  for  relief and  respectfully urge \nthat any  relief granted  be  as  broad  and  far  reaching  as  possible. \nA.  COVID-19  and  People  Living with  HIV \nThe  Massachusetts  Department  of Correction  (DOC)  houses  approximately \n108  people  living with  HIV.  Of those  living  with  this  disease,  only  89%  are  virally \nsuppressed.  When  someone  living  with  HIV  is  not virally  suppressed,  the  HIV  is \nactively  replicating  and  attacking  a  person’s  immune  system.  Should  a  person  living \nwith  HIV who  is  not virally  suppressed  contract  COVID-19,  their  immune  system \nmay be  too  compromised  to  fight off the  disease.  Even  those  who  are  virally \nsuppressed  suffer  from  chronic  inflammation  which  would  be  exacerbated  should  a \nrespiratory  illness  be  caused  by  COVID-19.  People  living  with  HIV who  contract \nCOVID-19  may  not have  a  strong  enough  immune  system  to  survive  a  battle  with \nCOVID-19. \nBetween  2016-2017  there  were  304  people  living  with  HIV  in  county facilities, \nunder the  custody of their  local  Sheriff.  Between  2017-2018,  there  were  274.  For the \n  \nCommission  to  Study the  Health  and  Safety  of LGBTQI  Prisoners,  recently  formed  in \nthe  Criminal  Justice  Reform Act  (2018).  In  large  part,  this  commission  is  tasked  with \ninvestigating  the  correctional  system’s  treatment of LGBTQI  people  and  to  issue \nrecommendations  for  improvement.\nBLACKSPINK \n  \nfirst half of 2018,  there  were  at least  126  people  living  with  HIV  in  county  facilities. \nData  is  not available  to  indicate  to  what degree  they  are  virally  suppressed. \nHowever,  it should  be  noted  that  incarcerated  people  housed  in  county  facilities, \ncompared  to  those  committed  to  the  DOC,  receive  lower  quality  food,  fewer \nopportunities  to  exercise,  and  have  higher  stress  levels  which  further  impairs  an \notherwise  healthy  immune  system. \nThose  living  with  HIV,  regardless  of their  underlying  crime,  should  be  prioritized  in \nany  relief granted  by this  Court. \nB.  Broad  Relief \nThe  Petitioner’s  in  this  matter  are  seeking  relief based  on  various  criteria \nincluding:  pre-existing  medical  conditions,  parole  eligibility,  amount  of time  left to \nserve  on  a  committed  sentence,  those  serving  criminal  sentences  or  subject to  a \ndetainer  for technical  violations  of probation,  those  over  60  years  of age,  and  those \nwho  qualify  for  medical  parole.  This  Court  should  grant the  requested  relief and \nconsider  expanding  the  petitioned  criteria.\nBLACKSPINK \n  \nWe  encourage  this  Court to  go  one  step  further  and  to  not deny  relief to \nincarcerated  people  based  on  their  underlying  criminal  charge.  In  this  case,  that \nmeans  those  who  have  committed  a  crime  against another  person.  To  deny them \nrelief,  would  exclude  many vulnerable  people  from  the  mercy  and  compassion  that \nthe  COVID-19  requires.  It would  hamper the  amount of decarceration  necessary to \neffectuate  a  positive  public  health  outcome.  Surely,  a  simple  assault and  battery \nshould  not preclude  relief from  this  Court.  We  suggest  a  different metric  be  used  to \naddress  release  of incarcerated  people. \nC.  Preparedness  for  Release \nTo  date,  no  correctional  official  has  contacted  Black  and  Pink  for  support,  re- \nentry  resources,  or to  coordinate  housing  or transportation  for  anyone  in  their \ncustody.  We  remain  on  stand-by  should  anyone  released  need  our  assistance.  We \nhave  several  modes  of contact including  a  publicly  available  website  and  several \nsocial  media  accounts. \nD.  Death  Is  Final\nBLACKSPINK \n  \nThe  State  has  always  taken  a  vested  interest in  punishing  those  who  break \nthe  law.  However,  Commonwealth  outlawed  the  death  penalty years  ago.  TO  not \ngrant  relief may very well  equate  to  a  death  sentence  for  some  of the  most \nvulnerable  people  in  the  Commonwealth.  Granting the  release  of incarcerated \npeople  could  save  their  lives.  It could  spare  their  families  the  agony  and  grief of \ndeath.  These  are  extraordinary times  and  they  require  extraordinary  relief.  Most \npeople  serving  committed  sentences  will  be  released  one  day.  They will  return  to \ntheir  children,  family,  and  friends.  But  not if they  are  denied  relief and  succumb  to \nCOVID-19. \nConclusion \nWe  respectfully  request this  Court grant  all  relief requested  by the \nPetitioners  and  to  consider  expanding  relief regardless  of the  underlying  criminal \ncharge.  We  beg this  Court to  move  in  haste  and  to  defer to  public  health  experts. \nThe  Boston  chapter  of Black  and  Pink  remains  on  stand-by to  assist  anyone  released \nto  find  housing  and  appropriate  care. \nRespectfully  submitted  by,\nBLACKSPINK \n  \nMichael  Cox, \nOn  behalf of the  Boston  Chapter  of Black  and  Pink \n32  McPhee  Road \nFramingham,  MA  01701 \nCERTIFICATE  OF  SERVICE \nOn  March  27  2020,  I  served  a  copy  of this  letter  on  all  parties  by  email. \nWhol fgg \nMichael  Cox \nThe  Boston  chapter  of \n32  McPhee  Road \nFramingham,  MA  01701 \n617.992.6449 \nDate:  March  27,  2020\n",

      "text": " \n \nMarch 27, 2020 \n \nFrancis V. Kenneally, Clerk \nSupreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth \nJohn Adams Court House \nOne Pemberton Square - Suite 2500 \nBoston, MA 02108 \n \nRe: Committee for Public Counsel Services and Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense \nLawyers v. Chief Justice of the Trial Court, SJC-12926 \n \nDear Clerk Kenneally: \n \nOn behalf of the Massachusetts Office for Victim Assistance (MOVA), I am writing in response \nto EMERGENCY PETITION FOR RELIEF PURSUANT TO G. L. c. 211, § 3 (“The Petition”), \nfiled by the Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS) and Massachusetts Association of \nCriminal Defense Lawyers to the Superior Judicial Court on March 24, 2020. \n \nMOVA is an independent state agency that seeks to uphold and advance the rights of crime victims \nand witnesses throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  We provide grant funding, \ntraining, and support to over 160 direct service programs throughout the state and engage in public \npolicy advocacy and education at the state and federal levels.  MOVA is governed by the Victim \nand Witness Assistance Board, chaired by Attorney General Maura Healy, and our current \nmembership includes two district attorneys and two public members, one of whom is a survivor \nof crime.  \n \nVictim rights in Massachusetts are statutorily guaranteed though M.G.L. Chapter 258B.  While \nthe emergence of COVID-19 in Massachusetts and nationwide presents immense challenges, the \nCommonwealth should not abandon our obligations under state law to provide victims of crime \nwith their rights in the criminal justice system.  In our efforts to respond to COVID-19 concerns \nwithin correctional institutions, we must not lose sight of the needs of crime victims whose \nphysical, emotional, and mental safety is in jeopardy. It is of the utmost importance that the Court \nplaces victim safety, victim notification, and victim input as critical components to effectively \nensure the safe and reasonable release of any incarcerated persons. \n \nVictim safety must be a priority in the discussions relating to the release of offenders who \ncommitted crimes against them.  The Petition references individuals both during pre- and post-\nconviction stages of the criminal justice system.  It is important to recognize that an offender’s \npretrial release is often the most dangerous time for a victim.  This is particularly true for domestic \nviolence victims who, due to social distancing, are isolated in their homes more now than ever \nbefore with limited access to vital services.  The Petition also requests the release of individuals \nheld pretrial, while seeking to “vacate all provisions of probation orders, and cease issuing new \n\nprovisions in probation orders” without any mention of conditions related to electronic monitoring, \nstay away orders, and no contact orders which provide important safeguards to victims of crime.  \nThis  is  particularly  dangerous  as  the  Superior  Court  has  indicated  through  OE-144  Order \nConcerning The Imposition of Global Positioning System (GPS) Monitoring As Condition of \nRelease or of Probation that Courts shall not order GPS monitoring as a condition of release \nwithout extenuating circumstances.  Limited and/or lack of supervision for individuals released \nfrom custody or probation creates a real safety concern and tangible fear for victims of crime. \n \nThroughout the Petition, there is no clear delineation of crime type that applies, or is excluded, to \nbe considered for release.  For example, the Petition identifies crimes committed under M.G.L. \nChapter 265 to be excluded only for individuals eligible for parole, aged 60 or older, or serving in \na house of correction.  It is not clear the Chapter 265 exclusion would apply to other individuals \nidentified in the Petition (i.e. those who may be completing a sentence within six months, qualify \nfor medical parole, have underlying medical conditions, etc.).  In addition, the mention of Chapter \n265 as stated only applies to inmates serving a post-conviction sentence; this means that any \nindividual being held pretrial, regardless of crime, would be eligible for release.  This broad \napproach presents serious safety concerns for both victims and the general public.  It is also crucial \nto note that Ch. 265 is not the only statute that address crimes against persons; other statutes within \nMassachusetts law, such as M.G.L. Chapter 272, M.G.L. Chapter 209A Violations of Abuse \nPrevention Orders, and M.G.L. Chapter 258E Violations of Harassment Prevention Orders.  In \norder  to  protect  victims,  any  crime  committed  against  a  person  must  be  excluded  from \nconsideration of release. \n \nIn the aftermath of a crime, the Victim Rights Law ensures survivors that they will have access to \ninformation relative to the status of the offender, regardless of which entity may have custody.  \nOur response to COVID-19 should not change the requirements of our state authorities to provide \nadvance notice of any changes to an offender’s custody status.  Furthermore, M.G.L. Chapter 258B \nensures “for victims, to be informed in advance by the appropriate custodial authority whenever \nthe defendant receives a temporary, provisional or final release from custody…”  Any changes \nmade in response to this petition should ensure that custodial authorities can provide victims \nadequate, advanced notice to address safety concerns for them and their families.   The Petition \ndoes not provide any expectations of notification to victims of crime.  Advance notification \nempowers well-informed decision making and safety-planning and provides physical, mental, and \nemotional relief to survivors. \n \nVictim input, often through victim impact statements, is an incredibly important opportunity for \nvictims to share the impact the crime has had on their life.  Impact statements are used to inform \nsentencing, sex offender registration, and parole release decisions and conditions.  Victims often \noffer important insights to decisionmakers in strategies necessary to maintain their safety. The \nPetition requests the release of inmates eligible for standard parole or qualify for medical parole \nwithout any mention of following the regulations tied to these procedures, including parole \nhearings or impact statements.  In standard parole decisions, victims may submit a statement \ndescribing the impact of the crime and the victims’ opinion and/or recommendation regarding \nrelease.  It is imperative that victims have a voice in the process, in the same manners in which \nvictim impact statements are accepted in other release proceedings. \n \n\nConclusion and Recommendations \nMassachusetts is operating through unprecedented times, and our government must react in a way \nthat protects all citizens in a fair and just manner.  Victims of crime are already experiencing \nunique burdens relative to their safety and wellbeing during the COVID-19 crisis.  If the Court \nseeks to grant the petition and proceed with the release of inmates in Massachusetts, MOVA \nrecommends the following actions should apply: \n•  Consideration of release shall not apply to inmates convicted of any crime against a person; \nnot just inclusive of M.G.L. Chapter 265.  Domestic violence and sexual assault victims, \nfor example, would not uniformly fit under the Chapter 265 exclusion and are already put \nin greater risk through social distancing recommendations due to COVID-19.  In addition, \nat a minimum, inmates considered for release should be reviewed on a case by case basis.  \nEvery case, individual inmate, and victim associated with a crime have unique needs that \nmust be considered during these monumental decisions.  A blanket response or one that \ndifferentiates by crime type does not serve the best interest of not only victims, but all \nparties involved. \n•  Advanced notice of release must be provided in the same manner and timeframes expected \nby  victims  of  crime.    Regulations  established  in  Department  of  Criminal  Justice \nInformation Service (803 CMR 9.00) call for no less than a fourteen day period to provide \nadvance notice for any release from custody.  While we understand the need for prompt \ndecisions during the COVID-19 response, there must be a clear expectation that victims \nwill have enough time to make necessary safety planning decisions. \n•  Victims  must  have  an  opportunity  to  provide  input  in  release  decisions,  similar  to \nregulations  120  CMR  400.00.    This  includes  providing  ample  time  for  a  victim  to \nparticipate if desired.  Given the current circumstances, we recognize a shift from basic \nprotocol  may  be  necessary.    MOVA  welcomes  flexibility  in  providing  victims  the \nopportunity  to  be  heard,  including  the  collection  of  written  statements  or  remote, \nteleconference possibilities, but maintain that it is imperative for victims to remain part of \nthe process. \nThank you for your time and your consideration.  If I may be of any assistance, please do not \nhesitate to contact me. \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \nLIAM T.

On or \nabout March 23, 2020, Petitioners in the above referenced matter sought this Court's review and \nrelief, pursuant M.G.L. c.211, § 3, for, among other things, alleged violations by county \ncorrectional facilities of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 26 \nof the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights by subjecting inmates to the possibility of COVID-19 \ninfection as a result of continued detainment in said facilities.  Respondents in the present matter \nadamantly deny Petitioners contention that the continued detention of certain inmates committed \nto their care and custody by the courts amounts to \"cruel and unusual\" punishment in violation of \neither the Eighth Amendment or Article 26.  The Petitioners' claims are supported by speculation \nand innuendo, rather than factual information.  Moreover, the remedy sought by Petitioners, the \nwholesale release of irunates into their respective communities (without any substantive, \n1 Norfolk, Hampden, Berkshire, Suffolk, Middlesex, Essex, Franklin, Dukes, Worcester, Hampshire, Bristol, \nPlymouth, Barnstable and Nantucket. \n\nindividualized review) does not comport with remedies employed by courts in the past when \nattempting to ameliorate Eighth Amendment/A  rticle 26 violations.  Finally, the actual remedies \nPetitioners seek are short-sighted and are likely, in the end, to result in substantial harm to the \ninmates themselves, the already strained social services agencies still operating during this \npandemic and the general public.  Therefore, Respondents respectfully request the Court deny \nPetitioners' Petition to the extent Petitioners seek the blanket release of pre-trial and convicted \ninmates from county correctional facilities. \nB.  FACTUALBACKGROUND \nRespondents operate county correctional facilities in thirteen (13) counties in the \nCommonwealth.2  In operating these facilities, the Sheriffs' of said counties maintain twenty \nfour (24) hour, seven (7) day a week care and custody of approximately 8000 inmates.  This care \nencompasses providing inmates with basic necessities such as secure housing, food, clothing, \ntoilets, sinks, showers with warm water and soap, hygiene supplies, and a multitude of other \nbasic necessities.  In addition, the Sheriffs provide inmates with a multitude of educational, \nprogrammatic and medical and mental health services including, but not limited to healthcare for \nroutine and chronic inmate needs, operating and promoting medication assisted treatment MAT \nprogram (for opioid addiction), psychiatric and addiction counseling, cancer treatment, HIV \ntreatment, programs designed to teach inmates useful job skills, instruction in reading, math and \nother educational subjects, and many other services. \n2 Nantucket County does not have a correctional facility. \n2 \n\nRespondents acknowledge that the current COVID-I 9 pandemic represents a uniquely \ndangerous and unprecedented threat to the people of Massachusetts and the nation as a whole. 3 \nMoreover, the Respondents also acknowledge COVID-I 9 is contagious, can be severe! y \ndebilitating, and in a small percentage of cases, lethal.  That being said, Respondents, knowing \nthe severity of the situation, have instituted the following changes to their policies and \nprocedures to 1) stop the spread of COVID-19, 2) mitigate the risk of future spreading of \nCOVID-I 9; and 3) treat any inmates and/or employees subsequently infected by the contagion \n(in the interest ofbrevity Respondents have not listed each and every affirmative action taken by \nthe individual Counties to combat the COVID-19 virus and the Court is encouraged to review \neach County's extensive affidavit; however, for purposes of this pleading Respondents have \nhighlighted the major changes and policies and/or procedures implemented): \n•  Vigorous cleaning protocols instituted throughout each facility on a daily basis (for some \nfacilities on per shift basis). \n•  Each inmate has been provided with soap and access to sinks with wann water in their \ncells, dayrooms, kitchens, inmate restrooms and other areas of each individual facility. \n•  Hand sanitizing stations have been installed throughout certain facilities. \n•  Cleaning supplies, masks, gloves, gowns, and protective eyewear have been or are being \nacquired, are currently at sufficient levels and are being utilized as needed. \n•  Inmates have been educated on proper hand-washing and personal hygiene techniques. \n•  All general public visitation has been temporarily suspended. \n•  All vendors (non-essential) and volunteers have been temporary excluded from facilities. \n3 It should be noted the county correctional facilities in each of the thirteen (13) counties in the Commonwealth were \nable to successfully respond to other epidemics in the past such as SARS, MERS, HI N I, and seasonal Influenza \nwithout releasing inmates. \n3 \n\n•  All facility tours have been suspended. \n•  Inmate Work Release/Community Service Programs have been suspended. \n•  Conducting an enhanced screening process at a secure location within the facilities for all \nincoming inmates. These enhanced screening processes include, but are not limited to \nasking additional questions about whether inmates are experiencing signs or symptoms of \nCOVID-19 or have traveled or been exposed to someone who has the virus, taking \ntemperatures of incoming inmates,  quarantining new inmates for fourteen (14) days, \n•  Educating staff about the virus, the proper use of personal protective equipment and \nproper cleaning procedures. \n•  Conducting daily administrative meetings and roll call briefs to review any signs or \nsymptoms of the virus among staff or inmates and provide the latest infonnation. \n•  Temporarily suspending inmate transfers to and from other correctional facilities. \n•  Sanitizing transportation vehicles after each use. \n•  Providing inmates with additional phone calls and envelopes for continued \ncommunication. \n•  Limiting professional legal and clergy visits to non-contact visits. \n•  Complied with the Governor's order to keep non-essential employees from reporting to \nwork. \n•  If at any time there is a concern that the patient is exhibiting signs and or symptoms \nindicative of potential infection by COYID-19 virus, those individuals are placed in \nsingle cells in a specialized medical quarantine area for further monitoring and \nobservation, temperatures are taken and consultation with local hospital as necessary. \n4 \n\n•  Screening of employees coming to work by asking a specific set of questions regarding \ntheir well-being upon arrival and questions about recent travel by them or their household \nmembers. \n•  Some facilities are also taking the temperatures of incoming staff \n•  Employees have been educated that if they are sick with a fever or have flu-like \nsymptoms such as cough, sore throat, or shortness of breath, they should not report to \nwork and they are instructed to contact their supervisor to report symptoms and to consult \ntheir doctor. \n•  If an employee is sent home with concerning symptoms, they must follow a medical \nscreening process in order to return to work.  Employees who have family members who \nhave travelled to high risk areas, or are exhibiting signs and symptoms of the virus have \nbeen asked to stay at home until they are medically cleared to return to work. \n•  Establishing designated areas to house local police department arrestees prior to \narraignment for facilities that house \"safe keeps\".  Police Departments have been asked to \nimplement COVID-19 screening procedures at their stations prior to anyone being \ntransported to our facilities. \n•  Limiting unnecessary movement within and between facilities. \n•  Providing medical care in most facilities 24 hours per day 7 days per week. \n•  Conducting video conferencing daily with the local courts for arraigmnents, and all other \nnon-evidentiary proceedings. \n•  Conducting video court where available instead of transporting imnates out of the \nfacility. \n5 \n\n•  Collaborating with the local defense bar, the District Attorney's office and the courts to \nidentify individuals who are appropriate for release or transfer to lower security and/or \nday reporting on a GPS bracelet and we have honored these requests when appropriate. \n•  Responding to requests to review individuals with low bails who may be at risk, and \nassisting them with finding resources to bail out once a discharge plan is in place. \n•  Continuing to grant inmates earned good time.  Continuation of participation in \nappropriate programming to allow the opportunity for earned good-time with the use of \ntechnology and other resources. \n•  Establishing plans and identifying logistics should this pandemic enter our jail and house \nof corrections facilities.  These plans have been developed between our staff and our \nhealth care providers following DPH and CDC guidelines including isolation of \nconfirmed cases and coordination with local hospitals as appropriate. \n•  Established regular contact with CDC, DPH, local hospitals and other data sources to \nobtain the most recent infonnation. \n•  Some county correctional facilities have begun furloughing low-risk inmates back into \nthe community following a re-entry review. \n•  The total inmate capacity for all county correctional facilities as of March 25, 2020 was \napproximately 14,263. \n•  The total inmate population for all county correctional facilities as of March 10 , 2020 \nwas approximately 8640. \n•  The total inmate population for all county correctional facilities as of March 25, 2020 \nwas approximately 8000. \n6 \n\n•  The total number of inmates released from all county correctional facilities since March \n10, 2020 was approximately 1441. \n(See generally Affidavits and Exhibit B) \nAdditionally, Petitioners failed to address the following dangers to both the public and \nthe inmates themselves should the Court grant a wholesale release of all non-dangerous inmates: \n•  Lack of adequate housing, food, clothing and hygiene facilities for those inmates who are \nhomeless or who can no longer return to their previous place of residence; \n•  Lack of continued treatment for drug and alcohol addiction; \n•  Lack of adequate medical and psychiatric care for those with chronic conditions and \nthose needing assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs); \n•  Lack of employment (due to the COVID-19 shutdown); and \n•  Lack of insurance which would not be immediately available so that diabetic and other \ninmates with chronic medical conditions can continue to receive their medications. \n•  Additional pressures on our law enforcement efforts in the community when our officers \nhave been trying to minimize interactions that result in contact and potential arrest that \nmay not have otherwise occurred but for the premature release of that individual into the \ncommunity. \n•  Many are on medication assisted treatment (MAT).  If released without an appointment in \nthe community forMAT they will be at significant risk for overdose and death. \n(See generally Affidavits) \n7 \n\nC.  LEGALARGUMENT \n1.  The Continued Detention of Inmates in County Correctional Facilities is not a \nViolation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution or Article 26 \nof the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights \nThe continued detention of inmates by county correctional facilities during the COVID-\n19 pandemic does not violate the proscription against \"cruel and unusual punishment\" as set \nforth in the Eighth Amendment and Article 26.4 In order for the Petitioners to establish that the \nactions or inaction of Respondents in continuing to detain inmates rises to the level of \"cruel and \nunusual punishment\" Petitioners must show\"( 1) a prison's conditions of confinement present a \n'substantial risk of serious ham1'; and (2) prison officials acted with 'deliberate indifference' to \ninmate health or safety.\"  Torres v. Commissioner ofC  orrection, 427 Mass. 611, 613-614 (1998). \nSee Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994).  Petitioners have failed to do both. \nFirst, Petitioners have not established that the Sheriffs have acted with deliberate \nindifference. \"A prison official is deliberately indifferent where she knows of and disregards an \nexcessive risk to inmate health or safety.  This requirement is subjective.  Deliberate indifference \nis characterized by obduracy and wantonness, not inadvertence or error in good faith.  To show \nsuch a state of mind, the plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant had actual knowledge \nof impending harm, easily preventable, and yet failed to take the steps that would have easily \nprevented that harm.\" Leite v. Bergeron, 911 F.3d 47, 52-53 (1st Cir. 2018).  Petitioners fail to \ncite what action or inaction on the part of the Sheriffs, other than the lawful detention of inmates, \nrises to the level of deliberate indifference. Further, the Sheriffs establish, through supporting \n4 The Eighth Amendment and Article 26 text differ slightly insofar as the Eighth Amendment states \"cruel and \nunusual\" punishment and Article 26 states \"cruel or unusual\" punishment.  Torres v. Commissioner ofC  orrection, \n427 Mass. 611, 619 n.4 (I 998). However, the Court has found that Article 26 is\". .. at least as broad as the Eighth \nAmendment to the Federal Constitution.'\"  Good v. Commissioner of Correction, 417 Mass. 329, 335 ( 1994)(citing \nMichaud v. Sheriff of Essex County, 390 Mass. 523, 534 [1983]). \n8 \n\naffidavits, that they are not disregarding the risk of the spread of COVID-19, rather, they are \nemploying all measures feasible to prevent such spread.  (See generally Affidavits).  \"To violate \nthe Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, a prison official must have a sufficiently culpable \nstate of mind.\"  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834.  The record before this Court is devoid of any \nevidence which could establish the Sheriffs have acted with the requisite state of mind to \nestablish a violation of the Eighth Amendment simply by holding inmates they are lawfully \nrequired to do, and by taking extensive measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  It should \nbe noted that Petitioners in their argument failed to fully set forth the standard employed by \ncourts when evaluating Eighth Amendment/Article 26 violations as they apply to the conditions \nwithin a correctional facility.  While spending an inordinate amount of time describing the \ninsidious nature of the COVID-19 virus and its potential impact on the irunate population at the \ncounty correctional facilities in the thirteen (13) counties in the Commonwealth, Petitioners \nutterly failed to address whether or not Respondents have exhibited \"deliberate indifference\" to \nthis looming threat.  The reason for this glaring omission is that Petitioners cannot meet this legal \nthreshold.  In fact, Petitioners failed to provide any evidence that Respondents, having been \nmade aware of the COVID-19 pandemic, simply sat back and did nothing.  (See generally \nAffidavits) Moreover, this Court has held that the legal standard required for the Eighth \nAmendment cannot be established by a so-called expert report such as the one submitted by \nPetitioners as the question of\"whether prison conditions are sufficiently harmful to establish an \nEighth Amendment violation is purely a legal detennination for the court to make.  Therefore, \nexpert opinion regarding what constitutes cruel and unusual punishment is entitled to little \nweight.\"  Torres, 427 Mass. at 614; see also Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 348 n.13 (1981). \nThe record establishes the Sheriffs have not disregarded the risk of COVID-19, and as such, \n9 \n\nPetitioners are not entitled to the relief they seek as \"a prison official cannot be found liable \nunder the Eighth Amendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless \nthe official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety. Farmer , 511 \nU.S. at 837. \nSecond, Petitioners have not provided any evidence that correctional facilities in the \nCommonwealth represent a substantial risk of hann to inmates due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nPetitioners rely upon an affidavit from an Associate Professor of Epidemiology in New York, \nwho to Respondents' knowledge has never stepped foot inside their county correctional facilities \nand has no direct knowledge whatsoever of current conditions at any county correctional \nfacilities in Massachusetts.  Petitioners rely upon conjecture and innuendo to support their \nextraordinary request for relief.  The Petitioners have not submitted any evidence from any \nperson with actual knowledge of the current conditions in the Respondents' facilities.  However, \nas set forth above, Respondents have provided the Court with numerous affidavits, from \nindividuals with direct knowledge concerning the concrete steps taken to 1) mitigate the risk of \nCOVID-19 infection for inmates and employees; and 2) maintain a clean and safe facility for \nboth inmates and employees; and 3) evaluate appropriate inmates in conjunction with other \nagencies in the Commonwealth for transfer to lower security facilities, release, and GPS \nmonitoring. \nPetitioners failure to provide such supporting evidence is not surprising considering \nRespondents have submitted extensive affidavits from each of the Sheriffs· in all thirteen (13) \ncounties of the Commonwealth which operate correctional facilities setting forth well-educated \nand vigorous efforts to make significant and impactful changes to policies and procedures to \ncombat the COVID-19 pandemic.  For example, the county correctional facilities have instituted \n10 \n\nscreening and quarantine procedures for all incoming inmates or any inmates who may have had \nexposure, instituted employee screening when entering facilities, installed practical social \ndistancing protocols in facilities where the inmate count is down, instituted rigorous cleaning \nprocedures, restricted access by visitors, vendors and all non-essential personnel, instituted strict \nprotocols for incoming inmates, temporarily halted all non-essential inmate activities and travel \noutside their facilities, required non-essential personnel to work from home where possible, \neducated inmates and staff on personal hygiene and other measures to help avoid contracting the \nvirus, provided inmates with expanded access to soap and hand sanitizer, continued to acquire \nmedical supplies including masks, gloves, gowns, and protective eye-wear. \nFinally, certain county correctional facilities have begun to release inmates into their \ncommunities where it has been detennined, through a thoughtful, deliberate and individualized \nre-entry analysis, that the released inmate does not represent a danger to the public and such a \nrelease will not ultimately adversely impact the health and safety of the inmate.  Thus, it is not \nthe contention of Respondents that under no circumstances should inmates be released from \ncounty correctional facilities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; rather, any such release \nshould be completed by trained professionals after an extensive, albeit expedient, review process. \nSuch a review would be for the safety and welfare of both the inmate and the community at \nlarge.  Not only have Petitioners utterly failed to show deliberate indifference by the Sheriffs' in \nthe face ofthis unprecedented epidemic, the credible evidence establishes that the Sheriffs have \ngone well beyond the basic constitutional requirements and instituted vigorous and thoughtful \nmeasures designed to minimize the impact of the virus. \n11 \n\n2.  The Remedy Sought by Petitioners Is Inappropriate in Cases Involving Violations of \nthe Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and/or Article 26 of \nthe Massachusetts Declaration of Rights \nEven if the Court were to find that the Sheriffs' in charge of the county correctional \nfacilities throughout the Commonwealth were deliberately indifferent to the substantial risk of \nhann to inmates in their custody from COVID-19 (which Respondents vehemently deny), the \nremedy sought is inappropriate in the context of an Eighth Amendment/ Article 26 violation.  In \nthe past, the Court has taken remedial action where conditions at a county correctional facility \nhave risen to the level of an Eighth Amendment/Article 26 violation.  Michaud, 390 Mass. at \n534.  Any analysis concerning potential remedial action involved a balancing test between the \npublic interest and the constitutional rights of inmates.  !d.  In Michaud v. Sheriffo  fE  ssex \nCounty, 390 Mass. 523 (1983), the Court found Eighth Amendment/Article 26 violations where a \ncorrectional facility failed to provide inmates with flushing toilets and hot and cold running \nwater despite having knowledge of the conditions and not remediating the problem.5  !d. at 524-\n526, 533-534.  The Court considered whether to immediately close the facility or allow the \nCounty additional time to complete the repairs.  !d. at 534.  The Court afforded the County \nadditional time to correct the conditions.  !d. at 535.  In doing so, the Court noted that to close \nthe facility would either result in the overcrowding of other correctional facilities in the \nCommonwealth or a release of inmates into the community.  !d.  \"The result would be either \nfurther overcrowding or an arbitrary prisoner release program. Neither of these alternatives is in \nthe public interest.\" !d.  Similarly, in Pridgett v. Commissioner a/Correction, 443 Mass 1016 \n(2005), this Court held in a M.G.L. c. 211, § 3 petition challenging the constitutionality of an \ninmate's conditions of confinement, as Petitioners do in the present matter, \"even if the petitioner \n5 The lower court had issued an order for the repairs to be made by a date certain and the County failed to meet that \ndeadline. !d. at 524-526. \n12 \n\ncould show that the conditions ofhis confinement are unlawful, he would be entitled only to \nmodification of the conditions rather than immediate release.\" Id. at 1017. \nIn the present matter before the Court, Petitioners seek the arbitrary release of both pre \ntrial and convicted inmates.  Specifically, Petitioners seek, among other things, the release of: \n•  Individuals who will complete their sentence and be entitled to release within six months; \n•  Individuals incarcerated as a result of a finding of a violation of probation or parole that \ndoes not include the allegation of a new criminal offense; \n•  Individuals who are over the age of 60 and this at increased risk of severe COVID-19 \ncomplications and death, and are incarcerated solely for an offense or offenses not \nappearing in G.L. c.265 (crimes against the person); \n•  Individuals who have been diagnosed with a condition or disease that puts them at \nincreased risk of severe COVID-19 complications and death including cardiovascular and \nrespiratory disease, diabetes and liver disease; \n•  Individuals who qualify for medical parole; \n•  Individuals serving a sentence in a house of correction for an offense not appearing in G. \nL. c.265; and \n•  Any other individual for whom a release or stay is appropriate. \n(Petitioners' Brief, 30) \nA review of the above remedy sought shows that Petitioners seek what is tantamount to a \nwhole-sale release of inmates in an arbitrary manner.  Such a proposed remedy would disregard \nthe Court's reasoning in Michaud and fail to allow the Respondents the opportunity to remediate \nany deficient conditions.  See also Pridgett, 443 Mass. at l 017. \n13 \n\n3.  The Remedy Sought By Petitioners May Result In Harm to the Public and the \nReleased Inmates \nPetitioners request for relief, the release of certain individuals being held or serving time, \nusing blanket standards including but not limited to the inmates age, how much time is left in \ntheir sentence, whether they were incarcerated for a probation violation or a violation of bail \nconditions as well as other conditions, may in fact endanger the inmates themselves.  As this \ncourt is aware, in these county con·ectional facilities, individuals are not just housed there, the \nmajority of individuals are being treated for numerous medical, mental health, and addiction \nissues. To release these individuals as the Petitioners request, does in fact endanger their health \nand welfare, as all the medical, psychological and therapy services will come to an abrupt stop. \nPresently a large portion of the inmate population being held at the county correctional facilities \nare related to the opiate addiction epidemic which presently exists in the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts and nationwide. In an effort to combat this epidemic the county correctional \nfacilities have implemented, as required by the legislation, a MATS programs at each of their \nfacilities. These MATS programs involve counseling, therapy and Suboxone, to abruptly halt any \nof these treatments, is assuring that these individuals upon release and without support systems \nwill more likely than not fall into the same dangerous situations they were in prior to their \nincarceration. This not only endangers the individuals but the community the imnate will be \nreleased into as well. The goal of Corrections is to assist the imnate to reenter the community \nwith the right support systems and assistance in place in order to transition successfully back in \nsociety, and not re-offend. \nFurther, a number of individuals throughout the county correctional facilities, are also \nreceiving medical treatment for chronic issues including cancer, HIV, diabetes and other medical \n14 \n\nissues which require treatment on a regular basis. These treatments also will come to an abrupt \nhalt if the irunate does not have health insurance or any other way to continue said medical \ncare.  Also, the Petitioners in their request are not considering that a number of these inmates \nmay not have a place to go reside. To release any individuals without assuring that they have a \nsafe place to reside is a reckless and dangerous way to introduce an irunate back to the \ncommunity.  For the above reasons as well as others that the responded would like to be heard on \nwe asked the court to consider that a blanket policy as requested by the petitioners is doing a \ndisservice to both the individuals that they seek to protect, as well as, the community these \nindividuals will go to.  That is why the Sheriffs though they did not oppose the release of \nirunates, ask the court that the release should be considered on an individual basis, Taking into \naccount the needs of the individual and the community, as well as,  at a pace that can assure the \nsafety and welfare of all involved. \n4.  Petitioners Have Failed to Exhaust Their Administrative Remedies Under M.G. L. \nc. Prior to Seeking Relief from the Court Pursuant to M. G. L. c.211, § 3 \nIn order to preserve their rights, Respondents raise the issue that Petitioners failed to \nexhaust their administrative remedies under M.G.L. c.127, § 38F.  The 1996 Prison Litigation \nReform Act (PLRA) requires prisoners to exhaust the prison's grievance procedures before filing \na lawsuit a federal claim. Civil Rights oflnstitutionalized Persons Act, § 7(a), as amended, 42 \nU.S.C. § 1997e(a).  In 1999, the Massachusetts Legislature enacted similar requirements for state \nclaims.  G.L. c. 127 §38F.  It is settled Jaw that a prisoner's failure to exhaust available \nadministrative remedies bars that prisoner from challenging the action judicially.  Jones v. Bock, \n549 U.S. 199, 211  (2007); Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81,92 (2006); Ryan v. Pepe, 65 Mass. \nApp. Ct. 833, 839 (2006); Stokes v. Commissioner ofC  orrection, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 585, 590 \n15 \n\n(1988).Failure of an inmate to exhaust his administrative remedies curtails courts' authority to \nadjudicate the imnate's claims.  Ryan, 65 Mass. App. Ct at 834. \nIn Woodford, the United States Supreme Court ruled that \"proper exhaustion\" is required, \nmeaning that the prisoner is required to complete all steps that the administrative agency \nprovides as part of its review process.  548 U.S. at 90.  \"Proper exhaustion\" requires the prisoner \nto comply with all deadlines and procedural rules.  Id. at 90; Andrade v. Maloney, 2006 WL \n2381429 (D. Mass. 2006) (prisoner's failure to comply with procedural requirements was ground \nfor summary judgment). In the present case, there has been no evidence submitted by Petitioners \nthat imnates have completed any of the steps of the process the county correctional facilities \nprovide them to in order to review any grievances. \nD.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, Respondents, the Sheriffs of the fourteen counties in the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, respectfully request that this Court DENY the Petitioners' \nPetition to the extent Petitioners seek the blanket release of pre-trial and convicted imnates from \ncounty correctional facilities. \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED BY \nRESPONDENTS, THE SHERIFFS OF \nTHE FOURTEEN COUNTIES OF \nTHE COMMONWEALTH OF \nMASSACHUSETTS, \nBy their Attorney \nMaura Healy \nAttorney \nDate: March 27, 2020  By: \nDan V.

Chief Justice of the Trial Court, No. SJC-12926 \nDear Clerk Kenneally,\nFor the last 25 years, Citizens for Juvenile Justice has been the only \nindependent, nonprofit, statewide organization working exclusively to improve \nthe juvenile justice system in Massachusetts. Our mission is to advocate for \nstatewide systemic reform that achieves equitable youth justice. In light of this \nmission, we write to urge this Court to act in the best interests of public health \nand safety and grant Petitioners’ request to safely release as many people as \npossible from confinement. However, we also urge the Court to ensure that young \npeople under the age of 18 who are currently incarcerated in the juvenile justice \nsystem are included in any relief granted pursuant to this petition. The petition as \ndrafted is not clear whether or not young people under the jurisdiction of the \njuvenile court are included and the Department of Youth Services, who holds \njuveniles who are in custody is not an involved party. \nWe absolutely agree with the Petitioners that we are in the midst of \n\n“extraordinary circumstances” that warrant extraordinary relief to ensure the \nhealth and safety of residents of the Commonwealth during this current \npandemic. However, it is imperative not forget that young people are also \nseriously at risk due to the spread of COVID-19 in incarcerated settings. \nThe lower morbidity and mortality of young people due to Covid-19 \ninfection is often cited. However, doesn’t mean they are not physically at risk.  \nAmong youth under age 20 in the general population with a confirmed diagnosis, \n2%-3% resulted in hospitalizations1.  Additionally, high rates of mental health \nneeds for youth in juvenile justice system puts them at higher risk of increased \nstress and anxiety, especially when separated from their families during a time of \ncrisis like this.\nThis need for decarceration in juvenile justice is also grounded in the \nnational call for youth to be released from juvenile justice confinement as a \nmeans of controlling the spread of Covid-19. Youth Correctional Leaders for \nJustice, a national organization of current and former youth correctional \nadministrators, state that “while most young people are at lower risk from the \nvirus, youth in the justice system are less healthy than their peers. They have \nmore gaps in Medicaid enrollment and higher rates of asthma, which increases \n1 Centers for Disease Control, Severe Outcomes Among Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) \n— United States, February 12–March 16, 2020.  \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm\n\nthe severity of COVID-19. Locking youth up exacerbates mental illness, \ndramatically increases the risk of self-harm and is associated with risks lasting \ninto adulthood, including poorer overall general health and increased incidence \nof suicide.”2 \nThe public health community has stressed the importance of limiting the \nnumber of young people taken into custody and of weighing the threat of \nCOVID-19 when assessing the need for pretrial detention. Physicians for Criminal \nJustice Reform state that “Further detention and incarceration of any minors who \ncan remain safely at home with families and/or caretakers is inconsistent with \nthe rehabilitative goals of the juvenile justice system and contrary to public \nhealth recommendations.”3\nThe Department of Youth Services, as of March 25, 2020 has 112 young \npeople in detention due to the inability of their families to post bail and an \nadditional 221 young people who are in either residential or secure facilities. In \nthe interest of equity, the Department of Youth Services should be added as an \ninvolved party in this action and any relief granted under this petition should \nextend to the young people held in their custody. To extend relief to adults and \n2 Youth Correctional Leaders for Justice Steering Committee COVID-19 Press Release – March 19. 2020. \nhttps://yclj.org/covid19statement\n3 Physicians for Criminal Justice Reform, Letter to State Governors, State and Local Juvenile Detention \nand Correctional Departments, and Juvenile Court Judges and Magistrates – March 22, 2020. \nhttps://njdc.info/wp-content/uploads/PFCJR-Statement.pdf\n\nnot to children who bear similar health risks due to the current pandemic is not \nin the interest of justice. Furthermore, the unique structure of the juvenile justice \nsystem allows youth released to have access to more services and supports upon \nreentry into the community than many discharging from Massachusetts prisons \nand jails would receive. \nTherefore, we urge that the court grant Petitioners’ request to safely \nrelease as many individuals as possible from confinement, and to extend this \nruling to youth in the juvenile justice system.\nSincerely,\nLeon Smith, Esq.\nBBO#649856\nExecutive Director\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\n44 School Street, Suite 400\nBoston, MA 02108\n(617) 817-1488\n \n\nAmicus curiae Citizens for Juvenile Justice declares that (a) no party or party’s counsel \nauthored the brief in whole or in part, (b) no party or party’s counsel contributed money \nthat was intended to fund preparing or submitting the brief; (c) no person or \nentity—other than the amicus, its members, or its counsel—contributed money that was \nintended to fund preparing or submitting the brief; and (d) neither amicus nor its \ncounsel represents or has represented any of the parties to the present petition in \nanother proceeding involving similar issues, or was a party or represented a party in a \nproceeding or legal transaction that is at issue in the present petition.\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \nOn March 27, 2020, I served a copy of this brief on all parties by e-file. \n/s/ James Leon Smith, Jr \nBBO #649856 \nJames Leon Smith, Jr.\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\n44 School Street, Suite 400\nBoston, MA 02108\n(617) 338-1050",

SJC-12926 \nCOMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC COUNSEL SERVICES & \nMASSACHUSETTS ASSOCIATION OF CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAW  YERS, \nPetitioners \nV. \nCHIEF JUSTICE OF THE TRIAL COURT, \nRespondent \nSUPPLEMENTAL OPPOSITION TO THE PETITIONERS' G.L. c. 211, §3 PETITION \nBY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS FOR THE BRISTOL, CAPE & ISLANDS, ESSEX, \nHAMPDEN, MIDDLE, NORFOLK, & PLYMOUTH DISTRICTS \nOn March 27,  2020,  the District Attorneys for  the Bristol,  Cape and Islands, Essex, \nHampden,  Middle,  Norfolk,  and  Plymouth  Districts  [seven  district  attorneys],  filed  an \nOPPOSITION TO THE PETITIONERS' G.L. c. 211, §3 PETITION BY THE DISTRICT \nATTORNEYS FOR THE BRISTOL, CAPE & ISLANDS, ESSEX, HAMPDEN, MIDDLE, \nNORFOLK,  &  PLYMOUTH  DISTRICTS  [opposition  memorandum].  Additional  legal \nauthority to support its opposition memorandum, Argument Cat 12-19, is found below: \nArgument \nOn March 10, 2020, the governor declared a State of Emergency in the Commonwealth \nof Massachusetts to respond to COVID-19. Executive Order No. 591.  In so doing, the governor \ninvoked the powers provided to him by Chapter 639 of the Acts of 1950 and G.L. c. 17, §2A. \nExecutive Order No. 591, paragraph 13. In 1950, in an act \"relative to pandemic and disaster \npreparation and response in the Commonwealth\", session bill S2028, the legislature addressed \nthe conditions, procedures and governmental powers that exist when a disaster impacts the \n1 \n\nhealth, security and safety of the public during a declared state of emergency.  More commonly \nknown as the Civil Defense Act, the Legislature explicitly grants additional powers to the \ngovernor regarding the health and safety of all inmates in the Commonwealth.  Acts of 1950, \nChapter 639, section 7. \nSpecifically, Section 7 of the Civil Defense Act states, \nDuring the effective period of so much of this act as is contingent upon the declaration of \na state of emergency ... , the governor, in addition to any other authority vested in him \nby law, shall have and may exercise any and all authority over persons and property \nnecessary or expedient for meeting said state of emergency, which the general court in \nthe exercise of its constitutional authority may confer upon him as  supreme executive \nmagistrate of the commonwealth and commander-in-chief of the military forces, there of . \n. . . , the Governor shall have and may exercise such authority relative to any or all of the \nfollowing: - -- a.  Health or Safety of inmates of all institutions.  (emphasis added). \no'\\ \nIn his declaration of a state of emergency on March 1  the Governor invoked the powers of \nSection 7 and declared that he would \"from time to time issue recommendations, directives, and \norders as circumstances may require.\"  Executive Order No. 591, paragraph 13. 1 \nWithout any statutory or constitutional support, and in contravention to the Civil Defense \nAct, the petitioners claim that this Court, under its G.L. c.  211, §3  emergency powers, is the \nappropriate governmental body with which incarcerated persons, detained either pretrial or post \nconviction, may address collectively, by designated category, their conditions of incarceration \n1 Pursuant to G.L. c. 17, §2A, inserted by St.1965, c. 473, the governor's emergency \norder also invoked the powers provided by legislature to the Commissioner of the Department of \nPublic Health.  Executive Order No. 591, paragraph 13.  G.L. c. 17, §2A provides: \nUpon declaration by the governor that an emergency exists which is detrimental \nto the public health, the commissioner may, with the approval of the governor and the \npublic health council, during such period of emergency, take such action and incur such \nliabilities as he may deem necessary to assure the maintenance of public health and the \nprevention of disease. \nThe commissioner, with the approval of the public health council, may establish \nprocedures to be followed during such emergency to insure the continuation of essential \npublic health services and the enforcement of the same. \n2 \n\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic. It is not. The legislature explicitly vested such authority in the \nexecutive, not judicial, governmental branch. The petitioners' claims rest solely on the issue of \nwhether, and in some cases where, they should be detained during the COVID-19 pandemic, not \nwhether there is  an illegality in the imposition of their individual detention orders.  Contrast \nDiatchenko v. District Atty. For the Suffolk Dist., 466 Mass. 655, 673 (2013), S.C. 471 Mass. 12 \n(2015)(incarcerated defendant claimed error in imposition of life without parole sentence for \nfirst-degree  murder due to his  status as  a juvenile when it was  imposed);  Commonwealth v. \nPerez, 477 Mass. 677, 688 (2017), S.C. 480 Mass. 562 (2018)(incarcerated defendant claimed \nerror  in  the  imposition  of aggregate  state  prison  sentences  for  non-homicide  offenses  that \nexceeded  Diatchenko  limits);  Commonwealth  v.  Latraprasad,  475  Mass.  692,  701  (2016) \n(d eparture from imposition of minimum mandatory sentences was not valid until the sentencing \nguidelines  recommended by the  sentencing commission are enacted by the Legislature). The \nLegislature, who  has  the  statutory and constitutional powers  to  decide issues relative to  the \nexecution of detention orders outside a state of emergency, has  transferred that power to the \nexecutive branch when the citizens of this Commonwealth are in a declared state of emergency. \nThe  petitoners'  requested  relief from  this  Court  violates  the  separation  of powers. \nMassachusetts Declaration of Rights art. 30.  The petition must be dismissed. \nConclusion \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  and  those  stated  m  its  previously  filed  opposition \nmemorandum, the seven district attorneys will continue to represent the Commonwealth at any \nindividualized  hearing  of an  aggrieved  incarcerated  person  or  probationer  pursuant  to  the \nestablished Rules of Criminal and Appellate Procedure during this COVID-19 pandemic, but \nrespectfully suggest the petition must be dismissed. \n3 \n\nRespectfully submitted, \nTHOMAS M.

Kenneally, Clerk \nSupreme Judicial Court \nJohn Adams Courthouse \n1 Pemberton Square, Suite 2500 \nBoston, MA 02108 \n \nRE:  Post-Argument Letter in No. SJC-12926 RE: April 1, 2020 Order \n \nDear Mr. Kenneally, \n \nThis letter is in response to the Order entered on April 1, 2020, directing the Department of \nCorrection to submit to the Court a post-argument letter answering the following questions, \nbased on informed estimates: \n \n1.  Approximately what percentage of inmates or detainees sleep within six feet of another \ninmate or detainee?  Individuals in disciplinary isolation should be excluded from this \nestimate. \n \n  The Department of Correction has 11,639 beds.  Of this number, 3,226 beds (27.72%) are \nin single cells, 5,792 beds (49.76%) are in double cells, and 2,621 beds (22.52%) are in \ndormitory rooms, which vary in size and occupancy from between 3 to 114 inmates.  While \nmany bunks in these dormitory rooms are fixed to the floor, other non-fixed bunks are kept as far \napart as possible dependent on available space.  Based on these numbers, approximately 72% of \nDepartment inmates or detainees (collectively referred to as “inmates”) either sleep within six \nfeet of another inmate (in a double room) or more than one other inmate (in a dormitory room). \n \n2.  Approximately what percentage of inmates or detainees eat meals within six feet of \nanother inmate or detainee? \n \n \n\n \n  At present, inmates at MCI-Shirley (Medium), the Souza-Baranowski Correctional \nCenter and the Massachusetts Treatment Center are eating inside their housing units.  Inmates \nhave been informed about social distancing and are regularly reminded to do so. The most \ninformed estimate is that approximately 70% of inmates eating within their housing units are \neating within six feet from another. \n \nWith respect to facilities where inmates eat in a dining hall, inmates have been informed \nabout social distancing, and are regularly reminded to do so,.  The most informed estimate is that \napproximately 70% of inmates or detainees eating in a dining hall eat their meals within six feet \nfrom another inmate or detainee. \n \n3.  Approximately what percentage of inmates or detainees are permitted to be within six \nfeet of each other during recreation periods? \n \n  Because of the limitations on space inherent in a correctional setting, The Department \nacknowledges that inmates are generally able to pass within six feet of one another during \nrecreational periods. \n  \n  As is relevant, the Executive Order declared by Governor Charles D. Baker on March 23, \n2020, declared that production and service sectors identified in its Exhibit A are designated as \n“COVID-19 Essential Services.”  See COVID-19 ORDER No. 13 (March 23, 2020)(“Order”), \nattached, at p.2, ¶1. The list of Essential Services accompanying this Executive Order includes \n“personnel in…corrections” under the “Law Enforcement” heading. See COVID-19:  Essential \nServices, attached, at p.10.  While the Order prohibits gatherings of more than ten people, it \nfurther states that “this limitation shall not apply to the operations or activities of any business or \norganization in its provision or delivery of COVID-19 Essential Services.” Order at p. 3, ¶3.  As \ncorrections are an Essential Service, the ten-person limit contained in the Executive Order would \nnot apply to Department operations as it provides essential services, including housing, feeding, \nand recreation of inmates in its custody.  Moreover, the Order “does not prohibit gatherings of \nmore than 10 people in an unenclosed, outdoor space such as a park, athletic field, or parking \nlot”, Order at p. 3, ¶3, so this Order would not prohibit gatherings of more than 10 inmates in a \nDepartment recreation yard.  \n \n \n              Very truly yours, \n \n              /s/ Charles W. Anderson Jr.   \n              Charles W.

On Saturday, March 21, \n2020, the Massachusetts Department of Correction confirmed the first case of \nCOVID-19 in the state prison system: a man held at the Massachusetts Treatment \nCenter (MTC), a medium-security prison at the Bridgewater Correctional \nComplex.2 He and his cellmate have both been separately quarantined since \n \n1 The signatories to this letter are: Dr. Mary T.

This first man to be diagnosed is serving a life \nsentence. As must be obvious, he did not contract COVID-19 from international \ntravel or by intentionally flouting social distancing. The virus was introduced into \nthe prison. On Sunday evening, the Associated Press reported that three people \nincarcerated at the MTC now have confirmed cases of COVID-19 and are \nquarantined, in addition to one correctional officer.3 By Monday night, DOC \nannounced that six people incarcerated at MTC now have confirmed cases.4 The \nvirus is spreading, and many others are at risk. \nThe continued detention of thousands of people whose release would reduce \nthe risk of community spread during this pandemic poses a grave threat to the lives \nand health of countless people. The greater the density of people in a confined \n \nLive News (Mar. 21, 2020), \nhttps://www.masslive.com/coronavirus/2020/03/coronavirus-and-prisons-inmate-\nserving-life-sentence-tests-positive-for-covid-19-at-massachusetts-treatment-\ncenter-in-bridgewater.html; Inmate at Bridgewater prison tests positive for \ncoronavirus, officials say, WCVB (Mar. 21, 2020), \nhttps://www.wcvb.com/article/inmate-at-bridgewater-prison-massachusetts-\ntreatment-center-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-officials-say/31846456#. \n \n3 3 inmates, 1 officer at Mass. prison test positive for coronavirus, WHDH (Mar. \n22, 2020), https://whdh.com/news/3-inmates-1-officer-at-mass-prison-test-\npositive-for-coronavirus. \n \n4 Five more coronavirus cases at Massachusetts prison days after inmate tests \npositive, WHDH (Mar. 23, 2020), https://www.wcvb.com/article/coronavirus-\ncases-up-to-6-at-bridgewater-massachusetts-prison-days-after-inmate-tests-\npositive/31906056. \n  2 \n\n \nspace, the greater the likelihood that the virus will spread. Uncontrolled spread in \ncorrectional settings directly threatens the lives and health of people behind bars; \nthat alone should prompt urgent action. But such a situation could also have dire \nimplications for the health and safety of the general public. First, an outbreak \nwithin facilities housing large numbers of at-risk individuals cannot be fully \nmanaged internally, inevitably sapping the resources and capacity of nearby \nhealthcare facilities and staff. Second, the vast majority of detained individuals will \nshortly return to the community anyway,5 where without coordinated efforts they \nmay struggle to find housing and other resources that could support social \ndistancing. Finally, the daily churn of correctional staff and contractors in these \nfacilities puts these employees, their families, and the community at elevated risk. \nThe safest response is to release as many people as practicable to self-isolate, \nespecially those who are vulnerable due to health or age, and reduce the flow of \nnew people into correctional settings. This would protect those who are released, \nthe general public, and those who remain incarcerated or who must staff the \nfacilities. \n \n5 In Massachusetts, 88% of people sentenced to incarceration are detained in a \nhouse of correction, where the median sentence is 5 months.

Sentencing \nComm’n, Survey of Sentencing Practices FY 2013 iii (2014), \nhttps://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2016/08/oo/fy2013-survey-sentencing-\npractices.pdf#page=7. \n  3 \n\n \nClose contact and conditions of incarceration are unsafe in light of the global \nCOVID-19 pandemic.6 These conditions pose a substantial risk of serious illness \nand death to people behind bars. As Dr. Ross McDonald, Chief Medical Officer at \nRikers Island in New York City, recently explained, “We cannot socially distance \ndozens of elderly [people] living in a dorm, sharing a bathroom.”7 Every day that \npeople remain incarcerated in unhygienic prison environments in which social \ndistancing is functionally impossible, they are placed at greater risk. One case of \nCOVID-19 can infect hundreds of others.8 The surest way to contain the spread of \nan infectious disease in a jail or prison is to reduce its population.9 \n \n6 See World Health Org., Director-General Opening Remarks (Mar. 11, 2020), \nhttps://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-\nat-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020. \n \n7 Andrew Naughtie, Coronavirus: US Doctors Demand Immediate Release of \nPrisoners and Detainees to Avert Disaster, Independent (Mar. 9, 2020), \nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-us-prison-\nrelease-doctors-medical-workers-symptoms-a9410501.html.

Confinement itself creates risk of rapidly spreading contagions. \n \nCompared to the general public, those who are incarcerated are even more \nvulnerable to catching COVID-19 and to becoming seriously ill or dying from it.50 \nInfection control in jails and prisons is nearly impossible.51 The CDC has found \n \n48 See Martin Kaste, Prisons and Jails Worry About Becoming Coronavirus \n“Incubators,” NPR (Mar. 13, 2020), \nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/03/13/815002735/prisons-and-jails-worry-about-\nbecoming-coronavirus-incubators. \n \n49 See, e.g., Jennifer Gonnerman, A Rikers Island Doctor Speaks Out to Save Her \nElderly Patients from the Coronavirus, New Yorker (Mar. 20, 2020), \nhttps://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-rikers-island-doctor-speaks-out-to-\nsave-her-elderly-patients-from-the-coronavirus (“Whenever you transport a guy in \ncustody to the hospital, he goes with not just E.M.S. but with officers at his side \nwho are theoretically supposed to be cuffing him to transport him.

This underscores the \nparticular danger of rapid spread in a corrections environment, where unknowingly \ninfected people repeatedly encounter a limited pool of others in close confines. \n2.  Overcrowding compounds the general risks from confinement. \n \nOvercrowding in the Commonwealth’s prisons and jails also exacerbates \nrisk. More than a dozen prisons and jails in the Commonwealth exceed 100% \n \nLegal News (Aug. 15, 2007), \nhttps://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2007/aug/15/prisons-as-incubators-and-\nspreaders-of-disease-and-illness. \n \n52 Kenji Mizumoto & Gerardo Chowell, Estimating risk for death from 2019 novel \ncoronavirus disease, China, January–February 2020, 26 Emerging Infectious \nDiseases (2020), https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0233_article. \n \n53 World Health Org., Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus \nDisease 2019 (COVID-19) at 8 (Feb. 2020), https://www.who.int/docs/default-\nsource/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf. \n  16 \n\n \ncapacity.54 When correctional facilities are beyond capacity, people are squeezed \ninto even closer confinement: they sleep closer together, eat closer together, wash \ncloser together, congregate closer together. If COVID-19 is introduced to these \novercrowded facilities, substantial spread will be nearly impossible to stave off. \n3.  Harsh, unhygienic environments further heighten risks. \n \nJails and prisons are effectively oversized petri dishes for COVID-19. The \nvirus spreads mainly between people who are less than six feet from one another, \nthrough respiratory droplets produced and propelled when an infected person \ncoughs or sneezes.55 It likely stays airborne for up to three hours.56 For three days, \nit remains alive—and contagious—on plastic, metal, and other hard surfaces.57 As \na result, CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently and thoroughly, \n \n54 Mass.

People in the Commonwealth’s jails and prisons face versions of the \nfollowing conditions—with no ability to choose otherwise or take precautions:  \n•  They live in open-air dorms or very small cells, in close quarters, \nand surrounded almost exclusively by hard surfaces; \n•  They are regularly in communal spaces, such as eating areas, \nbathrooms, and cells or holding areas; \n•  They live in spaces with open toilets, which aerosolize bodily \nfluids, within a few feet of their beds; \n•  They are nearly always in “close contact” with others; \n•  They are frequently in actual physical contact with others, such as \ncorrectional officers, kitchen staff, and medical staff; \n•  They are regularly subject to intimate physical contact, including \nsearches of mouths and body cavities; and \n•  They lack regular, uninhibited access to soap, water, tissues, and \npaper towels. \nTake as an example this description of a man serving a life sentence at North \nCentral Correctional Institute in Gardner, MA, as reported on March 21, 2020: \n \n58 See, e.g., Ctrs. for Disease Control and Prevention, Coronavirus Disease 2019 \n(COVID-19): How To Protect Yourself (last updated Mar. 14, 2020), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/tcn892b. \n  18 \n\n \n[H]e can get one bar of hotel-size soap every other week, and \nhas to buy any additional bars in the canteen for 89 cents. Like \nall prisoners in state and county correctional facilities, he is not \nallowed to have hand sanitizer with 60-percent or more alcohol, \nand receives one roll of toilet paper a week and no paper towels \n. . . . [He] works a cleaning job in the institution, and has not \nseen sanitizing taking place. He reported that as of last week, \nthere were still 200 people in large groups going to the chow \nhall, with many prisoners together in the gym, and certainly \nmost still housed in two-person cells except for new admits, \nwho—even more problematically—live in a dorm-like setting.59 \n \nThese general conditions of confinement make any prison or jail a dangerous place \nfor the spread of infectious disease.60 But for facilities in Massachusetts, \nlongstanding public health defects exacerbate these risks.  \n4.  Correctional facilities in Massachusetts fail to resolve \ndocumented environmental health violations. \n \nCorrectional facilities in Massachusetts are subject to biannual inspection by \nthe Department of Public Health, during which environmental health inspectors \ndocument violations in each facility, including repeat (i.e. unresolved) violations. \nAccording to the most recent inspections from late 2019 and early 2020, only one \n \n59 Jean Trounstine, Massachusetts COVID-19 Decarceration Bill Could Protect Us \nAll, Dig Boston (Mar. 21, 2020), https://digboston.com/massachusetts-covid-19-\ndecarceration-bill-could-protect-us-all. \n \n60 See generally Christine Mitchell, Amber Akemi Piatt & Juan Gudino, Human \nImpact Partners, Liberating Our Health: Ending the Harms of Pretrial Incarceration \nand Money Bail 17–19 (2020), https://humanimpact.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/HIP_HealthNotBailNationalReport_2020.02_reduced.pdf \n(collecting research on the toxicity of jail environments and the rapid spread of \ndisease). \n  19 \n\n \nof the Commonwealth’s 35 correctional facilities had zero repeat environmental \nhealth violations at its most recent inspection; 25 of them (71%) had 50 or more \nrepeat violations; 11 (31%) had more than 190 repeat violations each.61 The DOC \nand county sheriffs routinely fail to meet standards that adequately promote and \nprotect the health and safety of their populations under non-emergency conditions. \nIn a global pandemic, where heightened hygiene and physical distancing are \nrequired, corrections officials must receive every possible assistance to protect \ntheir populations—including substantial decarceration of vulnerable populations. \n5.  Inadequate medical care in correctional facilities threatens lives. \nIncarcerated people lack access to timely, quality medical care.62 On January \n9, 2020, the Massachusetts Office of the State Auditor released a two-year audit of \nDOC medical care, finding failure to comply with authoritative guidance for sick \ncall requests, doctors’ appointments, health insurance coverage, and medications \nduring reentry preparation under normal operations.63 The State Auditor wrote: \n \n61 The 2019 inspection reports are available here: https://www.mass.gov/lists/2019-\ncorrectional-facility-inspection-reports.

Without \ntimely treatment for physical and mental health issues, an \ninmate’s condition could worsen.64 \n \nAbout one-third of people whose records were audited (19 out of 60) were not seen \nwithin a week. At a time of pandemic, these existing deficiencies are only likely to \nworsen as more people become infected and need urgent, intensive care. The State \nAuditor reported that “DOC officials could not provide us with a reason for these \nissues at the time of our audit. However, we did note that controls over the \nadministration of these activities appeared to be deficient.”65 Operating from a \nbaseline of impairment, the DOC will be stretched thinner during this emergency.  \n  Similar limitations plague county jails. An in-depth investigation published \nby WBUR this week found that those who “suffered from dire medical conditions \nin Massachusetts county jails [] were often ignored or mistrusted, with fatal \nconsequences. The sheriffs and for-profit companies increasingly responsible for \n[incarcerated people’s] health care face little oversight, and often have withheld the \n \nJune 30, 2018 (Jan. 9, 2020), https://www.mass.gov/doc/audit-of-the-department-\nof-correction/download. \n \n64 Id. at 11. \n \n65 Id. at 12. \n  21 \n\n \ncircumstances of these deaths from the public — even from [incarcerated people’s] \nfamilies.”66 \nFinally, COVID-19 makes isolation, segregation, and lockdowns all but \nfutile. COVID-19 can survive in the air, so separation will not contain it. Surfaces \ninside cells, in bathrooms, on phones, and in transport will still be touched. Contact \nwith intake officers, kitchen staff, and medical personnel is inevitable. Meanwhile, \nsolitary confinement causes severe, long-term brain damage, and resorting to \nsolitary confinement (or an analogue—restrictive housing, 22- or 23-hour-a-day \nlockdowns) would replace one acute health threat with another.67 \n  C. Failing to act now risks a crisis beyond measure. \n    The storm is no longer coming68—it is here. But this Court can be the port in \nthe storm, promoting public health through decarceration.

      "text": "Supreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth    Full Court:   SJC-12926      Filed: 3/25/2020 5:02 PM\nCOMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS \n \nSUFFOLK, SS.                SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT \n                    No. SJC-12926 \n \n \nCOMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC COUNSEL SERVICES AND MASSACHUSETTS \nASSOCIATION OF CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYERS \n \nv. \n \nCHIEF JUSTICE OF THE TRIAL COURT, ET AL. \n________________________________________________________________________ \n \nCOMMONWEALTH'S RESPONSE TO EMERGENCY PETITION \nFOR RELIEF PURSUANT TO G.L. c. 211, § 3 \n________________________________________________________________________ \n \nNow  comes  the  Office  of  the  Middlesex  District  Attorney  (hereinafter  “the \nCommonwealth”)  and  offers  the  following  response  to  Petitioners’  request  for \nextraordinary relief. We share the concern of Petitioners and agree that extraordinary \ncircumstances  warrant  extraordinary  relief.  Ensuring  the  safety  of  all  Massachusetts \nresidents is the highest priority for our Office. In light of the dangers posed by the spread \nof COVID-19 and the heightened risk for detainees and others held in concentrated \ngroups, our Office is committed to taking appropriate steps to mitigate further infection. \nMoreover, as rates of infection increase, corrections officials and civilian staff are also \nplaced at the same risk.  \nIn addition to the risk of COVID-19 transmission posed by the close-quarters \nhousing of inmates in the custody of the Department of Correction, our Office is also \nsensitive to the Due Process and Eighth Amendment rights of defendants incarcerated \npending trial or other significant court events. The present dilemma is unprecedented in \nboth size and scope, and navigating the many unique issues presented will require the \n 1 \n\ncooperation of all parties in the criminal justice system. Our Office is committed to \nworking with our law enforcement partners and Petitioners to ensure that defendants’ \nrights are secured and their well being safeguarded. \nAccordingly, we are implementing a thorough review of inmates at the House of \nCorrection to identify all nonviolent offenders and medically compromised prisoners who \ncan be released without danger to the community. To execute this policy, we are already \nworking closely with the Sheriff, our law enforcement partners, victims and the defense \nbar. Our Office is also taking proactive steps to both minimize the number of nonviolent \noffenders being held pre-trial pursuant to G.L. c. 276, § 58, and advising our Assistant \nDistrict Attorneys to consider the serious health risks posed by detention to the defendant, \nother incarcerated individuals, and the community in formulating bail arguments and \nbefore moving forward in probation detention and dangerousness hearings. \nAt the same time, our Office is mindful of the public safety concerns engendered \nby the large-scale release of prisoners envisioned by Petitioners, particularly given the \nproposed limitations on otherwise reasonable conditions of release. We have concerns \nabout an approach that prioritizes the unconditional release of certain classes of inmates \nwithout proper oversight and structure; for example, individuals with addictions who are \nat an increased risk of overdosing without adequate supervision or who will be released \nto the streets or a shelter – making themselves and others more prone to exposure and \ninfection. In short, identifying the best course of action to mitigate future risk requires \nnuanced discussion and cooperation of all parties; not a blanket policy that prioritizes \nrelease over proper safeguards. \n 2 \n\nGiven the urgent and extraordinary nature of the COVID-19 epidemic, we believe \nthat the most efficient way for the Court to address this matter is to immediately convene \nan emergency committee comprised of the various stakeholders in the criminal justice \nsystem. This group would include representatives from the various prosecutors’ offices, \nthe Petitioners, the Department of Correction, the various Sheriff’s offices, the Parole \nBoard, the Attorney General and the Trial Court. This working group will act rapidly to \nidentify  policies  that  can  be  immediately  implemented  to  reduce  the  population  of \nincarcerated  defendants.  Areas  of  disagreement  can  also  be  quickly  identified  and \nresolved before the Single Justice.   \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n            For the Commonwealth, \n \n                 \n            MARIAN T.

Hayes, no. 1784CR00464 \nThe  above-named  individuals  represent  a  wide \nrange of ages, medical conditions, stages of appellate \nproceedings,  and  charged  criminal  conduct.  However, \neach  individual  is  either  currently  incarcerated  or \nhas  a  status  such  that  there  is  a  foreseeable  risk \nthey  will  being  taken  into  custody.  Therefore,  this \ncase directly affects each individual. \nArgument \n  Mindful  of  Justice  Budd’s  admonition  that \n“counsel  shall  do  their  best  to  avoid  redundant \narguments”  (Paper  #5  on  SJ-2020-0115),  amici  will \nprimarily  rely  on  the  arguments  set  forth  by  the \nCommittee for Public Counsel Services. \n  Amici  simply  urge  this  Court  to  consider \npractical problems with any remedy that involves case-\nby-case advocacy requiring defense attorneys to alert \nlaw  enforcement  entities  to  the  specific  medical \nconditions of their clients. Under these extraordinary \ncircumstances  it  is  not  practical  to  safely  obtain \nclient signatures for releases of medical records nor \nfor  defense  attorneys  to  obtain  and  review  updated \nrecords.  As  this  Court  has  reminded  its  readers \nrecently,  remedies  for  systemic  issues  must  be  “fair \n3 \n\nand workable.” Bridgeman v. Dist. Attorney for Suffolk \nDist., 476 Mass. 298, 326 (2017). \nAccordingly,  amici  seek  a  remedy  that  directly \nallows  for  law  enforcement  to  efficiently  obtain \nmedical  records  (while  respecting  all  privacy \ninterests).  Such  a  process  will  allow  the  most \nexpeditious and safe evaluation of the medical status \nof  each  criminal  defendant.  Therefore,  all  parties \nwill  be  in  the  best  position  to  assess  who  is \nparticularly  vulnerable  to  the  disease  that  might \njustify his or her release in the interest of public \nhealth.  see  Brown  v.  Plata,  563  U.S.  493,  510–11 \n(2011)  (addressing  duty  and  broad  remedial  powers  of \ncourts  to  ensure  well-being  of  incarcerated \nindividuals). \n          Respectfully submitted, \n          /s/ Max Bauer \nMAX BAUER, ESQ. \n          BBO# 688891 \n          11 Beacon St. \n          Suite 914 \n          Boston, MA 02108 \n          781-629-9527 \n          Attorneymaxbauer@gmail.com \n \n \n \nDATED: March 27, 2020\n4 \n\n \n \nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \n \n \nI,  MAX  BAUER,  ATTORNEY  FOR  THE  ABOVE-NAMED  DEFENDANTS, \nHEREBY STATE THAT I HAVE SERVED A COPY OF THIS BRIEF UPON \nPARTIES THROUGH EFILEMA.COM AS WELL AS EMAILING PDF COPIES \nTO  SPECIAL  MASTER  BRIEN  O’CONNOR  AND  ASSISTANT  CLERK  AMY \nSTEWART. \n \n/s/ Max Bauer \n_______________________ \nMAX BAUER \n \n  5 \n\nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE PURSUANT TO RULE 16(K) OF THE \nMASSACHUSETTS RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE \n \nI, MAX BAUER, HEREBY CERTIFY THAT THE FOREGOING BRIEF \nCOMPLIES WITH Mass.

In just the six days since petitioners \nfiled this case, Massachusetts COVID-19 cases have spiked at least six-fold—from \n777 to 4,955—and surfaced in at least four Massachusetts correctional facilities.3 \nPetitioners do not seek to assign blame for this crisis; we seek to mitigate the harm it \nwill cause incarcerated people, correctional staffs, and the public. But achieving that \ngoal requires acknowledging that the pandemic is too deadly and too rapid to be \nmitigated by the normal staffing, litigation, and disposition of criminal cases. This is a \nrace: against the disease, and for people’s lives. \nThe respondents’ submissions confirm that incarcerated people are especially \nvulnerable to this threat, and therefore deserve special protections. No one disputes \n                                         \n1 Yesterday, 18,093 people in the United States were confirmed new cases for \nCOVID-19 and 425 people died. See Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) \nSituation Report - 69, World Health Organization (March 29, 2020), available at: \nhttps://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200329-\nsitrep-69-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=8d6620fa_4. \n2 Donald G. McNeil Jr., The U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus \nCases, N.Y. Times (March 26, 2020). \n3 This includes the Plymouth and Middlesex County Houses of Correction, the \nMassachusetts Treatment Center, and MCI Shirley. See Deborah Becker, 19 People \nin Mass. Prisons and Jails Diagnosed with COVID-19, WBUR (updated Mar. 29, \n2020), https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/03/23/coronavirus-massachusetts-\nprisoner. Norfolk County also has a confirmed case in its Sheriff’s office. See id. \n6 \n \n\nthat COVID-19 spreads exponentially and “easily, including from asymptomatic \nindividuals.” Tsai Aff. ¶4. No one denies that this presents “a particular threat to \nindividuals confined in close quarters such as incarcerated people.” Id. Yet, even \nassuming every claim in respondents’ submissions is accurate—which petitioners do \nnot—the most telling claims are those they do not make. They do not claim that their \nMassachusetts prisoners can engage in the physical distancing—e.g., keeping six feet \napart or avoiding groups of ten—that has been deemed essential to the safety of all \nhuman beings in Massachusetts. They do not reveal how many Massachusetts \nprisoners have been tested for COVID-19, how many of those tested positive, or \nwhether there is even a capacity to test them in substantial numbers. And none of \nthe respondents claim that Massachusetts has the staff, the ventilators, or the \npersonal protective equipment (PPE) necessary to prevent a correctional outbreak \nfrom turning disproportionately deadly. \nNine parties—the Attorney General, the Trial Court, the Department of \nCorrection, the Parole Board, the Probation Service, and four district attorneys—now \nagree with petitioners that this Court should play a role in solving this crisis. But the \nsheriffs and remaining district attorneys refuse to concede that a deadly pandemic is \nitself a reason to release people confined to spaces where each person is a potentially \ndeadly threat to his or her neighbor. This blinks reality. \n7 \n \n\nAs explained below, petitioners are not only willing but eager to implement a \nsolution that allows for both consideration of individual circumstances and rapid \nreleases from custody. But what we are not willing to do is agree that, during a \npandemic, the normal turning of the wheels of justice should be allowed to become \na machine that takes in human beings and spits out dead bodies. Petitioners \nrespectfully request that this Court exercise its superintendence authority to facilitate \nimmediate reductions in pretrial and post-conviction custody.  \nDISCUSSION \n \nI.   The situation is dire, urgent, and requires reducing levels of \nincarceration in Massachusetts.  \n \nThe petition demonstrates that, especially because COVID-19 can be spread \nby asymptomatic people, it poses enormous risks to everyone inside, and thus \neveryone outside, Massachusetts correctional facilities. The respondents’ \nsubmissions indicate that, if anything, the situation is worse than we thought. \nA.  Prisoners are not safe, and therefore we are all less safe.  \n  The COVID-19 pandemic has now reached at least four Massachusetts \ncorrectional facilities,4 but its true spread is unknown. No one on behalf of the \nrespondents has said how many prisoners have been tested or whether they have \nenough tests to track the spread of this disease inside their facilities.  \n                                         \n4 See supra n. 3.   \n8 \n \n\n  Nor have the respondents provided assurances that prisoners can undertake \nthe physical distancing and quarantining that is necessary to keep them safe. To their \ncredit, many respondents are taking steps to limit physical interactions in their \nfacilities, to enhance access to hygienic products, and to screen for symptoms of \nCOVID-19.5 But because COVID-19 is easily spread by people who are \nasymptomatic, Tsai Aff. ¶4, it is unclear why the respondents believe these measures \nprovide something beyond a false sense of security. \n  For precisely this reason, every resident of the Commonwealth has been \ninstructed that, to limit the spread of COVID-19, they must not only engage in good \nhygiene but also stay six feet away from other people and avoid groups of more than \n10 people.6 Yet none of the respondents—none—claim that this is happening for \nprisoners in their custody. Only the Sheriff for Barnstable County has claimed to \n                                         \n5 See, e.g., Cahillane Aff. ¶¶5, 15; Cocchi Aff. ¶5.t; Hodgson ¶6.d; McDermott Aff.; \nTuttle Aff. ¶9. \n6 See, e.g., Governor Charlie Baker Orders All Non-Essential Businesses To Cease \nIn Person Operation, Directs the Department of Public Health to Issue Stay at \nHome Advisory For Two Weeks, Updates Assembly Order to Limit Gatherings to \n10 People (March 23, 2020) (“The Baker-Polito Administration Order also limits \ngatherings to 10 people during the state of emergency, a reduction from the 25 \nperson limit established in an earlier order”), https://www.mass.gov/news/governor-\ncharlie-baker-orders-all-non-essential-businesses-to-cease-in-person-operation; DPH \nPublic Health Advisory: Stay-at-Home Advisory for Individuals over 70 and for \nThose with Underlying Health Conditions; and Safe Practices for the General Public \n(March 24, 2020) (“Individuals in the Commonwealth should always practice social \ndistancing, this means keeping a distance of 6 feet between you and the other \nperson”), https://www.mass.gov/news/dph-public-health-advisory-stay-at-home-\nadvisory-for-individuals-over-70-and-for-those-with.  \n9 \n \n\nhave eliminated bunk sleeping arrangements. Cummings Aff. ¶9(a). Some \nrespondents have reported “efforts to limit large gatherings,” Vidal Aff. ¶8, but none \nhave reported that prisoners in their custody are exposed to only nine other people.  \n  In fact, prisoners are reporting very dangerous conditions. They still eat and \nbunk in very close proximity, Belger Aff. ¶¶8-12, and without the necessary supplies \nto protect themselves. Belger Aff. ¶¶6, 7, 10, 13. Similar conditions are found in the \njails. Rosen Aff., Dubois Aff.  \nAnd some measures that respondents are reportedly taking to curtail the \ndisease seem likely, instead, to spread it. For example, it appears that some \nrespondents are putting newly admitted or ill prisoners together, without PPE, in \n“new man” or “quarantine units”—which seems likely to spread it to other prisoners \nand to the staff who must interact with them. See, e.g., Cahillane Aff. ¶16; Coppinger \nAff. ¶5(e). Likewise, Bristol Sheriff Thomas Hodgson reports that people in his \ncustody who have chronic illnesses are “specially monitored.” Hodgson Aff. ¶6.i. \nWhat at-risk people need, however, is not interaction with monitors who might \ninfect them, but instead more space. \nNor do respondents claim the capacity to treat substantial numbers of infected \nprisoners. To the contrary, Commissioner of Correction Carol Mici instructed \ncorrections staff members: “Please do not ask the DOC medical provider for masks \nas they are in short supply.” Mici Aff. at Ex. 7-1 (emphasis added); see also \n10 \n \n\nCummings Aff. Ex. B (acknowledging a limited supply of PPE). And although an \nestimated 15-20% of people who contract COVID-19 will require hospitalization \nand an estimated 5% will require intensive care, Giftos Aff. ¶ 8,7 respondents do not \ndiscuss the availability of ventilators at a single jail or prison.   \nCorrectional health care is not capable of duplicating hospital care, let alone \nin an intensive care unit (ICU). Giftos Aff ¶ 6. While each DOC facility has a health \nservices unit that can provide care comparable to an urgent care facility, only one \nmen’s infirmary with a maximum of 36 beds provides more acute care, and even this \nis not equivalent to an ICU. Lewis Aff. ¶¶ 6, 9, 12. According to Dr. Victor Lewis, \nwho for more than twenty years has monitored the medical and mental health care \nDOC provides to prisoners in segregation, “it will not take much to overwhelm \nDOC’s health care system once the COVID-19 pandemic spreads.” Lewis Aff. ¶15. \nNotably, “the problem of a prison outbreak of COVID-19 infections cannot \nand will not be contained within the institution itself. Instead, it will explode into the \ncommunity, increasing the pressure on our already taxed community hospitals.” \nGiftos Aff. ¶ 9. Anyone requiring hospitalization or ICU care while incarcerated \nmust be transferred to a hospital. Lewis Aff. ¶12; Giftos Aff ¶¶6, 9; see also Mici Aff. \n¶ 58 (noting that at least two out of the first 10 state prisoners to be diagnosed with \n                                         \n7 See also Caring for COVID-19 Patients: Can Hospitals Around the Nation Keep \nUp?, Harvard Global Health Institute (March 17, 2020), \nhttps://globalepidemics.org/2020/03/17/caring-for-covid-19-patients/.  \n11 \n \n\nCOVID-19 have had to be hospitalized). But as Dr. Sivashanker, Medical Director \nfor Quality, Safety and Equity at Brigham Health explains, even prior to the current \npandemic, hospitals in the Greater Boston area frequently operated at or above \n100% ICU capacity. Sivashanker Aff. ¶ 4. These hospitals are now bracing for \nCOVID-19 needs that threaten to outstrip available ventilators and ICU beds. \nSivashanker Aff. ¶¶6 - 8. Indeed, according to the Harvard Global Health Institute \nStudy, the need for ICU beds in Massachusetts will far exceed their availability even \nin the researchers’ best case scenario—if the rate of infection only reaches 20% of the \npopulation over the course of 18 months.8 Facing similar numbers, other states have \nalready started to plan for the rationing of care.9 \n“Based on projected viral spread rates,” Massachusetts doctors may already \n“end up in a situation where [they] will have to start making decisions about who \nreceives a life-saving resources (e.g., a ventilator) and who does not.” Sivashanker \nAff. ¶6. “An outbreak of COVID-19 at a jail or prison, which would likely require \nnumerous transfers to a community hospital, could push a hospital even further past \nits breaking point.” Giftos Aff. ¶10; see also Sivashanker Aff. ¶7. In these \n                                         \n8 See Caring for COVID-19 Patients: Can Hospitals Around the Nation Keep Up?, \nHarvard Global Health Institute (March 17, 2020), available at: \nhttps://globalepidemics.org/2020/03/17/caring-for-covid-19-patients/. \n9 Karen Weise & Mike Baker, “Chilling” Plans: Who Gets Care as Washington \nState Hospitals Fill Up?, The New York Times (March 20, 2020). \n12 \n \n\ncircumstances, even more people will not receive the life-saving care that they need. \nSivashanker Aff. ¶¶ 5, 7, 9.\n \n  The crisis that now exists inside the Commonwealth’s correctional facilities \ncannot be solved inside those facilities. So long as substantial numbers of people are \nincarcerated in Massachusetts, it will not be possible to curb the spread of COVID-\n19 or prevent the overwhelming of the entire health care system’s capacity. \nB.  Time is of the essence. \n \nPetitioners have shown that, particularly now that in-person meetings and \nhearings are unsafe, the crisis inside the Commonwealth’s correctional facilities also \ncannot be resolved by existing approaches to criminal procedure. The Trial Court’s \nsubmissions have demonstrated that they are doing what they can, within the \nconfines of existing rules, to hear motions on an emergency basis by incarcerated \npeople who believe they are at risk of catching and dying from COVID-19. See Trial \nCourt Br. 6. And, after the filing of this lawsuit, District Court Chief Justice Dawley \ninstructed district court judges to “consider the impact of the COVID-19 virus” \nwhen setting bail or deciding whether to hold someone for dangerousness under G. \nL. c. 276, § 58A. \nBut those measures will not bring down the numbers of incarcerated people \nin time to ward off disaster. The Superior Court’s report on motions for release due \nto COVID-19 reveals that many of those motions have been denied or remain \n13 \n \n\npending. C.J. Fabricant Aff. at Attachment 2. Likewise, two Chief Justices report a \nhesitance to dictate an “overall standard” for resolving motions by incarcerated \npeople. Id. ¶16; C.J. Nechtem Aff. ¶14. And at least one Superior Court judge has \nconcluded that the existing rules of criminal procedure—which this Court has the \npower to amend—can operate to bar trial judges from releasing people whose lives \nmay be in danger due to COVID-19.10 In normal times, such thoughtful and \nindividualized deliberation, subject to existing rules of criminal procedure, would be \nlaudable. But these are not normal times. \nAttorneys are reporting serious difficulties in obtaining relief through \nindividual motions. One attorney stated that his motion to rescind his client’s bail \nrevocation was denied in the Quincy District Court by a judge who stated that he was \nwithout authority to allow the motion. Kiley Aff. ¶6. Three different judges of the \nChelsea District Court have denied agreed-upon motions for release for pretrial \ndetainees. Kiley Aff. ¶7. And judges in at least four superior courts (Salem, \nWorcester, Hampden, and Norfolk) and one district court (New Bedford) have \nindicated that they will not regard COVID-19 as a factor weighing in favor of release \n                                         \n10 See Order on Defendant’s Emergency Motion to Order Defendant’s Release Due \nto COVID-19 Crisis, Commonwealth v. Tompkins, No. 0878CR00039 (Superior \nCourt Mar. 25, 2020) (Agostini, J.) (noting the “legitimate concern for the health and \nsafety of individuals incarcerated in the various prisoners and jails,” but concluding \nthat the court could not grant relief). \n14 \n \n\nuntil there is an actual diagnosis of COVID-19 at the facility in question. Kiley Aff. \n¶11. We cannot continue in this fashion. \nThis crisis demands an overall standard, one that can quickly and consistently \ntip the scales of justice in favor of safely reducing incarceration levels. It will not be \nenough for courts to “consider” whether people should be locked up pretrial \nbecause they cannot afford bail during a pandemic and economic crash; this simply \nmust not happen. Likewise, the judiciary cannot meaningfully curb the spread of \nCOVID-19 among incarcerated people through an approach that varies from case to \ncase or judge to judge; curbing a pandemic for some people or in some places is the \nsame as not curbing it at all. As is implicit in the Trial Court’s submissions, there is \nonly one entity that can and should set a statewide approach: this Court. \nC.   Respondents have not rebutted petitioners’ showing that incarceration \nmust be reduced to protect prisoners, corrections staff, and the \ncommunity. \n \nTo their credit, many of the respondents appear to agree “this Court should \nexplore steps to reduce th[e] population” of incarcerated people. Trial Court Br. 19; \nsee also DA Ryan Br. 2; DA Harrington Br. 4. And District Attorney Rachael \nRollins has correctly observed “decarceration in certain instances is the just, humane, \nand right thing to do.” DA Rollins Br. 5. The sheriffs and several district attorneys \ndo not agree, but their views are unsupported by the record and at odds with reality. \nThey have not rebutted petitioners’ showing that incarcerated people are at greater \n15 \n \n\nrisk than others during this pandemic. They have no apparent plan to keep \nincarcerated people from dying in large numbers if the virus takes hold inside \nMassachusetts correctional facilities. Rather, their arguments boil down to a fact-free \nclaim of, “We’ve got this.” But saying that Massachusetts prisoners will be okay \nbecause they (now) have free soap, as the Sheriffs contend (Sheriffs Br. 3), is like \narguing that the Titanic’s passengers might have been fine if they’d taken swimming \nlessons. No. The only safe places were off of the ship. \nII.  There are no legal impediments to this Court’s implementation of a \nremedy that meaningfully reduces incarceration levels. \n \nThe Sheriffs and the district attorneys for seven counties—Bristol, Cape & \nIslands, Essex, Hampden, Middle, Norfolk, and Plymouth (collectively, the \n“Opposing DAs”)—devote much of their brief to the proposition that this Court \ncannot order the relief petitioners request in this case. This is not so. \nA.  This lawsuit is not barred by any standing or exhaustion requirement. \n \nThe Opposing DAs assert that CPCS and MACDL lack standing to bring this \ncase because, in their view, CPCS and MACDL cannot show harm to their \nmembers. That argument is mistaken.  \nCPCS and MACDL have standing in several respects. First, CPCS and \nMACDL need not establish standing through their members because they have \norganizational standing. Both CPCS and MACDL must divert substantial resources \nfrom their usual work to the project of preventing their clients from dying in jails and \n16 \n \n\nprisons, and such a diversion of resources is sufficient to meet federal standing \nrequirements, let alone the more flexible standing rules in this Court. See Havens \nRealty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982); Chelsea Collaborative, Inc. v. \nSecretary of the Commonwealth, 480 Mass. 27 (2018) (case brought by organization \nwhose resources were diverted by voter registration requirement); New Eng. Div. of \nThe Am. Cancer Soc’y v. Comm’r of Admin., 437 Mass. 172, 177 (2002) \n(organizations had standing because they were “directly and specially” harmed in a \nway that was “fairly traceable” to the challenged actions, and would receive “a likely \nbenefit” if they won the case). Second, CPCS and MACDL have associational or \nrepresentational standing because their employees and members are harmed by the \nissues at stake here; each time a defense attorney ventures out to a prison or jail to \nvisit a client—even for a “non-contact” visit—they risk being exposed to COVID-19. \nAnd third, CPCS and MACDL have third-party standing to assert the rights of their \nincarcerated clients who cannot bring their own cases because they cannot safely \nmeet with lawyers. See Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 192–97 (1976); Eulitt ex rel. \nEulitt v. Maine, Dept of Educ, 386 F.3d 344 (1st Cir. 2004). \nFor similar reasons, the Sheriffs are wrong to argue that petitioners were \nrequired to exhaust administrative remedies before bringing this case. Sheriffs Br. \n15-16. Because they have been directly harmed by the circumstances at issue here, \nand because CPCS and MACDL are not incarcerated, exhaustion requirements do \n17 \n \n\nnot apply. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) (2013) (limiting actions under federal law \n“brought . . . by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility \nuntil such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted”); Ross v. Blake, \n136 S. Ct. 1850, 1859 (2016) (quoting Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 738 (2001)) \n(noting that under the PLRA “an inmate is required to exhaust those, but only those, \ngrievance procedures that are ‘capable of use’ to obtain ‘some relief for the action \ncomplained of’”). \nCollectively, the procedural roadblocks advanced by the Sheriffs and \nOpposing DAs betray a startling disregard for the urgency of this crisis. Can these \nlaw enforcement entities really believe this Court should sit back and wait for \nanother chance to craft a systemic approach to the COVID-19 crisis? Do they \nbelieve that CPCS and MACDL should wait to see how the grievance process plays \nout, over an unknown number of weeks, before seeking relief for their clients? If \nMassachusetts law were to require such an approach, it would be sentencing untold \nprisoners to death.  \nB.  This Court can craft remedies that reduce the number of incarcerated \npeople in Massachusetts. \n \nThe Opposing DAs and the Sheriffs purport to contest this Court’s authority \nto order the requested relief. But, upon closer inspection, very little of this Court’s \nauthority is actually in dispute.  \n18 \n \n\n1.  Both the Opposing DAs and the Sheriffs seek to refute constitutional \nclaims that, in fact, petitioners have not yet brought. Petitioners have contended that \nthe risks posed by COVID-19 to incarcerated persons implicate constitutional \nguarantees for substantive due process and against cruel or unusual punishment. See \nPet. 12-14. But as the Trial Court, the Department of Correction, and other \nrespondents point out, petitioners offer that contention merely to establish that \nCOVID-19 outbreaks “carr[y] potential constitutional ramifications,” not because we \nseek a ruling on those issues at this time. Trial Court Br. 18 n.4. That is because the \nmost important thing to do right now is to get people out of harm’s way. That is \nsomething this Court can do as an exercise of its superintendence powers under G. \nL. c. 211, § 3, without reaching the merits of any constitutional issue.  \nThat said, both the Opposing DAs and the Sheriffs downplay the rights of \nincarcerated people to a worrying degree. They contend, for example, that even if \nCOVID-19 were to sweep through Massachusetts prisons and jails, no prisoner \nwould have a constitutional right to be free of that mortal danger until they could \ndemonstrate “deliberate indifference” by their jailers. Opposing DAs Br. 19; Sheriffs \nBr. 8. Following the Supreme Court’s decision in Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. \nCt. 2466 (2015), however, prisoners do not necessarily need to establish deliberate \nindifference in order to establish conditions of confinement or improper medical \ncare that violate due process. See Darnell v. Pineiro, 849 F.3d 17, 34-35 (2d Cir. \n19 \n \n\n2017). And, as in their arguments with respect to standing and exhaustion, it is \ndismaying to hear that anyone running a jail or house of correction in Massachusetts \nmight doubt their constitutional obligation to keep prisoners safe from COVID-19. \n2.  Neither the Opposing DAs nor the Sheriffs devote much energy to \ncontesting the relief that petitioners have requested concerning people who are in \npretrial detention or who are not yet in detention, and that is likely because this \nCourt’s authority to order that relief cannot reasonably be disputed. Because \nindividual courts impose pretrial probation and detention, set bail amounts, issue \nwarrants, it is within this Court’s superintendence authority to set rules for all courts \non those issues. See, e.g., Querubin v. Commonwealth, 440 Mass. 108, 115 (2003) \n(citing the \"inherent powers of the judiciary\" as those involving adjudication of \ncriminal cases and judicial administration, including bail decisions). This would \ninclude, for example, instructing lower courts concerning the manner in which they \nconduct probation and pretrial detention hearings, canceling or suspending \noutstanding warrants, and adjusting conditions of release or terms of probation. \nLikewise, this Court has already exercised its superintendence power to hold \nthat a judge “is not required to set bail in an amount the defendant can afford if \nother relevant considerations weigh more heavily than the defendant’s ability to \nprovide the necessary security for his appearance at trial.” Brangan v. \nCommonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 693 (2017). It is equally within the Court’s authority \n20 \n \n\nto say that, during the unique circumstances of the COVID-19 state of emergency, \njudges must set bail in amounts that defendants can afford. No one should be \nexposed to a serious disease because they cannot afford bail. This is especially true \nwhen the disease has triggered an economic crash that has made it harder for \nmembers of vulnerable communities to afford bail, and when using bail “to ensure \nthe defendant’s appearance at trial” is an indefinite loss of that money because, due \nto mandatory physical distancing, there are no trials anyway. See id. at 693-94. Thus, \npetitioners’ requested relief for current or prospective pretrial detainees is both \nurgent and permissible. \n3.  Although many of the objections advanced by the Opposing DAs and \nSheriffs concern postconviction prisoners, there too this Court’s authority is ample. \nAs a threshold matter, courts have “the inherent power to stay sentences for \n‘exceptional reasons permitted by law.’” Commonwealth v. Charles, 466 Mass. 63, \n72 (2013) (quoting Commonwealth v. McLaughlin, 431 Mass. 506, 520 (2000)). In \nCharles, the Court held that the “serious and far-reaching misconduct” at the Hinton \ndrug lab presented exceptional circumstances warranting stays of sentences, noting \nthat “the interest of justice is not served by the continued imprisonment of a \ndefendant who may be entitled to a new trial.” Id. at 74. Here, the COVID-19 \npandemic presents exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of this Court’s \nstay authority. This pandemic is obviously serious and far-reaching, and the interest \n21 \n \n\nof justice is not served by the continued imprisonment of any defendant who might \nbe infected by a potentially fatal disease as a consequence of that imprisonment. \nBut, as noted by the Trial Court and Attorney General, this Court also has \nother mechanisms through which it can potentially deliver “expedited relief for those \nserving committed sentences who are . . . vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.” Trial \nCourt Br. 19 (citing G. L. c. 127, § 119A (medical parole); G. L. c. 127, §§ 49-49A \n(educational release); Mass. R. Crim. P. 29 (revisions or revocation of sentences)). \nFor example, Rule 29(a)(2) permits trial judges to revise or revoke a sentence “if it \nappears that justice may not have been done,” but only within 60 days from the \nimposition of a sentence or the issuance of a rescript after a direct appeal. To \naddress the unique circumstances of the COVID-19 crisis, this Court should \nimmediately revise Rule 29 to eliminate the 60-day limitation and to allow trial \njudges, including the Single Justice in this matter, to grant Rule 29(a)(2) relief due to \nthe threat of COVID-19. See Commonwealth v. Bastarache, 382 Mass. 86, 102 \n(1980) (the Court “may impose requirements (by order, rule or opinion) that go \nbeyond constitutional mandates”); see also Commonwealth v. O’Brien, 432 Mass. \n578, 583–84 (2000). \nContrary to arguments advanced by the Opposing DAs, revising Rule 29 in \nthis manner would not violate principles governing the separation of powers. This \nCourt has long recognized that “a conscientious judge” can lower a sentence under \n22 \n \n\nRule 29(a) based on new information demonstrating that the existing sentence may \nbe “too harsh.” Commonwealth v. McCulloch, 450 Mass. 483, 487 (2008). Relying \non a defendant’s post-sentencing conduct as grounds for Rule 29 relief is generally \nimpermissible and presents separation of powers concerns because “[t]he judiciary \nmay not act as a super-parole board.” Commonwealth v. Amirault, 415 Mass. 112, \n117 (1993); see also Commonwealth v. Barclay, 424 Mass. 377, 380 (1997). But this \nCourt has also made clear that certain post-sentencing facts not involving the \ndefendant’s post-sentencing conduct may be considered by judges applying Rule 29. \nSee Commonwealth v. Tejada, 481 Mass. 794, 795 (2019) (upholding relief granted \non the basis of unwarranted sentence disparities). That approach is warranted here. \nUnder the unique circumstances of this pandemic, which were not anticipated when \nmost Massachusetts defendants were sentenced, modest revisions of sentences \nwould not violate separation of powers so long as they do not encroach on other \nexecutive or legislative commands (such as mandatory minimum sentences). \nC.  The requested relief is consistent with the actions of other courts. \n \nGranting immediate relief to reduce incarceration levels in Massachusetts is \nnot only permissible; it would be consistent with steps other courts have taken in \nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic. These steps, some of which are collected in \nthe Appendix to this brief, include: \n  California: Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye of the California Supreme \nCourt has instructed trial courts to “[l]ower bail amounts significantly” \n23 \n \n\nand “[i]dentify detainees with less than 60 days in custody to permit \nearly release[.]” \n \n  Michigan: Chief Justice Bridget McCormack of the Michigan Supreme \nCourt has instructed courts to take various steps to reduce custodial \narrests, increase pretrial release, and reduce and suspend jail sentences. \n“Following this advice,” Justice McCormack wrote, “WILL SAVE \nLIVES.” \n \n  Ohio: Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor has urged “judges to use their \ndiscretion and release people held in jail and incarcerated individuals \nwho are in a high-risk category for being infected with the virus.”   \n \n  South Carolina: Chief Justice Wayne Beatty instructed that “any person \ncharged with a non-capital crime shall be ordered released pending trial \non his own recognizance without surety, unless an unreasonable danger \nto the community will result or the accused is an extreme flight risk.”  \n \nLikewise, last Wednesday, in ordering the release of an immigration detainee \nheld at the Plymouth County Correctional Facility, U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf \nfound a “genuine risk that [COVID-19] will spread throughout the jail.”11 And on \nFriday, in response to a COVID-19-based habeas corpus petition filed by two other \nimmigration detainees, Immigration and Customs Enforcement released them.12 \nThis Court should ensure similar relief for other incarcerated people whose \nlives are in danger due to the coronavirus pandemic. \n                                         \n11 Jimenez v. Wolf, 18-10225-MLW (D. Mass. Mar. 26, 2020), at https://www.\ncourtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.195705/gov.uscourts.mad.195705.\n507.1.pdf. \n12 See Rodas-Mazariegos v. Moniz, No. 1:20-cv-10597 (D. Mass.). \n24 \n \n\nIII.  This Court should impose a remedy that is both meaningful and \nindividualized. \n \nThe Opposing DAs and Sheriffs repeatedly assert that petitioners are insisting \non an inflexible remedy that precludes individualized decisions. That is not so. This \npetition simply seeks to achieve a level of decarceration that adequately protects our \ncommunities outside the prison walls and those who remain incarcerated. Outbreaks \nof COVID-19 in the Commonwealth’s detention facilities threaten the health and \nsafety not only of the people confined to those facilities, but also those who work \nthere, their families and communities, and all of us who may need to rely on a \nhospital system that would be overwhelmed by large-scale outbreaks in our detention \nfacilities. In bringing this petition, and in continuing to work with the Special Master \nand the respondents toward a negotiated resolution, petitioners are eager to embrace \na remedy that allows for individualized determinations of who should be released. \nBut it is critical that any such remedy be applied to the entire Commonwealth, and \nthat it achieve significant decarceration quickly.  \nA.  Any remedy must set a decarceration benchmark that is adequate to \nprotect those who are released and those who remain incarcerated. \n \nAny remedy should set a decarceration benchmark that meaningfully reduces \nthe likelihood of outbreaks behind bars. One potential benchmark could be \nreducing incarceration to, say, 50% of capacity. The DOC asserts that its facilities are \n25 \n \n\nat an average operational capacity of 73%.13 Trial Court Br. 11. But without more \ninformation, it is impossible to know whether such a benchmark would permit \nadequate physical distancing in all facilities. A second potential benchmark is to \nselect categories of people who should presumptively be released. Whatever \nbenchmark the Court uses to reduce the risk of disastrous COVID-19 outbreaks in \nour detention facilities, cf. Giftos Aff. ¶ 11, it must be tied to a very short deadline—\nsuch as 96 hours from the entry of this Court’s order. One week might be too late. \nB.  Petitioners support time-limited opportunities for individualized review. \n \nUrgency is not incompatible with individualized review. But, as the Suffolk \nDistrict Attorney explains, any “case-by-case analysis” must be completed in an \n“expedited manner” to ensure that the pandemic does not reach and spread through \nthe population. Suffolk DA Br. 14; Trial Court Br. 23-24 (“[S]uch processes should \nbe conducted in an expedited fashion, with clear standards, reflecting the time-\n                                         \n13 “[O]perational capacity” is not an appropriate metric of safety during the COVID-\n19 crisis. It is distinct from, and far higher than, the “design/rated capacity” of DOC \nfacilities. Compare DOC Quarterly Report on the Status of Prison Capacity, Third \nQuarter 2019 (“Quarterly Report”), pp. 4 & 10 (defining “design/rated capacity” as \nthe number of inmates that the planners or architects intended for an institution; \nshowing a design/rated capacity for all DOC facilities of 7,492, and an average daily \npopulation of 8,320) (available at https://www.mass.gov/doc/prison-capacity-third-\nquarter-2019/download), with DOC Weekly Count Sheet, March 23, 2020, p. 1 \n(showing an operational capacity for all DOC facilities of 10,157, and a current \npopulation of 7,916) (available at  https://www.mass.gov/doc/weekly-inmate-count-\n3232020/download).  \n26 \n \n\nsensitive nature of this situation.”). As this pandemic grows, any delay will thwart the \ngoal of saving lives. \n  The precise mechanics of the review process will depend on the benchmark. \nIf the benchmark is 50% of the operational capacity—in recognition of the fact that \n“the population of an institution is itself a risk factor,” id. at 19—the district attorneys \nwill have the prerogative to choose who is released in their respective jurisdictions. \nBut, particularly given the positions taken by the Sheriffs and Opposing DAs, district \nattorneys should be expressly instructed that they “shall exercise their prosecutorial \ndiscretion” and release all those who can be released safely in order to meet the \nbenchmark. Bridgeman v. District Attorney for the Suffolk District, 476 Mass. 298, \n300 (2017). Likewise, this Court should instruct that the benchmark is a floor, not a \nceiling, and that respondents should decarcerate further where it can be done safely, \nbecause any reduction in prisoner density will enhance protections for those left \ninside, correctional staff, and their families. See Berkshire DA Br. 2 (“[T]he only \nhope of reducing the spread of the coronavirus . . . is for all individuals to maintain a \nphysical distance of at least six feet”). \n  If the decarceration benchmark is defined by categories of incarcerated \npeople, this Court should create a presumption in favor of release for any person \nfalling into those categories. A presumption is appropriate because the categories \nthemselves will be defined to ensure that those within them can be released safely. \n27 \n \n\nEfforts in other states are instructive as to what categories for presumptive release \nthis Court might establish. The following categories, as well as those identified in the \nEmergency Petition, include particularly strong candidates for release: \n(1) All defendants who are currently detained awaiting trial on a cash bail of \n$5,000.00 or less who would be otherwise eligible for release if they could \npost the bail imposed in their case.14 This category is appropriate because \n(a) any person held on cash bail is, by definition, not dangerous, see \nBrangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 706 (2017) (“[A] judge may \nnot consider a defendant’s alleged dangerousness in setting the amount of \nbail . . . .”), and (b) the economic devastation wrought by the COVID-19 \npandemic has caused unprecedented job losses and made bail less \naffordable for many Massachusetts families.15 And there is no need to \ncontinue to hold people on bail where courts are largely closed. \n \n(2) All defendants who are within six months of their date of release.16 This \ncategory recognizes that such individuals will have nearly completed the \nterm of their sentence, and their exposure to a highly infectious and deadly \nvirus is not commensurate with the balance of the sentence that remains to \nbe served. Plus, many facilities have cancelled programming and group \nclasses, see, e.g., Tuttle Affidavit at ¶ 7, Cummings Affidavit at ¶9(i), so \nprisoners near their release dates have lost access to services that might \notherwise have aided in their transition to release. \n                                         \n14 See, e.g., Advisory from California Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye to Presiding \nJudges  and  Court  Executive  Officers  of  the  California  Courts  (Mar.  20,  2020), \nhttps://newsroom.courts.ca.gov/news/california-chief-justice-issues-second-advisory-\non-emergency-relief-measures. \n15 See, e.g., Gary Langer, A Third Report Job Loss, Half a Pay Cut as Coronovirus \nGrips the Economy, ABC News (Mar. 26, 2020) (recent polling reveals that “one in \nthree Americans . . . say they or an immediate family member have been laid off or \nlost their job as a result of the pandemic and more —half—report a cut in pay or work \nhours”), https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/report-job-loss-half-pay-cut-coronavirus-\ncrisis/story?id=69811808  \n16 See Fair and Just Prosecution, Joint Statement from Elected Prosecutors on \nCOVID- 19 and Addressing the Rights and Needs of Those in Custody (Mar. 2020), \nhttps://fairandjustprosecution.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Coronavirus-Sign-\nOn-Letter.pdf. \n28 \n \n\n \n(3) All defendants who are particularly susceptible to complications or death \nshould they contract COVID-19, either because they are over 60 years of \nage or because they suffer from a pre-existing condition that renders them \nmore vulnerable to the virus.17 \n \nOnce the presumption applies, it would then be up to the district attorney, on \na case-by-case basis, to object to release and rebut the presumption. Upon objection, \nthis Court should establish a procedure for the incarcerated person to confer with \ncounsel and proceed to a speedy hearing and adjudication of whether the \npresumption in favor of release has been rebutted. In New Jersey, for example, \nprosecutors agreed to a presumption of release for every person serving a county jail \nsentence, with continued detention permissible only upon the written objection of \nthe prosecutor and a “finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the release of \nthe inmate would pose a significant risk to the safety or the inmate or the public.”18 \nUnder the order, objections are resolved by a special master in expedited, summary \n                                         \n17 Kentucky’s Chief Justice warned that “jails are susceptible to worse-case scenarios \ndue to the close proximity of people and the number of pre-existing conditions.” \nKyle C.

The remedy must be available to people with substance use disorder.  \n \n  Particularly because so many incarcerated people in Massachusetts have \nsubstance use disorder, any remedy must take care to avoid discrimination on the \nbasis of that disorder. See, e.g., Sheriffs Br. 14; Cocchi Aff. ¶6. Substance use \ndisorder is a disability within the meaning of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and \nexcluding people with that disability from a practice of releasing people from \nincarceration—whether it is the court-supervised practice that petitioners request, or \ninstead the informal practice that might already have begun in some counties—would \nbe unlawful. See Buchanan v. Maine, 469 F.3d 158, 170-71 (1st Cir. 2006); Pesce v. \nCoppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35 (D. Mass. 2018). \n  Contrary to the Sheriffs’ suggestion, releasing prisoners with substance use \ndisorder is eminently workable. Petitioners are aware of only two counties in \nMassachusetts where correctional facilities induce medication-assisted treatment \n(MAT); the vast majority of incarcerated people on MAT will have started that \ntreatment in the community. Accordingly, petitioners’ counsel have worked \ndiligently to identify, and have brought to the attention of the Special Master, \nsubstantial treatment and therapy resources that will be available to people with \n                                         \n19 Id. \n30 \n \n\nsubstance use disorder who may be released as part of a resolution of this case and \nare already receiving, or wish to begin, MAT treatment. Burke Aff. ¶¶1-4. \nFor instance, the Police Assisted Addiction and Recovery Initiative (PAARI) \nhas partnered with the Office Based Addiction Treatment Program at Boston \nMedical Center (BMC – OBAT), the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, \nHealthy Street and AHOPE of Boston Public Health Commission to provide \n“Survival Kits,” that Sheriffs can provide to individuals upon release.20 Each kit \nincludes NARCAN and a direct number for BMC-OBAT, which is fully staffed to \nprovide telemedicine consultation and buprenorphine prescriptions the day of \nrelease, as well as to facilitate placement with a local buprenorphine prescriber. \nBMC-OBAT is especially well-situated to provide these services, as it has built \nrelationships with over 40 Community Health Centers across the state in the past 10 \nyears to expand access to buprenorphine treatment, especially in underserved areas \nand low-income communities.21 On March 25, 2020, the program distributed 200 \nkits to Essex, Suffolk and Middlesex County Sheriff Departments.

There must be an ongoing reporting requirement that permits the \nparties and the Court to assess whether the remedy is working and \nwhether it needs to be adjusted. \n \nTo assess whether we are meeting the goal of sufficiently reducing the \nprisoner population to permit the social distancing required to stem the tide of \nCOVID-19, we must have data. This data needs to tell us if the actions taken are \nchanging the living conditions in each facility. And this data needs to be provided to \nthe Attorney General, the Special Master, and Petitioners every 48 hours to catch \nany uptick of this exponentially growing virus before it spreads out of control in a \ncorrectional facility. \nTo that end, we need to know the population numbers overall and at each \nfacility so we know if the numbers are being reduced as necessary in all facilities. \nThen, we need to track the number of COVID-19 tests undertaken, the number of \npresumptive positives, and the number of positives in each facility, including staff, \nbecause if staff members test positive, incarcerated persons will likely follow. If the \nnumber of COVID-positive persons incarcerated at one facility increases at a higher \nrate than at other facilities, that is likely an indication that the facility has too many \n32 \n \n\npeople in close proximity to meet social distancing requirements. If all the facilities \nare increasing at a rate that is a threat to public health, reductions need to be quicker \nand more aggressive. Thus, it is important to know exactly how many and in what \nconditions the people at each facility are being housed--such as the number of \npeople per cell, the number of people in each dormitory, and the number of \noccupied beds within six feet of each other--so that meaningful action can be taken. \nMoreover, it is important to track the number of incarcerated people being \ntreated for COVID-19 at the Shattuck, in an infirmary, or in a health services unit, \nand the location of each person, because that will provide information regarding the \ncapacity of the Department of Correction to meet the health needs of the prisoners \nwith COVID-19 and those without. Similarly, the number of incarcerated people \ntransferred to a community hospital and the facility from which they came is \nimportant to determine if high rates of COVID-19 in a facility are having a \nsignificantly adverse impact on the community hospitals such that additional \nreductions at that facility may be necessary. \nFinally, any reporting mechanism should track the racial composition of \npeople released as part of a resolution of this case. This Court has noted “ample \nempirical evidence” of racially disparate treatment throughout the criminal legal \nsystem. Commonwealth v. Williams, 481 Mass. 443, 451 n.6 (2019). It is therefore \n33 \n \n\nessential to ascertain whether a remedy that seeks to save prisoners from a deadly \ndisease is yielding racially disparate outcomes. \nCONCLUSION \nPetitioners respectfully request the immediate implementation of an order \nthat allows for the rapid but individualized reduction of incarceration in \nMassachusetts. It will save lives. \n \n[counsel signature block on next page] \n \n34 \n \n\n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n  /s/ Rebecca A. Jacobstein      /s/ Matthew R.

Kenneally \nClerk, Supreme Judicial Court \nJohn Adams Courthouse \nOne Pemberton Square \nSuite 1300 \nBoston, MA 02108 \n \n  RE:  CPCS v. Chief Justice of the Trial Court \n        SJC-12926 \n   \nDear Clerk Kenneally: \n \n  This letter is being submitted pursuant to Mass. R. App. P. 22(c). At oral \nargument, I mentioned that we were experiencing delay in a case in Worcester \nCounty. That case is Commonwealth v. Yang, 1385CR01137. The attorney informs \nme that he filed his emergency motion on Thursday, March 26, 2020, and on \nMonday, March 30, 2020, the clerk informed him they were trying to set up a video \nhearing for some time between April 6 and April 10.   \n \n  In contrast to statements by General Counsel for the Trial Court during oral \nargument, 1Yang is emblematic of our experiences, which demonstrate repeated \ninstances of hearing delays. The attached chart provides dozens of examples of delays \nextending up to two weeks. \n                                                           \n1 Attorney Sullivan: “What the chief justices of both the district and the superior court \nhave told me is that these motions are being promptly heard. There hasn't been a \nwait for someone to be heard. The judges understand that this is [an] emergency and \nthese are emergency motions. So they have been hearing them. I don’t think it’s \naccurate that there’s been delay as far as I know in the hearing of any of these \nmotions.”  Oral Argument, 1:42:00. \n   1 \n \n\n \nWe also want to bring this Court’s attention to another obstacle to relief for \nmedically vulnerable prisoners, specifically, obtaining medical records from some of \nthe carceral facilities. An attorney reports that when he sought medical records in \nPlymouth County, they provided excellent assistance by having the client sign a \nrelease form and sending the records within a day. Bristol County House of \nCorrection, on the other hand, said they had to process the release and then they \nwould contact him with the cost via fax (and only via fax). After that, he would have to \nmail in the check before they would send the medical records. Even though the \nattorney informed Bristol of the upcoming hearing date, they refused to even \nexpedite getting him the cost of the records. \n  \n  Finally, we bring this Court’s attention to new information since the \nDepartment of Correction filed its April 1, 2020 post-argument letter. According to \nWBUR, there are now 19 prisoners, three DOC staff, and one medical provider who \ntested positive for COVID-19 at the Mass. Treatment Center in Bridgewater; one \nprisoner and two staffers at MCI-Shirley who tested positive, and one staffer at Souza-\nBaranowski Correctional Center who tested positive.2 Petitioners have also been \ninformed that, after working a shift at a Massachusetts house of correction on March \n24, a nurse was sent home and has now tested positive for COVID-19.  \n \nSincerely, \n \n/s/ Rebecca Jacobstein \n \nRebecca Jacobstein \n \n \n \n                                                           \n2 See https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/04/01/mass-prisons-jails-coronavirus \n   2 \n \n\nTABLE OF CASES \nCourt  Docket Number  Delay described  Days of Delay \nBristol Superior  1873CR248 &  March 13 – filed motion \n1973CR138  to reduce bail due to \n11 \nCOVID19 but not heard \nuntil March 24. \nChelsea District  1914CR002659;  Emergency assented to \n2014CR000207  motion to vacate bail \nrevocation filed on \n3 \nMarch 23, but not heard \nuntil March 26 (it was \ndenied). \nPlymouth  1883CR00023  Motion filed on March \nSuperior  30 but not scheduled to \nbe heard until April 8. \nThey are only doing \n9 \nvideo conferences from \nPlymouth Jail in \nPlymouth Superior \nCourts on Wednesdays. \nSuffolk Superior  1684CR00512;  March 26 - filed motion \n1084CR10335   for a bail reduction; \noriginally scheduled to \n  be heard on March 30  \nbut when AAG asked if \nthey could have later \ncall (within window of \n7 \n10 am to 2 pm) clerk \ntold them no special \naccommodations, \nremoved case from list, \nand told her to reapply \nNow scheduled for April \n3. \nWorcester  0885CR00052  Filed emergency stay \nSuperior Court  motion in connection \nwith a new trial motion  At least 14 \non March 24; judge gave  days \nCommonwealth 14 days \nto respond. \nHampden  1979CR00079  Filed motion for bail on \nSuperior Court  March 23; heard on  7 \nMarch 30; no ruling as \n\nof the afternoon of April \n1  \nSpringfield  1923CR7502  Filed motion on March \nDistrict  23 and was heard on \nMarch 31.

      "text": "Supreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth    Full Court:   SJC-12926      Filed: 4/2/2020 4:47 PM\n \n \n \n            March 27, 2020 \n \n \nFrancis V. Kenneally  \nClerk of the Supreme Judicial Court \nJohn Adams Courthouse \n1 Pemberton Square, Suite 1400, Boston, MA 02108 \n \nRe:    SJC-12926 -Response of Prisoners Legal Services  to the April 2, 2020 Letters of the \nDepartment of Correction and the Fourteen Sheriffs \nDear Clerk Kenneally: \nPrisoners’ Legal Services of Massachusetts (PLS) submits this letter in response to the \nCourt’s Order of April 1, 2020 requiring the Department of Correction and the Sheriffs to report \non the distance between prisoners in sleeping arrangements, dining and recreation.  Based on our \nyears of experience monitoring prisons, and visiting and speaking with prisoners, it is clear to \nPLS that social distancing is impossible in the vast majority of DOC and county facilities.  As \nthe DOC acknowledges in its April 2 letter, the great majority of prisoners sleep, eat, recreate, \nand engage in other activities within six feet of other prisoners.  \nEven where space permits, enforcing six feet of distance in living, dining, recreation and \nother common spaces is simply not possible.  As the spokesperson for Bristol County House of \nCorrection acknowledged earlier this week, “Six feet apart is practically impossible in any \ncorrectional setting, in any jail, in any prison, in any state, in any county, \n\n  15 \nanywhere.”1  Furthermore, regardless of physical distance, all prisons have ventilation systems \nthat circulate shared air throughout the facility, so that prisoners are effectively breathing in the \nsame air all the time.  And adequate sanitation is impossible in shared spaces with constant \ntraffic.  \n1.      Housing arrangements \n Dormitory style housing \nMost prisons rely on dormitory-style housing in which prisoners share common space for \nsleeping, eating and recreation and use common toilets, sinks and showers.  DOC has \nacknowledged that 22.5 percent of its prisoners are housed in dormitories of between 3 to 114 \npeople, and Bristol County houses 64 percent of its population in dorms.  It is almost impossible \nto control personal space or maintain constant sanitation in a dormitory setting. Further, many \ndorms are overcrowded and failing to meet Department of Public Health standards governing \nfloor space in the sleeping areas.2 \n●  At NCCI Gardner, a prisoner reported he is in a dorm with a 16 person capacity.  There \nare four such dorms that share one bathroom with six stalls, eight sinks, and three urinals. \nThere is one shower for all the men.  Another prisoner reported that he is in an open dorm \nwith 30 men.  A family member reported that their loved one lives in a 20’ x 30’ room \nwith 15 other prisoners who sleep on two- tiered bunks.  There are eight sets of bunks in \nthe room set about four feet apart. A prisoner in H building reported that he lives in dorm \nstyle housing with 42 people on the second floor and 36 people on the first floor.  Each \n                                                           \n1 https://theappeal.org/lawsuit-ice-massachusetts-coronavirus/ \n2 See, e.g. September 24, 2019 letter from DPH re NCCI Gardner. \nhttps://www.mass.gov/doc/north-central-correctional-institute-in-gardner-september-24-\n2019/download' (accessed April 2, 2020). \n \n\n  15 \nset of bunk beds is approximately two floor tiles apart and “at any given time I am \ncoughed on by five different people if I am on my bed.” \n●  An attorney observed recently at Essex County that there was a unit of women sent there \nfrom drug court, held in a room full of cots spaced approximately 18 inches apart. \n●  At Old Colony Correctional Center a prisoner in the RTU reported that there are \napproximately 84 prisoners in his unit, and approximately 50 of those are in double cells.  \nOn April 1 a memo was distributed saying prisoners are required to sleep opposite each \nother so that the person on the bottom bunk would have his head below the person on the \ntop bunk’s feet. One prisoner reported that in order to comply with this memo he would \nhave to put his face within 3 feet of the toilet, he is in a unit with 110 prisoners, 100 of \nwhom are double bunked. The unit shares 8 telephones, within 6 inches of each other, \nand shares 9 showers.  \n●  A prisoner at MCI Norfolk reported that many cells are shared by between 2-6 prisoners, \nand can be as small as 8x6 feet.  A prisoner in a single cell reported that he still has to use \na communal toilet and showers. \n●  A prisoner at Hampshire County reported that they live in rooms of approximately 14-16 \npeople, in bunk beds.  The bunk beds are approximately 2 feet apart.  Approximately 60 \npeople share 7 sinks, 7 toilets, and 7 showers. \n●  A prisoner in at Plymouth County reported that his unit has cells that hold up to 5 persons \neach.  The cells are approximately 10x12 feet. \n●  In Essex County the Voke Units 1-3 are all dorms and hold somewhere between 50-100 \npeople. \n \n\n  15 \n●  In Bristol County ICE detention there are two dorm style units which hold between 47-57 \npeople each, currently.  \n  Medical and assisted living units \nOf greatest concern is the use of dormitory-style housing in medical units and assisted \nliving units, which house many of the most vulnerable prisoners, including those at MCI Norfolk \nand MCI Shirley.  For example, the Clinical Stabilization Unit (CSU) at MCI-Norfolk holds \nsome sixteen prisoners, largely elderly, with medical conditions such as COPD and congestive \nheart failure, who live, sleep and eat in close proximity to each other.  The CSU at MCI-Shirley \nraises similar concerns. \n  Double- and triple-celled housing \nMost DOC cells were designed to hold only one person.  For example, the most recent \nDPH inspection of MCI Shirley finds that almost every unit violates the DPH crowding \nregulations because the cells are double-bunked.3   Even where cells are designed for two or \nmore prisoners, it is inevitable that some prisoners who are double- and triple-bunked will share \na cell with a COVID carrier and be at extreme risk of infection. Indeed, we have already begun \nhearing such accounts.   One prisoner at MCI-Shirley reported that his cell-mate who is \nbedridden and non-verbal was recently tested for COVID. The results are not back yet. The \nprisoner is also elderly and immunocompromised, but his cellmate is nevertheless is forced to \nfeed and care for him since staff have not entered the cell for days. This morning, a prisoner at \nMCI Norfolk reported that all units are about to be locked down.   \n                                                           \n3 See December 4, 2019 inspection report finding “inadequate floor space in all cells, cells \ndouble-bunked.”  https://www.mass.gov/doc/mci-shirley-december-4-2019/download \n \n\n  15 \nAs many of the facilities reported in their letters to the court, prisoners in two-person \ncells are asked to lie at opposite ends of the bed (head to foot) to create six feet of distance.  \nGiven the close quarters and poor circulation, it is hard to imagine this offers any meaningful \nprotection at all. \nRestrictive Housing \nAlthough the Court excluded from its Order prisoners in disciplinary isolation, it should \nbe noted that prisoners held in restrictive housing units (RHUs), or equivalent treatment units \nsuch as the Secure Treatment Program (STP) at Souza Baranowski Correctional Center, face \nparticular hazards.  First, they are escorted by two Corrections Officers each time they leave their \ncell for showers, recreation, medical appointments, or programs, which means close contact with \nofficers.  An STP prisoner reported today that handcuffs are not sterilized between uses.  Second, \neven in a RHU, there are many communal surfaces such as telephones, the kiosk used for \ncanteen and email, and the shower (which is reportedly is cleaned only once a week in the STP, \nwhere prisoners with mental disturbances are known to smear feces and blood on themselves and \ntheir cell).  Finally, prisoners are double-celled in some RHUs, and thus the risk of exposure to \nan infected cellmate is extreme.  \nDOC has already started locking down entire prisons, such as MCI Shirley,  in response \nto positive or suspected COVID-19 cases, effectively converting the institution into restrictive \nhousing.  This is not a sustainable response to the inevitable spread of COVID-19.  Indefinite \nlock-ins will take too great a toll on the mental health of vulnerable prisoners, and will also not \nbe effective at controlling the virus since it requires offices and medical staff to go cell to cell all \nday long, bringing food and medicine, as well as monitoring the health of prisoners.  \n \n \n\n  15 \nQuarantine for new arrivals \nHampden County, Plymouth County and likely other jurisdictions have established \nseparate housing units for newly admitted prisoners, who are held together for a two- week \nquarantine period.  This subjects all persons who are forced into these settings to potential \ninfection, as if one person newly entering is an asymptomatic carrier of  COVID-19, they will \neasily transmit it to others who are newly entering who may not yet have it \n2.      Medication dispensary lines and other wait lines in health units \n  Prisoners who need medication or medical care are often forced to be in close proximity \nto each other.  Medical units are small and prisoners who are called to these units for \nappointments will frequently wait together in small rooms where they cannot maintain distance \nfrom one another.  Many prisoners receive medication in “medication lines” where they will \nstand one right behind another while they wait to receive their prescribed medications. Some \nexamples are below: \n●  At South Bay a prisoner reported that when he goes to the infirmary to get chronic care \ncheck-ups, he waits with 10-15 people in a small room with no separation. \n●  At Plymouth County Correctional Center a prisoner reported that if you are called to a \nmedical appointment there is an 8x10 area where you will wait in close proximity with \nothers.  Prisoners in line to receive medication are also back to back, with no separation. \n●  At MCI Shirley prisoners have reported that mediation lines are not spaced out at all, and \nprisoners are packed in, sometimes fifty at a time, back to front. \n●  At Old Colony Correctional Center there is no social distancing during medication lines, \nand nurses are not wearing gloves or masks while handing out medications or examining \npeople.  \n \n\n  15 \n●  At NCCI Gardner a prisoner in C Dorm reported that there was only about a foot of space \nbetween prisoners during medication lines. \n●  At the Suffolk County House of Correction a prisoner reported that they are right next to \neach other during medication lines with no distancing. \n●  At Barnstable County House of Correction a prisoner reported that everyone is close to \none another during medication lines, not even one foot apart. \n●  At Nashua St. Jail a prisoner reported that there will usually be approximately 8-10 \npeople in line for medications, one right in front of another. \n3.      Chow halls \nPrisoners almost universally eat in close proximity to each other.  Even where there are \nstaggered meal times to increase social distancing, many prisoners share the same tables and \nchairs, without proper decontamination between uses. Below are some recent reports: \n●  At NCCI Gardner, prisoners go to the chow hall to get their meals, and then have the \nchoice whether to eat together there, or to return to their units, many of which are \ndormitory settings.  A prisoner in C Dorm reported on April 2 that approximately 150 \nprisoners eat in the chow hall at any given time, and it is impossible to be more than one \nfoot apart from each other.  A prisoner in H Building reported that he eats with 78 other \npeople, and it is impossible to maintain distance while in line or while eating.  \n●  At MCI Shirley, as of March 27, a prisoner reported that chow was being run as usual, \nwith approximately 300 people eating together.  The tables were all full so everyone was \ntouching each other, and the tables were not being wiped down between services. \n●  At Old Colony Correctional Center a prisoner on Unit A-2 reported that the facility had \ncut down on the number of people eating together, but still approximately 70-100 people \n \n\n  15 \nare in the chow hall at once.  People are unable to maintain distance, especially while in \nline waiting for food. While eating, people are approximately two feet apart from one \nanother. \n●  At Barnstable County, a prisoner in Unit A reported that the unit has a day room where \nall 20 prisoners housed there eat together.  \n●  At the Massachusetts Alcohol and Substance Abuse Treatment Center (MASAC) a \nperson civilly committed reported that 80 people eat together and they are not able to \ncomply with social distancing. \n●  At MCI Concord, a report on April 2 stated that they are calling for people to come to \nchow block by block, but that still means that everyone lines up and sits down elbow to \nelbow and hip to hip. There are generally about 100 people eating together at a time.  \n●  At the Suffolk County House of Correction, a prisoner reported that they all eat together \nin the same room on the unit, usually about 4-5 feet apart. \n●  At the Plymouth County Correctional Center, for the last week and a half or two weeks \nthey have one tier out at a time, they all come to the same room, eat at the same tables, \nand sit at the same chairs.  There are not enough tables to stay six feet apart while eating. \n●  At MCI Norfolk, there are approximately 14 tables in the chow hall, each with four seats \nabout a foot apart side by side and three feet apart across the table. \n4.      Recreation \nPrisoners continue to recreate together in common areas, in many cases without the ability to \neffectively socially distance and ensure decontamination of common spaces. Many of these \nrecreation areas are very small, caged in enclosures where there is little room to spread out. \nSome relevant reports from recent calls with our clients include: \n \n\n  15 \n●  In Nashua St. Jail there are 40 prisoners in unit 2-1 and they all come out of their cells to \nrecreate at the same time. People sit at tables together, with four people to a table. Phones \nare right next to one another, approximately 1.5’ apart, and shared amongst the prisoners.  \n●  In NCCI Gardner approximately 78 people recreate together in a shared space, often with \nonly 2’ between them. The prisoners share five phones, which are half an arms’ length \napart.  In the gym, there are 50-60 prisoners sharing space and 40-50 prisoners use the \nweight room at one time.  \n●  In Plymouth County Correctional Facility in the FS1 block there are currently \napproximately 25-27 people, who are let out in groups of approximately 10-15 to recreate \nin a space approximately the size of a basketball court.  They all eat at the same tables \nand sit in the same chairs.  On the morning of April 2, the chairs where people sit to \nwatch television, which had been right next to each other, were spaced out haphazardly, \nbut people are already pushing them back together.   \n●  At Old Colony Correctional Center, in the Recovery Unit, approximately 25 prisoners \nrecreate together in a shared space, generally no more than a foot or two apart from each \nother. In the Residential Treatment Unit for prisoners with mental illness, the men \ncongregate throughout the day, often sitting at tables of four together.  Recreation times \nare crowded (especially because no programs are currently offered) and the only way to \nmaintain six feet distance would be if they locked everyone into their cells.  People work \nout using the same weights, play games with one another, and share the same showers \nwithout appropriate decontamination. The telephones are shared and all in a row right \nnext to one another.  \n \n\n  15 \n●  At Suffolk County House of Correction in the CWP unit, prisoners are tasked with \ncleaning areas all over the jail.  They then come together to recreate in a room where they \ncannot maintain six feet of distance from each other.  There are approximately 10 people \nin the unit. \n●  In Hampshire County, prisoners have reported that they spend their out-of-cell time in \nday rooms of about 30 people or in a crowded gym where they are unable to socially \ndistance.  \n●  At MCI Concord, prisoners recreate together in the yard, which is packed because there is \nno programming and prisoners need to exercise.  They are playing basketball, handball, \nsoccer, and sharing telephones which are not cleaned between uses. Four blocks are \nallowed to go to the yard at a time, which means potentially up to 300 people at once. \n●  In Hampshire County, prisoners spend out of cell time in day rooms or in the gym, \nsharing space with approximately 30 people and unable to remain six feet apart.  \n●  In Barnstable County, Unit A has a day room shared by approximately 20 people at a \ntime, unable to create appropriate distance from each other.   \n5.      Other group activities. \nRegardless of what prisons and jails are able to do to maintain social distancing, there is \nso much sharing of communal spaces and surfaces that transmission is unavoidable.  Prisoners \nuse the same chairs, the same tables, the same phones, and communal showers and restrooms, to \nname a few.  In the general public we can clean as frequently as necessary to protect ourselves, \nbut prisoners do not have the same control over sanitation. PLS has also received multiple \n \n\n  15 \nreports of inadequate laundering of clothing because of lack of hot water and understaffing.  \nSome examples of communal activities creating a risk of transmission  are below: \n●  At Souza Baranowski Correctional Center, a kitchen worker reported that he is around 15 \nmen while working approximately 12 hours a day.  Everything there is communal, the \nphones and kiosks are pushed down the tier and they are not wiped down, and showers \nare all shared. \n●  At Old Colony Correctional Center, a prisoner reported on April 2 that they were still \nholding Alcoholics Anonymous groups, with fifteen to twenty people unable to maintain \nsix feet distance.  Prisoners have contact with other prisoners and staff when their vitals \nare checked, during group programming, during cell searches, when medicine is passed \nout, during clinical meetings, during movement, and when canteen is distributed. \n●  At Plymouth County Correctional Center four to six officers are distributing canteen to \ngroups of two to three prisoners at a time.   \n●  At Hampshire County Correctional Facility as of March 24 prisoners were still going to \neducational programs together or else they would face discipline.  \n 6.   Unsanitary Conditions \n DOC’s claim that it can keep the prisons clean to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 is \nundermined by Department of Public Health facility health and sanitation reports.  Virtually \nevery report describes literally hundreds of violations of DPH health and safety standards, with \nthe same violations repeated from inspection to inspection.  For example, the most recent report \nfrom the Massachusetts Treatment Center found 271 repeat violations, and observed that: \n“Throughout the facility, bathrooms and shower areas were observed to be poorly maintained \nresulting in unsanitary conditions. The CSP is concerned with the increased risk of disease \n \n\n  15 \ntransmission with the high number of inmates being exposed to such unsanitary conditions.” \n(emphasis supplied) 4 Not surprisingly, COVID-19 is now spreading uncontrollably through the \nTreatment Center. \nThe following is a sample of recent complaints regarding sanitation during the COVID \ncrisis: \n●  Prisoners from the MTC and NCCI- Gardner reported that as of March 25 there were \nmemos posted about sanitation, but neither liquid soap nor hand sanitizer was available.  \n●  On March 25, prisoners at the Worcester House of Correction reported they were given \nno extra soap or cleaning supplies.  \n●  On March 27, a prisoner at MCI Shirley reported that all staff now have and are supposed \nto wear masks, but that  in the Health Service Unit  many DOC staff and medical staff \nwere not wearing their masks while talking to prisoners, including the medical doctor, the \nhealth services administrator, nurses, and COs.  He also reported that he was part of a \n\"sanitation team\" that he was spraying down and cleaning all over the prison, but they \nhad not been called out in four days.  Tables in the Chow Hall were not being wiped \ndown between services.  \n●  On March 30, a civilly committed person at the Massachusetts Alcohol and Treatment \nCenter reported there were no soap dispensers in bathrooms and that the detainees were \nnot allowed to use bathrooms in the chow hall to clean their hands.  \n●  On March 31, a prisoner at SBCC reported that officers make breakfast in the morning \nwith no gloves or masks and cough all over the food, possibly contaminating everything.  \n                                                           \n4 See https://www.mass.gov/doc/massachusetts-treatment-center-bridgewater-february-27-\n2019/download. \n \n\n  15 \nHe also reported that he is not allowed to take a shower for hours after working all day in \nthe kitchen. \nThe Importance of More Detailed Data and Information \nThere is no further time for information gathering before the Court takes action.  \nHowever, requiring only system-wide percentages of prisoners sleeping, eating, and recreating \nwithin six feet of each other makes it very difficult to ascertain whether there are specific \nfacilities or units within facilities where the lack of distancing is particularly problematic.  For \nexample, although only a small percentage of prisoners live in medical settings, such as the CSU \nat MCI Norfolk, they are the most vulnerable and housing them together in dorms is particularly \ndangerous.  PLS submits that going forward the Court should order DOC and the Sheriffs  to \ninclude the following information in the bi-weekly population updates called for by the Special \nMaster. \n \n1.  For each facility following information regarding the configuration of each housing unit: \n●  design capacity5 \n●  current census \n●  how is the unit configured (dormitory; number of single-, double- or triple- cells) \n●  number of functioning toilets, sinks and showers and ratio of each to prisoners in \nthe unit. \n                                                           \n5 DOC is obligated by statute to compare the “design capacity” to the actual population in its \novercrowding reports.  G.L. c. 799, § 21.  Design capacity refers to the number of prisoners the \nfacility was designed to hold, whereas “operational capacity,” reflects merely DOC’s judgment \nabout how many prisoners it can manage in the facility.  The main difference, as a practical \nmatter is that the Operational Capacity reflects DOC decision to double- bunk cells that were \ndesigned for one person,and house more people in a dorm than it was built to hold.   \n \n\n  15 \n●  Square footage of common space and any rules regarding use of common space. \n●   \n2.  For each facility, the following information regarding use of personal protective \nequipment (PPE) such as masks and gloves, to staff, prisoners, and others entering the \nfacility: \n●  What proportion of each of these groups is issued PPE? \n●  What equipment is issued? \n●  How frequently is it issued? \n●   \n3.  For each facility the following information regarding medical units and medical practices \n●  Identify units used and number of beds available for quarantine of suspected cases \nand configuration (e.g. single cell, double cell, dormitory);. \n●  Identify units used and number of beds available for isolation of confirmed cases \nand configuration; \n●  Number of COVID tests administered and the number of positive tests; \n●  Number of COVID tests available currently and expected in the future. \n●  What proportion of staff in medical, quarantine, and isolation units have personal \nprotective equipment (PPE), including masks, gloves and gowns; how frequently \nis it issued; how frequently do they change it each day. \n \nThank you for your attention to these urgent concerns. \n   \n \n\n  15 \n \n \nApril 2, 2020            Respectfully submitted, \n \nPRISONERS’ LEGAL SERVICES OF \nMASSACUSETTS  \n \n \n    /s/ \n______________________________ \nELIZABETH MATOS, BBO # 671505 \nJAMES PINGEON, BBO # 541852 \nBONITA TENNERIELLO, BBO # 662132 \nJESSE WHITE, BBO# 673332 \nPrisoners Legal Services \n50 Federal Street, 4th Floor \nBoston, MA  02110 \n(617) 482-2773 \nlmatos@plsma.org \njpingeon@plsma.org \nbtenneriello@plsma.org \njwhite@plsma.org \n \n \n ",

Kenneally \nClerk, Supreme Judicial Court \nJohn Adams Courthouse \nOne Pemberton Square \nSuite 1300 \nBoston, MA 02108 \n \n  Re:   CPCS v. Chief Justice of the Trial Court \n    SJC-12926 \n \nDear Clerk Kenneally:  \n \nPetitioners write, with profound alarm, about today’s submissions from the \nDepartment of Correction and the Sheriffs. These submissions present two crises: \none inside Massachusetts carceral facilities, and one in this litigation. \n \nThe crisis for incarcerated people is that, as petitioners feared (see Pet. Reply Br. 1-\n3), vast numbers of them have no meaningful opportunity to avoid being infected by, \nor infecting others with, COVID-19. In the DOC, an estimated 72% of prisoners \nsleep within six feet of another person; an estimated 70% of prisoners eat within six \nfeet of another person, to say nothing of standing in line next to them to receive \nfood; and 100% of prisoners recreate within six feet of another person.  \n \nMeanwhile, in five counties—Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk, and \nWorcester—the Sheriffs have acknowledged that many or most people in their \ncustody are sleeping or eating less than six feet apart. And in three other counties—\nBristol, Essex, and Hampden—untold numbers are sleeping head to toe. In Bristol, \nprisoners and detainees sleep in dormitories where the bunks are “at least \napproximately 3 feet” apart. \n \nThe crisis for this litigation is the willingness of the Sheriffs in Bristol, Essex, and \nHampden Counties to claim that the head-to-toe arrangements in their facilities \nconstitute six feet of separation. Those claims are inaccurate. And although those \nSheriffs suggest that their actions are consistent with CDC guidance, that is not so. \nThe CDC’s housing guidance calls for “ideally 6 feet or more in all directions,” plus \nACLU Foundation of Massachusetts  211 Congress St., Boston, MA 02110 • 617.482.3170 • www.aclum.org \n\nClerk Fran Kenneally \nApril 2, 2020 \nPage 2 \n \narranging individuals so that they sleep “head to foot.”1 We are equally concerned \nthat the Bristol Sheriff announced this afternoon on Twitter, but not in his \nsubmission to this Court, that “[a] health care professional working at the Bristol \nCounty Sheriff’s Office has tested positive for COVID-19.”2 \n \nNo matter how the living arrangements inside Massachusetts’ carceral facilities are \ndescribed, they are dangerous—to incarcerated people, to corrections staff, and to \nthe public. In the time since this case was argued, that dire circumstance has only \ngrown more apparent and more urgent. \n  \nSincerely,  \n \n \n \nMatthew R.

      "text": "Supreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth    Full Court:   SJC-12926      Filed: 4/3/2020 9:05 AM\n \nApril 3, 2020 \n \nFrancis Kenneally, Esq. \nClerk of the Supreme Judicial Court \nSupreme Judicial Court \nOne Pemberton Square \nBoston, MA 02108 \n \n  Re:  CPCS & MACDL v. Chief Justice of the Trial Courts & others, SJC-12926 \nDear Clerk Kenneally: \n  I am writing pursuant to Mass. R. App. P. 16(l) to answer a question posed throughout \noral argument as to the authority to revisit a lawful sentence once it is imposed.  The ability of \nany court to revisit a sentence after it is imposed is circumscribed.  In contrast, the Executive \nBranch holds many options with regards to sentencing – the Governor may pardon an offense or \ncommute an offense, see Commonwealth v. Arsenault, 361 Mass. 287, 291-292 (1972); the \nDepartment of Corrections may furlough a defendant, see G.L c. 127, § 90A, and may remove a \ndefendant from one institution from another in an instance of disease, see G. L. c. 126, § 26, and \nof course the Parole Board may grant defendants parole, see G.L. c. 27, § 5. \n  The judiciary is more limited with respect to sentences.  Under the Massachusetts Rules \nof Criminal Procedure a judge has few options.  Under Rule 29, within 60 days of the imposition \nof a sentence or issuance of a rescript, “the trial judge, upon the judge’s own motion, or the \nwritten motion of the prosecutor . . . may revise or revoke a sentence if the judge determines that \nany part of the sentence was illegal,” Rule 29(a)(1) or “if it appears that justice may not have \nbeen done,” Rule 29(b)(2).  The rationale behind the rule is that “[o]ccasions inevitably will \noccur where a conscientious judge, after reflection or upon receipt of new probation reports or \nother information, will feel that he has been too harsh or has failed to give due weight to \nmitigating factors which properly he should have taken into account.”  Dist. Attorney for the N. \nDist. v. Superior Court, 342 Mass. 119, 128 (1961).  “In such cases, a judge under rule 29 may \n‘reconsider the sentence he has imposed and determine, in light of the facts as they existed at the \ntime of sentencing, whether the sentence was just.’”  Commonwealth v. Rodriguez, 461 Mass. \n256, 269 (2012) (quoting Commonwealth v. McCulloch, 450 Mass. 483, 487 (2008)) (emphasis \nadded).1  As Rule 29 must consider factors that existed at the time the sentence was imposed, it \nis not appropriate for revision as a legal mechanism to address the concerns here. \n                                                 \n1  The  Suffolk  County  District  Attorney’s  Office  also  does  not  think  the  revision  as \nproposed is suitable to address the problem here.  In a April 1, 2020 16L letter, the Middlesex, \n1 \n \n\nUnder Rule 30(a), “Any person who is imprisoned or whose liberty is restrained pursuant \nto a criminal conviction may at any time, as of right, file a written motion requesting the trial \njudge to release him or her or to correct the sentence then being served upon the ground that the \nconfinement or restraint was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States \nor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.”   \n  There are two rules Mass. R. Crim. P. 31 and Mass. R. A. P. 6, which allow for a stay in \nexecution of a sentence.  Rule 6 provides that a stay should be made in the first instance in the \ntrial, then if denied to the single justice, and the “[t]he motion shall also show the reasons for the \nrelief requested and the facts relied upon, and if the facts are subject to dispute, the motion shall \nbe supported by affidavits or other statements signed under the penalties of perjury or copies \nthereof. With the motion shall be filed such parts of the record as are relevant. The motion shall \nbe filed with the clerk of the appellate court to which the appeal is being taken. If the court is the \nSupreme Judicial Court, the motion shall be filed with the clerk of the Supreme Judicial Court \nfor Suffolk County.” \n                                                                                                                                                             \nBerkshire, and Northwestern District Attorney’s proposed that Rule 29 should be revised and \nprovision added which states:   \n“The following provision shall be in effect for the duration of the COVID-19 State of \nEmergency  declared  by  Governor  Charlie  Baker  on  March  10,  2020,  and  a  judge's \nauthority to entertain motions shall terminate when the State of Emergency is lifted. A \ntrial judge, upon the written motion of the prosecutor or a qualifying defendant pursuant \nto the terms [outlined in Section III of the Special Master's Settlement Agreement], and \nafter concluding by a preponderance of the evidence that any risks to public safety posed \nby  the  defendant’s  release  can  be  effectively  managed  through  the  imposition  of \nappropriate conditions, may temporarily stay the sentence of said defendant and order his \nor her release subject to appropriate conditions of release. A defendant released pursuant \nto this provision shall be ordered to return to custody within fourteen (14) calendar days \nafter the COVID-19 State of Emergency is lifted in the Commonwealth unless otherwise \nordered.  \nThe  above  standard  is  vague  as  written.    There  is  no  context  or  explanation  as  to  what \n“effectively managed” means and offers little guidance to a judge who would be asked to impose \nthe standard.  Instead, though the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office does not think \nrevision to Rule 29 is appropriate, if it is going to be revised the office asks that the following be \nadopted (variation from Middlesex underlined): \nThe following provision shall be in effect for the duration of the COVID-19 State of \nEmergency  declared  by  Governor  Charlie  Baker  on  March  10,  2020,  and  a  judge's \nauthority to entertain motions shall terminate when the State of Emergency is lifted. A \ntrial judge, upon the written motion of the prosecutor or a qualifying defendant pursuant \nto the terms of [SJC’s Emergency Order], may temporarily stay the sentence of said \ndefendant and order his or her release subject to appropriate conditions of release after \nfinding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the risk to the defendant’s health by \nremaining in custody outweighs the risk to public in ordering his or her release.  A \ndefendant released pursuant to this provision shall be ordered to return to custody within \nfourteen (14) calendar days after the COVID-19 State of Emergency is lifted in the \nCommonwealth unless otherwise ordered. \n2 \n \n\nUnder Rule 31, “If a sentence of imprisonment is imposed upon conviction of a crime, \nthe entry of an appeal shall not stay the execution of the sentence unless the judge imposing it or, \npursuant to Mass. R. App. P. 6, a single justice of the court that will hear the appeal, determines \nin  the  exercise  of  discretion  that  execution  of  said  sentence  shall  be  stayed  pending  the \ndetermination of the appeal. If execution of a sentence of imprisonment is stayed, the judge or \njustice may at that time make an order relative to the custody of the defendant or for admitting \nthe defendant to bail.”  Just yesterday, the Court expanded case law concerning the factors that a \njudge should consider in light of the current pandemic and concluded that when deciding a \nmotion to stay “a judge must give careful consideration not only to the risks posed by releasing \nthe defendant –- flight, danger to others or to the community, and likelihood of further criminal \nacts -- but also, during this pandemic, to the risk that the defendant might die or become \nseriously ill if kept in custody.”  Christie v. Commonwealth, 2020 Mass. Lexis 190, *2 (April 1, \n2020).   \n  In addition to the above-cited rules, the Court has the inherent authority to stay the \nexecution of a defendant’s sentence for exceptional reasons.  See Commonwealth v. Charles, 466 \nMass. 63 (2013) (judge had inherent power to stay a sentence in Dookhan case).  Further, when a \njudge uses inherent power to stay a sentence it must be with the defendant’s consent and it \nshould be for a short period of time.  See Commonwealth v. McLaughlin, 431 Mass. 506 (2000).  \nContrary to representations made by counsel during the oral argument on Tuesday, a stay may be \nissued  where  the  defendant  has  been  sentenced  pursuant  to  a  mandatory  minimum.    See \nCommonwealth v. Therriault, 401 Mass. 237 (1987).  Looking at the above, a stay seems to be \nthe appropriate legal mechanism by which already sentenced individuals may try to obtain \nrelease from confinement in light of the COVID pandemic through the inherent authority of the \ncourt. \n  Thank you for your attention to this matter. \n          Sincerely, \n \n          RACHAEL ROLLINS \n          District Attorney \n          For The Suffolk District \n \n          /s/ Cailin M.

The Courts in Suffolk \nCounty  (BMC)  were  allegedly  closed  because  one \nindividual contracted, was exposed to, or their loved-\nones were exposed to COVID-19. \n \n6\n  One  example,  in  Suffolk  County  our  staff  currently \nhas to comply with differing Orders from Chief Judge \nFabricant  for  the  Superior  Court,  Chief  Judge  Dawley \nfrom  the  District  Court  (Chelsea),  Chief  Judge \nRonquillo from the BMC – who has allowed each of the \neight  First  Justices  of  the  BMC  to  set  their  own \n\n \n  5\nTherefore,  the  District  Attorney  of  Suffolk \nCounty  agrees  with  the  Committee  for  Public  Counsel \nServices  (CPCS)  and  the  Massachusetts  Association  of \nCriminal  Defense  Lawyers  (MACDL)  that  this  Court  has \nthe  power  under  G.L.  c. 211,  §  3  to  address  this \npublic  health  emergency  and  also  agrees  that \ndecarceration  in  certain  instances  is  the  just, \nhumane,  and  right  thing  to  do.  She  asks  that  this \nCourt  exercise  its  extraordinary  powers  in  these \nextraordinary times.  \n7\nBACKGROUND  \nMost incarcerated people are confined in a small \ncell  (average  size  in  the  United  States  is  six  by \neight  feet).  These  cells  can  house  approximately  two \nto six individuals in Massachusetts. Cellmates share a \ncommunity toilet inside of their cell. There is no lid \non,  or  enclosure  around,  these  toilets.  Often, \n                                                                                                                                     \nOrders  -  and  Chief  Judge  Bryant  from  the  Juvenile \nCourt. \n \n7\n This section contains information District Attorney \nRollins has personally heard or seen during her visits \nto  facilities  in  her  capacity  as  a  sibling  of \nincarcerated  people,  a  criminal  defense  attorney,  an \nAssistant  United  States  Attorney,  a  candidate  for \nDistrict Attorney and the elected District Attorney of \nSuffolk County.  \n\n \n  6\ncellmates share the same roll of toilet paper until it \nis depleted.  \nPrisoners  that  are  housed  in  group  settings  may \nbe in bunk beds, or beds that are frequently less than \nsix  feet  apart.  They  all  use  the  same  showers  and \ntoilets found in a common area, similar to a college \ndormitory style. If an inmate happens to have a single \ncell,  they  still  have  an  open  toilet  within  a  small \ncell.  \nSome  inmates,  youth,  and  detainees  may  have \naccess  to  a  common  washer  and  dryer  in  their  Unit. \nEveryone  in  the  Unit,  sick  or  healthy,  utilizes  the \nsame  washer  and  dryer.  In  the  DOC,  there  are \ninstitutional  laundry  facilities  that  wash  the \nprisoners’ uniforms, usually once a week - colors one \nday,  whites  the  next.  All  of  the  laundry  is  brought \nback  into  the  Unit  in  a  same  cart  that  was  used  to \ntake  the  dirty  clothes  out  of  the  unit.  These  carts \nare  used  for  everything  from  transporting  belongings \nwhen  a  prisoner  moves  cells  or  units,  to  bringing \nbelongings to property to be housed due to an inmate \nmoving  to  segregation,  the  infirmary,  or  protective \ncustody.  \n\n \n  7\nIn County facilities, inmates often eat with each \nother  at  tables  of  four  in  their  Unit  or  go  to  the \nchow hall to eat. In some correctional facilities, the \nfood  is  prepackaged.  Other  facilities  have  dining \noptions  that  utilize  cafeteria  or  nearly  open  food \nstyle service, which is now in direct violation of a \n8\nrecent Public Health Order issued by Governor Baker.  \nAcross  the  board,  prisoners,  detainees  and  youth \nusually  have  access  to  unlimited  water,  juice  and \ncoffee  served  community  style.  When  inmates  go  to  a \nhealth  services  unit  to  seek  medical  attention,  well \nover ten people can be in that small area. \nThese  conditions  demonstrate  that  social \ndistancing  and  rigorous  hygiene,  the  two  most  often \ncited ways to prevent contracting and spreading COVID-\n19,  are  virtually  impossible  within  the  confines  of \nour  DYS,  HOC,  and  DOC  facilities.  District  Attorney \nRollins asks that the needs and rights of vulnerable \nindividuals in these correctional facilities therefore \nbe balanced with the needs and rights of victims and \nsurvivors  so  we  can  maintain  and  protect  community \n                                                 \n8\n  https://www.mass.gov/doc/march-25-2020-pharmacy-\ngrocery-order \n\n \n  8\nsafety and well-being as the multiple parties to this \npetition  collaborate  in  crafting  just,  fair,  and \nhumane solutions.   \nARGUMENT \nGeneral Law c. 211, § 3, in part, grants to the \nMassachusetts  Supreme  Judicial  Court  “general \nsuperintendence of all courts of inferior jurisdiction \nto correct and prevent errors and abuses therein if no \nother remedy is expressly provided.” G.L. c. 211, § 3. \nA  two-part  test  identifies  those  exceptional \ncircumstances  under  which  the  Supreme  Judicial  Court \nForte  v. \nwill  exercise  this  oversight  power. \nCommonwealth Ventresco  v. \n,  418  Mass.  98,  99  (1994); \nCommonwealth\n,  409  Mass.  82,  83  (1991).  The  party \nseeking  relief  must  demonstrate:  (1)  a  substantial \nclaim  of  violation  of  substantive  rights,  and  (2) \nerror  that  cannot  be  remedied  under  the  ordinary \nCampiti  v.  Commonwealth\nreview  process.  ,  417  Mass. \nForte\n454,  455  (1994);  ,  418  Mass.  at  99.  Under  the \nstatute,  the  Court  has  broad  superintendence  powers, \nespecially  where  an  issue  is  one  of  “systemic \n\n \n  9\nBridgeman  v.  District  Attorney  for  the \nconcern.” \nSuffolk Dist.\n, 471 Mass. 465, 474-475 (2015). \nThe Suffolk County District Attorney agrees that \nCPCS  and  MACDL  have  met  the  requirements  of  the \nstatute. Indeed, Chief Justice Ralph D. Gants recently \ninvited the Massachusetts Bar to figure out how we as \na  community,  “can  find  new  ways  to  protect  the  most \nvulnerable,  preserve  individual  rights,  resolve \ndisputes,  and  somehow  keep  the  wheels  of  justice \nturning  in  the  midst  of  this  frightening  pandemic.” \nChief Justice Ralph D. Gants Letter to the Bar (Mar. \n19,  2020),  https://www.mass.gov/news/letter-to-the-\nbar-from-supreme-judicial-court-chief-justice-ralph-d-\ngants. An outbreak of the coronavirus in our custodial \ncorrectional facilities could likely be catastrophic. \nIt is no different than throwing a match and pouring \nlighting  fluid  onto  a  massive  pile  of  dry  kindling. \nJails  and  prisons  house  disproportionately  large \nnumbers  of  people  with  chronic illnesses  and  complex \nmedical  needs  that  many  facilities  are  already  ill-\nequipped to treat. See Peter Wagner and Emily Widra, \nNo need to wait for pandemics: The public health case \nfor  criminal  justice  reform  (Mar.  6,  2020), \n\n \n  10\nhttps://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2020/03/06/pandemic. \nThey also disproportionately house people with limited \nfinancial  means  and  people  of  color,  specifically \nBlack and Brown people. \nDistrict Attorney Rollins, the duly elected chief \nlaw enforcement officer of Suffolk County, personally \nunderstands the fears of those incarcerated and their \nloved ones, as well as the people working within the \nprisons and jails and DYS facilities of the dangers of \n9\nexposure to COVID-19.  As a sibling of loved ones who \nhave  spent  time  incarcerated  in  federal,  state,  and \nlocal  facilities,  and  the  daughter  of  a  former \nCorrection  Officer,  she  has  a  personal  and  intimate \nunderstanding  of  the  dire,  sometimes  desperate \n10\nconditions behind the wall.   \n                                                 \n9\n  See fn. 3. \n \n10\n  People  do  not  stop  being  human  the  day  they  are \ncharged  or  sentenced.  We  cannot  define  them \nexclusively  by  their  worst  moment.  Their  life  is  a \nmosaic  and  they  remain  daughters,  sons,  parents, \npartners,  grandparents,  and  siblings  and  loved  ones. \nAlthough some have made terrible choices or engaged in \nreprehensible  behavior,  we  must  not  simply  ignore \nthem. The sentence they received for their crime did \nnot  include  contracting  COVID-19  and  death.  And  for \nthose pre-trial detainees, the situation is even more \ndire. They have yet to be found guilty of their crime. \n\n \n  11\nMoreover, as a candidate and since taking office, \nthe  District  Attorney  has  visited  our  correctional \ninstitutions (DYS, HOC & DOC) and met with groups of \ninmates, detainees and youth therein on the average of \n11\nonce a month.  This case is one way by which elected \nprosecutors,  the  defense  bar,  the  trial  court \nleadership,  law  enforcement  partners,  and  public \nhealth  officials  must  work  together  to  implement \nconcrete  steps  in  the  near-term  to  immediately  and \ndramatically  reduce  the  potential  number  of \nincarcerated  individuals  and  staff  exposed  to  the \nthreat  of  disastrous  outbreaks  behind  the  wall  that \nwill imperil the entire outside community. \nClaims  concerning  a  prisoner’s  denial  of \nimmediate  liberty  meet  the  requirements  of  G.L.  c. \nCoffin v. Superintendent, Mass. \n211, § 3. See, e.g., \nTreatment  Ctr.\n,  458  Mass.  186,  188  n.6  (2010)  (“The \n                                                                                                                                     \nSimilarly, Correction Officers, medical professionals, \nsocial workers, and staff put themselves at risk every \nday  doing  their  jobs.  The  nature  of  their  workplace \nunfortunately increases their potential of contracting \nCOVID-19. We are seeking decarceration to benefit them \nas well.   \n \n11\n The office as a whole has visited behind the wall \nnearly 100 times. \n\n \n  12\nplaintiff's  claim  for  relief  meets  this  test.  He \nclaims his commitment under G. L. c. 123A, § 12 (b) § \n12 [b]), deprives him of his substantive ‘right to be \nfree  from  unjustified  governmental  intrusion  on \nphysical  liberty.’”).  The  claims  presented  in  the \npetition  also  touch  upon  valid  Eighth  Amendment  and \nart. 26 concerns. Indeed, the protections of art. 26 \nand  the  Eighth  Amendment  grant  those  within  prison \nwalls  the  right  to  be  free  from  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment.  Any  analysis  of  those  rights  “‘must  draw \nits  meaning  from  the  evolving  standards  of  decency \nthat  mark  the  progress  of  a  maturing  society.’” \nMichaud v. Sheriff of Essex County\n, 390 Mass. 523, 527 \nLibby  v.  Commissioner  of  Correction\n(1983)  (quoting  , \n385 Mass. 421, 431 (1982)). Any view of decency in the \ncurrent situation would include protections and action \nto  prevent  the  unnecessary  spread  of  COVID-19 \n12\nregardless of custodial status of an individual.  \n                                                 \n12\n This would be for both prisoners that are eligible \nfor release, as well as those that pose too great a \nthreat  to  public  safety  and  cannot  be  released.  The \nCourt must make specific findings and requirements for \neach  group  of  individuals.  The  prisoners  that  remain \nincarcerated  should  not  simply  be  placed  in  solitary \nconfinement 24 hours a day if they contract COVID-19 \n\n \n  13\nDistrict  Attorney  Rollins  has  been  a  leading \nvoice  in  advocating  that  individuals  who  are \nvulnerable to the virus and pose no meaningful risk to \npublic safety should be released. She agrees with CPCS \nand  MACDL  that  the  Trial  Court  should  consider  the \nserious  health  risk  posed  by  other  incarcerated \nindividuals, and the community in probation detention \nhearings,  bail  determination  and  reconsideration \nhearings,  and  dangerousness  hearings.  As  soon  as  the \ncrisis  began,  the  Suffolk  County  District  Attorney’s \nOffice (SCDAO) committed itself to partnering with the \ndefense bar to undertake a thorough and rapid review \nof  individuals  who  were  in  pre-trial  detention  and \nsome  serving  post-conviction  sentences  and  has  been \nundertaking  such  consideration  on  a  case-by-case \nbasis; however, the District Attorney firmly believes \nthat  the  application  of  this  consideration  should  be \n13\nconsistent across the Commonwealth.   \n                                                                                                                                     \nor  left  to  die,  out  of  public  sight  and  scrutiny, \npaying  a  price  far  higher  than  the  sentence  they \nreceived for their crime. \n13\n The Court must require that each party designate a \nperson(s) responsible for oversight on behalf of their \norganization  for  each  requirement  imposed  by  this \n\n \n  14\nAccordingly  the  District  Attorney  asks  for  the \nfollowing relief: \n \n1. The  Trial  Court  should  cease  issuing  new  bench \nwarrants  for  failures  to  appear  in  non-violent \ncases  or  failures  to  pay  outstanding  fees  and \nfines  where  the  individual  has  been  found \n14\nindigent.  \n \n2. Individuals  who  are  vulnerable  to  the  virus  and \npose  no  meaningful  risk  to  public  safety  should \nbe  released.  Any  proposed  order  must  take  into \naccount, as the SCDAO individual review does now, \nthat  there  are  certain  individuals  whom  their \nrelease  will  create  too  great  a  risk  to  public \nsafety.  For  that  reason,  any  order  from  this \nCourt must include guidance for all parties of a \ncase-by-case  analysis  of  the  individual  who  is \nseeking to be released.  \n \n3. This  review  must  take  place  in  an  expedited \nmanner. Efforts to do so in Suffolk County have \nbeen  met  with  some  confusion  and  inconsistency. \nAs  such,  we  ask  that  this  Court  instruct  the \nTrial Court to hear any such motions in the court \nof  their  origin,  or  the  Superior  Court  pursuant \nto  a  Bail  Review  Petition.  The  District, \nMunicipal,  and  Superior  Court  must  have \nconcurrent  jurisdiction  of  all  requests  to \naddress  in  a  timely  manner.  We  all  must  take \nresponsibility  to  get  the  appropriate  and \nimmediate relief for those in need.  \n \n4. Motions must consider the following factors: \n                                                                                                                                     \nCourt.  In  Suffolk  County,  leadership  in  each  trial \ncourt division directly reviews all requests. \n \n14\n  Those  of  us  with  our  physical  freedom  are  being \noffered  bail-outs  in  virtually  every  facet  of  our \nfinancial lives: deferrals in mortgage payments, rent, \nstudent loans, free Wi-Fi and Google chrome books for \nBPS children, moratorium on evictions, etc.  \n\n \n  15\n \na. With a pretrial assessment:  \n \ni. The  Court  should  consider:    the \noffense;  the  defendant’s  record;  any \nparticular  health  concerns  of  the \nindividual;  and  the  reasons  that \noriginally  justified  the  individual’s \n15\npretrial detention.  Again, if there is \na  meaningful  threat  to  public  safety \ncaused  by  the  release  of  the \nindividual,  they  should  remain  in \n16\ncustody.   \n \nii. This  Court’s  order  should  address  the \nexisting  gap  in  services  when  a  Trial \nCourt order’s the release of a detained \nindividual.  In  Suffolk  County, \nunfortunately there have been instances \nwhen a Trial Court orders an individual \nreleased  with  conditions  to  be \nmonitored  by  the  Probation  Department, \n                                                 \n15\n  The  SCDAO  review  includes  specifically:  Attorney \nname  and  email  address;  Defendant  name;  docket \nnumber(s);  court  of  jurisdiction;  bail  status;  next \ncourt  date  and  event;  assigned  ADA  (if  known);  any \nmitigating  circumstances  rendering  them  particularly \nvulnerable; and housing plan when released (if any). \n \n16\n  Even  more  challenging  will  be  considerations  for \nthose who pose no risk to public safety but have no \nhome  to  return  to  upon  release.  COVID-19  has \neffectively  stopped  all  programming  for  returning \ncitizens  in  Suffolk  County,  and  our  shelters  are  at \ncapacity  and  are  also  concerned  about  the  spread  of \nCOVID-19.  Query,  would  an  individual  rather  face \nhomelessness and uncertainty, than remain incarcerated \nand potentially at a higher risk of contracting COVID-\n19? Further, do we have any role or say in making that \nchoice  for  an  individual?  Additionally,  the  Court \nshould consider whether all currently incarcerated or \ndetained  individuals  should  be  subject  to  COVID-19 \nscreening  now,  or  at  the  very  least,  prior  to  any \nrelease. \n \n\n \n  16\nbut  there  is  no  mechanism  to  notify \nprobation staff that the individual has \nbeen released.  \n \niii. This  Court’s  order  must  require \ninformation  sharing.    Information \nsharing  is  critical  during  this \nunprecedented  time  and  the  instructive \nauthority  of  this  Court  is  invaluable \nto  remove  any  obstacle  to  accomplish \nthe  concurrent  goal  goals  of  public \n17\nhealth and public safety.  \n \nb. With a post-trial assessment: \n \ni. The Court should order counsel assigned \nto those inmates with underlying health \n18\nconditions.   \n \nii. DOC  should  provide  access  to \nteleconferencing  for  those  inmates  to \nvirtually  meet  with  counsel  in  an \nexpeditious manner.  \n                                                 \n17\n  These  efforts  have  been  significantly  hampered  by \nthe  inability  to  access  critical  data  from  our  law \nenforcement partners, including real time information \nabout  those  individuals  who  have  actually  been \nreleased. Enacted in 2018, G.L. Chapter 6A, Section 18 \n¾ mandates the sharing of information.  This simply is \nnot happening. District Attorney Rollins specifically \nasks this Court to highlight the urgency of this real \nneed and to order the sharing of information in full \ncompliance of the law. \n \n18\n  For  example,  when  SCDAO  learns  of  an  individual \nserving a sentence that is asking for early release, \nthe  office  contacts  CPCS  to  assign  counsel.  The \nDistrict Attorney appreciates the willingness of CPCS \nto be extremely responsive, but is concerned that such \nassignments  are  not  provided  to  incarcerated \nindividuals  in  a  consistent  and  expeditious  manner \nacross the Commonwealth. \n\n \n  17\n \niii. A  post-conviction  review  for  release \nshould  then  be  consistent  across  the \nCommonwealth,  considering  specifically: \nthe  offense;  the  defendant’s  record; \nthe  length  of  time  left  on  the \nsentence;  any  underlying  health \nconditions;  and  post-release  plans  in \nplace.  Again,  if  there  is  a  material \nthreat  to  public  safety  caused  by  the \nrelease of any individual, they should \nremain in custody.   \n \niv. It is critical that this Court exercise \nits  superintendence  powers  to  identify \nor create the legal mechanism by which \nthis can occur in a timely manner. Any \nsuch  mechanism  that  would  contemplate \nrelief  in  the  “interest  of  justice” \nmust  be  done  in  full  compliance  with \n19\nthe Victims Bill of Rights.    \nThese  are  extraordinary  times  that  require \n20\nleadership  and  order.   District  Attorney  Rollins \nunderstands the key role prosecutors can – and must – \n                                                 \n19\n Any legal mechanism must be cognizant of art. 30 and \nthe  separation  of  powers.  It  cannot  be  a  pardon  or \ncommutation  of  sentence  as  those  powers  are  held \nSee Commonwealth \nexclusively by the Executive branch. \nv. Arsenault\n, 361 Mass. 287, 291-292 (1972); see also \nPart II, c. 2, § 1, art. 73, of the Constitution of \nthe Commonwealth.  One suggestion is to order a stay \nof execution of sentence under Mass. R. A. P. 6. \n \n20\n For this reason too, on Mar. 12th, District Attorney \nRollins  joined  other  elected  officials  and  Asian \nAmerican  civic  leaders  to  condemn  the  rise  in  hate \nspeech  and  discrimination  that  community  has  faced \namid  the  spread  of  COVID-19.  She  has  made  it  clear \nthat  no  such  behavior  will  be  tolerated  in  Suffolk \nCounty. \n \n\n \n  18\nplay  in  addressing  the  crisis  this  pandemic  has \nimposed on the criminal legal system. The exceptional \nprosecutors and staff in Suffolk County are fulfilling \nthat  role  everyday  as  this  mounting  emergency \n21\nunfurls.  The District Attorney emphasizes that public \nhealth  is  public  safety,  but  without  collaboration \nbetween the parties to this case, the efforts are too \nerratic  and  inconsistent.  As  an  example,  SCDAO  is \nalready  working  with  the  criminal  defense  bar  to \nidentify  and  highlight  which  of  their  clients  should \nbe  subject  to  release.  In  an  expedited  manner  on  a \ncase-by-case  basis  we  then  review  those  cases. \nApplication  of  this  practice  should  be  consistent \nacross  the  Commonwealth.  Finally,  this  Court  ought \ndraft relief that recognizes the extraordinary times, \nas  has  happened  in  state  and  county  jurisdictions \n                                                 \n21\n  For  example,  given  the  threat  posed  by  COVID-19, \nSCDAO  has  balanced  all  identified  best  practices  to \nkeep  our  staff  and  the  community  healthy  and  limit \nexposure to this virus. Effective Monday, March 16th, \nonsite  SCDAO  staff  was  reduced  to  a  “skeleton”  or \nessential levels and the rest of the SCDAO staff are \nworking  from  home.  The  District  Attorney  remains \nacutely aware of her responsibility to keep all of the \nresidents  of  Suffolk  County  safe  and  this  staffing \ndecision in no way compromises that obligation. \n \n\n \n  19\nacross  the  United  States,  and  lead  this  Commonwealth \nand the Nation in fighting COVID-19, while remembering \nand  considering  the  vulnerable,  invisible  and \n22\nforgotten.  \nCONCLUSION \nIn  this  time  of  chaos  and  fear,  we  need  bold \nleadership  from  this  Court  to  bring  order.

Chief Justice of the Trial Court & \nothers pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 24.   As the Commonwealth’s sole provider of civil legal \nservices to incarcerated people, PLS is a key stakeholder in these proceedings. The COVID-19 \npandemic is now approaching the Massachusetts correctional system like a tsunami.1  For the \nreasons discussed in the Amicus Letter PLS submitted in support of the Petition filed by CPCS \nand MACDL, the lives of PLS clients are in grave danger.    \n                                                \n1 New York City provides a terrifying example of what may be to come in Massachusetts.  There, the rate of jail \ninfection is seven times higher than in the rest of the city and 87 times higher than in the U.S. overall.  See \n“Prisoners At Rikers Say It’s Like A ‘Death Sentence’ As Coronavirus Spreads,” Huffington Post, March 20, 2020, \navailable at https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rikers-prisoners-\ncoronavirus_n_5e7e705ec5b6256a7a2a995d  (accessed March 30, 2020).  And the number of infected prisoners \ncontinues to soar even as the city reduces  its jail population.  As of March 30, at least 167 people currently detained \nin New York City jails have COVID-19, an increase of more than 60 percent since March 27.  Another 114 jail staff \nmembers have also tested positive for the illness. https://queenseagle.com/all/2020/3/30/at-least-167-nyc-inmates-\n114-jail-staffers-now-have-covid-19. \n  \n \n11 \n\nPLS has nearly five decades of experience advocating for the human and legal rights of \nMassachusetts prisoners, visiting prisoners on almost a daily basis, and constantly \ncommunicating with them and their families by telephone and mail.   Since many prisoners do \nnot have pending criminal cases or appeals, they are not represented by the petitioners' attorneys.   \nPLS therefore seeks to intervene to ensure that the experiences of all people living in our \ncorrectional facilities are fully heard, and so that its expertise and knowledge can be utilized in \ndeveloping a solution to this unprecedented threat to the health and safety of both prisoners and \ncorrectional staff.    \nI.  Legal Standard for Intervention    \nIntervention is permitted as of right “when the applicant claims an interest relating to the \nproperty or transaction which is the subject of the action and he is so situated that the disposition \nof the action may as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest, unless \nthe applicant's interest is adequately represented by existing parties.”  Mass. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2).    \nSee Beacon Residential Mgmt., LP v. R.P., 477 Mass. 749, 752–53 (2017).  In evaluating a \nmotion for intervention, “the judge should take all well-pleaded, nonconclusory allegations in the \nmotion to intervene, the proposed complaint or answer in intervention, and declarations \nsupporting the motion as true absent sham, frivolity or other objections.” Id. (internal quotations \nand citations omitted). \n Where intervention as of right is not appropriate, intervention may still be permitted \n“when an applicant's claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in \ncommon.” Mass. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(2) \n \n \n11 \n\nII.  Prisoners’ Legal Services has a substantial interest in the outcome of this matter \nThe type and degree of interest that suffice for intervention depend on “the nature of the \naction in which intervention is claimed.” Beacon Residential Mgmt., LP, 477 Mass. at 753.   \nHere, the Committee for Public Counsel Services and the Massachusetts Association of Criminal \nDefense Lawyers have filed an emergency petition pursuant to G. L. c. 211, § 3, requesting that \nthe Court exercise its superintendence powers to stem the tide of COVID-19 and prevent \nneedless death and permanent harm.   The people affected by this petition, prisoners in \nMassachusetts prisons and jails who are at grave risk of exposure to COVID-19, are PLS’ \nclients.  PLS’ mission is to “promote[] the safe, humane and lawful treatment of Massachusetts \nprisoners through civil rights litigation, administrative advocacy, client counseling, and outreach \nto policy makers and the public”2 and it brings a wealth of expertise to bear on the subject of the \npetition. \nPLS is a not-for-profit legal services corporation, founded in 1972, that provides civil \nlegal assistance to people who are incarcerated in Massachusetts state prisons and in the county \njails and houses of correction.  It provides advice and guidance in response to a wide array of \nrequests for assistance, and focuses in particular on five priority areas: (1) medical and mental \nhealth care (2) excessive use of force (3) extreme conditions of confinement (4) solitary \nconfinement and (5) medical parole.  PLS has gained unique expertise and understanding of \nprison conditions and practices from decades of advocacy and litigation. Many of our ongoing \ncases deal with matters directly relevant to the Petition, including parole, inadequate medical and \nmental health care, and extreme conditions of confinement.3 \n                                                \n2  http://plsma.org/about-us/our-mission/ \n3  See, e.g., Reaves v. Department of Correction, 404 F.Supp.3d 520 (D. Mass. 2019) (ruling that DOC is incapable \nof providing adequate medical care to quadriplegic prisoner and ordering his transfer to non-correctional \nhospital);  Briggs v. Department of Correction, C.A. No. 1:15-cv-40162-GAO (2019 class action settlement \n11 \n\nPLS opens approximately 2000 new intakes each year to assist persons incarcerated in \nstate prisons and county jails and houses of correction across the Commonwealth.  Since Jan. 1, \n2020, PLS has opened 600 new intakes, 140 of which related to inadequate medical or mental \nhealth care, and 100 of which related to unsafe or unsanitary conditions of confinement.   PLS \nhas also petitioned for medical parole for fourteen people, and with the advent of COVID-19 it is \nattempting to file on behalf of as many eligible people as quickly as possible.  It is currently \nworking on four additional petitions and has a list of at least 10-15 more that it is preparing to \nfile. \nThroughout the COVID-19 crisis PLS has been in constant communication with \nincarcerated people (through our toll-free telephone and by mail), their family members, doctors, \nattorneys and even prison staff.  PLS has also been in dialogue with correctional administrators \nand public safety officials.  PLS staff members have visited more than 100 prisoners in the last \ntwo months to talk to them about a variety of topics including medical parole and severe \nconditions of confinement.   It therefore has a deep understanding of how prisoners are \nresponding to the COVID-19 emergency and has many eye-witness accounts about how \n                                                                                                                                                       \nproviding accommodations to deaf and hard of hearing prisoners);  Fowler, et al. v.  Commissioner of Correction, \nC.A. NO. 1:15CV12298- NMG (2018 class action settlement mandating DOC provide prisoners access to modern \nHepatitis C medications); John Does 1-10  v. Commissioner of Correction, Suffolk No. 1984-CV-00828 (2019 class \naction challenge to DOC confinement of men civilly committed under Section 35;  Archer v.

No. 1284-cv-00250 (class \naction on behalf of all prisoners who are or will be confined in long term non-disciplinary solitary confinement \nseeking to protect their due process rights); Todd v. Commissioner of Correction, Suffolk C.A. No. 1884-cv-03972 \n(challenge to extreme and unreasonable visitation restrictions in the Department of Correction); Pearson v. \nHodgson, Case No. 1:18-cv-11130 (class action challenge to exorbitant prison telephone costs); Minich, et al. v. \nDepartment of Correction, Norfolk C.A. No. 1584CV00278 (class action settlement based on excessive and \nunnecessary use of seclusion and restraint at Bridgewater State Hospital);  Converse v. Massachusetts Department of \nCorrection, et al.,, Suffolk C.A.  No. 18-3295 (serious injury to prisoner with developmental disabilities assaulted \nby officers while on mental health watch).  \n \n11 \n\ncorrectional officials are implementing policies intended to minimize the spread of the COVID-\n19 virus.      \n PLS has developed unique and extensive knowledge of the prison system.  The \norganization is deeply familiar with medical and correctional policies and practices and has in-\ndepth insight into conditions of confinement that impact the health and safety of prisoners. Our \nstaff understands the geography and lay out of prisons and jails as well as the limits of their \ncapacity to address this unique public health crisis. \nAddressing the grave danger COVID-19 poses to PLS clients is a matter of life or death.  \nMassachusetts prisons and jails will inevitably be breeding grounds for COVID-19, likely \ncausing illness and death at a rate far higher than the general population. On March 21, 2020 the \nfirst Massachusetts prisoner tested positive for COVID-19, and by March 29, twelve prisoners \nand seven correctional staff persons had tested positive.4 PLS understands that two of the twelve \ndiagnosed prisoners have already had to be hospitalized for treatment.  Our clients are begging \nfor immediate and extraordinary action to protect them from infection and other harm from the \nprison response to COVID-19.  \nIII.  PLS’ interests are not adequately represented by the current parties \n“An applicant for intervention as of right has the burden of showing that representation \nmay be inadequate, although the burden ‘should be treated as minimal.’ ” Frostar Corp. v. \nMalloy, 77 Mass. App. Ct. 705, 712, (2010)(quoting United States Postal Service v. Brennan, \n579 F.2d 188, 191 (2d Cir.1978). “[T]he intervenor need only offer ‘an adequate explanation as \nto why’ it is not sufficiently represented by the named party. One way for the intervenor to show \ninadequate representation is to demonstrate that its interests are sufficiently different in kind or \n                                                \n4 https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/03/23/coronavirus-massachusetts-prisoner   \n11 \n\ndegree from those of the named party.” B. Fernandez & Hnos., Inc. v. Kellogg USA, Inc., 440 \nF.3d 541, 546 (1st Cir. 2006). \nA.  Many prisoners and detainees are not represented by the current petitioners. \n   As detailed in PLS’ amicus letter, it supports the action and relief requested by the \npetitioners in this case.  However, most prisoners do not have pending criminal charges or \nappeals, and are therefore not represented by CPCS or MACDL attorneys.  PLS’ institutional \nperspective is also somewhat different from that of the petitioners. CPCS and MADCL are \norganizations representing criminal defense attorneys with a strong interest in protecting the \nconstitutional rights of defendants in active criminal proceedings. In contrast, PLS’ mission is to \ndefend prisoners’ legal, civil and human rights and to advocate for their health and safety while \nthey are incarcerated, as well as to advocate for fair parole proceedings, including medical \nparole, and appropriate reentry services.   \nB.  The PLS Petition Seeks Relief Not Requested in the CPCS/MACDL Petition.  \nPLS endorses the relief sought by the Petitioner and welcomes the appointment of the \nSpecial Master as ordered by the Court on March 25, 2020.  However, PLS seeks certain \nadditional relief  including: (1) the release of all individuals civilly committed to a correctional \nfacility under G.L. c. 123 § 35, whether held at the Massachusetts Alcohol and Substance Abuse \nCenter operated by the Department of Correction or the Hampden County Jail and House of \nCorrection; (2) consideration for release of  all persons civilly committed to the Massachusetts \nTreatment Center who have not been adjudicated a sexually dangerous person under G.L. c. \n123A § 14, as well as all persons committed to Bridgewater State Hospital for evaluation of \ncompetency or criminal responsibility; (3) no person should be categorically excluded from relief \ndue to the underlying criminal offense, without consideration of actual dangerousness; (4) \n11 \n\nconsideration for release of  all individuals over 50, regardless of  whether they are sentenced \nunder G.L. c 265; (5) an order that the Parole Board (a) explicitly consider COVID-19 when it \nevaluates whether release is “incompatible with the welfare of society” under G.L. c. 127, § 130, \nand (b) shall presumptively grant parole to all parole eligible individuals unless it makes a \ndetermination based on clear and convincing  evidence that the person cannot live at liberty \nwithout violating the law. \n1.  Persons civilly committed under G.L. c. 123 § 35 should be released \nThe Petition does not address the plight of individuals civilly committed to correctional \nfacilities for alcohol and substance use disorders under G.L. c. 123, § 35.  There are currently \nalmost 250 individuals civilly committed to prisons and jails under Section 35.5  Concerns about \nthe safety of these individuals are heightened because the rapid turnover of the population in \nthese facilities makes it impossible to adequately screen newly admitted residents.  The average \nstay is only 30-40 days.  Furthermore, the congregate living arrangements and group activities \nmake it extremely difficult or impossible to provide social distancing.  The therapeutic purpose \nof their confinement has also been negated since treatment has virtually ceased.  \n2.  Persons Civilly Committed to the Massachusetts Treatment Center and \nBridgewater State Hospital should be considered for relief. \n \nThe largest outbreak so far of COVID-19 is at the Massachusetts Treatment Center, \nwhere many people are civilly committed as sexually dangerous persons.  As of March 27, ten \nprisoners, one medical staff person, and one correctional staff person tested positive for COVID-\n19.6  The Court should consider this population  eligible for relief, particularly those who have \ncompleted their criminal sentence, but have not been adjudicated a sexually dangerous person \n                                                \n5 There are 143 individuals at the Massachusetts Alcohol and Substance Abuse Center and 95 at Hampden County \nHouse of Correction. See DOC Weekly Count Sheets for March 23, 2020.  https://www.mass.gov/doc/weekly-\ninmate-count-3232020/download \n6 https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/03/23/coronavirus-massachusetts-prisoner \n11 \n\nunder G.L. c. 123A, § 14. The Massachusetts Treatment Center is on the same complex as \nBridgewater State Hospital.  Relief for persons at Bridgewater State Hospital should also be \nimplemented, particularly for those committed only for evaluation of competency or criminal \nresponsibility, but not determined to need hospital level care.  \n3.  Age should be treated the same as any other condition which creates an increased \nrisk of death or serious complication from COVID-19   \n \nThe petition seeks release of all persons with “a condition or disease that puts them at \nincreased risk of severe COVID-19 complications and death.” See Petition at 30. However, it \nasks for release of all persons over 60 only if they have not been sentenced for “crimes against \nthe person” under G.L. c. 265.  Research has shown that people in the general population age 60 \nand older are at much higher risk for death and serious complications from COVID-19 that \nrequire hospitalization and intensive care.7   Advanced age is itself a condition which places a \nperson at increased risk of severe COVID-19 complications and death, and relief should be \nprovided equally to persons over 60 as it is to persons with other medical conditions that place \nthem at increased risk. \nPLS also suggests relief be considered for prisoners 50 and older. At least one new study \nhas concluded that people age 50 and older are “around 2-and-a-half times more likely to \nprogress to a severe case of COVID-19.”8  Setting the threshold at age 50 makes particular sense \nin the correctional context because prisoners are subject to “accelerated aging” and are generally \nconsidered old at age 50 or 55, as living conditions inside prisons are hard on physical and \n                                                \n7 https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331475/nCoVsitrep11Mar2020-eng.pdf;   \nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/23/2020.02.20.20025510.full.pdf; \nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/25/2020.02.24.20027268.full.pdf; \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications/older-adults.html \n8 https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/22/819846180/study-calculates-just-how-much-\nage-medical-conditions-raise-odds-of-severe-covid \n11 \n\nemotional health.9  Further, prisoners who are over age 50 have often already served decades of \ntime, and no longer pose a threat to public safety.  In general, people convicted of violent and \nsexual offenses are among the least likely to be rearrested10 and research is clear that as people \ngrow older, they age out of crime.11 Categorically excluding geriatric prisoners from relief on the \nbasis of conviction will be counterproductive and needlessly risk lives and public health and \nsafety. \n4.  G.L. c. 265 is not an appropriate categorical exclusion from relief \n \nIn several areas of requested relief for sentenced persons, the existence of a G.L. c. 265 \nconviction would act as a categorical bar to release. This is likely in service of ensuring that \npublic safety concerns regarding release of sentenced persons are weighed against the individual \nand public health risks posed by keeping people incarcerated. Chapter 265, however, includes \ntrivial offenses such as playing a radio without headphones on public transportation.  See G.L. c. \n265, § 42.  And many of the most common chapter 265 crimes, such as assault or assault and \nbattery, are merely misdemeanors. See. G.L c. 265, § 13A(a). Categorically barring persons from \nrequested relief on the basis of conviction under G.L. c. 265 will impede the decarceration \nnecessary to minimize needless death and public health disaster.

In prison, the age at which an inmate is deemed “geriatric” varies from state to \nstate (Lemieux, Dyeson, & Castiglione, 2002). In some states, inmates as young as 50 are defined as geriatric; in \nother states, inmates are not considered geriatric until they reach age 55 or 60 (Anno et al., 2004; Lemieux et al., \n2002).

Additional persons should be eligible for parole.  \n  The CPCS petition excludes from accelerated parole consideration persons who were \nconvicted under Chapter 265.  PLS requests that no person should be categorically excluded on \nthe basis of their crime in order to effectively mitigate the threat of COVID-19.  In addition, the \nParole Board has suspended hearings for those serving life sentences due to the public nature of \nthose hearings.  Lifers should not be discriminated against during the COVID-19 emergency.  \nThe Parole Board has also cut back on House of Correction hearings as it tries to implement \nvideo hearings.  PLS asks that the Board permit the release of all prisoners who are parole \neligible without a hearing unless it concludes the person poses a demonstrated risk to public \nsafety.  More generally, consistent with pending proposed Legislation, PLS requests that the \nBoard grant parole to all prisoners at the time of eligibility “unless it determines by clear and \nconvincing evidence that, if the prisoner is released with appropriate conditions and community \nsupervision, the prisoner will not live and remain at liberty without violating the law.” See H. \n1541 (\"An Act Establishing Presumptive Parole\").  Further, the Parole Board should explicitly \nconsider COVID-19 when it evaluates whether release is “incompatible with the welfare of \nsociety” under G.L. c. 127, § 130. \nConclusion \n  Prisoners’ Legal Services moves to intervene in the above captioned matter in order to \nexpand the claims and requests for relief and to give the Court the benefit of its considerable \nknowledge and expertise in fashioning relief.    \n11 \n\n \nRespectfully submitted, \n  \nPRISONERS’ LEGAL SERVICES OF \nMASSACUSETTS  \n \n \n    /s/ \n______________________________ \nELIZABETH MATOS, BBO # 671505 \nJAMES PINGEON, BBO # 541852 \nBONITA TENNERIELLO, BBO # 662132 \nJESSE WHITE, BBO# 673332 \nPrisoners Legal Services \n50 Federal Street, 4th Floor \nBoston, MA  02110 \n(617) 482-2773 \nlmatos@plsma.org \njpingeon@plsma.org \nbtenneriello@plsma.org \njwhite@plsma.org \n \nDated: March 30, 2020 \n \n \nCertificate of Service \nI hereby certify that I have caused a copy of this motion to be served electronically upon each of \nthe parties of record on March 30, 2020. \n                /s/ \n              ____________________________ \n              Bonita Tenneriello, Esq.  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n11 ",

Kenneally, Clerk \nSupreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth \nJohn Adams Courthouse \nOne Pemberton Square \nBoston, MA 02108 \n \nRE: No. SJ-2020-0115, Submission of Mental Health Legal Advisors Committee as \namici curiae in support of the emergency petitioners seeking relief pursuant to G.L. c. \n221, § 3 \n \nDear Clerk Kenneally: \nThe General Court established the Mental Health Legal Advisors Committee (MHLAC) in 1973 \nto protect the interests of persons with mental disabilities throughout the Commonwealth. In its \nlegal and policy advocacy, MHLAC places emphasis on protecting its most vulnerable clients. \nAs mental hospitals have closed and as people with mental illness have faced increased \ncriminalization, prisons and jails have replaced psychiatric facilities as mental health providers. \nIn fact, such places of confinement are disproportionately filled with persons whose criminal \nconduct emerged from their mental health disabilities. Simply by virtue of their numbers, this \npopulation will disproportionately suffer the heightened risks associated with incarceration \nduring the COVID-19 crisis. In addition to the potential for serious illness and death, restrictions \ndesigned to contain the virus within institutions will be felt more severely by persons with \nmental disabilities. They are less likely to receive relief from confinement without the Court’s \nintervention, as these decisions will be unduly influenced by failures to consider reasonable \naccommodations as well as stereotypical assumptions about people with mental health \ndisabilities. MHLAC therefore writes the Court to voice support for the Petitioners in this matter \nand to urge the remedial measures Petitioners seek. \n \nPetitioners argue for altering the normal balancing of individual against societal interests \nperformed by various criminal justice system actors during the current COVID-19 pandemic. \nThey say that the risk to persons incarcerated is greatly amplified, and society’s interest in \nconfining persons for alleged or adjudicated law violations is significantly mitigated by the \nnature of the virus and its spread, since places of confinement are essentially “petri dishes” \nensuring enhanced contagion both within and without jails and prisons. MHLAC agrees with \nPetitioners that the balance has changed; that the Court’s intervention is necessary to assure that \nthe analysis brought to whether persons should be placed or held in correctional institutions \n     \n \n\n \n \n \nwhen they pose minimal risk to public safety must also change; and that this Court’s intervention \nis necessary to ensure this result in a time of profound health emergency. \n \nThis rationale applies with great force to persons with mental disabilities. They will suffer \nterribly from institutional efforts to contain the virus and will also, if history is any guide, be the \nleast likely candidates for application of a revised analysis that adequately factors exigencies \narising from the current crisis. \n \nSocial isolation is the chief means of combatting the virus’ spread. In the general population, for \nmost people this means that they have to stay inside their homes. In prisons or jails, a person’s \nhome is their own small cell, which they typically share with one other person or inhabit alone, \nand without access to media or communication tools like video conferencing that help to make \nsocial isolation in the general community more tolerable. The only way to even attempt to reduce \nsocial contact in correctional institutions is to lock prisoners separately in their own cells and to \neliminate access to places where prisoners congregate (e.g., gyms; meal halls). \n \nProlonged cell confinement is difficult for anyone; but it is well established that persons with \nmental disabilities suffer profoundly when confined to their cells. In Haverty v. Commissioner of \nCorrection, 437 Mass. 737 (2002), this Court credited expert testimony to the effect that such \nconfinement is “highly toxic to psychological functioning” and can cause prisoners to “develop \nsevere perceptual disturbances, including perceptual distortions and overt hallucinations.\" Id. at \n752. No societal interest justifies forcing those persons for whom Petitioners seek relief, \nincluding those who have not been convicted of any crime, to endure such consequences. \n \nIf left without instruction from this Court, mental disabilities may well be inadequately factored \nin decision making around pre-trial, renewal, or continued imprisonment. It has been long-\nestablished that the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) applies to the criminal justice \nsystem. See Pennsylvania Dep't of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 210 (1998) (ADA \napplies to prisoners); Thompson v. Davis, 295 F.3d 890, 896-897 (9th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, \n538 U.S. 921 (2003) (ADA applies to parole proceedings, including substantive decision-\nmaking). This Court was required to affirm this principle fairly recently in regard to parole \ndeterminations in Crowell v. Massachusetts Parole Board, 477 Mass. 106 (2017). The Court \nheld that the Parole Board failed to discharge its duty to avoid excluding a plaintiff with a mental \ndisability, merely because of his disability, from proper consideration of his suitability for parole. \nThe Court noted that the Board, though aware that the plaintiff suffered from a disabling \nTraumatic Brain Injury (TBI), “negatively considered the plaintiff's attitude during the parole \nhearing and his own failure to identify what the board considered to be appropriate parole \nprograms, without considering whether these behaviors were the result of his TBI” or “how the \nplaintiff's limitations affect[ed] his parole eligibility.”  Id. at 114. The Court found that the record \nbefore it did not demonstrate any “consideration of how the plaintiff's limitations affect his \nparole eligibility” and “whether these limitations could be mitigated with reasonable \nmodifications.” Id.  \n \nThe Crowell Court connected the Board’s behavior with bias toward persons with disabilities. It \nadmonished the Board for denying the plaintiff parole without even a professional evaluation of \nthe plaintiff’s suitability; in this context citing federal regulation at 28 CFR § 35.130(h) (2016) \n  2 \n\n \n \n \nfor the principle that decisions must be “based on actual risks, not on mere speculation, \nstereotypes, or generalizations about individuals with disabilities.” Id. at n. 16. In fact, such bias \nis rife in our society. See Sickel et al., Mental Health Stigma Update: A review of consequences, \nAdvances in Mental Health (Dec. 2014) (“[m]ounting evidence suggests that MHS [mental \nhealth stigma] is experienced in virtually all life domains . . .”). It is reasonable to expect that, \nwithout this Court’s guidance, bias will influence decision making on whether persons with \nmental disabilities can be safely maintained in the community during the pandemic at all levels \nof the criminal justice system. \n \nSocietal stigma might well translate into unreasonable fear at the prospect of releasing persons \nwith mental disabilities from incarcerated settings. But most such persons, if released, could \nreturn to their families and homes. In America, one in 38 adults has an immediate family \nmember currently incarcerated. See FWD.us, Every Second The Impact of Incarceration Crisis \non America’s Families, 13, https://everysecond.fwd.us/downloads/EverySecond.FWD.us.pdf. \nThese family members are not forgotten and discarded. In fact, recent events in Massachusetts’ \nhistory demonstrate the close ties between prisoners and their families, whofight for increased \ncontact with their incarcerated loved ones. In 2019, families challenged the high monetary costs \nto prisoners of calling family members. See, e.g., Sarah BetanCourt, “Families want to end \nprison phone call charges,” CommonWealth (Oct 22, 2019),  \nhttps://commonwealthmagazine.org/criminal-justice/families-want-to-end-prison-phone-call-\ncharges/; in 2018, families fought against reduced access to visit their incarcerated loved \nones. See, e.g., Jean Trounstine, “Prison Visiting Policies are about to Change in Massachusetts,” \nCity Life (Mar. 2, 2018).   \n \nAdditionally, even when family members couldn’t offer a home upon a prisoner’s discharge, \nthere are other options for released prisoners. A Boston reentry study found that for the \nincarcerated individuals who could not stay with a family member or other loved one, many \nfound temporary housing after release from incarceration. See Rappaport Institute for Greater \nBoston, The Boston Reentry Study: Housing Insecurity After Prison, Harvard Kennedy School \n(June 2015), https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/brucewestern/files/housingvfinal.pdf. \n \nOnce discharged from correctional facilities, a range of community-based supports are available \nto formerly incarcerated people with mental health issues. Many are eligible for MassHealth, a \nState Agency that partners with the Department of Corrections to provide health insurance for \nthose who have been released from prisons and jails. MassHealth provides community access \nupon release to medical and mental health services, as well as substance abuse treatment. See \n“Inmate healthcare,” https://www.mass.gov/service-details/inmate-healthcare. For those who are \nnot eligible for MassHealth, and who don’t have private insurance, there are free and affordable \nclinics available for treatment. These include community mental health centers. See National \nAlliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), COVID-19 Resource and Information Guide, at 5-6, \nhttps://www.nami.org/getattachment/About-NAMI/NAMI-News/2020/NAMI-Updates-on-the-\nCoronavirus/COVID-19-Updated-Guide-1.pdf.  \n \nFurther, many of these individuals will be eligible for services from the Department of Mental \nHealth (DMH), including Adult Community Clinical Services (ACCS). ACCS “is a \ncomprehensive, clinically focused service that provides clinical interventions and peer and \n  3 \n\n \n \n \nfamily support to facilitate engagement, support functioning and maximize symptom \nstabilization and self-management of individuals residing in all housing settings.”  See \nhttps://www.mass.gov/accs. \n \nPeople with mental illness released during the pandemic will also benefit from health support \nservices that have recently been expanded to allow all persons to isolate in place. For example, \nthere have been efforts to ease access to medication through changes that relax requirements \naround prescription refills, allow for longer intervals between refills, and postal service delivery \nof medications. There also are efforts to increase availability of telemedicine through increased \ninsurance coverage. See, e.g., CMS.gov, Medicare Telemedicine Health Care Provider Fact \nSheet, https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/medicare-telemedicine-health-care-provider-\nfact-sheet (easing restrictions on Medicare funding for telemedicine). \n \nSimilarly, services specifically for people with mental health disabilities have shifted their model \nto establish “virtual” communities. The Recovery Learning Communities, including the Western \nMA RLC, Metro Boston RLC, and the Northeast RLC, are offering peer support services \nthrough virtual meetings that are open to anyone, even beyond the community’s catchment area. \nAdditional emotional support services exist for people with mental illness while sheltering in \nplace. These include warmlines, hotlines, and on-line support communities. See NAMI, COVID-\n19 Resource and Information Guide, https://www.nami.org/getattachment/About-NAMI/NAMI-\nNews/2020/NAMI-Updates-on-the-Coronavirus/COVID-19-Updated-Guide-1.pdf. Many \naddiction treatment and support services have also developed on-line capacities. Id. \n \nFurther, many people with mental health issues have long histories of receiving support from \nsocial service agencies, including special education services from Local Education Authorities, \nDCF, DYS, DMH and DDS. These prisoners, therefore, already have established links to \nservices that will enable prompt access to services upon their discharge from prison or jail. Some \nprisoners may also be able to re-establish relationships with prior agency providers, and some \nyounger prisoners may even have ongoing entitlements to services from child-serving agencies \nthat serve persons younger than 22 years old. \n \nIt is in the interest of the general public that prisoners be afforded the best possible chance of \nsuccessful reintegration in society, including those prisoners with mental illness. This goal is best \nachieved when prisoners are healthy. We know that compromised physical health is a factor in \ncontributing to mental health problems. Improving the potential for successful integration is \nessential to making released prisoners a source of support to their families and communities. \nConfining them in small cells to protect them from contagion while misery resounds all around \nthem is a scarring experience for which we all will eventually pay.  \n \nThank you for your consideration.  \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n/s/ Phillip Kassel \nPhillip Kassel \nBBO No. 555845 \n  4 \n\n \n \n \npkassel@mhlac.org \n \n/s/ Jennifer Honig \nJennifer Honig \nBBO No. 559251 \njhonig@mhlac.org \n \n/s/ Coco Holbrook \nCoco Holbrook \nBBO No. 703504 \ncholbrook@mhlac.org \n \n/s/ Caitlin Parton \nCaitlin Parton \nBBO No. 690970 \ncparton@mhlac.org \n \nMental Health Legal Advisors Committee  \n24 School Street Suite 804 \nBoston, MA 02108 \n617-338-2345 \n \n \nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE \n \nI, Coco Holbrook, do hereby certify that the above letter is in compliance with Mass.

Box 1215 \nNorthampton, MA 01061 \n(603) 313-4410 \nJessicaLaClair@hotmail.com \n \n            March 30, 2020 \nFrancis V.

Chief Justice of the Trial Court & others, SJC-12926; \n        Amicus Letter in Support of Petitioners  \n \nDear Mr. Kenneally: \n \n  Mr. Jose Rivera is detained under G. L. c. 276, § 58A on grounds of \n“dangerousness.” People held under § 58A or charged with a violent crime --\nespecially those over sixty who have a serious medical condition -- should not \nbe exempt from any relief this Court affords to the Petitioners. The Court \nshould grant the Petitioners’ requested relief and expand the class of those \nafforded relief to all pretrial detainees. The COVID-19 virus does not \ndiscriminate on the basis of crime charged, and neither do our State or \nFederal Constitutions. With one “carefully limited exception” discussed \nbelow, there is no constitutional basis to continue pretrial detention. United \nStates v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 755 (1987).    \n \n  The 8th and 14th Amendments limit the state’s power to incarcerate \nan innocent person based on a prediction that they will commit a future \ncrime. Id. at 750, 754-755. To justify detention on grounds of dangerousness: \n \n“In a full-blown adversary hearing, the Government must convince a \nneutral decisionmaker by clear and convincing evidence that no \nconditions of release can reasonably assure the safety of the \ncommunity or any person.” \n \nId. at 750 (emphasis added). The “proposed conditions of...detention [can]not \nbe ‘excessive’ in light of the perceived evil.” Id. at 754, citing 8th Amendment. \nNo one detained under § 58A has had that full-blown adversary hearing. The \nCOVID-19 outbreak radically changes the individualized assessment each \ndetainee is constitutionally entitled to. Few if any judges who granted a § \n1 \n \n\n58A motion, before today, factored “exposure to deadly virus” into the careful \nfactual analysis required under § 58A. No full-blown adversary hearing has \nbeen held wherein the Commonwealth had the burden to prove by clear and \nconvincing evidence that a defendant’s forced exposure to COVID-19 is not \n“excessive” when balanced against the Commonwealth’s alleged safety \nconcerns. Likewise, no judge’s assessment of public safety under § 58A has \nlikely included an assessment of the risk posed to the community – to \nhealthcare workers, correctional staff, and inmates’ loved ones -- by the \ninnocent person’s detention in conditions over which they have no control. \nThat risk is rising daily.  \n \n  As this Court recently recognized in In Re Matter of a Minor, (SJC-\n12747, March 17, 2020), factual findings that satisfy a statutorily based \ndeprivation of liberty do not ipso facto satisfy due process. Slip opinion at 21. \nThis is true now under § 58A. Regardless of why an individual is held, forced \nexposure or potential exposure to COVID-19 cannot be justified under the 8th \nor 14th Amendments absent a full-blown adversarial hearing that takes into \naccount today’s radically different factual landscape, and the defendant’s \npotential deprivation, not just of liberty, but of life.    \n \n   The danger to public safety posed by the release of pretrial detainees \nhas been grossly overstated by Petitioners’ opponents. Depriving someone of \nliberty based on a prediction they will commit a future crime is, scientifically, \nbest described as a guess.1  Petitioners’ opponents cite no empirical data to \nsupport their prediction that an entire class of detainees – such as those \ncharged under Chapter 265 - will commit future crimes if released.  A \nprosecutor’s decision to seek detention based on her prediction of future \ndangerousness is subjective; it cannot be objectively extracted from other \nincentives that motivate her decision making. Pretrial detention impairs \ndefendants’ ability to aid in their defense during the investigation phase. It \nprevents prompt, easy access to defense counsel. It provides the \nCommonwealth with access to a trove of investigative material otherwise \nunavailable, such as recorded phone calls and jailhouse informants. All of \nthis gives the Commonwealth a significant and unfair litigation advantage. \nPretrial detention may also chill the exercise of a defendant’s right to testify, \nor otherwise impact defense strategy because, through cross-examination, a \nskilled prosecutor can use an innocuous remark to make damaging \n \n1 See Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880, 920 (1983)(Blackmun, J., in dissent) \n(“the unanimous conclusion of professionals in this field [is] that psychiatric \npredictions of long-term future violence are wrong more often than they are \nright.”); Note: Bail Reform and Risk Assessment: The Cautionary Tale of \nFederal Sentencing, 131 HARV. L. REV. 1125, 1131-1133 (February 9, \n2018)(discussing limitations of empirically based risk assessment tools used \nto predict future dangerousness). \n2 \n \n\ninsinuations. Cf. Commonwealth v. McGann, (SJC-12742, March 17, 2020), \nslip opinion at 16-20.  The consequences of detention can be devastating to \ndefendants and their loved ones, thereby encouraging pleas by innocent or \novercharged defendants. Protecting the accused from this power imbalance \nlies at the core of the constitutional prohibition against pretrial detention. \nSee Salerno, 481 U.S. at 767 (Marshall, J. in dissent).   \n \n  Furthermore, like the inmates’ lives themselves, the Sixth Amendment \nis not expendable during this time of crisis.  Individuals charged with a crime \nhave a right to counsel and to aid in their defense, regardless of the basis for \ndetention. The COVID-19 outbreak has eliminated that right because defense \nattorneys practicing social-distancing cannot visit clients without risking the \nintroduction of the virus into the facility. Inmates observing best practices \nwould be wise not to regularly use a communal phone. A speculative risk \nposed to the community by a detainee’s release does not justify the concrete, \nsubstantial burden on Sixth Amendment rights posed by the measures taken \nto stop the spread of COVID-19.    \n \n  Consistent with recently proposed legislation,2 this Court should grant \nrelease to all pretrial detainees, except those for whom the Commonwealth \npromptly requests a hearing and demonstrates, at a full-blown adversarial \nhearing, that the defendant poses an immediate physical threat to a specified \nvictim which no conditions of release can alleviate; and further, that the \nCommonwealth’s interest in alleviating the threat substantially outweighs \nthe risk posed to the life and liberty of the defendant and the safety of the \ncommunity. This remedy balances the District Attorneys’ preference for a \ncase-by-case approach with the constitutional rights retained by all \ndetainees, and provides an opportunity for crime victims to be notified.3  \n \n  Public safety is served by maintaining public trust in the criminal \njustice system. That means scrupulous adherence to constitutional rights \neven in a time of crisis. No statute, whether it be G. L. c. 276, § 58A or G. L. c. \n258B, trumps our State and Federal Constitutions. Now is not the time to \nsuspend constitutional rights. Our health as a community, in the aftermath \nof this crisis, will depend upon our shared belief in their power.  \n \nVery truly yours, \n \n            /s/ Jessica LaClair \n            ______________________ \n            Jessica LaClair  \n            BBO# 675350 \n \n2See Bill HD.4963, “An Act Regarding Decarceration and COVID-19.”  \n3Crime victims are not a monolith; not all will favor pretrial confinement.  \n3 \n \n\n             P.O.

Kenneally, Clerk for the Commonwealth \nSupreme Judicial Court \nJohn Adams Courthouse \nOne Pemberton Square, Suite 1400 \nBoston, MA  02108 \n \nRe:  Committee for Public Counsel Services, et al. v. Chief Justice of the Trial Court, et al., \nNo. SJC-12926 \n \nDear Mr. Kenneally: \n \n  Pursuant to the Chief Justice’s invitation at oral argument in the above-referenced case, I \nwrite to offer supplemental authority regarding the possibility of an emergency amendment to Mass. \nR. Crim. P. 29 (“Rule 29”), and related separation-of-powers issues.  The Attorney General’s Office \nis generally in agreement with the letter filed yesterday by the Middlesex, Berkshire, and \nNorthwestern District Attorneys in this matter, and I write in further support of this Court’s authority \nto amend Rule 29 to address circumstances arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic.1  \n \n  Ample authority exists for treating the authority to alter sentences as judicial rather than \nexecutive in nature, even once the execution of sentence has begun.2  The United States Supreme \nCourt explained in United States v. Benz, 282 U.S. 304 (1931), that “[t]o render judgment is a judicial \nfunction.  To carry the judgment into effect is an executive function.”  Id. at 311.  Thus, the Supreme \nCourt held that “[t]o cut short a sentence by an act of clemency is an exercise of executive power \nwhich abridges the enforcement of the judgment, but does not alter it qua judgment.  To reduce a \nsentence by amendment alters the terms of the judgment itself, and is a judicial act as much as the \nimposition of the sentence in the first instance.”  Id.  This Court cited that passage of Benz with \napproval in a case concerning the authority of a judge to revise a sentence once execution of the \nsentence had begun.  See Dist. Att’y for the N. Dist. v. Superior Court, 342 Mass. 119, 126-28 (1961).   \n \n  Relatedly, while this Court has often noted that post-sentencing events should not be \n \n1 This letter is filed only on behalf of the Attorney General. \n2 Revision of a sentence to be more severe than originally pronounced may implicate the prohibition against double \njeopardy.  See generally Commonwealth v. Selavka, 469 Mass. 502 (2014). \n\nconsidered in assessing a Rule 29 motion, those observations have generally been in the context of \npost-sentencing conduct by the defendant.  See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Tejeda, 481 Mass. 794, 797 \n(2019) (Lowy, J.) (“[O]ur cases emphasizing that facts not in existence at the time of sentencing \ncannot serve as the basis for an altered sentence have focused on the conduct of the defendant or a \ndenial of parole…. [A] defendant’s actions postsentencing are best considered by a parole board.”); \nCommonwealth v. Barclay, 424 Mass. 377, 380 (1997) (“[A] judge [considering a Rule 29 motion] \nmay not take into account conduct of the defendant that occurs subsequent to the original \nsentencing.”); Commonwealth v. McGuinness, 421 Mass. 472, 476 n.4 (1995) (“A judge may not \ninterfere with the executive function of the parole board by using postconviction evidence in an order \nto revise and revoke.”).  But the situation is different when the judge considers only post-sentencing \nemergency circumstances beyond anyone’s control, as is the case here.  As this Court held in Tejeda, \n“[t]he underlying principles governing rule 29 motions are fairness and justice,” 481 Mass. at 797, \nand those principles apply when unforeseen and emergency circumstances call the fairness and \njustice of a previously-imposed sentence into question. \n \n  With respect to timeliness, this Court has described the 60-day limit in Rule 29 as \n“jurisdictional.”  E.g., Commonwealth v. DeJesus, 440 Mass. 147, 150-51 (2003).  However, in a case \nunder Rule 29’s statutory predecessor, former G.L. c. 278, § 29C (repealed, St. 1979, c. 344, § 48),3 \nthis Court treated a virtually identical 60-day period as waivable.  See Commonwealth v. L’Italien, \n352 Mass. 424, 425 n.1 (1967) (“We note that the defendant filed his motions long after the \nexpiration of sixty days. The Commonwealth, however, did not raise this issue.”).  This Court has \nalso allowed the 60-day period to be tolled.  See Commonwealth v. Sitko, 372 Mass. 305, 312 (1977) \n(holding that defendant’s unauthorized 7-month absence from Massachusetts following sentencing \n“in effect tolled the time period in Section 29C for the period of that absence”).  Conversely, in \nCommonwealth v. Layne, 386 Mass. 291 (1982), this Court “assume[d] for the purposes of this case \nthat the defendant technically complied with the requirement” of filing a Rule 29 motion within 60 \ndays of the appellate court’s rescript, but nonetheless held that the motion was “filed long after any \nreasonable time for the prosecution of an appeal has passed,” and thus was untimely.  Id. at 294-95.  \nThus, despite the apparently plain language of the 60-day time limit in Rule 29 and its statutory \npredecessor, there is precedent both for entertaining motions to revise and revoke outside the 60-day \nlimit, and for refusing to consider them even though technically timely, based on “the policy \nunderlying the rule.”  Id. at 295; see also Sitko, 372 Mass. at 312 (holding that tolling the 60-day \nperiod in the circumstances “permits the statute to operate as the Legislature intended”).4 \n \n  As stated at oral argument in this case, our office does not know of any Massachusetts \nprecedent directly addressing the judiciary’s authority to revise and revoke sentences in \ncircumstances like the extraordinary ones in which we find ourselves.  But, for the reasons explained \nherein, at oral argument, and in our response to the petition, it remains the Attorney General’s view \n \n3 Former § 29C read: “If it appears to the superior court that justice has not been done or cannot be done, it may within \nsixty days after a sentence has been imposed, upon such terms and conditions as it shall order, revise or revoke any \nsentence imposed: if such sentence was imposed without trial after a plea of guilty or nolo contendere the court may in the \nevent of such revocation permit the withdrawal of the plea upon which the sentence was imposed.”  Commonwealth v. \nL’Italien, 352 Mass. 424, 425 n.1 (1967) (quoting St. 1962, c. 310, § 2). \n4 In Tejeda, the Rule 29 motion was timely, having been filed within 60 days of this Court’s rescript on direct review of \nthe defendant’s conviction (although long after he was sentenced).  See Brief for the Commonwealth in No. SJC-12593, at \n8. \n \n2 \n \n\nthat, in light of those circumstances, the separation of powers would not be offended by an \namendment to Rule 29 along the lines set forth in the Special Master’s Report and Recommendation. \n \nI would appreciate your circulating this letter to the Justices.  Thank you for your assistance. \n \nYours sincerely, \n \n              /s/ David C. Kravitz \n \nDavid C. Kravitz \nDeputy State Solicitor \n \ncc:  All counsel of record (by efile and email) \n \n3 \n ",

Doyle, Clerk \nSupreme Judicial Court for The County of Suffolk \nJohn Adams Court House, 1st Floor \nOne Pemberton Square - Suite 1300 \nBoston, MA 02108-1707 \n  \nRe: Committee for Public Counsel Services and Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense \n​\nLawyers v. Chief Justice of the Trial Court, No. SJC-12926 \n​\n  \nDear Clerks Kenneally and Doyle, \nAs individual members of the organizations identified below who are most directly \nimpacted by incarceration, we write to affirm that people who are incarcerated desperately want \nto come home to their loved ones. We also write to urge even broader relief than Petitioners \nrequest. \n● Families for Justice as Healing is an organization of incarcerated and formerly \n​\nincarcerated women and women with incarcerated loved ones from across Massachusetts. \nOur members include women who are currently incarcerated at Suffolk County House of \nCorrection and MCI Framingham; families from the most incarcerated neighborhoods in \n1 \n\nthe Commonwealth;1 and family members of people who are incarcerated at every \nMassachusetts Department of Correction facility and many jails. \n● The National Council For Incarcerated and Formerly Incarcerated Women and Girls \n(“The National Council”) is a national organization representing thousands of women \nwho are incarcerated in county jails, state prisons, and federal prisons as well as formerly \nincarcerated women in every state in America. The National Council is based in \nRoxbury, Massachusetts. \n● Sisters Unchained is a Boston-based organization founded by and serving daughters with \n​\nincarcerated parents. Members of Sisters Unchained have mothers and fathers who are or \nhave been incarcerated at jails and prisons across the Commonwealth. \n● New Beginnings Re-Entry Services is a community-based program that empowers and \n​ ​\nprovides supportive services to formerly incarcerated women to successfully rejoin their \ncommunities. New Beginnings Re-Entry Services provides evidence-based treatment and \nsupervision programs so that formerly incarcerated women can address their trauma, \nheal, and advance their lives.  \nIncarcerated and formerly incarcerated people are the experts in the experience of being \nincarcerated, reentering the community after incarceration, and addressing the root causes of \nincarceration with community-based solutions. Many of our loved ones have been excluded from \nthe relief sought by Petitioners, yet still we are advocating for all those who might be released by \n1 See generally Benjamin Forman et al., MassINC, The Geography of Incarceration: The Cost and Consequences of \n​ ​\nHigh Incarceration Rates in Vulnerable City Neighborhoods (2016), \nhttps://2gaiae1lifzt2tsfgr2vil6c-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/The-Geography-of-Incarcerat\nion.pdf; see also, e.g., Benjamin Forman & Lindiwe Rennert, The Geography of Incarceration \n​ ​ ​\nin a Gateway City: The Cost and Consequences of High Incarceration Rate Neighborhoods in Worcester (2017), \nhttps://massinc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geography.crime_.report.8.pdf.  \n​\n2 \n\nthis Court because we know that people in the Commonwealth’s prisons and jails are safer at \nhome in our communities and will be embraced by their families and loved ones if released. \nA. Incarcerated people are members of families and communities, and we want \n   \n​ ​\nthem to come home. \nThe majority of all incarcerated people are parents. In Boston, about 1 of every 20 \nchildren has a parent who has been incarcerated.2 Further, based on an estimate from the Vera \nInstitute of Justice, “Across Massachusetts, about 5,665 children [currently] have a parent in \nprison or jail.”3 By another estimate, “[i]n Massachusetts, 69,000 children, or five percent of the \nstate’s children, have been affected by parental incarceration at some point during their \nchildhood.”4 \nFamilies for Justice as Healing recently coordinated a Listening Tour to conduct \nparticipatory research led by formerly incarcerated women and women with incarcerated loved \nones from the most incarcerated neighborhoods in Massachusetts. We interviewed 144 women in \nthe Boston area. 93% of the formerly incarcerated women interviewed had an incarcerated loved \none. To say that people inside prison have no family support is to render women, particularly \nwomen of color, invisible.  \n2 Celia Harris & Kim Gilhuly, Human Impact Partners, Keeping Kids and Parents Together: A Healthier Approach \nto Sentencing in Massachusetts i, 3 (2017), \nhttps://humanimpact.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/KeepingMAKidsParentsTogetherHealthier_2017.09.pdf. \n​\n3 Id. at 3 (citing Elizabeth Swavola et al., Vera Inst. of Justice, Overlooked: Women and Jails in an Era of Reform \n​ ​ ​​\n(2016), https://www.vera.org/publications/overlooked-women-and-jails-report).  \n​ ​\n4 Victoria Law, The Other Family Separation: Prisoners Fight to Keep Their Children, Prison Legal News (Jan. 7, \n​ ​\n2020), \nhttps://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2020/jan/7/other-family-separation-prisoners-fight-keep-their-children/. \n​\n3 \n\nOur local participatory research as well as state and national studies show that the \nmajority of people who love and care for their incarcerated loved ones are women.5 Women have \nexperienced and witnessed the ways that incarceration causes financial hardship because of \nsending money to sustain their incarcerated loved ones, losing family income, or both. Still, \nwomen and families affirm the need to stay connected and maintain relationships with their \nincarcerated loved ones. Mothers, grandmothers, aunts, siblings, wives, and \ngirlfriends—including many of us—want incarcerated loved ones to be released and are willing \nand prepared to help loved ones safely and successfully return to our communities. \nFamilies for Justice as Healing, the National Council, Sisters Unchained, and New \nBeginnings Re-Entry Services run regular programming attended by dozens of formerly \nincarcerated people and family members of incarcerated loved ones including mothers, fathers, \ngrandparents, siblings, spouses, partners, and children. Our families regularly call, visit, and \nemail loved ones to maintain close connection, even while we may also struggle with the \nexorbitant cost incurred by such communication. Massachusetts families spend an average of \n$24 million dollars a year on phone calls to incarcerated loved ones.6  \nIn the Listening Tour, Families for Justice as Healing asked women what was most \nimportant about phone communication with their loved ones, and 45% of women responded “just \n​\nhearing their voice and knowing they are okay.”7 61% of the women Families for Justice as \n​\nHealing interviewed spent more than $40 a month, making the cost of phone calls to loved ones \n5 Gina Clayton et al., Essie Justice Group, Because She’s Powerful: The Political Isolation and Resistance of \nWomen with Incarcerated Loved Ones (2018), \nhttps://www.becauseshespowerful.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Essie-Justice-Group_Because-Shes-Powerful-R\neport.pdf. \n​\n6 Jodi Reed, Bill filed would make prison phone calls free in Massachusetts, WWLP (Jan. 15, 2020), \n​ ​\nhttps://www.wwlp.com/news/state-politics/bill-filed-would-make-prison-phone-calls-free-in-massachusetts. \n​\n7 Families for Justice as Healing, Reimagining Communities: Prioritizing People Not Prison (forthcoming 2020) (on \nfile with authors). \n4 \n\nin jail or prison as much or more than a utility bill. Families in our networks are extremely \ncommitted to maintaining communication with incarcerated loved ones, especially during the \nCOVID-19 crisis. These families are committed to their loved one’s release and ready to \nwelcome them home.  \nThe Department of Correction (DOC) may inform this Court that there are incarcerated \npeople who do not wish to leave prison because relationships with their families have naturally \ngrown distant. We know the opposite is likely true: the DOC establishes intentional barriers that \nserve only to create rifts in families and isolate incarcerated people, which is directly \ncounterproductive to rehabilitation, healing, and stability for people who are imprisoned. \nFamilies have to contend with harsh restrictions on visitation imposed by the DOC. DOC \n​​\nrequires people to be pre-approved before they can visit their loved ones and limits the number \nof individuals who can visit each incarcerated person. The number of visits to incarcerated \npeople in Massachusetts jails and prisons fell 23 percent in 2018, the first year under new DOC \nrules restricting how many individuals may visit any one prisoner.8 The DOC visitation policy \nhas inhibited visits, effectively punishing incarcerated people and their families for maintaining \nhealthy, strong relationships. The policy negatively impacted families so profoundly that DOC \nreceived significant pushback from the public and Prisoners’ Legal Services filed suit.9 In \nresponse, DOC modified its policy slightly to increase the number of individuals who can visit \npeople incarcerated at the maximum security prison from five to eight and allowed incarcerated \npeople to update their visitor lists three times a year.  \n8 Mark Arsenault, Visits to Mass. prisoners fall sharply under new rules, Bos. Globe (July 10, 2019), \n​ ​\nhttps://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/07/10/visits-prisoners-fall-sharply-under-new-rules-critics-say-inmates-w\nill-now-have-tougher-time-rejoining-society/gn1t2SE1bCHIhEn8Yaxo8H/story.html. \n​\n9 Bill Barton, Massachusetts Prisoners and Visitors Challenge Restrictive Visitation Rules, Prison Legal News \n​ ​\n(Sept. 8, 2019), \nhttps://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2019/sep/8/massachusetts-prisoners-and-visitors-challenge-restrictive-visitat\nion-rules/. \n​\n5 \n\nUnsatisfied with such meager improvements, families of incarcerated loved ones have \ncontinued to organize for better visitation policy. Members of our organizations actively \nsupported “An Act to strengthen inmate [sic] visitation”10 out of the deep desire to stay \nconnected with incarcerated loved ones. Despite all of the barriers DOC has erected to prevent \nincarcerated people from maintaining connections with their community, family members \ncontinue to make visiting a central part of their lives in order to sustain these relationships.  \nIncarcerated people, formerly incarcerated people, and our families consistently lead \nadvocacy to improve the lives of people impacted by incarceration. In addition to strengthening \nvisitation policy, we have recently: organized to restore the right to vote to incarcerated people;11 \nadvocated for legislation to make phone calls free for people in jails and prisons;12 worked \ntogether to address incidents of brutality against people incarcerated at Souza Baranowski \nCorrectional Center,13 and most recently urged Governor Baker “to release as many people as \npossible from jails and prisons and stop the flow of people into jails and prisons in order to stem \nthe spread of COVID-19.”14 We do this because we love and support our people behind bars, and \nwe know that our love and support are key to rehabilitation and helping them thrive.  \n10 S.B. 1379, 2019-2020 Gen.

Incarceration is not safer than community. \nWe know from our incarcerated loved ones that they do not feel safe where they are as \nthis pandemic unfolds. People incarcerated in the Commonwealth have reported to loved ones \nthat they do not have access to free or adequate soap, sanitizing or cleaning products, or enough \ntoilet paper.15 Incarcerated people are telling family members that Sheriff Departments and the \nDOC have failed to implement preventative measures. The only public COVID-19 policies \nissued by the DOC were a ban on visitation16 and a since-rescinded moratorium on disciplining \nand suspending guards.17 \nJust weeks before the COVID-19 pandemic, the DOC was sued by individual plaintiffs \nwho are currently incarcerated, as well as the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense \nLawyers (MACDL) and the Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS), for instances of \nbrutality and wrongfully barring attorney access to people incarcerated at Souza-Baranowski as \npart of a weeks-long lockdown and collective punishment response to a January incident. In a \ndecision awarding plaintiffs a preliminary injunction, Judge Beverly Cannone wrote that the \n​\nDOC had “an exaggerated response to the serious security concerns here.”18 The DOC is not a \n​ ​ ​\nreliable messenger about the behavior of staff, conditions inside its prisons, or the experiences or \nneeds of people who are incarcerated. In finding it likely that the DOC interfered with people’s \nconstitutional rights by threats, intimidation, or coercion, Judge Cannone explained: \n​\n[T]he tactical team seized all property from the[ir] [] cells, including their legal \nmaterial and put them in bags. While doing so, they handcuffed the [incarcerated \n15 See, e.g., Jean Trounstine, Massachusetts COVID-19 Decarceration Bill Could Protect Us All, Dig Boston (Mar. \n​ ​ ​ ​\n21, 2020), https://digboston.com/massachusetts-covid-19-decarceration-bill-could-protect-us-all. \n​ ​\n16  Updated: DOC Temporarily Suspends Family and Friend Visits at Facilities Statewide, Mass.gov (Mar. 12, \n​ ​\n2020), \nhttps://www.mass.gov/news/updated-doctemporarily-suspends-family-and-friend-visits-at-facilities-statewide. \n​\n17 Betancourt, supra note 12. \n​ ​\n18 Larocque et al. v.

Specifically, Plaintiff Silva-Prentice suffered Taser burns and \nseveral of his dreadlocks were pulled from his scalp. There was also testimony \nthat once noncontact attorney visits resumed, Inner Perimeter Security officers \nwere seated a few feet away . . . and could hear the conversations between the \nattorneys and the [incarcerated people].19 \nThe support and communication from families like ours is what keeps incarcerated \npeople sane while they try to survive life in an institution filled with violence, mistreatment, and \ninhumane conditions of confinement. The DOC and county sheriffs have abysmal track records \nof prioritizing the health and well-being of incarcerated people.20 Community-based alternatives, \nespecially those designed and led by formerly incarcerated people, are best equipped to properly \naddress the needs and traumas of incarcerated people and strengthen family connections. New \nBeginnings Re-Entry Services is poised to open “Kimya’s House,” an eighteen-bed home for \nwomen being released from incarceration. New Beginnings is run by Stacey Borden, herself a \nformerly incarcerated woman and a licensed drug and alcohol counselor. Ms. Borden notes, “As \n​\na licensed mental health care professional, I am appalled at the DOC’s violation of the privacy of \nthese individuals. To state publicly that their families don’t want them is not only cruel and \nuntrue but adds to the stigma that burdens people who suffer from mental illness. That \nstatement proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that the DOC is not qualified or prepared to take \ncare of anyone during this crisis, much less those with special healthcare needs.” \n19 Id. at 28. \n​ ​\n20 Christine Willmsen & Beth Healy, Pain And Profits: Sheriffs Hand Off Inmate Care To Private Health \n​\nCompanies, WBUR (Mar. 24, 2020), \n​\nhttps://www.wbur.org/investigations/2020/03/24/jail-health-companies-profit-sheriffs-watch (“Here in the \n​\ncommonwealth, at the Suffolk County jail, NaphCare was sued by a man who alleged that a severe reaction to \nantibiotics put him in the hospital for weeks, skin peeling from his body.

Many families are ready to help their loved ones transition home from jail and \nprison.  \nOut of the 144 women interviewed by Families for Justice as Healing during our \nListening Tour, more than one out of every three women with a loved one incarcerated has either \nhoused their loved one or helped them look for housing upon their release. Families for Justice as \nHealing asked women to identify the types of reentry services they received and where they \nreceived them. Only one woman who indicated she received some sort of assistance with \nhousing said she received that help from the DOC or the Sheriff’s Department. According to our \nparticipatory research, formerly incarcerated people largely received re-entry assistance from \ntheir families, as well as community-based organizations and nonprofits, which is consistent with \nacademic research.21 Some of those organizations were: Rosie’s Place, Boston Healthcare for the \nHomeless, Richardson House, Coolidge House, and Celeste House.  \nWhen Families for Justice as Healing asked formerly incarcerated women what the most \nchallenging things were about being incarcerated, by far the largest number of responses (29%) \nhad to do with being away from their families. Additional concerns included mistreatment by \nguards, unsanitary conditions, and lack of medical attention. An overwhelming finding among \nformerly incarcerated women was how inhumanely women had been treated by corrections \n​\nofficers. In fact, when we asked a question at the end of the survey to see if women wanted to \nshare anything that we had not asked about, many stories came out about treatment by correction \nofficers. Here is one of the many examples documented during our Listening Tour: \n​\n21 Harvard Kennedy School Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston, Research Brief: The Boston Reentry Study: \nFamily Support After Prison (2015), https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/brucewestern/files/familyvfinal.pdf; see also \n​ ​ ​\nBruce Western et al., Stress and Hardship After Prison, Working Paper (Oct. 2014), \n​ ​\nhttps://scholar.harvard.edu/files/brucewestern/files/trans08.pdf. \n​\n9 \n\n“The way the COs talk to you, the way that some of the other different people you \n​\ncome into connection with talk to you, and degrade you, and make you feel like \nyou’re not capable of turning it around no matter how much they say they’re \nthere for you. When you talk to people like they’re not human, then they begin to \nsee the “not human” side of themselves more than the other side.” \n​\nFamilies for Justice as Healing collected many testimonies from women with similar \nexperiences. Incarcerated men in our network also report abuse and degradation. These \nexperiences reflect the reality that incarcerated people cannot trust or rely on corrections staff.  \nD. We need immediate relief for our loved ones. \nOne of the programs run by Families for Justice as Healing is Participatory Defense. \nThrough that community, our families come together to strategize and support one another for \nloved ones with criminal cases. We know that since the courts issued the emergency orders, \nindividualized bail reviews have been totally ineffective in our families’ cases. None of our \nfamilies have been able to get bail reviews and our elders’ appeals are all on pause. We support \nthis Petition because we know the only thing that has a chance of success while courts largely \nremain closed is some kind of mass relief through the Supreme Judicial Court’s superintendence \npower. That said, we also strongly believe the requested relief does not go far enough. \nOur incarcerated loved ones range in age from 18 to almost 70. Ms. Elizabeth Hutchinson \nis 68 years old and incarcerated at MCI-Framingham where she is serving a life without parole \nsentence. Ms. Hutchinson suffers from serious chronic conditions which cause her debilitating \npain and limit her mobility. Among these conditions are severe asthma and advanced severe \nosteoporosis. She also experiences neuropathy and edema. Ms. Hutchinson has to use ankle and \nknee braces and can only walk using crutches. Before the COVID-19 pandemic Ms. Hutchinson \nwrote to Families for Justice as Healing to say,  \n10 \n\nI’m in constant pain, and they want to shackle my ankles and put me in a van to \nride to the hospital, and the shackles stay on in the hospital, and for the ride back \nto the prison. The shackles leave bruises for weeks and the pain is much more \nsevere. I am afraid to try to walk in shackles due to my limited mobility and being \nI can only walk with crutches I will fall and injure myself more severely. I have to \nrefuse to get proper medical care and I fear due to no medical care I will be \nconfined to a wheelchair. \n​\nOn top of the physical pain she suffers, Ms. Hutchinson struggles to breathe and needs to use her \ninhaler multiple times a day. Ms. Hutchinson is one of many incarcerated loved ones who were \ndebilitated with severe health issues and inadequate healthcare before COVID-19 and are at \nextreme risk every day they remain incarcerated. \nEven if this Court were to award the full relief requested by Petitioners, but for her \nasthma diagnosis, Ms. Hutchinson, an elderly woman and a threat to no one, would be left to die \na premature and painful death from a rapidly spreading infectious disease because of her crime \nof conviction. Her debilitating physical ailments and advanced age would not enable her to any \nreprieve because she is serving a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for a crime \nagainst a person.22 In Massachusetts, one in eight women in prison is serving a life sentence, tied \nwith Georgia and Utah for third place in the nation, behind only Louisiana and California.23 \nBarring relief for people serving life or virtual life sentences will disproportionately affect \nwomen, including many elderly women who would be safe to release and could return to live \ntheir twilight years in the comfort of family’s loving embrace or the chosen family and \ncommunity of our network of providers who serve currently and formerly incarcerated people.  \n \n22 The Petition excludes from the proposed relief “individuals who are over the age of 60 and thus at increased risk \nof severe COVID-19 complications and death” who are incarcerated for an offense or offenses appearing in G.L. c., \n§ 265 (crimes against the person).

Impact on Community \nTo conclude our letter, we would like to speak to the Court as individuals directly \nimpacted by incarceration. Here are our reflections—stories of our loved ones. We are scared for \nthem, and we want them to be safe and healthy. We know the best way to ensure their safety and \nhealth is to let them come home. \n“I currently have a husband and nephew who are both incarcerated in two different DOC \nfacilities. My nephew is housed at MTC where there have been confirmed cases on his unit. We \nfear for his health, as they are not providing the proper items to prevent the spread of the virus \neven after so many confirmed cases. The appropriate disinfecting measures are not being \nimplemented frequently at either of these facilities, nevermind providing soap or sanitizer for \nproper hand-washing. My husband and I have a nine-year-old son who loves both his cousin and \nfather dearly. The anxiety of knowing our loved ones are sitting ducks waiting to be infected is \nunbearable. They are loved, and have families willing and waiting with open arms and proper \nshelter for them. Ensure their safety by releasing them immediately!” - NR, Norfolk County \n“My name is Dawne Young. My son Dante Starks, who by the way, is a loving father of three \nbeautiful children, who need him home, is incarcerated at Plymouth County, for a small drug \noffense. Our communities need our people home with the families that are waiting with open \narms for them. We reject the idea that our loved ones don’t have anywhere to go. Let my son \ncome home. We love him. #FreeOurFamilies” - Dawne Young, Middlesex County \n“Just because someone is locked up as a pre-sentenced detainee does not immediately imply that \nthey are unloved, uncared for, or homeless and forgotten. My fiancée is currently being held at \nthe Middleton HOC due to a high bail for a 3rd DUI. Not only is David loved and cared for but \n12 \n\nhe has a home and a job to return to and for the DOC to state that all detainees would be better \nserved incarcerated, living in unsanitary conditions where now their health and well-being is \nbeing compromised even though they have not been convicted of a crime is surely violation of \ntheir constitutional rights because let us not forget delayed justice is denied justice and with the \ncurrent status of the courts justice inevitably is not only delayed but it denies basic human \nrights.” - Barbara A. Jarosz, Essex County, on behalf of her loved one David Purtell in \nMiddleton HOC \n“I have visited my brother almost every Sunday for 29 years since 1991, and from 1972 to 1979 \nalong with my younger brother who visited every week. Usually when we would visit the \nvisiting room was packed with family members who loved their people. Also, if a little \ninvestigation was done they would find the Department of ‘Corrections’ recently changed the \nvisiting policy to limit the amount of people who could visit, demonstrating how many people \nare not estranged from their families as they would like you to believe.” - Kazi Toure, Suffolk \nCounty \n“My name is Pamela Starks. I am Dante Starks’s oldest aunt. I reject the idea that he has \nnowhere to go when he is released. He is a loving father of three beautiful children, who need \nhim home. He is incarcerated at Plymouth County for a small drug charge by the federal \ngovernment. Our community needs our people home with the families that are here for them. Let \nmy nephew come home. We love him. #FreeOurFamilies” - Pamela Starks, Plymouth County \n“Me and my entire family miss and still very much care about my little brother who is in Souza \nright now. As you are reading this, the DOC has not done any preventive measures to make sure \nthis infection is being taken seriously. We do not want to be safe out here in our homes knowing \nthat he is being neglected and is being talked about as an afterthought of who needs to be safe. \n13 \n\nOur home is open to him and any others we can accommodate. There are entire communities \nacross Massachusetts who still love their incarcerated loved ones, and want to do everything in \ntheir own power to make sure they are safe from this pandemic.” - Jurrell Laronal \n“Please free our people! They are at great risk of COVID 19! They all have someone who \nimmensely loves them! Further, there is a desperate need for families to be united during this \ncrisis. Fathers who love and, without question, will protect their families. Women who would \nmove mountains to secure their families. For far too long, we’ve kept hope alive to survive! This \ncannot be delayed any longer! Please free our people now! Please do not allow them to perish in \nprison!” - Celia Dawn, Suffolk County \n“Public health experts and community members agree: incarcerated people are part of our \ncommunity. Massachusetts officials must release as many people as possible. Free our loved \nones, brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, daughters, and friends in order to protect our \ncommunities during the COVID-19 pandemic. #FreeOurFamilies” - Jackie Curet \n“Hello my name is Calvena D. And I would ask that Frantz Polynice be released immediately as \n​\nhe is being detained in the Bridgewater State Hospital/Jail which has been recently known to \nhave some positive cases of the Covid-19 virus. I am greatly concerned with the well-being of \nFrantz as he is battling with mental health issues and is at risk being held in a prison with the \ncoronavirus. Frantz has a variety of support and a treatment plan set up for him and he has been \nincarcerated for 4 years. I would also ask that Steven J. Gerald be immediately released from the \nPondville Correctional Center (Pre-Release) as he has served most of his sentence and again this \nvirus is spreading rapidly throughout the jails and there is word from our incarcerated loved ones \nthat they are lacking the necessary supplies and materials needed to live safely and manage the \ncare of themselves during this pandemic. We Love our Incarcerated Family and they are not \n14 \n\nanimals. They deserve to Live and to be Treated Like Human Beings and not just a Number or \nanother statistic. Thank U for Your Time Cooperation and Consideration.” - Calvena D., \nPlymouth County \n“I’m worried about the well-being of my husband and that’s because the DOC has repeatedly \nshown that they have been unable to keep him safe time and time again. And if the state can’t \ntake accountability and keep our loved ones safe why do they get to decide whether or not their \nlives matter? My husband along with 100s of other men should be home safe with their families \nduring this pandemic. My family along with many others will welcome these men home a \nmillion times over.” - Yessenia Luiz \n“My name is Terie Starks. I reject the assumption that you are making about our loved ones. My \nnephew Dante Starks has a huge family along with three children that miss and long for his \nreturn. You should release Dante immediately. He has a loving home that will receive him.” - \nTerie Starks, Plymouth County \n“William Goforth incarcerated at MCI Norfolk has made parole and has a loving family and \nbeautiful home to come home to. In fact he has 3 homes to go to, yet the DOC is still holding \nhim.” - Leslie Credle, Suffolk County \n“Can you please release my eligible brothers and sisters, their lives are dependent on their \nrelease!” - Wayne A. Lane, Norfolk County \n“Our loved one should be released and not caged during this pandemic. I have a brother in Souza \nBaranowski who is over 50 years of age, his respiratory condition suffers with spasm in the \nbronchi of his lungs, causing difficulties for him to breath. My family and I want our brother \n15 \n\nTony Gaskins to be released so he can come home and be where he's supposed to be, with us.” - \nS. Alice Gaskins-Hayes, Suffolk County \n“What my son has endured at the hands of DOC employees ‘just because’ has caused me to lose \nfaith in the humanity of those in power. I am praying that someone has the courage to do what is \nright instead of what is profitable for themselves.” - Kayla Daniel, Suffolk County \n“Incarcerated individuals are people too and deserve the same rights of protection, consideration, \nand opportunity to live as every other citizen. Many families are ready and able to provide \nsupport and a safe haven for their loved ones when they are provided with these rights. I am just \none of them....” - Cassandra Moran, Suffolk County \n“My husband is currently incarcerated at SBCC max prison where they are not cleaning or \nsanitizing units at such a crucial time!! During this pandemic I'm more worried about him as this \nseems to only get worse. The population in prison given the strength of the virus will only make \nit worse for him & all inmates. This early release would relieve the pressure, anxiety myself & \nhis family have during this pandemic. Home is where he needs to be right now, where he is \nloved, isn't alone & supported by his family & kids. I hope that my input will be useful for all \ninmates & families as I'm sure we all feel the same way.” - Joa Santiago \n​\n“The roots of a family are deeply planted, always united at the core!!” - H.McGee, Bristol \nCounty \n“I have been with my husband since I was 18 years old and I will be 30 in July and out of all this \ntime we have done together, I say we because he isn't ever alone. The only thing I can say from \nour experience is the Massachusetts Department of Correction is designed to destroy families. \n16 \n\nPlease don't allow people to be lost in an already broken system. Thank you.” - Mrs. Martin, \nSuffolk County \n“My family members and best friends are STILL incarcerated. Every day you keep them there \nyou are putting them more at risk. Incarceration is not safer and never has been. Now more than \never we need you to let our people come home to our communities that will never stop loving \nand supporting them.” - Olivia M., Norfolk County \n“Good people make bad choices, please don't let it become a death sentence. The prison where \nmy husband is incarcerated is already over capacity at 168% and the dorm he is living in is \nbecoming more crowded every day. Please allow my husband Jeffrey Johnson to come home, he \nonly has 6 months left with no probation or parole upon release.” - Tamara Johnson, Worcester \nCounty \n“My fiancé is currently incarcerated at MTC. They were locked in on Friday morning prior to \nlunch without being told why and without being given a chance to notify family members. They \nwere not allowed phone calls until days later and it has been once a day for the last few days. \nThey were unable to shower for quite some time and were making sure to wash in a sink. The \nfood they were being given was enough for a small child and was given cold. My fiancé was \ngiven a melted tray with food and he asked for another tray. He stated they were human, not \nanimals and we’re being treated worse than an animal. He is on a unit where they were holding \nthe sick inmates and were not given any extra soap, hand sanitizer, etc. He told me that those \nwho were handing out food were using the same gloves that they were opening doors with and \nreaching into a bag of bread handing them out. This is disgusting. My fiancé isn’t in there for a \nviolent crime. He’s in there due to someone lying about their age. Though he wouldn’t qualify \nfor early release, he as well as the others are human. They have no one who will listen to their \n17 \n\ncomplaints. These men do have families that love them. They have parents, wives, children and \nfriends who want them home. At this point they are safer at home than incarcerated with the \nDOC. No cdc guidelines were followed and had no protocol in place. When they were allowed to \nmake calls, phones were not being cleaned in between uses. This is not helping in managing the \nspread of this virus, especially with it taking sometimes 14 days to show symptoms. This is \ninexcusable and unacceptable. Things need to change and fast. This isn’t ok. With the rate that \nthis virus is spreading, those that are in for minimal offenses or who are already compromised \nshould be able to go home. My fear is that this will start killing these inmates off. Please do \nsomething.” - Nancy, Bristol County \n“My partner is incarcerated and suffers from asthma. I worry that this underlying condition will \npredispose him to complications related to COVID-19. He, and so many others, need to be \nreleased to their loved ones who will take them in with open arms and keep them and the world \nsafe by self-isolating.” Rachel Corey, Suffolk County \n“Our incarcerated loved one lives in a dangerous and humiliating environment where life is at \nrisk every day and rehabilitation is a fantasy. Living in such close quarters, no amount of \"street \nsmarts\" will protect them from the Coronavirus. Our son has asthma and a serious mental illness. \nWe would lovingly welcome him back to #19 Rogers Way in Dennisport, MA and have plans for \nhim to work with a local farmer. In this extraordinary time please show mercy to Alex \nRosen-Schuh W109593.” V. Schuh, Barnstable County \n“I would love to see my brother Anthony Davis released. He is a victim of cruel and unusual \npunishment. My brother should not be living in these conditions.” - Jean G. Toussaint, Suffolk \nCounty \n18 \n\n“My son is the glue to our family and we all miss him deeply. If he is released, it will be the \nhappiest day of our lives because we will be complete again. He doesn’t go one week without a \nvisit from someone in our family and his friends every day that a visit is offered. We are \ncommitted to supporting him currently and when he comes home.” Dulce Sepulveda, Essex \nCounty \n“To whom it may concern, I currently have a loved one that is incarcerated in the Concord \nCounty jail system and in the midst of this coronavirus. On top of dealing with the stress of \nworrying about my own personal safety, regarding this virus. I also worry deeply about my \nfamily member that is locked away in what could potentially be a nesting ground for the virus. \nPlease have consideration for the safety of all human beings in this time of crisis.” - Marvin M., \nMiddlesex County \n“My King is incarcerated & he is very much loved, respected and valued. He is loved by his \nchildren , mother, father ,aunts, uncles, grandmother & many more people in the community. I \nmyself and others in the community love and support our incarcerated family, comrades,sisters \n& brothers. We are in full support of the release of those elderly & sick detained people. They \nhave a community of people in the free Cipher who are & will be there to support them when \nreleased. They are not alone, they are valued , loved, respected and in need of being home in \nsafer conditions. PEACE.” - Earth Reflects Divinity (Shakiyla), Worcester County \n“Those who are incarcerated should be released due to the underlying virus that’s spreading \nrapidly across the nation. . We as a family care deeply about their health, safety and well being. \nThe release of the prisoners who are experiencing concerns regarding their health would ease the \n19 \n\nfamilies and loved ones hearts and minds during this time. Please consider this matter as if it \nwere your family member.” Herobinson, Suffolk County \n“Low risk offenders, elderly, medically vulnerable and incarcerated individuals with less than 6 \nmonths should have the opportunity to be released. Other inmates that do not fall under these \ncategories should be considered to be released as well. Speaking from someone who has a loved \none currently incarcerated at Souza Baranowski Correctional Center, it has been reported that \nthere is barely any soap, no cleaning products, no hand sanitizer and they have not been educated \non the virus. They suffer inhumane abuse on a daily basis and now must fight for their lives \nduring a pandemic. Employees are in and out of the prisons all day every day. This can bring in \nthe virus EASILY. Many people are asymptomatic so we cannot assume the incarcerated are safe \nat all, they are equally at risk as us on the outside living in the communities here in MA, if not \nMORE at risk because they do not have proper medical care like we do in our communities. \nThese men and women are LOVED, have families and friends who would GLADLY take them \nin to ensure their safety. I know I would definitely help, I would have my boyfriend live with me \nand I absolutely would let his cellmate move in too, no questions asked! The incarcerated \npopulation deserve a chance to fight this virus too, they are humans just like everyone else. They \nhave rights too. These rights are being violated. Their punishment is living behind bars, not to be \ntrapped, UNPROTECTED AND NEGLECTED from a pandemic and a deadly virus currently \nwith no cure. We should stand together as communities, as a state and as a country to protect \neveryone.” - Jamie R, Suffolk County \n“Humans should always be treated as such, prisons in 2020 show many resemblances to \nconcentration camps and immigration detention centers.” - Jamar Cokley \n20 \n\n“Underlying health issues, a weakened immunity and is highly vulnerable to COVID-19. This \nalso places other incarcerated people, correctional officers and essential staff at risk, which may \nalso impact their micro, mezzo and macro environments. Not only is my neighbor at risk, but not \nreleasing vulnerable incarcerated individuals may increase the risk for the broader community. \nFailure to take unprecedented action may result in an increased rate of disease and fatalities.” - \nVanessa Silva, Suffolk County \n“Many incarcerated people have loved ones who have passed but many more have loved ones \nwaiting on their release.” - WH \n“Love is here waiting for you. See you soon.” - ES, Suffolk County \n“Rehabilitation not incarceration.” - Joseph Lawrence Bushfan, Suffolk County \n“Prisons should not exist in their current conditions. No one should live under the conditions of \nAmerican prison.” - Rafael Feliciano Cumbas, Esq., Suffolk County \n“Hello good afternoon. I am writing to you the importance of having my husband released from \nprison as well as other men. You see this COVID-19 spreads like wildfire. My suggestion is to \nrelease the elderly and sick in the inmates that qualify for release under the juvenile law and also \nthose that are waiting to walk out the door they have a date set. I wish we could release all of \nthem to go home with their family. But I think the men That have served their time in above \nthose who are sick and don’t have many years left and those that have a date and I just sitting \nwaiting for the day to come. Thank you.” - Erica F., Bristol County \n“Even your worst mistake doesn’t define you as a person. These PEOPLE have been locked in \ncells stripped of most of their rights and all they want to do is see their loved ones and the light \n21 \n\nof day again. Think if it was you would you want to be thrown out like a dog and forgotten \nabout, or would you want a second chance to prove people can change?” - Prince N., Suffolk \nCounty \n“Please consider all inmates' health. This coronavirus is very serious and we do not know the \noutcome of this situation. It has to be challenging for inmates that cannot receive any visits and \nare limited on phone calls to ponder over this issue thank you.” - Neco S Lassiter \n“Support the release of our loved ones and the elderly.” - Rhonda Laronal, Plymouth County \n“Free the jails.” - DFT, Suffolk County \n“Have Mercy, this C. Virus is so deadly, spreading so affecting our family my son, an inmate in \ndanger, along with many others whose family members are extremely concerned. We are \nsubmitting order to the Government to guarantee to us families that they have the utmost health \nbenefits and care.” - Josephine Pina U.S., Suffolk County  \n“I don't understand why people are so quick to Judge there are many many families that support \ntheir loved ones. Some need to stop being so heartless it's absolutely disgusting!!!!” - Theresa, \nBristol County \n“This moment of crisis necessitates that we recognize the humanity of incarcerated people. They \nare not forgotten; we love them and we need them home. In “regular”‘ times incarcerated people \nin MA are not getting the medical care and hygienic products they need. Why should we expect \nMA DOC to use this moment to do right by our people? Not only have they have failed us, but \nthey intentionally harm people we love. The community is here to welcome them with open arms \nand we’re begging to be heard.

Approximately what percentage of inmates or detainees sleeps within six feet of \nanother inmate or detainee? Individuals in disciplinary isolation should be excluded \nfrom this estimate. \nMain Institution:  0% sleeps within six feet of one another. (100% arc able to sleep \nsix feet or more apart utilizing in some units, head to toe positioning consistent with \nCenter for Disease Control Guidelines (CDC)).  Additionally, with respect to the \nbunk beds all arc separated by a steel barrier with no holes. \nWomen's' Facility: 0% sleeps within six feet of one another. (100% with head to \ntoe positioning based on Center for Disease Control Guidelines (CDC)). \n\nAdditionally, with respect to the bunk beds all arc separated by a steel barrier with \nno holes. \nWestern Massachusetts Regional Recovery and Wellness Center:  0% sleeps within \n6 feet of one another.  (100°/o with head to toe positioning based on Center for \nDisease Control Guidelines (CDC)). \nPre-Release Center: 0 % sleeps within six feet of one another.  (100% with head to \ntoe positioning based on Center for Disease Control Guidelines (CDC)). \n2. Approximately what percentage of inmates or detainees cat meals within six feet \nof another inmate or detainee? \nMain Institution:  100% of our population is able to cat at approximately 5 Vz feet \napart based on the size of the tables we currently have.  We would be able to spread \nindividuals apart further if they were not required to cat at tables, but that would \nrequire us to obtain a waiver as it is required under the CMR's that our populations \ncat at tables. \nWomen's' facility:  0%, cat within six feet of one another. \nWestern Massachusetts Regional Recovery and Wcllncss Center:  0% cat within six \nfeet of one another. \nPre-Release Center: 0% cat within six feet of one another. \n3. Approximately what percentage of inmates or detainees are permitted to be \nwithin six feet of each other during recreation periods? \nIt is difficult to say what percentage is permitted to be within six fcctof one another \nduring recreation period.  However, 100% of our populations at all facilities have \nthe option to social distance at 6 feet apart during recreation.  100% of our \npopulations at all facilities have been educated about the importance of social \ndistancing. However, some choose not to social distance during recreation, and arc \nreminded about the risks involved.  Additionally, ALL individuals in our \npopulations MUST wear a mask anytime they are out of their cells and during \nrecreation time. \n--1-m!rcsa Finnegan \nGeneral Counsel ",

And the Chief \nJustice of the Trial Court, the Department of \nCorrection (“DOC”), the Parole Board, the Probation \nService (“Probation”), and the Attorney General \n(collectively, the “Respondents”) are committed to \ntaking all necessary and appropriate steps to protect \nthe health and welfare of all Massachusetts residents.  \nTo that end, the Respondents, along with other \nstakeholders, have developed and implemented \nextraordinary measures in response to the pandemic \nthat are designed to protect everyone within the \ncriminal justice system, as well as the public at \nlarge. \nHowever, the situation is rapidly evolving, and \nthe Respondents recognize that additional measures may \nbe needed in the coming days and weeks, including with \nrespect to the uniquely challenging circumstances \nfaced by incarcerated persons1 and those who work with \nthem.  The Respondents agree that this Court is \nuniquely situated to potentially implement measures \n \n1 This brief uses the term “detainee” to refer to \na person held in custody on the basis of a judicial \norder in a criminal case other than a final judgment \n(i.e., sentence).  It uses the term “inmate” to refer \nto a person held in custody on a final judgment in a \ncriminal case. \n4 \n\n \nthat may afford immediate and necessary relief, and \nagree that exercise of this Court’s superintendence \nauthority over the lower courts under G.L. c. 211, § \n3, may be appropriate in some of these circumstances. \nIn what follows, the Respondents first outline \nsome of the measures that they have already put in \nplace in response to the pandemic.  See pp. 5-18 \nbelow.  The Respondents then offer several principles \nthat, in their view, should guide any relief ordered \nby this Court.  See pp. 18-25 below.  The Respondents \nlook forward to working cooperatively with the \npetitioners, the Special Master, and this Court to \nimplement measures designed to advance our common \ngoals of protecting the public health and public \nsafety. \nSTATEMENT OF THE FACTS \nThe Various Trial Courts’ Response to COVID-19 \nAs this Court is aware, all of the trial courts \nhave issued new standing orders in response to this \nCourt’s orders regarding COVID-19; the details of \nthose standing orders need not be reviewed here (they \nare available at https://www.mass.gov/guides/court-\nsystem-response-to-covid-19#-court-orders).  Submitted \nherewith are affidavits from the Chief Justices of the \nSuperior Court (Hon. Judith Fabricant), the District \nCourt (Hon. Paul C. Dawley), the Boston Municipal \n5 \n\n \nCourt (Hon. Roberto Ronquillo, Jr.), and the Juvenile \nCourt (Hon. Amy Nechtem), each of which sets forth \nadditional details regarding each court’s response to \nthe COVID-19 crisis. \nEach of these courts has designated motions \nseeking relief from confinement as a result of COVID-\n19 as emergency matters to be handled on an expedited \nbasis.  See Fabricant Aff. ¶ 4; Dawley Aff. ¶¶ 4, 7-9; \nRonquillo Aff. ¶ 4; Nechtem Aff. ¶¶ 4-5, 8.  Such \nmotions may be heard via telephone or videoconference, \nand in many cases may be decided on the papers.  See \nFabricant Aff. ¶¶ 5, 9; Dawley Aff. ¶ 7; Ronquillo \nAff. ¶ 4; Nechtem Aff. ¶ 5.  When evaluating such \nmotions, the courts are expressly considering the \nCOVID-19 pandemic.  See Fabricant Aff. ¶ 12; Dawley \nAff. ¶ 11 (“I reminded judges that, in setting bail or \ndeciding whether to detain someone pursuant to G.L. c. \n276, § 58A, they should be considering the impact of \nthe COVID-19 virus along with all of the other factors \nthat go into making those determinations.”).  And each \nof these trial courts has put in place emergency \nmeasures designed to ensure that, even when \ncourthouses are closed to non-emergency business--or, \nin the case of positive COVID-19 tests within the \ncourthouse, closed completely--judges and clerks \nremain available by telephone and email to ensure that \nemergency matters are dealt with expeditiously.  See \n6 \n\n \nFabricant Aff. ¶ 7; Dawley Aff. ¶ 10; Ronquillo Aff. ¶ \n5; Nechtem Aff. ¶ 6.  None of the Chief Justices is \naware of any complaints of delay with respect to \nmotions of this kind.  See Fabricant Aff. ¶ 9; Dawley \nAff. ¶ 12; Ronquillo Aff. ¶ 11; Nechtem ¶ 9. \nFrom March 14, 2020 through March 26, 2020, the \nSuperior Court conducted 20 arraignments.  Fabricant \nAff. ¶ 13.  In this same period the Superior Court \nalso heard approximately 100 motions seeking release \nfrom confinement, and 118 petitions for review of bail \nand detention orders based on dangerousness issued in \nthe District or Boston Municipal Court.  Id. ¶¶ 8, 12 \n& Attachment 2.  Details regarding the disposition of \nthe 100 motions seeking release are set forth in \nAttachment 2 to Chief Justice Fabricant’s affidavit. \nFrom March 16, 2020 through March 27, 2020, the \nBoston Municipal Court conducted approximately 94 new \narraignments, and received approximately 53 motions \nseeking immediate release or to reconsider bail.  \nRonquillo Aff. ¶¶ 12-13.   \nFrom March 14, 2020 through March 25, 2020, the \nJuvenile Court conducted 15 arraignments.  Nechtem \nAff. ¶ 10.  Of those, the youths were released in 8 \ncases, held on bail in 4 cases, and held as dangerous \npursuant to G.L. c. 276, § 58A in 3 cases.  Id.  The \nJuvenile Court also received at least 25 petitions for \nbail reduction or release (information was not \n7 \n\n \nimmediately available from two counties), of which 10 \nwere granted, 5 were denied, and 10 remain pending.  \nId. ¶ 11. \nThe Probation Service’s Response to COVID-19 \nUnderstanding the gravity of the COVID-19 health \ncrisis, Probation has implemented, and is in the \nprocess of implementing, a variety of steps to reduce \nthe risk of infection for probationers. \nA.  The Probation Service Has Dramatically \nReduced the Need for In-Person Contact In \nIts Supervision Activities. \nProbation has taken steps to significantly reduce \nthe number of probationers arrested or brought into \ncourt through probation violation notices.  Although \nProbation continues to issue notices of violation when \na probationer is charged with a new criminal offense, \nits staff has been instructed for all other alleged \nviolations of probation to file violation notices only \nwhen “the matter is emergency in nature or poses a \nclear and present danger to victims, the public, or \nthe individual probationer.”  Affidavit of \nCommissioner of Probation Edward Dolan ¶ 10.  \nProbation staff has been similarly instructed not to \nrequest warrants except in emergency situations, or \nwhere there exists a clear and present danger.  See \nid. \n8 \n\n \nProbation has significantly changed its \nsupervision practices, and is currently requesting \nthat supervised probationers only come into court to \nmeet in emergency situations.  See id. ¶ 12.  \nCommunity Corrections Centers are conducting \nsupervision meetings by phone, and will soon offer \nclasses and at least some therapy groups remotely, but \nare not penalizing any probationer who is unable to \naccess online resources.  Id. ¶¶ 18-19.  Indeed, if a \nprobationer is unable to comply with any condition of \nprobation due to the current situation, Probation will \nnot file a violation notice, but will instead “record \nin the supervision notes which specific conditions \ncannot be complied with and the reasons therefor.”  \nId. ¶ 20. \nProbation is continuing to fulfill its role in \nsupporting supervisees by assisting them with \naccessing vital benefits such as enhanced unemployment \nresources as well as basic needs including health \ninformation, food, shelter, and clothing.  See id. ¶¶ \n12, 36. \nB.  The Probation Service Has Adopted Special \nPrecautions for Those Supervision Activities \nthat Do Require In-Person Contact. \nProbation has made substantial efforts to \nminimize risk to probationers where a condition of \nprobation requires in-person contact.  Probation \n9 \n\n \nofficers and Community Corrections Centers have ceased \nconducting onsite drug tests, as of March 16, 2020.  \nId. ¶¶ 13.  Drug testing conducted by Probation’s \nvendor, Averhealth, has continued in modified fashion \nto accommodate social distancing recommendations.  See \nid. ¶¶ 13-24.  Currently, at Averhealth, probationers \nare called to be tested during a two-hour block of \ntime, with no greater than ten individuals in each \nblock.  Id. ¶ 14.  Extra staff at each location ensure \nfrequent cleaning of the space, and management of any \nline that may form.  Id.  Probationers may not enter \nif they are not feeling well, have a temperature, or \nhave recently traveled internationally.  Id.  At most \nlocations, Averhealth plans to soon introduce a \nfeature which will allow probationers to text staff \nupon arrival at the facility, but wait in a car or \nother location until they are called in to provide a \nsample.  Id. ¶ 16. \nThe Department of Correction’s Response to COVID-19 \nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the DOC has \nremained focused on the health and safety of its \ninmates and staff, and has updated its plans and \nprocedures frequently to reflect the rapid changes in \nthe public health situation.  Affidavit of \nCommissioner of Correction Carol Mici ¶¶ 2, 5. \n10 \n\n \nA.  Every DOC Institution Is Under Capacity. \nAs of March 23, 2020, the DOC houses 7,916 \ninmates in its facilities, including 7,364 in general \npopulation; this means that the DOC is running at 73% \nof its operational occupancy of 10,157 general \ninmates.  Id. ¶ 86 & Exh. 9.  The occupancies of \nindividual DOC facilities range between 31% and 95%, \nbut none equals or exceeds full capacity.  Id. \nB.  In accordance with CDC Guidance, the DOC Has \nProactively Sought to Limit Inmates’ \nOpportunities for In-Person Contact with DOC \nStaff and Outsiders, and with Each Other. \nBeginning during the week of March 9, and \ncontinuing through the present, the DOC has taken \nsteps to limit the risk of the spread of COVID-19 \nwithin its facilities.  These steps have included: \n  Advising staff and inmates, in accordance with \nCenters for Disease Control (“CDC”) and \nMassachusetts Department of Public Health (“DPH”) \nguidance, about ways to prevent infection, Id. ¶¶ \n25-28 & Exhs. 1-5; \n  Restricting transfers between correctional \nfacilities,2 id. ¶ 29; \n  Instructing institution superintendents on \npractices to implement social distancing and \nreduce crowding in chow halls, gym activities, \noutdoor exercise periods, libraries, and \nclassrooms, id. ¶ 31; \n \n2 In addition, the slowdown in judicial business \nhas substantially reduced the need to transport DOC \ninmates to trial courts, where they might be \ntemporarily held in lockups with exposure to prisoners \nfrom other institutions. \n11 \n\n \n  Limiting the number of inmates able to be out of \ncells and on tiers, id.; \n  Providing inmates with bar soap at no charge, id. \n¶ 54, 56; \n  Providing all housing units with pump containers \nof isopropanol-based hand sanitizer, id. ¶ 55; \n  Suspending all general visits at all facilities, \nid. ¶ 34; and \n  With the assistance of the National Guard, \nrequiring every person who enters a DOC facility \nto pass an enhanced entrance screening that \nconsists of a series of health-related questions \nand a temperature check (persons with a fever \nabove 99.9 degrees Fahrenheit are not permitted \nto enter), id. ¶¶ 38-49 & Exh. 8. \nIn addition, DOC employees who have direct contact \nwith inmates have received masks and gloves, which are \nbeing worn.  Id. ¶ 30.  These measures and others have \nimplemented most of the recommendations contained in \nthe CDC’s March 23, 2020, “Interim Guidance on \nManagement of [COVID-19] in Correctional and Detention \nFacilities.”3  Id. ¶ 29. \nC.  The DOC Has Procured Extensive Hygienic \nSupplies for Its Inmates and Staff. \nThe DOC’s efforts to combat the spread of COVID-\n19 are well-supplied.  The DOC currently has on hand \nsome 4,338 face masks, 5,000 pairs of polypropylene \ncoveralls, 328 half-gallon containers of isopropanol-\nbased hand sanitizers, 158,000 bars of soap, and \n \n3 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/downloads/guidance-correctional-detention.pdf  \n12 \n\n \nnearly one million pairs of gloves.  Id. ¶¶ 30, 55, \n57.  In addition, the DOC’s Industries Division has \nitself produced some 2,500 individual bottles of hand \nsanitizer.  Id. ¶ 30. \nD.  The DOC Has Expanded Its Medical Services In \nResponse to COVID-19. \nIn addition, the DOC’s contract medical provider, \nWellPath, has implemented multiple COVID-19 procedures \nand protocols within DOC facilities, including but not \nlimited to:   \n  A COVID-19 screening and triage process, \nincluding screening questions and temperature \nchecks; \n  Collection of diagnostic respiratory specimens \nfrom patients;  \n  Identification and monitoring of patients both \nconfirmed and unconfirmed for COVID-19;  \n  Tracking of all patients tested for COVID-19;  \n  Mask fit testing and distribution to staff;  \n  Education for patients and staff regarding COVID-\n19 mode of transmission, standard precautions, \nhand washing, social distancing, and \nhousekeeping/cleaning;  \n  Identification of patients who are at high risk;  \n  Proper use of personal protective equipment; and  \n  Cancellation of non-essential and elective \nprocedures for off site appointments.  \nId. ¶ 32.  Medical providers meet with inmates who \npresent with symptoms consistent with a viral illness.  \n13 \n\n \nId.  Inmates who are symptomatic undergo a quarantine \nprotocol, receiving meals and full medical care within \ntheir rooms.  Id. \nIn the meantime, the DOC has continued to \nexercise its responsibility for petitions for medical \nparole, working with inmates and other stakeholders to \ncreate medical parole plans and to identify potential \nplacements for inmates who are medically paroled.  Id. \n¶¶ 66-81.  Medical parole, however, is limited by the \navailability of placements in nursing homes and other \nfacilities.  Id. ¶ 80. \nThe Parole Board’s Response to COVID-19 \nThe Parole Board continues to supervise parolees \nand hold parole hearings in most cases, with \nalterations of its practices to avoid aggravated risk \nof COVID-19 infection for parolees and prospective \nparolees. \nPrior to any parole hearing, an institutional \nparole officer must conduct a “risk/needs” assessment.  \nAffidavit of Parole Board Chair Gloriann Moroney ¶ 6.  \nDuring the COVID-19 health crisis, parole officers \nhave been instructed to conduct such assessments using \nalternate means, to avoid in-person conduct, including \nby use of videoconferencing and contactless visitation \nrooms.  Id.  Similarly, beginning on March 19, 2020, \nall parole hearings for inmates sentenced to state \n14 \n\n \nprison for terms other than life have taken place by \nvideoconference.  Id. ¶ 8.  At the Houses of \nCorrection, no in-person parole hearings have taken \nplace since March 23, but the Parole Board is \ncurrently in the process of resolving technological \ncompatibility issues in order to conduct parole \nhearings by videoconference for these inmates.  Id. ¶ \n9.  As of March 26, parole hearings have been taking \nplace by videoconference at the Barnstable House of \nCorrection. Id. \nCurrently, parole hearings for inmates serving \nlife sentences have been suspended, because they are \nopen to the public and frequently involve multiple \nwitnesses and spectators.  Id. ¶ 11.  Any such \nhearings that must be postponed due to the COVID-19 \ncrisis will be re-scheduled and placed on a priority \nlist.  Id.  \nMedical parole cases have additionally been \naffected by COVID-19, as the “availability of medical \nfacilities and nursing homes capable of accepting new \npatients has been severely limited.”  Id. ¶ 16.  \nTewksbury State Hospital, for example, has determined \nthat it will not be accepting any medical parole cases \nduring the pandemic.  Id. \nIn response to COVID-19, the Parole Board has \nchanged its policy regarding parole violations: Since \nMarch 16, an additional review process has been \n15 \n\n \nrequired before an officer seeks a detainer.  Id. ¶ \n15.  To seek a detainer, a field officer must consult \nwith his/her supervisor, who must review the matter \nwith the Deputy Chief of Field Services to determine \nif there is a safe alternative to seeking a detainer.  \nId. \nPrisoner Re-Entry and Public Health In the Time of \nCOVID-19 \nThe DPH has emphatically advised that every \nindividual in Massachusetts, whether incarcerated or \nnot, is at risk of contracting COVID-19.  See \nAffidavit of Deputy Secretary of the Executive Office \nof Health and Human Services Daniel Tsai ¶ 5.  Thus, a \nprisoner’s re-entry into society is relevant to the \nissues raised by the petition. \nA.  Re-Entry Typically Is a Thoughtful Process \nthat Is Closely Managed to Promote a \nPositive Outcome for All Involved. \nFor DOC inmates, the process of planning for an \ninmate’s re-entry begins one year prior to his/her \nrelease date.  Mici Aff. ¶ 81A.  That process \naddresses needs such as housing, identity documents, \nhealth care, employment plans, wrap-around resources \nin the community, and eligibility for benefits (e.g., \nVA compensation, SSI/SSDI).  Id. ¶¶ 81A-82.  Prior to \nCOVID-19, the DOC released, on average, 22% of inmates \nto sober or residential recovery homes.  Id. ¶ 84. \n16 \n\n \nB.  Unplanned Re-Entries May, in Some Instances, \nExacerbate the Risks to Public Health and \nthe Individual’s Own Well-Being. \nThe public health is very much concerned with the \nsupport systems that are in place, prior to release, \nto address a re-entering prisoner’s specific needs and \nrisks.  Tsai Aff. ¶ 6. \nMany of the support systems that typically \naddress those needs and risks are already burdened by \nthe COVID-19 pandemic.  Id.  For example, the \nCommonwealth’s homeless shelter system is at capacity, \nand faces challenges of staffing, potential closures, \nand reorganization in the face of guidelines for \nsocial distancing.  Id. ¶ 7(a).  Similarly, the \nCommonwealth’s system of behavioral and mental health \nservices, including the Department of Mental Health \nsystem and substance abuse services, is already \nstretched thin, with many mental health outpatient \nclinics lacking capacity for new intakes and largely \nclosed to in-person visits.  Id. ¶ 9(a).  And, \nalthough MassHealth continues to accept new \nenrollments, COVID-19 has required that they be done \non-line or by telephone, as walk-in enrollment is \nsuspended.  Id. ¶ 10(b).  An individual’s lack of \nhealth insurance would negatively interfere with \nhis/her ability to access preventative and urgent \nphysical health care, and would likely lead him/her to \nseek medical services through an emergency department.  \n17 \n\n \nId. ¶ 10(a).  A released individual who cannot obtain \nservices such as these may incur additional risks to \nhim/herself and present additional risks to the public \nhealth.  Id. ¶¶ 7, 9, 10. \nDISCUSSION \nIn responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, this \nCourt should act both quickly and thoughtfully.  It \nshould strike a balance that serves the general public \nhealth, the general public safety, and the well-being \nof individual participants in the criminal justice \nsystem, while minimizing harmful unintended \nconsequences.  Accordingly, the Respondents \nrespectfully submit that any relief ordered by this \nCourt should be guided by the following principles.4 \nA.  Any Relief Should Promote Public Health \nWithin Correctional Institutions. \nDetention and correctional institutions present \nunique COVID-19-related challenges due to their \ncommunal setting, the need for interaction between \nprisoners and staff, prisoners’ relative lack of \n \n4 The Respondents agree with the petitioners that \na novel infectious disease such as COVID-19 within a \ndetention or correctional facility is an event that \ncarries potential constitutional ramifications.  \nHowever, the Respondents do not understand the \npetitioners to be raising any constitutional claim at \nthis time, and therefore do not discuss such issues in \nthis filing.  The Respondents do not waive any rights \nwith respect to any such constitutional issues and are \nprepared to brief those issues at the Court’s request. \n18 \n\n \nautonomy, and other factors.  Institutions should have \nin place policies and procedures that protect all \npersons present, and comport with guidance and \nrecommendations made by experts regarding best \npractices for accomplishing that within the confines \nof a corrections setting. \nFurther, because the population of an institution \nis itself a risk factor, this Court could explore \nsteps to reduce that population, mindful of the other \nprinciples discussed herein pertaining to the general \npublic health and public safety, individualized review \nof cases, and temporary nature of relief.  First, the \nflow of new detainees into correctional institutions \nshould be minimized to the extent possible.  Second, \nthis Court could issue guidelines to the trial courts \nfor certain categories of pretrial detainees who are \nlikely to be eligible for some form of release in the \npresent circumstances; such categories could include: \n(1) persons charged with low-level, non-violent \noffenses; and (2) those especially vulnerable to \nCOVID-19, such as the aged and those with preexisting \nmedical conditions.  Third, the Court should explore, \nin conformance with and within the bounds of \napplicable constitutional principles, statutes, \nregulations, and rules, expedited relief for those \nserving committed sentences who are similarly \nvulnerable to COVID-19 infection.  Such mechanisms \n19 \n\n \nmight include existing procedures around medical \nparole (G.L. c. 127, §119A) and/or educational release \n(G.L. c. 127, §§ 49-49A), or judicial action to expand \nan inmate’s ability to bring a motion in court to \nrevise, revoke, or modify his/her sentence under \nMassachusetts Rule of Criminal Procedure 29. \nB.  Any Relief Should Promote Public Health in \nProbation, Parole, and Pretrial Settings. \nProbationers and parolees should not be required \nto aggravate their risk of infection in order to \nfulfill the conditions of their release.  Thus, where \nfeasible, during this time, conditions of probation, \nparole, or pretrial release requiring interactions \nthat would violate current advisories issued by the \nMassachusetts Department of Public Health should be \nadapted to avoid the need for such interactions.  \nIndeed, many such adaptations are already taking \nplace.  For example, mandated supervision meetings \nwith staff at Community Corrections Centers are \ncurrently taking place by telephone, and certain \ntherapy groups and classes will shortly be available \nonline.  See Dolan Aff. ¶¶ 17-19.  Where a condition \ncannot be adapted to avoid in-person interactions, \nenforcement of the relevant condition should be \nsuspended during the COVID-19 crisis.  Id. ¶ 20.  As \nis the current practice, probation notices and \nwarrants for so-called “technical” violations--which \n20 \n\n \ninclude all violations in which the probationer is not \ncharged with a new offense, see id. ¶ 5--should only \nbe issued “when the matter is emergency in nature or \nposes a clear and present danger to victims, the \npublic, or the individual probationer.”  Id. ¶ 10. \nC.  Any Relief Should Promote The General Public \nHealth. \nRelief should be designed to minimize any harmful \nunintended consequences to the general public health.  \nFor example, an individual released without plans for \nhousing and social support may not be able to engage \nin the social distancing, quarantine, and hygienic \npractices recommended by public health experts.  Tsai \nAff. ¶¶ 7, 9-10.  Any relief ordered by this Court \nshould be mindful of its impact on shelters, emergency \nrooms, and other social services.  Cf. id. ¶¶ 6-10.  \nThe individual’s circumstances will be relevant here. \nRelatedly, any detainee released during this time \nshould receive information about the public health, \nincluding facts about COVID-19, current prevention \nguidelines, and a list of resources for medical care \nand other needs.  A detainee who has tested positive, \nor been deemed presumptively positive, for COVID-19 \nshould not be released into the community without \nadequate provision for quarantine and medical care.  \nAnd Respondents agree with petitioners that detainees \neligible for release pursuant to any relief granted in \n21 \n\n \nthis case, but who wish to remain in the facility, \nshould be allowed to do so.  See Pet. at 26 n.44. \nD.  Any Relief Should Protect the General Public \nSafety and Support the Rights of Victims. \nEnsuring the public safety is a foundational \npurpose of the criminal justice system, even in times \nof crisis.  Accordingly, as discussed above, any \nguidance from this Court regarding release should \nfocus on those pretrial detainees accused of non-\nviolent offenses.  Dangerous and violent individuals--\nincluding those charged with violent offenses, such as \ndomestic violence or sexual assault offenses, and \nthose held as dangerous under G.L. c. 276, § 58A--\nshould remain incarcerated.5 \nAlso integral to the public safety are the \ninterests of crime victims, including compliance with \nG.L. c. 258B.  Victims must be notified of the release \nof a detainee to the extent required by statute, and \n \n5 Petitioners’ suggestion that only the crimes \nenumerated in chapter 265 of the General Laws are \nviolent or serious, see Pet. at 16-17, 30, is unsound.  \nTo the contrary, many serious offenses are not \ncontained within chapter 265.  These include hostage \ntaking by a prisoner (G.L. c. 127, § 38A), arson-\nrelated offenses (G.L. c. 266, §§ 1-5A), burglary \n(G.L. c. 266, § 14), illegal possession of firearms \nand other dangerous weapons (G.L. c. 269, § 10), \nviolation of a restraining order (G.L. c. 209A, § 7), \nand the creation, possession, and dissemination of \nchild pornography (G.L. c. 272, §§ 29A-29C). \nPersons adjudicated as sexually dangerous under \nG.L. c. 123A also should remain incarcerated. \n22 \n\n \nevery effort should be made to notify them as early as \npossible, so that they may have the opportunity to \nmake informed decisions, plan for safety, and prepare \nemotionally.  See G.L. c. 258B, § 3(t) (victims \nentitled to be informed in advance of offender’s \n“temporary, provisional or final” release from \ncustody).  Notifications of detainee releases should \nalso be made to local law enforcement, to ensure they \nare prepared to respond to any community difficulties. \nE.  Any Relief Should Provide Opportunities for \nIndividualized Review. \nAny relief should also create the opportunity for \nreview of individual cases.  This principle is \nconsistent with the fundamental underpinnings of our \njustice system.   \nProsecutors--or, where appropriate, probation \nofficers--should be given the opportunity to object to \nthe release of any particular detainee.  And, of \ncourse, those detainees not afforded consideration \nunder any guidelines issued by this Court should \ncontinue to have the opportunity to petition the \ncourts for release, and those requests should be \ndecided promptly, as is the case now.  Cf. Fabricant \nAff. ¶ 9; Dawley Aff. ¶ 9; Ronquillo Aff. ¶ 6; Nechtem \nAff. ¶¶ 4,9.  Both such processes should be conducted \nin an expedited fashion, with clear standards, \n23 \n\n \nreflecting the time-sensitive nature of this \nsituation. \nF.  Any Relief Should Provide Relief Only For \nthe Duration Needed.   \nThe COVID-19 crisis is temporary and, \naccordingly, measures to ameliorate its impact should \nalso be temporary.  Where a warrant, or a condition of \nprobation, parole, or pretrial release, is not to be \nenforced during this time, such warrants or conditions \nshould not be vacated, but rather suspended until the \nCOVID-19 crisis abates.  And, generally, any release \nfrom pretrial detention should be treated as a \ntemporary abatement that may not necessarily continue \nafter the COVID-19 crisis abates.  With respect to \ninmates serving sentences, a judicial order that cuts \nshort a sentence would be an effective commutation, \nraising separation of powers problems by intruding on \nthe constitutional prerogatives and statutory \nauthorities of the other branches of government. \nRelatedly, any relief ordered by this Court \nshould include mechanisms to keep released detainees \nin contact with the criminal justice system during \ntheir release, in order to facilitate an orderly \nreturn after the COVID-19 crisis abates.  For example, \na pretrial detainee should, prior to any release, be \nrequired to provide contact information and should \nreceive formal notice of his/her next court date and \n24 \n\n \nany conditions on release, such as “no contact” or \nstay-away orders.  Such mechanisms will help to ensure \nthe continuity and orderly operation of the criminal \njustice system both during and after the COVID-19 \ncrisis.  The provisions of G.L. c. 127, § 90A, and 103 \nC.M.R. § 463.00 et seq. (furlough) and G.L. c. 127, § \n49 (participation of inmates in outside educational \nprograms), although not directly applicable, may \nprovide guidance in creating guidelines and structures \non this score. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should act \nin accordance with the principles described above and \nany agreement the parties may reach. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nMAURA HEALEY \nATTORNEY GENERAL \n \n   /s/ Eric A.

The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has created \nenormous challenges for every aspect of our communities.  While \nscientists are racing to discover whether any existing drugs can \nhelp to treat the virus and improve outcomes for critically ill \npatients, and others are working at top speed to develop a \nvaccine, currently there is no cure and no vaccine.  Health care \nworkers on the frontlines of the epidemic are coming down with \nthe virus in much higher percentages than others, while surgical \nmasks and other basic protective equipment are in short supply, \nand hospitals with already close-to-capacity intensive care unit \nbeds confront the possibility of inadequate resources to care \nfor critically ill patients, such as lack of needed ventilators.  \nEveryday life is heavily disrupted; most businesses, schools, \nand houses of worship are closed,3 while grocers, pharmacies, and \ndelivery services stretch to provide essential services to meet \nbasic needs, and families without paychecks worry about how to \nmeet those needs.  The Centers For Disease Control (CDC) \nguidelines recommend that, to avoid exposure, individuals limit \ncontact with others, maintain a distance of at least six feet \nfrom other individuals if they are together, engage in frequent \n                     \n  3 See Order Extending the Closure of Certain Workplaces and \nthe Prohibition of Gatherings of More than 10 People, COVID-19 \nOrder 21 (Mar. 31, 2020), https://www.mass.gov/doc/march-31-\n2020-essential-services-extension-order [https://perma.cc/SU87-\nGTAV]. \n \n\n4 \n \nhandwashing, and clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces \ndaily in order to \"flatten the curve,\" i.e., to reduce the \nnumber of cases the beleaguered health care system must treat at \nany one time. \n  On March 10, 2020, the Governor declared a state of \nemergency to support the Commonwealth's response to the threat \nof COVID-19.  On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization \nformally declared the expanding spread of the COVID-19 virus a \nglobal pandemic.  Since then, infections have spread alarmingly, \nrapidly, and at an increasing rate, both in Massachusetts and \nthroughout the world.  In an attempt to mitigate the spread of \nthe disease, the Governor has imposed strict restrictions on \nmany aspects of everyday life, including closing business and \nschools and stringently restricting public and private \ngatherings.  In the week between the filing of this petition and \noral argument, confirmed cases in the Commonwealth increased \nmore than eight-fold, from 777 cases to 6,620 cases.4 \n                     \n  4 Of course, during that same period, the number of people \ntested also has increased exponentially, as more laboratories \nhave begun processing tests.  For example, in one day, March 26, \n2020, 5,570 more tests were processed by the Department of \nPublic Health than had been processed the previous day.  Prior \nto that, between March 23 and 24, the number of residents tested \ndoubled in two days, from 6,004 to 13,749.  According to the \nDepartment of Public Health, more than 46,000 people in the \nCommonwealth had been tested as of March 31, 2020, resulting in \n6,620 positive tests. \n \n\n5 \n \nPursuant to its supervisory authority, this court has \nissued a series of orders with respect to court proceedings, new \nfilings, and trials, designed to \"protect the public health by \nreducing the risk of exposure to the virus and slowing the \nspread of the disease.\"  As the health crisis has deepened, we \nhave been forced to limit physical access to our court houses to \naddress only \"emergency matters that cannot be resolved through \na videoconference or telephonic hearing, either because such a \nhearing is not practicable or because it would be inconsistent \nwith the protections of constitutional rights,\" and have \ndirected each trial court department to issue a standing order \nto determine what constitutes an emergency matter.  Each trial \ncourt department subsequently has done so.   We have emphasized, \nas well, that, \"[i]n criminal cases, where appropriate, a \ndefendant may ask the court for reconsideration of bail or \nconditions of release.\" \nThe petitioners, the Committee for Public Counsel Services \n(CPCS) and the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense \nLawyers (MACDL), bring our focus to the situation with respect \nto COVID-19 confronting individuals who are detained in jails \nand houses of correction pending trial, and individuals who have \nbeen convicted and are serving a sentence of incarceration in \nthe Commonwealth.  To allow the physical separation of \nindividuals recommended by the CDC, the petitioners seek the \n \n\n6 \n \nrelease to the community of as many individuals as possible as \nexpeditiously as possible, indeed, on the day of argument in \nthis case, according to one of them.  They offer a number of \ndifferent legal theories under which a broad-scale release might \nbe accomplished. \nWe conclude that the risks inherent in the COVID-19 \npandemic constitute a changed circumstance within the meaning of \nG. L. c. 276, § 58, tenth par., and the provisions of G. L. \nc. 276, § 557.  To decrease exposure to COVID-19 within \ncorrectional institutions, any individual who is not being held \nwithout bail under G. L. c. 276, § 58A, and who has not been \ncharged with an excluded offense (i.e., a violent or serious \noffense enumerated in Appendix A to this opinion) is entitled to \na rebuttable presumption of release.  The individual shall be \nordered released pending trial on his or her own recognizance, \nwithout surety,6 unless an unreasonable danger to the community \n                     \n  5 The petitioners further request that this court vacate all \nbench warrants and order the trial courts to cease issuing new \nbench warrants; suspend all conditions of probation that would \nviolate the CDC's recommended physical distancing; and vacate \nprobation orders that would require immediate detention.  Based \non the record and the affidavits before us, which suggest that \nactions already are happening to the extent consistent with \npublic safety, we decline to order further relief. \n \n  6 Conditions of release may be imposed, consistent with \ncurrent limitations on probation supervision and global \npositioning system monitoring restrictions. \n \n\n7 \n \nwould result, or the individual presents a very high risk of \nflight. \nThe special master previously appointed by this court in \nconjunction with this case will work at the county level with \neach relevant court to facilitate these hearings.7  The sheriffs \nof each county shall provide the special master daily census \nreports for each correctional institution, and the special \nmaster shall file weekly reports with this court, as detailed in \nAppendix B to this opinion, so that the court will be better \npositioned to respond to further changes in this rapidly-\nevolving situation.  In addition, the Department of Correction \n(DOC) shall furnish the special master daily reports of inmate \ncounts and rates of COVID-19 cases at each facility, as \nexplained in Appendix B. \nWith respect to those individuals who are currently serving \nsentences of incarceration, absent a finding of a constitutional \nviolation, our superintendence power is limited.  Those who have \nbeen serving sentences for less than sixty days may move to have \ntheir sentences revised or revoked under Mass. R. Crim. P. 29, \nas appearing in 474 Mass. 1503 (2016) (Rule 29).  Those who are \n                     \n  7 We acknowledge the extraordinary efforts of the special \nmaster, Brien T. O'Connor, who, together with his colleagues at \nRopes and Gray, LLP, already has worked tirelessly with the \nparties to draft a report and recommendation for our \nconsideration prior to argument in this case. \n \n\n8 \n \npursuing appellate proceedings or a motion for a new trial may \nseek a stay of execution of sentence pursuant to Mass. R. A. P. \n6, as appearing in 481 Mass. 1608 (2019).  See Commonwealth v. \nCharles, 466 Mass. 63, 83 (2013).  Where there is no \nconstitutional violation, however, art. 30 of the Massachusetts \nDeclaration of Rights precludes the judiciary from using its \nauthority under Rule 29 to revise and revoke sentences in a \nmanner that would usurp the authority of the executive branch.  \nRemoving any limitation on the time in which a motion to revise \nand revoke a sentence may be brought, however, would do \nprecisely that.  See Commonwealth v. McCulloch, 450 Mass. 483, \n488 (2008), quoting Commonwealth v. McGuinness, 421 Mass. 472, \n476 n.4 (1995) (\"A judge may not interfere with the executive \nfunction of the parole board by using postconviction evidence in \nan order to revise and revoke\"). \nTo afford relief to as many incarcerated individuals as \npossible, the DOC and the parole board are urged to work with \nthe special master to expedite parole hearings, to expedite the \nissuance of parole permits to those who have been granted \nparole, to determine which individuals nearing completion of \ntheir sentences could be released on time served, and to \nidentify other classes of inmates who might be able to be \n \n\n9 \n \nreleased by agreement of the parties, as well as expediting \npetitions for compassionate release.8 \nAs the petitioners have argued, and the respondents agree, \nif the virus becomes widespread within correctional facilities \nin the Commonwealth, there could be questions of violations of \nthe Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution and art. 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of \nRights; nonetheless, at this time, the petitioners themselves \nclarified in their reply brief and at oral argument that they \nare not raising such claims. \n  1.  Background.  a.  COVID-19 in jails and prisons.  All \nparties agree that, for several reasons, correctional \ninstitutions face unique difficulties in keeping their \npopulations safe during this pandemic.  First, confined, \nenclosed environments increase transmissibility.  Maintaining \nadequate physical distance, i.e., maintaining six feet of \ndistance between oneself and others, may be nearly impossible in \nprisons and jails.  Second, proper sanitation is also a \nchallenge; the petitioners have submitted affidavits from \n                     \n  8 We acknowledge the amicus letters of the Boston chapter of \nBlack and Pink, Joseph Buckman and others, Citizens for Juvenile \nJustice, Dominick Donovan and others, the families of certain \nincarcerated loved ones, Massachusetts Office for Victim \nAssistance, Mental Health Legal Advisors Committee, Prisoners \nLegal Services, certain public health professionals, and Jose \nRivera. \n \n\n10 \n \nDepartment of Public Health (DPH) officials stating that, during \nrecent routine inspections of Massachusetts correctional \ninstitutions (prior to the declaration of emergency), DPH \ninspectors discovered a concerning number of repeat \nenvironmental health violations. \nFinally, while many people who contract COVID-19 are able \nto recover without the need for hospitalization, those who \nbecome seriously ill from the virus may require hospitalization, \nintensive treatment, and ventilator support.  Severe cases are \nmost likely to occur among the elderly and those with underlying \nmedical conditions.  Those in prisons and jails have an \nincreased prevalence, relative to the general population, of \nunderlying conditions that can make the virus more deadly.  The \nDOC and the petitioners agree that hundreds of those \nincarcerated in the Commonwealth suffer from chronic diseases, \nand nearly 1,000 incarcerated individuals are over sixty years \nof age. \nExperts warn that an outbreak in correctional institutions \nhas broader implications for the Commonwealth's collective \nefforts to fight the pandemic.  First, the DOC has limited \ncapacity to offer the sort of specialized medical interventions \nnecessary in a severe case of COVID-19.  Thus, as seriously ill \nindividuals are transferred from correctional institutions to \noutside hospitals, any outbreak in a correctional institution \n \n\n11 \n \nwill further burden the broader health care system that is \nalready at risk of being overwhelmed.  Second, correctional, \nmedical, and other staff enter and leave correctional \ninstitutions every day.  Should there be a high concentration of \ncases, those workers risk bringing infections home to their \nfamilies and broader communities. \n  b.  Response to COVID-19 by courts and correctional \ninstitutions.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and \npursuant to orders of this court, the Superior Courts, the \nDistrict Courts, the Boston Municipal Court, and the Juvenile \nCourts remain open for in-person proceedings only for emergency \nmatters that cannot be resolved remotely.9  The courts are \ndeciding motions related to COVID-19, including motions for \nrelease and motions for bail reduction, via remote hearings or \nbased on the pleadings and without argument.10 \n                     \n  9 See Superior Court Standing Order 3-20 (Mar. 17, 2020); \nDistrict Court Standing Order 2-20 (Mar. 18, 2020); Boston \nMunicipal Court Standing Order 3-20; Juvenile Court Standing \nOrder 3-20 (Mar. 25, 2020).  These emergency matters include \narraignments. \n \n  10 The Superior Court has reported to this court that, as of \nMarch 25, 2020, fifty-one such motions were pending, twenty-\neight were denied, and nineteen were allowed in part or in full.  \nThe Juvenile Court received twenty-five motions for release or \nbail reduction between March 14 and March 25.  As of March 27, \n2020, ten had been allowed, five had been denied, and ten were \npending. \n \n\n12 \n \n  c.  Commonwealth's response to COVID-19 crisis.  The \ndistrict attorneys have taken various proactive steps in \nresponse to COVID-19 to reduce the incarcerated population.  The \ndistrict attorneys for the Suffolk, northern, and northwestern \ndistricts have sought to identify detainees and inmates whom \nthey believe would be appropriate for release.  The district \nattorney for the Berkshire district notes that her office has \nsought unsuccessfully from the sheriff in Berkshire County \ncensus information necessary in order to identify appropriate \ncandidates for release. \n  According to affidavits by the DOC and the various \nsheriffs' offices that operate correctional facilities, they \nhave enacted screening procedures for all individuals entering \nthese facilities.  Employees with symptoms or positive test \nresults are instructed to self-quarantine at home.  New inmates \nand detainees also are screened for symptoms of COVID-19; those \nwithout symptoms are quarantined for fourteen days, and those \nwith symptoms are isolated. \n  Individual correctional institutions also have restricted \naccess to the facility only to essential staff.  General \nvisitation is suspended,11 and transfers among facilities have \n                     \n  11 Most correctional facilities have offered limited free \ntelephone calls as a replacement to visits by family and \nfriends. \n \n\n13 \n \nbeen restricted or completely suspended.  Group programming has \nbeen curtailed, and scheduling changes within facilities have \nbeen enacted to reduce the number of individuals simultaneously \noccupying shared spaces. \n  The availability of hygiene products also has been \nincreased.  The DOC, the Attorney General, and the sheriffs \nreport that bar soap has been made available to all inmates and \ndetainees without charge.  Hand sanitizer has been made \navailable in many locations.  Inmates and detainees have been \ninstructed on techniques to reduce the spread of COVID-19.  \nPersonal protective equipment, including masks, gowns, gloves, \nand goggles, are available to staff in correctional facilities. \n  All facilities are below their maximum capacities, based on \n\"operational capacity\" as designated by the DOC.12  The prison \nsystem as a whole is at seventy-three per cent capacity; the \nmost crowded facility is the North Central Correctional \n                     \n  12 \"Operational capacity\" differs from \"design capacity.\"  \nOperational capacity is based on guidelines issued by the \nAssociation of State Correctional Administrators.  Design \ncapacity is measured by the DOC and reported upon by the \nGovernor quarterly, pursuant to St. 1985, c. 799, § 21.  See, \ne.g., Governor, Quarterly Report on the Status of Prison \nCapacity, Second Quarter 2019 (July 2019), https://archives.lib \n.state.ma.us/bitstream/handle/2452/807941/on1124679772-2019-\n2.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y [https://perma.cc/AL5Z-67QT]. \n \n \n\n14 \n \nInstitution, at ninety-five per cent of capacity.13  Jails and \nhouses of correction are operating, on the whole, at fifty-six \nper cent capacity.14  The Norfolk County house of correction, at \nninety-six per cent occupancy, is the closest to capacity. \n  As of April 1, 2020, there were three correctional \nfacilities with confirmed cases of COVID-19 among inmates; the \nmajority were at the Massachusetts Treatment Center (treatment \ncenter).  Seventeen members of the treatment center's \npopulation, one inmate at another DOC facility, two inmates who \nhad been in close contact at a county jail, and three staff \n                     \n  13 All prisons except the Souza-Baranowski Correctional \nCenter, which houses largely inmates serving life sentences, \ncurrently are operating at above fifty per cent of capacity. \n \n  Occupancy rates in men's prisons are as follows:  \nMassachusetts Correctional Institution (MCI), Cedar Junction \n(maximum security), 64%; Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center, \n41%; Massachusetts Treatment Center, 84%; MCI, Cedar Junction, \n86%; MCI, Concord, 78%; MCI, Norfolk, 85%; MCI, Shirley, 89%; \nNorth Central Correctional Institution, Gardner, 95%; Old Colony \nCorrectional Center (OCCC), 92%; Shattuck Correctional Unit, \n79%; State Hospital at Bridgewater, 74%; Massachusetts Alcohol \nand Substance Abuse Center at Plymouth, 57%; MCI, Shirley \n(minimum security), 84%; OCCC (minimum security), 64%; Boston \nPre-Release, 55%; North Eastern Correctional Center, Concord, \n68%; and Pondville Correctional Center, 78%.  For women's \nprisons, occupancy rates are as follows:  MCI Framingham, 37%; \nand South Middlesex Correctional Center, 31%. \n \n  14 Based on operational capacity, the county houses of \ncorrection have the following rates of occupancy:  Barnstable \nCounty, 38%; Berkshire County, 36%; Bristol County, 55%; Dukes \nCounty, 28%; Essex: County, 77%; Franklin County, 52%; Hampden \nCounty, 51%; Hampshire County, 67%; Middlesex County, 54%; \nNorfolk County, 96%; Plymouth County, 51%; Suffolk County, 50%; \nand Worcester County, 62%. \n \n\n15 \n \nmembers at two other facilities had tested positive; six \nadditional individuals had symptoms of COVID.  Three inmates \nwere at hospitals, and the rest were housed in an isolated unit \nor the health services unit at the treatment center. \n  Correctional facilities report that they have developed \nplans in the event of a wider outbreak within their facilities, \nbased on CDC and DPH guidelines.  At least some of these plans \ncontain contingencies for staffing shortages.  For the most \npart, details on these plans have not been made available in the \nrecord or at argument before this court. \n  d.  COVID-19 response in other jurisdictions.  In response \nto the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of State courts throughout \nthe country have instituted various forms of relief in order to \nreduce the number of incarcerated individuals in their States.  \nThe Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of South Carolina, for \nexample, issued a memorandum to all judges and court staff \ndirecting that \"[a]ny person charged with a non-capital crime \nshall be ordered released pending trial on his own recognizance \nwithout surety, unless an unreasonable danger to the community \nwill result or the accused is an extreme flight risk.\"  The \nSupreme Court of Washington issued an order that, among other \nmeasures, declares that the COVID-19 pandemic shall be presumed \nto be a \"material change in circumstances\" for the purposes of \nsuch motions for bail review if the individual has been \n \n\n16 \n \nidentified as part of a vulnerable or at-risk population by the \nCDC, and that the pandemic may constitute a material change in \ncircumstances and \"new information\" for all others seeking \namendment of a prior bail order.  The order designates as \npriority matters all motions for pretrial release and bail \nmodification, as well as plea hearings and sentencing hearings \nthat will result in the anticipated release of a defendant \nwithin thirty days of the hearing. \n  The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Michigan issued \nan order and further guidance instructing judges to \"take into \ncareful consideration\" the present state of the COVID-19 \nemergency in making pretrial release decisions, including \nsetting bail and conditions of release or probation,.  The Chief \nJustice later issued a statement directing that judges should \nrelease \"far more people on their own recognizance\" and \"should \nuse probation and treatment programs as jail alternatives.\"  The \nstatement called on judges and sheriffs to \"use the statutory \nauthority they have to reduce and suspend jail sentences for \npeople who do not pose a public safety risk,\" and urged that \n\"law enforcement should only arrest people and take them to jail \nif they pose an immediate threat to people in the community.\" \n  The Supreme Court of New Jersey ordered mediation in \nresponse to a petition from the State's Office of the Public \nDefender.  The mediation resulted in a consent order that \n \n\n17 \n \nsuspends or commutes county jail sentences for low-risk inmates \nin light of the public health crisis, unless a State or county \nprosecutor objects to the release of a particular individual.  \nIf there is such an objections, a judge or special master will \nhold a hearing to determine if release would pose a significant \nrisk to the safety of the inmate or the public. \n  2.  Relief sought.  All parties agree that a significant \nCOVID-19 outbreak in Massachusetts correctional institutions \nwould pose considerable risks to those who are incarcerated, \ncorrectional staff, and the broader community.  They disagree \nsignificantly about current conditions in correctional \ninstitutions, whether widespread release for some populations \nwould be more harmful than beneficial, and the proper means by \nwhich to reduce the number of people held in custody, before \ntrial and after conviction. \n  a.  Petitioners' arguments.  The petitioners ask this court \nto use its extraordinary superintendence power under G. L. \nc. 211, § 3, to take a number of unprecedented steps to reduce \nthe number of people held in Massachusetts correctional \nfacilities, both pretrial and postsentence.  These actions, they \ncontend, are necessary practically, to save lives, and legally, \nto prevent what could become substantial and widespread \nviolations of constitutional rights. \n \n\n18 \n \nSpecifically, the petitioners' brief describes potential \nthreats to the rights of those held in State custody to be free \nfrom cruel and unusual punishment, embodied in the Eighth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution, and cruel or \nunusual punishment prohibited by art. 26.  Those provisions \nrequire the Commonwealth to furnish conditions of confinement \nthat do not create an unreasonable risk of future harm to inmate \nhealth and safety, an obligation the petitioners argue is \neffectively impossible to meet under conditions of global \npandemic. \nThe petitioners argue as well that inaction could violate \nrights to due process of law, inscribed in the Fourteenth \nAmendment, and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of \nRights.  For pretrial detainees, the petitioners contend that \nthe risk of infection and death constitutes punishment prior to \nadjudication, which is not reasonably related to a legitimate \ngovernment interest, and therefore is inconsistent with due \nprocess.  For those who have been convicted and sentenced, the \npetitioners argue that due process protections are violated when \nthe deprivations suffered are \"qualitatively different from the \npunishment characteristically suffered by a person convicted of \ncrime.\"  Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 493 (1980).  Because the \nsubstantial threat of infection, serious illness, and death is \nnot part of the sentence imposed on anyone in the Commonwealth, \n \n\n19 \n \nthe petitioners contend that inaction would constitute \nadditional punishment without due process of law. \nIn their reply brief, and at argument before us, the \npetitioners state that they are not raising any constitutional \nclaim at this time, and rather are pointing out the possibility \nof such violations if something is not done to mitigate the \nsituation.  The petitioners ask this court to reduce drastically \n(they suggest by a factor of one-half of the population \ncurrently held in custody) the number of individuals entering \ndetention, held pretrial on unaffordable bail, and serving \nlawful sentences.  They propose specific measures with respect \nto preventing individuals from entering State custody,15 \nreleasing those who are detained prior to trial,16 and reducing \n                     \n  15 To reduce the flow of individuals into the correctional \nsystem, the petitioners ask this court to:  (1) order that risks \nassociated with a COVID-19 outbreak be considered in bail \nhearings, probation revocation hearings, and determinations of \ndangerousness under G. L. c. 276, § 58A; (2) vacate bench \nwarrants related to fines and fees; (3) vacate conditions of \nprobation that automatically trigger probation violation \nproceedings upon an alleged violation; and (4) suspend pretrial \nand probation conditions incompatible with social distancing. \n \n  16 For individuals being detained prior to trial, the \npetitioners seek the release of those held on unaffordable bail; \nheld on a bail revocation for a technical violation of \nprobation; those over sixty years of age; and those who have \nunderlying health conditions that heighten their risk. \n \n \n\n20 \n \nsentences, staying sentences, or paroling certain groups of \nindividuals who are serving a sentence of imprisonment.17 \nTo accomplish this latter set of releases, the petitioners \nsuggest that this court amend Mass. R. Crim. P. 29, which allows \njudges to revise sentences within sixty days of imposition \"if \nit appears that justice might not have been done,\" to eliminate \nthe sixty-day time limit, so that judges, including the single \njustice of this court, thereby lawfully could reduce sentences \ndue to COVID-19.  Alternatively, they ask the court simply to \norder the releases using its purported authority under G. L. \nc. 211, § 3. \n  b.  Respondents' arguments.  While acknowledging the \nserious nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the respondents take \nvarying positions in response to it and the petitioners' \narguments.  To begin, they do not agree as to whether relief \nunder G. L. c. 211, § 3, is appropriate.  The district attorneys \nof the northern, northwestern, Suffolk, and Berkshire districts \n                     \n  17 The petitioners ask this court to order the release of \nthose serving sentences who are (1) eligible for parole and not \nserving a sentence for an offense under G. L. c. 265; (2) set to \nbe released within six months; (3) reincarcerated after \nviolations of parole or probation that did not involve a new \noffense; (4) over sixty years of age and not serving a sentence \nfor an offense defined in G. L. c. 265; (5) suffering from a \npreexisting condition that heightens their risk of death from \nthe virus; (6) eligible for medical parole; or (7) serving \nsentences in a house of correction for offenses other than those \nlisted in G. L. c. 265. \n \n\n21 \n \nagree with the petitioners that the risk of this pandemic is an \nunprecedented, deadly threat to incarcerated individuals, \ncorrectional officers, and civilian staff, and that \nextraordinary action is needed to address this rapidly-growing \npublic health emergency expeditiously.  The Attorney General \nstates that government officials within and outside the \ncorrectional system are committed to taking the steps necessary \nto protect the health and welfare of everyone within the \ncriminal justice system, while acknowledging that the situation \nis rapidly evolving and that extraordinary relief under this \ncourt's superintendence powers may be appropriate in some \ncircumstances. \n  The district attorneys for the Bristol, Cape & Islands, \neastern, Hampden, middle, Norfolk, and Plymouth districts (seven \ndistrict attorneys) state that they \"are committed to taking \nappropriate steps consistent with public safety to mitigate the \nrisks of infection in jails and prisons\" for inmates and \ncorrectional staff, and that \"such measures are already \nunderway.\"  They assert that judges have been advised to take \ninto account, and are doing so, COVID-19 risks in making bail \ndeterminations and deciding issues involving pretrial detention, \ncourt houses are staffed to handle and act upon all emergency \nmotions for release, and correctional officials are acting \n \n\n22 \n \npromptly and allowing \"meritorious petitions for release based \non medical vulnerability.\" \n  The seven district attorneys maintain as well that the \npetitioners' arguments disregard risks to public safety, \nparticularly the physical and mental safety of victims and their \nfamilies, especially victims of domestic violence, in addition \nto abrogating rights granted under the victims' bill of rights \nset forth in G. L. c. 253B.  They contend that immediate release \nof some medically vulnerable individuals could pose a greater \nrisk to the individual than remaining incarcerated with \navailable medical care and treatment.  They point out that \nseventy-three per cent of incarcerated males, and sixty-four per \ncent of incarcerated females are serving a sentence for a \nviolent offense, and that their release into the community, \nparticularly given the reduced levels of supervision currently \navailable, where most supervision is by telephone and not in \nperson, increases risks to the community and could overburden \nalready overworked criminal justice systems. \n  The seven district attorneys also argue that relief under \nG. L. c. 211, § 3, is inappropriate, for several reasons.  They \ncontend that the petitioners have not shown that existing \navenues of relief are inadequate.  See Callahan v. Superior \nCourt Dep't of the Trial Court, 432 Mass. 1023, 1023 (2000).  \nThey argue as well that the relief requested by the petitioners \n \n\n23 \n \nis not available under G. L. c. 211, § 3, because the \npetitioners do not have standing to bring an individual claim \nunder that statute.  See Slama v. Attorney Gen., 384 Mass. 620, \n624 (1981) (\"Representative standing is generally limited to \ncases in which it is difficult or impossible for the actual \nrightholders to assert their claims\").  In addition, they assert \nthat the relief sought by the petitioners would amount to a \nsuspension of laws, in violation of art. 30, and would be an \nattempt to exert this court's superintendence power over the \nexecutive branch, in violation of art. 30.  See Commonwealth v. \nDonohue, 452 Mass. 256, 264 (2008).  They argue as well that the \npetitioners are asking this court impermissibly to abrogate the \nprovisions of numerous statutes on parole, revocation, \ncommutation, compassionate release, and pardons.  Similarly, the \nsheriffs' offices argue that the petitioners cannot obtain \nrelief because they have not exhausted the administrative remedy \nof the grievance processes of the penal institutions.  See G. L. \nc. 127, § 38F; 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). \n  The respondents also disagree on the substantive merits and \nthe putative constitutional claims.  The district attorney for \nthe Suffolk district agrees with the petitioners that COVID-19 \ncreates a situation in which the \"evolving standards of decency \nthat mark the progress of a maturing society\" have been altered \nby COVID-19.  See Michaud v. Sheriff of Essex County, 390 Mass. \n \n\n24 \n \n523, 527 (1983).  She states that appropriate physical \ndistancing is impossible in a correctional facility, and that \ncontinued incarceration will constitute cruel and unusual \npunishment for some individuals. \n  Neither the Attorney General nor the district attorneys for \nthe northern, northwestern, or Berkshire districts take a \nposition on whether any constitutional rights would be violated.  \nThe district attorney for the Berkshire district adds that \"all \nof the experts and government officials in Massachusetts have \nopined or suggested that the only hope of . . . reducing the \nnumber of deaths caused by COVID-19\" is physical distancing and \nfrequent handwashing and cleaning, which she states is \n\"impracticable\" in jails and prisons. \n  The seven district attorneys and the sheriffs argue that \nthe Eighth Amendment and art. 26 claims lack merit because the \npetitioners have not shown \"deliberate indifference\" on the part \nof any prison or jail official.  See Torres v. Commissioner of \nCorrection, 427 Mass. 611, 613–614 (1998).  They support this \nargument with affidavits from the DOC and the various sheriffs, \ndetailing the steps taken by the correctional institutions to \naddress the COVID-19 pandemic, summarized supra. \n  Based on their substantive and factual disagreements, the \nrespondents propose contrasting dispositional requests.  The \nseven district attorneys and the sheriffs ask that the petition \n \n\n25 \n \nbe denied in its entirety.  They argue that the steps already \nbeing taken towards reducing the population of incarcerated \nindividuals are sufficient to address the advancing public \nhealth emergency. \n  The remaining district attorneys and the Attorney General \nask that this court grant relief in the form of individualized \nreview, with the goal of quickly reducing the incarcerated \npopulation.  They do not approve of the blanket release of \nclasses of inmates, noting, as do the seven district attorneys, \nthe public safety concerns regarding the release of those \nconvicted of domestic violence or sexual assault; the dangers to \nreleased inmates and detainees who may not have a home, a \nmedical provider, or a means to obtain substance abuse \ntreatment; and the currently decreased availability of shelters \nand other social services.  The district attorneys for the \nSuffolk, northern, northwestern, and Berkshire districts ask \nthat we create an emergency committee responsible for rapidly \nand collaboratively creating and implementing a policy to reduce \nthe incarcerated population.  The district attorney for the \nSuffolk district argues that COVID-19 should be considered in \nvarious types of judicial decisions, and further requests that \nnew bench warrants not issue for failure to appear or failure of \nindigent defendants to pay fines or fees.  The Attorney General \nsuggests that we establish guidelines for the release of \n \n\n26 \n \npretrial detainees, and that we explore ways to allow relief for \nsentenced inmates, such as an amendment to Mass. R. Crim. P. 29. \n  3.  Discussion.  We agree that the situation is urgent and \nunprecedented, and that a reduction in the number of people who \nare held in custody is necessary.  We also agree with the \nAttorney General and the district attorneys that the process of \nreduction requires individualized determinations, on an \nexpedited basis, and, in order to achieve the fastest possible \nreduction, should focus first on those who are detained pretrial \nwho have not been charged with committing violent crimes.  \nHaving carefully examined the petitioners' arguments, we \nconclude that a modification of Rule 29 in the manner requested \nby the petitioners, such that judges could revise and revoke \nindefinitely valid sentences that have been imposed posttrial \nwould result in a violation of art. 30 by allowing judges \nessentially to perform the functions of the parole board.  See, \ne.g., Commonwealth v. Ly, 450 Mass. 16, 22, (2007); Commonwealth \nv. Amirault, 415 Mass. 112, 116-117 (1993).  Absent a violation \nof constitutional rights, which the petitioners agree has not \nbeen established on this record, we also do not have authority \nunder G. L. c. 211, § 3, to exercise supervision over parole, \nfurlough, or clemency decisions by the DOC, the parole board, \nthe sheriffs, and other members of the executive branch. \n \n\n27 \n \n  a.  The court's superintendence authority.  General Laws \nc. 211, § 3, provides that the Supreme Judicial Court \"shall \nhave general superintendence of all courts of inferior \njurisdiction to correct and prevent errors and abuses therein if \nno other remedy is expressly provided.\"  The court's general \nsuperintendence authority extends to \"the administration of all \ncourts of inferior jurisdiction,\" and permits the issuance of \n\"writs, summonses and other process and such orders, directions \nand rules as may be necessary or desirable for the furtherance \nof justice.\"  In the past, we have exercised our extraordinary \nsuperintendence authority to remedy matters of public interest \n\"that may cause further uncertainty within the courts\" \n(quotations omitted).  Simmons v. Clerk-Magistrate of the Boston \nDiv. of the Hous. Court Dep't, 448 Mass. 57, 61 (2006).  See \nBridgeman v. District Attorney for the Suffolk District, 471 \nMass. 465, 474 (2015) (court utilized broad powers of \nsuperintendence to address drug lab crisis affecting thousands \nof potential defendants); Lavallee v. Justices in the Hampden \nSuperior Court, 442 Mass. 228, 239 (2004) (relief under G. L. \nc. 211, § 3, is necessary to remedy shortages of attorneys to \nrepresent indigent defendants). \n  A petitioner seeking relief under G. L. c. 211, § 3, \"must \npresent a substantial claim involving important substantive \nrights, and demonstrate that any error cannot adequately be \n \n\n28 \n \nremedied in the course of trial or normal appellate review.\"  \nLavallee, 442 Mass. at 233.  See Costarelli v. Commonwealth, 374 \nMass. 677, 679 (1978) (discretionary review under court's \nsupervisory authority is \"extraordinary\" and only available \"in \nthe most exceptional circumstances\").  Here, the petitioners \nclaim that continued confinement in a jail or prison implicates \nconcerns of fundamental fairness, and rights secured by the due \nprocess clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions (pretrial \ndetainees) and the Eighth Amendment (inmates serving a sentence \nand pretrial detainees). \n  b.  Pretrial detainees.  We conclude, given the severity of \nthe COVOID-19 pandemic, that the petitioners, as representatives \nof incarcerated individuals, have established standing to bring \ntheir claim, and an entitlement to relief.  To establish \nrepresentative standing, \"[f]irst, the relationship of the \nlitigant to the third party whose right the litigant seeks to \nassert must be such that the enjoyment of the right is \ninextricably bound up with the activity the litigant wishes to \npursue.  Second, there must be some genuine obstacle that \nrenders the third party unable to assert the allegedly affected \nright on his or her own behalf.\"  Planned Parenthood League of \nMassachusetts, Inc. v. Bell, 424 Mass. 573, 578 (1997), citing \nSingleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 113-118 (1976).  \n\"Representative standing is generally limited to cases in which \n \n\n29 \n \nit is difficult or impossible for the actual rightholders to \nassert their claims\" (citation omitted).  Slama v. Attorney \nGen., 384 Mass. 620, 624 (1981).  Here, the relationship between \nthe petitioners and the detainees and incarcerated individuals, \nnow focused on having their clients released from custody, \nclearly is \"inextricably bound up with the activity the litigant \nwishes to pursue,\" e.g., obtaining release through litigation in \nthis court.  In the present circumstances, it is difficult, at \nbest, for incarcerated individuals to assert their claims; in \nparticular, the enormous volume of claims, the urgency of \nexpeditious hearings, the delays multiple individuals and \nattorneys have averred are occurring in holding hearings on \nmotions for release, and the apparent belief by some trial \njudges that they have no authority to allow reconsideration of \nbail because detainees have not shown changed circumstances, all \nplace severe obstacles in the path of any individual detainee \nseeking relief. \n  To effectuate such relief, pretrial detainees who are not \ncharged with an offense listed in Appendix A, and who are not \nbeing held without bail subsequent to a determination of \ndangerousness under G. L. c. 276, § 58A, as well as individuals \nwho are being held pending a final probation violation hearing, \nare entitled to expedited hearings on their motions for \nreconsideration of bail.  These categories of pretrial detainees \n \n\n30 \n \nshall be ordered released on personal recognizance unless the \nCommonwealth establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, \nthat release would result in an unreasonable danger to the \ncommunity or that the individual presents a very high risk of \nflight.18 \n  In making a determination whether release would not be \nappropriate, the judge should consider the totality of the \ncircumstances, including (1) the risk of the individual's \nexposure to COVID-19 in custody; (2) whether the defendant, \nalthough not held in preventative detention pursuant to G. L. \nc. 276, § 58A, nonetheless would pose a safety risk to the \nvictim and the victim's family members, witnesses, the \ncommunity, or him- or herself if released; (3) whether the \ndefendant is particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 due to a \npreexisting medical condition or advanced age; (4) for a \ndefendant who is accused of violating a condition of probation, \nwhether the alleged violation is a new criminal offense or a \ntechnical violation; and (5) the defendant's release plan.19 \n                     \n  18 This ruling does not preclude other pretrial detainees, \nwho have been charged with one of the excluded offenses \nenumerated in Appendix A, from seeking reconsideration of bail \non the ground of changed circumstances, which we have concluded \nexist as a matter of law.  These individuals, however, are not \nentitled to a rebuttable presumption of release. \n  19 Of course, those individuals who have tested positive or \nare symptomatic for COVID-19, or who are in quarantine due to \nhaving been in close contact with someone else who has tested \n \n\n31 \n \n  i.  Process to be followed.  Each sheriff in charge of a \nhouse of correction shall inform the special master, CPCS, the \ndistrict attorney for the district in which the institution is \nlocated, the clerks of the Superior, District, Boston Municipal, \nand Juvenile courts in that district, and the probation service \ndaily of the identity of each person who is detained awaiting \ntrial in the sheriff's facility, in reports setting forth the \ninformation specified in Appendix B.20  The defense bar and the \ndistrict attorney in each district shall make good faith efforts \nto reach agreement with respect to the release of as many \npretrial detainees as possible, so that agreed-upon motions for \nreconsideration of bail may be presented to trial court judges.21 \n  Based on the daily census reports to be provided by the \nsheriffs, CPCS shall facilitate the filing of any motions for \nreconsideration of the amount of bail or conditions of release, \nincluding contacting counsel for each detainee.  Defense counsel \nshall be permitted promptly to convene video or teleconferences \nwith their clients; the sheriffs' offices and DOC are to work \n                     \npositive, must remain in isolation or quarantine and would not \nbe eligible for release during those periods. \n  20 In addition, the DOC shall furnish the special master \ndaily reports of inmate counts and rates of COVID-19 cases at \neach facility, as explained in Appendix B. \n \n  21 Upon request by a defendant, the sheriffs also are \nrequired timely to provide the defendant with his or her \nrequested medical records. \n \n\n32 \n \nwith the defense bar to facilitate such communications.  The \ndistrict attorneys should make every effort to inform any victim \nof the motion, to be consistent with statutory requirements, to \nthe extent practical.  In light of the public health emergency \nposed by COVID-19, the inability of the Commonwealth to provide \nthe type of notice called for by the victims' rights statute, \nG. L. c. 258B, shall not be grounds for the continued detention \nof a detainee otherwise entitled to release in accordance with \nthis decision. \n  Hearings on motions for reconsideration of bail will take \nplace by videoconference or teleconference no later than two \nbusiness days after the filing of the motion.  A decision on the \nmotion shall be rendered promptly.  To enable expeditious \nprocessing of such motions, each relevant court shall establish \na designated session to hear motions for reconsideration of bail \nand release; a primary judge, a first backup, and a second \nbackup judge shall be assigned to each session.  Individuals who \nare aggrieved by the denial of a motion for reconsideration of \nbail may seek review under G. L. c. 211, § 3, from the single \njustice of the county court. \n  c.  New arrests.  We are persuaded that the limitations \nthat courts in other jurisdictions have placed on new detentions \nand incarcerations are compelling, and we adopt similar measures \nto reduce as far as possible the influx of new individuals into \n \n\n33 \n \ncorrectional institutions.  Following any arrest during the \nCOVID-19 state of emergency, and until further order of this \ncourt, a judicial officer should consider the risk that an \narrestee either may contract COVID-19 while detained, or may \ninfect others in a correctional institution, as a factor in \ndetermining whether bail is needed as a means to assure the \nindividual's appearance before the court.  Given the high risk \nposed by COVID-19 for people who are more than sixty years of \nage or who suffer from a high-risk condition as defined by the \nCDC, the age and health of an arrestee should be factored into \nsuch a bail determination.  This is an additional, temporary \nconsideration beyond those imposed by the relevant bail \nstatutes, G. L. c. 276, §§ 57 and 58, and by due process \nprinciples.  See Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 702-705 \n(2017); Querubin v. Commonwealth, 440 Mass. 108, 113-114 (2003).  \nA judge also must consider the same factors in deciding whether \nto detain an individual pending a revocation hearing based on an \nalleged violation of probation. \n  d.  Incarcerated individuals serving sentences.  The \npetitioners also seek release of multiple groups of individuals \nwho are currently serving sentences of incarceration.  They \nsuggest, inter alia, that, in order to do so, we eliminate the \nrequirement in Rule 29 that motions to revise or revoke a \nsentence be filed within sixty days of the imposition of the \n \n\n34 \n \nsentence or the issuance of the rescript.  See Mass. R. Crim. \nP. 29 (a) (2). \n  \"As a general matter, Massachusetts courts have recognized \nthat 'it is within the inherent authority of a trial judge to \n\"reconsider decisions made on the road to final judgment.\"'\"  \nCommonwealth v. Charles, 466 Mass. 63, 83 (2013), quoting \nHerbert A. Sullivan, Inc. v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., 439 Mass. 387, \n401 (2003).  See Commonwealth v. Cronk, 396 Mass. 194, 196, \n(1985), and cases cited (\"While the Massachusetts Rules of \nCriminal Procedure do not expressly permit a judge to rehear a \nmatter, no policy prohibits reconsideration of an order or \njudgment in appropriate circumstances\").  That authority is \nlimited once final judgment has entered. \n  Our broad power of superintendence over the courts does not \ngrant us the authority to authorize courts to revise or revoke \ndefendants' custodial sentences, to stay the execution of \nsentence, or to order their temporary release unless a defendant \n(1) has moved under Mass. R. Crim. P. 29, within sixty days \nafter imposition of sentence or the issuance of a decision on \nall pending appeals, to revise or revoke his or her sentence, \n(2) has appealed the conviction or sentence and the appeal \nremains pending, or (3) has moved for a new trial under Mass. R. \nCrim. P. 30. \n \n\n35 \n \n  Rule 29 allows revisions of a final sentence within sixty \ndays of its issuance or sixty days of the issuance of a decision \non any appeal from the sentence or from the underlying \nconviction.  Rule 29 \"recognizes that '[o]ccasions inevitably \nwill occur where a conscientious judge, after reflection or upon \nreceipt of new probation reports or other information, will feel \nthat he [or she] has been too harsh or has failed to give due \nweight to mitigating factors which properly he should have taken \ninto account.\"  Commonwealth v. Rodriguez, 461 Mass. 256, 260 \n(2012), quoting Commonwealth v. McCulloch, 450 Mass. 483, 487 \n(2008).  \"In such cases, a judge under rule 29 may 'reconsider \nthe sentence he [or she] has imposed and determine, in light of \nthe facts as they existed at the time of sentencing, whether the \nsentence was just.\"  Rodriguez, supra, quoting McCulloch, supra.  \n\"A judge, therefore, is not barred from reducing a sentence the \njudge has imposed until the time limits established in rule 29 \nto revise or revoke a sentence have expired.\"  Rodriguez, supra.  \nAbsent an assertion of an illegal sentence, such review is time-\nlimited both as to the filing of a motion for review and the \nissuance of a judge's decision within a \"reasonable\" time.  See \nCommonwealth v. Layne, 386 Mass. 291, 295-296 (1982), and cases \ncited. \n  The petitioners do not address the requirement of Rule 29 \nthat the reduction be based on a sentencing judge's later \n \n\n36 \n \ndetermination (with or without a hearing) that \"justice may not \nhave been done\" due to some factor present at the time of \nsentencing, or the reasons for that requirement.  See Layne, 386 \nMass. at 295-296, and cases cited.  They apparently discount the \nrequirement that review under Rule 29 (a) is to \"permit a judge \nto reconsider the sentence he [or she] has imposed and \ndetermine, in light of the facts as they existed at the time of \nsentencing, whether the sentence was just [emphasis in \noriginal].22  Commonwealth v. Amirault, 415 Mass. 112, 117 \n(1993), quoting Commonwealth v. Sitko, 372 Mass. 305, 313–314 \n(1977). \n  \"The granting of parole, [on the other hand,] is a \ndiscretionary act of the parole board.\"  Amirault, 415 Mass. at \n116-117, citing Lanier v. Massachusetts Parole Bd., 396 Mass. \n1018, 1018 (1986).  \"It is a function of the executive branch of \ngovernment.\"  Amirault, supra, citing Stewart v. Commonwealth, \n                     \n  22 In support of their argument that this court modify \nRule 29 to remove any period of limitation on a judge's \nauthority to revise and revoke a valid sentence, the petitioners \npoint to Commonwealth v. Tejeda, 481 Mass. 794, 797 (2019).  \nThat case, however, does not advance their position.  In Tejeda, \nwe reiterated that \"we have repeatedly and unequivocally held \nthat a judge may not take into account conduct of the defendant \nthat occurs subsequent to the original sentence\" (citations \nomitted).  Id.  Although we indicated that the judge in that \ncase could consider, post sentencing, that a more culpable \ncoventurer received a lesser sentence than had the defendant, we \nemphasized that \"the grounds for each sentence were known\" at \nthe time of defendant's trial.  Id. \n \n\n37 \n \n413 Mass. 664, 669 (1992), and Baxter v. Commonwealth, 359 Mass. \n175, 179 (1971).  \"By allowing a motion to revise or revoke \nsentences when the parole board does not act in accordance with \na judge's expectations, the judge is interfering with the \nexecutive function.  The judge cannot nullify the discretionary \nactions of the parole board.\"  Amirault, supra, and cases cited. \n  Rule 29 is designed to protect the separation of powers as \nset forth in art. 30.  See Clark, petitioner, 34 Mass. App. Ct. \n191, 195 (1993). \"The execution of sentences according to \nstanding laws is an attribute of the executive department of \ngovernment.\"  Sheehan, petitioner, 254 Mass. 342, 345 (1926).  \nTo attempt to \"revise,\" i.e., cut short, sentences in the \ncurrent situation would be to perform the function of the parole \nboard, thereby \"effectively usurp[ing] the decision-making \nauthority constitutionally allocated to the executive branch.\"  \nSee Stewart, 413 Mass. at 669, quoting Commonwealth v. Gordon, \n410 Mass. 498, 501 (1991); Amirault, 415 Mass. at 117 (\"[T]he \njudge imposed sentences that he noted were within the \nguidelines.  In considering requests for revision of those \nsentences under rule 29 the judge may not consider the denial of \nparole\"). \n  While we cannot order that relief be granted to sentenced \ninmates who have been serving a legal sentence, and who have not \ntimely moved to revise or revoke that sentence, mechanisms to \n \n\n38 \n \nallow various forms of relief for sentenced inmates exist within \nthe executive branch.  The parole board, for example, has \nauthority to release individuals who have become eligible for \nparole because they have reached their \"minimum term of \nsentence.\"  See G. L. c. 127, § 133.  An inmate in a house of \ncorrection can receive early parole consideration and be \nreleased up to sixty days prior to the minimum term based on \n\"any . . . reason that the Parole Board determines is \nsufficiently compelling.\"  120 Code Mass. Regs. § 200.10 (2017).  \nOnce an inmate reaches eligibility, the parole board must hold a \nhearing to decide whether to grant the inmate a parole permit.  \nSee G. L. c. 127, § 133A; 120 Code Mass. Regs. § 301.01 (2017).  \nSee also G. L. c. 127, § 134 (allowing employees other than \nparole board members to conduct hearings for inmates at houses \nof correction).23  The parole board \"shall only grant a parole \npermit if they are of the opinion that there is a reasonable \nprobability that . . . the offender will live and remain at \nliberty without violating the law and that release is not \nincompatible with the welfare of society.\"  120 Code Mass. Regs. \n§ 300.04 (2017).  See G. L. c. 127, § 130.  If denied parole, \ninmates generally are entitled to a rehearing after either one \n                     \n  23 The parole board reported at oral argument before us that \nit has made arrangements to hold hearings via video \nconferencing, and indeed was conducting two such hearings on the \nday of argument. \n \n\n39 \n \nor five years, but the board may hold an earlier rehearing at \nits discretion.  See G. L. c. 127, § 133A; 120 Code Mass. Regs. \n§ 301.01. \n  The parole board nonetheless reported at oral argument that \nit has made no efforts to accelerate the scheduling of parole \nhearings.  The board reports that currently approximately 300 \nindividuals have been deemed appropriate for release and have \nbeen awarded parole through the ordinary process, but have yet \nto be granted parole permits that would result in their actual \nrelease from custody because the board has not reduced what the \nboard says is a standard delay in preparing for release.24  \nDuring normal times, the two-week delay the board states is \nstandard might be reasonable.  But these are not normal times.  \nWe urge the board to expedite release of these previously-\napproved individuals, as well as to expedite hearings on other \ninmates who are eligible for parole. \n  e.  Constitutional claims.  As stated, while the \npetitioners argued in their initial brief that the failure to \n                     \n  24 The parole board stated at oral argument that release \ngenerally is delayed for two weeks after a favorable decision \nwhile the board finalizes the inmate's housing plan and contacts \nany victims or law enforcement agencies as required by statute.  \nSee G. L. c 258B, § 3; G. L. c. 127, § 133A; 120 Code Mass. \nRegs. § 301.06(3)(a) (2017).  The parole board should use every \neffort to expedite the several stages of this process as far as \nreasonably possible so as to reduce the over-all number of \nincarcerated inmates as quickly as possible. \n \n\n40 \n \nrelease incarcerated individuals violated the Eighth Amendment's \nprohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, and the failure to \nrelease pretrial detainees violated due process protections \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment and art. 26, in their reply brief \nand at oral argument they asserted that they are not pursuing \nsuch claims.  Accordingly, we do not consider their \nconstitutional claims.  See Commonwealth v. AdonSoto, 475 Mass. \n497, 506 (2016), quoting Commonwealth v. Raposo, 453 Mass. 739, \n743 (2009) (\"We do not decide constitutional questions unless \nthey must necessarily be reached\"). \n  4.  Conclusion.  Due to the crisis engendered by the COVID-\n19 pandemic, pretrial detainees who have not been charged with \nan excluded offense as set forth in Appendix A are entitled to a \nrebuttable presumption of release on personal recognizance, and \na hearing within two business days of filing a motion for \nreconsideration of bail and release, in accordance with the \nprocedures set forth in this opinion. \n  The special master shall report weekly to this court, as \nset forth in this opinion, in order to facilitate any further \nresponse necessary as a result of this rapidly-evolving \nsituation. \n              So ordered. \n   \n \n\n41 \n \nAppendix A. \nEXCLUDED OFFENSES \n  1.

NO. SJC-12926 \n \nCOMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC COUNSEL SERVICES & \nMASSACHUSETTS ASSOCIATION OF CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYERS, \nPetitioners \n \nv. \n \nCHIEF JUSTICE OF THE TRIAL COURT,  \nRespondent \n \n______________________________________________________ \n \nOPPOSITION TO THE PETITIONERS' G.L. c. 211, § 3 PETITION BY THE DISTRICT \nATTORNEYS FOR THE BRISTOL, CAPE & ISLANDS, ESSEX, HAMPDEN, MIDDLE, \nNORFOLK, & PLYMOUTH DISTRICTS \n______________________________________________________ \n \n  The  petitioners,  the  Committee  for  Public  Counsel  Services  (CPCS)  and  the \nMassachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (MACDL), have filed a petition under \nG.L. c. 211, § 3 seeking release of certain classes of incarcerated individuals, whether detained in \npretrial custody or under sentence, as well as modifications to probationers' conditions of release \n(No.  SJ-2020-0115).  We,  the  District  Attorneys  for  the  Bristol,  Cape  and  Islands,  Essex, \nHampden, Middle, Norfolk, and Plymouth Districts [hereinafter“the seven district attorneys”], \nsupport the continued lawful practice of individualized hearings to address issues of bail and \nsentences.   \n“Ensuring the public’s safety is of the first order of government, a duty underlying all \ngovernment action.” Lavallee v. Justices in Hampden Superior Court,  442 Mass. 228, 245 \n(2004).  The seven district attorneys share the concerns of the petitioners regarding the risks \npresented by COVID-19 in detention facilities in the Commonwealth. But as the chief law \n1 \n \n\nenforcement  officers  in  seven  districts  responsible  for  the  safety  of  some  3.8  million \nCommonwealth  residents, and the rights and interests of crime victims, we submit that the crisis \nis not cause to abandon government’s most basic function of safeguarding its citizens. \nThe petitioners do not account for the safety and rights of the victims of crime, and they \ndo not account for the safety and rights of the public.  Likewise, the petitioners do not account \nfor the hard work of the trial courts, practitioners representing actual clients, prosecutors, and \nprobation offices, all of whom are diligently and expeditiously conducting appropriate hearings \nand protecting the safety and the rights of the public and the individual defendants. \nThe seven district attorneys are committed to taking appropriate steps consistent with \npublic safety to mitigate the risks of infection in jails and prisons. Such measures are already \nunderway.  In  questions  surrounding  bail  and  pre-trial  detention,  our  staffs  are  advised  to \nconsider, and judges are already taking into account, the risks of confinement posed by COVID-\n19. We have staff available at every courthouse in our respective jurisdictions to entertain any \nand all emergency motions for release. Trial court measures have facilitated quick hearings on \nsuch motions. And in individual cases, our offices have agreed, and will continue to agree, to \nmeritorious petitions for release based on medical vulnerability where release is also compatible \nwith public safety. As a result of this on-going practice, and a sharp decline in new arrests, new \nentries into pre-trial detention have dropped precipitously across the Commonwealth.   \nAnd though we are mindful of the dangers of the virus in confined settings, we are also \naware of extraordinary efforts on the part of correctional institutions’ staffs, in partnership with \ntheir  contracted  healthcare  providers  and  the  Department  of  Public  Health,  to  prevent  the \nintroduction and spread of the virus within their institutions. These are interests that inmates and \ncorrectional  staff,  as  well  as  the  broader  law  enforcement  community,  share  in  common.  \n2 \n \n\nThough, as in civil society, some degree of infection is to be expected, it is hoped that these \nefforts will help to mitigate risks to the health and safety of inmates and correctional staff and \ntheir families. Our offices are in constant communication with custodial authorities concerning \nthese issues as they develop.   \nBut the petitioners’ claims, calling for the release of broad categories of inmates without \nappropriate safeguards for the general public, and the departing inmates themselves, are not \nconsistent with government’s basic mission. For example, the petitioners demand “immediate[] \nrelease, with or without conditions,” of any incarcerated inmate under sentence “diagnosed with \na condition or disease that puts them at increased risk” from COVID-19, including such common \nconditions as diabetes, without regard to the offense upon which the inmate was sentenced. They \nsuggest release be premised upon such sentences being deemed served. This would presumably \ninclude convicted murderers serving life sentences, rapists, domestic abusers who have violated \nstay away orders, drug dealers, and repeat drunk drivers, to name a few. This action would not \nonly risk public safety at a time when law enforcement is stretched thin by the COVID-19 \npandemic, but also risk the safety of vulnerable inmates without viable release plans or supports \nin the community.   \nWhile recognizing the situation is unprecedented and fast moving, the seven district \nattorneys also have concerns about the legality of measures proposed -- some of which appear to \nencroach on core executive and legislative functions. That said, the seven district attorneys are \ncommitted to cooperating with our law enforcement partners and others in coming to reasonable \nand measured solutions, when necessary.  \n3 \n \n\nII.  STATEMENT OF THE CASE \n  On March 24, 2020, the petition was docketed in the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk \nCounty. On March 24, 2020, Budd, J., sitting as single justice, named the district attorneys, \namong others, as necessary parties, and ordered the respondents to reply by 11:59 P.M. on March \n26, 2020. On March 25, 2020, the single justice reserved and reported the matter to the full court \nand extended the necessary parties' response due date to 5:00 P.M. on March 27, 2020. In \nresponse to that order, the seven district attorneys submit this memorandum of law. \nIII.  STATEMENT OF THE FACTS \n  The petitioners have not identified any particular aggrieved pre-trial or post-conviction \ninmate or probationer,  nor have they alleged that the trial court has  failed to provide any \nincarcerated person or probationer with a vehicle by which to address concerns about his or her \nconfinement or release conditions in light of COVID-19.  The seven district attorneys have \nattached affidavits to support the factual assertions made herein. See Addendum attached. \nIV.  ARGUMENT \nA.  The petitioners’ requests, in large measure, do not address safety concerns of the \nvictims, public or defendants to be released. \n \nThe petitioners request immediate release, regardless of whether conditions are in place, \nof broad categories of detainees (petition at 15-17). Such requests include individuals held in lieu \nof bail under G.L. c. 276, §58, without any consideration that judges have already found that bail \nwas necessary and appropriate under Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691 (2017). Also \nincluded are individuals held on bail revocation for “technical violation of their conditions of \nrelease.”  In  discussing  violations  of  probation  (petition  at  18),  a  “technical”  violation  of \nprobation is interpreted as “violations other than an allegation of a new criminal offense.” Such \ninterpretation would include standard conditions of release such as stay away and no contact \n4 \n \n\norders, for which violation would implicate both a dangerous disregard for court orders whose \npurpose was to ensure the safety of victims and witnesses, and which implicate the safety \ninterests of those victims and witnesses, factors that should be considered as to whether the \nindividual should be released.1 Other categories include individuals over the age of 60 and \nindividuals at greater risk of harm from COVID-19, without any regard for the offenses which \nthey are alleged to have committed or the facts and circumstances of the crime. \n  The categories as to individuals who have already received due process and are serving a \nsentence via a valid conviction produce additional concerns. Such broad categories include any \nindividual not incarcerated for an offense under G.L. c. 265 who is eligible for parole, over the \nage of 60, or serving a sentence in the House of Correction (petition at 16-17). There are a wide \nrange of criminal offenses located outside of G.L. c. 265 which involve violence, abuse, or threat \nof harm to persons or society.2 Moreover, that the committing offense is not an offense under \nG.L. c. 265 does not mean that the crime did not involve an offense against the person. During \nthe course of plea-bargaining, offenses may be dismissed upon contemplation of a plea. The \n                     \n1 As to requests concerning bench warrants (request #2), probation orders (request #3), pre-trial \nconditions involving drug testing, employment, and education (request #4), the seven district \nattorneys recognize that this Court has jurisdiction over inferior courts, but suggest if such action \nis taken, it should be suspended until further court order and not vacated outright.  \n2 See, e.g., G.L. c. 90, §24L (operating under the influence causing serious bodily injury); G.L.c. \n90, §24V (child endangerment while operating under the influence); G.L. c. 90, §24G (motor \nvehicle homicide); G.L. c. 94C, §32E (trafficking controlled substances, including fentanyl and \ncarfentanil);  G.L.  c.  209A,  §7  (violations  of  abuse  prevention  orders);  G.L.  c.  258E,  §9 \n(violations of harassment prevention order); G.L. c. 266, §§1-2 (arson); G.L. c. 266, §14 (armed \nburglary); G.L. c. 266, §§16 & 18 (breaking and entering with intent to commit  a felony); G.L. \nc. 266, §§102 & 102C (possession of an incendiary device and possession of a biological, \nchemical, or nuclear weapon); G.L. c. 268, §13B (witness intimidation); G.L. c. 268, §§15A & \n15B (escape); G.L. c. 269 (firearm convictions including armed career criminal enhancements \nunder G.L. c. 269, §10G); G.L. c. 272, §4A (inducing a minor into prostitution); G.L. c. 272, §28 \n(dissemination of matter harmful to minors), G.L. c. 272, §29A (posing a child in state of \nnudity); G.L. c. 272, §35A (unnatural and lascivious acts with a child under 16); G.L. c. 272, §77 \n(cruelty to animals); G.L. c. 279, §25 (habitual offender). \n5 \n \n\nexclusion of G.L. c. 265 crimes is underinclusive of those inmates who present a risk of harm to \nothers or society.  See G.L. c. 266, §§1, 14-18A. \n  The petitioners also seek release, without any conviction limitation, of those diagnosed \nwith a condition putting them at increased risk of COVID-19 complications, individuals who \nqualify for medical parole, or individuals for whom a stay or release is appropriate.  This request \nincludes the most serious offenses, including murders and rapes. It would cover individuals who \nare serving long sentences and those who are serving life without parole sentences. It would \ninclude individuals who have been denied parole, indicating their unsuitability for return into \nsociety. As to the request for release of those who qualify for medical parole, to the extent the \npetition is seeking something other than the process currently employed, which involves findings \nof the Commissioner that the individual is eligible for medical parole by statute, would live and \nremain at liberty without violating  the law and that the individual’s release is not incompatible \nwith the welfare of society, the categories of eligibility are statutory definitions, not medical \ndefinitions, which include both a medical component and public safety component. See G.L. c. \n127, §119A (“‘Permanent incapacitation’, a physical or cognitive incapacitation that appears \nirreversible, as determined by a licensed physician, and that is so debilitating that the prisoner \ndoes not pose a public safety risk”; “‘Terminal illness’, a condition that appears incurable, as \ndetermined by a licensed physician, that will likely cause the death of the prisoner in not more \nthan 18 months and that is so debilitating that the prisoner does not pose a public safety risk”). \nIndividuals serving long sentences likely would not have anticipated release, and may not \nhave  ready  supports  in  the  community.  Re-entry  programs  may  be  unavailable  due  to  the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. Release of individuals into the community who may have no place to live \nor necessary supports presents both a public safety and a public health risk. Community supports, \n6 \n \n\nincluding  hospital  resources,  are  stressed  without  the  additional  influx  of  individuals  who \ncurrently have had those supports provided by the institution in which they reside. The proposed \nplan makes no mention of individuals who may have been in a facility where there is COVID-19, \nor how any individual exposed could self-quarantine if deemed appropriate.   \nVictims’  statutorily  granted  rights  under  the  Victim’s  Bill  of  Rights  should  not  be \nabrogated. Chapter 258B grants victims “basic and fundamental rights”, including to be informed \nby the prosecutor of the final disposition of the case, including an explanation of the type of \nsentence imposed, and a copy of the conditions of probation or release within thirty days of \nestablishing the conditions, G.L. c. 258B, §3(q); to be informed by the parole board of the \ndefendant’s parole eligibility and status in the criminal justice system, G.L. c. 258B, §3(s); and, \nmost critically, to be informed in advance by the appropriate custodial authority whenever the \ndefendant receives a temporary, provisional or final release from custody, G.L. c. 258B, §3(t). \nThe immediate release of defendants takes away what could be a critical time period for victims \nto assure their own safety. Further, victims and district attorneys also have rights to appear at \ncertain parole hearings, see G.L. c. 127, §133A, and medical parole hearings, see G.L. 127, \n§119A(c)(2) & (d)(2), where they can be on notice of an individual’s likely release and advocate \nany safety concerns they may have. \n  The  admittedly  immense  presence  of  COVID-19  cannot  and  should  not  cause  the \nCommonwealth  to  abandon  its  obligations  under  state  law  to  provide  victims  with  their \nstatutorily-granted rights. Ignoring any consideration of any factor other than COVID-19 loses \nsight of the needs of the victim, which may include physical, emotional, and mental safety. Pre-\ntrial release can be a dangerous time for a victim, particularly domestic violence victims. Pre-\ntrial release, without conditions such as monitoring or the supervision of stay away or no contact \n7 \n \n\norders,  takes  away the  safeguards provided to  victims. Further, a sentence may have been \nimposed in light of specific considerations of the victim, including removal of harm to a minor \nchild until the age of maturity or the need to ensure separation for a defined period of time. See, \ne.g., Commonwealth v. McGonagle, 478 Mass. 675, 678-680 (2018)(victim may recommend \nparticular sentence); see also Commonwealth v. Rodriguez, 461 Mass. 256, 259 (2012)(“[T]o \nimpose  a  just  sentence,  a  judge  requires  not  only  sound  judgment  but  also  information \nconcerning the crimes of which the defendant stands convicted, the defendant’s criminal and \npersonal history, and the impact of the crimes on the victims”).   \nAs of March 1, 2020, per the Massachusetts Department of Correction statistics, 73% of \nmale inmates and 64% of female inmates had a violent governing offense.3  Immediate and \nunsupervised  release both endangers public safety and unnecessarily overtaxes the criminal \njustice  system.  These  individuals,  who  have  had  all  the  due  process  accordant  with  their \nconvictions, are in state prison due to the seriousness of their criminal offenses and the judge’s \nimposition  of  sentence.  If  legally  imposed  protective  measures  for  victims  are  unilaterally \nabandoned, an untold score of victims will have to seek immediate relief in the courts. Victims, \nwho did not anticipate the release of dangerous inmates, may flood the system with emergency \nrequests for restraining orders. But this Court, by order, for the safety of probation officers, has \ncurtailed in all but extremely limited circumstances -- where there are findings of a compelling \npublic safety need and an exclusion or inclusion zone -- the imposition of global positioning \nsystems which could provide a measure of protection.  Supports both in the criminal justice \nsystem and in the community are limited or unavailable.  \n \n                     \n3  Mass.gov/service-details/quick-statistics (last accessed March 27, 2020), \n8 \n \n\nB.  As a matter of law, the petitioners do not assert claims where they are personally \naggrieved and do not meet the legal requirements to assert such claims for others. \n  \n  There  is  a  preliminary  matter  for  the  Court’s  consideration:  namely,  whether  the \npetitioner legal associations may assert potential claims in this Court of incarcerated defendants \nand probationers, who may or may not be their clients. \nFirst, the petitioners have failed to identify an actual controversy.  That is, facts where \nincarcerated persons and probationers have tried to go to court for relief but were denied access, \nor the Department of Correction and county sheriffs have ignored the safety hazards related to \nCOVID-19. See Massachusetts Ass’n of Indep. Ins. Agents & Brokers v. Comm’r of Ins., 373 \nMass. 290, 292, 293 (1977)(there must be an actual controversy and standing). \nNext, a bedrock principle of our judicial system requires litigants to have standing to \nappear before the court. See Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation \nof Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 471 (1982); Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975).  It \nis an issue of subject matter jurisdiction for this Court; it is not procedural. Doe v. The Governor, \n381  Mass.  702,  705  (1980)(citation  omitted).  Far  from  elevating  form  over  substance,  the \nstanding doctrine reserves the courts’ resources for matters of controversy between parties whose \ninterests are directly affected by the claimed harm. See Bonan v. City of Boston, 398 Mass. 315, \n320 (1986). This long-standing principle was explained by this Court, more than ninety years \nago, in Horton v. Attorney Gen., 269 Mass. 503, 514 (1930), as follows: \nIt is a general principle that no one can question in the courts the constitutionality of a \nstatute  already  enacted  except  one  whose  rights  are  impaired  thereby.  The  judicial \ndepartment of government has no power to inquire into the constitutionality of statutes by \nproceedings directly to that end. It is only when some person invokes their aid to protect \nhim in his liberty, rights or property as secured under the Constitution against invasion \nthrough  the  operation  of  a  statute,  that  the  courts  examine  objections  to  its \nconstitutionality.  Only  those  directly  affected  as  to  some  personal  interest  by  the \noperation of a statute can question its validity. \n  \n9 \n \n\nThus, the question of standing is one of critical significance, and has been consistently applied \nonly to persons who have themselves suffered, or who are in danger of suffering, a cognizable \nlegal injury. See Animal Legal Def. Fund, Inc. v. Fisheries & Wildlife Bd., 416 Mass. 635, 638 \n(1993)(quoting Slama v. Attorney Gen., 384 Mass. 620, 624 (1981)).   \nIn order to have standing, a party must have a personal stake in the outcome of the case.  \nSee In re Care & Protection of Sharlene, 445 Mass. 756, 771 (2006); Commonwealth v. Lawson, \n79 Mass. App. Ct. 322, 325 n.3, rev. denied, 460 Mass. 1105 (2011). That is, the party seeking \nrelief must be personally aggrieved. See United States v. Pearce, 531 F.3d 374, 381 (6th Cir. \n2008). Injuries that are speculative, remote and indirect are insufficient to confer standing.  \nPerella v. Massachusetts Tpk. Auth., 55 Mass. App. Ct. 537, 539 (2002). “Not every person \nwhose interests might conceivably be adversely affected is entitled to [judicial] review. . . . To \nhave standing in any capacity, a litigant must show that the challenged action has caused the \nlitigant  injury.”  Ginther  v.  Comm’r  of  Ins.,  427  Mass.  319,  323  (1998)(citations  omitted).  \nNeither petitioner meets this necessary legal threshold. \nLacking any legal cognizable injury, as these petitioners do, standing to bring the claims \nof others has been recognized in any one of three ways: association standing, the public interest \ndoctrine,  and  representational  standing.    On  this  record,  the  petitioners  fail  upon  all  three \nalternative theories of standing. \n In determining whether an association has standing to bring claims on behalf of its \nmembers,  Massachusetts  courts  follow  the  three-part  test  enunciated  by  the  United  States \nSupreme Court in Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977). \nFirst, the association’s members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; second, \nthe interests the petitioner seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and third, \n10 \n \n\nneither the claim(s) asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual \nmembers in the lawsuit. Animal Legal Def. Fund, Inc. v. Fisheries & Wildlife Bd., 416 Mass. at \n638 n.4; Modified Motorcycle Ass’n of Massachusetts, Inc. v. Commonwealth, 60 Mass. App. Ct. \n83, 85 n.6 (2003) (quoting Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343).   \nRecognizing, without conceding, that the petitioners arguably meet the second prong of \nthis test, petitioners’ standing fails nonetheless because of their inability to meet the well-\nestablished first and third requirements.4  \nSo too, the petitioners’, thus far implicit, invocation of the “public right doctrine”, to \nestablish standing, in the absence of a cognizable legal injury, is insufficient to provide them \nstanding in the instant matter. See Perrella v. Mass. Tpk. Auth., 55 Mass. App. Ct. at 539-540.5   \n                     \n4 The petitioners’ legal associations do not have the right to bring suit individually.  “[I]f the \nindividual petitioners may not maintain the action on their own behalf, they may not seek relief \non behalf of a class[.]” Harvard Climate Justice Coalition v. President and Fellows of Harvard \nCollege & others, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 444, 448 (2016) (quoting Doe v. The Governor, 381 Mass. \n702, 704-705 (1980)).  In addition, even if the rights of potential clients could be asserted by the \npetitioners  --  a  factual  impossibility  --  resolution  of  their  claim(s)  involves  fact-intensive \nindividualized inquiries. See, e.g., National Ass’n of Gov’t Emp. v. Mulligan, 914 F.Supp.2d 10, \n13-14  (D.Mass.  2012)  (associational  standing  is  inappropriate  if  adjudicating  merits  or \ndetermining damages requires a fact-intensive individual inquiry); Massachusetts Bay Transp. \nAuth. v. Local 586, Amalgamated Transit Union, 406 Mass. 36, 41 (1981). \n5 Under the public right doctrine, a petitioner may seek relief (in the nature of mandamus) to \ncompel the performance of a duty required by law. Perrella, 55 Mass. App. Ct.at 539. Where the \npublic right doctrine applies, the individual petitioner need not show he/she has any legal interest \nin the result since the people of the Commonwealth are considered the interested party.  Id. at \n539-540 (citations omitted).  The petitioners' claim fails because they have not shown that the \nrespondents, individually or collectively, are refusing to or failing to perform or administer a law \nfor the public benefit. Id. at 540. Only  when  this legal requirement is met, can courts be \ncompelled to assume the difficult and delicate duty of passing upon the validity of the acts of a \ncoordinate branch of government.  Ginther v. Comm'r of Ins., 427 Mass. 319, 322 (1998). Also, \nthe  public  right  doctrine  cannot  be  invoked  for  broad  purposes,  or  to  challenge  the \nconstitutionality of a statute. Tax Equity Alliance for Massachusetts v. Comm’r of Revenue, 423 \nMass. at 715.    \n \n11 \n \n\nNeither does the record provide the petitioners with representational standing. To be \napplied,  a  party  must  allege  facts  showing  that  it  is  difficult  or  impossible  for  the  actual \naggrieved party to assert their claims. Slama v. Attorney Gen., 384 Mass. at 624.  Even assuming \narguendo that the petitioners’ legal associations could state a claim asserting the current COVID-\n19  pandemic  poses  serious  and  immediate  risks  to  the  constitutional  rights  of  incarcerated \npersons or probationers, who may or may not be their clients, petitioners have advanced no \nfactual reasons why these potential clients could not prosecute the claims in their own right, \neither pro se or with legal aid, so as to avail themselves of the legal remedies available to their \nindividual situations through the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal and/or Appellate Procedure, or \nexecutive orders of clemency, pardon or parole. Absent any alleged facts that it would be \ndifficult or impossible for these potential clients to assert their constitutional rights in a case-by-\ncase review of their individual situations amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the petitioners lack \nstanding to represent those persons. See Barbara F. v. Bristol Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep’t, \n432 Mass. 1024, 1025 (2000). Compare Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts, Inc. v. \nBell, 424 Mass. 573, 578-579 (1997) (abortion clinic had representational standing to seek \ninjunctive  relief  against  protester,  where  privacy  concerns  of  patients  made  it  difficult  for \npatients to assert their rights). In sum, the petitioners’ claims must be rejected for not stating an \nactual controversy and for lack of any standing. For these reasons, the petitioners’ petition should \nbe dismissed.  \nC. The pleas for relief under G. L. c. 211, § 3 are legally unavailable as the statutory \nsupervisory authority of this court is limited to the operations and functions of the courts \nand cannot supersede any existing laws that govern sentencing, parole, or pardons, and the \nrelief sought would violate the constitutional separation of powers between the judicial, \nlegislative and executive branches.6 \n                     \n6 The seven district attorneys are not addressing herein the legal relationships and authority of \nthe Court to give guidance on how to proceed with bail hearings, as the trial courts are already \n12 \n \n\n \nUnder  G.L.  c.  211,    §3,  this  Court  \"shall  have  the  general  superintendence  of  the \nadministration of all courts of inferior jurisdiction, including, without limitation, the prompt \nhearing and disposition of matters pending therein . . . .\" G.L. c. 211, §3.  But its superintendence \npower \"shall not include the authority to supersede any general or special law unless the supreme \njudicial  court,  acting  under  its  original  or  appellate  jurisdiction  finds  such  law  to  be \nunconstitutional in any case or controversy . . . .\"  G. L. c. 211, §3.7 \n  The relief sought by this petition is largely comprised of the categorical release, without \nindividual hearings of facts and legal arguments, of thousands of persons currently serving \nlawful sentences for violent crimes who pose a grave danger of harm to public safety. Relief \nfrom sentences imposed after a fair trial, conviction and sentencing hearing, would require \nsuspending  or  superseding  many  statutes  regarding  sentencing,  parole,  pardons  and \ncommutations. See G.L. c. 127; G.L. c. 265, et. seq.; Mass. Declaration of Rights, Article 73.8  \n                                                                  \nproceeding and taking into account the risk to individual and public health during those hearings; \nnor are the undersigned addressing the legal relationship and authority of the Court and the \nCommissioner  of  Probation,  and  leave  those  matters  to  the  Commissioner  of  Probation  to \naddress.  \n7 The Court will employ its G. L. c. 211, § 3 powers only when a party demonstrates \"both a \n \nsubstantial claim of a violation of his substantive rights and irremediable error, such that he \ncannot be placed in status quo in the regular course of appeal.\" Schipani v. Commonwealth, 382 \nMass.  685,  686  (1980)  (quoting  Morrissette  v.  Commonwealth,  380  Mass.  197,  198 \n(1980)(emphasis added)). \"'[T]he rights of criminal defendants are generally fully protected \nthrough the regular appellate process.'\"  Morrissette, 380 Mass. at 198 (quoting Costarelli v. \nCommonwealth, 374 Mass. 677, 679 (1978)). If a petitioner can raise a claim of error in the \nnormal course of trial and appeal, the Court will deny him G. L. c. 211, § 3 relief. Pandey v. \nSuperior  Court,  412  Mass.  1001,  1001  (1992)(rescript);  C  &  C  Bookshops,  Inc.  v. \nCommonwealth, 388 Mass. 1009 (1983)(rescript).  It falls to the petitioner to demonstrate the \nabsence or inadequacy of other available remedies.  Callahan v. Superior Court, 432 Mass. \n1023, 1023 (2000)(rescript); Jordan v. Superior Court, 426 Mass. 1019, 1019 (1998)(rescript).  \nThe petitioners have not even attempted and, indeed, cannot satisfy that burden.  Motions for \nrelease have been heard expeditiously in the trial courts.\n \n8 Article 73 reads as follows: Article 8 of section I of chapter II of Part the Second of the \nConstitution of the Commonwealth is hereby annulled and the following is adopted in place \n13 \n \n\nGenerally this Court does not alter a sentence unless there has been a clear legal error in the \nsentence.  Commonwealth  v.  Woodward,  427  Mass.  659,  683  (1998).  Use  of  this  Court’s \nsuperintendence powers to order the release of inmates who are currently serving lawfully \nimposed sentences would be inconsistent with its prior decisions and a violation of both Articles \n20 and 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.   \nPursuant to the General Laws, numerous judges of the Superior and District Courts have \nconducted  individual  hearings,  made  factual  findings,  and  issued  bail  orders  and  executed \nsentences of the incarcerated persons who are the subject of this petition. Now, in a single \npetition, petitioners request the suspension of these laws so that these individuals can be released \nand their sentences prematurely deemed served. Because Article 20 forbids such action unless \ntaken by the legislature, the petitioners’ claims should be rejected. \n“The power of suspending the laws, or the execution of the laws, ought never to be \nexercised but by the legislature, or by authority derived from it, to be exercised in such particular \ncases only as the legislature shall expressly provide for.” Art. 20. The prisoners are in custody as \na result of individual adjudications of each case, where defendants received the full range of state \nand constitutional protections.  The petition seeks to sweep these individual adjudications aside \nin favor of granting these prisoners immediate release without judicial review and ordering a \nlegally imposed  sentence deemed served prior to its legally valid termination date. There is “no \ndoubt that the legislature may suspend a law, or the execution or operation of a law, whenever \n                                                                  \nthereof:-- Art. 8. The power of pardoning offences, except such as persons may be convicted of \nbefore the senate by an impeachment of the house, shall be in the governor, by and with the \nadvice of council, provided, that if the offence is a felony the general court shall have power to \nprescribe the terms and conditions upon which a pardon may be granted; but no charter of \npardon, granted by the governor, with advice of the council before conviction, shall avail the \nparty pleading the same, notwithstanding any general or particular expressions contained therein, \ndescriptive of the offence or offences intended to be pardoned.\n \n14 \n \n\nthey shall think it expedient,” but such a determination is for the legislature, not the courts.  \nHolden v. James, 11 Mass. 396, 405 (1814) (It is “manifestly contrary to the first principle of \ncivil liberty and natural justice, and to the spirit of our constitution and laws, that only one \ncitizen [or class of citizens] should enjoy privileges and advantages which are denied to all \nothers under like circumstances.”). \nBecause the Massachusetts Constitution entrusted the legislature with “full power and \nauthority” to define crimes and penalties and to establish courts for determining all matters, any \nsuspension of the laws logically rests there.  Mass. Const. Part II, c. 1, § 1 art. 3 and 4. “That \npower cannot be surrendered or delegated.”  Opinion of the Justices, 286 Mass. 611, 617 (1934).  \nHere, the General Court established laws pertaining to bail as well as sentencing for those \nconvicted of crimes.  The Superior and District courts dutifully executed those laws in individual \ncases. If it finds that the execution of such laws should now be suspended due to an emergency \n(not just for these current prisoners, but for all future persons who may be subject to the laws of \nthe Commonwealth), the legislature has the exclusive prerogative to do so.  See, e.g., Gorman v. \nNew Bedford, 383 Mass. 57, 60 (1981) (legislation may suspend laws by permitting local option \non water fluoridation); MBTA Advisory Board v. MBTA, 382 Mass. 569, 578 (1981) (governor’s \nexecutive  order  suspending  operation  of  MBTA  unconstitutional  in  absence  of  legislative \nauthority); Paddock v. Brookline, 347 Mass. 230, 236-37 (1964) (special legislation creating tort \ncause of action for individual unconstitutional); Opinion of the Justices, 286 Mass. 611, 619 \n(1934) (legislation may suspend laws regarding animal traps by permitting adoption of local \noption);  In  re  Picquet,  22  Mass.  65,  71-72  (1827)  (legislature  has  “no  authority  by  the \nconstitution to suspend any of the general laws, limiting the suspension to an individual person, \nand leaving the law still in force in regard to everyone else”); Holden v. James, 11 Mass. at 405 \n15 \n \n\n(special legislation cannot create “new and different rule for the government of one particular \ncase”). \nA “fundamental principle of our system of government is that power to make laws for the \ngeneral welfare is vested in the General Court.”  Opinion of the Justices, 286 Mass. at 617. That \nprinciple would be seriously undermined if a petitioner, not a party to any prior proceedings, \ncould succeed in cutting the legislature out of the decision-making process. This concern is \nespecially  real  in  this  case  because  the  wholesale  release  of  prisoners  without  individual \nadjudication is entirely inconsistent with the ultimate purpose of government: “The end of the \ninstitution, maintenance, and administration of government, is to secure the existence of the body \npolitic, to protect it, and to furnish the individuals who compose it with the power of enjoying in \nsafety and tranquility their natural right, and the blessings of life . . . .”  Preamble, Massachusetts \nConstitution (emphasis added).   \nFurther, the Court lacks authority to grant the petition as the legislature has provided the \ncustodians of prisoners with the authority to remove prisoners from one location to another in the \nevent of necessity due to disease, by G.L. c. 126, § 26. 9 \nNearly ninety years ago this Court summarized the division of responsibilities among the \nbranches in the criminal context:  \n                     \n9 Section 26: Removal of prisoners in case of disease: \nIf disease breaks out in a jail or other county prison, which, in the opinion of the inspectors of the \nprison, may endanger the lives or health of the prisoners to such a degree as to render their \nremoval necessary, the inspectors may designate in writing a suitable place within the same \ncounty, or any prison in a contiguous county, as a place of confinement for such prisoners. Such \ndesignation, having been filed with the clerk of the superior court, shall be a sufficient authority \nfor the sheriff, jailer, superintendent or keeper to remove all prisoners in his custody to the place \ndesignated, and there to confine them until they can safely be returned to the place whence they \nwere removed. Any place to which the prisoners are so removed shall during their imprisonment \ntherein be deemed a prison of the county where they were originally confined, but they shall be \nunder the care, government and direction of the officers of the county where they are confined.\n \n16 \n \n\nThe definition of crimes and the establishment of penalties therefor, so far as not left to \nthe common law, belong to the Legislature. The trial of those charged with crime and the \nimposition of sentences upon those convicted are a part of the functions of courts. The \nexecution  of  sentences  according  to  standing  laws  is  an  attribute  of  the  executive \ndepartment of government. This is in conformity to the sharp and strict separation of the \nlegislative, the executive and the judicial departments of government in article 30 of our \nDeclaration of Rights. \n  \nSheehan, petitioner, 254 Mass. 342, 345 (1926). \n \nThis summary accurately captures our understanding of the separation of powers as it \noperates today. Commonwealth v. Cole, 468 Mass. 294, 303 (2014). Once imposed, only the \nexecutive  branch  holds  the  power  and  responsibility  to  execute  the  sentence.   Id.  at \n302; Commonwealth v. Dascalakis, 246 Mass. 12, 21 (1923) (“The execution of the sentence \nbelongs to the executive department of government” and is not “a judicial function”). Indeed,  \nonce a judge has sentenced a defendant, authority over the defendant passes from the \njudicial branch to the executive branch of government in that the defendant becomes \nsubject  to  the  sheriff’s  control.  The  Legislature  has  conferred  on  the  sheriff  broad \nauthority over the house of correction. General Laws c. 126, § 16, states that “[t]he \nsheriff shall have custody and control of the jails in his county, and, except in Suffolk \nCounty, of the houses of correction therein, and of all prisoners committed thereto     . . . \nand  shall  be  responsible  for  them.” See  Sheehan  v. Superintendent  of  Concord \nReformatory, 254 Mass. 342, 345 (1926) (“The execution of sentences according to \nstanding laws is an attribute of the executive department of government”). \n \nCommonwealth v. Donohue, 452 Mass. 256, 264 (2008) (emphasis added).    \nAccordingly, once a sentence is lawfully imposed, the judicial branch, including this \nCourt under its superintendence and inherent powers, lacks the authority to modify sentences by \neither terminating a sentence early before it has been fully served or by directing that inmates \neligible for parole be placed on parole. See, e.g., Cole, 468 Mass. at 302–303 (“The granting of \nparole, or conditional release from confinement, is a discretionary act of the parole board. It is a \nfunction  of  the  executive  branch  of  government  with  which,  if  otherwise  constitutionally \nexercised, the judiciary may not interfere.”); see also Commonwealth v. Amirault, 415 Mass. \n17 \n \n\n112, 116–17 (1993) (“By allowing a motion to revise or revoke sentences when the parole board \ndoes not act in accordance with a judge's expectations, the judge is interfering with the executive \nfunction. The judge cannot nullify the discretionary actions of the parole board”). \nIn addition, by providing the broad relief of authorizing the release of inmates before the \nfull terms of their validly imposed state sentences have been served, this Court would essentially \nbe usurping the clemency powers that are held solely by the Governor of Massachusetts. See In \nre Opinion of Justices, 14 Mass. 472, 472 (1787) (emphasis added): \nthe General Court have not a right, in any case, to commute the punishment fixed by law, \nafter sentence has been given. Our opinion is founded upon the eighth article of the first \nsection of the second chapter of the frame of government, which article lodges the power \nof pardoning offences (except such as persons may be convicted of before the Senate, by \nan impeachment of the House) solely in the governor, by and with the advice of the \nCouncil; to which power the right of commuting punishment, if by such right be meant a \nright of pardoning upon condition of the convict's voluntarily submitting to a lesser \npunishment, must be a necessary incident. And we need not cite the last article of the \ndeclaration  of  rights;  which  means  to  keep  the  legislative,  executive,  and  judicial \ndepartments as separate and distinct as possible, in the exercise of the respective powers \nassigned them by the constitution. \n \nImportantly, this Court’s superintendence powers conferred by statute, see G.L. c. 211, § 3, only \nallow the Court to exercise those powers over all lower courts, and not over the function of the \nexecutive branch, which as discussed supra, solely holds the power to execute validly imposed \nsentences. See Doe v. Sex Offender Registry Bd, 480 Mass. 212, 221 n.3 (2018) (superintendence \nauthority of Supreme Judicial Court only empowers Court to exercise superintendence over \ncourts of inferior jurisdiction, not executive agencies) (emphasis added).  \nNor can this Court point to its “inherent and common law and constitutional powers to \nsupervise the administration of justice” and “protect and preserve the integrity of the judicial \nsystem” as grounds for providing the relief requested by the petitioners.  The “inherent powers” \nof the judiciary are “those whose exercise is essential to the function of the judicial department, \n18 \n \n\nto the maintenance of its authority, or to its capacity to decide cases.” Cole, 468 Mass. at \n302. The early release of inmates from their sentences cannot be said to be essential to the \nfunction  of  the  judicial  department,  maintenance  of  its  authority,  or  its  capacity  to  decide \ncases. See, e.g., Campatelli  v. Chief  Justice  of  Trial  Court,  468 Mass.  455,  475–476  (2014) \n(inherent  judicial  powers  flow  from  fundamental  principles  embedded  in  Massachusetts \nDeclaration of Rights, including right to prompt and impartial administration of justice, and \nexercise of these powers is essential to function of judicial department, to maintenance of its \nauthority, to its capacity to decide cases, and includes certain ancillary functions such as rule-\nmaking and judicial administration, including authority to control and supervise personnel within \njudicial  system,  power  to  control  actions  of  officers  of  the  court  and  environment  of \ncourt); Bower v. Bournay-Bower, 469 Mass. 690, 698 (2014) (same). \nD. The procedures currently in place, and being utilized, to protect incarcerated inmates \nand probationers from COVID-19 do not violate federal or state constitutional protections. \n \nTo succeed on an Eighth Amendment claim, the petitioners must demonstrate that “(1) a \nprison’s conditions of confinement present ‘a substantial risk of serious harm’; and (2) prison \nofficials acted with ‘deliberate indifference’ to inmate health or safety.”  Torres v. Comm’r of \nCorr.  427  Mass.  611,  613–614  (1998)  (suit  challenging  disciplinary  confinement),  (citing \nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994)).  See Langton v. Comm’r of Corr., 34 Mass. App. \nCt. 564, 572 (1993) (“In order to establish an Eighth Amendment violation, a plaintiff must \nprove that the defendants’ actions amounted to 'deliberate indifference to a serious medical \nneed.’”; considering tuberculosis outbreak). “While the rights guaranteed under art. 26 ‘are at \nleast equally as broad as those guaranteed under the Eighth Amendment,’ [] a prisoner seeking \nrelief under this provision [] must point to both (1) a condition or situation ‘which poses a \n19 \n \n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm’; and (2) facts establishing that a prison official ‘has knowledge \nof the situation and ignores it.’” Torres, 427 Mass. at 615–616. \nAn Eighth Amendment violation centered on medical treatment does not provide an \ninmate with release. See, e.g., Glaus v. Anderson, 408 F.3d 382, 387 (7th Cir. 2005) (“If an \ninmate established that his medical treatment amounts to cruel and unusual punishment, the \nappropriate remedy would be to call for proper treatment, or to award him damages; release from \ncustody is not an option.”); Gomez v. United States, 899 F.2d 1124, 1126 (11th Cir. 1990) (even \nwhere a prisoner proves mistreatment in prison that amounts to cruel and unusual punishment, \n“relief  of  an  Eighth  Amendment  violation  does  not  include  release  from  confinement”) \n“[R]elease from confinement is not a remedy available for an Eighth Amendment conditions of \nconfinement claim.” Hunt v. Johns, No. 5:10–HC–2176–FL, 2011 WL 3664553, at *2 (E.D.N.C. \nAug.18, 2011) (and cases cited therein); see also Gomez v. United States, 899 F.2d 1124, 1126 \n(11th Cir.1990) (in a habeas corpus context, court held that “relief of an Eighth Amendment \nviolation does not include release from confinement”).  \nThe petitioners’ assertion that “physical distancing and vigilant hygiene are impossible” \nin corrections settings is not borne out by reports from within these institutions. To be sure, the \nvirus presents a unique challenge in such settings and complete immunity from infection is, \nunfortunately, unlikely to be achieved, any more than it is in a myriad of other settings, ranging \nfrom shared homes to supermarkets. But, no doubt, informed to some extent by their experience \nwith prior disease outbreaks within their walls, the institutions have met this challenge with \nextensive measures commensurate with the heightened risk presented by COVID-19.  These \ninclude global health and safety precautions to prevent introduction and spread of the virus, \n20 \n \n\nmeasures  limiting  or eliminating  visitor  access,  quarantine  of those  who  are  sick  and  the \nidentification of those with whom they had been in contact. \nConclusion \nFor the  foregoing reasons,  the  seven district attorneys  will  continue to  represent the \nCommonwealth at any individualized hearing of an aggrieved incarcerated person or probationer, \npursuant to the established Rules of Criminal and Appellate Procedure, during this COVID-19 \npandemic, but respectfully suggest the petitioners' claims must be dismissed. \nRespectfully submitted, \nTHOMAS M.

QUINN III \nDISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR THE BRISTOL DISTRICT \n1.  I am Thomas M. Quinn III, I am the elected District Attorney for the Bristol District; \n2.  Since March 16, 2020, the Bristol District Attorney's Office has been operating at a \nreduced staffing level, however we have had Assistant District Attorneys interacting with \nthe Superior Court, each District Court, and the juvenile court on a daily basis. \n3.  I and my staff have spoken with supervisor's for the Bristol County Committee for Public \nCounsel services, a supervising attorney for the bar advocate program, privately retained \nattorneys and attorneys appointed to represent defendants on individual cases.  We have \nexplained how we are handling requests for release, arraignments and detention hearings \nfollowing the issuance of this Court's orders; \n4.  We have appeared in support of and in opposition to requests for release, based on the \nspecific facts of the case and all other relevant factors, including the danger posed \ngenerally as well as specifically by each defendant; \n5.  My staff is in regular contact with the superintendent of the Bristol County House of \nCorrection and the Ash Street Jail.  Prosecutors regularly convey the information we \nreceive from him, concerning the conditions and procedures in those facilities, to the \ncourts holding hearings on defendants' requests to be released.  I have been informed that \nthere has been a marked reduction in the population since March 16, 2020.  Based on \ninformation from the superintendent I believe that in the first four days of the week \nMarch 23rd,  the population decreased by 5%; \n24\n\n6.  I have been in contact with Chiefs of Police and I am also aware of the directives of the \nMassachusetts State Police concerning law enforcement activities in the community in \nresponse to the outbreak of coronavirus; \n7.  During the last two weeks, there have been marked decreases in the number of new cases \nbeing arraigned in the district courts across the county.  In calendar year 2019, an average \nweek of new case arraignments (total number of new cases/52 weeks) was as follows: \nAttleboro District Court -- 48.5; Fall River District Court - 118; New Bedford District \nCourt - 145.5; and Taunton District Court - 72.5 based on the information available to \nme, since the court reopened on March 18, 2020, after a two-day shutdown, there have \nbeen 50 arraignments in the district courts. 1  This number includes the arraignments of \ndefendants arrested following the close of court business on Friday, March 13, 2020, who \nwere not released by the clerk-magistrate or judge prior to March 18, 2020.  Based on our \ncurrent activity level, we are averaging 36 new cases coming into the court for all of \nBristol County, compared to 384.5 new cases per week in 2019.  Most of the defendants \nin these new cases have not been held on bail or detained, either because there was no \nrequest made or because the district court judge ordered the defendant's release.  The \nmajority of the business in the district court is comprised of hearings on defendants' \nmotions to be released from custody due to the coronavirus.  I am not aware of any \ndifficulties in the timely scheduling and hearing of these motions; \n8.  Bail reviews, appeals of detention orders pursuant to MGL ch. 276, 58A, and motions for \nrelease due to the coronavirus are being expeditiously processed, scheduled and heard in \nthe Superior Court.  An Assistant District Attorney assigned to the Superior Court \nappears telephonically on every case.  In my observation, there is nothing interfering with \nthe Superior Court's ability to hear these requests within one or two business days from \nthe filing of such a request; and \n9.  In my view the fair balance of defendant's rights, victim's rights and public safety can \nonly be met when these issues are considered during an individualized hearing before the \ncourt. \nSigned under the Pains and Penalties of Perjury, this 2ih day of March, 2020. \nTHOMAS M.

I,  Michael  O'Keefe,  am  the  District Attorney  for  the  Cape \nand  Islands  District.  The  District  includes  the  counties  of \nBarnstable,  Nantucket,  and  Dukes  County. \n2. The  Cape  and  Islands  District Attorney's  Office  is  staffed \nevery  day  and  has  been  throughout  the  COVID-19  timeframe. \n3.  The  Cape  and  Islands  District Attorney's  Office  will \ncontinue  to  address  time-sensitive motions  relating  to \nCOVID-19  and  assist  defense  attorneys  with  scheduling  on  a \ncase  by  case  basis,  pursuant  to  the  laws  and  regulations  of \nthe  Commonwealth.  See  G.L.  c.  126,  §  27;  G.L.  c.  127,  § \n49;  G.L.  c.  127,  §  119A;  G.L.  c.  127,  §  90A;  see  also \nCommonwealth  v.  Donohue,  452  Mass.  256  (2008) (holding  that \nSheriffs  have  discretion  to  release  inmates  with  GPS  if \ncompleted  a  reasonable  portion  of  incarceration);  but  see \nOrder  Concerning  the  Imposition  of  GPS  Monitoring,  OE-144 \n(GPS  only  to  be  imposed  when  there  is  a  compelling  public \nsafety  need). \n4.

DAWLEY \n___________________________________________________________ \n1. I, John T. Dawley, am the First Assistant District Attorney\nfor the Essex District Attorney’s Office.\n2. I am responsible for overseeing and managing the operation\nof the Office.  My responsibilities include supervision of\nall case-related and legal matters within the jurisdiction\nof the Essex District Attorney’s Office and supervision of\nSuperior Court cases.  The Deputy First Assistant District\nAttorney/Chief of District Courts and the Deputy Chief of\nthe District Courts are responsible for supervision of all\ncases in the eight district and four juvenile courts in\nEssex County.\n3. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Essex District\nAttorney’s Office, on a case by case basis, has been\nreviewing issues such as renewed requests to address bail\nand motions to revise and/or a revoke sentence.  The review\nprocess includes the nature of the case, reasons for the\nbail request, victim input, victim safety and medical\ndocumentation, if any.\n4. Starting on March 16, 2020, there has been an Assistant\nDistrict Attorney on duty each day at the Superior Court.\nThat Assistant District Attorney’s responsibilities include\n27\n\nbeing available in the morning to address any bail reviews \nbefore the Superior Court, which are heard by video \nconferencing, and being available in the afternoon to \naddress any bail hearings on Superior Court matters.  In \nother words, we are always available, including evenings, \nin every court. \n5. For Superior Court there have been fifteen emergency\npetitions from release filed; five have been heard, then\ndenied.  During one arraignment, our office factored in\nCOVID-19 virus concerns and agreed to release with\nconditions.  Bail reviews are taking place at which COVID-\n19 concerns are being generally broached and considered.\nIn one particular case involving a defendant charged with\ndomestic abuse and being held pursuant to G.L. c. 276,\n§ 58A, the defendant’s age and medical condition were\nconsidered with regard to COVID-19 concerns, but the\npetition was denied without prejudice due to the\ndefendant’s plan upon release and concerns for victim\nsafety.  In another case involving a § 58A detention, we\nreceived a request for review on the basis of health\nissues.  Due to the facts of the case, which included a\nrape of a child, we could not agree to release, but did\nagree to have the matter brought forward for an immediate\nhearing.\n6. Likewise, Assistant District Attorneys are available each\nday to argue motions via teleconference for all district\nand juvenile court locations.  Judges, clerks and probation\nhave staffed court sessions in Essex County District and\nJuvenile courthouses since the shutdown.  Motions for\nRelief are received by Assistant District Attorneys from\neither the Clerk-Magistrate or the defense attorney.  All\nare received via email.  Assistant District Attorneys are\ntypically prepared to argue these motions on the date they\nare received.  On the rare occasion that they are\ncontinued, it is agreed upon to ensure the petitions are\ncomplete.\n7. Often times, these requests lack sufficient information and\nthus do not facilitate a quick response.  We have\nendeavored to respond and gather the information as quickly\nas humanly possible given the Assistants’ juggling their\n2 \n28\n\nown COVID-19 related circumstances.  The process has never \nbeen delayed on our account. \n8. By way of example with regard to incomplete filings, in one\ncase, a defendant charged with Operating after Suspension,\nwhose bail was revoked on two open matters in another\ncounty, requested relief and release.  The petition did not\ninclude what the charges were in his other matters or a\ncopy of his CARI.  The prosecutor then requested that the\nattorney furnish the Commonwealth with the necessary\ninformation.  The open cases were Unlawful Possession of a\nLoaded Firearm and Possession of a Class “D” Substance with\nIntent to Distribute.\nSimilarly, in a Youthful Offender Case, the perpetrator,\nwas charged with three counts of Rape of a Child and one\ncount of Witness Intimidation.  He was originally released\non personal recognizance with GPS monitoring and no contact\nwith the victim.  His recognizance was revoked on March\nth\n12 .  The Motion was silent as to the reasons for the\nrevocation.  The Commonwealth later learned that he left\nhis home at 1:00AM and traveled to the area of the victim’s\nhome.  This was his second GPS violation.  The attorney had\nwritten on behalf of the Youthful Offender that “Mr. D is\nnot a danger to the community in that his revocation was\nnot related to those conditions which were meant to keep\nthe alleged victim safe.”\n9. In spite of these incomplete and sometimes misleading\nfilings, in most instances, Assistant District Attorneys\nargued the motions as requested by the Court.\n10. Additionally, we have agreed to conditions of release in\ntwo cases out of the Haverhill District Court and one case\nout of the Peabody District Court.  In one Haverhill case\nthe defendant was a participant in Essex County Sheriff\nKevin Coppinger’s Twenty-Eight Detoxification Program but\nappeared ready for the next step in his treatment plan.\nThe prosecutor agreed for the defendant to be released from\nthe custody of the Middleton House of Correction to allow\nhim to enter a residential treatment program.  In another\nHaverhill case, a defendant was assigned to the Sheriffs\nDetox Program and was ineligible.  The prosecutor agreed to\nhis petition for an alternate treatment program.  In the\n3 \n29\n\nPeabody case, we agreed that a female defendant should be \nreleased from the Sheriff’s Detox Program to enter a \ntreatment program. \n11.Thus far, approximately twenty-nine motions requesting\nrelease have been filed in the district court and juvenile\ncourts. Seventeen of those motions have had hearings.  The\nothers have been scheduled by the court.  We have only\nrequested a continuance in one case to obtain medical\nrecords from the Middleton House of Correction.  The motion\nfor continuance was denied.\n12.The Essex District Attorney’s Office thus remains available\nfor time-sensitive requests heard before all courts.  It is\nimportant to note that law enforcement is generating\nsubstantially fewer arrests amid the COVID-19 crisis and\nclerks are issuing summons for defendants to appear when\npossible.  Prosecutors remain available for the reduced\nnumber of arraignments that are occurring.\n13.Our office has also maintained daily contact with Essex\nSheriff Coppinger to monitor conditions at their\nfacilities.  He has assured us that he has taken all\nappropriate measures to protect the health of the\ninmates/detainees.  As of 2:30 P.M. this date, Sherriff\nCoppinger has informed this Office that one correctional\nofficer has tested positive for the virus, and has been\nordered to stay home and self-quarantine.\nth\nSigned under the penalties of perjury this 27  day of March, \n2020 at 2:30 P.M. \n/s/ John T. Dawley__ \nJohn T. Dawley  \n4 \n30\n\nAFFIDAVIT OF KEVIN F. COPPINGER \nI, Kevin F. Coppinger, 20 Manning Avenue, Middleton, MA 01949, on oath depose and \nstate as follows: \n1.  I am the duly elected Sheriff of Essex County and in that role I oversee operations \nat the Essex County Correctional Facilities in Middleton, Massachusetts, the Pre-Release Center \nin Lawrence, Massachusetts, and the Women in Transition Facility in Salisbury, MA, \n( collectively hereafter referred to as the \"Department\"}.  I was sworn into office on January 4, \n2017.  Prior to my tenure in Essex County, I was a Police Officer in the City of Lynn for 32 \nyears, serving the last 7 1h years as Chief of Police. \n2.  At present, Massachusetts is operating under a State of Emergency regarding \nCOVID-19.  In conjunction with the Governor's proclamation, the Essex County Sheriff's \nDepartment has been taking strong, proactive steps at all our facilities to ensure our work and \nliving environments are safe for all employees, visitors, and incarcerated individuals alike. \n3.  The following precautionary measures, designed to limit access to our facilities \nand to reduce possible exposure to COVID-19, has been put into effect and will remain so until \nfurther notice: \na.  All facilities have undergone a thorough deep-cleaning and these efforts \ncontinue daily on all three shifts at all locations.  Efforts are focused not \nonly on general access locations, but specific attention is given to areas \nsuch as door handles, countertops, light fixtures, or anywhere people \ntouch. \nb.  The Department has installed additional hand-sanitizing stations \n1 \n31\n\nthroughout all locations.  Inmates have also been given additional bars of \nsoap and educated on proper hand-washing and personal hygiene \ntechniques.  Signage, in both Spanish and English, has been posted \nthroughout our facilities with this information to keep these ideas fresh on \neveryone's mind. \nc.  The Department is ensuring it is well stocked with medical masks, gloves, \nand protective eyewear for staff.  Cleaning supplies remain at sufficient \nlevels while an inventory for all needs is conducted and updated daily. \nd.  All general public visitation has been suspended at our Middleton, \nLawrence, and Salisbury locations.  (Inmate access to telephones has been \nexpanded to offset the temporary loss of visits.  In addition, two free 30-\nminutes calls are being provided for each inmate weekly during this time.) \ne.  Attorney visits will continue in Middleton but will be non-contact visits. \nAttorney visits in Lawrence and Salisbury will also continue but will be \nmodified to respect \"social distancing\" for safety reasons. \nf.  All programming, via outside vendors/volunteers, at all three locations \nwill be suspended until further notice.  However, outside sources are \ncontinuing their programs by providing curriculum-based learning packets \nwhich the inmates can work on during their day.  Examples of these \ninclude but are not limited to: \n1.  Victim Impact \n11.  Relapse Prevention Strategies \n111.  Parenting Skills \n2 \n32\n\nIV.  Life Skills \nv.  Anger Management \nv1.  High Risk Offe nder \nVIL  Relationships and Family \nv111.  Cognitive Thinking \ng.  Programming conducted via internal resources, i.e. Department Chaplain, \ninmate \"peer-to-peer\" led groups, etc. will continue.  Counseling and \ntreatment for substance abuse and mental illness continues. \nh.  All volunteer visits of any type have been suspended. \n1.  All facility tours have been discontinued. \nJ.  The Inmate Work Release Program has been suspended. \nk.  Community Service Work Crews have been suspended. \n4.  The following operational procedures, designed to continue critical services to our \ninmate population, will remain in effect without change: \na.  Major outside vendors who provide critical services, i.e. Wellpath (our \nprimary health care provider), Acadia Healthcare, Aramark Food Services, \nSpectrum Health Systems, etc.  will remain operational at all facilities to \nserve the needs of the inmate population. \nb.  Medication Assisted Treatment will continue for eligible inmates per \nDepartment policy. \nc.  No disruption of routine medical care for inmates has been implemented. \nd.  Inmates residing in outside facilities such as sober houses, who have been \ndeemed to be at a greater risk living these due to their frequent interaction \n3 \n33\n\nwith other residents, have been returned to the Pre-Release Center where \ntheir health can be better monitored and their exposure limited. \n5.  The following housing and operational changes have been implemented to \nprovide additional protections to keep the COVID-19 virus out of our facilities: \na.  We have implemented an enhanced screening process at our Intake Unit to \nhelp detect signs of COVID-19.  WellPath has taken the lead on this \nworking closely with our staff.  This process has been in effect since early \nFebruary.  Inmates presenting with symptoms of COVID-19 are \nimmediately referred to additional medical screening. \nb.  We have thoroughly educated our staff as well as our inmates on MA \nDepartment of Public Health (DPH) and the Center for Disease Control \n(CDC) guidelines in this regard.  Employees coming to work are asked a \nspecific set of questions regarding their well-being upon arrival.  We are \nawaiting delivery of infra-red thermometers and these will become part of \nthe entry screening process as soon as they arrive. \nc.  Employees have been educated that if they are sick with a fever or have \nflu-like symptoms such as cough, sore throat, or shortness of breath, they \nshould not report to work and should consult their doctor.  Inmates have \n~lso been educated in their regard and encouraged to request health care \nservices if symptoms present themselves. \nd.  Separate male and female \"safekeep\" areas have been designated to house \nlocal police department prisoners prior to arraignment.  Police \nDepartments have been asked to implement COVID-19 screening \n4 \n34\n\nprocedures at their stations prior to anyone being transported to our \nfacilities. \ne.  A \"New Man\" unit has been set up internally at our Middleton facility to \nhouse new Pre-Trial and/or Sentenced inmates for a 14-day period to \nmonitor for signs of COVID-19. \nf.  Our Medical Housing Unit, operated by WellPath, is equipped with two \n\"negative pressure\" rooms to assist with treatment/screening of potential \nCOVID-19 cases.  Routine medical care is also available 24/7. \ng.  We have plans in place, and logistics identified, should this pandemic \nincrease in severity and if it does, in fact, enter our jail.  These plans have \nbeen developed between our staff and our health care providers following \nDPH and CDC guidelines. \nh.  We have contacted judges and other court personnel to strongly consider \nusing video conferencing in lieu of inmate transports to/from courts.  This \nrequest was made prior to the recent shut down of the courts and it is \nhoped the courts will consider using video conferencing for health and \nsafety purposes more frequently even after this crisis subsides. \n6.  We have activated our Incident Command System (JCS) to help focus on our \ncontinued preparedness and readiness to deal with this pandemic.  The team is in constant \ncommunication with federal, state, and local health care authorities as well as other resources. \nICS allows us to have a centralized command to oversee and coordinate a Department-wide safe \nand effective response. \n7.  History has shown us that many times, upon release from incarceration, inmates \n5 \n35\n\nfrequently rely on public homeless shelters and soup kitchens to meet their daily needs.  Worse \nyet, many inmates return to living on the streets. Given the current circumstances under which \nwe all live at present, I would suggest those life-sustaining necessities are better provided by the \nSheriffs Department for those in our custody. \n8.  A substantial component of any successful re-entry program, and one which I \nstrongly support, is community-based programming and housing for recently released inmates. \nWhile I cannot offer an opinion on the status of community-based initiatives during our current \nState of Emergency, I do believe that inmates suffering from Substance Abuse Disorders or \nMental Illness, which make up a substantial portion of our incarcerated population, would be at \ngreater risk in the community if these services were not provided. \n9.  The impact and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic are changing every day.  Even \nthe greatest minds in the medical community have admitted they do not know the full extent of \nwhere this will leave us.  The Essex County Sheriffs Department will continue to monitor this \ncrisis in partnership with our federal, state, and local partners focusing on best practices in health \ncare and corrections for the health and safety of all who work or reside in our facilities. \nThe facts recited herein are based upon my personal knowledge. \nSIGNED UNDER THE PAINS AND PENAL TIES OF PERruRY THIS 24th DAY OF \nMARCH 2020. \n6 \n36\n\nCOMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS \nSUPREME JUDICIAL COURT FOR \nTHE COMMONWEALTH \nSUFFOLK, ss.

GULLUNI \nDISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR THE HAMPDEN-DISTRICT \nI, Anthony D. Gulluni, District Attorney for the Hampden District, do hereby state the \nfollowing: \n1.  I am sworn as the District Attorney for the Hampden District. In that capacity, I am the \nchief law enforcement officer for Hampden County, encompassing twenty-three (23) \ncities and towns with an estimated population of 468,000. \n2.  There are eight (8) courts in the Hampden District in which my staff of assistant \ndistrict attorneys regularly appear: Hampden County Superior Court, Chicopee District \nCourt, Holyoke District Court, Palmer District Court, Springfield District Court, \nWestfield District Court, Holyoke Juvenile Court and Springfield Juvenile Court. A \nmember of my staff appears in these courts every day.  We have been working \nthroughout the COVID-19 timeframe, when each court is in session. \n3.  I, and my assistant district attorneys, have addressed, and will continue to address, \nemergency motions relating to COVID-19 brought by defendants who have cases \noriginating in the Hampden District.  I have instructed my staff that we should \nconsider each motion on a case-by-case basis, with our duty to victims, public safety, \nand the wellness of those incarcerated, particularly those defendants who have \nidentified, with specificity and substance, age and/or medical condition(s) that would \nput them at a higher risk if the virus were contracted. \n4.  I, and members of my office, have been in constant contact with the Hampden County \nSheriff's Department when individuals have been identified as appropriate for release \nor transfer to lower security and/or day reporting on a GPS bracelet. \n37\n\n5. I have designated one of my first assistant district attorneys and an administrative \nassistant to coordinate our office's response to these motions to promote consistency \nand fairness in our consideration of them.  I have discussed these measures with \nleadership in the defense bar in Hampden County, and parties have worked \ncooperatively to ensure these motions are heard.  I am confident that police, \ncorrections officials and prosecutors will continue to act in good faith and exercise \nreasonable judgment in the performance of their duties amid this virus that has \naffected us all. \nSigned under the pains and penalties of perjury, this J7day of March, 2020. \nthony D.

I am the duly elected Sheriff of Hampden County in the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts. \n2.  At present, Massachusetts is operating under a State of Emergency regarding \nCOVID-19.  In conjunction with the Governor's proclamation, the Hampden County Sheriffs \nDepartment has been taking strong, proactive steps at all our facilities to ensure our work and \nliving environments are safe for all employees and our justice involved population. \n3.  Currently the population of our facilities is well below maximum capacity, \nallowing us plenty of space to house individuals and maintain social distancing practices. \n4.  At this time, no member of our justice involved population have tested positive \nfor COVID-19. \n5.  With input from our medical team under the leadership of Dr. Thomas Lincoln, \nand our Infectious Disease Nurse Stephanie Burgess, and in accordance with guidelines from the \nDepartment of Public Health  (DPH), and the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the following \nprecautionary measures, designed to limit access to our facilities and to reduce possible exposure \nto COVID-19, have been put into effect and will remain so until further notice: \nCLEANING AND SANITIZATION EFFORTS \na.  All facilities have undergone a thorough deep-cleaning and these efforts \ncontinue daily on all three shifts at all locations.  Efforts are focused not \nonly on general access locations, but specific attention is given to areas \n39\n\nsuch as door handles, countertops, light fixtures, and all other commonly \nused surfaces.  All cells are deep cleaned and sanitized and no one is \nallowed to occupy the cell for 24 hours after this process is completed. \nb.  The Department has installed additional hand-sanitizing stations throughout \nall locations.  Inmates have unlimited access to bars of soap and have been \neducated on proper hand-washing and personal hygiene techniques. \nSignage has been posted throughout our facilities with this infonnation to \nkeep these ideas fresh on everyone's mind. \nc.  The Department is ensuring it is well stocked with medical masks, gloves, \ngowns and protective eyewear for staff and our jail and house of \ncorrections populations when necessary.  Cleaning supplies remain at \nsufficient levels while an inventory for all needs is conducted and updated \ndaily . \n. d.  All transportation vehicles are sanitized after each use, and the interior of \nevery department vehicle has been sanitized. \nVISITING POLICY CHANGES \ne.  All general public visitation has been suspended at all Hampden County \nfacilities. No tours are allowed.  Access to telephones has been expanded \nto offset the temporary loss of visits, and our population now receives 2 \nhours of free phone calls per week.  Our population also receives 3 free \nenvelopes per week to send letters to their loved ones. Additionally, we are \nproviding video visitation for some of our population.  We are currently \nworking on expanding the technology and infrastructure with the goal of \n2 \n40\n\nproviding this option to everyone as soon as possible. \nf.  Attorney visits are non-contact only.  Attorneys are screened by our staff \nand are required to wear a mask before entering any facility. \ng.  In an effort to reduce attorney visits where possible, we have developed a \nsystem whereby attorneys can send emails to specific staff members in \norder to set up specific times for phone calls with their clients. \nh.  There will be no property pick-ups until further notice.  The regular 30 day \ntime limit to pick up property will be extended.  Individuals will be able to \npick up property within 60 days from the time property pick up resumes. \ni.  All volunteer visits of any type have been suspended \nPROGRAMMING \nJ.  All programming, via outside vendors/volunteers, at all locations has been \nsuspended until further notice. However, trained Sheriffs department staff \ncontinue to provide programs while ensuring social distancing is being \npracticed.  Examples of programming include but are not limited to: \nVictim Impact, Relapse Prevention Strategies, Parenting Skills, Life \nSkills, Anger Management, High Risk Offender Engagements, \nRelationships and Family, Cognitive Thinking, Peer to Peer led groups, \nDomestic Violence, Self Help Strategies, Violence Prevention, Dialectical \nBehavioral Therapy Groups, Release Planning, Creative Writing, Healthy \nCommunication, Understanding Grief, and Mindfulness \nk.  Counseling and treatment for substance abuse and mental illness continues. \nI.  The Inmate Work Release Program has been suspended until further notice. \n3 \n41\n\nSCREENING/MEDICAL \nm.  The Department has kept non-essential employees from reporting to work \nin accordance with the Governor's order. \nn.  Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) will continue for eligible inmates \nper Department policy. \no.  There has been no disruption of routine medical care for the population \np.  All mental health screening, referrals, evaluations and support continue \nwithout interruption. \nq.  We are currently using telemedicine to connect our population to outside \nmedical consultations when necessary. \nr.  The Evaluation and Stabilization Unit (ESU) remains open and fully \noperational for mental health treatment and support. \ns.  Day Reporting participants continue to reside at home or in a program on \nday reporting status. \nl.  We have implemented enhanced screening processes at our \nIntake/Discharge Department to help detect potential signs of COVID-19. \nOur medical department, led by Doctor Thomas Lincoln and Infectious \nDisease Nurse Stephanie Burgess, have worked closely with our staff to \ntrain them to recognize concerning signs and symptoms.  Inmates \npresenting with symptoms of COVID-19 are immediately referred to \nadditional medical screening. \nu.  If, after medical screening, there is a concern that the patient is exhibiting \nsigns and or symptoms indicative of potential infection by COVID-19 \nvirus, those individuals are placed in single cells in a specialized medical \n4 \n42\n\nquarantine area for further monitoring and observation. \nv.  We have thoroughly educated our staff, as well as our inmates, on \nMassachusetts (DPH) and (CDC) guidelines in this regard.  All staff were \nrequired to participate in a mandatory training that addresses the issue of \nprevention and spread of COVID-19.  These trainings have been offered \nelectronically to all staff. \nw.  Employees coming to work are asked a specific set of questions regarding \ntheir well-being upon arrival and questions about recent travel by them or \ntheir household members. In addition, medial staff takes employee and \nstaff body temperatures to screen for fever prior to their entrance into the \nfacilities. \nx.  Employees have been educated that if they are sick with a fever or have \nflu-like symptoms such as cough, sore throat, or shortness of breath, they \nshould not report to work and they are instructed to contact their supervisor \nto report symptoms and to consult their doctor. \ny.  If an employee is sent home with concerning symptoms, they must follow a \nmedical screening process in order to return to work.  Employees who have \nfamily members who have travelled to high risk areas, or are exhibiting \nsigns and symptoms of the virus have been asked to stay at home until they \nare medically cleared to return to work. \nz.  Our inmate population have also been educated with regard to recognizing \nsymptoms of COVID-19 and have been encouraged to request health care \nservices if symptoms present themselves. \n5 \n43\n\naa. Our medical staff is conducting in person screening of our population in all \nareas that have had no outside exposure to the virus. \nbb. We have set up a COVID-19 mailbox as a platform to receive and respond \nto all employee and staff inquiries on safety, health, and disease prevention. \nHOUSING \ncc. Separate \"safe keep\" areas have been designated to house local police \ndepartment arrestees prior to arraignment.  Police Departments have been \nasked to implement COVID-19 screening procedures at their stations prior \nto anyone being transported to our facilities.  All arrestees are given a more \nin depth screening upon arrival to the facilities and prior to being brought \nto a housing area. \ndd. Separate Housing Units have been set up at our facilities to house new Pre \nTrial and/or Sentenced inmates for a minimum 14-day period to monitor \nfor signs of COVID-19.  Since March 131h there has been no co-mingling of \nnew intakes and the pre-existing population. \nee.  The Department has limited unnecessary movement within and between \nits facilities. \nff.  Medical care is available 24/7. \nCOURTS \ngg. We are conducting video conferencing daily with the local courts for \narraignments, and all other non-evidentiary proceedings. \nhh. Additionally we have the ability to conduct evidentiary hearings by video \nconference and the courts have conducted dangerousness hearings and \nsection 35 civil commitment proceedings by video conference. \n6 \n44\n\nCOLLABORATION WITH CRIMINAL DEFENSE BAR, \nDISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICES AND THE COURTS TO \nIDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS APPROPRIATE FOR RELEASE \nii.  We are in constant daily contact with the local defense bar, the District \nAttorney's office and the courts to identify individuals who are appropriate \nfor release or transfer to lower security and/or day reporting on a OPS \nbracelet and we have honored these request when appropriate. \njj.  We are responding to requests to review individuals with low bails who \nmay be at risk, and assisting them with finding resources to bail out once a \ndischarge plan is in place. \nkk, Our population continues to receive earned good time.  We have been able \nto continue participation in appropriate programming to allow the \nopportunity for  earned good-time with the use of technology and other \nresources. \nII.  We are providing video conferencing for parole to ensure continuation of \nthat process. \nEMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PREPARATIONS \nmm. We have plans in place, and logistics identified, should this pandemic \nenter our jail and house of corrections facilities.  These plans have been \ndeveloped between our staff and our health care providers following DPH \nand CDC guidelines. \nnn. We have created a Command Response Team to help focus on our \ncontinued preparedness and readiness to deal with this pandemic.  The \nteam is in constant communication with federal, state, and local health care \nauthorities as well as other resources.  This team allows us to have a \n7 \n45\n\ncentralized command to oversee and coordinate a Department-wide safe \nand effective response. \noo. The Command Response Team and the Sheriff and his Superintendent have \ndaily telephone conferences with the Medical and Health Services Team, \nthe department's Health and Safety Officer, and department's staff from \nHuman Resources, Housing Unit Directors,  Food Services, Transportation, \nWarehouse and Supplies, Purchasing, Information Systems and \nTechnology, Standards, Compliance, and Legal. \npp.  Two department staff members report to the regional MEMA Command \nCenter in Agawam Massachusetts on a daily basis to provide assistance and \nobtain updates and critical supplies. \nCONCERNS FOR THE SAFETY OF INDIVIDUALS RELEASED INTO THE \nCOMMUNITY WITHOUT A DISCHARGE PLAN \n6.  As Sheriff of Hampden County I am gravely concerned about the prospect of a \nblanket release of our population for several reasons as set forth below: \n•  Eighty-seven percent (87%) of the individuals in our custody suffer from \nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD), and approximately Forty-three percent \n(43%) from mental health issues, twenty-five percent (25%) suffer from \nco-occurring disorders, and many have a plethora of other health issues. \nThese inmates have access to very good health care and treatment 24 \nhours a day, seven days a week. I am sadly aware based on my 28 years \nworking for the Hampden County Sheriffs Department that many of the \nindividuals we have in our custody receive far better treatment while they \nare with us than they do when they are in their communities. \n8 \n46\n\n•  The unfortunate reality is that the population we serve is highly \nsusceptible to engaging in behaviors that threaten their physical and \nmental well-being.  This is why a thorough discharge plan that involves \nthe necessary triad that includes employment, housing and wrap around \nservices is key to a successful and healthy re-entry back into the \ncommunity.  It would be disastrous to discharge individuals without an \nappropriate release plan. Many of the needed support services agencies in \nthe community are currently either closed or have very limited access. \nSheriffs  Department efforts to ensure our offender population is \nconnected to the appropriate community services right now is extremely \ndifficult because of the measures the Commonwealth has had to put into \nplace to protect its citizens.  With limited housing and employment \nopportunities our men and women will be forced back into leading \nlifestyles that will cause them to reoffend such as stealing, substance use, \nand seeking the comfort of others who behave similarly.  This will place \nadditional pressures on our law enforcement efforts in the community \nwhen our officers have been trying to minimize interactions that result in \ncontact and potential arrest that may not have otherwise occurred but for \nthe premature release of that individual into the community. \n•  Many of our population are homeless, and if returned to the streets or to \nthe already crowded homeless shelters, they are far more likely to acquire \nand spread the COVID-19 virus.  Many are without health insurance and \nrun the risk of losing access to health care ifwe are unable to ensure that \nthey regain their Mass Health benefits prior to their release.  Many are on \n9 \n47\n\nmedication assisted treatment (MAT).  If released without an appointment \nin the community for MAT they will be at significant risk for overdose \nand death. \n•  At this point Jetting people out ofj ail indiscriminately is not the right thing \nto do. Those that make up our population are very vulnerable to relapse \nand contracting many illnesses, and in particular the COVID-19 \nvirus.  Currently, our population of men and women are in a controlled, \nsafe, and healthy environment and in many cases should remain there for \ntheir wellbeing. \n•  I recognize that this virus has a mind of its own, and this pandemic is like \nnothing most of us have seen in our lifetimes.  Things are constantly \nevolving, and I know we will be faced with new challenges each day and \nthe way in which we respond to those challenges will always be with the \nhealth and safety of our population, staff, and the citizens of Hampden \nCounty in mind. \n•  Hampden County Sheriffs Department will continue to monitor this crisis \nin partnership with our federal, state, and local partners focusing on best \npractices in health care and corrections for the health and safety of all who \nwork or reside in our facilities. \nIO \n48\n\nThe facts recited herein are based upon my personal knowledge. \nSIGNED UNDER THE PAINS AND PENALTIES OF PERJURY THIS 261h  DAY OF \nMARCH 2020. \n- ~~ \nNie  o as  occ \n1 \nHampden County Sheriff \n11 \n49\n\nAffidavit of Dr. Thomas Lincoln \nI hereby depose and say: \n1.  My name is Thomas Lincoln, and I am a physician licensed to practice in the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts.  I received my medical degree from the \nUniversity of Massachusetts Medical School in 1989.  I have attached my \nCurriculum Vitae as support of my education, training, and experience, and \nqualifications to render an opinion on the matters discussed below. \n2.  I am the Medical Director for the Hampden County Sheriffs Department.  I have \nheld this position for 27 years. \n3.  I am familiar with the evolving standard of care required in order to safely address, \ntreat and prevent the spread of infectious diseases including COVID-19 within a \njaiJ and house of corrections setting. \n4.  Based on my training and experience as a physician who has practiced within the \ncorrectional environment and my training and experience as a practicing physician \nin the community, it is my professional opinion to a reasonable degree ofm  edical \ncertainty that the Hampden County Sheriff's Department is currently well prepared \nand equipped to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within its facilities, provide the \nappropriate medical screening and monitoring necessity for staff and the justice \ninvolved population, and to provide care and treatment for high risk patients \n5.  Based on my training and experience as a physician who has practiced within the \ncorrectional environment and my training and experience as a practicing physicf an \nin the community, it is my professional opinion to a reasonable degree of medical \ncertainty, that the indiscriminate release of our jail and house of corrections \npopulation could likely put those already health compromised  individuals at a \n&'Teater risk of contracting COVID-19 and perpetuating its further spread without . \nproper discharge and release planning. \n6.  Based on my training and experience as a physician who has practiced within the \ncorrectional environment and my training and experience as a practicing physician \nin the community, it is my professional opinion to a reasonable degree of medical \ncertainty, that because there is currently even more limited access to residential \nprograms and facilities offering Medication Assisted Treatment, the individuals \nwho suffer from Substance Use Disorder are at a significant risk of overdose and \ndeath if they are released without an appropriate discharge plan and community \nresources. \n50\n\n7.  Our medical team is working around the clock to make sure we are doing \neverything we should to keep our population safe and prevent a COVID-19 \noutbreak behind the walls. \n8.  Over the 27 years that I have been a physician with the Hampden County Sheriffs \nDepartment, we have encountered and managed a variety of public health crises \nwith attention to both the health of those currently incarcerated and their health \nupon return to the free community with a community-oriented public health model \nof care.  We are doing the same now with respect to the COVID-19 virus.  We are \nfollowing the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control, the Department of \nPublic Health, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency and the World \nHealth Organization. \n9.  I am confident that the protocols put into place at the Hampden County Sheriffs \ndepartment and outlined in Sheriff Cocchi' s affidavit will help us manage this \ncrisis effectively. \n10. I am in favor of considering for release, on a case by case basis, those who may do \nwell in the community and have appropriate discharge planning.  My \nunderstanding is that Sheriff Cocchi and his staff are currently doing this, in that \nthe Department is in daily contact with the local defense bar, the District \nAttorney's office and the courts to identify individuals who are appropriate for \nrelease or transfer to lower security and/or day reporting on a GPS bracelet and are \nhonoring these requests when appropriate, as well as responding to requests to \nreview individuals with low bails who may be at risk, and assisting them with \nfinding resources to bail out once a discharge plan is in place. \nSigned under the pains and penalties of perjury this .:z.e,.-t'-day of  Mo..rcfv..  • 2020 \n~ L Y  \n\"'-Z \nThomas Lincoln, M.D. \n51\n\nThomas Lincoln, M.D. \nDepartment of Medicine \nBaystate Medical Center \nBaystate Brightwood Health Center \n380 Plainfield St. \nSpringfield, MA 01107 \n( 413) 794-4458 \nthomas.lincoln@baystatehealth.org \nEducation \nM.D., University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA  1989 \nB.A., Physics, Wesleyan University, Middletown, CT  1983 \nPostdoctoral Training \nResident in Internal Medicine, Baystate Medical Center, Tufts University School of  1989-1992 \nMedicine, Springfield, MA \nAcademic Appointments \nAdjunct Faculty, Physician Assistant Program, Springfield Co1lege, Springfield, MA  1998-present \nAssistant Professor of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Tufts University School of  1992-present \nMedicine, Springfield, MA \nOther Positions and Employment \nAttending Physician, Division of General Medicine and Community Health, Department of  1992-present \nMedicine, Baystate Brightwood Health Center, Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, MA \nResearch Assistant, Cardiac Care and Helicopter Transport Study, University of  1986-1987 \nMassachusetts Medical Center, Worcester, MA \nResearch Assistant.

I,  Lynn  Beland,  am  the  First Assistant  District  Attorney \nfor  the  Norfolk  District Attorney's  Office. \n2. My  responsibilities  in  this  position  include  supervision  of \nall  case-related  and  legal matters  within  the  jurisdiction \nof  the  Norfolk  District Attorney's  Office,  and  includes \ndirect  supervision  of  Superior  Court  cases. \n3.  In  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  Norfolk  District \nAttorney's  Office  has  been,  and  remains  willing,  on  a  case \nby-case  basis,  to  review,  on  a  renewed  request  to  address \nbail,  the  nature  of  a  case  and  any  medical  documentation, \nand  would  assist  counsel  in  requesting  hearings. \n4.  Starting  on  March  18,  2020,  there  has  been  an  Assistant \nDistrict Attorney  on  duty  each  day  at  the  Superior  Court. \nThat  Assistant  District Attorney's  responsibilities  include \nbeing  available  in  the  morning  to  address  any  bail  reviews \nfrom  the  Superior  Court,  which  are  heard  by  video \nconferencing,  and  being  available  in  the  afternoon  to \naddress  any  bail  hearings  on  Superior  Court  matters. \n5. As  example,  to  the  best  of my  knowledge  and  belief,  on \nThursday,  March  19,  2020,  the  Norfolk  District  Attorney's \nOffice  agreed  to  reduce  bail  from  $2500  to  personal \nrecognizance  for  three  defendants  based  on  the  nature  of \nthe  indictment,  distribution  of  a  class  D  substance.  On \nthat  same  day,  a  justice  of  the  Norfolk  Superior  Court \n73\n\ndenied  a  bail  reduction  on  an  indictment  for  a  c.209A \nviolation. \n6. On  Friday,  March  20,  2020  a  justice  of  the  Norfolk  Superior \nCourt  reduced  the  bail  of  a  defendant  indicted  for  rape \nfrom  $7500  to  $3000  with  conditions. \n7.  On  Monday,  March  23,  2020,  a  justice  of  the  Norfolk \nSuperior  Court  allowed  a  bail  review  hearing  after  a \nfinding  of  dangerousness  under  G.L.  c.  276,  §SBA  where  the \ndefendant  requested  review  due  to  COVID-19.  The  judge \nallowed  hearing  in  this  matter  and  took  the  motion  under \nadvisement.  To  the  best  of  my  knowledge  and  belief  at  least \ntwo  other  bail  hearings  based  strictly on  COVID-19  were \nheard  in  Norfolk  Superior  Court  this  week. \n8. The  Norfolk  District Attorney's  Office  remains  willing  to \nassist  counsel  in  having  time-sensitive  requests  heard \nbefore  a  court.  As  example,  in  consultation  with  a  trial \ncourt  assistant  district  attorney  this  Office  will  agree  to \nreduce  bail  on  a  prosecution  for  operating  under  the \ninfluence,  subsequent  offense.  This  Office  has  also \nreceived  a  request  for  review  of  the  detention  of  an \nindividual  held  on  dangerousness  under  G.L.  c.  276,  §SBA, \nfrom  the  attorney-in-charge  designated  as  critical  due  to \nhealth  issues.  Due  to  the  facts  of  the  case,  which  included \na  stabbing,  this  Office  would  not  agree  to  release,  but  did \nagree  to  have  the  matter  brought  forward  for  hearing  and \nsuggested  the  attorney put  the  case  on  the  list  for  Friday, \nMarch  27,  2020.  I  am  also  aware  of  a  second  case,  where \nthis  Office  will  oppose  based  on  the  facts  of  the  case, \nwhich  also  included  a  stabbing,  and  the  matter  is  being \nbrought  forward  for  hearing  on  Friday March  27,  2020. \nSigned  under  the  pains  and  penalties  of  perjury. \nLt1~KtkMa \nf \nLynn  Beland \n74\n\nCOMMONWEALTH  OF  MASSACHUSETTS \nSUFFOLK,  ss.

In  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  Norfolk  District \nAttorney's  Office  has  been,  and  remains  willing,  on  a  case \nby-case  basis,  to  review,  on  a  renewed  request  to  address \nbail,  the  nature  of  a  case  and  any  medical  documentation, \nand  would  assist  counsel  in requesting  hearings. \n4. Since  the  onset  of  emergency  measures  imposed  by  the \nAdministrative  Office  of  the  Trial  Courts,  there  has  been \nan  Assistant  District Attorney  and  victim witness  advocate \nassigned  each  day  to  every  district court  in Norfolk  County \nfor  the  purpose  of  addressing  new  and  emergency  matters, \nwhich  includes  reviewing  motions  on  a  case-by-case  basis  to \naddress  pre-trial detention. \n5. There  have  been  approximately  fifteen  requests  that  have \ncome  to my  attention that  have  raised  COVID-19  as  a  reason \nto  address  bail  and/or  custody  concerns.  In  eleven  hearings \nthe  Norfolk  District Attorney's  Office  and  the  defendant \ncame  to  an  agreement  leaving  four  cases  outstanding. \n6. On  March  19,  2020,  in  response  to  a  request  from  the \nattorney-in-charge  for  the  Committee  for  Public  Counsel \n75\n\nServices  for  Norfolk  County  to  address  cases  where \nindividuals  were  being  held pending  adjudication  of \noutstanding  criminal  matters,  I  immediately  indicated  the \nwillingness  of  the  Norfolk  District  Attorney's  Office  to \nwork  with  any member  of  the  defense  bar  to  address,  on  a \ncase-by-case  basis,  individual  concerns  with  COVID-19.  I \nreiterated this  willingness  on  March  24,  2020.  A  list of \nsuch  individuals  was  received  from  the  attorney-in-charge \non  March  25,  2020  and  I  am  currently working  with  assistant \ndistrict attorneys  assigned  to  the  individual  courts  to \npull  the  files  so  each  case  can  be  reviewed  to  see  if \nagreement  can  be  reached.  We  are  attempting  to  prioritize \nindividuals  who  have  expressed  health  concerns. \n7.

CRUZ \n1.  I, Timothy J. Cruz, am the District Attorney for the Plymouth District. \n2.  Assistant District Attorneys, victim advocates and administrative staff in the \nPlymouth County District Attorney's Office are responsible for handling cases in \ntwo Superior Court locations (Brockton and Plymouth); four District/Juvenile \nCourt locations (Brockton, Plymouth, Hingham, and Wareham), as well as at the \nAppeals Court, The SJC, the Parole Board, and at mental health hearings at \nBridgewater State Hospital.  In response to the coronavirus pandemic, we have \ninitiated and implemented a variety of measures designed to ensure that we are \nresponsive to the court's schedule and compliant with Trial Court directives; that \nwe are appearing at and participating in all court proceedings; that we are \nupholding our sworn duty to the people and communities we serve; and that we \nare doing all of that in a way that respects the rights of victims and defendants, \nand seeks to protect the health and welfare of our colleagues and members the \npublic. \n3.  The Plymouth County District Attorney1s Office has been staffed, every day, to \ncover proceedings in each of the courts in our county. We have established and \nmaintained a schedule that provides full coverage of all court proceedings. \n4.  We have abided by and adhered to the Orders issued by the Trial Court during \nthis crisis. \n77\n\n5.  Our prosecutors have worked in good faith with defense counsel and the courts \nto schedule hearings on matters including (without limitation): bail reviews; \nviolation of probation hearings; arraignments; SSA appeals, and requests for \nreconsideration of custody determinations.  In addition, we have fulfilled our \nobligations as they relate to parole and appellate litigation. It is my \nunderstanding that we have participated in every single court event scheduled by \nthe court during this period.  In those proceedings, as always, we have \nprofessionally advocated our position on the issue at hand and have respected \nthe rulings issued by the judge. There have been no occasions in which \n· representatives of our office were unavailable, unwilling, or unprepared to \nrepresent the Commonwealth in any court proceeding. We cooperate fully in the \nprocess of scheduling of hearings with court personnel and defense attorneys. \nSince on or about March 16, 2020 we have participated in approximately 20 \nSuperior Court cases affecting the custodial status of a defendant. \n6.  Since on or about March 16, 2020 there has been a significant increase in police \nuse of summons, decrease in custodial arrests, and a significant increase in \npersonal recognizances rather than bail. \n7.  Notwithstanding the challenges and restrictions engendered by these \nextraordinary circumstances, Plymouth County District Attorney's Office \nprosecutors, victim advocates and administrative personnel have (as always) \nsteadfastly and successfully endeavored to ensure that we comply diligently and \npromptly with all directives from the Trial Court, that we have zealously and \nfairly articulated our position in all cases heard, that we have discharged our \nduties under the Victim's Bill of Rights, and that we have taken steps to ensure \nthat defendants, pretrial detainees, and inmates are afforded all of their rights \nduring this crisis. We are committed to doing so throughout the duration of this \ndifficult situation. \nSigned under the pains and penalties of perju  f March, 2020. \nTi mo thy J. Cruz \nDistrict Attorney \n78\n\nAFFIDAVIT OF SHERIFF JOSEPH D. McDONALD, JR. \nI, Joseph D. McDonald, Jr., depose and state the following of my own knowledge: \n1.  I am the Sheriff of Plymouth County.  I have held that office since January of \n2005.  Prior to my election, I was an attorney in private practice and then an \nassistant district attorney.  I have been an attorney since 1991. \n2.  The primary mission of the Sheriffs Depaiiment is the operation of the Plymouth \nCounty Conectional Facility.  The safety of the persons committed to the \nDepartment's care and custody, the staff, and the public is of paramount \nimportance. \n3.  The Depaiiment takes very seriously its obligation to provide proper medical care \nto the inmates at the Facility.  The Depaiiment maintains a full-time medical staff \nwhich is on duty 24-7.  The Depaiiment contracts with a vendor to provide an on \nsite physician.  Additionally, the Department has contacts with hospitals \nthroughout the greater Boston area to provide specialty or advanced care as \nneeded.  Beth Israel Deaconess Plymouth community hospital is located within \none mile of the Facility. \n4.  The Department has taken special precautions to protect inmates and staff from \nexposure to the Coronavirus.  These precautions include: \na.  Beginning in February, the Depa1iment enhanced its inmate intake \nprocedure to obtain additional information about travel and exposure to \nillness. \nb.  The Depaiiment has adopted treatment and detection practices consistent \nwith guidelines from the Center for Disease Controls (\"CDC\") and \nDepaiiment of Public Health (\"DPH\").  The Depaiiment' s health services \nadministrator is in frequent contact with DPH and consults them on the \nchallenges facing the Department. \nc.  The Department suspended visits by friends, families, and volunteers.  To \nassist with the transition, the Depaiiment airnnged with its telephone \nvendors to provide two free calls per week. \nd.  The Depaiiment restricted attorney visits to non-contact.  The Depaiiment \ndisabled monitoring and recording functions for visit phones. \ne.  The Depaiiment has kept non-essential staff from entering the Facility, \nconsistent with the governor's order for executive staff. \nf.  The Depaiiment has ceased inmate assignments to the farm operation, \ncommunity work crew, and other work details outside the Facility. \n79\n\ng.  The Department has eliminated unnecessary movement within the \nFacility. \nh.  The Department established a housing unit for newly admitted inmates \nand inmates who leave and return to the Facility, to monitor for signs and \nsymptoms of the virus.  Inmates remain in the unit until they clear the \nincubation period. \nThe Department has worked with Trial Court officials to limit travel \n1. \noutside the Facility by conducting hearings by videoconference and \ntelephone.  This greatly has reduced travel to and from the Facility and \nresulting potential exposure. \nJ.  The Depaiiment has changed recreation and meal schedules to provide \nmore space in the dayrooms. \nk.  The Depaiiment maintains an aggressive cleaning schedule for the \nhousing units and conducts daily sanitation of transp01iation vans. \nI.  The Depaiiment has educated staff and inmates on sanitation practices and \nproper social distancing. \n5.  Cun-ently, the Facility is well below maximum capacity.  This has afforded the \nDepartment flexibility in making housing assignments which provide more space \nfor the inmates. \n/s ·7d~ d~ ~/ld \npenalties of perjury this 25th Day of March, 2020, \n,  71tfK  _~. \nt \n~oseph D.

SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT \nFOR SUFFOLK COUNTY \nSJ-2020-0115 \nCOMMITIEE FOR PUBLIC COUNSEL SERVICES AND MASSACHUSETIS \nASSOCIATION OF CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYERS \nV. \nCHIEF JUSTICE OF THE TRIAL COURT \nAFFIDAVIT OF WORCESTER DISTRICT ATIORNEY'S OFFICE \nSENIOR FIRST ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATIORNEY JEFFREY T. TRAVERS \n1.  I, Jeffrey T. Travers, am Senior First Assistant District Attorney for the Worcester District \nAttorney's Office. \n2.  On March 18, 2018, l and First Assistant District Attorney Jane Sullivan, participated in a \nconference call with our local CPCS and Bar Advocate supervisors (Jacqueline Dutton, \nCPCS and Richard Farrell}.  While there were no known cases of infection at the jail we \nagreed the conversation about detention in the existing health crisis was indeed \nimportant.  In that dialogue I, on behalf of the Worcester District Attorney's Office, \ncommunicated our willingness to work with counsel on issues of bail and detention \nduring the current COVID-19 health crisis.  As staffing has been significantly impacted by \nillnesses and absences I asked that all motions be sent to me directly, so that they can \nbe channeled to available staff.  Given the staff absences, I stressed the need to provide \nsome factual and procedural history for each case, as the assigned ADA will likely be \nnew to the cases.  In addition, individual defendant circumstances (health issues) would \nbe important considerations. \n3.  On March 23, 2020 I instructed all assistant district attorneys to expect motions of a \nsimilar nature and to bring any motion with perceived merit to the attention of myself \nor an immediate supervisor.  In addition, the office stated in response to three separate \nmedia inquiries, the Worcester District Attorney was reviewing detentions on a case by \ncase basis with much information uniquely possessed by defense counsel. \n81\n\n4.  The Worcester District Attorney's Office has tasked staff with purchasing equipment and \nprovider licenses for video conferencing, including Zoom and Polycom (the court's \ncurrent conferencing system) to allow for a great volume of bail review hearings.  As the \nentire Worcester CPCS Office has been working remotely and members of this office \nand other members of the defense bar are similarly impacted, the use of these \ntechnologies is essential to continued operations. \n5.  Beginning on March 16, 2020, there has been an Assistant District Attorney on duty \neach day at the Superior Court. That Assistant District Attorney's responsibilities include \nbeing available to address any bail reviews via video conference or in person. \n6.  On March 26, 2020, I conducted a review of defendants detained and inmates serving \nsentences at the Worcester County House of Correction with approaching release dates \nand reported health concerns.  A joint review of these detainees/inmates, with the \nWorcester Sheriff's office, will occur tomorrow, March 27, 2020. \n7.  The Worcester District Attorney's Office has been and remains willing to assist counsel \nin having time-sensitive requests heard before a court.  There are multiple Bail Reviews, \nBail Hearings and Dangerousness Hearing reviews already scheduled for next week in \nWorcester Superior Court. The Worcester District Attorney's Office has open lines of \ncommunication with the defense bar and CPCS.  We have been and remain willing to \nconsider any individual defendant's circumstances of detention, while respecting \ncommunity safety and the Victim's Bill of Rights throughout the process. \nSigned under the pains and penalties of perjury. \n82\n\nAFFIDAVIT OF DAVID H. TUTTLE \nI, David Tuttle, do swear under oath the following: \n1.  I am Superintendent of the Worcester County Sheriffs Office (WCSO) and I have \npersonal knowledge of the following. \n2.  As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the WCSO has taken the following emergency \nmeasures. \n3.  All visits have been eliminated with inmates being given two free calls per week instead. \n4.  All areas of the facility are being sanitized with chlorine based cleaning products \n(PurTabs Disinfectant Spray) multiple times a day \n5.  Attorney visits must take place through the visitor's glass with no contact and all \nattorneys are asked the COVID-19 screening questions. \n6.  No outside contractors (with the exception of emergency maintenance), volunteers or \nother persons are permitted on the premises with a security checkpoint at the front drive. \n7.  Group classes and one on one counseling sessions have ceased with all staff being \nrequired to maintain social distancing. \n8.  Any staff member who has been symptomatic or has traveled domestically or \ninternationally must self-quarantine at home and may not return to work until cleared. \n9.  All incoming inmates are screened by medical personnel for symptoms or risk associated \nbehavior and then are placed in an isolated unit for a fourteen day quarantine. \n10.  If an Inmate in a housing unit develops upper respiratory symptoms/fever the following \nprotocol are to be followed. Once an inmate is identified as having concerning symptoms, if \npossible, that inmate should be moved to quarantine. \n12.  One nurse will dress in appropriate PPE, (including gown, N-95 mask, eye protection) \nand bring a surgical face mask for the inmate and (1) set up of appropriate PPE for (1) officer, \nwho will now maintain coverage of the specified inmate until that inmate has reached his final \ndestination. \n13.  The inmate will be screened in his current location. If determined to require \nisolation/quarantine, the nurse and officer with the protective equipment on, will escort the \ninmate to determined housing location. \n14.  If the inmate was housed in a cell with a roommate, the same process will occur for that \ninmate as well. \n15.  Once an inmate is placed in isolation/quarantine medical will limit close interaction using \nthe feed-in trap as much as possible, to obtain vital signs and administer required treatment. In \nthe event that nursing staff must enter the cell, they will require full PPE. Officers should wear \nfull PPE as well, however if able, maintain a distance of 6 feet from the inmate. If distance is \n83\n\nmaintained, PPE should be conserved for later use.  If the officer is required to enter the cell, or \nhas physical contact with the inmate, coverall (gown), surgical face mask, and gloves will be \ndiscarded. \n16.  Eye protection will be placed into a \"dirty bin\" and sprayed down with CAVI spray, left \nfor 1 minute, and then wiped down and placed in \"clean bin\" for re-use. \n17.  All medical equipment used for the inmate will also be placed into dirty bin, and sprayed \ndown with CAVI spray, left for one minute, and then wiped down and placed in clean bin for re \nuse. \n18.  For inmates being housed in the medical unit, all PPE will be removed in the anterior \nroom. \n19.  All officers who are assigned coverage of the medical unit will be properly trained on \ndonning and doffing PPE. Every effort should be made to use consistent staff for \ncoverage/interaction with inmates with suspected or confirmed COVID. \n20.  All officers who accompany an inmate to an outside hospital visit must wear masks and \ngloves. \n21.  All external meetings, conferences or work related travel have been discontinued. \n22.  All internal meetings to the extent possible are held virtually. \n23.  Safety precautions regarding Covid-19 have been placed in all housing units. \n24.  The WCSO is currently under capacity with a federal consent decree capping our \npopulation at 1250 and with our current population at 775. \n25.  Our average daily population for January 2020 was 755, for February, 2020 was 782, and \nfor March, 2020 was 802. \n26.  Soap is available in the housing units for use by the inmates at no cost. \nSworn under the pains and penalties of perjury this 25th day of March, 2020. \n~ N . I~ \nDavid H.

      "text": "Supreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth    Full Court:   SJC-12926      Filed: 4/17/2020 11:26 AM\nCOMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS \nSUPREME JUDICIAL COURT \n \nSuffolk, ss.                              No. SJC-12926 \n \nCOMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC COUNSEL SERVICES and \nMASSACHUSETTS ASSOCIATION OF  \nCRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYERS, \nPetitioners, \n \nv. \n \nCHIEF JUSTICE OF THE TRIAL COURT, et al., \nRespondents. \n \n \nMOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OR MODIFICATION OF DECISION \n \n \n  On April 3, 2020, this Court concluded that due to the “urgent and \nunprecedented” COVID-19 pandemic, “a reduction in the number of people who \nare held in custody is necessary.” Committee for Public Counsel Services v. Chief \nJustice of the Trial Court, 484 Mass. 431, 445 (2020) (CPCS v. Trial Court). The \nCourt therefore implemented certain remedial measures and mandated weekly \nreporting by the Special Master, based on a recognition that “further response” \nmight be necessary to address “this rapidly-evolving situation.” Id. at 453. Fourteen \ndays later, and despite substantial efforts by the Special Master and many \nRespondents, further response is necessary.  \n  Five prisoners have now died from COVID-19. The true extent of the \noutbreak is a mystery—because the Department of Correction and the Sheriffs are \n1 \n \n\nscarcely testing anyone—but at least 180 incarcerated individuals and at least 138 \ncorrections staffers are infected.1  \n  Meanwhile, 449 individuals have reportedly been released due to this Court’s \ndecision. Those releases should be applauded. But because they coincide with a \ndramatic rise in infections, there can be no credible claim that the current pace of \nreleases will suffice to curb the spread of COVID-19, and with it the risk of more \nillness and death, in the Commonwealth’s carceral settings. Of the over 7,700 \nincarcerated people in DOC custody on April 6, only 11 people have been released \npursuant to this Court’s order and the overall population reduction is only 168 \npeople, or 2.17%. That is not nearly enough to mitigate this looming disaster. \nPetitioners therefore move for reconsideration and modification, pursuant to Mass. \nR. App. P. 27, to correct misapprehensions of law and fact that stand in the way of \nremedial measures that will save more lives.  \n  With respect to the law, this Court’s pronouncements concerning stays of \nsentences needlessly created a barrier to achieving the levels of prisoner releases that \nwill be necessary to mitigate the outbreak. On April 3, the Court held that it did not \nhave the power to authorize trial courts to grant stays absent a pending appeal or \nmotion for a new trial. CPCS v. Trial Court, 484 Mass. at 436, 450-451. That \nholding should be reconsidered. Given the “exceptional circumstances” of the \n                                         \n1 Petitioners are tracking Respondents reports here: https://data.aclum.org/sjc-12926-\ntracker/. \n2 \n \n\npandemic, staying sentences falls squarely within the Court’s inherent authority, \nCommonwealth v. Charles, 466 Mass. 63, 74-75 (2013), and does not implicate the \nseparation of powers concerns that the Court stated arose from shortening \nsentences. \n  With respect to the facts, this Court’s expectations turned out to have been \nmistaken in key areas. Contrary to the Court’s apparent understanding at the time of \nthe decision, current processes for adjudicating post-conviction motions and parole \nrequests are incompatible with the expeditious release of people who are in danger.  \n  The number of infections continues to rise every day and incarcerated \nindividuals, correctional staff, and the general public are not safe. This is not because \nthe Special Master has failed to move the process along; it is because the process \nitself needs improvement, just as this Court anticipated it might. The Court should \ntherefore make necessary modifications to save lives.  \nBackground \n  Because of the daily reporting ordered by this Court, it is possible to assess \nwhether Respondents’ mitigation efforts, combined with prisoner releases, have \ncurbed the spread of the coronavirus inside Massachusetts prisons, jails, and houses \nof correction. They have not.  \n3 \n \n\n  Releases have been limited; 449 people have been released pursuant to this \norder, and since April 72, the total incarcerated population has only decreased by \n5.69% The parole board, to our knowledge, is still requiring people with a positive \n. \nparole vote to move to a long-term residential facility or step down to a lower \nsecurity facility—during a time when no transfers are permitted—before they will be \nreleased. Of the approximately 300 people with positive parole votes awaiting a \nparole permit at the time of oral argument on March 31, it appears that only 58 have \nsince received them.3 Meanwhile, at least 318 incarcerated individuals and staffers \nhave tested positive for COVID-19. In the DOC, where five prisoners have already \ndied, the situation is dire; over 160 prisoners and staffers have confirmed infections, \napparently including more than 13% of all prisoners at the Commonwealth’s only \nwomen’s prison.4 \n \n \n                                         \n2 April 7, 2020, was the first day that all Respondents provided population statistics \nto Petitioners.  \n3 See Special Master’s Weekly Report (Apr. 13, 2020). \n4 See https://www.mass.gov/lists/weekly-inmate-count-2020 (listing 198 prisoners in \nMCI-Framingham as of April 13, 2020). \n4 \n \n\n \n \n \nOverall, Respondents have reported infections among at least 138 staff \nmembers and contractors. This is both a human tragedy and a worrying sign that \n5 \n \n\ninfection is being transmitted from the community into prisons and jails, and vice \nversa. \nOfficials have found these infections despite rarely testing anyone. As of April \n15, just 422 incarcerated individuals, out of a population that has consistently \nexceeded 14,000, had been tested. The Barnstable and Franklin County Sheriff’s \nOffices have each reported testing zero incarcerated individuals since April 5, while \nthey each have two staffers that have tested positive for COVID-19.5 Contrary to this \nCourt’s order, and despite repeated requests, the DOC has never reported how \nmany of its staff have been tested to find its 64 positive staff cases. The DOC has \nalso never reported its inmate testing numbers or overall population per facility, \nmaking it impossible for Petitioners or the Court to assess the adequacy of testing in \nanything but the system as a whole, which itself is patently inadequate. It appears that \nthe Commonwealth is not on a path to solve the coronavirus outbreaks in its prisons \nand jails, but instead is burying its head in the sand.  \nDiscussion \nReasonable people might disagree about how many releases are needed to \nachieve an acceptable level of risk inside and outside prison walls. But it cannot \nreasonably be disputed that the current rate of releases is inadequate to protect \nincarcerated persons, correctional staff, and the general public. That is because the \n                                         \n5 Dukes County also reports zero tests of incarcerated individuals since April 5.  \n6 \n \n\ncrisis inside Massachusetts correctional facilities worsens by the day. Indeed, the \nnumber of deaths at the Massachusetts Treatment Center “put[s] it on par with \nfacilities such as Cook County Jail in Illinois, and Rikers Island in New York City. \nThe entire federal prison system has reported only 16 in-custody deaths from the \nnew coronavirus.”6 It is therefore important to correct two misapprehensions in the \nApril 3 opinion that have slowed the pace of prisoner releases: this Court’s \npronouncements about staying sentences, and its expectations of how individualized \nrelease determinations would proceed.     \nI.  This Court can and should exercise its inherent authority to authorize trial \ncourts to stay sentences during the pandemic even where there are no \npending appeals or motions for new trial.  \n \nThe Court’s opinion jointly addressed the judiciary’s authority to stay \nsentences and its authority to revise or revoke them. CPCS v. Trial Court, 484 Mass. \nat 450-451. But the authority to pause sentences is distinct from, and broader than, \nthe authority to shorten them. See Reply Br. at 21-22. For three reasons, this Court \nmay authorize sentences to be stayed even in the absence of an applicable rule of \nappellate or criminal procedure, and even where revising or revoking sentences \nwould (under this Court’s April 3 decision) implicate separation of powers concerns.  \n  First, exercising the judiciary’s inherent authority to stay sentences does not \nviolate separation of powers principles. Although several district attorneys argued \n                                         \n6 Vernal Coleman, State correctional facility in Bridgewater emerges as hotspot of \ncoronavirus infection, THE BOSTON GLOBE (April 16, 2020). \n7 \n \n\nthat article 30 circumscribes the judiciary’s authority to revise or revoke sentences \nbeyond those covered by Mass. R. Crim. P. 29, they did not cite a single case for the \nproposition that article 30 similarly circumscribes stays of sentences. This is not \nsurprising. Pausing a sentence for a finite period of time, without shortening or \notherwise modifying it, treads on neither the legislative authority to set mandatory \nminimum sentences nor the executive authority to grant parole, pardons, or \ncommutations. Indeed, Petitioners have found no article 30 cases, apart from this \nCourt’s April 3 opinion, suggesting otherwise. \n  Second, the rules of appellate and criminal procedure do not define the outer \nlimit of a judge’s authority to stay a sentence; this Court has already held that “a \njudge has the inherent power to stay sentences for ‘exceptional reasons permitted by \nlaw.’” Charles, 466 Mass. at 72 (quoting Commonwealth v. McLaughlin, 431 Mass. \n506, 520 (2000)). Inherent judicial powers “exist independently” of statutory \nauthority. Id. at 73 (quoting First Justice v. Clerk-Magistrate, 438 Mass. 387, 397 \n(2003)). Because “[t]he very concept of inherent power carries with it the implication \nthat its use is for occasions not provided for by established methods,” id. (cleaned \nup)7, by definition such “exceptional reasons” exceed those articulated in Mass. R. \n                                         \n7 This petition uses (cleaned up) to indicate that internal quotation marks, alterations \nor citations have been omitted from quotations. See Jack Metzler, Cleaning Up \nQuotations, 18 J. App. Prac. & Process 143 (2017).  \n8 \n \n\nApp. P. 6 and Mass. R. Crim. P. 31.8 This includes instances where circumstances \nnecessitate temporary, time-bounded release even in the absence of a pending action \nfor permanent release. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. DeMarco, 387 Mass. 481, 482 \n(1982) (noting that to “enable the defendant to see his parents, the judge stayed the \nexecution of this sentence for one week”); United States v. Melody, 863 F.2d 499, \n501 (7th Cir. 1988) (judge stayed the sentence of a mother until the sentence of the \nfather was completed “to make sure that the children of the defendants [had] one \nparent with them”) (cited in McLaughlin, 431 Mass. at 520); see also Rozier vs. \nUnited States, 2014 WL 2117355, No. 13-1146, at *1 n.1 (S.D. Ill. May 21, 2014) \n(noting that “[t]he court stayed the judgment six months because [defendant] was \npregnant”).  \n  Third, even if it were true that an action for permanent release must be filed \nbefore a judge can stay a sentence—though it is not—such an action already exists. On \nMarch 30, 2020, Prisoners’ Legal Services moved to intervene in this case, seeking \nthe release from custody of all prisoners over the age of 50 or with medical \nconditions that render them particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. See SJC 12926 \nDkt. 50. As of the time of this filing, that motion was still pending. In addition, \nPetitioners understand that a new class action complaint brought on behalf of all \nprisoners incarcerated at Massachusetts jails and prisons seeking release from \n                                         \n8 The 2009 Reporters Notes to Mass. R. Crim. P. 31 expressly note that “[t]his Rule \ndoes not address stays of execution of a sentence when an appeal is not pending.”  \n9 \n \n\ncustody based on violations of their rights under the 8th Amendment and article 26 \nwill be filed with the single justice under G. L. c. 214, § 1, today. These actions \nimplicate the rationale of Charles, where this Court authorized stays for defendants \nwith pending new trial motions “because a conviction may be reversible, but the time \nspent in prison is not.” Charles, 466 Mass. at 77. Here, given the risks presented by \nCOVID-19, the time that defendants spend in prison while the above actions are \nadjudicated is just as irreversible, if not more so.  \n  If this Court agrees that it should modify its opinion and authorize sentences \nto be stayed even in the absence of predicate appeals or motions for new trial, \nPetitioners recommend that the Court:  \n1)  Establish a rebuttable presumption of a stay for certain individuals, such as \nthose who are: \na.  Eligible for parole and incarcerated for an offense that is not listed in \nAppendix A of this Court’s April 3, 2020, decision; \nb.  Serving time in a house of correction for a non-excluded offense; \nc.  Completing their sentences within six months, taking into account any \ncredit for good behavior or programming; \nd.  Incarcerated for a probation or parole violation that does not include \nan allegation of a new criminal offense; \ne.  Vulnerable to COVID-19 due to age or medical condition; or \n10 \n \n\nf.  Medically qualified for medical parole. \n2)  Order DOC and the Sheriffs to facilitate the prompt filing of stay motions by \nproviding Petitioners with the name, docket number, inmate number, wrap-up \ndate, and parole eligibility date of all individuals who fall into the categories \nlisted above; providing access to medical records within 24 hours of a request; \nand ensuring prompt access to confidential attorney-client communications. \n3)  Require motions for stays to be heard no later than two business days after the \nfiling of the motion, with a decision to be rendered promptly thereafter. See \nCPCS v. Trial Court, 484 Mass. at 453 (ordering “a hearing within two \nbusiness days” for those pretrial detainees entitled to a rebuttable \npresumption of release).9 \n  This Court has said that “these are not normal times.”  Id. The pandemic is \nsufficiently exceptional to trigger this Court’s inherent power to authorize trial courts \nto grant stays of execution of sentences, even in the absence of a pending post-\nconviction motion or appeal. Incarcerated people should be allowed to ask that their \nsentences be paused during this pandemic, so they can finish them when it would \nnot risk their health or life to do so. \n                                         \n9 Given the urgent nature of the pandemic, Petitioners request that this time frame \napply to all motions for stay, including those filed under Mass. R. Crim. P. 31 and \nMass. R. App. P. 6(b).  \n11 \n \n\nII.   This Court should take further steps to effectuate the decision’s stated goals. \n \nThe Court’s opinion recognized a need to facilitate the expeditious release of \nthose in pretrial detention, allow for the release of individuals through timely Rule \n29 motions, and encourage the release of individuals via parole. Nearly two weeks of \nimplementation have demonstrated that this is not happening fast enough, partly \nbecause Petitioners cannot clear roadblocks as fast as others create them. For \nexample, none of the DOC’s daily reports have provided all of the information \nordered by the Court in its April 3 decision. See, e.g., Id. at 435, 448 n.20 (“the \nDOC shall furnish the special master daily reports of inmate counts and rates of \nCOVID-19 cases at each facility”). Petitioners have had to undertake substantial \nefforts just to get the DOC to report as much information to the Special Master as it \ndoes to the media.10 Several counties are refusing, after repeated requests, to provide \nlists of people who are held pending a probation violation hearing and thus eligible \nfor the rebuttable presumption of release (unless they also have a pending excluded \noffense). The parole board has apparently not expedited the release of previously-\napproved individuals.11 And while some Respondents are facilitating prompt \n                                         \n10 Compare Jennifer McKim (@jbmckin), Tweet Dated April 13, 2020 @ 5:41 P.M., \nhttps://twitter.com/jbmckim/status/1249814890279247872 (reporting facility-specific \ninformation about inmate and staff COVID-19 infections in the DOC, as well as \nprisoner deaths), with Special Master’s Weekly Report (Apr. 13, 2020) (reflecting \nthat DOC did not report that same information during its first seven daily reports in \nthis case).  \n11 See Affidavit of Catherine J. Hinton (Apr. 15, 2020). \n12 \n \n\nattorney-client communications and releases of medical records, others are not and \nsome are even requiring attorneys to mail medical releases to clients, both of which \nslow the process of filing motions. But see Id. at 448-449 (“Defense counsel shall be \npermitted promptly to convene video or teleconferences with their clients; the \nsheriffs’ offices and DOC are to work with the defense bar to facilitate such \ncommunications”); Id. at 448 n.21 (“Upon request by a defendant, the sheriffs also \nare required timely to provide the defendant with his or her requested medical \nrecords”). These delays can cost lives.  \nThe situation is unlikely to improve faster than the rate of infection, and is \ngrounds for substantially rehauling the current framework. The Court could, for \nexample, set a decarceration benchmark or involve the Single Justice more \nthoroughly in facilitating releases. Cf. Reply Br. 25-26. But even if the Court \nmaintains the current framework, it should correct key misapprehensions that, while \nsurely understandable given that this Court’s opinion issued just three days after oral \nargument, are preventing the opinion from operating as intended. Petitioners \ntherefore request that the Court take the following actions. \n1. Permit individualized release decisions for pre-trial detainees exposed to \nthe virus. \n \nThis Court’s holding that people who are COVID-19 positive or quarantined \nare ineligible for release, CPCS v. Trial Court, 484 Mass. at 448 n.19, appears to \nreflect a view that keeping those individuals incarcerated will protect public health. \n13 \n \n\nThis view is incorrect. Individuals who have a place to self-quarantine in a private \nsetting should be released; if they remain “quarantined” in a prison, jail, or house of \ncorrection, they will still have numerous daily interactions with correctional staff who \noften move between units and certainly move in and out of the facility. Trial courts \nshould therefore be permitted to release individuals who have tested positive for, or \nhave been exposed to, the virus based on an individualized determination of the \ncircumstances of the person seeking release and their ability to self-quarantine. \n2. Require Rule 29 motions to be heard more quickly. \n \nThis Court recognized the judicial authority to revise or revoke sentences \nbased on timely-submitted Rule 29 motions, id. at 450, and a need for timely \nreductions in the number of people who are held in custody, id. at 445. Yet, in the \nwake of the Court’s decision, the trial court has issued standing orders that allow the \nCommonwealth to wait fourteen days before responding to a Rule 29 motion, and \nwhich place no time limit on the trial judge’s resolution of those motions.12 In this \npandemic, where the number of infected prisoners has already spiked nearly ten-\nfold since this case was argued,13 fourteen days is a lifetime. This Court should \n                                         \n12 Boston Municipal Court Standing Order 5-20 at 3; Juvenile Court Standing Order \n5-20 at 3; Superior Court Standing Order 5-20 at 3; District Court Standing Order 4-\n20 at 4. \n13 On March 31, the day of argument, 17 incarcerated people were infected. See \nVernal Coleman & Andrea Estes, SJC hears arguments over releasing some inmates \nduring the pandemic, THE BOSTON GLOBE (March 31, 2020). According to the \ndaily reports, today (April 16) that number has increased to 167.  \n14 \n \n\nrequire the Commonwealth to respond to Rule 29 motions within 48 hours and trial \ncourts to decide such motions promptly thereafter.  \nThe Court should also remind trial judges that they can consider COVID-19 \nas a fact that existed at the time of sentencing. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Jackson, \n80 Mass. App. Ct. 528, 533 (2011) (fact that existed at the time of original \nsentencing, but was not known to the judge, is “a permissible ground” on which to \nrevise a sentence). The first case of COVID-19 in the United States was reported on \nJanuary 21, 2020,14 the World Health Organization declared a global health \nemergency on January 30, 2020,15 and the first case in the Commonwealth was \nconfirmed on February 1, 2020.16 To the extent that the full danger of the virus was \nappreciated only later, Rule 29 was meant to address just this type of \nmisunderstanding. Indeed, it is inconsistent with due process to sentence a \ndefendant on “the basis of assumptions” that “were materially untrue.” Townsend v. \nBurke, 334 U.S. 736, 741 (1948). \n \n \n                                         \n14 First patient with Wuhan coronavirus is identified in the U.S., NEW YORK TIMES \n(Jan. 1, 2020), available at: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/health/cdc-\ncoronavirus.html. \n15 A timeline of the coronavirus pandemic, NEW YORK TIMES (April 2, 2020), \navailable at: https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-timeline.html. \n16 Boston man has coronavirus, WBUR (Feb. 1, 2020), available at: \nhttps://www.wbur.org/news/2020/02/01/coronavirus-boston-massachusetts. \n15 \n \n\n3. Order DOC, the Parole Board, and the Sheriffs to provide information to \nPetitioners. \n \nThis Court urged the DOC and the parole board to “expedite” parole \nhearings, the issuance of parole permits, and petitions for compassionate release, as \nwell as identify other individuals who could be released. 484 Mass. at 453. Although \nPetitioners are engaged in talks with the parole board that have been fruitful, we have \nreceived no information demonstrating that this Court’s expectations are being \nfulfilled. To the contrary—the only thing we know is that 58 people have been \nreleased on parole since the SJC’s order.17 There are a number of categories of \nincarcerated people who could seek release from the parole board if Petitioners \nknew who they were and could provide counsel to facilitate that process. \nAccordingly, the DOC, the Sheriffs, and the parole board should now be ordered to \nprovide the names of all people who have a positive parole vote and are awaiting a \nparole permit,18 as well as the following individuals: \n1.  House of Correction prisoners who have not yet reached their initial parole \neligibility date, but with counsel could submit an emergency petition to the \nparole board for early consideration pursuant to 120 Code Mass. Regs. \n§ 200.1(3);  \n \n2.  All incarcerated persons who received a positive vote for parole but release is \ncontingent upon completing a particular program or spending time in lower \nsecurity, who with counsel could seek reconsideration of the parole \ncontingency under 120 Codes Mass. Regs. § 304.03; \n \n                                         \n17 See Special Master’s Weekly Report (Apr. 13, 2020). \n18 The parole board has already provided CPCS with 170 names. \n16 \n \n\n3.  Incarcerated persons waiting for a preliminary hearing or a final revocation \nhearing on an alleged technical violation of parole (akin to the probationer \ndetainees who are entitled to the presumption of release), as these people \ncould submit an emergency petition to withdraw the parole warrant pursuant \nto G. L. c. 127, § 149; \n \n4.  Incarcerated persons whose parole was revoked and are serving time for a \ntechnical violation of parole, as these people could submit an emergency \npetition to reconsider the decision to revoke parole pursuant to 120 Code \nMass. Regs. §304.03; and \n \n5.  Incarcerated persons medically qualified for medical parole, as they are some \nof the people most vulnerable to the virus. \n \nTo ensure expeditious consideration of these requests, Petitioners ask this \nCourt to  urge the chair of the parole board to exercise its discretion to seek the \nimmediate appointment of three special board members pursuant to G. L. c. 27, § \n7. Cf. Bridgeman v. Dist. Attorney for Suffolk Dist., 476 Mass. 298, 300 (2017) (the \nCourt declared “the district attorneys shall exercise their prosecutorial discretion and \nreduce the number of relevant Dookhan defendants). \nFinally, to effectively advocate for our clients’ release on parole or medical \nparole, it is sometimes necessary to obtain the assistance of a social worker or \nmedical expert. There is no mechanism in place to obtain court approval for these \nessential expenditures as required by the Indigent Court Costs Act. See G. L. c. 261, \n§§ 27A-27G. Petitioners therefore request that this Court permit and order the trial \ncourt to work with CPCS to create an administrative procedure to rule upon motions \nfor funds within one business day in cases that involve the parole board or medical \n17 \n \n\nparole proceedings. In the alternative, Petitioners request that this Court order the \nautomatic approval of funds for up to ten hours of assistance from social workers or \nother experts in connection with representation related to COVID-19 parole and \nmedical parole proceedings. \n \n18 \n \n\nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n  /s/ Rebecca A.

Chief Justice of the\nTrial Court. Commissioner of Correction. District\nAttorney. Sheriff. Parole. Pretrial Detention. Supreme\nJudicial Court, Superintendence of inferior courts.\nPractice, Criminal, Sentence, Execution of sentence,\nParole.\nThe petitioners seek reconsideration or modification of our\ndecision in this case, which was issued on April 3, 2020.\nCommittee for Pub. Counsel Servs. v. Chief Justice of the Trial\nCourt, 484 Mass. 431 (2020). Specifically, they ask us to\nreconsider our determination that neither our inherent judicial\nauthority nor our superintendence authority permits a judge to\nstay a final sentence that is being served, absent a pending\nappeal or a motion for a new trial, without violating the\nseparation of powers under art. 30 of the Massachusetts\nDeclaration of Rights. See id. at 436. The petitioners also\nassert violations of this court's order with respect to\nreporting requirements of information to be sent to the special\nmaster, and, in addition, ask this court to expand the reporting\nrequirements so as to provide the petitioners with information\n1 Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.\n2 Department of Correction; parole board; Attorney General;\ndistrict attorneys for the Berkshire, Bristol, Cape and Islands,\neastern, Hampden, middle, Norfolk, northern, northwestern,\nPlymouth, and Suffolk districts; and fourteen sheriffs'\ndepartments.\n\n2\nthat might be used to pursue other legal pathways by which the\npopulation of those held in custody serving sentences might be\nreduced.\nWe affirm our prior decision as to the extent of our\nconstitutional authority to stay final sentences absent an\nongoing challenge to the underlying conviction or a violation of\nconstitutional rights. Notwithstanding the petitioners'\nassertion that our previous \"misapprehension\" of our authority\nwas as a result of the speed with which the decision was issued\nafter oral argument, the jurisprudence on this point is well-\nestablished. We do, however, conclude that some of the\nrequested relief as to additional reporting requirements should\nbe allowed, and, accordingly, issue a revised Appendix B,\nattached hereto.\nAs we stated in our decision, the executive branch has the\nauthority, inter alia, to commute sentences, issue furloughs,\nand allow early parole. We urge the executive branch to\ncontemplate how it best might exercise those constitutional\npowers to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the Commonwealth's\nprison system.\nBackground. In our prior decision, we recognized that the\nunprecedented and urgent conditions created by the global COVID-\n19 pandemic necessitated judicial action to reduce the\npopulation of those held in custody. Committee for Pub. Counsel\nServs., 484 Mass. at 445. Accordingly, we determined that the\nadvent of the pandemic amounted to a changed condition as a\nmatter of law, so that any individual who was being held\npretrial could seek reconsideration of the bail decision which\nresulted in the pretrial detention. Id. at 435. For\nindividuals not charged with specified offenses as enumerated in\nAppendix A, set forth in that decision, see id. at 454, we\ncreated a strong but rebuttable presumption of release, id.\nat 447 (\"These categories of pretrial detainees shall be ordered\nreleased on personal recognizance unless the Commonwealth\nestablishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, that release\nwould result in an unreasonable danger to the community or that\nthe individual presents a very high risk of flight\").\nAt the same time, we determined that \"[o]ur broad power of\nsuperintendence over the courts does not grant us the authority\nto authorize courts to revise or revoke defendants' custodial\nsentences, to stay the execution of sentence, or to order their\ntemporary release unless a defendant (1) has moved under Mass.\nR. Crim. P. 29, [as appearing in 474 Mass. 1503 (2016),] within\n\n3\nsixty days after imposition of sentence or the issuance of a\ndecision on all pending appeals, to revise or revoke his or her\nsentence, (2) has appealed the conviction or sentence and the\nappeal remains pending, or (3) has moved for a new trial under\nMass. R. Crim. P. 30[, as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001)].\"\nId. at 450.\nDiscussion. 1. Stays or suspensions of sentences. As the\npetitioners point out, the bulk of our reasoning in the slip\nopinion focused on their argument seeking a suspension of the\nsixty-day time period in Mass. R. Crim. P. 29, within which a\njudge may revise or revoke a sentence. See Committee for Pub.\nCounsel Servs., 484 Mass. at 450. Having determined that the\nsixty-day time period exists to protect the separation of\npowers, we concluded that it was beyond our superintendence\nauthority to eliminate the requirement of a time limit. Id.\nMoreover, as we noted, the conditions for which a revision may\nbe sought must be something that existed at the time of\nconviction.3\nThe petitioners now ask for release, or stay, under our\ninherent authority to stay sentences. We conclude that the\nglobal stays of sentences that the petitioners request also\nwould co-opt executive functions in ways that are not permitted\nby art. 30.\nIn Commonwealth v. Charles, 466 Mass. 63, 72 (2013), citing\nCommonwealth v. McLaughlin, 431 Mass. 506, 520 (2000), we said\nthat \"a judge has the inherent power to stay sentences for\n'exceptional reasons permitted by law.'\" We later explained the\nexceptional reasons more precisely in that case by answering the\nreported question, \"In exceptional circumstances, a judge of the\nSuperior Court does have the authority to allow a defendant's\nmotion to stay the execution of his sentence, then being served,\npending disposition of the defendant's motion for a new\ntrial . . . .\" Charles, supra at 79. \"In the context of a\npending appeal, the practice of granting a stay of execution of\nsentence 'is grounded in rudimentary notions of justice' because\na 'conviction may be reversible, but the time spent in prison is\n3 In response to an issue raised by the Chief Justices of\nthe Trial Court, we clarify that the tolling provision of this\ncourt's Order Regarding Court Operations under the Exigent\nCircumstances Created by the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Pandemic,\ndated April 1, 2020; our updated order, dated April 27, 2020;\nand any similar orders subsequently issued, apply to motions\nfiled under Mass. R. Crim. P. 29.\n\n4\nnot.'\"4 Id. at 77, quoting Commonwealth v. Levin, 7 Mass. App.\nCt. 501, 512-513 (1979). See Charles, supra at 78 (elaborating\non key fact that defendant's \"motion for a new trial has\npresented an issue that 'offers some reasonable possibility of a\nsuccessful decision\" [quotation omitted]).\nOther than in circumstances where the validity of the\nunderlying conviction is being questioned, however, the\npetitioners have not put forth anything to indicate that this\ncourt has inherent authority to stay, across the board, all\nsentences that are being executed for certain groups of\nincarcerated individuals, or to create a presumption of stay for\nthose individuals. For even in the broadest formulation of our\ninherent power, any stay, even those granted in exceptional\ncircumstances, must be \"permitted by law.\" See Charles, 466\nMass. at 72; art. 30 (\"the judicial [department] shall never\nexercise the legislative and executive powers, or either of\nthem\").\nThe power to stay sentences in the absence of a challenge\nto the underlying conviction after the time period of Mass. R.\nCrim. P. 29 has expired lies in the executive branch. \"In\nCommonwealth v. O'Brien, [175 Mass. 37, 39 (1899)], the court\nsaid that [Commonwealth v. Hayes, 170 Mass. 16 (1897)] implies\nthat, under the statute,\" the power of the court after all\nappeals have been decided \"to vacate the order staying the\nsentence, and to order the sentence executed, does not extend so\nfar as to permit a further stay of the sentence on independent\ngrounds not affecting the legality or propriety of the\nconviction.\" McLaughlin, 431 Mass. at 517. \"That is a strong\nindication that trial judges lack authority to stay execution of\nsentence on independent grounds not affecting the legality or\npropriety of the conviction\" (quotation omitted). Id., and\ncases cited. We follow this strong indication here. See\nPeterson v. Hopson, 306 Mass. 597, 601–602 (1940), and cases\n4 We recognize the petitioners' assertion that an untimely\ndeath is even less reversible than time spent in prison. As the\npetitioners note, a claim of substantial and unmitigated risk of\nharm or death is the gravamen of another emergency petition now\npending before this court, seeking class certification and a\npreliminary injunction on the ground of violations of the\nprovision against cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution. See Foster vs.\nCommissioner of Correction, No. SJC-12935. That claim is the\nproper vehicle by which to seek injunctive relief.\n\n5\ncited; Jamnback v. Aamunkoitto Temperance Soc'y, Inc., 273 Mass.\n45, 50 (1930).5\nThe petitioners contend that this court should consider the\npending claims for declarative relief in another case, Foster\nvs. Commissioner of Correction, No. SJC-12935, as a challenge to\nall of the underlying convictions of all individuals serving\nsentences, so as to satisfy the requirements of Mass. R. Crim.\nP 29. This contention is unavailing. First, there is no\nchallenge in that case to the underlying convictions of any\nindividual; rather, the complaint seeks declaratory relief.\nGranting a stay without such a challenge essentially amounts to\ngranting a furlough, which lies within the purview of the\nexecutive branch. Thus, if a judge were to suspend execution of\na sentence that is being served, without any pending motion\nchallenging the conviction or the validity of the sentence when\nit was imposed, there could be a significant issue with art. 30\nand the separation of powers. Moreover, the parties, and the\nincarcerated individuals represented by the plaintiffs in the\ntwo cases, are not the same. In any event, we decline the\npetitioners' urging that we order trial judges to suspend\nsentences for large groups of inmates, or to act on a\npresumption that sentences should be suspended.\n5 Specifically with respect to Mass. R. Crim. P. 29, in\naddition to the sixty-day filing limitation, a judge must\nconsider a motion to revise or revoke a sentence within a\nreasonable time after the motion is filed. See Commonwealth. v.\nDeJesus, 440 Mass. 147, 150-151 & n.7 (2003). See, e.g.,\nCommonwealth v. Barclay, 424 Mass. 377, 380–381 (1997) (six-year\ndelay between defendant's sentencing and consideration of motion\nto revise or revoke was unreasonable); Commonwealth v. Layne,\n386 Mass. 291, 295–296 (1982) (stressing that '[w]ith the\npassage of time from the date of sentencing, it becomes\nincreasingly difficult for a trial judge to make the\ndetermination called for by the rule without improperly\nconsidering postsentencing events\"); K.B. Smith, Criminal\nPractice and Procedure § 2028 (2d ed. 1983 & Supp. 2003). But\nsee Commonwealth v. McGuinness, 421 Mass. 472, 473 n.2 (1995)\n(\"Rule 29 of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal\nProcedure, . . . requires that a motion to revise or revoke must\nbe filed within sixty days of the imposition of a sentence.\nHowever, under this rule, once the motion is filed, a judge may\nact on it at any time. See Reporters' Notes to Mass. R. Crim.\nP. 29(a)\").\n\n6\n2. Motions for funds. The petitioners assert that motions\nfor funds for social workers and others who are needed to\nestablish medical parole eligibility or to put in place release\nplans for paroled individuals are not being heard, or are being\ndenied, and that hearings are not taking place in a timely\nmanner. Due to the extraordinary nature of this pandemic, we\nexercise our superintendence authority to require the trial\ncourt departments to develop procedures to enable counsel to\nseek expedited approval of such funds for those who are being\nheld pretrial, those who are civilly committed for substance\nabuse treatment, and those who are serving a committed sentence.\n3. Medical records. The petitioners assert that numerous\nincarcerated individuals continue to experience difficulties in\nobtaining copies of their medical records from the institutions\nin which they are being held. According to the petitioners,\n\"some [institutions] are even requiring attorneys to mail\nmedical releases to clients.\" At the same time, other\ninstitutions have been permitting attorneys to request medical\nrecords and medical releases by electronic mail. All\ncorrectional facilities shall accept requests by electronic\nmail, and shall make copies of medical records immediately\navailable to the incarcerated person upon request, or to the\nindividual's attorney upon request accompanied by signed\npermission by the incarcerated person. Because attorneys may\nnot visit incarcerated individuals at this time, the\ninstitutions shall obtain the necessary permissions for medical\nreleases directly from the individuals; such permissions shall\nbe sought expeditiously upon request by the attorney.\n4. Reporting requirements. In our decision in this case,\nwe agreed that the potential spread of COVID-19 through jails\nand prisons in the Commonwealth created a situation that is\n\"urgent and unprecedented, and that a reduction in the number of\npeople who are held in custody is necessary.\" See Committee for\nPub. Counsel Servs., 484 Mass. at 445. To facilitate this\nreduction, the petitioners request additional information from\nthe respondents in order effectively to exercise legal channels\nby which inmates may pursue release. For example, they seek the\nidentity of those who are serving sentences in houses of\ncorrection who have not reached their parole eligibility dates,\nbut who are eligible for early consideration pursuant to 120\nCode Mass. Regs. § 200.10 (2017). We agree that it is important\nthat the petitioners are able to explore every extant legal\nmechanism by which to reduce the population of incarcerated\nindividuals. Accordingly, the reporting requirements in\nAppendix B, as set forth in our decision, see Committee for Pub.\n\n7\nCounsel Servs., supra at 456, shall be amended to enable counsel\nmore readily to identify those individuals. See infra.\nSimilarly, with respect to individuals who are incarcerated\npending a final probation violation hearing or on a technical\nparole violation, the reporting requirements set forth in\nAppendix B also shall be amended. See infra.\nThe petitioners also assert delays and a lack of compliance\nwith the reporting requirements we previously ordered. To the\nextent that they have information about particular instances of\nsuch noncompliance, as we stated in our decision, the proper\nchannel by which to address such issues is to bring these\nconcerns to the special master, who may be able to investigate\nand facilitate a resolution.\n5. Timeliness of hearings on Mass. R. Crim. P. 29 motions.\nThe petitioners assert that responses to emergency motions for\nresentencing under Mass. R. Crim. P. 29 have been delayed, and,\nonce responses are received, hearings on the motions also have\nbeen delayed. We emphasize that responses should be filed\npromptly and that hearings should be held expeditiously\nthereafter, in conformance with the guidelines promulgated by\nthe trial court departments. As stated, see note 3, supra,\nthese motions are subject to the tolling provisions of this\ncourt's orders regarding court operations under the exigent\ncircumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSo ordered.\nThe case was submitted on briefs.\nRebecca A.

In order to effectuate the purposes of this decision\nand the underlying public health goals, while the COVID-19 state\nof emergency remains in effect, the court asks the Department of\nCorrection (DOC) and each sheriff to provide daily reports to\nthe special master, the probation service, the district\nattorneys, and Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS),\nidentifying:\na. The over-all inmate population;\nb. The number of COVID-19 tests and number of positive\nresults for all inmates, correction officers, or other staff\nmembers, including contactors, by facility; and\nc. The number of inmates who have been released pursuant\nto the procedures or guidance set forth in this decision.\n2. In addition to the above, the sheriffs also shall\nprovide the special master, the probation service, the district\nattorneys, and CPCS daily census reports containing the names of\npretrial detainees, the docket numbers in the cases for which\nthey are being held, and the offenses with which they have been\ncharged.\n3. The probation department shall provide daily reports to\nthe special master, the district attorneys, CPCS, and each\nsheriff containing the identity and relevant docket numbers for\nany individual awaiting a preliminary hearing or a final\nrevocation hearing for an alleged violation of probation.\n4. The parole board shall provide weekly reports to the\nspecial master, the district attorneys, CPCS, the sheriffs, and\nthe DOC, containing the identities of:\na. Incarcerated individuals serving a sentence in a house\nof correction who have not yet reached their initial parole\neligibility date, but who are eligible to submit a petition to\nthe parole board for early consideration pursuant to 120 Code\nMass. Regs. § 200.10(3) (2017);\nb. All incarcerated individuals who have received a\npositive vote for parole but who have not yet been released;\n\n10\nc. All incarcerated individuals who have received a\npositive vote for parole but for whom release is contingent upon\ncompleting a particular program or spending time in a lower\nsecurity facility, who with counsel could seek reconsideration\nof the parole contingency under 120 Code Mass. Regs. § 304.03\n(2017);\nd. All incarcerated individuals whose parole was revoked\nand who are serving time for a technical violation of parole.\ne. Any individuals who previously have submitted a\npetition for medical parole, regardless of the outcome of that\npetition, and who remain incarcerated.",

SJC-12926 \n \n \n \nCOMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC COUNSEL SERVICES AND \nMASSACHUSETTS ASSOCIATION OF CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYERS,  \nPetitioners, \n \nv. \n \nCHIEF JUSTICE OF THE TRIAL COURT, ET AL., \nRespondents \n \n \nSPECIAL MASTER’S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION \nIn responding to the worsening COVID-19 pandemic, the Commonwealth and its citizens \nhave been called on to take unprecedented actions, resulting in significant disruption to every \naspect of our community.  The Special Master commends the Trial Court, Department of \nCorrection, Probation Department, each of the county Sheriffs’ offices, and District Attorneys’ \noffices for taking prompt actions to reduce the risk of infection among inmates, including: a \nstepping up of vigorous cleanings of facilities and spaces; increasing supplies of hygienic \nproducts; restricting visitor access; quarantining individuals displaying symptoms of COVID-19; \nsuspending third-party programming; facilitating inmate telecommunications with counsel, \nfamilies and loved ones; and working cooperatively and expeditiously in response to individual \npetitions for release for non-violent offenders, as warranted. \nThe Court seeks to support the existing efforts of law enforcement, corrections officials, \nand the defense bar to reduce the population of non-violent, low risk prisoners in this unique \ncircumstance.  Public health experts and federal, state and local government officials have issued \nnumerous advisories about the importance of continued social distancing for an extended period \nof time, and that the risk of spread of COVID-19 within our communities may continue to \nthreaten the health and safety of our citizens for an indeterminate period of time.  Concern for the \npublic health, including that of the public at large, and the inmates and the staff of our \ncorrections and court system, warrants, as numerous other jurisdictions across the country have \nrecognized, that any and all reasonable actions be taken to reduce the potential spread of \nCOVID-19 in a manner consistent with ensuring public safety.   \nWHEREFORE, the Special Master hereby reports and recommends that, pursuant to the \nsuperintendence powers granted to the Court under G.L. c. 211, § 3, the Court order as follows: \n   \n81877939_20 \n\nI.  GUIDANCE FOR PRETRIAL PROCEEDINGS \n1.  In probation detention and violation hearings, pre-trial detention hearings, and bail \nhearings, the Trial Courts shall consider the risk that a defendant or probationer may \neither contract COVID-19 or infect others as a factor to be considered in any decisions \nregarding detention.  In addition, given the high risk posed by COVID-19 for people who \nare more than 60 years old or who suffer from a high-risk condition as defined by the \nCenter for Disease Control (“CDC”) that renders them more vulnerable to COVID-19, \nthe age and health of any defendants who fall in the aforementioned categories should be \nfactored into decisions regarding detention.  \n2.  Any existing warrants or warrants issued after the date of this Order for non-violent \nprobation violations; failure to appear; failures to pay outstanding fees and fines; and for \nalleged commission of new offenses other than “Excluded Offenses,” as defined in \nAppendix A, are suspended until 10 calendar days after the COVID-19 state of \nemergency declared by Governor Charles Baker on March 10, 2020 (the “COVID-19 \nState of Emergency”) is lifted in the Commonwealth.  This subsection shall NOT apply \nto any warrant issued for a defendant who has violated a condition of release or probation \nterm pertaining to a stay-away order or other no contact order involving GPS monitoring. \n3.  All existing conditions of release and/or terms of probation that are inconsistent with the \nprinciples of social distancing as outlined by the CDC and/or Department of Public \nHealth (“DPH”)1 shall either (i) not be enforced, (ii) converted by the Probation \nDepartment to a condition consistent with social distancing, (iii) or shall be suspended \nuntil 10 calendar days after the COVID-19 State of Emergency is lifted in the \nCommonwealth (e.g., in person check-in requirements shall be done by video or \ntelephone and drug testing that cannot be completed with adherence to social distancing \nguidelines shall be suspended).  All stay-away and no-contact orders issued as part of any \nconditions of release or terms of probation are to remain in effect and are not impacted by \nthis Order.   \n   \n                                                 \n1 See United States Center for Disease Control, Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 \n(COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities (March 23, 2020) at 4.

REVIEW PROCESS FOR CONSIDERING THE RELEASE OF CERTAIN \nINMATES \nThe following procedures (the “Release Review Process”) shall be expeditiously implemented to \ndetermine whether individuals shall be released from custody, and to do so in a manner that \nbalances and preserves the safety of the public and the safety of those in the Commonwealth’s \ndetention and correctional facilities: \nA.  Creation of Release Review Committees \nIn each county there shall be created a committee (the “Release Review Committee”) \ncomprised of representative(s) from the District Attorney’s Office, representative(s) from the \ndefense bar,2 and representative(s) of the clerk’s office of the Trial Courts.  Where \nappropriate, the District Attorney shall confer with a representative of the Probation \nDepartment, representative(s) from the county Sheriff, a public health advisor, and \nrepresentative(s) of the Department of Correction.  These committees shall be created \nwithin 24 hours of the issuance of this Order and the District Attorney representative(s) \nin each county shall report the composition of this committee to the Special Master \nwithin that 24 hour time period.  Promptly upon issuance of this Order, the Chief Justices \nof the Superior Court, District Court, Boston Municipal Court (where applicable), and \nJuvenile Court shall designate a “Primary Trial Court Judge(s)”, a first back-up, and a second \nback-up at each level, in each county, to hear cases from each county’s Release Review \nCommittee. \nB.  Identification of pre-trial detainees and probationers eligible for the Release Review \nProcess \n1.  Pre-trial detainees and probationers meeting any of the following criteria shall be \nplaced into the Release Review Process and shall be presumed to be released from \ndetention, subject to the individualized assessment set forth in the Release Review \nProcess described herein: \na.  Any person who has not been determined to be dangerous under G.L. c. 276, § \n58A and is charged with an offense other than (i) an Excluded Offense, or (ii) \na violation of a stay-away or no-contact order issued as a condition of \nprobation; \nb.  Any person who is currently detained awaiting trial on a cash bail of $5,000 or \nless, has not been determined to be dangerous under G.L. c. 276, § 58A, who \nwould be otherwise eligible for release if they could post the bail imposed in \ntheir case, and has not been incarcerated for an Excluded Offense in the last 5 \nyears; \nc.  Any person who is currently detained awaiting a probation violation hearing, \nunless (i) the person has been incarcerated for an Excluded Offense in the last \n                                                 \n2 The Petitioners shall be responsible for convening a team of attorneys to represent the defense bar in the Release \nReview Committees and shall assist with creating release plans for inmates released pursuant to this Order. \n3 \n\n5 years, (ii) the violation involved an alleged commission of an Excluded \nOffense, or (iii) the violation involved failure to comply with a  stay-away or \nno contact order;  \nd.  Any person currently detained only for civil contempt; and \ne.  Any person being held in pre-trial detention who is not being detained on \ndangerousness grounds pursuant to G.L. c. 276, § 58A and who is either (a) \nage 60 or older as of the date of this Order or (b) suffers from a high-risk \ncondition as defined by the CDC3 that renders them more vulnerable to the \nCOVID-19 virus. \n2.  For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Order shall prohibit any pre-trial detainee \nor probationer from seeking any individual relief not available to such person under \nthis Order, nor shall such person’s ineligibility for relief under this Order be \nconsidered as a factor in a court’s decision to award relief outside of this Order.  \nC.  Release Review Committee Process \n1.  The representative(s) from the Trial Court and the District Attorney’s office, \nwith assistance from the representatives of the county Sheriff’s office, Probation \nDepartment, and Department of Correction as necessary to further the interests \nof justice, shall identify inmates who meet the criteria set forth in this Order and \nplace them into the Release Preview Process within 48 hours or less of the entry \nof this Order.  The list shall be provided to the representative(s) of the defense bar as \nsoon as it is compiled. \n2.  Notice shall be given to all inmates identified by the Release Review Committee as \neligible for review.   The representative(s) of the defense bar shall promptly be \npermitted to convene video or teleconferences with any inmates identified by the \nRelease Review Committee.  The county Sheriff’s offices and Department of \nCorrection will coordinate with the representative(s) of the defense bar to facilitate \nsuch communications. \n3.  No later than 72 hours after the entry of the Order, the representative(s) from \nthe District Attorney’s office, in consultation with the representatives of, where \nappropriate, the county Sheriff, Probation Department, and Department of \nCorrection, shall identify those inmates whose release the Commonwealth will \noppose, and those whose release it will not oppose.  \na.  The District Attorney’s office shall promptly notify the appropriate Primary \nTrial Court Judge(s) for that county and the representative(s) of the defense \n                                                 \n3 People with high-risk conditions are those with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma, serious heart \nconditions, are immunocompromised (including from cancer treatment), severe obesity, or certain underlying \nmedical conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, and liver disease. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): People \nwho are at higher risk for severe illness, CDC (Mar. 26, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-\nextra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html.  \n4 \n\nbar as to any objections, and provide the representative(s) of the defense bar \nand the Primary Trial Court Judge(s) with any materials the District Attorney \nrelied upon in reviewing the files of all inmates whose release the Primary \nTrial Court Judge(s) will be asked to consider.4  The Primary Trial Court \nJudge(s) may request additional materials to aid in their decision making.  \nb.  With respect to any inmates for whom the parties agree release is appropriate \nin a specific county, the parties shall provide the Primary Trial Court \nJudge(s) with a short statement in support of the release of the agreed upon \ngroup of inmates.  The Primary Trial Court Judge(s) shall expeditiously act \non the recommendation of the District Attorney’s Office without further \nhearing, unless the Primary Trial Court Judge(s) deems a hearing to be \nnecessary. \nc.  For those inmates whose release it will oppose, the District Attorney’s office \nshall provide to the representative(s) from the defense bar and the Primary \nTrial Court Judge(s) a brief written opposition stating the grounds for \nobjection5.  \nd.  In the event that release of an individual may compromise an on-going law \nenforcement investigation for an Excluded Crime, the District Attorney shall \npresent such information ex parte to the Primary Trial Court Judge(s) for in-\ncamera review.  \n4.  Within five (5) calendar days of the entry of this Order, the Primary Trial \nCourt Judge(s) will convene an expedited, short-form video or telephonic \nconference hearing regarding the release of any inmates that the Primary Trial \nCourt Judge(s) has not already ordered released.  The Primary Trial Court \nJudge(s) shall implement any necessary procedures to give effect to the terms of this \nOrder and shall hear as many cases in each session as is practicable.  Evidence shall \nconsist of the case file and testimony to be presented in the form of affidavits to the \nextent practicable, to obviate the need for live testimony.  If necessary to resolve all \nobjections on a particular category of inmates, such hearings may take place over \nmultiple days, including weekends.  Inmates’ presence at this hearing shall be \nwaived.  The Primary Trial Court Judge(s) is encouraged to place a priority on cases \nin which there is no objection.  \na. The Primary Trial Court Judge(s) shall order an inmate’s release (subject to \nthe limitations set forth below) if the judge determines by a preponderance of \nthe evidence, applying the presumptions concerning release described above, \n                                                 \n4 The case file reviewed by the Primary Trial Court Judge(s) shall include, but is not limited to, the charging \ndocuments (criminal complaints or indictments), police report or brief statement of facts, CARI Report, and reasons \nfor bail issued by the judge who presided over arraignment.  Counsel for the defendant shall also provide any \navailable information regarding a release plan if the defendant is released.  \n5 In the interest of expediency, the statement need not be lengthy or a formal brief.  It need only provide sufficient \ninformation to identify the bases of the objection (e.g., inmate has multiple violent prior offenses or inmate cannot \nreturn to his community because his wife/partner has an active abuse prevention order against him). \n5 \n\nthat an inmate’s release is appropriate in order to further the public health \ngoals of limiting density, improving opportunities for social distancing, and \nmanaging care, and does not otherwise pose an unreasonable risk to public \nsafety in the circumstances.  In making this determination, the Primary Trial \nCourt Judge(s) shall consider whether there exists any credible concern of \ndomestic violence, and shall weigh any such concern against release. \nb.  The Probation Department, with input and assistance from counsel for the \ninmate, shall recommend appropriate conditions of release for any inmates \nreleased through the Release Review Process and shall oversee compliance \nwith any conditions of release.  The Primary Trial Court Judge(s) shall adopt \nor modify the conditions recommended by the Probation Department. \nc.  The period during which a person is released pursuant to the Release \nReview Process is considered an excluded period under Mass. R. Crim. P. \n36. \n5.  If an inmate, who is released through the Review Release Process violates the \nconditions of their release, it will be treated as an Abuse of Furlough under 103 CMR \n§ 463.17 and the matter will be referred to Probation who will take such action and \nmake such recommendation to the Primary Trial Court Judge(s) as they deem \nappropriate. \n6.  Within 14 calendar days after the COVID-19 State of Emergency has been lifted in \nthe Commonwealth, the Primary Trial Court Judge(s) will hold a hearing for further \nreview of any inmate released.  \nD.  Appeals of Release Review Committee Decisions \n1.  The order of the Designated Primary Trial Court Judge(s) may be appealed on an \nemergency basis in a summary manner to a Single Justice of the Supreme Judicial \nCourt.  A notice of appeal in any such case must be filed within two business days of \nthe entry of the order with the clerk of the trial court issuing the order, with a copy \nfiled with the clerk of the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County. \na.  Should a release order be appealed, the release order shall be stayed pending \nexpedited review by the Single Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court. \n2.  The record on appeal shall consist of any materials and information reviewed by the \nPrimary Trial Court Judge(s) in issuing the order.  \nE.  Exceptions to Release \n1.  In the following circumstances, an inmate subject to this Order shall not be released, \nabsent further instructions from the Primary Trial Court Judge(s) for that county: \na.  For any inmate subject to this Order who has tested positive for COVID-19 or has \nbeen identified as presumptively positive for COVID-19, the facility in which the \n6 \n\ninmate is housed shall immediately notify the parties, and the county health \ndepartment of the inmate’s medical condition, and shall not release the inmate \nwithout further instructions from the Primary Trial Court Judge(s) for that county.  \nIn such cases, the parties shall immediately confer with the assigned infectious \ndisease expert to ensure an appropriate plan is in place for isolating the inmate \nand ensuring the inmate’s medical treatment and/or mandatory self-quarantine. \nb.  For any inmate subject to this Order who notifies the superintendent of the facility \nwhere he or she is being detained that he or she does not wish to be released from \ndetention pursuant to this Order because of housing, health, or safety concerns, \nthe superintendent shall immediately notify the Committee of the inmate’s \nwishes, provide a written statement from the inmate to that effect, and provide an \nopportunity for the inmate to confer with the defense bar representative on the \nRelease Review Committee.  If the inmate maintains that he or she does not want \nto be released, the superintendent shall not release the inmate without further \ninstructions from the Primary Trial Court Judge(s) for that county.  \nF.  Release Review Process Evaluation \n1.  The Special Master, within seven (7) calendar days after the entry of this Order, \nshall convene a working group to assess the Release Review Process and make \nany necessary adjustments to ensure the process is meeting the stated goals of \nresponding to the COVID-19 State of Emergency. \nIII.  CONVICTED AND SENTENCED INMATES AND PROBATIONERS  \n1. While the COVID-19 State of Emergency remains in effect, Mass. R. Crim. P. 29 is \nhereby modified to allow the following categories of convicted and sentenced inmates \nto seek emergency relief regarding revision or revocation of their sentences, \nregardless of the time restrictions set forth in Rule 29, on an expedited basis from the \nTrial Courts:  \na.  Pre-release inmates at “minimum security facilities” with release plans in place;  \ni.  For the purposes of this Order, “minimum security facilities” are those \ndefined by the Massachusetts Department of Correction as facilities that \ncontain inmates “who do not pose a significant risk to security and have \ndemonstrated a willingness to comply with the rules and are afforded \ngreater autonomy.”6 \nb.  Inmates who have been approved for parole, but have not yet been released; \nc.  Inmates who are within 60 calendar days of their release date excluding inmates \nwho are serving minimum mandatory sentences; and  \n                                                 \n6 See Massachusetts Department of Correction, Prison Security Levels (Online at https://www.mass.gov/service-\ndetails/prison-security-levels). \n7 \n\nd.  Inmates who were convicted for an offense other than an Excluded Offense; \nprovided that inmates who are serving a minimum mandatory sentence shall not \nbe eligible to seek emergency relief under this provision.  \n2.  The Primary Trial Court Judge(s) in each county who are dedicated to the Release \nReview Process pursuant to Section II.A above shall hear such emergency Rule 29 \nmotions on an expedited basis, and such motions shall be considered “emergency \nmatters” under District Court Standing Order 2-20, Superior Court Standing Order 3-\n20, and Juvenile Court Standing Order 1-20.   \n3.  In evaluating whether to grant relief pursuant to an expedited Rule 29 motion, the \nPrimary Trial Court Judge may consider, in weighing the interests of justice, the risk \nthat an inmate may either contract COVID-19 or infect others as a factor in \ndetermining if the release is appropriate. \n4.  The Primary Trial Court Judge(s) shall order an inmate’s release if the judge \ndetermines by a preponderance of the evidence that an inmate’s release is \nappropriate in order to further the public health goals of limiting density, improving \nopportunities for social distancing, and managing care, and does not otherwise pose \nan unreasonable risk to public safety in the circumstances.  If the Primary Trial \nCourt Judge determines release is appropriate, the judge shall order relief consistent \nwith addressing the current public health crisis, such as a stay of the inmate’s \nsentence until fourteen (14) days after the COVID-19 State of Emergency is lifted in \nthe Commonwealth.  If an inmate has more than 180 calendar days left on his \nsentence, the Primary Court Trial Judge shall order that the inmate return to custody \nwithin fourteen (14) days after the COVID-19 State of Emergency is lifted in the \nCommonwealth.  In making this determination, the Primary Trial Court Judge(s) \nshall consider whether there exists any credible concern of domestic violence, and \nshall weigh any such concern against release. \n5.  For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Order shall prohibit any convicted or \nsentenced inmate from seeking any individual relief not available to such person \nunder this Order, nor shall such person’s ineligibility for relief under this Order be \nconsidered as a factor in a court’s decision to award relief outside of this Order.  \nIV.  RIGHTS OF VICTIMS \n1.  Nothing in this order suspends the obligations of District Attorneys and other law \nenforcement agencies to share information with crime victims pursuant to G.L. c. \n258B.  Each county’s District Attorney’s office, in connection with local law \nenforcement, shall, to the fullest extent practicable under the circumstances, provide \nnotice to victims of the accelerated release of inmates under this order.  \na.  When contact with a victim cannot be made for any reason, to help ensure the \nvictim’s safety, the prosecutor shall notify the police department in the town of \nthe victim’s last known residence of the inmate’s accelerated release. \n8 \n\n2.  However, especially in light of the public health emergency posed by COVID-19, the \ninability of the Commonwealth to provide the type of notice called for by the statute \nshall not be grounds for the continued detention of an inmate otherwise entitled to \nrelease under this Order.7   \nV.  REPORTING BY PRISONS AND JAILS  \n1.  In order to effectuate the purposes of this Order and the underlying public health \ngoals, this Court requests that while the COVID-19 State of Emergency remains in \neffect, each institution in Massachusetts holding detained, committed, or imprisoned \npersons provide to the Attorney General’s Office and the Special Master on each \nTuesday and Friday by 5PM: \na.  Overall inmate population; \nb.  Number of COVID-19 tests and number of positive results for all inmates, \ncorrectional officers, or other staff members, including contactors;  \nc.  Measures being taken to treat and isolate persons who have either tested positive \nor are symptomatic; \nd.  Other measures being taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19;  \ne.  Availability of COVID-19 test kits, nasal swabs, thermometers, masks and \ngloves; and \nf.  Number of inmates released pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Order. \n2.  The Court recommends that each correctional facility consult with an infectious \ndisease and/or public health expert to evaluate the facility’s ability to abide by the \nCDC Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in \nCorrectional and Detention Facilities8 and make recommendations, as necessary. \n \n/s/ Brien T.

In the Matter of Chapman, 482 Mass. 1012, 1017 (2019) (“Nothing in G.L. c. 258B suggests that the remedy \nfor a failure to provide any of the various types of notice called for by the statute is to keep an individual in custody \nwho is otherwise entitled to release.”). \n8 Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention \nFacilities, CDC (Mar. 23, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/guidance-correctional-\ndetention.pdf. \n9 \n\nAPPENDIX A \n \nFor purposes of this Order, the following are considered an “Excluded Offense”:  \n \ni)  Violent crimes as defined in G.

      "title": "Emergency Petition of Proposed Intervenor Prisoners Legal Services of Massachusetts",
      "text": "Supreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth    Full Court:   SJC-12926      Filed: 3/30/2020 6:59 PM\n \nCOMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS \nSUPREME JUDICIAL COURT \nNo. SJC-12926 \n \n______________________________________________________ \n \nCOMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC COUNSEL SERVICES and \nMASSACHUSETTS ASSOCIATION OF CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYERS, \nPetitioners \n \nv. \n \nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE TRIAL COURT, et al. \nRespondents \n______________________________________________________ \n \n \nEMERGENCY PETITION OF PROPOSED INTERVENOR \nPRISONERS LEGAL SERVICES OF MASSACHUSETTS \n \n  Prisoners’ Legal Services of Massachusetts’ has for nearly fifty years fought for the \nsafety and welfare of incarcerated people in Massachusetts.  Now, as COVID-19 enters \nMassachusetts prisons and jails, these individuals are faced with potential catastrophe.  PLS \nfully supports the Emergency Petition filed by the Committee for Public Counsel Services \nand the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (“the Petition”).  PLS files \nthis petition in order to ensure that the experiences of the people living in our correctional \nfacilities are fully heard, and so that our expertise and knowledge can be utilized in \ndeveloping a solution to this unprecedented threat to the health and safety of both prisoners \nand correctional staff.    \nI.  Interest and Expertise of the Petitioner \n \nPrisoners’ Legal Services (PLS) is a not-for-profit legal services corporation founded \nin 1972 that provides civil legal assistance to people who are incarcerated in Massachusetts \nstate prisons and county jails and houses of correction.  PLS’ mission is to defend all \nprisoners’ legal, civil and human rights, and to advocate for reform of the correctional system \n11 \n\nthrough litigation, individual advocacy, education, and public policy work. Its priorities are \n(1) inadequate medical and mental health care (2) extreme conditions of confinement (3) \nexcessive use of force (4) solitary confinement and (5) medical parole.  \nPLS’ decades of litigation and advocacy give it a unique understanding of prison \nconditions and treatment.   Many of our cases currently in litigation or various stages of \ncompliance monitoring deal with matters directly relevant to the Petition, including parole, \ninadequate medical and mental health care, and extreme conditions of confinement.1   PLS \nopens approximately 2000 new client intakes a year, many of which deal with inadequate \nmedical or mental health care and unsafe or unsanitary conditions of confinement.2 Every \nday, PLS receives dozens of letters and phone calls from prisoners.  PLS staff also visit \nprisons and jails on an almost daily basis.  It therefore has a unique understanding of the \nliving conditions and daily experiences of the men and women confined in our prisons and \njails.3 \n                                                 \n1  See, e.g., Reaves v. Department of Correction, 404 F.Supp.3d 520 (D. Mass. 2019) (ruling that DOC is \nincapable of providing adequate medical care to quadriplegic prisoner and ordering his transfer to non-\ncorrectional hospital);  Briggs v. Department of Correction, C.A. No. 1:15-cv-40162-GAO (2019 class action \nsettlement providing accommodations to deaf and hard of hearing prisoners);  Fowler, et al. v.  Commissioner of \nCorrection, C.A. NO. 1:15CV12298- NMG (2018 class action settlement mandating DOC provide prisoners \naccess to modern Hepatitis C medications); John Does 1-10  v. Commissioner of Correction, Suffolk No. 1984-\nCV-00828 (2019 class action challenge to DOC confinement of men civilly committed under Section 35);  \nArcher v. Massachusetts Parole Board, Suffolk No. 1384-CV-04149 (2018 Settlement Agreement governing \nparole revocation proceedings);  Battle, et al. v Sheriff, Bristol County, Bristol C.A. No. 1873-cv-00020  (class \naction challenging solitary confinement practices and mental health care  at the Bristol County House of \nCorrection and Jail); Buckman and Cruz v. Massachusetts Department of Correction,  SJC-12725 (declaring \nunlawful DOC’s  regulations implementing the medical parole statute); Cantell, et al. v. Commissioner of \nCorrection, et al., Suffolk C.A. No. 1284-cv-00250 (class action on behalf of all prisoners who are or will be \nconfined in long term non-disciplinary solitary confinement seeking to protect their due process rights); Todd v. \nCommissioner of Correction, Suffolk C.A. No. 1884-cv-03972 (challenge to extreme and unreasonable \nvisitation restrictions in the Department of Correction); Pearson v. Hodgson, Case No. 1:18-cv-11130 (class \naction challenge to exorbitant prison telephone costs); Minich, et al. v. Department of Correction, Norfolk C.A. \nNo. 1584CV00278 (class action settlement based on excessive and unnecessary use of seclusion and restraint at \nBridgewater State Hospital);  Converse v. Massachusetts Department of Correction, et al.,, Suffolk C.A.  No. \n18-3295 (serious injury to prisoner with developmental disabilities assaulted by officers while on mental health \nwatch).  \n2 Since Jan. 1, 2020, PLS has opened 600 new intakes, 140 of which related to inadequate medical or mental \nhealth care, and 100 of which related to unsafe or unsanitary conditions of confinement.   \n3 For example, just since January of this year, PLS visited more than 100 prisoners who have complained about \nexcessive force and extreme conditions at Souza Baranowski Correctional Center. \n11 \n\n PLS has also filed 14 petitions for medical parole and has provided assistance and \nadvice on medical parole to attorneys and family members.  With the advent of COVID-19, \nPLS is attempting to file as many additional petitions as possible, and is working with the \nDOC, the DOC’s medical provider, members of the Legislature, and community nursing \nhomes to find as many placements as possible.  \n  PLS participates in official commissions and oversight bodies such as the Restrictive \nHousing Oversight Committee and Special Commission to Study the Health and Safety of \nLGBTQI prisoners. PLS also engages in policy advocacy, participating actively in the \npassage of the 2018 Criminal Justice Reform Act and other initiatives to improve policy \nrelated to prisons and prisoners. PLS additionally plays a leadership role in the Coalition for \nEffective Public Safety, a group of community organizations engaged in reform of the \ncriminal justice system.  \nPLS is no bystander to the COVID-19 crisis. Staff members receive daily \ncommunication from incarcerated people, their family members, doctors, attorneys and even \nfrom prison staff, and have been in constant dialogue with correctional administrators and \npublic safety officials.  Many PLS clients are geriatric or otherwise especially vulnerable to \ndeath and serious complications from COVID-19.  Many do not have pending criminal cases \nor appeals, and are, therefore, unrepresented by CPCS or MACDL attorneys.  PLS is \neffectively their only recourse for the protection of their legal rights.   \nPLS is thus a significant stakeholder in this crisis, with an obligation to seek relief for \nits clients and significant resources to bring to the table. Without immediate action some of \nits clients will die.   On March 21, 2020 the first Massachusetts prisoner tested positive for \nCOVID-19, and by March 29, twelve prisoners and seven correctional staff persons had \ntested positive.  PLS understands that two of the twelve diagnosed prisoners have already had \nto be hospitalized for treatment.  This number will soon increase exponentially since COVID-\n11 \n\n19 cannot be controlled in a correctional setting.  In New York City’s Rikers Island jail, the \nrate of infection is seven times higher than in the rest of the city and 87 times higher than in \nthe U.S. overall,4 and the number of infected prisoners has soared even as the City has \nreduced its jail population to reduce the risk.5  COVID-19 is like a tsunami that is now \napproaching the Massachusetts correctional system.  Once it strikes it will be too late.  This \npetition seeks to ensure that immediate action is taken to protect the PLS clients from \ngrievous harm up to and including death.  \nII.  Relief Sought \n \nPLS endorses the relief sought by the Petitioners and welcomes the appointment of \nthe Special Master as ordered by the Court on March 25, 2020.  If granted intervenor status, \nPLS will bring its unique knowledge and expertise to assist the court in developing and \nimplementing appropriate relief. \nPLS seeks relief beyond that sought in the Petition, including: (1) the release of all \nindividuals civilly committed to a correctional facility under G.L. c.123 § 35, whether held at \nthe Massachusetts Alcohol and Substance Abuse Center operated by the Department of \nCorrection or the Hampden County Jail and House of Correction; (2) consideration for \nrelease of  all persons  civilly committed to the Massachusetts Treatment Center who have \nnot been adjudicated a sexually dangerous person under G.L. c. 123A, § 14, as well as all \npersons committed to Bridgewater State Hospital for evaluation of competency or criminal \nresponsibility; (3) no person should be categorically excluded from relief due to the \nunderlying criminal offense, without consideration of actual dangerousness; (4) consideration \nfor release of  all individuals over 50, regardless of  whether they are sentenced under G.L. c \n                                                 \n4 See “Prisoners At Rikers Say It’s Like A ‘Death Sentence’ As Coronavirus Spreads,” Huffington Post, March \n20, 2020, available at https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rikers-prisoners-\ncoronavirus_n_5e7e705ec5b6256a7a2a995d  (accessed March 30, 2020). \n5 As of Monday, March 30, at least 167 people currently detained in New York City jails had COVID-19, an \nincrease of more than 60 percent since Friday, March 27. Another 114 jail staff members had also tested \npositive for the illness.  https://queenseagle.com/all/2020/3/30/at-least-167-nyc-inmates-114-jail-staffers-now-\nhave-covid-19 \n11 \n\n265; (5) an order that the Parole Board (a) shall explicitly consider COVID-19 when it \nevaluates whether release is “incompatible with the welfare of society” under G.L. c. 127, § \n130, and (b) shall presumptively grant parole to all parole eligible individuals unless it makes \na determination based on clear and convincing  evidence that the person cannot live at liberty \nwithout violating the law. \nA.  Men incarcerated pursuant to G.L. c. 123, § 35 \nThe Court should address the plight of people civilly committed to correctional \nfacilities for treatment of alcohol and substance use disorders (SUD) under G.L. c. 123, § 35, \nwhich was not raised by Petitioners.   Nearly 250 men are currently civilly committed under \nSection 35 to the DOC’s Massachusetts Alcohol and Substance Abuse Center and the Section \n35 program run by the Hampden County Sheriff’s Office under agreement with the DOC.6   \nThe rapid turnover of this population, with stays averaging only 30-40 days,  heightens the \ndanger of community transmission since effective intake screening is impossible. This \npopulation has particular vulnerabilities to COVID-19, as they have high rates of hepatitis C \nand other infectious diseases and are generally in poor health.  \nFurther, the congregate living arrangements and group programs make it extremely \ndifficult or impossible to provide social distancing.  Several MASAC patients on March 25 \nfiled a motion in Briggs v. Dep’t of Corr. (D. Ma. No. 1:15-cv-40162-GAO), stating that \nduring the COVID outbreak over 80 patients eat together in the dining hall “inches in \nproximity.”  The motion also contains multiple affidavits describing the use of unclean \nportable toilets.  Finally, PLS’ extensive investigation of the conditions under which these \nmen are held, undertaken in separate litigation7  has produced dozens of consistent accounts \ndescribing unsanitary conditions during the initial detoxification period, including blood, \nurine, vomit and feces, with extremely limited cleaning.   \n                                                 \n6 See DOC Weekly Count Sheets for March 23, 2020.  https://www.mass.gov/doc/weekly-inmate-count-\n3232020/download  \n7 Doe et al. v. Mici et al. (Suffolk Super. No.. 1984CV00828).     \n11 \n\nThe purpose of Section 35 confinement is negated by the fact that, according to the \naffidavits filed in the Briggs case, only 0-2 substance use disorder classes are held each \nday.  The state is exposing a vulnerable population of men with SUD, not charged with any \ncrime, to the potentially deadly risks of the COVID-19 outbreak – while at the same time \nhaving little or no ability to safely continue treatment programs.   \nB.  People Civilly Committed at the Massachusetts Treatment Center and \nBridgewater State Hospital \n \nThe largest outbreak so far of COVID-19 is at the Massachusetts Treatment Center.  \nAs of March 27, ten prisoners, one medical staff person, and one correctional staff person \ntested positive for COVID-19.  The Court should consider this population eligible for relief, \nparticularly those who have completed their criminal sentence, and who have not been \nadjudicated a sexually dangerous person under G.L. c. 123A, § 14. The Massachusetts \nTreatment Center is on the same complex as Bridgewater State Hospital. Relief for persons at \nBridgewater State Hospital should also be implemented, particularly for those committed for \nevaluation of competency or criminal responsibility, but not determined to need hospital level \ncare.  \nC.  Individuals over 50 and those Convicted of Chapter 265 offenses.    \nThe Petition asks for release of all men over 60 only if they have not been sentenced \nfor “crimes against the person” under G.L. c. 265.  See Petition at 30.  By contrast, it seeks \nrelease of all persons with “a condition or disease that puts them at increased risk of severe \nCOVID-19 complications and death.  Id.  This is unreasonably restrictive for several reasons.  \n First, advanced age is itself a condition which places a person at increased risk for \nsuffering complications or death from COVID-19, and therefore age should be treated as any \nother such condition.   According to the Center for Disease control, 8 out of 10 deaths from \nCOVID-19 have been persons 65 years old or older, with this age group disproportionally \n11 \n\nrequiring hospitalization and intensive care.8  At least one new study has placed the age of \nincreased risk far lower, with people age 50 and older being “around 2-and-a-half times more \nlikely to progress to a severe case of COVID-19.”9  Furthermore, prisoners are subject to \n“accelerated aging” and are generally considered old at age 50 or 55 because of their \ngenerally poorer underlying health history and conditions in prison.10   \n[A]round age 50 prisoners start to contend with the health problems more often \nassociated with people far older. The stress of staying safe behind bars, personal \nfinancial woes, drug or alcohol withdrawal, and a history of poor health care can \nspeed up the aging process for inmates... Most recent studies on the subject have \nfound that prisoners in their 50s start showing signs of deteriorating health that those \noutside prison don’t see until significantly later. In 2007, three Pennsylvania \nresearchers interviewed 51 male inmates in their state with an average age of 57.3 \nyears and 33 men in the community with an average age of 72.2. They found that \nbetween the two groups, rates of high cholesterol, high blood pressure, poor vision, \nand arthritis suggested that the health of male inmates was comparable to men 15 \nyears older. Dr. Brie Williams, a professor of medicine at the University of California, \nSan Francisco, worked on a 2012 survey of 247 male and female inmates at the San \nFrancisco County Jail with an average age of 59. They reported having poor or fair \nhealth, chronic lung disease, and recent falls, at rates similar to people on the outside \nwho are 71.7 years old. 11 \n \nSecondly, no person should be categorically excluded from relief due to the \nunderlying criminal offense, without consideration of actual dangerousness.  As discussed in \nPLS’ Amicus Letter, Chapter 265 includes a wide range of offenses not all of which are even \n                                                 \n8 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications/older-adults.html (visited \nMarch 29, 2020). \n9 See “Study Calculates Just How Much Age, Medical Conditions Raise Odds Of Severe COVID-19,” National \nPublic Radio,   https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/22/819846180/study-calculates-\njust-how-much-age-medical-conditions-raise-odds-of-severe-covid (accessed march 30, 202). \n10 See Public Health Behind Bars, Chapter 5, Growing Older: Challenges of Prisoner and Re-entry for the aging \npopulation, p. 56 (2007) (“In the community, geriatrics is the discipline of medicine specializing in care of the \naged, defined as 65 years and older. In prison, the age at which an inmate is deemed ‘geriatric’ varies from state \nto state (Lemieux, Dyeson, & Castiglione, 2002). In some states, inmates as young as 50 are defined as geriatric; \nin other states, inmates are not considered geriatric until they reach age 55 or 60 (Anno et al., 2004; Lemieux et \nal., 2002). Despite these differing definitions, there is consensus that inmates undergo a process of accelerated \naging compared to their age-matched counterparts outside of prison (Aday, 2003))”;  see also  Brie A. Williams, \nMD et al., “Addressing the Aging Crisis in U.S. Criminal Justice Health Care,”  J. Am. Geriatrc Soc. 2012 Jun; \n60(6): 1150–1156 available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3374923/ (visited March 29, \n2020) (““Accelerated aging” takes into account the high prevalence of risk factors for poor health that are \ncommon in incarcerated persons, such as a history of substance abuse, head trauma, poor healthcare, and low \neducational attainment and socioeconomic status.4,5 While empirical studies of accelerated aging in prisoners \nare lacking, research shows that incarcerated individuals age 50 or older are significantly more likely to suffer \nfrom one or more chronic health conditions or disability than their community-dwelling counterparts.”). \n11  Maurice Chammah,“Do You Age Faster in Prison?” (Marshall Project, August 4, 2015) available at \nhttps://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/08/24/do-you-age-faster-in-prison (visited March 29, 2020).   \n11 \n\nfelonies, and it is not appropriate to block relief for all convicted under that statute.  Medical \nparole does not exclude this group of offenses, see G.L. c. 127, § 119A, and it makes no \nsense to exclude them from COVID-19 relief. \nThird, it is well known that people largely “age out” of crime, meaning prisoners over \nthe age of 50 simultaneously are at high risk for COVID-19 and low risk to public safety.  \nMany of those convicted of more serious Chapter 265 offenses have already spent decades in \nprison and no longer pose any threat to public safety.  It is irrational to categorically assume \nthat geriatric prisoners convicted under Chapter 265 are more dangerous than younger \nprisoners convicted of non-Chapter 265 offenses.  \nD.  Parole  \nThe relief requested in the CPCS/MACDL petition excludes from accelerated parole \nconsideration persons who were convicted under Chapter 265.  As stated above, no person \nshould be categorically excluded on this basis and the relief considered in this case must be \ninclusive and comprehensive in order to mitigate the threat of COVID-19.   \nIn addition, the Parole Board has suspended hearings for those serving life sentences \nbecause these hearings “are open to the public and frequently involve multiple witnesses and \nspectators.”  Response to Petition by the Chief Justice of the Trial Court, DOC, Parole Board, \nProbation Service, and The Attorney General, p. 15 (citing Affidavit of Parole Board Chair \nGloriann Moroney, ¶ 11).  Yet many or most prisoners serving life sentences have spent \ndecades in prison, are vulnerable due to age, and long ago aged out of dangerousness; they \nshould not be discriminated against because of COVID-19.  The Parole Board has also cut \nback on House of Correction hearings as it tries to implement video hearings.  Id.   \nPLS asks that the Board be allowed to grant parole without holding a hearing if it \nconcludes the person poses no demonstrated risk to public safety.  More generally, consistent \nwith proposed Legislation, PLS requests that the Board grant parole to all prisoners at the \n11 \n\ntime of eligibility “unless it determines by clear and convincing evidence that, if the prisoner \nis released with appropriate conditions and community supervision, the prisoner will not live \nand remain at liberty without violating the law.”  See H. 1541 (\"An Act Establishing \nPresumptive Parole\").  Furthermore, in determining whether or not release would be \n“incompatible with the welfare of society,” as required by G.L.c. 127, § 130, the Board must \nexpressly consider whether the failure to release would adversely impact efforts to control the \nspread of COVID-19. \nIII.  Legal Claims \n \nPLS endorses the legal claims set forth in the CPCS/MACDL petition.  In addition, \nreleases are mandated under the Due Process Clause and the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution.   \nA.  Violations of the Due Process Rights of Pre-trial Detainees and Individuals \nCivilly Committed. \nIn Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2473 - 74 (2015),  the Supreme Court \nheld that a pretrial detainee alleging excessive force in violation of the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment must show only that the use of force was “objectively \nunreasonable.”  In contrast to cases brought by sentenced prisoners under the Eighth \nAmendment, “the defendant’s state of mind is not a matter that a plaintiff is required to \nprove.” Id. at 2472.  After Kingsley, numerous courts have held that subjective motive or \nintent has no role to play in any form of condition-of-confinement case brought by pre-trial \ndetainees or those civilly committed to correctional facilities, not just those involving \nexcessive force.  See Hardeman v. Curran, 933 F.3d 816 (7th Cir. 2019); Colbruno v. \nKessler, 928 F.3d 1155, 1161–63 (10th Cir. 2019); Darnell v. Pineiro, 849 F.3d 17, 34–35 \n(2d Cir. 2017); Castro v. Cnty. of L.A., 833 F.3d 1060, 1070–71 (9th Cir. 2016) (en banc).  \nAccordingly, the continued confinement during the COVID-19 emergency of (a) \npretrial detainees, including individuals committed to Bridgewater State Hospital under G.L. \n11 \n\nc. 123 for evaluation of competency or criminal responsibility, and who pose little risk to \npublic safety; (b) men civilly committed to correctional facilities under G.L. c. 123,§ 35; and \n(c) men civilly committed to the Massachusetts Treatment Center but not adjudicated a \nsexually dangerous person under G.L. c. 123A, § 14,  violates their due process rights under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment and article 12. \nB.  Violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights of Sentenced \nPrisoners.  \nConditions that pose an unreasonable risk of death or serious harm to the health of \nsentenced prisoners violate the constitutional protections of the Eighth Amendment and \nArticle 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.  See Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. \n25, 33 (1993) (“That the Eighth Amendment protects against future harm to inmates is not a \nnovel proposition”); Good v. Comm’r of Corr., 417 Mass. 329, 336 (1994) (“An inmate need \nnot wait until he suffers actual harm . . . a claim is made out if there is a substantial risk that \nthe inmate will suffer serious harm as a result of the conditions of his confinement”). By their \npolicies, practices, acts, and omissions, the Department of Correction, the Parole Board, and \nthe County Sheriffs are subjecting sentenced prisoners, particularly those who are elderly or \nmedically compromised, to an imminent risk of serious infection or death from COVID-19 in \nviolation of the Eighth Amendment and Article 26. Finally, in interpreting article 26 PLS \nsubmits that the Court should apply the Kingsley standard, thereby making the subjective \nintent or good faith of correctional officials irrelevant.  \nCONCLUSION \n  The crisis in Massachusetts jails and prisons, as nationally, is without precedent.  The \nextent of the danger to prisoners, staff, and the general public is impossible to calculate but \ncertainly extreme.   As the state-wide provider of civil legal services to Massachusetts \n11 \n\nprisoners, PLS has a unique role to play in crafting a response to this crisis and a legal duty to \nrepresent the interests of its clients.  The relief sought in this Petition will save lives. \n \nDated: March 30, 2020           Respectfully submitted, \n  \nPRISONERS’ LEGAL SERVICES OF \nMASSACHUSETTS \n  \n  \n                  /s/ \n______________________________ \nELIZABETH MATOS, BBO # 671505 \nJAMES PINGEON, BBO # 541852 \nBONITA TENNERIELLO, BBO # 662132 \nJESSE WHITE, BBO #673332 \nPrisoners Legal Services \n50 Federal Street, 4th Floor \nBoston, MA  02110 \n(617) 482-2773 \nlmatos@plsma.org \njpingeon@plsma.org \nbtenneriello@plsma.org \njwhite@plsma.org \n \n \n \n \nCertificate of Service \nI hereby certify that I have caused a copy of this motion to be served electronically upon each \nof the parties of record on March 30, 2020. \n              ____________________________ \n              Bonita Tenneriello, Esq.  \n \n \n \n11 ",

      "text": "RUTH GREENBERG \n--ATTORNEY AT LAW-- \n450B PARADISE ROAD #166 \nSWAMPSCOTT, MASSACHUSETTS 01907 \n(781) 632-5959 \n \n \nMarch 26, 2020 \nChief Justice Ralph D. Gants \nSupreme Judicial Court \nJohn Adams Courthouse Contact Information \n1 Pemberton Square \nBoston, MA 02108 \n \n  RE:  CPCS, et al v. Chief Justice of the Trial Court \n    SJC-12926 \n \nDear Justice Gants, \n \nI write specifically on behalf of the inmates named, \nall of whom I represent at various stages of the medical \nparole process.  I am certain that I represent the interest \nof many others similarly terminally ill or permanently \nincapacitated currently in the custody of the Department of \nCorrection whose names I do not know who are either \nterminally ill or permanently incapacitated and who might be \nwell be entitled to medical parole, whom DOC has neglected \nto acknowledge and to exercise its statutory authority to \npetition for medical parole on their behalf.  I note with \nparticularity that DOC acknowledges, by way of reply to \npublic records request, that there are nine inmates DOC has \ndetermined are incompetent to make medical or litigation \nchoices currently confined at MCI Shirley. These inmates \nmight well be entitled to medical parole and DOC needs no \npermission from them to initiate and process medical \npetitions, because medical parole does not require the \nconsent of the medically paroled.    \n \nI write also, unbidden, on behalf of the guards and \nstaff and DOC facilities, their families, and the public, \nall of whom are at great risk when highly infectious disease \nis highly likely to run rampant behind the wall, as outlined \nin the pleading filed by CPCS, et al. Keeping persons who \nare permanently incapacitated and/or terminally ill behind \nthe all at this time increases the risk to these prisoners, \nother prisoners, guards, staff, and all the world. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n I write specifically to urge, when fashioning relief, \ninstead of the category of persons  \n \n“qualified for medical parole” \n \n you see in the pleadings filed by Petitioners, you \ninstead grant specific relief, among other groups, to \n  \n“persons deemed eligible for medical parole because of \nterminal illness or permanent incapacity as diagnosed by a \nlicensed medical provider”.  \n \nThis is a distinction with a real difference; DOC may \notherwise take the position that an inmate is not \n“qualified” for medical parole and thus eligible for \nemergency relief, absent the filing of a petition and a 66-\nday review process.  By that time, given the pace of the \npandemic, relief is highly likely futile. Furthermore, \nplacement for inmates without means may prove impossible.   \nFurthermore, if the 66-day process of qualification results \nin a denial which must be appealed, the current wait time in \nSuperior Court for resolution of such an appeal is \napproximately ten months.  By that time, relief is almost \ncertainly futile. \n \nThe terminally ill exhaust enormous resources.  So do \nthe wheelchair bound at the dialysis unit at Shirley.  So do \nthe clients 60 and over who suffer from preexisting \nconditions placing them at risk.  The difference between a \n60 year old person with hypertension and diabetes being \nimmediately terminally ill and not, given COVID-19, might be \na matter of hours.  Joseph Buckman, age 73, has only one \nlung.  He has been hospitalized six times in the past year.  \nAbdul Mahdi is 89 years old and has not left his wheelchair \nfor nine years. James Judge has Stage Four metastatic \nprostate cancer and only months to live and his mother is \nwilling to take him home.  These people present no risk to \nthe public if released despite convictions of crimes against \na person, and great risk to the public and to DOC staff if \ninfected with COVID-19 while confined.  \n \nFor these reasons, public policy supports the early \nrelease of the terminally ill and permanently incapacitated \nas diagnosed by DOC medical staff or outside providers, \nwithout the 66-day time period waiting for them to be \n“qualified” under the medical parole statute. They should be \ngiven relief.  Even if they have committed crimes in \n2 \n \n\n \n \nviolation of Chapter 265, they present little risk by virtue \nof confirmed immediately terminal illness or incapacity.  \nThe social calculus has changed; they incur greater cost and \ncreate greater risk to society inside than out. In the \nunique public health crisis in which we find ourselves, \nthese at-risk inmates, whose diagnosis and vulnerability is \nconfirmed, should be excused from the 66 day waiting period \nnow required to “qualify” for medical release. \n \nI go further to suggest that DOC be asked, ordered, to \nidentify the terminally ill and permanently incapacitated \ninmates now in DOC custody, and to immediately initiate \npetitions for medical parole on these inmates’ behalf. \nRelief should not be granted only to those inmates with the \ncapacity and strength to self-identify. It should be equally \navailable to all. The statute itself supports your \nconclusion that DOC must now act affirmatively on behalf of \nthese inmates, whose continued imprisonment actually creates \na public health risk. Were the Commissioner to conclude that \nthe release of these terminally ill and incapacitated \ninmates was more compatible with the welfare of society than \nnot, she would be duty bound to grant them medical parole \neven over their (unlikely) objection. Nobody has a right to \nvolunteer to be a prisoner. DOC, as this Court has lately \nacknowledged, has direct access to the medical record of \nevery inmate and knows who is terminally ill and who is not. \nAt a minimum, this Court should direct DOC to process \npetitions for those deemed incompetent at Shirley and \nelsewhere. \n \n            Most respectfully, \n \n \n              Ruth Greenberg \nRG/ls \nEnclosure \ncc:  (see attached list) \n

      "title": "Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins Response to the Motion to Reconsider",
      "text": "Supreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth    Full Court:   SJC-12926      Filed: 4/22/2020 3:14 PM\nCOMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS \nSUPREME JUDICIAL COURT \nSUFFOLK, ss.  No. SJC-12926 \n \nCOMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC COUNSEL SERVICES & ANOTHER, \nPetitioners \n \nv. \n \nCHIEF JUSTICE OF THE TRIAL COURT & OTHERS, \nRespondents \n \n \nSUFFOLK COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY RACHAEL ROLLINS \nRESPONSE TO THE MOTION TO RECONSIDER \n \nSuffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins \nhas  continued  to  work  expeditiously  to  protect  the \npeople  of  Suffolk  County  --  outside  and  inside  the \nprison  walls  --  in  response  to  the  global  health \ncrisis presented by COVID-19. To that end, as of last \nFriday, our staff reviewed more than 630 cases, 563 of \nwhich  were  pre-trial.  Of  the  503  pre-trial  dockets \nreviewed, we assented to 200 motions, representing 127 \n1\nindividuals.   As  of  the  same  date,  we  have  received \nonly  60  post-conviction  motions.  Based  on  these \nmotions and the extraordinary challenges presented by \nthis pandemic we will continue to work as quickly as \npossible but ask the Court to address three issues we \n                                                 \n1\n  Despite the Commonwealth’s assent to 200 motions, \nonly 50 individuals have been released. \n\n \n  2\nsee escalating daily: 1) the lack of public access to \nhearings on emergency matters in the trial court; 2) \nthe lack of widespread testing inside prisons; and 3) \nthe  need  to  implement  a  process  whereby  those \nindividuals  that  remain  incarcerated  can  effectively \nsocial distance. \nTurning  now  to  the  petitioners’  arguments,  they \nurge the Court to allow for presumptive release of a \ncategory  of  post-conviction  defendants  and  to  permit \nthe  allowance  of  a  stay  where  there  is  no  pending \nappeal  or  motion  for  new  trial.  We  respectfully \nrequest that those suggestions be rejected. \nFirst,  though  the  petitioners  treat  pre-trial \ndetainees  and  post-conviction  detainees  as  the  same, \nunder  the  law  they  are  not.  Pre-trial  detainees  are \nmerely accused of a crime; a post-conviction detainee \nhas  been  proven  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  to  have \ncommitted  a  crime.  Additionally,  many  times  a  grand \njury and a trial jury have heard the facts presented \nagainst the defendant and found that the Commonwealth \nhas  met  its  burden.  Legal  standards  concerning  their \nrelease, even in light of extraordinary circumstances, \nshould reflect that significant difference. \n\n \n  3\nSecond, the ability of a judge to allow a stay in \nthe  absence  of  a  pending  post-conviction  motion  or \nappeal  is  constrained.  In  Massachusetts,  a  sentence \nSee\nonce imposed must be executed forthwith.   G.L. c. \n279,  §  4.  The  rules  of  criminal  and  appellate \nprocedure codify that a judge may stay the execution \nof  a  sentence.  Mass.  R.  Crim.  P.  31;  M.R.A.P.  6.  A \njudge also has an inherent authority to issue a stay. \nSee Commonwealth v. Charles\n  , 466 Mass. 63, 72 (2013). \nHowever, inherent authority to stay is limited in that \nsee  Commonwealth  v. \nthe  exercise  must  be  lawful, \nMcLaughlin\n,  431  Mass.  506,  520  (2000),  and  the \ndefendant  must  “satisfy  the  necessary  criteria  for  a \nstay  in  the  execution”  of  his  or  her  sentence, \nCharles\n, 466 Mass. at 75. The necessary criteria, even \nwhere a judge issues a stay under his or her inherent \npower, “are the same as those relating to a stay of \nId\nexecution of sentence pending appeal.”  . at 77. The \ninherent  authority  of  a  judge  to  stay  “‘does  not \nextend  so  far  as  to  permit  a  further  stay  of  the \nsentence  on  independent  grounds  not  affecting  the \nMcLaughlin\nlegality or propriety of the conviction.’”  , \nCommonwealth v. Hayes\n431 Mass. at 517 (quoting  , 170 \n\n \n  4\nMass.  16,  17  (1897)).  Because  of  that,  an  appeal  or \npost-conviction motion which challenges the propriety \nor  legality  of  a  conviction  or  sentence  must  be \npending for a stay to be entered lawfully. \nAny  standard  governing  whether  or  not  it  is \nappropriate  to  grant  a  stay  must  include  not  only  a \nconsideration  of  whether  a  defendant  has  presented  a \ncolorable appellate or post-conviction claim but also \na  weighing  of  the  general  and  specific  health  risks \nposed by the COVID 19 pandemic alongside the risk that \nthe  defendant  will  flee  and  the  danger  posed  by  the \nSee Christie v. Commonwealth\ndefendant’s release.    , 484 \nMass.  397,  398  (2020).  Absent  from  the  petitioners \nproposal  in  its  motion  to  reconsider  is  any  real \nconsideration of those necessary factors. \nCharles\n  is  instructive  on  this  point.  Two  years \nafter  pleading  guilty  to  reduced  charges  related  to \ncontrolled  substances  and  unlawful  possession  of \nammunition,  Charles  moved  to  stay  execution  of  his \nsentence  when  he  learned  of  the  misconduct  in  the \nstate’s Hinton Drug Laboratory. He then filed a motion \nfor  a  new  trial,  raising  claims  pertaining  to  the \nalleged  misconduct  at  Hinton.  The  “magnitude  of  the \n\n \n  5\nserious  allegations  of  serious  and  far-reaching \nmisconduct”  constituted  “exceptional  circumstances” \nthat  warranted  the  judge's  exercise  of  his  inherent \npower  to  stay  the  execution  of  Charles's  sentences \npending the disposition of his motion for a new trial. \nCharles\nIn  ,  the  inherent  power  to  stay  execution  of \nsentence  was  thus  extended:  a  judge  could  do  so  not \njust pending an appeal, but also pending a motion for \nCharles\nnew  trial.  However,  even  in  ,  this  Court \nexpressly held that even in exceptional circumstances \na  defendant  must  still  show  that  he  or  she  has  a \ncolorable post-conviction or appellate claim and that \nSee\nhe  or  she  does  not  pose  a  danger  if  released.   \nCharles\n,  466  Mass.  at  75.  That  holding  echoes \nMcLaughlin Hayes \n and all the way back to the 1800s in \nand  contemplates  that  to  be  a  lawful  exercise  of  a \nstay  there  must  be  a  challenge  to  the  conviction  or \nsentence itself. \nIn  part,  trial  courts  have  not  granted  stays \nallowing  post-conviction  individuals  to  be  released \nbecause  such  stays  have  not  been  requested.  In  the \nover two weeks since this Court issued its decision, \nthe Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office has only \n\n \n  6\nreceived 60 motions to stay, reflecting just 3.3% of \nthe approximately 1,819 individuals serving sentences \n2\nfor convictions arising out Suffolk County cases.  This \ndata suggests that the number of individuals who have \nbeen  released  is  low  because  the  number  of  motions \nseeking to stay their sentences is low. \nGoing forward, in order to facilitate expeditious \nreview  of  such  motions,  the  Suffolk  County  District \nAttorney’s  Office  asks  that  this  Court  give  guidance \nabout  motions  to  stay  and  explain  that  such  motions \nmust contain, in Suffolk County at the very least: \n \n1. the defendant’s name; \n \n2. the docket number(s); \n \n3. the  crime(s)  for  which  the  defendant  was \nsentenced; \n \n4. the sentence received;  \n \n5. where the defendant is housed;  \n \n6. the basis for relief; \n \n7. information  about  which  of  the  CDC’s  20 \nlisted  underlying  medical  conditions  the \ndefendant  has  been  diagnosed  with  rendering \n3\nthem more susceptible to contracting COVID-19.  \n                                                 \n2\n  Of these individuals, 400 are in the custody of \nthe  Suffolk  Sherriff  and  the  remainder  are  in  the \ncustody of the Department of Corrections. \n3\n Based on what is known now, the CDC states that those \nat  high-risk  for  severe  illness  from  COVID-19  are: \npeople  65  years  and  older;  people  who  live  in  a \nCommittee \nnursing home or long-term care facility. See \nfor Pub. Counsel Servs. & Another v. Chief Justice of \nthe Trial Court & Others\n, 484 Mass. 431, at *10, 19 \nn.16  (2020);  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/  2019-\nncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html \n\n \n  7\n \n8. include medical records (or a statement that \nmedical records were requested on a certain \ndate); and \n \n9. a plan for the defendant’s release. \nIt  is  extremely  difficult  to  quickly  respond  to \n4\nmotions that do not contain this basic information.  \nThe  Suffolk  County  District  Attorney’s  Office \nalso requests a reasonable amount of time to respond \nto  such  motions.  As  noted  above  we  have  received  60 \npost-conviction  motions  to  stay,  15  (25%)  of  which \nwere  filed  in  the  past  week  alone.  We  have  already \n                                                                                                                                     \n(last visited April 22, 2020). Additionally, people of \nall  ages  may  be  high-risk  if  they  have  underlying \nmedical  conditions,  particularly  if  not  well \ncontrolled, including those with chronic lung disease \nor moderate to severe asthma, those with serious heart \nconditions, and people who are immunocompromised. Many \nconditions can cause a person to be immunocompromised, \nincluding  cancer  treatment,  smoking,  bone  marrow  or \norgan  transplantation,  immune  deficiencies,  poorly \ncontrolled  HIV  or  AIDS,  and  prolonged  use  of \ncorticosteroids  and  other  immune  weakening \nmedications.  Also  at  risk  are  people  with  severe \nobesity (body mass index of 40 or higher); people with \ndiabetes;  people  with  chronic  kidney  disease \nundergoing dialysis; and people with liver disease. \n4\n  The  efforts  to  move  expeditiously  have  been \nsignificantly  hampered  by  the  inability  to  access \ncritical  data  from  our  law  enforcement  partners, \nincluding  real  time  information  about  those \nindividuals  who  have  actually  been  released.  Enacted \nin 2018, G.L. c. 6A, § 18 ¾ mandates the sharing of \ninformation.  This  simply  is  not  happening.  District \nAttorney Rollins again specifically asks this Court to \nhighlight the urgency of this real need and to order \nthe sharing of information in full compliance of the \nlaw. \n\n \n  8\nresponded  to  24  (40%)  of  these  motions  and  do  so \ntypically  within  four  business  days,  despite  the \nfourteen  day  timeframe  set  forth  in  the  standing \norders.  However,  time  is  required  to  pull  the \nnecessary  trial  files,  to  run  records,  to  obtain \ndisciplinary  reports,  to  try  to  get  medical  records, \nand  to  file  a  written  response  to  each  defendant’s \nmotion. Without the review of those documents, all of \nwhich  are  necessary  to  assess  the  claims,  Assistant \nDistrict  Attorneys  would  be  unable  to  reasonably, \nintelligently,  and  ethically  respond  to  the  filed \nmotion.  Indeed,  22  of  the  50  Superior  Court  post-\nconviction  COVID  motions  in  Suffolk  County  are \nhomicide  convictions.  Each  requires  significant  time \nto  carefully  examine  the  voluminous  trial  record,  to \nensure  that  victim’s  families  are  properly  contacted \nas required by G.L. c. 258B, to respond in writing to \nthe motion, and to have a hearing. None of that can \nreasonably,  intelligently,  effectively  or  ethically \nhappen in 48 hours as the petitioners suggest. \nThe Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office has \nalso recognized two distinct problems that have arisen \nsince  the  issuance  of  the  opinion  in  this  case.  The \n\n \n  9\nfirst  is  that  obtaining  medical  records  has  been  a \nstumbling  block  for  both  defense  counsel  and  the \nCommonwealth.  For  example,  the  Commonwealth  assisted \ncounsel in one stay request in an effort to obtain the \ndefendant’s  medical  records  to  confirm  for  the  trial \ncourt  the  claims  made  in  the  motion  to  stay. \nCommonwealth  v.  Watson\n,  Docket  No.  8084CR28954.  Even \nwith  the  assistance  of  the  Department  of  Correction, \nthe  parties  did  not  receive  the  medical  records  for \n5\nten  days.   The  bar  needs  guidance  as  to  how  to \nefficiently  address  that  problem  going  forward  as \nthese  records  are  vital  and  necessary  for  the \nresolution of the motions presented. \nThe  second  problem  not  yet  contemplated  by  this \nCourt  is  that  many  hearings  on  emergency  matters  in \nthe  trial  courts  are  being  held  in  contravention  to \nthe  First  and  Sixth  Amendment  right  to  a  public \ncourtroom  and  G.L.  c.  258B(b),  the  Victim’s  Bill  of \nRights.  Most  troubling  is  that  G.L.  c.  258B(b) \n                                                 \n5\n  In  order  to  comply  with  the  Health  Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), \ninstitutions are constrained from providing access to \nmedical  records  without  the  inmate’s  signature.  At \ntimes,  these  signatures  are  challenging  to  obtain \nbecause of the lockdown of carceral facilities due to \nCOVID-19.  \n\n \n  10\nexplicitly states that a victim not only has a right \nto  be  notified  about  a  hearing  but  a  right  to  be \npresent\n.  However,  that  is  not  routinely  happening  in \nCommonwealth \nSuffolk County.  Just last week alone, in \nv. Rodriguez\n, Suffolk Superior Court No. 1984CR00134, \nwe requested that the victim’s mother in a child rape \ncase be permitted to call into the conference line to \nhear argument in a bail reduction hearing. The judge \nrefused  to  let  the  victim’s  mother  call  in  and  said \nthat the victim and her mother could listen but only \nin the presence of the Commonwealth. To try and comply \nwith the court’s order, when the court called the ADA \nassigned,  she  made  a  three  way  call  to  the  victim \nwitness  advocate,  who  then  made  a  three  way  call  to \nthe  victim’s  mother,  who  initially  missed  the  call. \nThe VWA was then dropped from the call. The victim’s \nmother  shortly  thereafter  called  back  the  VWA. \nUnfortunately,  the  hearing  was  underway  the  ADA  was \nstill on the phone arguing the bail motion and could \n6\nnot answer the VWA’s calls or texts into her phone.  \n                                                 \n6\n   As  recently,  as  this  past  Friday,  an  Assistant \nDistrict  Attorney  was  precluded  from  using  a \nspeakerphone  to  allow  others  to  listen  to  a  bail \nreconsideration hearing in a first degree murder case, \n\n \n  11\nBecause  the  mother  was  not  physically  with  the \nCommonwealth, she and her daughter did not participate \nin  the  process.  The  defendant’s  bail  was  reduced  to \n$5,000  and  he  was  released.  The  victim  was  not \n“present”  during  the  process  in  any  way,  shape  or \nform.  \nCommonwealth  v. Anthony  Kelley\nSimilarly,  in    , \nBoston  Municipal  Court  Dorchester  Division  No.  2007-\nCR-01044,  an  arraignment  of  a  eighteen  year  old  for \nthe  murder  of  a  seventeen  year  old  girl,  though  the \nvictim’s family was able to listen to the hearing, the \ndefendant’s  family  was  having  difficulty  making \narrangements  to  hear  the  arraignment  of  their  loved \none. Of course their loved one has a right under the \nSixth Amendment for the courtroom to be public and for \nSee Commonwealth v. Cohen\nhis family to be present.    , \nWaller  v. \n456  Mass.  94,  105-106  (2010)  (citing \nGeorgia\n,  467  U.S.  39,  46  (1984)).  Through  previous \nacquaintance with the office, the defendant’s brother \nwas able to obtain the number of the assigned homicide \nprosecutor  and  she  patched  in  the  defendant’s  family \n                                                                                                                                     \n0884CR10354,  because  she  was  told  speakerphone  use \ndeteriorates the recording of the hearing. \n\n \n  12\nto the call so that they could hear the arraignment. \nConstitutional rights should never be guaranteed only \nthrough acts of kindness. \nPre  COVID-19,  these  proceedings  would  have \nhappened in open court. Anyone could have walked into \nany  of  these  courtrooms  and  listened  to  the \nproceedings.  Now,  due  to  the  trial  court’s  inability \nor  refusal  to  adapt  or  evolve  technologically,  our \nvictims and family members of victims, the public, and \ndefendants  are  being  excluded  from  the  process.  This \n7\namounts  to  a  significant  constitutional  violation.  \nGiven the above, any reconsideration in this case must \ninclude  meaningful  and  concrete  steps  for  these \nemergency  hearings  in  the  trial  court  to  be  open  to \nthe  public  including  most  critically  victims  and \n8\ndefendant’s families.  \n                                                 \n7\n  For example, organizations such as CourtWatch and \nmembers of the media have likewise been excluded, an \nexclusion that may come to the detriment of “the basic \nfairness of the criminal trial and the appearance of \nfairness  so  essential  to  public  confidence  in  the \nSee Cohen  Press-\nsystem.”  , 456 Mass. at 106 (quoting\nEnterprise  Co.  v.

The interplay between public health and public safety has never been \nmore apparent. Every county across the Commonwealth is grappling with balancing protecting \nour communities from crime with protecting citizens from contracting coronavirus. This includes \nprotecting people housed and working inside and outside of our police departments, court \nhouses, houses of correction, and prisons. \n1 \n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS1 \nThe COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in its nature and scope. Millions of people \nacross the country have been ordered by the government to shelter in place to prevent the spread \nof coronavirus. Coronavirus is spread by asymptomatic persons and spreads easily from person-\nto-person and via contaminated surfaces. There is no vaccine and all of the experts and \ngovernment officials in Massachusetts have opined or suggested that the only hope of reducing \nthe spread of the coronavirus, and in turn reducing the number of deaths caused by COVID-19, is \nfor all individuals to maintain a physical distance of at least six feet between each other and to \ncontinually wash their hands and disinfect surfaces. \nThe circumstances in Massachusetts jail and prison facilities make following these \nsuggestions to reduce the spread of the coronavirus especially problematic. There are \napproximately 16,500 individuals incarcerated in Massachusetts prisons and county jails and \nhouses of corrections. However, the disease prevention measures recommended by the experts \nfly directly in the face of long-existing rules within Massachusetts prisons and county jails and \nhouses of corrections or are simply impossible or impracticable in such an environment.2 For \nexample, the coronavirus easily can be spread by many different individuals within _a prison \nsetting, including visitors, correctional staff, attorneys, and newly incarcerated individuals. 3 \nBecause a person can transmit the infection for 2-14 days without knowing it, the infection will \n1 Respondent Berkshire DA will rely on the joint statement of facts should such an agreed-upon \njoint statement be achieved with the assistance of the Special Master. \n2 https://thejusticecollaborative.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/TJCV ulnerabi lityofPrisonsandJ ailstoCOVID 19Explainer. pdf \n3 See Exhibit A attached to the instant petition, Affidavit of Danielle C. Ompad, PHd, regarding \nSARS-CoV-2 infection (otherwise known as COVID-19) in correctional settings at paragraph \n9(b). \n2 \n\nspread quickly within corrections facilities and it has already started to happen.4 Several \nMassachusetts prisoners and staff members have already tested positive for the coronavirus. \nMoreover, it is undisputed that as time goes on, despite the best efforts of Sheriffs and the \nDepartment of Corrections, many more will be infected without significant guidance and action \nfrom the courts and cooperation amongst and between Petitioners and Respondents. \nFulfilling our obligation to the communities that we serve demands weighing the \nchallenges presented by COVID-19 with other existing and anticipated public safety challenges, \nincluding, in particular, domestic violence, sexual assault, and child abuse. Reports from China \nindicate that domestic violence rates have nearly doubled during the COVID-19 pandemic.5 This \nis particularly troubling to me, the Berkshire District Attorney, because Berkshire County \nalready has one of the highest rates of domestic and sexual violence in Massachusetts. \nAs of2019, the rate ofrestraining orders requested and received in Berkshire County was \nthirty-three percent (33%) more than any other county in the Commonwealth. Four Berkshire \ntowns, Stockbridge, Adams, Pittsfield, and North Adams, have the first, third, fifth, and sixth \nhighest rate of reported rapes. According to trial court statistics, there were six hundred and fifty-\nfour (654) 209A and 258E orders requested in Berkshire County in the first two quarters of \nFY20. That is one-hundred and six (106) more than the year-to-date numbers for FY19. If that \ntrend continues, it will be the most 209A and 258E orders requested since 2011. Moreover, \nBerkshire County had eight (8) domestic violence murd~rs between March 2018 and March \n2019. This is a shockingly high and concerning number given that Berkshire County only has a \npopulation of approximately 130,000 people. \n5 https://www .sixthtone.com/news/100525 3/d omestic-violence-cases-surge-during-covid-19-\nepidemic \n3 \n\nThe long term effects of this crisis will be borne by children, particularly children of \ncolor and children living in poverty. \"Child neglect and abuse tend to track with greater \ntraumatic events, economic instability, and stress. Sadly, they might be tracking already. \nReportedly, a single hospital in Fort Worth, Texas, has treated six children with severe physical-\nabuse-related injuries. Doc~ors believe the cases are related to parents' stress over the \npandemic.\"6 The Federal Bureau oflnvestigations has issued official warnings about the greater \nopportunity for predators to take advantage of vulnerable children who are spending more time \nalone and unsupervised due to the pandemic. 7 Children who are suffering abuse at home have \nless opportunity to confide in and seek help from a trusted adult while they are isolated from \nschool, community, and normal activities.8 Whereas many children of incarcerated parents will \nbenefit from the release of their parents and grandparents during a time of great trauma and \nstruggle, it is our obligation to ensure that we protect children from predators who are and must \nremain incarcerated irrespective of the Covid-19 pandemic. These are factors that can and must \nbe weighed by Petitioners and Respondents working on individualized determinations on \nmotions for release related to the current pandemic. \nThe Berkshire DA's Office supports immediate action to prevent and/or slow the spread \nof the coronavirus throughout the Commonwealth, including in Massachusetts prisons, jails, and \nhouses of correction, by releasing individuals who can be safely returned to our community. Our \noffice remains very concerned about the potential ripple effects and consequences that would \nresult from the sudden release of a large number of dangerous individuals at once, as well as the \n6 https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/what-coronavirus-will-do-kids/608608/ \n7 https://www.tbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/s chool-closings-due-to-covid-19-present \npotential-for-increased-risk-of-child-exploitation \n8 https ://www.cincinnati.com/story/ news/2020/03/27 I coronavirus-crisis-has-put-kids-risk-abuse \nhome-experts-warn/2909116001 I \n4 \n\nfailure to incarcerate high risk domestic abusers and individuals who commit sexual assaults. \nOur local law enforcement agencies are already taxed in responding to this crisis and must \ndevote particular energy to protecting vulnerable populations. Hundreds if not thousands of \nincarcerated non-violent offenders remain incarcerated in county houses of correction and across \nMassachusetts prisons, including individuals serving sentences for non-violent crimes such as \noperating under the influence. These individuals could either complete their sentences outside of \npenal institutions under GPS monitoring or return after the crisis to complete their sentences. It is \nimperative that the parties to this proceeding act quickly to release non-violent offenders so that \nthe penal system can more safely manage the remaining incarcerated population given the \ncurrent crisis. \nIssues of homelessness, access to food, and access to physical and mental health \nproviders must be addressed in the ongoing discussions in the criminal justice system. Re-entry \nservices that are normally available to released inmates, such as non-profit and governmental \nassistance securing housing, transitional support, food pantries, etc., are currently understaffed \nand overwhelmed because of the scope of the pandemic. We simply do not know what is \navailable now and what will be available in the weeks and months to come. In New Jersey, the \nparties reached a consent agreement whereby any individual who self-identifies or whom the \ncorrectional facility identifies as unable to obtain safe housing or photo identification upon \nrelease shall not be released without further instructions from the court or Special Master. In \nsuch cases, the parties are required to obtain assistance from various governmental and social \nservices organizations to determine a plan for housing, identification, and other necessary \nservices for the inmate. \n5 \n\nSince the undersigned District Attorney was sworn in on January 2, 2019, the Berkshire \nDA's Office has implemented prosecution policies and procedures designed to eliminate the use \nof incarceration as a punishment for individuals convicted of non-violent crimes and who are not \na threat to public safety or to victims. We have virtually eliminated the use of cash bail and have \nsought medical solutions, rather than incarceration, for defendants suffering from addiction and \nmental health issues. Since the onset of the current public health emergency, the Berkshire DA's \nOffice has been proactive in identifying incarcerated individuals for potential release from \nprisons, jails, and houses of correction in light of the challenges presented by COVID-19. For \nexample, the Berkshire DA's Office contacted members of the local criminal defense bar and \ninformed them that it would potentially support motions to release such individuals, especially \nthose in high risk categories and persons held on bail by order of the court. We have been \nreaching out to victims in order to obtain their input on motions we have received, and have been \nnotifying them of decisions on such motions, as we believe it is our obligation to do so pursuant \nto the Victims Bill of Rights. See G.L. c. 258B, § 3(b). Likewise, we seek input from local law \nenforcement on motion for release in order to make informed decisions and meeting our \nobligations to protect public safety and victims. \nMoreover, the Berkshire DA's Office sent a written request for a current census of the \nBerkshire County House of Correction from the Berkshire County Sheriff so that the Berkshire \nDA's Office could review the currently incarcerated population and begin the process of \nidentifying individuals that the Berkshire DA's Office might support being released. See \nRespondent's Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto. To date, the Berkshire County Sheriff has failed to \nprovide the requested information. The failure and refusal of the Berkshire County Sheriff to \nprovide this information prevents the Berkshire DA's Office from effectively doing its part in \n6 \n\npreventing the spread of the coronavirus. This is just one example of why emergency relief and \nguidance is needed from this Court in light of COVID-19. \nLike other District Attorney Offices across the Commonwealth, the Berkshire DA's \nOffice has been reviewing and will continue to review defense motions for the release of \nincarcerated individuals based upon valid COVID-19 concerns, and, since the onset of the crisis, \nhas consented to the release of individuals being held both pretrial and under sentence. The \nBerkshire DA's Office reviews such motions on a case-by-case basis and makes decisions based \nupon a careful and thoughtful evaluation and consideration of a number of important factors \nunique to each person, case, and victim, including but not limited to, public safety, victim safety, \n· the public health crisis, and the risks associated to the incarcerated population, correctional \nofficers and the community. \nWith cooperation from other criminal justice actors, Berkshire DA's Office is committed \nto making individualized determinations on every motion filed in a timely fashion. At present, \nBerkshire County courts have the capacity to hear and to rule on motions for release filed by \nindividuals within each court's jurisdiction. The Berkshire DA's Office does not see the \nnecessity for this Court to issue blanket orders in light of local conditions including pre-existing \nprosecution policies around pretrial detention. \n7 \n\nCONCLUSION \nThis legal proceeding is a welcome opportunity for the Court to provide urgent guidance \nand legal mechanisms to the named parties that allow for protecting the due process and eighth \namendment rights of defendants, promote public safety and public health, while effectively and \nhumanely managing this crisis as it relates to the incarcerated population in the Commonwealth \nin light of the local needs.

Chief Justice of the Trial Court, et al., \nNo. SJC-12926.     \n \nI and my colleagues at Ropes & Gray have worked hard with several of the parties in an effort to \nfocus and resolve the issues raised by the Petitioners.  While certain of the parties declined to \nparticipate in the Special Master’s efforts, several of the parties engaged in a robust sharing of ideas \non how to best address the public health issues raised by the Petitioners and resolve the matter.

While the pandemic is unprecedented, the Court is not \n• LOWELL \n  without potentially helpful guidance from without its borders.  For example, \nDISTRICT COURT \non March 22, 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court issued a Consent Order \nOFFICES \n• AYER  that provided for, among other things, commutation and suspension of certain \n• CAMBRIDGE  county jail sentences (while preserving an opportunity for prosecutors to \n• CONCORD  object in individual cases).1  Like the Special Master’s Report and \n• FRAMINGHAM \n• LOWELL  Recommendation here, the New Jersey Consent Order resulted from \n• MALDEN  mediation involving multiple stakeholders in the criminal justice system.2 It  \n• MARLBOROUGH                                                   \n• NEWTON \n1 The full order is available at \n• SOMERVILLE \n• WALTHAM  https://www.njcourts.gov/notices/2020/n200323a.pdf?c=cKC (last accessed \n• WOBURN  March 31, 2020).  It was amended by a supplemental order available at \n \nhttps://www.njcourts.gov/notices/2020/n200323b.pdf?c=t9V (last accessed \nMarch 31, 2020). \n2 The legal merits of the original petition for relief filed in New Jersey were \n \nnot litigated because the parties instead came to an agreement akin to the one \nat issue here, but it appears that the request for relief was based on Article VI \nof the New Jersey Constitution, which grants to the New Jersey Supreme  \n \n\nwas motivated, in part, by “the profound risk posed to people in correctional facilities arising \nfrom the spread of COVID-19.”  \n \n  Responses in other states are developing rapidly, sometimes featuring action on the \npart of the judiciary as well as executive branch initiatives.  In California, Chief Justice Tani \nG. Cantil-Sakauye, citing “constitutional and due process rights of court users,” “strongly \nencourage[d]” county superior court presiding judges and court executive officers to work \nwith local justice system partners to identify inmates in county jail or juvenile hall custody \nwho have fewer than 60 days remaining on their sentences for the purpose of modifying their \nsentences to permit early release.3  Similarly, the California Department of Corrections and \nRehabilitation is expediting the transition to parole for eligible inmates who have 60 days or \nless to serve on their sentences (and are not serving sentences for certain excluded crimes), \nestimating “that up to 3,500 incarcerated persons would be eligible for an expedited \ntransition to parole.”4  At the same time, California’s governor is reportedly opposing \nemergency court orders to release prisoners in litigation filed on behalf of inmates and still \npending before a 3-judge panel in federal court.5 This emergency motion, brought pursuant to \nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3626, and alleging Eighth Amendment \nviolations, will be heard on April 2, 2020.6 \n \nIn Pennsylvania, “622 inmates ha[ve] been approved by the courts for release and \nphysically discharged by the jail[.]”7  Likewise, in Iowa, the courts are reviewing motions to \nreduce sentence on a case-by-case basis.8  Other states, such as North Dakota and Oklahoma, \nhave seen the executive branch take action to release inmates serving their sentences.  In \nNorth Dakota, “[t]he state parole board approved during a special meeting Friday, March 20, \n                                                 \nCourt superintendence of the administration of the lower courts. See NJ Const. Art. 6, § 2. \nThe Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court, who issued the above-referenced \nConsent Order, is responsible for the administration of all courts in the state pursuant to the \nState Constitution.

Art. 6, § 7. \n3 The Chief Justice’s advisory is available at https://newsroom.courts.ca.gov/news/california-\nchief-justice-issues-second-advisory-on-emergency-relief-measures (last accessed March 31, \n2020).  \n4 See https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/news/2020/03/31/cdcr-announces-plan-to-further-protect-\nstaff-and-inmates-from-the-spread-of-covid-19-in-state-prisons/ (last accessed March 31, \n2020). \n5 THE SACRAMENTO BEE, California granting early release to 3,500 inmates, says no order \nneeded to force more over virus, available at \nhttps://www.sacbee.com/news/local/crime/article241646781.html.  \n6 See https://prisonlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dkt-6522-3JC-Pls-Emergency-Mtn-\nto-Modify-Pop-Reduction-Order-MPA-ISO-03-25-20-0489-3.pdf (last accessed April 1, \n2020) \n7 PITTSBURGH’S ACTION NEWS 4, Over 600 inmates released from Allegheny County Jail due \nto coronavirus concerns, available at https://www.wtae.com/article/inmates-released-from-\nallegheny-county-jail-due-to-coronavirus-concerns/31953103. \n8 DES MOINES REGISTER, “Prisons and jails are literally petri dishes”: Inmates released, \narrests relaxed across Iowa amid fears of coronavirus, available at \nhttps://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2020/03/23/coronavirus-\niowa-jail-prison-inmates-released-amid-fears-covid-19-virus-polk-county-des-\nmoines/2891117001/. \n  2 \n\nthe release of 56 prisoners as part of a population mitigation plan[.]”9 In Oklahoma, “200 \nnonviolent, low-level offenders have been released from the Oklahoma County jail.”10 As \nthese other states’ experiences illustrate, the practices of other jurisdictions are an inherently \nimperfect guide given the distinct rules and procedures applicable11 and the freedom of \ncriminal justice stakeholders in those jurisdictions (including elected officials) to adopt \ndivergent policy positions. \n \nSeparation of Powers & Stays of Execution of Sentences \n \nThe established criminal justice rules and procedures already in use in the \nCommonwealth offer further guidance and confirm that the judiciary’s legitimate interests \nunder art. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights in the fate of sentenced defendants \ndo not end at the pronouncement of sentence.  The trial and appellate courts of the \nCommonwealth have an obvious and ongoing interest in the justness of all sentences \nimposed following criminal conviction.  This much is clear from the Rules of Criminal \nProcedure concerning, inter alia, revision and revocation of sentence (Rule 29), release from \nunlawful restraint (Rule 30(a)), and stays of execution of sentence (Rule 31).  See also Mass. \nR. App. P. 6(b).  Indeed, while Mass. R. Crim. P. 29 ordinarily imposes temporal limits on a \nmotion to revise and revoke, there is no such limitation for a Rule 30(a) motion, which can \nbe brought “at any time.”  With respect to stays of execution, the Reporter’s Notes (2009) to \nRule 31 explain that “[t]he trial judge may entertain a motion for a stay either before or after \nthe entry of an appeal” and, citing Commonwealth v. McLaughlin, 431 Mass. 506, 518 \n(2000), intimate that, while the rule “does not address stays of execution of a sentence when \nan appeal is not pending,” a judge may have the inherent power to stay a sentence for other \nreasons. This Court later confirmed this inherent power to stay sentences. See \nCommonwealth v. Charles, 466 Mass. 63, 72 (2013), quoting McLaughlin, 431 Mass. at 520, \nquoting Mariano v. Judge of Dist. Court of Cent. Berkshire, 243 Mass. 90, 92 (1922) (“[A] \njudge has the inherent power to stay sentences for ‘exceptional reasons permitted by law’”). \n \nThe judiciary’s routine, ongoing interest in ensuring that sentences being served by \nconvicted defendants are consistent with the federal and state constitutions, the statutory and \ncommon law of the Commonwealth, and principles of justice more broadly does not violate \nthe separation of powers.  See Commonwealth v. Rodriguez, 461 Mass. 256, 262-266 (2012) \n(judge does not “‘exercise the ... executive powers’ and thereby violate art. 30 of the \nMassachusetts Declaration of Rights by revising or revoking a sentence under rule 29” \nwhere, after agreed recommendation in plea agreement, “judge timely determines, based on \n                                                 \n9 THE DICKINSON PRESS, North Dakota paroles 56 prisoners early amid pandemic, including \n3 convicted of sexual assault, available at https://www.thedickinsonpress.com/news/crime-\nand-courts/5009882-North-Dakota-paroles-56-prisoners-early-amid-pandemic-including-3-\nconvicted-of-sexual-assault. \n10 THE OKLAHOMAN, Coronavirus in Oklahoma: Over 200 nonviolent offenders released \nfrom Oklahoma County jail to limit COVID-19 spread, available at \nhttps://oklahoman.com/article/5658504/coronavirus-in-oklahoma-over-200-non-violent-\noffenders-released-from-oklahoma-county-jail-to-limit-covid-19-spread?. Of note, “[n]o \ninmates with violent charges, including domestic violence, robbery or sex crimes, or charges \nrelated to possession of a firearm, were considered” for release. \n11 For example, according to the California Chief Justice’s advisory (see note 3, supra), \njudicial authority in California is uniquely decentralized, with each of its 58 superior courts \nempowered to establish and maintain its own court operations. \n  3 \n\nnew information or further deliberation, that the lesser sentence better serves the interest of \njustice” as “judge simply exercised a quintessential judicial power—the power to sentence—\nand ultimately concluded that the agreed recommendation was more severe than justice \npermitted”).12 \n \nThis Court has previously recognized the potentially overlapping interests of the \njudiciary, legislature, and executive branch in a case specifically involving sentencing.  See \nCommonwealth v. Jackson, 369 Mass. 904, 921 (1976), quoting LaChapelle v. United Shoe \nMach. Corp., 318 Mass. 166, 170 (1945) (“Although the separation of powers doctrine is \nfundamental to our form of government, and it must be maintained to its full extent, ‘the \nexact line between judicial and executive or legislative powers has never been delineated \nwith absolute precision’”).  Sentencing, in particular, is an area where all three branches have \nproprietary interests.  See Commonwealth v. Dascalakis, 246 Mass. 12, 20 (1923) \n(“Doubtless the court has power to enforce the execution of sentence by appropriate process, \nbut execution of sentence is in its essence an executive or ministerial and not a judicial \nfunction”).13  While the Jackson Court concluded that “[t]he ability to defer the imposition of \nsentence, although a valuable feature in our legal system, is not necessary to the very \nexistence of a court, and, as such, is not an inherent power beyond statutory limitation” by \nthe legislature, 369 Mass. at 922, it assumed that these powers were of common law origin \nand its analysis based on that assumption, 369 Mass. at 920-924, indicates that overlapping \nsentencing prerogatives would not present constitutional concerns unless the judiciary were \nto seek to exercise common law sentencing powers in the face of a specific statute modifying \nor abrogating those powers.14  No such concern is presented by case-by-case adjudication of \nthe justness of individual sentences in the midst of a pandemic.   \n                                                 \n12 Ordinarily, of course, “a judge under rule 29 may ‘reconsider the sentence he has imposed \nand determine, in light of the facts as they existed at the time of sentencing, whether the \nsentence was just.’”  Rodriguez, 461 Mass. at 260, quoting Commonwealth v. McCulloch, \n450 Mass. 483, 487 (2008) (emphasis added).  \n13 More recently, this Court has recognized (i) that judges have “the authority to decide the \nlength of a defendant's sentence, provided that it is within the limits set forth by the statute \nunder which the defendant has been convicted” and that “in the exercise of her sentencing \ndiscretion, the judge may consider a variety of factors including the defendant’s behavior, \nfamily life, employment history, and civic contributions, as well as societal goals of \npunishment, deterrence, protection of the public, and rehabilitation” but also that (ii) \n“[g]enerally, however, once a judge has sentenced a defendant, authority over the defendant \npasses from the judicial branch to the executive branch of government in that the defendant \nbecomes subject to the sheriff’s control.”  Commonwealth v. Donohue, 452 Mass. 256, 264 \n(2008) (quotations and citations omitted).  In deciding the case on statutory grounds, \nhowever, the Donahue court avoided addressing the constitutional limits of a sheriff’s \n“authority under art. 30 to set the conditions of an inmate’s incarceration” when those \nconditions conflict with a sentencing judge’s interpretation of her sentence. \n14 In some cases, the Legislature has endorsed the judicial power to suspend even parts of \nsentences.  See G.L. c. 279, § 1 (“When a person convicted before a court is sentenced to \nimprisonment, the court may direct that the execution of the sentence, or any part thereof, be \nsuspended and that he be placed on probation for such time and on such terms and conditions \nas it shall fix”).  But even where the Legislature has restricted judicial discretion to suspend \nsentences across a range of cases, e.g., G.L. c. 127, § 133, it has not, and constitutionally \ncould not, seek to limit the courts’ obligation to ensure that all sentences comport with due \nprocess. \n  4 \n\nThe legal steps necessary to ensure the continuing justness of carceral sentences in \nthe face of COVID-19 may not fit neatly into any pre-existing procedural mechanism or \nsubstantive doctrine.  For example, the commendable efforts of the Department of Correction \nand Sheriffs’ Offices across the Commonwealth to protect inmates preclude any suggestion \nof “deliberate indifference,” and sentencing judges cannot have realistically been expected to \nrevise and revoke sentences within Rule 29’s sixty days based on a previously unfathomable \npublic health crisis.  But the courts can nonetheless provide the same individualized \nassessment of the justness of ongoing incarceration that they always have (under various \nmechanisms from Rule 29 to Rule 31 to G.L. c. 211, § 3) without violating art. 30.15  Such \nassessments may reflect, inter alia, whether state prisons and houses of correction in which a \ndeadly virus could spread with ease still comport with the legislative conceptions of such \ncorrectional institutions underlying the penalties established for various crimes (including, \nspecifically, their rehabilitative objectives).  See G.L. c. 125, § 1 (defining “correctional \nfacility” as “any building, enclosure, space or structure used for the custody, control and \nrehabilitation of committed offenders and of such other persons as may be placed in custody \ntherein in accordance with law”).  It could also involve consideration of whether certain \ninmates (e.g., those scheduled for release in the very near future) are already entitled to the \nprotection of state action designed to minimize the spread of the virus among the general, \nnon-incarcerated public that they will soon be joining.  At the very least, there can be no \ndoubt that courts have the authority to stay the sentences of any defendants while the merits \nof any such claims are evaluated in the “exceptional circumstances” presented by COVID-\n19.  See Charles, 466 Mass. at 72, 75. \n \nPlease bring this letter to the Court’s attention.  If you have any questions, please \ncontact our offices.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. \n \n                                                 \n15 Along these lines, the Commonwealth proposes the following amendment to Rule 29, \nwhich would eliminate any separation-of-powers concerns and alleviate objections to both \nthe timeliness and revision mechanism of any Rule 29 motion: \n \nRule 29(f) - COVID-19 Emergency Release \nThe following provision shall be in effect for the duration of the COVID-19 State of \nEmergency declared by Governor Charlie Baker on March 10, 2020, and a judge's \nauthority to entertain motions shall terminate when the State of Emergency is \nlifted. A trial judge, upon the written motion of the prosecutor or a qualifying \ndefendant pursuant to the terms [outlined in Section III of the Special Master's \nSettlement Agreement], and after concluding by a preponderance of the evidence \nthat any risks to public safety posed by the defendant’s release can be effectively \nmanaged through the imposition of appropriate conditions, may temporarily stay \nthe sentence of said defendant and order his or her release subject to appropriate \nconditions of release. A defendant released pursuant to this provision shall be \nordered to return to custody within fourteen (14) calendar days after the COVID-19 \nState of Emergency is lifted in the Commonwealth unless otherwise ordered. \n \n  5 \n\n \nSincerely, \n \n/s/ MARIAN T.

      "text": " \nBOSTON BAR ASSOCIATION \n16 BEACON STREET \nBOSTON, MA 02108 \n617-462-0615 \nwww.bostonbar.org \n \nMarch 30, 2020 \n \nMaura S. Doyle, Clerk \nSupreme Judicial Court for the County of Suffolk \nJohn Adams Courthouse, First Floor \nOne Pemberton Square, Suite 1300 \nBoston, MA 02108 \n \nRe:  Committee for Public Counsel Services and Massachusetts Association of \nCriminal Defense Lawyers v. Chief Justice of the Trial Court (SJC-12926) \namicus curiae letter in support of Petitioners’ Request for Relief \nDear Clerk Doyle: \nThe Boston Bar Association (BBA) respectfully submits this amicus curiae letter. The letter \nfocuses on two issues that the BBA believes are particularly critical for the Court to address in the \ncurrent emergency: (1) the need to create a system wide-mechanism to expedite consideration of \nrelease of individuals held pre-trial and in connection with certain probation violations; and (2) the \nneed to permit individualized judicial determination of the possible release of individuals serving \nsentences.  \nThe BBA recognizes and applauds the efforts of the law enforcement officials and District \nAttorneys who have worked cooperatively with defense lawyers to obtain the release of some \nincarcerated individuals. But this is one of the very rare instances where litigation and judicial \ndeliberation by trial judges under the ordinary rules will literally cost lives. Prompt system-wide \naction is necessary to save lives and protect both the incarcerated community and the civilian \ncommunity.1 \nThe BBA urges the Court to take three specific actions:2 \n                                                             \n1 This Court recognized this in its March 17, 2020 Order, Order Limiting in-Person Appearances in State \nCourthouses to Emergency Matters That Cannot be Resolved Through a Videoconference or Telephonic \nHearing, at 8, providing “in criminal cases, where appropriate, a defendant may ask the court for \nreconsideration of bail or conditions of release.”  \n2 We do not intend to suggest that these are the only two forms of relief the Court should grant; we focus \non these two because, in the view of the BBA, they are the most critical. \n \nB5117464.1 \n\n \nFirst, we urge the Court to use its powers of superintendence under G. L. c. 211, §3 to create a \nsystem-wide mechanism to quickly reduce the number of persons held pending trial.  In particular, \nthe BBA requests that the Court direct the Chief Justices of the Trial Court to designate a judicial \nofficer in each judicial district to review existing bail conditions in pending cases in that district.  \nSecond, we ask the Court to instruct that judicial officer to apply a strong presumption of release \nfor individuals held on cash bail and for probation detainees held pending final surrender for \nallegations of violations of their conditions of probation other than new offenses involving abuse \nas defined under G. L. c. 209A.  \nThird, we urge the Court to issue an order suspending Mass. R. Crim. P. 29’s requirement that \ndefendants file motions to revise and revoke sentences within sixty days of the imposition of \nsentence,  and  explicitly  permit  judges  addressing those  motions  to  consider  the  COVID-19 \npandemic in deciding whether to revise or revoke sentences. \nAdopting these three suggestions will reduce the density of House of Corrections and Department \nof Corrections populations, thereby facilitating the practice of proper safety precautions. It will \nalso permit judges, in the interest of justice, to release those incarcerated persons whose age and \nother health factors present the most complex medical challenges to correctional officials. This \nwill ultimately improve correctional officials’ ability to take steps to safeguard themselves and \nthose individuals who remain in custody. It will also help reduce the overall spread of the virus, \nwhich is a paramount concern to all Massachusetts residents.  \nA. Pre-Trial Detainees \nTo address the risks facing pre-trial detainees, the BBA respectfully suggests that the Court direct \nthe Chief Justices of the Trial Court to designate a judicial officer in each judicial district to work \nwith a group consisting of a designee of the local District Attorney, the Committee for Public \nCounsel Services, and the local bar advocate organization. This group would be charged with \nobtaining from the Sheriff in that county a list of all persons held in pretrial confinement, and with \nreviewing the conditions of pretrial confinement with a strong presumption for immediate release \nof:  \n•  All pretrial detainees who are held on cash bail and not on the basis of dangerousness under \nG. L. c. 276, § 58A3; and \n                                                             \n3 The great majority of pretrial detainees are not held based on a finding of dangerousness. Most are instead \nheld on relatively low cash bails. Data from the trial court published in a recent report of a Special \nCommission that examined the Massachusetts bail system following this Court’s decision in Brangan v. \nCommonwealth, 477 Mass. 691 (2017) revealed that judges held only 3.7% of those charged without bail. \nSee Report of the Special Commission to Evaluate Policies and Procedures Related to the Current Bail \nSystem, Ex. C at 2 (December 31, 2019), available at https://malegislature.gov/Reports. Statistics gathered \nby the Trial Court in the seventeen months after the Court’s decision in Brangan reveal that judges ordered \ncash bail in four times as many cases as they ordered defendants held without bail. But nearly half of those \n2 \n \nB5117464.1 \n\n \n•  All probation detainees held pending final surrender based on allegations of violations of \ntheir conditions of probation other than for new offenses involving abuse as defined under \nG. L. c. 209A. \nThe BBA further suggests that this review should: \n•  Be triggered automatically upon order of this Court and not require individualized filings \nby defendants or probationers; \n•  Provide a short period in which District Attorneys may file an opposition to release in \nspecific cases in which they can demonstrate that the need for detention significantly \noutweighs the health-related risks from exposure to COVID-19; and \n•  Provide for decisions of the judicial officer on as expedited a basis as is possible. \nThe BBA respectfully suggests that judges should be encouraged to consider appropriate forms of \nremote check-in with the probation department or court, or to fashion any other order addressing \nthe need to ensure a defendant’s continued appearance at court. \nThe BBA respectfully suggests that this same mechanism be used for all other pretrial detainees \nand probation detainees who are not in the two categories stated above, without the strong \npresumption for immediate release. This will ensure that all individuals receive some level of \nimmediate review. \nB.  Persons Serving Sentences in the House of Correction or the Department of Correction:  \nTo address the equally serious risks for individuals serving sentences, the BBA respectfully \nsuggests that the Court suspend the sixty-day filing requirement under Mass. R. Crim. P. Rule 29 \nand permit all individuals serving a House of Correction sentence or a parole-eligible sentence4 in \nthe Department of Correction to immediately file a motion to revise or revoke their sentence.5 \nThe BBA respectfully suggests that this Court order that judges hearing motions pursuant to Rule \n29(a)(2) specifically take into account the risk from COVID-19 exposure for the individual movant \nand articulate this consideration on the record when ruling on the motion.6 \n                                                             \ndefendants for whom cash bail was set still could not make bail – and more than 60% of those defendants \n(nearly 2,000) were held on bail of less than $1,000. Id. \n4 This includes individuals eligible for medical parole under G. L. c. 127, § 119A.  \n \n6While Rule 29 does permit judges to consider some new mitigating factors, such as good behavior on part \nof a defendant while incarcerated, Commonwealth v. White, 436 Mass. 340, 345 (2002), this Court should \nclearly dispel any concern by trial judges that they may only “reconsider the sentence [ ] imposed . . . in \nlight of the facts as they existed at the time of sentencing.” Commonwealth v. Rodriguez, 461 Mass. 256, \n260 (2012). That limitation was designed to ensure that sentencing judges were not invested with the power \nand responsibility of overseeing a sentenced individual’s progress through the correction system. It never \ncontemplated an overwhelming health crisis like the one we face today. Our request that the Court suspend \n3 \n \nB5117464.1 \n\n \nTo avoid unnecessary delays in providing the relief necessary under the circumstances, the BBA \nrespectfully suggests that this Court make findings of fact concerning COVID-19 exposure risk, \nand that it encourage judges to take judicial notice of medical and scientific filings, submitted to \nthis Court or other courts, on this question.7 These findings of fact concerning medical and \nscientific  matters  would  not  preclude  judges  considering  facility-specific  circumstances,  the \ncircumstances of individual detainees or inmates, or both. Furthermore, the BBA requests this \nCourt urge judges to be flexible in exercising their discretion to receive information regarding an \nincarcerated person’s specific medical history from counsel’s own proffer or other reliable sources, \nwhere counsel’s ability to provide detailed medical records may likely be curtailed in light of the \npandemic.8 \nC.  Conclusion.  \nThe BBA has focused the Court’s attention on two issues it considers particularly important, \nbecause it believes these issues and the framework it suggests are critical needs, that can be readily \naddressed, and that will reduce severe risks to the health of those in custody and those charged \nwith their care. \nThe BBA thanks this Court for its work and leadership in guiding the lower courts through the \nearly days of the pandemic. There  is  more work to be done. The BBA  likewise strives to \ncontinually support the legal community, practitioners, and all people of Massachusetts through \nthis difficult ordeal. \nDECLARATION PURSUANT TO MASS. R. APP.
