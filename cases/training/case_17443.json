    "summary": "<p>On March 24, 2020, thirteen immigrants detained in California at the Mesa Verde Detention Center and at the Yuba County Jail sued ICE, alleged violations of their Fifth Amendment rights to substantive due process by subjecting them to a heightened risk of contracting COVID-19. The plaintiffs sought attorneys&rsquo; fees, declaratory judgment that the detention conditions posed an unreasonable risk of contracting illness, and a writ of habeas corpus for their immediate release or, in the alternative, injunctive relief ordering the plaintiff&rsquo;s immediate release. The plaintiffs were represented by the ACLU, Lawyers&rsquo; Committee for Civil Rights, and private counsel. The case was assigned to Judge Maxine Chesney.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs argued that the defendants cannot justify subjecting the plaintiffs to this increased risk of illness with any legitimate government objective, and therefore their detention violates their constitutional right to safety in government custody. Each of the plaintiffs&rsquo; age or underlying health conditions make them particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. The plaintiffs alleged that their detainment with the general population without CDC-recommended &ldquo;social distancing&rdquo; practices increases their risk of contracting COVID-19. The plaintiffs further alleged that the defendants exacerbated the risk by conducting pre-dawn raids and adding new detainees to the facilities without quarantine. Other jails around the country, including multiple within California, have released prisoners in the interest of protecting individual and public health.</p>\r\n<p>Concurrently, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order. They claimed that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim since the increased risk of COVID-19 contraction amounts to a punishment in violation of the Fifth Amendment. They contended that the court&rsquo;s authority to order the plaintiffs&rsquo; release is the sole effective remedy for this constitutional violation since it is impossible to implement preventative measures like social distancing and frequent disinfection in the detention centers. They argued that the alleged violation of the plaintiffs&rsquo; constitutional rights constitutes irreparable harm and also tips the balance of equities in their favor. The plaintiffs also argued that their release would support the broader public interest by reducing the health and economic burden on the surrounding community.</p>\r\n<p>Of the thirteen plaintiffs originally included in the suit, two were released and one was voluntarily dismissed.</p>\r\n<p>On April 8, 2020, Judge Chesney ruled on eight of the remaining ten petitioner's motion for temporary restraining order. 2020 WL 1701724. Adjudication of two plaintiffs was deferred in order for the parties to file additional relevant information. For the other eighth plaintiffs, Judge Chesney rejected the defendant's claim that the plaintiffs lacked Article III standing. Although the defendants argued that no plaintiffs were alleged to have contracted COVID-19, Judge Chesney found that the confined nature of the jail made the risk of contraction sufficient to support standing. Turning to the factors considered in a TRO motion, Judge Chesney found four plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their claim because the record lacked evidence of a medical condition placing them at a higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Four other plaintiffs, however, were found to have met this standard. These plaintiffs had underlying medical conditions, such as asthma or diabetes, that put them at higher risk of severe illness given the inability to effectively social distance in the detention facility. Judge Chesney found that these detainment conditions were excessive to their purpose, and therefore the four plaintiffs with sufficient evidence supporting their medical conditions were found likely to succeed on the merits of their claims. For many of the same reasons, Judge Chesney found that these four plaintiffs likely to suffer irreparable harm if the TRO were not granted. The balance of hardships also tipped in the four plaintiffs' favor, and the \"highly unusual circumstances\" presented by the global pandemic supported a finding that the public interest was served by the TRO. Therefore, Judge Chesney granted the TRO for the four plaintiffs who presented sufficient evidence of underlying medical conditions elevating their risk of severe illness if they contracted COVID-19, and denied the TRO for the other four. Judge Chesney ordered the plaintiffs to be transported to an alternative residence and to remain their except to receive medical care, to appear at immigration court proceedings, or to obey an order issued by the Department of Homeland Security. In addition to these conditions, Judge Chesney added two more on April 13 as requested by the defendants. In addition to the conditions stated above, the released petitioners would also be subject to ICE's usual orders of release, and the petitioners would be subject to GPS monitoring if elected by ICE.</p>\r\n<p>For three of the petitioners denied relief in the April 8 order, plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration. The plaintiffs provided a declaration from a physician for each petitioner demonstrating that each had at least one health condition that placed them at an increased risk of contracting a severe illness if infected by COVID-19. On April 20, though, Judge Chesney denied the motion. She found that the evidence did not show that the medical records did not exist prior to the original motion, nor did it show that plaintiffs could not have obtained the evidence before filing their original motion. Therefore, Judge Chesney denied the motion for reconsideration without prejudice as to the filing of a motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>On April 14, Judge Chesney granted the motion for TRO for the two deferred petitioners as well. 2020 WL 1866122. Those two plaintiffs presented evidence documenting their hypertension, a condition that the CDC had recognized as putting individuals at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Judge Chesney imposed the same conditions noted above on the release of these two petitioners as the other four.</p>\r\n<p>After granting the aforementioned TRO relief, Judge Chesney directed the respondents to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be ordered for the six petitioners. The respondents asserted that the Court lacked jurisdiction to grant such relief, and argued that the increased provision of soap and cleaning supplies weighed against granting injunctive relief. The Court found that it had jurisdiction since the defendant (Acting Field Director for the San Francisco Field Office of ICE) was within the Court's territorial jurisdiction. The Court also determined that the additional sanitation measures may alleviate some of the concerns, but the plaintiffs' medical conditions still place them at an increased risk of contracting a severe illness if they were to be detained. Therefore, on March 7, the Court granted the preliminary injunctive relief. 2020 WL 2218965. The Court did not specify a date on which the injunction would expire.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants appealed the TRO relief to the Ninth Circuit on July 5, 2020. As of October 26, the case remains ongoing. The Ninth Circuit Court granted a motion by the appellants to voluntarily dismiss the appeal on November 18, 2020.</p>",

      "text": "Case 3:20-cv-02064-MMC   Document 71   Filed 05/07/20   Page 1 of 6\n \n1   \n2   \n3   \n4  IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \n5  FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \n6   \nSOFIA BAHENA ORTUÑO, et al.,  Case No.  20-cv-02064-MMC    \n7 \n \nPetitioners-Plaintiffs \n8  ORDER GRANTING PRELIMIINARY \nINJUNCTION AS TO PETITIONERS \nv. \n9  MEDINA CALDERON, LAVRUS, \n  JOSEPH, SOLORIO LOPEZ, TORRES \n10  DAVID JENNINGS, et al.,  MURILLO, AND QUINTEROS  \nRespondents-Defendants.   \n11 \n   \n  12   \n a\ntruin\noro 13  On March 24, 2020, petitioners filed a \"Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241.\"  Subsequently, by order filed April 8, 2020 (\"April 8 \niD tc 15  Order\"), the Court granted petitioners' motion for a temporary restraining order as to \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Salomon Medina Calderon (\"Medina Calderon\"), Gennady V. Lavrus (\"Lavrus\"), Charles \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Joseph (\"Joseph\"), and J. Elias Solorio Lopez (\"Solorio Lopez\"), and directed \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  respondents to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue mandating the \nN\n19  continued release of those four petitioners.  Thereafter, by order filed April 14, 2020 \n20  (\"April 14 Order\"), the Court granted petitioners' motion for a temporary restraining order \n21  as to two additional petitioners, specifically, Olvin Said Torres Murillo (\"Torres Murillo\") \n22  and Mauricio Ernesto Quinteros Lopez (\"Quinteros\"), and directed respondents to show \n23  cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue as to those two petitioners as well. \n24  Now before the Court are respondents' responses to the above-referenced orders \n25  to show cause and petitioners' replies thereto.1  Having read and considered the parties' \n26 \n \n27 \n1Unless otherwise specified, all references below to \"petitioners\" are to the six \nindividuals identified above. \n28 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-02064-MMC   Document 71   Filed 05/07/20   Page 2 of 6\n \n1  respective written submissions, the Court rules as follows. \n2  In their responses, respondents reiterate two threshold arguments set forth in their \n3  opposition to the motion for a temporary restraining, specifically, that (1) petitioners lack \n4  standing, and (2) petitioners may not proceed under § 2241.  The Court has considered \n5  these arguments anew and, for the reasons set forth in the Court's April 8 Order, finds \n6  petitioners have standing to assert the claims alleged in their petition and that they may \n7  proceed under § 2241. \n8  Next, relying on 28 U.S.C. § 2241, respondents argue, for the first time, the Court \n9  lacks jurisdiction to consider petitioners' claims.  Section § 2241 provides that \"[w]rits of \n10  habeas corpus may be granted by the Supreme Court, any justice thereof, the district \n11  courts and any circuit judge within their respective jurisdictions.\"  See 28 U.S.C. \n  12  § 2241(a).  Respondents contend the phrase \"within their respective jurisdictions\" is a \n a\ntruin\noro 13  reference to subject-matter jurisdiction.  As interpreted by the Supreme Court, however, \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  the phrase is used \"not in the sense of subject-matter jurisdiction,\" see Rumsfeld v. \niD tc 15  Padilla, 542 U.S. 426, 434 n.7 (2004), but, rather, \"require[s] nothing more than that the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  court issuing the writ have jurisdiction over the custodian,\" see id. at 442 (internal \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  quotation and citation omitted).  In other words, \"the question of the proper location for a \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  habeas petition is best understood as a question of personal jurisdiction or venue.\"  See \nN\n19  id. at 451 (Kennedy, J., concurring)).  The Court thus turns to the question of whether \n20  petitioners have named a proper respondent, i.e., a custodian over whom the Court has \n21  jurisdiction.2 \n22    At the time the instant action was filed, petitioners were detained either at Yuba \n23  County Jail (\"Yuba\"), a county facility, or at Mesa Verde Detention Facility (\"Mesa \n24  Verde\"), a privately run facility.  As both facilities are located in the Eastern District of \n25 \n \n26 \n2Petitioners contend respondents waived their right to raise this issue by not \naddressing it in their response to petitioners' motion for a temporary restraining order.  \n27 \nFor purposes of the instant order, the Court assumes respondents have not waived their \nability to raise this issue. \n28 \n2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-02064-MMC   Document 71   Filed 05/07/20   Page 3 of 6\n \n1  California, as would be the wardens or other officials who supervise the detainees \n2  therein, respondents argue the instant action should have been filed in the Eastern \n3  District.  The Court finds persuasive, however, decisions holding that where, as here, a \n4  detainee is, pursuant to a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"),   \n5  held in a county facility or a privately run facility, the proper custodian is the ICE official \n6  who \"oversee[s]\" the facility.  See Roman v. Ashcroft, 340 F.3d 314, 320-21 (6th Cir. \n7  2003) (holding \"District Director\" who \"oversee[s]\" facility where petitioner is detained is \n8  proper respondent in § 2241 action); Saravia v. Sessions, 280 F. Supp. 3d 1168, 1185 \n9  (N.D. Cal. 2017) (holding, in § 2241 action where \"petitioner [is] held in federal detention \n10  in a non-federal facility pursuant to a contract,\" proper respondent is \"federal official most \n11  directly responsible for overseeing that contract facility\"); Zabadi v. Chertoff, 2005 WL \n  12  1514122, at *3 (N.D. Cal. June 17, 2005) (holding, where petitioner is detained by ICE in \n a\ntruin\noro 13  county jail, ICE \"district director,\" having \"full authority to direct the local warden to \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  release petitioner,\" is proper respondent).  Additionally, as those cases explain, the \niD tc 15  district in which such ICE official is located is a proper forum in which to hear a detainee's \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  habeas petition.  See, e.g., Saravia, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 1187 (finding § 2241 petition \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  \"properly\" heard in district in which it was filed, where respondent ICE official with \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  oversight over jail detaining petitioner was within court's \"territorial jurisdiction\"). \nN\n19    Here, petitioners have named as a respondent David Jennings (\"Jennings\"), who, \n20  petitioners allege, is \"the Acting Field Director for the San Francisco Field Office of ICE\" \n21  and \"responsible for carrying out ICE's immigration detention operations at Mesa Verde \n22  and Yuba.\"  (See Petition ¶ 28.)  As respondents have not disputed Jennings' position, \n23  and in light of the authorities set forth above, the Court finds, as have other judges in this \n24  district, he is a proper respondent in § 2241 actions filed by detainees at Yuba and Mesa \n25  Verde; accordingly, the Court finds the petition is properly filed in this district.  See, e.g., \n26  Doe v. Barr, 2020 WL 1984266, at *5 (N.D. Cal. April 27, 2020) (finding Jennings is \n27  \"proper respondent\" in § 2241 petition filed by Yuba detainee); see also Zepeda Rivas v. \n28  Jennings, 2020 WL 2059848, at *2 (N.D. Cal. April 29, 2020) (finding Northern District of \n3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-02064-MMC   Document 71   Filed 05/07/20   Page 4 of 6\n \n1  California \"proper forum\" for § 2241 petition filed by detainees at Yuba and Mesa Verde, \n2  where petitioners named Jennings as respondent). \n3    The Court next considers whether the temporary restraining orders previously \n4  issued should be converted into a preliminary injunction.  As set forth in the April 8 Order, \n5  \"'[a] plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish [1] that he is likely to succeed \n6  on the merits, [2] that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary \n7  relief, [3] that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] that an injunction is in the \n8  public interest.'\"  (See April 8 Order at 2:10-13 (quoting Winter v. Natural Resources \n9  Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008)).) \n10    The Court, in its April 8 and April 14 Orders, identified the evidence and reasons \n11  why petitioners had shown the above-referenced four factors supported issuance of a \n  12  temporary restraining order, including their heightened risk of illness if infected with \n a\ntruin\noro 13  COVID-19 and their inability to practice meaningful social distancing or otherwise \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  meaningfully adhere to the country's health official's advice as to how to avoid contracting \niD tc 15  COVID-19.  (See April 8 Order at 6:6 – 8:15; April 14 Order at 2:1-20.) \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  In response to the orders to show cause, respondents argue the four factors now \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  weigh against granting injunctive relief.  In support thereof, respondents have submitted \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  evidence that, after the temporary restraining orders were issued, Yuba and Mesa Verde \nN\n19  increased supplies of soap and cleaning products available to detainees and provided \n20  masks to detainees and staff.  (See Kaiser Decl., filed April 28, 2020 ¶ 10; Bonnar Decl., \n21  filed April 28, 2020 ¶ 11.) \n22  Although such new procedures alleviate some of the conditions identified in the \n23  April 8 and April 14 Orders, individuals presently detained at Yuba and Mesa Verde \n24  continue to lack the ability to engage in social distancing and, were the Court to direct \n25  petitioners to return to said facilities, petitioners would encounter that same impediment, \n26  which, given their respective medical conditions, would expose them to a heightened risk \n27  of contracting a severe illness, a circumstance that outweighs the legitimate purposes \n28  expressed by ICE in seeking their detention.  Indeed, after taking account of the situation \n4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-02064-MMC   Document 71   Filed 05/07/20   Page 5 of 6\n \n1  existing at Yuba and Mesa Verde as of April 29, 2020, another district court recently \n2  certified a class consisting of all detainees at those two facilities, finding the conditions \n3  existing therein warranted injunctive relief.  See Zepeda Rivas, 2020 WL 2059848, at *2-\n4  *3 (noting \"it is undisputed that [ICE] has not come close to achieving social distancing for \n5  most detainees\"; further noting \"people are regularly being transported from facilities with \n6  COVID-19 cases,\" such as Santa Rita Jail, to Yuba and Mesa Verde). \n7    Respondents have also offered evidence that, as to Solorio Lopez, Torres Murillo, \n8  and Quinteros, immigration judges have continued each said alien's pending removal \n9  proceedings, in order to give priority to cases in which the alien remains in detention.  \n10  (See Bonnar Decl., filed April 22, 2020, ¶ 17 (stating proceedings in Solorio Lopez's case \n11  have been \"delayed indefinitely\"); see Kaiser Decl., filed April 28, 2020, ¶ 17 (stating \n  12  Torres Murillo's next hearing has been continued from April 29, 2020, to July 6, 2020); \n a\ntruin\noro 13  see Bonnar Decl., filed April 28, 2020, ¶ 19 (stating Quinteros's next hearing has been \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  continued from April 30, 2020, to a date that will be set on June 30, 2020).)  Although \niD tc 15  respondents argue any such delay is an additional reason why, as to these three \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  petitioners, injunctive relief would not serve the public interest in enforcement of \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  immigration laws, the decisions to continue their hearings were made by immigration \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  judges who, assumedly having such public interest in mind, found the continuances were \nN\n19  in the interests of justice.  Under the circumstances, the Court finds the above-referenced \n20  continuances are not a factor weighing against issuance of a preliminary injunction. \n21    In sum, the Court finds petitioners have continued to show that they are likely to \n22  succeed on the merits of their claims, that they are likely to suffer irreparable injury if not \n23  released during the COVID-19 pandemic, that the balance of hardships tips in their favor, \n24  and that the public interest is served by the requested injunctive relief. \n25    Accordingly, the Court finds issuance of a preliminary injunction as to the above-\n26  referenced six petitioners is warranted. \n27    The Court next considers whether, as respondents argue, the conditions set forth \n28  in the existing orders of release should be revised. \n5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-02064-MMC   Document 71   Filed 05/07/20   Page 6 of 6\n \n1    In that regard, respondents first reiterate their request, made in a statement filed \n2  April 10, 2020, that ICE be allowed to detain a petitioner without advance notice to the \n3  Court, if (1) ICE determines he has violated a condition of release, or (2) his removal \n4  order becomes final and ICE obtains a travel document.  The Court, by order filed April \n5  13, 2020, having denied respondents' initial request to impose such conditions, again \n6  finds insufficient cause exists to impose them. \n7    Respondents next assert that any preliminary injunction should \"expire when the \n8  current state and local shelter-in-place orders are lifted.\"  (See Response, filed April 22, \n9  2020, at 24:10-11; Response, filed April 28, 2020, at 24:16-17.)  The expiration of shelter-\n10  in-place orders, however, would not necessarily compel a finding that the conditions at \n11  Yuba and/or Mesa Verde have changed to the extent that the need for preliminary relief \n  12  would cease on that date.  Consequently, the Court declines at this time to specify a date \n a\ntruin\noro 13  on which the injunction will expire. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14    Lastly, respondents request that, should a petitioner subsequently seek court \niD tc 15  approval to change the address at which he will shelter in place, such petitioner should \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  be required to state he has obtained approval for the move from his parole officer, if he \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  has one, and to provide respondents with identifying information as to the person(s) at \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  the new address who will be responsible for him.  As petitioners do not object to this \nN\n19  request, the Court directs petitioners to include such information in any motion seeking \n20  approval of a change of residence. \n21  CONCLUSION \n22    For the reasons stated above, the Court finds petitioners are entitled to a \n23  preliminary injunction.  Specifically, the terms of the existing orders of release issued as \n24  to Medina Calderon, Lavrus, Joseph, Solorio Lopez, Torres Murillo, and Quinteros shall \n25  remain in effect until further order of the Court. \n26  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n27  Dated: May 7, 2020     \n  MAXINE M.

INTRODUCTION \n3  Plaintiffs, civil immigration detainees whose age and/or underlying medical conditions \n4  place them at elevated risk of serious illness or death from contracting COVID-19, seek \n5  emergency relief from this Court. Despite an overwhelming consensus of public health experts—\n6  including two doctors contracted by the Department of Homeland Security—Defendants have \n7  inexplicably and unjustifiably refused to reduce the number of people in detention in the face of \n8  COVID-19, beginning with the most medically vulnerable. Authorities nationwide are taking \n9  drastic measures necessary to contain this deadly pandemic. California jails released thousands \n10  of people incarcerated in the criminal justice system to avoid risking the lives of detainees and \n11  the community at large. “In light of the rapidly escalating public health crisis, which public \n12  health authorities predict will especially impact immigration detention centers,” the Ninth Circuit \n13  yesterday “order[ed] that [an immigration detainee] be immediately released from detention[.]” \n14  Xochihua-Jaimes v. Barr, -- F.3d --, No. 18-71460 (9th Cir., March 23, 2020) (for publication). \n15  Plaintiffs ask this Court to follow suit and order their immediate release.   \n16  Plaintiffs’ health conditions make them exceptionally vulnerable to serious illness or \n17  death if they contract COVID-19. The Eighth Amendment protects against “a condition of \n18  confinement that is sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering the next \n19  week or month or year.” Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993). As civil detainees, \n20  Plaintiffs enjoy greater protections under the Due Process Clause than prisoners do under the \n21  Eighth Amendment. COVID-19’s danger renders Plaintiffs’ ongoing detention unconstitutional.     \n22  This is the quintessential scenario in which emergency relief is necessary to avert \n23  irreparable harm. Public health experts agree that Plaintiffs will experience serious injury or \n24  death if infected by COVID-19, and that the spread of COVID-19 to immigration detention \n25  facilities is inevitable. Those experts agree, moreover, that reducing the number of people \n26  detained, starting with those who are most vulnerable to COVID-19, serves the public interest by \n27 \n28 \n2 \n \nNOTICE OF MOTION, MOTION AND MEMO IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n\n \n1  reducing the risk of widespread infection in a closed environment that will overwhelm demands \n2  on the local health care infrastructure, especially intensive care units. With ankle-monitoring and \n3  other alternatives to detention available, if necessary, ICE’s interest in Plaintiffs’ current \n4  detention pales in comparison to the extraordinary equities in favor of release. The Court should \n5  grant this motion and order Plaintiffs’ release.   \n6  II.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n7  A.  COVID-19 Has Killed Thousands of People, and While the Effort to Stop the \nOutbreak Has Transformed Human Behavior Around the World, ICE’s \n8  Response Has Been Haphazard and Wholly Inadequate. \n9  The medical information described below is based on the accompanying declarations of \n10  five physicians with first-hand knowledge of detainee health in immigration detention facilities: \n11  Robert Greifinger, MD, who has a long career of managing medical care for inmates (Greifinger \n12  ¶ 11); Marc Stern, MD, who has deep experience with the immigration detention system (Stern ¶ \n13  1); Ranit Mishori, MD, MHS, FAAFP,  who has studied medical outcomes of individuals in \n14  correctional facilities (Mishori ¶ 2); Jonathan Louis Golob, a professor specializing in infections \n15  in immunocompromised patients (Golob ¶ 2); and Allen S. Keller, MD, who has deep experience \n16  reporting on conditions of detention in ICE facilities (Keller ¶¶ 2-3). Plaintiffs also present the \n17  declarations of public health expert Sandra Hernandez, President and CEO of the California \n18  Healthcare Foundation and the former Director of Health for the City and County of San \n19  Francisco (Hernandez ⁋ 1); and Andrew Lorenzen-Strait, former Deputy Assistant Director of \n20  Enforcement and Removal Operations for ICE (Lorenzen-Strat ⁋ 2). \n21  It is now beyond dispute that COVID-19 is a rapidly escalating global pandemic with \n22  devastating effects, particularly on the elderly and immunocompromised. Golob ⁋⁋ 3, 8; Stern ⁋ \n23  5; Mishori ⁋ 9. The numbers of confirmed diagnoses and deaths cited on any given day quickly \n24  lose meaning as the figures grow exponentially. Golob ⁋ 2; Mishori ⁋ 6. In any event, the actual \n25  number of infected is far higher that what is reported, due to a shortage of diagnostic tests. \n26   \n1 All of the declarations submitted herewith will be cited using this shorthand, e.g., name of \n27  declarant followed by paragraph number. \n28 \n3 \n \nNOTICE OF MOTION, MOTION AND MEMO IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n\n \n1  Hernandez ⁋⁋ 8, 11; Mishori ⁋ 6. Alarming projections by the Centers for Disease Control and \n2  Prevention (“CDC”) indicate that over 200 million people in the United States could become \n3  infected with COVID-19 over the course of the epidemic without effective public health \n4  intervention, with as many as 1.5 million deaths in the most severe projections. Golob Decl. ¶ 11. \n5  There is no known vaccine, treatment, or cure for COVID-19. Golob ¶ 10. Because the \n6  virus has not been contained, the only available measures to effectively reduce the risk of \n7  infection are social distancing and improved hygiene. Id.; Hernandez ¶ 14. \n8  In a matter of days, COVID-19’s threat of mass fatalities has transformed American life.  \n9  Recognizing the public health threats posed by interpersonal proximity, cities and states have \n10  responded by imposing unprecedented restrictions on human interaction. On March 16, seven \n11  Bay Area counties established “shelter in place” orders, and the entire State of California \n12  followed three days later. Hernandez ¶ 18.  \n13  Many of the state’s largest jails have released people detained in the criminal justice \n14  system to protect those people and the community from COVID-19. Alameda County’s Santa \n15  Rita Jail released 250 people;2 Los Angeles County released more than 1,000;3 Kern County, \n16  where Mesa Verde is located, has released dozens.4 The New York Board of Corrections called \n17  for “bold and urgent action” to “drastically reduce the [] jail population.”5 The Supreme Court of \n18  New Jersey issued an order creating a presumption of release for every person serving a sentence \n19 \n20 \n \n21  2 See Maura Dolan, et al., California releases more jail inmates amid coronavirus crisis, L.A. \nTimes (March 20, 2020), https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-20/california-\n22  releases-more-jail-inmates-amid-coronavirus-crisis? \n3 See Alene Tchekmedyian, et al., L.A.

In the Matter of the Extradition of Alejandro \n4  Toledo Manrique, Case No. 19-mj-71055, 2020 WL 1307109, at *1 (N. D. Cal. March 19, 2020).  \n5  ICE’s response to the threats the pandemic poses to immigrants, by contrast, has been \n6  singularly resistant. Last week as Californians began sheltering in place in compliance with \n7  public health directives, ICE’s Los Angeles Field Office executed pre-dawn home raids to cram \n8  even more immigrants into ICE detention centers. The Field Office Director stated to the L.A. \n9  Times: “We couldn’t factor this in, right? This COVID-19 and the precautions that everybody’s \n10  taking . . . . We just have to continue to go with the same game plan that we’ve been doing.”7  \n11  Following public outcry, ICE issued a statement recognizing the need for alternatives to \n12  detention for new arrestees to protect public health, but has inexplicably refused to apply that \n13  same logic to its current detainees.8 ICE went so far as to claim, in response to a lawsuit for the \n14  release of vulnerable ICE detainees, that “Plaintiffs’ assertion that detention per se poses an \n15  increased risk of health complications or death from COVID-19 is purely speculative.” Defs’ \n16  Opp. at 8, Dawson v. Asher, ECF No. 28, Case No. 20-409 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 18, 2020).   \n17  While ICE refused to act to protect detainees, on March 19, 2020, two medical subject \n18  matter experts for the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Civil Rights and Civil \n19  Liberties wrote to Congress that, in order “to implement immediate social distancing to reduce \n20  the likelihood of exposure to detainees, facility personnel, and the general public, it is essential \n21  to consider releasing all detainees who do not pose an immediate risk to public safety.” Ltr. \n22  from Scott A.

A to Freeman Decl.). On multiple occasions since at least \n2  February 25, 2020, these experts have sounded the alarm within the agency on the imminent \n3  risks to the health of immigrant detainees and the public at large presented by COVID-19 unless \n4  swift mitigation measures, including decreasing the number of immigrant detainees, are taken. \n5  Id.  \n6  Inside the facilities, moreover, immigrants say that ICE is not consistently taking even \n7  the less aggressive precautionary measures the agency claims it is taking. As set forth more fully \n8  below, the declarations of the Plaintiffs and other residents of Mesa Verde and Yuba, as well as \n9  attorneys who have recently visited there, demonstrate the frightening consequences of ICE’s \n10  stubborn resistance to taking meaningful steps to mitigate the risk of infection. According to the \n11  two DHS whistleblower experts, “the track record of ICE facilities implementing [early \n12  screening, testing, isolation and quarantine] protocols historically has been inconsistent.” Allen \n13  & Rich Ltr. Moreover, even if ICE was consistently taking these precautions, the DHS experts \n14  explain that they “won’t be enough” without rapidly “releas[ing] those who do not pose an \n15  immediate danger to public safety.”9 \n16  B.  COVID-19 Poses Grave Risk of Harm, Including Serious Illness or Death, to \nOlder Adults and Those with Certain Medical Conditions. \n17 \n18  People over the age of fifty face greater chances of serious illness or death from COVID-\n19  19. Golob ¶ 3; Stern ¶ 5. The Centers for Disease Control has concluded that certain underlying \n20  medical conditions increase the risk of serious COVID-19 symptoms for people of any age. \n21  These include lung disease, heart disease, chronic liver or kidney disease, diabetes, epilepsy, \n22  compromised immune systems (such as from cancer, HIV, or an autoimmune disease), blood \n23  disorders (including sickle cell disease), inherited metabolic disorders, stroke, developmental \n24 \n25   \n9 Josiah Rich, Scott Allen & Mavis Noah, We Must Release Prisoners to Lessen the Spread of \n26  Coronavirus, The Washington Post, Mar. 17 2020, \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/17/we-must-release-prisoners-lessen-spread-\n27  coronavirus/. \n28 \n6 \n \nNOTICE OF MOTION, MOTION AND MEMO IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n\n \n1  delay, and pregnancy.10 Id. For people with these risk factors, the consequences of COVID-19 \n2  can be severe, including temporary or permanent damage to the heart and lungs or death. Golob \n3  ¶ 7. These complications can manifest at an alarming pace. Although individuals may be \n4  asymptomatic for up to 14 days and may transmit the virus during this time, they can show the \n5  first symptoms of infection in as little as two days after exposure, and their condition can \n6  seriously deteriorate in as little as five days or sooner. Stern ¶ 4. \n7  Most people in higher risk categories who develop severe effects of COVID-19 will need \n8  advanced supportive care, requiring highly specialized equipment that is in limited supply, and \n9  an entire team of care providers, including 1:1 or 1:2 nurse to patient ratios, respiratory \n10  therapists, and intensive care physicians. Golob ¶ 8.11 Because severe COVID-19 cases require \n11  intensive medical care, an outbreak can “quickly overwhelm a health system,” particularly in \n12  medically under-resourced rural areas. Greifinger ¶ 9; Hernandez ⁋ 23.  \n13  The need for care, including intensive care, and the likelihood of lasting complications \n14  and death, is about ten times higher from COVID-19 infection than from influenza. Golob ¶ 4. \n15  For people in the highest risk populations, the fatality rate of COVID-19 infection is about \n16  fifteen percent. Id.  \n17  C.  People Detained at Mesa Verde and Yuba Face an Elevated Risk of COVID-\n19 Transmission.  \n18 \n19  People in congregate environments—places where people live, eat, and sleep in close \n20  proximity—face increased danger of contracting COVID-19, as evidenced by the rapid spread of \n21  the virus in cruise ships and nursing homes. Golob ¶ 12. Immigration detention facilities have \n22  even an even greater risk of infectious spread than in the community and other congregate \n23  settings because of crowding, the proportion of vulnerable people detained, often deficient \n24   \n10 This list is evolving. On March 23, 2020, the CDC updated its previous list as to who is at \n25  higher risk of serious illness if they were to contract COVID-19. See \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/people-at-higher-risk.html \n26  11 Even some younger and healthier people who contract COVID-19 may require supportive \ncare, which includes supplemental oxygen, positive pressure ventilation, and in extreme cases, \n27  extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation. Golob ¶ 5; Greifinger ¶ 6. \n28 \n7 \n \nNOTICE OF MOTION, MOTION AND MEMO IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n\n \n1  hygiene and sanitation, and scant medical resources. Greifinger ¶¶ 14-20; Mishori ¶¶ 16-22; \n2  Keller ¶¶ 6-11. People live in close quarters and may be unable to maintain the recommended \n3  distance of six feet from others; there is often insufficient capacity for isolation of potentially or \n4  actually infected people; people share or touch objects used by others; toilets, sinks, and showers \n5  are shared, without disinfection between each use; food preparation and service is communal \n6  with little opportunity for surface disinfection; detainees and staff come and go frequently. Id. \n7  This is particularly problematic because people can transmit the disease while they are still \n8  asymptomatic. Keller ¶ 13. Dr. Keller concludes that even under normal conditions, the health \n9  care provided in immigration detention facilities is often unsafe, and this conclusion is backed up \n10  by numerous recent governmental, non-governmental and investigative reports.  Keller ¶ 14. Dr. \n11  Greifinger, who currently monitors medical care for federal courts in three large county jails, \n12  concludes it is “highly likely, and perhaps inevitable” that COVID-19 will reach immigration \n13  detention facilities in California, and that these facilities “are not prepared to prevent the spread \n14  of COVID-19, treat those who are most medically vulnerable, and contain any outbreak.” \n15  Greifinger ¶¶ 13, 23. In fact, because the virus is communicated by air or touch, it is more likely \n16  to spread in these congregate environments; for this reason, detention facilities and jails have \n17  repeatedly been the sites of past outbreaks of infectious diseases. Mishori ¶¶ 24, 26-27. During \n18  the H1N1 influenza epidemic in 2009, jails and prisons were sites of severe outbreaks. Id.12 \n19  There have already been COVID-19 outbreaks in jails which are ill-equipped to respond. \n20  Greifinger ⁋ 24.   \n21  Recently observed conditions at Mesa Verde and Yuba confirm experts’ worst fears.  \n22  Mesa Verde is an extremely compact facility where people sleep in bunk beds spaced only a few \n23  feet apart and spend most of their time during the day in dorms that house up to 100 detainees. \n24  Knox ¶ 9.

One client reported that these conditions had not changed \n4  as recently as March 19, 2020. Id. ¶ 15. At Mesa Verde, an attorney visiting as recently as March \n5  13, 2020 was denied a request to bring sanitizer with her and observed no hand sanitizer \n6  anywhere in the facility or any place to wash hands in the room where attorney visits are \n7  conducted. Id. ¶ 6. On this same day, no one was observed wearing masks; no signs were posted \n8  providing any information about coronavirus; and some detainees had not even been given any \n9  soap. Id. ¶¶ 7-8. The facility lacks the medical resources to respond to even basic medical issues, \n10  with detainees being denied necessary medications, or the wrong medication being given. Id. ¶ 4. \n11  At Yuba, based on the direct observations of an attorney who conducts frequent site \n12  visits, detainees typically sleep in bunks that are less than three feet from each other; many of the \n13  housing units are extremely compact. Kavanagh ¶¶ 1, 3, 5, 10-11. Meals are served in group \n14  settings by detainees or county jail inmates with no instruction concerning sanitation. Id. ¶¶ 3-4. \n15  Cleaning is done by the detainees themselves, using dirty buckets of mop water and reused rags.  \n16  Id. ¶ 4.

Id. ¶¶ 14-15 \n19  D.  Plaintiffs Are Vulnerable to Serious Illness or Death if Infected by COVID-\n19.  \n20 \n21  Plaintiffs’ experiences, and those of non-Plaintiff declarants13 confirm, in the starkest of \n22  terms, what the experts and attorney visitors are saying. It is difficult, if not impossible, within \n23  the confines of this brief, to adequately convey the nightmarish effects on Plaintiffs of their \n24  ongoing detention by Defendants during the current pandemic. In light of their age and/or \n25  compromised health, Plaintiffs live in constant terror of contracting COVID-19.  \n26   \n13 Most of the accompanying detainees’ declarations are submitted by Plaintiffs; several \n27  additional declarations are submitted by detainees who are not Plaintiffs.  \n28 \n9 \n \nNOTICE OF MOTION, MOTION AND MEMO IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n\n \n1  Plaintiffs’ detention is imposing an unspeakable physical and mental toll on each of \n2  them.14 Plaintiffs already know what the experts are saying: that the conditions of their \n3  confinement—including living in close quarters with 100 or more other detainees,15 close contact \n4  with guards and staff,16 the constant influx and transfer of new detainees,17 being forced to clean \n5  toilets and common areas without adequate protective gear,18 and being denied adequate personal \n6  hygiene supplies or clean clothing19—increase their likelihood of contracting the virus. They also \n7  understand, and are terrified of, the high likelihood that, if they do contract the virus, they would \n8  suffer serious or even fatal consequences.20 They already suffer from a serious lack of adequate \n9 \n10 \n11   \n14 Due to the difficulty of getting signed declarations from Plaintiff detainees on short notice, \n12  some declarations have been submitted by their attorneys, attesting to statements made by their \nclients.

In Light of Current Conditions, Public Health Experts Agree that People \n1  Most Vulnerable to COVID-19 Should Be Released from ICE Detention \nFacilities Immediately. \n2 \n3  Because risk mitigation is the only known strategy that can protect vulnerable groups \n4  from COVID-19, and because it is virtually impossible to engage in the necessary social \n5  distancing and hygiene required to mitigate the risk of transmission in a congregate environment, \n6  public health experts with experience in immigration detention and correctional settings agree \n7  that “the most effective mitigation strategy” is to reduce crowding by releasing detainees from \n8  custody. Greifinger ¶ 27; Hernandez ¶ 28; Stern ¶¶ 11; Allen & Rich Ltr. at 5 (“it is essential to \n9  consider releasing all detainees who do not pose an immediate risk to public safety”) (emphasis \n10  in original). Dr. Stern recommends “downsizing of these detention facilities, with priority given \n11  to those in high risk of harm due to their age and health status.” Stern ¶ 11. Dr. Greifinger \n12  likewise has concluded that “[t]he most urgent need is to remove those who are medically \n13  vulnerable, and at risk of the most severe effects of COVID-19 from the heightened risk of \n14  transmission found in the congregate setting of the immigration detention facility.” Greifinger ¶ \n15  25. Dr. Keller reviewed the medical conditions that Plaintiffs report having been diagnosed with \n16  and concluded that each of them is “at risk of severe effects of COVID-19 if infected, because of \n17  their underlying medical conditions, their advanced age, or both.” Keller ¶ 24.36  \n18  The release of detainees from Mesa Verde and Yuba is also important for a second \n19  reason: it reduces the risk of the spread of disease within the facilities and mitigates the possible \n20  effects on the public health systems of the surrounding communities. Reducing the population in \n21  a facility allows for greater social distancing, allows easier provision of preventive measures \n22  such as soap for handwashing and cleaning supplies for surfaces, and helps the detention staff to \n23   \nWaldron (Solorio Lopez) ⁋ 19; Bahena Ortuño ⁋ 15; Patel (Quinteros) ⁋⁋ 12-13; Martinez Lopez \n24  ⁋ 10; Joseph ⁋⁋ 22-23; Upshaw (Lavrus) ⁋ 17; Minchaca Ramos ⁋⁋ 17-18. \n36 In the event that vulnerable detainees have been exposed to COVID-19, these experts \n25  recommend testing where possible and releasing detainees to a quarantine setting outside of \ndetention in coordination with local health authorities. Greifinger ¶¶ 29-30; Stern ¶ 17. Release \n26  would be appropriate even if individuals have symptoms of COVID-19. Released detainees \ncould rest and recuperate at home and should not be in a congregate living situation where they \n27  expose others to potential infection. Hernandez ¶ 32. \n28 \n12 \n \nNOTICE OF MOTION, MOTION AND MEMO IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n\n \n1  continue to ensure detainees’ safety, all of which reduce the likelihood of spread of the disease. \n2  Stern ¶ 9.37 These measures therefore not only protect the remaining detainee population but also \n3  the staff and employees of ICE, who work at these facilities, along with their families and \n4  contacts. Id.; Greifinger ¶ 21. \n5  Moreover, detention facilities are integral parts of the public health infrastructure of their \n6  surrounding communities. The spread of COVID-19 at Mesa Verde or Yuba will have ripple \n7  effects in the surrounding community as detainees will need intensive care at local hospitals \n8  which would “quickly become overwhelmed in the face of an infectious disease outbreak.” \n9  Greifinger ¶ 19; Hernandez ¶¶ 23-25. Reducing the spread and severity of infection inside Mesa \n10  Verde and Yuba slows, if not reduces, the number of people who will become ill enough to \n11  require hospitalization, which would strain the health and economies of those medically under-\n12  resourced communities. Id.   \n13  III.  DETENTION PUTS PLAINTIFFS AT AN UNCONSTITUTIONALLY HIGH \nRISK OF COVID-19 AND THE EQUITIES STRONGLY FAVOR RELEASE \n14  UNDER CURRENT EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES. \nA.  Legal Standard \n15 \n16  On a motion for a temporary restraining order, the plaintiff “must establish that he is \n17  likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \n18  preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the \n19  public interest.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008); Stuhlbarg Int’l \n20  Sales Co. v. John D. Brush & Co., 240 F.3d 832, 839 n.7 (9th Cir. 2001) (noting that preliminary \n21  injunction and temporary restraining order standards are “substantially identical”). A temporary \n22  restraining order may likewise issue where “serious questions going to the merits [are] raised and \n23  the balance of hardships tips sharply in [plaintiff’s] favor.” All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, \n24  632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). To succeed under the “serious question” \n25   \n37 See also Rich, et al., We Must Release Prisoners to Lessen the Spread of Coronavirus, The \n26  Washington Post, Mar. 17 2020 (explaining that “[i]t is essential to understand that, despite \nbeing physically secure, jails and prisons are not isolated from the community” and “people \n27  continuously enter and leave.”). \n28 \n13 \n \nNOTICE OF MOTION, MOTION AND MEMO IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n\n \n1  test, plaintiffs must show that they are likely to suffer irreparable injury and that an injunction is \n2  in the public’s interest. Id. at 1132. \n3  B.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits. \n4  1.  The Constitution Protects Immigrant Detainees Against Exposure to \nHarmful Diseases. \n5 \n6  Immigrant detainees, even those with prior criminal convictions, are civil detainees held \n7  pursuant to civil immigration laws. Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690 (2001). Their \n8  constitutional protections while in custody are derived from the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \n9  Amendment, which provides protection significantly greater than the Eighth Amendment’s ban \n10  on cruel and unusual punishment.   \n11  Even the Eighth Amendment, however, imposes on the government an affirmative duty \n12  to provide conditions of reasonable health and safety to the people it holds in its custody: \n  \n13  [W]hen the State takes a person into its custody and holds him there against his \nwill, the Constitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to assume some \n14  responsibility for his safety and general well-being . . . . The rationale for this \nprinciple is simple enough: when the State by the affirmative exercise of its power \n15  so restrains an individual’s liberty that it renders him unable to care for himself, \nand at the same time fails to provide for his basic human needs—e.g., food, \n16  clothing, shelter, medical care, and reasonable safety—it transgresses the \nsubstantive limits on state action set by the Eighth Amendment[.] \n17   \n18  DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 199-200 (1989). Conditions \n19  that pose an unreasonable risk of future harm violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition \n20  against cruel and unusual punishment, even if that harm has not yet come to pass. Thus, prison \n21  authorities cannot “ignore a condition of confinement that is sure or very likely to cause serious \n22  illness and needless suffering the next week or month or year.” Helling, 509 U.S. at 33. For \n23  example, inmates cannot be comingled with others having infectious maladies such as hepatitis \n24  and venereal disease. Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 682 (1978); Gates v. Collier, 501 F.2d 1291 \n25  (5th Cir. 1974). An Eighth Amendment violation is established even though the plaintiff cannot \n26  yet “prove that he is currently suffering serious medical problems caused by” the exposure. \n27  Helling, 509 U.S. at 32. \n28 \n14 \n \nNOTICE OF MOTION, MOTION AND MEMO IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n\n \n1  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides even greater protection to civil \n2  immigrant detainees. While the Eighth Amendment prohibits punishment that is “cruel and \n3  unusual,” the Fifth Amendment’s due process protections do not allow “punishment” at all. Bell \n4  v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 n.16 (1979) (“Due process requires that a pretrial detainee not be \n5  punished.”).  \n6  Civil detainees are entitled to “more considerate treatment” than their criminal \n7  counterparts. Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 321-22 (1982); Jones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918, \n8  933-34 (9th Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 820 (2005); See also King v. Cty. of Los Angeles, \n9  885 F.3d 548, 557 (9th Cir. 2018) (finding presumption of punitive, and thus unconstitutional, \n10  treatment where conditions of confinement for civil detainees are similar to those faced by pre-\n11  trial criminal detainees). And while convicted persons must show “deliberate indifference” on \n12  the part of prison officials to establish a violation of the Eighth Amendment, Farmer v. Brennan, \n13  511 U.S. 825, 828 (1994), there is no such requirement for civil detainees challenging their \n14  conditions of confinement. Jones, 393 F.3d at 934 (“[T]o prevail on a [Due Process] claim \n15  regarding conditions of confinement, the confined individual need not provide ‘deliberate \n16  indifference’ on the part of government officials.”) (emphasis added).  \n17  If placing an inmate in a situation creating an elevated risk of potentially lethal infection \n18  constitutes “cruel and unusual punishment” in violation of the Eighth Amendment, as was found \n19  in Hutto and Gates, placing a civil detainee in a situation presenting a serious risk of lethal \n20  infection is certainly unconstitutional in violation of the Fifth Amendment.38 \n21 \n \n22  38 Notably, the risk of infection need not depend on a current positive test for COVID-19. Cf. In \nthe Matter of the Extradition of Alejandro Toledo Manrique, 2020 WL 1307109, at *1 (“The \n23  Court is glad to hear that there are currently no reported cases of COVID-19 at Maguire, but is \nunsure what that means if people are not being tested. And, . . . symptoms of COVID-19 can \n24  begin to appear 2-14 days after exposure, so screening people based on observable symptoms is \njust a game of catch up. That’s why the Bay Area is on lockdown. We don’t know who’s \n25  infected. Accordingly, the government’s suggestion that [petitioner] should wait until there is a \nconfirmed outbreak of COVID-19 in [the detention facility] before seeking release, . . . is \n26  impractical. By then it may be too late.”); Golob ⁋ 7 (“A lack of proven cases of COVID-19 in \nthe context of a lack of testing is functionally meaningless for determining if there is a risk of \n27  COVID-19 transmission in a community or institution.”).  \n28 \n15 \n \nNOTICE OF MOTION, MOTION AND MEMO IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n\n \n2.  The Harm to Plaintiffs from the Threat of COVID-19 is Excessive in \n1  Relation to the Government’s Interest, in Violation of Substantive \nDue Process. \n2 \n3  A condition of confinement for a civil immigration detainee violates the Fifth \n4  Amendment “if it imposes some harm to the detainee that significantly exceeds or is independent \n5  of the inherent discomforts of confinement and is not reasonably related to a legitimate \n6  governmental objective or is excessive in relation to the legitimate governmental objective.” \n7  Unknown Parties v. Johnson, No. CV-15-00250-TUC-DCB, 2016 WL 8188563, at *5 (D. Ariz. \n8  Nov. 18, 2016), aff’d sub nom. Doe v. Kelly, 878 F.3d 710 (9th Cir. 2017) (citing Kingsley v. \n9  Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2473-74 (2015)). As Dr. Keller concluded, Plaintiffs are each “at \n10  risk of severe effects of COVID-19 if infected, because of their underlying medical conditions, \n11  their advanced age, or both.” Keller ¶ 24. The risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19 \n12  unquestionably exceeds “the inherent discomforts of confinement.” Id. In normal times, \n13  crowding and close quarters, the sharing of toilets, sinks, and showers, and communal food \n14  preparation and service may be considered uncomfortable. But in light of COVID-19, these \n15  conditions present a deadly threat to Plaintiffs’ lives. See supra Section II.B-E.  \n16  This threat vastly outweighs any government interest in Plaintiffs’ confinement. Because \n17  immigration proceedings are civil and non-punitive, “[t]here is no sufficiently strong special \n18  justification . . . for indefinite civil detention.” Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690. If the government’s \n19  interest in effectuating removal and protecting the community cannot justify indefinite detention, \n20  it surely cannot justify the “potentially permanent” medical harm and death that Plaintiffs could \n21  face. See id. at 690-91; cf. D’Alessandro v. Mukasey, 628 F. Supp. 2d 368, 399 (W.D.N.Y. 2009) \n22  (considering immigrant’s age and “constellation of serious, debilitating, and progressive health \n23  problems” to weigh against flight risk concerns and interest in continued detention). \n24  That criminal justice authorities have released masses of people from jails to prevent \n25  COVID-19 harms further indicates that Plaintiffs’ confinement violates due process. See supra \n26  Section II.A. The relatively higher COVID-19 danger that Plaintiffs now face renders their \n27  custody unconstitutional. See Unknown Parties v. Nielsen, CV-15-00250-TUC-DCB, 2020 WL \n28 \n16 \n \nNOTICE OF MOTION, MOTION AND MEMO IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n\n \n1  813774, *7 (D. Ariz., Feb. 19, 2020) (holding that Border Patrol conditions of confinement \n2  presumptively violated due process because they were more restrictive than conditions for \n3  pretrial detainees in jails and prisons). \n4  Plaintiffs are likely to prevail regardless of the particular detention authority that \n5  Defendants might invoke. Even for those plaintiffs subject to “mandatory” detention under 8 \n6  U.S.C. § 1226(c), the due process violation presented by these exceptional circumstances would \n7  override any general detention mandate. See Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 18 (1958) (explaining \n8  U.S. Constitution’s role as “supreme law of the land”); In re Brichard Securities Litigation, 788 \n9  F. Supp. 1098, 1112 (N.D. Cal. 1992) (“[C]oncerns” about legislative intent “cannot override the \n10  Constitution.”). Indeed, the Ninth Circuit recently noted in another immigration detention case \n11  that due process overrides § 1226(c) in certain common circumstances. See Rodriguez v. Marin, \n12  909 F.3d 252, 256 (9th Cir. 2018) (“We have grave doubts that any statute that allows for \n13  arbitrary prolonged detention without any process is constitutional or that those who founded our \n14  democracy precisely to protect against the government’s arbitrary deprivation of liberty would \n15  have thought so.”). In any event, ICE has released detainees held pursuant to § 1226(c) for \n16  humanitarian reasons, See Lorenzen-Strait ¶ 11, and cannot then object that such relief here \n17  would be problematic.39 The exceptional risk COVID-19 poses to Plaintiffs exceeds any interest \n18  Defendants might otherwise have in their detention.40   \n19   \n39 Plaintiffs acknowledge that some of them have prior criminal convictions for which they have \n20  already served their criminal sentences. Plaintiffs anticipate that Defendants may seize on these \nconvictions to argue against release, but prior convictions have no bearing on the question of \n21  whether their conditions of civil confinement violate their constitutional rights. Past convictions \nalone also cannot show that a person currently poses an “identified and articulable threat to an \n22  individual or the community.” United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 751 (1987) (finding Bail \nReform Act to be constitutional on its face only because it was narrowly drawn and contained \n23  rebuttable presumptions in favor of detention for certain people accused of serious crimes, as \nopposed to categorical detention mandates). In any event, conditions of release could mitigate \n24  any danger Defendants might fear would be caused by release. See infra Section III.C.2.   \n40 Another district court recently denied a TRO to immigration detainees who sought release \n25  because of COVID-19. See Dawson v. Asher, Case No. 20-cv-409, 2020 WL 1304557 (W.D. \nWash. Mar. 19, 2020). That case was wrongly decided and rested on a materially distinguishable \n26  record. The Dawson court accepted ICE’s claims that its preventive measures were adequate. But \nthe DHS medical-expert whistleblowers’ have since shown that those measures are insufficient \n27  absent the release of detainees to enable necessary social distancing and isolation. Moreover, \n28 \n17 \n \nNOTICE OF MOTION, MOTION AND MEMO IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n\n \n3.  The Court Has Authority to Order Plaintiffs’ Release as the Sole \n1  Effective Remedy for the Constitutional Violation. \n2 \nIn this case, the release of Plaintiffs from detention is the only effective remedy for the \n3 \nconstitutional violation they face. Cf. Stone v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 968 F.2d 850, 861 \n4 \n(9th Cir. 1992) (“Federal courts possess whatever powers are necessary to remedy constitutional \n5 \nviolations because they are charged with protecting these rights.”). Yesterday, the Ninth Circuit \n6 \nsua sponte ordered the “immediate” release of an immigration detainee, “[i]n light of the rapidly \n7 \nescalating public health crisis, which public health authorities predict will especially impact \n8 \nimmigration detention centers[.]” Xochihua-Jaimes v. Barr, -- F.3d --, No. 18-71460 (9th Cir., \n9 \nMarch 23, 2020) (for publication).41 Here too, release is the only way to address the \n10 \nconstitutional violations Plaintiffs face. Preventive measures that may be effective in the \n11 \ncommunity, such as maintaining a distance of six feet from other persons and frequent \n12 \ndisinfection, are simply not possible in the detention setting.  \n13   \nRisk mitigation is the only viable public health strategy available to limit \n14  transmission of infection, morbidity and mortality in immigration detention \ncenters, and to decrease the likely public health impact outside of the detention \n15  centers. Even with the best-laid plans to address the spread of COVID-19 in \ndetention facilities, the release of individuals, prioritizing the most medically \n16  vulnerable individuals, is a key part of a risk mitigation strategy. \n \n17 \nGreifinger ¶ 22.         \n18 \nRelease is also the typical habeas remedy. See Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 693 (2008). \n19 \nAs the Supreme Court recently stated, a detainee may seek expedited relief from unconstitutional \n20 \nconditions of confinement through habeas. See Ziglar v. Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1863 (2017) \n21 \n \n22  Plaintiffs’ declarations here show that ICE is not consistently undertaking the measures it cited in \nDawson. For example, the agency is introducing new detainees into the general population \n23  without any mandatory quarantine period and not placing detainees “who meet the CDC criteria \nfor epidemiologic risk of exposure to COVID-19 … separately from the general population” or \n24  ensuring those exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms are placed “in a single medical housing room.” \nSee ICE Guidance on COVID-19, https://www.ice.gov/covid19. Finally, the Ninth Circuit’s \n25  order in Xochihua-Jaimes, based on public health authorities’ consensus that the escalating crisis \n“will especially impact immigration detention centers,” directly undermines the Dawson court’s \n26  approach of waiting for an outbreak before ordering release. \n41 The Ninth Circuit ordered the detainee’s immediate release even though that person’s felony \n27  criminal history would have subjected them to “mandatory” detention under § 1226(c).  \n28 \n18 \n \nNOTICE OF MOTION, MOTION AND MEMO IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n\n \n1  (noting that “the habeas remedy, if necessity required its use, would have provided a faster and \n2  more direct route to relief” for detainees because “[a] successful habeas petition would have \n3  required officials to place respondents in less-restrictive conditions immediately”). Moreover, the \n4  principle that a federal court may release individuals to remedy unconstitutional conditions is \n5  well established. See Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 511 (2011) (“When necessary to ensure \n6  compliance with a constitutional mandate, courts may enter orders placing limits on a prison’s \n7  population.”); Duran v. Elrod, 713 F.2d 292, 297-98 (7th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1108 \n8  (1984) (concluding that court did not exceed its authority in directing release of low-bond \n9  pretrial detainees as necessary to reach a population cap).   \n10  Courts in this District and elsewhere have also recognized the severe harm that the risk of \n11  COVID-19 transmission poses to detainees, and released them from confinement or modified \n12  their conditions of probation accordingly. See, e.g., In the Matter of the Extradition of Alejandro \n13  Toledo Manrique, 2020 WL 1307109, at *1 (Hixson, M. J.) (ordering release of vulnerable 74-\n14  year-old on bail in light of “risk of serious illness or death if he remains in custody”); United \n15  States v.

Mar. 12, 2020) (continuing defendant \n24  on pretrial release rather than remanding him in part due to recognition that “[t]he more people \n25  we crowd into that facility, the more we’re increasing the risk to the community”). \n26  This Court and other courts also regularly grant outright release to immigrants in civil \n27  custody when continued detention would violate their due process rights. See Jimenez v. Wolf, \n28 \n19 \n \nNOTICE OF MOTION, MOTION AND MEMO IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n\n \n1  No. 19-cv-07996-NC, 2020 WL1082648 (N.D. Cal. 2020) (granting motion to enforce habeas of \n2  immigrant detainee charged with drug trafficking and convicted of accessory after the fact and \n3  ordering release of petitioner with appropriate conditions of supervision); Ramos v. Sessions, 293 \n4  F.Supp.3d 1021, 1030-31 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 13, 2018); (same for immigrant detainee with two \n5  prior DUI convictions); Sales v. Johnson, No. 16-cv-01745-EDL, 2017 WL 6855827, at *6 \n6  (N.D. Cal. 2017) (same for immigrant detainee with prior second-degree murder conviction); \n7  Judalang v. Chertoff, 562 F.Supp.2d 1119 (S.D. Cal. 2008) (same for immigrant detainee with \n8  prior voluntary manslaughter conviction). This case should be no different.42    \n9  C.  The Remaining Factors Weigh Heavily in Favor of Granting a Temporary \nRestraining Order.  \n10 \n1.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Suffer Irreparable Harm Absent the \n11  Temporary Restraining Order. \n12 \nThe Ninth Circuit has made clear that “the deprivation of constitutional rights \n13 \nunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.” Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. \n14 \n2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). The dangerous conditions of detention that Plaintiffs \n15 \nface also constitute irreparable harm supporting injunctive relief. See Padilla v. U.S. Immigration \n16 \n& Customs Enforcement, 387 F.Supp.3d 1219, 1231 (W.D. Wash. 2019) (recognizing that \n17 \n“substandard physical conditions, [and] low standards of medical care” in immigration detention \n18 \nconstitute irreparable harm justifying injunctive relief); See also Hernandez v. Sessions, 872 F.3d \n19 \n976, 995 (9th Cir. 2017) (explaining the “irreparable harms imposed on anyone subject to \n20 \nimmigration detention” including the “evidence of subpar medical and psychiatric care in ICE \n21 \ndetention facilities”). The Ninth Circuit also has recognized that irreparable harm exists where \n22 \n23   \n42 ICE presently has, and routinely exercises, the discretion to release particularly vulnerable \n24  individuals from custody on humanitarian grounds. Lorenzen-Strait ¶¶ 3-8; 8 U.S.C. §§ \n1182(d)(5); 1226(a), 1231(a)(3), 8 C.F.R. § 212.5(b)(1). Importantly, ICE’s discretion applies \n25  regardless of the statutory basis for the noncitizen’s detention. Id. ¶ 11 (“[I]ndividuals held under \nmandatory detention, pursuant to [8 U.S.C. § 1226(c)], were also eligible for release”). In \n26  particular, ICE has taken into consideration factors such as whether the detainees faced a \nheightened risk of medical harm in detention, id. ¶¶ 5-7, and would release individuals where \n27  appropriate medical care was not available in custody, id. ¶ 9. \n28 \n20 \n \nNOTICE OF MOTION, MOTION AND MEMO IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n\n \n1  government actions threaten an individual’s health. See M.R. v. Dreyfus, 663 F.3d 1100, 1111 \n2  (9th Cir. 2011), as amended by 697 F.3d 706 (9th Cir 2012); Indep. Living Cent. of S. California, \n3  Inc. v. Shewry, 543 F.3d 1047, 1050 (9th Cir. 2008) (recognizing that Medi-Cal beneficiaries \n4  would suffer irreparable harm where new policy would limit their access to pharmaceuticals). \n5  The conditions of Plaintiffs’ detention threaten not only their health, but their lives. \n6  2.  The Public Interest and Balance of Equities Weigh Heavily in \nPlaintiffs’ Favor. \n7 \n8  Both the balance of equities and the public interest heavily favor the Plaintiffs. “[I]t is \n9  always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party’s constitutional rights.” \n10  Melendres, 695 F.3d at 1002 (quotation omitted). Moreover, there can be no public interest in \n11  exposing vulnerable persons to increased risks of severe illness and death. “Faced with . . . \n12  preventable human suffering, [the Ninth Circuit] ha[s] little difficulty concluding that the balance \n13  of hardships tips decidedly in plaintiffs’ favor.” Hernandez v. Sessions, 872 F.3d 976, 996 (9th \n14  Cir. 2017) (quoting Lopez v. Heckler, 713 F.2d 1432, 1437 (9th Cir. 1983)). \n15  It is in both the Defendants’ and the broader public interest to release detainees with \n16  particular medical vulnerabilities. The release of people most vulnerable to COVID-19 reduces \n17  the overall health risk for detainees and facility staff alike at Mesa Verde and Yuba. Stern ¶¶ 10-\n18  13; See also Allen & Rich Ltr. at 5 (“it is essential to consider releasing all detainees who do not \n19  pose an immediate risk to public safety”) (emphasis in original). ICE has an interest in \n20  preventing any potential spread of COVID-19 in its detention facilities, particularly because \n21  detainees face great difficulty engaging in proper hygiene and social distancing in a detention \n22  environment. Id. ¶ 9. Immigration detention facilities face greater risk of infectious spread \n23  because of crowding, the high percentage of detained people vulnerable to serious illness in the \n24  event of COVID-19 transmission, and limited availability of medical care. Greifinger ¶¶ 26-27. \n25  Public health officials have explained that even with the best-laid plans, the release of vulnerable \n26  individuals is key to the risk mitigation strategy of any detention facility because it reduces the \n27  total number of detainees, allows for greater social distancing, and prevents overloading the \n28 \n21 \n \nNOTICE OF MOTION, MOTION AND MEMO IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n\n \n1  work of detention staff. Stern ¶¶ 11-12; Greifinger ¶ 21. Plaintiffs’ release not only imposes \n2  minimal harm to the government, but also furthers ICE’s interests in maintaining a healthy and \n3  orderly environment at Mesa Verde and Yuba.  \n4  Last, releasing Plaintiffs is clearly in the broader public’s interest. Here, “the impact of [a \n5  temporary restraining order] reaches beyond the parties, carrying with it a potential for public \n6  consequences.” Hernandez, 872 F.3d at 996 (quotation omitted). An outbreak of COVID-19 \n7  could put significant pressure on or exceed the capacity of local health infrastructure. Stern ¶ 6. \n8  The COVID-19 outbreak has already resulted in the need for unprecedented public health \n9  measures and caused a strain on local health care systems. Greifinger ¶ 12. The release of people \n10  most vulnerable to serious illness from COVID-19 reduces the health and economic burden on \n11  the local community and health infrastructure at large. Greifinger ¶ 28; Stern ¶ 13; See also \n12  Hernandez, 872 F.3d at 996-97 (“[T]he general public’s interest in efficient allocation of the \n13  government’s fiscal resources favors granting [relief]”).  \n14  To the extent the equities weigh in favor of some restraint on Plaintiffs’ liberty, that can \n15  be achieved through fashioning reasonable release conditions, which might include electronic \n16  monitoring. See e.g., Hernandez, 872 F.3d at 995 (finding that ICE had put forth no evidence \n17  regarding the administrative burdens of considering alternatives to detention). Such conditions \n18  are routine in both criminal and immigration release settings and are effective. A government-\n19  contracted evaluation of a program that featured monitoring instead of immigration detention \n20  reported a 99% attendance rate at all immigration court hearings and a 95% attendance rate at \n21  final hearings. See U.S. Gov’t Accountability Office, GAO-15-26, Alternatives to Detention: \n22  Improved Data Collection and Analyses Needed to Better Assess Program Effectiveness 10-11 \n23  (Nov. 2014). Another program studied in 2011 saw fewer than 1% of participants removed from \n24  the program due to arrest by another law enforcement agency. See Jennings v. Rodriguez, 2016 \n25  WL 6276890, at *36-37 (U.S. 2016) (Brief of Amicus Curiae).   \n26 \n27 \n28 \n22 \n \nNOTICE OF MOTION, MOTION AND MEMO IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n\n \n3.  The Court Should Not Require Plaintiffs to Provide Security Prior to \n1  Issuing a Temporary Restraining Order. \n2  “Rule 65(c) invests the district court with discretion as to the amount of security required, \n3  if any.” Jorgensen v. Cassiday, 320 F.3d 906, 919 (9th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks and \n4  citation omitted). District courts routinely exercise this discretion to require no security in cases \n5  brought by indigent and/or incarcerated people. See, e.g., Toussaint v. Rushen, 553 F. Supp. \n6  1365, 1383 (N.D. Cal. 1983) (state prisoners); Orantes–Hernandez v. Smith, 541 F. Supp. 351, \n7  385 n. 42 (C.D. Cal. 1982) (detained immigrants). This Court should do the same here. \n8  IV.

      "text": "Case 3:20-cv-02064-MMC   Document 51   Filed 04/14/20   Page 1 of 5\n \n1   \n2   \n3   \n4  IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \n5  FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \n6   \nSOFIA BAHENA ORTUÑO, et al.,  Case No.  20-cv-02064-MMC    \n7 \n \nPlaintiffs, \n8   \nORDER RE: DEFERRED PORTION OF \nv. \n9  PETITIONERS' MOTION FOR \n  TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER; \n10  DAVID JENNINGS, et al.,  DIRECTIONS TO PETITIONERS \nDefendants. \n11 \n   \n a  12   \ntruin\noro 13  On April 8, 2020, the Court issued its order granting in part and denying in part \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  petitioners' Motion, filed March 24, 2020, for a Temporary Restraining Order.  Now before \niD tc 15  the Court is the deferred portion thereof, specifically, petitioners' request that Olvin Said \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Torres Murillo (\"Torres Murillo\") and Mauricio Ernesto Quinteros Lopez (\"Quinteros\") be \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  released from detention.  As to these two petitioners, the parties, with leave of court, \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  have filed supplemental briefs and evidence.  Having read and considered the parties' \nN\n19  respective written submissions, the Court rules as follows. \n20  In its April 8 order, the Court ruled on the motion as to all petitioners other than \n21  Torres Murillo and Quinteros.  (See Doc. No. 38.)  To the extent such order is applicable \n22  to all petitioners, the Court incorporates said order herein. \n23  In that same order, the Court identified and discussed the factors \"pertinent in \n24  assessing the propriety of any injunctive relief.\"  See Winter v. Natural Resources \n25  Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 32 (2008).  This order considers the question of \n26  whether those factors weigh in favor of or against the relief sought on behalf of Torres \n27  Murillo and Quinteros. \n28  // \n\nCase 3:20-cv-02064-MMC   Document 51   Filed 04/14/20   Page 2 of 5\n \n1  Petitioners assert, and respondents do not dispute, that Torres Murillo has \n2  hypertension and has been receiving medication for such condition while detained.  (See \n3  Weisner Decl. ¶¶ 8-10.)  Petitioners also assert, and respondents do not dispute, \n4  Quinteros has hypertension and that respondents have been aware of such condition as \n5  of the date he was detained by ICE.  (See Patel Decl. ¶ 5; Supp. Freeman Decl. Ex. B at \n6  5.)  Although respondents, citing a page of a Centers for Disease Control website, argue \n7  persons with hypertension have not been recognized as being at a higher risk of severe \n8  illness or death if infected with COVID-19, another page of the same website does \n9  include persons with hypertension in that higher-risk group, see \n10  www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html \n11  (listing hypertension as condition \"associated with increased illness severity and adverse \n a  12  outcomes\"), and, as petitioners point out, several medical studies have found persons \ntruin\noro 13  with hypertension are at such higher risk (see Supp. Keller Decl. ¶ 5). \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Accordingly, for the same reasons as were found as to petitioners Salomon \niD tc 15  Medina Calderon, Gennady V. Lavrus, Charles Joseph, and J Elias Solorio Lopez, the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Court finds a clear showing has been made by Torres Murillo and Quinteros as to the \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  four pertinent factors.  Specifically, Torres Murillo and Quinteros have shown (1) they are \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  \"likely to succeed on the merits\" of their Fifth Amendment claim, (2) they are \"likely to \nN\n19  suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief\" from their present conditions \n20  of confinement, (3) the \"balance of equities tips in [their] favor,\" and (4) \"an injunction is in \n21  the public interest.\"  (See Doc. No. 38 at 2:10-13; see also id. at 6:22-8:21.)  \n22  Respondents argue Torres Murillo and Quinteros, for reasons specific to said petitioners, \nnonetheless should not be released.  The Court addresses below the circumstances \n23 \npertaining to these two petitioners. \n24 \nTorres Murillo entered the country lawfully on a T-2 visa more than nine years ago, \n25 \nhas no criminal history, and, at the time of his detention by ICE, was residing lawfully in \n26 \nthe Bay Area with his wife and two children.  See Torres Murillo v. Barr, Civil Case No. \n27 \n19-5676 SK, Doc. No. 16 at 1:19-23; (Weisner Decl. ¶ 6).  The sole basis for his \n28 \n2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-02064-MMC   Document 51   Filed 04/14/20   Page 3 of 5\n \n1  detention is a notice issued by Honduras requesting he be so held.  Although an \n2  immigration judge found the possibility of his involuntary return to Honduras made Torres \n3  Murillo a potential flight risk, the notice was issued over a year and half ago, and \n4  Honduras has taken no steps to seek Torres Murillo's extradition.  (See Second Supp. \n5  Kaiser Decl. ¶ 3.)  Moreover, according to the Department of Justice, the United States \n6  does not consider such notice \"alone to be a sufficient basis for the arrest of a subject \n7  because it does not meet the requirements for arrest under the 4th Amendment to the \n8  Constitution.\"  See https://www.justice.gov/interpol-washington/frequently-asked-\n9  questions. \n10  Quinteros entered the country legally on a six-month tourist visa but remained \n11  after it expired, which extended stay was the basis for his detention.  (See Bonnar Decl. \n a  12  ¶ 13.)  He subsequently was found by an immigration judge to pose a danger to the \ntruin\noro 13  community in light of a single vehicle code violation, which, although as Quinteros \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  conceded, involved his driving a motorcycle at a high rate of speed (see Supp. Freeman \niD tc 15  Decl. Ex. B at 9), is his only encounter with law enforcement during the five years he has \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  been here.  Further, although respondents state Quinteros's name is in an El Salvador \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  gang-membership database (see Second Supp. Bonnar Decl. ¶ 2), the immigration judge \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  found Quinteros was not a gang member (see Supp. Freeman Decl. Ex. B at 14). \nN\nUnder the circumstances, the Court finds respondents' concerns do not warrant \n19 \ndenial of the relief sought by either petitioner. \n20 \n  Accordingly, the Court will grant the deferred portion of the motion, and, as to each \n21 \npetitioner, will include the following conditions in its order of release: \n22 \n  (1) Petitioner is to reside and shelter in place at an address to be specified in said \n23 \norder.1 \n24 \n  (2) Petitioner shall be transported by a person to be specified in said order from \n25 \n26 \n27 \n \n1The address for each petitioner is to be provided by petitioners' counsel. \n28 \n3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-02064-MMC   Document 51   Filed 04/14/20   Page 4 of 5\n \n1  his place of detention to the residence where he will reside and shelter in place.2 \n2    (3) Pending further order of the Court, petitioner shall not leave the residence \n3  where he will shelter in place, except to obtain medical care, to appear at immigration \n4  court proceedings, or to obey any order issued by the Department of Homeland Security. \n5    (4) Petitioner shall not violate any federal, state, or local law. \n6  (5) Petitioner shall comply with the usual conditions of release set forth in ICE's \n7  order of own recognizance, and if petitioner becomes subject to a final order of removal, \n8  he shall comply with the usual conditions of release set forth in ICE's order of \n9  supervision. \n(6) At the election of DHS and/or ICE, petitioner's whereabouts may be monitored \n10 \nby telephonic and/or electronic and/or GPS monitoring. \n11 \n  Additionally, as to Quinteros only, the Court will include a condition prohibiting him \n a  12 \ntruin\noro 13  from driving. \nCf\n tila\ncC CONCLUSION \nirts fo 14 \niD tc 15  For the reasons stated, the deferred portion of petitioners' motion is hereby \n sir\net\ntasiD 16  GRANTED, as follows: \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  1.  To the extent the motion is brought on behalf of petitioners Olvin Said Torres \ne\nh\nt\ninUtro 18  Murillo and Mauricio Ernesto Quinteros Lopez, the motion is hereby GRANTED, and said \nN\npetitioners shall be released upon the filing of an order setting conditions of release, \n19 \nwhich order will be issued following each petitioner's filing of a notice setting forth the \n20 \naddress at which he shall reside and shelter in place, as well as the name of his \n21 \ntransporter. \n22 \n  2.  Respondents are hereby DIRECTED to show cause, no later than April 28, \n23 \n2020, why, as to Olvin Said Torres Murillo and Mauricio Ernesto Quinteros Lopez, a \n24 \npreliminary injunction should not issue.

This action is being filed in the midst of a rapidly evolving global pandemic of frightening \n3  proportions, by immigrants whose continued civil detention by the San Francisco Field Office Defendant \n4  U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (“ICE”) places them at extraordinary risk of infection, illness, \n5  and death.   \n6  2.  The clock is ticking. On March 22, 2020, the number of worldwide diagnoses of the \n7  coronavirus reached 300,000. This is double the number from a week before. The United States has the third \n8  largest number of diagnoses in the world. As of Monday, March 22, there were more than 30,000 diagnosed \n9  cases within the United States, and more than 375 deaths. By the time this Court reads this complaint, there \n10  will be more diagnoses, and more deaths, with no end in sight.  \n11  3.  It is effectively impossible for Plaintiffs to protect themselves against COVID-19 infection in \n12  the two immigration detention centers where ICE is holding them: Mesa Verde ICE Processing Facility \n13  (“Mesa Verde”) and Yuba County Jail (“Yuba”). Each of the Plaintiffs is of advanced age and/or suffers \n14  underlying health conditions which make them particularly vulnerable to severe and rapidly progressing \n15  effects of COVID-19, including death. Yet these Plaintiffs remain detained with the general population in \n16  both facilities, sleeping in bunks within arms-reach of other detainees and with no choice but to use shared \n17  communal dining, bathing, and recreation areas. Facility staff have rebuffed their inquiries about COVID-19 \n18  risks and precautions, and Defendants have rejected their attorneys’ requests for humanitarian release.   \n19  4.  During this global pandemic, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and \n20  other public health experts advise that the only effective means of limiting transmission of the virus are \n21  practicing “social distancing,” with a recommended minimum of six feet between people and reduced \n22  frequency of contact, and maintaining rigorous personal hygiene. People in congregate environments—\n23  places where people live, eat, and sleep in close proximity—face increased risk of contracting COVID-19, as \n24  already evidenced by the rapid spread of the virus in cruise ships and nursing homes. For people such as \n25  Plaintiffs, who are confined in Mesa Verde and Yuba, it is effectively impossible to engage in the social \n26  distancing and hygiene practices necessary to mitigate the risk of transmission.   \n27  5.  The grave threats of the spread of COVID-19, and of a spiraling cascade of illness and deaths, \n28  have convinced public health and government officials worldwide to undertake extraordinary measures. For \n  1 \nPETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AND COMPLAINT \n\n \n \n1  example, within the past week, “shelter in place” orders have been issued throughout the Bay Area, in the \n2  State of California, and in a growing number of jurisdictions nationwide, requiring people to severely limit or \n3  eliminate non-essential activities and to maintain social distancing of at least six feet from other people to the \n4  maximum extent possible. One in four people in the country are now governed by a shelter in place directive. \n5  The land borders with Mexico and Canada have largely been sealed to travel deemed “non-essential.” \n6  6.  Recognizing the urgency of present circumstances, judges, prosecutors and correctional \n7  authorities across the country have been ordering releases to protect individuals and the public health. Such \n8  releases not only protect the people with the greatest vulnerability to serious illness and death COVID-\n9  19 from transmission of the virus, they also contribute to greater risk mitigation for all people in custody or \n10  working in a prison, jail, or detention center, and reduces the burden on the surrounding region’s \n11  limited health care infrastructure, as it lessens the likelihood that an overwhelming number of people will \n12  become seriously ill from COVID-19 at the same time. Many of California’s largest jails have released \n13  people detained in the criminal justice system to protect those people and the community from COVID-19. \n14  Alameda County’s Santa Rita Jail released 300 people. Los Angeles County released over 1,000 people from \n15  its jails. The Kern County Jail, located fifteen minutes from Mesa Verde, has released dozens of detainees. \n16  Law enforcement and jail officials in New Jersey, New York City, Cleveland, Nashville, Houston, San \n17  Antonio, Charlotte, and numerous other jurisdictions are releasing both civil detainees and, in many cases, \n18  people serving sentences for criminal convictions, because of the threat COVID-19 poses inside jails. For \n19  example, on March 22 the New Jersey Supreme Court issued a consent order presumptively ordering the \n20  release of every person serving a county jail sentence by no later than Thursday morning, March 26.1 And \n21  Magistrate Judge Thomas S. Hixson of this Court recently altered the conditions of bail for an individual to \n22  postpone incarceration, after taking into account his risk of vulnerability to the coronavirus. In the Matter of \n23  the Extradition of Alejandro Toledo Manrique, Case No. 19-mj-71055, 2020 WL 1307109, at *1 (N. D. Cal. \n24  March 19, 2020). \n25  7.  ICE’s response to the threats the pandemic poses to immigrants, by contrast, has been \n26  abysmal and haphazard. As Californians began to shelter in their homes in compliance with public health \n27 \n \n28  1 Consent Order, In the Matter of the Request to Commute or Suspend County Jail Sentences, No. 084230 (N.J. March 22, \n2020) available at https://www.aclu-nj.org/files/5415/8496/4744/2020.03.22_-_Consent_Order_Filed_Stamped_Copy-1.pdf. \n  2 \nPETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AND COMPLAINT \n\n \n \n1  directives to practice social distancing on Monday, March 16, ICE’s Los Angeles Field Office executed pre-\n2  dawn raids to cram even more immigrants into detention centers. The Field Office Director stated to the L.A. \n3  Times: “We couldn’t factor this in, right? This COVID-19 and the precautions that everybody’s taking . . . . \n4  We just have to continue to go with the same game plan that we’ve been doing.”2 Following public outcry, \n5  the next day ICE issued a statement that it would modify its enforcement efforts in apparent recognition of \n6  the need for alternatives to detention to protect public health.3 The day after, however, in response to a \n7  lawsuit for the release of vulnerable ICE detainees, the agency again demonstrated its failure to appreciate \n8  the threats the COVID-19 pandemic presents, asserting that “Plaintiffs’ assertion that detention per se poses \n9  an increased risk of health complications or death from COVID-19 is purely speculative.”4 ICE’s head-in-\n10  the-sand response to the threats of this pandemic will prove deadly to immigrant detainees if it is not \n11  remedied through this Court’s intervention.  \n12  8.  The following day, Thursday, March 19, 2020, two medical subject matter experts for the \n13  Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties blew the whistle to Congress, \n14  writing “regarding the need to implement immediate social distancing to reduce the likelihood of exposure to \n15  detainees, facility personnel, and the general public, it is essential to consider releasing all detainees who do \n16  not pose an immediate risk to public safety.”5 On multiple occasions since at least February 25, 2020, these \n17  experts had sounded the alarm within the agency on the imminent risks to the health of immigrant detainees \n18  and the public at large presented by COVID-19 unless swift mitigation measures, including decreasing the \n19  number of immigrant detainees, are taken.  \n20  9.  Inside the facilities, moreover, immigrants say that ICE is not consistently taking even the less \n21  aggressive precautionary measures the agency claims it is taking. To take one critical example, ICE is \n22  introducing daily new detainees in with the general population without any mandatory quarantine period. \n23  This echoes a concern of the two DHS experts, who say that “the track record of ICE facilities implementing \n24  [early screening, testing, isolation and quarantine] protocols historically has been inconsistent.” Moreover, \n25   \n2 https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-17/for-ice-agents-its-business-as-unusual-day-after-sweeping-coronavirus-\n26  order \n3 https://www.ice.gov/covid19. \n27  4 Respondents—Defendants’ Opposition at 8, Dawson v. Asher, ECF No. 28, Case No. 20-0409 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 18, 2020). \n5 Letter from Scott A. Allen, MD and Josiah Rich, MD, MPH to Congressional Committee Chairpersons, dated Mar. 19, 2020, \n28  available at https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6816336/032020-Letter-From-Drs-Allen-Rich-to-Congress-Re.pdf \n(emphasis in original). \n  3 \nPETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AND COMPLAINT \n\n \n \n1  even if ICE was consistently taking these precautions, the DHS experts have explained that they “won’t be \n2  enough” without rapidly “releas[ing] those who do not pose an immediate danger to public safety.”6 \n3  Defendants stubbornly refuse to heed the advice of public health experts, including their own.  \n4  10.  Plaintiffs, like all civil immigration detainees, are not being detained pursuant to a conviction \n5  of any offense. Although some of the Plaintiffs have prior criminal histories, they have completed their \n6  sentences. Rather, they are currently in civil detention because they are awaiting the completion of their \n7  immigration proceedings.   \n8  11.  ICE has significant discretion to release immigration detainees, see 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), and \n9  has a long-standing practice of releasing for humanitarian reasons even those whose detention has been \n10  mandated under particular immigration detention statutes, see 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(d)(5); 1225(b); 1226(c). \n11  According to John Sandweg, a former acting head of ICE, “[t]he overwhelming majority of people in ICE \n12  detention don’t pose a threat to public safety and are not an unmanageable flight risk.”7 ICE also regularly \n13  uses alternatives to detention, such as electronic ankle monitors and telephonic monitoring, under appropriate \n14  circumstances.   \n15  12.  Even where a statute mandates a person’s detention, it is settled law that ICE cannot detain a \n16  person if that application of the statute violates the Constitution. Defendants cannot justify continuing to \n17  subject Plaintiffs to extraordinary risk of illness and death with any legitimate government objective, \n18  particularly in light of the alternatives available to them. The danger posed by Plaintiffs’ detention during the \n19  current outbreak of COVID-19 is “so grave that it violates contemporary standards of decency to \n20  expose anyone unwillingly to such a risk” and violates their constitutional right to safety in \n21  government custody. Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 36 (1993). Plaintiffs bring this action to remedy \n22  grave violations of their constitutional rights that imminently threaten them with serious illness and death.   \n23  13.  Unless this Court intervenes to order the release of the Plaintiffs, they, along with many other \n24  detained individuals, will face dramatically increased chances of contracting COVID-19, becoming seriously \n25  ill, and dying.   \n26   \n6 See, “We must release prisoners to lessen the spread of coronavirus,” Washington Post \n27  https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/17/we-must-release-prisoners-lessen-spread-coronavirus/. \n7  Camilo Montoya-Galvez, Powder Kegs: Calls Grow for ICE to Release Immigrants to Avoid Coronavirus Outbreak, CBS News, \n28  Mar. 19, 2020, https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/coronavirus-ice-release-immigrants-detention-\noutbreak/?__twitter_impression=true.   \n  4 \nPETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AND COMPLAINT \n\n \n \nPARTIES \n1 \nPlaintiffs \n2 \n14.

Respondent-Defendant David Jennings is the Acting Field Officer Director for the San \n18  Francisco Field Office of ICE and maintains his office in San Francisco, California, within this judicial \n19  district. The San Francisco Field Office is responsible for carrying out ICE’s immigration detention \n20  operations at Mesa Verde and Yuba. Defendant Jennings is a legal custodian of Plaintiffs. He is sued in his \n21  official capacity. \n22  29.  Respondent-Defendant Matthew T. Albence is the Deputy Director and Senior Official \n23  Performing the Duties of the Director of ICE. Defendant Albence is responsible for ICE’s policies, practices, \n24  and procedures, including those relating to the detention of immigrants. Defendant Albence is a legal \n25  custodian of Plaintiffs. He is sued in his official capacity. \n26  30.  Respondent-Defendant ICE is a federal law enforcement agency within the Department of \n27  Homeland Security. ICE is responsible for the criminal and civil enforcement of immigration laws, including \n28 \n  7 \nPETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AND COMPLAINT \n\n \n \n1  the detention and removal of immigrants. Enforcement and Removal Operations (“ERO”), a division of ICE, \n2  manages and oversees the immigration detention system. Defendant ICE is a legal custodian of Plaintiffs.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n3 \n4  31.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal \n5  question), 28 U.S.C. § 1346 (original jurisdiction), 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02 (declaratory relief); 28 U.S.C. § \n6  2241 (habeas jurisdiction), and Article I, Section 9, clause 2 of the United States Constitution (the \n7  Suspension Clause).  \n8  32.  The United States has waived sovereign immunity for this action for declaratory and \n9  injunctive relief against one of its agencies and that agency’s officers are sued in their official capacities. See \n10  5 U.S.C. § 702.  \n11  33.  Venue lies in this judicial district, under 28 U.S.C. § 1391, as venue is proper in any district in \n12  which a defendant resides. Venue also is proper in the Northern District of California because Defendants are \n13  officers or employees of the United States and a Defendant resides in this District, see 28 U.S.C. \n14  §1391(e)(1)(A). \nINTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n15 \n16  34.  Pursuant to Civil L. R. 3-2(c), this case is properly assigned to the San Francisco Division of \n17  this Court because the action arises in the City and County of San Francisco.  \nADDITIONAL FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n18 \n19  COVID-19 Poses Grave Risk of Harm, Including Serious Illness or Death \n20  35.  COVID-19 is a virus that has reached pandemic status. Because COVID-19 is easily \n21  transmitted, and because testing is increasingly available, the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths are \n22  expected to grow exponentially in the near term.  \n23  36.  All human beings share an equal risk of contracting and, upon contraction, transmitting the \n24  virus that causes COVID-19. Any adult who contracts the virus may experience life-threatening symptoms. \n25  However, people over the age of fifty and those with certain medical conditions face greater chances of \n26  serious illness or death from COVID-19. Certain underlying medical conditions increase the risk of serious \n27  COVID-19 disease for people of any age, including lung disease, heart disease, hypertension, chronic liver or \n28  kidney disease (including hepatitis and dialysis patients), diabetes, epilepsy, hypertension, compromised \n  8 \nPETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AND COMPLAINT \n\n \n \n1  immune systems (such as from cancer, HIV, or an autoimmune disease), blood disorders (including sickle \n2  cell disease), inherited metabolic disorders, stroke, developmental delay, and pregnancy. New information \n3  regarding COVID-19 risk factors is coming out daily. Other categories of individuals may have conditions \n4  that predispose them to complications from COVID-19, but are not yet identified by the medical literature. \n5  37.  The COVID-19 virus can severely damage lung tissue, which requires an extensive period of \n6  rehabilitation, and in some cases, can cause a permanent loss of respiratory capacity. COVID-19 may also \n7  target the heart muscle, causing a medical condition called myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle. \n8  Myocarditis can affect the heart muscle and electrical system, reducing the heart’s ability to pump. This \n9  reduction can lead to rapid or abnormal heart rhythms in the short term, and long-term heart failure that \n10  limits exercise tolerance and the ability to work. People of all ages and medical backgrounds who have \n11  experienced serious cases of COVID-19 describe painful symptoms including vomiting, severe diarrhea, \n12  relentless shivering, and suffocating shortness of breath. \n13  38.  Emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 can also trigger an over-response of the immune \n14  system, further damaging tissues in a cytokine release syndrome that can result in widespread damage to \n15  other organs, including permanent injury to the kidneys and neurologic injury. \n16  39.  These complications can manifest at an alarming pace. Individuals can show the first \n17  symptoms of COVID-19 infection in as little as two days after exposure, and their condition can seriously \n18  deteriorate in as little as five days or sooner. People can also spread COVID-19 but be asymptomatic. \n19  40.  Most people who develop serious disease will need advanced support. This level of supportive \n20  care requires highly specialized equipment that is in limited supply, and an entire team of care providers, \n21  including 1:1 or 1:2 nurse to patient ratios, respiratory therapists, and intensive care physicians. This level of \n22  support can quickly exceed local health care resources. \n23  41.  The need for care, including intensive care, and the likelihood of death, is much higher from \n24  COVID-19 infection than from influenza. According to recent estimates, the fatality rate of people infected \n25  with COVID-19 is about ten times higher than a severe seasonal influenza, even in advanced countries with \n26  highly effective health care systems. For people in the highest risk populations, the fatality rate of COVID-19 \n27  infection is about 15 percent—ten times the average rate. Preliminary data from China showed that 20 \n28  percent of people in high-risk categories who have contracted COVID-19 there have died. \n  9 \nPETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AND COMPLAINT \n\n \n \n1  42.  People who experience serious cases of COVID-19 who do not die from COVID-19 should \n2  expect a prolonged recovery, including the need for extensive rehabilitation for profound reconditioning, loss \n3  of digits, neurologic damage, and the loss of respiratory capacity.  \n4  43.  There is no vaccine against COVID-19, nor is there any known medication to prevent or treat \n5  infection. The only known effective measures to reduce the risk for vulnerable people from injury or death \n6  from COVID-19 are to prevent them from being infected in the first place, and to limit community spread. \n7  Social distancing or remaining physically separated from known or potentially infected individuals, and \n8  vigilant sanitation and hygiene, including repeatedly and thoroughly washing hands with soap and water, are \n9  the only known effective measures for protecting vulnerable people from COVID-19.  \n10  44.  Nationally, projections by the CDC indicate that over 200 million people in the United States \n11  could be infected with COVID-19 over the course of the epidemic without effective public health \n12  intervention, with as many as 1.5 million deaths in the most severe projections.  \n13  45.  In recent days, the number of reported cases of infection in many parts of the country have \n14  shown a frightening increase, and numerous media outlets and public officials estimate that the reported \n15  number of deaths could soon follow suit.  \n16  People Detained at Mesa Verde and Yuba Face an Elevated Risk of COVID-19 Transmission. \n17 \n46.  In institutional settings such as immigration detention centers, people who are over the age of \n18 \n50, or who have medical conditions that put them at high risk of illness if infected by COVID-19, are at \n19 \ngrave risk of severe illness and death. Immigration detention facilities are “congregate environments,” or \n20 \nplaces where people live and sleep in close proximity. Infectious diseases that are communicated by air or \n21 \ntouch are more likely to spread in these environments.  This presents an increased danger for the spread of \n22 \nCOVID-19 if and when it is introduced into a facility. This is why enclosed group environments, like cruise \n23 \nships or nursing homes, have become the sites for the most severe outbreaks of COVID-19.  \n24 \n47.  The conditions of immigration detention facilities pose a heightened public health risk for the \n25 \nspread of COVID-19 that is even greater than in non-carceral institutions. Immigration detention facilities \n26 \nhave even greater risk of infectious spread because of crowding, the proportion of vulnerable people \n27 \ndetained, and often scant medical care resources. People live in close quarters and as a result, cannot achieve \n28 \n  10 \nPETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AND COMPLAINT \n\n \n \n1  the social distancing needed to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19. They may be unable to maintain \n2  the recommended distance of 6 feet from others and may share or touch objects used by others.  \n3  48.  For Plaintiffs, it is near impossible for them and others detained in Yuba and Mesa Verde to \n4  practice social distancing. Most sleep in barracks-style cells with dozens of others only a few feet away. \n5  They endure inadequate hygiene and sanitation which raises the risk of infection and an outbreak. Toilets, \n6  sinks, showers are shared, without disinfection between each use. Detainees report frequently not being \n7  provided soap, or having to share a single bar of soap among many people, and having to wash their soiled \n8  laundry in the shower. Food preparation and service is communal with little opportunity for surface \n9  disinfection. Staff arrive and leave on a shift basis, new detainees are introduced into the environment daily \n10  without quarantine, and there is limited ability, and little effort, to adequately screen staff, contractors, and \n11  visitors for new, asymptomatic infection. \n12  49.  To make matters worse, immigration detention facilities lack adequate medical infrastructure \n13  to address the spread of infectious disease and treatment of people most vulnerable to illness in detention. \n14  During the H1N1 influenza epidemic in 2009, jails and prisons were sites of severe outbreaks. It is \n15  reasonable to expect COVID-19 will also readily spread in detention centers, especially when people cannot \n16  engage in proper hygiene and isolate themselves from infected residents or staff.  \n17  50.  Detention centers are integral components of the public health systems in the communities in \n18  which they are located. If many contract COVID-19 in such a facility they will require hospitalization in the \n19  community, threatening to overwhelm the community’s resources. This problem is particularly acute in rural \n20  communities, such as Bakersfield and Marysville, California, in which Mesa Verde and Yuba are situated. In \n21  the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in either Mesa Verde or Yuba, the surrounding communities would be \n22  unable to provide adequate medical treatment to infected persons.   \n23  Population Reduction Through Release, Prioritizing the Release of Those Most Vulnerable to Severe \nCases of COVID-19, Will Reduce the Risk of a COVID-19 Outbreak in Mesa Verde and Yuba. \n24 \n25  51.  Because risk mitigation is the only known strategy that can protect vulnerable groups from \n26  COVID-19, and ICE has demonstrated over and over again that it is both unwilling and unable to implement \n27  meaningful risk mitigation measures. Accordingly, public health experts with experience in immigration \n28 \n  11 \nPETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AND COMPLAINT \n\n \n \n1  detention and correctional settings have recommended that detention centers immediately reduce their \n2  populations, beginning with the release of detainees most vulnerable to severe cases of COVID-19.  \n3  52.  Dr. Marc Stern, a correctional health expert, has concluded that “[f]or detainees who are at \n4  high risk of serious illness or death should they contract the COVID-19 virus, release from detention is a \n5  critically important way to meaningfully mitigate that risk.” For that reason, Dr. Stern has recommended \n6  broad release, beginning with the “release of eligible individuals from detention, with priority given to the \n7  elderly and those with underlying medical conditions most vulnerable to serious illness or death if infected \n8  with COVID-19.”  \n9  53.  Dr. Robert Greifinger, a correctional health expert, has concluded that “even with the best-laid \n10  plans to address the spread of COVID-19 in detention facilities, release is a key part of a risk mitigation \n11  strategy. Accordingly, “[i]n [his] opinion, the public health recommendation is to release high-risk people \n12  from detention, given the heightened risks to their health and safety, especially given the lack of a viable \n13  vaccine for prevention or effective treatment at this stage.” \n14  54.  On the basis of information he has reviewed, Dr. Stern recommends immediate consideration \n15  of downsizing of Mesa Verde and Yuba, with priority given to those in high risk of harm due to their age and \n16  health status. He further recommends that these two facilities begin planning now to downsize further as \n17  conditions change. In Dr. Stern’s view, downsizing has a number of valuable effects on public health and \n18  public safety, and is the only measure that can effectively protect the health and safety of the people who \n19  remain in detention. It allows for social distancing; it allows easier provision of preventive measures such as \n20  soap for handwashing, cleaning supplies for surfaces, and more frequent laundering and showering; and \n21  reduces the overall workload of detention staff so that they can focus on continuing to ensure the safety of \n22  detainees. \n23  55.  Dr. Stern has also concluded that the release of detainees serves the broader community \n24  because detention centers are integral parts of a community public health infrastructure. Reducing the spread \n25  and severity of infection in such a center slows, if not reduces, the number of people who will become ill \n26  enough to require hospitalization, which in turn reduces the health and economic burden to the local \n27  community. \n28 \n  12 \nPETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AND COMPLAINT \n\n \n \n1  56.  For at least the past month, the Department of Homeland Security’s own medical experts, who \n2  have personally investigated numerous detention facilities, have sounded the alarm on the imminent risks to \n3  the health of immigrant detainees and the public at large presented by COVID-19 unless swift mitigation \n4  measures, including decreasing the number of immigrant detainees, are taken. Alarmed by ICE’s failure to \n5  take appropriate action, these experts, each of whom has a served in senior capacities within the DHS, \n6  became whistleblowers, writing to Congress, “regarding the need to implement social distancing to reduce \n7  the likelihood of exposure to detainees, facility personnel, and the general public, it is essential to consider \n8  releasing all detainees who do not pose an immediate risk to public safety.”8 They also made their concerns \n9  public in an op-ed, explaining that screening incoming detainees and isolating groups exposed to the virus \n10  “won’t be enough” without rapidly “releas[ing] those who do not pose an immediate danger to public \n11  safety.”9 \n12  57.  In the event that a scenario unfolds where vulnerable detainees have already been exposed to \n13  COVID-19, the DHS experts recommend the release of detainees to a quarantine setting outside of detention \n14  in coordination with local health authorities. Dr. Sandra Hernandez, a public health expert, has identified \n15  such release as consistent with the public health and the guidance and directives of state and local public \n16  health authorities.  \nLEGAL FRAMEWORK \n17 \n18 \nPlaintiffs Have a Constitutional Right to Reasonable Safety in Custody. \n19 \n58.  Whenever the government detains or incarcerates someone, it has an affirmative duty to \n20 \nprovide conditions of reasonable health and safety. As the Supreme Court has explained, “when the State \n21 \ntakes a person into its custody and holds him there against his will, the Constitution imposes upon it a \n22 \ncorresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety and general well-being.” DeShaney v. \n23 \nWinnebago County Dept. of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 199-200 (1989). As a result, the government must \n24 \nprovide those in its custody with “food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and reasonable safety.” Id. at 200.  \n25 \n26   \n8 Letter from Scott A. Allen, MD and Josiah Rich, MD, MPH to Congressional Committee Chairpersons, dated Mar. 19, 2020, \n27  available at https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6816336/032020-Letter-From-Drs-Allen-Rich-to-Congress-Re.pdf \n(emphasis in original). \n28  9 See, “We must release prisoners to lessen the spread of coronavirus,” Washington Post \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/17/we-must-release-prisoners-lessen-spread-coronavirus/. \n  13 \nPETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AND COMPLAINT \n\n \n \n1  59.  Conditions that pose an unreasonable risk of future harm violate the Eighth Amendment’s \n2  prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, even if that harm has not yet come to pass. The Eighth \n3  Amendment requires that “inmates be furnished with the basic human needs, one of which is ‘reasonable \n4  safety.’” Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. at 33 (quoting DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 200). Accordingly, “[i]t would \n5  be odd to deny an injunction to inmates who plainly proved an unsafe, life-threatening condition in their \n6  prison on the ground that nothing yet had happened to them.” Id. \n7  60.  The Supreme Court has explicitly recognized that the risk of contracting a communicable \n8  disease may constitute such an “unsafe, life-threatening condition” that threatens “reasonable safety.” Id. The \n9  Supreme Court also has instructed courts to consider “contemporary standards of decency” when evaluating \n10  conditions of confinement. Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 36 (1993). \n11  61.  The constitutional protections afforded to immigration detainees are more comprehensive than \n12  those afforded to criminal defendants. Immigrant detainees, even those with prior criminal convictions, \n13  are civil detainees held pursuant to civil immigration laws. Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690 (2001). \n14  Even those who in the past were convicted of crimes are solely being detained pursuant to their immigration \n15  status, having completed their criminal sentences. Because detained immigrants are civil detainees, their \n16  constitutional protections while in custody are derived from the Fifth Amendment. The Eighth Amendment \n17  prohibits punishment that is “cruel and unusual,” whereas the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \n18  prohibits any punishment at all.  \n19  62.  The Ninth Circuit has applied this principle to make clear that civil detainees, like Plaintiffs \n20  here, are entitled to conditions of confinement that are superior to those of convicted prisoners and to those \n21  of criminal pretrial detainees. Jones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918, 933-34 (9th Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. \n22  820 (2005); see also King v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, 885 F.3d 548, 557 (9th Cir. 2018) (finding presumption of \n23  punitive, and thus unconstitutional, treatment where conditions of confinement for civil detainees are similar \n24  to those faced by pre-trial criminal detainees). Conditions of confinement violate this standard when they \n25  deprive people in civil custody of a basic human need, including safety, and the risk of deprivation cannot be \n26  justified by a legitimate governmental interest or is excessive despite a legitimate governmental interest.   \n27  63.  The risk that Plaintiffs fear—that the unsafe conditions in Mesa Verde and Yuba cause them \n28  to actually contract COVID-19, and that they will face a heightened risk of morbidity or mortality—does not \n  14 \nPETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AND COMPLAINT \n\n \n \n1  need to become a reality for there to be a violation of their constitutional rights. A Due Process violation may \n2  arise, and a court may fashion remedies even before a plaintiff has contracted a communicable disease or \n3  such disease has spread within a facility. See Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993); Lareau v. \n4  Manson, 651 F.2d 96, 105 (2d Cir. 1981); Hernandez v. Cnty. of Monterey, 110 F.Supp.3d 929, 957 (N.D. \n5  Cal. 2015) (finding need for injunction where civil detainees kept at “heightened risk of contracting” a \n6  communicable disease). \n7  ICE Has the Authority to Release Detained People in Its Custody.  \n8  64.  It is well within ICE’s authority to comply with these constitutional requirements by releasing \n9  people to remedy the conditions of confinement in Mesa Verde and Yuba that put Plaintiffs and others \n10  detained there at an unreasonably high risk of contracting COVID-19. In fact, ICE has routinely exercised \n11  this discretion to release particularly vulnerable detainees like Plaintiffs. As former Deputy Assistant \n12  Director for Custody Programs in ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Andrew Lorenzen-Strait has \n13  stated, “ICE has exercised and still exercises discretion for purposes of releasing individuals with serious \n14  medical conditions from detention.” In fact, “ICE exercises humanitarian parole authority all the time for \n15  serious medical reasons.” This exercise of discretion comes from a long line of agency directives explicitly \n16  instructing officers to exercise favorable discretion in cases involving severe medical concerns and other \n17  humanitarian equities militating against detention. \n18  65.  ICE’s discretion applies regardless of the statutory basis for a noncitizen’s detention.  \n19  66.  When conditions of confinement in an immigration detention facility lead to uniformly unsafe \n20  conditions that rise to the level of a constitutional violation, the only available remedy is to reduce levels of \n21  detention unless and until conditions can be brought in line with constitutional standards. For example, in a \n22  recent case challenging conditions of confinement in Border Patrol detention facilities along the Arizona \n23  border, Judge David C. Bury ordered that the Constitution prohibited Border Patrol from continuing to detain \n24  any person to whom it did not provide a bed, shower, nutritious food, and a screening by a medical \n25  professional within 48 hours of book-in. Unknown Parties v. Nielsen, CV-15-00250-TUC-DCB, 2020 WL \n26  813774, *1 (D. Az. Feb. 19, 2020). \n27 \n28 \n  15 \nPETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AND COMPLAINT \n\n \n \n \n1  This Court Has Authority to Order Plaintiffs’ Release to Vindicate Their Fifth Amendment Rights, \nand Such Relief Is Appropriate Here. \n2 \n3  67.  While the circumstances of this case are novel and emerging, the Court’s authority to order \n4  Plaintiffs’ release to ensure their constitutional rights are protected is not.  “Federal courts possess whatever \n5  powers are necessary to remedy constitutional violations because they are charged with protecting these \n6  rights.” Stone v. City & Cnty. of San Francisco, 968 F.2d 850, 861 (9th Cir. 1992). As a result, “[w]hen \n7  necessary to ensure compliance with a constitutional mandate, courts may enter orders placing limits on a \n8  prison’s population.” Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 511 (2011). \n9  68.  Courts have regularly exercised this authority to remedy constitutional violations caused by \n10  overcrowding. Duran v. Elrod, 713 F.2d 292, 297-98 (7th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1108 (1984) \n11  (concluding that court did not exceed its authority in directing release of low-bond pretrial detainees as \n12  necessary to reach a population cap). \n13  69.  The same principle applies here.  As the constitutional principles and public health experts \n14  make clear, releasing Plaintiffs is the only viable remedy to ensure their safety from the threat to their health \n15  that COVID-19 poses. Plaintiffs are older adults and/or people with medical conditions who are at \n16  particularly grave risk of severe illness or death if they contract COVID-19. \n17  70.  In the face of this great threat, social distancing and hygiene measures are Plaintiffs’ only \n18  defense against COVID-19. Those protective measures are exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, in the \n19  environment of an immigration detention center, where Plaintiffs share toilets, sinks, and showers, eat in \n20  communal spaces, and are in close contact with the many other detainees and officers around them. These \n21  conditions pose even greater risk of infectious spread, and as a result, Plaintiffs face unreasonable harm from \n22  continued detention. It is also well documented that even in “normal” times, ICE has been ineffective in \n23  ceasing the spread of communicable diseases within detention centers. And, these are not normal times. \n24  INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF ALLEGATIONS \n25  71.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege the allegations contained in all preceding paragraphs as though \n26  fully set forth herein. \n27  72.  An actual and substantial controversy exists between Plaintiffs and Defendants regarding their \n28  respective legal rights and duties. Plaintiffs contend that Defendants have violated Plaintiffs’ constitutional \n  16 \nPETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AND COMPLAINT \n\n \n \n1  rights as alleged above. Defendants deny that their conduct violates any such rights and intend to continue \n2  such conduct. \n3  73.  Moreover, in view of Defendants’ policies and practices, Plaintiffs are threatened with \n4  continuing and future deprivations of their rights.  \n5  74.  Defendants’ conduct as alleged above has caused and, absent injunctive relief or a writ of \n6  habeas corpus, will continue to cause irreparable harm to Plaintiffs by exposing Plaintiffs to unacceptably \n7  increased risk of irreparable harm, including serious injury and death. In the absence of immediate relief, \n8  Plaintiffs will continue to be deprived of these rights.  \n9  75.  There is no adequate remedy at law for the continuing violations by Defendants of Class \n10  members’ constitutional and statutory rights. \n11  CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n12  Violation of Fifth Amendment Right to Substantive Due Process (Unlawful Punishment; Freedom \nfrom Cruel Treatment and Conditions of Confinement) \n13 \n14  76.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege the allegations contained in all preceding paragraphs as though \n15  fully set forth herein.  \n16  77.  The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees that civil detainees, including all \n17  immigrant detainees, may not be subjected to punishment. The federal government violates this substantive \n18  due process right when it subjects civil detainees to conditions of confinement that amount to punishment or \n19  create an unreasonable risk to detainees’ safety and health. \n20  78.  Defendants’ conditions of confinement subject Plaintiffs to heightened risk of contracting \n21  COVID-19, for which there is no vaccine, known treatment, or cure. Defendants are subjecting Plaintiffs to a \n22  substantial risk of serious harm.   \n23  79.  For these reasons, Defendants’ ongoing detention of Plaintiffs constitutes punishment and \n24  violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. \n25   \n26   \n27   \n28 \n  17 \nPETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AND COMPLAINT \n\n \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n1 \n  WHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs respectfully ask this Court to grant the following relief:  \n2 \n1.  Issue a Writ of Habeas Corpus and order the immediate release of Plaintiffs, with appropriate \n3 \nprecautionary public health measures, on the ground that their continued detention violates the \n4 \nDue Process Clause; \n5 \n2.  In the alternative, issue injunctive relief ordering Defendants to immediately release Plaintiffs, \n6 \nwith appropriate precautionary public health measures, on the grounds that their continued \n7 \ndetention violates the Due Process Clause;  \n8 \n3.  Issue a declaration that the conditions under which Plaintiffs and others are confined at Mesa \n9 \nVerde and Yuba place Plaintiffs at an unreasonable risk of contracting serious illness and \n10 \ndeath, in violation of the Due Process Clause; \n11 \n4.  Award Plaintiffs reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, and other disbursements in this action \n12 \npermitted under the Equal Access to Justice Act (“EAJA”), as amended, 5 U.S.C. § 504 and \n13 \n28 U.S.C. § 2412, and on any other basis justified under law; and \n14 \n5.  Grant any and all other such relief that this Court deems just and equitable. \n15 \n \n16  Dated: March 24, 2020  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n17 \n  /s/ William S. Freeman   \n  William S.

Having read and \niD tc 15  considered the motion, the Court rules as follows. \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  In an order filed April 8, 2020, the Court granted in part and denied in part \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  petitioners' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order.  By the instant motion, petitioners \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  seek leave to file a motion for reconsideration of said order to the extent the order denied \nN\n19  relief to petitioners Ricardo Vasquez Cruz (\"Vasquez Cruz\"), Julio Cesar Buendia Alas \n20  (\"Buendia Alas\"), and Marco Montoya Amaya (\"Montoya\"). \n21  In support of their proposed motion for reconsideration, petitioners have filed new \n22  evidence, in particular, a declaration by a physician who reviewed medical records \n23  available for each of the above-referenced three petitioners, which declaration, \n24  petitioners assert, demonstrates that each of those petitioners has at least one health \n25  condition that places him at a high risk of contracting a severe illness if infected by \n26  COVID-19. \n27    Under the Local Rules of this District, a party seeking reconsideration of an \n28  interlocutory order must show (1) \"a material difference in fact or law exists from that \n\nCase 3:20-cv-02064-MMC   Document 60   Filed 04/20/20   Page 2 of 2\n \n1  which was presented to the Court before entry of the interlocutory order\" and that \"in the \n2  exercise of reasonable diligence the party applying for reconsideration did not know such \n3  fact or law at the time of the interlocutory order\"; (2) \"[t]he emergence of new material \n4  facts or a change in law occurring after the time of such order\"; or (3) \"[a] manifest failure \n5  by the Court to consider material facts or dispositive legal arguments which were \n6  presented to the Court before such interlocutory order.\"  See Civil L. R. 7-9(b). \n7  Here, petitioners rely on the first two of the above-cited circumstances.  \n8  Petitioners, however, have not shown the subject medical records did not exist prior to \n9  the date on which petitioners filed their Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order, nor \n10  have they shown those records could not have been obtained prior to such date. \n11  Accordingly, the Motion for Leave to File a Motion for Reconsideration is hereby \n  12  DENIED, without prejudice to the filing of a motion for a preliminary injunction.  In any \n a\ntruin\noro 13  such motion, petitioners are advised to address, in addition to the medical issues,1 the \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  question of whether the conditions existing in the detention facilities have changed, and, \niD tc 15  in light of adverse findings made, as to Vasquez Cruz and Montoya, by an immigration \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  judge (see Kaiser Decl. ¶ 13; Bonnar Decl. ¶ 15), and, as to Buendia Alas, by \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (see Bonnar Decl. ¶ 12), whether release of the \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  above-referenced petitioners is in the public interest. \nN\n19  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n20   \n21  Dated: April 20, 2020     \n  MAXINE M.

Chen, 735 F. Supp. 2d 1226, 1228 (D. Nev. 2010).  \n10  \"A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on \nthe merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, \n11 \nthat the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public \n  12 \n a\ntruin\noro 13  interest.\"  Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  \nCf\n tila\ncC Additionally, where, as here, a plaintiff seeks a mandatory injunction, the plaintiff, to \nirts fo 14 \niD tc 15  establish the first factor, must show a \"clear likelihood of success on the merits.\"  See \n sir\net\ntasiD 16  Stanley v. University of Southern California, 13 F.3d 1313, 1316 (9th Cir. 1994). \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  DISCUSSION \ne\nh\nt\ninUtro 18    The world is currently experiencing a global pandemic in light of the coronavirus \nN\nCOVID-19.  As of today's date, more than 419,000 persons in the United States have \n19 \nbecome infected with COVID-19, more than 14,250 persons have died, and there is no \n20 \nindication the pandemic has reached its peak. \n21 \nIn a very short period of time, and particularly in the past month, COVID-19 has \n22 \nbrought dramatic changes to the country, including the State of California's issuance of \n23 \nan order directing all persons living in the state to \"stay home\" and to \"at all times practice \n24 \n25 \n \n2Although petitioners Sofia Bahena Ortuño and Roxana del Carmen Trigueros \n26 \nAcevedo were, at the time the motion was filed, being detained at Mesa Verde, both said \npetitioners subsequently were released.  (See Defs.' Opp. at 5:23-24; Supp. Bonnar Decl. \n27 \n¶ 5.)  Accordingly, to the extent the motion is brought on their behalf, it will be denied as \nmoot. \n28 \n2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-02064-MMC   Document 38   Filed 04/08/20   Page 3 of 10\n \n1  social distancing.\"  See Cal. Executive Order N-33-20.  The Centers for Disease Control \n2  and Prevention (\"CDC\") likewise has advised all person to \"stay home as much as \n3  possible,\" to \"take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others,\" \n4  and to \"avoid crowds as much as possible,\" noting that the \"risk of exposure . . . may \n5  increase in crowded, closed-in settings with little air circulation.\"  See \n6  www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/get-ready.html. \n7    Although there is no indication, at least in the record before the Court, that any \n8  particular person or type of person is more susceptible to becoming infected with COVID-\n9  19, the CDC has determined that certain types of persons who do became infected are \nsignificantly more likely to have a severe illness or to die, including persons who are 65 \n10 \nyears of age or older, and those who have certain medical conditions, such as moderate \n11 \nto severe asthma, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, liver disease and hypertension.  See \n  12 \n a\ntruin\noro 13  www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html; \nCf\n tila\ncC www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html. \nirts fo 14 \niD tc 15    Petitioners argue that each of them has one or more of the above-described high-\n sir\net\ntasiD 16  risk factors, and that they are unable to engage in social distancing and to take other \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  steps to avoid infection.  Under such circumstances, they seek release from detention \ne\nh\nt\nintr until the pandemic is over. \nUo 18 \nN\n  In opposing the motion, respondents make two threshold arguments, specifically, \n19 \n(1) that petitioners lack Article III standing and (2) that a claim challenging conditions of \n20 \nconfinement cannot be brought under § 2241. \n21 \nWith respect to standing, respondents argue, in essence, that no petitioner \n22 \npresently has COVID-19 and that any petitioner's likelihood of becoming infected is \n23 \nspeculative.  COVID-19 infections, however, are rapidly increasing in the United States, \n24 \nincluding California, and, when introduced into a confined space, such as a nursing \n25 \nhome, a cruise ship, and, recently, a naval aircraft carrier, it can rapidly spread.  Indeed, \n26 \nit has quickly spread in a number of jails and prisons.  (See Wells Decl. Exs. C-E.)  Under \n27 \nsuch circumstances, the Court finds petitioners have standing to assert their claims. \n28 \n3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-02064-MMC   Document 38   Filed 04/08/20   Page 4 of 10\n \n1  Turning to petitioner's reliance on § 2241, which provides district courts with the \n2  power to issue writs of habeas corpus to persons being held in the custody of the United \n3  States, the Court notes that the Ninth Circuit, as early as 1974, has found it \"fairly well \n4  established\" that \"federal habeas corpus actions are now available to deal with questions \n5  concerning both the duration and the conditions of confinement.\"  See Workman v. \n6  Mitchell, 502 F.2d 1201, 1208 n.9 (9th Cir. 1974).  Respondents have not cited any later \n7  case holding to the contrary.  Accordingly, the Court finds petitioners may seek, pursuant \n8  to § 2241, relief from what they allege are unconstitutional conditions of confinement, and \n9  next addresses the factors that are \"pertinent in assessing the propriety of any injunctive \nrelief.\"  See Winter, 555 U.S. at 32. \n10 \n  As to the first factor, likelihood of success on the merits, petitioner's claim, as \n11 \nnoted, is that their conditions of confinement, in light of the present COVID-19 pandemic, \n  12 \n a\ntruin\noro 13  are unconstitutional.  In evaluating a claim that a detainee's conditions of confinement are \nCf\n tila\ncC unconstitutional, \"the proper inquiry is whether those conditions amount to punishment.\"  \nirts fo 14 \niD tc 15  See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 (1979).  \"[P]unitive conditions,\" i.e., conditions \n sir\net\ntasiD 16  amounting to punishment, occur \"(1) where the challenged restrictions are expressly \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  intended to punish, or (2) where the challenged restrictions serve an alternative, non-\ne\nh\nt\nintr punitive purpose but are nonetheless excessive in relation to the alternative purpose, or \nUo 18 \nN\nare employed to achieve objectives that could be accomplished in \n19 \n. . . alternative and less harsh methods.\"  See Jones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918, 932 (9th \n20 \nCir. 2004) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \n21 \n  Here, petitioners do not assert respondents, by detaining them in the conditions \n22 \npetitioners challenge, are intending to punish them.  Nor do petitioners dispute \n23 \nrespondents' asserted purpose in detaining them, specifically, to ensure petitioners' \n24 \npresence at immigration proceedings and the government's ability to effectuate any final \n25 \norders of removal.  Consequently, the issue here presented is whether petitioners are \n26 \nlikely to show that, given their alleged health concerns, their detention is excessive in \n27 \nrelation to the government's needs.  In resolving that issue, the Court considers each \n28 \n4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-02064-MMC   Document 38   Filed 04/08/20   Page 5 of 10\n \n1  petitioner's showing separately, as \"constitutional rights are personal.\"  See Broadrick v. \n2  Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 610 (1973). \n3    First, as to Ricardo Vasquez Cruz (\"Vasquez Cruz\"), Ernesto Abroncio Uc \n4  Encarnacion (\"Uc Encarnacion\"), Julio Cesar Buendia Alas (\"Buendia Alas\"), and Marco \n5  Montoya Amaya (\"Montoya\"), the Court finds petitioners have not shown a \"clear \n6  likelihood of success on the merits.\"  See Stanley, 13 F.3d at 1316.3  Specifically, the \n7  record lacks evidence clearly demonstrating a medical condition that places any of them \n8  at a \"higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.\"  See www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\n9  ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html.4  Vasquez Cruz describes \nhimself as diabetic, but Yuba medical staff lists him as prediabetic (see Kaiser Decl. \n10 \n¶ 13), and he is taking metformin, a drug commonly used to treat prediabetics, see \n11 \nwww.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prediabetes/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355284; \n  12 \n a\ntruin\noro 13  prediabetes has not been recognized by the CDC as a high-risk factor.  Uc Encarnacion \nCf\n tila\ncC told his immigration counsel he had asthma as a child (see Yamane Decl. ¶ 5), but he \nirts fo 14 \niD tc 15  has denied to the Yuba medical staff that he presently has asthma (see Kaiser Decl. \n sir\net\ntasiD 16  ¶ 11).  Although Buendia Alas states that, on dates that are undisclosed, he had \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  \"readings of high blood pressure\" (see Buendia Alas Decl. ¶ 5), there is no showing he \ne\nh\nt\nintr has been diagnosed with hypertension, i.e., that his blood pressure \"consistently ranges \nUo 18 \nN\nfrom 130-139 systolic or 80-89 mm Hg diastolic,\" see www.heart.org/en/health-\n19 \ntopics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings.  Lastly, the parasitic \n20 \ninfection with which Montoya has been \"tentatively diagnosed\" (see Wolfe-Roubatis Decl. \n21 \n22 \n \n23 \n3In making this finding and the findings set forth below, the Court has considered \nhearsay evidence offered by petitioners and by respondents.  See Flynt Distrib. Co. v. \n24 \nHarvey, 734 F. 2d 1389, 1394 (9th Cir. 1984) (holding district court did not err by \nconsidering hearsay evidence offered in connection with motion for preliminary injunction; \n25 \nfinding \"trial court may give even inadmissible evidence some weight when to do so \nserves the purpose of preventing irreparable harm before trial\").  \n26 \n4Petitioners do not argue, and the Court does not consider whether, during the \n27 \nCOVID-19 pandemic, it is unconstitutional for respondents to detain in crowded facilities \npersons who are not at such increased risk. \n28 \n5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-02064-MMC   Document 38   Filed 04/08/20   Page 6 of 10\n \n1  ¶¶ 8-9), is not included in the list of conditions identified by the CDC as high risk factors, \n2  and, although he states he has tuberculosis, his last chest x-ray was \"within normal \n3  limits\" and his last skin test was \"found negative for TB\" (see Bonnar Decl. ¶ 15).   \n4  Accordingly, issuance of a temporary restraining order as to the above four petitioners \n5  will be denied. \n6    The Court finds, however, petitioners have clearly shown four other petitioners are \n7  at high risk of severe illness if infected with COVID-19.  The parties agree Salomon \n8  Medina Calderon (\"Medina Calderon\") has been diagnosed with and receives treatment \n9  for diabetes (see Medina Calderon Decl. ¶ 6; Kaiser Decl. ¶ 10); he has been \n\"hospitalized many times despite taking diabetic medication\" and has lost all vision in one \n10 \neye and 70% of his vision in the other (see Medina Calderon ¶ 6).  The parties agree \n11 \nGennady V. Lavrus (\"Lavrus\") likewise has been diagnosed with and receives treatment \n  12 \n a\ntruin\noro 13  for diabetes (see Upshaw Decl. ¶ 5; Kaiser Decl. ¶ 12); his condition is of a severity that \nCf\n tila\ncC requires him to take insulin by injection (see Upshaw Decl. ¶¶ 5, 7).  The parties agree \nirts fo 14 \niD tc 15  Charles Joseph (\"Joseph\") has asthma (see Joseph Decl. ¶ 13; Bonnar Decl. ¶ 10), \n sir\net\ntasiD 16  which condition has required him, for the past six years, to use albuterol (see Joseph \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Decl. ¶ 13).  Lastly, J Elias Solorio Lopez (\"Solorio Lopez\") is 82 years of age (see \ne\nh\nt\nintr Waldron Decl. ¶ 3; Bonnar Decl. ¶ 11), and, as reported by a physician who examined \nUo 18 \nN\nhim in January 2020, has a \"history of hypertension\" and \"polycystic kidney disease,\" as \n19 \nwell as \"severe malnutrition\" and other ailments (see Waldron Decl. ¶ 8; Haar Decl. \n20 \n¶ 2 and attachment thereto). \n21 \n  The Court further finds petitioners have clearly shown the above-referenced four \n22 \npetitioners cannot practice meaningful social distancing in their respective detention \n23 \nfacilities.  Petitioners have offered evidence, undisputed by respondents, that detainees, \n24 \nboth at Yuba and Mesa Verde, are kept in close proximity, i.e., less than six feet apart, \n25 \nnot only when in their living quarters (see Medina Calderon Decl. ¶ 16; Upshaw Decl. \n26 \n¶ 19; Minchaca Ramos ¶¶ 12, 15; Joseph Decl. ¶¶ 9-10; Knox Decl. ¶ 9), but also during \n27 \nmeals (see Supp. Weisner Decl. ¶ 4.ii; Rodarte ¶ 10; Knox Decl. ¶ 10; Bent Decl. ¶ 11; \n28 \n6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-02064-MMC   Document 38   Filed 04/08/20   Page 7 of 10\n \n1  Joseph Decl. ¶ 11), and, at Yuba, when lining up for temperature checks as well (see \n2  Supp. Upshaw Decl. ¶ 6; Rodarte ¶ 10).5  Additionally, petitioners have offered evidence, \n3  undisputed by respondents, that detainees at Yuba and Mesa Verde have not been \n4  provided with masks (see Yamane Decl. ¶ 12; Rodarte Decl. ¶ 9; Bent Decl. ¶ 13; Wolfe-\n5  Roubatis Decl. ¶ 13), and respondents do not assert they have any plans to do so.  \n6  Similarly, there is undisputed evidence that staff at Yuba and Mesa Verde, with limited \n7  exception, do not wear masks or other protective equipment when in the immediate \n8  vicinity of detainees.  (See Yamane Decl. ¶ 12; Upshaw Decl. ¶¶ 12, 14; Supp. Upshaw \n9  ¶¶ 7-8; Rodarte Decl. ¶ 9; Bent Decl. ¶ 13; Knox Decl. ¶¶ 7, 15; Supp. Joseph Decl. ¶ 7.) \n  Although, as noted, it is undisputed that respondents have a non-punitive purpose \n10 \nin detaining Medina Calderon, Lavrus, Joseph, and Solorio Lopez, namely to ensure their \n11 \nrespective appearances at immigration proceedings and to effectuate any final orders of \n  12 \n a\ntruin\noro 13  removal, the Court finds petitioners have made a strong showing that respondents' \nCf\n tila\ncC detaining them in the above-referenced conditions, in spite of their knowledge of said \nirts fo 14 \niD tc 15  petitioners' respective high-risk status, is \"excessive in relation to [that] purpose.\"  See \n sir\net\ntasiD 16  Jones, 393 F.3d at 932.  Accordingly, with respect to these four petitioners, the Court \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  finds a clear showing has been made that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their \ne\nh\nt\nintr Fifth Amendment claim. \nUo 18 \nN\n  Next, with respect to the question of whether petitioners have shown a likelihood \n19 \nof irreparable harm, the Court first notes the virus, as explained by the CDC, \"is thought \n20 \nto spread mainly from person-to-person, through respiratory droplets produced when an \n21 \ninfected person coughs or sneezes,\" and that such \"droplets can land in the mouths or \n22 \nnoses of people who are nearby or be launched into the air and inhaled into someone's \n23 \nlungs.\"  See www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-\n24 \ndetention/faq.html.  Further, the Court finds petitioners have shown Medina Calderon, \n25 \nLavrus, Joseph, and Solorio Lopez cannot meaningfully, if in any manner, adhere to the \n26 \n \n27 \n5There is no evidence Mesa Verde conducts temperature checks of detainees, \nother than one initially at \"intake.\"  (See Moon Decl. ¶ 18.) \n28 \n7 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-02064-MMC   Document 38   Filed 04/08/20   Page 8 of 10\n \n1  advice the country's health officials, including those at the CDC, have repeatedly given to \n2  all persons in the United States as to how to avoid becoming infected with COVID-19, \n3  specifically, to engage at all times in social distancing, to use protective equipment such \n4  as masks, gloves, or other coverings when in close contact with others, and to frequently \n5  wash or otherwise sanitize one's hands. \n6    Under such circumstances, the Court finds petitioners have made a sufficient \n7  showing that Medina Calderon, Lavrus, Joseph, and Solorio Lopez, as persons at high \n8  risk of severe illness or death if infected with COVID-19, are likely to incur irreparable \n9  injury in the absence of any relief from their present conditions of confinement. \n  The Court next finds the balance of hardships tips in favor of Medina Calderon, \n10 \nLavrus, Joseph, and Solorio Lopez.  As noted, none of these petitioners is in a position to \n11 \nmeaningfully limit his exposure to COVID-19 while at Yuba or Mesa Verde.  Although \n  12 \n a\ntruin\noro 13  respondents may have concerns about flight risk or other matters,6 the Court intends to \nCf\n tila\ncC address those issues by imposing reasonable conditions upon release, as discussed \nirts fo 14 \niD tc 15  below. \n sir\net\ntasiD 16    Lastly, the Court finds, under the highly unusual circumstances presented, i.e., a \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  global pandemic of a type not seen within recent memory, the public interest is served by \ne\nh\nt\nintr the requested injunction.  Specifically, the public interest in promoting public health is \nUo 18 \nN\nserved by efforts to contain the further spread of COVID-19, particularly in detention \n19 \ncenters, which typically are staffed by numerous individuals who reside in nearby \n20 \ncommunities. \n21 \n  Accordingly, the Court will grant the motion to the extent it is brought on behalf of \n22 \nMedina Calderon, Lavrus, Joseph, and Solorio Lopez. \n23 \n// \n24 \n// \n25 \n// \n26 \n \n27 \n6To date, respondents have not identified any concern specific to any of these four \nindividuals. \n28 \n8 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-02064-MMC   Document 38   Filed 04/08/20   Page 9 of 10\n \n1    The Court will not, however, order any such petitioner to be released without \n2  reasonable conditions, and, as to each such petitioner, will include the following \n3  conditions in its order of release: \n4    (1) Petitioner is to reside and shelter in place at an address to be specified in said \n5  order.7  \n6    (2) Petitioner shall be transported by a person to be specified in said order from \n7  his place of detention to the residence where he will reside and shelter in place.8 \n8    (3) Pending further order of the Court, petitioner shall not leave the residence \n9  where he will shelter in place, except to obtain medical care, to appear at immigration \ncourt proceedings, or to obey any order issued by the Department of Homeland Security. \n10 \n  (4) Petitioner shall not violate any federal, state, or local law. \n11 \n  In addition, the Court will direct the parties' respective counsel to meet and confer, \n  12 \n a\ntruin\noro 13  by email, telephone, or other means, and to propose, in a joint statement any additional \nCf\n tila\ncC reasonable conditions. \nirts fo 14 \niD tc 15  // \n sir\net\ntasiD 16  // \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  // \ne\nh\nt\nintr // \nUo 18 \nN\n// \n19 \n// \n20 \n// \n21 \n// \n22 \n// \n23 \n// \n24 \n// \n25 \n \n26 \n7The address for each petitioner is to be provided by petitioners' counsel. \n27 \n8The name of the transporter of each petitioner is to be provided by petitioners' \ncounsel. \n28 \n9 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-02064-MMC   Document 38   Filed 04/08/20   Page 10 of 10\n \n1  CONCLUSION \n2  For the reasons stated, petitioners' motion is hereby GRANTED in part and \n3  DENIED in part, as follows:9 \n4  1.  To the extent the motion is brought on behalf of petitioners Sofia Bahena \n5  Ortuño and Roxana del Carmen Trigueros Acevedo, the motion is DENIED as moot. \n6  2.

To the extent the motion is brought on behalf of petitioners Salomon Medina \n10  Calderon, Gennady V. Lavrus, Charles Joseph, and J Elias Solorio Lopez, the motion is \nhereby GRANTED, and said petitioners shall be released upon issuance of an order \n11 \nsetting conditions of release.  The parties' respective counsel are hereby DIRECTED to \n  12 \n a\ntruin\noro 13  meet and confer forthwith and to propose, in a joint statement to be filed no later than \nCf\n tila\ncC April 10, 2020, at 11:00 a.m., any additional reasonable conditions. \nirts fo 14 \niD tc 15    4.
