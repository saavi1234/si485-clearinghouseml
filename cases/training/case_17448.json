    "summary": "<p>On March 24, 2020, 32 COVID-19 vulnerable individuals incarcerated in New York City jails filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. The petitioners sued the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Correction and the Acting Commissioner of the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. Represented by the Legal Aid Society of New York, the petitioners requested that the court issue a writ of habeas corpus and order their immediate release. The petition alleged that continuing to hold these individuals on bail or for parole violations constituted deliberate indifference to the risk of serious medical harm in violation of their Fourteenth Amendment due process rights and state constitutional rights to due process. As of March 26, New York City reported at least 73 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in its jails.</p>\r\n<p>On March 26, New York State Supreme Court Justice Mark Dwyer ordered that 16 individuals should be released. See Legal Aid Society's press release <a href=\"https://legalaidnyc.org/news/legal-aid-wins-release-16-incarcerated-new-yorkers-covid-19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>. Of these 16, some had been jailed pretrial and others for parole violations. Their age and medical conditions made them particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 such that incarceration during the pandemic violated their due process rights. Judge Dwyer stated that the City and the State failed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 at the local jails and that further action was needed. He also granted leave to the Legal Aid Society to renew applications for release on an additional 9 individuals, suggesting that he may release them if the Legal Aid Society provides further information in court on March 27.</p>\r\n<p>In response to these amended applications, on April 6, Judge Dwyer issued a release order for more petitioners, 18 in total. Some other petitioners had been released on bail or on consent. Judge Dwyer found that their continued confinement in Rikers violated their federal and state due process rights and rejected respondent's claim that they took \"reasonable care\" to mitigate the COVID-19 risk for these individuals. The release order specified that it applied only to individuals with substantial risk factors, but it included individuals charged with violent crimes as well. The case is ongoing.</p>",

I  am  an  Assistant  Corporation  Counsel  assigned  to  represent  Cynthia \nBrann, Commissioner of the New York City Department of Correction (“City Respondent”), in \nthe  above-captioned  proceeding.    I  submit  this  supplemental  affirmation  in  opposition  to \nPetitioners’ Verified Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, dated March 25, 2020, seeking an order \ndirecting the immediate release of 110 persons in the custody of the New York City Department \nof Correction (“DOC”) pursuant to C.P.L.R. § 7001. \n\n2.  Petitioners’ request should be denied for two reasons: (1) the Petition is \nbarred as a successive abuse of the writ following the denial of essentially the identical writ \nwhich was brought and denied on March 20, 2020 by Justice Steven Statsinger, In the Matter of \nPetition for release Venus Williams, et al., SCID No. 20042-20 (“Prior Writ”); and (2) the \nPetition fails to state a cause of action because the DOC is actively working to ensure the health \nand safety of persons in DOC custody through extensive sanitary and training efforts to combat \nthe COVID-19 epidemic, as set forth in detail below and in the accompanying affidavits of \nPatricia Feeney, dated March 25, 2020, DOC’s Deputy Commissioner for Quality Assurance and \nIntegrity; and of Richard D. Bush, dated March 25, 2020, the Senior Correctional Institution \nAdministrator for Health Affairs. \nA.  The Petition Must Be Dismissed as an Abuse of the Writ due to the Substantially \nSimilar Prior Writ Having Been Heard on the Merits and Denied. \n3.  It is well-settled that, while the doctrine of res judicata does not bar successive \nwrits brought by the same party, courts “will normally dismiss a [successive] writ containing \nnothing new.” People ex rel. Anderson v. Warden, N.Y.C. Correctional Institution for Men, 68 \nMisc. 2d 463, 325 N.Y.S.2d 829 (Sup. Ct. Bronx County 1971) (citing Weinstein, Korn & \nMiller); see also People ex rel. Leneau v. Warden of Otis Bantum Corr. Facility, 158 A.D.3d 773 \n(2d  Dep’t  2018)  (successive  habeas  petition  denied  where  not  “supported  by  any  changed \ncircumstances”);  People  ex  rel.  Woodard  v.  Berry,  163  A.D.2d  759  (3rd  Dep’t)  (“orderly \nadministration require[s] at least a showing of changed circumstances” to grant a successive \nhabeas petition); People ex rel. Gonzalez v. Deegan, 29 A.D.2d 865, 288 N.Y.S.2d 362 (2d \nDep’t 1968) (writ denied where writ had been previously denied).  \n4.  Indeed, in Matter of Nonhuman Rights Project, Inc. v. Lavery, 152 A.D.3d 73, 75 \n(1st Dep’t 2017) the First Department recently denied a habeas petition which appeared to be \n  - 2 -   \n \n\nbrought  by  different  petitioners  but  contained  the  same  arguments  as  the  prior  petitions, \n“virtually the same” affidavits in support of the petitioners, and did not present “new information \nor new ground not previously considered.”  In that case, the court stated, “we find that the \nmotion court properly declined to sign the orders to show cause since these were successive \nhabeas proceedings which were not warranted or supported by any changed circumstances.” Id.  \nMoreover, in McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 111 S. Ct. 1454, 113 L. Ed. 2d 517 (1991), the \nSupreme  Court  held  that  when  the  government  pleads  abuse  of  the  writ  in  response  to  a \nsuccessive petition, the petitioner must demonstrate why a successive writ is not an abuse of the \nwrit.  \n5.  Here, while the Petitioners are different parties from those presented in the \nPrior  Writ—as  was  the  case  in  Matter  of  Nonhuman  Rights  Project,  Inc.  v.  Lavery—the \nargument is identical to the one presented by the same counsel who argued the Prior Writ before \nthe Court on March 20, 2020, in that it seeks a mass release of persons in DOC custody alleging \nthat DOC is deliberately indifferent to the health and safety of the petitioners. \n6.  On March 20, 2020, Justice Statsinger held that: \nTHE COURT:   I am going to deny the petition for writ of habeas corpus. I’m not \ngoing to make a long ruling now. I will eventually file something in writing. I am \nnot prepared in this case that the constitutional standard of deliberate indifference \nis  met.  Deliberate  indifference,  in  general,  requires  a  dangerous  condition; \nknowledge, either actual or constructive, on the part of the incarcerating agency, \nand the failure to take any steps to remedy. In this case although the first two are \nsatisfied, there is a dangerous condition of a sort that is truly unprecedented, and \nthe Department Of Corrections, clearly, knows about it. I’m simply not prepared \nto find either that Corrections has done nothing to remedy the situation, or that \nrelease is the only way to mitigate the harm. \n \nSee Transcript attached hereto as Ex. A (emphasis added).  It is without question that the current \npetition presents the exact same argument presented in the Prior Writ. See e.g. Williams, SCID \n  - 3 -   \n \n\nNo. 20042-20, annexed hereto as Ex. B.   For this reason alone, this petition should be denied as \nan abuse of the writ. \nB.  The Petition Should Be Dismissed Because Petitioners Have Not Shown that the \nDepartment of Correction is Deliberately Indifferent to the Petitioners’ Rights. \n7.  As set forth in the accompanying Affidavit of Patricia Feeney, the Deputy \nCommissioner of Quality Assurance and Integrity, dated March 25, 2020 (“Feeney Aff.”), DOC \nhas undertaken substantial efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure the health \nand safety of persons in DOC custody to the greatest extent possible. See Feeney Aff. annexed as \nEx. C. \n8.  With a substantial professional background in both health and sanitation, \nMs. Feeney is responsible for ensuring that DOC and its staff are adhering to the rules mandated \nby  regulatory  agencies  and  its  internal  policies.  Ms.  Feeney  explains  that  she  has  “been \ninstrumental in ramping up DOC sanitation protocols and comprehensive cleaning measures to \ncombat [COVID-19’s] spread throughout our facilities.  This includes implementing enhanced \ncleaning and sanitizing procedures in areas with a lot of traffic, which include hallways and \nbathrooms.”  See Ex. C ¶ 7.  DOC’s efforts also include extensive efforts to train all staff on \nencouraging all inmates on social distancing strategies, hand washing, avoiding sitting on other \ninmates’ beds, covering mouths when sneezing or coughing, and other sanitary practices.  Id. \n¶¶8(a)-(g).    Ms.  Feeney,  along  with  the  Bureau  Chief  of  Facilities  Operations,  monitor \ncompliance with all mandated continual inspections of housing areas by all DOC staff to ensure \nworking faucets and constant adequate cleaning and sanitization supplies.  Id. ¶ 14. \n9.  In addition, the Affidavit of Richard D. Bush, the Senior Correctional \nInstitution Administrator for Health Affairs, dated March 25, 2020 (“Bush Aff.”), demonstrates \nthat the DOC has undertaken efforts to ensure the health and safety of persons in DOC custody.  \n  - 4 -   \n \n\nSee Bush Aff., annexed hereto as Ex. D.  Mr. Bush’s responsibilities include serving as a liaison \nbetween DOC and Correctional Health Services (“CHS”), the entity responsible for the delivery \nof health services to the incarcerated population in DOC’s care.  CHS identifies medically \nvulnerable persons based on their medical backgrounds, and separates these individuals from the \ngeneral population of inmates. See Ex. D ¶ 3.  It is Mr. Bush’s understanding that individuals \nwho  have  been  diagnosed  with  COVID-19  are  separated  from  those  who  have  not  been \ndiagnosed, and that clinicians are available to communicate with their patients and reinforce \nguidance about how to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including frequent hand washing, social \ndistancing, covering one’s mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, among other things. \nSee id.  Moreover, DOC maintains regular contact with CHS to monitor at-risk individuals in \nDOC’s care, and DOC staff have been instructed to refer any individual in custody who is \nexhibiting COVID-19 like symptoms to CHS for an evaluation.  Any vehicle used to transport an \ninmate exhibiting symptoms of respiratory illness is sanitized immediately after that use. See Ex. \nC. ¶ 10.  \n10.  From  March  16  to  March  25  a  total  of  630  individuals  have  been \ndischarged from DOC’s custody.  The daily population census of all inmates held in DOC \ncustody has been reduced as follows, reflecting the dramatic increase in the rate of release:  \n3/26/20.   5057 current census \n3/25/20.   5169  \n3/24/20.   5236 \n3/23/20.   5232 \n3/20/20.   5348 \n3/19/20.   5371 \n3/18/20.   5391 \n3/17/20.   5385 \n3/16/20.   5447 \n \n  - 5 -   \n \n\n11.  As  the  Feeney  and  Bush  Affs.  make  clear,  DOC’s  efforts  are \ncomprehensive and ongoing. See Exs. C and D.  Petitioners cannot meet their burden of showing \nthat DOC is deliberately indifferent to the health and safety of the petitioners.  Accordingly, the \nPetition should be denied. \n12.  For the foregoing reasons, City Respondent respectfully requests that the \nCourt dismiss the Verified Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and deny the relief requested \ntherein in its entirety, together with such other and further relief as this Court deems just and \nproper. \n \nDated:  New York, New York \nMarch 26, 2020 \n             /s/ \nMartin Bowe \nCc:  COREY STOUGHTON \nMARIE NDIAYE \nLAUREN GOTTESMAN \nMICHELLE MCGRATH \nLegal Aid Society \n199 Water Street, 6th Floor \nNew York, NY 10036 \n(646) 884-2316 \ncstoughton@legal \n \nJAMES B.

This includes implementing enhanced cleaning and sanitizing procedures in areas with\na lot of traffic, which include hallways and bathrooms.\n8. As part of its ongoing efforts to contain the spread of COVID-l9, DOC has implemented the\ncontainment and control of transmission guidelines recommended by the CDC and DOHMH and\nhas communicated these guidelines to staff and persons in custody through in-person meetings,\nteletypes, posters, intranet, social media, and DOC TV.

Corey Stoughton, Esq., \non behalf of \n \nIndex No. _______________ \nHOGAN JEFFREY, et al.,  \n \n \nSCID No. _______________ \n  Petitioners, \n \n \nVERIFIED PETITION FOR \n  v. \nWRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS \n \n \nCYNTHIA BRANN, Commissioner, New York City \n \nDepartment of Correction; ANTHONY ANNUCCI, Acting \nCommissioner, New York State Department of Corrections \nand Community Supervision, \n \n  Respondents. \n \nCorey Stoughton, an attorney duly admitted to practice law in the State of New York, \nhereby affirms the following under penalty of perjury:  \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  Petitioners are 32 people who, by virtue of their age and/or underlying medical \ncondition, are particularly vulnerable to serious illness or death if infected by COVID-19. This \npetition seeks their immediate release from jails in New York City on the grounds that continuing \nto hold them on bail or parole holds constitutes deliberate indifference to the risk of serious medical \nharm in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and state constitutional right to due process.  \n2.    In only a few months, over 360,000 people worldwide have been diagnosed with \nCOVID-19 and more than 13,000 of those people have died. As of the date of this filing, there are \nmore than 15,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus within the New York City area, up from just 923 \n  3 \n \n\non March 18, 2020, less than one week ago. There are now at least 125 COVID-19 related deaths \nin the New York City area alone.1  \n3.  The situation in New York City’s jails is rapidly deteriorating. As of March 23, \n2020, there are 39 reported cases of COVID-19 in our jails,2 compared to only one known case as \nof Friday, March 20, 2020.3 These numbers are growing rapidly every day. Even at current rates \nof infection, the virus’s “attack rate” on Rikers Island – that is, the rate at which the population is \nbeing infected – is roughly five times higher than anywhere else in the United States of America. \n4.  There is no vaccine or cure for COVID-19. No one is immune. \n5.  COVID-19 is most likely to cause serious illness and death for older adults and \nthose  with  certain  underlying  medical  conditions.  Petitioners  all  fall  into  this  category  of \nheightened vulnerability. \n6.  Because risk mitigation is the only known strategy to protect vulnerable groups \nfrom COVID-19 and risk mitigation is effectively impossible in jails, including those in New York \nCity, correctional public health experts—including the New York City Board of Correction, the \nlead doctor of New York’s own correctional health system and several experts around the \ncountry—have recommended the release from custody of people most vulnerable to COVID-19. \nAs these experts have explained, release is the only effective means to protect the people with the \ngreatest vulnerability to COVID-19 from transmission of the virus and also allows for greater risk \n                                                 \n1 COVID-19 Daily Case Data Summary, NYC Health, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Mar. 23, 2020) available at \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-daily-data-summary.pdf (last visited Mar. 23, 2020). \n2 Robin McDowell & Michael Balsamo, 38 positive for coronavirus in NYC jails, including Rikers, Associated \nPress, available at https://apnews.com/54dbc9d47f62cf0c0240314310cfe909 (last visited Mar. 22, 2020); see also \nChelsia Rose Marcius, Coronavirus prompts reopening of shuttered jail on Rikers Island, N.Y.

On March 21, 2020, the Board of Correction (“BOC”) issued its second advisory \nletter, urging judges and prosecutors to act quickly to release people, like Petitioners, who are over \nfifty years old and who have health conditions that make them high-risk for COVID-19.4 The BOC \nalso recommended immediate release of individuals who are incarcerated for technical violations \nof parole and those serving city sentences.5  As the BOC reported – using statistics that are already \nout of date and thus significantly understate the numbers of diagnosed illnesses and deaths: \nOver the past six days, we have learned that at least twelve DOC employees, five \nCHS employees, and twenty-one people in custody have tested positive for the \nvirus.  There  are  more  than  58  individuals  currently  being  monitored  in  the \ncontagious disease and quarantine units (up from 26 people on March 17). It is \nlikely these people have been in hundreds of housing areas and common areas over \nrecent weeks and have been in close contact with many other people in custody \nand staff. Given the nature of jails (e.g. dense housing areas and structural \nbarriers to social distancing, hygiene, and sanitation), the number of patients \ndiagnosed with COVID-19 is certain to rise exponentially. The best path forward \nto protecting the community of people housed and working in the jails is to rapidly \ndecrease the number of people housed and working in them.6 \n8.  In other parts of the country, government officials have recognized this reality and \nbegun releasing medically vulnerable pre-trial detainees. The Supreme Court of New Jersey \nmediated a process between the N.J. Office of the Public Defender, the ACLU of New Jersey, the \nN.J. Office of the Attorney General, and the County Prosecutors Association that resulted in a \ncourt order creating a presumption of release for all inmates serving a county jail sentence or a \nsentence as a condition of probation, resulting in the release of over 1,000 people. See Consent \n                                                 \n4 Jacqueline Sherman, Interim Chair of NYC Board of Correction, letter, Mar. 21, 2020, available at \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/assets/boc/downloads/pdf/News/covid-19/Letter-from-BOC-re-NYC-Jails-and-COVID-19-\n2020-03-21.pdf (last visited Mar. 22, 2020). \n5 Id.  \n6 Id. (emphasis added).  \n  5 \n \n\nOrder, Supreme Court of New Jersey, Docket No. 084320 (Mar. 22, 2020). Other courts have \nbegun granting specific applications for release of pretrial detainees, with many more such \napplications pending around the country.7 \n9.  In New York, however, as of the date of this writing, the Mayor of New York \nreports that only 75 people from all across the City’s jails have been released.8 There are more \nthan 5,000 people on Rikers Island alone.

COVID-19 is a coronavirus that has reached pandemic status. As of March 23, 2020, \nover 360,000 people worldwide have confirmed diagnoses, including over 43,000 people in the \nUnited States with 20,000 in New York—nearly half of the known cases in the nation.9 Over \n16,000 people have died worldwide, including at least 500 people in the United States and over \n150 in New York.10 On the single day of March 18 alone, more than 1,000 new cases were \nannounced in New York State. As of the date of this writing, there are more than 9,000 confirmed \ncases of coronavirus within the New York City area, and there are 125 deaths reported within the \nfive-boroughs of New York City.11 As noted above, there are now thirty-nine reported cases of \n                                                 \n9 Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Global Outbreak, N.Y.

The transmission of COVID-19 is expected to grow exponentially. Nationally, \nprojections by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) indicate that over 200 \nmillion people in the United States could be infected with COVID-19 over the course of the \npandemic without effective public health intervention, with as many as 1.5 million deaths in the \nmost severe projections. 17 \n52.

For people over the age of 50 or with medical conditions that increase the risk of \nserious COVID-19 infection, symptoms such as fever, coughing and shortness of breath can be \nespecially severe.22 \n57.  COVID-19  can  cause  severe  damage  to  lung  tissue,  sometimes  leading  to  a \npermanent loss of respiratory capacity, and can damage tissues in other vital organs including the \nheart and liver. Patients with serious cases of COVID-19 require advanced medical support, \nincluding positive pressure ventilation and extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation in intensive \ncare. Patients who do not die from serious cases of COVID-19 may face prolonged recovery \nperiods, including extensive rehabilitation from neurological damage and loss of respiratory \ncapacity. \n58.  COVID-19 may also target the heart muscle, causing a medical condition known \nas myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle. Myocarditis can affect the heart muscle and \nelectrical system, reducing the heart’s ability to pump. This reduction can lead to rapid or abnormal \nheart rhythms in the short term, and long-term heart failure that limits exercise tolerance and ability \nto work. \n59.  Emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 can also trigger an over-response of \nthe immune system, further damaging tissues in a cytokine release syndrome that can result in \nwidespread damage to other organs, including permanent injury to the kidneys and neurologic \ninjury. \n60.  These complications can manifest at an alarming pace. Patients can show the first \nsymptoms of infection in as little as two days after exposure, and their condition can seriously \ndeteriorate in as little as five days or sooner. \n                                                 \n22 Id. \n  18 \n \n\n61.  Most people in higher risk categories who develop serious disease will need \nadvanced supportive care requiring highly specialized equipment that is in limited supply, and an \nentire team of care providers, including 1:1 or 1:2 nurse to patient ratios, respiratory therapists, \nand intensive care physicians. This level of support can quickly exceed local health care resources. \nPatients in high-risk categories should expect a prolonged recovery, including the need for \nextensive rehabilitation for profound reconditioning, loss of digits, neurologic damage, and the \nloss of respiratory capacity. \n62.  The need for care, including intensive care, and the likelihood of death, is much \nhigher from COVID-19 than from influenza. According to recent estimates, the fatality rate of \npeople infected with COVID-19 is about ten times higher than a severe seasonal influenza, even \nin advanced countries with highly effective health care systems. According to preliminary data \nfrom China, 20 percent of people in high-risk categories who contracted COVID-19 there died.23  \n63.  There is no cure for COVID-19 nor is there any known medication to prevent or \ntreat infection.  \n                                                 \n23 Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), World Health Organization \n(Feb. 28, 2020), at 12, https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-\nfinal-report.pdf (finding fatality rates for patients with COVID-19 and co-morbid conditions to be: “13.2% for those \nwith cardiovascular disease, 9.2% for diabetes, 8.4% for hypertension, 8.0% for chronic respiratory disease, and \n7.6% for cancer”); Wei-jie Guan et al., Comorbidity and its impact on 1,590 patients with COVID-19 in China: A \nNationwide Analysis, medRxiv (Feb. 27, 2020), at 5, \nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027664v1.full.pdf (finding that even after adjusting for age \nand smoking status, patients with COVID-19 and comorbidities of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, \nhypertension, and malignancy were 1.79 times more likely to be admitted to an ICU, require invasive ventilation, or \ndie, the number for two comorbidities was 2.59); Fei Zhou et al., Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of \nadult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study, Lancet (March 11, 2020), tb. \n1,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30566-3/fulltext (finding that among hospital \npatients, who tended to be older, of those who had COVID-19 and died, 48% had hypertension, 31% had diabetes, \nand 24% had coronary heart disease). \n  19 \n \n\n64.  The only known methods to reduce the risk for vulnerable people of serious illness \nor death from COVID-19 are to prevent infection in the first place through social distancing and \nimproved hygiene, including washing hand frequently with soap and water.  \nPeople Imprisoned in New York City Jails Face an Elevated Risk of COVID-19 Transmission \n65.  COVID-19 has now reached Rikers Island and is rapidly spreading. On March 20, \n2020, there was only one confirmed case of a detainee with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis.24 Just \none day later, on March 21, 2020, the New York City Board of Correction reported that at least 21 \ndetainees in New York City DOC jails had tested positive for the virus, along with twelve DOC \nemployees, and five Correctional Health Services (CHS) employees.25 There are now at least 39 \ninmates diagnosed with the virus, indicating transmission is now passing at an alarming rate and \nwill only continue to spread rapidly. \n66.  One  DOC  staff  member,  a  56-year-old  Investigation  Division  staffer,  whose \nposition entailed interviewing detainees in several facilities as part of investigations, died on \nMarch 15, 2020.26  He reportedly had underlying health conditions, just as Petitioners do.27   \n67.  Infectious diseases that are communicated by air or touch are more likely to spread \nin congregate environments such as jails – places where people live, eat, and sleep in close \nproximity. \n                                                 \n24 Chelsia Rose Marcius, Rikers Island inmate has contracted coronavirus: officials, N.Y.

The highest known person-to-person transmission rate for COVID-19 to date took \nplace in a skilled nursing home facility in Kirkland, Washington, and on afflicted cruise ships in \nJapan and off the coast of California. \n69.  The conditions of New York City jails pose a higher risk of the spread of COVID-\n19 than in non-carceral locations like a nursing home or cruise ship. Jails have a greater risk \nbecause of closer quarters, the proportion of vulnerable people detained, and scant medical care \nresources. \n70.  Severe outbreaks of contagious illness regularly occur in jails. For example, during \nthe H1N1 epidemic in 2009, many jails and prisons saw a particularly high number of cases.28 \nH1N1 is far less contagious than COVID-19. Not surprisingly, Chinese prison officials report that \nover five-hundred (500) COVID-19 cases in the current outbreak stemmed from the Hubei \nprovince prisons.29 The rate of incarceration in China is far lower than in the United States, \nsuggesting the problem here will be much worse. Experts predict that “[a]ll prisons and jails should \nanticipate that the coronavirus will enter their facility[.]”30  \n71.  Even at current rates of infection, which are rapidly growing, the virus’s “attack \nrate” on Rikers Island – that is, the rate at which the population is being infected – is roughly five \ntimes higher than anywhere else in the United States of America. \n                                                 \n28 Nicole Westman, The Verge, Prisons and jails are vulnerable to COVID-19 outbreaks, available at \nhttps://www.theverge.com/2020/3/7/21167807/coronavirus-prison-jail-health-outbreak-covid-19-flu-soap  (Mar. 12 \n2020).

In New York City jails, jail design and operations make it impossible for Petitioners \nto engage in the necessary social distancing required to mitigate the risk of transmission. Many \npeople live in dormitory-like sleeping arrangements. They have limited freedom of movement and \nno control over the movements of others with whom they are required to congregate on a daily \nbasis. They are unable to maintain anything close to the recommended distance of 6 feet from \nothers. \n73.  Petitioners also cannot maintain adequate levels of preventive hygiene. They are \nrequired to share or touch objects used by others. Toilets, sinks and showers are shared, without \ndisinfection between each use.  \n74.  Food preparation and service is communal, served by other incarcerated workers \ndrawn from many different housing areas within the jail, with little opportunity for surface \ndisinfection.  \n75.  There have been shortages of basic cleaning supplies to disinfect housing areas in \nNew York City jails, including housing areas where people with respiratory illnesses are currently \nconfined.  \n76.  DOC cleaning protocols for common spaces are often not followed. On Monday, \nMarch 23, 2020, a Legal Aid lawyer spoke to her client who reported that six people had been \nremoved from his dormitory over the weekend after testing positive for COVID-19, but his \ndormitory still had not been cleaned. Later that day, the Legal Aid Society informed DOC in a \nletter of this and other complaints, but to date have not had a response. \n77.  Petitioners lack ready access to soap and water for washing hands. If a sink in a \nhousing area is broken, they do not have a choice to walk to an area with a working sink. Soap and \npaper towels are not provided by the jail. Often, the only means to access soap is by purchasing it \n  22 \n \n\nin commissary—which is not an option for many detainees who lack access to funds. There is no \nrecourse if another person takes a vulnerable person’s bar of soap. \n78.  As recently as the day of this filing, clients of the Legal Aid Society were reporting \nto their attorneys that they had no access to soap or hand sanitizer. \n79.  Hand sanitizer capable of killing COVID-19 contains alcohol, which has been \ntreated as contraband in jails. Indeed, on March 20, 2020, a representative for Respondent Brann \nconfirmed in a court proceeding that detainees still do not have access to hand sanitizer because of \nits purported dangerousness.  \n80.  New York City jails lack adequate infrastructure to address the spread of infectious \ndisease and the treatment of people most vulnerable to illness. \n81.  Neither DOC nor Correctional Health Services (“CHS”), the medical services \nprovider in New York City jails, has implemented protocols sufficient to screen, detect or identify \nincarcerated people or staff who have been infected. \n82.  On March 10, 2020, DOC officials testified at a Board of Correction meeting that \nthe Communicable Disease Unit (“CDU”) has only 88 respiratory isolation beds available for \npeople who become infected.  Officials did not identify how many of these beds are already \noccupied by other ill people or what actions would be taken by the Department in the event that \nCDU and hospital ward capacity is exhausted.31 \n83.  The procedures outlined in the DOC’s “COVID19 Preparation & Action Plan” \nissued on March 5, 2020 are not sufficient to mitigate the risk of serious harm.  According to this \nplan, newly admitted detainees will only be separated from other detainees if they exhibit “flu-\n                                                 \n31 Testimony of Dept. of Corr. Official, N.Y.C. Bd. of Corr. Mtg., Mar. 10, 2020 at 17:40, \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/boc/meetings/mar-10-2020.page.   \n  23 \n \n\nlike” symptoms upon admission.32  This initial screening process overlooks the fact that COVID-\n19 may present with a slower onset of symptoms than the flu — meaning that many who are \ninfected  with  COVID-19  do  not  show  signs  of  illness.33   The  dangers  of  asymptomatic \ntransmission continue within DOC facilities.  DOC and CHS have revealed only symptom-reactive \npolicies—that staff will be sent home and incarcerated people will be separated and treated if they \ndisplay symptoms34—which are ineffective to stop the rampant asymptomatic transmission of the \ndisease.35 \n84.  DOC plans to warehouse all of its “sick” detainees together, in communal living \nspaces, where they will “sleep head to toe thereby increasing breathable space between inmates,”36 \na measure that will do little to avoid transmission among detainees.   \n85.  Even  if  all  of  these  problems  could  be  resolved,  however,  they  would  not \nsufficiently address the risk of serious medical harm to Petitioners. As Dr. Homer Venters, former \nchief  medical  officer  of  New  York  City  jails,  recently  said,  “[i]n  ordinary  times,  crowded \njails overlook prisoners’ medical problems and struggle to separate them based on their security \nclassification…[i]f jails have to add quarantines and sequestration of high-risk prisoners to the \nmix…they will find managing a COVID-19 outbreak ‘simply almost impossible.’”37 \n                                                 \n32 See N.Y.C.

Likewise, Correctional Health Services (“CHS”), which administers medical care \nin New York City jails, has acknowledged their limited capacity to manage the risk of the virus \nand has requested that courts reconsider the necessity of pretrial detention for high risk patients \nuntil the current state of emergency is resolved. \nRelease Is Required to Address the Risk of Serious Medical Harm \n87.  Because risk mitigation is the only known strategy to protect vulnerable groups \nfrom COVID-19, correctional public health experts, including the New York City Board of \nCorrection, have recommended the release from custody of people most vulnerable to COVID-19. \nOn March 17, 2020, they called on New York City to “immediately remove from jail all people at \nhigher risk from COVID-19 infection” and to “drastically reduce the number of people in jail right \nnow and limit new admissions to exceptional circumstances.”38  The Board reasons that “[t]he \nCity’s jails have particular challenges to preventing disease transmission on a normal day and even \nmore so during a public health crisis.”39 Accordingly, the Board recommends that DOC prioritize \nthe release of “[p]eople who are over 50; [and] [p]eople who have underlying health conditions, \nincluding lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or a weakened immune system[.]”40   \n88.  Ross McDonald, the Chief Medical Officer of CHS, publicly called for the release \nfrom Rikers Island of “as many [people] as possible” on Twitter on March 18, 2020:41 \n                                                 \nEMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_08_09_04_14_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_72df992d84-\n0a31827f48-58432543.  \n38 Press Release, N.Y.C.

Similarly, Dr. Rachel Bedard, a geriatrician who works on Rikers Island providing \nmedical care for elderly and ill detainees, explained why effective preventative measures in a jail \nsetting are nearly impossible.  \nYou cannot implement effective social distancing in a room that sleeps forty men. \nYou cannot implement effective social distancing when those forty men are using \ntwo or three sinks and one of them may be broken. You cannot implement effective \nsocial distancing when the staff interacts with all of them and has to touch all of \nthem in the course of a day. . . . [Detainees] don’t have our own cleaning supplies. \nThey can’t wipe down their own surfaces. They have to wait for someone to come \nin and do that for them.42 \nDr. Bedard stated that Rikers’ physicians’ public cry for immediate release of large numbers of \ndetainees is unprecedented but necessary because “the moral calculus has changed and our voices \nneeded to be heard on this issue.”43  Dr. Bedard noted that, to be effective, the DOC must release \n“hundreds of people . . . so that the jail population is decreased enough that you don’t just benefit \nthe people who are released but you also benefit those who are left behind—and the staff who take \ncare of them and the officers who take care of them.”44 \n90.  Likewise, the District Attorneys of New York and Kings County have endorsed a \nplan to identify and release people who are “elderly” or other “[p]opulations that the CDC has \nclassified as vulnerable (those with asthma, cancer, heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes).”45  \n91.  Despite  this  endorsement,  no  such  plans  exist  to  identify  and  release  these \ncategories of people. Instead, the District Attorney of New York has engaged in a limited process \n                                                 \n42 Jennifer Gonnerman, A Rikers Island Doctor Speaks Out to Save Her Elderly Patients from the Coronavirus, New \nYorker Magazine, available at https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-rikers-island-doctor-speaks-out-to-\nsave-her-elderly-patients-from-the-coronavirus (last visited Mar. 22, 2020). \n43 Id.  \n44 Id. \n45 Joint Statement from Elected Prosecutors on COVID-19 and Addressing the Rights and Needs of those in Custody \n(Mar. 18, 2020), https://fairandjustprosecution.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Coronavirus-Sign-On-Letter.pdf.  \n  27 \n \n\nto review individual cases in a time-consuming manner and has refused to consent to the release \nof the vast majority of people despite their age and medical conditions, including Petitioners. \n92.  Courts  and  public  officials  in  other  jurisdictions,  including  in  Los  Angeles, \nCalifornia and parts of Ohio and Texas, have already responded by taking steps to facilitate the \nrelease of elderly and sick prisoners, and to reduce jail populations by refusing the admission to \njails of individuals arrested on certain charges.46  In Iran, one of the first countries to see the \noutbreak of COVID-19, 85,000 inmates were temporarily released back to their communities amid \nvirus concerns.47  \n93.

In a recent court filing seeking the release of federal immigration detainees, Dr. \nMarc Stern, a correctional health expert, has concluded that “[f]or detainees who are at high risk \nof serious illness or death should they contract the COVID-19 virus, release from detention is a \ncritically important way to meaningfully mitigate that risk.” For that reason, Dr. Stern has \nrecommended the “release of eligible individuals from detention, with priority given to the elderly \nand those with underlying medical conditions most vulnerable to serious illness or death if infected \nwith COVID-19.”48 \n95.  Another correctional health expert in that same court case, Dr. Robert Greifinger, \nconcluded that “even with the best-laid plans to address the spread of COVID-19 in detention \nfacilities,  the  release  of  high-risk  individuals  is  a  key  part  of  a  risk  mitigation  strategy.” \nAccordingly, in his opinion, “the public health recommendation is to release high-risk people from \n                                                 \n48Decl. of Dr. Marc Stern ¶¶ 9, 11, Dawson v.

Release protects the people with the greatest vulnerability to COVID-19 from \ntransmission of the virus and also allows for greater risk mitigation for all people held or working \nin prisons and jails.  \n97.  Release of the most vulnerable people also reduces the burden on New York’s \nlimited health care infrastructure, as it lessens the likelihood that an overwhelming number of \npeople will become seriously ill from COVID-19 at the same time. \nFailure to Release Petitioners Constitutes Deliberate Indifference to Serious Medical Harm \n98.  Continuing  to  incarcerate  people  who  have  been  deemed  by  the  CDC  to  be \nespecially vulnerable to a deadly pandemic, in conditions where taking the only known steps to \nprevent transmission are virtually impossible, constitutes deliberate indifference to serious medical \nharm in violation of the United States and New York State constitutions. \n99.  The  Due  Process  clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  proscribes  deliberate \nindifference to the serious medical needs of people held in pre-trial confinement.  Darnell v. \nPineiro, 849 F.3d 17, 29 (2d Cir. 2017). To establish a federal constitutional claim, Petitioners \nmust prove that Respondents (1) acted intentionally to impose the alleged condition, or recklessly \nfailed to act with reasonable care to mitigate the risk that the condition posed to the pretrial detainee \neven though (2) they knew, or should have known, that the condition posed an excessive risk to \nhealth or safety. Id. at 35. The same standard applies to pre-trial detainees held on bail and those \nheld  on  parole  warrants.  Benjamin  v.  Malcolm,  646  F.  Supp.  1550,  1556  (S.D.N.Y.  1986) \n(“[A]lleged parole violators ought not to be treated differently from other detainees, since the \n                                                 \n49 Decl. of Dr. Robert Greifinger ¶ 13, Dawson v.

There is an even stronger due process right to be free from unconstitutional \nconditions of confinement under the New York State Constitution. In Cooper v. Morin, 49 N.Y.2d \n69, 79 (1979), the Court of Appeals concluded that the state due process clause accords even \ngreater protection for pretrial detainees than the federal constitution, holding that “what is required \nis a balancing of the harm to the individual resulting from the condition imposed against the benefit \nsought by the government through its enforcement.” For the government to prevail, it must prove \na “compelling governmental necessity” for any restrictions on pretrial detainees’ liberty interests. \nPeople ex rel. Schipski v. Flood, 88 A.D.2d 197 (2nd Dep’t 1982). This is an “exacting standard.” \nId. The state’s interests are limited to those arising from the “only legitimate purpose for pretrial \ndetention . . . to assure the presence of the detainee for trial.” Id. at 81; see also Schipski, 88 A.D.2d \nat 199-200 (holding county jail’s blanket policy of 22-hour lock-in for a certain category of pretrial \ndetainees violates the state’s due process guarantee); Powlowski v. Wullich, 102 A.D.2d 575, 587 \n(1984) (holding that because a jail’s practice of depriving pretrial detainees of recreation and \nexercise “violates the federal standard, it, a fortiori, must fail the more stringent standard balancing \ntest prescribed for violations of our state due process clause”). \n101.  The U.S. Supreme Court and courts throughout New York have recognized that the \nrisk of contracting a communicable disease constitutes an “unsafe, life-threatening condition” that \nthreatens “reasonable safety.” Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993). See also Jolly v. \n  31 \n \n\nCoughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 477 (2d Cir. 1996) (“[C]orrectional officials have an affirmative obligation \nto protect [forcibly confined] inmates from infectious disease”); Narvaez v. City of New York, No. \n16-CV-1980 (GBD), 2017 WL 1535386, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 17, 2017) (denying “motion to \ndismiss Plaintiff’s claim that the City of New York violated Plaintiff’s rights under the Due Process \nClause by repeatedly deciding to continue housing him with inmates with active-TB” during his \npretrial detention); Bolton v. Goord, 992 F. Supp. 604, 628 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (acknowledging that \nprisoner could state claim under § 1983 for confinement in same cell as inmate with serious \ncontagious disease). \n102.  Respondents are well aware of the extraordinary risk COVID-19 poses to people in \nNew York City jails.  As pleaded above, they have alerted to this risk by the Board of Correction, \ntheir own correctional health service, and at least two of New York’s elected District Attorneys.  \n103.  On March 13, 2020, the Legal Aid Society sent a letter to Respondent the New \nYork City Department of Correction (“DOC”) noting multiple complaints from incarcerated \nclients about the lack of basic sanitation raising concerns about the ability to manage the risk of \nCOVID-19 in New York City jails.50 \n104.  Since  at  least  March  15,  2020,  attorneys  in  the  Legal  Aid  Society’s  Parole \nRevocation Defense Unit have sent lists of medically vulnerable people held on parole warrants, \nincluding several of the Petitioners, to Respondent Department of Correction and Community \nSupervision (“DOCCS”), asking for their urgent release.  \n105.  DOCCS has not responded to these requests. \n                                                 \n50 Letter from Justine Luongo, Attorney-in-Charge, Legal Aid Society Criminal Defense Practice, to Commissioner \nCynthia Brann, N.Y.C. Department of Corrections, and Elizabeth Glazer, Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice (Mar. \n13, 2020), https://legalaidnyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LAS-Letter-to-NYC-re-COVID-19-Preparedness-in-\nCity-Jails.pdf. \n  32 \n \n\n106.  Numerous media outlets have covered these and other calls to action.51 \n107.  Whatever steps Respondents have taken to manage the risk of COVID-19 will fail \nbecause, as pleaded above, Respondents are not capable of managing that risk in a jail environment. \nIndeed, Respondent’s facilities went from just one known case to at least twenty-one cases in \ntwenty-four hours. \n108.  Respondents’ intentional failure to release Petitioners while actually aware of the \nsubstantial risk of COVID-19 plainly constitutes deliberate indifference. \n109.  The affirmative obligation to protect against infectious disease empowers Courts to \nprovide remedies designed to prevent imminent harm to future health. Helling, 509 U.S. at 33 (“It \nwould be odd to deny an injunction to inmates who plainly proved an unsafe, life-threatening \ncondition in their prison on the ground that nothing yet had happened to them.”); Sanchez v. State \nof New York, 99 N.Y.2d 247, 254 (2002) (recognizing that it is “duty of the State, as [petitioner’s] \ncustodian, to safeguard and protect him from the harms it should reasonably foresee based on its \nknowledge derived from operation of a maximum security prison.”). Jabbar v. Fischer, 683 F.3d \n54, 57 (2d Cir. 2012) (“We have held that prisoners may not be deprived of their basic human \nneeds—e.g., food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and reasonable safety—and they may not be \nexposed to conditions that pose an unreasonable risk of serious damage to [their] future health.”) \n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted) \n110.  Immediate release pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus is available to address \nconstitutional violations arising from circumstances or conditions of confinement. People ex rel. \n                                                 \n51 See, e.g., Chelsia Rose Marcius, Coronavirus prompts Legal Aid, Manhattan DA, to call for release of state \nparolees from city jails, N.Y. DAILY NEWS (Mar, 17, 2020) https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-\ncoronavirus-nyc-rikers-island-parole-correction-department-20200317-flg4paly5nesddfbtfkone6hki-story.html; see \nalso supra. \n \n  33 \n \n\nBrown v. Johnston, 9 N.Y.2d 482, 485 (1961) (habeas petition may be used to address “restraint \nin excess of that permitted by . . . constitutional guarantees”); Kaufman v. Henderson, 64 A.D.2d \n849, 850 (4th Dep’t 1978) (“[W]hen appellant claims that he has been deprived of a fundamental \nconstitutional right, habeas corpus is an appropriate remedy to challenge his imprisonment.”). A \nperson is “not to be divested of all rights and unalterably abandoned and forgotten by the remainder \nof society” by virtue of incarceration. Brown, 9 N.Y.2d at 485. Hence, the “right to detain a \nprisoner is entitled to no greater application than its correlative duty to protect him from unlawful \nand onerous treatment[,] mental or physical.” Id. (internal citation omitted). Thus, courts have \naddressed whether the failure to address medical needs has risen to the level of a constitutional \nviolation, requiring immediate release. See, e.g., People ex rel. Kalikow on Behalf of Rosario v. \nScully, 198 A.D.2d 250, 250–51 (2d Dep’t 1993) (habeas petition addressing whether failure to \nprovide  adequate  medical  care  constituted  cruel  and  unusual  punishment  or  deliberate \nindifference). \n111.  The  Court  of  Appeals  has  explained  that  the  State  has  a  duty  “to  protect \n[incarcerated people] from unlawful and onerous treatment, mental or physical.”  Id. at 485 \n(citations omitted). Indeed, habeas relief is the only remedy available in such circumstances. \nPreiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 489 (1973). \n112.  While there is limited precedent on this issue, New York’s habeas jurisprudence in \ngeneral has long contemplated the possibility that habeas claims for release based on conditions \ncould be entertained if a petitioner could establish that the appropriate remedy was release. See \nPeople ex rel. Sandson v Duncan, 306 A.D.2d 716, 716–17 (3d Dept. 2003) (upholding denial of \nthe writ because, “[w]hile success on the instant motion might entitle petitioner to the medication \nhe seeks, it would not excuse him from serving the remainder of his sentence” and reasoning that \n  34 \n \n\n“[h]abeas corpus will be granted only in cases where success would entitle the petitioner to \nimmediate release”); People ex rel. Barnes v. Allard, 807 N.Y.S.2d 688, 689 (3d Dept. 2006) (“As \nfor petitioner’s complaint regarding the correctional facility’s alleged deliberate indifference to his \nmedical needs, . . .  it would not entitle him to immediate release, thus making habeas corpus relief \nunavailable”). \n113.  On March 20, 2020, this Court (Statsinger, J.), denied a similar petition for release \non behalf of 116 other pre-trial detainees on Rikers Island. While the Court has not yet issued an \nopinion in that matter, from the bench the Court indicated that it found those petitioners had not \nmet the standard for deliberate indifference in part because it found that release was not the only \noption available to cure the risk posed to medically vulnerable people in jail. That decision is being \nappealed.  \n114.  These  Petitioners  respectfully  submit  that  in  the  intervening  days,  the  rapid \nescalation of the spread of COVID-19 on Rikers Island and the Respondents’ failure to take \nsufficient steps to adequately reduce the size of the jail population and remove vulnerable people \nwarrants a different conclusion with respect to this Petition. \nRespondents Have Authority to Release Petitioners \n115.  Petitioners have not been committed and are not detained by virtue of any judgment, \ndecree, final order or process of mandate issued by a court or judge of the United States in a case \nwhere such court or judge has exclusive jurisdiction to order him released. \n116.  Petitioners  held  on  parole  warrants  may  be  released  by  Respondent  Annucci \nwithout prejudice to later refiling of parole violation charges after the threat of COVID-19 has \nabated, pursuant to 9 NYCRR §8004.3(e)(i). \n  35 \n \n\n117.  Petitioners are not detained by virtue of any final judgment or decree of a competent \ntribunal or civil or criminal jurisdiction. Petitioners have no other holds. \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court issue a writ of habeas corpus and order \nPetitioners’ immediate release, with appropriate precautionary public health measures, on the \nground that their continued detention violates the Due Process Clause of the United States and \nNew York State constitutions. \n \nDated:  March 24, 2020    Respectfully Submitted, \n             New York, New York \n   \n \n  36 \n \n\n    COREY STOUGHTON \nMARIE NDIAYE \nLAUREN GOTTESMAN \nMICHELLE MCGRATH \nLegal Aid Society \n199 Water Street, 6th Floor \nNew York, NY 10036 \n(646)884-2316 \ncstoughton@legal-aid.org \n \nMARY LYNNE WERLWAS \nVERONICA VELA \nKAYLA SIMPSON \nROBERT QUACKENBUSH \nDAVID BILLINGSLEY \nPrisoners’ Rights Project  \nLegal Aid Society \n199 Water Street, 6th Floor \nNew York, NY 10036 \n(212) 212-577-3530 \nMlwerlwas@legal-aid.org \n \n \n \nAttorneys for Petitioners \n \n \n \n   \n   \n  37 \n \n\n  Corey Stoughton, an attorney admitted to practice law in the State of New York, states that \nshe has read the foregoing petition and that same is true to her own knowledge, except for those \nportions stated on information and belief, for which citations are provided. \nDated: March 24, 2020 \n  New York, NEW YORK \n   \n \n \n                                                    \n              Corey Stoughton \n  38 \n ",

I  am  Assistant  Corporation  Counsel  assigned  to  the  above-captioned \nproceeding.  I submit this affirmation in opposition to petitioner’s Verified Petition for Writ of \nHabeas Corpus, dated March 25, 2020, seeking an order directing the immediate release of 32 \n\npersons in the custody of the New York City Department of Correction (“DOC”) pursuant to \nC.P.L.R. § 7001. \n2.  Petitioner’s request should be denied for two reasons: (1) the Petition is \nbarred as a successive abuse of the writ following the denial of essentially the identical writ \nwhich was brought and denied on March 20, 2020 by Justice Steven Statsinger, In the Matter of \nPetition for release Venus Williams, et al., SCID No. 20042-20 (“Prior Writ”); and (2) the \nPetition fails to state a cause of action because the DOC is actively working to ensure the health \nand safety of persons in DOC custody through extensive sanitary and training efforts to combat \nthe COVID-19 epidemic, as set forth in detail below and in the accompanying Affidavit of \nPatricia Sweeney dated March 25, 2020 (“Sweeney Aff.”), DOC’s Deputy Commissioner for \nQuality Assurance and Integrity.    \nA.  The Petition Must Be Dismissed as an Abuse of the Writ due to the Substantially \nSimilar Prior Writ Having Been Heard on the Merits and Denied.. \n3.  It  is  well-settled  that  while  the  doctrine  of  res  judicata  does  not  bar \nsuccessive writs brought by the same party, courts will normally dismiss a successive writ \ncontaining nothing new. See e.g., People ex rel. Anderson v. Warden, N.Y.C. Correctional \nInstitution For Men, 68 Misc. 2d 463, 325 N.Y.S.2d 829 (Sup. Ct. Bronx County 1971) (citing \nWeinstein, Korn & Miller); People ex rel. Gonzalez v. Deegan, 29 A.D.2d 865, 288 N.Y.S.2d \n362 (2d Dep’t 1968) (writ denied where writ had been previously denied).  Indeed, in McCleskey \nv. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 111 S. Ct. 1454, 113 L. Ed. 2d 517 (1991), the Supreme Court has held \nthat when the government pleads abuse of the writ in response to a successive petition, the \npetitioner must demonstrate why a successive writ is not an abuse of the writ.  \n4.  Here, while the petitioners are different parties than those presented in the \nPrior Writ, the argument is identical to the one presented by the same counsel who argued the \n  - 2 -   \n \n\nPrior Writ before the Court on March 20, 2020 in that it seeks a mass release of persons in DOC \ncustody alleging that DOC is deliberately indifferent to the health and safety of the petitioners. \n5.  On March 20, 2020, Justice Statsinger held that: \nTHE COURT:   I am going to deny the petition for writ of habeas corpus. I’m not \ngoing to make a long ruling now. I will eventually file something in writing. I am \nnot prepared in this case that the constitutional standard of deliberate indifference \nis  met.  Deliberate  indifference,  in  general,  requires  a  dangerous  condition; \nknowledge, either actual or constructive, on the part of the incarcerating agency, \nand the failure to take any steps to remedy. In this case although the first two are \nsatisfied, there is a dangerous condition of a sort that is truly unprecedented, and \nthe Department Of Corrections, clearly, knows about it. I’m simply not prepared \nto find either that Corrections has done nothing to remedy the situation, or that \nrelease is the only way to mitigate the harm. \n \nSee Transcript attached hereto as Ex. A (emphasis added).  It is without question that the current \npetition presented the exact same argument presented in the Prior Writ. See  e.g. Williams \npetition, SCID No. 20042-20, annexed hereto as Ex. B.   For this reason alone, this petition \nshould be denied  as an abuse of the writ. \nB.  The Petition Should Be Dismissed Because Petitioners Have Not Shown that the \nDepartment of Correction is Deliberately Indifferent to the Petitioners’ Rights. \n6.  As  set  forth  in  the  accompanying  Affidavit  of  Patricia  Sweeney,  the \nDeputy Commissioner of Quality Assurance and Integrity, dated March 25, 2020 (“Sweeny \nAff.”), DOC has undertaken substantial efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure \nthe health and safety of persons in DOC custody to the greatest extent possible. See Sweeney \nAff. annexed as Ex. C. \n7.  With a substantial professional background in both health and sanitation, \nMs.  Sweeney  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  DOC  and  its  staff  are  adhering  to  the  rules \nmandated by regulatory agencies and its internal policies. Ms. Feeney explains that she has “been \ninstrumental in ramping up DOC sanitation protocols and comprehensive cleaning measures to \ncombat [COVID-19’s]  spread throughout our facilities.  This includes implementing enhanced \n  - 3 -   \n \n\ncleaning and sanitizing procedures in areas with a lot of traffic, which include hallways and \nbathrooms.”  See Ex. C ¶ 7. \n8.  As the Sweeney Aff. makes clear, DOC’s efforts are comprehensive and \nongoing. See Ex. C.  Petitioner cannot meet their burden of showing that DOC is deliberately \nindifferent to the health and safety of the petitioners.  Accordingly, the petition should be denied. \n9.  For the foregoing reasons, Respondent respectfully requests that the Court \ndismiss the Verified Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and deny the relief requested therein in \nits entirety, together with such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper. \n \nDated:  New York, New York \nMarch 25, 2020 \n             /s/ \nMartin Bowe \nCc:  COREY STOUGHTON \nMARIE NDIAYE \nLAUREN GOTTESMAN \nMICHELLE MCGRATH \nLegal Aid Society \n199 Water Street, 6th Floor \nNew York, NY 10036 \n(646) 884-2316 \ncstoughton@legal \n  - 4 -   \n ",

Mary Lynne Werlwas, Esq. \n \nThe Legal Aid Society \n \nRobert Briere, Esq. \n \nfor Petitioner Nicholas Kilgore \n \n \nFor Respondents: \n \nMartin Bowe, Esq. \n \nNew York City Law Department \n \nfor Respondent Cynthia Brann \nJames Cooney, Esq. \n \nNew York State Department of Law \n \nfor Respondent Anthony Annucci \nPatricia Bailey, Esq. \n \nNew York County District Attorney's Office \n \nfor Respondents \n \n \nMark Dwyer, J. \nPetitioners, 32 inmates at the Rikers Island prison, have demanded release on due process \ngrounds. Each petitioner faces one or more charges in New York County. Many are also \n\nincarcerated pending hearings on alleged parole violations. Their complaint concerns the Covid-\n19 pandemic. Petitioners contend that they are particularly vulnerable to serious injury and death \nshould they contract the disease. And they assert that prisoners at Rikers are dangerously likely \nto contract it, to the point that continued confinement there violates their due process rights under \nthe federal and state constitutions. \nThe only relief sought is release. The court will grant release, sometimes with conditions, to \na fair number of petitioners. This opinion explains why. But this opinion will not do two other \nthings. It will not describe the nature of the Covid-19 pandemic, as it is far too [*2]familiar to \nNew Yorkers already. And it will deal with the circumstances of individual petitioners only \nbriefly, as examples to explain particular points. \nA \nThe health of prison inmates is the business of governments who incarcerate them. Indeed, \nit has long been settled that the United States Constitution requires the government to provide \neffective medical care for inmates. Brown v. Plata, 563 US 493, 508-09 (2011); Farmer v. \nBrennan, 511 US 825, 832-33 (1994); Estelle v. Gamble, 429 US 97 (1976). These decisions \ninvolved convicted prisoners, and were decided under the Eighth Amendment. But the Due \nProcess protections of the 5th and 14th Amendments and of the New York Constitution provide \ncomparable protection to pretrial inmates. See, e.g., Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 576 US ___ \n(2015); Cooper v. Marin, 49 NY2d 69 (1979). That makes sense, as it could not be thought that \npretrial detainees should enjoy less protection than convicted inmates. Contemporary law as to \nthe rights of all prisoners simply \"codif[ies] the commonlaw view that 'it is but just that the \npublic be required to care for the prisoner, who cannot by reason of the deprivation of his liberty, \ncare for himself.'\" Estelle v. Gamble, 429 US at 103-04, supra. \nTo invoke the federal due process clause successfully, a petitioner may establish that the \ngovernment's actions impose a serious, medically threatening condition on prisoners. \nAlternatively, and to the point here, the petitioner may show that the government failed to act \n\"with reasonable care\" to mitigate a risk created by a seriously threatening prison condition, even \n\nthough the responsible authorities knew or should have known that the condition posed an \nexcessive risk to the health or safety of the inmates. Helling v. McKinney, 509 US 25, 331-32 \n(1993). The cases differ on precisely how to interpret the mens rea requirement, and in particular \non whether the prison officials must be aware of the danger. Compare Darnell v Pineiro, 849 \nF3d 17 (2nd Cir 2017) with Caiozzo v. Koreman, 581 F3d 63 (2nd Cir 2009). But the issue is \nmoot here. There is no doubt that Rikers officials are aware of the Covid-19 threat. The New \nYork due process test is simpler. A court weighs the benefit sought by the government from a \ncondition against the harm that the condition imposes on inmates. Cooper v. Morin, 49 NY2d at \n79, supra. \nIf the government cannot satisfy the due process requirement, the court must accord a \nremedy — including, where appropriate, release from prison. Brown v. Plata, 563 US at \n511, supra. Courts \"must not shrink from their obligation to 'enforce the constitutional rights of \nall , including prisoners.' Courts may not allow constitutional violations to continue simply \nbecause a remedy would involve intrusion into the realm of prison administration.\" Id. (citation \nomitted). Notably, Brown itself approved an order requiring the release of numerous convicted \nCalifornia prisoners unless the state quickly relieved long-standing prison overcrowding \nthat, inter alia, threatened the health of the inmates. \nThere can be no doubt that the presence of a communicable disease in a prison can \nconstitute a serious, medically threatening condition. The point need not be belabored in this \ncase. Covid-19 is at large at Rikers Island. The current epidemic poses a deadly threat to inmates, \nand its presence at the prison equates to an \"unsafe, life-threatening condition\" endangering \n\"reasonable safety.\" See Helling v. McKinney, 509 US at 33, supra. Given such circumstances \nand the absence of a viable alternative, a court has no choice but to order release. Brown v. Plata, \n563 US at 511, supra. \nRespondents do not deny that much. They assert, however, that Corrections officials at \nRikers Island have not been \"deliberately indifferent\" to the danger. To the contrary, they \nmaintain, officials at Rikers have sought diligently to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 disease \namong the inmates. They assert that they have provided soap and cleaning supplies that allow \n\npetitioners and their fellow prisoners to protect themselves from the virus. They also urge the \ninmates to engage in \"social distancing,\" i.e., to maintain a distance of six feet between \nthemselves and other inmates. Some inmates have been released with the consent of the District \nAttorney. Thus, respondents assert, they have satisfied the constitutional mandate by taking \n\"reasonable care\" to mitigate the risk of the disease. It follows, they continue, that no due process \nviolation has occurred, and no remedy is due petitioners. \n \n \nB \nThis court disagrees. A look at the conditions at Rikers Island explains why. \nFirst, communicable diseases could not ask for a better breeding ground than a crowded \nprison. Rikers facilities are crowded. Prisoners eat in communal dining rooms. Cooking is done \nby inmates and the food is dished out by inmates. Entertainment is found in common rooms. \nMany detainees reside in barracks-style dormitories. Many have a neighbor who sleeps less than \nsix feet to the side. The inmates share sinks, showers, and toilets. Much of the space is so \ncramped that the inmates are physically unable to stay far enough from their fellow prisoners to \nbe safe from the risk of contagion. Moreover, for many prisoners, a natural concomitant of \nconfinement is a desire to associate in groups with one another. They communicate face-to-face, \nwithout the luxury of Skype or twitter. And, as elsewhere, even individuals without apparent \nCovid-19 symptoms can spread disease in all these areas and situations. \nBeyond that, inmates in a local urban jail like Rikers are constantly exposed to additional \npotential sources of contagion. Arrests do not stop for a plague. New inmates arrive daily from \naround New York City. Every day, members of the prison staff commute to the prison from their \nhomes in the city and its nearby suburbs. Until the epidemic hit this city, on five days a week \ninmates were taken in crowded and unsanitary buses to crowded and unsanitary courthouse \nholding pens. \n\nSecond, these conditions have produced the results one might expect. Diagnoses of the \ndisease are \"spiking\" at Rikers — exponentially. As of March 20 it had reported that one case of \nthe disease had been diagnosed at the prison. On March 21, 21 inmates and 17 members of the \nstaff were reported ill from the virus, and one member of the staff was dead. By March 24, the \nday the petition was filed, there were a reported 39 cases. By April 1, 184 prisoners and 179 \nmembers of the staff were ill. As this opinion is being issued, the most recent report is that on \nApril 2 there were 231 sick prisoners, in addition to 223 sick staff members. The rate of increase \nis about 5 times higher than that of New York City in general — and the rate in New York City, \nthe national \"epicenter\" of Covid-19, has dramatically exceeded that of the rest of the country. \nThe New York City Board of Correction, established by the City Charter, is an independent \noversight board charged with regulating, monitoring, and inspecting the city's correctional \nfacilities. On March 21 the Board issued an advisory letter to judges and prosecutors calling for \nthe release of prisoners over 50 years old who have conditions placing [*3]them at high risk if \nthey contract Covid-19. Many of the petitioners are among those at risk. The Board's plea has \nsince been joined by Ross MacDonald, the Chief Medical Officer of the Correctional Health \nServices, and Rachel Bernard, a geriatrician at Rikers. For whatever it might be worth, the press \nreports that inmates feel helpless, with some suggesting that they are facing a \"death sentence.\" \nAnd it is critically important to remember that petitioners have been convicted of nothing. They \ninstead face contested charges. \nUnder the best of circumstances, there are far better places to be than Rikers Island. And \nthese are not the best of circumstances. \n \n \nC \nBefore the law is applied to the facts of this case, one final point should be made. The \nexperts agree on the best practices to avoid the Covid-19 virus — frequent hand-washing, \ncovering coughs and sneezes, social distancing, and so on. They also agree on this critical factor: \nthe individuals who catch the disease face differing consequences. It was originally thought that \n\nthe young rarely were in serious danger from the disease. That conclusion is now subject to \nserious doubt. But the experts agree that certain pre-existing conditions are aggravators. \nAge is among them. Different estimates are given — age 50, 60, 65, 70 — as to when the \ncalendar presents a special threat of harm from the virus. The current CDC number is 65. The \ndifferent estimates are natural enough. Unlike the law, nature and its diseases do not respect a \nbright line crossed on a particular birthday. But it is agreed that infected individuals of a \nrelatively advanced age are likely to suffer more than the young. \nAge is not often thought of as a disease. The other conditions classified as aggravators are. \nCovid-19 attacks the respiratory system. Accordingly, pre-existing respiratory inhibitors like \nserious asthma or chronic lung disease can complicate a patient's Covid-19 symptoms. \nCombating the virus is a task for the immune system, and those afflicted with HIV or another \ncondition that weakens the immune system can be at special risk. Covid-19 puts a strain on the \nheart, and therefore serious heart conditions can expose an individual to extra danger. Diabetics \nand those afflicted with some other diseases may have issues on more than one of these fronts. \nPetitioners do not argue that it violates due process to hold at Rikers a young prisoner who \nhas no aggravating conditions. Instead, each contends that, while infection at Rikers is quite \nlikely for all inmates, for those with aggravators the danger after Covid-19 strikes is much \ngreater than the danger facing their fellows. Each petitioner claims to have one or more \naggravating conditions. And each concludes that holding him or her at Rikers, where the \nprospect of Covid-19 infection is so great, must be deemed a violation of his or her rights. \n \n \nD \nThe stage is set for consideration of how due process principles apply here. Respondents \nassert that they have taken \"reasonable care\" to mitigate the risk posed by Covid-19, and thus \nhave satisfied the due process mandate. This court disagrees. \n\nThis judge does not at all question the good faith of the Rikers officials. Certainly \nno [*4]American prison is equipped to deal with a health crisis of the severity of this one. Rikers \nhas medical facilities, but it is not a hospital — and this epidemic is a fierce challenge even for \nour hospitals. A crowded prison, for example, has no ability to quarantine the large number of \nprisoners exposed to inmates who eventually display symptoms. Indeed, in this case that would \nessentially mean a quarantine of everyone at the prison, inmates and staff. There certainly are not \nthe necessary kits to administer tests for the disease to all inmates, much less the repeated tests \nrequired to assess their condition at subsequent times. And the ability to allow adequate distance \nto be maintained among detainees and staff is decisively precluded by the nature of prison \nconstruction and operation — as noted, for example, barracks-like sleeping quarters and \ncommunal dining. Even hand sanitizer, now a staple tool for preventing spread of the disease, \ncannot be employed: its alcohol content makes it contraband, a danger to prisoners who might \ndrink it and to guards who, because the alcohol content is high, fear that it can we used as a \nweapon. \nDue process does not excuse prison officials who mean well, but have no effective way to \nprotect inmates from potentially fatal epidemics. Again, prison officials are obliged to take \n\"reasonable care\" to mitigate the risk posed by Covid-19. That is so especially for prisoners who \ncan fairly expect extremely serious consequences if they contract the disease. \"Reasonable care\" \nand \"mitigation\" obligations are not satisfied by tossing a bucket of water on a four-alarm house \nfire, or by placing a band-Aid on a compound bone fracture. Reasonable care to mitigate must \ninclude an effort to employ an effective ameliorative measure. As would be expected when the \nDepartment of Corrections' own doctors ask for release, the escalating numbers of the infected \nshow that what Rikers has done is not remotely effective. Prisoners with dangerous conditions \nare dramatically at risk. For some of them, only release can offer protection. \nAt this point, the court has ruled that 18 petitioners are in this category. (A few other \npetitioners have been released on consent or on bail). All 18 are afflicted with conditions \nacknowledged to endanger them: heart disease, serious respiratory conditions, cancer, diabetes, \nuncontrolled HIV, and so forth. For some of them, the condition or conditions are more \n\ndangerous because those prisoners are relatively old. Those 18 petitioners have been ordered \nreleased. \nFor others, the petition has been denied. Some of the inmates are between 50 and 60 years \nold, and have nothing beyond that to suggest that they are in more danger than the average \ninmate. This judge does not believe that to be sufficient to justify release. One petitioner also has \nglaucoma; that ocular condition is not reported to complicate Covid-19. One has HIV, but the \ncondition is well controlled. The petitioner's viral count is easily low enough, and the T-cell \ncount high enough, to take the condition out of the category of an enhanced threat. One petitioner \nwas convincingly shown by his medical history to be a malingerer, in no special danger at all. \nThese are not normal times. Courthouses are almost completely closed. Staffing is short — \njudges, court officers, court reporters, clerks, and IT employees. The ability of Rikers Island \nofficials to arrange internet conferences with inmates is very limited. Medical records are not \navailable. Expert medical witnesses are, to say the least, occupied. But the claims of these \npetitioners, and hundreds of other inmates who believe they are in immediate danger, deserve \nto [*5]be treated as emergency questions for courts and other officials who can grant release. \nPerhaps two months from now, when the disease has abated, the courtrooms will reopen, weeks \ncan be spent marshaling evidence, and cross-examinations can be conducted. But there is no time \nto wait — the issues will be moot. The court's conclusions about inmate conditions had to be \nbased on the records available to the parties, the lawyers' phone calls to busy experts, work on \nthe internet, and Skype conversations held in the absence of affected petitioners. \nThree final notes should be made. First, for a court to order a release of prisoners on \naccount of a due process violation is \"a matter of undoubted, grave concern.\" Brown v. Plata, \n563 US at 501, supra. Still, this judge does not believe that release can be denied even to those \ncharged with violent crimes if they are at substantial risk of death or other serious physical \ninjury. Such inmates have the same due process rights as others. They may be treated differently \nfrom others, even in a pretrial context. Some can be shackled. Some can be subjected to unusual \nintrusions on privacy. Some can be isolated from other inmates. Even under New York law, \nsome charges justify assessments of dangerousness that can lead to higher bail or remand. But \n\nthese prisoners cannot be punished with the unnecessary exposure to a highly communicable, \nand for them a potentially deadly, disease. Thus, one of the inmates ordered released is a man \nwho is over 60, suffers from very serious heart conditions, has a chronic obstructive pulmonary \ncondition as well as asthma, is diabetic — and is charged with a vicious murder. \nSecond, and relatedly, what has been ordered for petitioners is temporary release. No \ncharges are being dismissed. The inmates facing criminal charges will still face those charges. \nThe inmates on parole will remain on parole, and the relevant parole violation allegations can be \npursued. Moreover, the court has agreed with restrictions on release suggested by the \ngovernment. For example, for some petitioners home confinement except for visits to mental \nhealth services has been directed. The petitioners cannot legitimately complain; at least they will \nnot be confined on Rikers Island. \nFinally, the petition sought relief only on the ground that the petitioners are in special \ndanger if they become infected. Nothing in this opinion necessarily applies to how inmates \nwithout such conditions should be treated. \n \n \nENTER: \n \n \nDated: New York, New York \n \nApril 6, 2020 \n \n________________________ \n \nMark Dwyer, J. \n \n \nAppearances of Counsel: \n \n ",
