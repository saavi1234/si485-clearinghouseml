Represented by the Legal Aid Society of New York, the petitioners sought immediate release on the grounds that continuing to hold them in these facilities constitutes deliberate indifference to the risk of serious medical harm in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and state constitutional right to due process. The respondent in this case was the Commission of New York City Administration of Children's Services.</p>\r\n<p>The petitioners alleged that they were especially vulnerable to contracting COVID-19 due to physical design of the youth detention facilities. By design, the facilities hold youth in close congregate settings which shared dining rooms, common recreational areas, communal bathrooms and showers, and at some sites, shared bedrooms. The petition claimed that the social isolation measures needed to stop the spread of the virus are \"effectively impossible in juvenile detention centers.\" The petition also noted \"significant emotional harm\" to the youth because of an end to visits by family members to detained teens. In addition, the petition claimed that the teens were more vulnerable to COVID-19 because juvenile detainees are more likely to suffer from asthma and other health issues linked to poverty.</p>\r\n<p>On April 15, 2020, the parties stipulated to withdrawing their petition with respect to 4 of the 5 teens.</p>\r\n<p>On April 17, 2020 Judge Michael L. Katz issued an order denying the petition for habeas corpus, finding that the petitioners had been \"unable to meet their high burden of showing that respondent [had] been 'deliberately indifferent.'\" Even so, the court ordered that respondents should: (1) ensure that necessary personal protective equipment be worn by all staff members; (2) increase oversight to ensure social distancing was followed; and (3) issue clearer guidelines for cleaning the facility.</p>",

Social distancing strategies have been employed which include: explanation to staff regarding \nthe use of social distancing, limiting movement within a facility,  limiting youth recreational \nactivities to avoid contact between youth, and having youth separated from each other during \nmeal times and/or staggering meal times whenever possible.  Youth in secure detention facilities \nare housed  in units with individual bedrooms.  Youth  in  non-secure detention facilities  are \ncurrently no more than two youth to a bedroom and are able to sleep at least six feet apart from \neach other. \n9.  In an effort to reduce potential spread by person-to-person contact and protect youth, all in \nperson  visitation  has  been  suspended.  Additional  phones  calls  are  provided  to  youth  to \ncommunicate with families and significant others as practicable and we are increasing our tete \nvisiting capabilities, effective 3/30/20 to enable families to communicate with youth via other \nplatforms such as Skype. \n10. Staff are instructed to stay home if they feel ill or have been in close contact with someone who \nis symptomatic or ill.  Staff who either appear ill or express being ill or not feeling well, are \nimmediately instructed to return home and to follow up with medical personnel and only return \nwhen a note from a doctor clearing the return is presented. \n11.  In conjunction with medical staff stationed in both secure and non-secure detention, ACS and all \nmedical staff are instructed to self-monitor for any symptoms of Covid-19 twice a day and must \nask themselves the following questions: \na.  Do I have a fever at or above 10 0 degrees? \nb.  Do I have a new cough? \n2 \n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 03/27/2020 12:54 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC.

Do I have a new sore throat? \nIf the answer to any of those questions are yes, the staff must report to their supervisor and be \nimmediately sent home. \n12. Staff are  instructed to ask  youth the same four questions  as  above with the first  question \nmodified to ask if youth thinks they may have a fever.  If the answer to any of the questions is \nyes, the staff must immediately take the youth to the medical unit for an assessment. \n13. For youth in secure detention for whom the answer above is Yes, these youth shall be isolated in \nthe Special Housing Unit (SHU) or a designated room and provided a surgical mask.  Contact \nwith the clinically symptomatic COVID-19 youth will be limited to medical staff and designated \nfacility security staff who will be using a surgical mask or N95 mask during all encounters. If \nsymptoms are severe, medical shall immediately notify EMS and facilitate  a transfer to the \nemergency room for testing, further work-up and appropriate treatment. Youth will remain in the \nSHU for observation, and medical will determine disposition based on assessment over time. \nIsolation for symptomatic youth will last until youth is asymptomatic for at least 72 hours. \nSoap/Facility Cleaning \n14. As part of its response to COVID-19, further, sanitation work details are regularly assigned to \nsanitize the  facilities,  including  housing  areas,  bathrooms,  showers, and sinks.  Preventive \nsanitation and cleaning measures include: cleaning high contact surfaces that are touched by \nmany different people, such as light switches, handrails and doorknobs/handles, cleaning shower \nareas daily; cleaning and disinfecting counters, tables, and chairs regularly (at least once daily) \ncleaning and sanitizing transport vehicles daily; any vehicle that is transporting a person who is \nsymptomatic  of respiratory  illness  will  be  sanitized  immediately  after  transporting  that \nindividual. \n15. Staff are instructed to have youth wash hands more frequently, for the recommended amount of \ntime, and youth are counseled to avoid touching their face. \n16. All housing areas are equipped with an adequate supply of soap and any staff member may \nrequest additional soap if needed. \n17. Staff are expected to take the necessary steps to ensure there is an adequate supply of soap and \nsanitizing products available for their assigned work areas.

Petitioners are youth, between the ages of 13 and 17, detained by Family Courts in \nsecure and non-secure detention centers in New York City during the pendency of their juvenile \ndelinquency cases.  By physical design, these facilities house youth in close congregate settings, \nwith shared dining rooms, common recreational areas, communal bathrooms and showers, and, at \nsome sites, shared bedrooms.  Considering the extraordinarily dangerous nature of the COVID-19 \npandemic, with its extremely high degree of contagion and its transmission rate in New York City \ngrowing at an alarming pace, these youth are extremely vulnerable to infection by the virus and to \nits potentially devastating consequences.  This petition seeks the immediate release from detention \nof these youth on the grounds that continuing to hold them in these facilities constitutes deliberate \n \n2 Petitioners exclude youth with holds from entities other than New York City Family Courts.  This petition excludes \nany individual youth for whom, after consultation with counsel and based on the likelihood of negative consequences, \na decision is made not be included. \n  3 \n \n3 of 28\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 03/25/2020 06:14 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC. NO. 1 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 03/25/2020\nindifference to the risk of serious medical harm in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and \nstate constitutional right to due process.  \n2.  In only a few months,  300,227 people worldwide have been diagnosed with \nCOVID-19 and nearly 13,000 of those people have died. There is no vaccine or cure for COVID-\n19.  No one is immune. \n3.  Risk mitigation in the form of social distancing and isolation is the only known \nstrategy to protect individuals from COVID-19.   To that end, in an unprecedented Executive Order, \nNew York State Governor Andrew Cuomo has directed all New York State residents to stay at \nhome, not go to work, and refrain from engaging in any and all unnecessary physical contact with \nothers.  Because risk mitigation is effectively impossible in juvenile detention centers, experts \nfrom youth correctional facilities all over the country have called for the immediate release of \ndetained youth to their homes to be safely cared for by family, and if family is unavailable, to be \nmoved to foster homes or similar non-congregate settings.  Release is the only effective means of \nprotecting these youth from contracting and transmitting COVID-19 between detained youth and \nof reducing the risk of exposure to staff working there.  Further, with appropriate safeguards in \nplace, including enhanced monitoring, these youth can be safely cared for in their homes. \n4.  COVID-19 already has reached New York City’s youth detention facilities, with \nboth detained youth and staff testing positive for the virus.  Continuing to maintain these youths \nin this hotbed of contagion poses an unconscionable and entirely preventable risk of harm to \nPetitioners.  Across New York City, extraordinary and unprecedented measures affecting every \naspect of life are being taken in the name of protecting people from this pandemic. New York \ncannot  leave  these  young  and  susceptible  individuals  behind  to  suffer  potentially  dire \nconsequences.   \n  4 \n \n4 of 28\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 03/25/2020 06:14 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC.

Upon information and belief, \nonly approximately 22 youth are currently in juvenile detention.  These youth can be safely \nmaintained and monitored in the community during the pendency of their family court without \nsubjecting them to the unreasonable risk to their health of holding them in congregate juvenile \ndetention facilities.  \nPARTIES \n6.  I am the Director of the Special Litigation Unit of the Legal Aid Society’s Juvenile \nRight Practice. I make this application on behalf of the below-named Petitioners. \n7.  Petitioners are youth ages 13-17 in secure and non-secure detention facilities \ncontrolled by Respondent New York City Administration for Children’s Services. As a result, they \nare at high risk for contracting COVID-19. \n8.  Respondent  David  Hansell  is  the  Commissioner  of  the  New  York  City \nAdministration for Children’s Services. Respondent is a legal custodian of Petitioners. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  This court has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter under CPLR § 7001. \n10.

COVID-19 is a coronavirus that has reached pandemic status. As of March 22, 2020, \nover 335,403 people worldwide have confirmed diagnoses, including over 33,889 people in the \nUnited States and 16,887 in New York. Indeed, as of March 22, New York state reportedly has \n5% of the world’s COVID-19 cases.  Over 9,324 people have died, including at least 149 in the \n3\nUnited States and 65 in New York City. As the number of COVID-19 cases spike, New York City \nis now the U.S. COVID-19 Virus Epicenter.  As of March 22, 2020, there are more than 16,887 \n4\nconfirmed cases of coronavirus within New York, up from 4,627 the prior day, and at least 150 \ndeaths.   \n5\n13.  The World Health Organization (“WHO”) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.   \n6\nOn March 7, 2020, the Governor of the State of New York issued Executive Order Number 202, \ndeclaring a disaster emergency for the entire State of New York.   Subsequently, the Mayor of \n7\nNew York City declared a State of Emergency for the City.

On March 20, 2020, as the number of new cases continued to rise at an astounding \nrate throughout the country, and with New York City identified as the epicenter of the virus, the \nGovernor took the strictest measure yet to fight its spread, issuing a “stay at home” executive order \nfor all residents.  In a statement to the public, Governor Cuomo explained that the order prohibits \nnon-essential gatherings of any size, requires all non-essential businesses to close, and 100 percent \nof their employees to work from home, and that people should stay at least six feet away from \nothers.  “Reducing density,” the Governor said, is, along with increasing hospital capacity, the \nmost “effective way” of winning the “war against this pandemic.”  \n10\n15.  The transmission of COVID-19 is expected to grow exponentially. Nationally, \nprojections by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) indicate that over 200 \nmillion people in the United States could be infected with COVID-19 over the course of the \npandemic without effective public health intervention, with as many as 1.5 million deaths in the \nmost severe projections.  \n 11\n16.  COVID-19 is a particularly contagious disease. A recent study showed that the \nvirus could survive for up to three hours in the air, four hours on copper, up to twenty-four hours \non cardboard, and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel.   Indeed, a new study of \n12\nan early cluster of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China revealed the dangers of indirect transmission \nresulting from infected people contaminating common surfaces—in the study, it was a communal \nmall bathroom.   New research also shows that controlling the spread of COVID-19 is made even \n13\n \n10 https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-announces-deployment-\n1000-bed-hospital-ship-usns. \n11 Chas Danner, CDC’s Worst-Case Coronavirus Model: 214 Million Infected, 1.7 Million Dead, N.Y.

There is no vaccine for COVID-19. No one is immune.   \n18.  While older individuals face greater chances of serious illness or death from \nCOVID-19,  it is now known that the younger population is just as susceptible of contracting the \n15\nvirus and may fall as ill as older people.  In a virtual press conference held on March 20, 2020, \nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that younger people are not only \nnot spared of contagion, but worldwide, they make up a “significant proportion” of patients \nrequiring hospitalization, sometimes for weeks and sometimes resulting in their deaths.   And \n16\neven when asymptomatic or suffering milder symptoms, these younger individuals still pose a very \nserious risk of transmission to those with whom they come into contact, including older, more \nvulnerable  adults.    Indeed,  for  these  reasons,  New  York  City  Mayor  DeBlasio  took  the \nextraordinary step of closing all New York City schools.  \n17\n19.

Youth involved in the juvenile justice system are generally less healthy than their \npeers.  They are more likely to go for long stretches without health insurance, and as they get older, \nmore likely than the general population to engage in sexual behavior that puts them at risk for HIV, \nAIDS, and other sexually transmitted infections.   \n18\n21.  Moreover, recent news reports suggest people under eighteen are dying and falling \ngravely ill from the disease.   \n19\n22.  The vast majority of youth in juvenile detention are black or Hispanic and come \nfrom poor communities in New York City.   It is well documented that these communities suffer \n20\nhigh rates of asthma prevalence.   Indeed, one in four in children in poor neighborhoods in New \nYork City have been found to have asthma.    And according to one recent study, 1 in 5 New York \n21\nCity teens has undiagnosed asthma.    \n22\n \n18  To  Reduce  Long-Term  Health  Gaps,  a  Push  for  Early  Intervention  in  Juvenile  Detention,  Chris \nSalvo/Getty.https://undark.org/2018/07/16/juvenile-detention-health-care-racial-disparities/.  \n19 https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-24/california-coronavirus-cases-surge-to-2-200-the-worst-is-\nyet-to-come; https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/22/us/georgia-coronavirus-girl-hospitalized/index.html. \n20 In fiscal year 2018, 66.9% of all NYC youth admitted to secure detention facilities in 2018 self-identified as black \nand 28.5% identified as Hispanic; similarly, 67% of those admitted to non-secure detention facilities identified as \nblack and 26% as Hispanic.  https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/acs/pdf/data-analysis/2019/LL44DDRFY19.pdf.

The CDC has warned that people with asthma are at higher risk of getting very sick \nfrom COVID-19, which may affect the respiratory tract (nose, throat, lungs), cause an asthma \nattack, and possibly lead to pneumonia and acute respiratory disease.  \n23\n24.  For people with medical conditions that increase the risk of serious COVID-19 \ninfection, symptoms such as fever, coughing and shortness of breath can be especially severe.  \n24\n25.  COVID-19  can  cause  severe  damage  to  lung  tissue,  sometimes  leading  to  a \npermanent loss of respiratory capacity, and can damage tissues in other vital organs including the \nheart and liver. Patients with serious cases of COVID-19 require advanced medical support, \nincluding positive pressure ventilation and extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation in intensive \ncare. Patients who do not die from serious cases of COVID-19 may face prolonged recovery \nperiods, including extensive rehabilitation from neurological damage and loss of respiratory \ncapacity. \n26.  COVID-19 may also target the heart muscle, causing a medical condition known \nas myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle. Myocarditis can affect the heart muscle and \nelectrical system, reducing the heart’s ability to pump. This reduction can lead to rapid or abnormal \nheart rhythms in the short term, and long-term heart failure that limits exercise tolerance and ability \nto work. \n27.  Emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 can also trigger an over-response of \nthe immune system, further damaging tissues in a cytokine release syndrome that can result in \nwidespread damage to other organs, including permanent injury to the kidneys and neurologic \ninjury. \n \n23 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/asthma.html. \n24 Id. \n  10 \n \n10 of 28\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 03/25/2020 06:14 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC.

Patients can show the first \nsymptoms of infection in as little as two days after exposure, and their condition can seriously \ndeteriorate in as little as five days or sooner. \n29.  The need for care, including intensive care, and the likelihood of death, is much \nhigher from COVID-19 than from influenza. According to recent estimates, the fatality rate of \npeople infected with COVID-19 is about ten times higher than a severe seasonal influenza, even \nin advanced countries with highly effective health care systems. According to preliminary data \nfrom China, 20 percent of people in high-risk categories who contracted COVID-19 there died.   \n25\n30.  There is no cure for COVID-19 nor is there any known medication to prevent or \ntreat infection.  \n31.  The only known methods to reduce the risk for vulnerable people of serious illness \nor death from COVID-19 are to prevent infection in the first place through social distancing and \nimproved hygiene, including frequent hand washing with soap and water.  \nYouth in Detention Facilities Face an Elevated Risk of COVID-19 Transmission \n32.  Upon information and belief, New York City juvenile detention centers, by design \nand operation, make it impossible for youth to engage in the necessary social distancing required \nto  mitigate  the  risk  of  COVID-19  transmission.

Youth charged in Family Court as juvenile delinquents (individuals alleged to have \nengaged in criminal conduct between their seventh and eighteenth birthday ) who are remanded \n 26\nduring the pendency of their cases are housed in secure or non-secure detention centers in the \ncustody of Respondent.    \n34.  All youth remanded to secure detention are held in Crossroads Juvenile Detention \nFacility, operated by Respondent’s Division of Youth and Family Justice (“DYFJ”).   Youth \nremanded to non-secure detention are held in one of eight facilities run by non-profit organizations \nunder contract with DYFJ.  Both secure and non-secure detention facilities confine the youth in \nclose quarters with shared living spaces and common gathering areas, and both experience constant \nturnover of detained youth and staff, making them breeding grounds for infection and transmission \nof COVID-19. \n35.  Youth at Crossroads are assigned to housing units comprised of individual cells \nconnected by a common area with a shared bathroom.  Individual cells lack sinks or toilets.  Each \nhousing unit eats all its meals in a communal dining room, used by all housing units in the facility, \nwith the possible exception of the single Special Housing Unit.  Upon information and belief, now, \neach housing unit may be eat all meals in its common area.  During waking hours, when not in \nschool or other programs, youth generally are in their unit’s common area.  Due to the virus, school \nis not being held in separate classrooms, but only “remotely.” As a result, youth are spending the \n \n26 Family Court Act § 301.2(1). \n  12 \n \n12 of 28\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 03/25/2020 06:14 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC.

Non-secure detention facilities, while designated as “non-secure,” also are locked \nfacilities.  Each facility has the capacity to house twelve detained youth.   Prior to Mayor De \n27\nBlasio’s closing of NYC’s public schools, youth in non-secure detention were taken to one of two \nspecially designated schools outside of their facility.  School is now being conducted on a remote \nbasis, so youth are no longer transported to school, but remain locked into their housing facility, \nwhere they eat together, use common bathrooms and showers, spend time together in common \nareas, and often share bedrooms.  Here, too, it is not possible to practice social distancing. \n37.  Youth in non-secure detention are brought to secure detention in order to obtain \nany needed medical care, leading to further exposure of youth in secure and non-secure detention.   \n38.  At  both  secure  and  non-secure  detention  centers,  the  population  continually \nchanges, with new detained youth entering and others being discharged on a daily basis.  Secure \nand non-secure detention centers also handle “police admits,” youth who because of the timing of \ntheir arrest have not yet been arraigned by a judge to determine whether they need to be detained.  \nAs a result, youth in detention are continuously exposed to new detained youth, as they are to \ndifferent  staff members who alternate from shift  to shift.  As the virus spreads, staff will \nundoubtedly continue to fall ill, increasing the turnover and exposure of youth in the facility. \n39.  Infectious diseases that are communicated by air or touch, such as COVID-19, are \nmore likely to spread in congregate environments, such as detention centers – places where people \nlive, eat, and sleep in close proximity.  Recent events demonstrate that people are particularly \nvulnerable to transmitted COVID-19 infection where their ability to practice social distancing is \n \n27 9 NYCRR 180-1.3(D)(3). \n  13 \n \n13 of 28\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 03/25/2020 06:14 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC.

The highest known person-to-person transmission rate for COVID-19 to date took \nplace in a skilled nursing home facility in Kirkland, Washington, and on afflicted cruise ships in \nJapan and off the coast of California.  Each of these congregate settings became veritable breeding \ngrounds for transmission of COVID-19. \n41.  The conditions of New York City detention facilities pose a higher risk of the \nspread of COVID-19 than in non-carceral locations like a nursing home or cruise ship.  Detention \ncenters have a greater risk because of closer quarters, the proportion of vulnerable people detained, \nand sub-optimal medical care resources.    \n28\n42.  Juvenile detention centers, much like jails, impose limited mobility and heightened \nconfinement on their detainees and feature shared dining and bathroom accommodations, make \nthem particularly vulnerable to the transmission of infection.  In China and Iran, major and \ndevastating COVID-19 outbreaks occurred in prisons, and experts predict the same will happen \nhere.    \n29\n43.  Just this week, New York City jails were hit with a large COVID-19 outbreak.   \n 30\nThe New York City Board of Correction reports that as of March 21, 2020, “at least twelve \n \n28 See, e.g., Joseph A.

As of March 23, 2020, it is reported that DOC’s Rikers Island has 60 confirmed \nCOVID cases among inmates, up from just 8 cases on Friday.    \n32\n45.  Indeed, COVID-19 already has reached New York City youth detention centers.  \nAs of March 23, 2020, at least two staff two staff members working at Crossroads, responsible for \ntransporting detained youth to and from court, have contracted the virus and been hospitalized with \nrespiratory problems.    \n33\n46.  Given that the period during which a COVID-19 infection incubates in a person  \nbefore that person develops symptoms is estimated to be between 2 and 14 days,  and given the \n34\ncurrent lack of access to testing,  there is little doubt that the actual number of infected youth and \n35\nstaff in secure detention is already much higher and will continue to grow.

ACS  has  not  implemented  protocols  sufficient  to  protect  either  the  youth  in \ndetention or staff working in the facilities.  There is no indication that ACS has even taken such \nrisk-mitigation measures as ensuring all staff and youth have access to cleaning and sanitation \nsupplies and giving youth instruction on how to properly wash their hands and sanitize all surfaces \nthroughout the day. Moreover, given the constant influx of new detained youth, there simply are \nno measures absent unavailable mandatory and prompt testing to address those youth who may be \nin the incubation period of the virus or asymptomatic carriers of it.     \n36\n48.  ACS has suspended family visits to detention centers to reduce transmission, but \nthat isolates youth from their families and support networks.   The suspension of all visits for youth \nin detention during this incredibly stressful period places them at risk of significant emotional \nharm.  The vast majority of youth in the juvenile justice system have experienced trauma and suffer \nfrom mental health disorders.  According to the Vera Institute, in 2014 “approximately 85 percent \nof young people assessed in secure detention intake reported at least one traumatic event, including \nsexual and physical abuse, and domestic or intimate partner violence. Furthermore, one in three \nyoung people screened positive for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and/or depression.”   \n37\n49.

Gladys Carrion, former Commissioner of ACS, issued a statement noting that \nvisitation for incarcerated youth is “essential” to their emotional well-being and she, along with \nother experts in the juvenile justice system, are pressing for the release of detained youth to their \nhomes whenever possible, given that the facilities are not equipped to handle the crisis.   \n38\nRelease Is Required to Address the Risk of Serious Medical Harm \n51.  On March 20, 2020, Youth Corrections Leaders for Justice (“YCLJ”), a group \ncomprised of youth corrections officials across the country (co-chaired by Vincent Schiraldi, \nformer Commissioner of New York City Department of Probation, and former ACS Commissioner \nGladys Carrion), issued a joint statement signed by 30 current and former youth correctional \nadministrators calling for the immediate release of youths in juvenile detention facilities to protect \nthem from COVID-19.    \n39\n52.  In the press release announcing YCLJ’s statement, Mr. Schiraldi is quoted as saying: \nAs a nation, we have decided that it is not safe for our children to be \nin school together.  That means it is certainly not safe for them to \nlive in congregate care facilities with hundreds of other youth, \n24/7. . . Those of us who have run these places know that the idea \nof social distancing is preposterous in such an environment and \nintroducing the virus to locked facility would be devastating.40 \n \n53.  In a similar initiative, youth justice advocates in twenty-two states, New York \namong them, sent letters to their governors, juvenile justice system administrators, and other state \nand local officials, demanding the release of detained and incarcerated youth and the halting of \nnew admissions to protect youth from the spread of COVID-19.      \n41\n \n38 Recommendations for Youth Justice Systems During the COVID-19 Emergency.  https://yclj.org/covid19statement. \n39 Id.  \n40 https://yclj.org/covid19pressrelease \n41  Copies  of  the  letters  may  be  found  at  the  following  address:  \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1WR7L2dWyrDP5_XC21Nm3RlupILm5QG8dbXQ-d1ETJA4/edit    \n  17 \n \n17 of 28\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 03/25/2020 06:14 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC.

Physicians for Correctional Reform issued a statement calling for the release of \nchildren in juvenile detention and describing the health risks posed by COVID-19 in carceral \nsettings:   \nTransmission of infectious diseases in adult jails and prisons is \nincredibly  common,  especially  those  transmitted  by  respiratory \ndroplets. For example, it is estimated that up to one quarter of the \nU.S. prison population has been infected with tuberculosis, a rate of \nactive TB infection that is six to ten times higher than the general \npopulation.  Flu  outbreaks  are  regular  occurrences  in  jails  and \nprisons across the United States. With a mortality rate 10 times \ngreater than the seasonal flu and a higher R0 (the average number of \nindividuals who can contract the disease from a single infected \nperson) than Ebola, an outbreak of COVID-19 in youth detention \nand correctional facilities would be devastating.  \n 42\n \n55.

NO. 1 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 03/25/2020\nrecommended the “release of eligible individuals from detention, with priority given to the elderly \nand those with underlying medical conditions most vulnerable to serious illness or death if infected \nwith COVID-19.”  \n44\nFailure to Release Petitioners Constitutes Deliberate Indifference to Serious Medical Harm \n58.  Allowing ACS to continue to detain Petitioners under conditions in which they are \nunable to take the only known steps to protect themselves from transmission of COVID-19 \nconstitutes deliberate indifference to serious medical harm in violation of the United States and \nNew York State constitutions. \n59.  The  Due  Process  clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  proscribes  deliberate \nindifference to the serious medical needs of people held in pre-trial confinement.  Darnell v. \nPineiro, 849 F.3d 17, 29 (2d Cir. 2017).   This proscription applies equally to youth confined \npursuant to juvenile delinquency matters.  See Schall v. Martin, 467 U.S.  253 (1984).   To establish \na federal constitutional claim, Petitioners must prove that Respondents (1) acted intentionally to \nimpose the alleged condition, or recklessly failed to act with reasonable care to mitigate the risk \nthat the condition posed to the pretrial detainee even though (2) they knew, or should have known, \nthat the condition posed an excessive risk to health or safety. Id. at 35.   \n60.  The State  also owes  an affirmative duty  to protect  youth with whom it has \ndeveloped a “special relationship.”  The State holds liability when it takes individuals into custody \nagainst their will and fails to provide for their basic needs. DeShaney v. Winnebago Cty. Dept. of \nSocial Services, 489 U.S. 189, 200 (1989) (“[W]hen the State by the affirmative exercise of its \npower so restrains an individual’s liberty that it renders him unable to care for himself, and at the \nsame time fails to provide for his basic human needs…it transgresses the substantive limits on \n \n44Decl.  of  Dr.  Marc  Stern  ¶¶  9,  11,  Dawson  v.

Both the United States \nSupreme Court and the Second Circuit have determined that a special relationship exists between \nthe State and incarcerated prisoners, as well as between the State and involuntarily committed \nindividuals. Id. at 199. As the Second Circuit has emphasized, “involuntary custody [is] the \nlinchpin of any special relationship exception.” Matican v. New York, 524 F.3d 151, 156 (2d Cir. \n2008).   Thus, it is well established that, if the State is holding an individual in its custody \ninvoluntarily, it is obligated to provide constitutionally adequate care and safety.   \n61.  There is an even stronger due process right to be free from unconstitutional \nconditions of confinement under the New York State Constitution. In Cooper v. Morin, 49 N.Y.2d \n69, 79 (1979), the Court of Appeals concluded that the state due process clause accords even \ngreater protection for pretrial detainees than the federal constitution, holding that “what is required \nis a balancing of the harm to the individual resulting from the condition imposed against the benefit \nsought by the government through its enforcement.” For the government to prevail, it must prove \na “compelling governmental necessity” for any restrictions on pretrial detainees’ liberty interests. \nPeople ex rel. Schipski v. Flood, 88 A.D.2d 197 (2nd Dep’t 1982). This is an “exacting standard.” \nId. The state’s interests are limited to those arising from the “only legitimate purpose for pretrial \ndetention . . . to assure the presence of the detainee for trial.” Id. at 81; see also Schipski, 88 A.D.2d \nat 199-200 (holding county jail’s blanket policy of 22-hour lock-in for a certain category of pretrial \ndetainees violates the state’s due process guarantee); Powlowski v. Wullich, 102 A.D.2d 575, 587 \n(1984) (holding that because a jail’s practice of depriving pretrial detainees of recreation and \nexercise “violates the federal standard, it, a fortiori, must fail the more stringent standard balancing \ntest prescribed for violations of our state due process clause”). \n  21 \n \n21 of 28\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 03/25/2020 06:14 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC.

The U.S. Supreme Court and courts throughout New York have recognized that the \nrisk of contracting a communicable disease constitutes an “unsafe, life-threatening condition” that \nthreatens “reasonable safety.” Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993). See also Jolly v. \nCoughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 477 (2d Cir. 1996) (“[C]orrectional officials have an affirmative obligation \nto protect [forcibly confined] inmates from infectious disease”); Narvaez v. City of New York, No. \n16-CV-1980 (GBD), 2017 WL 1535386, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 17, 2017) (denying “motion to \ndismiss Plaintiff’s claim that the City of New York violated Plaintiff’s rights under the Due Process \nClause by repeatedly deciding to continue housing him with inmates with active-TB” during his \npretrial detention); Bolton v. Goord, 992 F. Supp. 604, 628 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (acknowledging that \nprisoner could state claim under § 1983 for confinement in same cell as inmate with serious \ncontagious disease). \n63.  Respondent is well aware of the extraordinary risk COVID-19 poses to people in \nNew York City juvenile detention facilities.  Since at least March 13, 2020, Dawne A. Mitchell, \nthe attorney-in-charge of the Juvenile Rights Practice of the Legal Aid Society, has been in near \ndaily contact with ACS officials regarding this crisis and our ongoing and ever-increasing concern \nabout the ability to manage the risk of COVID-19 in the city’s juvenile detention centers. \n64.  As pleaded above, numerous media outlets have covered these and other calls to \naction. \n \n65.  Whatever steps Respondent has taken to manage the risk of COVID-19 will fail \nbecause, as pleaded above, Respondent is not capable of managing that risk in a confined close-\nquartered environment.    \n66.  Further, the Honorable Jeanette Ruiz, Administrative Judge of New York Family \nCourt, has issued an order reducing the number of courtrooms that are operating throughout the \n  22 \n \n22 of 28\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 03/25/2020 06:14 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC. NO. 1 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 03/25/2020\nCity, and on March 16, 2020, the court’s Deputy Administrative Judge, George Silver, signed an \norder providing, inter alia, that remand orders in juvenile delinquency cases may be extended \nbeyond their expiration dates, until such time as the court re-calendars or terminates the action.   \nJuveniles will thus be spending significantly longer times than usual in detention.  Given the rate \nat which COVID-19 has been skyrocketing in New York City, the longer these youth remain in \ndetention facilities, with their woefully inadequate protections, the greater the likelihood they will \nfall sick and spread the virus among themselves and staff. \n67.  The Family Court Act imposes strict limitations on remanding youth to detention \nand there is a strong presumption against taking such extreme action.  Section 320.5(3)(a) of the \nFamily Court Act states that a respondent shall be detained only upon a finding that no alternative \nto detention, including conditional discharge, exists, and that there is a substantial probability that \nthe respondent shall not appear in court on the return date or a serious risk he or she may commit \na criminal act before the return date.   \n68.  Further, F.C.A. § 320.5(5) requires that before remanding a juvenile to detention, \nthe court make a determination that continuation of the juvenile in the home would be contrary to \nhis or her best interests based on the facts and circumstances available to the court at the time of \nthe remand order.  The circumstances have changed dramatically since the remand orders were \nissued against Petitioners and it is no longer the case that continuation in the home is contrary to \ntheir best interests. \n69.  Moreover, safeguards can be put in place to minimize any risks presented by \nreleasing the Petitioners from detention.  Family Court Act § 320.5(3)(c) provides that if the court \nmakes a finding that detention is necessary, it may consider, as an alternative to detention, \nelectronic monitoring of the respondent, if such electronic monitoring would significantly reduce \n  23 \n \n23 of 28\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 03/25/2020 06:14 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC. NO. 1 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 03/25/2020\nthe risk of re-arrest or failure to appear.   Additionally, the court may order home confinement, \n45\nalready directed by the Governor’s executive order, and require phone and video monitoring to \nensure compliance. \n70.  In  Schall  v.  Martin,  467  U.S.  253  (1984),  the  Supreme  Court  upheld  the \nconstitutionality  of    F.C.A.  §  320.5(3)(a),  based,  inter  alia,  on  the  fact  that  the  period  of \nconfinement was to be “brief” and “strictly limited in time,” contemplating the “maximum possible \ndetention” for a youth accused of a serious crime as being seventeen days.  Id. at 270.  Youth in \ncustody today are facing protracted detention due to COVID-19, certainly far longer than that \nenvisioned by the Supreme Court.  In addition to the very real health risks confronting youth in \ndetention during the pandemic, they also face violations of their due process rights to meaningful \naccess to counsel and to speedy trial and disposition, the guarantees of which the Schall Court \ncited in upholding the detention statute. Id.  It is especially important for youth to participate in \ntheir defense.  Such participation includes meaningful, private consultations with attorneys and \ngathering and reviewing evidence. For young people it is much more important to have these \nconversations with their attorneys in person to gauge the young person’s understanding and \ncapacity. \n71.  With very few exceptions, juvenile delinquency youth face at most 18 months \nplacement  on felony charges, of which they spend between 6 and 12 months in placement, \n46\nserving the remainder of their time on supervised community release.  It is excessive and punitive \nto keep youth in detention for months on end before they even go to trial when they are at such \n \n45   This provision, and the provision requiring the court to consider all available alternatives to detention, including \nconditional release, before issuing a remand order, were added to the statute in 2008 to strengthen the legislative policy \nof limiting detention to only those situations where the loss of liberty is an “absolute necessity.” See Sobie, \nSupplemental Practice Commentaries, McKinney's Cons Laws of N.Y., Book 29A, Family Court Act § 320.5. \n46 Placement in juvenile delinquency proceedings is the equivalent of sentencing in adult criminal proceeding.  \n  24 \n \n24 of 28\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 03/25/2020 06:14 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC. NO. 1 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 03/25/2020\ngrave risk of health issues and will only likely serve a few additional months if there is ever a \nfinding. Rehabilitation is a hallmark of the juvenile justice system where education and treatment \nfeature prominently.  Detention facilities such as Crossroads are not designed for long term \ntreatment and education of youth. \n72.  Clearly, when balancing the harm to these juveniles by remaining confined in \ndetention during the COVID-19 pandemic, where they continue to be exposed to the very high risk \nof infection, against the benefit to the public and judicial system of maintaining their remand status, \ndue process demands their immediate release.  Cf. U.S. v. Stephens, 2020 WL 1295155 (S.D.N.Y. \nMar. 19, 2020) (granting defendant bail upon finding that “unprecedented and extraordinarily \ndangerous” nature of COVID-19 pandemic and heightened risk of contracting it in jail setting \nprovided changed circumstances to compel reconsideration of original remand order). \n73.  Respondent’s intentional failure to release Petitioners while actually aware of the \nsubstantial risk of COVID-19 infection and transmission plainly constitutes deliberate indifference. \nHabeas Relief Is the Appropriate Remedy in this Circumstance \n74.  The affirmative obligation to protect against infectious disease empowers Courts to \nprovide remedies designed to prevent imminent harm to future health. Helling, 509 U.S. at 33 (“It \nwould be odd to deny an injunction to inmates who plainly proved an unsafe, life-threatening \ncondition in their prison on the ground that nothing yet had happened to them.”); Sanchez v. State \nof New York, 99 N.Y.2d 247, 254 (2002) (recognizing that it is “duty of the State, as [petitioner’s] \ncustodian, to safeguard and protect him from the harms it should reasonably foresee based on its \nknowledge derived from operation of a maximum security prison.”); Jabbar v. Fischer, 683 F.3d \n54, 57 (2d Cir. 2012) (“We have held that prisoners may not be deprived of their basic human \nneeds—e.g., food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and reasonable safety—and they may not be \n  25 \n \n25 of 28\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 03/25/2020 06:14 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC. NO. 1 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 03/25/2020\nexposed to conditions that pose an unreasonable risk of serious damage to [their] future health.”) \n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \n75.  Immediate release pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus is available to address \nconstitutional violations arising from circumstances or conditions of confinement. People ex rel. \nBrown v. Johnston, 9 N.Y.2d 482, 485 (1961) (habeas petition may be used to address “restraint \nin excess of that permitted by...constitutional guarantees”); Kaufman v. Henderson, 64 A.D.2d 849, \n850 (4th Dep’t 1978) (“[W]hen appellant claims that he has been deprived of a fundamental \nconstitutional right, habeas corpus is an appropriate remedy to challenge his imprisonment.”).  \n76.  A person is “not to be divested of all rights and unalterably abandoned and forgotten \nby the remainder of society” by virtue of incarceration. Brown, 9 N.Y.2d at 485.  Thus, courts have \naddressed whether the failure to address medical needs has risen to the level of a constitutional \nviolation, requiring immediate release. See, e.g., People ex rel. Kalikow on Behalf of Rosario v. \nScully, 198 A.D.2d 250, 250–51 (2d Dep’t 1993) (habeas petition addressing whether failure to \nprovide  adequate  medical  care  constituted  cruel  and  unusual  punishment  or  deliberate \nindifference).  Indeed, habeas relief is the only remedy available in such circumstances. Preiser v. \nRodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 489 (1973). \nRespondents Have Authority to Release Petitioners \n77.  Petitioners have not been committed and are not detained by virtue of any judgment, \ndecree, final order or process of mandate issued by a court or judge of the United States in a case \nwhere such court or judge has exclusive jurisdiction to order him released. \n78.  Petitioners are not detained by virtue of any final judgment or decree of a competent \ntribunal or civil or criminal jurisdiction. Petitioners have no other holds. \n   \n  26 \n \n26 of 28\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 03/25/2020 06:14 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC.

They said that we were \ngetting some masks at some point. As of the last time I was in the \nbuilding on Friday, they had masks and they provide us with hand \nsanitizer and again like I said the Lysol wipes.”  \n \n11   During his direct examination, Mr. Robinson misleadingly \nimplied that the vehicles operated by Court Services were also \nused to transport youth from non-secure facilities to obtain \nmedical care at Crossroads.

They could work \nout, but they were to stay in the gym. They were not allowed to \ncongregate together. That was the last thing I was told with the \nsocial distancing and the residents.”  \n \n \n12   She later clarified that housecleaning personnel also come in \nto clean the bathrooms when the residents are off the hall. \n \n11 \n \n11 of 22\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 04/17/2020 04:56 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC.

She testified \nthat she has noticed residents “playing cards together, watching \nmovies together, doing homework together. So I didn’t really see \nthat  enforcement  there.”  Ms.  Sydorowitz  acknowledged  on  cross-\nexamination that one of her responsibilities is to instruct staff \nmembers to enforce the social distancing rules.  \n \nMs. Sydorowitz also acknowledged that signs have been posted \nin bathrooms at the facility offering guidance regarding proper \nhandwashing protocol and that signs have been posted throughout \nthe  facility  detailing  the  symptoms  of  COVID-19.

Kalikow v Scully, 198 AD2d 250 \n(2nd Dept 1993). \n \nThe New York Court of Appeals has held that \n[t]his “deliberate indifference” standard is comprised \nof  an  objective  component  and  a  subjective  component \n(citation omitted). The objective component of the test \nexamines  whether  the  deprivation  of  medical  care  was \n“sufficiently serious” (Farmer [v Brennan], 511 US [825] \n[1970]  at  832;  additional  citation  omitted).  This \nobjective component in turn requires the examination of \ntwo factors: First, “whether the prisoner was actually \ndeprived of adequate medical care” (citation omitted), \nand second, “whether the inadequacy in medical care is \nsufficiently  serious”  (citation  omitted).  Thus,  the \nobjective  component  of  the  standard  is  essentially  a \nreasonableness inquiry. In other words, the question is \nwhether the response of prison officials to the inmate's \nmedical  needs  was  objectively  reasonable  under  the \ncircumstances (citation omitted). \n \nThe subjective component of the deliberate indifference \nstandard  inquires  whether  “the  charged  official  ... \nact[ed]  with  a  sufficiently  culpable  state  of  mind” \n(citation  omitted).  The  Second  Circuit  has  explained \nthis subjective requirement as follows: \n \n“In  medical-treatment  cases  not  arising  from \nemergency situations, the official's state of mind \nneed not reach the level of knowing and purposeful \ninfliction of harm; it suffices if the plaintiff \nproves  that  the  official  acted  with  deliberate \nindifference  to  inmate  health.  Deliberate \nindifference  is  a  mental  state  equivalent  to \nsubjective  recklessness,  as  the  term  is  used  in \ncriminal law. This mental state requires that the \ncharged official act or fail to act while actually \naware  of  a  substantial  risk  that  serious  inmate \nharm will result” (citations omitted). \n \n19 \n \n19 of 22\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 04/17/2020 04:56 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC.

Nonetheless, the \ncase law set forth in Matter of Wooley v New York State Department \nof Correctional Services, supra, is instructive, as petitioners \nhave  demonstrated  that  John  Doe  5  remains  at  serious  risk  of \nmedical  harm  resulting  from  his  continued  exposure  to  the \nCoronavirus.  \n \nAlthough ACS has taken many sensible actions in response to \nthe  unprecedented  pandemic,  this  Court  finds  that  increased \nvigilance by ACS’s leadership is warranted to further mitigate the \nrisk to John Doe 5.  \n \nAdditional  steps  which  should  be  immediately  implemented \ninclude  the  following:  (i)  ACS  should  ensure  that  necessary \npersonal protective equipment, including masks, are distributed to \n20 \n \n20 of 22\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 04/17/2020 04:56 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC.

To the contrary, this \nCourt  credits  Mr.  Parkins’  testimony  that  “it’s  been  really \nchaotic;  new  information  is  ...  coming  out  every  day,  we’re \ncombating disinformation or misinformation on a daily basis and \ntrying to clarify what’s accurate, what’s not accurate.

I am an Assistant Corporation Counsel in the General Litigation Division \nof the Office of the Corporation Counsel of the City of New York, James E. Johnson, attorney \nfor Respondent Commissioner DAVID HANSELL in the above-captioned proceeding.1 \n2.  I write this Affirmation in opposition to the Petitioners’ Verified Petition \nfor Writ of Habeas Corpus, verified on March 25, 2020. \n3.  The allegations set forth in this Affirmation are based upon my personal \nknowledge, such knowledge being formed from my review of books and records of the Office of \n                                                 \n1 At present, the parties continue discussions to see if they can resolve the issues set forth in the \nVerified Petition.

NO. 5 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 03/27/2020\nthe Corporation Counsel and of the New York City Administration for Children’s Services \n(“ACS”) and from conversations with employees of the Office of the Corporation Counsel and of \nACS. Where it is so stated, the allegations in this Affirmation are also based upon information \nand belief. \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n4.  The Court should decline to issue a writ of habeas corpus with respect to \nthe  unidentified  Petitioners.  Petitioners  have  not  adequately  alleged  that  they  are  enduring \nunconstitutional conditions of confinement that pose an excessive risk to their health or safety to \nwhich ACS is deliberately indifferent. To the contrary, ACS has taken appropriate measures, \nconsistent with New York State Department of Health guidelines, to ensure the safety and \nwellbeing of the youths in its custody.  \n5.  Furthermore,  the  Verified  Petition  is  plagued  by  procedural  defects. \nForemost among these is Petitioners’ failure to identify themselves or to allege the individualized \nrisks  posed  to  each  Petitioner  by  exposure  to  COVID-19,  depriving  Respondent  of  an \nopportunity to meaningfully respond to the Verified Petition. Petitioners’ failure to identify \nthemselves also avoids the question of appropriate venue. Additionally, a special proceeding is \nan improper vehicle for class-wide relief. Finally, Petitioners should be directed to move in the \nFamily Court, rather than in this Court, to be released from detention. \nBACKGROUND AND \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \n6.  Relator Lisa Freeman filed her Petition for a writ of habeas corpus on \nMarch 26, 2020.  \n7.  Relator Freeman gave Respondent timely notice of this filing on March \n25, 2020. \n  -2-   \n2 of 9\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 03/27/2020 12:54 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC. NO. 5 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 03/27/2020\n8.  However,  Relator  has  not  identified  any  named  Petitioners.  Instead, \nRelator informed counsel for Respondent by email at about 10:45 p.m. on March 25, 2020, that \nonly seven youths have affirmatively consented to the filing of the Verified Petition on their \nbehalf; eight youths have expressed that they do not wish to participate in this proceeding; and \nMs. Freeman (speaking for the Legal Aid Society) “can not represent we have spoken to all \ndetained [juvenile delinquency] kids.”2  \nPOINT I \nTHE  CONDITIONS  OF  PETITIONERS’ \nCONFINEMENT DO NOT VIOLATE THEIR \nRIGHTS UNDER THE UNITED STATES OR \nNEW YORK CONSTITUTIONS. \n9.  Petitioners contend that their rights under the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution are being violated because ACS is deliberately \nindifferent “to the[ir] serious medical needs.” (Ver. Pet. ¶ 59 (citing Darnell v. Pineiro, 849 F.3d \n17, 29 (2d Cir. 2017)). \n10.  Petitioners are mistaken. \n11.  As  set  forth  in  the  accompanying  Affidavit  of  Charles  Barrios,  the \nAssociate Commissioner of Juvenile Justice Programs & Services within ACS’s Division of \nYouth & Family Justice (“the Division”), dated March 26, 2020 (“Barrios Aff.”), ACS has \nundertaken substantial efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure the health and \n                                                 \n2 Upon information and belief, not all of the Petitioners are represented in Family Court by the \nLegal Aid Society. \nAdditionally, because Petitioners are juveniles, Relator’s representations on behalf of Petitioners \nmust be made pursuant to the principles of substituted judgment.  \n  -3-   \n3 of 9\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 03/27/2020 12:54 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC. NO. 5 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 03/27/2020\nsafety of persons in ACS’s custody to the greatest extent possible. Barrios Aff. ¶¶ 6-20. This \nAffidavit is attached hereto as Exhibit A.3 \n12.  Mr. Barrios oversees ACS’s implementation of service delivery models of \nhealth and medical services to youths in ACS’s custody. Mr. Barrios explains that, since the \noutbreak  of  COVID-19,  he  has  “been  instrumental  in  increasing  awareness  of  sanitation \nprotocols and comprehensive cleaning measures to combat [COVID-19’s] spread, which [has \nbeen] disseminated throughout the Division’s directly-operated secure detention facilities as well \nas the Division’s contracted congregate care provider-operated non-secure detention facilities. \nThis  includes  implementing  enhanced  cleaning  and  sanitizing  procedures  in  areas  in  these \nfacilities which have heavy traffic, including hallways and bathrooms.” Barrios Aff. ¶ 5. \n13.  As Mr. Barrios makes clear in his Affidavit, ACS’s efforts to keep the \nyouths in its custody safe and healthy are comprehensive and ongoing. See Barrios Aff. ¶¶ 6-20 \n(describing various measures being taken and implemented, consistent with New York State \nDepartment  of  Health  guidelines).  This  well-considered  response  by  ACS  to  COVID-19 \ndemonstrates the baselessness of Petitioners’ assertion that ACS disregarded “an excessive risk” \nto Petitioners’ health and safety.  \n14.  Relatedly, the Verified Petition lacks any allegations concerning the risks \nposed to any particular identified Petitioner. For example, it does not allege that any particular \nPetitioner actually suffers an underlying medical condition that would serve as a risk factor, and \ninstead relies on general assertions regarding the correlation between the demographics of youths \nin juvenile detention and certain health conditions. See, e.g., Ver. Pet. ¶¶ 20-22 (using asthma as \n                                                 \n3 Since the drafting and execution of this affidavit on March 26, 2020, additional information \nthat is new or modifies information contained therein has been shared with the undersigned. In \n \n  -4-   \n4 of 9\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 03/27/2020 12:54 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC. NO. 5 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 03/27/2020\nan example of such a health condition). This is an inadequate basis on which to conclude that \ncontinued detention by ACS poses “an excessive risk” to any particular Petitioner and instead \namounts to an attempt to seek release of these juvenile detainees based on generalized assertions \nuntethered to an actual Petitioner. \n15.  Petitioners, therefore, cannot meet their burden of showing that ACS is \ndeliberately indifferent to their health and safety. Accordingly, the Court should decline to issue \na writ of habeas corpus. \n16.  With regard to Petitioners’ claim that their detention violates their rights \nunder the New York Constitution, this assertion also fails. \n17.  As the Court of Appeals has made clear, in considering claims under the \nDue Process Clause of the New York Constitution, “what is required is a balancing of the harm \nto  the  individual  resulting  from  the  condition  imposed  against  the  benefit  sought  by  the \ngovernment through its enforcement.” Cooper v. Morin, 49 N.Y.2d 69, 79 (1979). \n18.  As  set  forth  above,  however,  Petitioners  have  failed  to  articulate  any \nindividualized harm because they have failed to identify themselves. \n19.  For the foregoing reasons, Respondent respectfully requests that the Court \ndeny the Verified Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and decline to issue a writ of habeas \ncorpus, together with such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper. \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \nthe interests of fullness, the affidavit is attached nonetheless for the Court’s reference. \n  -5-   \n5 of 9\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 03/27/2020 12:54 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC. NO. 5 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 03/27/2020\nPOINT II \nTHE VERIFIED PETITION IS DEFECTIVE. \nA.  This Proceeding Was Improperly Brought By a Class of Petitioners. \n20.  Seemingly, Petitioners purport to file this proceeding seeking class-wide \nrelief. This is inappropriate in the context of special proceedings. See Conrad v. Regan, 155 A.D. \n931, 932 (4th Dep’t 1989) (citing In re Leone v. Blum, 73 A.D.2d 252, 274 (2d Dep’t 1980)). \n21.  Even if Petitioners could bring this proceeding in a class-format, they have \nfailed to meet the requirements of article 9 of the CPLR. \nB.  A Petition Purporting to Seek Relief on Behalf of “All Youth in Juvenile Detention” \nDoes Not Provide Respondents With Sufficient Notice to Respond to the Petition. \n22.  Because Petitioners have failed to identify themselves, ACS is unable to \ndetermine, for example, the extent of risk, if any, posed to any particular Petitioner by continued \ndetention.  \n23.  ACS should be afforded an opportunity to respond to a Verified Petition \nthat specifies the actual persons it purports to have been filed on behalf of.  \nC.  Venue Is Likely Improper. \n24.  Because Petitioners have failed to identify themselves, the Court is unable \nto  determine  whether  this  proceeding’s  venue  is  proper.  CPLR  7002(b)(1)-(4)  sets  out  the \ngeneral  venue  provisions  applicable  to  habeas  corpus  provisions,  but  CPLR  7002(b)(5)  is \naddressed specifically to cities in which the population is one million or more inhabitants. See \nalso CPLR 7002(b) (providing that “[e]xcept as provided in paragraph five of this subdivision” \nvenue determined by 7002(b)(1)-(4)). \n25.  CPLR 7002(b)(5) states that “in a city having a population of one million \nor more inhabitants, a person held as a trial inmate in a city detention institution shall petition for \n  -6-   \n6 of 9\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 03/27/2020 12:54 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC. NO. 5 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 03/27/2020\na writ to the supreme court in the county in which the charge for which the inmate is being \ndetained is pending. . . .”  \n26.  To the extent that any of the Petitioners’ underlying cases are pending in \nCity counties other than the County of New York, those Petitioners’ writ applications should be \nheard  in  those  respective  counties.  The  Verified  Petition  as  drafted  does  not  permit  a \ndetermination of appropriate venue and should therefore be denied. \nD.  This Court Should Defer to the Family Court’s Judgment About Any Release of \nJuvenile Offenders. \n27.  In criminal court, a pretrial detainee may rely on habeas corpus to seek \nreview of “a denial of bail or the fixing of the amount of bail if it appears that the constitutional \nor statutory standards inhibiting excessive bail or the arbitrary refusal of bail are violated.” \nPeople ex rel. Klein v. Kruger, 25 N.Y.2d 497, 499 (1969). \n28.  A bail hearing in criminal court is analogous to an initial appearance in \nFamily Court, where the Court first considers whether the youth should be detained. In re Daniel \nC., 15 Misc. 3d 543, 546 n.2 (N.Y. Fam. Ct. Queens Cty. 2007) (“While there is no right to bail \nin a juvenile delinquency proceeding and a juvenile may not be released on recognizance, an \norder entered at the initial appearance pursuant to Family Court Act § 320.5 is the functional \nequivalent of a securing order entered in a criminal action.”) (internal citations omitted).  \n29.  A habeas court reviewing a Family Court determination to remand a youth \ninto pretrial detention must therefore be reviewed under a deferential standard; the habeas court \nmay only review the Family Court remand order to determine whether it “was the product of ‘an \nexercise of discretion resting on a rational basis.’” People ex rel. Schreiber v. Warden, 282 \nA.D.2d 555, 555 (2d Dep’t 2001) (citing People ex rel. Phimister, 29 N.Y.2d 580, 581 (1971)). \nIf it was “an exercise of discretion resting on a rational basis,” it may not be overturned. Indeed, \n  -7-   \n7 of 9\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 03/27/2020 12:54 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC. NO. 5 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 03/27/2020\nhabeas corpus may not be used as a means to secure a second opinion on a youth’s remand. See \nPeople ex rel. Shapiro v. Keeper of City Prison, 290 N.Y. 393, 399 (1943). \n30.  This review by the habeas court is also limited to the record before the \nremanding Family Court. See People ex rel. Rosenthal v. Wolfson, 48 N.Y.2d 230, 231-32 \n(1979). If there are materially changed circumstances since the issuance of the remand order, \nthen “principles of orderly process dictate that a renewal of the application for [alternatives to \ndetention] be made on return to the [Family Court].” Id. at 233 (citing People ex rel. Llauget v. \nCyrta, 35 A.D.2d 724 (2d Dep’t 1970)).  \n31.  The  unidentified  Petitioners  should,  in  the  first  instance,  seek  a \nmodification of their remand orders with the Family Court in accordance with the foregoing \nprinciples.  This  accords  with  the  general  principle  that  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus  should  be \nemployed only when a petitioner has no other avenue for the relief he or she seeks. \n32.  This Court should decline to issue a writ of habeas corpus and instead \ndirect Petitioners to seek relief in the Family Court. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  -8-   \n8 of 9\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 03/27/2020 12:54 PM INDEX NO. 451130/2020\nNYSCEF DOC. NO. 5 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 03/27/2020\n33.  Should this Court determine, notwithstanding the above arguments, that it \nwill review the continuing legal validity of the Family Court’s remand decisions underlying this \nmatter, then the Court should order Petitioners to identify themselves to Respondents, so that the \nappropriate records of each Petitioner’s remand can be produced for the Court’s review under the \ndeferential standard outlined above. \nDated:  March 27, 2020 \nNew York, New York \n  /s/ David S.
