    "summary": "<p>On March 30, 2020, the ACLU of Indiana filed this petition requesting the Indiana Supreme Court to engage in emergency rule-making and take immediate action aiming to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Indiana Department of Correction facilities. The petitioners noted that the nature of the facilities makes social distancing and adequate sanitation impossible. Due to the highly contagious nature of the disease, especially for elderly individuals or those suffering from underlying medical conditions, correctional facilities generally posed a significant risk of outbreak among prisoners. They are especially vulnerable when overcrowded; 77% of Indiana&rsquo;s jails were overcrowded or at capacity in 2018.</p>\r\n<p>The ACLU grounded its argument in the Eighth Amendment&rsquo;s prohibition of state officials acting with deliberate indifference to a prisoner&rsquo;s serious medical needs, and the Seventh Circuit&rsquo;s recognition that the Fourteenth Amendment rights of pretrial detainees may be violated simply by subjecting individuals to an objectively unreasonable risk of harm. The ACLU asked the Indiana Supreme Court to engage in emergency rule-making pursuant to its authority to adopt rules governing the conduct of litigation in its judicial system that would require trial courts to identify pretrial detainees and prisoners eligible for home detention during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>The petition alleged that Indiana law provides for mechanisms through which at-risk people may obtain temporary or permanent release to ensure their well-being. The ACLU sought the court to order the Indiana Department of Correction and each county sheriff to</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Immediately compile a list of all prisoners who are at heightened risk due to old age or suffer from underlying health conditions.</li>\r\n<li>Immediately compile a list of pretrial detainees who are being held based on non-violent misdemeanor charges; non-violent felony charges that would be eligible for home detention or work-release sentence if conviction were secured; the inability to pay bond and the court has determined that the individual is bailable; arrest for an allegation of parole/probation violation, where the violation does not constitute a separate, violent offense.</li>\r\n<li>Immediately compile a list of convicted prisoners who are within six months of their expected release date.</li>\r\n<li>Transmit the above lists to the Indiana court with a recommendation as to whether the prisoner merits consideration for either temporary or permanent release given the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The ACLU also requested the Indiana Supreme Court to order other state courts to review its dockets for prisoners that remain incarcerated solely due to their inability to pay bail. The ACLU also requested the Supreme Court to order trial courts to take all necessary and appropriate actions to reduce future people committed to jails as pretrial detainees, and to reduce the sentences of prisoners so they may be released to shelter at home. Finally, the ACLU requested the Court to ask the Indiana Department of Correction to have the Indiana Parole Board advance parole considerations to the greatest extent possible, permitting prisoners who merit parole to shelter at home.</p>\r\n<p>The Court allowed any interested party to file a response to the ACLU's petition. The Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Council, Indiana Sheriffs Association, and Indiana Department of Correction filed responses opposing the ACLU's petition. The Indiana Public Defender Council and Indiana State Public Defender filed responses supporting the petition.</p>\r\n<p>On April 8, 2020, the Indiana Supreme Court issued an order denying the ACLU's motion for emergency rule-making. The Court stated that it did not have original jurisdiction to order the Indiana Department of Correction to take actions, but noted that a joint letter was issued on April 3, 2020 co-signed by Chief Justice Loretta Rush, Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb, House of Representatives Speaker Todd Huston, and Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray. The letter encouraged local judges, sheriffs, and county leaders to review their prisoner populations to determine if any low-risk, non-violent individuals could be released under supervision. The Indiana Supreme Court also noted that it had issued emergency orders under Indiana Administrative Rule 17 authorizing courts to review and modify sentences after consultation with local prosecutors, public defenders, and other criminal justice leaders. 2020 WL 1698362</p>\r\n<p>Those emergency orders were issued as part of <em>In re the Matter of Administrative Rule 17 Emergency Relief in the Indiana Trial Courts Related to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)</em>, No. 20S-CB-123, 2020 WL 1649746 (April 3, 2020).</p>\r\n<p>This case is now closed.</p>",

      "text": "Filed: 3/30/2020 1:11 PM\nIN THE SUPREME COURT   20S-MS-00234\nOF THE STATE OF INDIANA \nNo. _________________________________ \n \n \nIN THE MATTER OF:            ) \n) \nPETITION REQUESTING THE  INDIANA SUPREME  ) \nCOURT TO ENGAGE IN EMERGENCY RULEMAKING  ) \nTO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF IMPRISONED    ) \nPERSONS AND THE COVID-19 CRISIS      ) \n \n  \nPETITION FOR EMERGENCY RULEMAKING \n \n  COMES NOW the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, by its counsel, and \nas set forth below requests that this Court engage in emergency rulemaking to address \nthe urgent dangers that the COVID-19 pandemic poses for persons incarcerated in \nIndiana’s prisons and jails.  In support of this request, the American Civil Liberties Union \nof Indiana states as follows: \nI.  Introduction \n1.  The world is facing an unprecedented health emergency caused by the spread of \nthe novel coronavirus, which causes the potentially fatal disease COVID-19.  There is no \nvaccine for the virus, and there is no cure for the disease.  The number of confirmed cases \nof COVID-19 is increasing by the hour; the number of hospitalizations and fatalities is \nsimilarly spinning out of control.  The exponential rise in the prevalence of COVID-19 is \ncaused in part by the fact that the virus is highly transmissible.  In order to slow the \nspread of the disease, states across the country—including Indiana—have implemented \n1 \n \n\n“stay-at-home” or “shelter-in-place” orders, have closed schools, governmental offices, \nand  countless  commercial  and  other  establishments,  and  have  restricted  public \ngatherings.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged social distancing, \nwhereby persons must remain at least six feet away from every other person, and has \nrecommended the implementation of various hygienic measures. \n2.  None of the recommended measures for mitigating the spread of COVID-19, \nhowever, are available to persons confined in correctional facilities or for those who \ninteract with them.  The Indiana Department of Correction (“DOC”) houses more than \n25,000 persons in close proximity to one another and to their keepers; Indiana’s county \njails house thousands more.  Limited staff and resources mean that surfaces are unlikely \nto be frequently cleaned, if at all.  Like a cruise ship or a nursing home, these institutions \nrepresent environments in which the coronavirus can easily gain a foothold and, when it \ndoes, spread rapidly.  And many of those detained are older or have been diagnosed with \nunderlying health conditions that place them at heightened risk for suffering serious, \npotentially fatal, illness as a result of COVID-19. \n3.  On behalf of institutionalized persons most at risk, the American Civil Liberties \nUnion of Indiana (“ACLU of Indiana”) files this emergency petition requesting that this \nCourt take immediate action—described below—designed to stem the progression of \nCOVID-19 in the DOC and Indiana’s county jails. These are extraordinary times, and they \ncall for affirmative action by Indiana’s judiciary and, ultimately, for extraordinary relief.     \n2 \n \n\nII.  The interests of the ACLU \n4.  The  ACLU  of  Indiana  (incorporated  as  the  Indiana  Civil  Liberties  Union \nFoundation, Inc. and the Indiana Civil Liberties Union, Inc.) is a prominent civil rights \norganization and is the Indiana affiliate of the national American Civil Liberties Union. \n5.  Of specific relevance to this petition is that the ACLU of Indiana frequently \nrepresents  prisoners  in  civil  actions  challenging  conditions  of  their  confinement  as \nviolating the United States Constitution. At the current time the ACLU of Indiana has \nnumerous actions currently pending where its attorneys represent prisoners confined in \nthe DOC or county jails.1 The county jail cases are class actions, or putative class actions, \nwhere attorneys from the ACLU of Indiana are representing, or are seeking to represent, \nnot only the prisoners who filed the action, but all the prisoners in the jail: \n•  Bell v. Henry County Sheriff, No. 1:19-cv-00557-SEB-MJD (S.D. Ind.) (certified class \naction with the class defined as all Henry County Jail prisoners) \n \n•  Copeland v. Wabash County, Indiana, No. 3:20-cv-154-JD-MGG (N.D. Ind.) (class \naction request pending with the class defined as all Wabash County Jail prisoners) \n \n•  Huerta v. Ewing, No. 2:16-cv-397-JMS-MJD (S.D. Ind.) (certified class action with \nthe class defined as all Vigo County Jail prisoners) \n \n \n1   Throughout this petition the ACLU of Indiana will use the term “DOC” to refer not only \nto institutions directly operated by the DOC, but also to the New Castle Correctional Facility and \nHeritage Trail Correctional Facility, which are run by a private corporation under contracts with \nthe DOC. Similarly, the term “county jail” refers not only to jails operated directly by Indiana’s \ncounties but also to private facilities where the counties have contracted with private corporations \nto house their prisoners.  \n3 \n \n\n•  Indiana Protection and Advocacy Servicers Comm’n v. Commissioner, Indiana Dep’t of \nCorrection, No. 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD (S.D. Ind.) (certified class action with the \nclass defined to include seriously mentally ill prisoners in segregation) \n \n•  LaCroix v.

Therefore, the ACLU currently represents a significant number of the prisoners \ncurrently incarcerated in Indiana. \n4 \n \n\n7.  The ACLU of Indiana has an intake process where persons seeking assistance from \nthe organization may contact it requesting that its attorneys review their cases. In 2019, \nthe ACLU of Indiana received 3,100 requests for assistance, more than 60% of which came \nfrom prisoners, within both the DOC and county jails, with a small number coming from \nprisoners incarcerated in the federal facilities in Terre Haute.  In the first two months of \n2020, the ACLU of Indiana received requests for assistance from at least 375 separate \nprisoners. \n8.  Many of the prisoners seeking assistance who are housed within county jails and \nthe DOC indicate that they have serious medical issues. The ACLU of Indiana also \nregularly receives contacts from prisoners who are older than 65. \n9.  “Prisons and jail officials . . . . ‘ha[ve] a constitutional duty to take reasonable steps \nto protect the prisoners’ safety and bodily integrity.’” Cox v. Glanz, 800 F.3d 1231, 1247-\n48 (10th Cir. 2015) (quoting Berry v. City of Muskogee, 900 F.2d 1489, 1499 (10th Cir. 1990) \n(alterations by the court). Given that the organizational mission of the ACLU of Indiana \nincludes  the  protection  of  the  civil  liberties  and  constitutional  rights  of  vulnerable \npopulations, and given that its attorneys represent so many prisoners, the ACLU of \nIndiana has a strong interest in ensuring that the rights of prisoners in Indiana are secured \nand the prisoners’ safety is protected to the greatest extent as possible.   \nIII.  The power and authority of this Court \n5 \n \n\n10.  The  Indiana  Constitution,  Art.  7,  §  4,  provides  that  this  Court  has  original \njurisdiction regarding “the supervision of the exercise of jurisdiction by the other courts \nof the State; and issuance of writs necessary or appropriate in aid of its jurisdiction.” \n11.  This Court has inherent authority to issue opinions, even sua sponte, “wherein \nquestions are presented which directly concern this Court.” In re Judicial Interpretation of \n1975 Senate Enrolled Act No. 441, 263 Ind. 350, 332 N.E.2d 97 (1975) (sua sponte declaring a \nnewly enacted statute to be unconstitutional as it impinged on the Court’s exclusive \nconstitutional powers to regulate the practice of law). \n12.  This Court also “has authority to adopt rules of procedure governing the conduct \nof litigation in our judicial system.” Augustine v. First Federal Sav. & Loan Ass’n of Gary, \n270 Ind. 238, 241, 384 N.E.2d 1018, 1020 (1979) (citation omitted). \n13.  This Court’s rulemaking authority is generally exercised according to established \nprocedures. However, this Court has held that when an emergent situation arises, it has \n“the  inherent  responsibility  and  authority”  to  address  the  issue  and  “remove  the \nimpediment” that is thwarting the administration of justice. Castle v. Fleenor, 262 Ind. 503, \n504, 318 N.E. 2d 567 (1974). In Fleenor, this Court appointed a successor special judge \nwhen the original special judge died, even though Trial Rule 79, the rule concerning the \nappointment of special judges, was silent as to what was to occur in this circumstance. \nThe Court noted that although it was “reluctant to adopt or amend rules, except in \naccordance with the established procedure” it was necessary to act in this situation \n6 \n \n\npursuant to its “inherent responsibility and authority.” Id.  The Court “not only has the \nright, but the responsibility under the Constitution, to formulate rules and regulations so \nthat the constitutional rights of litigants may be fully recognized and applied in the \nadministration of justice in the courts.” State ex rel Uzelac v. Lake Criminal Court, 247 Ind. \n87, 90-91, 212 N.E.2d 21, 23 (1965). \n14.  Although this Court has the authority to issue rules and to compel courts to act \nthat refuse to do so, it has no authority “to direct or control judicial discretion in the \nperformance of the act, or to predetermine the decision to be made, or to prescribe the \njudgment to be rendered.” State ex rel. Beatty v. Nichols, 233 Ind. 432, 434, 120 N.E.2d 407, \n408 (1954) (further citations omitted). \n15.  This Court has recently exercised its authority to engage in rulemaking specifically \nconcerning the COVID-19 crisis by promulgating an emergency rule on March 23, 2020, \nwhich tolled various deadlines and time limits. In re Administrative Rule 17 Emergency \nRelief for Indiana Trial Courts Relating to 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), --N.E.3d--, \nNo. 20S-CB-123, 2020 WL 1329684 (Ind. Mar. 23, 2020). In doing so, this Court reiterated \nits authority to act “to ensure the orderly and fair administration of justice during this \nemergency.” Id., 2020 WL 1329684, at *1. \nIV.  The current COVID-19 crisis     \n16.  Coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) is an infectious disease caused by severe \nacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (“coronavirus”).  The disease \n7 \n \n\nwas first identified last year in Wuhan, China and has since spread to more than two \nhundred countries, resulting in a global pandemic.  Both the World Health Organization \n(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) and the Centers for \nDisease  Control  and  Prevention  (“CDC”)  (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/index.html) publish frequently updated data, guidelines, and recommendations \nconcerning the pandemic; unless otherwise noted, information described herein is taken \nfrom these authoritative, publicly available sources (all internet citations last visited on \nMar. 30, 2020).   \n17.  As of 7:20 a.m. on March 30, 2020, 735,560 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been \nreported worldwide; 143,055 of those are in the United States, and 1,513 are in Indiana.  \nSee Johns Hopkins University & Medicine: Coronavirus Resource Center, Coronavirus \nCOVID-19  Global  Cases  (“Global  Cases”),  at  https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html. \nHowever, due to widely reported deficiencies in testing capacities—and because many \ninfected persons may be asymptomatic or experience only mild symptoms—the actual \nprevalence of COVID-19 is likely far greater than the number of confirmed cases.  As a \nresult of community spread, the number of persons infected with COVID-19 is increasing \nseemingly by the minute: some experts suggest that hundreds of millions of persons in \nthe United States will be infected with COVID-19 during the course of the pandemic, a \npotentiality that could result in hundreds of thousands of deaths. See Sheri Fink, Worst-\n8 \n \n\nCase Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths, N.Y. Times, Mar. 13, 2020, at https://www. \nnytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/coronavirus-deaths-estimate.html.   \n18.  Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath; \nmuscle pain, diarrhea, and sore throat are less common.  While the majority of cases result \nin mild symptoms, some persons progress to pneumonia, organ failure, or even death.  \nAs of 7:20 a.m. on March 30, 2020, 34,686 fatalities have been reported worldwide, 2,513 \nin the United States, and 32 in Indiana.  See Global Cases, supra.  \n19.  As of March 23rd, the rate of deaths per the number of diagnosed cases was 4.4%, \nalthough given the number of undiagnosed cases experts estimate the fatality rate at \napproximately 1.4%. This number differs widely, however, based on an individual’s age \nand underlying health conditions: persons at heightened risk include those over the age \nof 65 as well as those with chronic lung disease or asthma, those with serious heart \nconditions, those who are immunocompromised (including those undergoing cancer \ntreatment), those with severe obesity, and those with diabetes, renal failure, or liver \ndisease.  For certain categories of these persons, the fatality rate may be as high as 10-\n27%. Even this rate, however, can be expected to be higher when an individual with \nCOVID-19 lacks access to potentially life-saving medical equipment, such as ventilators, \nwhich is in increasingly short supply even for the non-incarcerated population. Like the \nnumber of confirmed cases, the number of fatalities from the disease—across the state, \nacross the country, and across the globe—is increasing daily. \n9 \n \n\n20.  COVID-19 is highly contagious: experts indicate that it may be 2-3 times more \ncontagious than the seasonal flu. The disease may be transmitted through close proximity \nto others who have the virus or with objects that have been contacted by those persons.  \nIt typically spreads from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth \nthat are expelled when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.  These droplets may \neither be inhaled directly or may land on objects or surfaces around the infected person; \nwhen they land on surfaces around the infected person the disease may be transmitted \nwhen that surface is touched by another person and then that person touches his or her \neyes, nose, or mouth.  The disease may be transmitted even when an infected person is \nasymptomatic or is experiencing only mild symptoms. \n21.  As noted at the outset, no vaccine exists for the coronavirus and no cure exists for \nCOVID-19. \nV.   Measures to mitigate the spread of the disease \n22.  The measures recommended by leading infectious disease experts to mitigate the \nspread of COVID-19 have been widely reported and have entered our daily lexicon. \n23.  The CDC recommends that all persons wash their hands often, that they clean and \ndisinfect frequently used surfaces in their home daily, and that they avoid touching their \neyes, nose, and mouth to the greatest extent possible. The CDC also recommends that \npersons take “social distancing” measures, whereby  they remain out of congregate \nsettings, avoid mass gatherings, and maintain distance—at least six feet—from other \n10 \n \n\npersons in order to limit the ability of the coronavirus to spread. To implement these \nstrategies, hundreds of millions of Americans have been ordered to do what seemed \nunthinkable only a few weeks ago: to refrain from going to work, school, or even small \nsocial gatherings, and to leave their homes only when it is essential to do so.  These so-\ncalled “shelter-in-place” orders have been issued now in at least 26 states, 66 counties, 14 \ncities, and one territory.  See Sarah Mervosh, et al., See Which States and Cities Have Told \nResidents to Stay at Home, N.Y. Times, at https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/ \ncoronavirus-stay-at-home-order.html (last updated Mar. 28, 2020).   \n24.  On March 23, 2020, Governor Holcomb issued a statewide executive order in \nIndiana, which generally requires all Hoosiers to remain at home to the greatest extent \npossible. See Executive Order 20-08, available at https://www.in.gov/gov/files/Executive \n_Order_20-08_Stay_at_Home.pdf  (Mar.  23,  2020).    As  noted,  this  Court  has  also \nrecognized the extraordinary health emergency facing Hoosiers, and the need to shelter-\nin-place and keep socially distant by declaring an emergency and by tolling all time limits \nfor appellate filings, by suspending rules regarding filing by personal delivery, and by \ntolling numerous other deadlines.  See In re Administrative Rule 17 Emergency Relief for \nIndiana Trial Courts Relating to 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), --N.E.3d--, No. 20S-CB-\n123, 2020 WL 1329684 (Ind. Mar. 23, 2020); see also Order, In re Administrative Rule 17 \nEmergency Relief for Indiana Trial Courts Relating to 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), --\n11 \n \n\nN.E.3d--,  No.  20S-CB-123,  available  at  https://www.in.gov/judiciary/files/order-other-\n2020-20S-CB-123b.pdf (Ind. Mar. 25, 2020) (establishing deadlines for appellate filings). \n25.  Unfortunately, the CDC’s recommendations for limiting the spread of COVID-19 \nare virtually impossible to implement in an institutionalized setting, where many of the \nmost fragile individuals reside.  Social distancing is impossible in Indiana’s jails and \nprisons, for persons reside in close quarters and in frequent contact with each other and \nwith their jailers.  Maintaining proper hygiene is likewise challenging at best, for limited \nresources, supplies, and staff make it virtually impossible for persons to wash their hands \nregularly or to disinfect all frequently touched surfaces.  Conditions, in other words, are \nripe for a widespread outbreak.  See, e.g., Omar Jimenez, America’s largest single site jail is \nhome to a new coronavirus cluster, CNN.com, Mar. 29, 2020, at https://www.cnn.com/2020/ \n03/29/us/detroit-coronavirus-cook-county-jail/index.html  (describing  an  outbreak  of \nCOVID-19 at the Cook County Jail in Chicago); Tim Evans, Coronavirus catastrophe feared \nin Indiana’s jails and prisons, some call for bold steps (“Coronavirus catastrophe”), Indianapolis \nStar, Mar. 25, 2020, at https://www.indystar.com/story/news/investigations/2020/03/25/ \nindiana-coronavirus-covid-19-what-jails-prisons-doing/2900441001/. \n26.  These  problems,  of  course,  are  exacerbated  by  all-too-common  population \npressures experienced by Indiana’s jails. A recent task force on jail overcrowding in \nIndiana chaired by Justice David concluded that “many counties are experiencing jail \novercrowding.”  Jail  Overcrowding  Task  Force,  2019  Report,  at  5,  available  at \n12 \n \n\nhttps://www.in.gov/judiciary/iocs/files/jail-overcrowding-report.pdf.  The  Indiana \nCriminal Justice Institute has thus previously concluded that 77% of Indiana jails were \neither overcrowded or at capacity. See Dustin Grove, Indiana criminal justice leaders looking \nto  curb  jail  overcrowding,  WTHR.com,  Nov.  7,  2019,  at \nhttps://www.wthr.com/article/indiana-criminal-justice-leaders-looking-curb-jail-\novercrowding.  \n27.    To their immense credit, it is the understanding of undersigned counsel that \nmany (but not all) counties in Indiana have already taken steps to reduce their jail \npopulation, and that the DOC has expressed a willingness to promptly implement any \nsentencing modifications or other judicial orders that it receives.  But time is of the \nessence: employees at two Indianapolis-area jails—at least—have  already tested positive \nfor COVID-19, see Coronavirus catastrophe, supra; Shakkira Harris, Confirmed case of COVID-\n19 at Hancock County Sheriff’s Department, The Indy Channel, Mar. 12, 2020, at https:// \nwww.theindychannel.com/coronavirus/confirmed-case-of-covid-19-at-hancock-county-\nsheriffs-department, and anecdotal reports indicates that persons in other facilities are \ndemonstrating symptoms consistent with COVID-19 although limited testing capabilities \nmake confirmation impossible.   \nVI.  The United States Constitution requires that the health and safety of \nIndiana prisoners be protected amidst the current epidemic, and Indiana \nlaw provides several mechanisms for doing so \n \n13 \n \n\n28.  Ensuring the safety of at-risk persons in Indiana’s jails and prisons is not only a \nhumanitarian  necessity;  it  is  a  constitutional  requirement.    After  all,  the  Eighth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution prohibits state officials from acting with \ndeliberate indifference to a convicted prisoner’s serious medical needs.  See, e.g., Farmer \nv. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 828-29 (1994); Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976).  At least \nthree federal circuits, including the Seventh Circuit, have concluded that officials violate \nthe Fourteenth Amendment rights of pretrial detainees—who have not been convicted of \na crime—simply by subjecting persons to an objectively unreasonable risk of harm, \nwithout resort to the subjective component of Eighth Amendment analysis.  See Miranda \nv. County of Lake, 900 F.3d 335, 350-52 (describing circuit split).  Regardless, where the risk \nof harm is clear and recognized, the subjective component of Eighth Amendment analysis \nis  met  and  these  standards  merge.  Moreover,  an  incarcerated  individual  need  not \ndemonstrate with certainty that harm will befall him or her; the Constitution does not \ntolerate the exposure to environmental hazards that create even a significant risk of \nserious injury.  See, e.g., Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 32-35 (1993).  Cases concluding \nthat this standard is satisfied by hazards considerably less dangerous that COVID-19 are \nlegion.2 \n \n2    See, e.g., Helling, 509 U.S. at 28-29 (exposure to tobacco smoke); Hinojosa v. Livingston, 807 \nF.3d 657, 669 (5th Cir. 2015) (“extremely dangerous temperatures”); Johnson v. Epps, 479 Fed. \nApp’x 583, 590-91 (5th Cir. 2012) (exposure to unsterilized barbering instruments potentially \ncontaminated with HIV-positive blood); Powers v. Snyder, 484 F.3d 929, 931 (7th Cir. 2007) \n(exposure to hepatitis or other serious diseases); Vinning-El v. Long, 482 F.3d 923, 924 (7th Cir. \n14 \n \n\n29.  The circumstances of this petition, of course, are atypical: it is the institutional \nenvironment itself that creates an unconscionable risk to inmates’ health and safety. But \nIndiana law provides numerous mechanisms through which at-risk persons may obtain \ntemporary or permanent release in order to ensure their well-being and the well-being of \nthose required to interact with them inside the institution. Trial courts, of course, may \nalter or waive a pretrial detainee’s bail requirement at any time.  See Ind. Code § 35-33-8-\n5; see also Ind. R. Crim. P. 26(A) (providing that, with certain exceptions, an arrestee \nshould  be  released  “without  money  bail  or  surety  subject  to  such  restrictions  as \ndetermined by the court” whenever he or she “does not present a substantial risk of flight \nor danger to self or others”). Even for convicted prisoners, the DOC has discretionary \nauthority to arrange for an offender’s placement outside of DOC facilities whenever it \n“determines that a committed offender is mentally or physically incapacitated to such an \n \n2007) (flooding or exposure to blood and feces in cells); Morgan v. Morgensen, 465 F.3d 1041, 1047 \n(9th Cir. 2006) (a “safety hazard in an occupational area”); Atkinson v. Taylor, 316 F.3d 257, 266-69 \n(3d Cir. 2003) (exposure to tobacco smoke); DeSpain v. Uphoff, 264 F.3d 965, 977-79 (10th Cir. 2001) \n(cells flooded with sewage); Shannon v. Graves, 257 F.3d 1164, 1168 (10th Cir. 2001) (exposure to \nhuman waste); Herman v. Holiday, 238 F.3d 660, 664 (5th Cir. 2001) (exposure to “unreasonably \nhigh levels of environmental toxins”); Loftin v. Dalessandri, 3 Fed. App’x 658, 660-63 (10th Cir. \n2001) (exposure to tuberculosis); Warren v. Keane, 196 F.3d 330, 332-33 (2d Cir. 1999) (exposure to \nboth second-hand smoke and asbestos); LaBounty v. Coughlin, 137 F.3d 68, 74 (2d Cir. 1998) \n(exposure to “friable asbestos”); Smith v. Copeland, 87 F.3d 265, 268 (8th Cir. 1996) (exposure to \nraw sewage);  Keenan v. Hall, 83 F.3d 1083, 1089-90 (9th Cir. 1996) (deprivation of outdoor exercise, \nexcessive noise and lighting, lack of ventilation, inadequate access to basic hygiene supplies, and \ninadequate food and water); Wallis v. Baldwin, 70 F.3d 1074, 1076-77 (9th Cir. 1995) (exposure to \nasbestos); Kelley v. Borg, 60 F.3d 664, 666-67 (9th Cir. 1995) (unidentified “fumes” which rendered \nan inmate unconscious); Henderson v. DeRobertis, 940 F.2d 1055, 1059 (7th Cir. 1991) (inadequate \nheat and shelter); DeGidio v. Pung, 920 F.2d 525, 531-33 (8th Cir. 1990) (exposure to tuberculosis); \nGillespie v. Civiletti, 629 F.2d 637, 642 (9th Cir. 1980) (inadequate heat). \n15 \n \n\nextent that proper custody, care, and control cannot be provided by the [DOC]”—\nauthority that is surely broad enough to permit at-risk offenders to be temporarily placed \non home detention or in a similar setting.  See Ind. Code § 11-10-1-3(c); see also Ind. Code \n§  11-10-2-5(b)  (juvenile  offenders).  And,  of  course,  trial  courts  may  modify  some \nindividuals’ sentences under certain circumstances.  See Ind. Code § 35-38-1-17. \n30.  Although extraordinary, this petition is not unique: faced with the threat posed by \nCOVID-19 and recognizing that the institutional environment renders impossible the full \nimplementation of the guidelines recommended by the CDC and other experts for \nlimiting the spread of the disease, several state courts have already taken action to \ntemporarily depopulate their states’ prisons and jail.   \n31.  For instance, on March 22, 2020, the Supreme Court of New Jersey issued a consent \norder requiring the release of inmates from county jails who met certain charging and/or \nconviction criteria, amounting to an immediate reduction of approximately ten percent \nof New Jersey’s county jail population.  Supreme Court of New Jersey, Docket No. 084230 \n(Mar. 22, 2020). On March 16, 2020, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of South \nCarolina issued a memorandum directing municipal court judges to release non-capital \npre-trial detainees without bond, unless such persons pose an unreasonable risk of flight \nor  of  harm  to  the  community.  See  Memorandum  of  March  16,  2020,  available  at \nhttps://www.sccourts.org/whatsnew/displaywhatsnew.cfm?indexID=2461.  And  the \nMaine judiciary issued an emergency order vacating all outstanding warrants for unpaid \n16 \n \n\nfines and for failure to appear, in an attempt to minimize further arrests.  See Emergency \nOrder of March 16, 2020, available at https://www.courts.maine.gov/covid19/emergency-\norder-vacating-warrants-fines-fees.pdf.  State and local court judges around the country \nin Alabama, California, Florida, Maine, Montana, Ohio, Texas, and Washington D.C., \namong others, have taken steps to reduce county jail populations.    \nVII.   This Court should immediately issue an emergency rule directing trial \ncourts  to  take  steps  to  identify  imprisoned  pretrial  detainees  and \nincarcerated persons from their courts who may, consistent with Indiana \nlaw, be released to home detention    \n \n32.  As noted above, Indiana trial courts have tools at their disposal to determine if \nboth pretrial detainees and convicted incarcerated persons should be released from \nincarceration.  And,  as  indicated,  the  DOC  possesses  statutory  authority  to  “make \narrangements for placement outside the department” for convicted offenders who cannot \nbe safely housed within the DOC because of physical incapacity. Ind. Code § 11-10-1-3(d). \n33.  The ACLU of Indiana wishes to stress that it is not faulting the DOC, Indiana’s \ntrial courts, or any other persons or entities concerning their responses to the COVID-19 \ncrisis and the particular risk the disease poses to incarcerated persons. To the contrary, it \nappears  that  all  relevant  persons  and  entities  recognize  the  risks  created  by  the \nextraordinary circumstances confronting the world. However, this Court must utilize its \nsupervisory authority over the trial courts of this State and advance the duty that courts \nhave to “protect the constitutional rights of citizens,” Kokenes v. State, 213 Ind. 476, 491, \n13 N.E.2d 524, 530 (1938), to order all trial courts in Indiana with criminal jurisdiction to \n17 \n \n\nimmediately take steps to determine if incarcerated pretrial detainees and convicted \npersons may be safely released from county jails and DOC facilities so they may benefit \nfrom  the  social  isolation  and  the  shelter-in-place  protocols  recommended  by  all \nauthorities. \n34.  Specifically, this Court should request the Indiana Department of Correction and \neach county sheriff to: \n  a.   Immediately compile a list of all prisoners under their control who are at \n  heightened risk for severe illness or death from COVID-19 because they are 65 \n  or older or have the following high-risk conditions: \n \n•  chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma \n•  serious heart conditions \n•  compromised immune systems for any reason, including  cancer \ntreatment, bone marrow or organ transplantation, poorly controlled \nHIV  or  AIDS,  and  prolonged  use  of  corticosteroids  and  other \nimmune weakening medications \n•  severe obesity (body mass index ≥ 40) \n•  uncontrolled medical conditions such as diabetes, renal failure or \nliver disease \n \nSee Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-\n19),  People  who  are  at  higher  risk  for  severe  illness,  at  https://www.cdc.gov/ \ncoronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html. \n \nb.  Immediately compile a list of pretrial detainees who are currently being \nheld based on: \n \n•  Non-violent misdemeanor charges; \n•  Non-violent felony charges that would be eligible for a probationary, \nhome  detention,  or  work-release  sentence  if  a  conviction  were \nsecured; \n•  The inability to pay an imposed money bond, where a court has \nmade the judicial determination that the individual is bailable; \n18 \n \n\n•  Arrest for an allegation of violation of parole or probation, where the \nviolation does not constitute a separate, violent offense. \n \nc.   Immediately compile a list of convicted prisoners who are within 6 months \nof their expected release date. \n \nd.  Transmit this list to the Indiana court which committed the prisoner to the \nparticular jail or prison along with any recommendation as to whether, in the \nopinion of the penal institution or Sheriff, the prisoner merits consideration for \nrelease, either temporary or permanent, given the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n35.  This Court should order each court receiving the above list of prisoners compiled \nby the Sheriff to immediately determine: \na.  In the case of pretrial detainees, whether bail requirements should be \nwaived pursuant to Indiana law so that the person may shelter at home. \n \n  b.   In  the  case  of  convicted  persons,  whether  a  sentence  reduction  or \n  suspension is warranted under Indiana law so the person may shelter at home. \n \n36.  Independent of the list created by the local sheriff, this Court should order each \ncourt with criminal jurisdiction to immediately review its docket and ascertain which \nprisoners have had a bail amount established but who remain incarcerated solely because \nthey have not paid bail.  Each court may coordinate its efforts with the office of the county \nsheriff to obtain all names as quickly as possible. So that they may be sheltered at home, \nthe court should then at once determine if the prisoners can be released on their own \nrecognizance or through a substantial reduction in their bail to an amount that the court \ndetermines the individual capable of paying without undue hardship.  \n37.  To the extent that the procedure for reduction or sentence suspension under \nIndiana Code § 35-38-1-7 is utilized, this Court should further order that if notice to the \n19 \n \n\nprosecutor and victim is necessary, it be given electronically or telephonically so that the \ntrial court can issue a decision in the most expeditious manner possible. \n38.  This Court should further order trial courts to take all actions necessary and \nappropriate in their discretion to attempt to reduce in the future the number of persons \ncommitted to jails as pretrial detainees so they may shelter at home.  \n39.  This Court should further order trial courts to consider all other available options \nto determine if they should exercise their lawful discretion to reduce the sentences of \nprisoners so they may be released to shelter at home.  \n40.  This Court should request that the Indiana Department of Correction have the \nIndiana Parole Board advance parole considerations to the greatest extent possible to \nplace prisoners who merit parole at this time on parole so they may shelter at home, and \nshould further request that the Indiana Department of Correction review whether any at-\nrisk prisoners are appropriate for temporary release pursuant its authority under Indiana \nCode § 11-10-1-3(c) (adult offenders) or Indiana Code § 11-10-2-5(b) (juvenile offenders). \n41.  The ACLU of Indiana, of course, recognizes that even these steps will not eliminate \nthe danger that the COVID-19 pandemic poses for Indiana’s prisons or jails, nor will it \nensure the safety of all at-risk persons.  However, ensuring that a critical mass of \nprisoners are removed to a safe environment will inure to the benefit of all inmates and \ntheir jailers, for relieving population pressures will assist prisoners and staff in complying \n20 \n \n\nwith the CDC’s hygienic guidelines and its guidelines for social distancing to the greatest \nextent possible. \nVIII.  Conclusion \n42.  We live in extraordinary times. The adversary here is not a defendant; it is a \ndisease that, at least at this point, appears relentless. The only way of hoping to stop the \ndeadly spread of the disease is for all of us to practice social distancing and sanitary \ntechniques—measures that cannot be meaningfully achieved by Indiana’s prisoners. If \nthe jails and prisons can be depopulated it will benefit not just the prisoners themselves, \nbut those who still work there and who return to their families and communities at the \nend of every day. This unprecedented emergency calls for emergency measures by this \nCourt  and  the  ACLU  requests  that  this  Court  consider  this  petition  and  grant  all \nappropriate relief as necessary to help stem the progression of the disease. \nWHEREFORE,  the  ACLU  of  Indiana  respectfully  submits  its  petition  for \nemergency rulemaking, and requests the issuance of all appropriate relief. \n \n                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n21 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n/s/ Kenneth J.

      "text": "State of  Indiana \nApril 3, 2020 \nThe coronavirus pandemic (\"COVID-19\") has affected our entire state and nation in ways that were unimaginable just a \nfew short months ago. This dangerous virus is spreading rapidly in the State of Indiana, and it is having wide-ranging \nimpacts on individuals, families, communities, workers and businesses, as well as every sector of public and private life. \nDespite extraordinary and unprecedented steps that have been taken, COVID-19 remains a threat to the health, safety \nand welfare of all residents of Indiana. \nIn recent weeks, there have been many judges, sheriffs, and local justice partners across our State who have worked \nclosely with each other and their public health stakeholders on the issue of whether or not to release low-risk, non-violent \njuveniles and inmates to supervision within their communities. With inmates, juveniles, staff, and service providers \nliving and working in confined spaces, there is enhanced potential for COVID-19 to enter a facility and spread. This \npotential, however, can be mitigated and reduced through implementation of aggressive proactive measures such as \nthose taken at state correctional facilities. But at the local and county level, while Indiana's sheriffs have a duty to \nprovide medical care to those in their custody, the resources and ability to treat and quarantine infected individuals are \noften limited and more difficult. \nIn light of the above, the undersigned representatives of all three branches of Indiana government recognize that these \ntypes of decisions will continue to and must be made by local judges, sheriffs, and county leaders across our State as we \ncontinue to move through this public health emergency in the days and weeks ahead. Given the unique threat posed by \nCOVID-19, we encourage every community that is or will be undertaking a process to evaluate whether to release \njuveniles and inmates, to do so in a responsible and humane manner. They should review the current facility population \nto properly identify which low-risk, non-violent juveniles and inmates, if any, may be re-evaluated and released safely \ninto their communities under pretrial, probation, or community corrections supervision. This is not a question of being \nsoft on crime or criminals, but rather it's a matter of need in a time of a widespread public health emergency affecting our \nentire State, at the local level. \nDetermining who fits into which category is a question of individual offenders, local resources and capacity, local \ncommunity support, and local health conditions. No Indiana-size solution would fit all. But, for the sake of those low-\nrisk, non-violent juveniles and inmates who could be released safely, the staff and law enforcement officers who enter our \njails and juvenile detention facilities daily, and our healthcare workers battling COVID-19 everywhere they encounter it, \nwe encourage the local judges, sheriffs and county leaders to work collaboratively when making these important \ndecisions and we applaud their responsible efforts in this regard.  \nGov. Eric Holcomb  Hon. Loretta Rush \nGovernor of Indiana   Chief Justice of Indiana \nRodric Bray, Senate President Pro Tem  Todd Huston, House Speaker \nIndiana Senate  Indiana House of Representatives \n121st General Assembly  121st General Assembly ",

      "text": "In the \nIndiana Supreme Court \n        Supreme Court Case No. \nIn the Matter of Petition Requesting the \n        20S-MS-234  \nIndiana Supreme Court to Engage in \n \n \nEmergency Rulemaking to Address the Issue \n \nof Imprisoned Persons and the COVID-19 \nCrisis  \n \n   \n \nPublished Order \nOn March 30, 2020, the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana (“ACLU”) filed a \npetition alleging the 2019 novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) threatens persons detained, jailed, \nand incarcerated in Indiana, and inviting this Court to engage in emergency rulemaking to \nfacilitate release of such persons. Responses to the petition have been filed. The ACLU has \ntendered a reply, which this Court directs the Clerk to show filed as of its April 7, 2020 date of \ntender. The Court has reviewed the filed materials. Each Justice has had the opportunity to voice \nthat Justice’s views on this matter in conference with the other Justices, and each has voted on the \npetition. \nThis Court has original jurisdiction in, among other things, supervision of the exercise of \njurisdiction by the other courts of the State and issuance of writs necessary or appropriate in aid \nof its jurisdiction. Ind. Const., art. 7, § 4. In accordance with that jurisdiction, this Court “has \nauthority to adopt, amend, and rescind rules of court that govern and control practice and \nprocedure in all the courts of Indiana.” Ind. Code § 34-8-1-3. The petition seeks to invoke that \noriginal jurisdiction and rule-making authority.  \nThe petition, however, asks this Court to request that the Indiana Department of \nCorrection (“D.O.C.”) and county sheriffs take certain actions. A plea for such requests to non-\ncourt entities does not invoke this Court’s original jurisdiction and rule-making authority. Other \nparts of the petition ask this Court to order that trial courts take actions. Yet the ACLU \naccurately acknowledges that Indiana trial courts already have tools at their disposal to \ndetermine if pretrial detainees and convicted persons should be released from incarceration, \nPet., ¶32, and it notes the need to act “consistent with existing law[.]” Reply, p.6. Statutes \nauthorize, for example, suspension of all or part of a sentence or placement on probation for the \nsuspended portion of a sentence as part of a post-conviction forensic diversion program under \nI.C. § 11-12-3.7-12; review of sentencing when a juvenile offender turns eighteen years of age, \nI.C. § 31-30-4-5; reduction or suspension of a sentence under I.C. § 35-38-1-17; home detention \n\nunder I.C. § 35-38-1-21; and modification of a sentence of a person assigned to a community \ntransition program, in accordance with I.C. § 35-38-1-25.  \nThis Court has taken steps to address generally concerns expressed in the petition. The Chief \nJustice met with the Governor and the Leadership of the General Assembly. This resulted in \nissuance of a joint letter on April 3, 2020. The letter refers to proactive measures taken by the \nState’s correctional facilities, which are also listed in the D.O.C.’s response to the petition. From \nthe very beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, many judges, sheriffs, prosecutors, local health \nofficials, county representatives, public defenders, and other local justice partners took the \ninitiative and worked together with each other to release low-risk, nonviolent juveniles and \ninmates to supervision within their communities. The letter encourages counties and \ncommunities, including courts, to review the population of local detention facilities and jails to \nidentify which low-risk, nonviolent juveniles and inmates, if any, may be released safely into their \ncommunities under pretrial, probation, or community corrections supervision.  \nFurther, the Court has issued emergency orders under Indiana Administrative Rule 17, one \nof which authorizes courts to review county-jail and direct placement community correction \nsentences of non-violent inmates and juveniles and, after consultation with a team comprising \nlocal prosecutors, a public defender, community corrections, the county sheriff, and local health \nauthorities, to modify sentences to probation and take other action. In re the Matter of Administrative \nRule 17 Emergency Relief in the Indiana Trial Courts Related to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), \nNo. 20S-CB-123, p.2 (Ind. April 3, 2020). That order also helps regulate the number of those in \njail by (1) limiting the circumstances in which courts may issue writs of attachment, civil bench \nwarrants, or body attachments under Trial Rule 64 until the expiration of the public health \nemergency, and (2) stays service of those writs of attachment, civil bench warrants, or body \nattachments issued but not yet served prior to April 3, 2020, until expiration of the public health \nemergency. Id.  \nFinally, the ACLU states its understanding that many counties have already taken steps to \nreduce their jail populations, Pet., ¶27, and it recognizes the extraordinary steps being taken to \nprotect Hoosiers, some of which have been highlighted by the responses. Reply, p.3. We applaud \nthe efforts of all, including the D.O.C. and county criminal justice and health partners, who have \ncollaboratively taken measures in response to the COVID-19 emergency and are examining or \nreexamining the status of those jailed or incarcerated in Indiana.     \nFor all the reasons set out above, the Court DENIES the petition for emergency rulemaking.   \nDone at Indianapolis, Indiana, on  _4_/8_/_2_02_0_____ . \nLoretta H.
