    "summary": "<p>On March 30, 2020, the Pennsylvania Prison Society and five incarcerated individuals, represented by the ACLU of Pennsylvania, filed an emergency petition with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Petitioners argued that under state law the Supreme Court had legal authority to reduce jail populations and that extraordinary measures in other states were indicative of the need for jail population reductions. Petitioners urged the Court to instruct all courts in the Commonwealth to immediately order county jails within their respective jurisdictions to release the following categories of people, subject to the objection provision outlined below:</p>\r\n<blockquote>a. Those who are within three months of, or beyond, their minimum sentence;</blockquote>\r\n<p>b. Those under a probation detainer (or serving a sentence) for a violation of probation or county parole where the violation does not arise out of the commission of a new felony offense;</p>\r\n<p>c. Those eligible to periodically leave their correctional facilities, such as those eligible for work release or serving intermittent sentences (e.g., weekends);</p>\r\n<p>d. Those detained pretrial solely due to an order imposing cash bail; and</p>\r\n<p>e. Any incarcerated person at increased risk of severe COVID-19 complications and death as defined by the CDC, including those over the age of 45, and people with any of the following underlying medical conditions: blood disorders, chronic kidney or liver disease, compromised immune system, endocrine disorders (including diabetes), metabolic disorders, heart and lung disease, neurological and neurologic and neurodevelopmental conditions, and current or recent pregnancy. Petitioners also requested that the Court take additional measures to reduce jail populations, including the cessation of setting cash bails, prioritizing hearings for in-custody defendants, and ensuring the availability of a venue for criminal proceedings. They also requested a special master to oversee compliance with the requests outlined above.</p>\r\n<p>On April 3, 2020, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania denied the petition. 2020 WL 3116883. The court recognized the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic, but denied the petition because the immediate release of certain persons failed to consider the potential danger of inmates to the general population and the diversity of situations. Even so, the court directed that the President Judges of each judicial district coordinate with county officials to ensure that the county correctional institutions were adequately addressing the threat of COVID-19 and applying the recommendations of public health officials. If the recommendations of those officials could not be followed, President Judges were ordered to work with county officials to identify persons for potential release or transfer to reduce the populations held in institutions. President Judges were also ordered to take steps to limit the introduction of new inmates. Chief Justice Saylor wrote a concurring opinion, stating that, the Governor should issue an Executive Order, as the authority to release prisoners on account of a disaster emergency rests with him. 2020 WL 3109546.</p>\r\n<p>The deadline for reconsideration was on May 12; the case is closed.</p>",

INTRODUCTION \nThis petition presents an extraordinary issue of public safety: the urgent need \nto protect the health of all Pennsylvania residents and save lives by limiting the \nspread of COVID-19 among incarcerated people and staff in Pennsylvania’s \ncounty jails.1 Leading public health officials have warned that unless courts act \nnow, the “epicenter of the pandemic will be jails and prisons.”2 The U.S. Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) has explained that correctional and \ndetention facilities “present unique challenges for control of COVID-19 \ntransmission among incarcerated persons, detention center staff, and visitors.”3  As \nDr. Joseph Amon, Director of Global Health at Drexel University states, “County \njails were not built for the needs of this kind of pandemic” and the “spread of \nCOVID-19 within the jails will affect not only those who are being held there, but \n                                           \n1 For purposes of this petition, “county jail” means “county correctional \ninstitution,” as that term is defined in 61 Pa.C.S.A. § 102. \n2 Amanda Klonsky, An Epicenter of the Pandemic Will Be Jails and Prisons, if \nInaction Continues, The New York Times (Mar. 12, 2020), https://www.nytimes\n.com/2020/03/16/opinion/coronavirus-in-jails.html. \n3 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Interim Guidance on \nManagement of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and \nDetention Facilities (“CDC Guidance”) (Mar. 23, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov\n/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-\ndetention.html. \n  1 \n\nalso the correctional officers who work there, and the communities they go back \nto.”  Amon Decl. ¶¶ 19, 40.4 \nAcross Pennsylvania, it is not possible for county jails to implement the \nmost critical preventive measures set forth in the CDC Guidance: social distancing, \npreventive hygiene, and the medical isolation of confirmed or suspected \nCOVID-19 cases.5 Governor Wolf, Health Secretary Levine and this Court (in its \nMarch 16th and 18th Orders) have made efforts to enforce social distancing and \nlimit the spread of the virus and prospective death toll. However, jails and \nprisons—by necessity, but in direct contravention of all public health and medical \nadvice— force detainees and staff into tight quarters where frequent touching and \nunhygienic practices are the norm.6  County jails simply do not have the space to \nkeep incarcerated individuals six feet apart. Pennsylvania jails routinely double- or \ntriple-cell people, and confine large numbers together in one room, where they \n                                           \n4 Dr. Amon’s Declaration is attached as Exhibit A to this Petition (“Amon Decl.”), \nwith his C.V. attached as Exhibit B.  Dr. Amon is an internationally recognized \nauthority on infectious disease control, clinical care, and obligations of government \nrelated to individuals in detention settings.  \n5 See generally, CDC Guidance; see also Amon Decl. ¶¶ 45-46; Declaration of Dr. \nJonathan Golob at ¶ 13 (attached as Exhibit C). Dr. Golob is on the faculty of the \nUniversity of Michigan School of Medicine, where he specializes in the study of \nspread of infection in immunocompromised patients and is actively involved in \nplanning for the care of patients with COVID-19. See Ex. D. \n6 Petitioners are submitting the declarations of several witnesses to attest to current \njail conditions, including volunteers with the Petitioner Pennsylvania Prison \nSociety (Exibits J, K, and L) and the individual Petitioners, each of whom is \ncurrently incarcerated (Exhibits E, F, G, H, and I).  \n  2 \n\nsleep arm’s length apart, eat shoulder to shoulder, and share rarely sanitized \nbathrooms. Nor do jails have the capacity to isolate symptomatic individuals. \nMany of these facilities lack adequate onsite health care services to evaluate or \nquarantine infected individuals in the manner dictated by infection-control \nguidance.  \nUnder these conditions, once COVID-19 enters a correctional facility, it is \nvirtually certain to spread like wildfire through the prison population, correctional \nstaff, and into the nearby community.  This is already happening in places like \nNew York, where viral spread is a week or more ahead of Pennsylvania.7  This is \nnot just a prisoners’ rights issue.  Once the virus enters the jails, the regular \nmovement of staff and visitors in and out means that prison walls and razor wire \ncan neither slow nor stop viral spread.  This impending viral explosion – \nimminently likely to occur in all sixty-seven counties – will directly impact all \nCommonwealth residents, including correctional staff, their families, and their \nrespective communities.  Failure to address the spread of the virus in jails will \n                                           \n7 In a court filing last week, the Legal Aid Society of New York noted that the \nvirus’s exponential rate of infection in New York City jails far outpaces the \nnational average, with Riker’s Island experiencing an infection rate roughly 85 \ntimes the rate in the community-at-large.  Verified Petition for Writ of Habeas \nCorpus (“NYLAS Petition”), People ex rel. Stoughton v. Brann, No. 260154/2020, \nat ¶ 3 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Mar. 25, 2020). \n  3 \n\nundermine the effectiveness of government-mandated measures to enforce social \ndistancing, which now cover millions of Pennsylvanians.   \nOf the approximately 37,000 people currently detained in Pennsylvania’s \ncounty jails, more than half are in pre-trial status, and therefore presumed \ninnocent.8 Many are held on probation detainers due to technical violations or \nminor offenses, cannot afford modest bail, or have been deemed eligible for work \nrelease by a judge.  Of the people serving a jail sentence in a Pennsylvania county \njail—which, by law, includes only those individuals sentenced to a maximum term \nof two years or less, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9762(b)(3)—many have already completed their \nminimum terms of incarceration or are mere weeks away from doing so.  \nIn light of the looming public health catastrophe, keeping such persons \nimprisoned where they face unnecessary health risks is inhumane and violates their \nrights under the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution and Article I, Sections One, Thirteen, and Fourteen of the \nPennsylvania Constitution. Indeed, for some individuals who are older or suffer \nfrom pre-existing medical problems, continued detention may literally be \nconsigning them to a death sentence. \n                                           \n8 Vera Institute, Incarceration Trends in Pennsylvania, www.vera.org/downloads\n/pdfdownloads/state-incarceration-trends-pennsylvania.pdf (noting that, as of 2015, \npeople held pretrial constituted 62% of the total jail population in Pennsylvania).  \n  4 \n\nThis Court, recognizing the public health threat presented by COVID-19 and \nacknowledging the need to “restrict person-to-person contact,” issued emergency \norders on March 16th and 18th closing Pennsylvania Courts to the public. Public \nhealth imperatives require that this Court take far more dramatic steps. Indeed, for \nthis  same  reason,  courts  in  many  other  jurisdictions  around  the  country  have \nrecognized that the public health emergency compels evaluation and release of \nsignificant numbers of people who pose little threat to public safety and will be \nendangered by continued imprisonment. Most notably, last week, in response to the \n“dangers posed by the Coronavirus,” the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered the \npresumptive release of all people currently serving a county jail sentence, an order \nlikely to result in the release of more than 1,000 people. In the Matter of the Request \nto Commute or Suspend County Jail Sentences, Consent Order, (N.J. No. 084230 \nMarch 22, 2020).  New Jersey is not alone; jurist in the highest courts of Washington, \nSouth Carolina, Maine, and Montana have all taken similar measures.   \nThis Court has the legal authority to follow the precedent set by New Jersey \nand these other jurisdictions. Justice demands no less. While a limited number of \ncounties in the Commonwealth have adopted incremental case-by-case measures to \nlimit jail populations, and one county (Allegheny County) has taken systemic steps \nto reduce its jail population, most judicial districts are taking a business-as-usual \napproach, failing to address, or even recognize, the looming public health \n  5 \n\ncatastrophe. Such a piecemeal approach, relying on individual law enforcement \nand judicial officers to decide what action to take, is insufficient to address the \nurgency of the moment.  \nThis Court has the power under Pennsylvania Constitution Article V, \nSections 2 and 10(a), 42 Pa. Const. Stat. § 502, and Rule of Judicial Administration \n1952(A) to provide for the necessary broad-based reduction of county jail \npopulations. It is this relief that petitioners respectfully urge the Court to order. \nSpecifically, for the reasons outlined below, petitioners request that the Court (1) \ndirect the presumptive release, subject to challenge by district attorneys, of discrete \ncategories of incarcerated people; and (2) direct the courts of the Commonwealth \nto institute measures that will further limit jail populations. This relief is warranted, \nreasonable, and, above all, essential in light of the unprecedented public health risk \nfacing the Commonwealth’s residents. \nII.  PETITIONERS \nPetitioner, the Pennsylvania Prison Society, founded in 1787, is the \nnation’s oldest human rights organization. Petitioner’s mission is to ensure humane \nprison conditions and to advocate for a restorative approach to criminal justice. \nThe Prison Society advances its mission through three programmatic areas: (1) \nprison monitoring, (2) social services support to family members with incarcerated \nloved ones, and (3) education and advocacy.  Written into Pennsylvania law, the \n  6 \n\nPrison Society is the Commonwealth’s prison ombuds, working to stop abuse and \ntrauma.  Every month, more than 250 incarcerated people and their families ask the \nSociety for help with issues they face inside prison.  Society staff and volunteers \nrespond to these complaints by going into correctional facilities, meeting with \nincarcerated people, working to resolve concerns, and providing real-time \ninformation on prison conditions.  The Prison Society is the only organization that \nprovides public witness to what happens behind prison walls.  Declarations of \nseveral Prison Society volunteers attesting to current conditions in certain jails in \nsupport of this Petition are attached as Exhibits J, K, and L. \nIndividual petitioners are five incarcerated individuals currently in custody \nat different county facilities, all of whom are incarcerated for minor offenses, and \nare at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 as a result of their incarceration.  As \neach individual petitioner testifies in his declaration, current living situations in \neach facility, including shared living quarters, make it impossible for incarcerated \nindividuals to maintain the recommended six-foot distance from one another.   \n1.  Petitioner Brian McHale, 44, is in custody on a probation detainer at \nthe Montgomery County Correctional Facility (“MCCF”) as a result \nof alleged technical violations of his probation for retail theft \nconvictions.  Ex. E, Declaration of Brian McHale at ¶¶ 2-3.  Because \nof several serious health conditions, see id. at ¶¶ 4-7, Petitioner \nMcHale faces an elevated likelihood of serious harm and death should \nhe contract the virus.  At MCCF, he shares a cell with two other men.  \nId. at ¶ 8.   \n  7 \n\nPetitioner McHale filed an emergency habeas petition for release due \nto his medical condition and susceptibility to COVID-19.  The \nMontgomery County Court of Common Pleas deferred consideration \nuntil after “the expiration of the judicial emergency.”  Id. ¶¶ 12-16.   \n2.  Petitioner Jeremy Hunsicker, 33, is detained at a Community \nCorrection Center (“CCC”) in Lehigh County.  Ex. F, Declaration of \nJeremy Hunsicker at ¶  2.  While on parole for driving under the \ninfluence, Petitioner Hunsicker was arrested for driving with a \nsuspended licensed.  Id. at ¶ 3.  His parole was revoked and he was \nresentenced to six to twelve months, with another six to twelve \nmonths for driving with a suspended license.  Id.  Petitioner Hunsicker \nis eligible for work release, and is currently housed in a pod with \nabout twenty other people. Id. at ¶¶ 5, 8.  \n3.  Petitioner Christopher Aubry, 55, is incarcerated at MCCF on a one \nto twenty-three month sentence for simple assault and related \nmisdemeanor charges.  Ex. G, Declaration of Christopher Aubry at \n¶¶ 2-3.  He is work release eligible and currently housed in a pod with \napproximately fifty other people. Id. at ¶¶ 5-6.  \n4.  Petitioner Michael Foundos, 39, is detained at George W. Hill \nCorrectional Facility in Delaware County.  Ex. H, Declaration of \nMichael Foundos at ¶¶ 2.  Charged with retail theft, he has a probation \ndetainer and a $50,000 bond. Foundos Decl. at ¶¶ 4-6.  At his facility, \neach cell block contains 30 cells, and cells are generally shared by two \npeople. Id. at ¶ 9. \n5.  Petitioner Frederick Leonard, 29, is incarcerated at Pike County \nCorrectional Facility for a six to twenty-three-and-a-half month \nsentence for driving under the influence, driving with a suspended \nlicense, and fleeing.  Ex. I, Declaration of Frederick Leonard at ¶¶ 2-\n3.  He has several health conditions that place him at elevated risk of \nserious harm and death should he contract the virus.  Id. at ¶ 4.  At his \nfacility, he shares a cell with two other individuals. Id. at ¶ 5. \nIII.  JURISDICTION \nThe Court has jurisdiction pursuant to its King’s Bench authority to decide \nthis application and order the requested relief to “cause right and justice to be \n  8 \n\ndone” in this matter involving “an issue of immediate public importance.” \n42 Pa.C.S.A. § 726 and Pa. Const. art. V, § 10(a). \nIV.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA.  In the absence of preventive measures, COVID-19 is a rapidly \nspreading public health crisis, resulting in serious medical \nconditions or death for large numbers of high-risk individuals. \nCOVID-19 is a disease that has reached pandemic status. According to the \nWorld Health Organization, as of March 29, there were more than 638,146 \nconfirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide and more than 30,105 confirmed deaths. \nThe United States has the highest number of confirmed cases in the world—more \nthan 135,499—and 2,381 confirmed deaths. Amon Decl. ¶ 5. In Pennsylvania, as \nof March 29 at 4:30 p.m., there are 3,394 confirmed cases and 38 reported deaths, \nmore than twice the number reported three days earlier and seven times the \nnumbers reported just a week earlier. Id.9  CDC’s projections show that, without \neffective public health intervention, more than 200 million people in the United \nStates could be infected with COVID-19, with as many as 1.5 million deaths in the \nmost severe projections. Golob Decl. ¶ 11. \n                                           \n9 The rapid rise of the pandemic means that at the time of submission, the number \nof confirmed cases and deaths discussed in Dr. Amon’s Declaration will have \ngrown exponentially. The declaration was prepared based on the data available to \nDr. Amon at the time. \n  9 \n\nPeople over the age of 45 and those with certain medical conditions face a \ngreater risk of serious illness from COVID-19, and those over the age of 55 face \nthe highest risk of death. Amon Decl. ¶ 9; Golob Decl. ¶ 3. The medical conditions \nthat increase the risk of serious complications from COVID-19 include lung \ndisease, heart disease, chronic liver or kidney disease (including patients with \nhepatitis and those requiring dialysis), diabetes, compromised immune systems \n(such as from cancer, HIV, or autoimmune disease), blood disorders (including \nsickle cell disease), inherited metabolic disorders, stroke, and developmental delay. \nGolob Decl. ¶ 3. People with these conditions are at an increased risk of \ndeveloping serious complications or dying from COVID-19, regardless of age. \nGolob Decl. ¶ 3; Amon Decl. ¶¶ 7-9. \nThe need for care, including intensive care, and the likelihood of death, is \nmuch higher from COVID-19 than from influenza. Golob Decl. ¶ 4. According to \nrecent estimates, the fatality rate for people with COVID-19 is about ten times \nhigher than a severe seasonal influenza, even in advanced countries with highly \neffective health care systems. Id. For people in the highest risk populations, the \nfatality rate of COVID-19 is about 15 percent. Golob Decl. ¶ 4. This means about \none in seven infected individuals in this high-risk group will die from COVID-19.  \nPatients in high-risk categories who do not die from COVID-19 should expect a \nprolonged recovery, including the need for extensive rehabilitation for profound \n  10 \n\nreconditioning, loss of digits, neurologic damage, and the loss of respiratory \ncapacity. Golob Decl. ¶¶ 4, 5 & 8. \nB.  The key measures to prevent spread of COVID-19 are impossible \nin county jails, making severe outbreaks likely in those facilities \nand the communities around them. \nThe only known effective measure to reduce the risk of serious illness and \ndeath that COVID-19 presents for vulnerable people is to prevent them from being \ninfected in the first place. Golob Decl. ¶ 10; Amon Decl. ¶ 6. There is no vaccine \nto inoculate against COVID-19 and there is no known medication to treat \nCOVID-19. Golob Decl. ¶ 10; Amon Decl. ¶ 6. Social distancing, quarantining or \nremaining physically separated from known or potentially infected individuals, and \nvigilant hygiene, including washing hands with soap and water, are the only known \neffective measures for protecting vulnerable people. Golob Decl. ¶ 10; Amon Decl. \n¶ 13.  \nPeople detained in county jails cannot take these necessary measures to \nmitigate the risk of exposure. They are, therefore, at heightened risk of COVID-19 \ninfection. Amon Decl. ¶¶ 24-26. County jails are “congregate settings,” places \nwhere people live or sleep in close proximity. Such enclosed group environments, \nlike cruise ships or nursing homes, have become the sites for the most severe \noutbreaks of COVID-19. Amon Decl. ¶¶ 19, 20. Conditions in correctional \nfacilities create heightened public health risks for the spread of COVID-19 far \n  11 \n\ngreater than in non-custodial institutions because of crowding, security-related \nrestrictions, scant medical resources, and the proportion of vulnerable people \ndetained. Id. at ¶ 20; Golob Decl. ¶ 13. Recent experience in the Rikers Island \nfacility in New York City bears out the devastating impact of COVID-19 infection \nin a jail setting. The Legal Aid Society in New York reported that the COVID-19 \ninfection rate at Rikers is more than seven times higher than the rate across New \nYork City and 85 times greater than the country at large.10 \nAs the rate of infection increases in Pennsylvania,11 the same phenomenon \nseen at Rikers Island is likely to repeat itself in the Commonwealth’s county jails. \nCOVID-19 has already been reported in Delaware County’s jail. See Amon Decl. \n¶¶ 19, 20, 30. And, on March 27, 2020, Philadelphia reported that both an \nemployee and an inmate tested positive for COVID-19 in its jails. Amon Decl. \n¶ 30.  \nTransmission in jails will endanger not only the incarcerated, but also the \nbroader community. As correctional staff enter and leave the facility, they will \n                                           \n10 See NYLAS Petition, n.1. \n11 Dr. P.J. Brennan, Chief Medical Officer of the University of Pennsylvania \nHealth System, has stated that the Philadelphia area is “no more than two weeks \nbehind New York City” in the rate of infection.  Marie McCullough & Lisa \nGartner, Philadelphia-area hospitals brace for the coronavirus surge: ‘We are no \nmore than 2 weeks behind N.Y.C.,’ The Philadelphia Inquirer (March 27, 2020), \nwww.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/philadelphia-coronavirus-cases-hospitals-\ntesting-covid-20200327. \n  12 \n\ncarry the virus with them. Amon Decl. ¶ 19.12 Like the incarcerated people in the \nfacilities where they work, correctional officers face an increased risk of \nCOVID-19 exposure because they are less able to engage in required social \ndistancing. Amon Decl. ¶ 32. In addition to staff testing positive in Philadelphia \nand Delaware Counties, several jurisdictions across the country have reported that \ncorrectional officers have tested positive for the virus. Amon Decl. ¶¶ 29, 30. \nBeyond the risk they pose to those incarcerated at the facility when they enter, \ncorrectional officers expose their families and broader communities to substantial \nrisk every time they leave a correctional facility at the end of their daily shifts. 13 \nThe possibility of a COVID-19 outbreak among incarcerated people, the staff, \nand  the  communities  around  them  is  exacerbated  because  county  jails  cannot \nimplement the CDC’s recommended preventative measures in at least four respects.  \n1.  Social distancing is not possible in county jails at their \ncurrent population levels. \nSocial distancing is the most important means to prevent the spread of \nCOVID-19 because the disease is primarily transmitted between people who are in \n                                           \n12 Josiah Rich, et al., We Must Release Prisoners to Lessen the Spread of \nCoronavirus, The Washington Post (Mar. 17, 2020), www.washingtonpost.com\n/opinions/2020/03/17/we-must-release-prisoners-lessen-spread-coronavirus (The \nauthors (including a professor of medicine and epidemiology) warn that unless we \nact swiftly to release people from jails and prisons, the virus threatens not only \nprisoners and corrections workers but the general public as well). \n13 See Rich, et al., supra n. 12. \n  13 \n\nclose contact with one another (within about six feet) via respiratory droplets \nproduced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Amon Decl. ¶ 13. Social \ndistancing is so imperative that Governor Wolf has ordered people in 19 counties \nnot to leave their homes. Amon Decl. ¶ 14. As of March 27, at least 25 states, 74 \ncounties, and 14 cities were under similar stay-at-home orders. Governors in 40 \nstates have barred even small social gatherings. The extraordinary impact on more \nthan 200 million people due to stay-at-home orders and mandatory business \nclosures, including several million throughout Pennsylvania, has been deemed \nnecessary for one reason: to ensure appropriate social distancing. \nCDC guidance on correctional and detention facilities specifically \nrecommends implementing social distancing (“ideally 6 feet between individuals, \nregardless of the presence of symptoms”)14 to increase the physical space between \nincarcerated persons. Amon Decl. ¶ 21. Yet individuals in county jails in the \nCommonwealth have no ability to practice social distancing.  \nFor example, in Montgomery County Correctional Facility, numerous cells \nthroughout the facility are shared by three people—meaning that three people share \nthe same confined space, one toilet, and one sink. In addition to their cellmates, \neach incarcerated person has close contact with thirteen other individuals on his \nunit and up to fifty other people on his “pod.” Amon Decl. ¶ 24. In Lehigh \n                                           \n14 CDC Guidance at 11. \n  14 \n\nCounty’s Community Corrections Center, up to seventy people eat meals together \nat one time, and close contact with other incarcerated persons is unavoidable \nduring regular medical checks. Id. In Blair County Prison, beds are just three to \nfour feet apart. Amon Decl. ¶ 25. In Allegheny County, newly arrested individuals \ntypically are held for more than a day in an intake cell, usually with ten or more \npeople sharing a single toilet and sink. Amon Decl. ¶ 25.  \nIn these circumstances, county jails will not be able to prevent COVID-19 \ntransmission once the virus is inevitably introduced into the jail.  \n2.  County jails do not have sufficient supplies for the enhanced \nhygiene and disinfecting necessary to prevent the spread of \nCOVID-19. \nThe CDC Guidance also describes procedures necessary for individual \nhygiene and to thoroughly clean and disinfect areas where a person with confirmed \nor suspected COVID-19 spent time. Amon Decl. ¶ 22. In county jails, people share \ntoilets, sinks, and showers, without disinfection between each use. Id. at ¶ 20. Food \npreparation and service is communal with little opportunity for surface \ndisinfection. Id. County jails do not have enough supplies for individuals to wash \ntheir hands or to disinfect the space around them. Amon Decl. ¶ 26. There is not \nsufficient hand sanitizer in Lehigh County’s Community Corrections Center or the \nMontgomery County Correctional Facility. Amon Decl. ¶ 24. Soap is limited in \nBlair County Prison and Allegheny County Jail. Amon Decl. ¶ 25. Failure to \n  15 \n\nprovide these supplies while requiring individuals in custody to use shared \nbathroom facilities and to eat in common spaces creates an intolerably high risk of \ninfectious spread.  \n3.  Proper isolation for symptomatic people is not possible in \ncounty jails. \nThe CDC guidance recommends “medical isolation of confirmed or \nsuspected COVID-19 cases.”15 Yet, once a person in a county jail has symptoms, \nproper isolation is not possible due to population size and the physical limitations \nof the facility. Amon Decl. ¶¶ 25-26.  Because of forced contact between many \nindividuals in crowded facilities, people who are exposed will need to be \nquarantined. Because most jails are at or near capacity, there simply is insufficient \nspace to house people consistent with the CDC-recommended quarantine protocol, \nwhich requires separating people to prevent further spread of the disease, or to \nhouse those who test positive in true isolation units.16 \n4.  County jails do not have the capacity to properly screen \nindividuals entering their facilities. \nCounty jails cannot implement screening measures necessary to prevent \nintroduction of the virus into the jails. The CDC recommends that jails adopt \nintensive pre-intake screening of all prisoners, and screen all staff and individuals \n                                           \n15 CDC Guidance at 15-16. \n16 CDC Guidance at 19. \n  16 \n\nentering the facility.17 Non-test based verbal screens—i.e., asking a person for a \nsubjective report of symptoms—cannot adequately screen for new, asymptomatic \nor pre-symptomatic infections. Id. at ¶ 27. As COVID-19 has a typical incubation \nperiod of five days, and transmission often occurs before presentation of \nsymptoms, such inadequate screening presents a critical problem. Golob Decl. ¶ 6. \nThe possibility of asymptomatic transmission means that monitoring staff or \nincarcerated people for fevers is inadequate to identify all who may be infected and \npreventing transmission. Amon Decl. at ¶ 27.  \nGiven the shortage of COVID-19 test kits in the United States, jails will not \nbe able to test people newly admitted to the facility, individuals on work release, \nstaff, visiting attorneys, or any other people who enter facilities daily. Amon Decl. \n¶¶ 27, 28. \nC.  Population reduction is the only way to prevent an outbreak of \nCOVID-19 in the county jails and to prevent the death of those at \nhighest risk. \nSignificant reduction of county jail populations is the only viable option to \nprotect incarcerated persons from COVID-19. Amon Decl. ¶ 47. Without reduction \nin the numbers of detained individuals, jails will be unable to implement the only \nscientifically recognized procedures that can reduce the risk of infection. Id. \nReducing county jail populations will allow the facilities to reduce the risk of \n                                           \n17 Id. at 7-11. \n  17 \n\ninfection for both incarcerated people and correctional officers, which in turn \nprotects the communities to which the officers return. Id.  \nPeople in prisons and jails are disproportionately likely to have chronic \nhealth conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and HIV, that put them \nat higher risk of severe health consequences upon contracting the virus. Amon \nDecl. ¶ 41.18 Large numbers of seriously ill incarcerated people will strain the \nlimited medical infrastructure in the jails, heightening the risk that infected \nindividuals will suffer serious harm.  \nSome county jails simply lack the necessary medical infrastructure to \naddress the spread of infectious disease and treatment of people most vulnerable to \nillness. Once COVID-19 spreads throughout a jail, the burden of caring for these \nsick individuals will shift to local community medical facilities. Because many \nrural parts of the Commonwealth have limited access to hospitals with intensive \ncare units or trained infectious disease practitioners, and limited personal \n                                           \n18 Jennifer Gonnerman, How Prisons and Jails Can Respond to the Coronavirus, \nThe New Yorker (Mar. 16, 2020), https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/how-\nprisons-and-jails-can-respond-to-the-coronavirus; see also I.A. Binswanger, et al., \nPrevalence of chronic medical conditions among jail and prison inmates in the \nUSA compared with the general population, 63 Journal of Epidemiology & \nCommunity Health 912–919 (2009), \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19648129 (concluding that people \nincarcerated in U.S. jails and prisons had a higher burden of most chronic medical \nconditions than the general population, even when adjusting for sociodemographic \ndifferences and alcohol consumption).  \n  18 \n\nprotective equipment and other life-sustaining supplies, thus there is an increased \nlikelihood of death for all individuals living in such rural communities who become \nill and require treatment. Amon Decl. ¶ 44. \n*  *  * \nIn sum, to effectively mitigate the risk of infection and subsequent spread of \nthe virus, the jail population must be reduced. Amon Decl. ¶ 47. Reducing the \noverall number of individuals in detention facilities allows social distancing for all \ninside, and allows infected individuals and their contacts, to be properly \nquarantined and monitored for health complications that require transfer to a local \nhospital. Id. It also lessens the risk to corrections officers, who, if short-staffed, \nwill have difficulty maintaining order and proper personal protective measures. Id. \nProtecting corrections staff in turn protects the communities they come from.  Id. \nUnless this Court orders measures to reduce the jail population, contagion will be \nmore widespread, already taxed hospitals strained further, and the mortality rate \nlikely to increase.  The time to act is now. \nV.  ARGUMENT \nA.  This Court has the legal authority to use its broad King’s Bench \njurisdiction to order the requested relief. \nThe Court has King’s Bench jurisdiction to decide this application in order \nto “cause right and justice to be done” in a matter involving “an issue of immediate \npublic importance.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 726 and Pa. Const. art. V, § 10(a). This case \n  19 \n\nraises “an issue of immediate public importance affecting operation of government \nthroughout the Commonwealth.” Silver v. Downs, 493 Pa. 50, 56 (1981).  \nAs a result of its enduring King’s Bench authority, this Court possesses \n“every judicial power that the people of the Commonwealth can bestow under the \nConstitution of the United States.” In re Bruno, 101 A.3d 635, 666 (Pa. 2014 ) \n(quoting Stander v. Kelly, 250 A.2d 474, 484 (Pa. 1969)). This Court’s precedent \nhas long “described the King’s Bench power in the broadest of terms” and, as such, \nhas recognized that the Court “would be remiss to interpret the Court’s supervisory \nauthority at King’s Bench in narrow terms, contrary to precedent and the \ntranscendent nature and purpose of the power.” In re Bruno, 101 A.3d at 679. \nThe Court’s exercise of its King’s Bench authority is appropriate here, as the \nCOVID-19 public health crisis is an unprecedented matter of public importance, \nwhich “requires timely intervention by the court of last resort to avoid the \ndeleterious effects arising from delays incident to the ordinary process of law.” \nCommonwealth v. Williams, 129 A.3d 1199, 1206 (Pa. 2015).  \nThis Court has already recognized, in its two emergency orders of March \n16th and 18th, that the COVID-19 pandemic warrants extraordinary steps to \nprotect the public. This Petition calls upon the Court to meet this unprecedented \nhealth challenge by directing each judicial district to take reasonable and necessary \nmeasures to prevent widespread contagion. Petitioners call upon the Court to take \n  20 \n\nthis necessary action to protect not just the people held within county jails, but \ncorrectional staff, their families, their respective communities and ultimately the \npublic health of all Commonwealth residents. \nTime is of the essence. Immediate intervention by this Court is necessary to \navoid “the deleterious effects arising from delays incident to the ordinary process \nof law.” Williams, 129 A.3d at 1206. The risk to the general public of delaying \nfurther review cannot be overstated. To date, individual judicial districts or jurists \nthroughout the Commonwealth have relied on a piecemeal strategy without any \nguidance from this Court. The lack of an urgent, unified, and concerted effort to \naddress the grave public health risk will result in future measures that, quite \nsimply, will be too little, too late. There will be outbreaks in county jails, an \ninevitable community spread, and, increased suffering.  \nApplication of the King’s Bench power is particularly suited to this case, \nwhich asks that this Court exercise its “general supervisory and administrative \nauthority over all the courts.” Pa. Const. art. V, § 10(a). This Court further has \npower under Section 10(a) “to prescribe general rules governing practice, \nprocedure and the conduct of all courts.” Id. “By its ‘supreme’ nature, the inherent \nadjudicatory, supervisory, and administrative authority of this Court at King’s \nBench ‘is very high and transcendent.’” In re Bruno, 101 A.3d at 669 (quoting \nCommonwealth v. Chimenti, 507 A.2d 79, 81 (Pa. 1986)). This “supervisory power \n  21 \n\nover the Unified Judicial System is beyond question.” In re Bruno, 101 A.3d at \n678. \nUnder its King’s Bench authority, this Court has the power to exercise \ngeneral jurisdiction over the Unified Judicial System even “where no matter is \npending in a lower court.” In re Avellino, 690 A.2d 1138, 1140 (Pa. 1997). When \nexercising King’s Bench authority, this Court’s “principal obligations are to \nconscientiously guard the fairness and probity of the judicial process and the \ndignity, integrity, and authority of the judicial system, all for the protection of the \ncitizens of this Commonwealth.” Williams, 129 A.3d at 1206 (quotation and \ncitation omitted). \nThe issues raised by Petitioners plainly fall within the Court’s King’s Bench \nauthority. The urgency to respond to this historic public health crisis cannot be \ngainsaid.   \nB.  Extraordinary measures in other jurisdictions demonstrate the \nneed for population reduction in the county jails.  \nIn recognition of the extraordinary public health risk posed by the \ntransmission of COVID-19 in custodial settings, courts across the country have \ntaken steps within the past week to reduce prison populations in their respective \nstates, including the following:  \n  22 \n\n  On March 22, 2020, the Supreme Court of New Jersey ordered the release of \nall prisoners serving county jail sentences.19  \n  In Montana, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court wrote to all judges in the \nstate asking each to “review your jail rosters and release, without bond, as \nmany prisoners as you are able, especially those being held for non-violent \noffenses.”20  \n  The chief justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court ordered that everyone \nheld in jail on bond in a non-capital case be released, unless there exists an \n“unreasonable danger” or “extreme flight risk.”21  \n  The Washington Supreme Court directed that all trial courts in the state \nprioritize hearings that could result in the release of a defendant in custody, \nproviding that courts “shall hear motions for pretrial release on an expedited \nbasis” and that any person fitting within the CDC’s definition of vulnerable \npopulations would be presumed to have demonstrated a “material change in \ncircumstances” justifying reconsideration of previously ordered bail \nconditions.22  \n                                           \n19 In the Matter of the Request to Commute or Suspend County Jail Sentences, No. \n082430 (N.J. March 22, 2020), https://www.njcourts.gov/notices/2020\n/n200323a.pdf?c=9cs. The order provided a mechanism for prosecutors, within 24 \nto 48 hours, to object to the release of specific prisoners who “would pose a \nsignificant risk to the safety of the inmate or the public,” with such objections to be \nconsidered by judges or special masters appointed by the Supreme Court.  \n20 Letter from Mike McGrath, Chief Justice of Montana Supreme Court, to \nMontana Courts of Limited Jurisdiction Judges (Mar. 20, 2020), https://courts.mt\n.gov/Portals/189/virus/Ltr%20to%20COLJ%20Judges%20re%20COVID-19%200\n32020.pdf?ver=2020-03-20-115517-333. \n21 Memorandum from Donald W.

Allegheny County, through a concerted effort and collaboration by the \ncourts, the public defender, and the sheriff, released nearly 550 people from the \ncounty jail.32 It did so to address “fear that the jail would become a giant Petri dish \nfor the virus.”33 In Lackawanna County, to “minimize people in and out of the \nprison,” the President Judge initiated a review of the file of “every low-level \noffender,” including prisoners assigned to work release or those close to reaching \ntheir minimum release date.34  \nThe actions of Allegheny and Lackawanna Counties are important, but they \nare limited exceptions to what has otherwise been a business-as-usual approach by \nalmost all other county courts. Most Pennsylvania counties have released very few, \nif any, people to reduce prison population levels. Without immediate statewide \nactions, these remaining counties are likely to become the “petri dishes” that \n                                           \n32 WTAE Action News, 545 inmates released from Allegheny County Jail due to \ncoronavirus concern (March 27, 2020), https://www.wtae.com/article/545-\ninmates-released-from-allegheny-county-jail-due-to-coronavirus-\nconcerns/31953103#   \n33 Andy Sheehan, Coronavirus In Pittsburgh: Amid Virus Pandemic, Allegheny \nCounty Jail Releases More Than 200 Inmates, KDKA News (Mar. 20, 2020), \nhttps://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2020/03/20/allegheny-county-jail-released-\ninmates/. \n34 Kevin Hayes, Lackawanna County reviews possible release of low level inmates \nto mitigate spread of COVID-19 (March 18, 2020), https://www.pahomepage.com\n/top-news/lackawanna-county-to-release-low-level-inmates-to-mitigate-spread-of-\ncovid-19/. \n  26 \n\nofficials in Allegheny County rightly feared will spread contagion to surrounding \ncommunities throughout the Commonwealth. \nThe actions taken by state courts and local executive officials across the \ncountry as described above provide a template for actions this Court must take to \nprotect the health and safety of the county jail population, the correctional staff in \nthose jails, and the surrounding communities.  \nC.  This court should exercise its plenary and supervisory jurisdiction \nto expeditiously reduce county jail populations. \nThis Court’s intervention is necessary to protect the people of Pennsylvania. \nAs outlined above, the path to doing so requires a reduction in county jail \npopulations to minimize spread of the virus among those in custody and their \ncustodians, and thereby minimize contagion in surrounding communities. \nUnder 42 Pa.C.S. § 726, “[t]his Court may assume, at its discretion, plenary \njurisdiction over a matter of immediate public importance . . . .” Bd. of Revision of \nTaxes v. City of Phila., 4 A.3d 610, 620 (Pa. 2010). If ever there were a case that is \nof “immediate public importance,” it is this one, which necessarily involves a \nmyriad of rights under the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nFederal Constitution, as well as Article I, Sections One, Thirteen, and Fourteen of \nthe Pennsylvania Constitution. See, e.g., Natale v. Camden Cty. Corr. Facility, 318 \nF.3d 575, 581 (3d Cir. 2003) (“the Fourteenth Amendment affords pretrial detainees \nprotections ‘at least as great as the Eighth Amendment protections available to a \n  27 \n\nconvicted prisoner’”) (quoting City of Revere v. Mass. Gen. Hosp., 463 U.S. 239, \n244 (1983)); Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993) (citing Hutto v. Finney, \n437 U.S. 678, 682 (1978)) (the government violates the Eighth Amendment when \nit crowds prisoners into cells with others who have “infectious maladies”).  \nExperts urge this Court to act now to mitigate a swelling public health \ncatastrophe. For the reasons stated above, Petitioners respectfully request that this \nCourt exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction over this matter and instruct the \nPresident Judge of each Judicial District to take measures that both expeditiously \nreduce their jail populations and limit the likelihood of near-term increase in their \npopulations. \nThe numerous actions taken by state supreme courts and local law \nenforcement authorities in other parts of the country illustrate the variety of \nmeasures available to this Court to accomplish the necessary reduction of the \nCommonwealth’s jail populations.  These recent developments show that the Court \ncan grant relief leading to the release of broad categories of prisoners who are in \ncounty jails as a result of minor charges or violations, prisoners who are nearing \ncompletion of their sentences, and prisoners who are at the greatest level of risk for \nserious complications or death from COVID-19 infections.  Release of people in \nthese categories poses little risk to public safety.  To the contrary, as shown \nthroughout this Petition, these releases and the resulting reduction in jail \n  28 \n\npopulations are critically necessary to ensure public safety in the face of an \nunprecedented risk to public health.     \nPetitioners, based on their good faith understanding of the components of \npopulations in the Commonwealth’s county jails, urge the Court to: \n1.  Instruct all courts in the Commonwealth to immediately order county \njails within their respective jurisdictions to release the following \ncategories of people, subject to the objection provision outlined in ¶ 2 \nbelow: \na.  Those who are within three months of, or beyond, their minimum \nsentence; \nb.  Those under a probation detainer (or serving a sentence) for a \nviolation of probation or county parole where the violation does \nnot arise out of the commission of a new felony offense; \nc.  Those eligible to periodically leave their correctional facilities, \nsuch as those eligible for work release or serving intermittent \nsentences (e.g., weekends);  \nd.  Those detained pretrial solely due to an order imposing cash bail; \nand \ne.  Any incarcerated person at increased risk of severe COVID-19 \ncomplications and death as defined by the CDC, including those \n  29 \n\nover the age of 45, and people with any of the following \nunderlying medical conditions: blood disorders, chronic kidney or \nliver disease, compromised immune system, endocrine disorders \n(including diabetes), metabolic disorders, heart and lung disease, \nneurological and neurologic and neurodevelopmental conditions, \nand current or recent pregnancy. \n2.  Order that, if a district attorney objects to the release of a particular \nperson within the above categories on the ground that release of that \nindividual would pose a significant risk to the safety of a specific \nperson or to the public, the district attorney shall, within twenty-four \n(24) hours of this Court’s order, lodge an objection with a judicial \nauthority appointed by the President Judge of each district.  \na.  In the event of a district-attorney initiated objection, the appointed \njudicial authority shall provide counsel for the detained person, \nwho will have an opportunity to respond to the objection prior to \nthe judicial authority ruling on the objection. \nb.  The judicial authority shall not force the release of any detained \nperson who opposes release for reasons of personal or family \nsafety. \n  30 \n\n3.  Order that all courts in the Commonwealth, after releasing individuals \nidentified above, take the following measures to maintain the \nreduction in the jail populations: \na.  Cease setting cash bail for any newly arrested indigent defendant, \nand order them released on reasonable and appropriate non-\nmonetary conditions; \nb.  Implement a process to review and lift all probation and parole \ndetainers; \nc.  Prioritize arraignments and preliminary hearings for any in-\ncustody defendant; \nd.  Ensure the availability of a venue to conduct guilty pleas and \nsentencing hearings for any defendant where the parties anticipate \nthat the proceeding will result in release of the defendant from \ndetention within 30 days; and \ne.  Ensure the availability of a venue for prosecutors to file motions to \nnolle pros or otherwise dismiss charges.  \n4.  Appoint a special master to administer and monitor compliance with this \norder; and direct the President Judge of each Commonwealth judicial \ndistrict, or such official(s) designated by each President Judge, to provide \n  31 \n\ncompliance reports to the special master and petitioners’ counsel in this case, \nin a manner, and at a time interval, directed by this Court. \nVI.  CONCLUSION \n  The country, and this Commonwealth, face a public health crisis of epic \nproportions.  COVID-19 presents risks to all of us, and has forced us as a country \nto come together and do what is right for the community and the public health.  We \nmust allow and encourage everyone to engage in practices that flatten the curve—\nsocial distancing and vigorous hygiene. This protects the most vulnerable among \nus and, hopefully, gives our overtaxed healthcare systems the chance to treat those \nmost gravely affected by COVID-19.  Absent decisive action, our overcrowded \njails will become petri dishes that overwhelm both correctional and healthcare \nsystems.  The only humanitarian and constitutional solution is to immediately \norder the release of as many people as possible from our county jails.  We urge this \nCourt, in the strongest terms, to join the growing chorus of courts who have \ndecided to act in an effort to save lives.  The time to act is now. \n   \n  32 \n\n \nDated:  March 30, 2020      Respectfully submitted, \n \n              /s/ Witold Walczak    \nJohn A.

Amon, Ph.D. MSPH \n \nI, Joseph J. Amon, declare as follows: \n \nBackground and Expertise \n1.  I am an infectious disease epidemiologist, Director of Global Health and Clinical \nProfessor in the department of Community Health and Prevention at the Drexel Dornsife \nSchool of Public Health. I also hold an appointment as an Associate in the department of \nepidemiology of the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. My \nPh.D. is from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, \nMaryland and my Master’s of Science in Public Health (MSPH) degree in Tropical \nMedicine is from the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine. \n2.  Prior to my current position, I have worked for a range of non-governmental \norganizations and as an epidemiologist in the Epidemic Intelligence Service of the US \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. Between 2010 and 2018, I was a Visiting \nLecturer at Princeton University, teaching courses on epidemiology and global health. I \ncurrently serve on advisory boards for UNAIDS and the Global Fund against HIV, TB \nand Malaria and have previously served on advisory committees for the World Health \nOrganization. \n3.  I have published 60 peer-reviewed journal articles and more than 100 book chapters, \nletters, commentaries and opinion articles on issues related to public health and health \npolicy. \n4.  One of my main areas of research focus relates to infectious disease control, clinical care, \nand obligations of government related to individuals in detention settings, in which I have \npublished a number of reports assessing health issues in prison and detention settings and \nmore than a dozen peer-reviewed articles. In 2015-2016, I was a co-editor of a special \nissue of the British journal, “The Lancet,” on HIV, TB and hepatitis in prisons. I also serve \non the editorial boards of two public health journals. My resume is attached as Exhibit A. \nInformation on COVID-19 and Vulnerable Populations \n5.  COVID-19 is a coronavirus disease that has reached pandemic status. As of today \n(3/29), according to the World Health Organization more than 638,146 cases have been \ndiagnosed in 203 countries or territories around the world and more than 30,105 \nconfirmed deaths.1 In the United States, which has the highest number of reported cases \nin the world, more than 135,499 people have been diagnosed with the disease and \n2,381people have died thus far,2 though these numbers likely underreport the actual \ninfections and deaths.3 In Pennsylvania, as of 4:30 pm on March 29, 2020, there were \n3,394 confirmed cases and 38 deaths.4 There has been an exponential increase in cases \n \n1 See https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 accessed March 29, 2020. \n2 See https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html accessed March 29, 2010 \n3 See https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/us-deaths-from-coronavirus-top-1000-amid-incomplete-\nreporting-from-authorities-and-anguish-from-those-left-behind/2020/03/26/2c487ba2-6ad0-11ea-9923-\n57073adce27c_story.html accessed March 26, 2020.  \n4 See https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/Documents/Diseases%20and%20Conditions/COVID-\n19%20Situation%20Reports/20200325nCoVSituationReportExt.pdf; accessed March 26, 2019 see also: \n\nand deaths in Pennsylvania over the past two weeks: \n \nCases  Deaths \nDate  (cumulative)  (cumulative) \n12‐Mar  28  0 \n13‐Mar  41  0 \n14‐Mar  58  0 \n15‐Mar  63  0 \n16‐Mar  76  0 \n17‐Mar  96  0 \n18‐Mar  133  1 \n19‐Mar  185  1 \n20‐Mar  268  1 \n21‐Mar  371  2 \n22‐Mar  479  3 \n23‐Mar  644  6 \n24‐Mar  851  7 \n25‐Mar  1127  11 \n26‐Mar  1687  16 \n27‐Mar  2218  22 \n28‐Mar  2751  34 \n29‐Mar  3394  38 \n \n6.  COVID-19 is a serious disease, ranging from no symptoms or mild ones for people at \nlow risk, to respiratory failure and death. There is no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. \nThere is no known cure or anti-viral treatment for COVID-19 at this time. The specific \nmechanism of mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients is uncertain but may be \nrelated to virus-induced acute lung injury, inflammatory response, multiple organ \ndamage and secondary nosocomial infections. \n7.  The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies individuals at highest risk to include \nthose over 60 years of age and those with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic \nrespiratory disease, and cancer.5 The WHO further states that the risk of severe disease \nincreases with age starting from around 40 years. \n8.  The US CDC identifies “older adults [65 and older] and people of any age who have \nserious underlying medical conditions” as at higher risk of severe disease and death.6 \nThe CDC identifies underlying medical conditions to include: blood disorders, chronic \nkidney or liver disease, compromised immune system, endocrine disorders, including \ndiabetes, metabolic disorders, heart and lung disease (“including asthma or chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease [chronic bronchitis or emphysema] or other chronic \nconditions associated with impaired lung function”), neurological and neurologic and \n \nhttps://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Cases.aspx   accessed March 29, 2019 \n5 See https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200311-sitrep-51-covid- \n19. pdf?sfvrsn=1ba62e57_4 accessed March 21, 2020 \n6 See https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html accessed March 21, \n2020 \n\nneurodevelopmental conditions, and current or recent pregnancy.7\n \n9.  Data from US COVID-19 cases published by the CDC on March 19, 2020, found that \nhospitalization rates and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates were nearly identical \nfor individuals aged 45-54 and individuals aged 55-64 (between approximately 20-30% \nfor both groups for hospitalization and between 5-11% for both groups for ICU \nadmission).8 This suggests that individuals >45 years could be considered high risk for \nsevere disease while those ≥54 years could be considered high risk for severe disease and \ndeath. \n \nHealth profile of plaintiffs  \n \n11. I have reviewed the declaration of Brian McHale and Fredrick Leonard.  \n12. Mr. McHale is 44 years old and detained in the Montgomery County Correctional \nFacility. He has a number of medical conditions including hemochromatosis and chronic \nhepatitis C. He reports a 30 year history of smoking. Due to the likely impact of these \nconditions on his lungs, liver and heart, he should be considered at high risk for severe \nillness and death from COVID-19. Mr. Leonard is 29 years old and detained at Pike \nCounty Correctional Facility. He has a 17 year history of smoking. His declaration states \nthat he has a history of chronic bronchitis, which is a type of chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease that is most frequently caused by smoking. Due to this history, he \nshould be considered at high risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19. \n \nUnderstanding of COVID-19 Transmission \n13. According to the U.S. CDC, the disease is transmitted mainly between people who are in \nclose contact with one another (within about 6 feet) via respiratory droplets produced \nwhen an infected person coughs or sneezes.9 It may be possible that a person can get \nCOVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their \nown mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the \nvirus spreads.10 People are thought to be most contagious when they are most \nsymptomatic (the sickest), however some amount of asymptomatic transmission is \nlikely.11 This suggests that, while hand washing and disinfecting surfaces is \nadvisable, the main strategy for limiting disease transmission is social distancing \nand that for such distancing to be effective it must occur before individuals display \nsymptoms. \n14. Recognizing the importance of social distancing, public health officials have \nrecommended extraordinary measures to combat the spread of COVID-19.

Emerg Microbes \nInfect. 2020;9(1):386-389. \n\ncourts, collegiate and professional sports, theater and other congregate settings have been \nclosed as part of risk mitigation strategy. 50 states, 7 territories, and the District of \nColumbia have taken some type of formal executive action in response to the COVID- \n19 outbreak.12 Through one form or another, these jurisdictions have declared, \nproclaimed, or ordered a state of emergency, public health emergency, or other \npreparedness and response activity for the outbreak. Earlier this month Pennsylvania \nGovernor, Tom Wolf, declared a state of emergency, which he buttressed on March 19 \nwith an order closing non-essential businesses.13 On Monday, March 23, 2020, Governor \nWolf issued a stay at home order for residents of Allegheny, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, \nMonroe and Montgomery counties. On Tuesday, March 24, Governor Wolf extended the \nstay at home order to Erie;14 the next day, March 25, Governor Wolf further extended the \norder to Lehigh and Northampton.15 On Friday, March 27, 2020, Governor Wolf extended \nthe order to include nine additional counties: Berks, Butler, Lackawanna, Lancaster, \nLuzerne, Pike, Wayne, Westmoreland, and York.16 Philadelphia has been under a stay at \nhome order since Saturday, March 21, 2020.17 In total, nineteen counties are under stay \nat home orders in Pennsylvania.  \n15. As of March 28, in response to the threat of COVID-19 transmission, fifteen states \nprohibit gatherings of any size (California; Colorado; Idaho Illinois; Indiana; Montana; \nMichigan; New Jersey; New Mexico; New York; Ohio; Oregon; Washington; West \nVirginia; and Wisconsin); one state prohibits gatherings > 5 individuals (Connecticut); \ntwenty-one states and the District of Columbia prohibit gatherings of >10 individuals \n(Alaska; Hawaii; Iowa; Kansas; Louisiana; Maine; Maryland; Massachusetts; \nMississippi; Missouri; Nevada; New Hampshire; North Carolina; Oklahoma; Rhode \nIsland; South Dakota; Tennessee; Texas; Vermont; Virginia;  and Wyoming); one state \nprohibits gatherings of >25 individuals (Alabama) and two states prohibit gatherings of \n>50 individuals (Delaware; South Carolina). Many states, including California, Illinois, \nNew Jersey, and New York have also issued quarantine orders directing residents to stay \nat home except under certain narrow exceptions.18 These orders are expanding, \nincreasing. Whereas at least 158 million people in 16 states, nine counties and three cities \nwere being urged to stay home on March 23, the numbers increased on March 24, 2020 \nto at least 163 million people in 17 states, 14 counties and eight cities. As of March 27, at \nleast 228 million people in 25 states, 74 counties and 14 cities and one territory are being \nurged to stay home.19 \n16. These public health measures aim to “flatten the curve” of the rates of infection so that \nthose most vulnerable to serious complications from infection will be least likely to be \n \n12 See https://www.astho.org/COVID-19/ accessed March 21, 2020 \n13 See https://www.governor.pa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/20200319-TWW-COVID-19-business-closure- \norder.pdf \n14 https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/governor-wolf-and-health-secretary-expand-stay-at-home-order-to-erie-\ncounty-to-mitigate-spread-of-covid-19/ Accessed March, 26, 2020. \n15 https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/governor-wolf-and-health-secretary-expand-stay-at-home-order-to-lehigh-\nand-northampton-counties-to-mitigate-spread-of-covid-19-counties-now-total-10/ Accessed March 26, 2020.  \n16 https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/governor-wolf-and-health-secretary-expand-stay-at-home-order-to-nine-\nmore-counties-to-mitigate-spread-of-covid-19-counties-now-total-19/ accessed March 28, 2020. \n17 See https://www.wtae.com/article/stay-at-home-order-to-begin-tonight-for-several-pa-counties-including- \nallegheny/31900786 accessed March 23, 2020. \n18 See https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/state-data-and-policy-actions-to-address- \ncoronavirus/#socialdistancing accessed March 28, 2020. \n19 See https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-stay-at-home-order.html accessed March 28, 2020. \n\nexposed and, if they are the numbers of infected individuals will be low enough that \nmedical facilities will have enough beds, masks, and ventilators for those who need \nthem.  \n17. In countries where the virus’s course of infection began earlier, and where death rates \ngrew steadily, governments have imposed national emergency measures to prevent \ncontagion from human contact. In Italy and Spain, for example, the governments have \nimposed national lockdowns to keep people from coming into contact with each other.20 \n \n18. US cities are starting to see the level of COVID-19 cases seen in previous global \nhotspots. On Thursday, March 26, Governor Cuomo announced that 100 people had \ndied of the coronavirus between Wednesday and Thursday morning. 21 As of Friday, \nMarch 27, the cumulative death toll in the state stood at 450.22 In response, the city’s \nhealth commissioner again urged all New Yorkers to follow the stay at home order, \nemphasizing the impact on the city’s already strained health system.23 Pennsylvania is \nroughly 10 days behind New York City, following a similar trendline of cases and \ndeaths.24  \n \n Risk of COVID-19 in Jails  \n19. The conditions in jails pose a heightened public health risk to the spread of COVID-19, \neven greater than other non-carceral institutions. Spread of COVID-19 within the jails \nwill affect not only those who are being held there, but also the correctional officers who \nwork there and the communities they go back to.  \n20. County jails are enclosed environments, much like the cruise ships that were the site of \nthe largest concentrated outbreaks of COVID-19. Detention facilities have even greater \nrisk of infectious spread because of conditions of crowding, the proportion of vulnerable \npeople detained, and often scant medical care. People live in close quarters and are also \nsubject to security measures which prohibit successful “social distancing” that is needed \nto effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19. Toilets, sinks, and showers are shared, \nwithout disinfection between use. Food preparation and food service is communal, with \nlittle opportunity for surface disinfection. The crowded conditions, in both sleeping areas \nand social areas, and the shared objects (bathrooms, sinks, etc.) will facilitate \ntransmission. \n21. CDC guidance on correctional and detention facilities,25 posted March 23, 2020, \n \n20 See https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/14/spain-declares-state-of-emergency-due-to-coronavirus.html accessed  March \n23, 2020 \n21 See https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/world/coronavirus-\nnews.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-\ncoronavirus&variant=show&region=TOP_BANNER&context=storyline_menu?action=click&pgtype=Article&state\n=default&module=styln-coronavirus&variant=show&region=TOP_BANNER&context=storyline_menu#link-\n18cce12f accessed March 26, 2020. \n22 https://nypost.com/2020/03/27/another-84-people-killed-by-coronavirus-in-new-york-city/ accessed March 28, 2020.  \n23 See https://nypost.com/2020/03/25/de-blasio-warns-half-of-all-new-yorkers-will-get-covid-19/ accessed March 26, \n2020.  \n24 See https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-city-coronavirus-cases-over-time-chart-2020-3 accessed March 26, \n2020.  \n25 See: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional- \ndetention.html accessed March 23, 2020 \n \n\nspecifically recommends implementing social distancing strategies to increase the \nphysical space between incarcerated/detained persons “ideally 6 feet between all \nindividuals, regardless of the presence of symptoms” including: 1) increased space \nbetween individuals in holding cells, as well as in lines and waiting areas such as intake; \nstagger time in recreation spaces; restrict recreation space usage to a single housing unit \nper space; stagger meals; rearrange seating in the dining hall so that there is more space \nbetween individuals (e.g., remove every other chair and use only one side of the table); \nprovide meals inside housing units or cells; limit the size of group activities; reassign \nbunks to provide more space between individuals, ideally 6 feet or more in all directions. \n22. The CDC guidance also describes necessary disinfection procedures including to \nthoroughly clean and disinfect all areas where a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case \nspent time.26 \n23. In addition to declaration of Mr. McHale and Mr. Leonard, as identified in paragraph 11, \nI have also reviewed the declarations of the following individuals: Jeremy Hunsicker, \nChristopher Aubry, Michael Foundos, Ernest Fuller, a volunteer with the Pennsylvania \nPrison Society, Malik Neal, a volunteer with the Pennsylvania Prison Society, and Bret \nGrote, Co-Founder and Legal Director of the Abolitionist Law Center. \n24. Conditions as described in the declarations reinforce the high risk of COVID-19 \ntransmission. For example, in Montgomery County Correctional Facility, Mr. McHale \nreports sharing a cell, including a toilet and sink, with two other individuals and having \nclose contact with 13 other men in his unit. In Lehigh County Community Corrections, \nMr. Hunsicker reports being housed in a “pod” with 20 other people, sharing a bathroom \nand exposure to individuals working in the community and lack of hand sanitizer \navailable. He also reports eating meals with up to 70 people at one time and being in \nclose contact with other detainees during regular medical checks. Also detained in \nMontgomery County Correctional Facility, Mr. Aubry reports working in the community \nand sharing a “pod” with approximately 50 other people, sleeping in bunk beds, and \nsharing a bathroom. He reports no available hand sanitizer. In Delaware County’s George \nW. Hill Correctional Facility, Mr. Foundos reports close contact with his cell mate and \nduring meals. In Pike County Correctional Facility, Mr. Leonard reports being confined \nthree to an eight by twelve foot cell with a single shared toilet and sink in the cell. He \nreports having insufficient soap to last a full day. He also reports eating six to a table with \nlittle space between each individual. \n25. Based upon Mr. Fuller’s declaration regarding Blair County Prison, between 2 and 20 \ndetainees may be housed together in rooms, with the largest being roughly 20 x 30 feet \nand with bunk beds or beds placed 3 to 4 feet apart. Soap is limited and physicians are \nrarely present. Based upon Mr. Grote’s declaration, the infrastructure and routine practice \nof Allegheny County Jail raise significant challenges to maintaining distancing between \ndetainees in the facilities.  These physical infrastructure and security challenges, which \nare typical of most detention centers, include:  \na)  Individuals are held for extended periods of time in the intake area, typically with \n10 or more people sharing a single toilet and sink. Only cursory medical screening \nis conducted.  \n \n26 Ibid \n\nb)  A significant number of people housed at ACJ are double-celled.  \nc)  Access to soap is a constant problem in ACJ as is, in some pods, access to \npersonal hygiene and cleaning supplies. \nd)  There are only a few showers per pod, with many people sharing the same shower \narea, without any sanitation between individual uses. \ne)  Dining tables are small and fit four people, with one person on each side. A table \nis only four feet by four feet, at most, so no one can social distance from others \nduring meal times. \nf)  As is true in detention facilities generally, communal bathroom facilities pose a \nrisk of transmission and it is not usually possible for an incarcerated person to \nmove throughout ACJ without coming into contact with many other people. The \nuse of elevators also poses a problem bringing individuals in close contact. If \nsomeone is housed in a special unit or restrictive housing, they must also be \nclosely escorted everywhere in the facility and security incidents can put an \nincarcerated person into close contact with staff members.  \ng)  Access to medical care is inadequate at ACJ. There are extreme delays in \nindividuals’ ability to access care, as well as huge staffing shortages. \nBased on Mr. Neal’s declarations regarding conditions at Curran-Fromhold Correctional \nFacility (“CFCF”), Riverside Correctional Facility (“RCF”), and the Detention Center \n(“DC”), the Philadelphia facilities share the following characteristics that heighten the risk of \ntransmission: \nh)  The majority of cells contain two people who sleep on bunk beds and share a single \ntoilet and sink that is in close proximity to the bed.  \ni)  Showers are shared between many individuals without being sanitized between use. \nOther shared surfaces, like phones, are also not sanitized between use.  \nj)  Individuals in custody are responsible for custodial tasks, and people do not have \naccess to sanitization products to clean their cells.  \nk)  In DC, people are brought to meals in large groups in a cafeteria. At the other \nfacilities, Mr. Neale observed common areas on each block with tables that are not \neven six feet across.  \nl)  Intake at CFCF takes place in a single holding cell that holds upwards of ten people \nfor the eight to twelve hours it takes to process a new intake.  \nm) Access to medical care is inadequate at all facilities: individuals housed at these \nfacilities reported that the facilities did not respond to the “sick slips” they \nsubmitted even before there was a possibility of COVID-19 infection.   \n26. Based upon the information provided to me, and my prior knowledge of detention \nfacilities, I am concerned that Pennsylvania jail facilities do not have the ability to \nimplement the critically important principle of social distancing, such as maintain six feet \nof separation at all times including meals and location of beds, nor are they apparently \ntaking extraordinary measures to identify and properly isolate individuals at high risk, \nthose with potential exposure (e.g., from work detail) or those with symptoms consistent \nwith COVID-19. These steps are essential to preventing transmission of COVID-19. \nWhere jails are housing detained individuals in small cells where they are bunked \n\ntogether and where they are crowded together to eat meals, they will not be able to \nprevent COVID-19 transmission once introduced into the jail. Upon review of the \ndeclarations, jails also do not appear to have sufficient supplies available for detainees for \nhandwashing or disinfecting. Further, through work programs and staff, detainees at each \nof these facilities are at risk of being exposed to COVID-19. \n27. Introduction of new people into detention facilities who have had contact with the \ncommunity outside the facility—be it correctional officers and other staff, new individuals \ncoming into custody, people on work release, or individuals serving intermediate \nsentences—creates a link from transmission occurring in the community to those who are \ndetained. The possibility of asymptomatic transmission means that monitoring fever of \nstaff or detainees is inadequate for identifying all who may be infected and preventing \ntransmission. This is also true because not all individuals infected with COVID-19 report \nfever in early stages of infection.  \n28. The alternative is to test all staff and detainees entering the facility. However, this would \nrequire frequent (daily) tests, implemented at multiple times a day as staff and detainees \nentered the facility. In addition to the cost and labor required to implement this approach, \nthe United States is currently facing a shortage of COVID-19 tests that make such a \nsolution impracticable: In a survey of U.S. cities (that included Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, \nErie, and Easton), 92.1% of cities reported that they do not have an adequate supply of \ntest kits.27 Shortages are likely to become more severe over the next three to four weeks \nwhen there will be a major shortage of chemical reagents for COVID-19 testing and \nenormous increases in demand.28  Given the shortage of COVID-19 testing in the United \nStates, it is likely that jails are and will continue to be unable to conduct aggressive, \nwidespread testing to identify all positive cases of COVID-19. The lack of widespread \ntesting in communities and the current presence of COVID-19 in all 50 states means that \nit is impractical to ask detainees about their travel history– all communities should be \nassumed to have community transmission which is why statewide and national restrictions \non movement and gatherings have been put in place.  \n \nHeightened Rates of COVID-19 Infection and Spread Within Detention Facilities \n29. As COVID-19 has spread in the United States, it has begun to enter detention facilities \nand spread among individuals who are held and who work there. As of March 28, in \nCalifornia, at least twelve state prison workers29 and one individual incarcerated in state \nprison30 had tested positive. At least three people in custody tested positive in the Orange \nCounty Jail31 and one at the Santa Clara County Jail.32 In Santa Clara, at least four county \ndeputies had also contracted the virus.33 A nurse at the Santa Rita jail tests positive for the \n \n27 https://www.usmayors.org/issues/covid-19/equipment-survey/ accessed March 28, 2020. \n28 https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/opinion/coronavirus-trump-testing-shortages.html accessed March 28, 2020. \n29 https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/the-state-worker/article241531806.html accessed March 28, 2020 \n30 https://ktla.com/news/local-news/inmate-at-state-prison-in-lancaster-tests-positive-for-covid-19/ accessed March 26, \n2020.  \n31 https://www.ocregister.com/2020/03/26/2-more-inmates-test-positive-for-coronavirus-at-oc-jail/ accessed March 28, \n2020. \n32 https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/23/santa-clara-county-jail-inmate-tests-positive-for-covid-19/ accessed \nMarch 26, 2020.  \n33 https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/24/coronasvirus-fourth-santa-clara-county-deputy-contracts-covid-19/ \naccessed March 28, 2020. \n\nvirus. It’s the first confirmed case at the massive Alameda County complex.34 In the Cook \nCounty Jail in Chicago, 89 inmates and 12 staff members have confirmed cases of the \nvirus35, up from 38 inmates two days prior.36 There have been eighteen positive tests in \nMassachusetts, 11 inmates and 7 employees. The Massachusetts Treatment Center in \nBridgewater has returned the most positives with ten inmates and two corrections officers \nand one medical provider testing positive.37 The other positives have been one person \nheld at Middlesex County Jail, one employee at the Plymouth County House of \nCorrection, two staff members at MCI-Shirley, and a worker at the Norfolk County \nSheriff’s Office.38 New Jersey has had twelve positive tests cases: A corrections officer39 \nand an ICE detainee40 at the Bergen County Jail, two inmates at Hudson County \nCorrectional Facility,41 one inmate in the Morris County Jail42 and one officer in Morris \nCounty,43 two correctional officers and an ICE detainee at Essex County Correctional \nFacility,44 an inmate at Delaney Hall in Newark,45 a medical staffer at Elizabeth \nDetention Center,46 and an employee at the state department of corrections.47 On March \n29th a 49 year old prisoner who had been detained in a minimum security prison in \nOakdale, Louisiana died after being transferred to a hospital and placed on a ventilator.48  \n30.

The rates of spread in the facilities that have been testing for COVID-19 illustrates the \ndangers the conditions in these facilities pose to those who are detained there, and to the \nbroader community. At Rikers Island in New York, on Saturday March 21, a jail \noversight agency indicated that 21 inmates and 17 employees tested positive.52 Four days \nlater, on Wednesday, March 26, 75 inmates and 37 employees tested positive.53 As of \nSaturday, March 28, 104 staff and 132 individuals in custody had tested positive at Rikers \nand city jails in New York City.54 The Legal Aid Society in New York recently \nreported that the infection rate for COVID-19 at local jails is more than seven times \nhigher than the rate citywide and 87 times higher than the country at large.55  \n32. The data above also confirms high rates of infection among correctional officers and other \nstaff. These individuals all face an increased risk of COVID-19 exposure as they are less \nable to practice the recommended strategy of social distancing in carrying out their \nofficial duties. This is consistent with Mr. Leonard’s reports that one of the correctional \nofficers at Pike County Correctional Facility tested positive.  \nInfrastructure in County Jails Will Likely Be Insufficient to Address Needs of COVID-19 \nPatients  \n33. If COVID-19 enters into county jails, these facilities will likely be unable to address the \ninfectious spread and the needs of infected individuals due to lack of testing and \ninsufficient physical and medical infrastructure.   \n34. In cases where there are confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 in county jails, the \nCDC recommends medical isolation, defined by the CDC confining the case “ideally to a \nsingle cell with solid walls and a solid door that closes” to prevent contact with others and \nto reduce the risk of transmission. Individuals in isolation should also be provided their \nown bathroom space.56  \n35. Individuals in close contact of a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case - defined by the \nCDC as having been within approximately 6 feet of the individual for a prolonged period \nof time or having had direct contact with secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., have been \ncoughed on) – should be quarantined for a period of 14 days. The same precautions \nshould be taken for housing someone in quarantine as for someone who is a confirmed or \nsuspected COVID-19 case put in isolation.57  \n36. The CDC guidance recognizes that housing detainees in isolation and quarantine \nindividually, while “preferred”, may not be feasible in all county jail settings and \ndiscusses the practice of “cohorting” when individual space is limited. The term \n“cohorting” refers to the practice of isolating multiple laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 \ncases together as a group or quarantining close contacts of a particular case together as a \n \n51 https://www.cor.pa.gov/Pages/COVID-19-Dashboard.aspx accessed March 29, 2020.  \n52 https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/21-inmates-17-employees-test-positive-for-covid-19-on-rikers-\nisland-officials/2338242/ accessed March 23, 2020.  \n53 https://nypost.com/2020/03/25/new-coronavirus-cases-in-nyc-jails-outpacing-rest-of-the-city/ accessed March  \n26, 2020 \n54 https://apnews.com/4e1e4ffaeb6bf9a9fabcc566fe5b110d accessed March 29, 2020.  \n55 See: https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2020/03/26/coronavirus-rikers-island/ accessed March 26, 2020 \n56 Ibid. \n57 Ibid \n\ngroup. The guidance states specifically that \"Cohorting should only be practiced if there \nare no other available options” and exhorts correctional officials: “Do not cohort \nconfirmed cases with suspected cases or case contacts.” [emphasis in original]. \nIndividuals who are close contacts of different cases should also not be kept together. \n37. The CDC guidance also says that correctional facilities should “Ensure that cohorted \ncases wear face masks at all times.”58 This is critical because not all close contacts may \nbe infected and those not infected must be protected from those who are if individuals are \ncohorted. However, it’s important to note that face masks are in short supply. In a joint \nletter to President Trump, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital \nAssociation, and the American Nurses Association called on the administration to \n“immediately use the Defense Production Act to increase the domestic production of \nmedical supplies and equipment that hospitals, health, health systems, physicians, nurses \nand all front line providers so desperately need.”59 In a survey United States cities, 91.5% \nof the cities reported that they do not have an adequate supply of face masks for their first \nresponders and medical personnel.60 There are also widespread shortages of personal \nprotective equipment — particularly N-95 masks — sufficient to provide even for health \ncare workers, in our nation’s hospitals, let alone medical providers and other individuals \ncoming into contact with the virus in county jails .61 Many public health leaders are \ncalling for masks to be reserved for health care staff, who face increased risk and are \nvitally needed to sustain emergency care. Hospitals in the New York City area, unable to \naccess masks locally, are reportedly turning to a private distributor to airlift millions of \nprotective masks out of China.62 Face masks are effective only when used in combination \nwith frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. Detainees \nshould be instructed in how to properly put on and take off masks, including cleaning \ntheir hands every time they touch the mask, covering the mouth and nose with the mask \nand making sure there are no gaps, avoiding touching the mask while using it; and \nreplacing the mask with a new one if it becomes damp (e.g., from sneezing) and not to re-\nuse single-use masks. There are times when detainees will necessarily not be able to wear \nmasks, if available. For example, during meals. In these instances, detainees should eat \nindividually or with proper distancing from others. \n38. Where individual rooms are not available, the CDC guidance describes a hierarchy of \nnext best options for cohorting, which in order from lesser risk to greater risk includes \nhousing individuals under medical isolation: 1) in a large, well-ventilated cell with solid \nwalls and a solid door that closes fully; 2) in a large, well-ventilated cell with solid walls \nbut without a solid door; 3) in single cells without solid walls or solid doors (i.e., cells \nenclosed entirely with bars), preferably with an empty cell between occupied cells; 4) in \nmulti-person cells without solid walls or solid doors (i.e., cells enclosed entirely with \nbars), preferably with an empty cell between occupied cells.63  \n \n58 Ibid \n59 See: https://www.aha.org/lettercomment/2020-03-21-aha-ama-and-ana-letter-president-use-dpa-medical-supplies-\nand-equipment   accessed March 26, 2020 \n60 https://www.usmayors.org/issues/covid-19/equipment-survey/ accessed March 28, 2020.  \n61 https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/opinion/coronavirus-trump-testing-shortages.html accessed March \n28, 2020. \n62 See: https://lancasteronline.com/news/health/hospital-suppliers-take-to-the-skies-to-combat-dire-\nshortages/article_0830ffb0-6f89-11ea-89ed-bbd859186614.html    accessed March 26, 2020 \n63 Ibid \n\n39. When a single COVID-19 case is identified in a county jail, close contact and the \ninability of jails to implement social distancing policies due to overcrowding and the \nphysical limitations of the facility, as described above, means that there will be many \nindividuals who are exposed and will need to be quarantined.  \n40. County jails were not built for the needs of this kind of pandemic and if COVID is \nintroduced there will likely be many more individuals identified as “close contacts” who \nneed to be quarantined than there are safe spaces to isolate them.  Some individuals \nidentified as “close contacts” will likely be infected while others will not. “Cohorting” of \nall contacts together without strict attention to masking and proper hygiene and sanitation \ndistancing could mean disease transmission will be facilitated rather than prevented. For \nexample, according to Mr. Neal’s declaration, the quarantine spaces at CFCF do not \nallow six feet of distance between the people housed together, potentially facilitating \ntransmission among individuals in quarantine.  \n41. Individuals in jails are also more likely to have chronic health problems that put them at a \nhigher risk of complications from COVID-19 infections.64  \n42. Many county jails lack adequate medical care infrastructure to address the treatment of \nhigh-risk people in detention. As examples, detention facilities often use practical nurses \nwho practice beyond the scope of their licenses; have part-time physicians who have \nlimited availability to be on-site; and facilities with no formal linkages with local health \ndepartments or hospitals. Delaware County, where the George W. Hill Correctional \nfacility is located, for example, does not have a local health department.  A COVID-19 \noutbreak would put severe strain on this already strained system. \n43. If corrections officers and medical personnel are significantly affected by COVID-19, \nlarge numbers will also be unavailable to work due to self-quarantine or isolation, at the \nsame time that large numbers of detainees who are potentially exposed will need to be put \ninto individual isolation or transferred to advanced medical care, putting tremendous \nstress on detention facilities. \n44. Large numbers of ill detainees and corrections staff will also strain the limited medical \ninfrastructure in the rural counties in which these detention facilities are located. If \ninfection spreads throughout the detention center, overwhelming the center’s own limited \nresources, the burden of caring for these individuals will shift to local medical facilities. \nThe few facilities will likely not be able to provide care to all infected individuals with \nserious cases. Statewide, Pennsylvania is facing a shortage the technology it needs to care \nfor infected individuals. The state has only 2,000, ventilators, according to the state Health \nDepartment, but the state could need three times as many at the apex of the virus’ spread, \naccording to a study from the Harvard Global Health Institute.65 If the virus spreads through \ncounty jails, it is likely that many individuals will need to be transferred (while in isolation) \nto community hospitals, and this system will be even more taxed. The inability for \noverwhelmed community hospitals to provide necessary care will increase the likelihood \nthat individuals with COVID-19 will not be able to get proper care and die.66\n \n \n64 https://www.prisonpolicy.org/health.html accessed March 26, 2020.  \n65 https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/ventilator-coronavirus-hospital-covid-pennsylvania-new-jersey-health-\n20200324.html accessed March 28, 2020.  \n66 See https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/20/Rural-counties-in-Pennsylvania-struggle-on-their-  own-\nas-COVID-19-spreads/stories/202003180034 accessed March 23, 2002. Even in regions with highly developed \n\n \n \nConclusions \n45. CDC guidance on correctional and detention facilities,67 reiterates many of the points \npreviously made in this declaration, including: 1) Incarcerated/detained persons are at \n“heightened” risk for COVID-19  infection once the virus is introduced; 2) There are \nmany opportunities for COVID-19 to be introduced into a correctional or detention \nfacility, including from staff and transfer of incarcerated/detained persons; 3) Options for \nmedical isolation of COVID-19 cases are limited; 4) Incarcerated/detained persons and \nstaff may have medical conditions that increase their risk of severe disease from COVID-\n19; 5) The ability of incarcerated/detained persons to exercise disease prevention \nmeasures (e.g., frequent handwashing) may be limited and many facilities restrict access \nto soap and paper towels and prohibit alcohol-based hand sanitizer and many \ndisinfectants; and 6) Incarcerated persons may hesitate to report symptoms of COVID-19 \nor seek medical care due to co-pay requirements and fear of isolation. \n46. Under these circumstances, the only viable public health strategy available is risk \nmitigation. Even with the best-laid plans to address the spread of COVID-19 in detention \nfacilities, measures will be insufficient when crowding makes social distancing measures \nimpossible. Facilities cannot follow CDC guidelines where people are double and triple-\ncelled, housed in large rooms where people are forced into close contact, and where people \nare sharing common facilities like bathrooms that cannot be properly sanitized given the \nsheer numbers of people using them in a day. Where quarantine is necessary, it will not be \npossible to isolate individuals from each other where there are so many people in a \nconfined space.  \n47. To effectively mitigate risk of infection and subsequent spread, the population will need \nto be reduced. Reducing the overall number of individuals in detention facilities will \nfacilitate social distancing for remaining detainees, and allow individuals who are \ninfected, and their close contacts, to be properly isolated or quarantined in individual \nrooms, according to the CDC’s preferred practices, and properly monitored for health \ncomplications that may require transfer to a local hospital. It will also lessen the risk to \ncorrections officers, who if short staffed, will have difficulty maintaining order and \nproper personal protective measures. Protecting corrections staff in turn protects the \ncommunities they come from.  \n48. The release of individuals who can be considered at high-risk of severe disease if infected \nwith COVID-19 is also a key part of a risk mitigation strategy. In my opinion, the public \nhealth recommendation is to release high-risk people from detention, given the \nheightened risks to their health and safety, especially given the lack of a viable vaccine \nfor prevention or effective treatment at this stage. \n49. To the extent that vulnerable detainees have had exposure to known cases with \n \nhealth systems, COVID-19 is straining ability to care, creating cause for alarm for less-equipped health care systems \nin regions that do not act to mitigate risk of infection.

CONSt.  art  V,  §  10(a),  this  Court \nDIRECTS  the  President  Judges  of  each  judicial  district,  or  their  judicial  designees,  to  engage  with  other  county \nstakeholders  to  review  immediately  the  current  capabilities  of  the  county  correctional  institutions  in  their  district  to \naddress the spread of COVID-19.  \n     The Court further explains and DIRECTS as follows:\n     The potential outbreak of COVID-19 in the county correctional institutions of this Commonwealth poses an undeniable \nthreat  to  the  health  of  the  inmates,  the  correctional  staff  and  their  families,  and  the  surrounding  communities.  \nAccordingly,  action  must  be  taken  to  mitigate  the  potential  of  a  public  health  crisis.    We  acknowledge  that  in  some  of \nthe  Commonwealth's  judicial  districts,  judges,  district  attorneys,  the  defense  bar,  corrections  officials,  and  other \nstakeholders  are  currently  engaged  in  a  concerted,  proactive  effort  to  reduce  the  transmission  of  the  disease  in  county \ncorrectional  institutions  and  surrounding  communities  through  careful  reduction  of  the  institutions'  populations  and  other \npreventative  measures.      In  light  of  Petitioners'  allegations  that  not  all  judicial  districts  containing  county  correctional \ninstitutions have so responded, there remains the potential of unnecessary overcrowding in these facilities which must be \naddressed for the health and welfare of correctional staffs, inmates, medical professionals, as well as the general public.\n     We emphasize, however, that the immediate release of specified categories of incarcerated persons in every county \ncorrectional institution, as sought by Petitioners, fails to take into account the potential danger of inmates to victims and \nthe general population, as well as the diversity of situations present within individual institutions and communities,  which \nvary dramatically in size and population density.   Nevertheless, we recognize that the public health authorities,  including \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Pennsylvania Department of Health, continue to issue guidance \non  best  practices  for  correctional  institutions  specifically  and  congregate  settings  generally  to  employ  preventative \nmeasures, including social distancing, to control the spread of the disease.  \n     We DIRECT the President Judges of each judicial district to coordinate with relevant county stakeholders to ensure \nthat  the  county  correctional  institutions  in  their  districts  address  the  threat  of  COVID-19,  applying  the  recommendations \nof public health officials, including the CDC's Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019  (COVID-19) \nin Correctional and Detention Facilities  (Mar. 23, 2020).   If utilization of public health best practices is not feasible due \nto  the  population  of  the  county  correctional  institutions,  President  Judges  should  consult  with  relevant  county \nstakeholders to identify individuals and/or classes of incarcerated persons for potential release or transfer  to  reduce  the \ncurrent and future populations of the institutions during this health crisis with careful regard for the safety of victims and \ntheir communities in general, with awareness of the statutory rights of victims, and with due consideration given to public \nhealth  concerns  related  to  inmates  who  may  have  contracted  COVID-19.    Moreover,  consistent  with  these  above \nconsiderations, President Judges are to undertake efforts to limit the introduction of new inmates into the county prison \nsystem.\n     Additionally, the Application for Leave to Intervene, or in the Alternative, Application for Leave to File Amicus Curiae \nAnswer  in  Opposition  to  Petitioners'  Extraordinary  Jurisdiction  Application  filed  by  Marsy's  Law  for  Pennsylvania,  LLC \nand Kelly Williams is DENIED as to the request to intervene and GRANTED as to the application to file an amicus curiae \nanswer in opposition.  \n     Chief Justice Saylor files a Concurring Statement in which Justices Todd, Dougherty and Mundy join.\nApril 3, 2020 Order Exited\nOffice of the Prothonotary\nNeither the Appellate Courts nor the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts assumes any liability\nfor inaccurate or delayed data, errors or omissions on the docket sheets.\n\n 3:52 P.M.\nSupreme Court of Pennsylvania Miscellaneous Docket Sheet\nDocket Number:  70 MM 2020\nPage 13 of 13\nApril 9, 2020\nNeither the Appellate Courts nor the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts assumes any liability\nfor inaccurate or delayed data, errors or omissions on the docket sheets.",
