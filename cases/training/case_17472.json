          "description": "MINUTE entry before the Honorable Matthew F. Kennelly: This order is entered by Judge Kennelly in his capacity as emergency judge. Plaintiffs have filed a putative class action on behalf of Cook County Jail detainees against Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart. Mays v. Dart, Case No. 20 C 2134. The case, having been filed after the close of business today, has not yet been assigned to a district judge. Plaintiffs have also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction (TRO/PI) and a motion seeking an expedited hearing, specifically on 4/6/2020. Plaintiffs advise in the latter motion that on today's date, before filing suit, they gave notice of their intent to file the suit and the TRO/PI motion to the Sheriff's general counsel and to supervisory personnel in the Cook County State's Attorney's Office (CCSAO). Plaintiffs' motion for an expedited hearing is granted to the extent stated in this order. By 12:00 p.m. on 4/6/2020, plaintiffs are directed to supplement their TRO/PI motion to provide their position regarding the applicability and effect of 18 U.S.C. ยง 3626 to their lawsuit and, in particular, to the relief they are requesting in the TRO/PI motion. Defendant is directed to file a response to the TRO/PI motion by no later than 8:00 p.m. on 4/6/2020. Defendant's response should include a description of any steps defendant has taken and is taking to protect detainees from contracting the Coronavirus and to care for detainees who have already contracted the virus. A hearing on the TRO/PI motion--at least, a preliminary hearing--is set for 4/7/2020 at 10:30 a.m. and will be conducted by telephone. Counsel are to use the following call-in number: 888-684-8852, conference code 746-1053. The Court strongly encourages the parties to confer to attempt to reach a reasonable resolution of the dispute, taking into consideration the health and safety of detainees, the safety of the public, and the operation of the criminal justice system. At the hearing on April 7, the Court reserves the right to order further briefing and argument and to direct the parties to pursue mediation of the dispute. Because no attorney has yet filed an appearance for defendant, plaintiffs' counsel is directed to immediately provide notice of this order to the Sheriff's general counsel and to the CCSAO supervisory personnel to whom they provided notice of their intent to file the lawsuit and to file a verification that they have done so.

Kennelly: Defendant has made a motion to file under seal Exhibit P to its response to plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order, which is a 21 page document entitled \"Coronoavirus Operation Plan.\" The entirety of the justification for the motion is a statement that \"This plan contains sensitive law enforcement internal strategy and controls.\" The Court has reviewed the document in its entirety and cannot conclude that defendant has shown that the entire document must be kept out of the public record. The document contains an assessment of the Coronavirus outbreak and its impact on, among other things, the Cook County Jail; it details steps the Sheriff's Office has taken to attempt to deal with the outbreak; and it addresses planning for ongoing developments regarding the outbreak and the Jail. A good deal of it provides the support for what the defendant has discussed in its publicly-filed response to the motion for temporary restraining order. It is conceivable that some part of the document ought to be kept out of the public record, but the proposition that it must be sealed in its entirety is unsupported and likely unsupportable. The Court will deny the motion to seal unless defendant files, before today's telephone hearing, further support identifying the particular portions of the exhibit that should be redacted from the version to be filed in the public record and a particularized explanation for why these portions should be redacted (preferably an affidavit, though the Court acknowledges that the time before the hearing is short, so it may not insist on that for the time being).

In view of the impending expiration of the temporary restraining order entered on 4/9/2020, the request to extend it and to issue a preliminary injunction on an emergency basis (among other forms of immediate relief), and the request for expedited discovery, the matter is set for further argument on 4/20/2020 at 8:30 AM. Counsel should use the same call-in number that they used on 4/15/2020, and as before, the hearing will be simultaneously played via loudspeaker in Courtroom 2541 at the Dirksen Courthouse for members of the media or public who wish to listen to the hearing. The hearing will be strictly limited to 60 minutes in view of the need for the judge designated as emergency judge on 4/20/2020 to have access to the recorded conference line being used for emergency hearings. The parties should be prepared to address at least the following issues: (1) what should happen upon, and pending, expiration of the temporary restraining order (e.g., allow it to lapse; convert it to a preliminary injunction; order additional relief via a preliminary injunction; etc.); (2) issues regarding the application of the PLRA, 18 USC 3626, to the request(s) for relief currently before the Court, including whether the trigger for convening a 3-judge court have been met; the effect of 18 USC 3626(a)(1)(A) & (2) on the request(s) for relief that are before the Court; and whether the relief currently sought amounts to a \"prisoner release order\" under the PLRA; (3) what the due process \"objective reasonableness\" standard means as applied to the issues in this case; (4) whether an evidentiary hearing is needed on the request for a preliminary injunction that is before the Court, and if so, what it should include, what, if any, witnesses should testify, and when and how it should be held; and (5) what, if any, of the expedited discovery currently sought by plaintiffs (via their reply brief) should be allowed, and whether, if an evidentiary hearing will be held, defendants want expedited discovery. The Court will also do its best, within the available time limits, to give each party a brief opportunity to address significant points not on this list that the party believes it has not addressed sufficiently in the written materials it has filed.

No more than 3 attorneys per side may participate in the video conference. Counsel are to promptly contact the Clerk, if they have not already done so, to make arrangements to participate for themselves and their witnesses. Judge Kennelly will preside in courtroom 1003, which will be open to the press and public for viewing. The two witnesses to be called are Dr. Venters (plaintiffs) and Mr. Miller (defendant). Following consultation by the Court with counsel, the following procedures will apply, subject to adjustment if technical difficulties intervene. (1) Mr. Miller will testify first, starting as soon as possible after the hearing begins at 12:30 PM, but starting no later than 12:45 PM. His direct examination will be his previously filed affidavits, supplemented by 10 minutes of questioning by defendant's counsel, followed by 45 minutes of questioning by plaintiffs' counsel, 10 minutes for redirect by defendant's counsel, and 5-10 minutes for questioning by the Court. (2) Dr. Venters will testify next. His direct examination will be his previously filed affidavit, supplemented by 10 minutes of questioning by plaintiffs' counsel, followed by 45 minutes of questioning by defendant's counsel, 10 minutes for redirect by plaintiff's counsel, and 5-10 minutes for questioning by the Court. (The Court is willing to consider extending Dr. Venters's time by a bit to roughly equalize the time for each side's witness.) (3) Then defendant will be permitted to recall Mr. Miller for no more than 10 minutes of further testimony, followed by questioning by plaintiffs' counsel in an amount equal to that used by defendant's counsel. (4) After the testimony is complete, each side will be given 15 minutes for argument, assuming there is sufficient time remaining before the hearing concludes at or about 4:30 PM.

For purposes of public and press access, audio-only access to the hearing will be available via the following call-in number: 571-353-2300, access code 314-468-475.

The invitation will include instructions for participating by video and also participating by telephone only and will include a password for video access. Participation in the video aspect of the hearing will be limited to three lawyers for plaintiffs, three lawyers for defendants, and one lawyer for the proposed intervenor, though the Court does not anticipate that the proposed intervenor will be presenting arguments on the request for expedited discovery or the motion to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. Others may participate by telephone. Counsel should sign in at least 10 minutes early to make sure they have the correct video and audio settings. For purposes of public and press access, audio-only access to the hearing will be available via the following call-in number: 571-353-2300, access code 314-468-475. If there are technical problems with the video conference, the Court will recess the video hearing and will resume the hearing by telephone conference. The call-in number for the fallback telephone conference is 888-684-8852, and the access code is 746-1053. All persons granted remote video or audio access to proceedings are reminded of the prohibitions against photographing, recording, and rebroadcasting of court proceedings. Violation of these prohibitions may result in sanctions, including removal of court issued media credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed appropriate by the Court.

The court notes that, (a) the preliminary injunction entered by the emergency judge has been appealed, and (b) the court has recently granted the union representing the Cook County Jail staff the right to intervene as a party defendant. Having considered the positions of the parties, and the dynamics of this case, the court sets a tentative fact and expert discovery cutoff for 9/30/2020. The court refers discovery supervision and settlement matters to Magistrate Judge David Weisman. Finally, the court notes that this schedule is subject to change depending on the ruling of the Court of Appeals on the appeal of the preliminary injunction entered by the emergency judge. Due to the current COVID-19 Emergency schedule, the court will set an in-court status hearing prior to the close of discovery. Mailed notice (cn). (Entered: 06/03/2020)"

Defendant Dart reported that he intends to seek certiorari from the United States Supreme Court regarding the Seventh Circuit's decision. He anticipates filing any such petition by 1/15/21. (See dkt. 154 .) As discussed, the parties generally agree to stay formal discovery and extend the preliminary injunction with the ability to seek modifications as necessary and are working towards a proposed agreed order to present to the district court. A telephonic status hearing is set for 12/3/2020 at 1:00 p.m. to confirm that the parties have reached such an agreement. To the extent the parties wish this Court to assist in negotiating such an agreement, the Court is available to do so.

          "description": "ORDER: Magistrate status hearing held. Parties appeared telephonically. The Court considered plaintiffs proposed limited and expedited discovery requests. Based on plaintiffs' oral motion to proceed with limited and expedited discovery, and over the defendant's objection, the Court granted some of plaintiffs' limited discovery requests for the reasons stated on the record and herein. Initially, we note that defendant Dart Thomas sought the ability to brief these issues. As previously explained by this Court, the time consumed in litigating many of the relevant legal and factual issues in this matter works against prompt and fair resolution of the matters. Because the nature and impact of the COVID virus and resulting pandemic implications on society are seemingly constantly shifting, the longer this Court waits to resolve some of these issues, the more likely the relevant factual issues will change. While this is somewhat unavoidable, increasing the length to resolve these issues, simply increases the chances that the issues will change. Therefore, the Court has decided to move forward in a way calculated to allow the district court and the parties to bring some measure of resolution to the matter. Recognizing that all factual issues that might need to be addressed by the district court have not been fully developed, the Court has attempted to allow limited discovery to proceed on issues that seem most likely to be relevant to the modification and/or termination of the preliminary injunction order in this matter. First, as to plaintiffs' request for the production of the specified closed circuit (CCTV) footage, counsel for defendant Dart Thomas reported that defendant has preserved plaintiffs' requested CCTV, without waiving any objections to produce. Defendant Dart Thomas need not produce the CCTV at this time as plaintiffs have not shown any particular relevance to this material as it relates to the issues before the district court. Subject to further review, defendant will post (at previously used locations) plaintiffs' requested flyer with a hotline number that class members can use to contact attorneys with specific concerns they have in relation to the pending injunction. The Court ruled on plaintiffs' proposed discovery requests. Regarding the plaintiffs' first set of interrogatories, defendant must provide answers to interrogatory requests 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16. In its answer to interrogatory request #7, the defendant must explain the definition he is employing for each of the identified categories. Defendant will not be required to answer interrogatories 2, 6, 9, 10, and 13 at this time. Plaintiffs made an oral motion for leave to issue a subpoena to Cermak Health Services in light of the Court's ruling with respect to plaintiffs' interrogatories. The Court granted plaintiffs' oral motion without objection, and the plaintiffs may issue a subpoena to Cermak. The gist of the issue here is that Cermak Health Services (not defendant Dart Thomas) has access to the information that plaintiffs seek in some of plaintiffs' proposed interrogatories. Regarding plaintiffs' second set of requests for production, all productions will be limited to the temporal scope of 12/01/2021, forward. Defendant must produce responses to requests 1 and 5. Defendant will not be required to produce responses to requests 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 at this time. If the plaintiffs are unable to receive facts needed through cooperation with the defendant, the Court will entertain very limited additional requests for discovery. Defendant to answer interrogatories and requests for production by 2/21/2022. Status hearing set for 3/09/2022 at 10:00 a.m. Parties shall dial in using the Court's conference call-in number. The conference call-in number is 1-877-411-9748 and the passcode is 1814539. Parties shall file a joint status report by 3/07/2022. Signed by the Honorable M. David Weisman on 2/1/2022.

International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 700 has filed a motion to intervene in the Mays case and has filed it not only on the docket in that case but also on the emergency docket. The motion, however, does not describe any emergency. Indeed, it says (in paragraph 6) that the movant \"does not seek reconsideration of any preliminary rulings entered thus far\" and instead seeks to protect the interest of the plaintiff's members \"as complications arise with the implementation of those rulings\" or \"as the Court considers permanent relief,\" neither of which appear to describe emergencies. The Court therefore terminates the motion on the emergency docket. If movant considers the motion to present an emergency, then it should file an amended motion on the emergency docket. Otherwise, the motion can appropriately be dealt with by the assigned judge in the Mays case. (mk) (Entered: 04/30/2020)"

    "summary": "<p>As of April 3, 2020, at least 167 detainees and 46 staff members at Cook County Jail (\"the Jail\") in Chicago had tested positive for the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. In response, the plaintiffs filed this class action complaint under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 on behalf of the class of persons who are detained in the Jail and are facing unreasonable and unnecessary risks of exposure to the coronavirus. The plaintiffs alleged that despite being aware of the substantial risk of harm that COVID-19 poses, the defendant continues to place the plaintiffs in inherently congregate and unclean settings in the Jail and the defendant fails to take reasonable measures to mitigate the dangers spread by the novel coronavirus. As a result, the plaintiffs claimed that class members are deprived of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to reasonably safe living conditions. They sought an order on behalf of all class members requiring the Cook County Sheriff to implement constitutionally sufficient procedures to protect their health and safety that are consistent with CDC guidelines and the expert judgment of correctional health specialists. The plaintiffs were represented by a team of lawyers from the civil rights firm Loevy &amp; Loevy, the MacArthur Justice Center at Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, and the Civil Rights Corps, a criminal justice advocacy organization in Washington DC.</p>\r\n<p>The proposed class included two subclasses. Subclass A consisted of people in custody who had vulnerabilities that place them in heightened risk of contracting serious COVID-19, including persons over the age of 65 and persons with underlying medical conditions that put them at particular risk of serious harm or death from COVID-19, including but not limited to people with respiratory conditions including chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma; people with heart disease or other heart conditions; people who are immunocompromised as a result of cancer, HIV/AIDS, or any other condition or related to treatment for a medical condition; people with chronic liver or kidney disease or renal failure (including hepatitis and dialysis patients); people with diabetes, epilepsy, hypertension, blood disorders (including sickle cell disease), inherited metabolic disorders; people who have had or are at risk of stroke; and people with any other condition specifically identified by CDC either now or in the future as being a particular risk for severe illness and/or death caused by COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2241 on behalf of Subclass A members, alleging that petitioners were held in custody in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and seeking immediate release of these Subclass A petitioners.</p>\r\n<p>Subclass B consisted of all people who are currently housed on a tier where someone has already tested positive for the coronavirus. The plaintiffs sought transfer of these inmates to a safe facility or some other form of custody.</p>\r\n<p>The same day, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) or preliminary injunction, as well as a motion for an expedited hearing. On April 9, 2020, Judge Matthew F. Kennelly, in his capacity as Emergency Judge, conditionally certified Subclasses A and B for the purpose of the motion for a TRO, noting that temporary or preliminary injunctive relief could be granted before a class certification ruling. The court then granted in part the plaintiffs' motion for a TRO after addressing the plaintiffs' likelihood of success with respect to each of their claims.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ultimately, the court issued narrower temporary relief than sought by the plaintiffs. Specifically, the court directed the defendant to implement a policy requiring \"prompt coronavirus testing\" of symptomatic detainees, and to the extent feasible based on the acquisition of sufficient testing materials, detainees who had been exposed to the virus. The court also directed the defendant to implement social distancing during the new detainee intake process, including suspending the use of bullpens to hold new detainees awaiting intake. The court further ordered the provision of sanitation products and implementation of a sanitation policy. The court declined the plaintiffs' request for an order requiring the Sheriff to provide all detainees with PPE, instead ordering the defendant to provide masks to only those detainees in quarantine&mdash;i.e., those who have been exposed to a detainee who is symptomatic. The court declined the plaintiffs' request to order the defendant to provide adequate medical staff to monitor all detainees within the Jail, and to immediately identify or segregate all medically vulnerable detainees. Finally, the court denied the plaintiffs' request for an order requiring the transfer of Subclass B members to a safe facility or other forms of custody.</p>\r\n<p>With respect to the plaintiffs' habeas corpus action, the court found that because the plaintiffs had not sought emergency bond reductions for at-risk detainees, the habeas corpus claim on the part of the representatives of subclass A was barred due to failure to exhaust available state court remedies.</p>\r\n<p>On April 14, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and limited expedited discovery. After holding an evidentiary hearing, on April 27, the court entered a preliminary injunction requiring the defendant to implement a COVID-19 testing policy, enforce social distancing, provide soap or hand sanitizer to all detainees, implement a sanitization policy, provide face masks to quarantined detainees, and establish a policy precluding group housing or double celling of detained persons in the absence of specific exemptions.</p>\r\n<p>On May 11, 2020, the defendant provided notice of appeal to the United States Circuit Court for the Seventh Circuit to challenge the district court's conditional class certification and preliminary injunction orders. The defendants moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal on May 19, and also asked the Seventh Circuit to stay the preliminary injunction. On May 29, the district court denied the defendant's motion to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal and the plaintiffs&rsquo; earlier motion for expedited discovery.</p>\r\n<p>On June 2, the court granted the motion to intervene by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 700 (the Union), which was filed May 1. The next day, the case was referred to Magistrate Judge M. David Weisman for a settlement conference and discovery.</p>\r\n<p>On June 19, the Seventh Circuit granted in part the motion to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. The injunction was stayed only to the extent that it required the defendants to put into effect a policy \"precluding group housing or double celling of detained persons.\"</p>\r\n<p>On July 7, the parties jointly sought to extend the preliminary injunction and stay discovery pending appeal, which was granted on July 9.</p>\r\n<p>On September 8, 2020, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court's granting of the preliminary injunction for all forms of relief except for the double celling and group housing. The Seventh Circuit determined that the district court failed to afford the Sheriff sufficient deference in his determination of the need for double celling, but for all other claims the Court determined that the district court had made detailed factual findings and properly considered the Sheriff's conduct in its totality in granting closely-tailored relief in accordance with CDC guidelines.</p>\r\n<p>In January 2021, the court granted the parties' joint motion to extend the Preliminary Injunction and to stay discovery pending Petition for Certiorari. Defendant Dart filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on January 15, 2021. The Supreme Court denied the petition on October 4, 2021. 142 S. Ct. 69. The court again granted the parties&rsquo; joint motion to extend the Preliminary Injunction in December 2021.</p>\r\n<p>On February 1, 2022, in an attempt to move toward some measure of resolution on the case, the court allowed limited discovery on issues most likely to be relevant to the modification and/or termination of the preliminary injunction order. Then, in May 2022, the parties began engaging in settlement discussions. In light of these discussions, the parties agreed to stay discovery. After a series of settlement conferences with Magistrate Judge M. David Weisman, the parties reached a settlement in principle on March 20, 2023. On September 14, 2023, the parties filed a joint motion to approve the settlement.</p>\r\n<p>Under the proposed settlement agreement, the parties stipulated that the proposed settlement class should be certified under Rule 23(b)(2) for the purposes of settlement. Acknowledging that the Covid-19 pandemic posed a serious and urgent danger to the people housed in the Cook County Jail, the proposed settlement agreement further provided that the Cook County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office and Cermak Health Services would make policy changes to two policies to &nbsp;address both entities&rsquo; response to Covid-19 should the virus reemerge as a &nbsp;serious public health threat. Additionally, the parties agreed upon attorney fees for the expenses incurred by Plaintiff&rsquo;s counsel; the proposed settlement agreement did not explicitly name the amount. The parties also submitted a proposed notice form to be posted throughout the Cook County Jail for a 45-day period to explain the basis of the lawsuit, the contours of the settlement class, the relief to which the settlement class members were entitled, and the rights of the settlement class members. The parties also asked the Court for guidance with regards to whether additional notice published in two local newspapers was required. The proposed settlement is currently pending approval from the court.</p>",

Robert Gettleman \n  Defendant-Respondent.    )  Presiding Judge \n \nREPLY IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ RENEWED MOTION FOR A  \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND FOR LIMITED, EXPEDITED DISCOVERY \n \nINTRODUCTION \n  The Sheriff’s response has clarified the path forward in this litigation. The Sheriff has \nconceded that medically required social distancing is not possible with the current jail population \ngiven the basic security requirements of running a jail. Doc. No. 62 at 19 (“[T]he Sheriff cannot \nimplement ‘full’ social distancing throughout the Jail at this time.”). The Sheriff having conceded \nthe point, this court should so find. \nThe Sheriff’s concession leads necessarily to the conclusion that, without a reduction of \nthe Jail’s population, the lives and safety of the persons confined there cannot be reasonably \nprotected. As a society, we have sacrificed our economy and upended every aspect of our collective \nand individual lives because of the consensus that social distancing is critical to the protection of \nhealth and life. That consensus applies no less to the presumptively innocent individuals who are \nfacing confinement as they await their trials, even if they cannot afford to pay the cash bonds \nrequired for their release. Indeed, that is the judgment of every medical expert in this case. See \nDeclaration of Dr. Homer Venters, former Chief Medical Officer of the NYC Jail Correctional \nHealth Services (Ex. A hereto) ¶ 19; Declaration of Gregg Gonsalves, Yale Medical School \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 2 of 37 PageID #:1746\nEpidemiologist (Ex. G to Plaintiffs’ Renewed Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc. No. 55-7)) \n¶ 29; Declaration of Dr. Amir Mohareb (Ex. B hereto) at 5-6; Declaration of Laura Rasmussen-\nTorvik (Ex. C hereto), ¶ 8. The Sheriff has proffered no contrary medical opinion. Thus, this court \nshould also find that “social distancing” as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC), Illinois and federal emergency orders for the protection of the general public, \nand by Plaintiffs’ medical experts is necessary to reasonably protect individuals confined in the \nJail.1  \nFrom  these  two  findings,  it  follows  that  the  court  must  address  how  to  reduce  the \npopulation of the Jail’s physical plant. Without such a reduction, the Jail is concededly incapable \nof protecting the due process rights of those confined there.  \nAs we explain below, there are three practical steps that should be taken simultaneously. \nFirst, the court should convene a three-judge panel to consider whether and to what extent to enter \na prisoner release order. See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3)(A). In light of the extreme urgency, Plaintiffs \nask this court to request that this tribunal be convened immediately. Second, independently from \nthe three-judge panel procedure, the court should order the Sheriff to transfer detainees to some \nother safe location of his choosing where they will remain in his custody. Third, the court should \nimmediately determine the eligibility of the subclass A Plaintiffs to emergency habeas relief. In \n                                                 \n1   The key feature of social distancing is that individuals be able to keep at least 6 feet (or 2 meters) \napart from other individuals. This is the position of the CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html); the Illinois Department of Public Health \n(http://dph.illinois.gov/sites/default/files/COVID-19_SocialDistancing.pdf); the American Medical \nAssociation (https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/covid-19-how-persuade-patients-\npractice-social-distancing); the American Red Cross (https://www.redcross.org/about-us/news-and-\nevents/news/2020/coronavirus-what-social-distancing-means.html); Johns Hopkins Medicine \n(https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-social-\ndistancing-and-self-quarantine); and the American Psychological Association \n(https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-social-\ndistancing-and-self-quarantine), among others; see also infra Section I. \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 3 of 37 PageID #:1747\nlight of the Sheriff’s acknowledgement that he has not done any medical triage of the most \nvulnerable (and in fact does not know who the medically vulnerable are)—even after the recent \ndeath of a third class member—there is a clear and present danger to the lives of the most medically \nvulnerable inside the Jail.  \nFinally, even as the release of some detainees is being addressed, the court must evaluate \nthe conditions within the Jail for those who will remain behind bars. There is evidence of frequent \nbreakdowns in the Sheriff’s sanitation regimens; there is great uncertainty about the extent of \nspread of the virus within the Jail and a serious question as to the adequacy of the Jail’s testing \nregimen;  there  has  been  rapid  reallocation  of  housing  within  the  Jail,  potentially  exposing \ndetainees to unacceptable living environments, among other things. In the final section, Plaintiffs \nexplain that—even though there is no factual dispute as to the necessity for reduction of the Jail’s \npopulation—targeted,  expedited  discovery,  the  conversion  of  the  TRO  into  a  Preliminary \nInjunction (or the extension of the TRO with good cause), and potentially an evidentiary hearing \nare necessary to ensure adequate conditions for those who will remain. \nTHE FACTS BEHIND THE JAIL WALLS \n \nThe Evidence on the Imperative of Social Distancing Is Undisputed \n \nThe Sheriff does not dispute that maintaining social distance is an imperative for protection \nagainst becoming infected with the novel coronavirus. It is a medical necessity—even for those \nconfined in a jail. All of the evidence in this record supports that proposition. Plaintiffs have \ndiscussed in their previous filings the voluminous evidence in the public record on the imperative \nof  social  distancing.  The  CDC  describes  social  distancing  as  “a  cornerstone  of  reducing \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 4 of 37 PageID #:1748\ntransmission  of  respiratory  diseases  such  as  COVID-19[,]”2  as  “[t]he  best  way  to  prevent \nillness[,]”3 and as “extra important” for vulnerable individuals.4 Governor Pritzker has described \nsocial distancing as a “paramount strategy for minimizing the spread of COVID-19 in our \ncommunities[.]”5 The City of Chicago advises that “[w]ithout social distancing to slow the spread \nof COVID-19, the number of cases can increase so quickly that hospitals will not have nearly \nenough beds and equipment to care for all patients.”6 \nMedical and epidemiological experts agree. Dr. Homer Venters, an epidemiologist and \ncorrectional medical expert who formerly oversaw the delivery of medical care in New York City \njails, has submitted a declaration opining that social distancing is among the most evidence-based \nand critical interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19. Ex. A ¶ 9. Because individuals can \ntransmit the disease before becoming symptomatic, id., social distancing is “imperative to decrease \nrampant spread . . . and protect people’s health.” Id. ¶ 18. \nDr. Amir Mohareb, an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital who \nis a member of that hospital’s Biothreats Response Team and an instructor at Harvard Medical \nSchool, has explained in his declaration that social distancing is the “primary means” of protecting \npublic health. Ex. B at 5-6. Dr. Mohareb further explains that proper hygiene and the provision of \nsurgical masks cannot serve as an adequate substitute for social distancing, given the inability of \n                                                 \n2   “Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional \nand Detention Facilities,” CDC, available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/downloads/guidance-correctional-detention.pdf. \n3   “How to Protect Yourself & Others,” CDC, available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html. \n4   “What You Can Do,” CDC, available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-\nprecautions/what-you-can-do.html. \n5   Executive Order 2020-18, Apr. 1, 2020, available at \nhttps://www2.illinois.gov/Documents/ExecOrders/2020/ExecutiveOrder-2020-18.pdf. \n6   City of Chicago, Frequently Asked Questions (Apr. 17, 2020), available at \nhttps://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/frequently-asked-questions-.html?#faq-protect. \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 5 of 37 PageID #:1749\nsurgical masks to protect individuals from airborne transmission of COVID-19 and the inability \nof proper hygiene to protect against both droplet and airborne transmission of the virus. Id. at 3, \n5-6. The medical evidence instead establishes that “social distancing [is] a necessary intervention \nto prevent the spread of infection and downstream complications of COVID-19.” Id. at 6. \nDr. Gregg Gonsalves, an epidemiologist and professor at the Yale Schools of Medicine and \nPublic Health, concluded that “ensuring that all detainees in Cook County Jail can socially distance \nfrom one another is the only way to prevent further, essentially uncontrolled, spread of the virus.” \nDoc. No. 55-7 ¶ 29. Dr. Gonsalves has further explained that the Jail’s ability to effect social \ndistancing will have a direct impact on the utilization of county hospital beds (beds that are \nrequired for all County residents), as well as mitigating the harm to Jail staff and the public from \nan uncontrolled outbreak. Id. ¶¶ 29-31. \nDr.  Laura  Rasmussin-Torvik,  Ph.D.,  Chief  of  Epidemiology  in  the  Department  of \nPreventive Medicine at Northwestern University and a member of the Northwestern faculty, \nconcurs. Ex. C at ¶ 8 (“Given recent evidence of spread of COVID-19 from people without any \nsymptoms  (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6914e1.htm) it  is  critical \nthat all Illinoisans  continue  to  practice  social  distancing,  remaining  6  feet  apart, \npracticing appropriate hand hygiene, and utilizing cloth masks whenever possible in order to \ncontrol the spread of this disease.”). \nEven the Sheriff agrees that social distancing is necessary. In a recent supplemental \ndeclaration, Michael Miller states that the Sheriff has “emphasized that detainees should maintain \n6-feet of distance from each other.” Doc. No. 62-5 (Miller. Supp. Decl.) ¶ 18; see also Doc. No. \n62 at 13 (“complete social distancing is the ideal”). Despite these admissions, the Sheriff continues \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 6 of 37 PageID #:1750\nto house Plaintiffs in a way that makes social distancing among detainees impossible because there \nare too many people in his custody to do otherwise.  \nThe Sheriff Has Conceded That Social Distancing \nIs Impossible at Current Population Levels \n \nThe Sheriff concedes that he “cannot implement ‘full’ social distancing throughout the Jail \nat this time.” Doc. No. 62 at 19. This is not for lack of trying. The Sheriff appears to have taken \ndramatic steps to try to expand the Jail’s capacity, including by opening tiers that have been closed \nfor some time. For example, since March 15 the Sheriff has opened Division 4, which had been \nclosed entirely, as well as numerous tiers in Division 2. See Doc. No. 62-5 (Miller Supp. Decl.) at \n11-14. Indeed, multiple detainees have reported that in the last few days they have been moved to \nmothballed units that appear not to have been used in year, many of which are filthy, lack heat, \nand lack running or potable water. E.g., Ex. D (Detainee Decls.) at 4, 11, 13. \nThese efforts are insufficient. First, the Sheriff’s submission concedes that detainees are \nstill being confined in double cells. Doc. No. 62 at 20. Social distancing in a double celled \nenvironment is categorically impossible. \nSecond, the Court will recall expressing concern that given the tight bunk-bed arrangement \nin Division 2, even placing units in that Division at 50% capacity was unlikely to effectuate social \ndistancing. See Apr. 7, 2020 Tr. at 24:9-20. Yet the Sheriff’s latest submission shows that of \nDivision 2’s 40 dorm units, 20 are at above 40% capacity, ranging up to 70% and above. Doc. No. \n62-5 at 9-12. A similar pattern appears in Division 8, a photograph of which is also included in \nPlaintiffs’ complaint. See Doc. No. 1 at ¶ 33 (bottom photograph). Of the 30 RTU tiers in Division \n8, 21 are above 40% capacity, and 12 are at or near 70% capacity. Doc. No. 62-5 at 14. These tiers \nhouse hundreds of people who are unable to take the most basic protective measures against \nCOVID-19. These detainees will be forced to sleep and live well within six feet of each other. Not \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 7 of 37 PageID #:1751\nsurprisingly, many of these tiers are quarantined, indicating that some of the detainees housed there \ntested positive for COVID-19. \nThird, the jail’s dorms and tiers are enclosed spaces in which dozens of detainees are \nconfined together. Thus even if detainees manage at times to achieve six feet of separation, that \nwill not be sufficient to address the health risk in such environments. As Dr. Amir Mohareb \nexplains, such settings are ideal environment for long-distance, airborne transmission of COVID-\n19: \nvirus particles in small respiratory droplets (<5micrometres) that are emitted by an \ninfected person can remain suspended in the air and remain infective over several \nhours and over long distances. Pathogens that travel via airborne transmission can \ninfect persons even if they are wearing surgical or procedural masks. Healthcare \nworkers protect themselves against airborne transmission by wearing specialized \nmasks (N95 masks or Powered Air-Purifying Respirators) and by isolating infected \npersons in closed rooms with negative-pressure ventilation. Buildings or facilities \nwith other forms of ventilation may spread aerosolized pathogens between rooms. \n \nEx. B (Mohareb Decl.) at 3.  \nNotably, this form of transmission is distinct from the large respiratory (>5micrometres) \ntransmission for which the six-foot rule is designed. Id. The jail’s detainee housing, needless to \nsay, is not a negative pressure environment, nor is it well ventilated. Hundreds of detainees, in \nother words, still sit all day in close proximity to numerous other detainees, in poorly ventilated \nrooms that will allow any one of them to pass on a virus that can survive in the air for at least three \nhours. Id. In such environments, as Dr. Mohareb notes, the cloth masks that detainees have been \nprovided (see Doc. No. 62-5 (Miller Supp. Decl.) ¶ 23) are not adequate protection against airborne \ntransmission. Id. at 5-6. Indeed as the CDC cautions, effective social distancing is required “even \nwhen you wear a face covering.”7 \n                                                 \n7   “Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation,” CDC, available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html. \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 8 of 37 PageID #:1752\n  Finally, the jail’s dorms and tiers are simply not set up to isolate large numbers of people. \nTo the contrary, they are designed in a manner that ensures large numbers of people will touch the \nsame things, constantly. As can be seen from the complaint photos of Tiers 2 and 8, for example, \ndozens of detainees share common bathrooms, showers, sinks, toilets, meal tables, microwaves, \nand the like. The same situation exists on other tiers, even those with individual cells. Ex. D \n(Detainee Decls.) at 2-3, 7-8, 10, 14. Although increased cleaning will certainly help, each of those \nsurfaces  inevitably  will  be  touched  by  numerous  different  people  throughout  the  day—\ncompounding the risk of transmission.  \n  In the present emergency, the design of the jail makes it impossible to imprison so many \npersons in a reasonably safe manner. As a district court recently explained, “the only way to stop \n[COVID-19’s]  spread  is  through  preventive  measures—principal  among  them  maintaining \nphysical distancing sufficient to hinder airborne person-to-person transmission. Creating physical \ndistancing is uniquely difficult in a congregate environment like a prison. . . . [which is] a problem \nshared by all prisons” alike. Coleman v. Newsom, 2020 WL 1675775, at *5 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 4, \n2020) (citations omitted, emphasis original). \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE CONSTITUTION PROTECTS CLASS MEMBERS FROM A SERIOUS AND \nUNREASONABLE RISK TO THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY. \nIt cannot be consistent with due process to allow the Jail’s detainees to remain in an \nenvironment in which they are unnecessarily and unreasonably exposed to a potentially deadly, \nlife-altering coronavirus. The consensus of medical and epidemiological judgment on the record \nof this case is that such a practice is intolerable and cannot be justified.  \nDue process requires that detainees in a jail be protected from conditions that “pose an \nunreasonable risk of serious damage to . . . future health.” Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 35 \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 9 of 37 PageID #:1753\n(1993); see also Powers v. Snyder, 484 F.3d 929, 931 (7th Cir. 2007) (The Eighth Amendment \nprotects prisoners from known exposure to serious diseases, and in such circumstances, “[t]he \nprison must be allowed to choose between removing the prisoner from the unhealthy environment \nand  protecting  him  from  its  consequences  .  .  .  provided,  of  course,  that  the  protection  is \nefficacious.”); Mark v. Officers Olson, Haglin, Harsma Granton’s 1st, 2nd, 3rd Shift Officers \nBetween Dates of 7-29-02, 8-13-02, 2003 WL 23221515, at *7-8 (W.D. Wis. Oct. 21, 2003) \n(plaintiff properly alleged that prison officials acted with deliberate indifference to his health when \nthey knowingly placed another inmate who had been diagnosed with hepatitis B and hepatitis C in \nhis cell, for “[c]ertainly, in some cases, the risk of harm in placing a healthy inmate in the same \ncell as one with a communicable disease would be significant enough to be considered cruel and \nunusual punishment.”).8 So too here: it cannot pass constitutional muster to allow detainees in the \nJail to live in close proximity to others who may be infected with a deadly virus. \nThe Sheriff contends that he has satisfied the Fourteenth Amendment by complying with \nthe CDC’s Guidance for jails and prisons because that guidance essentially tells him to do the best \nhe can to socially distance, understanding he has no control over jail population. But the CDC’s \nguidelines to jails to do the best they can to protect confined prisoners as practicable based on \ncurrent population and space limitations does not, by definition, purport to be a statement of what \n                                                 \n8   Scores of cases nationwide reinforce this principle, and show that, even if held to an Eighth \nAmendment standard, the Sheriff would be liable for failing to provide protection from a risk of serious \nmedical harm. See also, e.g., Washington v. Denney, 900 F.3d 549 (8th Cir. 2018) (failure to protect an \ninmate from exposure to secondhand smoke constitutes deliberate indifference to his serious medical need); \nBall v.

On this \nquestion, the CDC can set neither a constitutional floor nor a constitutional ceiling for jails on what \nis objectively reasonable—that is for this Court to decide, in light of the particular conditions that \nPlaintiffs are experiencing and the particular risks that they face as a result. See United States v. \nProano, 912 F.3d 431, 439 (7th Cir. 2019) (the Constitution, “not departmental policy, sets the \nconstitutional  floor”);  Thompson  v.  City  of  Chicago,  472  F.3d  444,  454  (7th  Cir.  2006) \n(administrative regulations “shed[] no light on what may or may not be considered ‘objectively \nreasonable’”). \nIn Thompson, the Seventh Circuit held that an administrative order regarding use of force \nhad no relevance to the question of whether a police officer’s use of force was “objectively \nreasonable” under the Fourth Amendment. 472 F.3d at 454-55. The court explained that because \nan  assessment  of  objective  reasonableness  demands  particular  consideration  of  the  precise \ncircumstances of the case, administrative guidance and general orders were not “reliable gauges” \nof what was required by the Constitution. Id. at 455. In Proano, the Seventh Circuit explained that \nadministrative guidance and the like are admissible in cases where intent is at issue—because a \ndeviation from guidance and training permits an inference of culpable intent—but often are not \nrelevant in cases that lack a specific-intent requirement. 912 F.3d at 439. \nAdministrative guidance may have some relevance in certain situations, like when the \nreasonableness of the particular circumstances involves consideration of issues for which expert \ntestimony would helpful to the trier of fact to understand the evidence. See United States v. Brown, \n871 F.3d 532, 537 (7th Cir. 2017). But even if relevant, this type of evidence must be assessed in \nlight of the other expert testimony and evidence in the case, including all of the CDC’s guidance \nabout COVID-19, and the court must ensure that the constitutional inquiry “is governed by \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 11 of 37 PageID #:1755\nconstitutional principles, not [administrative] regulations.” Id. at 537; see also England v. Allen, \n2019 WL 2743481, at *5 (N.D. Ill. July 1, 2019) (describing the slight relevance that administrative \nregulations have in objective reasonableness inquiry). \nThe Sheriff’s citation to Carroll v. DeTella, 255 F.3d 470 (7th Cir. 2001), supports the \nprinciple. Doc. No. 62 at 17. In Carroll, the Seventh Circuit determined that no reasonable jury \ncould find that the defendant had the requisite subjective disregard for health and safety required \nby the Eighth Amendment, given his compliance with mandatory state standards. 255 F.3d at 473. \nBut in Carroll, the EPA standard at issue reflected the agency’s judgement about an acceptable \nsafety standard for all people—the EPA did not single prisoners out for less protection from water \ncontamination, or conclude that a higher risk of cancer was acceptable for prisoners than the public \nat large. Id. at 473. \nThe CDC Guidance at issue here does something else entirely. The Guidance encourages \ncorrectional institutions to implement social distancing, but only to the extent practicable given \nthe facility’s particular circumstances.9 The CDC’s correctional guidance effectively abandons the \nsocial distancing recommendation to the extent that a jail’s population and its physical plant make \nsocial distancing impracticable. But it is not for the CDC to decide whether it is objectively \nreasonable to expose pretrial detainees to serious medical risks that our society has deemed \nintolerable for everyone else; that is a decision for this court. \nThe Sheriff thus wrongly implies that the CDC Guidelines for jails indicates that the CDC \nbelieves that social distancing can safely be abandoned in jails. To the contrary, public health \nauthorities, the CDC first among them, have issued a raft of admonishments that effective social \ndistancing is critical for stopping the spread of COVID-19.10 \n                                                 \n9   See supra n.2. \n10   See supra n.1. \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 12 of 37 PageID #:1756\nThe CDC’s Guidance for individuals11 explains that “keeping space between you and \nothers is one of the best tools we have to avoid being exposed to this virus and slowing its spread.” \nCDC therefore advises individuals to: \n•  Stay at least 6 feet from other people, “even when you wear a face covering” \n•  Do not gather in groups \n•  Stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings \n•  Avoid grocery shopping; use a delivery service \n•  Work from home \n•  Avoid public transportation \nThe  CDC’s  guidance  for  public  officials  place  this  individual  guidance  in  context, \nrecommending that when there is community spread, officials should consider closures of schools, \nworkplaces, and even assisted living facilities and religious congregations. Other authorities are \nequally emphatic. The Illinois Department of Public Health recommends that people stay at least \nsix feet apart, avoid public transportation, work from home, use a delivery service instead of \nshopping,  suspend  schooling,  and  the  like.12  The  American  Medical  Association  likewise \nrecommends that “[p]hysical distancing and staying at home are the key to slowing the spread of \n2019 novel coronavirus,” and likewise recommends a six-foot separation,13 as does the American \nRed Cross.14 And the court, of course, is witness to this advice playing out in the most dramatic \nfashion. On the advice of these same authorities, to accomplish social distancing, we have shut \ndown our national economy, with catastrophic and cascading effects across the country. If public \n                                                 \n11   “Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation,” CDC, available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html. \n12   “COVID-19 Social Distancing,” Ill.

The CDC’s Guidance merely acknowledges that jails and \nprisons may not be able to implement proper social distancing. It urges these institutions, in effect, \nto do their best within the limits of the carceral environment. But that cannot be taken to say that \nto place the Jail’s detainees at a high risk of contracting a deadly disease—a risk that our society \nhas deemed unacceptable—comports with the Fourteenth Amendment. \nII.  THE COURT MAY MAKE THE NECESSARY FINDINGS AND BEGIN THE \nSTEPS NECESSARY TO CONVENE A THREE JUDGE PANEL TO CONSIDER \nRELEASE OF DETAINEES. \n \nPlaintiffs urge the court to request the convening of a three-judge panel to determine \nwhether and to what extent a prisoner release order should be entered in this case. 18 U.S.C. \n§ 3626(a)(3)(A). Plaintiffs further request that this court simultaneously enter a preliminary \ninjunction mandating the Sheriff to permit detainees to socially distance from one another, except \nin an emergency situation. \nA.  This  Court  Should  Immediately  Request  That  A  Three-Judge  Panel  Be \nConvened. \n \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) prohibits a prisoner release order to be entered \nunless a court has “previously entered an order for less intrusive relief that has failed to remedy \nthe deprivation of the Federal right” at issue, and the defendant has had “a reasonable amount of \ntime to comply” with prior court orders. 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3)(A). Once these conditions are \nsatisfied, a three-judge panel should be convened, either upon request of the party seeking the \norder or sua sponte by the court, following the procedures set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 2284. \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 14 of 37 PageID #:1758\nThe conditions of Section 3626(a)(3)(A) have been satisfied. First, the court has already entered \nan injunctive order for less intrusive relief. On April 9, 2020, this court issued a temporary \nrestraining order, directing the Sheriff to (a) establish a policy requiring prompt testing of \nsymptomatic detainees and, to the extent feasible, those who were exposed to symptomatic or \nconfirmed COVID-19 detainees; (b) effect social distancing for detainees during the intake process \n(and to suspend the use of bullpens during intake); (c) provide soap or hand sanitizer to detainees \nin quantities sufficient to permit frequent hand-cleaning, provide sanitation supplies sufficient to \npermit regular sanitization of surfaces on which the virus could be present, and establish a policy \nrequiring sanitization of frequently touched surfaces between uses (with compliance monitoring); \nand (d) provide facemasks to detainees who have been exposed to a symptomatic detainee. Doc. \nNo. 47 at 34-36.  \nSecond, as described above, that Order has failed to remedy the constitutional violation at \nissue in this case: the objectively unreasonable conditions of confinement that Plaintiffs are forced \nto  endure  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  outbreak  at  the  Cook  County  Jail.  18  U.S.C. \n§ 3626(a)(3)(A)(i); Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 514 (2011) (Section 3626(a)(3)(A)(i) “is \nsatisfied if the court has entered one order, and this single order has failed to remedy the \nconstitutional violation.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Sheriff has admitted that social \ndistancing, which the undisputed evidence establishes is necessary to protect Plaintiffs’ right to \nobjectively  reasonable  conditions  under  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  is  impossible  without \nreducing the population in custody at the Jail. Doc. No. 62 at 20. See Brown, 563 U.S. at 515 \n(holding that the three-judge panel was properly convened because, even though more recent \norders had been entered, the evidence did not “provide assurance that further, substantially similar \nefforts would yield success absent a population reduction”); see also Roberts v. County of \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 15 of 37 PageID #:1759\nMahoning, 495 F. Supp. 2d 694, 697 (N.D. Oh. 2006) (convening three-judge panel after finding \nby the court that it was “unlikely that the plan to maintain constitutional population levels at the \njail [would] be effective without . . . a prisoner release mechanism.”). \nFinally, the Sheriff has had a reasonable time to comply with this court’s orders under these \nunprecedented circumstances. As of the date of this filing, the Sheriff has had 10 days to comply \nwith the court’s TRO order. In ordinary times, the Sheriff might reasonably insist on more time \nfor compliance with changes in jail conditions. But as courts have acknowledged, “the status quo \nof a mere few weeks ago no longer applies. Our world has been altered with lightning speed, and \nthe results are both unprecedented and ghastly.” Thakker v. Doll, 2020 WL 1671563, at *9 (M.D. \nPa. Mar. 31, 2020). Each day the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country and the \nstate grows larger, and despite the Sheriff’s unilateral and unsupported assertion that COVID-19 \ncases at the Jail are under control, the medical and statistical evidence—including the 78.5% \npositive rate of detainees at the Jail who are being tested, Ex. C (Rasmussen-Torvik Decl.)—\nsuggests that the outbreak is far greater than the Sheriff claims, and the rate of infection remains \nuncontrolled. See also Doc. No. 55-4 (Ex. D to Pl.’s Mot. for Prelim. Inj.) at 6 (projecting that \n1,240 detainees will have contracted COVID-19 in one week’s time). \nIn these extraordinary times, with death and severe illness so imminent if social distancing \ndoes not immediately occur, 10 days is a “reasonable amount of time to comply” with this Court’s \norders for purposes of Section 3626(a)(3)(A)(ii). Coleman, 2020 WL 1675775, at *4 n.9 (“We \nrecognize that what is reasonable in ordinary times may be quite different from what is reasonable \nin these extraordinary times.”); id. at *9 (Mueller, C.J., concurring) (concurring that plaintiffs must \nseek precedent injunctive relief before a three-judge panel is convened, but emphasizing “the \navailability of expedited proceedings . . . to immediately exhaust” the precedent relief). \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 16 of 37 PageID #:1760\nIn sum, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that the conditions precedent to convening a three-\njudge panel are met. The situation is emergent, and the time for convening such a panel is now. \nB.  An Injunction Should Issue Mandating Social Distancing in the Jail. \nWhile the court is processing the request for a three-judge panel, it should simultaneously \norder the Sheriff to mandate all possible social distancing throughout the Jail. Social distancing is \nrequired to remedy the ongoing constitutional violation suffered by Plaintiffs. Nothing in the \nPLRA  prohibits  this  court  from  continuing  to  enter  remedial  orders  while  the  process  for \nconvening a three-judge panel is ongoing. To the contrary, the Supreme Court has determined that \nthe PLRA permits such an approach because a contrary reading of the statute “would in effect \nrequire district courts to impose a moratorium on new remedial orders before issuing a population \nlimit.” Brown, 563 U.S. at 516. So long as the Sheriff has had a reasonable time to comply with \nthe Court’s social-distancing order by the time a three-judge panel enters a prisoner release order \n(which, as explained above will be inherently satisfied given what constitutes a “reasonable time” \nin  these  extraordinary  circumstances  and  the  Sheriff’s  concession  regarding  its  ability  to \neffectively socially distance at the Jail with the current population), Section 3626’s requirements \nwill be satisfied. Id. \nAn injunction mandating social distancing would meet the need-narrowness-intrusiveness \ncriteria required by the PLRA. As discussed in Plaintiffs’ April 6 brief on the applicability of the \nPLRA to Plaintiffs’ requests for relief, Section 3626(a)(1)-(2) requires the Court to make findings \nthat any preliminary injunction orders are “narrowly drawn, extend no further than necessary to \ncorrect the harm the court finds requires preliminary relief, and be the least intrusive means \nnecessary to correct that harm.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2); Fields v. Smith, 653 F.3d 550, 558 (7th \nCir. 2011). The Court must also give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or \n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 17 of 37 PageID #:1761\nthe operation of a criminal justice system. Id. § 3626(a)(1). The need-narrowness-intrusiveness \ninquiry is case-specific, and “must be undertaken in light of both the magnitude of existing \nconstitutional violations and the available alternative remedies.” Morales Feliciano v. Rullan, 378 \nF.3d 42, 54 (1st Cir. 2004). \nIn this case, the evidence is clear and it is one-sided: social distancing is the only way to \nmeaningfully reduce rampant transmission of the virus inside the Jail. This Court’s prior, less \ndrastic, injunctive orders have not sufficed. Plata v. Schwarzenegger, 603 F.3d 1088, 1097-98 (9th \nCir. 2010) (affirming court’s injunctive order based, in part, on the failure of less intrusive \ninjunctive orders). The Sheriff’s own submission, arguing that he is objectively reasonable because \nhe has made efforts to implement social distancing, acknowledges that social distancing is required \nin order to protect detainees’ Fourteenth Amendment rights. Doc. No. 62 at 6; see also Braggs v. \nDunn, 383 F. Supp. 3d 1218, 1253 (M.D. Ala. 2019) (agreements between the parties are \n“compelling  evidence”  that  the  injunctive  relief  request  satisfies  the  need-narrowness-\nintrusiveness criteria). And the Sheriff has proposed no alternative relief that he contends would \nbe less intrusive or more narrowly tailored, suggesting that there is no other relief that would \nsuffice. Plata v. Schwarzenegger, 2008 WL 4847080, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 7, 2008) (noting that, \ndespite objecting to the proposed injunctive relief, “[d]efendants have not once—even in these \ncontempt proceedings—suggested any relief that would be less intrusive”).  \nThe Sheriff contends that the PLRA bars an order mandating social distancing because it \n“would impede the Sheriff’s ability to address security and medical issues that may arise.” Doc. \nNo. 62 at 12. But the Sheriff offers no support for or explanation of this contention. To the contrary, \nthe definition of social distancing proposed by Plaintiffs—an order requiring the Sheriff to permit \ndetainees to socially distance from one another by at least six feet, except in an emergency—will \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 18 of 37 PageID #:1762\nprovide all of the leeway necessary for the Sheriff and his employees to break up fights or escort \ndetainees for medical attention, as alluded to in the Sheriff’s brief. Id. \nAnd such an order could also permit the Sheriff to have maximum discretion in determining \nhow to effect social distancing, given the physical layout of the Jail, and the number of staff and \ndetainees. See Pierce v. County of Orange, 761 F. Supp. 2d 915, 947-48 (C.D. Cal. 2011) (“With \nregard to intrusiveness, the Court must take care not to enmesh [itself] in the minutiae of prison \noperations . . . and the Court satisfies the intrusiveness prohibition by ordering a defendant to draft \nand promulgate a plan, which leaves to the defendant discretion to determine the details of how to \ndeliver the relief ordered.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  \nIn sum, consistent with the PLRA, the court should (1) convene a three-judge panel \nimmediately and (2) enter an injunctive order at this time to require the Sheriff to implement and \nmaintain social distancing throughout the Jail. No further hearing is necessary on this question \nbecause the record is uncontested on the medical and scientific need for social distancing.  \nIII.  THE COURT MAY  ORDER  THE RELEASE  OF VULNERABLE  PRETRIAL \nDETAINEES THROUGH HABEAS CORPUS. \n \nPlaintiffs seek writs of habeas corpus for the members of subclass A—those who are \nparticularly vulnerable to COVID-19 because of their age or underlying medical problems. Elderly \nand medically vulnerable individuals are particularly in need of the court’s intervention. They are \nat heightened risk of contracting serious COVID-19 and experiencing excruciating illness when \nthey do. And yet, the Sheriff admits that he has yet even to identify them. In the Sheriff’s view, he \nis “under no constitutional obligation to affirmatively identify and ‘triage’ certain detainees based \non their health condition.” Doc. No. 62 at 23. This is untrue. When state officials “strip [prisoners] \nof virtually every means of self-protection and foreclose[] their access to outside aid, [they] are \nnot free to let the state of nature take its course.” Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 833 (1994). \n18 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 19 of 37 PageID #:1763\nFor the Sheriff to fail even to identify the vulnerable in his care in this time of crisis defies accepted \nmedical  correctional  standards  and  deviates  from  general  practice  for  correctional  facilities \nnationwide.15 Ex. A (Venters Decl.) ¶¶ 25, 28(b). \nBearing in mind the constitutional protections owed prisoners in the wake of the COVID \npandemic, federal courts across the country have granted emergency relief brought on behalf of \nvulnerable individuals in custody. See, e.g., Thakker, 2020 WL 1671563; Coronel v. Decker, ___ \nF.Supp.3d ___, 2020 WL 1487274 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2020); see also Basank, et al. v. Decker, et \nal., No. 20 C 2518, Doc. No. 11 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2020); Flores, et al. v. Barr, et al., No. 85 C \n4544, Doc. No. 740 (Mar. 28, 2020) (attached as Group Ex. E). The court in Thakker noted that \n“the status quo of a mere few weeks ago no longer applies. Our world has been altered with \nlightning speed, and the results are both unprecedented and ghastly . . . . The choice we now make \nmust reflect this new reality.” Thakker, 2020 WL 1671563, at *9. It held that even though the \n                                                 \n15   The Sheriff argues that it is impossible for his Office to identify the vulnerable under his current \nprocedures, since the health alerts placed on detainees (presumably at intake when detainees are screened \nby the Jail) do not provide specific medical information but only operational information related to \ndetainees’ health conditions. This procedural failure to share vital information between the Sheriff and his \ncontracted medical provider does not somehow prevent this court from ordering a remedy. Fundamentally, \na Sheriff cannot contract away his constitutional obligations to protect the medically vulnerable, for \ninstance, by shifting the onus of care to contracted healthcare entities. But see Doc. No. 62 at 24 (“Cermak \nHealth Service, the proper entity to monitor detainees with any medical issues, continues to provide full \ncare for all detainees at the Jail.”). See, e.g., Leach v. Shelby Cty. Sheriff, 891 F.2d 1241, 1250 (6th Cir. \n1989) (“[S]ince the Sheriff is here in his official capacity . . . the Sheriff is not excused from liability due \nto having contracted out the medical care.”). And the fact that Cermak, and not the Sheriff, may be the \nrelevant covered entity under HIPAA has no bearing at all on Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. In any event, \na court order mandating the identification of medically vulnerable individuals in the Jail cures any potential \nprivacy or regulatory objections. See National Abortion Federation v. Ashcroft, 2004 WL 292079, at *3 \n(N.D. Ill. Feb. 6, 2004) (citing 45 C.F .R. § 164.512(e)(1)(i)) (“HIPAA allows a hospital such as \nNorthwestern to disclose patient medical records subject to a court order.”); see also United States v. James, \n2007 WL 914242, at *30 (Mar. 21, 2007) (“[T]he government raises concerns concerning disclosure of \nthese records under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b) . . . and HIPAA regulations. However, the Staff \nAttorney for the Bureau of Prisons himself concedes that ‘a Court order is sufficient to overcome these \nobstacles,’ noting that such an Order ‘requires the Court to weigh the public interest in the information \nsought against the privacy interests affected by their release.’”). \n \n19 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 20 of 37 PageID #:1764\nconditions in the local federal detention facilities were not insufficient because of intent or malice, \n“should we fail to afford relief” to medically vulnerable prisoners “we will be a party to an \nunconscionable and possibly barbaric result.” Id.; see also id. (“Our Constitution and laws apply \nequally to the most vulnerable among us, particularly when matters of public health are at issue.”). \nThe district court accordingly granted a temporary restraining order requiring the immediate \nrelease of 11 prisoners in federal custody who suffered from chronic medical conditions and who \nfaced a serious threat of injury or death if exposed to COVID-19. Id. at 2, 24–25. \nHere, the members of subclass A should be released via writs of habeas corpus. The Sheriff \ndoes not quarrel with Plaintiffs’ ability, as a general matter, to seek habeas relief in a representative \naction. He does not challenge the reasoning of Bijeol v. Benson, 513 F.3d 965, 968 (7th Cir. 1975), \nwhich authorizes such an action. See also U.S. ex rel. Morgan v. Sielaff, 546 F.2d 218, 221 (7th \nCir. 1976); U.S. ex rel. Green v. Peters, 153 F.R.D. 615, 617 (N.D. Ill. 1994). Nor does the Sheriff \ndispute the proposition that habeas is an appropriate vehicle to litigate the question of whether a \nconfined person must be released because the conditions of his confinement are unconstitutional. \nSee, e.g., Glaus v. Anderson, 408 F.3d 382, 387 (7th Cir. 2005).  \nThe Sheriff opposes habeas relief for two reasons. First, he claims that a representative \nhabeas  action  in  this  particular  case  is  inappropriate  because  of  the  need  for  individual \ndeterminations of whether the release of each class member is warranted. Second, he urges \ndismissal of the habeas claim on the theory that, even those class members who availed themselves \nof the Judge Martin procedure should be barred by the exhaustion doctrine. Neither argument \ndefeats this habeas claim. \n \n \n20 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 21 of 37 PageID #:1765\nA.  The Common Questions in this Case Should Be Decided Together. \n \nThere is a set of common questions in this case that are well suited to resolution on a class \nwide basis.16 Fundamental among these questions is whether detainees in the Jail, as a matter of \ndue process, are entitled to an opportunity to practice social distancing consistent with those in the \ncommunity at large. There are a number of subsidiary questions: (1) what risks are associated with \nthe failure to socially distance in the Jail?; (2) what has been the effect, in terms of spread of the \ncoronavirus, of the Jail’s inability to provide social distance for detainees and Jail staff?; (3) to \nwhat extent can the remedy of release reduce risk of serious illness or death for detainees, staff \nand the public?; (4) are there improvements to the conditions in the Jail, short of enabling social \ndistancing, that might be sufficient to comport with due process?  \n                                                 \n16   It is unclear whether the Sheriff’s contentions regarding the unsuitability of the case to class \nresolution are intended to apply only to Plaintiffs’ habeas claim or whether those arguments are directed \nagainst the Section 1983 claims as well. If the latter, they would also fail for the reasons stated in this \nsection and an additional reason: the “inherently individualized” process the Sheriff references will not \nplay into this Court’s factual findings or legal conclusions on the Section 1983 claims. This is a textbook \nprison-conditions class action in which Plaintiffs challenge the circumstances under which they are \nconfined. Claims challenging jail-wide conditions are paradigmatic class actions. See Postawko v. \nMissouri Dep’t of Corr., 2017 WL 3185155, at *14 (W.D. Mo. July 26, 2017), aff'd, 910 F.3d 1030 (8th \nCir. 2018) (citing 1 H. Newberg & A. Conte, Newberg on Class Actions § 4.34 (5th ed. 2016 update)) \n(“For example, if a prisoner in a prison conditions lawsuit secures a ruling that a prison policy violates the \nConstitution, the court-ordered injunctive relief will necessarily apply to all other prisoners.”); Id. (citing \nCharles Alan Wright, et al., 7AA Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 1776 (3d ed. 2017 update)) (“[I]t should be \nnoted that a common use of Rule 23(b)(2) is in prisoner actions brought to challenge various practices or \nrules in the prisons on the ground that they violate the constitution. For example, Rule 23(b)(2) class \nactions have been utilized to challenge prison policies or procedures alleged to . . . violate the prisoners’ \nEighth Amendment rights to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.”); see also Holmes v. Godinez, \n311 F.R.D. 177, 219 (N.D. Ill. 2015) (granting class certification in prison-conditions case “is consistent \nwith numerous other courts that have found, after Wal-Mart, that the commonality requirement was met \nin cases where prisoners alleged system-wide practices and/or failures resulting in constitutional and \nstatutory violations” and collecting cases). And if indeed this case proceeds to a three-judge court and \nrelease is determined to be necessary, a class action again is appropriate and perhaps even mandatory. A \nresulting order will require the Sheriff to reduce the population in his custody, and he can choose whom \nto release; the court will not be asked to resolve a single individualized question regarding health or \nsafety. See Brown, 563 U.S. at 502 (2011). \n \n21 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 22 of 37 PageID #:1766\nThese  are  complicated  factual  questions.  The  record  of  this  case  already  includes \nvoluminous evidence regarding conditions in the Jail, the nature and scope of the Jail’s response \nto the pandemic, medical and epidemiological evaluations of the quality and effect of the Jail’s \nresponse and, more broadly, the threat posed by the coronavirus and the interventions that will \nmitigate spread, among other things. All of this evidence is necessary to “generate common \nanswers” to the question of whether due process permits the vulnerable members of subclass A to \nremain in the Jail. Wal-Mart v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 360 (2011).  \nMoreover, there are critical common legal issues, such as the availability of habeas corpus \nas a remedy when immediate circumstances render it impossible to safely confine a person; the \napplicability of the exhaustion doctrine to the subclass’s claims under the circumstances; and the \nconstitutional merits of whether it is “objectively unreasonable” for a medically vulnerable person \nto be exposed on an ongoing basis to a serious risk of contracting a potentially deadly virus. \nThe Sheriff would prefer scores of individual habeas petitions in which the declarations, \nthe medical and epidemiological expertise, and the Jail records would be separately assembled (if, \nindeed, each of the individual class members individually had the resources to do so) and then \nwould be evaluated separately for each class member. The process would not just be massively \nwasteful and cumbersome; it would needlessly risk the safety of class members, jail staff, and the \npublic as the virus continues to spread while different judges are forced to churn through the same \ncomplex and voluminous material. It would also require the Sheriff and his lawyers to separately \nbrief the same dispositive legal issues before several courts, each of which may come to different \nlegal conclusions. \n Clearly, the preferable approach is class-wide resolution of the factual and legal questions \non which the due process rights of the members of subclass A depend. To be sure, there are \n22 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 23 of 37 PageID #:1767\nindividual questions that bear on the circumstances and conditions under which the members of \nthe class would be released: individuals with documented exposure to COVID-19 should be \nreleased with assurance that they will be medically monitored and will socially isolate; individuals \nwhose charges and/or criminal backgrounds suggest public safety concerns should be released \nsubject to conditions, such as electronic monitoring; individuals at particularly elevated risk of \ncontracting serious COVID-19 should be prioritized for prompt release. \nThese questions can and should appropriately be resolved via brief, individual proceedings. \nSuch an approach—class-wide determination of the broad, central legal and factual questions that \ndrive  the  class’s  entitlement  to  relief  followed  by  individual  assessments  of  the  particular \nremedy—have  long  been  commonplace  in  class  litigation.  See,  e.g.,  Barnes  v.  District  of \nColumbia, 278 F.R.D. 14, 18 (D.D.C. 2011) (approving class action where liability and “general” \ndamages were to be resolved on class-wide basis but individual damages may remain); Dunn v. \nCity of Chicago, 231 F.R.D. 367, 370 (N.D. Ill. 2005) (same). It is therefore appropriate for \nPlaintiffs’ habeas claim to proceed on a class wide basis. \nB.  The Habeas Claim Is Not Barred by the Exhaustion Doctrine. \nPlaintiff Foster availed himself of the special bond review procedure that Judge Martin \nestablished in response to the pandemic. He was denied relief. The Sheriff nonetheless insists that \nFoster did not sufficiently exhaust State remedies because he did not pursue “reconsideration” or \nappeal of the ruling denying reduction of the financial conditions of his pretrial release made in \nhis case on April 2. The argument should be rejected. \nPlaintiffs have provided uncontested facts demonstrating the futility in this emergency \ncontext of pursuing the full panoply of available appeals with respect to an unsuccessful motion \nfor bond review. An appeal pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 604(c) takes time to prepare \n23 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 24 of 37 PageID #:1768\nand for the Appellate Court to consider; such claims will not be resolved for weeks. See Doc. No. \n55 at 15; Doc. No. 55-3 (Decl. of Lester Finkle). With the death toll from COVID-19 climbing \nhourly and daily, these appellate remedies are not available in practice to the medically vulnerable \nwhose risk is ongoing and escalating.  \nThis court based its April 9 ruling on Plaintiff Foster having made “no effort to initiate” \nthe special Judge Martin bail review procedure. Plaintiffs have corrected the record; Foster did \ninitiate the procedure, and was denied. The Sheriff offers no argument to refute Plaintiffs’ \ndemonstration that appeals and petitions to the Illinois Appellate and Supreme Courts would entail \ndelay that would necessarily force Foster to suffer at length the very constitutional violation he \nseeks to avoid. The Sheriff does not dispute the factual or legal demonstration Plaintiffs have made \non this point in their earlier filings. See Doc. No. 62 at 6-7. \nThe  Sheriff’s  argument  inadvertently  highlights  an  independent  dispositive  point  on \nexhaustion: the state court “bond review” proceedings are not a forum in which to decide the \nfederal claim brought by class members in this case. In addition to the practical inability to offer \nthe kind of evidentiary record requiring release as a matter of due process in an individual state-\ncourt bond review hearing, there is a more central legal obstacle to doing so: Illinois statutory law \ngoverning bail provides consideration of 37 factors when determining conditions of pretrial \nrelease; a detainee’s medical health is not one of them. 725 ILCS 5/110-5. Whatever the public \nhealth  impetus  behind  Judge  Martin  convening  special  proceedings  to  reconsider  financial \nconditions of release, those proceedings (and any appeals that flow from them) were neither \nrequired nor expected to rule on medical conditions inside the jail.  \nThe Sheriff himself makes the crucial point. He explains that state court defendants like \nFoster were denied reduction in monetary bond because “the assessment of risk to the public \n24 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 25 of 37 PageID #:1769\nevidently outweighed any perceived risk to their health.” Doc. 62 at 25. Thus, the Sheriff concedes, \nthe state court applied Illinois law to reject pretrial release (or reduced monetary bond) based on \nfactors other than medical need, such as predictions of a person’s future dangerousness. Id. That \nis the essential legal difference between the legal questions decided in the state court bond hearing \nand the federal habeas proceedings here: even if a person proved in a state court bond proceeding \nthat the jail poses unreasonable risk to their health, the state court may still weigh the Illinois state \nlaw factors and order pretrial detention in the County Jail.  \nBut that is not the case for Foster’s claims in this court. For the due process claims brought \nin this federal case, the remedy is categorical: if Foster proves that his ongoing detention inside \nthe Cook County Jail is a serious and unreasonable risk to his health and life, then habeas relief \nwill ultimately be granted. Whether the Sheriff chooses to release him from the Cook County Jail \nto lockdown at a local hotel, to electronic home confinement, or with other conditions that the \nCourt deems reasonable, some form of release from his custody would be required if a medically \nvulnerable person prevails on his federal due process claim that pretrial detention threatens his life \nunder current conditions in the Cook County Jail.  \nThus, for the purposes of the unique, narrow due process claim raised here, even if \nexhaustion of the existing state court procedures were not futile because of their timing (which it \nis), the Sheriff agrees that the state court is actually not legally competent—much less required—\nto resolve that freestanding federal question in the context of following the Illinois bond statute. \nC.  This  Court  Should  Also  Exercise  Its  Authority  to  Release  Medically \nVulnerable  Subclass  Members  on  Unsecured  or  Non-Monetary  Bail \nConditions Pending Review of Their Request for Habeas Relief Under § 2241. \n \nCourts of equity operate with flexibility, especially in emergencies of great consequence. \nPlaintiffs recognize the unprecedented nature of this request for federal habeas relief for Foster \n25 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 26 of 37 PageID #:1770\nand the other medically vulnerable people confined with him. But the events unfolding around us \nare unprecedented. This court has the power to protect the lives and constitutional rights of the \nsubclass. Foster sets forth below how this Court could vindicate these rights in practical terms. \nFirst, in the TRO context, the Court must weigh the “public interest” in vindicating the \nconstitutional rights at issue, Lawson Prods., Inc. v. Avnet, Inc., 782 F.2d 1429, 1433 (7th Cir. \n1986), and so the court could order immediate release of certain categories of subclass members \ntemporarily, even if concluding that public safety precluded the emergency release of other \nsubclass members.  \nSecond, a federal court has the authority to grant bail to habeas petitioners who are properly \nbefore it. See Cherek v. United States, 767 F.2d 335, 337 (7th Cir. 1985) (holding that, even in \npost-conviction habeas proceedings that involve those already convicted of state offenses, “federal \ndistrict judges in habeas corpus and Section 2255 proceedings have inherent power to admit \napplicants to bail pending the decision.”); Bolante v. Keisler, 506 F.3d 618, 620 (7th Cir. 2007) \n(“Inherent judicial authority to grant bail to persons who have asked for relief in an application for \nhabeas corpus is a natural incident of habeas corpus, the vehicle by which a person questions the \ngovernment’s right to detain him.”); Swanson v. United States, 2016 WL 5422048, at *1 (C.D. Ill. \nSept. 28, 2016) (granting bail pending Section 2255 proceedings).  \nAs least in post-conviction proceedings where principles of comity and finality are at their \nzenith, to be released on bail pending habeas review the petitioner must demonstrate a high \nprobability of success on the merits and “extraordinary or exceptional circumstances … which \nmake the grant of bail necessary to make the habeas remedy effective.” Swanson, 2016 WL \n5422048, at *1; see also Abdullah v. Obama, 753 F.3d 193 (D.C. Cir. 2014); Landano v. Rafferty, \n970 F.2d 1230, 1239 (3d Cir. 1992); cf. Johnston v. Marsh, 227 F.2d 528, 529-32 (3d Cir. 1955) \n26 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 27 of 37 PageID #:1771\n(finding that a district court had the power to grant of bail pending habeas consideration where the \npetitioner, “an advanced diabetic, was, under conditions of confinement, rapidly progressing \ntoward total blindness,” comparing this authority to a judge’s power to issue a “stay of execution” \nwhile a petition is pending). Under this “exceptional circumstances” evaluation, courts also \nconsider a person’s characteristics. See, e.g., Swanson, 2016 WL 5422048, at *1 (finding that \npetitioner was a “good candidate for bond”). \nBased on these considerations, a federal court for the District of Massachusetts has released \n(and continues to release) numerous civil immigration detainees on non-monetary bond conditions \nwhile their class action habeas petition is pending. See Savino v. Souza, 2020 WL 1703844, at *8-\n9 (Apr. 8, 2020) (explaining its decision to grant bail pending habeas). In that case, named \npetitioners  and  class  members  include  all  immigration  detainees  held  at  two  facilities  in \nMassachusetts. Id. at *1. The Savino petitioners seek habeas relief because those facilities are too \ncramped and unsanitary to protect them from contracting COVID-19. Id. at *1-3.17 Finding \n“extraordinary circumstances” in “this nightmarish pandemic,” the court opted to “diligently \nentertain[] bail applications while the petitions for habeas corpus are pending.” Id. at *9. The \ndistrict court requested and rapidly considered an initial list of 50 detainees for bail, and has since \nconsidered class members’ bail applications in groups of 10. Order, Savino v. Souza, No. 20-\n10617-WGY, Doc. No. 44, at 3 (Apr. 4, 2020); see id., Doc. No. 45 at 1-3 (listing class members \nin groups of 10 for bail consideration); id., Doc. No.77 at 1-3 (Apr. 10, 2020) (same) (attached as \nGroup Ex. F). On April 15, 2020, the Court denied the government’s request to stay the releases. \nIn its Order, the Court explained: “We are in the midst of a pandemic unprecedented in our lifetime. \n. . . [T]he Court will continue, on an individual basis, to work through the difficult issues of bail \n                                                 \n17   Unlike in this case, the Savino class is not limited to detainees who are medically vulnerable. \nSavino, No. 20-10617-WGY, 2020 WL 1703844, at *1. \n27 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 28 of 37 PageID #:1772\nin the present crisis. . . . Moreover, compelling issues of individual, institutional, and community \nhealth preclude the luxury of a stay so counsel can ‘consider their appellate options.’” Doc. No. \n86 at 1-3 (Apr. 15, 2020). \nOther courts have also found that the risks imposed by COVID-19 warranted release on \nbail while a habeas action was pending. See Avendano Hernandez v. Decker, 2020 WL 1547459, \nat *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2020) (releasing § 2241 habeas petitioner challenging unconstitutional \nconditions of confinement—“specifically, continued risk of exposure to COVID-19”—because his \ncontinued detention would expose him to the infection he seeks habeas relief to avoid and, thus, \n“immediately release [wa]s necessary to ‘make the habeas remedy effective’” (quoting Mapp, 241 \nF.3d at 230)); Jiminez v. Wolf, No. 18-10225-MLW, Doc. No. 507-1 at 3-4 (D. Mass. Mar. 26, \n2020) (concluding that release of habeas petitioner on bail was “necessary to … make the habeas \nremedy effective” because “we’re living in the midst of a coronavirus pandemic,” “being in a jail \nenhances risk,” and “[i]f the petitioner is infected and dies …. [t]he habeas remedy will be \nineffective”).  \nHere too, this court could exercise equitable flexibility. For example, the court could \nrelease on bail every medically vulnerable pretrial detainee charged with an offense that does not \nhave as an element the use or threatened use of violence or unwanted sexual touching of another \nperson. Similarly, the court could release every pretrial detainee who would be eligible for release \nif they paid $10,000 or less. Both of these filters would aid the Sheriff in achieving the social \ndistancing required (and may avert the need for the three-judge tribunal to act), and both are very \nreasonable proxies for public safety under these extraordinary circumstances. The Sheriff does not \neven attempt to justify why Foster is so dangerous that he must be detained when any person could \nwalk to a Cook County window, hand over $5,000, and Foster would be released immediately.   \n28 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 29 of 37 PageID #:1773\nThe court could also order that any and all non-financial conditions of release already \nordered by a state court in any person’s case remain the same. This approach would help ensure \nthat any intrusion on state court proceedings is minimal and targeted only at terminating pretrial \ndetention of presumptively innocent people in dangerous conditions. Indeed, this court could even \nconvert the secured bail amount to an unsecured bond amount, meaning that the same financial \ncondition of release remains in each person’s case, but merely removing the obligation to pay \nprior to release. See ODonnell v. Harris Cty., Texas, 251 F. Supp. 3d 1052, 1144 (S.D. Tex. 2017), \naff'd as modified sub nom. ODonnell v. Harris Cty., 892 F.3d 147 (5th Cir. 2018) (“[T]he record \nevidence shows that secured money bail is not more effective at increasing the likelihood of \nappearance or law-abiding behavior before trial than release on an unsecured or nonfinancial \ncondition.”). \nThese proxies and solutions are neither perfect nor common in federal court habeas cases, \nbut these are extraordinary times and petitioners lives are at stake.  \nIV.  THE COURT MAY ORDER THE TRANSFER OF SOME DETAINEES TO A \nSAFE LOCATION WITHIN THE SHERIFF’S CUSTODY. \n \nIt would also be proper for this court, on the present record and without need for a further \nhearing, to enter an order directing the Sheriff to transfer detainees who have been exposed to the \ncoronavirus (the subclass B Plaintiffs) to “a safe facility or form of custody of [the sheriff’s] \nchoosing.” Doc. No. 55 at 15.  \nThat transfer could be to any safe location in which the detainee may remain confined \nwithin the Sheriff’s custody, including, for instance, to another correctional space, a hospital or \nmedical  facility,  a  clinic,  home  confinement,  administrative  furlough,  or  electronic  home \nmonitoring. Such an order would not require the release of any detainee and therefore would not \ninvolve the three judge panel procedure of Section 3626(a)(3)(A). \n29 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 30 of 37 PageID #:1774\nThe Sheriff states that transfer outside the Jail would be “widely impractical if not \nimpossible.” Doc. No. 61 at 9. To the contrary, the Sheriff is empowered under the County Jail \nAct to transfer detainees—including to home confinement—in a health emergency. See Doc. No. \n26-1 (Pls.’ Resp. to Court’s Apr. 3 Order) at 19; Doc. No. 42 (Pls.’ Suppl. Br. in Support of TRO) \nat 17-19 (discussing County Jail Act, 730 ILCS 125/14, and how electronic monitoring constitutes \nconfinement in accordance with the statutory mandate).  \nUsing this authority, the Sheriff has previously opened clinical facilities in the County, in \norder to house detainees who the Sheriff believed were better suited to detention outside the \nphysical Jail plant. For example, in 2015, the Sheriff began operating a mental health clinic in the \nsouth suburbs of Cook County. The clinic, run in collaboration with Adler Community Health \nServices, served as a transfer site for mentally ill detainees in the jail (without court order). The \nSheriff has also historically run a program of administrative furlough, by which detainees remain \nin the Sheriff’s custody but outside the walls of the Jail. See People v. Campa, 353 Ill.App.3d 178, \n179-80 (1st Dist. 2004) (detainee was “in custody” of Sheriff for purposes of Illinois’ speedy trial \nstatute, where detainee was placed by the Sheriff on “the Cook County Department of Corrections \nadministrative furlough, and the Department of Community Supervision and Intervention, Day \nReporting Program”); People v. Smith, 2014 IL App (3d) 130548,   27 (noting that detainee who \nwas admitted into Sheriff’s day reporting program was subject to ¶lesser protection than detainee \nreleased on bond on home monitoring; as Sheriff had no need to obtain a warrant prior to \ndefendant's re-arrest, there was no way to challenge selection of defendants for entry into Sheriff’s \nprogram, and defendant “must simply adhere to the sheriff's unilaterally imposed conditions of \nparticipation.”). Electronic  monitoring,  furlough,  and  the  use  of  outside  facilities  to  house \n30 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 31 of 37 PageID #:1775\ndetainees are all available transfers that the Sheriff could employ. They are neither impractical nor \nimpossible.  \n  Plaintiffs’ transfer request also meets the requirements of the PLRA. First, and contrary to \nDefendant’s claims, Doc. No. 61 at 9, there is a clear fit between the violations at stake (the \nexposure of incarcerated individuals to conditions of confinement that threaten their health and \nsafety), and the requested remedy (an order requiring the Sheriff transfer prisoners from the \nphysical facility where those conditions exist). See Doc. No. 26-1 at 24-25.  \nSecond, there is no evidence that transfer would have an adverse impact on public safety. \nThe Sheriff claims that ordering more detainees on electronic monitoring “would have the risk of \noverloading the Sheriff’s electronic monitoring system,” which would thereby endanger the public. \nDoc. No. 61 at 11. But since Plaintiffs have not requested that all or indeed any of the transfers be \ndone via electronic home monitoring, the Sheriff retains leeway to address any operational \nconcerns in the implementation of the requested court order (for instance, by initiating transfers to \nother facilities or using administrative furlough).  \nThird, as made clear in prior briefing, based on the statutory construction of the PLRA, the \nstatute’s legislative history, and the practical effect of the requested relief, a transfer in which \ndetainees  remain  in  the  Sheriff’s  custody  is  not  a  prisoner  release  order  under  18  U.S.C. \n§ 3626(a)(3). See Doc. No. 26-1 at 20-23; Doc. No. 55 at 16-17. This is true even where the effect \nof the order is to reduce the prison population. See Plata v. Brown, 2013 WL 3200587, at *8 (N.D. \nCal. June 24, 2013); Doe, No. 91-187 (Doc. No. 26-3) at 10-12; Reaves v. Dep’t of Correction, \n404 F. Supp. 3d 520, 523 (D. Mass. 2019); see also Gray v. County of Riverside, Doc. No. 56 at \n4-5 (recently recognizing that an order directing a sheriff to transfer detainees to a safer location \n31 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 32 of 37 PageID #:1776\nis not a \"prisoner release order\" and therefore not subject to the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § \n3626(a)(3)). \nThe Sheriff’s cited case of United States v. Cook County, 761 F. Supp. 2d 794 (N.D. Ill. \n2000) does not suggest otherwise. There, a three-judge panel ordered the release of detainees from \nthe Jail to address the facility’s “excess population” after finding that overcrowding was the \n“primary cause of unconstitutional conditions at the Jail.” Id. at 796, 797 (interpreting 18 U.S.C. \n§ 3626(a)(3)(E)(i)). Population cap litigation, stemming from capacity overcrowding (as in Cook \nCounty), was what motivated the drafters of the PRLA to circumscribe relief available to prisoners \nin overpopulated facilities by instituting the three-judge panel requirements. See Doc. No. 26-1 at \n20-23. The statute was not designed to limit remedies available to address violations that were not \nexplicitly related to population caps, like those presented here. See id.; see also Plata, 2013 WL \n3200587, at *9 (“[A]dopting Defendants’ interpretation of ‘prisoner release order’ would mean \nthat  a  court  could  only  order  that  prisoners  be  transferred  from  one  prison  to  another  if \novercrowding were the primary cause of the violation of those prisoners’ rights, and not if any \nother reason were causing the violation. Defendants have failed to point to anything in the \nlegislative history that indicates an intent to limit the protection of inmates’ constitutional rights \nin this manner . . . .”). \nFourth and finally, the PLRA does not limit where a prisoner may be transferred while \nremaining in a warden’s custody. Citing Plata, the Sheriff states that transfer is only permitted \nunder the PLRA to another jail facility. Doc. No. 61 at 10-11. But the statute has no such \nrequirement. The plaintiff in Reaves, for instance, won transfer to a non-correctional hospital on \nthe same grounds as the Plata plaintiffs. Reaves was in keeping with other judicial orders finding \nthat a person constitutes a “prisoner” even outside the four walls of the prison building, where she \n32 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 33 of 37 PageID #:1777\notherwise remains in custodial confinement. See Jackson v. Johnson, 475 F.3d 261, 265-66 (5th \nCir. 2007) (holding that a person subjected to confinement in a halfway house counts as a \n“prisoner” under the PLRA ) (“[A]lthough Jackson has been released from confinement in prison, \nhis release was not to the general public but was rather to a different form of confinement, albeit \nwith certain additional liberties. It is clear that Jackson is being ‘detained in any facility’ since he \nis locked up in the halfway house 16 to 24 hours a day and since he may leave the halfway house \nonly for very limited purposes.” (citing Witzke v. Femal, 376 F.3d 744, 752 (7th Cir. 2004) \n(determining that halfway-house resident who could leave the facility only during the day and was \nlocked inside at night was confined for PLRA purposes)). \nPlaintiffs seek a remedy for subclass B that allows the continued confinement of class \nmembers, but outside the physical plant of the Jail, which is so hazardous to their health and well-\nbeing. \nV.  EVEN  AS  NECESSARY  DETAINEE  RELEASES  ARE  IN  PROCESS,  THE \nCOURT SHOULD CONVERT THE APRIL 9 ORDER TO A PRELIMINARY \nINJUNCTION (OR EXTEND THE TRO), AND CONTINUE TO ENFORCE IT. \n \n  Release from the Jail of the medically vulnerable and to permit social distancing is the \nessential  remedy  to  cure  the  violations  here,  as  Plaintiffs  have  explained  above.  But  the \nrequirements of the court’s April 9 Order must remain in force to protect the health and well-being \nof all those who will necessarily remain incarcerated in the Jail.  \nThe Order has made a difference in how the Jail operates, as evidenced by the Sheriff’s \ncompliance report, particularly as to intake procedures, Doc. No. 51 at 2-7, and by the declarations \non behalf of detainees from April 14 onward. It was only after the entry of the Order that detainees \nbegan receiving free soap, some cleaning supplies and facemasks in most tiers. Ex. D (Detainee \nDecl.).  \n33 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 34 of 37 PageID #:1778\n  There is also evidence that the Sheriff is not in full compliance with the Order. First, there \nis a reason to doubt that all symptomatic detainees are being tested for COVID-19, as the court’s \norder required. Given the high positive rate and the Sheriff’s own published numbers, the answer \nis almost certainly no. Ex. C (Rasmussen-Torvik Decl.) ¶ 4 (“Per the Cook County Sheriff's \nwebsite on April 18, it appears that cumulatively 445 detainees have been tested for COVID-19 \nand 350 have tested positive—a positive test result rate of over 78%. . . . Michael Ryan, executive \ndirector of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, stated that “If 80-90% of the people test \npositive, you are probably missing a lot of cases[.]”). And no one who is living in quarantine is \nbeing tested, by the Sheriff’s own admission. Doc. No. 51 at 12. Detainee declarations further \ndemonstrate the Jail’s failure to provide testing even to symptomatic detainees. Ex. D. In this \nregard, it is notable that since March 22, the Sheriff has tested a total of 445 detainees,18 for an \naverage of 17.8 detainees per day. By contrast, since at least April 7, the Sheriff appears to have \nbeen testing 100 Sheriff’s employees per day, on a first-come, first-served basis.19 \nSecond, while many detainees speak of receiving soap, many simultaneously profess a lack \nof cleaning supplies for individual cells, the use of watered down bleach for the common areas, \nand a lack of compliance and monitoring as to whether areas are in fact being cleaned. Ex. D. \nThird, other components of the Sheriff’s COVID response are troubling; for example, \ndetainees report that Division 4, where many have been moved, appears not to have been lived in \nfor years, is filthy, there are limited cleaning supplies, and it has no heat. Indeed, although water \n                                                 \n18   See https://www.cookcountysheriff.org/covid-19-cases-at-ccdoc/ (last visited Apr. 19, 2020) (171 \npositive tests, 176 detainees in “recovery,” 3 deaths, and 95 negative tests). \n19   See April 6, 2020 Email from “CCSO Administration” to “Cook County Sheriff's Employees” \n(“The Sheriff is pleased to announce that . . . the CCDOC is now able to serve as a testing site. . . . . is \navailable to all CCSO staff. . . . The first 100 people will be tested. Additionally, testing of 100 staff will \ncontinue each day until everyone that wants to be tested has had the opportunity.”). Doc.

No. 55-1, but with further refinements. The Sheriff’s response brief has changed the state of \nplay in some key respects. Since the Sheriff is not contesting that social distancing is impossible \nin the Jail, Plaintiffs no longer seek updates of the exhibits to the Michael Miller declaration, or a \ndeposition from Michael Miller.  \nTo address ongoing compliance with the April 9 Order, Plaintiffs seek the following: \n•  An inspection by a corrections expert to assess the condition of the tiers to which \ndetainees are being moved (and which were previously closed because of poor \nconditions), the actual regimen of cleaning, and the provision of supplies; \n \n•  CCTV video from various tiers, which Plaintiffs understand is digitally available, \nto provide real time evidence of what is happening on the ground as to cleaning and \ntier conditions; \n \n•  A deposition of Dr. Menella, for the limited purpose of ascertaining how many total \ntests have been administered to detainees since the outbreak of the pandemic, the \nparameters that render a detainee “symptomatic” such that he is eligible for testing \nby Cermak, how convalescence is defined by Cermak and the Sheriff, and how \nmany detainees are hospitalized in the Jail, as opposed to at Stroger, and the general \ncondition of the detainees who are in each medical facility, see Ex.

HOMER VENTERS \nI, Dr. Homer Venters, hereby declare the following under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1746: \n1.  I am a physician, internist and epidemiologist with over a decade of experience in \nproviding, improving and leading health services for incarcerated people. My clinical training \nincludes residency training in internal medicine at the Albert Einstein/Montefiore Medical \nCenter (2007) and a fellowship in public health research at the New York University School of \nMedicine (2009). My experience in correctional health includes two years visiting detention \ncenters and conducting analyses of physical and mental health policies and procedures for \npersons detained in federal facilities. This work included and resulted in collaboration with \nfederal detention administrators on numerous individual cases of medical release, formulation of \nhealth-related policies, and testimony before U.S. Congress regarding mortality inside detention \nfacilities.  \n2.  After my fellowship training, I became the Deputy Medical Director of the New \nYork City Jail Correctional Health Service. This position included both direct care to persons \nheld in NYC’s 12 jails, as well as oversight of medical policies for their care. This role included \noversight of chronic care, sick call, specialty referral and emergency care. \n3.  I subsequently was promoted to the positions of Medical Director, Assistant \nCommissioner, and Chief Medical Officer of NYC Jail Correctional Health Services.  We \noperated one of the largest correctional health care systems in the nation, with over 43,000 \nannual admissions in jails across the city. In the latter two roles, I was responsible for all aspects \nof health services including physical and mental health, addiction, quality improvement, re-entry, \nmorbidity and mortality reviews, as well as all training and oversight of physicians, nursing and \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-2 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 3 of 32 PageID #:1785\npharmacy staff. In these roles, I was also responsible for evaluating and making \nrecommendations on the health implications of numerous security policies and practices.  \n4.  During this time, I managed multiple communicable disease outbreaks in our \nfacilities, including H1N1 in 2009, which impacted almost one third of housing areas inside the \nadolescent jail, multiple seasonal influenza outbreaks, a recurrent legionella infection and several \nother smaller outbreaks. To manage all of these outbreaks, I worked closely with management at \nthe facilities, including security and health staff, developed policies and procedures to manage \nthe outbreaks, and oversaw training and implementation of those policies and procedures. \nCentral aspects of my roles in these outbreak responses included the identification and protection \nof high-risk patient cohorts, development of infection control plans that integrated all levels of \nstaff and detained people in mitigating the impact of the outbreak. I also led inspections of \nhousing areas with teams of health, security, engineering and hygiene experts and developed and \nconducted orientations and trainings for correctional staff, health professionals and detained \npeople. I also developed data dashboards that were updated on a daily basis and shared with local \nand state public health partners to integrate jail outbreak management with community efforts.    \n5.  In March 2017, I left Correctional Health Services of NYC to become the \nDirector of Programs for Physicians for Human Rights. In this role, I oversaw all programs of \nPhysicians for Human Rights, including training of physicians, judges and law enforcement staff \non forensic evaluation and documentation, analysis of mass graves and mass atrocities, \ndocumentation of torture and sexual violence, and analysis of attacks against healthcare workers.  \n6.  In December 2018, I became the Senior Health and Justice Fellow for Community \nOriented Correctional Health Services (COCHS), a nonprofit organization that promotes \nevidence-based improvements to correctional practices across the U.S. In January 2020, I \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-2 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 4 of 32 PageID #:1786\nbecame the president of COCHS. I also work as a medical expert in cases involving correctional \nhealth and I wrote a book on the health risks of jail (Life and Death in Rikers Island) which was \npublished in early 2019 by Johns Hopkins University Press. A copy of my curriculum vitae is \nattached to this report, which includes my publications, a list of cases in which I have been \ninvolved and a statement of my compensation. \n7.  Since January 2020, I have been engaged in numerous activities in response to \nCOVID-19 infection in detention settings. I have published two articles on COVID-19 behind \nbars1 and participated in over 70 interviews on the need for systematic and evidence-based \npractices in jails, prisons and other detention settings to both prevent deaths among incarcerated \npeople, and flatten the overall outbreak curve in in the community from COVID-19.2 I am also \nscheduled to conduct a court-ordered inspection of the Metropolitan Detention Center in \nBrooklyn NY, which is in the throws of a COVID-19 outbreak and provide my findings to the \ncourt. I was invited by the National Association of Counties and Fair and Just Prosecution, a \nnational convening of elected prosecutors, The Stanford Law School and the University of \nSouthern California School of Medicine to provide guidance on COVID-19 response in detention \nsettings, and I have provided similar guidance on multiple other webinars and presentations.  \n                                                            \n1 Dr. Homer Venters, “4 ways to protect our jails and prisons from coronavirus,” The Hill (Feb. 29, 2020), \nhttps://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/485236-4-ways-to-protect-our-jails-and-prisons-from-\ncoronavirus; Dr. Homer Venters, “Coronavirus behind bars: 4 priorities to save the lives of prisoners,” \nThe Hill (Mar. 23, 2020), https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/488802-coronavirus-behind-bars-4-\npriorities-to-save-the-lives-of-prisoners. \n2 For example: Jean Casella& Katie Rose Quandt, “US jails will become death traps in the coronavirus \npandemic,” The Guardian (Mar. 30, 2020), \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/jails-coronavirus-us-rikers-island; Erin \nDoherty & Kelly Cannon, “‘We need help’: Inmates describe prison system unprepared for coronavirus,” \nABC News (Apr. 5, 2020), https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/inmates-describe-prison-system-unprepared-\ncoronavirus/story?id=69980790. \n  3 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-2 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 5 of 32 PageID #:1787\n8.  I have been retained by counsel for the plaintiffs in this case to provide opinions \nabout the actions that should be taken at the Cook County Jail in light of the current COVID-19 \noutbreak. As part of my work in this case, I have been provided the following documents: \n•  Amended Sanitation Policy \n•  Referral for Medical Care Policy \n•  Outbreak Prevention Policy \n•  CCSO Operational Briefing 4/4/20 \n•  Sanitation Plans \n•  Intake Photos \n•  Declarations of Concetta Menella (2), Rebecca Levin, Henriette Gratteau, \nMichael Miller, Ronald Lankah, Patricia Horne, Elizabeth Scannell, \nSonjourner Colbert, Matthew Burke, Jane Gubser, Brad Curry (2), and Peter \nOrris \n•  Plaintiff’s Complaint and Exhibits \n•  Sheriff’s 4/6/20 Response to the Plaintiff’s Emergency Motion and Exhibits \n•  Sheriff’s 4/13/20 Status Report and Exhibits \n•  Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Exhibits \n•  4/15/20 Hearing Transcript \n \nAll of the opinions set forth in this declaration are offered to a reasonable degree to medical \ncertainty based on my training, experience, and review of the relevant literature, and national and \ninternational data and guidance. \n9.  Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral pandemic.3  This is a novel \nvirus for which there is no established curative medical treatment and no vaccine. COVID-19 is \ndifferent than all previous infectious disease outbreaks faced in our lifetime because of the speed \nand extent of spread throughout the globe, and how quickly it has overwhelmed healthcare \nsystems. Infection control and social distancing represent the most evidence-based and critical \ninterventions being utilized to slow the spread of COVID-19. Unlike many other viral outbreaks, \nit now appears that significant transmission of COVID-19 occurs before infected people become \n                                                            \n3 In the name COVID-19, 'CO' stands for 'corona,' 'VI' for 'virus,' and 'D' for disease. \n  4 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-2 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 6 of 32 PageID #:1788\nsymptomatic, which underscores the need for heavy focus on social distancing as a means to \nprevent transmission.  \n10.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified many \nparticularly vulnerable populations who are at increased risk of having severe outcomes from \nCOVID-19.4 These include:  \n•  People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma \n•  People who have serious heart conditions \n•  People who are immunocompromised5 \n•  People with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 40 or higher) \n•  People with diabetes \n•  People with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis \n•  People with liver disease \n•  People who are smokers \n•  People who are pregnant or post-partum  \n \n11.  In addition, data shows that African-Americans are experiencing disproportionate \nrates of death from COVID-19.6  \n12.  For vulnerable individuals, social distancing and infection control play an even \nmore central role in protecting against severe negative outcomes, there is no treatment or cure \nthat has been identified to lessen their greater risk of harm after contracting the virus.7 \n13.  Fatality is clearly the worst outcome of COVID-19 infection, but many who \ncontract the illness and “recover” are irreparably damaged. This cannot be understated. The \n                                                            \n4 “At Risk for Severe Illness,” CDC, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-\nprecautions/groups-at-higher-risk.html. \n5 Including but not limited to cancer treatment, smoking, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune \ndeficiencies, HIV/AIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune-weakening medications. \n6 Reis Thebault, Andrew Ba Tran, & Vanessa Williams, “The coronavirus is infecting and killing black \nAmericans at an alarmingly high rate,” The Washington Post (Apr. 7, 2020), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/04/07/coronavirus-is-infecting-killing-black-americans-an-\nalarmingly-high-rate-post-analysis-shows/?arc404=true. \n7 “What You Can Do,” CDC, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/what-\nyou-can-do.html (“Stay home and avoid close contact”); “How to Protect Yourself and Others,” CDC, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html (“The best way to \nprevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.”). \n  5 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-2 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 7 of 32 PageID #:1789\nrespiratory damage associated with severe COVID-19 infection causes long term decreases in \nlung function, and it is likely that among the 10-20% of people who require hospitalization, most \nwill experience long-term effects on their lungs, heart, kidneys, eyes, central nervous system and \nother major organs.8   \n14.  COVID-19 infection rates have grown exponentially in the U.S. The CDC now \nreports COVID-19 cases and deaths in all 50 states.9 When COVID-19 impacts a community, it \nwill also impact the community’s detention facilities. Federal and local correctional facilities will \nnot be able to stop the entry of COVID-19 into their facilities: the reality is that the infection is \ninside many facilities already. It is inevitable and is not preventable. Numerous county jails, like \nCook County Jail, have already reported hundreds of COVID-19 infections among staff and \ninmates. On March 31, 2020, the medical leadership in the NYC jail system announced that they \nwould be unable to stop COVID from entering their facility and called for release as the primary \nresponse to this crisis.10 Since that time, over 800 staff and inmates have tested positive in the \nNYC jail system. \n15.  Once a virus enters a facility, detention settings promote the spread of the virus to \nthe wider community. The constant flow of staff in and out of detention facilities only increases \nthe spread of the virus beyond the walls of the facility itself.  \n                                                            \n8 Melissa Healy, “Coronavirus infection may cause lasting damage throughout the body, doctors fear,” \nL.A.

Prisoners in general have poorer health and more underlying medical conditions \nthan those in the community.11 Over half of prisoners have serious physical or behavioral health \nproblems, and incarcerated people have statistically higher rates of smoking, cardiovascular \ndisease, infectious diseases and cancer. Additionally, the leading cause of death in U.S. jails is \nsuicide, which reflects a toxic overlap between untreated mental health and substance use \nproblems.12 \n17.  The CDC and other organizations have issued recommendations on how to \nprevent or decrease the spread of COVID-19. It is important for jails to comply with the CDC \nguidance on management of COVID-19 in detention facilities. But it is also important to \nunderstand that compliance with these recommendations alone is not enough to create a setting \nthat sufficiently protects the health and safety of individuals detained and working at the jail. The \nCDC, a federal agency, could not impose mandatory requirements on state or local officials, \neven when evidence-based medicine would support such requirements. The CDC guidelines are \nmore appropriately considered a “harm reduction” approach, which is a common practice in \npublic health, where organizations offer recommendations on how to reduce a risk of harm even \nwhen the subject is not following the appropriate practices. \n18.  The unanimous consensus from the CDC, and medical and public health experts, \nis that social distancing and infection control are imperative to decrease rampant spread of \nCOVID-19 and protect people’s health. The fact that the CDC adds the phrase “if possible” or “if \n                                                            \n11 Laura M.

In my opinion, based on my correctional and epidemiological training as well as a \nreview of the literature surrounding COVID-19, mandating that staff and detainees be kept six \nfeet apart from each other at all times, absent life-threatening emergencies such as use of force \nand fire evacuation, in addition to robust sanitation,  testing, and infection control, is essential to \npreventing a widespread outbreak of this disease in a custodial setting. \n20.  I have been inside numerous state and federal detention facilities, including the \nCook County Jail. In a detention facility, social distancing can be challenging and requires close \nattention to all aspects of operations among both staff and detained people.14 The typical design \nand operation of correctional settings, including densely packed areas for housing, health \nservices, food services, recreation, bathroom and shower facilities for detained people, as well as \nthe entry points, locker rooms, meal areas, and control rooms for staff, all contribute to the \nspread of infectious disease. Detention facilities are typically operated in a way that forces close \ncontact between people and relies on massive amounts of movement every day from one part of \nthe facility to another, e.g., for programming, access to cafeterias, commissary, medical, just to \nname a few. This movement is required of detained people as well as staff. This normal level of \nmovement requires that correctional settings design and implement detailed plans and policies to \nboth reduce the amount of movement, and immediately change housing operations to permit \n                                                            \n13 “Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and \nDetention Facilities,” CDC, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/guidance-\ncorrectional-detention.pdf (“Although social distancing is challenging to practice in correctional and \ndetention environments, it is a cornerstone of reducing transmission of respiratory diseases such as \nCOVID-19.”). \n14 State of Illinois, Executive Order 2020-13 (Mar. 26, 2020), \nhttps://www2.illinois.gov/Documents/ExecOrders/2020/ExecutiveOrder-2020-13.pdf. \n  8 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-2 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 10 of 32 PageID #:1792\ndetainees to socially distance from one another in order to control the spread of a highly \ncommunicable disease, such as COVID-19. \n21.  The sally-port is one of the most ubiquitous aspects of detention, and is a place \nthat requires special attention. The sally-port, or control port, is a series of two locked gates that \nbring every staff member and detained person past a windowed control room as they stop in a \nroom between locked gates. The normal functioning of detention centers demands that during \nshift change for staff, or as the security count approaches for detained people, large numbers of \npeople press into sally-ports as they move into or out of other areas of the facility. This process \ncreates close contact, and the sally port windows that are used to hand out radios, keys and other \nequipment to staff ensure efficient passage of communicable disease from the control rooms into \nthe sally port areas on a regular basis. But like other aspects of detention settings, passage of \nstaff and detained people through sally-ports can be monitored and regulated in a way that \npromotes six feet of separation between people. Other areas similarly require special attention, \nincluding analysis of existing workflows and honest assessment of the operational and staffing \nimplications, including housing areas, meal spaces, medication administration, sick call, \nbathroom and day room access, etc. \n22.  Solitary confinement is not medical isolation.15 Simply locking detained people \ninto cells will worsen, not improve, efforts to curb infection rates. When people are locked into \ncells alone, for most of the day, they quickly experience psychological distress that manifests in \nself-harm and suicidality, which requires rapid response and intensive care outside the facility for \nmental and physical health emergencies. In addition, units that are comprised of locked cells may \nrequire additional staff to escort people to and from their cells for showers, telephone calls, and \n                                                            \n15 David Cloud, Dallas Augustine & Brie Williams, “The Ethical Use of Medical Isolation,” Amend (Apr. \n9, 2020), https://amend.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Medical-Isolation-vs-Solitary_Amend.pdf. \n  9 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-2 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 11 of 32 PageID #:1793\nother encounters, and medical, pharmacy and nursing staff must move on and off these units \ndaily to assess the welfare and health needs of these people, creating the same spread of the virus \nfrom the community into the facilities as if detained people were not locked down. In addition, \nlocking two people into a cell increases the risk of transmission of COVID-19 from one of them \nto the other. This risk is especially harmful in facilities, like the Cook County Jail, that have \nfailed to create special protections for people with known risk factors for serious illness and \ndeath from COVID-19 infection, and hold these high-risk patients in locked cells with other \nlower-risk patients.  \n23.  The documents I have reviewed in this case fail to establish a comprehensive \napproach to social distancing at the Cook County Jail and must be quickly integrated into a \nsingle COVID-19 emergency response plan that not only mandates in a detailed fashion, but also \nsupports and monitors implementation of, social distancing. The deficiencies I have noted \ninclude: \na.  Lack of clarity for how detainees will be maintained with 6 feet of separation \nin day rooms, hallways, sally-ports, medication lines, bathrooms and showers, \nmedical clinics, transport, and recreation spaces. \n \nb.  Lack of detail on how staff will engage in social distancing as they enter the \nfacilities and are screened, pass through sally-ports, hallways, to and from \ntheir security posts, clinic assignments, administrative office, and during \nmeals and breaks. \n \nc.  Lack of assessment of staffing requirements to implement social distancing \namong staff and detained people. \n \n24.  Mandating social distancing for detainees is critical to protect against \nuncontrolled spread of COVID-19. However, there are other actions that should be taken. In \naddition to social distancing, Cook County Jail must engage in adequate infection control. My \nexperience managing smaller outbreaks is that an additional challenge in correctional settings is \n  10 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-2 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 12 of 32 PageID #:1794\nto apply hospital-level infection control measures on security staff. Ongoing, effective training is \ncrucial to implement as many measures as possible. In a hospital or nursing home, staff may \nmove up and down a single hallway over their shift, and they may interact with one patient at a \ntime. In detention settings, officers move great distances, are asked to shout or yell commands to \nlarge numbers of people, routinely apply handcuffs and operate heavy doors/gates, operate large \ncorrectional keys and are trained in the use of force. These basic duties cause the personal \nprotective equipment they are given to quickly break and become useless, and even when in \ngood working order, may impede their ability talk and be understood, as in the case of masks. As \na result, implementation of infection control measures requires a significant amount of training \nand supervision. It cannot be implemented through email or signage alone, but requires active \nrole modeling, supervision and support of staff. One of the most ubiquitous examples of this \nchallenge is the now common observation that many correctional staff who have been issued \nN95 masks in the past two weeks at the Cook County Jail are currently not wearing them, or may \nbe wearing them around their necks or on their heads.   \n25.  Another critical task for any detention setting responding to a COVID-19 \noutbreak is to identify all of the people held in their custody who are particularly vulnerable. \nThis task is critical for several reasons, and the daily updating of the list and locations of high-\nrisk patients is critical to basic outbreak management. Creating a real-time list of high-risk \npatients allows for: \n•  Identification of high-risk patients who are eligible for release from detention \n \n•  Implementing of active surveillance, special housing arrangements, and other \nprotective measures for high-risk patients who are not ill \n \n•  Implementing enhanced surveillance and protective measures for high-risk \npatients who are in a quarantine setting, or who develop symptoms of \nCOVID-19 \n  11 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-2 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 13 of 32 PageID #:1795\n \n•  Development and implementation of re-entry plans of care and support with \ncommunity partners for high-risk patients  \n \n26.  Hand-washing and good hygiene practices are also important. Access to hand \nwashing is limited in detention settings as compared to the community. Many common areas \nlack operable sinks with access to soap and paper hand towels. In addition, many of the sinks \nutilized in correctional settings do not operate with a faucet that can be turned and left on, but \nrather rely on pushing a button which provides a limited amount of water over a limited amount \nof time. These metered faucets are designed to save water by limiting the amount of time water \nflows, but make adequate hand washing with soap for at least 20 seconds very difficult, if not \nimpossible. \n27.  Infection control policies and procedures in detention settings are often at odds \nwith basic CDC guidance. The CDC guidelines for infection control regarding COVID-19 make \nclear the need to aggressively prepare for, and intervene in, the spread of this virus throughout \ncorrectional settings. One of the most serious deficiencies in correctional practices involves the \nfailure to appropriately train and equip correctional staff and inmate workers in the disinfection \nof the physical plant, and enable all people inside the facility to engage on social distancing and \nhand washing. When security staff and detainees are given masks without any guidance about \ntheir use, or when they should be replaced, or what scenarios in their environment represent \nhigher risk of COVID-19 infection, the net effect is to decrease attention to infection control. \nSimilarly, when inconsistent strengths of cleaning solution, or inadequate access to clean paper \ntowels or other products used to wipe down surfaces are utilized, the net effect is also to decrease \nthe level of infection control and increase the risk of rapid COVID-19 spread throughout the \nfacility. When no special effort is made to use more highly trained or equipped cleaning \n  12 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-2 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 14 of 32 PageID #:1796\npersonnel with protective equipment to clean and handle the effects of staff or detainees who \nexhibit signs and symptoms of COVID-19, an especially egregious breach in infection control \nhas occurred. Because security staff and inmates far outnumber health staff in correctional \nsettings, they must be trained, equipped and engaged as the first responders for infection control. \nFailure to take this approach significantly increases the risk of rapid COVID-19 spread \nthroughout the facility and increases the risk of preventable illness and death. The Cook County \nJail’s failure to have implemented adequate infection control policies before COVID-19 \nappeared within the facility is likely part of the reason why the outbreak quickly became so \nlarge. But as described above, even the perfect implementation of an adequate infection control \npolicy would be insufficient to protect against uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 in the absence \nof social distancing at the jail. \nHealth Staff \nSecurity Staff \nDetainees \n  \n \n  13 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-2 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 15 of 32 PageID #:1797\n28.  Security staff represent the front-line infection control force inside correctional \nsettings, and evidence-based infection control plans cannot be implemented without active \ntraining of staff that is also ongoing. This training should include formal training on the \nprotective equipment, environmental cleaning and health service activities that security staff will \nparticipate in or support. These trainings should span every tour and day of service so that every \nstaff member is trained, and should be conducted in both dedicated 15-30 minute sessions and \nalso in more brief venues, such as roll call.  \n29.  My review of the Cook County Jail’s policies and other materials additionally \nleads me to have the following other specific concerns and recommendations about the health \nstatus of staff and detained people inside Cook County Jail regarding COVID-19 response: \na. Lack of a Covid-19 plan. It appears that CSCSO does not yet have a single \nCOVID-19 response plan, and is instead relying on an amalgam of pre-existing policies, \nindividual protocols and other directives to manage their response to COVID-19. I have \nreviewed an outbreak management policy from 2017 that covers numerous types of infectious \ndisease concerns, and has a half page amendment relating to COVID-19 testing on the last of 15 \npages. I have also reviewed a separate sanitation policy that appears specific to COVID-19 and a \n21-page operational briefing from April 4, 2020 that appears to include several pages of general \noccupational guidance relating to COVID-19 that is not jail-specific and targeted towards \n“maintaining a healthy business.  This lack of a single COVID-19 emergency response plan is a \nglaring deficiency, and at odds with good correctional practice. Large systems such as CCSO \nemploy and care for several thousands of individuals and it is not possible to respond to a large-\nscale emergency without a single, coordinated plan. This is even more pressing for the COVID-\n19 response, because the public health directives for management change every week, sometimes \n  14 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-2 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 16 of 32 PageID #:1798\ndaily, and thus, CCSO must have one unified plan that can be updated and reliably utilized by all \nsecurity, health and administrative staff, and which partners in public health organizations can \nreview and support. If it has not already occurred, CCSO must combine all of the existing \nprotocols and procedures into one COVID-19 emergency response plan, as is mandated in other \ndetention settings.16 \nb. Lack of identification or tracking of high-risk patients. The correctional health \nstaff, and their electronic medical records, are very sophisticated, and the identity and location of \npeople with CDC identified risk factors for serious illness and death from COVID-19 infection is \nknown to the health service. In an outbreak that targets a subset of the incarcerated population, it \nis critical to create special protections for these individuals, which may include consideration for \nrelease, as well as active surveillance with twice daily symptom and temperature checks during \nincarceration, and additional support during re-entry. This requires that CCSO create a \nmanagement plan that identifies these high-risk patients for specialized management and \nprotection, which does not exist according to the statements by General Counsel for the Sheriff.  \nc. Lack of infection control practices consistent with CDC guidelines. The \nsanitation and other policies I have reviewed fail to address or ensure basic infection control \nmeasures that are critical to the CDC guidelines on COVID-19 response in detention settings. \nSpecifically: \n•  The sanitation policy fails to identify any special measures taken to clean or \ndisinfect the living spaces and personal effect of people who become \nsymptomatic for COVID-19 and are taken to medical isolation. This is an \nextremely high-risk scenario that has played out numerous times already in \nthe Cook County Jail, and I fear that lack of attention to this high-risk setting \nhas contributed to the substantial outbreak already present. The CDC gives \nclear guidance on this matter, including letting confined spaces sit for one day \nbefore entering/cleaning, and use of PPE for anyone engaged in cleaning. \n \n                                                            \n16 ICE ERO 4/10/20 mandates that all facilities housing ICE detainees must have such a plan. \n  15 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-2 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 17 of 32 PageID #:1799\n•  The sanitation policy leaves all communication regarding infection control to \nthe housing area officer, but my experience during outbreaks is that detained \npeople have numerous questions about infection control and sanitation that \nhousing area officers are not trained to respond to. There must be regular \nengagement between infection control nursing or medical staff, and both staff \nand detained people in each housing area for implementation of effective \ninfection control during an outbreak. \nd. Lack of re-entry planning for detained people leaving Cook County Jail. Part \nof an integrated plan for COVID-19 response in detention settings is the need to plan for safe re-\nentry for people leaving jail. This critical requirement is outlined in CDC recommendations and \nmust be developed as a section in a unified COVID-19 emergency plan. The CDC makes clear \nrecommendations on this process:17 \n \n•  If an individual does not clear the screening process, follow the protocol for a \nsuspected COVID-19 case – including putting a face mask on the individual, \nimmediately placing them under medical isolation, and evaluating them for \npossible COVID-19 testing. \n \n•  If the individual is released before the recommended medical isolation period \nis complete, discuss release of the individual with state, local, tribal, and/or \nterritorial health departments to ensure safe medical transport and continued \nshelter and medical care, as part of release planning. Make direct linkages to \ncommunity resources to ensure proper medical isolation and access to medical \ncare. \n \n•  Before releasing an incarcerated/detained individual with COVID-19 \nsymptoms to a community-based facility, such as a homeless shelter, contact \nthe facility’s staff to ensure adequate time for them to prepare to continue \nmedical isolation, or contact local public health to explore alternate housing \noptions. \n \n30.  These steps are important to improve conditions at the Cook County Jail that help \nto prevent detainees and staff from contracting COVID-19. The failures outlined above have \ncontributed to the rapid spread of COVID-19 in Cook County Jail, and to the health \nconsequences suffered by detained people and staff alike. As noted above, however, they alone \n                                                            \n17 “Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and \nDetention Facilities,” CDC, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/guidance-\ncorrectional-detention.pdf. \n  16 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-2 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 18 of 32 PageID #:1800\nare insufficient to meaningfully reduce the rate of spread if social distancing at the jail is not \nimmediately implemented. I believe that it is possible to make a significant difference in the \nnumber and severity of COVID-19 cases that ensue going forward, but significant work is \nrequired by the Cook County Sheriff’s Office to enact social distancing and basic infection \ncontrol measures for people held in detention and staff who work in this setting.   \n \n \nSignature: Homer Venters \n               \n                 \n \nDate: 4/19/2020 \nLocation: Port Washington, NY \n \n  17 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-2 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 19 of 32 PageID #:1801\nDr. Homer D.

I completed my medical \ndegree in Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, my training in Internal Medicine \nat Yale-New Haven Hospital, and my Infectious Diseases fellowship in the joint program \nof Brigham & Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital. I am board-\ncertified in both Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases. I practice in Massachusetts \nGeneral Hospital and am an Instructor in Harvard Medical School. I am a member of the \nBiothreats Response Team at Massachusetts General Hospital, a position which has \nrequired me to take a leading role in infection control measures during the 2019 \nCoronavirus Disease (COVID-19) outbreak. \n \nI have been retained by the plaintiffs in this case to provide statements and testimony \nabout COVID-19, its clinical presentation and course, and the medical evidence \nregarding its transmission. I am not charging the plaintiffs for the time that I spend on \nthis case. A copy of the documents I received as part of my work on this case is \nappended to the end of my report. My opinions are set forth to a reasonable degree of \nmedical certainty based on my education, training, experience, and familiarity with the \nauthoritative literature on the subjects discussed below. \n \nCOVID-19 Background. COVID-19 is the disease caused by a novel respiratory virus, \nSARS-CoV-2, identified in late 2019 in Wuhan, China.1 The name of the virus is SARS-\nCoV-2, and the name of the disease caused by this virus is COVID-19. This disease \nprimarily manifests as influenza-like illness. A fraction of patients with COVID-19 in all \nage groups go on to develop severe respiratory disease. A patient with the severe form \nof COVID-19 is unable to breathe effectively to provide enough oxygen for their body's \nvital organs (\"hypoxia\"). Hypoxia causes organ failure and will lead to death if it \nprogresses. Patients with hypoxia from severe COVID-19 uniformly feel an intense and \nfrightening degree of shortness of breath. Medical treatment for hypoxia involves \nprovision of supplemental oxygen, which can be done non-invasively in mild cases and \nby ventilator in severe cases. In the United States, these patients remain connected to \nthe ventilator for a median of 10 days.2 The mortality rate is highest among those of \nadvanced age and those with other medical conditions. Of those who recover to the \npoint of being liberated from mechanical ventilation, these patients commonly need \nseveral more days of hospitalization and then weeks of rehabilitation. Aside from \nhypoxia, COVID-19 has been observed to cause several other complications in \nhospitalized patients, including blood clots, strokes, liver damage, kidney damage, \nirregular heart rhythms, and heart failure. Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are also \n                                                       \n1 Wei-jie Guan et al., “Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China,” New England Journal of \nMedicine, February 28, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2002032. \n2 Pavan K.

There is no effective therapy. There is \nno effective intervention to prevent disease in a person exposed to someone with \nCOVID-19. There is no effective vaccine or medication that prevents COVID-19. \nTherefore, the only effective means of addressing the threat of COVID-19 are in \nbehavioral strategies of prevention. Persons who have COVID-19 must be immediately \nisolated to prevent transmission to others. Persons who are exposed to COVID-19 must \nbe immediately quarantined. Persons who are susceptible to COVID-19 must maintain \nsocial distancing from others. \n \nDiagnosis. The most common means of confirming COVID-19 diagnosis is through \ndetection of SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal testing. In this test, a swab of the \nnasopharynx of the patient is obtained and a molecular identification of the SARS-CoV-\n2 virus is conducted using a method called polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Concerns \nhave been raised about the sensitivity of the nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR, \nmeaning that a number of patients suspected of having COVID-19 may indeed have the \ninfection despite a negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR test.3 The sensitivity of \nnasopharyngeal testing by all commercial testing platforms declines several days after \nthe onset of symptoms, even though patients may still have clinical illness and may still \nbe able to transmit the virus. Because of this, many clinical settings use two serial \nnegative tests to “rule out” patients for the virus. The Abbott \"ID Now\" SARS-CoV-2 test \nis one type of PCR test, which can deliver rapid results, but has a particularly high false \nnegative rate. In patients with a compatible clinical syndrome, I would not rely on a \nnegative PCR test from the Abbott \"ID Now\" SARS-CoV-2 test. Indeed, in my hospital, \npatients with typical clinical signs and symptoms of COVID-19 who are at \nepidemiological risk for the infection (such as from an exposure to a jail) are presumed \nto have COVID-19 even if they have two negative SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal PCR \ntests. I did not see any indication in the materials that I reviewed that individuals at Cook \nCounty Jail receive two negative tests before COVID-19 is considered ruled out or that \nindividuals with compatible clinical syndromes are presumed to have COVID-19 despite \nnegative PCR testing. This suggests to me that some people in Cook County Jail who \ninitially test negative may in fact have COVID-19.  \n \nTransmission. Based on a framework followed by the World Health Organization \n(WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are three \npossible ways that a respiratory virus can potentially spread:4  \n                                                       \n3 J Zhao et al., “Antibody Responses to SARS-CoV-2 in Patients of Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019,” Clinical \nInfectious Diseases, March 28, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa344; Li Guo et al., “Profiling Early Humoral \nResponse to Diagnose Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19),” Clinical Infectious Diseases, March 21, 2020, \nhttps://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa310; Tao Ai et al., “Correlation of Chest CT and RT-PCR Testing in Coronavirus \nDisease 2019 (COVID-19) in China: A Report of 1014 Cases,” Radiology, February 26, 2020, 200642, \nhttps://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2020200642. \n4 Chad J. Roy and Donald K. Milton, “Airborne Transmission of Communicable Infection — The Elusive Pathway,” \nNew England Journal of Medicine 350, no. 17 (April 22, 2004): 1710–12, https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp048051. \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-3 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 4 of 8 PageID #:1818\n \n1.  Fomite transmission: virus particles remain viable on environmental surfaces. \nWhen people touch these surfaces and then touch their face, they can contract \nthe virus. \n2.  Droplet transmission: virus particles in large respiratory droplets (>5micrometres) \nthat are emitted by an infected person can be inhaled by a susceptible person in \nclose contact. These large droplets can travel up to six feet. Healthcare workers \nprotect themselves against droplet transmission by wearing \"routine\" surgical or \nprocedural masks, gowns, and gloves, and practicing hand hygiene before and \nafter each patient encounter. \n3.  Airborne, or aerosolized, transmission: virus particles in small respiratory droplets \n(<5micrometres) that are emitted by an infected person can remain suspended in \nthe air and remain infective over several hours and over long distances. \nPathogens that travel via airborne transmission can infect persons even if they \nare wearing surgical or procedural masks. Healthcare workers protect \nthemselves against airborne transmission by wearing specialized masks (N95 \nmasks or Powered Air-Purifying Respirators) and by isolating infected persons in \nclosed rooms with negative-pressure ventilation. Buildings or facilities with other \nforms of ventilation may spread aerosolized pathogens between rooms. \n \nIt is well-known that SARS-CoV-2 is spread by fomite and droplet transmission. \nResearchers in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recently sought \nto determine whether SARS-CoV-2 can remain viable via airborne transmission.5 They \naerosolized virus in small droplets (<5micrometres) at quantities that would be typically \nfound from the respiratory tract of infected humans. They then spread the virus across \ndifferent environmental conditions. They found that SARS-CoV-2 virus remained viable \nin aerosols (small droplets) for the entire duration of their experiment (3 hours). SARS-\nCoV-2 also remained viable on various surfaces (e.g., plastic and stainless steel) for up \nto 72 hours. This leads medical experts to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly \ntransmitted by fomite and droplet transmission, but airborne transmission is possible \nwhen aerosols are generated.  \n \nThis is consistent with clinical experience with SARS-CoV-1, a closely related virus that \nwas the cause of the 2003 SARS outbreak in China, Hong Kong, and Canada. While \nthe dominant form of transmission was through fomites and droplets, SARS-CoV-1 was \nalso capable of being aerosolized and remained infective over time and space via \nairborne transmission. This virus was transmitted to several healthcare workers via \ndroplet transmission. During the course of aerosol-generating medical procedures, \nSARS-CoV-1 was transmitted to healthcare workers via airborne transmission even if \nthey were wearing surgical masks.6 Aerosols can be generated by a number of common \n                                                       \n5 Neeltje van Doremalen et al., “Aerosol and Surface Stability of SARS-CoV-2 as Compared with SARS-CoV-1,” New \nEngland Journal of Medicine 382, no. 16 (April 16, 2020): 1564–67, https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc2004973. \n6 Damon C.

This suggests that respiratory contact \nis not the only mode of transmission for this virus. There are several reasons to believe \nthat SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted via fecal-oral contact.7 First, many viral respiratory \ninfections, including other coronaviruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2, have been \nshown to also transmit via fecal-oral contact. Second, SARS-CoV-2 has been identified \nin the stool of many patients with COVID-19.8 Third, many patients with COVID-19 have \nnausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, suggesting that the virus has a direct pathogenic effect \non the gastrointestinal tract. Finally, even among COVID-19 patients who lack \ngastrointestinal symptoms, live virus has been isolated in the stool. The identification of \nviable SARS-CoV-2 in stool of infected persons raises concern of airborne transmission \nvia toilet flushing.9 \n \nBy these mechanisms, SARS-CoV-2 is easily transmitted between humans. There is \noverwhelming evidence demonstrating that a person can spread SARS-CoV-2 before \nthey develop symptoms or without ever developing symptoms at all.10 This \ncharacteristic is one of the major reasons why it spreads so rapidly. At the time of this \nwriting, there have been more than 700,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in \nthe U.S. with more than 30,000 deaths. Because of widespread restrictions in laboratory \ntesting, I believe there are many more infected persons in the U.S. than have been \nconfirmed. Rapid transmission of the virus has been noted in congregate settings, \nincluding nursing homes, cruise ships, conferences, homeless shelters, and correctional \nfacilities. In many of these settings, infection spread despite the diligent implementation \nof hygienic measures, including physical separation of individuals within the congregate \nsetting and the use of hand hygiene and personal protective equipment. \n \nIn his declaration, Mr. Michael Miller states that when individuals are identified as being \nsymptomatic, they are put into isolation at the Cook County Jail. While this intervention \nis necessary, it is insufficient to prevent spread of the infection because patients \ntransmit SARS-CoV-2 prior to developing symptoms. It further appears from the \nmaterials that I reviewed that the jail is housing persons under investigation (PUIs) of \n                                                       \n7 Jinyang Gu, Bing Han, and Jian Wang, “COVID-19: Gastrointestinal Manifestations and Potential Fecal–Oral \nTransmission,” Gastroenterology, March 2020, https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2020.02.054. \n8 Wenling Wang et al., “Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Different Types of Clinical Specimens,” JAMA, March 11, 2020, \nhttps://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.3786. \n9 Sunny H Wong, Rashid NS Lui, and Joseph JY Sung, “Covid-19 and the Digestive System,” Journal of \nGastroenterology and Hepatology, March 25, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.15047. \n10 Yan Bai et al., “Presumed Asymptomatic Carrier Transmission of COVID-19,” JAMA 323, no. 14 (April 14, 2020): \n1406, https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.2565; Kenji Mizumoto et al., “Estimating the Asymptomatic Proportion \nof Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Cases on Board the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship, Yokohama, Japan, \n2020,” Euro Surveillance: Bulletin Europeen Sur Les Maladies Transmissibles = European Communicable Disease \nBulletin 25, no. 10 (2020), https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.10.2000180; Hiroshi Nishiura et al., \n“Estimation of the Asymptomatic Ratio of Novel Coronavirus Infections (COVID-19),” International Journal of \nInfectious Diseases, March 2020, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.020. \n  4 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-3 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 6 of 8 PageID #:1820\nhaving COVID-19 in isolation together while their tests are pending. If this occurs, it \nrepresents a grave health risk because it is almost certain to mix positive and negative \ncases together, thereby increasing the risk that PUIs who were negative before being \nput into isolation will develop COVID-19. \n \nHand hygiene and the provision of surgical masks are insufficient to prevent the spread \nof infection in a congregate setting. A clear demonstration of this is evident in the case \nof the Diamond Princess cruise ship,11 which sailed from Japan in January of this year. \nIn the last week of January, a passenger who disembarked from this ship in Hong Kong \ntested positive for COVID-19. Within days, the cruise ship was quarantined in Japan \nand strict precautions of hand hygiene and cabin isolation were implemented for all \ncrew and passengers. Despite these measures, more than 700 people were infected \nwith the virus over the following month. By the end of February, the Diamond Princess \ncruise ship accounted for nearly half of COVID-19 cases outside of China. Several other \ncruise ships have since had similar experiences with COVID-19. In terms of viral \ntransmission dynamics, in my opinion, a jail constitutes an equal or greater risk setting \nto that of a cruise ship. \n \nSocial Distancing. The recommendation for all persons living in areas of COVID-19 \ndisease activity is to engage in social distancing, hand hygiene, and proper respiratory \nprecautions. Social distancing involves physical separation of individuals by more than \nsix feet, avoidance of public places, and avoidance of congregate habitation. Social \ndistancing is the primary means by which individuals can be safely protected from the \nthreat of COVID-19, and by which public healthcare facilities will be able to withstand \nthe surge in patient volume related to this outbreak. There is ample evidence supporting \nthe use of social distancing as the primary measure of prevention in the COVID-19 \noutbreak: \n \n•  There is a strong biological rationale to containing a respiratory viral illness when \nsusceptible populations stop gathering around persons who are potentially \ninfected. \n•  When social distancing measures have been implemented in prior outbreaks of \nrespiratory viruses, they have demonstrated moderate success in containing the \nspread of infection. \n•  Mathematical modeling studies project that social distancing measures prevent a \nrapid, overwhelming epidemic of COVID-19 cases. \n•  Analyses of state-level policies in Hong Kong and in the United States during the \nCOVID-19 outbreak demonstrate that implementation of social distancing \nmeasures coincide with a reduced spread of the infection.12 \n \n                                                       \n11 Mallapaty, Smriti. “What the Cruise-Ship Outbreaks Reveal about COVID-19,” Nature News. accessed April 18, \n2020, https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00885-w. \n12 Benjamin J Cowling et al., “Impact Assessment of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions against Coronavirus Disease \n2019 and Influenza in Hong Kong: An Observational Study,” The Lancet Public Health, April 2020, \nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30090-6. \n  5 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-3 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 7 of 8 PageID #:1821\nSocial distancing has been recommended by the CDC, the WHO, the Infectious \nDiseases Society of America, and numerous other professional organizations and public \nhealth entities in response to this outbreak. Social distancing is the officially stated \npolicy of state and federal governments in response to COVID-19. Without social \ndistancing, medical experience demonstrates that the rate of transmission will be \nrampant and uncontrolled, and will risk overwhelming the healthcare system. \n \nI reviewed the materials from the Sheriff suggesting that the provision of surgical masks \nalleviates the need for social distancing. This is inconsistent with the position of the \nCDC, the WHO, and a number of professional and public health organizations with \nexpertise on COVID-19. As I described above, surgical masks do not prevent fomite, \nairborne transmission, and fecal-oral transmission of the virus. The high rate of \ninfectivity by asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic persons, in concert with the limitations \nof clinical assessment and PCR testing in identifying positive cases, makes social \ndistancing a necessary intervention to prevent the spread of infection and downstream \ncomplications of COVID-19. \n \nI reviewed materials from the Sheriff indicating that the jail considers 170 detainees who \nhave COVID-19 to be medically recovered from the disease. The term \"medically \nrecovered\" is ambiguous since it can mean either (1) the alleviation of symptoms and \nclinical resolution of disease in an individual or (2) the inability for a person with COVID-\n19 to transmit the virus and infect others. The determination of when a COVID-19 \npatient is unable to transmit the virus and infect others is complex because of the limited \ndata on this issue. In most settings, patients with COVID-19 are considered to be \nunable to transmit the infection only several days following the resolution of symptoms \nand with a negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. \n \nI reviewed materials from the Sheriff stating that individuals who have recovered from \nCOVID-19 have immunity to the virus. While it is hypothesized that most individuals who \nare infected with COVID-19 develop immunity to the virus, there are many uncertainties \nto this statement. Durable immunity to COVID-19 after infection has not been proven in \nlarge-scale medical studies, though it is inferred from similar coronaviruses. There are \nseveral known cases of COVID-19 patients meeting criteria for hospital discharge or \ndiscontinuation of quarantine (with stricter criteria than is stipulated in the Sherriff's \ndocumentation) who subsequently are found to have a positive nasopharyngeal PCR \ntest.13 \n   \nAmir M.

My name is Laura Rasmussen-Torvik.   I am the Chief of Epidemiology in the \nDepartment of Preventive Medicine at Northwestern University.  I have a PhD in \nEpidemiology and have held a faculty position at Northwestern for over 10 years.  My \nCV is attached to this declaration. \n \n2.  I was asked by Plaintiffs’ counsel in Mays v. Dart to review daily counts of  positive \nCOVID-19 detainees in isolation and convalescent detainees in recovery at the Cook \nCounty jail to comment on COVID-19 transmission and trends at the Cook County jail. \nHowever, I am unable to comment on these topics based on these statistics alone. \n \n3.  We cannot truly understand trends only by looking at daily cumulative confirmed case \ncounts—which are typically presented in aggregate and not broken down into those in \nisolation and recovery (or positive and \"no longer positive\" as presented on the Cook \nCounty Sheriff's office website https://www.cookcountysheriff.org/covid-19-cases-at-\nccdoc/ ).  In order to begin to understand trends in COVID-19 in a location, we need to \nunderstand how many tests are conducted each day, and how many of these tests are \npositive each day.  The less testing you do on a given day, the fewer positive tests you \nwill have; however, this does not necessarily indicate that there are fewer cases of disease \npresenting in the population on that day.    \n \n4.  For the Cook County Jail, it is important to provide this information both for detainees \nand correctional officers.  Per the Cook County Sheriff's website on April 18, it appears \nthat cumulatively 445 detainees have been tested for COVID-19 and 350 have tested \npositive—a positive test result rate of over 78%.   Per the Illinois Department of Health \non April 18 in all of Illinois (https://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/covid19-statistics), \n137,404 COVID-19 tests had been performed with 29,160 results—a positive rate of \n21%.   \n \n5.  At a press conference about COVID-19 on March 30th, Michael Ryan, executive director \nof the WHO Health Emergencies Program, stated that “If 80-90% of the people test \npositive, you are probably missing a lot of cases,” and “we would certainly like to see \ncountries testing at the level of ten negative tests to one positive, as a general benchmark \nof a system that's doing enough testing to pick up all cases.” \n \n6.  To understand the trends at the Cook County Jail, it is also necessary to understand how \n\"no longer positive\" detainees or “convalescent” detainees are classified.   The CDC does \nnot use the terms \"no longer positive\" or “convalescent”, but instead provides guidance \nabout when people who have tested positive can discontinue isolation based on a) test \nbased or b) symptom based strategy.  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html \n \n7.  Because of both widespread issues with access to testing and the lengthy clinical course \nof COVID-19 (particularly in more severe cases), in addition to daily tests and positive \ntests, health departments are tracking the number of COVID-19+ patients (as well as \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-4 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 3 of 34 PageID #:1825\nCOVID-19 “persons under investigation” or PUI) who are (1) hospitalized but not in the \nICU and (2) who are hospitalized in the ICU, in order to understand disease trends.   \n \n8.  On April 18, the Illinois Department of Health reported 3,148 total COVID + PUI in \nhospitals but not in the ICU, and 1,192 COVID + PUI patients in the ICU \n(https://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/hospitalization-utilization) across Illinois.  To \nunderstand COVID-19 trends at the Cook County Jail it would be important to know \ndaily counts of the number of detainees hospitalized (including in the hospital facilities \non the premises of the Jail) and the number requiring ICU care. \n \n9.  Given recent evidence of spread of COVID-19 from people without any symptoms \n(https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6914e1.htm) it is critical \nthat all Illinoisans continue to practice social distancing, remaining 6 feet apart, \npracticing appropriate hand hygiene, and utilizing cloth masks whenever possible in order \nto control the spread of this disease. \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information I have provided is true and \ncorrect to the best of my knowledge, information, memory, and belief. \n \n \n \n \nApril 19, 2020          /s/ Laura Rasmussen-Torvik  \nEvanston, Illinois        Laura Rasmussen-Torvik  \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-4 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 4 of 34 PageID #:1826\n \n1/2/20 \n \nLaura J.

I am a Volunteer Investigator at the Chicago Community Bond \nFund, assisting Plaintiffs’ counsel in Mays v. Dart. On April 14, I spoke to Bryant Blake, a \ndetainee in the Cook County Jail, who provided me the following information. \n \n1.  Mr. Blake is 51 years old. He is residing in Division 11 (Div11-BF-310-1) of the Cook \nCounty Jail. He is incarcerated on $100,000 bond that he cannot afford to pay. He has \nbeen in the Jail since February 29, 2020. \n \n2.  Mr. Blake was residing in quarantine until April 12. His previous roommate contracted \nCOVID-19, at which point he was moved from a double cell to a single cell. Mr. Blake \nasked to be tested after his cellmate tested positive, but he did not receive a test. \n \n3.  Mr. Blake has a spinal and neck injury. He is supposed to receive bilateral facial \ninjections because of the injury but he has not been receiving them.   \n \n4.  Social distancing is not possible in the Jail. The detainees in Mr. Blake’s tier share \nshowers, toilets and sinks. They share 12 tables in the dayroom, and phones, which are \nunder 2 feet apart. \n \n5.  Mr. Blake has access to soap but not hand sanitizer. He does not have access to cleaning \nsupplies for his cell and it does not get cleaned regularly. \n \n6.  Mr. Blake received a mask for the first time on April 12. \n \n7.  Mr. Blake has written multiple grievances since the pandemic started, including one \nasking for a COVID-19 test after his cellmate tested positive. He has not seen a counselor \nto submit the grievances.  \n \nI am providing this hearsay declaration because of restrictions on visitors and contact with \ndetainees in the Cook County Jail. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true \nand correct. \n  \nApril 14, 2020                                      /s/ Elizabeth Corrado \nChicago, Illinois                                  Elizabeth Corrado \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-5 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 3 of 14 PageID #:1859\n \nAffidavit of Elizabeth Corrado For Kevin Watson \n \nMy name is Elizabeth Corrado. I am a Volunteer Investigator at the Chicago Community Bond \nFund, assisting Plaintiffs’ counsel in Mays v. Dart. On April 14, I spoke to Kevin Watson, a \ndetainee in the Cook County Jail, who provided me the following information. \n \n1.  Mr. Watson is 35 years old. He is residing in Division 11 (Div11-AH-401-1) of the Cook \nCounty Jail. He is incarcerated on a no bond order. He was booked in the Jail on August \n24, 2019. \n \n2.  Mr. Watson is HIV-positive and he has a hernia. \n \n3.  Mr. Watson’s deck went on quarantine on April 14. The deck across from his is also on \nquarantine (after three people tested positive). Four people from the deck across from Mr. \nWatson’s were moved to his deck on April 13. One of those people had a fever, and he \nwas then moved to Division 4. Mr. Watson’s deck first had their temperatures taken on \nApril 14. A nurse told him that if it was 102 degrees or over, it was a symptom of \nCOVID. \n \n4.  Because they are on quarantine, people on Mr. Watson’s deck are only allowed out of \ntheir cells for 2.5 hours total in a day, 6 people at a time. \n \n5.  Everyone on the deck shares showers, sinks and toilets. \n \n6.  Mr. Watson has filed two grievances related to COVID but has not received a response. \n \nI am providing this hearsay declaration because of restrictions on visitors and contact with \ndetainees in the Cook County Jail. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true \nand correct. \n  \nApril 14, 2020                                      /s/ Elizabeth Corrado \nChicago, Illinois                                  Elizabeth Corrado \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-5 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 4 of 14 PageID #:1860\n \nAffidavit of Elizabeth Corrado on Behalf of Charles Bocock \n \nMy name is Elizabeth Corrado. I am a volunteer investigator helping Plaintiffs’ counsel in Mays \nv. Dart.  On April 16, 2020, I spoke to Charles Bocock, who is a detainee in the Cook County \nJail. \n \n1.  Charles Bocock was transferred to Division 4 on April 15. \n \n2.  His unit experienced flooding and has been closed for a while.  A lot of the toilets and \nsinks don’t work.   \n \n3.  There is no heat on the Division 4 tier. \n \n4.  Detainees were told not to drink the water coming from the taps.  A cooler was brought in \nand placed in the day room, but detainees are only allowed in the day room for a few \nhours each day. \n \n5.  The plumbing is broken in most of the cells so it’s impossible to wash hands.  \n \n6.  He has not seen cleaning supplies.  Whereas in Division 6 (his origin division) the COs \nhad spray bottles to disinfect things, none of the guards here do. \n \n7.  Some guards placed duct tape and sprayed paint on the floor and said it had something to \ndo with social distancing, but didn’t explained how it works, and haven’t enforced it. \n \n8.  Detainees have no cleaning cloths in Division 4, so they have ripped apart towels of \ndetainees who have been discharged. \n \n9.  A person in Division 6 who was in the kitchen tested positive for COVID-19 and went to \nStroger. \n \n \nI am providing this hearsay declaration because of restrictions on visitors and contact with \ndetainees in the Cook County Jail. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true \nand correct. \n  \nApril 19, 2020                                       /s/ Elizabeth Corrado \nChicago, Illinois                                  Elizabeth Corrado \n \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 64-5 Filed: 04/19/20 Page 5 of 14 PageID #:1861\n \nAffidavit of Jason Hammond For Javier Montanez \n \nMy name is Jason Hammond. I am a Volunteer Investigator at the Chicago Community Bond \nFund, assisting Plaintiffs’ counsel in Mays v. Dart. On April 16, I spoke to Javier Montanez, a \ndetainee in the Cook County Jail, who provided me the following information. \n \n1.  Mr. Montanez is 52 years old. He is residing in Division 6 (DIV6-1L-21-2) of the Cook \nCounty Jail. He is incarcerated on a no bond order. He has been in the Jail since March \n29, 2019. \n \n2.  Mr. Montanez has Hepatitis C and high blood pressure. He is supposed to be receiving \nblood draws every three weeks because of his Hepatitis. Mr. Montanez has not been \nreceiving the draws, and he was told that medical was shut down.  \n \n3.  The entire division is on lockdown/quarantine. Mr. Montanez is let out of his cell 6 hours \nper day, and locked in for 18 hours per day. 12 people ae allowed in the dayroom at a \ntime. \n \n4.  Everyone shares the dayroom bathroom, as well as general showers and toilets. People \nshare dayroom tables, three phones and a single microwave. \n \n5.  Mr. Montanez receives soap but not hand sanitizer. Cells are never cleaned and the \ncommon areas only get cleaned with watered down bleach.  \n \n6.  About a week ago, detainees started receiving one mask per day. \n \n7.  Nobody in Mr. Montanez’s tier has been tested for COVID-19. \n \n8.

I am a Volunteer Investigator at the Chicago Community Bond \nFund, assisting Plaintiffs’ counsel in Mays v. Dart. On April 16, I spoke to Jeffrey Ferguson, a \ndetainee in the Cook County Jail, who provided me the following information. \n \n1.  Mr. Ferguson is 42 years old. He is residing in Division 2 (DIV2-D2-N-23) of the Cook County \nJail. He is incarcerated on a no bond order. He was booked in the Jail on January 22, 2018. \n \n2.  Mr. Ferguson has chronic mental health issues, including mania and psychosis, as well as \nhigh blood pressure. \n \n3.  Mr. Ferguson is living in an open dormitory, which is on quarantine. It is a working deck, \nand kitchen workers reside there. \n \n4.  Everyone on the deck shares a toilet, shower and sinks. The beds are 2-3 feet from one \nanother. The detainees all share telephones, which are two feet apart, as well as tables for \neating and one microwave that is shared with another unit as well. \n \n5.  Mr. Ferguson receives soap but rarely hand sanitizer. The bathrooms are very dirty as no \none monitors that they get cleaned. \n \n6.  On April 12, all detainees in his unit started receiving a mask per day. \n \n7.  Some people on the deck have had serious COVID symptoms, and they were removed. \nOn April 7, one person was brought in to the deck right after being booked, even though \nthe deck was on quarantine. \n \n8.  Mr. Ferguson has had symptoms of COVID for about a week. He has asked twice to be \ntested but has still not received a test. Jail staff just started checking temperatures on \nApril 13. \n \n9.  On April 12, Mr. Ferguson put duct tape down in the dayroom to remind detainees to \nsocial distance. But guards are making jokes about breaking compliance, and showing \ndisregard for detainees’ health and inability to social distance. \n \n10. On April 2, Mr. Ferguson tried to submit a health grievance. But there is no system for \nsubmitting grievances. The Jail is not giving out forms or receipts or signatures or any \nrecords that the Jail is receiving or processing grievances.  \n \nI am providing this hearsay declaration because of restrictions on visitors and contact with \ndetainees in the Cook County Jail.

He is residing in Division 10 (DIV10-2A-2120-2) of the Cook County \nJail. He is incarcerated on a no bond order. He has been in the Jail since April 20, 2018. \n \n2.  Mr. Blake was residing in a double cell until April 12, when he was moved into a single \ncell. He is not in quarantine. \n \n3.  Social distancing is not practical.

One person was removed from the tier because he was sick. No one who was exposed to \nthat man was tested for COVID-19. \n \n6.  Mr. Blake receives a hotel bar of soap, once a week.

Mr. Blake put in one grievance for medical treatment because nurses have not been \ncoming around for medical treatment.  Mr. Blake gave the grievance to CO Sanders and \nhas not heard anything.  \n \n9.  Usually detainees give grievances to the social workers. But no social workers are \nallowed in the tier, so the grievances are disappearing.  \n \n \nI am providing this hearsay declaration because of restrictions on visitors and contact with \ndetainees in the Cook County Jail.

Legal Standard \n“A plaintiff seeking a temporary restraining order must establish that he is likely to \nsucceed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary \nrelief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”  \nNatera, Inc. v. Bio-Reference Labs., Inc., No. 16 Civ. 9514, 2016 WL 7192106, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. \nDec. 10, 2016) (internal quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted).   \n“It is well established that in this Circuit the standard for an entry of a TRO is the same as \nfor a preliminary injunction.”  Andino v. Fischer, 555 F. Supp. 2d 418, 419 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) \n(collecting cases).  “The showing of irreparable harm is perhaps the single most important \nprerequisite for a preliminary injunction.”  CF 135 Flat LLC v. Triadou SPY N.A., No. 15 Civ. \n5345, 2016 WL 2349111, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 3, 2016) (internal quotation marks, citation, and \nalteration omitted).  Under this prong, the movant “must show that the injury it will suffer is \nlikely and imminent, not remote or speculative, and that such injury is not capable of being fully \nremedied by money damages.”  NAACP v. Town of E. Haven, 70 F.3d 219, 224 (2d Cir. 1995).  \nTo satisfy this requirement, a movant must demonstrate “that he would suffer irreparable harm if \nthe TRO does not issue.”  Andino, 555 F. Supp. 2d at 419.  “The district court has wide \ndiscretion in determining whether to grant a preliminary injunction.”  Almontaser v. N.Y.C. Dep’t \nof Educ., 519 F.3d 505, 508 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (per \ncuriam). \n \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1C:2a0s-ec v1-:02201-c3v4- 0D2o5c1u8m-AeTn t   #D: o6c4u-m6 eFnilet d1:1 0  4 F/1ile9d/2 003 P/2a6g/e2 06   o Pf a3g1e P 5a goef I1D5 #:1876\nII.  Analysis \nA. Irreparable Harm \nIn the Second Circuit, a “showing of irreparable harm is the single most important \nprerequisite for the issuance of a preliminary injunction.”  Faiveley Transport Malmo AB v. \nWabtec Corp., 559 F.3d 110, 118 (2d Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nThat harm must be “actual and imminent” rather than speculative.  Id.  \nPetitioners have shown irreparable injury by establishing the risk of harm to their health \nand to their constitutional rights. \n1.  Risk of Death \nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global \npandemic.  Petition ¶ 26.

Jaimie Meyer, M.D., M.S., who has worked extensively on infectious disease treatment \nand prevention in the context of jails and prisons, recently submitted a declaration in this district \nnoting that the risk of COVID-19 to people held in New York-area detention centers, including \nthe Hudson, Bergen, and Essex County Jails, “is significantly higher than in the community, both \nin terms of risk of transmission, exposure, and harm to individuals who become infected.”  \nMeyer Decl. ¶ 7, Velesaca v.

Several recent court rulings have explained the \nhealth risks—to inmates, guards, and the community at large—created by large prison \npopulations.  The chaos has already begun inside federal prisons—inmates and prison employees \nare starting to test positive for the virus, quarantines are being instituted, visits from outsiders \nhave been suspended, and inmate movement is being restricted even more than usual.” (citations \nomitted)); see also Letter from Mike McGrath, Chief Justice, Montana Supreme Court, to \nMontana Courts of Limited Jurisdiction Judges (Mar. 20, 2020), https://courts.mt.gov/Portals/ \n189/virus/Ltr%20to%20COLJ%20Judges%20re%20COVID-19%20032020.pdf?ver=2020-03-\n20-115517-333 (“Because of the high risk of transmittal of COVID-19, not only to prisoners \nwithin correctional facilities but staff and defense attorneys as well, we ask that you review your \njail rosters and release, without bond, as many prisoners as you are able, especially those being \nheld for nonviolent offenses. . . . Due to the confines of [correctional] facilities, it will be \nvirtually impossible to contain the spread of the virus.”).  Indeed, at least one court has ordered \nthe release on bail of a non-citizen in immigration detention on the ground that detention \nconditions have been rendered unsafe by COVID-19.  Calderon Jimenez v. Wolf, No. 18 Civ. \n10225 (D. Mass. Mar. 26, 2020), ECF No. 507.  Addressing the situation in New Jersey \nspecifically, the New Jersey Supreme Court has held that “reduction of county jail populations, \nunder appropriate conditions, is in the public interest to mitigate risks imposed by COVID-19” in \nlight of “the profound risk posed to people in correctional facilities arising from the spread of \nCOVID-19,” and has ordered the release of many individuals serving sentences in New Jersey \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1C:2a0s-cev 1-0:2201-3c4v -D02o5c1u8m-eAnTt   # D: 6o4cu-6m Feinletd 1: 10 4  F/1il9e/d2 00 3P/a2g6e/2 100    oPfa 3g1e  P9a ogfe 1ID5 #:1880\ncounty jails.  In the Matter of the Request to Commute or Suspend County Jail Sentences, Case \nNo. 84230 (N.J. Mar. 22, 2020). \nCourts have also recognized this health risk to be particularly acute—and of \nconstitutional significance—for inmates who are elderly or have underlying illnesses.  See \nUnited States v. Martin, No. 19 Cr. 140-13, 2020 WL 1274857, at *2 (D. Md. Mar. 17, 2020) \n(“[T]he Due Process Clauses of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments, for federal and state \npretrial detainees, respectively, may well be implicated if defendants awaiting trial can \ndemonstrate that they are being subjected to conditions of confinement that would subject them \nto exposure to serious (potentially fatal, if the detainee is elderly and with underlying medical \ncomplications) illness.”).  At least one court has ordered the release on bail of an inmate facing \nextradition on the basis of the risk to his health the pandemic poses.  Matter of Extradition of \nToledo Manrique, No. 19 MJ 71055, 2020 WL 1307109, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 19, 2020) \n(“These are extraordinary times.  The novel coronavirus that began in Wuhan, China, is now a \npandemic.  The nine counties in the San Francisco Bay Area have imposed shelter-in-place \norders in an effort to slow the spread of the contagion.  This Court has temporarily halted jury \ntrials, even in criminal cases, and barred the public from courthouses.  Against this background, \nAlejandro Toledo has moved for release, arguing that at 74 years old he is at risk of serious \nillness or death if he remains in custody.  The Court is persuaded.  The risk that this vulnerable \nperson will contract COVID-19 while in jail is a special circumstance that warrants bail.”).  \nThe risk that Petitioners will face a severe, and quite possibly fatal, infection if they \nremain in immigration detention constitutes irreparable harm warranting a TRO.  See Shapiro v. \nCadman Towers, Inc., 51 F.3d 328, 332 (2d Cir. 1995) (upholding finding of irreparable injury \n“premised . . . upon [the district court’s] finding that [plaintiff] was subject to risk of injury, \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1C:2a0s-ec v1-:02201-c3v4- 0D2o5c1u8m-AeTn t   #D: o6c4u-m6 eFnilet d1:1 0  4 F/1ile9d/2 003 P/2a6g/e2 01 1   Poaf g3e1  1P0a goef I1D5 #:1881\ninfection, and humiliation”); Mayer v. Wing, 922 F. Supp. 902, 909 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (“[T]he \ndeprivation of life-sustaining medical services . . . certainly constitutes irreparable harm.”). \n2.  Constitutional Violations \nSecond, Petitioners have also shown irreparable injury because, as discussed below, they \nface a violation of their constitutional rights.  In the Second Circuit, it is well-settled that an \nalleged constitutional violation constitutes irreparable harm.  See, e.g., Connecticut Dep’t of \nEnvtl. Prot. v. O.S.H.A., 356 F.3d 226, 231 (2d Cir. 2004) (“[W]e have held that the alleged \nviolation of a constitutional right triggers a finding of irreparable injury.” (internal quotation \nmarks and citations omitted)); Statharos v. New York City Taxi & Limousine Comm’n, 198 F.3d \n317, 322 (2d Cir. 1999) (“Because plaintiffs allege deprivation of a constitutional right, no \nseparate showing of irreparable harm is necessary.”); Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 482 (2d Cir. \n1996) (clarifying that “it is the alleged violation of a constitutional right that triggers a finding of \nirreparable harm” and a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of a constitutional \nviolation is not necessary); Sajous v. Decker, No. 18 Civ. 2447, 2018 WL 2357266, at *12 \n(S.D.N.Y. May 23, 2018) (finding that immigration detainee established irreparable injury by \nalleging that prolonged immigration detention violated his constitutional due process rights).   \nThe Court finds, therefore, that Petitioners have established the threat of irreparable harm \nabsent the TRO. \nB.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nThe Court concludes that Petitioners have met their burden of showing a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits.  Petitioners argue that their continued confinement in ICE detention \ncenters where COVID-19 is present and without adequate protection for their health violates \ntheir due process rights.  TRO at 8.  The Court agrees.  \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1C:2a0s-ec v1-:02201-c3v4- 0D2o5c1u8m-AeTn t   #D: o6c4u-m6 eFnilet d1:1 0  4 F/1ile9d/2 003 P/2a6g/e2 01 2   Poaf g3e1  1P1a goef I1D5 #:1882\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution \nforbids the government from depriving a person of life, liberty, or property without due process \nof law.  The protection applies to “all ‘persons’ within the United States, including aliens, \nwhether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent.”  Zadvydas v. Davis, \n533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001).  An application for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 is the \nappropriate vehicle for an inmate in federal custody to challenge conditions or actions that pose a \nthreat to his medical wellbeing.  See Roba v. United States, 604 F.2d 215, 218–19 (2d Cir. 1979) \n(allowing a § 2241 application to challenge an inmate’s “transfer while seriously ill” where that \ntransfer posed a risk of fatal heart failure).   \nImmigration detainees can establish a due process violation for unconstitutional \nconditions of confinement by showing that a government official “knew, or should have known” \nof a condition that “posed an excessive risk to health,” and failed to take appropriate action.  \nDarnell v. Pineiro, 849 F.3d 17, 35 (2d Cir. 2017); Charles v. Orange Cty., 925 F.3d 73, 87 (2d \nCir. 2019) (“Deliberate indifference . . . can be established by either a subjective or objective \nstandard: A plaintiff can prove deliberate indifference by showing that the defendant official \nrecklessly failed to act with reasonable care to mitigate the risk that the condition posed to the \npretrial detainee even though the defendant-official knew, or should have known, that the \ncondition posed an excessive risk to the plaintiff’s health or safety.” (internal quotation marks, \ncitation, and alterations omitted)).  The risk of contracting COVID-19 in tightly-confined spaces, \nespecially jails, is now exceedingly obvious.2  It can no longer be denied that Petitioners, who \n                                                 \n2  Other courts have recognized the heightened risk to detainees of contracting COVID-19.  See, e.g., Xochihua-\nJaimes v. Barr, 18-71460, Doc. No. 53 (9th Cir. Mar. 23, 2020) (unpublished) (“In light of the rapidly escalating \npublic health crisis, which public health authorities predict will especially impact immigration detention centers, the \ncourt sua sponte orders that [p]etitioner be immediately released from detention . . . .”); Stephens, 2020 WL \n1295155, at *2 (ordering “conditions of 24-hour home incarceration and electronic location monitoring”); Chris \nVillani, Releasing ICE Detainee, Judge Says Jail No Safer Than Court, Law360, March 25, 2020 (“We are living in \nthe midst of a coronavirus pandemic, some infected people die, not all, but some infected people die,” U.S. District \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1C:2a0s-ec v1-:02201-c3v4- 0D2o5c1u8m-AeTn t   #D: o6c4u-m6 eFnilet d1:1 0  4 F/1ile9d/2 003 P/2a6g/e2 01 3   Poaf g3e1  1P2a goef I1D5 #:1883\nsuffer from underlying illnesses, are caught in the midst of a rapidly-unfolding public health \ncrisis.  The Supreme Court has recognized that government authorities may be deemed \n“deliberately indifferent to an inmate’s current health problems” where authorities “ignore a \ncondition of confinement that is sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering \nthe next week or month or year,” including “exposure of inmates to a serious, communicable \ndisease,” even when “the complaining inmate shows no serious current symptoms.”  Helling v. \nMcKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993).  Petitioners need not demonstrate that “they actually suffered \nfrom serious injuries” to show a due process violation.  Darnell, 849 F.3d at 31; see Helling, 509 \nU.S. at 33.  Instead, showing that the conditions of confinement “pose an unreasonable risk of \nserious damage to their future health” is sufficient.  Phelps v. Kapnolas, 308 F.3d 180, 185 (2d \nCir. 2002) (quoting Helling, 509 U.S. at 35) (alteration omitted).   \nRespondents have exhibited, and continue to exhibit, deliberate indifference to Petitioners’ \nmedical needs.  The spread of COVID-19 is measured in a matter of a single day—not weeks, \nmonths, or years—and Respondents appear to ignore this condition of confinement that will \nlikely cause imminent, life-threatening illness.  At oral argument, Respondents represented that \nICE and the detention facilities in which Petitioners are housed are taking certain measures to \nprevent the spread of the virus:  screening detainees upon intake for risk factors, isolating \ndetainees who report symptoms, conducting video court appearances with only one detainee in \nthe room at a time, providing soap and hand sanitizer to inmates, and increasing the frequency \nand intensity of cleaning jail facilities.   \nThese measures are patently insufficient to protect Petitioners.  At today’s hearing, \nRespondents could not represent that the detention facilities were in a position to allow inmates \n                                                                                                                                                           \nJudge Wolf said.  “Being in a jail enhances risk.  Social distancing is difficult or impossible, washing hands \nrepeatedly may be difficult.  There is a genuine risk this will spread throughout the jail.”). \n \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1C:2a0s-ec v1-:02201-c3v4- 0D2o5c1u8m-AeTn t   #D: o6c4u-m6 eFnilet d1:1 0  4 F/1ile9d/2 003 P/2a6g/e2 01 4   Poaf g3e1  1P3a goef I1D5 #:1884\nto remain six feet apart from one another, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention (“CDC”).  See How to Protect Yourself, Centers for Disease Control (Mar. 18, \n2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html.  Nor could \nRespondents provide the Court with any information about steps taken to protect high-risk \ndetainees like Petitioners.  And though Respondents represented that the detention facilities are \nbelow their full capacity, the appropriate capacity of a jail during a pandemic obviously differs \nenormously from its appropriate capacity under ordinary circumstances.  Confining vulnerable \nindividuals such as Petitioners without enforcement of requisite social distancing and without \nspecific measures to protect their delicate health “pose[s] an unreasonable risk of serious damage \nto [their] future health,” Phelps, 308 F.3d at 185 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), \nand demonstrates deliberate indifference. \n The Court holds, therefore, that Petitioners are likely to succeed on the merits of their \ndue process claim that Respondents knew or should have known that Petitioners’ conditions of \nconfinement pose excessive risks to their health.3 \nC.  Balance of Equities and Public Interest \nThe equities and public interest weigh heavily in Petitioners’ favor.  First, Petitioners face \nirreparable injury—to their constitutional rights and to their health.  \nSecond, the potential harm to Respondents is limited.  At today’s hearing, Respondents \nwere unable to identify a single specific reason for Petitioners’ continued detention.  And the \nCourt finds that there is none.  Petitioners’ counsel committed to ensuring the continued \nappearance of Petitioners at immigration hearings.  And, of course, Petitioners’ failure to appear \nat those hearings would carry grave consequences for their respective cases.  The Court finds that \n                                                 \n3  The Court does not reach Petitioners’ additional argument that they are likely to succeed on the merits of the claim \nthat their due process rights were violated because their current conditions of confinement are punitive.  TRO at 8–9. \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1C:2a0s-ec v1-:02201-c3v4- 0D2o5c1u8m-AeTn t   #D: o6c4u-m6 eFnilet d1:1 0  4 F/1ile9d/2 003 P/2a6g/e2 01 5   Poaf g3e1  1P4a goef I1D5 #:1885\nthose incentives are sufficient to safeguard Respondents’ interest in Petitioners’ in-person \nparticipation in future immigration court proceedings. \nAt oral argument, Respondents raised the fact that Petitioners Martinez and Pena are \ncurrently mandatorily detained pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1226(c).4  However, courts have the \nauthority to order those detained in violation of their due process rights released, notwithstanding \n§ 1226(c).  See Cabral v. Decker, 331 F. Supp. 3d 255, 259 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (collecting cases).  \nThus, Respondents have failed to justify Petitioners’ continued detention in unsafe conditions.  \nFinally, the public interest favors Petitioners’ release.  Petitioners are confined for civil \nviolations of the immigration laws.  In the highly unusual circumstances posed by the COVID-19 \ncrisis, the continued detention of aging or ill civil detainees does not serve the public’s interest.  \nSee Declaration of Dr. Homer Venters ¶ 12, Fraihat v. U.S. Imm. and Customs Enforcement, \n5:19 Civ. 1546, ECF No. 81-11 (C.D. Cal.

[Doc. # 73.]   \n \nHaving duly considered the parties’ written submissions and oral arguments, the Court \nGRANTS in part and DENIES in part the Ex Parte Application for the reasons set forth below. \n \nI. \nBACKGROUND2 \n \nThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) has reached pandemic status and, without \neffective intervention, the CDC projects it will infect up to 200 million people and cause as many \nas 1.5 million deaths in the United States alone.  TRO App., Ex. A (Peeler Decl.) ¶¶ 5–6 [Doc. \n# 733-3].  Governments and public agencies have taken extraordinary measures to attempt to \ncurtail exponential rates of infection of this highly contagious disease, including school closures \nand “shelter in place” orders covering over 160 million Americans.

Defs.’ Response, Ex. L (“CDC Guidance”) [Doc. # 736-12].4    \n \nOn  March  19,  2020,  ORR  distributed  the  “COVID-19  Interim  Guidance  for  ORR \nPrograms”  (“ORR  Guidance”)  to  its  contracted  care  facilities.    TRO  App.,  Ex.  L  (“ORR \nGuidance”) [Doc. # 773-14].  The ORR Guidance requires (1) planning and coordination with \nlocal hospitals and health departments, (2) enhanced staff and visitor screening for symptoms or \nCOVID-19 risk, (3) identifying children with risk of COVID-19 exposure risk, (4) isolating \nchildren with symptoms or high risk if possible, and (5) releasing children from custody only once \nthey have been medically cleared by a physician or ORR has been consulted.  Id.  ORR has since \nupdated its practices regarding COVID-19, as described in more detail below.  See generally Defs’ \nResponse, Ex. A (Sualog Decl.) [Doc. # 736-1].  A CDC COVID-19 specialist has advised that \n“ORR’s current COVID-19 procedures are consistent with CDC guidances for congregate settings; \nthey  direct  grantee  care-provider  facilities  to  implement  both  containment  and  mitigation \nmeasures.  In some respects, ORR’s current COVID-19 procedures actually exceed those set forth \nin the CDC guidances to congregate care facilities.”  Defs.’ Response, Ex.

The Guidance does suggest, however, that administrators of juvenile \nfacilities adapt the CDC Guidance to suit their needs.  Id. at 4.  \n \n5 This statement compares ORR’s procedures to CDC’s guidances for long-term care facilities such as nursing \nhomes, not to the CDC guidance for detention facilities.

ICE has suspended \nsocial visitation to its three Family Residential Centers (“FRCs”) where Class Members and their \nfamily members are held, and offered virtual legal visitation.  Peeler Decl. ¶ 16; TRO App., Ex. J \n(Meza Decl.) ¶ 14 [Doc. # 733-12]; Defs.’ Ex. M, (Johnson Decl.) ¶¶ 21, 24 [Doc. # 736-13].

ICE is screening \nvisitors, testing detainees with symptoms for COVID-19, and transporting detainees who require \nhigher levels of monitoring and care to appropriate hospitals.  Johnson Decl. ¶¶ 10, 22–23.

Sualog Decl. ¶ 38.  There were four confirmed cases among minors in ORR care \nprovider facilities, all in one facility in New York, and 18 minors have been tested.

According to ICE, as of March \n26, 2020, there are two confirmed cases of COVID-19 among ICE detainees, three confirmed cases \namong  ICE  personnel  working  in  detention  facilities,  and  19  confirmed  cases  among  ICE \nemployees not assigned to detention facilities.  See ICE Guidance.  \n \n  Plaintiffs now argue that ORR’s and ICE’s response to the coronavirus pandemic violates \ntheir contractual obligations under the Flores Settlement Agreement (“FSA” or “Agreement”) and \nseek a TRO requiring ORR and ICE to promptly release eligible Class Members, record the \nagencies’  reasons  for  not  promptly  releasing  Class  Members,  and  implement  the  CDC’s \nrecommendations for managing COVID-19 in detention facilities.   \n \n                                                 \nsettings where numerous people sleep, eat, bathe, and participate in daily activities in close quarters, and by definition, \nis incompatible with social distancing.

Flores, et al. v. William P. Barr, et al.  Page  4 of 15 \n   \n \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n \n  TROs are governed by the same standard applicable to preliminary injunctions.  Niu v. \nUnited States, 821 F. Supp.2d 1164, 1167 (C.D. Cal. 2011) (internal quotation omitted); see also \nStuhlbarg Int’l Sales Co. v. John D. Brush & Co., 240 F.3d 832, 839 n.7 (9th Cir. 2001).  A plaintiff \nseeking preliminary injunctive relief must show that:  (1) they are likely to succeed on the merits; \n(2) they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) the balance \nof equities tips in their favor; and (4) an injunction is in the public interest.  Toyo Tire Holdings of \nAms. Inc. v. Cont’l Tire N. Am., Inc., 609 F.3d 975, 982 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing Winter v. Nat. Res. \nDef. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)).  An injunction is also appropriate when a plaintiff raises \n“serious questions going to the merits,” demonstrates that “the balance of hardships tips sharply in \n[their] favor,” and “shows that there is a likelihood of irreparable injury and that the injunction is \nin the public interest.”  All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th Cir. 2011) \n(quoting Lands Council v. McNair, 537 F.3d 981, 987 (9th Cir. 2008)).  In the Ninth Circuit, the \nfour “elements of the preliminary injunction test are balanced, so that a stronger showing of one \nelement may offset a weaker showing of another.”  Id. at 1131.  \n  \nIII. \nDISCUSSION \n \nA.  Likelihood of success on the merits \n \nPlaintiffs argue that they have shown likelihood of success on the merits of their claims \nthat ORR and ICE have failed to comply with their obligations under the FSA to “release a minor \nfrom its custody without unnecessary delay” and “make and record the prompt and continuous \nefforts on its part toward family reunification and the release of the minor,” as well as their \nobligation to keep Class Members “in facilities that are safe and sanitary and that are consistent \nwith [their] concern for the particular vulnerability of minors.”  Flores Agreement ¶¶ 12, 14, 18 \n[Doc. # 101].  To protect Class Members’ rights under the Agreement, Plaintiffs seek (1) the \nprompt release of minors who are neither a flight risk nor a danger and minors who have a suitable \ncustodian, as well as placement of minors in non-congregate settings if possible and up-to-date \nreporting on the justifications for keeping minors in custody, and (2) ORR and ICE’s prompt \nimplementation of public health strategies recommended by the CDC to protect people that remain \nin congregate settings in detention.  Plaintiffs also seek enforcement of the Flores Agreement’s \nprovision requiring that Defendants make and record their continuous efforts toward releasing \nindividual Class Members.   \n \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCaCsaes 2e::8 15:-2c0v--c0v4-504241-3D4M DGo-cAuGmRen   tD #o: c6u4m-6e Fnitl e7d4:0 0  4 F/1il9e/d2 00 3P/2a8g/e2 02 1   Pofa 3g1e  P5 aogf e1I5D   # P:1a8g9e1 ID\n #:34489\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 85-4544-DMG (AGRx)  Date  March 28, 2020 \n   \nTitle  Jenny L. Flores, et al. v. William P. Barr, et al.  Page  5 of 15 \n   \n \nIt is beyond dispute at this point in this litigation that the FSA is a consent decree that is \nconstrued as a contract.  See, e.g., Flores v. Sessions, 862 F.3d 863, 874 (9th Cir. 2017); Order re \nPls.’ Mot. to Enforce at 3 [Doc. # 177]; Order re Pls.’ Mot. to Enforce & Appoint a Special Monitor \nat 2–4 [Doc. # 363].  The Court incorporates the legal standards that it articulated in its July 24, \n2015 Order and June 27, 2017 Order and need not repeat them here.  [Doc. ## 177, 363.]   \n \nFor the reasons stated below, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have shown serious questions \nas to the merits of their claim that ICE has breached the FSA with regard to the provision of safe \nand sanitary conditions and appropriate medical care and living accommodations in the context of \nthe COVID-19 outbreak.  The Court further finds that Plaintiffs have a strong likelihood of \nsucceeding on their claim that both ICE and ORR have breached the FSA in their failure to release \nminors to suitable custodians in a prompt manner and to record their continuous efforts towards \nminors’ release. \n \n1.  Safe and sanitary conditions and appropriate medical care \n \nThe  Court  has  previously  held,  with  regard  to  CBP  temporary  facilities,  that  the \nAgreement’s requirement for safe and sanitary conditions covers an array of basic hygiene and \nhealth needs such as soap, toothbrushes, regulated temperatures, and conditions in which Class \nMembers can sleep.  See Flores v. Sessions, 394 F. Supp. 3d 1041, 1057, 1059, 1061 (C.D. Cal. \n2017); see also Flores v. Barr, 934 F.3d 910, 916 (9th Cir. 2019) (“We note that, as the district \ncourt properly understood, assuring ‘safe and sanitary’ conditions includes protecting children \nfrom developing short- or long-term illnesses as well as protecting them from accidental or \nintentional injury.”).  In addition to requiring safe and sanitary conditions with the particular \nvulnerabilities of minors in mind, Exhibit 1 to the FSA also specifies that minors detained in \nlicensed programs shall receive, inter alia, “suitable living accommodations, . . . [a]ppropriate \nroutine medical . . . care, . . . emergency health care services, . . . screening for infectious [disease] \nwithin 48 hours of admission  . . .  [and] immunizations in accordance with the U.S. Public Health \nService (PHS), Center for Disease Control.”  Settlement Exhibit 1, ¶ A.1.  There is no dispute that \nORR care facilities and ICE FRCs are covered by Exhibit 1.7    \n \n                                                 \n7 Defendants argue that Paragraph 12 of the FSA, which provides for the requirement that “[f]ollowing arrest, \nthe INS shall hold minors in facilities that are safe and sanitary,” does not apply to ORR’s care facilities, which are \nlicensed facilities designed for longer-term custody of Class Members, or to the one ICE FRC that is state-licensed.  \nDefs.’ Response at 25.  The Court need not decide at this time whether Paragraph 12 also applies to ORR facilities \nand one of the three ICE FRCs because those issues have not been fully addressed in a prior motion, and the Court \nneed not address it in order to resolve the TRO.  Moreover, there can be no dispute that other provisions of the FSA \nspeak to the need to protect detained minors’ safety and well-being.

Page  6 of 15 \n   \n \nMedical experts fear the exceptionally rapid transmission of COVID-19 in detention \nfacilities, where medical resources such as physicians, testing kits, and protective equipment are \nconstrained; people are unable to practice social distancing; shared facilities are not frequently or \nproperly sanitized; soap and hand sanitizer are not provided or easily accessible to detainees; \nquarantine or isolation units are scarce; and there are frequent opportunities for an infected person \nto enter or leave the facility.  See, e.g., Peeler Decl. ¶¶ 19–25; Haney Decl. ¶¶ 7–11; TRO App., \nEx. D (Meyer Decl.) ¶¶ 8–15.  For migrant children in detention, who are already more likely to \nhave mental health concerns or may be separated from their family members, the trauma of \nundergoing solitary quarantine for the virus or simply not receiving adequate information about \nthe potential for infection is likely to exacerbate existing mental health concerns.

F  (Zein  Decl.)  at  2–3  [Doc.  #  733-8].  \nFurthermore, a high concentration of sick children, family members, and/or staff members in one \ncommunity may overwhelm already strained local health care resources, particularly in the rural \ncommunities where many ICE and ORR facilities are located.  Peeler Decl. ¶ 28.  Examples from \nprior epidemics and recent prison outbreaks of COVID-19 confirm these medical experts’ fears.  \nPeeler Decl. ¶¶ 30–31, 33.  And, although children thus far appear less susceptible to COVID-19 \nthan adults, they may still carry and transmit the coronavirus, and common health concerns \naffecting many Class Members, such as asthma, malnutrition, and immunosuppression, may make \nthem more susceptible to serious forms of the disease.  Peeler Decl. ¶ 8; Graves Decl. ¶ 11.  \nAccordingly, experts recommend reducing the size of the population within detention facilities to \npermit children to be in the custody of family sponsors or to be released with their families and \nthereby lessen the resource constraints and likelihood of overwhelming contagion in the less-\ncrowded facilities.

ORR also responds that it now:  (1) has stopped placements in New York, \nCalifornia, and Washington (states with significant coronavirus outbreaks); (2) has limited air \ntravel to local placements; (3) requires all care providers to conduct temperature checks for every \nClass Member in its care twice each day; (4) elevates all medical cases with flu-like symptoms; \n                                                 \n8 Defendants’ objections to these physicians’ opinions are OVERRULED, to the extent that the Court finds \nthe opinions reliable and based on expertise and personal knowledge.

Recent CDC \norders prohibiting the entrance of unaccompanied children into the United States will also likely \ndecrease ORR’s custodial population.  Cohn Decl. ¶ 23.   \n \n  Though the Court recognizes that the limited facts before it do not describe the conditions \nat all of ORR’s 107 diverse facilities nationwide, the parties have presented sufficient information \nfor the Court to conclude at this time that ORR appears to be in substantial compliance with its \nFSA obligations to implement CDC-compliant guidelines and to provide adequate routine medical \ncare and adequate living accommodations.   \n \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs have not shown a likelihood of success on the merits as to this part \nof their claim against ORR.  \n \nBy contrast, the ICE Guidance appears deficient.  The ICE Guidance asserts that it was \nupdated on March 26, 2020 and that ICE implements CDC recommendations, but the section on \nits website about how it is specifically addressing conditions in detention has not been updated \nsince March 15, 2020, and does not mention social distancing, increased personal hygiene, or \nincreased testing and medical care.

Page  8 of 15 \n   \n \npotential  psychological  harm  of  quarantining  or  isolating  children  for  the  duration  of  this \npandemic.   \n \nRecent  observations  of  ICE  family  residential  centers  (“FRCs”)  show  uneven \nimplementation of the recommended public health measures.  An attorney at Karnes noted that as \nof March 23, 2020, the facility was attempting to implement social distancing measures such as \nlimiting groups to 10 or fewer people, school closure, and meal delivery.  Meza Decl. ¶ 38.  But \nattorneys working in Berks County Residential Facility (“Berks”) and South Texas FRC in Dilley, \nTexas (“Dilley”), personally observed that children, family members, and staff continue to spend \nthe vast majority of their time in close physical proximity, and reports from detained minors and \ntheir family members indicate that large proportions of them have conditions that render them \nvulnerable to COVID-19 and/or already show symptoms associated with COVID-19 and that they \nlack information about COVID-19, access to hand sanitizer, cleaning supplies, personal protective \nequipment, and medical care.  See, e.g., App., Ex.

Now, it asserts that Berks, Dilley, and Karnes are implementing the public \nhealth measures that Plaintiffs requested in their TRO application.  In summary, as of March 27, \n2020, the FRCs are increasing the availability of hand sanitizers and soap and adding new \nsanitizing stations throughout the FRCs; conducting more frequent cleaning and deep cleaning in \nareas where residents congregate; suspended school and educational programs per statewide orders \nin  Pennsylvania  and  Texas;  employing  extra  screening  measures;  employing  staggered  or \n“satellite” meals to ensure greater social distancing at mealtime; limiting gatherings to small \ngroups  in  common  areas;  encouraging  families  to  stay  in  their  own  residential  areas;  and \ncoordinating telephonic legal representation.  Johnson Decl. ¶¶ 16, 18–22, 24, 27–29.  \n \nThough laggardly in its early response, as of two days ago ICE appears to have announced \nits implementation of CDC guidance during the COVID-19 outbreak.  Given the current state of \nthe evidence and ICE’s only recent promulgation of some CDC recommendations in its FRCs, the \nCourt finds that Plaintiffs have raised serious questions as to the merits of their claim that ICE is \nnot compliant with its FSA obligations in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak.  \n \n                                                 \n10 Defendants’ objections to Fluharty’s, Meza’s, and Cambria’s declarations are OVERRULED, to the extent \nthat the Court relies on the attorneys’ personal observations.  Considering the difficulty of obtaining non-hearsay \ntestimony from detainees even without the physical constraints of this pandemic and lack of any other evidence \nregarding on-the-ground conditions in the FRCs, the Court accords appropriate weight to hearsay observations by \nClass Members and their families.

Page  9 of 15 \n   \n \nConsidering the Court’s past orders, the exigencies of the circumstances, COVID-19’s \nhighly contagious nature, and the imminence of the threat, the Court invokes its authority, as \ndescribed in the October 5, 2018 Order Appointing Special Master/Independent Monitor [Doc. \n# 494], to require heightened inspections of ICE facilities and, to a more limited extent, ORR \nfacilities to ensure the existence of safe and sanitary conditions.  See October 5, 2018 Order at \n¶¶ A, B.   \n \n2.  Release without unnecessary delay and recording efforts toward release \n \nIn 2019, children in ORR custody remained in that agency’s care for an average of 66 \ndays.11    Office  of  Refugee  Resettlement,  Facts  and  Data:  Length  of  Care, \nhttps://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/about/ucs/facts-and-data (last visited March 27, 2020).  In addition to \nits obligations under the Flores Agreement, ORR is tasked by the William Wilberforce Trafficking \nVictims Protection Reauthorization Act (“TVPRA”) to ensure that any sponsor is “capable of \nproviding for the child’s physical and mental well-being.” 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(3)(A).  This Court \nhas previously found that some of ORR’s policies, even if they result in delays in releasing minors \nto adult custodians, “appear to be reasonably calculated to protect Class Members from ‘harm or \nneglect’ and to ensure that they have an adequate ‘standard of care.’”  Flores v. Sessions, No. CV \n85-4544-DMG (AGRx), 2018 WL 10162328, at *18 (C.D. Cal. July 30, 2018) (quoting Agreement \nat ¶¶ 11, 17).  But the change in factual circumstances now requires a reexamination of whether \nORR’s continued custody of children in congregate settings meets the Agreement’s requirement \nthat Class Members be released without unnecessary delay.   \n \nAs of March 13, 2020, ORR had 3,622 minors in custody, 1,193 of whom were in \ncongregate settings after having been detained for 30 days or more.  TRO App., Schey Decl. ¶ 3 \n[Doc  #  733-2].    According  to  fairly  recent  data  provided  by  Defendants  to  Plaintiffs  and \nsubsequently analyzed the Dr. Nancy Wang, Professor of Emergency Medicine at Stanford \nUniversity Medical Center, as of December 31, 2019, of the 4,562 minors still in custody at that \ntime, nearly half of them had been in custody for less than 20 days, but 11.6 percent had been in \ncustody for 31-60 days and—incredibly—11.7 percent had been in custody for six months to one \nyear.  TRO App., Ex. P (ORR Data) at 9, 21 [Doc. # 738].  ORR’s data do not indicate why the \nagency failed to release these minors or how many of them have sponsors.12  According to the \n                                                 \n11 The Court takes judicial notice of the cited ORR website.  \n \n12 Although Dr. Wang’s analysis and data from 2018 indicates that the vast majority of children in ORR’s \ncare had close family members available as custodians, neither party has provided more updated information about \nthe availability of custodians for ORR’s current care population.

Flores, et al. v. William P. Barr, et al.  Page  10 of 15 \n   \n \nDilley Pro Bono Project’s records of Dilley residents, as of March 25, 2020, at least 22 minors \nhave been detained more than 160 days, 10 have been detained for over 200 days, seven have been \ndetained for more than 220 days, and one has been detained for 229 days.  Fluharty Decl. ¶ 50.  \nORR’s apparent failure to “make and record the prompt and continuous efforts on its part toward \n. . . the release of the minor” makes it more difficult to ascertain how many of the minors’ releases \nto suitable custodians have been delayed without good reason.  Agreement at ¶ 18; see also Flores \nv. Sessions, 2018 WL 10162328, at *21 (finding that the Agreement requires individualized \nassessments of whether a sponsor is a fit custodian and that requiring the ORR director’s approval \nof certain Class Members’ release violated the Agreement).  Accordingly, though ORR may have \njustifications under the TVPRA for delaying release, Plaintiffs have raised serious questions going \nto the merits of their claim that ORR is in violation of the FSA’s recording requirement.   \n \nAs for ICE, the agency explains that its decisions to release class members depend on \nvarious factors, including the applicable detention authority, the status of any removal, credible \nfear, or reasonable fear proceedings, judicial or administrative stays, and humanitarian factors.  \nDefs.’ Response at 23–24.  Those decisions may be complicated by the fact that the FSA does not \ncontain any affirmative right of release for adults in immigration detention with their children.  \nFlores v. Lynch, 828 F.3d 898, 909 (9th Cir. 2016).  But the Court reminds Defendants—yet \nagain—that “hold[ing] minors in indefinite detention in unlicensed facilities, . . . constitute[s] a \nfundamental and material breach of the parties’ Agreement.”  Flores v. Sessions, No. CV 85-4544-\nDMG (AGRx), 2018 WL 4945000, at *2 (C.D. Cal. July 9, 2018).  ICE therefore must still comply \nwith the Agreement’s requirement to release minors without unnecessary delay and “make and \nrecord the prompt and continuous efforts on its part toward family reunification and the release of \nthe minor.”  Agreement ¶¶ 12, 14.  And, \n \n[t]o  be  clear,  the  Court  will  not  dictate  how  Defendants  must  exercise  their \ndiscretion to parole or release minors in every single case—instead, the Court will \norder Defendants to comply with the unambiguous charge of the Flores Agreement \nto make individualized determinations regarding a minor’s flight risk rather than \nblanket determinations.  \n \nFlores v. Sessions, 394 F. Supp. 3d 1041, 1067 (C.D. Cal. 2017). \n \nPlaintiffs have provided evidence to indicate that ICE does not undertake or record any \nefforts aimed at the release of minors as required by Paragraphs 14 and 18 of the Agreement.  \nSchey Decl. ¶ 7; Cambria Decl. ¶ 39; Fluharty Decl. ¶ 38–40; Meza Decl. ¶¶ 10, 43.

Page  11 of 15 \n   \n \nMore than half of those class members—1,861—have been detained for three months or longer.  \nOf those class members, two were apprehended in 2014, four were apprehended in 2018, dozens \nhave been detained for between ten to twelve months, and hundreds have been in custody for four \nmonths or more.  Id. at ¶ 4.  Though Defendants argue that these numbers are inaccurate, they are \nunable to provide any evidence of more accurate numbers within the time frame necessary to \nresolve this TRO application.  Defs’ Response at 23.  Without any contrary data, the Court finds \nthat Plaintiffs have shown a strong likelihood of success on their claim that ICE has not undertaken \nor recorded efforts to promptly release the Class Members in its custody.   \n \nDefendants argue that the data Plaintiffs request from ICE is already covered by the Court’s \nOctober 5, 2018 Order Appointing Special Master/Independent Monitor, [Doc. # 494].  The \nMonitor is, inter alia, tasked with monitoring ICE’s compliance with the Court’s June 27, 2017 \nOrder [Doc. # 363], which found that ICE violated Paragraphs 14 and 18 of the FSA by failing to \nmake and record continuous efforts to release Class Members and place them in non-secure, \nlicensed facilities.  See Order Appointing Special Master/Independent Monitor at 4–5 [Doc. # 494].  \nIn fact, the Monitor is also tasked with monitoring ORR’s compliance with the Court’s July 30, \n2018 Order [Doc. # 470], in which the Court found ORR unnecessarily delayed the release of Class \nMembers to custodians in violation of Paragraph 14 and 18 of the FSA.  Id. at 5.  The Monitor thus \nalready has the authority to request “database” information for all Class Members, including the \n“dates, locations, and reasons for all transfers of Class Members” and, if the Class Member was \nnot transferred to a licensed facility or released within 20 days, the reason why.  Id. at ¶ B.1.c.i.  \nOn top of the information already within the Monitor’s purview, however, Plaintiffs also request \nsome information about what efforts ICE and ORR are making to ensure Class Members’ prompt \nrelease and why each Class Member is remaining in custody.  This global pandemic appears to be \nthe type of emergency in which the Court may waive the time periods for the dispute resolution \nprocedure set forth in the Order Appointing the Special Master/Independent Monitor.  Id. at 24.   \n \n  Because COVID-19 poses unprecedented threats to the safety of Class Members and all \nwho come in contact with them, including ORR and ICE staff, healthcare providers, and local \npopulations, the Court finds that any unexplained delay in releasing a child in ORR and ICE \ncustody violates of Paragraphs 14 and 18 of the FSA, which require the agencies to release Class \nMembers in their custody without unnecessary delay and make and record efforts to release the \nClass Members.  This finding is bolstered by the Court’s longstanding orders construing and \nmandating compliance with paragraphs 14 and 18 due to past violations.  See July 24, 2015 Order \n[Doc. # 177]; June 27, 2017 Order [Doc. # 363]; July 30, 2018 Order [Doc. # 470].

Flores, et al. v. William P. Barr, et al.  Page  12 of 15 \n   \n \nB.   Irreparable harm, public interest, and balance of the equities \n \n  Based on the foregoing discussion of the near-certainty of the rapid spread of COVID-19 \nin ICE and ORR facilities, even if ORR and ICE take more urgent preventative measures, Plaintiffs \nhave demonstrated that “they themselves are likely to suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction” \nthat may aid in securing their release.  Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n v. Nat’l Marine Fisheries Serv., 886 \nF.3d 803, 822 (9th Cir. 2018); see also Unknown Parties v. Johnson, No. CV-15-00250-TUC \n(DCBx), 2016 WL 8188563, at *15 (D. Ariz. No. 18, 2016), aff’d sub nom Doe v. Kelly, 878 F.3d \n710 (9th Cir. 2017) (finding irreparable harm where the evidence demonstrated “medical risks \nassociated with . . . being exposed to communicable diseases”).  As Plaintiffs’ counsel noted at the \nhearing, having information about delays in Class Members’ release from ORR and ICE custody \ncan help expedite their release from congregate settings that medical experts agree are hotbeds for \ncontagion.       \n \n  The severity of the harm to which Plaintiffs are exposed and the public’s interest in \npreventing outbreaks of COVID-19 among families and children in ICE or ORR custody that will \ninfect ICE and ORR staff, spread to others in geographic proximity, and likely overwhelm local \nhealthcare systems tips the balance of equities sharply in Plaintiffs’ favor.  See Stormans, Inc. v. \nSelecky, 586 F.3d 1109, 1138 (9th Cir. 2009).  Any countervailing financial and administrative \nconcerns do not outweigh public health and safety in the midst of pandemic, particularly given the \nlimited scope of the temporary relief that the Court will grant.  See Hernandez v. Sessions, 872 \nF.3d 976, 996 (9th Cir. 2017) (“Faced with such a conflict between financial concerns and \npreventable human suffering, we have little difficulty concluding that the balance of hardships tips \ndecidedly in plaintiffs’ favor.” (quoting Lopez v. Heckler, 713 F.2d 1432, 1437 (9th Cir. 1983)).   \n \n  The Court agrees with Defendants, however, that the interests of all parties and the public \nare not well served at this time  by rushing to release minors en masse  in the midst of the current \ntravel restrictions or to release them to potentially unfit custodians based on limited information, \nparticularly given the possibility of contagion via public transportation, or introducing healthy \nchildren to homes where they could be at a higher risk of infection.  See Cohn Decl. ¶ 22; Sualog \nDecl. ¶¶ 42–44.13  Furthermore, given the individualized circumstances of each family and each \nunaccompanied minor’s potential sponsor, the Court does not find that ordering ORR and ICE to \nimmediately release hundreds or even thousands of minors is appropriate on a class-wide basis.  \n                                                 \n13 The Court is aware that some experts believe that release is safer for children than congregate care.  See, \ne.g., Lucas R. TRO App., Supplemental Declaration of Julie DeAun Graves [Doc. # 231-3].  While that may be true \nas a general matter and therefore supports the FSA’s general policy favoring release, the Court is also aware that in \nthe real world not all “homes” are equal.  Defendants must promptly fulfill their duty under both the FSA and the \nTVPRA to make determinations of suitable placement. \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCaCsea s2e:8: 51-:2cv0--0c4v-504241-3D4M DGo-cAuGmRe n  Dt #o:c 6u4m-6e nFti l7e4d0:  0  4F/i1le9d/2 003 P/2a8g/2e0 2  9 P oaf g3e1  1P3a ogfe 1ID5  #  :P1a8g9e9 ID\n #:34497\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 85-4544-DMG (AGRx)  Date  March 28, 2020 \n   \nTitle  Jenny L. Flores, et al. v. William P. Barr, et al.  Page  13 of 15 \n   \n \nBased on the comments of Plaintiffs’ counsel at the hearing, it appears that Plaintiffs also agree \nthat an orderly, yet prompt, disposition of minors’ claims of suitable placement is a responsible \nway to proceed. \n \nPursuant to the clear terms of the FSA and the Court’s prior Orders, ORR and ICE are \nalready obligated to release Class Members without unnecessary delay.  Accordingly, the balance \nof equities still weighs in favor of granting Plaintiffs interim relief.  While the Court will not order \nimmediate release of minors on a class-wide basis, the Court will order ORR and ICE to show \ncause why they should not be held to answer for unexplained delays in releasing eligible Class \nMembers.14 \n \nThus,  paying  “particular  regard  [to]  the  public  consequences  in  employing  the \nextraordinary remedy of injunction,” the Court finds that Plaintiffs have met their burden to show \nentitlement to temporary injunctive relief, as delineated below, due to the exigencies of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic.  Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 312 (1982).   \n \nC.  Bond \n   \nRule 65(c) permits a court to grant preliminary injunctive relief “only if the movant gives \nsecurity in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by \nany party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.”  Notwithstanding its seemingly \nmandatory language, “Rule 65(c) invests the district court with discretion as to the amount of \nsecurity required, if any.”  Johnson v. Couturier, 572 F.3d 1067, 1086 (9th Cir. 2009) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).   \n \nBased on the record before it and the composition of the class, the Court waives the bond \nrequirement.   \n \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n \nIn light of the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ TRO Application is GRANTED in part as follows: \n \n1.  Defendants are hereby ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE by April 10, 2020 at 10:00 a.m. \nwhy a preliminary injunction should not issue (1) requiring Defendants to make and record \n                                                 \n14 ORR has already submitted some information that may explain delays in the release of some Class \nMembers, such as the coronavirus-related closure of fingerprinting sites that are key to completing TVPRA-required \nbackground checks.

David Weisman \n  Defendant-Respondent.      )  Magistrate Judge \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO  \nDEFENDANT’S MOTION TO STAY AND TO STRIKE \n \n  Plaintiffs, by their undersigned attorneys and per this Court’s order (Doc. No. 101), submit \nthe following response in opposition to the Sheriff’s motion to stay proceedings pending appeal of \nthe Preliminary Injunction Order and to strike Plaintiffs’ discovery requests for lack of jurisdiction.  \nINTRODUCTION \n \n  More than three weeks after this Court entered its preliminary injunction, and more than a \nweek after the Sheriff filed his notice of appeal, the Sheriff has asked this Court to issue a stay \nthat, practically speaking, stops this case in its tracks so that the Sheriff can pursue review in the \nCourt of Appeals, which has suspended briefing until the Sheriff addresses the Seventh Circuit’s \nconcerns over its jurisdiction.1  The Sheriff’s motion fails to articulate any persuasive grounds \nfor granting his request.  He has not articulated even a plausible likelihood of success on the \nmerits.  Both the timing and the contents of his motion defeat any credible argument that the \nSheriff will suffer irreparable harm absent a stay.  And the Sheriff fails to acknowledge in any \n \n1   Were the Sheriff genuine in his contention that he will suffer irreparable harm if a stay is not \nentered, Plaintiffs would expect that he would already have addressed the Seventh Circuit’s concerns \nregarding jurisdiction and requested an expedited briefing schedule. \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 102-1 Filed: 05/20/20 Page 2 of 20 PageID #:2902\nmeaningful fashion the substantial harm that the Sheriff’s request would impose on Plaintiffs, \nwhose very lives are at stake should the Preliminary Injunction be undone.   The request to stay \nshould be denied.  \nThe Sheriff’s stay motion is also aimed, once again, at preventing Plaintiffs and the class \nthey represent from investigating the true conditions inside the Cook County Jail.  Over the past \nweeks, Plaintiffs have amassed voluminous evidence of non-compliance, including the Sheriff’s \nown admissions and declarations submitted on behalf of correctional officers and detainees—\nevidence that the Sheriff consistently and disrespectfully denigrates.2  Further evidence \nsubmitted here shows that life in the Jail is not as the Sheriff describes.  Declaration of Detainees \n(Ex. A hereto).  This is of particular concern in light of new statistical evidence concerning the \npopulation of detainees:  1000 individuals are incarcerated, in the dangerous conditions, because \nthey cannot pay a monetary bail amount, including over 100 who are incarcerated for inability to \npay $1,000 or less.  See Dec. of Sarah Staudt (Ex. B hereto).   Many others are jailed awaiting \ntrial on misdemeanors or on Class 4, non-forcible felonies.  Id.  \nIn short, conditions at the Jail remain dire. And the Sheriff has failed, again, to suggest \nwhy Plaintiffs have not met good cause for expedited discovery into what the Sheriff is doing to \nprotect people’s lives.  As the Court retains jurisdiction over enforcement of its own order, the \n \n2   The Sheriff takes issue with the reliability of the Plaintiffs’ submission of detainee declarations, \nwhich provide the parties and the Court with some insight into life behind the walls of the Jail during this \npandemic.  The lone case the Sheriff cites for this dismissive argument provides no support to his \nposition.  In Hudson v. Preckwinkle, the district court took issue with the expert’s “heavy reliance” on \nunsworn declarations.  Hudson v. Preckwinkle, 2015 WL 1541787, at *11 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 31, 2015).  Far \nfrom stating that such declarations have no place before a district court, the court in Hudson wrote that \nreliance on such declarations was just one factor that went to the weight of the expert’s conclusions.  Id.  For \nthe Sheriff to dismiss the detainee declarations as non-probative, while at the same time resisting formal \ndiscovery mechanisms at every turn, suggests the Sheriff believes his actions are beyond review.  \n  \n \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 102-1 Filed: 05/20/20 Page 3 of 20 PageID #:2903\nSheriff’s motion to strike should also be denied.  \nARGUMENT \n  \nI.         THE DISTRICT COURT RETAINS JURISDICTION OVER ENFORCEMENT \nOF  THE  PRELIMINARY  INJUNCTION  SO  THAT  THE  MOTION  TO \nSTRIKE IS UNFOUNDED. \n  \nThis Court has jurisdiction to order discovery into the Sheriff’s compliance with the \npreliminary injunction, and to enter orders regarding the Sheriff’s lack of compliance. Union Oil \nCo. of Calif. v. Leavell, 220 F.3d 562, 565-66 (7th Cir. 2000) (citing Charles Alan Wright, Arthur \nR. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, 16 Fed. Prac. & Proc. Juris. § 3921.2 (2d ed. 1996)); Chrysler \nMotors Corp. v. Int’l Union, Allied Indus. Workers of Am., AFL-CIO, 909 F.2d 248, 250 (7th Cir. \n1990).  In Union Oil, the Seventh Circuit held that a party’s notice of appeal of an interlocutory \ninjunction “does not stay enforcement of a district court’s order. . . . A notice of appeal divests the \ndistrict court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal, but whether the \naddress of an injunction has complied is not a subject involved in the appeal.” 220 F.3d at 565-66 \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (emphasis in original); Chrysler Motors Corp., \n909 F.2d at 250 (“An interlocutory appeal does not divest the district court of jurisdiction . . . to \ndetermine whether the [the plaintiff] violated the injunction”); Planned Parenthood of Wisc., Inc. \nv. Van Hollen, 2013 WL 12233948, at *1-2 (W.D. Wis. Aug. 15, 2013) (permitting discovery to \nproceed despite pending appeal of preliminary injunction, but staying trial date).  This is a \ncommonsense  application  of  the  law—to  hold  otherwise  would  invite  a  party  to  flout  an \ninjunction’s terms merely by filing an appeal.   \nYet, Defendant argues this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain Plaintiffs’ request for \nevidence, relying solely on Bradford-Scott Data Corp. v. Physician Computer Network, 128 F.3d \n504, 505 (7th Cir. 1997) for this position.  But the Seventh Circuit’s opinion actually supports the \n  3 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 102-1 Filed: 05/20/20 Page 4 of 20 PageID #:2904\nexercise of jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ discovery requests (as well as over any additional relief \nthat may stem from the answers to those requests).  Bradford-Scott holds that district courts retain \njurisdiction to “conduct proceedings looking toward permanent injunctive relief while an appeal \nabout the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction is pending.” Bradford-Scott Data Corp., 128 \nF.3d at 505; see also Wisc. Mut. Ins. Co. v. United States, 441 F.3d 502, 504 (7th Cir. 2006) (rule \nthat filing of a notice of appeal divests the district court of jurisdiction of aspects of the case \ninvolved in the appeal “has several qualifications . . . perhaps the foremost of which is that an \nappeal taken from an interlocutory decision does not prevent the district court from finishing its \nwork”).  \nDefendant further avoids the straightforward teachings of Seventh Circuit precedent by \narguing that Plaintiffs’ request for discovery constitutes, in effect, a request for modification of the \nexisting preliminary injunction.  Def. Mot. at 7.  The law is to the contrary.  Plaintiffs have already \nprovided significant support for the proposition that they are entitled to discovery into the Sheriff’s \ncompliance with the Court’s injunctive order.  See Doc. No. 93-1.3  Those cases are in line with \nRule 26(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which expressly permits courts to enter orders \nmodifying the timing and sequence of discovery.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(d)(1)-(3); Restoration \nHardware, Inc. v. Haynes Furniture Co., 2017 WL 3597518, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 13, 2017) \n(recognizing that Rule 26(d) authorizes a court to order expedited discovery); Ibarra v. City of \nChicago, 816 F. Supp. 2d 541, 554 (N.D. Ill. 2011) (same).  \n \n3   Defendant’s brief, Def. Mot. at 8, n. 2, states that he was unable to access the cases cited by \nPlaintiffs in their reply brief, Doc. No. 93-1, that support this position: United States v. Chappelle, No. \n118CV00943RLYTAB, 2019 WL 549379 (S.D. Ind. Jan. 4, 2019); United States v. Jackson, No. 1:18-CV-\n2000, 2018 WL 2731224 (N.D. Ill. May 17, 2018); United States v. U.S. Contracting, LLC, No. 1:15-CV-\n01536-WCG, 2016 WL 6995368 (E.D. Wis. Aug. 4, 2016).  Plaintiffs checked the citations again and they \nare correct.  They are also attached hereto as Exhibit C. \n  4 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 102-1 Filed: 05/20/20 Page 5 of 20 PageID #:2905\nThe  consequence  of  Defendant’s  argument—that  an  order  allowing  discovery  into \ncompliance with a court injunction is itself a separate injunction—would entitle every party who \ndisagreed with a district court’s discovery orders to an appeal as of right. 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a). \nDefendant has cited no legal authority for such a startling proposition.  To the contrary, the Seventh \nCircuit has repeatedly characterized discovery orders as the quintessential type of order not subject \nto interlocutory review.  See, e.g., Mohawk Indus., Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. 100, 108 (2009) \n(“[T]he rule remains settled that most discovery rulings are not final.”); Reise v. Bd. of Regents of \nUniv. of Wisc. Sys., 957 F.2d 293, 294 (7th Cir. 1992) (Discovery orders “even exceedingly \nburdensome discovery orders” are not appealable on an interlocutory basis) (collecting cases). \nPlaintiffs’ request is for access to discovery materials in order to permit them to determine \nwhether, and to what extent, the Sheriff is complying with the Court’s preliminary injunction order. \nSee Doc. Nos. 85, 93-1.  Such a request, and any subsequent motion practice  regarding compliance \nshould discovery indicate that the Sheriff is flouting the Preliminary Injunction, is well within this \nCourt’s jurisdiction, regardless of the pendency of Defendant’s appeal of the injunction itself. \nUnion Oil Co., 220 F.3d at 565-66; Chrysler Motors Corp., 909 F.2d at 250. \nII.        THE  SHERIFF  IS  NOT  ENTITLED  TO  A  STAY  OF  DISTRICT  COURT \nPROCEEDINGS PENDING RESOLUTION OF THE APPEAL. \n \nDefendant sets forth the standard for a stay, which mirrors the preliminary injunction \nstandard.  Def. Mot. at 9.  He cannot meet it and his motion for a stay should be denied. \nA. The Sheriff is Unlikely to Succeed on the Merits Before the Seventh Circuit as this \nCourt Correctly Ruled that the Sheriff was Objectively Unreasonable in His Handling \nof the COVID Pandemic in the Jail.   \n  \nDefendant is unlikely to prevail on the merits of his appeal of this Court’s preliminary \ninjunction. \n  5 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 102-1 Filed: 05/20/20 Page 6 of 20 PageID #:2906\nThis Court’s April 27, 2020 memorandum opinion and order, detailing the reasons for its \npreliminary injunction, was thorough in its discussion of both the evidence submitted by the parties \nand the controlling law.  Although the Sheriff contends that “the district court misapplied the legal \nstandard[,]” Doc. No. 98-1 at 9, he offers no meaningful challenge to this Court’s citation to or \ninterpretation of controlling precedents.  To the contrary, the Sheriff’s brief concedes that this \nCourt properly determined that Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment claims require an inquiry into \nthe objective reasonableness of the Sheriff’s conduct, based on the particular facts of the case at \nhand.  Compare Doc. No. 98-1 at 10, with Doc. No. 73 at 52-54.  And the Court, like the Sheriff, \nrecognized that in assessing the Sheriff’s objective reasonableness, the Court must “account for \n[the Sheriff’s] legitimate interest in managing the Jail facilities” and “defer to policies and practices \nthat are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.” \nDoc. No. 73 at 58 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Doc. No. 98-1 at 10 (quoting \nvirtually identical language).  But the Court also properly recognized that judicial deference to \njailers is not limitless; it is circumscribed by the Constitution, and in this case, by the Fourteenth \nAmendment. See Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, (2011) (although courts must extend deference to \nprison  officials,  courts  “nevertheless  must  not  shrink  from  their  obligation  to  enforce  the \nconstitutional rights of all persons, including prisoners.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). \nThe closest the Sheriff comes to identifying a legal issue he contends the Court got wrong \nis in arguing that the CDC’s Guidance that social distancing may not be feasible in correctional \nsettings is dispositive on the question of objective reasonableness.  But the Court’s application of \nSeventh Circuit precedent on this issue is above reproach.  The Court correctly recognized the \nCDC Guidelines can be regarded as “an important piece of evidence to consider in assessing the \nSheriff’s conduct,” without assigning them dispositive effect . Doc. No. 73 at 61; see also id. at \n  6 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 102-1 Filed: 05/20/20 Page 7 of 20 PageID #:2907\n59-62 (discussing United States v. Brown, 871 F.3d 532 (7th Cir. 2017); Carroll v. DeTella, 255 \nF.3d 470 (7th Cir. 2001); Thompson v. City of Chicago, 472 F.3d 444, 454 (7th Cir. 1996)). The \nSheriff’s brief cites to no authority (binding or otherwise) that meaningfully disputes the Court’s \napplication of Seventh Circuit precedents to this case. \nInstead, the Sheriff’s motion simply disagrees with the conclusion that this Court reached. \nThe Court came to that decision after a careful review of the voluminous evidence submitted by \nthe parties, and an evidentiary hearing where both sides were permitted to offer expert testimony \nand argument regarding the motion for a preliminary injunction.  Doc. No. 73 at 3-8, 11-28.  And \nthis Court’s opinion provided a thorough reasoning as to why the evidence supported its injunction.  \nId. at 53-66. In determining that Plaintiffs were entitled to a preliminary injunction, this Court \naddressed the wealth of evidence in the record supporting its conclusion that hygiene, sanitation, \nPPE,  and  social  distancing  provisions  were  necessary—and  narrowly  tailored  remedies—to \nprotect against uncontrolled spread of COVID-19.  Id. at 83-87. And the Court, in both its April \n27 opinion and its earlier April 9 TRO decision, explained the evidence that enabled the Court to \nconclude that the Sheriff was not taking the actions necessary to protect Plaintiffs’ health and \nsafety. Doc. No. 47 at 18-20.  On appeal, those factual determinations will be reviewed for clear \nerror. Valencia v. City of Springfield, 883 F.3d 959, 966 (7th Cir. 2018); Turnell v. CentiMark \nCorp., 796 F.3d 656, 662 (7th Cir. 2015) (“[W]e give substantial deference to the court’s weighing \nof evidence and balancing of the various equitable factors.”).  \nThey are not clearly erroneous. And the Sheriff’s brief does not meaningfully dispute the \nevidence.  Instead, the Sheriff regurgitates a list of things the Sheriff did before the lawsuit was \nfiled, including creating teams, holding meetings, and talking to people about the impending threat \nof COVID-19.  Doc. No. 98-1 at 10-11.  He does not dispute the Court’s findings that at the time \n  7 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 102-1 Filed: 05/20/20 Page 8 of 20 PageID #:2908\nof the Court’s TRO and preliminary injunction, the injunctive measures ordered by the Court were \nnot in place.  And he does not dispute the Court’s findings that hygiene, sanitation, PPE, and social \ndistancing—the measures at issue in the Court’s preliminary injunction—were and are necessary \nto control the spread of COVID-19 and protect people’s lives.  Instead, he contends that because \nhe took various actions “in good faith,” Def. Mot. at 12, 17, 18, he is immune from constitutional \ncompliance, regardless of the reasonableness of those actions to address the threat of harm.  That \nview has been squarely rejected by the Seventh Circuit.  Hardeman v. Curran, 933 F.3d 816, 821 \n(7th Cir. 2019) (defendant’s “motive” in taking action is not relevant to objective reasonableness \ninquiry). The Sheriff has raised no meritorious challenge to this Court’s preliminary injunction \norder. \nThe Sheriff also argues throughout that, regardless of the merits of his challenge to the \npreliminary injunction order, the Court should stay this case simply because the preliminary \ninjunction subjects the Sheriff to oversight by this Court.  These arguments are unpersuasive.  In \nits preliminary injunction opinion, this Court properly balanced its simultaneous responsibilities \nto exercise deference to the Office of the Sheriff, and to enforce the constitutional rights of \ndetainees at the Jail. Doc. No. 73 at 58-59; Brown, 563 U.S. at 511 (“Courts may not allow \nconstitutional violations to continue simply because a remedy would involve intrusion into the \nrealm of prison administration.”). \nThe Sheriff relies on Swain v. Junior, ___ F.3d ___, 2020 WL 2161317 (11th Cir. May 5, \n2020), and Valentine v. Collier, 956 F.3d 797 (5th Cir. 2020), to bolster his deference arguments.   \nBut Swain and Valentine cases are easily distinguishable from this case, primarily because they \nrest on different legal standards.  The Eleventh Circuit issued a stay in Swain v. Junior after finding \nthat the district court did not properly address, and the plaintiffs did not provide, evidence \n  8 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 102-1 Filed: 05/20/20 Page 9 of 20 PageID #:2909\nsufficient to establish, the defendants’ subjective intent. 2020 WL 2161317, at *4 (noting the lack \nof evidence “to establish that the defendants subjectively believed the measures they were taking \nwere inadequate”). The stay order in Valentine was similarly reliant on a finding that that the \ndistrict court improperly “treat[ed] inadequate measures as dispositive of the [d]efendants’ mental \nstate.” Id. at 802; see also id. (noting the lack of evidence “that [defendants] subjectively believe \nthe measures they are taking are inadequate”).  \nAs the Sheriff has acknowledged, his actions in this case must be evaluated according to \na standard of objective reasonableness. See, e.g., Def. Mot. at 10. This Court properly applied \nthat standard and candidly recognized that Plaintiffs would have failed to meet their burden if \ndeliberate indifference governed their claims.  Doc. No. 73 at 56. This Court’s opinion is thus \nvery different from the district court injunctions at issue in Swain and Valentine, and the Sheriff \nhas offered no argument that this Court committed any legal errors in assessing objective \nunreasonableness, or that Plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient evidence that the Sheriff’s actions \nwere objectively unreasonable.4 \nThe cases, which in any event are not binding in this Circuit, are also distinguishable on \nthe  facts.    For  instance,  the  Eleventh  Circuit  in  Swain  identified  specific  and  concrete \ncountervailing interests that counseled against the preliminary injunction, finding that the district \ncourt’s order that detainees be provided with soap and hand sanitizer would divert supplies of those \nproducts from other county facilities where they would be more critical.  Swain, 2020 WL \n \n4   Defendant also cites to Roman v. Wolf, 2020 WL 2188048 (9th Cir. May 5, 2020), Def. Mot. at \n15, but Roman actually supports Plaintiffs’ position. The Ninth Circuit in Roman partially granted a \nmotion to stay the district court’s preliminary injunction order, but refused to stay the part of the order \nthat required the prison to comply with the CDC’s guidance governing correctional facilities.  Given that \nmuch of this Court’s Preliminary Injunction directly encompasses that guidance, Roman also advises \nagainst delay in the Order’s implementation.     \n \n  9 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 102-1 Filed: 05/20/20 Page 10 of 20 PageID #:2910\n2161317, at *5.  Likewise, Swain expressed concern that the district court’s testing requirements \nwould divert testing resources from other facilities.  Id.   The Sheriff has made no related claims \nhere.    \nB.  The Sheriff Has Not Demonstrated He Will Suffer Irreparable Harm Absent a Stay  \n \nThe Sheriff’s arguments about the irreparable harm he will suffer in the absence of a stay \nsimilarly amount to no more than a preference to operate without judicial oversight.  See, e.g., Def. \nMot. at 13 (“The Court’s order is particularly troubling because its duration is open-ended, which \nplaces the Sheriff in the unbounded threat of contempt while exercising his inherent discretion to \nsafely operate the Jail.”). The substance of any claims extending beyond this simple truth ring \nhollow.  \nAs a preliminary matter, the Sheriff cannot credibly assert that he is being “irreparably \nharmed” by an opinion that was issued over three weeks ago.  Cf. Arjo, Inc. v. Handicare USA, \nInc., 2018 WL 5298527, at *9 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 25, 2018) (delay in preliminary injunction filing \n“undermines the moving party’s argument that it will suffer irreparable harm”) (citing cases); see \nalso  New  York  v.  United  States  Dep’t  of  Commerce,  339  F.  Supp.  3d  144,  148 \n(“inexcusable delay in filing a motion to stay severely undermines the….argument that absent \na stay irreparable harm would result.” (citing Hirschfeld v. Bd. of Elections, 984 F.2d 35, 39 (2d \nCir. 1993)).   In the interim weeks, the Sheriff has filed a compliance report, a brief opposing \nPlaintiffs’ discovery requests and a notice of appeal to the Seventh Circuit, see Doc. Nos. 84, 87, \nand 88-90; at no time before yesterday did he seek to stay the implementation of the Order.  And \nhe does not present any arguments here as to why he is subject to irreparable injury in this present \nmoment, as opposed to when the Order was first entered.  \n  10 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 102-1 Filed: 05/20/20 Page 11 of 20 PageID #:2911\nIndeed, the Sheriff’s arguments of irreparable injury are all entirely speculative.  The \nSheriff  claims  that  a  stay  is  appropriate  because  the  Order  hamstrings  him  from  acting  in \naccordance with changed circumstances, for instance, in the event new CDC guidance is published \nthat requires him to alter protocols in the Jail.  Def. Mot. at 16.  But the theoretical possibility of \n“changed circumstances” does not warrant a stay when Defendant has failed to show an actual \ninjury.  See In re Heotis, 17 C 886, 2017 WL 4310513, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 28, 2017) (“A movant's \nfear of harm occurring that is only speculative is insufficient to meet the definition of an irreparable \ninjury.”) (quoting In re Quade, 496 B.R. 520, 527–28 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2013)).  Further, if the \nSheriff believes that new evidence entitles him to a modification of the terms of the Preliminary \nInjunction, he can and should move to modify the order. Cf. Commodity Futures Trading Com’n \nv. Battoo, 790 F.3d 748, 750 (7th Cir. 2015) (court may grant modification of preliminary \ninjunction where the movant “has demonstrated that changed circumstances make the continuation \nof the injunction inequitable.”).5  That he has not done so suggests that nothing has changed, and \nthat the Order is, as Plaintiffs have repeatedly shown (e.g., Doc. Nos. 85, 93-1), appropriate and \nabsolutely necessary to ensure the protection of detainee lives.  See Section II(C), supra. \nThe Sheriff also argues that a stay is appropriate since the Court order amounts to a mandate \nof compliance with his “own policies,” Def. Mot. at 16.  He asserts that these policies have been \n“highly successful” in decreasing the rate of infection in the Jail, id. at 2, 18 (“There can be no \ndoubt that the policies and procedures the Sheriff implemented at the Jail…are responsible for this \nremarkable result.”), and that he “has and will continue” to implement those policies, id. at 18.  \nFirst, if it is the Sheriff’s position that the Court order only codifies the Sheriff’s already-existing \n \n5   The Sheriff decries the fact that the Preliminary Injunction is “open ended.” Def. Mot. at 13.  Again, \nif the Sheriff has evidence to show the Order is no longer necessary, he should move to modify or revoke \nthe terms of the Injunction.  \n  11 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 102-1 Filed: 05/20/20 Page 12 of 20 PageID #:2912\nofficial procedures, then it is hard to fathom how the continuation of the Order impedes his ability \nto run the Jail.  Hinrichs v. Bosma, 440 F.3d 393, 402 (7th Cir. 2006) (denying motion to stay and \nfinding no irreparable harm where injunction ordered same action as movant’s stated practice).  He \nprovides no explanation on this point.  \nSecond, as the Sheriff tacitly admits, conditions in the Jail have undeniably improved as a \nresult of the Preliminary Injunction.  See Def. Mot. at 4-6 (describing an increase in the number of \ntests administrated and the declining positive rate since mid-April).  It is Plaintiffs’ position that \nthe Sheriff is not in full compliance with the order as a practical matter, and seek discovery as to \nhis failure to implement sufficient testing and social distancing on the ground.  See Doc. Nos. 85 \nand 93-1.  But to the extent the Sheriff states that he is being irreparably injured by the continuation \nof a preliminary injunction that (as he admits) have demonstrably enhanced the welfare of \ndetainees in his custody, it is difficult to perceive a more misguided argument.  \nIn short, the Sheriff has failed to provide any evidence beyond mere speculation that the \nexisting Order subjects him to any harm, let alone the irreparable kind. \nC. Plaintiffs Will Be Substantially Injured if this Court Orders a Stay \n \nIn contrast, should a stay issue, Plaintiffs will suffer the very real and irreparable harm of \nincreased risk to their health and life.  Cf. Wilson v. Williams, 2020 WL 2308441 at *2 (N.D. Ohio \nMay 8, 2020) (rejecting a request to stay preliminary injunction ordering the transfer of prisoners \nvulnerable to coronavirus because, among other things, the prisoners’ potential injuries in event of \na stay, which included “serious medical complications and possible death,”) (“[I]t would be hard \nto overstate how much more serious the potential injuries to Petitioners are compared to those cited \nby Respondents.”). \n  12 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 102-1 Filed: 05/20/20 Page 13 of 20 PageID #:2913\nThe Sheriff contends that staying the court’s preliminary injunction would not harm the \nplaintiff class because (a) he is doing and intends to continue doing all that the preliminary \ninjunction requires, and (b) the Sheriff’s recent testing results demonstrate that the coronavirus is \ncurrently being managed in the Jail.  These arguments simply lack merit.   \nFirst, it is deeply discordant for the Sheriff to insist that all is well within the Jail, and thus \nthere would be no harm to Plaintiffs if the injunction were stayed, while at the same time \ncontinuing his vehement opposition to Plaintiffs’ efforts to obtain limited discovery that would \nshed light on the realities behind Jail walls.  The Sheriff’s explanations and assurances regarding \nprotection of the detainees in his care have been inconsistent and obfuscatory.   \nFor example, in his May 1 report regarding compliance, the Sheriff complained that the \npreliminary injunction made it “more difficult to guarantee [the] protection” of protective custody \ndetainees at heightened risk of sexual assault.  See Doc. No. 84 at 14.  When Plaintiffs sought \ndiscovery regarding the housing of this group of vulnerable detainees, the Sheriff countered that \nthey “remain fully protected,” even though they may encounter general population detainees in \ncommon areas and dayrooms.  See Sheriff’s 5/11/20 Response (Doc. No. 87-1) at 23.  The Sheriff \nhas never furnished an explanation of where these vulnerable detainees are housed—and he refuses \nto do so.  There is similar opacity as to all Jail operations that pertain to the preliminary injunction \nand on which Plaintiffs have sought discovery.  The justifications for housing detainees in close \nquarters on special needs RTU tiers are simply the Sheriff’s say-so.  The Sheriff adamantly opposes \nPlaintiffs’  request  to  clarify,  as  to  the  specific  detainees,  the  reasons  why  the  Sheriff  has \ndetermined they must be in housing that does not permit social distancing.  Similarly he refuses to \nprovide any clarity as to who is being tested in quarantine and on what metrics.  \n  13 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 102-1 Filed: 05/20/20 Page 14 of 20 PageID #:2914\nAs an additional example, the Sheriff’s account of the extent of coronavirus infection in \nthe Jail has evolved.  In early April, as the number of positive cases was increasing to an alarming \nnumber, the Sheriff’s website began an idiosyncratic system of dividing the number of positive \ntest results—separately reporting those who were “currently” positive and those who are “no \nlonger  positive  and  are  being  monitored  at  a  recovery  facility  in  the  Jail.”    See \nhttps://www.cookcountysheriff.org/covid-19-cases-at-ccdoc/.    The  Sheriff’s  recent  filing  now \nreveals three categories of positive test results: “positives in isolation,” “convalescent detainees” \n(described on the website as “no longer positive”), and “post-convalescent detainees” (also, \npresumably, “no longer positive” and also in “regular housing”).   See  Doc. No. 98-4.  The exhibit \nnow clarifies what the website has hidden for more than a month—the total number of known \ninfections within the Jail from March 23 to the present, which equals 811 known infections \n(counting  the  seven  who  have  passed  away).    See  id.;  and  compare \nhttps://www.cookcountysheriff.org/covid-19-cases-at-ccdoc/  (reporting  only  542  current  and \nformerly positive cases). \nIn short—the Sheriff has not been transparent.  He continues to take notable efforts to close \nthe curtain on the Jail’s operations.  For these reasons, among others, there is “good cause” to \nallow the expedited discovery that Plaintiffs are seeking.  Doc. Nos. 85, 93-1.  But, in any event, \nthe court should hesitate to simply trust the Sheriff’s assurances that, with a stay, the health and \nsafety of the detainees in the Jail will not be compromised. \nSecond, the Sheriff offers a false history of the events that preceded and followed the \ncourt’s temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.  On April 9, when the TRO was \nentered, there were 312 known positive COVID-19 cases in the Jail.  All of the cases had been \nidentified in the span of just 18 days (from March 23) and the rate of increase was deeply \n  14 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 102-1 Filed: 05/20/20 Page 15 of 20 PageID #:2915\ndisturbing.  See Doc. No. 98-4.  Contrary to the Sheriff’s public statements (at a press conference \non March 27, the Sheriff Dart said “in the next day or two we’ll have everyone in some type of \nsingle  cell”  (see  https://www.facebook.com/196166530417661/videos/1455986534583494/)), \nmany detainees were in double cells and dormitories long after this court’s April 7 TRO.  See Ex. \n1 to Michael Miller 4/17/20 Dec. (Doc. No. 62-5) (showing close to 1500 detainees in double cells \nor dormitories as of April 17).  Testing was limited; lack of tests rendered it infeasible for the \nSheriff to test asymptomatic detainees.  See Defendant’s Post-Ruling Report (Doc. No. 51) at 12 \n(no testing of quarantined detainees who has been exposed to symptomatic or positive detainees).  \nBullpens were being used during the intake process.  Throughout the Jail’s divisions, there were \ncomplaints about lack of personal protective equipment (particularly masks) and lack of supplies \nfor  personal  hygiene  and  for  sanitation.  See,  e.g.,  Doc.  Nos.  1-10  through  1-19  (detainee \ndeclarations  attached  to  Plaintiffs’  4/3/20  complaint);  Doc.  No.  55-5  (detainee  declarations \nattached to Plaintiffs’ 4/14/20 renewed motion for summary judgment); Doc. No. 64-5 (detainee \ndeclaration attached to Plaintiffs’ 4/19/20 reply in support of renewed motion for preliminary \ninjunction). \nThe TRO and the preliminary injunction pushed the Sheriff to make significant changes in \nJail operations: (1) the Sheriff has discontinued the use of bullpens at intake and enforces social \ndistancing there (see Doc. No. 51 at 3-7 (describing social distancing and other precautionary \nprocedures implemented on April 10 in response to the TRO)); (2) the Sheriff has eliminated \ndouble celling and greatly reduced dormitory housing while enabling social distancing in most \ndormitory tiers (compare Michael Miller 4/6/20 Dec. Ex. 1 (Doc. No. 30-8) (showing occupancy \nlevels in early April) with Michael Miller 4/17/20 Dec. Ex. 2 (Doc. No. 62-5) (showing reduced \noccupancy levels in dorms and single-celled tiers));  (3) the Sheriff has increased testing capacity \n  15 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 102-1 Filed: 05/20/20 Page 16 of 20 PageID #:2916\nand tests (some) asymptomatic detainees (see Doc. No. 98-5 at 5 (“[o]n or about April 16, Cermak \nbegan testing asymptomatic detainees”)); (4) by the Sheriff’s report, massive efforts have been \nundertaken to secure PPE, sanitation supplies and personal hygiene materials, and to educate \ndetainees and staff about their use (see, e.g., Doc. Nos. 84-5 through 84-9 (listing sanitation and \nhygiene efforts within the Jail as of 5/1/20)). \nThe Sheriff makes much of the apparent decrease in the rate of new coronavirus infections \namong detainees in the Jail in the past four weeks.  See Doc. No. 98-1 at 5.  If the rate of infection \nis indeed slowing, it is hard to escape the conclusion that that outcome is the product of the court’s \nintervention and the Sheriff’s efforts to comply with the TRO and the preliminary injunction.   \nWhen this case began—whatever the state of the Sheriff’s planning and efforts at mitigation—the \nJail was a national hotspot for coronavirus infection; the number of cases was multiplying at an \nalarming rate.  If, taking the Sheriff at his word, the rate of infection has now leveled off, the most \nplausible inference is that the improvement has been driven by the court’s intervention—not by \nthe Sheriff’s January planning. \nThird, whatever the successes that have been achieved by virtue of the preliminary \ninjunction, those successes are not grounds for a stay.  Cf. United States v. Oregon State Med. Soc., \n343 U.S. 326, 333 (1952) (“[t]he sole function of an action for injunction is to forestall future \nviolations”).  If the spread of infection has indeed slowed as the Sheriff claims, that is reason to \ndouble down on the measures that have led to that result—social distancing, personal protection, \nhygiene and sanitation.  This is hardly the time to let up on the pressure.   \nBut more concerning, the Sheriff has made it abundantly clear that he has no ability and no \nintention to comply with the preliminary injunction’s social distancing requirements in the event \nthe Jail’s population increases.  The Sheriff staked out that position in his May 1 report regarding \n  16 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 102-1 Filed: 05/20/20 Page 17 of 20 PageID #:2917\ncompliance with the preliminary injunction, arguing there that it would not be feasible to continue \nsocial distancing within the Jail should the population rise above current levels, as is to be expected \nduring the summer months.  See Doc. No. 84 at 18-21.  \nThe Sheriff reiterates the point in his motion for stay—complaining that the preliminary \ninjunction will hinder operations by forcing him to request a “permission slip” in order to abandon \nsocial distancing in the event of a population increase.  See Doc. No. 98-1 at 16.  The Sheriff seeks \na stay, in other words, because, perversely, he wants freedom from the requirement of social \ndistancing in particular—chief among the measures that has led to the slowed rate of infection. \nIn contrast to the harms about which the Sheriff complains, the risk of irreparable harm to \nPlaintiffs is “hard to overstate.” Wilson, 2020 WL 2308441 at *2.  Seven detainees have died.  \nMany remain infected.  Many more have not been tested.  The uncertain path of the coronavirus is \nwell known to all of us.  The risk to which Plaintiffs would be exposed if a stay were granted are \nenormous.  They are, quite simply, risks that should not be taken. \nD.   Issuance of a Stay Will Harm the Public Interest. \nIt is always in the public interest for public figures to comply with the Constitution.  See, \ne.g., Whole Woman's Health Alliance. v. Hill, 937 F.3d 864, 875 (7th Cir. 2019) (“Enforcing a \nconstitutional  right  is  in  the  public  interest.”);  \nHeitmann v. City of Chicago, 2008 WL 1943239, at *5 (N.D. Ill. May 1, 2008) (“we also must \nconsider the public interest in ensuring that defendant is in compliance with federal law”).  Since \nthe preliminary injunction in this case does no more than require such compliance, it necessarily \nfollows that granting a stay would disserve the public interest. \nMoreover, the coronavirus pandemic presents the extraordinary circumstance where an \nelevated risk of infection to persons confined within the Jail necessarily elevates the risk of \n  17 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 102-1 Filed: 05/20/20 Page 18 of 20 PageID #:2918\ninfection to persons outside the Jail—a risk that is actualized every time a corrections officer, other \nSheriff’s employee, contractor or others having business in the Jail enters and then leaves the \nfacility.  The Jail’s walls cannot stop the spread of coronavirus.  The public interest would be \ndirectly and significantly disserved by a stay that enabled relaxation of measures to control the \nspread of coronavirus. \nThe Sheriff’s description of Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418 (2009) misstates the case.  The \nCourt in Nken, a case about stays of removal orders in the immigration context, noted that the \npublic has competing interests in “preventing aliens from being wrongfully removed” and in \n“prompt execution of removal orders.”  556 U.S. at 436.  To the extent the government in Nken \nalso sought prompt execution of removal orders (the government opposed the stay), the court \nobserved that the government’s interest and the public interest merged.  Id.  But that is a far cry \nfrom broad, indefensible proposition that the Sheriff advocates—that the government’s position \nsomehow and always defines the public interest.  For that proposition there is no support of which \nPlaintiffs are aware.  And the facts of this case make very clear that the public has every interest \nin seeing the preliminary injunction order remain in force and the lives of detainees remain \nprotected. See Johnson v. Loftus, 2008 WL 4542952, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 1, 2008) (“the public has \na  significant interest in  ensuring  that  individuals  are  not  imprisoned  in  violation  of  the \nConstitution”). \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ respectfully request that this Court deny Defendants’ \nMotion to Stay Proceedings Pending Appeal and to Strike their Discovery Requests.  \n \n \n  18 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 102-1 Filed: 05/20/20 Page 19 of 20 PageID #:2919\nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Alexa Van Brunt  \nLocke E.

Bowman, III (Bowman, Locke) (Entered: 04/03/2020) \n04/03/2020  10   MINUTE entry before the Honorable Matthew F. Kennelly: This order \nis entered by Judge Kennelly in his capacity as emergency judge. \nPlaintiffs have filed a putative class action on behalf of Cook County \nJail detainees against Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart. Mays v. Dart, \nCase No. 20 C 2134. The case, having been filed after the close of \nbusiness today, has not yet been assigned to a district judge. Plaintiffs \nhave also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order or \npreliminary injunction (TRO/PI) and a motion seeking an expedited \nhearing, specifically on 4/6/2020. Plaintiffs advise in the latter motion \nthat on today's date, before filing suit, they gave notice of their intent to \nfile the suit and the TRO/PI motion to the Sheriff's general counsel and \nto supervisory personnel in the Cook County State's Attorney's Office \n(CCSAO). Plaintiffs' motion for an expedited hearing is granted to the \nextent stated in this order. By 12:00 p.m. on 4/6/2020, plaintiffs are \ndirected to supplement their TRO/PI motion to provide their position \nregarding the applicability and effect of 18 U.S.C. § 3626 to their \nlawsuit and, in particular, to the relief they are requesting in the TRO/PI \nmotion. Defendant is directed to file a response to the TRO/PI motion \nby no later than 8:00 p.m. on 4/6/2020. Defendant's response should \ninclude a description of any steps defendant has taken and is taking to \nprotect detainees from contracting the Coronavirus and to care for \ndetainees who have already contracted the virus. A hearing on the \nTRO/PI motion--at least, a preliminary hearing--is set for 4/7/2020 at \n10:30 a.m. and will be conducted by telephone. Counsel are to use the \nfollowing call-in number: 888-684-8852, conference code 746-1053. \nThe Court strongly encourages the parties to confer to attempt to reach \na reasonable resolution of the dispute, taking into consideration the \nhealth and safety of detainees, the safety of the public, and the \noperation of the criminal justice system. At the hearing on April 7, the \nCourt reserves the right to order further briefing and argument and to \ndirect the parties to pursue mediation of the dispute. Because no \nattorney has yet filed an appearance for defendant, plaintiffs' counsel is \ndirected to immediately provide notice of this order to the Sheriff's \ngeneral counsel and to the CCSAO supervisory personnel to whom they \nprovided notice of their intent to file the lawsuit and to file a \nverification that they have done so.

Kennelly: Defendant \nhas made a motion to file under seal Exhibit P to its response to \nplaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order, which is a 21 page \ndocument entitled \"Coronoavirus Operation Plan.\" The entirety of the \njustification for the motion is a statement that \"This plan contains \nsensitive law enforcement internal strategy and controls.\" The Court \nhas reviewed the document in its entirety and cannot conclude that \ndefendant has shown that the entire document must be kept out of the \npublic record. The document contains an assessment of the Coronavirus \noutbreak and its impact on, among other things, the Cook County Jail; \nit details steps the Sheriff's Office has taken to attempt to deal with the \noutbreak; and it addresses planning for ongoing developments \nregarding the outbreak and the Jail. A good deal of it provides the \nsupport for what the defendant has discussed in its publicly-filed \nresponse to the motion for temporary restraining order. It is conceivable \nthat some part of the document ought to be kept out of the public \nrecord, but the proposition that it must be sealed in its entirety is \nunsupported and likely unsupportable. The Court will deny the motion \nto seal unless defendant files, before today's telephone hearing, further \nsupport identifying the particular portions of the exhibit that should be \nredacted from the version to be filed in the public record and a \nparticularized explanation for why these portions should be redacted \n(preferably an affidavit, though the Court acknowledges that the time \nbefore the hearing is short, so it may not insist on that for the time \nbeing).

Kennelly: This order \nis entered by Judge Kennelly, as emergency judge, on the emergency \ndocket (20 C 1792) and on the docket of Mays v. Dart (20 C 2134). \nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 700 has filed a motion to \nintervene in the Mays case and has filed it not only on the docket in that \ncase but also on the emergency docket. The motion, however, does not \ndescribe any emergency. Indeed, it says (in paragraph 6) that the \nmovant \"does not seek reconsideration of any preliminary rulings \nentered thus far\" and instead seeks to protect the interest of the \nplaintiff's members \"as complications arise with the implementation of \nthose rulings\" or \"as the Court considers permanent relief,\" neither of \nwhich appear to describe emergencies. The Court therefore terminates \nthe motion on the emergency docket. If movant considers the motion to \npresent an emergency, then it should file an amended motion on the \nemergency docket. Otherwise, the motion can appropriately be dealt \n\nwith by the assigned judge in the Mays case. (mk) (Entered: \n04/30/2020) \n05/01/2020  81   MINUTE entry before the Honorable Robert W.

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 29(a), the prison & jail law \nscholars listed in Appendix A respectfully move for leave to file their brief as \namici curiae in support of Plaintiffs-Appellees. \n2.  Amici are scholars specializing in the law of prisons and jails. They have \nsubstantial academic, pedagogical, and professional experience bearing on the \nlegal questions presented, as well as a professional interest in the proper \ndevelopment of the law.  \n3.  This amicus brief will aid the Court’s decisional process in two respects. First, \nit clarifies the applicable legal requirements and explains the circumstances in \nwhich federal courts consider agency and professional organization standards \nin  determining  whether  those  legal  requirements  are  satisfied.  Second,  it \napplies those governing principles to a particular agency standard—issued by \nthe CDC—that was addressed at length below and that is cited repeatedly (but \nmistakenly) by Appellant as supporting his position.

They have \nsubstantial academic, pedagogical, and professional experience bearing on the legal \nquestions presented, as well as a professional interest in the proper development of \nthe law. A full list of amici is attached as Appendix A.1   \nINTRODUCTION & SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Sheriff contends that his attempted compliance with CDC guidelines \ndefeats any finding that he violated the Fourteenth Amendment at the Cook County \nJail. This argument is mistaken for two distinct reasons. First, the Sheriff’s position \nis foreclosed by precedent holding that agency standards are not conclusive on the \nconstitutional question of objective reasonableness. Second, the CDC guidelines are \nnot the kind of agency standard that should receive weight in the constitutional \nanalysis: they were issued early in the pandemic when information was even scarcer \nthan currently, they have not been updated in relevant respects in light of new public \nhealth  data,  and  they  contain  an  irregular  “feasibility”  exception  without  any \napparent basis in public health or safety principles. Given these considerations, the \ndistrict court appropriately concluded that the Sheriff’s efforts at complying with the \n \n1 Pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 29(a)(4)(E), amici state that no party’s counsel authored \nthe brief in whole or in part; no party’s counsel contributed money that was intended \nto fund preparing or submitting the brief; and no person—other than amici and their \ncounsel—contributed money that was intended to fund preparing or submitting the \nbrief. Appellees have consented to this filing, but Appellant has not.  \n1 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 42            Filed: 07/24/2020      Pages: 40\n \nCDC guidelines did not prevent legal scrutiny of his official conduct—including his \n \ndecisions respecting group housing and double celling, which effectively preclude \nhundreds of detainees at the Cook County Jail from engaging in social distancing.  \nI. Pretrial detainees enjoy a presumption of innocence and therefore cannot be \nsubjected to conditions amounting to punishment. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, \n537 (1979). A prison official violates the rights of pretrial detainees when he acts \n“purposefully, knowingly, or perhaps even recklessly” and when his conduct is \nobjectively unreasonable. See McCann v. Ogle Cty., 909 F.3d 881, 886 (7th Cir. \n2018); see also Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 576 U.S. 389, 395 (2015). While the \nSheriff seeks to muddy the waters, the fundamental issue here is whether he acted in \nan  objectively  unreasonable  manner  by  deciding  to  house  hundreds  of  pretrial \ndetainees in conditions that make social distancing impossible. With respect to that \nissue, the Sheriff suggests that his attempted compliance with CDC guidelines is \nconclusive. See Appellant’s Br. at 34-36, 44-45, 48. This argument, however, rests \non legal error. As federal courts have long recognized, compliance with agency and \nprofessional organization standards is neither necessary nor sufficient to satisfy the \nConstitution’s requirement of objective reasonableness. See, e.g., Brown v. Plata, \n563 U.S. 493, 539-40 (2011); Bell, 441 U.S. at 543 n.27; United States v. Brown, \n871 F.3d 532, 536-37 (7th Cir. 2017); Thompson v. Chicago, 472 F.3d 444, 454 (7th \nCir. 2006); Gates v. Cook, 376 F.3d 323, 337 (5th Cir. 2004). To be sure, these sorts \n2 \n \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 42            Filed: 07/24/2020      Pages: 40\n \nof standards may be “instructive in some cases.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 543 n.27. But they \n \ncan at most illuminate—and not answer—the constitutional question. This is clear \nfrom  precedent  analyzing  the  constitutional  relevance  of  many  other  national \nstandards, including those issued by the American Correctional Association (ACA) \nand those issued pursuant to the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA).   \nII. The district court treated the Sheriff’s attempted compliance with the CDC \nguidelines as relevant but not controlling. This was reasonable. The CDC guidelines \nwere created by an expert agency and contain many recommendations consistent \nwith the CDC’s advice to the general public—particularly regarding the importance \nof social distancing. However, the CDC guidelines were issued just a few weeks into \nthe pandemic, have not been regularly updated, and have not kept pace with the latest \nscience. Moreover, the guidelines do not purport to define a set of recommendations \nthat would ensure health and safety in a jail, and they are thus different in kind than \nmost other standards. The CDC guidelines instead offer a suite of recommendations \nand then provide—without any noted basis in public health principles—that some of \nthese recommendations may not be “feasible in all facilities.” Because the guidelines \ncontain this irregular (and expansive) internal loophole, which invites officials to \ndisregard  public  health  principles  where  they  see  compliance  as  too  costly  or \nburdensome, they do not in fact define a health and safety standard worthy of much \ndeference in deciding whether the Sheriff upheld constitutional requirements.   \n3 \n \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 42            Filed: 07/24/2020      Pages: 40\n \nARGUMENT \n \n \nI.  DUE PROCESS CLAUSE REQUIREMENTS ARE DISTINCT FROM \nAGENCY AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION STANDARDS  \n \nA.  The Due Process Clause Requires that the Sheriff’s Conduct at the \nCook County Jail Be Objectively Reasonable \n \nPretrial detainees “have not been convicted of anything, and they are still \nentitled to the constitutional presumption of innocence.” Miranda v. Cty. of Lake, \n900 F.3d 335, 350 (7th Cir. 2018). They thus enjoy greater protections than persons \nconvicted of crimes. In particular, they cannot be exposed to conditions that “amount \nto punishment.” Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 537 (1979). This rule follows from \nthe  Due  Process  Clause,  which  governs  all  “conditions-of-confinement  claims \nbrought by pretrial detainees.” Hardeman v. Curran, 933 F.3d 816, 823 (7th Cir. \n2019). In assessing such claims, courts do not require any proof of subjective malice. \nSee Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 576 U.S. 389, at 395 (2015). They instead ask two \nquestions: (1) whether the defendant “acted purposefully, knowingly, or perhaps \neven  recklessly,”  and  (2)  whether  the  defendant’s  conduct  was  “objectively \nreasonable.” McCann v. Ogle Cty., 909 F.3d 881, 886 (7th Cir. 2018).  \nHere, the Sheriff seeks to reframe that inquiry in two respects. For starters, he \nargues that the constitutional analysis must address his full course of conduct in \nresponding  to  the  pandemic—and  not  his  specific  decisions  that  make  social \ndistancing impossible for many detainees. See Appellant’s Br. at 23. That argument \n4 \n \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 42            Filed: 07/24/2020      Pages: 40\n \nis a distraction. His choice to impose this restriction is a distinct policy in its own \n \nright and a critical feature of his broader policy; in either case, it is no stray detail. \nThe Sheriff is well aware of the threat posed by COVID-19; he knows that social \ndistancing rests at the heart of any effort to contain it; and he made a considered \nchoice to adopt the policies challenged here. The district court found that this \ndecision  resulted  in  a  “heightened,  and  potentially  unreasonable  .  .  .  risk  of \ncontracting and transmitting the coronavirus.” Mays v. Dart, No. 20 Civ. 2134, 2020 \nWL 1987007, *27 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 27, 2020). The Sheriff’s broader efforts, even those \nundertaken in good faith, do not preclude assessing whether the specific policy \nenjoined below violates detainees’ constitutional rights.  \nAs a fallback, the Sheriff implies that his decision to house detainees in \nconditions that make social distancing impossible does not reflect reckless disregard \nfor the consequences. See Appellant’s Br. at 24-33. But precedent forecloses his \nposition. This is not like a case where “an officer’s Taser goes off by accident,” \nKingsley, 576 U.S. at 396, or where doctors “mixed up [a patient’s] chart with that \nof another detainee,” Miranda, 900 F.3d at 354. The Sheriff knows that the virus is \nspreading through his jail and made a choice that foreseeably denies many detainees \nthe single most effective preventive measure. In that respect, this is much more like \na case where doctors “deliberately chose a ‘wait and see’ monitoring plan, knowing \nthat [a detainee] was neither eating nor drinking nor competent to care for herself.” \n5 \n \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 42            Filed: 07/24/2020      Pages: 40\n \nMiranda, 900 F.3d at 354. The district court did not err in holding the Sheriff \n \nresponsible for making a decision with potentially deadly consequences.     \nThat  leaves  only  one  final  question:  whether  the  Sheriff’s  conduct—\nspecifically, his conduct in establishing the challenged policy on double celling and \ngroup  housing—was  objectively  reasonable.  This  question  does  not  turn  on \nsubjective good faith or on evidence of the Sheriff’s motives; it looks only to the \nSheriff’s conduct and asks whether it is objectively reasonable. That assessment, in \nturn, cannot be undertaken “mechanically.” Kingsley, 576 U.S. at 397. It requires the \nCourt to “focus on the totality of facts and circumstances faced by the [Sheriff] and \nto gauge objectively—without regard to any subjective belief held by [the Sheriff]—\nwhether [his] response was reasonable.” McCann, 909 F.3d at 886. Of course, the \nCourt must also account for the “legitimate interests” that stem from the Sheriff’s \ninstitutional responsibilities. Kingsley, 576 U.S. at 397. In the end, it is for the Court \nto decide whether the Sheriff’s decision reflects an objectively reasonable exercise \nof his power to control conditions at the Cook County Jail.  \nB.  Agency and Professional Organization Guidelines May Illuminate \nthe Objective Reasonableness Analysis but Cannot Control It  \n \nThe Sheriff suggests that the objective reasonableness analysis must be cut \nshort—and resolved in his favor—if he demonstrates compliance with the CDC \nGuidelines. See Appellant’s Br. at 34-36, 44-45, 48. He does not assert that such \n6 \n \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 42            Filed: 07/24/2020      Pages: 40\n \ncompliance is required, but rather that it affords him a constitutional safe harbor. \n \nThat position is misplaced as a matter of settled constitutional law.  \nThis is not the first time a federal court has been asked to defer to an agency \nor professional organization’s standards about conditions of confinement. As the \nFifth  Circuit  held  in  a  leading  case,  compliance  with  such  standards  does  not \nguarantee constitutionality: it would be “absurd to suggest that the federal courts \nshould subvert their judgment as to alleged Eighth Amendment violations to [a \nprofessional group] whenever it has relevant standards.” Gates v. Cook, 376 F.3d \n323, 337 (5th Cir. 2004). The Supreme Court long ago established a clear limiting \nprinciple: while agency and professional guidelines “may be instructive in certain \ncases, they simply do not establish the constitutional minima” for purposes of \nassessing the objective reasonableness of carceral conditions. Bell, 441 U.S. at 543 \nn.27. Many courts have since reaffirmed that rule. See, e.g., Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. \n493,  539–40  (2011)  (“[C]ourts  must  not  confuse  professional  standards  with \nconstitutional requirements.”); Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 348 n.13 (1981); \nTillery v. Owens, 907 F.2d 418, 426 (3d Cir. 1990) (“Because we look to societal \nstandards  as  our  benchmark,  expert  opinions  and  professional  standards,  while \ninstructive, are not determinative.”); Inmates of Occoquan v. Barry, 844 F.2d 828, \n839 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (reversing district court analysis as over-reliant on “standards \npromulgated by various professional organizations”); Cody v. Hillard, 830 F.2d 912, \n7 \n \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 42            Filed: 07/24/2020      Pages: 40\n \n914  (8th  Cir.  1987)  (“The  Supreme  Court  has  explicitedly  [sic]  rejected  the \n \nproposition that such standards establish a constitutional norm.”). \nThere are three principal reasons why federal courts do not treat compliance \nwith agency and professional organization standards as either necessary or sufficient \nto satisfy the Constitution. First, in cases addressing whether noncompliance with \nthese sorts of standards establishes a constitutional violation, courts have recognized \nthat they are often contested or based on value judgments that might not be shared \nby society at large—and thus they cannot appropriately define what is objectively \nreasonable. See Rhodes, 452 U.S. at 348 n.13 (“[G]eneralized opinions of experts \ncannot weigh as heavily in determining contemporary standards of decency as ‘the \npublic attitude toward a given sanction.’” (citation omitted)). Second, it is the role \nof courts, not executive branch agencies and professional organizations, to define \nconstitutional standards and assess objective reasonableness. See Bell, 441 U.S. at \n543 n.27; Gates, 376 F.3d at 337. Finally, in a totality of the circumstances analysis, \nno single “framework” established by an agency or professional organization can be \ndeterminative in a particular case because no guidelines can properly anticipate all \nrelevant factual considerations bearing on the legal determination. Thompson v. \nChicago, 472 F.3d 444, 454 (7th Cir. 2006); see also United States v. Brown, 871 \nF.3d 532, 536–37 (7th Cir. 2017) (“An officer’s compliance with or deviation from \ndepartmental policy doesn’t determine whether he used excessive force.”); Orr v. \n8 \n \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 42            Filed: 07/24/2020      Pages: 40\n \nShicker,  953  F.3d  490,  502  (7th  Cir.  2020)  (noting  that  compliance  with \n \nprofessionally developed medical protocols could not defeat an Eighth Amendment \nclaim where the plaintiff’s disease had progressed far enough to require treatment). \nWhile many of these cases indicate that compliance with third party standards \nis not necessary to comply with the Constitution, it follows directly from their \nreasoning  that  compliance  with  such  standards  is  likewise  not  sufficient  to \ndemonstrate compliance. See Axelson v. Watson, 746 F. App’x 600, 602 (8th Cir. \n2018)  (“[P]urported  compliance  with  [a  professional  organization’s]  minimum \nstandards did not establish, as a matter of law, that the unit was staffed according to \nthe requirements of the Eighth Amendment”). Indeed, this Court has expressly said \nas much in the very closely related Fourth Amendment context, where police officer \nconduct  involving  the  use  of  force  is  similarly  subject  to  objectiveness \nreasonableness analysis. See, e.g., United States v. Brown, 871 F.3d at 536–37 (“The \nexcessive-force  inquiry  is  governed  by  constitutional  principles,  not police-\ndepartment  regulations.  An  officer’s  compliance  with  or  deviation  from \ndepartmental policy doesn’t determine whether he used excessive force. Put another \nway,  a  police  officer’s  compliance  with  the  rules  of  his  department  is  neither \nsufficient  nor  necessary  to  satisfy  the  Fourth  Amendment’s  reasonableness \nrequirement.” (citation omitted)); Thompson, 472 F.3d at 454 (“[W]hile the [police \ndepartment’s] General Order may give police administration a framework whereby \n9 \n \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 42            Filed: 07/24/2020      Pages: 40\n \ncommanders may evaluate officer conduct and job performance, it sheds no light on \n \nwhat may or may  not be considered ‘objectively reasonable’ under the Fourth \nAmendment given the infinite set of disparate circumstances which officers might \nencounter.”); see also N.S. v. Kansas City, Mo., Bd. of Police Comm’rs, No. 4:16 \nCiv. 843, 2018 WL 10419366, at *3 (W.D. Mo. Feb. 7, 2018) (“National standards \nare relevant to the extent that they reflect the informed experience of the occupation \nor profession. They do not, in any way, supplant standards provided for by the law.” \n(citation omitted)). \nAs these cases recognize, agency and professional organization standards \nanswer different questions, and do so at a more abstract level, than the highly fact-\nintensive objective reasonableness inquiry that the Constitution entrusts to courts. \nJust as third parties cannot define what the Constitution requires, nor can they define \nwhat conduct satisfies it. Cf. Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical and \nEmotional Harm § 13 (2010) (explaining that for purposes of tort law, an “actor’s \ncompliance with the custom of the community, or of others in like circumstances . . . \ndoes not preclude a finding of negligence”); The T.J. Hooper, 60 F.2d 737, 740 (2d \nCir. 1932) (L. Hand, J.) (“[I]n most cases reasonable prudence is in fact common \nprudence; but strictly it is never its measure; a whole calling may have unduly lagged \nin the adoption of new and available devices. It never may set its own tests, however \npersuasive be its usages. Courts must in the end say what is required; there are \n10 \n \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 42            Filed: 07/24/2020      Pages: 40\n \nprecautions so imperative that even their universal disregard will not excuse their \n \nomission.”). \nThat is not to say agency and professional organization standards are entirely \nirrelevant. As the Supreme Court affirmed in Bell, they “may be instructive in certain \ncases.” 441 U.S. at 543 n.27. This is particularly true where an issue is complex and \nspecialized in ways that elude ordinary judicial experience and common sense. See \nBrown, 871 F.3d at 538 (“The level of factual complexity in the case may also bear \non the relevance of expert testimony . . .”); Carroll v. DeTella, 255 F.3d 470, 472-\n73  (7th  Cir.  2001)  (assigning  great  importance  to  compliance  with  official \nenvironmental standards in a case where inmates sued under the Eighth Amendment \nbased on alleged exposure to environmental hazards). \nConsistent  with  these  principles,  federal  courts  consider  agency  and \nprofessional organization standards only to the extent that doing so fairly illuminates \nthe ultimate issue of objective reasonableness. There are at last three fundamental \nconsiderations relevant to that determination: (1) whether the standards reflect an \nexercise of professional expertise on an issue beyond the ken of common sense; (2) \nwhether the standards in fact establish a baseline of policies, procedures, or conduct \nthat ensure health and safety; and (3) whether the standards are applicable to the fact \npattern in a given case. In some respects, agency and professional organization \nstandards thus receive something like Skidmore deference. See Skidmore v. Swift & \n11 \n \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 42            Filed: 07/24/2020      Pages: 40\n \nCo., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944) (articulating a standard of deference to agency action \n \ndependent upon “the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its \nreasoning,  its  consistency  with  earlier  and  later  pronouncements,  and  all  those \nfactors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control”).  \nThis approach is evident in how federal courts have treated such standards in \nthe carceral context. The following examples exemplify that point: \nAmerican  Correctional  Association  (ACA)  Standards:  The  ACA  was \nestablished in 1870 and began developing prison standards in the 1940s.2 For the \nlast  eighty  years,  the  ACA  has  published  and  updated  standards  to  reflect  the \ncorrectional field’s evolving understanding of the professional operation of jails and \nprisons. The Committee on Standards consists of twenty experts and meets bi-\nannually to update existing standards and create new standards.3 Other experts may \nalso propose revisions and submit comments for the Committee to consider at their \nbi-annual meetings. Id. As a result, the ACA standards are based on a measure of \n \n2 The History of Standards & Accreditation, ACA, \nhttp://www.aca.org/ACA_Prod_IMIS/ACA_Member/Standards___Accreditation/\nAbout_Us/ACA_Member/Standards_and_Accreditation/SAC_AboutUs.aspx?hkey\n=bdf577fe-be9e-4c22-aa60-dc30dfa3adcb (last visited July 24, 2020). \n3 Committee on Standards, ACA, \nhttp://www.aca.org/ACA_Prod_IMIS/ACA_Member/Standards_and_Accreditatio\nn/Standards_Committee/Standards_Committee.aspx?WebsiteKey=139f6b09-e150-\n4c56-9c66-284b92f21e51&hkey=795105de-6a67-4769-b58a-\n0de6df7e8324&New_ContentCollectionOrganizerCommon=2#New_ContentColle\nctionOrganizerCommon (last visited July 24, 2020). \n12 \n \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 42            Filed: 07/24/2020      Pages: 40\n \nprofessional expertise and reflect meaningful expert deliberation. But by their plain \n \nterms,  the  ACA  standards  do  not  purport  to  establish  a  universal  baseline  of \nacceptable  safety  protocols.  Rather,  the  ACA  standards  are  designed  only  “to \nenhance correctional practices for the benefit of inmates, staff, administrators, and \nthe public.”4 \nAccounting for all this, courts occasionally consult the ACA standards while \nanalyzing conditions of confinement claims, but do not assign them controlling \nweight in the constitutional calculus. See, e.g., Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk Cty. Jail, \n502 U.S. 367, 375 n.3, 391 n.13 (1992) (noting that a district court reasonably relied \non the ACA standards in issuing a consent decree, but observing that the standards \ndid not establish the constitutional minimum in a challenge to double-celling); \nPayette  v.  Hoenisch,  284  F.  App’x  348,  352  (7th  Cir.  2008)  (citing  the  ACA \nstandards as “[c]onsistent with” constitutional holdings on permissible conditions of \nconfinement); Duran v. Elrod, 760 F.2d 756, 759 (7th Cir. 1985) (concluding that \n“the Constitution does not forbid” a specific practice at odds with ACA standards); \nsee also Axelson, 746 F. App’x at 602 (observing that “compliance with ACA’s \nminimum standards did not establish” compliance with the Eighth Amendment). \n \n4 Standards & Accreditation, ACA, \nhttp://www.aca.org/aca_prod_imis/aca_member/ACA_Member/Standards_and_Ac\ncreditation/StandardsInfo_Home.aspx (last visited July 24, 2020).   \n13 \n \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 42            Filed: 07/24/2020      Pages: 40\n \nPrison Rape Eliminate Act (PREA) Standards: These standards were created \n \npursuant to the Prison Rape Elimination Act, which Congress passed in 2003 to \n“develop and implement national standards for the detection, prevention, reduction, \nand punishment of prison rape.” 34 U.S.C. § 30302(3). The final PREA standards \nare the result of a nine-year process, involving a massive study by the National \nPrison  Rape  Elimination  Commission  and  the  issuance  of  notice-and-comment \nregulations by DOJ based on the Commission’s proposals. See National Prison Rape \nElimination  Commission  Report,  NAT’L CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFERENCE SERVICE \n(June 2009). Although the PREA standards reflect expertise and rigorous process, \nCongress did not make them binding on local or state prisons. See 34 U.S.C. § \n30307(b). Courts have therefore considered the PREA standards in cases arising \nfrom carceral settings while emphasizing that they do not control the constitutional \ninquiry. See J.K.J. v. Polk Cty., 960 F.3d 367, 384 (7th Cir. 2020) (en banc) (“PREA \nis not a constitutional standard, and jails are not required to adopt it.”); see also id. \n(treating the fact that the defendants had “scoffed at PREA” as supporting the jury’s \nevidentiary finding that the defendants had engaged in deliberate inaction). \nAgency Guidelines: State and federal agency guidelines take many shapes, \nreflect varied levels of expert study, and address themselves to diverse issues. In \ngeneral, where prisons comply with expert agency guidelines that credibly establish \nbaseline health and safety standards for the general public, that compliance warrants \n14 \n \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 42            Filed: 07/24/2020      Pages: 40\n \nsubstantial deference because the Constitution does not require correctional facilities \n \nto be safer than the rest of American society. See, e.g., Carroll, 255 F.3d at 472-73 \n(holding that a prison’s compliance with EPA safety standards governing acceptable \nlevels of lead and radium in the water supply defeated an Eighth Amendment claim); \nForbes v. Edgar, 112 F.3d 262, 267 (7th Cir. 1997) (relying, in part, on a prison’s \ncompliance with CDC tuberculosis treatment guidelines to conclude that a warden \nhad not shown deliberate indifference to the risk of infection). In contrast, where \nagency guidance sets a standard that is unreasonable as applied in a particular setting, \ncourts assign it little weight in the constitutional analysis. See, e.g., Darrah v. \nKrisher, 865 F.3d 361, 369 (6th Cir. 2017) (holding that limited compliance with an \nOhio Department of Medical Health treatment plan was irrelevant where the specific \ntreatment at issue was nonetheless plainly unreasonable); French v. Owens, 777 F.2d \n1250, 1257 (7th Cir. 1985) (“The eighth amendment does not . . . require complete \ncompliance with the numerous OSHA regulations.”).  \nAs these examples demonstrate, compliance with agency and professional \norganization standards is never conclusive under the Constitution. At most, it has \nsome relevance in some cases as to some kinds of standards. The key question is \nalways whether compliance with a particular standard in fact sheds light on whether \nan official acted in an objectively reasonable manner given the facts before them.  \n15 \n \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 42            Filed: 07/24/2020      Pages: 40\n \nII.  THE CDC GUIDELINES AT ISSUE HERE ARE ENTITLED TO \n \nLITTLE WEIGHT IN DUE PROCESS CLAUSE ANALYSIS \n \nThe district court concluded that the Sheriff’s attempted compliance with \nCDC guidelines was relevant but not determinative of the objective reasonableness \nof his conduct. See Mays, 2020 WL 1987007 at *27 (“[T]he CDC Guidelines are an \nimportant piece of evidence to consider in assessing the Sheriff’s conduct, but they \ncannot be appropriately viewed as dispositive standing alone.”). In reaching this \nconclusion, the district court navigated a middle ground between the parties, who \nframed the CDC guidelines are conclusive (the Sheriff) or irrelevant (Plaintiffs). \nThis was a reasonable conclusion. Contrary to the Sheriff’s position on appeal, the \ndistrict court neither erred nor contravened the CDC guidelines in finding that his \ndecision  to  continue  using  group  housing  and  double  celling  was  objectively \nunreasonable.  \nThere are several features of the CDC guidelines that support the district \ncourt’s middle ground approach: (1) they were created by a respected agency with \nexpertise in controlling the spread of infectious diseases; (2) they were nonetheless \ncreated in the early days of the pandemic and have not been subject to active expert \nrefinement in light of new public health data; and (3) they contain a broad, vague \nfeasibility carve-out that is not itself based on any expert judgment about how to \nensure health and safety in custody during the pandemic. We will discuss each of \nthese points in turn and then return to the district court’s analysis.  \n16 \n \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 42            Filed: 07/24/2020      Pages: 40\n \nFirst, the CDC is an agency with substantial expertise in controlling the spread \n \nof infectious disease—and the guidelines do contain extensive recommendations \nabout how best to slow the spread of the coronavirus in jails, prisons, and other \ndetention facilities. These recommendations, moreover, are broadly consistent with \nthe CDC’s public health advice to the general public. That is particularly true of the \nCDC’s position on the importance of social distancing, which the guidelines describe \nas  a  “cornerstone”  of  reducing  disease  transmission  and  which  the  CDC  has \nelsewhere described as the “best way” to reduce the spread of the virus.5 This \naccords with the overwhelming public health consensus that social distancing is the \n“only way to prevent . . . uncontrolled spread of the virus.” Gonsalves Declaration ¶ \n29 (Dkt. 55-7), Mays v. Dart, No. 20 Civ. 2134 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 14, 2020); see also \nMohareb Declaration at 6 (Dkt. 64-3), Mays v. Dart, No. 20 Civ. 2134 (N.D. Ill. Apr. \n19, 2020) (“Without social distancing, medical experience demonstrates that the rate \nof transmission will be rampant and uncontrolled.”).  \nSecond, although the CDC guidelines set forth useful and relevant scientific \nadvice, they did not result from the sort of deliberative process or empirical research \nthat ordinarily leads courts to defer to third party standards (such as the ACA and \nPREA standards). Indeed, the CDC issued its guidelines—without public comment \n \n5 See Social Distancing, CDC, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html (last visited July 24, 2020). \n17 \n \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 42            Filed: 07/24/2020      Pages: 40\n \nand amid reports of improper political interference6—just a few weeks after COVID-\n \n19  came  to  be  widely  recognized  as  an  urgent  public  health  crisis.  Since  the \nguidelines were issued on March 23, the CDC has issued only a single, partial \nupdate.7 In the meantime, nine of the ten largest COVID-19 outbreaks in the country \nhave been linked to jails, prisons, or detention centers, and the CDC has recognized \nthat jails and prisons are struggling (and often failing) to contain the outbreak.8 \nGiven the many issues the CDC is now facing, it is perhaps understandable that the \nagency has not moved more quickly to update these guidelines in light of the latest \npublic health data. But the minimal process surrounding issuance of the guidelines, \nas well as the CDC’s failure to actively revisit and revise them (or to draw upon \n \n6 See APHA condemns political interference in CDC work, AMERICAN PUBLIC \nHEALTH ASSOCIATION (May 18, 2020), https://www.apha.org/news-and-\nmedia/news-releases/apha-news-releases/2020/apha-supports-cdc; see also Mike \nStobbe and Bernard Condon, Coronavirus data is funneled away from CDC, \nsparking worries, ASSOCIATED PRESS (July 15, 2020), \nhttps://apnews.com/57de8f0d25d9066731e6bd8cad0373c4. \n7 The CDC also released supplemental guidance relating only to testing in jails and \nprisons but not to other preventative measures. See Interim Considerations for \nSARS-CoV-2 Testing in Correctional and Detention Facilities, CDC (July 7, 2020), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-\ndetention/testing.html. These recommendations are not at issue here. \n8 See Coronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case Count, N.Y.

They are thus different in kind than the ACA and PREA standards. \nTo be sure, most of the language in the guidelines looks something like a health and \nsafety standard. That includes the suite of recommended measures within jails and \nprisons that echo the public health consensus on COVID-19 (e.g., calling for regular \ncleaning, infection control through the use of personal protective equipment, testing \nand tracing, and medical isolation of individuals who test positive). See Venters \nDeclaration ¶ 19 (Dkt. 64-2), Mays v. Dart, No. 20 Civ. 2131 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 19, \n2020). It also includes the guidelines’ heavy emphasis on social distancing, which \ntracks a broader expert consensus that social distancing is crucial to reducing disease \ntransmission. See supra at 17. \nBut then the guidelines assert that officials need not do any of that if they \nconclude it is not “feasible.” More precisely, the guidelines note that “[n]ot all \nstrategies will be feasible in all facilities,” and that social distancing will accordingly \n“need to be tailored to the individual space in the facility and the needs of the \npopulation and staff.” These “feasibility carveouts” are not presented as conclusions \nreflecting the CDC’s unique expertise. Nor are they presented as arising from any \nsound principle of public health policy. That is because they are not. See Venters \n19 \n \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 42            Filed: 07/24/2020      Pages: 40\n \nDecl. ¶ 18 (“The fact that the CDC adds the phrase ‘if possible’ or ‘if space allows’ \n \nin its guidance specifically directed at detention centers . . . does not alter the clear \nmedical consensus on social distancing.”). Rather, the CDC appears to have simply \nasserted that standard public health measures—which it elsewhere urges the public \nto  follow—may  be  weakened  in  jails  without  any  health-  or  safety-based \njustification whatsoever. This is a bizarre carveout, given that the risk of disease \ntransmission (and the need for preventive measures) is much greater for detained \npersons than members of the general public.9  \nOn its face, this unexplained, unscientific feasibility carveout makes the CDC \nguidelines entirely different from the standards that federal courts occasionally \nconsider in assessing objective reasonableness under the Constitution. The normal \ncourse would be for the CDC to issue guidelines aimed at ensuring health and safety; \nfor officials to adopt policies appropriate for their own jails; and for courts to assess \nthe  constitutional  adequacy  of  those  policies  with  reference  to  the  CDC’s \nstandards.10 In contrast, it is abnormal for an agency to itself say that health and \n \n9 See Brendan Saloner, Kalind Paris, Julie A.

As the district court \nconcluded, “from a constitutional-law standpoint, it is difficult to believe that ‘do \nwhat  you  can,  but  if  you  can’t,  so  be  it’  satisfies  a  jailer’s  obligation  to  take \nobjectively reasonable steps to mitigate known risks to the life and health of people \nin his custody who are detained awaiting determination of their guilt or innocence.” \nMays, 2020 WL 1987007 at *27.  \nIn sum, the CDC guidelines contain many recommendations about health and \nsafety procedures in the carceral setting that reflect a reasoned exercise of agency \nexpertise and that are consistent with its general advice  about slowing disease \ntransmission. These include its recommendations about the central role of social \ndistancing. However, the CDC guidelines were produced in the early days of the \npandemic,  without  public  comment,  and  have  seen  no  relevant  updates  since. \nMoreover, they contain a broad feasibility carveout that is not presented as arising \nfrom any settled public health principle and that the CDC does not claim is meant to \nadvance health and safety in a carceral setting. The district court therefore concluded \nthat the CDC’s recommendations are particularly compelling as to the importance \nof social distancing—and that they lack persuasive force to the extent they give \nofficials like the Sheriff carte blanche to ignore public health principles wherever \n21 \n \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 42            Filed: 07/24/2020      Pages: 40\n \nthey deem compliance infeasible. See id. at *26–27. This decision was reasonable \n \nand consistent with precedent. See supra at 6–11. The Sheriff’s position should \ntherefore be rejected, and the decision below affirmed.  \n \n*  *  *  *  * \nThe Sheriff made a policy decision with respect to group housing and double \ncelling  that  makes  social  distancing—the  single  most  effective  preventive \nmeasure—impossible for hundreds of detainees at the Cook County Jail. As the \ndistrict court found, this conduct violated the Due Process Clause. Contrary to the \nSheriff’s assertions, it is not salvaged by his attempted compliance with the CDC \nguidelines, which quite unusually suggest that measures essential to preserving \ndetainee health and safety can be ignored if they are difficult or costly to implement. \nNeither common sense nor the Constitution countenances that conclusion, which \nwould undermine core safeguards, and which is at odds with this Court’s precedents.  \n   \n22 \n \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 42            Filed: 07/24/2020      Pages: 40\n \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, amici respectfully request that this Court \naffirm the judgment below. \n \nDated:  July 24, 2020 \n \n \n                     Respectfully Submitted, \n                     /s/ Joshua Matz       \n           \nOSHUA  ATZ\nJ M   \nAPLAN  ECKER    INK \n              K H &F LLP \n  IFTH  VENUE    UITE \n              350F A |S 7110 \nEW  ORK   \n              N Y ,NY10118 \n               (212) 763-0883 \n              jmatz@kaplanhecker.com \nCounsel for Amici Curiae   \n23 \n \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 42            Filed: 07/24/2020      Pages: 40\nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE \nCounsel for amici curiae certifies that this brief contains 5,282 words, based \non the “Word Count” feature of Microsoft Word 2016.   \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32(a)(7)(B)(iii), this word \ncount does not include the words contained in the Corporate Disclosure Statement, \nTable of Contents, Table of Authorities, and Certificates of Counsel.

KENNELLY, District Judge, as emergency judge: \n  On April 27, 2020, the Court granted in part the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary \ninjunction in this class action lawsuit regarding conditions at the Cook County Jail, \nordering some of the relief sought by the plaintiffs but denying a number of their \nrequests.  See Mays v. Dart, No. 20 C 2134, 2020 WL 1987007 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 27, 2020) \n(\"Mays 2\").  The preliminary injunction tracked a temporary restraining order entered \nabout three weeks earlier but included one additional requirement.  See Mays v. Dart, \nNo. 20 C 2134, 2020 WL 1812381 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 9, 2020) (\"Mays 1\").   \n  The preliminary injunction also directed the Sheriff of Cook County—the \ndefendant in the case—to submit a report regarding compliance.  The Sheriff did this on \nMay 1, 2020.  On May 6, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a response to the Sheriff's report in \nwhich they sought expedited discovery, contending they needed this to determine \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 2 of 12 PageID #:2977\ncompliance with the preliminary injunction.  On May 11, the Sheriff objected and moved \nto strike the request for expedited discovery.  Also on May 11, the Sheriff filed a notice \nof appeal from the preliminary injunction.  Eight days after that, on May 19—a little over \nthree weeks after entry of the preliminary injunction—the Sheriff moved for a stay \npending appeal and repeated his request to strike the plaintiffs' proposed expedited \ndiscovery requests.  At the request of the judge assigned to the case, the undersigned \njudge, acting as emergency judge, directed the plaintiffs to respond to the stay motion \nthe next day and heard argument on the Sheriff's stay motion as well as the plaintiffs' \nexpedited discovery request on May 21, 2020. \n  For the reasons stated below, the Court denies the Sheriff's motion to stay the \npreliminary injunction pending appeal and also denies the plaintiffs' request for \nexpedited discovery. \nDiscussion \n  Familiarity with the Court's temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction \ndecisions is assumed.  The plaintiffs in this case contend that the Sheriff is violating the \nFourteenth Amendment due process rights of persons detained at the Jail by failing to \nprovide them with reasonably safe living conditions in the face of the coronavirus \npandemic.  In their motion for a preliminary injunction (as in their TRO motion), the \nplaintiffs sought wide-ranging relief.  This included mandatory social distancing of \ndetained persons throughout the Jail—relief that would amount to universal single-\ncelling and then some; transfer of detained persons to electronic home monitoring; and \nconvening a three-judge court under the Prison Litigation Reform Act to consider the \nrelease of detained persons.  The plaintiffs also sought measures to identify and \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 3 of 12 PageID #:2978\nseparate medically vulnerable detained persons and to require coronavirus testing, \ncleaning of Jail facilities, and provision of personal protective equipment. \n  After extensive briefing and hearings, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motions, \nbut only in part.  The Court entered a TRO including certain requirements on April 9 and \na preliminary injunction with those same requirements plus one more on April 27.  On \nboth occasions, however, the Court overruled the plaintiffs' requests for sweeping \nremedies, declining their requests to release detainees with medical vulnerabilities, \nmandate full \"social distancing\" throughout the jail, and convene a three-judge court to \nprisoner releases. \n  The Sheriff has moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal, and \nplaintiffs have moved for expedited discovery to assess the Sheriff's compliance with \nthe injunction.  The Court addresses each request in turn. \n1.  Stay pending appeal \n  In deciding whether to stay an order pending appeal, a court considers whether \nthe movant \"has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits\"; \nwhether the movant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; whether a stay \"will \nsubstantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding\"; and \"where the public \ninterest lies.\"  Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987). \n  a.  Movant's likelihood of success \n  The Sheriff has not made a \"strong showing\" of likelihood of success.  The \nrecord before the Court when it issued the preliminary injunction reflected that the \npeople detained at the Jail faced a real and persistent danger to their health.  As of April \n9, when the Court issued a temporary restraining order that embodied most of the relief \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 4 of 12 PageID #:2979\nextended via the preliminary injunction, the Jail had the largest single concentration of \nconfirmed coronavirus infections in the entire country.  See Mays 1, 2020 WL 1812381, \nat *2.  At the time of the preliminary injunction, although the number of positive-tested \ndetained persons in isolation had declined, the overall positive test numbers were \ncontinuing to increase (350 on April 17 vs. 289 on April 10), indicating that the virus was \ncontinuing to spread within the Jail.  See Def.'s Resp. to Pls.' Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 2-3.  \nBefore the issuance of the TRO and the preliminary injunction, the Sheriff had, \nundeniably, taken steps to attempt to stem the spread of the virus.  But the Constitution \ndoes not say that so long as a jailer does something, he complies with constitutional \nobligations.  Rather, if jailer does not take objectively reasonable steps to protect \ndetained persons from a known and serious risk, he violates the Fourteenth \nAmendment.  The Court concluded that plaintiffs had established a reasonable \nlikelihood of showing the objective unreasonableness of some of the Sheriff's actions or \ninaction. \n  In seeking a stay of the preliminary injunction, the Sheriff contends that he has \nconsistently acted in good faith, and the Court does not dispute this.  But the Sheriff's \nintent was not and is not the issue.  The law in this Circuit is clear that conditions of \nconfinement cases involving pretrial detainees are judged by a standard of objective \nreasonableness, not by assessing whether the Sheriff had good or bad intentions.  See, \ne.g., Hardeman v. Curran, 933 F.3d 816, 823-24 (7th Cir. 2019).  The Court notes that \nin this regard, this case is nothing like two cases cited by the Sheriff in his motion to \nstay, in which appellate courts granted stays of coronavirus-related preliminary \ninjunctions.  See Swain v. Junior, 958 F.3d 1051 (11th Cir. 2020); Valentine v. Collier, \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 5 of 12 PageID #:2980\n956 F.3d 797 (11th Cir. 2020).  The courts in those cases found a significant likelihood \nof success on the part of the jailer largely due to the absence of evidence that the jailer \nexhibited the intent required by those Circuits, specifically, deliberate indifference.  That \nis not the standard that applies in this Circuit or in this case.  The Sheriff may not have \nexhibited deliberate indifference, but that is not the same as saying that his actions or \ninaction were objectively reasonable.   \n  The Sheriff also contends that his approach has worked, citing decreases in the \nincidence of new coronavirus cases at the Jail over the last several weeks.  There are at \nleast two problems with this argument.  First, it amounts to 20/20 hindsight.  The Court \nruled, and had to rule, based on the record as it was presented at the time, not based \non how things turned out several weeks later.  Second, the TRO and preliminary \ninjunction directed the Sheriff to take steps he was not already taking or was not taking \nin an effective way.  In particular, the Court's orders directed the Sheriff to do the \nfollowing: \n•  cease the use of crowded \"bullpens\" holding multiple detained persons at intake; \n•  (on the preliminary injunction) enforce social distancing in most of the Jail; \n•  obtain and distribute facemasks to persons exposed to infected or quarantined \ndetainees; \n•  establish a Sheriff's Office policy to implement prompt testing for detained \npersons exhibiting symptoms of coronavirus disease; \n•  enable actual, not just theoretical, access to adequate sanitation supplies; and \n•  actually enforce cleaning and sanitation requirements in areas of the Jail \naccessed in common, such as showers, bathrooms, and day rooms. \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 6 of 12 PageID #:2981\nThe Sheriff's argument about positive results does not account for the very real \npossibility that the measures ordered by the Court at the TRO and preliminary injunction \nstage contributed to those results. \n  On the merits, the Sheriff's primary argument appears to be that guidelines for \nprison and jail administrators issued by the Centers for Disease Control are \ndeterminative of the question of objective reasonableness and that he has consistently \ncomplied with them.  This contention likewise has at least two flaws.  First, the Sheriff \nhas cited no authority establishing that an externally-created set of guidelines like these \namounts to a constitutional measuring stick.  Rather, the law in this Circuit is that such \nguidelines are relevant in determining objective reasonableness, but not determinative.  \nSee, e.g., United States v. Brown, 871 F.3d 532, 538 (7th Cir. 2017); Thompson v. City \nof Chicago, 472 F.3d 444, 454 (7th Cir. 1996).  In the respect most pertinent to this \ncase, the CDC guidelines set a feasibility or practicality limitation that, the Court \nconcluded, could not be determinative of the constitutional question presented by \nplaintiffs' claims.  Second, and perhaps just as importantly, the record established that \nthe Jail had not yet reached feasibility limitations regarding the spacing of detained \npersons:  the Jail's executive director so testified at the preliminary injunction hearing, \nindicating that the Jail had additional space that could be used to further spread out \ndetainees.  Thus the record reflected that the Sheriff's practices in this particular respect \ndid not measure up to the CDC guidelines. \n  Next, contrary to the Sheriff's contention, the Court did not fail to give appropriate \ndeference to the Sheriff's expertise or his interest in appropriate management of the \nJail.  To the contrary, the Court did exactly what the law requires.  See Mays 2, 2020 \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 7 of 12 PageID #:2982\nWL 1987007, at *27 (citing Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2073 (2015); Bell \nv. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547 (1979)).  Indeed, the Court rejected, both at the TRO and \npreliminary injunction stages, much—in fact most—of the relief sought by plaintiffs.  \nSpecifically, the Court declined to: \n•  order the Sheriff to identify and triage detained persons believed to be medically \nvulnerable; \n•  relocate vulnerable detainees to custodial (and perhaps non-custodial) locations \nother than the Jail; \n•  mandate full social distancing throughout the Jail; \n•  distribute personal protective equipment to every detained person; \n•  institute a robust program of coronavirus testing of all detainees throughout the \nJail; and \n•  convene a three-judge court to consider releasing detained persons from the Jail.  \nOn each of these points, the Court either found that plaintiffs were unlikely to be able to \nshow the Sheriff's actions were objectively unreasonable, or deferred to the Sheriff's \nexpertise and discretion, or both. \n  One certainly understand why, as a strategic matter, the Sheriff's motion for a \nstay omits any reference to what the Court did not order.  But a look at the full picture \nconfirms that the Court followed a careful and restrained approach, honoring both the \nconstitutional entitlement of detained persons to reasonable measures to protect their \nphysical health and the Sheriff's legitimate interest in maintaining security, preserving \norder, and making discretionary determinations regarding allocation of resources.  The \nlaw is clear that a court must consider both.  The Supreme Court has stated that \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 8 of 12 PageID #:2983\nalthough courts must be \"sensitive to . . . the need for deference to experienced and \nexpert prison administrators,\" they \"nevertheless must not shrink from their obligation to \n“enforce the constitutional rights of all persons, including prisoners.  Courts may not \nallow constitutional violations to continue simply because a remedy would involve \nintrusion into the realm of prison administration.\"  Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 492, 511 \n(2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \n  In sum, the Court concludes that the Sheriff has not shown, let along \"strongly\" \nshown, that he is likely to succeed on appeal.  \n  b.  Irreparable injury to movant \n  The Sheriff's argument regarding irreparable injury likewise falls short.  In fact, \nthe Sheriff's position on this point is internally inconsistent.  One the one hand, he \ncontends that the Court has \"undermine[d]\" his \"thoughtful and reasonable\" approach to \nthe coronavirus pandemic as it affects the Jail.  Def.'s Mot. to Stay at 13.  On the other \nhand, he contends that the Court has essentially ordered him to do what he was already \ndoing, id. at 12, thereby inserting itself as an unnecessary watchdog.  Both cannot be \ntrue at the same time.  The fact is that the Court has done neither.  The Court observes, \nthough, that it is difficult to see how the Sheriff will experience \"irreparable harm\" if he \nhas to comply with the injunction by doing what he says he would do anyway. \n  The Sheriff says that the additional burden imposed by court oversight amounts \nto irreparable harm.  The upshot of this argument, however, is that any party appealing \nan injunction would automatically meet the irreparable harm requirement for a stay—\nbecause an injunction is, after all, an injunction.  This cannot be the case.  That aside, \nthe Court has not imposed any monitoring requirements beyond the initial compliance \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 9 of 12 PageID #:2984\nreport, which the Sheriff filed over three weeks ago and thus which cannot possibly \nconstitute irreparable harm.  The Court declined plaintiffs' requests to appoint outside \nmonitors and to permit inspections of the Jail's facilities.  \n  Finally, at argument, the Sheriff's counsel seemed to suggest that the fact that \nthe plaintiffs had served discovery requests and were thereby trying to, in effect, stick \ntheir noses into his operations and decision-making amounts to irreparable harm.  This \ncannot be the case either.  Again, as the Sheriff's counsel conceded, a case does not \nend with a preliminary injunction; it is commonplace for discovery to proceed in a lawsuit \neven after a preliminary injunction is issued.  So dealing with discovery requests cannot \npossibly constitute irreparable harm either.  (Regardless, as discussed below, the Court \nis relieving the Sheriff of the burden of responding to plaintiffs' discovery requests at this \ntime).    \n  Last but not least on the question of irreparable harm, it is noteworthy that the \nSheriff waited more than three weeks after the issuance of the preliminary injunction \nbefore moving for a stay.  This cuts against the contention that the Sheriff has \nexperienced, or will experience, much harm at all, let alone harm appropriately \nconsidered to be irreparable.1  \n   \n                                            \n1 It may be that the Sheriff's real concern involves the potential for future problems \nshould increased population at the Jail limit his ability to comply with social distancing \nrequirements.  On this, though, it is worth noting that the Court specifically invited the \nSheriff to make a request to include certain at-risk detainees among those who may be \nappropriately detained in group housing, see Mays 2, 2020 WL 1987007, at *34, and to \nreturn to court to loosen the preliminary injunction's requirements if changed \ncircumstances call for it, see id. at *37.  The Sheriff has not taken the Court up on either \ninvitation. \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 10 of 12 PageID #:2985\n  c.  Injury to parties other than movant \n  The next question is whether a stay will risk substantial injury to other interested \nparties, specifically to the plaintiff class.  This is essentially the flip side of the point just \naddressed.  The Sheriff did not voluntarily take all of the coronavirus-protective \nmeasures that he cites.  Some were done pursuant to court order—either the TRO, or \nthe preliminary injunction, or both.  Staying the injunction would permit the Sheriff to lift  \nmeasures and thereby again place the health of detained persons at serious risk.  That \nrisk cannot be discounted based on the Sheriff's assurances alone.  Again, a number of \nthe measures he took were instituted only after the Court's TRO or preliminary \ninjunction.  See Mays 2, 2020 WL 1987007, at *29.  The Court finds that there is at least \nsome risk of substantial injury to detained persons if the preliminary injunction is stayed.   \n  d.  The public interest \n  On the question of the public interest, the Sheriff cites Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. \n418, 435 (2009), for the proposition that the Sheriff, as a public official, effectively \nembodies the public interest.  See Def.'s Mot. to Stay at 19.  It is not quite that simple.  \nHere the Sheriff is charged with protecting not just the public at large, but also the \ndetained persons placed in his custody, all or nearly all of whom have family members \non the outside.  Their interests are part of the public interest.  And the detained persons' \nconstitutional rights—and their health and lives—are at stake.  It is anything but clear \nthat the Sheriff can claim the public interest mantle entirely for himself.   \n  For the reasons described, the Court concludes that the Sheriff has not met the \nrequirements for a stay of the preliminary injunction.  The Court therefore denies his \nmotion to stay.   \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 11 of 12 PageID #:2986\n2.  Plaintiffs' request for expedited discovery \n  As the Court indicated earlier, and as the Sheriff's counsel conceded at \nargument, the appeal of a preliminary injunction does not require the rest of the case to \ncome to a halt in the district court.  Put another way, a preliminary injunction is not the \nfinal resolution of a case.  It follows that a party who is preliminarily enjoined is not \nrelieved of the obligation to provide discovery in response to appropriate requests.  In \naddition, as the Sheriff likewise conceded at argument, an appeal does not prevent the \ndistrict court from enforcing a preliminary injunction.  See, e.g., Union Oil Co. of Calif. v. \nLeavell, 220 F.3d 562, 565-66 (7th Cir. 2000). \n  Plaintiffs' discovery requests, they say, are aimed at determining compliance.  \nThis is plainly not the case for all of them; some involve matters beyond the relief the \nCourt ordered in the injunction.  But this does not make those particular requests \ninappropriate.  They are within the realm of permissible discovery for the ongoing \nlitigation of the case—which, again, does not end with the issuance of a preliminary \ninjunction.   The same is true of the plaintiffs' other requests; all of them appear to be \nwithin the scope of permissible discovery under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n26(b)(1).   \n  Defendants say that the Court should, and perhaps must, put the brakes on the \nplaintiffs' requested discovery because of the appeal.  The question of whether and to \nwhat extent plaintiffs may engage in discovery, however, is not an emergency issue \nwithin the scope of the undersigned judge's role as emergency judge.  The only aspect \nthat is urgent is the request for expedited discovery; that is what the undersigned judge \ntook on when requested by the assigned judge to handle the motions for a stay and for \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 12 of 12 PageID #:2987\nexpedited discovery. \n  All of that aside, the Court concludes that the expedited discovery requests have \nnot been properly served.  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 26(d), a party \n\"may not seek discovery\" before the parties have conferred under Rule 26(f) or unless \nauthorized by the Rules, a stipulation, or a court order.  None of this has happened in \nthis case.  In particular, at the time the discovery had been served there had been no \nRule 26(f) conference.   \n  For these reasons, the Court directs that the Sheriff need not answer plaintiffs' \ncurrent discovery requests.  At the conclusion of the oral argument on the present \nmotions on May 21, the Court directed the parties to submit a proposed scheduling \norder to the assigned judge by June 2, 2020 and to conduct their Rule 26(f) conference \nbefore that.   Plaintiffs may re-serve their discovery requests following the Rule 26(f) \nconference and may, if appropriate, move the assigned judge to permit expedited \ndiscovery.  \nConclusion \n  For the reasons stated above, the Court denies defendant's motion to stay the \npreliminary injunction pending appeal [dkt. no. 98] and denies plaintiffs' motion for \nexpedited discovery [dkt. no. 85]. \nDate:  May 29, 2020 \n              ________________________________ \n                MATTHEW F.

Dart is currently confining close to 5,000 people in conditions \nwithin the Cook County Jail that threaten their lives. At the time of this filing, at least 167 detainees \nand 46 staff members in the Jail have tested positive for the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-\n19—though the Sheriff has not updated that figure for several days. The Sheriff is not taking \nreasonable, appropriate measures to halt the further spread of this deadly virus, putting the lives \nand health of thousands of people in the Jail, and countless others in the community, at risk. The \nDue Process Clause of the United States Constitution forbids this. \nPlaintiffs seek to represent the class1 of all individuals jailed by Dart, and two subclasses. \nSubclass A consists of all people who, because of age or previous medical conditions, are at \nparticularly grave risk of harm from COVID-19. Subclass B consists of all people who are \ncurrently housed on a tier where someone has already tested positive for the coronavirus. Subclass \nA seeks immediate release through a petition for habeas corpus because there are no feasible \nconditions  under  which  they  may  currently  be  constitutionally  confined  under  present \ncircumstances at the Jail; the entire Class seeks a temporary restraining order and preliminary \ninjunction requiring Dart to implement constitutionally-sufficient procedures to protect their \nsafety; and Subclass B seeks a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction requiring \nDart to remove or transfer them to a safe facility or other form of custody.  \nBecause of the grave risk to health and life at stake, Plaintiffs request that this Court \nconsider this motion on an emergency basis and that the Court grant a temporary restraining \n \n1 Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification is pending. Plaintiffs file this motion on behalf of the putative \nclass members, but for ease of reference, describe them as “class members” throughout this brief. Although this is a \nprototypical case for which the class action vehicle was created, the Court need not rule on Plaintiffs’ class \ncertification motion or formally certify a class in order to issue the requested emergency relief. See, e.g., Newberg \non Class Actions § 24:83 (4th ed. 2002) (“The absence of formal certification is no barrier to classwide preliminary \ninjunctive relief.”); Moore’s Federal Practice § 23.50, at 23-396, 23-397 (2d ed.1990) (“Prior to the Court’s \ndetermination whether plaintiffs can maintain a class action, the Court should treat the action as a class suit.”). \nSlightly more than 100 people in the jail are serving sentences, and they are excluded from the Class.  \n1 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 2 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 4 of 21 PageID #:73\n \norder requiring the release of Subclass A members pending briefing and argument.

Id. \nThese realities are particularly frightening for members of Subclass A, who are vulnerable, \nat elevated risk of contracting serious COVID-19, and who may suffer acute, painful symptoms or \ndeath.  These realities are underscored by the supporting declarations filed with the Complaint. \nMoreover, an outbreak within the Jail cannot be confined to those incarcerated there. Jails are \nnot—and cannot become—isolated facilities.

As of the filing of this motion, on \nApril 3, 2020, there are 167 known infections.13  The graph below14 displays this grim reality: \n  \nThe number of known infections will continue to rise.  Indeed, there are likely now many \nmore infections in the Jail than are known because of the limited availability of COVID-19 tests, \nand medical staff to administer temperature checks that can detect symptoms of the diease.  \n \n13 This number has almost certainly been surpassed; the Sheriff’s Department has not updated data of its testing \nsince April 1, 2020.   \n14   Injustice Watch, Cook County Jail population and COVID-19 tracker, \nhttps://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/1AI4THiXJ_6Nt-\n9NXwE0MfO_DUaa1Koxi/page/hcyJB?s=oQGghs5nYPk  (“CCJ COVID-19 Tracker”) (last visited April 3, 2020).  \n6 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 2 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 9 of 21 PageID #:78\n \nHundreds of detainees are being quarantined, with a number of suspicious cases almost equal to \nthe number of confirmed, positive cases.

A group of prominent Illinois doctors with \nextensive individual and collective experience in corrections medicine puts the problem this way: \nAt a time when the President's task force on COVID-19 recommends limiting gatherings \nto no more than 10 persons, the President has declared a national emergency and there is a \nstay-at-home order in Illinois through at least April 30, 2020, the County of Cook is forcing \nover 4,700 people to live in congregate living conditions at the Cook County Jail with a \ncontinuing influx of new inmates every day.  These inmates intermingle and it is not \npossible to attain the President's aim of limiting gatherings of less than 10 individuals or \nengage in social distancing.  This is contrary to the President’s recommendation, the Illinois \nstay-at-home order, and to current public health recommendations.  These circumstances \nare likely to result in spread of disease. \n \nPuisis et al. ¶ 23. \nThere are also multiple reports that the Jail’s system for quarantine and medical isolation \nis flawed. For example, one detainee reports that, after a detainee who had tested positive for \nCOVID-19 was removed from his tier for medical isolation, that person’s cellmate was rehoused \non the tier with another detainee.  Complaint, ECF 1 ¶ 35.   Detainees uniformly report that, when \n7 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 2 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 10 of 21 PageID #:79\n \na detainee who is symptomatic or who has tested positive for COVID 19 is removed from a tier, \nno measures are taken to quarantine the others on the tier who were exposed.  Id. Others report \nthat their division is in quarantine, and yet detainees continue to share bathroom and shower areas, \nand common living areas. Id. \nSecond, the Jail has no functioning system to enable prisoners to protect themselves from \nexposure. Corrections staff in the Jail now wear masks, but there are no masks available to the \ndetainees, a precaution that, under these congregate living conditions and with many known \nCOVID infections, is essential. Puisis et al. ¶ 31.  The Jail’s aging physical plant is unsanitary and \ndetainees have no ability to mitigate filthy conditions.  There are no cleaning supplies to use to \ndisinfect the common showers, common sinks and common toilets that detainees to continue to \nuse.  Complaint, ECF 1 ¶ 35.  Soap and hand sanitizer are unavailable for many, if not the majority, \nof those confined in the Jail.  Id.   \nIn this face of this dysfunction, COVID-19 will continue its unrelenting spread through the \nJail.  Under accepted standards of medical care and the CDC Guidance, quarantine will be \nnecessary for greater and greater numbers of detainees. As this happens, it will become more and \nmore difficult to separate those who are infected (or might be infected) from those who are not.  \nPuisis et al. ¶ 17.  Necessary monitoring of the temperature and other symptoms of those who are \nor are suspected to be infected will become overwhelming. To the extent that medical management \nof these quarantined individuals is not already impossible, it will become so. See id. ¶ 16.  \nAll of these problems are magnified by the risks to the health and safety of medical workers \nin the Jail, which will limit the Jail’s ability to manage and monitor those who are in quarantine \nand those in medical isolation. Puisis et al. ¶ 18. As the virus spreads and healthcare staff are \nincreasingly infected, Cook County’s public healthcare system will be stretched to breaking.  The \n8 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 2 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 11 of 21 PageID #:80\n \nJail has limited facilities for isolating and caring for acutely ill detainees.  By the Jail’s report, 14 \ndetainees have already been transferred to Stroger Hospital with serious COVID-19.   The urgent \nnecessity of focusing on the spread of COVID-19 and the treatment of those who are infected has \nlimited the Jail’s ability to provide medication and other needed treatment to non-COVID patients.  \nPuisis et al. ¶ 18. If immediate action is not taken, many detainees and jail staff may die as a result. \nThe dire state of affairs in the Jail is underscored by the declarations submitted on behalf \nof class members and the named Plaintiffs, see Complaint, ECF 1. These detail the prevalence of \nlife-endangering conditions in the Jail, in different tiers and divisions, where detainees face: \nexposure to COVID-19 positive or symptomatic detainees, lack of cleaning supplies, sanitizing \nagents and even basic soap, lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), inability to engage in \nsocial distancing or indeed any distancing in dorm and double-celling living quarters with shared \nshower  and  bathroom  areas,  a  lack  of  adequate  medical  care,  including  for  detainees  with \nsymptoms of COVID-19, and a lack of clean shared living spaces. It is further solidified by the \ndescriptions of the Jail’s inadequate response to the pandemic, in a letter submitted by counsel for \na class of jail employees in an unrelated matter to Sheriff Dart, attached as Exhibit C to the \nComplaint. \nARGUMENT \nIn this case, Plaintiffs seek three forms of immediate relief.  Subclass A, the elderly and \nthe medically vulnerable, seek immediate release from the chaotic, infectious Jail environment \nthrough a writ of habeas corpus.  Their lives depend on how quickly they are released from that \nenvironment.  The Class as a whole seeks an order requiring the Jail to at least adhere to the CDC \nGuidance on the management of COVID-19 in jails and correctional settings, and to provide such \nother relief set forth in the Medical Professionals’ declaration,  Puisis et al. ¶¶ 27-37. Subclass B \nseeks transfer to a safe environment.   \n9 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 2 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 12 of 21 PageID #:81\n \nTo  determine  whether  a  party  is  entitled  to  a  preliminary  injunction  or  temporary \nrestraining order, “a district court engages in an analysis that proceeds in two distinct phases: a \nthreshold phase and a balancing phase.” Girl Scouts of Manitou Council, Inc. v. Girl Scouts of U.S. \nof Am., Inc., 549 F.3d 1079, 1085–86 (7th Cir. 2008). To meet the threshold standard, a party must \nshow that (1) “it will suffer irreparable harm in the interim period prior to final resolution of its \nclaims,” Ty, Inc. v. Jones Group, Inc., 237 F.3d 891, 895 (7th Cir.2001); (2) “traditional legal \nremedies would be inadequate,” Girl Scouts, 549 U.S. at 1086; and (3) “its claim has some \nlikelihood of succeeding on the merits,” id. Once these threshold requirements are met, the court \n“must somehow balance the nature and degree of the plaintiff’s injury, the likelihood of prevailing \nat trial, the possible injury to the defendant if the injunction is granted, and the wild card that is \nthe ‘public interest.’” Lawson Prods., Inc. v. Avnet, Inc., 782 F.2d 1429, 1433 (7th Cir. 1986). \nCourts in the Seventh Circuit employ a “sliding scale” approach to weigh these interests: “The \nmore likely the plaintiff is to win, the less heavily need the balance of harms weigh in his favor; \nthe less likely he is to win, the more need it weigh in his favor.” Roland Mach. Co. v. Dresser \nIndus., Inc., 749 F.2d 380, 389 (7th Cir. 1984). \nWhere circumstances are such that even the time needed to hear a request for a preliminary \ninjunction is too long to prevent irreparable harm, a temporary restraining order (T.R.O.) may issue \nwhile a court considers a request for a preliminary injunction. See Charles Alan Wright, et al., \nTemporary Restraining Orders, 11A Federal Practice and Procedure § 2951 (3d ed. 2019). Where, \nas here, the opposing party receives actual notice of the request for a T.R.O., the procedure courts \nfollow does not differ from an application for a preliminary injunction, and no special procedural \nrequirements apply. Id.; see also Budget Rent A Car Corp. v. Harvey Kidd Automotive, 249 F. \nSupp. 2d 1048, 1049 (N.D. Ill. 2003).  \n10 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 2 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 13 of 21 PageID #:82\n \nA.  Plaintiffs Have a Likelihood of Success on the Merits of Their Claim That the \nConditions in Which They Are Being Confined Are Unconstitutional. \nThe Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause prohibits the Government \nfrom treating the medical needs of incarcerated people with deliberate indifference, Estelle v. \nGamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103–04 (1976), and from exposing incarcerated individuals to conditions of \nconfinement that threaten their health and safety, Helling, 509 U.S. at 33. The Eighth Amendment, \nhowever, does not apply to pretrial detainees because they may not be punished at all. See Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 (1979); Darnell v. Pineiro, 849 F.3d 17, 29 (2d Cir. 2017) (noting that \ncivil detainees “have not been convicted of a crime and thus may not be punished in any manner—\nneither cruelly and unusually nor otherwise”). Instead, pretrial detainees are protected by the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which, the Supreme Court has held, affords them \nat least as much protection as the Eighth Amendment does. See City of Revere, 463 U.S. at 244. \nBecause they have not been convicted of a crime, and accordingly may not be punished at all, they \nare not required to show that their jailers act with a culpable state of mind, see also Miranda v. \nCounty of Lake, 900 F.3d 335, 354 (7th Cir. 2018); they must only show that they are being \ndeprived of objectively reasonable medical care, id.   \nAll detainees, pretrial or otherwise, have a right to be housed safely. That right is violated \nif they are “incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm,” and their \njailers’ “state of mind,” at least for convicted detainees, “is one of ‘deliberate indifference’ to \ninmate health or safety.” Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994). Specifically, the Supreme \nCourt has held that prison authorities are liable if they “ignore a condition of confinement that is \nsure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering.” Helling, 509 U.S. at 33. \nDetainees may not constitutionally be exposed to a severe risk of contracting a communicable \n11 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 2 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 14 of 21 PageID #:83\n \ndisease. Gates, 501 F.2d at 1291 (cited with approval in Helling, 509 U.S. at 34); see also Forbes \nv. Edgar, 112 F.3d 262, 266 (7th Cir. 1997) (noting that “exposure of inmates to a serious, \ncommunicable disease . . . can qualify [as a] deprivation . . . [that is] sufficiently serious; ); Jolly \nv. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 477 (2d Cir. 1996) (“[C]orrectional officials have an affirmative \nobligation to protect inmates from infectious disease.”); Lareau v. Manson, 651 F.2d 96, 109–11 \n(2d Cir. 1981). \nThis is not a complicated case on the law. Plaintiffs are being exposed to extreme and \nunprecedented risk of infection and death because of the failure of the Cook County Jail to meet \nthe  most  minimal  public  health  standards.  Plaintiffs  are  being  exposed  to  extreme  and \nunprecedented risk of infection and death because of the failure of the Cook County Jail to meet \nthe most minimal public health standards. Every person detained in the Cook County Jail under \nthe chaotic conditions that prevail and where the applicable CDC Guidance is being ignored and \ndisregarded will likely succeed on the merits of their Due Process claim.  \nB.  Traditional Legal Remedies Are Inadequate; Plaintiffs Will Be \nIrreparably Harmed If Interim Relief Is Not Granted. \n  The need for immediate relief to prevent irreparable harm could not be more clear.  \nPlaintiffs allege injuries that are irreparable and, therefore, not suitable for resolution in the \nordinary course of litigation. Girl Scouts, 549 U.S. at 1086. Injuries do not get more \nparadigmatically irreparable—that is any more truly beyond repair—than death. Additionally, \npeople who contract the coronavirus may develop symptoms that are acutely painful and may \nresult in permanent, irreparable lung damage. Class Action Complaint, ECF 1 ¶ 9. Courts across \nthe country, accordingly, have recognized that risk of exposure to the coronavirus constitutes an \nirreparable harm. See infra at 14-15 (collecting cases granting emergency release to people who \nare exposed to coronavirus). Plaintiffs easily allege irreparable harm.  \n12 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 2 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 15 of 21 PageID #:84\n \nC.  The Balance of Relative Harms and the Public Interest Favor Each of the \nThree Forms of Relief Plaintiffs Are Requesting. \n \nEach of the three forms of relief that the Plaintiff class seeks aims to limit the spread of \nCOVID-19 to the Class.  The Jail is not an isolated environment.  It cannot be contained or \nseparated from the community at large.  Uncontrolled infection within the Jail therefore risks the \nhealth and safety of every person connected directly or indirectly to the many correctional \nofficers, healthcare workers and other necessary staff who enter and leave the Jail environment \non a daily basis. Therefore, any remedy that will protect the Plaintiff class benefits the wider \ncommunity and serves the public interest. \n1.  The Balance of Harms and the Public Interest Favor Release of the \nVulnerable Detainees in Subclass A. \n \nThe members of Subclass A all have conditions that render them exceptionally vulnerable \nto death or serious harm if exposed to COVID-19. Because of their medical vulnerability, there is \nno practicable way to ensure that they receive reasonable medical treatment15 within the jail and, \ntherefore, their continued detention violates the Constitution and they must be released pursuant \nto a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. 2241.16  \n \n15 As explained above, Plaintiffs needs not show that Dart acted with deliberate indifference to their needs. \nBut regardless they easily could. There can be no dispute that Dart is aware that an uncontrolled outbreak is \nthreatening his jail and that people within it may die imminently as a result. Moreover, he has ignored his clear \nauthority under the Illinois County Jail Act to remove detainees whose physical health was in jeopardy to a suitable \nplace in his custody, including home confinement or electronic monitoring. See 730 ILCS § 125/14. \n16 Subclass A members bring this action under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 and Article I, Section Nine of the United \nStates Constitution. They, therefore, need not satisfy the heightened requirements of § 2254. Because they have not \nbeen convicted of a crime and are not in custody “pursuant to the judgment of a state court,” they may bring this \naction under § 2241 and need not bring this action under § 2254, which governs habeas petitions challenging state \ncriminal convictions. Stow v. Murashige, 389 F.3d 880, 886 (9th Cir. 2004) (“‘[T]he general grant of habeas \nauthority in § 2241 is available for challenges by a state prisoner who is not in custody pursuant to a state court \njudgment—for example, a defendant in pre-trial detention . . . .’” (quoting White v. Lambert, 370 F.3d 1002, 1006 \n(9th Cir. 2004)). Section 2254’s heightened standards of review, therefore, do not apply to this case. Id. at 888; \nPhillips v. Court of Common Pleas, Hamilton County, Ohio, 668 F.3d 804, 809 (6th Cir. 2012) (“We have long \nrecognized that pretrial detainees pursue habeas relief . . . under § 2241.”); Martinez v. Caldwell, 644 F.3d 238, 242 \n(5th Cir. 2011); Walck v. Edmondson, 472 F.3d 1227, 1234–35 (10th Cir. 2007); Gonzalez v. Justices of Mun. Ct. of \nBoston, 382 F.3d 1, 6–7 (1st Cir. 2004), judgment vacated on other grounds, 544 U.S. 918 (2005); Atkins v. \nMichigan, 644 F.2d 543, 546 & n.1 (6th Cir. 1981). \n13 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 2 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 16 of 21 PageID #:85\n \nSubclass A members face a heightened risk of contracting a deadly virus merely because \nthey are incarcerated, and additionally they face a heightened risk of dying if they do.  Older people \nand those with underlying medical conditions, such as lung disease, heart disease, or diabetes, are \nmore likely to develop serious illness.17 Class Action Complaint, ECF 1 ¶ 7; Puisis et al. ¶ 27. The \nnumber of cases and deaths from COVID-19 is increasing exponentially. This exponential growth \nis straining the health care system, which is struggling to care for the current and imminent influx \nof serious COVID-19 patients. An outbreak in the jail will spread rapidly and further strain health \ncare resources, resulting in a “catastrophic loss of life,”18 making it more likely that even people \nwho may have ordinarily recovered from the virus will die.19 \nAs a practical matter, there is no way to constitutionally confine Subclass A members in \nthe jail under present conditions. Puisis et al. ¶¶ 23-25. Although it is in theory possible for a jail \nto implement the social-distancing, sterilization, and other protective practices that the CDC \nrequires in a jail, because Subclass A members are so vulnerable to death and serious injury from \nthe disease, there is no time for those measures now. This reality is underscored by the declarations \non behalf of detainees filed in support of the Complaint. And regardless, as explained below and \nin the contemporaneously filed Complaint, Dart has woefully failed to implement those procedures \nto date. Subclass A members, then, are jailed in conditions that will inevitably threaten their lives \nat least in the near term. They must be removed from those conditions.  \nFor these reasons, in recent weeks courts across the country have granted emergency \n \n17 World Health Organization, Q&A on coronaviruses (COVID-19) (Mar. 9, 2020), \nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses.  \n18 Ex.

The Balance of Harms and the Public Interest Favor a Temporary \nRestraining Order Requiring the Jail to Implement Constitutionally \nSufficient Conditions \nThe Class seeks a temporary restraining order requiring the Jail to immediately comply \nwith the CDC Guidance for managing detention and correctional facilities.  In particular, the Jail \nmust immediately: \n•  Acquire rapid testing for COVID-19 in adequate supply to ensure that all who enter \n15 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 2 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 18 of 21 PageID #:87\n \nthe facility with the coronavirus can be quickly identified and medically isolated.   \n•  Quarantine all new detainees until test results become available or, if testing cannot \nbe done, for 14 days, unless they become symptomatic. \n•  Medically isolate all detainees who are positive for COVID-19 in a controlled, \nmonitored environment in which they are not at risk for infecting others. \n•  Quarantine all detainees who are symptomatic and/or have been exposed to a \nconfirmed  case  of  COVID-19  in  a  controlled  monitored  environment  for  the \nappropriate time period where they are not at risk for infecting others. \n•  Provide adequate medical staff to monitor all detainees within the Jail who are in \nmedical isolation or under quarantine. \n•  Provide sufficient soap and hand sanitizer to all detainees so that detainees may \nfrequently wash their hands. \n•  Provide masks to all detainees. \n•  Provide instruction to all staff and to all detainees regarding the importance of \nregularly sanitizing all surfaces and objects on which the virus could be present. \nProvide the soap and cleaning materials to enable this sanitizing, and supervise to \nensure that sanitizing takes place between all uses of such surfaces and objects. \n•   Mandate social distancing of detainees such that each is not at risk of exposure.  \nAll Class members are currently at imminent risk of death or serious injury from exposure \nto the coronavirus, and they are accordingly entitled to relief imminently. If this litigation is \ndecided in the ordinary course, many Class members may die before final judgment is entered, and \ncountless others will suffer severe pain or permanent lung damage. Class members are highly \nlikely to succeed on their claims because Dart, as his own staff members confirm, is knowingly \n16 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 2 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 19 of 21 PageID #:88\n \nexposing Plaintiffs to a severe risk of harm. See March 31, 2020 Letter from Marni Willenson, \nCaitlin Cervenka, Matthew J. Piers, Caryn Lederer, Cyrus Mehri, Ellen Eardley, and Michael D. \nLieder to Thomas J. Dart and Toni Preckwinkle (hereinafter “March Letter) (Attached as Exhibit \nC to the Complaint). \nThese steps are neither more nor less than what is required to mitigate the spread of \nCOVID-19 within the Jail.  Because the Jail is not an isolated environment—infections within the \nJail can and will spread beyond the Jail’s walls—implementing these steps is essential to mitigate \nthe spread of the coronavirus and serves the public interest.   \nThe monetary cost of implementing these necessary changes may be significant, but those \ncosts, whatever they might be, pale in comparison with the cost in human suffering and loss of life \nthat will surely occur if the changes are not made and made immediately. And the requested relief \npromotes the interests of the Sheriff’s office: his own employees are crying out for it as well. Id.   \n3.  The Balance of Harms and the Public Interest Favor a Temporary \nRestraining Order Requiring Transfer of Subclass B Members to a \nSafe Facility or Other Form of Confinement \nThe whole Class in this case requests a preliminary injunction requiring the implementation \nof reasonable sanitation procedures designed to keep them safe. But for people who are housed in \nan environment already exposed to COVID-19, those procedures will be insufficient. Once there \nis known exposure in a residential environment, it must be emptied and deep cleaned. Therefore, \nSubclass B members—who are housed in already exposed environments—must be transferred \nimmediately, either to their homes or to another, safe environment, and may not be returned to \ntheir current tiers until those tiers have been sanitized to prevent the spread of coronavirus. See, \ne.g., Plata v. Brown, No. 01-cv-1351, 2013 WL 3200587, at *8 (N.D. Cal. June 24, 2013) (granting \nmotion requiring transfer from area at high risk of coccidioidomycosis, known as “Valley Fever”).  \n17 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 2 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 20 of 21 PageID #:89\n \nCONCLUSION   \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should grant Subclass A’s petition for writs of habeas \ncorpus and should grant the Class’s and Subclass B’s requests for a temporary restraining order or \na preliminary injunction requiring the Jail to comply with the United States Constitution.  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nSIGNATURES \n/s/ Alexa Van Brunt \nCounsel for Plaintiffs \n \nAlexa Van Brunt \nRoderick and Solange MacArthur Justice Center \nNorthwestern Pritzker School of Law \n375 E.

In support of their request, Plaintiffs state as follows: \n1.  Plaintiffs have filed a class action lawsuit seeking injunctive relief for protection \nagainst the imminent risk of harm or death from COVID-19 at the Cook County Jail. Plaintiffs \nalso have filed an Emergency Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order or Preliminary \nInjunction. \n2.  After Plaintiffs filed their Complaint and emergency motion, the Court entered an \nOrder asking Plaintiffs to “provide their position regarding the applicability and effect of 18 \nU.S.C. § 3626 to their lawsuit and, in particular, to the relief they are requesting in the TRO/PI \nmotion.” Dkt. 10. That brief is due today at 12 noon and is attached to this motion. Id. \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 2 of 4 PageID #:168\n3.  In order to provide the Court with a detailed discussion of the applicability of \nSection 3626 that Plaintiffs believe is appropriate, Plaintiffs require approximately 10 pages \nmore than the default limit set out in Local Rule 7.1. \n4.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court grant them leave to file \nan oversized brief of 26 pages to respond fully to the Court’s April 3, 2020 Order. Granting \nPlaintiffs leave in this case is appropriate given the importance of the issues at stake in the \nlitigation, as well as the arguments Plaintiffs anticipate the Defendant will raise in response. \n5.  Plaintiffs will have no objection to any corresponding request by the Defendant \nfor leave to file an oversized brief in response later today. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court grant their motion and give \nthem leave to file a 26-page response to the Court’s April 3, 2020 Order regarding the \napplicability of 18 U.S.C. § 3626 to their claims.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 3 of 4 PageID #:169\n  Respectfully submitted, \n \n  /s/ Sarah Grady       \n  Sarah Grady \n  Attorney for Plaintiffs \n \nStephen Weil \nSarah Grady \nLoevy & Loevy \n311 North Aberdeen St., 3rd Fl. \nChicago, IL 60607 \n(312) 243-5900 \n \nLocke E.

In the two weeks since it was first detected, 1 out of every 20 \ndetainees at the Jail has become infected.3  It is unclear how many have been tested or how many \ntests are outstanding.  \nPlaintiffs have filed a Complaint seeking an emergency writ of habeas corpus for \ndetainees who are especially vulnerable to a grave risk of serious illness and death because of \ntheir age or medical condition. They also seek injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to bring \nthe conditions at the Jail into compliance with the Constitution, and to transfer those detainees at \nthe Jail who have been exposed to the virus to a form of custody that is safe. In their motion for a \ntemporary restraining order or preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs request three categories of relief: \n(1) for Subclass A, they seek immediate release through a writ of habeas corpus; (2) for Subclass \nB, they seek transfer to a safe environment; and (3) for the entire Class, they seek an Order \nrequiring the Jail to adhere to CDC guidelines and take other actions required by medical \n                                                \n1 “Coronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case Count,” N.Y. Times (last updated Apr. 5, 2020), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html (“Though many of the first \ncoronavirus cases in the United States were tied to overseas travel, localized outbreaks have become \nincreasingly common.” Cook County Jail is the top locale for this type of outbreak). \n \n2 COVID-19 Cases at CCDOC (last updated Apr. 5, 2020), \nhttps://www.cookcountysheriff.org/covid-19-cases-at-ccdoc/. \n \n3 See infra pg. 12. \n  1 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-1 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 8 of 33 PageID #:178\nconsensus to bring the conditions of confinement at the Jail into constitutional compliance. Dkt. \n2 at 11.  \nPlaintiffs submit this brief in response to the Court’s request to “provide their position \nregarding the applicability and effect of 18 U.S.C. § 3626 to their lawsuit and, in particular, to \nthe relief they are requesting in the TRO/PI motion.” Dkt. 10. In summary: (1) Plaintiffs’ first \nrequest, for habeas relief, is not governed by 18 U.S.C. § 3626. Moran v. Sondalle, 218 F.3d 647, \n651 (7th Cir. 2000) (per curiam). (2) Plaintiffs’ claims for emergency injunctive relief under \nSection 1983 comply with 18 U.S.C. § 3626 because they seek narrowly drawn injunctive relief \nthat extends no further than what is required to ensure class members are held in constitutionally \ncompliant conditions. (3) Neither of the requests for injunctive relief under Section 1983 \nconstitutes a prisoner release order, 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3), and thus the requirements of Section \n3626(a)(3) do not apply to Plaintiffs’ current requests. (4) Given the imminent threat that an \nuncontrolled outbreak at the Jail imposes on class members and to the general public, however, \nPlaintiffs believe that a three-judge panel should be convened in the event that immediate \ncompliance with the Constitution is not achieved.  The unprecedented global pandemic—an \ninfectious disease spreading inside the Cook County Jail at a rate fifty times that of the general \nU.S. population—requires unique and prompt action by this Court to ensure that this Court is in a \nposition to save as many lives as possible. \nDISCUSSION \nI.  The Relevant Provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 3626. \n \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) applies to “any civil action with respect to \nprison conditions,” 18 U.S.C. § 3626, but not to petitions for habeas corpus. Moran, 218 F.3d at \n651. Requests for relief under Section 3626 are governed by Subsection (a) of that statute, which \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-1 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 9 of 33 PageID #:179\ncontains three core provisions: Subsection (1) governs all prospective relief, Subsection (2) \ngoverns preliminary injunctions and temporary restraining orders, and Subsection (3) governs \n“prisoner release order[s].” \nSubsection (1) requires that “[p]rospective relief in any civil action with respect to prison \nconditions shall extend no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a \nparticular plaintiff or plaintiffs,” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A), and instructs courts to “give \nsubstantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice \nsystem caused by the relief” when considering whether “such relief is narrowly drawn, extends \nno further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive \nmeans necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.” Id. Further, the statute requires that \ncourts not order a state official to exceed their authority under state law unless doing so is \nrequired by federal law to protect a federal right and no other relief will do. Id. § 3626(a)(1)(B). \nCourts refer to these requirements as the “needs-narrowness-intrusiveness” criteria. E.g., Fields \nv. Smith, 653 F.3d 550, 558 (7th Cir. 2011).  \nSubsection (2) applies the narrow-tailoring requirements of Subsection (1) to requests for \npreliminary injunctive relief, and further requires that all such relief “automatically expire on the \ndate that is 90 days after its entry, unless the court makes the findings required under subsection \n(a)(1) [that the relief be narrowly tailored and minimally intrusive] . . . and makes the order final \nbefore the expiration of the 90-day period.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2). \nFinally, Subsection (3) governs “prisoner release order[s].” Id. § 3626(a)(3). A “prisoner \nrelease order” is defined as “any order, including a temporary restraining order or preliminary \ninjunctive relief, that has the purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison population, or \nthat directs the release from or nonadmission of prisoners to a prison.” Id. § 3626(g)(4). \n  3 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-1 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 10 of 33 PageID #:180\nSubsection (3) imposes substantive and procedural requirements on prisoner-release orders. \nProcedurally, a prisoner-release order may issue only by order of a three-judge district court, and \nonly after “a court has previously entered an order for less intrusive relief that has failed to \nremedy the deprivation of the Federal right sought to be remedied through the prisoner release \norder[,] and the defendant has had a reasonable amount of time to comply with the previous \ncourt orders.” Id. at (3)(A) (numerals omitted). Substantively, “[t]he three-judge court shall enter \na prisoner release order only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that crowding is \nthe primary cause of the violation of a Federal right[] and no other relief will remedy the \nviolation of the Federal right.” Id. at (3)(E).   \nII.  The PLRA Does Not Apply to Subclass A’s Request for a Writ of Habeas Corpus. \n \nThe PLRA does not apply to habeas corpus actions.  Walker v. O'Brien, 216 F.3d 626, \n634 (7th Cir. 2000) (“[W]e conclude that cases properly brought under §§ 2241 or 2254 as \nhabeas corpus petitions are not subject to the PLRA. In so doing, we bring this circuit into line \nwith all of our sister circuits who have ruled on the matter.” (citing Davis v. Fechtel, 150 F.3d \n486, 488–90 (5th Cir.1998); McIntosh v. United States Parole Commission, 115 F.3d 809, 811–\n12 (10th Cir.1997); Blair–Bey v. Quick, 151 F.3d 1036, 1039–41 (D.C.Cir.1998)); see also, \nGreyer v. Illinois Dep't of Corr., 933 F.3d 871, 878 (7th Cir. 2019) (observing that “habeas \ncorpus petitions do not give rise to a strike under the PLRA.”).  Recent district court orders \ngranting petitions for habeas corpus relief in light of COVID-19 have not applied the PLRA to \nthose actions.  See, e.g., Basank v. Decker, ___ F. Supp. 3d ____, 2020 WL 1481503, at *7 \n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2020) (granting petitioner’s Section 2241 request for a TRO, releasing them \n  4 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-1 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 11 of 33 PageID #:181\nfrom immigration detention because of COVID-19); Thakker v.

Plaintiffs’ Request for a Preliminary Injunction to Remedy Unconstitutional \nConditions of Confinement at the Jail Satisfy Section 3626(a)(2) and Are Necessary, \nAlthough Potentially Insufficient, To Protect the Class. \n   \nA.  Plaintiff’s Proposed Injunctive Relief Regarding Conditions at the Jail \nSatisfies Section 3626(a)(2). \n  \n        The relief Plaintiffs seek on behalf of the entire Class is, simply, constitutionally compliant \nJail conditions so that everyone in the Class is protected from the rampant transmission of a \nvirulent and lethal disease. As set forth in Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order or \npreliminary injunction, the Sheriff must comply with the CDC Guidance for Managing Detention \nand Correctional Facilities, including specific requirements for quarantine, medical isolation, \naccess to trained medical staff to monitor and provide adequate care, sufficient soap, sanitizer \nand cleaning supplies, and—importantly—effective social distancing to the maximum possible \nextent for all staff and detainees. Pls.’ Prelim. Inj. Mot., Dkt. 2, at 15-16. These mandates also \necho the expert recommendations of the medical declarants who have extensive experience with \nCook County and Illinois correctional medical care, including former medical directors of the \nCook County Jail. See Complaint, Ex. B, Dkt. 1-2. \nIn particular, in their motion for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction, \nPlaintiffs seek an Order from this Court requiring the Jail to immediately take the following \nactions: \n                                                \n4 There are, of course, questions as to what process would be appropriate to enable the Court to \nevaluate the claims of the members of Subclass A for a temporary restraining order granting habeas relief.  \nShould the court desire briefing on those questions, Plaintiff is prepared to submit a memorandum on an \nexpedited schedule.  \n  5 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-1 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 12 of 33 PageID #:182\n  Acquire rapid testing for COVID-19 in adequate supply to ensure that all \nwho enter the facility with the coronavirus can be quickly identified and \nmedically isolated; \n \n  Quarantine all new detainees until test results become available or, if \ntesting cannot be done, for 14 days, unless they become symptomatic; \n \n  Medically isolate all detainees who are positive for COVID-19 in a \ncontrolled, monitored environment in which they are not at risk for \ninfecting others; \n \n  Quarantine all detainees who are symptomatic and/or have been exposed \nto a confirmed case of COVID-19 in a controlled, monitored environment \nfor the appropriate time period where they are not at risk for infecting \nothers; \n \n  Provide adequate medical staff to monitor all detainees within the Jail who \nare in medical isolation or under quarantine;  \n \n  Provide sufficient soap and hand sanitizer to all detainees so that detainees \nmay frequently wash their hands; \n \n  Provide masks to all detainees; \n \n  Provide instruction to all staff and to all detainees regarding the \nimportance of regularly sanitizing all surfaces and objects on which the \nvirus could be present; \n \n  Provide the soap and cleaning materials to enable this sanitizing, and \nsupervise to ensure that sanitizing takes place between all uses of such \nsurfaces and objects; and \n \n  Mandate social distancing of detainees such that each is not at risk of \nexposure. \n \nDkt. 2 at 17-18. These steps are necessary to protect detainees at the Jail from further \nuncontrolled spread of COVID-19. They accordingly satisfy the criteria of section 3626(a)(2). \n  6 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-1 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 13 of 33 PageID #:183\n  Section 3626(a)(2) permits a court to order injunctive relief if it finds that the relief, taken \nas a whole, is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the constitutional \nviolation, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the constitutional violation. 18 \nU.S.C. § 3626(a); see also Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1070 (9th Cir. 2010) \n(rejecting argument that PLRA requires provision-by-provision explanation of district court’s \nfindings; court must make findings considering its “order as a whole”); see also Fields, 653 F.3d \nat 558 (finding that district court properly complied with PLRA because court “evaluated the \nrecord as a whole and identified evidence that fully support[ed] the scope of the injunctive \nrelief” (emphasis added)). The application of this requirement is case-specific, and “must be \nundertaken in light of both the magnitude of existing constitutional violations and the available \nalternative remedies.” Morales Feliciano v. Rullan, 378 F.3d 42, 54 (1st Cir. 2004). \nIn Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493 (2011), the Supreme Court explained that the narrow \ntailoring required by Section 3626(a) simply mandates “a fit between the [remedy’s] ends and \nthe means chosen to accomplish those ends.” Id. at 531 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nAlthough the injunctive relief must not “reach out to improve prison conditions other than those \nthat violate the Constitution[,]” narrow tailoring does not “suggest that a narrow and otherwise \nproper remedy for a constitutional violation is invalid simply because it will have collateral \neffects.” Id. Where the constitutional violation at issue is systemwide, systemwide relief is the \nappropriate, tailored remedy.  See, e.g., Benjamin v. Fraser, 156 F. Supp. 2d 333, 345-55 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2001) (finding that systemwide injunctive relief satisfied the criteria of Section \n3626(a) in class action litigation over the conditions of confinement for jail detainees), aff’d, in \npart, at 343 F.3d 35, 53-54 (2nd Cir. 2003), overruled on other grounds in Caiozzo v. Koreman, \n  7 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-1 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 14 of 33 PageID #:184\n581 F.3d 63 (2d. Cir. 2009); Braggs v. Dunn, 383 F. Supp. 3d 1218, 1265-1278 (M.D. Ala. May \n4, 2019) (same). Indeed as the Second Circuit explained in Benjamin, affirming a district court’s \nsystemwide injunction order pertaining to prison ventilation, a systemwide injunctive order was \nin fact “more effective and less intrusive than an individual review of each window at the various \nfacilities.” 343 F.3d at 53. \n          As set forth in the Complaint, the current conditions at the Jail pose a substantial and \nimminent risk of serious harm to detainees housed there. See Hardeman v. Curran, 933 F.3d 816, \n823 (7th Cir. 2019).  The Complaint sets out evidence that, throughout the Jail, shared communal \nareas continue to be in use.  That includes intake “bull pens” and dormitories for incoming \ndetainees, and the housing of detainees in dormitories and other congregate settings in the Jail.  \nSee Dkt. 1 ¶ 40.  The Complaint also explains that guards have not consistently worn personal \nprotective equipment (PPE), and that detainees have been given none.  Id. ¶ 41. The Complaint \ndetails that detainees have had inconsistent or limited access to soap and hand sanitizer, id., and \nthat detainees do not have access to clearing supplies.  Id.  And it sets out that detainees and staff \nthroughout the Jail touch and share objects throughout the day—from door handles to phones to \ntoilets to tables to lunch trays—that are not cleaned frequently enough to stop the spread of a \nvirus that can live on such surfaces for days.  Id. ¶¶ 11, 21, 35, 48.    \nThe requested remedial measures are immediately needed to protect the health and safety \nof detainees at the Jail, and they are designed to address these failures. The injunctive relief \nsought by Plaintiffs is supported by the CDC’s guidance on managing COVID-19 in jails, as well \nas evidence from doctors with experience with the Cook County correctional medical system, \nincluding Dr. Puisis, who was the Medical Director of the Cook County Jail from 1991 to 1996 \n  8 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-1 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 15 of 33 PageID #:185\nand Chief Operating Officer for the medical program at the Cook County Jail from 2009 to 2012. \nDkt. 1-2; see also Benjamin, 156 F. Supp. 2d at 345-55 (relying on expert testimony in finding \nthat systemwide injunctive relief satisfied the needs-narrowness-intrusiveness criteria); Braggs v. \nDunn, 383 F. Supp. 3d 1218, 1265-1278 (M.D. Ala. May 4, 2019) (same).  \nThe requested relief protects not only the class members, but the safety of the public at \nlarge, a consideration encompassed within both subsections (a)(1)(A) and (a)(2) (“The court \nshall give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal \njustice system . . . .”). The Jail is not a closed environment. The measures put in place to protect \nthe Plaintiffs and class members will simultaneously impact the health and well-being of the \ncommunity at large. The Complaint explains: \nBy necessity, members of the free community, including correctional officers, \nsocial workers, attorneys, medical personnel, and many others must enter and \nleave jails on a daily basis. Staff arrive and leave each facility three times a day in \nlarge numbers, and there is no current, in-place ability to adequately screen staff \nfor new, asymptomatic infection. In addition, new detainees are admitted into jails \nevery day, many of whom may be asymptomatic and thus not flagged for \nquarantine, even with robust intake screening procedures. When the COVID-19 \nvirus occurs and spreads within a jail, all persons, staff and prisoners alike, are at \nheightened risk of contracting the virus and, in turn, spreading the virus to others \nwith whom they come in contact in their own homes and neighborhoods. \n \nComplaint, Dkt. 1, at ¶ 25.  \nAs the Governor’s March 20, 2020 Executive Order makes clear, public safety is served \nby the emergency relief requested.5 The implementation of the CDC Guidance measures and \n                                                \n5 Executive Order in Response to COVID-19 (COVID Executive Order No. 8) (Mar. 20, 2020) (Executive \nOrder), pg. 1-5, available at https://www2.illinois.gov/Documents/ExecOrders/2020/ExecutiveOrder-2020-10.pdf \n(last visited Apr. 6, 2020); see also “Read Pritzker’s Full Statement Announcing Illinois Stay-at-Home Order \nExtension,” NBC5 (Mar. 31, 2020), https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/read-pritzkers-full-statement-\nannouncing-illinois-stay-at-home-order-extension/2247976/ (last visited Apr. 4, 2020). \n  9 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-1 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 16 of 33 PageID #:186\nmedical experts’ recommendations will prevent prisoners from spreading COVID-19 to one \nanother, then transmitting it to correctional staff, who may spread it to their families and their \ncommunities. Cf. United States v. Alabama, 2015 WL 3796526, at *4 (M.D. Ala. June 18, 2015) \n(approving a settlement that “will promote public safety by not only protecting the prisoners at \nTutwiler [Prison for Women] from sexual abuse and harassment, it will also protect the prison \nguards”); Duvall v. O’Malley, 2016 WL 3523682, *11 (D. Md., June 28, 2016) (approving a \nconsent judgment addressing medical and mental health care and living conditions, and holding \nthat “the facilities will be safer and more orderly when this relief is fully implemented”).  \nThe evidence provided by Plaintiffs in their Complaint and motion for a temporary \nrestraining order amply supports the findings required by Section 3626(a)(2): Experts and \ngovernment agencies alike describe the measures for which Plaintiffs seek an injunction as \nnecessary to protect against the spread of a deadly virus.  \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Proposed Injunctive Relief May Not Be Sufficient. \n \nIf the Court issues injunctive relief under Section 3626(a)(2), Plaintiffs respectfully \nsubmit that within 24 hours thereafter the Court should decide—either sua sponte pursuant to \nSection 3626(a)(3)(D), or pursuant to a submission by Plaintiffs under Section 3626(a)(3)(C)—\nwhether to request the convening of a three-judge court to determine whether a prisoner release \norder should be issued.  A timeline this short is extraordinary.  But it is called for by the \nextraordinary circumstances unlike any living person has ever seen, in which a deadly virus has \nshut down life as we know it around the world and in which crowded U.S. jails and prisons are, \n  10 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-1 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 17 of 33 PageID #:187\nwithout intervention, about to become sites of mass sickness and death.6 Section 3626 \ncontemplates precisely such a remedy in circumstances like this.   \nSection (a)(3) provides that a three-judge panel may consider the appropriateness of a \nprisoner-release order if, one, the Court has entered an order under Section (a)(2) “to remedy the \ndeprivation of the Federal right sought to be remedied through the prisoner release order,” and \ntwo, the Sheriff “has had a reasonable time to comply” with the Section (a)(2) order.  18 U.S.C. \n§§ 3626(a)(3)(A)(i)-(ii).  Plaintiffs seek relief under Section (a)(2) to protect them, and the class \nthey seek to represent, from being incarcerated in a jail where the conditions of confinement \nhave incubated and accelerated the transmission of a fast-moving, lethal virus that threatens to \nmake them seriously ill, damage their internal organs (possibly permanently), or kill them, in a \nmatter of days.  Being imprisoned in such circumstances violates Plaintiffs’ rights, as set forth in \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction. Dkt. 2 at 13-14. \nIn public statements the Sheriff’s office has repeatedly assured members of the public \nthat it has taken extraordinary steps to protect the jail population from the pandemic.  The Sheriff \ncontends that he has made available increased cleaning supplies and personal protective \n                                                \n6 For example, five prisoners have already died in a federal prison in Oakdale, Louisiana.

Even if the \nSheriff’s media statements are accurate, the official Cook County Department of Corrections \n(CCDOC) measures are woefully insufficient. Cook County is the host county for the Jail and \nvirtually all its detainees and all of its employees hail from the County.

That is 32 times the rate in Cook County.12 The first detainee tested positive for COVID-\n19 two weeks ago; now 1 in 20 detainees at the Jail are infected. Seventy-eight staff members are \ninfected as well.13 The Jail, in other words, is a dramatic accelerator of COVID-19, the Sheriff’s \nefforts notwithstanding. As of today, the Jail is the largest known cluster of COVID-19 \ninfections in the United States.14  \nThere are three probable reasons for this, all of which are detailed in the Complaint.  \nFirst, the reports from jail detainees and employees indicate that many of the Sheriff’s \naggressive protocols for cleaning, distribution of soap, and provision of PPE have not been \nimplemented. The Sheriff’s office has had a month to change its hygiene protocols to combat \n                                                \n11 County infection figures: State of Illinois, Coronavirus (COVID-19) Response, \nhttps://coronavirus.illinois.gov/s/ (last visited Apr. 6, 2020).

See Cook County Board—Current Budget \nInformation, https://www.cookcountyil.gov/Budget. Plaintiffs do not include jail staff in the Jail’s \ninfection rate because it is unclear how many staff work within the Jail.  Additionally Jail staff work at, \nand are thus exposed to, the Jail only on certain days and for certain times of the day.  Indeed news \nreports suggest that staff have drastically reduced the time they spend at the jail in order to protect \nthemselves, making their high infection rate all the more troubling. See Tyler Kendall, \"We're at war with \nno weapons\": Coronavirus cases surge inside Chicago's Cook County Jail,” CBSNews (Apr. 5, 2020), \nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/chicago-cook-county-jail-coronavirus-life-inside-covid-19-cases/ (last \nvisited Apr. 6, 2020) (reporting that Jail “employees, who interact closely with inmates on a daily basis, \nare now going in once a week and working from home the other four.”). \n \n14 See Supra, pg. 1 n.1. \n  13 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-1 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 20 of 33 PageID #:190\nCOVID-19.  The employee and detainee reports indicate that it is incapable of actually \nimplementing such changes in such a short time. \nSecond, there are evidently too many detainees in the jail to implement the social \ndistancing and quarantining necessary to slow the spread of COVID-19. Social distancing is the \nsine qua non for stopping COVID-19’s spread.15  The Court need look no further than our \ncollective experience: in the last few weeks, to achieve social distancing governments around the \nworld have plunged national economies into likely economic depressions. Were other, less \ndraconian measures capable of meaningfully slowing COVID-19’s spread, there is no question \nthat social distancing would never have been ordered. \nAnd as Dr. Puisis and his colleagues explain, however, social distancing is effectively \nimpossible in correctional settings, for the simple reason that jails and prisons were designed as \ncongregate security environments where social isolation is impossible.  Puisis et al., Dkt. 1-2 ¶¶ \n23-24. \nThird, as Dr. Puisis et al. point out, quarantine can also rapidly become impossible in \nsuch a setting: \nInmates are still being admitted into Cook County Jail.  New inmates are being \nquarantined.  Known or suspicious cases of COVID-19 require isolation from \nothers.  However, the housing units are not set up for mass quarantine or isolation.  \nThe jail was built with security in mind not medical isolation or quarantine.  For \npurposes of quarantine, the jail is cohorting groups of incoming inmates into tiers \nfor a period of time.  Because inmates continue to be incarcerated in the Jail, \ninvariably, this will result in a significant portion of the jail dedicated to \nquarantine.   It is recommended that quarantine continue for 14 days.  If any \nindividual in the cohort becomes COVID-19 positive, the entire group is again \nquarantined again for another 14 days.

Eventually, capacity to manage medically those who are in \nquarantine will overwhelm Jail staff.  Some of the detainee declarations attached to Plaintiffs’ \ncomplaint suggest that this may already be happening.   \nThe exceptional and horrific rate of infection in the Jail and the systemic problems \nidentified in the Complaint—notwithstanding the Sheriff’s insistence that everything possible is \nbeing done—suggest a stark reality.  Even after the Court would order the Sheriff to comply with \nCDC Guidance, as Plaintiffs request the Court to do, it will become readily apparent (to the \nextent it is not already) that those measures alone will be insufficient to protect the class and \nparticularly the members of Subclass A from the unacceptable risk of infection and possible \ndeath. Therefore, in the interest of saving lives in this unprecedented health emergency the Court \nshould begin the process of setting up the three-judge panel that Section 3626(a)(3) requires to \naddress the release of some members of the Class, including but not limited to those detainees \nmost vulnerable to the disease. \nSection 3626(a)(3)(A)(ii) provides that a release order may not be entered until the \ndefendant has had “a reasonable amount of time to comply with” the Court’s Section 3626(a)(2) \norder.  “Reasonable” does not mean moderate or slow—it is a flexible standard designed to \nmatch the exigencies of the moment.  Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452, 462 (2011) \n(reasonableness requirement under the Fourth Amendment depends on the circumstances); Tyler \n  15 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-1 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 22 of 33 PageID #:192\nv. Anderson, 749 F.3d 499, 510 (6th Cir. 2014) (“reasonable time” as used in Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 60(b) “depends on the factual circumstances of each case”). Cf. Black’s Law \nDictionary, “Reasonable Time,” (11th ed. 2019) (“The time needed to do what a contract \nrequires to be done, based on subjective circumstances”). \nIndeed, the courts have already recognized that Section 3626(a)(3)(A)(ii)’s “reasonable \namount of time” provision meets the exigencies of the COVID-19 epidemic.  On April 4, the \nthree-judge court in Plata v. Newsom, No. 90 C 0520, Dkt. 3261 (N.D. Cal. April 4, 2020) \n(attached as Ex. H), which had been impaneled years ago pursuant to an existing release order, \nheld that Plaintiffs had not satisfied Section 3626(a)(3) because the three-judge court had been \nimpaneled for purposes of granting different relief, and thus there had not been the requisite \nSection 3626(a)(2) order for which defendants had been given a “reasonable amount of time to \ncomply.”  In its holding, however, the three-judge court made a point to emphasize that “[w]e \nrecognize that what is reasonable in ordinary times may be quite different from what is \nreasonable in these extraordinary times.”  Id. at 7 n.9.  In his concurrence, Chief Judge Mueller \nemphasized that, while Section (a)(2) had to be complied with first, under the circumstances of \nthe COVID-19 epidemic, the Section (a)(3) release order could still be achieved quickly: “Given \nthe availability of expedited proceedings before those district courts to immediately exhaust the \npossibility of inmate transfers and relocations to secure facilities to achieve constitutionally \nacceptable conditions for the Plaintiff classes, those proceedings must be invoked first.  Id. at 15 \n(Mueller, J., concurring) (emphasis added).16 \n                                                \n16 If this Court determines that “reasonable time” as used in the PLRA contemplates some fixed, \nlonger period, Plaintiffs respectfully submit that the provision would be unconstitutional as applied. Such \nan interpretation would unlawfully prevent the application of judicial equitable authority to save people’s \nlives in the face of an unprecedented pandemic, cf. Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993); Estelle \nv. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103-04 (1976), and must be avoided. See Jones v. United States, 529 U.S. 848, \n857 (2000) (quoting United States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U.S. 366 \n  16 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-1 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 23 of 33 PageID #:193\nPlaintiffs have every reason to believe that the efficacy of any Section (a)(2) order will be \nquickly exhausted.  The Sheriff’s office claims it has already acted with alacrity to stop the virus.  \nYet COVID-19 is exploding within the jail, and it is growing by the hour.  By all appearances, \nthe Sheriff’s office simply does not have the wherewithal to stop the spread of that virus within \nthe Jail’s four walls, despite its efforts.  Plaintiffs therefore respectfully suggest that 24 hours is a \nreasonable amount of time to comply with any Section (a)(2) order, and that thereafter the \nremedy of removal will likely be required. \nIV.  Subclass B Seeks Transfer Within the Jurisdiction of the Sheriff in Response to a \nGrowing Pandemic Inside the Jail, Relief That Satisfies the Need-Narrowness-\nIntrusiveness Criteria and Is Not a Prisoner-Release Order. \n \nTo remedy the spread of the disease, to which members of Subclass B members have \nalready been exposed, the members of that subclass must be transferred to a safe facility or \nlocation within the Sheriff’s jurisdiction and control. That relief could include transfer to home \nconfinement or electronic home monitoring (“EHM”), which are programs under the Sheriff’s \ncontrol and supervision, or to any other safe condition of confinement.17   \n \n                                                \n(1909)) (“where a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful \nconstitutional questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided, our duty is to adopt \nthe latter.”); Gilmore v. California, 220 F.3d 987, 998 (9th Cir. 2000) (9th Cir. 2000) (“The courts will \ntherefore not lightly assume that Congress intended to infringe constitutionally protected liberties or usurp \npower constitutionally forbidden it.”) (citing DeBartolo Corp v.

Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U.S. 490, \n500 (1979) (“[A]n Act of Congress ought not be construed to violate the Constitution if any other possible \nconstruction remains available.”). \n \n17 Subclass B Plaintiffs do not seek release from CCDOC custody, and thus this request does not \nimplicate the mandates of Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475 (1973). Cf. Glaus v. Anderson, 408 F.3d \n382, 386 (7th Cir. 2005) (“In Preiser v. Rodriguez, the Supreme Court held that the writ of habeas corpus \nwas the exclusive civil remedy for prisoners seeking release from custody.”). \n \n  17 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-1 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 24 of 33 PageID #:194\nA.  Plaintiffs’ Requested Transfer Is Within the Court’s Equitable Authority \nand Does Not Require the Sheriff to Exceed His Statutorily Prescribed \nAuthority. \n \nNothing in the PLRA displaces district courts’ “broad equitable powers to order the \ntransfer of inmates to facilities better equipped to provide for their medical needs.” Reaves v. \nDep’t of Correction, 392 F.Supp.3d 195, 209-10 (D. Mass. 2019) (stay pending appeal denied, \n404 F. Supp. 3d 520) (citing Johnson v. Harris, 479 F. Supp. 333 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) (ordering \nprison to either transfer inmate to facility equipped to provide for his medical needs or to insure \nhe is provided with adequate care stemming from prison’s deliberate indifference to inmate’s \nserious medical needs); United States v. Wallen, 177 F. Supp. 2d 455, 458 (D. Md. 2001) \n(ordering transfer of pretrial detainee to a hospital since “the Marshal’s Service cannot assure \nthis Court that it will provide the medical care that the Constitution mandates so long as he is \nheld at MCAC”).18 This court, accordingly, may—and indeed must—order the transfer of \nprisoners from a facility infected with COVID-19 to another location within the Sheriff’s control \n(where they will remain in the Sheriff’s custody) to ensure that they receive constitutionally \nadequate medical care and are protected from physical harm. Cf. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. \n825, 847 (1994) (prison official can be liable “for denying humane conditions of confinement” \nwhere “he knows inmates face a substantial risk of serious harm and disregards that risk by \nfailing to take reasonable measures to abate it.”); Petties v. Carter, 836 F.3d 722, 729 (7th Cir. \n2016) (“If a risk from a particular course of medical treatment (or lack thereof) is obvious \n                                                \n18 See also, e.g., ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, 23-6.2 (3d ed. 2011) (“A prisoner who \nrequires care not available in the correctional facility should be transferred to a hospital or other \nappropriate place for care.”); cf. Murphy v. Lane, 833 F.2d 106 (7th Cir. 1987) (court could consider \nplaintiff’s civil rights claim for retaliatory transfer stemming from prison officials’ transfer of plaintiffs to \ndifferent prison less well-equipped to handle his psychiatric needs). \n  18 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-1 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 25 of 33 PageID #:195\nenough, a factfinder can infer that a prison official knew about it and disregarded it.”) (citations \nomitted) (emphasis added). \nAnd transfers of detainees are in fact directly contemplated by the Sheriff’s state law \nauthority under the County Jail Act, 730 ILCS 125/14, which states: \nAt any time, in the opinion of the Warden, the lives or health of the prisoners are \nendangered or the security of the penal institution is threatened, to such a degree \nas to render their removal necessary, the Warden may cause an individual \nprisoner or a group of prisoners to be removed to some suitable place within the \ncounty, or to the jail of some convenient county, where they may be confined \nuntil they can be safely returned to the place whence they were removed. \n \nUnder the County Jail Act, transfer within the county includes to Electronic Home \nMonitoring (EHM), a program that is administered by the Sheriff. As the Sheriff emphasized in \nseparate litigation concerning EHM, a case that was recently heard in the Seventh Circuit, it is \nsolely within his Office’s discretion whether to place pre-trial individuals in his custody on \nElectronic Monitoring: “Whether a given pretrial defendant is placed in the Sheriff’s EHM \nProgram as a condition of bond is a discretionary decision of the Sheriff’s custody of prisoners \non electronic monitoring.” Br. of Defendant Appellees at 8 (attached as Ex. A), Williams v. Dart, \nCase No. 19-02108 (7th Cir.); see also id. at 7-8 (“The Sheriff’s pretrial EHM Program is not a \ncreature of statute—it is his own. Sheriff Dart has discretion to set parameters or guidelines for \nadmission into his program. Whether a given pretrial defendant is placed in the Sheriff’s EHM \nProgram as a condition of bond is a discretionary decision of the Sheriff’s.”).  \nAnyone transferred to the Sheriff’s EHM program as part of the requested relief \nrequested by Subclass B would be subject not only to the conditions of that program as \nadministered by the Sheriff, but by the strict conditions imposed by the Governor’s emergency \norder, which prohibits non-essential travel and engaging in non-essential business, and mandates \n  19 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-1 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 26 of 33 PageID #:196\neveryone in the state to stay at their home or place of residence except when engaging in \nessential activities.19  \nB.  The Requested Relief is Not a Prisoner Release Order. \n \nAn order mandating the removal of Subclass B prisoners from the Jail to another location \nin the Sheriff’s custody, including but not limited to EHM, does not constitute a “prisoner-\nrelease order” as envisioned by 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3), and thus does not mandate the \nimpaneling of a three-judge panel, for two reasons. \nFirst, the relief does not constitute a prisoner-release order because it does not concern \nprison crowding, which is what the relevant provision of the PLRA was enacted to address. For \nmore than two decades, district courts have found that Section 3626(a)(3) does not apply to \norders remedying violations of federal rights other than overcrowding. In Doe v. Younger, No. \n91-187 (E.D. Ky. Sept. 4, 1996), Op. and Order (attached as Ex. B) at 10-12, the district court \nbanned the housing of juveniles for more than 15 days in jail, where conditions were \nunacceptable for children. The court held that this was not a prisoner release order requiring a \nthree-judge court under the PLRA, even where it had the effect of reducing the number of \nchildren in the facility: “[T]he court’s order does not direct the release of any child. It is \nundisputed that counties . . . often house juveniles in need of a secure facility in other counties. \nIn fact, such transfers from facilities in one county to facilities in another county or even another \nstate are extremely common. Indeed, the Kentucky Juvenile Code specifically contemplates such \ntransfers.” \n                                                \n19  See supra, Executive Order n.5. The applicability of the stay-at-home order to any class \nmembers transferred within the Sheriff’s jurisdiction is also relevant to the PLRA’s “needs-narrowness-\nintrusiveness” analysis, discussed in Part C, infra. \n \n  20 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-1 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 27 of 33 PageID #:197\nIn Plata v. Brown, No. C01-1351-TEH, 2013 WL 3200587, at *8-10 (N.D. Cal. June 24, \n2013), the court was faced with the sweeping transmission of coccidioidomycosis, or Valley \nFever, “an infectious disease caused by inhalation of a fungus,” in certain prisons within the \nCalifornia state prison system.  Id. at *2. The court granted an exclusionary order for medically \nvulnerable prisoners, rejecting the defendants’ argument that the PLRA barred the requested \nrelief unless issued by a three-judge court: \nHere, looking at the [PLRA] statute as a whole requires reading the definition of \n“prisoner release order” in conjunction with the requirements for entering one. \nOne such requirement is that a three judge court must determine, by clear and \nconvincing evidence, that “crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a \nFederal right,” before it can enter a prisoner release order. 18 U.S.C. \n§ 3626(a)(3)(E)(i). Consequently, adopting Defendants’ interpretation of \n“prisoner release order” would mean that a court could only order that prisoners \nbe transferred from one prison to another if overcrowding were the primary cause \nof the violation of those prisoners’ rights, and not if any other reason were \ncausing the violation. Defendants have failed to point to anything in the \nlegislative history that indicates an intent to limit the protection of inmates’ \nconstitutional rights in this manner . . . . \n  \nId. at *9; see also Reaves, 404 F. Supp. 3d at 523 (same). \nThe Plata Court emphasized that “a statute should not be construed to displace courts’ \ntraditional equitable powers [a]bsent the clearest command to the contrary.” Id. at * 9 (citing \nGilmore v. California, 220 F.3d 987, 997 n.12, and Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. \n305, 313 (1982) (“Unless a statute in so many words, or by a necessary and inescapable \ninference, restricts the court’s jurisdiction in equity, the full scope of that jurisdiction is to be \nrecognized and applied.” (quotation marks and citations omitted))). And the PLRA’s legislative \nrecord indicates that Congress did not intend to limit courts’ ability to move or transfer prisoners \nas a result of other (non-crowding) constitutional violations—including those presented here. See \nReaves, 404 F. Supp. 3d at 523 (“Accepting Defendants argument would mean that the only way \na district court can order the release of a prisoner is for a violation of his constitutional rights \n  21 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-1 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 28 of 33 PageID #:198\nwhere overcrowding caused the violation, but not if any other reason caused the violation. \nDefendants have failed to present anything in the legislative history which evidences \nCongressional intent to limit the protection of inmates’ constitutional rights in this way—\npresumably because there is no such history.”).  \nIn reaching their conclusions that the PLRA did not preclude orders that transferred \nmedically vulnerable inmates, both the Doe Court and the Plata Court found the PLRA’s \nlegislative history to be consistent with the relief Plaintiffs seek here, because Congress enacted \nthe PLRA’s restrictions out of concern with prison population caps. See, e.g., Plata, 2013 WL \n3200587, at *9 (“Sponsors of the PLRA were especially concerned with courts setting \n‘population caps’ and ordering the release of inmates as a sanction for prison administrators’ \nfailure to comply with the terms of consent decrees designed to eliminate overcrowding.”) (citing \nGilmore v. California, 220 F.3d 987, 998 n.14 (9th Cir. 2000)); Doe v. Younger, Ex. B, at 11 \n(“After reviewing the substantive provisions concerning prisoner release orders and the \nlegislative history underlying this provision of the PLRA, it is clear that the prisoner release \norder provisions are directed at prison caps, i.e., orders directing the release of inmates housed in \na particular institution once that institution houses more than a specific number of persons. This \nis not that kind of case.”); see also 141 Cong. Rec. S14414 (daily ed. Sept. 27, 1995) (remarks of \nSen. Dole) (attached as Ex. C) (“Perhaps the most pernicious form of micromanagement is the \nso-called prison population cap…. By establishing tough new conditions that a Federal court \nmust meet before issuing a prison cap order, this bill will slam-shut the revolving prison door.”); \nMargo Schlanger, Anti-Incarcerative Remedies for Illegal Conditions of Confinement, 6 U. \nMiami Race & Soc. Just. L. Rev. 1, 27-28 (2016) (attached as Ex. D) (collecting congressional \ntestimonies and reports identifying federal court-imposed prison population caps as the target of \n  22 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-1 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 29 of 33 PageID #:199\nthe PLRA). Senators who supported Section 3626’s restrictions did so expressly in response to \nfederal court decisions “dictat[ing] prison population size and order[ing] excess prisoners \nreleased.” 142 Cong. Rec. S10576-02, 1996 WL 522797 (remarks of Sen. Abraham) (attached as \nEx. E). Indeed, an earlier version of a bill similar to the PLRA made direct reference to this \npurpose. The proposed amendment to Section 3626(a)(2), concerning “any relief whose purpose \nor effect is to reduce or limit the prison population” was specifically titled, “Restrictions on \nCourt-Ordered Relief In Prison Overcrowding Cases.” See Judicial Impact Statement, Violent \nCriminal Incarceration Act of 1995, H.R. 667 (June 21, 1995) (attached as Ex. F), at 4.20 \nSecond, the requested relief is not the release of prisoners but only the transfer of those \nclass members to another jurisdiction under the Sheriff’s control (i.e., on EHM, as set forth in \nPart A, supra), to remedy an undeniable and growing health crisis. Accordingly, Section \n3626(a)(3) does not apply. See Doe v. Younger, Ex. B, at 12 (“[T]he court’s order does not direct \nthe release of any child.”); see also Plata, 2013 WL 3200587, at *8 (prison-release order \nprovisions of PLRA did not apply to order granting Plaintiffs’ motion for mass transfer of \nprisoners in response to outbreak of infectious disease in California correctional facilities); \nReaves, 404 F. Supp. 3d at 523 (holding that a three-judge panel was not required for order of \ntransfer of quadriplegic prisoner to a non-corrections facility in which he would be treated by a \nphysician with training to care for his substantial and numerous medical needs, as remedy for \ndefendants’ failure to provide adequate medical care). \n \n                                                \n20 If Section 3626 is interpreted to preclude prisoner transfer to address an imminent risk of \nserious illness or death arising from a deadly virus, this provision would also be unconstitutional as \napplied for the same reasons set forth in Section III, supra n.16. \n  23 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-1 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 30 of 33 PageID #:200\nC.  The Relief Requested for Subclass B is Narrowly Drawn, Extends No Further \nthan Necessary, and is the Least Intrusive Means Necessary to Address the \nViolations at Stake.  \n \nThe relief requested for Subclass B, like the relief requested for the Class as a whole, \nmeets the need-narrowness-intrusiveness criteria in Section 3626(a). Because of the gravamen of \nthe underlying complaint, which implicates literal matters of life or death, there is a strong fit \nbetween the violations at stake (the exposure of incarcerated individuals to conditions of \nconfinement that threaten their health and safety), see Helling, 509 U.S. at 33, and the requested \nremedy (an order requiring the Sheriff to impose essential safeguards like social distancing and \nmedical care or, to transfer prisoners from the physical facility where those conditions exist). See \nReeves, 404 F.Supp.3d at 524 (transfer order met PLRA’s narrow tailoring requirements where \ninmate would die if he was not moved); cf. Morales Feliciano, 378 F.3d at 54 (“The narrowness-\nneed-intrusiveness criteria are, to some extent, self-explicating . . . . The application of those \ncriteria is case-specific and must be undertaken in light of both the magnitude of existing \nconstitutional violations and the available alternative remedies.”). As discussed more fully \nabove, the Jail is facing a crisis the likes of which has not been seen before. Subclass B members \nhave already been exposed and therefore urgently require transfer to a safe place until the \npandemic is over. District courts (including several in this Circuit) have granted a prisoner’s \nrequest for preliminary injunctive relief in far less urgent situation circumstances than are facing \nPlaintiffs in this Court.21  \n                                                \n21 See, e.g., Abu-Jamal v. Wetzel, 2017 WL 34700, at *12-20 (M.D. Pa. Jan. 3, 2017) (granting \npreliminary injunction requiring treatment of plaintiff’s Hepatitis C with direct-acting antiviral \nmedication such as Harvoni); Norsworthy v. Beard, 87 F.Supp.3d 1164, 1195 (N.D.

Compare Turner v. Clelland, 2016 \nWL 1069665, *4 (M.D.N.C., Mar. 16, 2016) (citing adverse impact provision in denying relief \nrequiring “involving a federal court in the day-to-day administration of a prison”). \nCONCLUSION \nIn summary, Plaintiffs’ requests for injunctive relief under Section 1983 meet the \nPLRA’s need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirements because they seek narrowly drawn \ninjunctive relief that extends no further than what is required to correct the significant and \nongoing constitutional violation. Neither of Plaintiffs’ current requests for Section 1983 \ninjunctive relief constitutes a prisoner release order and thus the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \n3626(a)(3) do not apply.

R. 28(b). \nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES \n1.  Whether the district court properly granted Sheriff Dart’s motion to dis-\nmiss the Appellants’ claims under 55 ILL. COMP. STAT 5/3-6019-20 alleging that Sher-\niff Dart failed to carry out valid court orders. \n2.  Whether the district court properly granted Sheriff Dart’s motion to dis-\nmiss the Appellants’ Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process \nclaims. \n3.  Whether the district court properly granted Sheriff Dart’s motion to dis-\nmiss the Appellants’ Fourteenth Amendment and Illinois Civil Rights Act equal pro-\ntection claims.  \n4.  Whether the district court properly granted Sheriff Dart’s motion to dis-\nmiss the Appellants’ Fourth Amendment claim for unlawful detention. \n5.  Whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the Appel-\nlants’ motion for class certification. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThe Appellants assert that a state court can compel Sheriff Dart to place pre-\ntrial defendants into Sheriff Dart’s pretrial electronic home monitoring program \n(hereinafter “pretrial EHM program”). This assertion is the foundation of all but the \n1 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 10 of 44 PageID #:213\nAppellants’ equal protection claims, and—as the district court correctly determined—\nthe assertion is without support in the law. \nAdditionally, the Appellants argue in their equal protection claims that Sheriff \nDart’s decision to initially deny the Appellants immediate admission into his pretrial \nEHM program was both motivated by the race of the Appellants, and disparately \nimpacted minorities. As the district court correctly determined, the Appellants’ alle-\ngations were conclusory and insufficient to state a claim. \nFinally, the district court was correct to deny the Appellants’ motion for class \ncertification on the basis of typicality, though, the district court would also have been \ncorrect to deny their motion for class certification on the basis of either commonality \nor numerosity, or because the Appellants’ counsel failed to fully explain their exper-\ntise and adequacy in serving as class counsel. \nThe district court’s dismissal of the Appellants’ claims and denial of the Appel-\nlants’ motion for class certification should be affirmed.  \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \n  Appellants’ entire appeal is predicated on their mistaken notion that they had \na right to placement in Sheriff Dart’s EHM Program by virtue of their bond court \njudge’s bail order, and that a state court has the authority to compel Sheriff Dart to \nplace a given criminal defendant into the Sheriff’s Pretrial EHM Program. These the-\nories are without support in Illinois law. There is no statutory or constitutional right \nto placement in the Sheriff’s EHM Program. Without a statutory or constitutional \nright to placement in Sheriff Dart’s program, and because orders purporting to \n2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 11 of 44 PageID #:214\ncompel Appellants’ placement in Sheriff Dart’s EHM Program are incapable of vest-\ning Appellants with such a right, Appellants fail to identify a constitutional right that \nwas violated. Appellants thus failed to state any cognizable claim in any of their equal \nprotection claims, due process claims, or state law claims alleging that Sheriff Dart \nfailed to execute “facially valid, binding orders.”  \n  Additionally, the district court was correct to conclude that Appellants’ allega-\ntions of race-based discrimination were conclusory in nature, and thus not entitled to \nthe presumption of plausibility.  \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nThis Court reviews the district court’s Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal de novo. Lewis \nv. City of Chicago, 914 F.3d 472, 475 (7th Cir. 2019). \nUnder the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a complaint’s allegations need only \nto set forth “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is \nentitled to relief.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The complaint must “give the defendant fair \nnotice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957)). \nAlthough “detailed factual allegations” are not required, “labels and conclusions, and \na formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Twombly, 550 \nU.S. at 555. A complaint must “include sufficient facts ‘to state a claim for relief that \nis plausible on its face.’” Cole v. Milwaukee Area Tech. Coll. Dist., 634 F.3d 901, 903 \n(7th Cir. 2011) (quoting Justice v. Town of Cicero, 577 F.3d 768, 771 (7th Cir. 2009)). \n“A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows \n3 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 12 of 44 PageID #:215\nthe court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the mis-\nconduct alleged.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). In ruling on a Rule \n12(b)(6) motion, the court “construe[s] the . . . [c]omplaint in the light most favorable \nto Plaintiff, accepting as true all well-pleaded facts and drawing all possible infer-\nences in his favor.” Cole, 634 F.3d at 903. \n  This Court reviews the district court’s denial of class certification under an \nabuse of discretion standard. Lacy v. Cook Cnty., Il., 897 F.3d 847, 863 (7th Cir. \n2018). Abuse of discretion occurs “when a district court commits legal error or \nclearly erroneous factual findings. Id.   \nARGUMENT \nI.  The District Court Did Not Err in Finding that Sheriff Dart Could Not \nBe Compelled by a State Circuit Court Judge to Enroll the Appellants \nin the Sheriff’s EHM Program. \nThe district court was correct to dismiss Appellants’ claims, and the district \ncourt’s decision should be affirmed. Illinois law does not permit a state court to compel \nSheriff Dart to place a pretrial defendant into his EHM program. First, a bond order \nsetting forth EHM as a special condition of such bond is not binding on Sheriff Dart. \nSecond, Sheriff Dart is in no way judicially estopped from making this argument.  \nA. A Special Condition of EHM Contained in a Bond Order is Not Bind-\ning on the Sheriff.  \nWhile the Sheriff seeks to accommodate a court’s EHM orders whenever possi-\nble, he is not mandated to accept a given defendant into his EHM program merely by \nvirtue of a court order purporting to require EHM supervision by the Sheriff as a \nspecial condition of bond. Illinois courts do not have the authority to compel the \n4 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 13 of 44 PageID #:216\nSheriff to monitor defendants via EHM while those defendants are out on bond in a \npretrial setting. The Illinois Code of Criminal Procedure generally, and Illinois’ bail \nstatute specifically, delineates the entities whom Illinois courts may compel to elec-\ntronically monitor such a defendant on bond. The bail statute provides that, as a spe-\ncial condition of bond, a court may order that a defendant: \nBe placed under direct supervision of the Pretrial Services Agency, \nProbation Department or Court Services Department in a pretrial \nbond home supervision capacity with or without the use of an approved \nelectronic monitoring device subject to Article 8A of Chapter V of the \nUnified Code of Corrections [730 ILCS 5/5-8A-1].  \n725 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/110-10(b)(14) (2018) (emphasis added.) Pretrial Services, the \nProbation Department, and the Court Services Department are all departments \nwithin the Office of the Chief Judge. Any mention of the Sheriff is omitted. “Where \na statute lists the things to which it refers, there is an inference that all omissions \nshould be understood as exclusions ***.” Burke v. 12 Rothschild’s Liquor Mart, Inc., \n148 Ill. 2d 429, 442 (1992). This rule of statutory construction is based on logic and \ncommon sense.” Metzger v. DaRosa, 209 Ill. 2d 30, 44 (2004). \nIn contrast, the Illinois bail statute further provides that other agencies (the \nSheriff’s Department, for example) may provide pretrial EHM, if that agency agrees \nto provide such service. Specifically, the Illinois bail statute states that a court may \norder as a condition of bond that a defendant: \nRemain in the custody of such designated person or organization agree-\ning to supervise his release. Such third party custodian shall be re-\nsponsible for notifying the court if the defendant fails to observe the con-\nditions of release which the custodian has agreed to monitor, and shall \nbe subject to contempt of court for failure so to notify the court.  \n5 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 14 of 44 PageID #:217\n725 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/110-10(b)(13) (2018) (emphasis added). A court order is a pre-\nrequisite enabling the Sheriff to place a given defendant on EHM. It is not a basis to \ncompel such monitoring, because the Sheriff, like any other third-party designee con-\ntemplated by the statute, must agree to the monitoring.  \nIn the present case, Sheriff Dart did not agree to supervise the release of the \nAppellants, because of the nature of the charges against the Appellants, the criminal \nbackground of the Appellants, and/or because the Appellants lacked a suitable resi-\ndence from which to be electronically monitored.  \nAs made clear in the statute, county courts may compel EHM through their \nown offices—i.e. the Probation Department, Pretrial Services, or Court Services—but \nthey may not so compel the Sheriff. If an Illinois court wishes to compel EHM of a \ngiven defendant in a pretrial setting, such a court can instead mandate that one of \nits own departments provide that monitoring pursuant to 725 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/110-\n10(b)(13). If such an order were entered in any of these cases, the Sheriff would have \nreleased Appellants. \nBy comparison, in the post-conviction setting, the authority for Illinois courts \nto order EHM through the “supervising authority” (defined to include the local sher-\niff) is based in statute, specifically 730 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/5-8, et seq. (2018). This \ndistinction illustrates the statutory state of Illinois law: Illinois courts do not have \nthe statutory authority to impose upon the Sheriff an obligation to monitor a defend-\nant on bond through EHM in a pretrial setting—that authority was never granted to \nthe courts.  \n6 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 15 of 44 PageID #:218\nAppellants assert that Sheriff Dart doesn’t have the right to disregard orders \njust because he disagrees with those orders. But that misses the point entirely. To \nthe extent that these EHM orders purport to be binding on Sheriff Dart, those orders \nare void, and Sheriff Dart is not obligated to follow them. The Illinois Constitution \nstates: \"The legislative, executive and judicial branches are separate. No branch shall \nexercise powers properly belonging to another.\" ILL. CONST. 1970, ART. II, § 1. \"The \npurpose of this doctrine is to ensure that each of the three branches of government \nretains its own sphere of authority, free from undue encroachment by the other \nbranches.\" People v. Izzo, 195 Ill. 2d 109, 116 (2001).  \nThe limitations of a circuit court’s power to compel has long been recognized in \nIllinois. In discussing a circuit court order seeking to compel the provision of mental \nhealth treatment to a minor, the Illinois appellate court held that in the absence of \nstatutory authority, the juvenile court could not order that a minor be treated at a \nprivate psychiatric hospital nor that the Department of Mental Health and Develop-\nmental Disabilities pay for such care. The court held that “the circuit court may not \nexceed its statutory authority no matter how desirable or beneficial the attempted \ninnovation might be.\" Dep't of Mental Health v. Cnty. of Madison (In re Peak), 59 Ill. \nApp. 3d 548, 551 (5th Dist. 1978). \nA court seeking to compel the Sheriff to place the petitioner on the Sheriff’s \nEHM Program would be exceeding its statutory authority, encroaching upon the ex-\necutive branch, and encroaching upon the discretion of the Sheriff, a constitutional \nofficer. The Sheriff’s pretrial EHM Program is not a creature of statute—it is his own. \n7 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 16 of 44 PageID #:219\nSheriff Dart has discretion to set parameters or guidelines for admission into his pro-\ngram. Whether a given pretrial defendant is placed in the Sheriff’s EHM Program as \na condition of bond is a discretionary decision of the Sheriff’s.  \nIn some cases, the basis for that discretionary decision is the petitioner’s lack \nof a suitable address from which to be monitored. In other cases, it is the nature of a \ndefendant’s pending charge, or a defendant’s violent recidivist background, the flight \nrisk posed by a given defendant, or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. In \neach case, however, the Sheriff exercises his discretion, which is always based on \npractical considerations that take into account the resources available to the Sheriff \nat a given time as well as public safety. The judicial branch may not take as its own \nthose discretionary powers vested in an executive officer. People v. Stinger, 22 Ill. \nApp. 3d 371, 373 (2nd Dist. 1974).  \nA constitutional officer, such as the Sheriff, cannot be compelled to follow a \nvoid order. The Appellate Court addressed this very issue in People v. Stinger. In \nStinger, the State’s Attorney was ordered by the presiding judge to provide a court \nreporter for grand jury proceedings in a pending murder case. The State’s Attorney \nrefused and conducted the grand jury proceedings without a court reporter. The pre-\nsiding judge held the State’s Attorney in contempt for refusing to obey his order to \nprovide a court reporter for the proceedings. The State’s Attorney asserted that the \npresiding judge had no authority to order the State’s Attorney to provide a court re-\nporter.  \n8 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 17 of 44 PageID #:220\nOn appeal, the presiding judge argued that, even if there was no express au-\nthority for him to order the State’s Attorney to provide a court reporter, and it was \nerror to do so, the State’s Attorney did not have the right to disregard his order. The \nappellate court disagreed, and vacated the contempt finding. The Court stated that:  \nOne is justified in refusing to comply with a court order only if such order \nis utterly void, but it is no defense in a contempt proceeding to show that \nthe order was merely erroneous…. [c]ontempt will not lie for violation of \na void decree but voidness is established when the issuing court is found \nto have lacked jurisdiction to enter such an order. The test of jurisdiction \nis said to be whether the court has power to enter into the inquiry before \nit, and this is determined by (1) jurisdiction of the parties, (2) jurisdic-\ntion of the subject matter, and (3) power in the court to decide the par-\nticular matters presented. All such factors being present, the correct-\nness of the court's determination has no bearing upon the initial ques-\ntion of jurisdiction.  \nStinger, 22 Ill. App. 3d at 374. The Stinger Court held that the circuit court certainly \nhad jurisdiction over the parties, and jurisdiction of the subject matter, but that in \nthe absence of any statutory authority, the circuit court did not have the power to \norder the State’s Attorney to provide a court reporter, and so the court’s order failed \nthe third test of jurisdiction. The order was thus void, and the appellate court vacated \nthe finding of contempt. Id. at 375.  \n Similarly, circuit courts certainly had jurisdiction over the parties and the \nsubject matter in Appellants’ pending criminal cases, but they lacked the power to \norder the Sheriff to place anyone in the Sheriff’s pretrial EHM program. Without that \npower, the special-conditions-of-bond order is not merely erroneous: to the extent that \na court or any other individual seeks to enforce the order, it is void, and the Sheriff \ncannot be compelled to follow it. Nor could a void order from a bond court judge ever \nbe deemed to vest Appellants with a right to anything. \n9 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 18 of 44 PageID #:221\nThe Sheriff had no duty to follow the EHM orders of the bond courts, because \nthose orders were void. Since Sheriff Dart was not bound to follow the circuit court \nEHM orders, Appellants’ state law claims under 55 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/3-6019 and 55 \nILL. COMP. STAT. 5/3-6020 fail. By extension, those orders were never capable of en-\ndowing Appellants with a right to placement in the Sheriff’s EHM program, because \nthe courts never had the authority to compel such placement. Without a constitu-\ntional right implicated, there can be no §1983 claim.  Appellants never had a consti-\ntutional right to be placed in Sheriff Dart’s EHM Program. Without that right, all of \nAppellants’ claims fail.  \nB. Sheriff Dart is Not Judicially Estopped from Stating that He is Not \nBound by Virtue of a Bond Court Order to Enroll a Pretrial Defend-\nant into Sheriff Dart’s Pretrial EHM Program. \n    Appellants argue that the Sheriff’s arguments above are barred by judicial \nestoppel, claiming that the Sheriff’s current arguments are opposite arguments ad-\nvanced by the Sheriff in the cases of Zachary Robinson v. Leroy Martin Jr., 2016 CH \n13587 (Cir. Ct. Cook County 2016) and Dawson v. Dart, No. 11 C 7300, 2018 WL \n2267792 (N.D. Ill. May 16, 2018). Appellants’ Br. 24-25. In reality, the position of the \nSheriff in this case is not in any way contrary to the position advanced by the Sheriff \nin either of those two cases, and is not in any way barred by judicial estoppel. \nThe Robinson case was a suit filed against the Chief Judge of the Criminal \nDivision of the Circuit Court of Cook County, alleging in essence that bond court \njudges were setting high cash bonds, which unfairly discriminated against the poor \nand  disproportionately affected people  of minority  groups.  The  Sheriff  was  also \nnamed, even though the Sheriff had no role in setting the cash bail amount. The \n10 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 19 of 44 PageID #:222\nSheriff’s argument in the Robinson case—that the Sheriff cannot alter the cash bail \namount in a bond order—is not a contrary position from the one taken in this case: \nthat the Sheriff cannot be compelled by the Court to provide for the supervised release \nof  Appellants via the Sheriff’s EHM program.  \nAppellants additionally argue that Sheriff Dart lacks the authority to review \nbond court orders. In order to support this argument, as they did in the exact same \nway in the district court, Appellants again in their brief misrepresent this Court’s \nopinion in Richman v. Sheahan, 270 F.3d 430, 437 (7th Cir. 2001) by claiming that \nthis Court held “allowing sheriffs to ‘act as appellate courts,’ reviewing the validity of \nbond or other facially valid court orders is ‘untenable.’” Appellants’ Brief, p. 22. As \nSheriff Dart noted in the district court when Appellants cited this same case for the \nsame purported holding, Appellants replaced the word “requiring” with the word “al-\nlowing.” Richman held not that the Sheriff lacked authority to investigate the validity \nof the bond court orders. Rather, the case held that the Sheriff did not have the duty \nto investigate the validity of the bond court orders. Richman, 270 F.3d at 437. There \nis nothing illegal or improper in Sheriff Dart electing to investigate the validity of \norders directed to him. \nWhile the Sheriff has no authority in the Bail Act to alter the cash bail ordered \nby a court, he does have authority to decline the pretrial supervised release of a de-\nfendant. That authority is found in the Illinois Bail Act, at 725 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/110-\n10(b)(13).  \n11 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 20 of 44 PageID #:223\nNor is any argument of the Sheriff’s judicially estopped by the Dawson case. \nDawson was shot by assailants while he was on the Sheriff’s EHM program. After \nbeing shot, Dawson was hospitalized. While hospitalized, Dawson was arrested by \nthe Cook County Sheriff and taken into custody (presumably at Cermak, the hospital \nunit within Cook County Jail). Dawson alleged that the Sheriff violated his Fourth \nAmendment rights in wrongfully detaining him after he was shot. In dismissing Daw-\nson’s claims, the Court found that a condition precedent to enrollment in the Sheriff’s \nEHM program was a home from which to be monitored, and by virtue of being hospi-\ntalized after he was shot, Dawson was without a home and therefore the Sheriff no \nlonger agreed to Dawson’s continued placement in the Sheriff’s EHM program, and \nwas therefore not entitled to EHM placement. Dawson, 2018 WL 2267792, at *9, foot-\nnote 3. As in Dawson, here too the Sheriff is not violating Appellants’ Fourth Amend-\nment rights in refusing to release them. As in Dawson, Appellants may seek from the \nbond court an amendment to their conditions of bond, which many of Appellants have \nin fact done. In any case, there is nothing about the arguments made in Dawson which \nwould judicially estop arguments made by the Sheriff in this case. Rather, the argu-\nments made here, in Dawson, and in Robinson are entirely consistent.      \nII.  The District Court Did Not Err in Dismissing Appellants’ Fourteenth \nAmendment Substantive Due Process Claim. \nAppellants have alleged that their continued detention following bond court by \nthe Sheriff constituted, presumably, a violation of their right to bodily integrity, and \ntherefore a violation of their substantive due process rights. The District Court was \ncorrect to dismiss this Count with prejudice. \n12 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 21 of 44 PageID #:224\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has limited the reach of the substantive component \nof the due-process clause guarantee to cases involving abuse of governmental power \nso arbitrary and oppressive that it shocks the conscience. Cnty. of Sacramento v. \nLewis, 523 U.S. 833, 846 (1998). This standard is met only by “conduct intended to \ninjure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest.” Id. at 854; see also, \nCatinella v. Cnty. of Cook, 881.F.3d 514 (7th Cir. 2018).  \nThe Sheriff’s alleged conduct in this case was neither so arbitrary or oppressive \nthat it shocks the conscience, nor was it intended to injure in some way unjustifiable \nby any government interest. To the contrary, the Sheriff’s continued detention of Ap-\npellants was predicated on and mandated by the bond court orders themselves, which \nconditioned each Appellant’s release upon payment of the required bail and place-\nment in the Sheriff’s EHM program. As Appellants have stated repeatedly in their \nown pleadings, the Sheriff is bound to execute all valid orders, and can be held in \ncontempt for failing to do so. The Sheriff would have been violating the court’s order \nhad he released the Appellants without placing them in his EHM program. Failing \ntheir placement, the Sheriff was not only justified in detaining the Appellants; he was \nrequired to detain the Appellants. \nThis reasoning is supported by the plain language of the Bail Act and the def-\ninitions of “bail” and “bail bond” found in the Illinois Code of Criminal Procedure. \n“Bail” is defined in the Code as the amount of money set by the court which is required \nto be obligated and secured as provided by law for the release of a person in custody \nin order that he will appear before the court in which his appearance may be required \n13 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 22 of 44 PageID #:225\nand that he will comply with such conditions as set forth in the bail bond. 725 ILL. \nCOMP. STAT. 5/102-6 “Bail” (2018). “Bail Bond” is defined as an undertaking secured \nby bail entered into by a person in custody by which he binds himself to comply with \nsuch conditions as are set forth therein. 725 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/102-7 “Bail Bond” \n(2018). \nThe Illinois Bail Act establishes definitively that the Sheriff was not empow-\nered to simply release the Appellants from his custody because the bond orders con-\nditioned the Appellants’ release upon the Appellants’ placement in the Sheriff’s EHM \nprogram. “Upon depositing this sum and any bond fee authorized by law, the person \nshall be released from custody subject to the conditions of the bail bond.” 725 ILL. \nCOMP. STAT. 5/110-7 “Deposit of Bail Security” (2018) (emphasis added.) Any pretrial \ndefendant’s release on bond is predicated on their satisfying all conditions of that \nbond.  \nThe Appellants argue that “subject to” is a “term” undefined by the Bail Act, \nand is a term which has alternative definitions that should have been considered by \nthe District Court, and which would not have led to the District Court’s conclusion \nthat the Appellants’ release was conditioned upon their placement in the EHM pro-\ngram. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 18) The Appellants, however, never raised this argument \nbefore the District Court. Failing to draw a district court’s attention to an applicable \nlegal theory waives pursuit of that theory on appeal. United Cent. Bank v. Davenport \nEstate LLC, 815 F.3d 315, 318 (7th Cir. 2016) (internal citations omitted). \n14 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 23 of 44 PageID #:226\nThe Appellant’s statutory interpretation argument would be unpersuasive \neven if it were not waived, because when considered in its entirety, the Illinois Bail \nAct amply supports the interpretation of the phrase “subject to” adopted by the Dis-\ntrict Court. The “language and design of the statute as a whole may also provide \nguidance in determining the plain meaning of its provisions.” United States v. Berkos, \n543 F.3d 392, 396 (7th Cir. 2008) (internal citations omitted). The Illinois Bail Act, \nwhen considered in its entirety, indeed provides guidance in determining whether a \npretrial defendant’s release was conditioned upon his or her satisfaction of bond con-\nditions imposed by the Court. For example, 725 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/110-5 is titled “De-\ntermining the amount of bail and conditions of release.” There is no statutory ambi-\nguity which supports the Appellants’ statutory interpretation argument. \nIn fact, a court in this district has already found that the Sheriff was justified \nin detaining a pretrial defendant when the Sheriff refused to place that pretrial de-\nfendant in the Sheriff’s EHM program, and placement was a condition of that defend-\nant’s bond. See Dawson v. Dart, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82902, *3 (N.D. Ill. 2018) \n(Durkin, C.J.) (finding that the plaintiff failed to plead a Monell claim because the \nSheriff was justified in taking into custody a pretrial defendant on EHM for a pending \nburglary, when that individual was subsequently hospitalized, and so longer quali-\nfied for the Sheriff’s EHM program.) \nMoreover, in addition to following the court’s orders, the Sheriff’s additional \njustification in detaining the Appellants was his statutory duty to maintain public \nsafety. “Each sheriff… shall prevent crime and maintain the safety and order of the \n15 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 24 of 44 PageID #:227\ncitizens of that county.” 55 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/3-6021 (2018). The Sheriff is not assert-\ning, and has never asserted, that the Appellants were not appropriate candidates for \nsome other form of monitoring, or monitoring on EHM provided by another entity, or \nfor cash bail without any special conditions of bond. Rather, the Sheriff has stead-\nfastly maintained that the Appellants were not appropriate candidates for his EHM \nprogram. \nIt is the Sheriff’s statutory duty to refrain from placing on EHM more pretrial \ndetainees with a recidivist background and/or pending charges alleging violence or \ngun crimes than he can responsibly monitor while still maintaining the public safety. \nThis is a determination involving the day-to-day operation of Cook County jail, and \nis within the province and professional experience of the Sheriff. As the Supreme \nCourt has noted, courts should ordinarily defer to corrections officials in such mat-\nters. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 548 (1979). The Sheriff’s determination with re-\nspect to the Appellants is entitled to such deference here.  \nThe Cook County Sheriff’s pretrial EHM program was never intended to mon-\nitor individuals like Appellants out in the community while awaiting trial. Instead, \nthe program was and remains intended to reduce the daily jail population by releas-\ning into the community nonviolent individuals charged with nonviolent, lower-level \ncrimes. The Sheriff does not have, as a routine matter, the resources to electronically \nmonitor Appellants – and others similarly situated to them – out in the community. \nNor does the Sheriff have access to infinite funds to provide such monitoring to an \never-increasing number of pretrial defendants. \n16 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 25 of 44 PageID #:228\nIt is precisely because the Sheriff does not have the resources to, on a routine \nbasis, adequately electronically monitor defendants with criminal backgrounds or vi-\nolent charges similar to the named Appellants in this case that Sheriff Dart did not \nplace Appellants into his EHM program in the first place. It is the Sheriff’s EHM \nprogram, after all. He is statutorily charged with imposing the rules and regulations \nfor the administration of the jail, and is responsible for maintaining the public’s \nsafety. It is no revelation to judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and defendants \nthat certain defendants do not qualify for Sheriff Dart’s EHM program.  \nIn fact, there is an entire group of defendants not placed in the program for a \ntotally separate reason than the reason Appellants were refused placement. Admin-\nistration of the EHM program requires that the person to be monitored have a home, \nand a phone and wi-fi service within that home. Every day there are over 100 people \nhoused in the Cook County Jail who are charged with nonviolent crimes such as drug \npossession and retail theft with low bonds or I-Bonds, and with the special condition \nof bond being admitted into Sheriff Dart’s EHM program. Unfortunately, in spite of \nthe Court’s bail order containing EHM as a condition of bond, Sheriff Dart cannot \nmove these individuals into the EHM program because they are homeless, and thus \ncannot be electronically monitored.  \nIt is ironic that Sheriff Dart is being portrayed by the Appellants as someone \nbent on keeping individuals in physical custody rather than being released on EHM. \nAs explained in his letter to the County Board and attached to the Appellants’ Com-\nplaint, Sheriff Dart has long advocated for these nonviolent individuals to have their \n17 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 26 of 44 PageID #:229\nbonds reviewed by the individual judges who set the bail in the hopes that the indi-\nvidual judges would reduce the bonds to I-Bonds without the condition of EHM, and \nhas long stated publicly that the public interest is not served by detention of these \nnonviolent individuals within the walls of the county jail. No one would suggest, or \nhas suggested, that Sheriff Dart was disregarding a Court’s bail order by not enrolling \na homeless defendant in the EHM program. Everyone understands that regrettably, \nthe Sheriff’s Office cannot adequately monitor these individuals through EHM be-\ncause of their homelessness and/or lack of wi-fi access. A home and wi-fi access are \nprerequisites to one’s admission into the Sheriff’s EHM program. These prerequisites \nof a home and wi-fi access is a condition imposed not by statute or by any court, but \nrather by the Sheriff in his review of the practical realities of his obligation to monitor \nthose individuals to be placed on EHM. \nThe list of these nonviolent individuals who would be released on EHM but for \ntheir homelessness is provided every day to the Office of the Public Defender and any \nprivate defense attorneys representing these often-indigent defendants. On infor-\nmation and belief, Appellants here are not claiming to be “similarly situated” to these \nnonviolent individuals. Rather, Appellants and those “similarly situated” to Appel-\nlants fail to satisfy a different prerequisite for admission into the Sheriff’s EHM pro-\ngram.  \nThe Appellants here were refused placement in Sheriff Dart’s EHM program \nfor different reasons: their violent recidivist background and/or pending charges of \nviolence. Specifically, public records establish that each of the Appellants is charged \n18 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 27 of 44 PageID #:230\nwith a violent offense, has an extensive violent criminal history, and/or poses a threat \nto the community. Taphia Williams is charged with aggravated kidnapping (a Class \nX felony). Gregory Cooper was out on bond for armed robbery with a firearm (a class \nX felony punishable by 21-45 years in prison) when he was arrested on a new charge \nof delivery of Heroin within 1,000 feet of a school (a class 1 felony). Marcus Johnson \nis charged with being a gang member in possession of a firearm (a class 2 felony), and \nat the time of his arrest was wanted for questioning in a murder. Joshua Atwater is \ncharged with aggravated kidnapping (a class X felony) and aggravated criminal sex-\nual assault (a class 2 felony). Tony Mason is charged with one count of armed habitual \ncriminal and one count of delivery of between 100 and 400 grams of cocaine (both \nClass X felonies), after he was arrested and found in possession of over $1,100 in cash, \nmultiple bags of crack cocaine, and a 9mm handgun outfitted with an extended clip \ncontaining 29 live rounds and another in the chamber.   \nIn each case, there were constitutionally-permissible considerations for Sheriff \nDart in determining whether or not a given pretrial defendant will be placed in his \nEHM program. Appellants failed to gain placement because of those considerations. \nWhere the Sheriff cannot release to EHM a nonviolent homeless defendant because \nthe defendant does not have a home to monitored within, the Sheriff cannot routinely \nplace defendants like Appellants in his EHM because Appellants’ violent criminal \nbackground and/or pending charges of violence indicate that Appellants pose a safety \nrisk to the community, and an increased administrative and budgetary burdens to \nmonitor.  \n19 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 28 of 44 PageID #:231\nIn light of the Bail Act specifically, the Code of Criminal Procedure generally, \nand the Sheriff’s duty to maintain public safety, the Sheriff’s detention of the Appel-\nlants was justified, and certainly reasonable, but in any event fails to shock the con-\nscience. After all, for purposes of due process, governmental action does not have to \nbe the only alternative, or even the best alternative for it to be reasonable and con-\nstitutional. Bell, 441 U.S. at 542 (quoting in a footnote Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93 \n(1979). For all of these reasons, the Appellants’ substantive due process claim fails as \na matter of law, and the District Court’s dismissal of the claim with prejudice should \nbe affirmed.  \nIII.  The District Court Did Not Err in Dismissing the Appellants’ Racial \nDiscrimination Claims Under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Il-\nlinois Civil Rights Act. \nThe district court dismissed the Appellants’ equal protection claims because \nthe Appellants failed to sufficiently allege discriminatory impact upon a protected \nclass and a discriminatory purpose on the part of Sheriff Dart. Instead, the Appel-\nlants’ allegations purporting to support their equal protection claims were almost en-\ntirely conclusory.  \nFor instance, Appellants alleged that “upon information and belief, numerous \nindividuals of other races and identities who were similarly situated to the [Appel-\nlants], who posted bond or otherwise satisfied their conditions of release, were not \ndetained pursuant to Dart’s policy and were allowed to be placed on electronic home \n20 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 29 of 44 PageID #:232\nmonitoring.” App. 19, Third Am. Compl., ¶44., p. A126.1 The district court was not \nrequired to accept such conclusory allegations as true for the purposes of a motion to \ndismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). \nThe tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations in a \ncomplaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions. Threadbare recitals of the \nelements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, \ndo not suffice. Although for the purposes of a motion to dismiss courts \nmust take all of the factual allegations in the complaint as true, they are \nnot bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual alle-\ngation.  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009). \nThe conclusory nature of Appellants’ pleadings are self-evident. For example, \nin the aforementioned ¶44, Appellants did not disclose the nature or severity of their \nown pending charges or criminal backgrounds, let alone allege that individuals of an \nunprotected class with those similar specific charges or criminal backgrounds were \ntreated more favorably. Of the remaining allegations cited by the Appellants in their \nresponse brief to the district court, ¶41 and ¶46 were conclusory and/or legal conclu-\nsions, and ¶47 addressed—for unexplained reasons—a 2017 Department of Justice \nreport which concluded that African Americans have been disproportionately tar-\ngeted for decades by the Chicago Police Department. App. 19, Third Am. Compl., p. \nA126. The Appellants never explained to the district court what the Chicago Police \nDepartment has to do with the Sheriff’s EHM program, or how a discriminatory pur-\npose on the part of the Chicago Police Department would constitute proof or even a \n \n1 Throughout this brief, “App.” refers to the appendix filed with Williams’ opening \nbrief, see docket entry 19.  \n21 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 30 of 44 PageID #:233\nrelevant allegation as to a discriminatory purpose on the part of Sheriff Dart or dis-\ncriminatory impact upon the Appellants. \nAppellants assert that they adequately pleaded these claims because they have \nalleged invidious discrimination in their Complaint, which states: \nSheriff Dart’s statement that people from the South and West sides of \nChicago—primarily African Americans—are to be the most closely scru-\ntinized shows that Dart’s policy of refusing to release certain detainees \nis motivated by racial bias and racist assumptions about the likelihood \nthat people from primarily African American neighborhoods pose a pub-\nlic safety risk or are likely to reoffend.  \nApp. 19, Third Am. Compl., ¶40, p. A126. Appellants assert that these allegations, \nalong with the allegations in paragraphs 38 through 40 characterizing quotes of the \nSheriff and his Chief Policy Advisor found in newspaper articles attached to the com-\nplaint as exhibits, are entitled to be presumed as true for the purposes of a 12(b)(6) \nmotion. These allegations, however, are conclusory in nature, and as such are not \nentitled to be assumed as true. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 681. Moreover, the newspaper arti-\ncles themselves were exhibits to the Complaint. A copy of any written instrument \nwhich is an exhibit to a pleading is a part of thereof for all purposes. Venture Assocs. \nCorp. v. Zenith Data Sys. Corp., 987 F.2d 429, 431 (7th Cir. 1992). Those exhibits \nspeak for themselves, and are by any plain reading race-neutral. In any case, how-\never, Appellants’ characterization of those articles or the quotes contained therein—\neven though couched as allegations in the complaint—are, by definition, conclusory.   \nSetting aside the conclusory allegations of a complaint, a Court must consider \nthe factual allegations in a complaint to determine if they plausibly suggest an enti-\ntlement  to  relief.  Iqbal,  556  U.S.  at  681.  The  factual  allegations  making  up \n22 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 31 of 44 PageID #:234\nAppellants’ equal protection claims—to the extent they even exist—fail to plausibly \nsuggest an entitlement to relief. The facts of the Iqbal case are instructive in analyz-\ning the plausibility of Appellants’ equal protection claims.  \nThe Iqbal complaint alleged that the FBI under the direction of the FBI Direc-\ntor arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men as part of its investigation \nof the events of September 11, and further claimed that the policy of holding post-\nSeptember-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confinement until they \nwere cleared by the FBI was approved by Attorney General Ashroft and Mueller in \ndiscussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 682. \nIn analyzing the complaint’s allegations, the Court held: \nTaken as true, these allegations are consistent with petitioners’ \npurposefully designating detainees “of high interest” because of their \nrace, religion, or national origin. But given more likely explanations, \nthey do not plausibly establish this purpose. The September 11 attacks \nwere perpetrated by 19 Arab Muslim hijackers who counted themselves \nmembers  in  good  standing  of  Al  Qaeda, an  Islamic  fundamentalist \ngroup. Al Qaeda was headed by another Arab Muslim – Osama bin \nLaden – and composed in large part of his Arab Muslim disciples. It \nshould come as no surprise that a legitimate policy directing law en-\nforcement to arrest and detain individuals because of their suspected \nlinks to the attacks would produce a disparate, incidental impact on \nArab Muslims, even though the purpose of the policy was to target nei-\nther Arabs nor Muslims. On the facts respondent alleges the arrests \nMueller oversaw were likely lawful and justified by his nondiscrimina-\ntory intent to detain aliens who were illegally present in the United \nStates and who had potential connections to those who committed ter-\nrorist acts. As between the obvious alternative explanation for the arrests, \nand the purposeful, invidious discrimination respondent asks us to infer, \ndiscrimination is not a plausible conclusion.”  \nId. at 682 (emphasis added). Similar to the Iqbal case, Appellants here allege that \ntheir race was Sheriff Dart’s motivating factor in deciding to refuse them enrollment \nin his EHM program. In support of this theory, Appellants alleged that “recent \n23 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 32 of 44 PageID #:235\npublicly available documents from the Sheriff’s office” show that as many as 85 indi-\nviduals were detained pursuant to Dart’s policy, and that at least 80% are African \nAmerican, where African Americans make up only 30% of Chicago’s population. App. \n19, Third Am. Compl., ¶41-43, p. A126. However, as the district court noted, the racial \nmakeup of the City of Chicago is irrelevant to the issues in this suit. Rather, the \nrelevant population for comparison is that of the Cook County Jail. App. 19, Mem. \nOp. and Order, Nov. 4, 2019, p. A237.  \nMoreover, as in Iqbal, these allegations, taken as true, may be consistent with \nthe Sheriff intentionally discriminating against Appellants because of their race, but \ngiven more likely explanations, they do not establish this purpose. In fact, other pub-\nlicly records from the Sheriff establish that Appellants’ race was not the cause of their \nbeing denied enrollment in the Sheriff’s EHM program.  \nSpecifically, the daily demographic composition of the Cook County Jail dating \nback  to  October  of  2017  is  available  online  at  https://www.cookcountysher-\niff.org/data/. Those daily data sheets establish conclusively that the Sheriff does not \ndiscriminate against African Americans in determining who he enrolls in his pretrial \nEHM program. In fact, the daily data shows that African Americans have since at \nleast October of 2017 consistently comprised approximately 70% of the Cook County \nJail population, and have likewise consistently comprised approximately 70% of the \nSheriff’s EHM program population.  \nThe Court may take judicial notice of matters of public record. Anderson v. \nSimon, 217 F.3d 472, 474 (7th Cir. 2000). These public records establish conclusively \n24 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 33 of 44 PageID #:236\nthat the vast majority of individuals enrolled in the Sheriff’s EHM program are Afri-\ncan American, and in fact that the proportion of African Americans enrolled in the \nSheriff’s EHM program roughly matches the proportion of African Americans in the \nSheriff’s custody. These public records prove false any allegation or insinuation that \nthe Sheriff discriminates against African Americans in determining who he enrolls \nin his EHM program, and makes exceedingly implausible Appellants’ claims that the \nSheriff has excluded Appellants from enrollment in his EHM program because of \ntheir race.   \nRather, the obvious alternative explanation for the Sheriff’s refusal to enroll \nAppellants in his EHM program, explained in the emails and newspaper articles af-\nfixed as exhibits to Appellants’ complaint, consisted of the following race-neutral \nfacts, none of which was disputed by Appellants in their Response brief filed in the \ndistrict court: (1) the Sheriff’s EHM program was never intended for the pretrial su-\npervision of individuals with violent recidivist backgrounds and/or pending charges \nof violence; (2) the Sheriff does not have infinite resources to administer any of his \nprograms, including his pretrial EHM program, and individuals facing charges of vi-\nolence, with violent recidivist backgrounds, and/or who pose a flight risk, require ad-\nditional resources to monitor on EHM; and (3) Appellants are all facing charges of \nviolence and/or have violent recidivist background. \nAppellants’ federal and state equal protection claims are simply implausible. \n“[O]nly a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dis-\nmiss. Determining whether a claim states a plausible claim for relief will… be a \n25 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 34 of 44 PageID #:237\ncontext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experi-\nence and common sense. But where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to \ninfer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged – but \nit has not shown – that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679.  \nLike in Iqbal, as between the “obvious alternative explanation” for the Sheriff’s \nrefusal to enroll Appellants in the Sheriff’s electronic home monitoring program, and \nthe purposeful, invidious discrimination Appellants ask the Court to infer, discrimi-\nnation was not a plausible conclusion. In light of the publicly available demographic \ndata of the jail population, and the conclusory nature of Appellants’ allegations, the \ndistrict court was correct to dismiss these claims.  \nThe Appellants cannot support their equal protection claims against Sheriff \nDart merely by labeling him a racist. Their claims must be plausible. The Appellants’ \nequal protection and civil rights claims, based entirely on irrelevant statistics and \ntwo misleading, out-of-context quotes from his policy director Ms. Smith—quotes that \nare entirely race-neutral—fail that test, and the district court was correct to dismiss \nthose claims.  \nThe Appellants now argue—for the first time—that “…it was obvious that \nDart’s consideration of arrest history would inevitably target African Americans for \nextended detention.” Appellants’ Br., p. 35. Appellants waived that argument, be-\ncause they never asserted it before the district court. United Cent. Bank v. Davenport \nEstate LLC, 815 F.3d 315, 318 (7th Cir. 2016) (internal citations omitted). It is an \nunpersuasive and implausible argument even if it had not been waived, however, \n26 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 35 of 44 PageID #:238\nconsidering the aforementioned publicly available statistical information maintained \nby the Sheriff as well as words of Sheriff Dart and his chief policy officer at the time \nCara Smith in the articles repeatedly referenced by the Appellants.  \nAppellants failed to adequately plead an equal protection claim under either \nfederal or state law, and the district court was correct to dismiss those claims. Appel-\nlants were not “targeted” because they are African American. Rather, Sheriff Dart’s \ndecision to refuse placement to Appellants was based upon their criminal background \nand/or the nature of their pending charge.   \nIV.  The District Court Did Not Err in Dismissing the Appellants’ Fourth \nAmendment Claim. \nAppellants’ Fourth Amendment claim is for alleged unlawful detention by \nSheriff Dart, alleging that Sheriff Dart “…knowing that he had no legal justification, \ncaused Appellants to be detained, violating Appellants’ right to be free from unrea-\nsonable seizures guaranteed to them by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of \nthe United States Constitution.” App. 19, Second. Am. Compl. at ¶111, p. A014. In \nreality, however, the detention of Appellants by Sheriff Dart followed a finding of \nprobable cause to detain each Appellant made by a Circuit Court Judge.  \nThe Fourth Amendment establishes the standards and procedures governing \npretrial detention. Manuel v. City of Joliet, 137 S. Ct. 911, 914 (2017). “The Fourth \nAmendment protects the right of the people to be secure in their persons against un-\nreasonable seizures. A person is seized whenever officials restrain his freedom of \nmovement such that he is not free to leave. The general rule is that Fourth Amend-\nment seizures are ‘reasonable’ only if based on probable cause to believe that the \n27 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 36 of 44 PageID #:239\nindividual has committed a crime.” Id. at 917. The Fourth Amendment prohibits gov-\nernment officials from detaining a person unless a judge or grand jury makes a reli-\nable finding of probable cause that the accused had committed the crime charges. \nGerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 114 (1975). \nHere, Appellants make no allegation in the district court that they were being \nheld without the probable cause hearing required in Gerstein. In fact, each Appellant \nappeared before a Cook County Circuit Court Judge on each Appellant’s felony case. \nOn each case, a Circuit Court judge made a finding of probable cause to detain each \nAppellant. Nor did Appellants contest in the district court the factual bases of those \nfindings.  \nThe district court correctly ruled that, in failing to allege either (1) that Sheriff \nDart detained Appellants in the absence of a finding of probable cause to believe each \nAppellant committed a crime, or (2) that Sheriff Dart detained Appellants after a \nfinding of probable cause that was premised on unreliable or false information, the \nAppellants failed to state a Fourth Amendment cause of action. The Appellants now \nargue—for the first time—that in refusing to admit Appellants into his EHM pro-\ngram, Sheriff Dart “re-seized” Appellants. Appellants’ Br., p. 39. This legal theory \nwas never advanced by the Appellants in the district court, however, and is thus \nwaived. United Cent. Bank v. Davenport Estate LLC, 815 F.3d 315, 318 (7th Cir. 2016) \n(internal citations omitted). Even if it were not waived, the argument is unpersuasive, \nbecause it again presumes that Appellants satisfied all conditions of bond to secure \n28 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 37 of 44 PageID #:240\ntheir release. They did not. The Appellants failed to secure enrollment in Sheriff \nDart’s EHM program, which was a condition of their release. \nV.  The District Court Did Not Err in Denying the Appellants’ Motion to \nCertify an Injunctive Class. \nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellants’ motion for \nclass certification on the basis of typicality, though it would have been correct to deny \nthe Appellants’ motion for class certification on the basis of either commonality or \nnumerosity, as well, or in requiring the Appellants’ counsel to also more fully explain \ntheir expertise and adequacy in serving as class counsel. \nIn the district court, Appellants proposed that the following class be certified: \n“All individuals who have been detained, are currently being detained, or in the fu-\nture will be detained at the Cook County Jail, even though their bond has been \nposted, in violation of a facially valid court order, pursuant to Dart’s policy of con-\nducting his own review of bond decisions made by Cook County Judges.” App 19, \nThird Am. Compl., ¶121, p. A133.  \nA. Appellants’ Purported Class Fails to Satisfy the Numerosity Re-\nquirement.  \nAppellants assert in their motion for class certification that their proposed \nclass “easily meets” the 40-person standard. R. 2, Pls’ Mot. for Class Certification, p. \n3.2 In their Third Amended Complaint, Appellants claim that their proposed class \nnumbers in excess of 80 people. App. 19, Third Am. Compl., ¶¶124-125, p. A134. In \naddition  to  the named  plaintiffs,  Appellants  claim  that  over  70  individuals  are \n \n2 Throughout this brief, “R.” refers to district court docket entries. \n29 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 38 of 44 PageID #:241\nsimilarly situated to them and would be appropriate class members. App. 19, Third \nAm. Compl., ¶125, p. A134 (referring to a list of individuals on administrative review \nby the Sheriff, dated March 6, 2018, and attached to Appellants’ Complaint as Exhibit \nG). \nAs Sheriff Dart argued before the district court, the vast majority of the orders \nfor the individuals Appellants have referenced direct no particular agency to accept \nthe individual into an EHM program. Of the entire list in Exhibit G of Appellants’ \nThird Amended Complaint (which presumably includes even individuals who Appel-\nlants do not seek to add as class members), the undersigned counsel located only nine \nwith bond court orders specifically placing or referring Appellants to the Sheriff’s \nEHM program. App. 19, Third Am. Compl., Ex G., p. A217. Of the individuals named \nin Appellants’ Third Amended Complaint at ¶125, only Terrance Strickland was so \nordered. Of the nine named plaintiffs, the bond court orders of only three—Taphia \nWilliams, Joshua Atwater, and Tony Mason—state that the Sheriff was to place them \nin the Sheriff’s EHM program.  \nApart from these 12 orders (the three named plaintiffs and the nine additional \nindividuals from Exhibit G), the remaining orders do not identify whether the Court \nintended that pretrial services, the probation department, or the Sheriff administer \nelectronic monitoring. These remaining orders do not specify which agency is sup-\nposed to administer electronic monitoring at all. Instead, they merely state “EM”, \n“EM SCOB”, or “electronic home monitoring as a special condition of bond.”  \n30 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 39 of 44 PageID #:242\nThough true in the past the Sheriff has placed individuals with nonspecific EM \norders into his EM program, the distinction between certain of the named Appellants’ \nbond court orders and other named Appellants’ bond court orders is not immaterial. \nRather, Appellants’ proposed class certification motion hinges on their allegation that \nthe Sheriff violated a “facially valid bond order” directing him to place Appellants in \nhis EHM program, and instead detained Appellants. This assertion presumes that \neach Appellant’s state court order directed the Sheriff to place each Appellant in the \nSheriff’s EHM program.  \nWhen limited to the Appellants or potential class members with court orders \npurporting to place them specifically in the Sheriff’s EHM program, Appellants’ pro-\nposed class falls well short of satisfying the numerosity requirement. In fact, that \ngroup of individuals appears to number fewer than 15. Nor is the number of potential \nclass members growing, as Appellants were all eventually—within 14 days, according \nto Appellants’ Third Amended Complaint—placed on the Sheriff’s EHM program, and \nthe “unlawful policy” Appellants complain of—the Sheriff’s administrative review of \nthe criminal background of and charges pending against individuals ordered onto his \nEHM program—was ended by the middle of March, 2018, within two weeks of it hav-\ning been started.  \nGiven the small, discreet number of any similarly situated plaintiffs, joinder \nwould not be impractical, and in fact would be a more efficient method of administer-\ning this case. As a result, Appellants fail to satisfy the numerosity prerequisite of \nRule 23.    \n31 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 40 of 44 PageID #:243\nB. Appellants’ Purported Class Fails to Satisfy the Commonality and \nTypicality Requirements.  \nAppellants’ proposed class also fails to satisfy the commonality and typicality \nrequirements of Rule 23. The district court found that while a state courts likely do \nnot have the power to place the named Appellants in the Sheriff’s EHM program, “it \nis still questionable whether the [Appellants’] prolonged detentions were lawful or \nwhether their bond orders required their release.” App. 19, Mem. Op., Sept. 13, 2018, \np. A111. This Court went on to cite Harper v. Sheriff of Cook Cnty., 581 F.3d 511 (7th \nCir. 2009), which held that the constitutionality of an individual’s detention depends \non whether the length of the delay between the time the Sheriff was notified that \nbond had been posed and the time that the detainee was released was reasonable in \nany given case. Harper, 581 F.3d at 515. The Harper court held that this determina-\ntion was an individual issue, and that liability would need to be determined on an \nindividual basis. Id.  \nThe constitutionality of each Appellant’s detention is likewise an individual \nissue that should be determined on an individual basis. The administrative review \nconducted by the Sheriff sought to review the criminal backgrounds and pending \ncharges against each individual referred to the Sheriff’s EHM program to determine \nwhether each individual was suitable for such placement. App. 19, Third Am. Compl., \nEx. C “Letter from Sheriff Dart to Cnty. Bd. Pres., Toni Preckwinkle” at p. 2.  \nThe administrative review procedure was occasioned by bail reform which took \neffect in Cook County in September 2017, and which dramatically increased the num-\nber of pretrial defendants placed on the Sheriff’s EHM program from bond court. Id., \n32 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 41 of 44 PageID #:244\np. 1. The Sheriff’s policy was intended to mitigate any increased risks to public safety, \nand accounted for the resources available to the Sheriff to monitor these additional \nindividuals at any given time. Id., pp. 3-4.  \nThough the policy guiding the Sheriff was the same in the case of each named \nAppellant, the basis for the continued detention of each individual was determined \non a case by case basis, and included a review of each individual’s pending charges \nand criminal background. Though all of the named Appellants were initially denied \nplacement in the Sheriff’s EHM program, each of the Appellants have distinct pend-\ning charges and criminal backgrounds which made each individual uniquely unsuit-\nable for immediate placement in the Sheriff’s EHM program at the time their place-\nment was requested.  \nPublic records establish that each of the Appellants are charged with different \nviolent offenses, have extensive but distinct violent criminal history, and/or poses a \ndifferent level of threat to the community. For example, Taphia Williams is charged \nwith aggravated kidnapping (a Class X felony). Gregory Cooper was out on bond for \narmed robbery with a firearm (a class X felony punishable by 21-45 years in prison) \nwhen he was arrested on a new charge of delivery of Heroin within 1,000 feet of a \nschool (a class 1 felony). Marcus Johnson is charged with being a gang member in \npossession of a firearm (a class 2 felony), and at the time of his arrest was wanted for \nquestioning in a murder. Joshua Atwater is charged with aggravated kidnapping (a \nclass X felony) and aggravated criminal sexual assault (a class 2 felony). Tony Mason \nis charged with one count of armed habitual criminal and one count of delivery of \n33 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 42 of 44 PageID #:245\nbetween 100 and 400 grams of cocaine (both Class X felonies), after he was arrested \nand found in possession of over $1,100 in cash, multiple bags of crack cocaine, and a \n9mm handgun outfitted with an extended clip containing 29 live rounds and another \nin the chamber. And so on.   \nIn each individual case, the Sheriff’s determination as to whether to immedi-\nately place the Appellants on his EHM program was based on the nature of the pend-\ning charges against each Appellant, each Appellant’s unique criminal background, \nand the resources available to the Sheriff at the time the Appellants’ placement was \nrequested. Appellants failed to gain immediate placement because of those consider-\nations. Although each was ultimately released, the reasonableness of the Sheriff’s \nrefusal to immediately place each Appellant in his EHM program depends on an in-\ndividualized, case-by-case analysis. Apart from the fact that each of the Appellants \nwas refused immediate placement in the Sheriff’s EHM program, and in light of their \nunique criminal backgrounds, distinct pending charges, and different resources avail-\nable for their monitoring depending on the day, there is no commonality among the \nnamed Appellants, and no typicality between the named Appellants and the alleged \nclass members.  \nC. Appellants’ Counsel Has Not Demonstrated They Possess the Req-\nuisite Experience Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(A)(ii).  \nNo class should be certified in the first place, because Appellants have failed \nto satisfy all of the elements of Rule 23. Even if the Court found that Appellants did \nsatisfy the requirements of Rule 23, Appellants’ counsel have not demonstrated that \nthey should be designated class counsel. Though Appellants’ counsel in their Motion \n34 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-2 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 43 of 44 PageID #:246\nfor Class Certification cite to a Monell case they prosecuted, it is not apparent from \nthe Motion that either named counsel has any experience prosecuting a class action \ncase. The Sheriff requests that Appellants’ counsel describe all of their relevant ex-\nperience, and that the Court then make a determination as to the whether or not \nAppellants’ counsel should be designated class counsel.  \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendants request that this Court affirm the \ndistrict court’s decisions granting Defendant’s motion to dismiss and denying class \ncertification, and remand the case to the district court. \n  Respectfully submitted, \n \n  /s/ Richard Gleason \n  Counsel for the Defendants-Appellees \n \nRichard Gleason \nO’Mara Gleason O’Callaghan, LLC \n230 W.

With  resp~ct  to  the  delinquent  child,  the \nphilosophy  of  Juvenile  court  laws  is  that  the \njuvenile  is  to  be  con§idered  and  treated  not \nas  a  c~iminal,  but  as  a  person  requiring  care, \neducation,  and  protection.  fundamental  aim \nA \nof  juvenile  court  laws  is  the  prevention  of \ndelinquency  of  children.  Consequently,  such \nnot \nlaws  are  punitive,  but  are  corrective  and \nprotective  in  that  their  purpose  is  to  make \ngood  citizens  of  potentially  bad  ones.

Therefore,  no \njuvenile may  be  so  punished  except  those  being  proceeded  against  as \nadults. \nThus,  in determining  whether  juveniles  could  constitutionally \n• \nbe  housed  in  the  substandard  KCDC  facility,  the  court  protected \nthose  children  who  are  not  afforded  the  additional  procedural \nrights  available  to  adults.

Accordingly,  the \ncourt's  order  does  not  come  within  the  prisoner  release  order \nprovision  of  the  PLRA. \nTBR  COMMONWEALTH  DEPENDANTS'  MOTION  TO \nALTER  OR  AMEND  JUDGMENT  IS  DENIED \nDefendants  Paul  Patton,  Governor  of  the  Commonwealth  of \nKentucky  and  Doug  Sapp,  Commissioner  of  the  Kentucky  Department  of \nrai• se \ncorrections  (collectively  ''the  Commonwealth  defendants\") \ncourt's \nthree  contentions  in  their  motion  to  alter  or  amend  the \nI \n,  1996  findings  of  fact  and  conclusions  of  law. \nJuly  26\ncourt's \nFirst,  the  commonwealth  defendants  object  to  the \ncontending  that  the  County \n\"state''  officials, \nreferring  to \n•  ·  t  operate  the  detention  center. \nprimary  authority  o \nofficials  have \n12 \n• \n• • \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-3 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 14 of 17 PageID #:261\n• \nFor purposes  of  . \n1 \nc  arif ication,  the  court  notes \nthat  \"state\"  is used \nin  the  t· \nsec  ion  1983  sense  of  officials  acting  under  color  of  state \nlaw  and  this  included  the \nCommonwealth  defendant s  and  t he  County \ndefendants. \nIn  addition,  the  Commonwealth  defendants' \nobjection \ndoes \nnot  affect  the  court's  judgment  in  this  case. \nSecond, \nthe  Commonwealth  defendants  contend  that  the \nCommissioner  of  the  Kentucky  Department  of  Corrections  does  not \nnsupervisen  the  KCDC,  but  they  admit  that  the  Commissioner  has  the \nauthority  to  \"monitor\"  and  ''inspect''  the \nKCDC. \nThis  objection \nseems  to  be  a  simple  matter  of  semantics  and  does  not  require  any \naction  on  the  part  of  the  court.  During  the  telephone  conference \nconcerning  the  motions  to  alter or  amend  judgment,  counsel  for  the \nCommonwealth  defendants  indicated  that  she  was  concerned  about  the \nuse  of  the  word  ''supervise\"  because  such  supervision  may  have  an \neffect  on  liability  for  the  plaintiffs'  attorneys'  fees.

But except in a few states,  mass decarceration has not, so far,\nfollowed: By  *2 the end of 2014 (the last data available), nationwide prison population had shrunk only 3% off its (2009)\npeak. Jail population, similarly, was down just 5% from its (2008) peak. All told, our current incarceration rate--7 per 1,000\n3\npopulation--is the same as in 2002, and four times the level in 1970, when American incarceration rates began their rise.\nOur bloated prisoner population includes many groups of prisoners who are especially likely to face grievous harm in jail and\nprison. In particular, well over half of American prisoners have symptoms of mental illness. And the most recent thorough\nanalysis found that an astounding 15% of state prisoners and 24% of jail inmates “reported symptoms that met the criteria\n4 5\nfor a psychotic disorder.”  In addition, 4 to 10% prisoners have a serious intellectual disability.  Prisoners with  *3 mental\ndisabilities face grave difficulties in prison and jail; they can have trouble adapting to new requirements and understanding what\nis expected of them, getting along with others, and following institutional rules. In the absence of treatment and habilitation,\n6\nthey are more likely both to be victimized and to commit both minor and major misconduct.  Prisoners with mental disabilities\n7\nare not alone; there are other groups of prisoners who are similarly vulnerable-- prisoners with serious chronic illnesses  and\n8 9 10 11 12\nphysical disabilities,  gay and transgender prisoners,  juveniles in adult facilities,  elderly prisoners,  minor offenders,\nand so on. Each group faces higher-than-usual probabilities of victimization and harm behind bars.\n © 2020 Thomson Reuters.

Miami Race &...\nIn this symposium essay, I argue that when such difficulties are manifest, and create conditions of confinement that are illegal\nunder the Eighth Amendment, Americans with Disabilities Act, or other source of law, plaintiffs should seek, and courts should\ngrant, court-enforceable remedies diverting prisoners away from incarceration, in order to keep vulnerable populations out of\njail and prison.\nWhat's novel about this proposal is not the diversionary remedies themselves, but the connection of such programs to conditions\nof  *4 confinement litigation. Diversionary programs are, in fact, increasingly familiar. Reformers in many states have\nimplemented many different diversion methods. Some programs address prisoners with mental illness or intellectual disabilities\n13\nin particular;  others focus on other populations-- substance abusers, minor misdemeanant arrestees, veterans, etc. They\ninclude:\n• Crisis intervention teams of officers linked to community mental health services and trained and supported in\n14\nhelping individuals with mental illness.\n15\n• Deescalation techniques that avoid unnecessary arrests.\n• Substitution of citations for misdemeanor arrests.\n• Diversion--sometimes by use of mental health courts that send offenders with mental illness to intensive\ntreatment and supervision, but not jail or prison.\n• Wraparound services that provide “treatment, rehabilitation, supportive services, and practical help” for people\n16\nwith severe and persistent mental illness.\nAnd prompted by jail and prison crowding, states, cities, and counties have likewise developed a menu of other reforms, less\n17\nlinked to particular populations, that seek to decrease incarceration,  including:\n• Sentencing reform (replacing mandatory minimum sentences, limiting “three-strikes” coverage, reducing\nrecommended sentences, etc.).\n18\n• Shifts in policing enforcement priorities.\n*5 • Bail reform, including “walk-through” arrangements under which arrestees are immediately released on\nbond.\n © 2020 Thomson Reuters.

Miami Race &...\n• Parole reforms--improving risk-assessment processes, timeliness of hearings, and the tailoring of parole\n19\nrequirements to criminal histories.\n• Make earned and good-conduct reductions steeper, expand rehabilitation programs that offer sentencing\n20\ncredits.\nBut only rarely have such initiatives--which I label “anti-incarcerative”--been imposed or negotiated as court-enforceable\nsolutions for jail or prisons conditions problems. And when they have, it's mostly been to facilitate compliance with a court-\nordered population cap. What I'm urging is a new generation of anti-incarcerative remedies in conditions lawsuits, unconnected\nto a population order, whose purpose is to keep vulnerable would-be prisoners out of harm's way by promoting workable\nalternatives to incarceration.\nThis essay proceeds as follows. In Part I, I describe the history of population caps in conditions of confinement lawsuits. These\nkinds of direct population limits--still available and valuable, in the right case--constituted a first generation of decarcerative\nconditions orders. They are important both historically and because they demonstrate that ordinary remedial law allows court\norders that keep prisoners out of prison in order to avoid constitutional problems inside. I next highlight in Part II a few\npioneering court orders that have specified anti-incarcerative remedies, hooked to alleged or proven unconstitutional conditions\ncaused by crowding. Like the population caps, these orders have aimed explicitly at population reduction.\nI move in Parts III and IV to two models for anti-incarcerative orders that are not premised on crowding. In Part III, I examine\nrecent remedies addressing unconstitutional solitary confinement. Many of these recent orders have not simply barred prisons\nfrom imposing the solitary conditions plaintiffs allege are unconstitutional. Rather, they establish and regulate alternatives to\nsolitary confinement. A final useful model,  *6 which I examine in Part IV, can be found in ongoing deinstitutionalization\n21\nremedies in cases, on the model of Olmstead v. L.C,  that enforce the Americans with Disabilities Act, which have focused\nmore on provision of services in the community than on institutional exclusions. The orders in both Parts III and IV support\nmy contention that the ordinary law of remedies allows entry of orders keeping prisoners out of a situation in which they would\nface unconstitutional harm.\nFinally, in Part V, I explain why the Prison Litigation Reform Act's constraints on “prisoner release orders” should not obstruct\na new generation of anti-incarcerative orders. The short answer is that--like solitary confinement and Olmstead orders--the\nanti-incarcerative orders I am advocating should not be considered “prisoner release orders” because they are not “reducing or\nlimiting the prison population,” in the way that Congress intended the PLRA to regulate.\nOur national infatuation with incarceration has led to the damaging imprisonment of many vulnerable people in jails and prisons\nill-equipped to house them safely--people with mental and physical disabilities, juveniles, the elderly, minor offenders, and\nothers. When a particular facility or system is unable to provide these prisoners with lawful conditions of confinement, plaintiffs\n22\nshould seek, and federal courts should grant, anti-incarcerative orders that facilitate alternatives.\nI. POPULATION CAPS OVER TIME\n © 2020 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 3\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-5 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 5 of 26 PageID #:278\nBerkowsky, Danielle 4/4/2020\nFor Educational Use Only\nANTI-INCARCERATIVE REMEDIES FOR ILLEGAL..., 6 U. Miami Race &...\n23\nIn the first 25 years of jail and prison conditions-of-confinement litigation,  population caps were commonplace court-ordered\n24\nremedies  *7 for unconstitutional conditions of confinement.  When crowding created or exacerbated unsafe conditions\nbehind bars, these orders attacked the problem by specifying the number of prisoners allowed to be housed, or setting per-\nprisoner space requirements (which works out to the same thing, absent construction), or designating a permissible percentage\nof some measure of capacity. They established various kinds of release mechanisms and procedures, to be used as needed to\nmeet the caps.\nBut federal court-ordered population caps came under increasing attack. The Supreme Court was skeptical nearly from the\nstart, emphasizing in 1979 (in Bell v. Wolfish) and again in 1981 (in Rhodes v. Chapman) that crowding alone--in particular,\ndouble celling (housing two prisoners in a cell meant for one by substituting a bunk bed for the planned single bed)--did\n25\nnot constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  The Court emphasized that “deprivations of essential food, medical care or\n26\nsanitation,” “increase[d] violence,” or other “intolerable” conditions were, rather, what the Constitution forbids.  Crowding\nwas unconstitutional, the Court insisted, only if it caused these kinds of conditions. (The Court emphasized the point in Wilson\nv. Seiter, holding that plaintiffs in Eighth Amendment challenges to prison conditions must identify particular “deprivation[s]\nof ... identifiable human need[s] such as food, warmth, or exercise”; “[n]othing so amorphous as ‘overall conditions' can rise to\n27\nthe level of cruel and unusual punishment when no specific deprivation of a single human need exists.” )\nBell and Rhodes challenged but did not end population orders; caps continued to be entered in conditions of confinement cases\naddressing health, safety, sanitation, nutrition, and the like, for pretrial detainees and convicted offenders in jails and prisons.\nThe theory was simple: when overpopulation of a prison stressed its capacity to safely house inmates, a *8 population cap was\none appropriate tool to restore constitutional conditions of confinement. On that theory, court-ordered caps governed Louisiana's\n28\nprison system from 1983 to 1996; Florida's from 1977 to 1992, and Texas's from 1981 to 2001.  Many more such orders were\n29\noperative in jail systems and individual prisons across the nation.\nDefendants--sheriffs, wardens, corrections heads--frequently agreed to population orders, which empowered them in varied\nways in their particular political milieus. But many law enforcement actors objected strenuously to the caps. When prosecutors\nin Philadelphia argued that the cap on Philadelphia's jail system led to thousands of releases and caused thousands of new\n30\ncrimes, that cap, in Harris v. City of Philadelphia, became the cause célèbre  for the sponsors of the Prison Litigation Reform\n31 32\nAct (PLRA).  The PLRA, passed in 1996 as part of the Newt Gingrich Contract with America,  imposed numerous high\n33\nsubstantive and procedural hurdles to the entry of new population caps.  The new statutory obstacles to population caps are\n34\nnot, it should  *9 be emphasized, insurmountable.  Even after the PLRA's enactment, population caps have been entered in\n35 36\nboth jail and prison cases, in settlements,  orders contested by intervenors,  and litigated orders (including the statewide\n37 38\nCalifornia order upheld on appeal to the Supreme Court).  But the incidence of caps has declined precipitously.\nII. SOME PIONEERING ANTI-INCARCERATIVE ORDERS\nIn a few conditions cases addressing crowding, court orders have mandated--in addition to or instead of population caps--both\n39\nprocesses for developing anti-incarcerative remedies and substantive anti-incarcerative terms.  In this part, I develop insights\nstemming from five cases that challenged conditions of confinement and led to anti-incarcerative remedies. They are Carruthers\n40\nv. Israel, a case filed in 1976 that addresses conditions at the Broward County Jail, in Fort  *10 Lauderdale, Florida; Carty\n41\nv. Mapp,  filed in 1994 and still reforming the Virgin Islands' Criminal Justice Complex, in St. Thomas; McClendon v. City\n42\nof Albuquerque,  filed in 1995 against both city and county officials responsible for conditions in Albuquerque's jail; Maynor\n © 2020 Thomson Reuters.

Miami Race &...\n43\nv. Morgan County, a case filed in 2001 about conditions at a small jail in Decatur, Alabama;  and the consolidated cases of\n44\nPlata v. Brown and Coleman v. Brown,  the California prison litigations whose population cap the Supreme Court approved\n45\nin 2011.\nA. Procedural (planning) anti-incarcerative orders\nThe most common anti-incarcerative remedies are procedural and indirect--courts require defendants to convene multiple\ncriminal justice stakeholders and to develop a plan (or, even less muscular, to try to develop a plan) that will decrease the\npopulation in the challenged facility. For example, orders entered in 1994 and 2013 in Carty, the Virgin Islands jail case, required\nthe defendants to “actively manage their prisoner population, including seeking pretrial detention alternatives and reduced\n46\nbails.”  Similarly, defendants were instructed in the latter order to “develop[] and implement [] memoranda of understanding\nto ensure timely transfers of seriously mentally ill prisoners in need of inpatient or intermediate care, or those in need of acute\n47\nstabilization, to an appropriate hospital or mental health facility.”  (More definitely, the *11 order required the defendants--\nwhich included the governmental entity for which the prosecutors worked to “offer [] sentences of time served for prisoners\n48\ncharged with misdemeanor and non-violent offenses.” )\nMore formally, in Maynor, the comprehensive challenge to conditions of confinement in an Alabama jail in Decatur Alabama,\na settlement agreement reached after the Court granted a preliminary injunction included the following requirement of an anti-\nincarceration “task force”:\nRecognizing that overcrowding at the Jail affects all aspects of Jail operations, the County Defendants agree to organize\na local task force to identify and review alternative programs and methods for reducing the Jail population and to make\nrecommendations regarding the implementation of such programs and methods. The task force shall include, but is not limited\nto the following officers, if they agree to serve: the sheriff; one or more members of the County Commission; the presiding\ncircuit court judge; the district attorney; the county attorney; a criminal defense attorney; a representative from probation;\nand at least two community representatives. The task force shall diligently investigate and explore alternative methods for\nreducing the Jail population, including the creation of a Community Corrections and Punishment Program, as provided for in\n§ 15-18-170, et seq., Code of Alabama, 1975; the expansion and development of one or more work release programs as now\nor hereafter authorized by law; the diversion of inmates to other institutions with available bed space; the release of inmates on\ntheir personal recognizance; and other alternative means of securing their attendance through such other means and methods\nas may be available. In reviewing the possible alternatives for preventing overcrowding at the Jail, the task force will consult\nwith the Alabama Association of Community Corrections. County Defendants will report to Plaintiffs' counsel each September\n15 and March 15, and through other regular communications, regarding local efforts by the task force and others to prevent\n49\novercrowding at the Jail.\nThis was an entirely procedural order: it encouraged and facilitated, rather than requiring, anti-incarcerative measures.\nCompliance was slow, but the task force proposed a community corrections program that finally got started five years after the\n50 51\nsettlement, in 2006,  and that continues to operate today.\n*12 In a few cases, courts have brought in outside experts to assist or lead anti-incarcerative planning. For example, in the\nBroward County case, renewed crowding many years after initial litigation and settlement led the court in 2010 to appoint a\n“population management expert pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 706,” requiring him to “identif[y] and analyze[] the County's criminal\njustice processes and policies that affect the population level at the Broward County jail,” “develop[] strategies and remedies\nto address those processes and policies so that the population level ... can be reduced without significantly affecting public\n © 2020 Thomson Reuters.

Miami Race &...\nsafety,” and “identif[y] realistic options that have been successfully implemented in other jurisdictions that will reduce the\n52\nneed for current and future beds--especially for the pretrial felon population.”  The expert's most recent report, completed\nin 2014, recommends a series of anti-incarcerative reforms, which could reduce jail population by about 20%. They include:\n53\nfiling criminal charges more promptly for people in jail;  a supervised release program for those unable to make their very\nlow bails; allowing release on bail for some minor offenders currently barred from pretrial release; a community-supervision\nreentry program; community-based treatment for inmates with alcohol and drug treatment requirements; community-based\nmental health services for inmates declared incompetent to stand trial; and work release for inmates nearing the end of their\n54\nsentences.  (It does not appear that the plaintiffs are pressing to make this plan court enforceable; they have the population\n55 56\n*13 cap already,  and these reforms are framed as ways to effectuate the cap, not as independent remedies. )\nSimilarly, in the Virgin Islands case, the Court appointed an expert--the same expert, as it happens--to conduct an assessment\nthat:\n(1) analyzes the Territory's criminal justice processes and policies that affect the population level at the Criminal Justice Complex\n(CJC) and CJC Annex [collectively, “the Jail”],\n(2) includes strategies and remedies to address those processes and policies so that the population level at the Jail can be reduced\nwithout significantly affecting public safety,\n(3) includes a baseline population forecast that would advise the territory on the impact of current criminal justice trends,\n(4) identifies realistic options that have been successfully implemented in other jurisdictions that will reduce the need for future\nbeds, and\n(5) assesses the existing classification and disciplinary systems at the Jail and provides technical assistance to Defendants so\n57\nthey can make the best use of existing bed space to safely and appropriately house the prisoner population.\n58\nAfter much litigation, the report is now underway.\n*14B. Substantive anti-incarcerative orders\nWhen a federal court insists on a robust anti-incarcerative planning process, that improves the probability of a plan's development\nand even implementation. But occasionally, courts have gone further and imposed actual substantive anti-incarcerative remedies.\nThe best-known example is in Plata v. Brown and Coleman v. Brown, the medical care and mental health care cases against the\nCalifornia prison system in which the District Court imposed, and the Supreme Court affirmed, a state-wide prison population\n59\ncap of 137.5% of design capacity.  On remand from the Supreme Court, the state made substantial progress towards this\npopulation cap by means of shifting some prison population to jails, lessening the term of probation, and several other policy\n60\nchanges, together termed criminal justice “Realignment.”  But population remained well over the limit until the District Court\nimposed several anti-incarcerative measures, including allowing several groups of inmates to more quickly accrue time off\n61\ntheir sentences, and expanding parole for non-violent offenders, and medically incapacitated and elderly prisoners.  Each was\n62\nmade a fully enforceable court order.\n63\nLess well known, but similarly joining a population cap  with anti-incarcerative orders is McClendon v. City of Albuquerque.\nMcClendon*15 began in 1995 when inmates at the Bernalillo County Detention Center in Albuquerque filed a class action\n © 2020 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-5 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 8 of 26 PageID #:281\nBerkowsky, Danielle 4/4/2020\nFor Educational Use Only\nANTI-INCARCERATIVE REMEDIES FOR ILLEGAL..., 6 U. Miami Race &...\nlawsuit alleging unconstitutional conditions of confinement caused by gross overcrowding. A subclass of inmates with mental\n64\ndisabilities was also declared, and separately represented.  In 1996, the court in McClendon entered a settlement agreement\n65\nthat included a procedural planning order.  But it also directly required the substantive anti-incarcerative remedy of civil\ncommitment in circumstances where the defendants had sufficient authority to implement it without needing anyone else's\nagreement:\nDefendants shall instruct UNMHSC [the University of New Mexico Health Services Center] to establish formal policies and\nprocedures requiring the initiation of civil commitment proceedings whenever an individual diagnosed as having a mental\nor developmental disorder requests placement in a residential treatment or evaluation facility, assuming the court imposed\nconditions of confinement are consistent with such placement .... Residents shall be released for day treatment or habilitation\n66\nwhenever appropriate.\nWhen plaintiffs sought contempt sanctions in 2001 for noncompliance with the earlier settlement, litigation again led to a\ncombination of procedural and substantive anti-incarcerative settlement provisions. A stipulated order explained that many\ndiversionary strategies were going untried in Albuquerque: for example, “Increased intensive mental health case management,\ncrisis housing, and detox services, as well as a drop-in center for psycho-social rehabilitation, would reduce overcrowding at\n67\nthe jail.”  The order accordingly required  *16 four different planning sessions to bring together the various official and\nadvocacy stakeholders to develop various anti-incarcerative approaches (“how to reduce the number of incarcerated individuals\nat BCDC who are awaiting resolution of probation or parole violation proceedings”; “how to include persons who do not have\nboth a permanent address and a telephone in the Community Custody Program”; “how to implement an effective jail diversion\nprogram for persons with psychiatric or developmental disabilities”; and “how to expand the program for early resolution of\n68\ncriminal cases” ).\nFor each of the above plans, the cooperation of out-of-court parties was needed. By contrast, the defendants had unilateral\nauthority with respect to policing. Accordingly, the same 2001 order included a more muscular substantive requirement, as\nwell. The parties stipulated that:\nDespite the efforts to date of the parties and the Court, 244 persons were brought into the jail by arresting officers in the month\nof March, 2001 and booked on petty misdemeanors, including, inter alia, shoplifting under $100, excessive sun screen material\non vehicle windows, and unreasonable noise. Issuing citations for such non-violent petty offenses and using the jail's ‘walk\n69\nthrough procedure’ for persons charged with such offenses would likely reduce unnecessary incarceration at BCDC.”\nAccordingly, defendants agreed to entry of an order requiring them to “[p]rovide direction to law enforcement officials under the\ncontrol of the City and/or the County to issue citations where appropriate and to use the ‘walk through procedures,’ rather than\n70\nincarcerating individuals, where appropriate.”  This set of requirements was strengthened in 2002, when the City Defendants\n71\nentered into another stipulated order, that: “Defendants will continue to employ all existing population management tools.”\nThose “population management tools,” included the “[p]re-trial services walk-through for misdemeanor warrants” described in\n72\n2001.  Other approaches were also added. For example, “APD officers have been instructed to obtain every possible phone\nnumber from people they stop and arrest or cite and release, and to write the phone number(s) on the face of the arresting/\n73\nciting document.”  Subsequent litigation *17 included various similar orders; the most recent settlement, reached in March\n2016, collects and augments the scattered relevant provisions and sets them out again, with a requirement that a court-appointed\n74\nexpert audit.\n © 2020 Thomson Reuters.

Miami Race &...\nIn sum, while anti-incarcerative orders have been very rare, they are not unheard of. Courts have entered both procedural\norders mandating informal or formal anti-incarcerative planning, and substantive orders mandating particular anti-incarcerative\nprograms.\nIII. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT ORDERS\nAs population caps have gone from routine to rare, a new type of order regulating particular types of incarceration--and barring\nparticular types of prisoners from it--has developed. As American incarceration rates ballooned in the 1980s and 1990s, so too\ndid our prisons' and jails' use of solitary confinement and other forms of restrictive housing. Increasing thousands of prisoners\nwere confined to 22 or more daily hours of in-cell lockdown, with minimal chance for social interaction, programming, or\n75\noccupation.  Advocacy efforts to reverse this trend have been intense and longstanding, and seem finally to be approaching\nfruition. President Obama recently wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post describing current practices as “an affront to\n76\nour common humanity,”  and three Supreme Court justices have inveighed against solitary confinement in recent separate\n77\nwriting.  Many corrections leaders are themselves beginning to seek change: the national association of heads of state\ncorrections departments last year released a report that begins “Prolonged isolation of individuals in jails and prisons is a grave\nproblem drawing national attention and concern,” and explicitly  *18 “supports ongoing efforts to ... limit or end extended\n78\nisolation.”  Litigation continues to be a key lever for reform in this area; lawsuits push for change, and both settlements and\n79\nlitigated orders have modeled what that change could look like.\nMuch of the solitary reform effort has followed a “special populations” strategy. The idea has been to exclude from solitary\nconfinement--entirely, or in all but the most exceptional circumstances--prisoners particularly vulnerable to harm there. This\npath was marked by District Judge Thelton Henderson in Madrid v. Gomez, in 1995. In that case, Judge Henderson explained\nthat isolated conditions “will likely inflict some degree of psychological trauma upon most inmates confined [in Pelican Bay's\nSpecial Housing Unit, or SHU] for more than brief periods.” But, he held, only for “certain categories of inmates” was the likely\nharm sufficiently severe to constitute a “per se violat[ion]” of the Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause:\nthose who the record demonstrates are at a particularly high risk for suffering very serious or severe injury to\ntheir mental health, including overt paranoia, psychotic breaks with reality, or massive exacerbations of existing\nmental illness as a result of the conditions in the SHU. Such inmates consist of the already mentally ill, as well as\npersons with borderline personality disorders, brain damage or mental retardation, impulse-ridden personalities,\nor a history of prior psychiatric problems or chronic depression. For these inmates, placing them in the SHU is\n80\nthe mental equivalent of putting an asthmatic in a place with little air to breathe.\nFollowing Judge Henderson's approach, in case after case, plaintiffs' counsel have sought--and often won, by litigated or\n81\nsettled judgment--orders excluding prisoners in vulnerable categories like these from solitary confinement.  More recent court\norders have covered not just  *19 prisoners with mental illness and intellectual disabilities but other vulnerable populations:\n82\npregnant and youthful prisoners, for example.  (Only recently, in two settlements approved in 2016, has litigation more\n83\ncomprehensively narrowed the path into and widened the path out of solitary confinement. )\nThe special population orders have included simple bans. For example, in Wisconsin, first in a 2001 contested preliminary\n84\ninjunction,  and then in a 2002 settlement, prisoners with serious mental illness were barred from the Boscobel supermax\nprison: “No seriously mentally ill prisoners win be sent to SMCI nor will seriously mentally ill prisoners at the facility be\n © 2020 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-5 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 10 of 26 PageID #:283\nBerkowsky, Danielle 4/4/2020\nFor Educational Use Only\nANTI-INCARCERATIVE REMEDIES FOR ILLEGAL..., 6 U. Miami Race &...\n85\npermitted to remain there.”  Similarly, in Mississippi, a settlement stated flatly: “After December 1, 2007, Unit 32 will not\n86\nbe used for long-term housing of prisoners with Severe Mental Illness, other  *20 than those on Death Row.”  Another\nMississippi settlement, dealing with a private facility, stated in 2012, “MDOC will ensure that youth are never subjected to\n87\nsolitary confinement.”  And in Indiana, following a court finding of unconstitutionality caused by the solitary confinement\nof prisoners with serious mental illness, a 2016 settlement provided, “no seriously mentally ill prisoners shall be placed in\nsegregation/restrictive housing (including protective custody) if they are known to be seriously mentally ill prior to such\n88\nplacement.”\nThinking of solitary confinement units as “prisons within a prison,” these exclusion orders are analogous to the first-\n89\ngeneration prison population caps described in Part I:  they exclude people by way of negative commands. In addition, some\nsolitary confinement orders--including some very recent ones that benefit prisoner plaintiffs beyond particularly vulnerable\npopulations-- take a more affirmative approach. They (1) establish or regulate housing that substitutes for solitary confinement;\nand they set out parameters for a variety of programs and procedures intended to (2) slow and narrow the path in, and (3) broaden\nand speed the path out. While these are useful interventions in their own right, I offer the details here to make an argument, by\nanalogy, that structurally similar kinds of orders could be used to keep people with serious mental illness out of prison altogether.\nEach of these approaches fits comfortably into the permissible scope of injunctive remedies in civil rights cases. Caselaw dictates\n90 91\nthat litigated injunctions--and settlements, in prison and jail cases --be tied to *21 plaintiffs' injury,  but allows design of\n92 93\nsuch remedies not just to stop unlawful conduct and repair the damage done  but to prevent further violations going forward\n94\n(as well as to facilitate oversight and enforcement of the more substantive terms ). Anti-incarcerative orders prevent further\nviolations going forward.\nA. Court orders or settlement provisions establishing alternatives to solitary confinement\nRecent court orders in cases challenging the conditions of confinement in solitary have led to variously-named alternatives--\nsecure housing in which prisoners receive therapeutic programming and substantial out-of-cell time. For example, a 2016 court\norder decrees Indiana's use of “mental health units” with additional therapeutic programming, group therapy, and other out-of-\n95\ncell opportunities. *22 Recent landmark cases have extended this approach beyond prisoners with mental illness: a 2015\nsettlement in New York requires the creation of residential substance-abuse programs as “SHU-alternative[s] “for ... inmates\nselected ... who are serving confinement sanctions for nonviolent substance abuse-related misbehavior,” and other alternatives\n96\nfor youthful prisoners and those who have intellectual disabilities.  And in California, a 2016 consent decree requires use of\n97\na “restrictive custody general population housing unit” for members of gangs, as well as others.\nB. Court orders or provisions narrowing/slowing the path into solitary confinement\nCourt orders in solitary confinement cases use a variety of techniques to narrow or slow prisoners' path into solitary confinement.\nThey implement mental health treatment, to avoid the need. In the Virgin Islands, for example, a 2012 order requires “[m]ental\nhealth care and treatment, including ... (ii) adequate mental health programs for all prisoners with serious mental illness; ...\nand (v) ceasing to place seriously mentally ill prisoners in segregated housing or lock-down as a substitute for mental health\n98\ntreatment.”  They substitute other approaches to prison discipline. So in Mississippi, in 2012: “MDOC will develop a behavior\n99\nmanagement policy that incorporates positive behavior intervention and supports for youth.”  They moderate the sanctions\napplicable to various kinds of misconduct. In New York, under a 2015 consent decree, only the most serious misconduct can lead\n © 2020 Thomson Reuters.

Miami Race &...\n100\nto a term in solitary. ) And they centralize decisionmaking, to undercut the ability of dissenting officials to stymie reform.\nIn a 2007 Mississippi consent decree, for example,\nThe process for admission to and release from administrative segregation will be centralized. A Warden who wishes to\nrecommend that an inmate be housed in administrative segregation must submit to  *23 the Central Classification Office\nfor review a referral form documenting the reason for the referral. If the Central Classification Office agrees with the\n101\nrecommendation, it will forward the referral form to the Commissioner or his designee for final review and approval.\nC. Court orders or settlement provisions broadening/speeding the path out of solitary confinement\nFinally, settlements in solitary confinement conditions cases have opened or eased prisoners' route out of solitary. Cases have\n102\nset up review processes, both retrospective (to clear out some of the existing population)  and prospective, to speed future\n103\nreleases.  And they have implemented “step-down” programs and housing units, “with the aim of returning inmates who\n104\nsuccessfully complete the program back to general population.”\nIV. OLMSTEAD ORDERS (MODERN DEINSTITUTIONALIZATION)\nI move in this Part to a third and final analogy to the anti-incarcerative orders I am urging. In 1999, the Supreme Court held\n105\nin Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring  that unjustified institutionalization of people with disabilities violates the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act (ADA). The Court explained that “unjustified institutional isolation of persons with disabilities is a form\nof discrimination,” because it “perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of\nparticipating in community life” and it “severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, including family relations,\n106\nsocial contacts, work options, economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment.”\nIn the years since the Olmstead decision, advocates have brought a wave of deinstitutionalization litigation to enforce it. As\nProfessor Sam Bagenstos explains, deinstitutionalization advocates have used litigation implementing the Olmstead approach\nto work towards “the twin goals of ... enabling people with disabilities to move out of institutional  *24 settings and\n107\npromoting high-quality community services.”  Since 2000, the population in large institutions for people with intellectual/\n108\ndevelopmental disabilities is down over a third;  the number of residents in state and county mental hospitals is down about\n109\na quarter.  Olmstead orders are far from the only driver of this population decline, but they have contributed by setting\nout “extensive and detailed provisions governing the types of services the states must provide in the community to those who\nhave been institutionalized or are at risk of institutionalization, the number of individuals who must receive those services, and\n110\ntimetables specifying when those services must be provided.”\nUnder Olmstead, the ADA doesn't require states to provide services to people with disabilities, but it does require that when\nservices are provided, the setting be as integrated as practicable. In keeping with this integration insight, Olmstead orders are\ntypically not exclusionary. That is, they bolster the alternatives to institutions, rather than barring admission to the large facilities\nthat used to dominate service provision. For example, in United States v. Delaware, the 26-page settlement between the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice and the state of Delaware provided for statewide crisis services to “[p]rovide timely and accessible\n111\nsupport to individuals with mental illness experiencing a behavioral health crisis, including a crisis due to substance abuse.”\nIt detailed numerous items that would form a “continuum of support services intended to meet the varying needs of individuals\nwith mental illness,” including Assertive Community Treatment teams--multidisciplinary groups including a psychiatrist, a\nnurse, a psychologist, a social worker, a substance abuse specialist, a vocational rehabilitation specialist and a  *25 peer\n © 2020 Thomson Reuters.

Miami Race &...\nspecialist--to “deliver comprehensive, individualized, and flexible support, services, and rehabilitation to individuals in their\n112\nhome and communities,”  and various kinds of case management. And it provided for supported housing (“an array of\nsupportive services that vary according to people's changing needs and promote housing stability”) and employment (“integrated\nopportunities for people to earn a living or to develop academic or functional skills”). Other Olmstead decrees contain similar\n113\nprovisions.\nAs with Part II's solitary confinement orders, these Olmstead orders are offered here in support of an analogy, as useful models\nfor conditions of confinement litigation. They remind us, structurally, that to solve a problem inside an institution it may be\nnecessary to direct enforcement effort outside. In addition, they can serve as “go by's” for the design and drafting of key elements\nof crisis intervention and other anti-carcerative approaches.\nV. THE PLRA'S PRISONER RELEASE ORDER PROVISION\nSo far in this essay, I've tried to demonstrate that anti-incarcerative orders would be a useful remedy for unlawful conditions\nof confinement, and that several types of analogous remedies are ready models for them. But, you should be asking (as always\n114\nin jail and prison litigation) what about the Prison Litigation Reform Act? Does it stand in the way? As Part I describes,\npopulation caps have since 1996 been tightly regulated by the Prison Litigation Reform Act--hence their sharp recent decline.\nAll new court orders in prison and jail conditions cases are constrained by the PLRA's requirements of demonstrated need\n115\nand narrow tailoring.  But are anti-incarcerative orders subject to the PLRA's particularly sharp “prisoner release order”\nconstraints? In this Part, I argue that they are not.\nThe PLRA sets several onerous prerequisites for entry of “a prisoner release order,” even on consent. Such an order is not\n116\nallowed “unless” a prior order “for less intrusive relief ... has failed,”  “crowding is the primary cause of the violation of\n117\na Federal right; and ... no other relief will remedy the violation of the Federal right.”  Even then, only a  *26 specially\n118\nconvened three-judge panel can enter the order.  What counts as a “prisoner release order”? The statute defines the term to\n“include[] any order, including a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunctive relief, that has the purpose or effect of\n119\nreducing or limiting the prison population, or that directs the release from or nonadmission of prisoners to a prison.”  Do anti-\nincarcerative remedies designed to keep vulnerable populations out of jail and prison fit this definition? I think the answer is no.\nIn a particular case, anti-incarcerative remedies could have the “purpose ... of reducing or limiting the prison population.”\nIndeed, in several of the cases highlighted in Part II, they do have that purpose. Consider for example, the Virgin Islands case\nmentioned in Part II. Recently the plaintiffs explained the basis of what they labeled the “population reduction remedy”:\nThis population reduction remedy is foundational; compliance with it makes it easier to reach compliance with all other\nsubstantive provisions of the Agreement. The fewer prisoners there are at the Jail, the easier it is to supervise them appropriately,\nto house them safely, to separate known enemies, and to provide them with all services required under the Agreement. The fewer\nseriously mentally ill prisoners who are housed at the Jail, the easier it is to adequately treat and safely house the remaining\n120\nmentally ill prisoner population.\nIn this particular case, the point of the remedies in question is to assist in implementing a long-standing population cap.\nBut in this essay, I've been arguing for anti-incarcerative remedies with a quite different goal--a purpose not of population\nreduction but population protection, minimizing the admission to prison or jail of particularly vulnerable would-be prisoners--\npeople with disabilities, the young, the old, non-violent offenders, LGBT people, etc. The success or failure of the anti-\n © 2020 Thomson Reuters.

Miami Race &...\nincarcerative order would not turn on the affected jail or prison's population count. Such programs don't dictate who can or\ncannot be admitted to prison, and an anti-incarcerative order that imposes them would not be violated if a facility's population\ngrows. Accordingly, I think it would be a stretch to consider this kind of order, with this kind of purpose, a PLRA-covered\n“prisoner release order.”\nTextually, such an order clearly lacks the “purpose ... of reducing or limiting the prison population.” And it does not “direct[] the\nrelease from or nonadmission of prisoners to a prison.” The textual question thus *27 comes down to whether anti-incarcerative\norders with a non-population-reduction purpose should nonetheless be deemed to have the “effect of reducing or limiting the\nprison population”--if, in fact, such a reduction takes place, which it might or might not. As I now develop, I think it's implausible\nto read the statutory word “effect” to reach so broadly; Congress's evident purpose for the “prisoner release order” provision\nwas to cover population caps and orders that function like population caps. And the kind of broad reading of “effect” that would\nencompass anti-incarcerative orders would similarly sweep in orders that are even farther away from Congress's concerns.\nThe legislative history of the PLRA is fairly sparse: the statute was passed after just one hearing. Nonetheless, it sheds real light\non Congress's intent. The prisoner release order provision was mentioned quite a few times-- throughout that one hearing, in the\nonly committee report, and on the floor of the House and Senate. Each and every time, both the bill's supporters and its opponents\nmake clear that the targets of the provision were jail and prison population caps and orders--for example, requirements to hold\nvacant a particular percentage of cells--functioned, like population caps, to compel the release or non-admission of prisoners.\nFor example,\n121\n• The House Committee report noted: “Population caps are a primary cause of ‘revolving door justice.”’\n• Congressman Bill McCullom, when he began debate on the bill that became the PLRA: “[F]ew problems have\ncontributed more to the revolving door of justice than Federal court-imposed prison population caps. Cities across\n122\nthe United States are being forced to put up with predators on their streets because of this judicial activism.”\n• Congressman Charles Canady, as he spoke in support of the bill: “it will make clear that imposing a prison or\n123\njail population cap should absolutely be a last resort”\n• Congressman Bill Young, in the same debate: the bill “prevents judges from placing arbitrary caps on prison\n124\npopulations.”\n• Senator Orrin Hatch, in his prepared statement opening the only Senate hearing on the PLRA: “Prison population\ncaps, which result in revolving door justice and the commission of untold  *28 numbers of preventable crimes,\n125\nshould be the absolute last resort.”\n• Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, at the same hearing, explained that her motivation for drafting the prisoner release\norder provision, was the murder of a friend of hers: “The murderer was on early release because of a case, the\n © 2020 Thomson Reuters.

Miami Race &...\n126\nRuiz case in Texas, that requires us to release prisoners if we go above an 11-percent vacancy rate.”  Therefore,\n“[m]y bill also provides that the courts not impose limits or reduction in prison population unless the plaintiff\n127\nproves that overcrowding is the primary problem and there is no other solution available.”\n• And, at the same hearing, former Attorney General William Barr testified in favor of the bill: “Even more\n128\ntroublesome ... is many decrees impose quite arbitrary population caps and space requirements”\nThese quotes (and I could triple their number without changing their content) evidence Congress's clear goal for the statutory\nlanguage it chose. “Purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison population” is language intended to reach both explicit\npopulation caps and requirements--about space per prisoner or cell vacancy rate--that are population caps in effect. Population\ncaps do precisely what Congress forbids: they either “reduc[e] or limit[] the prison population.” And Congress's skepticism\nabout population caps explains the PLRA's “purpose or effect” language, too. That language is necessary to keep parties or\njudges from evading the statutory hurdles by entering an order, like a per-prisoner space requirement or an order requiring a\npercentage of empty cells, that functions like--but isn't quite--a population cap.\nBut there is absolutely nothing in the PLRA's legislative history to suggest that Congress's “prisoner release order” language\nwas trying to target the kinds of anti-incarcerative remedies featured here--which lead to non-incarcerative outcomes for some\npeople, but do not release or bar incarceration for anyone and do not require a decrease in jail or prison population. Indeed, a\nreading of “effect of reducing or limiting the prison population” that is broad enough to cover the kinds of remedies canvassed\nhere--mental health diversionary practices, for example--would sweep in court orders far indeed from Congress's concerns.\nImagine, for example, that a case alleging discrimination against some  *29 classes of prisoners (say, women or members\nof a particular race) results in an order equalizing plaintiffs' access to rehabilitative programming. Those new programming\nopportunities could well lead to earlier release of some prisoners, who are newly able to accrue sentencing credits, or newly\nattractive to parole boards. But surely that effect would not make the programming order a PLRA-limited “prisoner release\norder.” Similarly, a court order in a due process case that regulates prison disciplinary hearings and causes fewer misconduct\nfindings will similarly lead to the earlier release of some prisoners. Yet, again, it would extend the PLRA's restrictions far past\nCongress's intent to therefore consider such an order a “prisoner release order.”\nThus it makes the most sense to conclude that when anti-incarcerative orders are about protection, not about population, they\nlack the “purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison population.” Accordingly, like all court orders in jail and prison\n129\nconditions cases, they may be entered only if they comply with the PLRA's ordinary requirements for entry of relief.  But\nthe higher hurdles for “prisoner release orders” have no application.\nCONCLUSION\nWhen prisons and jails fail to comply with the laws that regulate them--when conditions of confinement violate prisoners' rights\nunder the Eighth Amendment or the Americans with Disabilities Act, or some other legal provision--one solution would be\nto keep people particularly vulnerable to those violations out of harm's way, out of prison. Anti-incarcerative measures have\ngained track records in a variety of nonlitigation settings. They deserve a more prominent place in the remedial toolbox for\nconditions of confinement litigation as well.\n © 2020 Thomson Reuters.

L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999).\n22\nIn an intriguing article, Professor Alex Reinert has made a quite different argument, but one that might sometimes\nlead to a similar outcome; he urges that conditions of confinement doctrine embrace a principle of proportionality,\nunder which certain “conditions could be constitutionally imposed as punishment for some classes of prisoners, but\nnot constitutionally imposed on a different class of prisoner, either because of their crime of incarceration or particular\ncharacteristics.” Alexander A.

The PLRA eliminated the authority of a single district judge to enter a population order, instead\nrequiring convening of a three-judge district court. It expanded intervention rights to criminal justice stakeholders\nlikely to object to an order. It disallowed population orders as a first-try remedy, allowing them only if a prior, less\nintrusive order “has failed to remedy the deprivation of the Federal right sought to be remedied.” And it established as a\nprerequisite to a population order a finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that “crowding is the primary cause of the\nviolation of a Federal right,” and that “no other relief will remedy the violation of the Federal right.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a).\n34\nSee Brown v.

The terms of\nsettlements are typically limited only by the mild constraints that they “spring from and serve to resolve a dispute within\nthe court's subject matter jurisdiction ... [,] ‘com[e] within the general scope of the case made by the pleadings,’ ... further\nthe objectives of the law upon which the complaint was based,” and are not otherwise unlawful. Id. But the PLRA, 18\nU.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A), somewhat restricts enforceable settlement terms in jail and prison cases.

Sl0576-02  Page 1 \n1996 WL 522797 (Cong.Rec.) \n(Cite as: 142 Cong. Rec. 810576-02) \nCongressional  Record  --- Senate \nProceedings  and Debates  of  the  104th Congress,  Second  Session \nMonday,  September  16,  1996 \n*Sl0576  CRIME  IN  AMERICA \nMr.  COVERDELL. \nMr.  President,  undoubtedly,  Senator Dole's emphasis  on  taking crime  head-on  is an \noutgrowth of  a  circumstance  over  the  last 3  years  that  has  just turned  sour on us.  It has \nbeen alluded to,  but  I  want  to cite some  of  the  facts  that  have  developed  in  the  last 36 \nmonths. \nFirst of  all,  I  want  to make  it clear that  there  can be  no  doubt  about  it that,  in the \nlast 36  months,  the United States has  found  itself,  once  again,  in a  massive  drug \nepidemic.  It is fueling and will  continue  to  fuel  crime.  Just  to  cite this,  in  the  last 36 \nmonths,  marijuana use  is up  105  percent,  LSD  is up  130  percent,  cocaine up  160  percent. \nSomebody  in the  administration suggested  that,  actually,  drug use  is down.  I  have  no  idea \nwhere  that  data  is coming  from,  but  it must  be  a  single  source,  because  every other source \nhas  documented  that drugs  were  up  in virtually every category.  The  sad  thing,  Mr. \nPresident,  is  that  they are  kids. \nIn the  last epidemic,  during  the  1960's  and  1970's,  it was  a  target group  from  about  16 \nto  20.  It has  dropped,  which  is such a  tragedy.  Now  the  ensnarement  is occurring at age  8 \nto 13.  This  country is going  to  feel  the  impact  of  that  for  a  long,  long  time.  One  in \nevery 10  kids  is using drugs. \nDrug  prosecutions  are down  12  percent.  This  administration cut  625  drug  agents.  Federal \nspending on  drug  interdiction has  been  cut by 25  percent.  The  drug  czar's office was \nreduced by  83  percent.  On  the  list of national  security threats,  compiled by  the National \nSecurity Council,  this  administration moved  illegal drugs  from No.  3,  as  a  threat,  to No. \n29  out  of  29. \nNow,  Mr.  President,  can  there be  any wonder  that our children are getting the  wrong \nmessage,  and  that  they no  longer think drugs  are  a  risk,  and  that,  therefore,  they are \nusing  them  in record numbers,  and  that,  therefore,  we  have  an  epidemic,  and  that, \ntherefore,  we  are having the  emergence  of  a  new  crime wave? \nMr.  President,  we  have  been  joined by one  of  our colleagues  that has  been  in the  center \nof  this controversy during his  entire  time,  which  is since  1994.  The  distinguished Senator \nfrom  Michigan  is already making  an  impact  in this  area of vital concern across  our \ncotmtry:. \nI  yield up  to 15  minutes  to the  Senator  from  Michigan. \nPitESIDENT  CLINTON'S  VETO  BY  LAWYERING \nMr.  ABRAHAM. \nMr.  President,  I  thank  the Senator from Georgia,  again.  for his efforts  to bring us \ntogether here  to focus  on vari9us vital matters before  the  Senate and before  the Ameri~an \npeople. \nMr.  President,  I  have  taken.the  floor on several previous occasions  to discuss  the \nproblem of  abusive prison litigation and  thie congrese'  eff6rts to attack that problem. \nCopr. ©West 2002 No Claim to Orig. U.S. Govt. Works \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-6 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 3 of 7 PageID #:302\n142 Cong.Rec. Sl0576-02  Page 2 \n1996 WL 522797 (Cong.Rec.) \n(Cite as: 142 Cong. Rec. 810576-02) \nThe  last time  I  did so was  April  19,  1996.  At  that  time,  I  expressed my  disappointment \nthat  President  Clinton had  just vetoed the  Commerce-Justice- State appropriations  bill. \nContained  in that bill was  the  Prison Litigation Reform Act,  a  carefully crafted set of \nprovisions designed to stem the  tide of prison litigation. \nIn my  view,  this was  a  very  important piece of  legislation.  Lawsuits  by prisoners  and \nlawsuits over prison conditions were  completely out  of  hand. \nOne  figure  captures  the  situation very well.  In  fiscal  year 1995,  prisoners- inmates  in \nprison-filed 63,550  civil lawsuits  in our  Federal  court  system.  That  is a  little over \none-quarter of  all  the  civil  lawsuits  filed  in Federal  courts  that  year.  It's also far \nmore  than  the  45,788  Federal  criminal prosecutions  initiated that  fiscal year. \nIn  short,  Mr.  President,  we  saw,  in fiscal  year 1995,  prison lawsuits  outnumber \nprosecutions under our Federal  system and  account  for one-quarter of  all the  lawsuits \nbrought  in this country in the  Federal  system. \nOne  prisoner sued because  he  had been  served melted  ice cream.  For  this he  claimed  $1 \nmillion in damages.  Fortunately,  the  judge  ruled that  the  right  to eat  frozen  ice cream \nwas  not  one  of  those  the  Framers  of  the  Constitution had  in mind. \nAnother  sued because  when  his dinner  tray arrived,  the piece of  cake  on  it was  \"hacked \nUp. \nII \nA  third sued demanding  LA  Gear  or Reebok  \"Pumps\"  instead of  Converse  tennis  shoes.  This \nkind  of  abusive  litigation is not  only frivolous,  it costs money  and  cost  the  taxpayers  a \nlot of money. \nThe  National  Association of Attorneys  General  estimated that  the  States were  spending \nabout  $81  million to battle cases  of  the  sort  I  just described-this  even  though  the  States \nwin  95  percent  of  these  cases  early in the  litigation for  reasons  that  are obvious. \nWe  were  determined  to do  something about  this problem in the  Congress,  so  as  part of \nthe Commerce-State-Justice  appropriations bill in 1996  we  passed  the  Prison Litigation \nReform Act.  This  legislation charged prisoners  a  fee  for  filing any  lawsuit,  while making \nit possible  for  the prisoners  to pay  that  fee  in installments.  If a  prisoner filed more \nthan  three  frivolous  cases,  however,  the prisoner would  no  longer be  able  to pay the \nfiling fee  in  installments.  He  or she  would  have  to pay the  full  fee  up  front,  unless  a \ncourt  found  this would  create  imminent  risk of  bodily harm. \nIn addition,  prisoners who  filed frivolous  lawsuits would  lose  their good  time  credits, \nthus making  their stay in prison longer.  And  judges were  given authority to  screen out \nfrivolous  cases  on  their own. \nThe  legislation was  designed  to put  an  end  to another aspect  of  the prison litigation \nproblem:  Seizure by Federal  judges  of  the power  to run prison systems.  These  seizures have \nconsequences  that  range  from  the  ridiculous  to the  disastrous. \nIn my  own  State of Michigan,  judicial orders  resulting from  Justice Department  lawsuits \nhave  resulted  in *Sl0577  Federal  courts monitoring our State prisons  to determine  how  warm \nthe  food  is,  how  bright  the  lights are,  whether  there  are  electrical outlets  in each  cell, \nwhether  the prisoners'  hair is cut by licensed barbers-this  despite  the  fact  that no  court \nhas  ever  found  that any of  these  conditions  regarding which  it is giving orders violate \nthe  Constitution. \nCopr. ©West 2002 No Claim to Orig.

S10576-02) \nThe  orders  issued by  a  judge  in Philadelphia were  even worse.  There  a  Federal  judge had \nbeen overseeing what  had become  a  program of  wholesale  releases of  up  to 600  criminal \ndefendants per week.  Why?  To  keep  the prison population down  to what  the  judge  considered \nan appropriate  level.  Thousands  of  the  released defendants  were  then  rearrested for  new \ncrimes  including  in one  18-month period  79  murders,  90  rapes,  959  robberies,  2,215  drug \ndealing charges,  701  burglaries,  2,748  thefts,  and  1,113  assaults. \nIn  the  interest of  justice and public  safety,  we  wanted  to  stop  this,  and  the means \nwere  simple  and  fully  in keeping with everyone's  rights.  We  simply  required  in that  same \nPrison Litigation Reform Act  that  no  judge  could  take  over a  prison without  first holding \nthat  it had violated the  Constitution and  explaining how  the order was  necessary to \ncorrect  the violation.  We  also directed that  the  judge give  due  regard  to public  safety in \ndeciding what  kinds  of  remedies  to require.  And  we  established stringent  limits on  the \npower  of  the  courts  to order prisoners  released.  Existing orders would have  to meet  these \nnew  standards.  If they did not,  they would  have  to be  dissolved  immediately on motion of \nthe prison authorities,  unless  the  court  found  that  the  orders were  necessary to correct \nan  on-going violation of  a  Federal  right. \nUnfortunately,  President Clinton vetoed  that  legislation.  At  the  time,  the  President \nsaid his veto  had nothing  to do  with our prison litigation proposals.  Instead,  he  said,  he \nwas  vetoing the  bill over other matters. \nWe  took  the  President  at  his  word  and  included our proposals  in a  second piece of \nlegislation.  This  time,  the  President  signed  the  legislation.  Unfortunately,  the \nPresident's  top  ranking officials in the  Department  of  Justice  seem  intent  on  inventing a \nnew  kind of veto,  veto by lawyering. \nThis  effort started almost  as  soon as  the  ink  from  the  President's  signing pen was  dry. \nA mere  11  weeks  after signing the  bill,  his  Department  of Justice was  filing briefs all \naround  the  country that would undermine  the  clear intent of  our  legislation.  The  briefs \nclaimed  that,  far  from  requiring the  courts  to  stop running  the prisons  for  the  comfort  of \nprisoners,  that  law authorized them  to continue  to do  so  indefinitely. \nThus,  according  to  President Clinton's Justice Department,  Federal  judges  should \ncontinue  to  tell Michigan how  warm  the  food  should be,  how  bright  the  lights have  to be, \nand  who  should  cut  the prisoners'  hair.  And  by the  logic of  their position,  judges  should \nalso continue  to dictate prison population size and  order excess  prisoners  released-this \neven  if the  Constitution contains no  such requirement  and  even  if the  release orders \njeopardize public  safety.  At  least they should do  this while  they are  investigating \nwhether  the  prison ever violated any provision of  the  Constitution,  an  investigation that \ncan  take  quite  a  bit of  time. \nThe  Department  of Justice has  come  up  with a  host  of  legal  theories  to explain why  the \nreform act  should be  read  to require  indefinite  judicial supervision of prisons  for  the \nbenefit  of prisoners.  It is difficult to  say which  is more  ludicrous,  the  original or the \ncurrent  theory.  The  original  theory,  now  abandoned  in the  face  of  questions  from  Members \nof  this body  and  the National  Association of Attorneys  General,  was  that  the phrase \n\"violation of  a  Federal  right\"  includes  violations of  the very decrees  the  reform act was \nadopted  to end. \nThe  current  theory stands  on  its head  the  reform act's requirement  that  existing \ndecrees  be  automatically stayed 30  days  after a  motion  to end  one  has  been  filed unless \nthere has  been  a  final  ruling on  the  motion. \nAccording  to  the  current Justice Department  theory,  this  requirement  in fact  means  the \ndecrees  are not  automatically stayed,  and,  indeed,  that nothing should happen  to  them at \nCopr. ©West 2002 No Claim to Orig.

Even  Judge  Harold Baer,  the  subject of \nsome  attention for his  theory that  running away  from  the  cops  gave  no  grounds  for \nreasonable  suspicion,  rejected these  theories and  ended  judicial  rule  at Riker's  Island. \nJudges  there had been dictating such crucial matters  as  the  brand and  exact  concentration \nof  cleanser to be  used  in certain areas. \nThe  theories  are  ludicrous but  the  end  result  is not.  These  interpretations make  a \nmockery of  this Congress,  they make  a  mockery of  the  law,  and  they make  a  mockery of  the \nAmerican people's  desire  to have  prisons  run  to promote  the public order,  not  to promote \nthe  comfort  of  our prisoners. \nFurther,  even  if they desperately try to protect existing decrees,  President Clinton's \nDepartment  of  Justice continues  to threaten exactly the  kinds  of  lawsuits  the  reform act \nwas  supposed  to end. \nFor example,  a  mere  4  days  after President  Clinton signed  the  reform act,  the Assistant \nAttorney General  for  Civil Rights  threatened to  sue Gov.  Parris Glendening  of Maryland \nover conditions  in Maryland's  supermaximum security prison.  Supermaxes  are  reserved for \nthe  most  dangerous  prisoners,  murderers  and  rapists who  continue  their violent behavior  in \nprison. \nWhat  were  the  egregious  unconstitutional  conditions  that  led President Clinton's \nAssistant Attorney General  for  Civil Rights  to  threaten suit? The  fact  that  supermax \nprisoners are not  allowed  to socialize enough  and  are not  getting enough  outdoor exercise. \nThe  Department  calls  these  conditions unconstitutional because  they are  the  \"mental \nequivalent of putting an  asthmatic  in a  place with  little air to breathe.\" \nFortunately,  this particular veto by lawyering will  ultimately succeed only if \nPresident  Clinton's Justice Department  persuades  the  courts  to go  along with  it.  I  do  not \nexpect  that  it will. \nSo  far  the  results are not promising  for  the  Justice Department.  So  far,  the  judges who \nhave  decided  these  issues,  interestingly,  all of  them Democratic  appointees  who  had either \ntaken over the  running of prisons  themselves  or had  inherited them  from  a  predecessor who \nretired,  rejected half  the  arguments  urging  them  to retain control. \nMr.  President,  other parts of  the  Reform Act,  the  ones  designed  to  cut back  on \nindividual prisoner lawsuits,  which  President  Clinton's Department  of Justice has  no  role \nin enforcing,  already are  showing  their effects.  Prisoner filings  since  the bill's \nenactment  have  declined sharply.  Nevertheless,  the  Department  of  Justice,  through  its \nattempted veto by  lawyering,  is delaying and undermining  the  effectiveness of  critical \nportions of  the Reform Act.  The  Judiciary Committee  will  be  holding  a  hearing on  this \nmatter next  week. \nIt is my  intention to propose  an  amendment  to whatever proves  to be  the  most \nappropriate  legislation,  either this year's Commerce-State-Justice  appropriations bill or \nperhaps  another omnibus  appropriations bill,  that clarifies once  and  for all  it is time \nfor  abusive prison litigation to end,  whether  it is brought  by prisoners or by  President \nClinton's Department  of  Justice. \nIt is unfortunate we  must  clarify once  again  the  clear intent of  such  recently enacted \nlegislation.  But  public safety and  the  costs  of  our prison system are  too  important  for  us \nto allow  this  inappropriate veto by misinterpretation. \nCopr. ©West 2002 No Claim to Orig. U.S. Govt.

I  am  extraordinarily disappointed by  it.  I  intend  to be  on \nthe  floor  as  often as  necessary  to bring about  the  correct  interpretation of  that \nlegislation or to add  new  legislation that  eliminates  any possibility of misinterpretation \nin the  future.  Prisons  should be  tough  time  for prisoners and  the  rights of victims  should \ntake  priority. \nThat  is what  I  believe everybody  in this Chamber  is committed  to doing,  and  if \nnecessary we  will have  to enact more  legislation to get  the  job done.  But  I  am  very \ndisappointed  in the actions  of  the  Department  of Justice to  *Sl0578  date because  it is \ncertainly inconsistent with what  we  demand  and  what  the American people  I  believe want  to \nsee happen  in  the  area of  prison reform. \nI  thank  the  Senator  from  Georgia. \nThe  PRESIDING  OFFICER. \nThe  Senator  from Georgia. \nMr.  COVERDELL. \nI  wonder  if the  Senator  from  Michigan would  stay just a  moment  to see  if I  get  the \nsequence  of  these  events  down.  We  had  a  condition of  legal  frivolity-if you  froze  an  ice \ncream or not.  I  think any American who  would  hear  this  just would be  dumbfounded.  But  your \nlegislation put  an  end  to  that and put  an end  to  judicial management  of prisons.  And  the \nPresident vetoed  that. \nMr.  ABRAHAM. \nThat  is correct. \nMr.  COVERDELL. \nThen  you  came  back  again,  passed the essence  of  this  legislation,  and he  signed  it,  but \nhis Justice Department  has  subsequently been engaged  in an  overt  attempt  to undo  it? \nMr.  ABRAHAM. \nThat  is accurate.  I  would  say  to the  Senator from  Georgia,  we  were  told when  the  first \nveto occurred,  because  this  legislation was  included in a  broader bill,  that  the \nlegislation,  the  Prison Litigation Reform Act,  was  not  the  basis  for  the veto;  that,  in \nfact,  it was  supported. \nWhen  the  second bill was  signed,  we  assumed  the  Justice Department  would  seek  to make \nsure  the provisions of  that  Litigation Reform Act  would  be  enacted and  followed  by  the \ncourts.  Instead,  what  we  have  seen  is  the  Department  of  Justice  intervening in  lawsuits  in \na  way  that would,  in fact,  preclude,  rather than  allow,  States  to extricate themselves \nfrom  these various  judicial circumstances  where  judges  were  running  the  prison systems \nwith no  clear evidence of  a  constitutional violation ever having occurred.  Instead,  we \nfind  the  Justice Department  finding ways  to allow the  judges  to stay in charge  and  to \nallow  for various  things  such as  we  have  seen around  the  country,  where  these prisoner \nlawsuits  are growing  in number,  where  judges  are  requiring prisons  and State authorities \nto  expend millions of  taxpayer dollars  simply to ensure  and  improve  the  comfort  of \nCopr. ©West 2002 No Claim to Orig.

These include: \n(1)  requirements that prisoners must fully exhaust state administrative remedies prior \nto filing a federal lawsuit;  (2) significant restrictions on federal court relief related to \nconditions in prisons, jails, and juvenile detention facilities;  (3) expanded ability for \ncertain individuals to oppose the imposition or continuation of remedial relief through \nnew provisions on standing and intervention;  (4)  automatic time limits for specific \nforms of prospective relief;  (5) mandated requirements and significant new roles for \nmagistrate judges regarding oversight of prison condition cases; and (6)  restrictions \non attorneys' fees in such cases. \nThe total impact of the bill could not be quantified.  For many provisions, this \nimpact statement provides only an initial assessment or examples of the resource \nconsequences to the judiciary if this bill were enacted.  However, the related costs \ncould be extremely high.  For example, the potential annual resource costs of \ntitle Ill, which covers court-ordered relief in prison condition cases, could be \nmore than $239 million and 2,096 positions, of which at least 280 would be \njudicial officers (Article Ill judges and/or magistrate judges).  At least $95 million \ncould be incurred if just 50 percent of the nearly 4,000 existing prison conditions \nconsent decrees and court orders were refiled in federal court subsequent to their \ntermination under this bill.  More than $144 million in resource costs could be \nincurred by the judiciary if just 2,000 prisoners in each of the 100 prison condition \ncases with the largest numbers of named plaintiffs were required to testify \nindividually as to how the alleged prison conditions affected them specifically. \nGiven the total nationwide prison population and all of the existing consent \n._ ____ dE:lcrees and court orders that could be subject to court review and termination \nevery two years~ the actual and recurring costs could be much greater.  Title Ill's \nrequirements that only federal magistrate judges could perform fact~finding in such \ncases would also radically alter the role and workload of both magistrate judges and \nArticle Ill. judges, affecting allocation of costs and resources. \nThe impact of title I of the bill, which would give prison construction grants to \nstates that enact ''truth-in-sentencing\" laws, could not be assessed, given the \nuncertainty of which states would qualify for these grants and their potential \nconstruction timetables.  Additional prison facilities could result in additional prisoner \nlitigation at the federal level.  It could also have some effect on prisoner release and \nrecidivism rates if more prisoners are incarcerated for longer periods and cannot \ncommit federal crimes.  Title II of the bill requires prisoners to fully exhaust state \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-7 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 4 of 15 PageID #:310\nadministrative remedies before filing a section 1983 civil rights action in federal court. \nThis requirement could affect the number of such filings.  However, based on the \nconflicting experiences of several states, where similar requirements both increased \nand decreased filings, the impact of this provision was unclear. \nAs mentioned in the example above, title Ill could be enormously expensive. \nIn addition, the title would impose strict limitations on the ability of federal courts to \nfashion, approve or impose remedies in prisoner civil rights cases. \nNo direct federal court impact would be expected from title IV (restrictions on \nfederal prisoner use of strength training and related equipment), title V (potential \nrestrictions relating to federal prison amenities), title VI  {community service projects), \nor title VII (prison commissary administration).  This statement provides an in-depth \nanalysis of only titles II and Ill, because those titles would have the most \nsignificantly effect on the federal judiciary. \nANALYSIS OF TITLES II ANO  Ill \nIf the entire bill were enacted, several ·of the provisions within titles II and Ill \nwould have significant interacting effects.  The interrelated effects of these titles and \nother provisions prevent the development of precise estimates of the total resource \nimpacts associated with this bill.  The potential workload and resource projections \npresented herein generally assume full implementation of the legislation. \nIn order to develop better estimates of the potential caseload and resource \neffects of this bill, the Federal-State Jurisdiction Committee of the Judicial \nConference of the United States requested that this office conduct an empirical \nsurvey of 15 federal court districts identified as processing considerable levels of \nprisoner civil rights litigation (Prisoner Litigation Survey).  This survey requested \nspecific data on various related issues, such as: the total number of major, systemic \nprison condition cases and the specific condition issues involved; estimates of the \nof \n·number  witnesses and total trial time in such cases; classification of how many \ncases were resolved by court order or consent decree; identification of background \nof individuals appointed as special masters or monitors; breakouts of how many \nconsent orders included judicial findings of constitutional violations; and other \nappropriate questions.  The data received was incorporated into the impact analysis \nof specific provisions of the bill or otherwise correlated with other available sources \nof information. \n2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-7 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 5 of 15 PageID #:311\n•stopping Abusive Prisoner Lawsuits\" \n(Title II, Sections 201, 202, 204) \nTitle II of this bill contains several modifications and restrictions on the \nprisoner petition process.  Section 201  would prohibit a section 1983 civil rights \naction (42 U.S.C. § 1983) if the petitioning prisoner had not completely exhausted all \navailable administrative remedies, where the remedies had been approved or \ncertified as provided for under current law. \nIn accordance with current law (42 U.S.C. § 1997e), several states have \nrecently implemented institutional grievance procedures that would allow a district \ncourt to continue a prisoner civil rights case to allow for the exhaustion of such \nremedies.  These programs, which are similar to those proposed in section 201, \nhave had mixed results.  Some states reported that by extending the administrative \nremedy process, some additional grievances were resolved at the state level or by \nthe time the administrative process was over, some prisoners believed it was no \nlonger necessary to file petitions in the federal courts.  Other states contend that \nextending the administrative process had little effect on the number of prisoner \npetitions ultimately filed in the federal courts.  As a result of this conflicting data, the \nchange in the number of section 1983 prisoner petitions which would be filed in \nfederal court under proposed section 201  could not be estimated. \nSection 202 would direct federal courts to dismiss any frivolous or malicious \nsection 1983 action, or such actions that fail to state a claim upon which relief may \nbe granted, brought by an adult convicted of a crime and confined in any jail, prison \nor other correctional facility.  Section 204 would require that any prisoner filing such \na suit include a statement of all assets in his or her possession so the court can \nrequire a full or partial payment of filing fees based on the prisoner's ability to pay. \nThese provisions would not prevent the actions from being filed in federal \ncourt.  They would only allow the court to dismiss the action at an earlier point in \nthe process.  A substantial portion of the judiciary1s costs related to these types of \ncases is incurred in the initial filing and review stage prior to any dismissal ~. \nfiling and noticing activities, docket preparation).  Possibly, the requirement to pay a \nfiling fee may affect a prisoner's decision to file the action. \nDuring FY 1994, almost 39,100 federal and state prisoner petition civil rights \ncases' were filed in federal court at an estimated resource cost of $49. 7 million and \n508 judiciary positions.  Although title II could reduce the number of petitions filed or \nr~duce court review before the petition could be dismissed, any savings would be at \n1  nJudicial Business of the U.S. Courts, 1994 Report of the Director,\" Table C-2. \n3 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-7 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 6 of 15 PageID #:312\nleast partially diminished by the increase in resources necessary to review the \nprisoner statements of assets and to process separate partial payments of filing \nfees.  For this reason, the total resource savings .could not be developed. \n\"Stop Turning Out Prisoners11  Act \n(Title Ill, Section 301) \nThis title would impose strict limitations on the ability of federal courts to \nfashion, approve or impose remedies in prisoner civil rights cases.  There could also \nbe dramatic and continuing increases in the number of proceedings related to \nrequests for termination of court ordered relief in such cases.  The judiciary costs \nand resources associated with these provisions could be enormous. \nSection 301 (a) of this title contains substantial amendments to section 3626 \nof title 18, United States Code,2  relating to court remedies in prison conditions \nlitigation.  Section 301 (b) would make these amendments retroactive to all orders, \nconsent decrees and other relief, regardless of whether the relief was originally \ngranted or approved before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this bill.  A \ndetailed summary of each significant proposed amendment or group of related \namendments contained in this section and the related potential effect on the federal \ncourts follows: \nSubsection 3626(al (1) - Limitations on Court-Ordered Relief in Prison \nCondition Cases - This subsection states that a court's ability to issue \n11[p]rospective relief in a civil action with respect to prison conditions shall \nextend no further than necessary to remove the conditions that are causing \nthe deprivation of the Federal rights of individual plaintiffs in that civil action.11 \n(emphasis added)  Furthermore, the court would not be able to grant or \napprove any prospective relief. \"unless the court finds that such relief is \nto \nnarrowly drawn and the least intrusive means  remedy the violation of the \nFederal right.\"  In determining the overall intrusiveness of any such relief, the \ncourt must give \"substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or \nthe ope.ration ·af a· criminal justice system caused by the relief.\" \nSubsection 3626(a) (2) - Restrictions on Court-Ordered Relief In Prison \nOvercrowding Cases - This subsection states that in any civil action with \nrespect to prison conditions, \"the court shall not grant or approve any relief \nwhose purpose or effect is to reduce or limit the prison population, unless the \n2  Section 3626, enacted as part of last year's major crime legislation Niolent Crime \nControl and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, P.L. 103-322 (108 Stat. 1796, Sept 13, 1994), \nconcerned appropriate remedies with respect only to prison crowding litigation. \n4 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-7 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 7 of 15 PageID #:313\nplaintiff proves that crowding is the primary cause of the deprivation of the \nFederal right and no other relief will remedy that deprivation!' (emphasis \nadded) \nThe overall effect of both of these provisions would be to restrict severely the \nability of federal courts to fashion, approve or impose remedies in many prisoner \ncivil rights class action cases.  The potential impact on the federal courts could be \nsubstantial, incurring millions of dollars in annually recurring resource costs, \ndepending on how the intent of Congress and these provisions are interpreted and \nimplemented.  · \nThe most recent census of state and federal prisoner population indicated \nthere arera bout 1.2 million inmates3  located in a  roximatel  . .  4  te \nprisons an  e  era  prisons.5  As of January 1, 1994, thirty-nine states, the District  ~ \n-Of Columbia, .P  uerto Rico,  and the Virgin Islands had one or more prisons operating  ~- ./' \nunder at least one consent decree or court order for an approximate total of 323  ~ · ~ \nstate prisons (at this time, no federal prisons are under a court order or consent  ~\\...;  ~ \ndecree).8  Of the 3,270 jails nationwide, about 320 are operating under a court order  ~ \n\"\\1 \nor consent decree.

Most motions for termination \nwill require at least an initial hearing and many will require substantial evidentiary \nhearings if the court is to determine whether the previously-ordered relief continues \nto be necessary.  It is also likely that given the restrictions on availability of \nattorneys' fees set forth in section 3626(e), very few of the potentially many cases \nthat would be filed following automatic termination will be settled out-of-court. \nAccording to various judiciary studies on caseweight factors and current \nworkload measurement formulas, major· prison condition class action civil rights \ncases are most likely to involve appointed counsel, are often extremely time \nconsuming and require extensive use of judicial resources, even when taking into \naccount that usually only a small percentage of the individual petitioners or members -\nof the named class of. prisoners actually testify.12  Based on these caseweights and \n8  orrelation of data obtained from  Bureau of Justice Statistics, \"Sourcebook of Criminal \n1  ·cs - 1991 11  Table 1.98 (BJS Sourcebook 1991) and from Jail Inmates Bulletin, p.5. \n1\n8  orrectional Facilities Census, Table 1o , applying ratios consistent with data received \nootnote 7. \n10  See tl.i U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice \nStatistics~ Challenging the Conditions of Prisons and Jails: A Report on Section 1983 \nLitigation, January 1995, NCJ-151652, p. 1, fn. 1 (Section 1983 Litigation Report).  This \ninformation was also supported by discussions with representatives of the ACLU National \nPrisoner Project, the National Center for State Courts, the American Jail Association, and \nthe Bureau of Prisons, as well as by data received in response to the Prisoner Litigation \nSurvey. \n11  Correctional Facilities Census, p.7; and BJS Sourcebook 1991, Table 1.98. \n12  See M. Section· 1983 Litigation Report, pp. 22-27 and accompanying reference list, \npp. 45-46.  Many of the findings of these studies were supported by the data received in \nresponse to the Prisoner Litigation Survey. \n6 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-7 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 9 of 15 PageID #:315\nwork formulas, the cost of just reopening, producing required findings and deciding \nwhether to continue previously-ordered relief or issue new decrees in 100 such \ncases would be about $4.77 million and 45.3 positions. \nHowever, the judiciary's costs would be significantly higher if the court \nmust make individual findings and hear testimony from each affected plaintiff, \nas may be intended under this section.  For example, if 2,000 members of a \nprisoner class action were required to individually testify, the total resource cost to \nthe judiciary would be at least $1.44 million and 11.9 positions for just one case. \nEven if the court were able to hear from six witnesses per day (taking into account \ntime for testimony and cross·examination), it could take more than 330 days or \nmore than 1.6 court years for a judge (district and/or magistrate judge, \ndepending on the allocation of workload) to hear evidence from each member \nof the class action. 13 \nIt is not known exactly how many such cases would be filed in federal court \neach year.  Assuming, however, that such prisoner class actions (whether refiled \nafter termination under subsection 3626 or newly initiated) were filed against just 100 \nof the largest correctional facilities or systems and 2,000 prisoners in each of these \ncases were required to testify individually as to how the alleged prison conditions \naffected them specifically (200,000 potential plaintiffs), the total annual resource \ncosts to the judiciary would be about $144 million and 1,1  90 positions.  More \nthan 160 of these positions would be judicial officers, working full-time on \nthese cases each year.  These costs can be several times greater. considering the \ntotal nationwide prison population and the thousands of existing prison and jail \nconsent decrees and court orders that could be subject to court review and \ntermination within the first two years after enactment, as discussed herein. \nAs mentioned previously, the group of individuals covered by any court \nordered relief may be limited to the named prisoner litigants.  Other prisoners not \nspecifically part of the initial class action as well as new inmates might not receive \nany remedies or benefits from the resolution of these cases.  This situation alone \ncould generate thousands of additional suits seeking the same relief or outcome. \n13  Based on current workload measurement formulas and confirmed by data received \nfrom the Prisoner Litigation Survey.  These numbers assume that only one judge works full \ntime on each of these cases; the length of the trial could be reduced significantly if more \nthan one judge is assigned to the case on more than a part-time basis. \n7 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-7 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 10 of 15 PageID #:316\nSubsection 3626{b)(1) - Automatic Termination of Prospective Relief \n- This subsection provides that in any civil action on prison conditions. \nany prospective relief shall automatically terminate two years after the \nlater of either:  (1) the date the court found the violation of a federal \nright that was the basis for the relief; or (2) the date of enactment of \nthis legislation. \nSubsection 3626{b)(2} - Immediate Termination of Prospective \nRelief - This subsection provides that in any civil action on prison \nconditions. a defendant or intervenor shall be entitled to immediate \ntermination of any prospective relief, if that relief was approved or \ngranted in the absence of a finding by the court that prison conditions \nviolated a Federal right.\" (emphasis added) \nSubsection 3626(c} .. Procedure for Motions Affecting Prospective \nRelief - Part 1 of this subsection requires courts to rule promptly on \nany motion to modify or terminate prospective relief with respect to \nprison conditions.  Part 2 provides that any prospective relief subject to \na pending motion would be automatically stayed during the period \nbeginning either 30 to 180 days after the motion is filed (depending on \nthe nature of the motion), ending when the court enters a final order \nruling on the motion. \nSubsection 3626(d) - Expansion of Provisions on Standing and \nIntervention - This subsection grants standing for the purpose of \nopposing any relief whose purpose or effect is to reduce or limit prison \npopulation to the following persons: any federal, state, or local official \nor unit of government, whose jurisdiction or function includes the \nprosecution or custody of persons in the prison at issue, or who may \notherwise be affected by the population-limiting relief.  Such persons \nare also authorized to intervene in any proceeding relating to such \nrelief.  Standing is to.P~t~lit?erally .conferred under this subsection so as \n. -...... \"t() effeciuata·:·the remedial purposes of this section.\" \nThe net effect of these four provisions would be to increase dramatically the \nnumber of proceedings related fo requests for termination of court ordered relief, \nwhether immediately or within the first two years after enactment of this Act, \nregardless· of whether remedies related to such orders were implemented. \nThis would especially be the case with respect to consent decrees.  Such \ndecrees are typically used as a means of settling prison litigation without an explicit \nfinding by the court of a federal violation.  The parties typically include in the \n8 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-7 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 11 of 15 PageID #:317\nconsent decree a statement to the effect that the defendants, by agreeing to settle \nthe case, are not admitting that the conditions of confinement in the correctional \nfacility are unconstitutional.  This statement is included in the consent decree so that \nthe decree is not used against correctional officials in other lawsuits contesting the \nconditions of confinement.  Best available information indicates that the majority of \nsuch consent decrees do not contain a finding of a constitutional violation.1'  In \nseveral ways, this legislation creates various disincentives for the parties to enter into \nconsent decrees. \nUnder these provisions, court orders and consent decrees covering conditions \nin correctional facilities that may or may not have been rectified are likely to be the \ntarget of motions seeking immediate termination.  If termination occurs, the inmates \nat those facilities would probably bring additional lawsuits {either class actions or \nindividual petitions) to resolve issues and conditions that have previously been the \nsubject of remedial relief but have never been rectified, in the opinion of the affected \nprisoners. \nAs stated earlier, Bureau of Justice Statistics data indicate that there are at \nleast 1,030 court orders and consent decrees affecting prisons and jails that are \nprimarily related to crowding conditions.  Motions to stay prospective relief in a \nmajority of these crowded condition cases could be filed very shortly after \nenactment of these provisions.  Even if there were no immediate and specific \nmotions, subsection 3626{b)(1) would automatically terminate all of the nearly \n4,000 existing court orders and consent decrees within two years after \nenactment. \nBest available information indicates that the majority of existing court orders \nand consent decrees were imposed or approved by federal courts, but the actual \npercentage could not be determined.  It is also unknown how many of these cases \nwould be refiled and what percentage in state or federal court.  In many instances, \nthe main issues or problems may already be near full compliance or resolution and \nthe only continuing oversight of the facility is minimal.  For these situations, there \nmight not be any apparent or urgent need for a new lawsuit to be filed.  As \nmentioned previously, current caseweights and work measurement formulas indicate \nthat the cost of reopening just 100 such cases, producing the required findings and \nissuing new court decrees would be about $4.n million· and 45.3 positions. \n1 This supposition is based on background information received from representatives \n• \nof various national correctional associations and summary reports issued by the ACLU's \nNational Prison Project.  The Prisoner Litigation Survey conducted by this office supported \nthis supposition, indicating that fewer than 17% of all consent decrees contained findings of \na constitutional violation. \n9 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-7 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 12 of 15 PageID #:318\nIn order to illustrate the potential effect of these provisions, if only 50 percent \nof the nearly 4,000 total number of consent decrees and court orders affecting \nprisons and jails were the subject of new litigation and filed in federal courts, the \ncost to the judiciary would be more than $95.4 million and 906 positions.  More \nthan 126 of these positions would be judicial officers (district judges and/or \nmagistrate judges).  If the judiciary were to re-adjudicate just 50 percent of the \nexisting 1 ,030 orders and decrees related specifically to prison population conditions, \nthe cost would approach $24.6 million and 233.3 positions.  Given the available \ndata, these may be conservative estimates of the total impact on the federal courts. \nAs mentioned previously, these costs are based on current caseweights and \nwork measurement formulas.  The costs would be significantly higher if the court \nmust make individual findings and hear testimony from each affected prisoner, \nas set forth in the previous discussion of subsections 3626{a}(1} and (2}.  The costs \nalso do not take into account the effects from the mandated .role of magistrate \njudges set forth in subsection 3626{e}, below. \nSubsection 3626(e) - Mandated Use of Magistrate Judges As \nSpecial Master or Monitor - This subsection requires that in any civil \naction in federal court with respect to prison conditions, if a special \nmaster or monitor is to be appointed, such individual must be a United \nStates magistrate judge.  In addition, the magistrate judge would be \nlimited to making proposed findings on the record on complicated \nfactual issues submitted by the court, and would be prohibited from \nany other function, even if the parties consented. \nThis provision would place great demands on magistrate judges in particular \nand by extension, the rest of the federal judicial system.15  Magistrate judges would \nbe responsible for these functions rather than the wardens, correctional \nsuperintendents, and other correctional experts who generally serve as court \nmonitors at the present time.  In time, especially given the likelihood that most \nexisting court orders and consent decrees will be reopened (as discussed above), \n15 This section also appears to contravene certain fundamental jurisdiction provisions of \nthe Federal Magistrates Act (28 U.S.C. § 636).  One interpretation of the section contends \nthat magistrate judges would be prohibited from handling non-case-dispositive and case \ndispositive motions, as well as pretrial conferences in prisoner cases.  In addition, many \nmagistrate judges currently handle prisoner cases with the consent of the parties and may \nact with full dispositive authority equal to a district court judge; this practice may be \nprohibited or restricted under this proposed section.  This impact statement does not \nprovide cost analyses of these potential effects of the legislation. \n10 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-7 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 13 of 15 PageID #:319\nmagistrate judges might be appointed as special masters or monitors in hundreds of \nprison condition cases, at a minimum.18 \nUnder certain circumstances, magistrate judges could find that overseeing just \none major correctional facility or a few prisons and jails could become a full-time \noccupation, leaving little or no time to devote to other duties.11  This scenario is \nhighly probable considering the approximately 660 largest state and local \ncorrectional facilities currently operating under court orders or consent decrees and \nthe many thousands of prisoners in those institutions. · Magistrate judges are an \nintegral part of the judiciary, handling a significant part of the civil and criminal \ncaseload.  In response to the overall effects of this provision and the rest of title Ill, \nthe judiciary would either be required to seek funding for substantially more \nmagistrate judge positions, or else request additional district judgeships to assume \nthe additional workload.  The absence of additional resources may substantially \ndelay other criminal and civil proceedings within the federal courts. \nA precise estimate cannot be developed on the number of existing and future \ncourt orders and consent decrees that may use magistrate judges exclusively for \nfact-finding activities and monitoring of prison and jail conditions.  Best available \ninformation indicates that a special master or monitor is appointed in at least 20% of \nall prison condition cases settled by a court order or consent decree.18  For \nAvailable statistical and other agency workload data indicates that very few \nHI \nmagistrate judges are currently appointed as special masters or monitors in these cases. \nThe Prisoner Litigation Survey indicated that magistrate judges comprised fewer than 10% \nof the total number of special master or monitor appointments in major prison condition· \ncases. \n11  In one recently concluded major prison condition court action, for example, it is \nestimated that the court-appointed special master (an expert in prison management) and \nthree assistants will have to spend approximately 3-6 months full-time on a plan to \nimplement the court-ordered remedies.  If instead, this work had to be done by one \nmagistrate judge (without staff or assistants), it could take 2-4 years of his or her time \nworking exclusively on this one case. \nRelatedly, fees for the cost of special masters can be paid by the parties to the \nlitigation, specifically the state or local government party to the case.  Under this bill, \nhowever, if only magistrate judges can be special masters, the federal courts are in effect \nthe sole entity paying for this function. \n18 This 20% estimate is based on responses to the Prisoner Litigation Survey. \nAdditional research is being conducted to further substantiate and correlate this percentage \nestimate with similar information previously collected by the American Correctional \nAssociation (a summary of this information Is presented as Table 1.92 of the Bureau of \n11 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-7 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 14 of 15 PageID #:320\nillustrative purposes, approximately four magistrate judges (plus about 15.6 \nimmediate support positions and about an additional five indirect administrative \nsupport positions), at an annual cost of about $2.47 million would be required to \nperform 100 such monitoring activities.  If magistrate judges were used to monitor \nabout 20 percent {800) of the nearly 4,000 existing court orders and consent \ndecrees on a fulf·time basis, as many as 32 magistrate judges, and about 125 \nimmediate support staff positions and 40 indirect support positions would be \nrequired, at an annual cost of approximately $19.4 million.  If additional \nmagistrate judges are not available to perform duties in criminal and other civil \ncases, additional district judges will be needed to take on this increased workload. \nThe equivalent resource cost of 32 Article Ill judges (including about 173 immediate \nand indirect support staff positions) would be $22.3 million. \nSubsection 3626(f) - Limitations on Attorneys' Fees - This \nsubsection would limit the availability of attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C. \n§  1988 in prison condition cases, by allowing attorneys' fee awards \nonly to the extent that the fees are directly and reasonably incurred in \nproving an actual violation of the plaintiff's federal rights and are \nproportionally related to the extent the plaintiff obtains court ordered \nrelief for that violation. (emphasis added) \nThis provision could have several effects on the judiciary, none of which can \nbe precisely quantified at this time.  For example: \n1)  Fewer attorneys may agree to initially take on these cases.  More \nprison condition cases may be filed without the assistance of counsel. \nSuch pro se cases are usually more difficult and time consuming for \nthe courts to process. \n2)  By limiting attorneys' fees to those costs incurred in \"proving an \nactual violation,11  enforcement of remedies may become more difficult \nand time consuming for the courts.  Obtaining a court order is often \nonly the beginning phase of a prison condition suit. while monitoring \nand enforcement of the remedies may take several years.  If plaintiffs \nare prohibited from collecting attorneys' fees for the often drawn-out \nenforcement phase of the lawsuits, attorneys may not remain with a \ncase once relief is granted.  This situation could also increase the \nworkload of both Article Ill and magistrate judges, since oversight of \nJustice Statistics' \"Sourcebook of Criminal Statistics - 1993\"). \n12 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-7 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 15 of 15 PageID #:321\nthe implementation of the order may become a court function under \nsubsection (e}. \n3)  If attorneys' fees are restricted for these specific cases, attorneys \nmay attempt to recoup their time investments by bringing additional \npersonal contingency fee lawsuits, on behalf of their clients, against the \nindividuals (e.g., prison guards, wardens, doctors, etc.} who were \nresponsible for the specific conditions found to be unconstitutional. \nThe cost of 100 such lawsuits in federal court would be about $567,000 \nand 5.6 positions. \nIn any event, it is anticipated that these restrictions on the availability of \nattorneys' fees will reduce the incidence of settlement agreements being reached in \nmost prison conditions cases.  The effect of this provision as it interrelates with \nsections 3626(a) and  (b) has already been discussed. \nAnalytical Assumptions \nThe cost estimates presented above reflect the full or partial resource costs to \nthe judiciary of implementing specific provisions.  These estimates include the \nresource cost of existing judicial officers, their direct staff and associated support \nactivities that would contribute to handling the projected caseload ~. court \nsecurity, automation and administrative support) .19  The bill does not consider \ncreating new federal judgeships; therefore, the costs associated with appointing new \njudicial officers and hiring staff related to this new workload are not included. \n19 Some of t~ese specific support costs could increase substantially due to the types of \ncases that may be generated under this bill, especially court security costs; these increases \ncould not be quantified and were not included in the cost totals. \n13 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 26-8 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 1 of 26 PageID #:322\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT G \n\nCase: C1a:2s0e- c1v:2-002-c1v3-40 0D4o8c0u-mJEeJn t   #D:o 2c6u-m8 eFnilte 4d7:  0  4F/i0le6d/2 003 P/3a1g/e2 02   o Pf a2g6e P 1a goef I2D5 #:323\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA \n \nBHARATKUMAR G.

DISCUSSION \nIn a matter of weeks, the novel coronavirus COVID-19 has rampaged across \nthe globe, altering the landscape of everyday American life in ways previously \nunimaginable. Large portions of our economy have come to a standstill. Children \nhave been forced to attend school remotely. Workers deemed ‘non-essential’ to our \nnational infrastructure have been told to stay home. Indeed, we now live our lives \nby terms we had never heard of a month ago—we are “social distancing” and \n“flattening the curve” to combat a global pandemic2 that has, as of the date of this \nwriting, infected 719,700 people worldwide and killed more than 33,673.3 Each \nday these statistics move exponentially higher. It is against this increasingly grim \nbackdrop that we now consider the Petitioners’ claims for habeas relief.  \n \n \n                                                           \n2   The World Health Organization (“WHO”) officially declared COVID-19 as global \npandemic on March 11, 2020. See WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media \nbriefing on COVID-19 - 11 March 2020, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, (March 11, 2020), \nhttps://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-\nbriefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020. \n \n3   See Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, \nhttps://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 (last accessed March 31, \n2020). \n \n4 \n \n\nCase: C1a:2s0e- c1v:2-002-c1v3-40 0D4o8c0u-mJEeJn t   #D:o 2c6u-m8 eFnilte 4d7:  0  4F/i0le6d/2 003 P/3a1g/e2 06   o Pf a2g6e P 5a goef I2D5 #:327\nA. Threshold Questions: Standing and the Propriety of a Habeas \nPetition \nRespondents raise two threshold challenges to the Petitioners’ Motion.  First, \nRespondents contend that Petitioners lack standing because they have not alleged \nan injury in fact.  Next, Respondents submit that Petitioners cannot challenge their \nconditions of confinement through a habeas petition.  Taking the latter challenge \nfirst, we note that federal courts, including the Third Circuit, have condoned \nconditions of confinement challenges through habeas.  See Aamer v. Obama, 742 \nF.3d 1023, 1032 (D.C. Cir. 2014); see also Woodall v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 432 \nF.3d 235, 242-44 (3d Cir. 2005); see also Ali v. Gibson, 572 F.2d 971, 975 n.8 (3d \nCir. 1978).  Accordingly, we find that Petitioners have appropriately invoked this \ncourt’s jurisdiction through a 28 U.S.C. § 2241 petition for writ of habeas corpus. \nRespondents’ standing challenge can also be easily resolved.  Respondents \nessentially contend that because the Petitioners themselves do not have COVID-19 \nand their likelihood of contracting the illness is speculative, Petitioners cannot \nestablish that they would suffer a concrete, non-hypothetical injury absent a \ntemporary restraining order.  However, as the Supreme Court observed in Helling \nv. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993), “it would be odd to deny an injunction to \ninmates who plainly proved an unsafe, life-threatening condition in their prison on \nthe ground that nothing yet had happened to them.”  The COVID-19 pandemic is \nmoving rapidly and expansively throughout Pennsylvania. Vast regions of the \n5 \n \n\nCase: C1a:2s0e- c1v:2-002-c1v3-40 0D4o8c0u-mJEeJn t   #D:o 2c6u-m8 eFnilte 4d7:  0  4F/i0le6d/2 003 P/3a1g/e2 07   o Pf a2g6e P 6a goef I2D5 #:328\nCommonwealth are now under stay-at-home orders, and social distancing the norm \nto prevent the spread of this deadly virus. And yet, Respondents would have us \noffer no substantial relief to Petitioners until the pandemic erupts in our prisons. \nWe reject this notion. Since “[a] remedy for unsafe conditions need not await a \ntragic event,” it is evident that the Petitioners have standing in this matter. Id.  \nB. Temporary Restraining Order \ni.  Legal Standard  \nCourts apply one standard when considering whether to issue interim \ninjunctive relief, regardless of whether a petitioner requests a temporary restraining \norder (“TRO”) or preliminary injunction. See Ellakkany v. Common Pleas Court of \nMontgomery Cnty., 658 Fed.Appx. 25, 27 (3d Cir. July 27, 2016) (applying one \nstandard to a motion for both a TRO and preliminary injunction). “A plaintiff \nseeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the \nmerits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary \nrelief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the \npublic interest.” Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., 695 F.3d 1370, 1373–74 \n(Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20, \n129 S. Ct. 365 (2008)). \nThe Supreme Court has emphasized that “a preliminary injunction is an \nextraordinary and drastic remedy, one that should not be granted unless the \n6 \n \n\nCase: C1a:2s0e- c1v:2-002-c1v3-40 0D4o8c0u-mJEeJn t   #D:o 2c6u-m8 eFnilte 4d7:  0  4F/i0le6d/2 003 P/3a1g/e2 08   o Pf a2g6e P 7a goef I2D5 #:329\nmovant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.” Mazurek v. \nArmstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997); Apotex Inc. v. U.S. Food and Drug Admin., \n508 F.Supp.2d 78, 82 (D.D.C. 2007) (“Because interim injunctive relief is an \nextraordinary form of judicial relief, courts should grant such relief sparingly.”). \n“Awarding preliminary relief, therefore, is only appropriate ‘upon a clear showing \nthat the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.’” Groupe SEC USA, Inc. v. Euro–Pro \nOperating LLC, 774 F.3d 192, 197 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 22). \nii.  Irreparable Harm \nTo succeed on their Motion, Petitioners “must demonstrate. . .the probability \nof irreparable harm if relief is not granted.” Frank’s GMC Truck Center, Inc. v. \nGeneral Motors Corp., 847 F.2d 100, 102 (3d Cir. 1988) (internal quotations \nomitted). “In order to demonstrate irreparable harm the plaintiff must demonstrate \npotential harm which cannot be redressed by a legal or an equitable remedy \nfollowing a trial”. . .the temporary restraining order. . .“must be the only way of \nprotecting the plaintiff from harm.” Instant Air Freight Co. v. C.F. Air Freight, \nInc., 882 F.2d 797, 801 (3d Cir. 1989). The moving party must demonstrate that it \nis likely to suffer “actual or imminent harm which cannot otherwise be \ncompensated by money damages,” or it “fail[s] to sustain its substantial burden of \nshowing irreparable harm.” Frank’s GMC, 847 F.2d at 103. The mere risk of injury \nis insufficient. The moving party must establish that the harm is imminent and \n7 \n \n\nCase: C1a:2s0e- c1v:2-002-c1v3-40 0D4o8c0u-mJEeJn t   #D:o 2c6u-m8 eFnilte 4d7:  0  4F/i0le6d/2 003 P/3a1g/e2 09   o Pf a2g6e P 8a goef I2D5 #:330\nprobable. Anderson v. Davila, 125 F.3d 148, 164 (3d Cir. 1997). Additionally, “a \nshowing of irreparable harm is insufficient if the harm will occur only in the \nindefinite future. Rather, the moving party must make a clear showing of \nimmediate irreparable harm.” Campbell Soup Co. v. ConAgra, Inc., 977 F.2d 86, \n91 (3d Cir. 1992). \nThe Petitioners’ claim is rooted in imminent, irreparable harm. Petitioners \nface the inexorable progression of a global pandemic creeping across our nation—a \npandemic to which they are particularly vulnerable due to age and underlying \nmedical conditions. At this point, it is not a matter of if COVID-19 will enter \nPennsylvania prisons, but when it is finally detected therein. It is not unlikely that \nCOVID-19 is already present in some county prisons—we have before us \ndeclarations that portions of the Facilities have been put under ineffective \nquarantines due to the presence of symptoms similar to COVID-19 among the \ninmate population.4 Indeed, we also have reports that a correctional officer at Pike \nhas already tested positive for COVID-19. (Doc. 33 at 1). \nPublic health officials now acknowledge that there is little that can be done \nto stop the spread of COVID-19 absent effective quarantines and social distancing \nprocedures. But Petitioners are unable to keep socially distant while detained by \n                                                           \n4   We also have allegations that prison guards have shown symptoms while interacting with \ninmates. \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1C:a2s0e-c 1v:-2002-1c3v4-0 D04o8cu0m-JeEnJt   # D: o2c6u-8m Feinlet d4:7 0  4 F/0il6e/d2 00 3P/a3g1e/2 100    oPfa 2g6e  P9a ogfe 2ID5 #:331\nICE and cannot keep the detention facilities sufficiently clean to combat the spread \nof the virus.  Based upon the nature of the virus, the allegations of current \nconditions in the prisons, and Petitioners’ specific medical concerns, detailed \nbelow, we therefore find that Petitioners face a very real risk of serious, lasting \nillness or death. There can be no injury more irreparable.    \na.  Seriousness of the virus \nCOVID-19 is a type of highly contagious novel coronavirus that is thought \nto be “spreading easily and sustainably in the community.” 5 Experts believe that it \ncan live on some surfaces for up to 72 hours after contact with an infected person.6 \nA simple sneeze or brush of the face without washing your hands is now known to \neasily spread the virus, which generally causes fever, cough, and shortness of \nbreath. (How Coronavirus Spreads, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL; Doc. 12 at \n15).  \nIn most people, these symptoms are relatively mild. (Doc. 12 at 15). \nHowever, the effects of COVID-19 can be drastically more severe in older \nindividuals or those with medical conditions. (Doc.2, Ex. 2). In some cases, \nCOVID-19 can cause serious, potentially permanent, damage to lung tissue, and \n                                                           \n5   How Coronavirus Spreads, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/transmission.html (last accessed March 31, \n2020). \n6   New Coronavirus Stable for Hours on Surfaces, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH (March \n17, 2020), https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/new-coronavirus-stable-hours-\nsurfaces. \n9 \n \n\nCase: C1a:2s0e- c1v:2-002-c1v3-40 0D4o8c0u-mJEeJn t   #D:o 2c6u-m8 eFnilte 4d7:  0  4F/i0le6d/2 003 P/3a1g/e2 01 1   Poaf g2e6  1P0a goef I2D5 #:332\ncan require extensive use of a ventilator.

Id. The same rationale \napplies, perhaps even more so, to immigration detention facilities housing high-\nrisk populations. \nc.  Unique nature of detention facilities \nVarious public health officials have warned that the nature of ICE detention \nfacilities makes them uniquely vulnerable to the rapid spread of highly contagious \ndiseases like COVID-19. COVID-19 is transmitted primarily through “close contact \nvia respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.” (Doc. \n12 at 18; Doc. 2, Ex. 1). Immigration detention facilities are particularly at risk for \nsuch close contact because they are considered “congregate settings, or places where \n \npeople live or sleep in close proximity.” (Doc. 2, Ex. 1). Such conditions provide \n“ideal incubation conditions” for COVID-19. (Id.).  \nWithin the past few weeks, two medical experts for the Department of \nHomeland Security authored a letter to Congress warning of the unique dangers \nCOVID-19 poses to ICE detention facilities. Specifically, they described the current \nICE detention environment as a “tinderbox” in which: \n12 \n \n\nCase: C1a:2s0e- c1v:2-002-c1v3-40 0D4o8c0u-mJEeJn t   #D:o 2c6u-m8 eFnilte 4d7:  0  4F/i0le6d/2 003 P/3a1g/e2 01 4   Poaf g2e6  1P3a goef I2D5 #:335\n[a]s local hospital systems become overwhelmed by the \npatient  flow  from  detention  center  outbreaks,  precious \nhealth resources will be less available for people in the \ncommunity. . .To be more explicit, a detention center with \na rapid outbreak could result in multiple detainees — five, \nten or more — being sent to the local community hospital \nwhere there may only be six or eight ventilators over a \nvery short period. . .As [hospitals] fill up and overwhelm \nthe ventilator resources, those ventilators are unavailable \nwhen the infection inevitably is carried by staff to the \ncommunity  and  are  also  unavailable  for  all  the  usual \ncritical illnesses (heart attacks, trauma, etc).12 \nThe experts contrasted this scenario with a situation in which ICE detainees were \nreleased from “high risk congregate settings,” allowing the “volume of patients sent \nto community hospitals to level out,” which they believed would provide much more \nfavorable outcomes, both for the detainees and the surrounding communities. Id. “At \na minimum,” these health experts urged, the government “should consider releasing \nall detainees in high risk medical groups such as older people and those with chronic \ndiseases.” Id. ICE detention facilities, they warned, are so poorly equipped to allow \nsafe social distancing practices and are unlikely to have the ability to provide \nadequate medical care in the case of a COVID-19 outbreak. Id. The consequences, \nthey maintain, could be disastrous. Id. \n                                                           \n12   Catherine E. Shoichet, Doctors warn of 'tinderbox scenario' if coronavirus spreads in \nICE detention, CNN, https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/20/health/doctors-ice-detention-coronavirus/ \n(last accessed March 28, 2020). \n \n13 \n \n\nCase: C1a:2s0e- c1v:2-002-c1v3-40 0D4o8c0u-mJEeJn t   #D:o 2c6u-m8 eFnilte 4d7:  0  4F/i0le6d/2 003 P/3a1g/e2 01 5   Poaf g2e6  1P4a goef I2D5 #:336\nIndeed, we have before us declarations stating that such high-risk conditions \nare present in the detention facilities at issue in this case. Both Petitioners and \nlawyers familiar with the ICE facilities at issue here have attested to overcrowding \nthat makes social distancing impossible at all three facilities. At the York facility, for \nexample, inmates are housed in dormitory-style conditions, in which 60 people \nreside in each housing block. (Doc. 2, Ex. 18). That space is used for both eating and \nsleeping. (Id.). Petitioners report that not even the medical staff wear gloves when in \ncontact with inmates. (Doc. 2, Ex. 11). Detainees must eat their meals four-to-a-\ntable, with approximately three feet of space between individuals. (Id.).  \nAt Clinton, inmate bunks are often less than two feet apart, and inmate \ndeclarations show that it is difficult to keep more than a two feet distance between \ninmates, let alone the recommended six feet. (Doc. 2, Ex. 10). The laundry facilities \nat Clinton are also reported to be chronically broken, preventing detainees from \nkeeping their clothes and bedding clean. (Id.). Indeed, for a total of 72 men, Clinton \nprovides only four sets of sinks and showers. (Id.). The Facility is also reported to \nhave bugs mice, and rats, which add to the unsanitary conditions experienced by \ndetainees. (Id.). \nAt Pike, detainees share eight-by-ten or twelve foot cells with two other men. \n(Doc. 2, Ex. 13). Those cells also contain a sink and a shower. (Id). Some men at \nPike report being forced to share cells with other individuals currently exhibiting \n14 \n \n\nCase: C1a:2s0e- c1v:2-002-c1v3-40 0D4o8c0u-mJEeJn t   #D:o 2c6u-m8 eFnilte 4d7:  0  4F/i0le6d/2 003 P/3a1g/e2 01 6   Poaf g2e6  1P5a goef I2D5 #:337\nCOVID-19 symptoms or report exhibiting symptoms themselves while housed with \nother inmates. (Doc. 2, Exs. 3; 4; 8). Inmates at Pike are also usually forced to \nremain within two feet of other individuals, even while in the common areas of the \nfacility. (Doc. 2, Ex. 4). They are also required to buy their own soap, are not given \nhand sanitizer, and are forced to share cleaning supplies with an entire block of cells. \n(Doc. 2, Exs. 3; 13).  \nICE guidance states that these types of risks are mitigated by quarantining \ndetainees with symptoms and by housing those with a higher risk of exposure \nseparately from the rest of the detainee population. (Doc. 2, Ex. 1). The Respondents \nfurther proffer that the Facilities are practicing “cohorting,” an “infection prevention \nstrategy which involves housing detainees together who were exposed to a person \nwith an infectious organism but are asymptomatic.” (Doc. 35 at 12). This practice is \nmeant to last for fourteen days, the duration of the virus’s incubation period. The \nPetitioner’s declarations, however, show that these practices are not being followed. \nAt least two Petitioners aver that they are experiencing symptoms and have not been \nisolated from other individuals. (Doc. 2, Exs. 3; 4; 8). Furthermore, all Petitioners \nhave a higher risk of exposure, and none have been moved to separate housing. \nIndeed, it does not even seem that ICE is providing detainees with proper \ninformation on how they can combat the virus on their own. (Doc. 2, Ex. 3). \nTroublingly, some facilities seem to have shut off detainee access to news outlets, \n15 \n \n\nCase: C1a:2s0e- c1v:2-002-c1v3-40 0D4o8c0u-mJEeJn t   #D:o 2c6u-m8 eFnilte 4d7:  0  4F/i0le6d/2 003 P/3a1g/e2 01 7   Poaf g2e6  1P6a goef I2D5 #:338\nthereby preventing the detention facility’s population from informing themselves on \nbest practices to prevent transmission.

Petitioners are at uniquely high risk for contracting \nCOVID-19  \nNot only are the Facilities themselves uniquely suited to rapidly spread \nCOVID-19, but also Petitioners themselves are members of high-risk groups that are \nlikely to feel the effects of the virus more keenly than the average individual.13 Each \nof the Petitioners before us has an underlying medical condition that heightens their \nrisk of serious COVID-19 effects, among them asthma, diabetes, heart conditions, \nhepatitis, and immunocompromising conditions such as leukemia and organ \ntransplants.  \ne.  The threat to high-risk individuals posed by \nCOVID-19 constitutes irreparable injury \nVarious courts across the nation have found that COVID-19, coupled with the \nlack of hygiene and overcrowding present in detention facilities, will pose a greatly \nheightened risk to inmates.

At least one court has ordered \nthe release on bail of an inmate facing extradition on the basis of the risk the \npandemic poses to his health. Matter of Extradition of Toledo Manrique, No. 19 \nMJ 71055, 2020 WL 1307109, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 19, 2020) (“These are \nextraordinary times. The novel coronavirus that began in Wuhan, China, is now a \npandemic. The nine counties in the San Francisco Bay Area have imposed shelter-\nin-place orders in an effort to slow the spread of the contagion. This Court has \ntemporarily halted jury trials, even in criminal cases, and barred the public from \ncourthouses. Against this background, Alejandro Toledo has moved for release, \narguing that at 74 years old he is at risk of serious illness or death if he remains in \ncustody. The Court is persuaded. The risk that this vulnerable person will contract \nCOVID-19 while in jail is a special circumstance that warrants bail.”).  \nIndeed, courts have even specifically held that COVID-19 constitutes an \nirreparable harm that supports the grant of a TRO. See Vasif “Vincent” Basank, et \nal v. Decker, 2020 WL 1481503 at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y.

Cadman Towers, \nInc., 51 F.3d 328, 332 (2d Cir. 1995) (finding irreparable harm “premised ... upon \n[the district court’s] finding that [Petitioner] was subject to risk of injury, infection, \nand humiliation”); Mayer v. Wing, 922 F. Supp. 902, 909 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (“[T]he \ndeprivation of life-sustaining medical services. . .certainly constitutes irreparable \nharm.”). \nThe painful new reality is that we are constantly at risk of contracting a deadly \nvirus and are experiencing previously unimagined safety measures to stop its spread. \nThis virus spares no demographic or race and is ruthless in its assault. The \nprecautions being adopted to stop it should apply equally, if not more so, to the most \nvulnerable among us. Petitioners have shown that adequate measures are not in place \nand cannot be taken to protect them from COVID-19 in the detention facilities, and \nthat catastrophic results may ensue, both to Petitioners and to the communities \nsurrounding the Facilities. We therefore find that the likely irreparable injury to \nPetitioners, as high-risk individuals, satisfies the first element of our TRO analysis.    \niii.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nPetitioners argue that their continued incarceration in ICE detention facilities \nexposes them to serious risks associated with COVID-19 which violate their due \n19 \n \n\nCase: C1a:2s0e- c1v:2-002-c1v3-40 0D4o8c0u-mJEeJn t   #D:o 2c6u-m8 eFnilte 4d7:  0  4F/i0le6d/2 003 P/3a1g/e2 02 1   Poaf g2e6  2P0a goef I2D5 #:342\nprocess rights. (Doc. 2 at 27). We find that Petitioners are likely to succeed on the \nmerits of their claim.14  \nTo bring a Fifth Amendment due process claim, Petitioners must show that \ntheir conditions of confinement “amount[ed] to punishment of the detainee.” Bell \nv. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 (1979). “To determine whether challenged \nconditions of confinement amount to punishment, this Court determines whether a \ncondition of confinement is reasonably related to a legitimate governmental \nobjective; if it is not, we may infer ‘that the purpose of the governmental action is \npunishment that may not be constitutionally inflicted upon detainees qua \ndetainees.’” E. D. v. Sharkey, 928 F.3d 299, 307 (3d Cir. 2019) (quoting Hubbard \nv. Taylor, 538 F.3d 229, 232 (3d Cir. 2008)). In other words, we must ascertain \nwhether the conditions serve a legitimate purpose and whether the conditions are \nrationally related to that legitimate purpose. Hubbard 538 F.3d at 232. \nConsidering the Facility conditions previously discussed, we can see no \nrational relationship between a legitimate government objective and keeping \nPetitioners detained in unsanitary, tightly-packed environments—doing so would \n                                                           \n14   The Respondents argue that Petitioners do not have a legitimate due process claim \nbecause they have no “liberty or property interest” in a purely “discretionary grant of \nhumanitarian parole.” (Doc. 35 at 28). We disagree. “Unsanitary, unsafe, or otherwise inadequate \nconditions” are sufficient to state a Due Process Claim and we shall thus proceed with our \nanalysis. Petty v. Nutter, No. 15-3430, 2016 WL 7018538, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 30, 2016); Grohs \nv. Lanigan, No. 16-7083, 2019 WL 1500621, at *11 (D.N.J. Apr. 5, 2019) (“extreme heat \ncombined with lack of potable water, as well as generally unsanitary conditions” are sufficient to \nstate a conditions-of-confinement claim). \n20 \n \n\nCase: C1a:2s0e- c1v:2-002-c1v3-40 0D4o8c0u-mJEeJn t   #D:o 2c6u-m8 eFnilte 4d7:  0  4F/i0le6d/2 003 P/3a1g/e2 02 2   Poaf g2e6  2P1a goef I2D5 #:343\nconstitute a punishment to Petitioners. Despite the Respondents’ protests to the \ncontrary, we need not find that the Facilities had the “express intent” to punish \nPetitioners with the conditions alleged. (Doc. 35 at 37). Instead we ask whether the \nconditions are rationally related to a legitimate government objective. Hubbard 538 \nF.3d at 232. Here, they are not.  \nThe Respondents maintain that “preventing detained aliens from absconding \nand ensuring that they appear for removal proceedings is a legitimate governmental \nobjective.” (Doc. 35 at 38). They cite a great deal of authority supporting this point, \nand we do not disagree. (Id.). However, we cannot find that unsanitary conditions, \nwhich include overcrowding and a high risk of COVID-19 transmission, are \nrationally related to that legitimate government objective.  \nSocial distancing and proper hygiene are the only effective means by which \nwe can stop the spread of COVID-19. Petitioners have shown that, despite their best \nefforts, they cannot practice these effective preventative measures in the Facilities. \nConsidering, therefore, the grave consequences that will result from an outbreak of \nCOVID-19, particularly to the high-risk Petitioners in this case, we cannot \ncountenance physical detention in such tightly-confined, unhygienic spaces.  \nThe global COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing public health crisis now \nfaced by American society have forced us all to find new ways of operating that \nprevent virus transmission to the greatest extent possible. We expect no less of ICE. \n21 \n \n\nCase: C1a:2s0e- c1v:2-002-c1v3-40 0D4o8c0u-mJEeJn t   #D:o 2c6u-m8 eFnilte 4d7:  0  4F/i0le6d/2 003 P/3a1g/e2 02 3   Poaf g2e6  2P2a goef I2D5 #:344\nWe note that ICE has a plethora of means other than physical detention at their \ndisposal by which they may monitor civil detainees and ensure that they are present \nat removal proceedings, including remote monitoring and routine check-ins. \nPhysical detention itself will place a burden on community healthcare systems and \nwill needlessly endanger Petitioners, prison employees, and the greater community. \nWe cannot see the rational basis of such a risk.15 \nWe therefore find that Petitioners are likely to succeed on the merits of their \ndue process claim that their conditions of confinement expose them “to serious risks \nassociated with COVID-19.” (Doc. 2 at 35). \n                                                           \n15   Moreover, not only have Petitioners established a likelihood of success on the merits on \ntheir Fifth Amendment claim, but, in fact, they have also demonstrated that their claim is likely \nto be successful under the more exacting Eighth Amendment standards as well. To succeed in \nproving that conditions of confinement violate the Eighth Amendment, a plaintiff must show: (1) \nthe deprivation alleged must objectively be “sufficiently serious,” and (2) the “prison official \nmust have a sufficiently culpable state of mind,” such as deliberate indifference to the prisoner’s \nhealth or safety. See Thomas v. Tice, 948 F.3d 133, 138 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Farmer v. \nBrennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994)). COVID-19 has been shown to spread in the matter of a \nsingle day and would well prove deadly for Petitioners. Such a risk is objectively “sufficiently \nserious.” Furthermore, the Supreme Court has recognized authorities can be “deliberately \nindifferent to an inmate’s current health problems” where they “ignore a condition of \nconfinement that is sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering the next \nweek or month or year,” including “exposure of inmates to a serious, communicable disease,” \neven when “the complaining inmate shows no serious current symptoms.” Helling v. McKinney, \n509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993). There is no requirement that Petitioners show that “they actually \nsuffered from serious injuries” to succeed on this claim. See Helling, 509 U.S. at 33. Instead, if \nPetitioners can show that the conditions “pose an unreasonable risk of serious damage to their \nfuture health,” they may succeed on their claim. Helling, 509 U.S.at 35) (alteration omitted). The \ncurrent measures undertaken by ICE, including “cohorting” detainees, are patently ineffective in \npreventing the spread of COVID-19. Indeed, we now have reports of a positive test amongst the \nemployees at Pike County prison, thereby greatly increasing the likelihood that COVID-19 is \npresent in the prison population.  \n \n22 \n \n\nCase: C1a:2s0e- c1v:2-002-c1v3-40 0D4o8c0u-mJEeJn t   #D:o 2c6u-m8 eFnilte 4d7:  0  4F/i0le6d/2 003 P/3a1g/e2 02 4   Poaf g2e6  2P3a goef I2D5 #:345\niv.  Balancing of the Equities and Public Interest \nThe equities at issue and public interest weigh heavily in Petitioners’ favor. \nFirst, and as described, Petitioners face irreparable harm to both their constitutional \nrights and their health. Second, we find that the potential harm to the Respondents is \nlimited. While we understand and agree that preventing Petitioners from absconding \nand ensuring their presence at immigration proceedings is important, we note that \nPetitioners’ failure to appear at future immigration proceedings would carry grave \nconsequences of which Petitioners are surely aware. Further, it is our view that the \nrisk of absconding is low, given the current restricted state of travel in the United \nStates and the world during the COVID-19 pandemic.   \n  Finally, the public interest favors Petitioners’ release. As mentioned, \nPetitioners are being detained for civil violations of this country’s immigration laws. \nGiven the highly unusual and unique circumstances posed by the COVID-19 \npandemic and ensuing crisis, “the continued detention of aging or ill civil detainees \ndoes not serve the public’s interest.” Basank, 2020 WL 1481503, *6; see also \nFraihat v. U.S. Imm. and Customs Enforcement, 5:19 Civ. 1546, ECF No. 81-11 \n(C.D. Cal. Mar. 24, 2020) (opining that “the design and operation of detention \nsettings promotes the spread of communicable diseases such as COVID-19”); \nCastillo v. Barr, CV-20-00605-TJH (C.D. Cal. 2020). Efforts to stop the spread of \nCOVID-19 and promote public health are clearly in the public’s best interest, and \n23 \n \n\nCase: C1a:2s0e- c1v:2-002-c1v3-40 0D4o8c0u-mJEeJn t   #D:o 2c6u-m8 eFnilte 4d7:  0  4F/i0le6d/2 003 P/3a1g/e2 02 5   Poaf g2e6  2P4a goef I2D5 #:346\nthe release of these fragile Petitioners from confinement is one step further in a \npositive direction. \nIII.  CONCLUSION \n  In times such as these, we must acknowledge that the status quo of a mere \nfew weeks ago no longer applies. Our world has been altered with lightning \nspeed, and the results are both unprecedented and ghastly. We now face a global \npandemic in which the actions of each individual can have a drastic impact on an \nentire community. The choices we now make must reflect this new reality.  \nRespondents’ Facilities are plainly not equipped to protect Petitioners from \na potentially fatal exposure to COVID-19. While this deficiency is neither \nintentional nor malicious, should we fail to afford relief to Petitioners we will be \na party to an unconscionable and possibly barbaric result. Our Constitution and \nlaws apply equally to the most vulnerable among us, particularly when matters of \npublic health are at issue. This is true even for those who have lost a measure of \ntheir freedom. If we are to remain the civilized society we hold ourselves out to \nbe, it would be heartless and inhumane not to recognize Petitioners’ plight. And \nso we will act.  \nBased on the foregoing, we shall grant the requested temporary restraining \norder.  Respondents, and the York County Prison, Clinton County Correctional \nFacility and Pike County Correctional Facility shall be ordered to immediately \n24 \n \n\nCase: C1a:2s0e- c1v:2-002-c1v3-40 0D4o8c0u-mJEeJn t   #D:o 2c6u-m8 eFnilte 4d7:  0  4F/i0le6d/2 003 P/3a1g/e2 02 6   Poaf g2e6  2P5a goef I2D5 #:347\nrelease the Petitioners today on their own recognizance without fail.  \nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT: \n1.

The spread of COVID-19 is a global crisis, a crisis \n19  that is heightened in the most vulnerable groups among us.  One such group is before us today.  \n20  Plaintiffs, two classes of inmates incarcerated in California state prisons, have filed a motion \n21  asking us to order the state to release an unspecified, but significant, number of prisoners so that \n22  the prison population can be reduced to a level sufficient to allow physical distancing to prevent \n23  the spread of COVID-19—which, in Plaintiffs’ view, requires that prisoners who live in dorm-\n24  style environments be housed six feet apart from one another.  ECF No. 3219/6522.1   \n25  While we cannot know with certainty due to the pathogenesis of the virus, it appears that \n26 \n \n27 \n1 All filings in this Three-Judge Court are included in the individual docket sheets of both Plata v. \nNewsom, No. 01-cv-01351-JST (N.D.

Thus far, only thirteen inmates have \n2  confirmed cases of the disease.  Cal. Dep’t of Corr. & Rehab., Population COVID-19 Tracking, \n3  https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/covid19/population-status-tracking/ (last visited Apr. 4, 2020).  And, to \n4  their credit, Defendants2 have already taken steps to combat the virus, including taking measures \n5  to reduce the prison population.  But given the undisputed risk of further contagion in a carceral \n6  environment,3 Plaintiffs’ desire to maximize the reduction in the state’s prison population is \n7  understandable.   \n8  We conclude, however, that under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) and the Prison \n9  Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3626, Plaintiffs’ emergency motion for relief based \n10  on COVID-19 is not properly before us.  This three-judge court was first convened in 2007 to \n11  consider a different issue: whether a release of prisoners was necessary to remedy California’s \n12  structural failure to provide constitutionally adequate medical and mental health care services to \n13  inmates incarcerated in the state’s prisons.  We are therefore bound to deny Plaintiffs’ motion.  \n14  However, we do so without prejudice to Plaintiffs’ seeking relief in a procedurally appropriate \n15  forum, including the individual Coleman and/or Plata courts. \n \n16  I.  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n17    A.  Procedural History \n18  Given the exigency of the circumstances before us, we provide only a brief procedural \n19  history here.4  The proceedings before this three-judge court began long ago as two separate cases:  \n20  Coleman, filed in 1990 in the Eastern District of California, alleged that Defendants were failing \n21  to provide constitutionally adequate mental health care services to inmates with serious mental \n22  disorders.  Plata, filed in 2001 in the Northern District of California, alleged that Defendants were \n23 \n \n2 Defendants are various California state officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom. \n24 \n \n3 See, e.g., 167 Inmates at Cook County Jail Confirmed Positive for COVID-19, Chi. Sun Times \n25 \n(Apr. 1, 2020), https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/4/1/21203767/cook-county-jail-\ncoronavirus-positive-covid-19 (reporting that 167 pre-trial detainees housed at the Cook County, \n26 \nIll. jail tested positive for COVID-19 over a ten-day span). \n \n27 \n4 The history of these proceedings is chronicled more thoroughly in a 2009 order of our court, \nColeman v. Schwarzenegger, 922 F. Supp. 2d 882 (E.D. Cal./N.D. Cal. 2009), and the Supreme \n28 \nCourt’s decision in Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493 (2011). \n2 \n\nCaseC: a1s:2e0 4-c:0v1-0-c2v1-3041 3D5o1c-uJSmTe n  tD #o: c2u6m-9e nFti l3e2d6: 10 4  /F06ile/2d0 0 P4a/0g4e/ 240 o  f  P1a6g Pea 3g eoIfD 1 5#:351\n \n1  failing to provide constitutionally adequate medical care.   \n2  The individual Coleman and Plata courts entered numerous remedial orders, including \n3  appointing a Special Master to oversee remedial efforts in Coleman and a Receiver to take control \n4  of the medical care delivery system in Plata.  These measures failed to cure the constitutional \n5  deficiencies, and in 2007, both courts concluded that, absent a reduction in the state prison \n6  population—which was then almost double the prison system’s design capacity—Defendants \n7  would never be able to deliver constitutionally adequate medical and mental health care. \n8  Because they were not individually empowered to order a release of prisoners from \n9  California’s prisons, the Plata and Coleman courts granted Plaintiffs’ separate motions to convene \n10  a three-judge court to consider the issue.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3)(B) (providing that a prisoner \n11  release order can be entered only by a three-judge court).  The Chief Judge of the United States \n12  Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit appointed this three-judge court in both cases to determine \n13  whether a release order was appropriate.5  See Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 500 (2011) \n14  (“Because the two cases are interrelated, their limited consolidation for this purpose has a certain \n15  utility in avoiding conflicting decrees and aiding judicial consideration and enforcement.”). \n \n16    After holding a fourteen-day trial, we concluded that a significant reduction in the state \n17  prison population was the only way to bring Defendants into compliance with their constitutional \n18  obligations to provide adequate medical and mental health care services.  See generally Coleman \n19  v. Schwarzenegger, 922 F. Supp. 2d 882 (E.D. Cal./N.D. Cal. 2009) (“Coleman I”).  We therefore \n20  ordered Defendants to reduce California’s prison population to 137.5% design capacity within two \n21  years.  Id. at 970. \n22    Defendants appealed, and the Supreme Court affirmed.6  Plata, 563 U.S. 493.  The Court \n23  held that the PLRA’s requirements for entering a prisoner release order were satisfied, see 18 \n24 \n \n25 \n5 The original members of the three-judge court, the Hon. Stephen Reinhardt, Circuit Judge; the \nHon. Lawrence K. Karlton, District Judge; and the Hon. Thelton E. Henderson, District Judge,  \n26 \nhave since been replaced by its current members: the Hon. Kim McLane Wardlaw, Circuit Judge; \nthe Hon. Kimberly J. Mueller, Chief District Judge; and the Hon. Jon S. Tigar, District Judge. \n27 \n \n6 By statute, a three-judge district court order granting a permanent injunction may be appealed \n28 \ndirectly to the Supreme Court.  28 U.S.C. § 1253. \n3 \n\nCaseC: a1s:2e0 4-c:0v1-0-c2v1-3041 3D5o1c-uJSmTe n  tD #o: c2u6m-9e nFti l3e2d6: 10 4  /F06ile/2d0 0 P4a/0g4e/ 250 o  f  P1a6g Pea 4g eoIfD 1 5#:352\n \n1  U.S.C. § 3626, and that there was ample evidence supporting our conclusion that crowding was \n2  the primary cause of the constitutional violations in California’s delivery of medical and mental \n3  health services in its prison system.  Plata, 563 U.S. at 517–530.  It also concluded that the \n4  137.5% population cap we ordered was “narrowly drawn, extend[ed] no further than necessary to \n5  correct the violation of [the] federal right, and [was] the least intrusive means necessary to correct \n6  the violation,” and that we gave appropriate “substantial weight” to public safety, as the PLRA \n7  requires.  Id. at 530–41; see 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a).  At the same time, the Supreme Court \n8  recognized our ability to modify our remedial order as necessary: \n \n9  The  three-judge  court,  however,  retains  the  authority,  and  the \nresponsibility, to make further amendments to the existing order or \n10  any modified decree it may enter as warranted by the exercise of its \nsound discretion.  “The power of a court of equity to modify a decree \n11  of injunctive relief is long-established, broad, and flexible.”  New \nYork State Assn. for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Carey, 706 F.2d 956, \n12  967 (C.A.2 1983) (Friendly, J.).  A court that invokes equity’s power \nto  remedy  a  constitutional  violation  by  an  injunction  mandating \n13  systemic  changes  to  an  institution  has  the  continuing  duty  and \nresponsibility to assess the efficacy and consequences of its order.  Id., \n14  at 969–971.  Experience may teach the necessity for modification or \namendment of an earlier decree.  To that end, the three-judge court \n  15  must remain open to a showing or demonstration by either party that \nthe injunction should be altered to ensure that the rights and interests \n16  of the parties are given all due and necessary protection. \n17  Plata, 563 U.S. at 542–43.   \n18    Two years after the Supreme Court affirmed our prison population reduction order, \n19  Defendants asked us to terminate that order even though they had not yet complied with it.  \n20  Coleman v. Brown, 922 F. Supp. 2d 1004, 1008 (E.D. Cal./N.D. Cal. 2013) (“Coleman II”).  \n21  Plaintiffs filed a cross-motion asking us to impose institution-specific population caps to \n22  supplement the system-wide 137.5% cap that we had already ordered.  Id.  We denied both \n23  requests.  Id.  We concluded, among other things, that Defendants had failed to demonstrate that \n24  they could provide constitutionally adequate medical and mental health care with a prison \n25  population that exceeded 137.5% design capacity.  Id. at 1034–43.  At the same time, we \n26  concluded that Plaintiffs’ request for institution-specific caps was premature because, until \n27  Defendants met the systemwide 137.5% cap, it was difficult to determine whether additional relief \n28  was necessary.  Id. at 1048. \n4 \n\nCaseC: a1s:2e0 4-c:0v1-0-c2v1-3041 3D5o1c-uJSmTe n  tD #o: c2u6m-9e nFti l3e2d6: 10 4  /F06ile/2d0 0 P4a/0g4e/ 260 o  f  P1a6g Pea 5g eoIfD 1 5#:353\n \n1    In 2015, Defendants succeeded, for the first time, in reducing the statewide prison \n2  population to less than 137.5% design capacity.  The population has remained below that \n3  benchmark ever since.7  Since that time, we have largely stepped back as the individual Coleman \n4  and Plata courts have continued to work to ensure that California provides constitutionally \n5  adequate medical and mental health services to its inmates. \n6    B.  Plaintiffs’ Emergency Motion Based on COVID-19 \n7    On March 25, 2020, Plaintiffs filed the motion currently before us, which they have styled \n8  as an “Emergency Motion to Modify Population Reduction Order.”  ECF No. 3219/6522.  The \n9  motion asks us to order Defendants to release to parole or post-release community supervision \n10  certain categories of inmates, including those who are scheduled to parole within a year and are \n11  either (a) low risk, as determined by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation’s \n12  (CDCR) risk assessment tool or (b) serving time for a non-violent offense.  Id. at 27.  Plaintiffs \n13  also ask us to require Defendants to release or relocate inmates who, because of their age or other \n14  medical conditions, are at a high risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19.  Id. at 27–28.  \n15  While Plaintiffs have not put forth a specific number of inmates that they believe should be \n \n16  released, they argued at the April 2, 2020 telephonic hearing on this motion that Defendants must \n17  release as many inmates as would be required to allow all remaining inmates to practice physical \n18  distancing, especially those who reside in crowded dorm housing.   \n19    Although the current record is unclear as to when Defendants began planning a response to \n20  COVID-19, they started implementing preventive measures at least as of March 11, 2020, when \n21  normal visiting at CDCR institutions was canceled statewide, fact sheets and posters on the \n22  pandemic were delivered to the inmate population, and additional hand-sanitizing dispenser \n23  stations were ordered.  ECF No. 3241-1/6553-1.  CDCR has activated “a centrally-located \n24  command center where CDCR and CCHCS [California Correctional Health Care Services] experts \n25  monitor information, prepare for known and unknown events, and exchange information centrally \n26 \n \n27 \n7 As of the most recent status report filed with us on March 16, 2020, California’s prison \npopulation is at 134.4% design capacity.  ECF No. 3213/6502 at 2. \n28 \n \n5 \n\nCaseC: a1s:2e0 4-c:0v1-0-c2v1-3041 3D5o1c-uJSmTe n  tD #o: c2u6m-9e nFti l3e2d6: 10 4  /F06ile/2d0 0 P4a/0g4e/ 270 o  f  P1a6g Pea 6g eoIfD 1 5#:354\n \n1  in order to make decisions and provide guidance quickly.”  ECF No. 3240/6553-2 ¶ 4 (Gipson \n2  Decl.).  The center’s “goal is to implement measures and strategies to protect inmates and staff \n3  during the COVID-19 pandemic and to enhance social distancing and housing options during this \n4  time.”  Id. \n5  On March 24, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order \n6  directing CDCR to suspend admission of inmates to state custody for 30 days, with the possibility \n7  that the suspension would be extended for an additional 30 days.  ECF No. 3241/6553 ¶ 4 (Diaz \n8  Decl.).  On March 30, 2020, CDCR Secretary Ralph Diaz announced that release would be \n9  accelerated for inmates who have less than sixty days remaining on their sentence, are not serving \n10  a term of incarceration for a violent felony or a domestic violence offense, and are not required to \n11  register as a sex offender.  Id. ¶ 5.  These last two measures are expected to result in an \n12  approximately 6,500-person reduction in the prison population over the coming weeks.8  Id. ¶¶ 4–\n13  7.   \n14    Defendants oppose Plaintiffs’ motion, arguing both that their response to COVID-19 so far \n15  has been constitutionally sufficient, and that the motion is not properly before this three-judge \n \n16  court because the relief it seeks is, in substance, a new prisoner release order, rather than a \n17  modification of our 2009 order imposing the 137.5% population cap.  ECF No. 3235/6552.   \n18  II.  DISCUSSION \n19  Whether Plaintiffs’ motion is properly viewed as a modification request is a critical \n20  question.  For one, it bears on whether the motion is properly before our three-judge court.  But \n21  even if the motion were properly before us, the PLRA places significant restrictions on a federal \n22  court’s authority to order the release of prisoners as a remedy for a constitutional violation.  See 18 \n23  U.S.C. § 3626.  For example, a prisoner release order may be entered only if “(i) a court has \n24  previously entered an order for less intrusive relief that has failed to remedy the deprivation of the \n25  Federal right sought to be remedied through the prisoner release order; and (ii) the defendant has \n26 \n \n8 Defendants have also taken additional steps to combat COVID-19, including but not limited to \n27 \ntransferring approximately 500 inmates out of dorm housing, suspending transfers between \nfacilities, and conducting temperature checks and symptom screenings of all individuals entering \n28 \nthe prisons.  E.g., ECF No. 3240/6553-2 ¶¶ 6–11. \n6 \n\nCaseC: a1s:2e0 4-c:0v1-0-c2v1-3041 3D5o1c-uJSmTe n  tD #o: c2u6m-9e nFti l3e2d6: 10 4  /F06ile/2d0 0 P4a/0g4e/ 280 o  f  P1a6g Pea 7g eoIfD 1 5#:355\n \n1  had a reasonable amount of time to comply with the previous court orders.”  Id. \n2  § 3626(a)(3)(A)(i)–(ii).  Plaintiffs argue that our 2009 order imposing the 137.5% population cap \n3  satisfies the PLRA’s requirement of a prior order for less intrusive relief.  ECF No. 3219/6522 at \n4  31–32.  If, however, the relief they seek is not actually a modification of the 2009 order but rather \n5  new relief based on the new threat of harm posed by COVID-19, Plaintiffs likely cannot satisfy the \n6  prior order requirement at this point because there have not yet been any orders requiring \n7  Defendants to take measures short of release to address the threat of the virus; nor have \n8  Defendants had a reasonable time in which to comply.9 \n9  In arguing that their motion properly seeks to modify our 2009 order imposing the \n10  population cap, Plaintiffs rely on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5), which grants courts \n11  authority to “relieve a party . . . from a final judgment” if “applying it prospectively is no longer \n12  equitable.”  We have previously recognized that Rule 60(b)(5) may provide us with authority to \n13  modify our 2009 order in appropriate circumstances.  Coleman II, 922 F. Supp. 2d at 1025–27 \n14  (citing Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk Cty. Jail, 502 U.S. 367 (1992)).  But we may only modify the \n15  order to the extent necessary to ensure that the remedial structure remains tailored to cure the \n \n16  constitutional violations previously found by the Coleman and Plata courts.  See id. at 1048 \n17  (refusing to modify the 2009 order because it was not yet clear whether the 137.5% design \n18  capacity cap would be sufficient to cure the constitutional defects in Defendants’ prison health \n19  care system).  Rule 60(b)(5) does not provide us with free-standing authority to remedy any harm \n20  Defendants may inflict upon Plaintiffs, regardless of whether it is tethered to the previous findings \n21  of structural constitutional shortcomings in the delivery of medical and mental health care.  Cf. \n22  Parsons v. Ryan, 912 F.3d 486, 501 (9th Cir. 2018) (explaining that a modification of relief was \n23  appropriate because it was not issued “in response to new violations of federal rights”). \n24  Plaintiffs argue that the potential harm posed by COVID-19 is attributable to the \n25  constitutional violations that have been previously found in these cases because “[p]reventing the \n26  spread of a dangerous, contagious illness is plainly a requirement of an adequate medical care \n27 \n \n9 We recognize that what is reasonable in ordinary times may be quite different from what is \n28 \nreasonable in these extraordinary times. \n7 \n\nCaseC: a1s:2e0 4-c:0v1-0-c2v1-3041 3D5o1c-uJSmTe n  tD #o: c2u6m-9e nFti l3e2d6: 10 4  /F06ile/2d0 0 P4a/0g4e/ 290 o  f  P1a6g Pea 8g eoIfD 1 5#:356\n \n1  system.”  ECF No. 3248/6558 at 3–4.  As a general matter, we agree that the Eighth Amendment \n2  requires Defendants to take adequate steps to curb the spread of disease within the prison system.  \n3  Indeed, disease control is one of the areas in which the Plata court previously concluded that \n4  Defendants fell short.  See Coleman I, 922 F. Supp. 2d at 896.  For example, the Plata court \n5  previously found that the prison intake process, “which was designed to allow medical staff to \n6  identify inmates’ medical issues, including communicable diseases, . . . was woefully inadequate.”  \n7  Id. (describing a finding of the Plata court in Plata v. Schwarzenegger, No. 01-1351-TEH, 2005 \n8  WL 2932254, at *12 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 3, 2005)).  It also found that exam tables and counter tops \n9  where prisoners with infectious diseases were treated “were not routinely disinfected or sanitized.”  \n10  See id. at 896 (quoting Plata, 2005 WL 2932253, at *14); see also Plata, 563 U.S. at 508 (citing \n11  this fact in affirming the population cap order).  Still, Defendants’ inability to control disease was \n12  only one symptom of an overall failure to provide inmates with access to constitutionally adequate \n13  health care services. \n14  Here, however, the impetus for the release order Plaintiffs seek is different from the \n15  overarching structural violations underlying the 2009 population reduction order.  The specific \n \n16  harm Plaintiffs allege is not caused by constitutional shortcomings in Defendants’ ability to \n17  provide medical and mental health services.  Indeed, Plaintiffs’ own expert acknowledges that \n18  California’s inmates would still face a substantial risk of harm from COVID-19 “even if the health \n19  care delivery system were constitutionally adequate.”  ECF No. 3219-4/6524 ¶ 19 (Stern Decl.).  \n20  That the harm Plaintiffs face is not dependent on the existence of a constitutionally inadequate \n21  health care delivery system is strong evidence that it is rooted in a significantly different \n22  underlying cause than what was before us in the prior three-judge court proceedings. \n23  While the threat posed by COVID-19 is undoubtedly medical, the particular risks the \n24  disease poses to prisoners are primarily a function of the contagiousness of the virus and the \n25  nature of incarceration.  There is no vaccine for COVID-19.  Thus far, the only way to stop its \n26  spread is through preventive measures—principal among them maintaining physical distancing \n27  sufficient to hinder airborne person-to-person transmission.  See ECF No. 3221-1/6259-1 at 109 \n28  (CDC, Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in \n8 \n\nCaseC: 1a:s2e0 -4c:v0-10-2c1v3-041 D35o1c-uJmSeTn  t  D#:o 2cu6m-9e Fnitl e3d2:6 014  / 0F6il/e2d0  0P4a/g0e4 /1200  o  fP 1a6g eP a9g oefI D15 #:357\n \n1  Correctional and Detention Facilities) (describing physical distancing as a “cornerstone” of \n2  reducing transmission of COVID-19).  Creating physical distancing is uniquely difficult in a \n3  congregate environment like a prison.10  Id.  But crucially, this is a problem shared by all prisons, \n4  not just those with foundering health care delivery systems.  See id. at 107–10. \n5  That is not to say that Defendants have no constitutional obligation to take steps to prevent \n6  the spread of COVID-19 within California’s prisons.  Defendants themselves acknowledge that \n7  the virus presents a “substantial risk of serious harm” and that the Eighth Amendment therefore \n8  requires them to take reasonable measures to abate that risk.  ECF No. 3235/6552 at 17; see \n9  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 847 (1994); Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993) \n10  (noting that prison officials may not “ignore a condition of confinement that is sure or very likely \n11  to cause serious illness and needless suffering the next week or month or year”).  But we conclude \n12  that any constitutional violation in Defendants’ current response to the COVID-19 crisis is \n13  different, in both nature and degree, from the violations underlying the 2009 population cap order.  \n14  That order was never intended to prepare Defendants to confront this unprecedented pandemic.  \n15  Nor could it have, given that the entire world was unprepared for the onslaught of the COVID-19 \n \n16  virus.   \n17  We therefore conclude that to the extent Plaintiffs can establish a constitutional violation \n18  based on the threat posed by COVID-19, it must be based on shortcomings in Defendants’ \n19  response to the virus, not on the longstanding systemic constitutional deficiencies in California’s \n20  prison health care delivery system.  Because Plaintiffs’ motion seeks a release order to redress a \n21  different constitutional injury than those previously found in the Coleman and Plata proceedings, \n22  that relief cannot be granted through a modification to our prior remedial order. \n23  There is precedent within these proceedings for our conclusion that requests for disease-\n24  specific relief generally require a new Eighth Amendment analysis.  In 2013, the Plata plaintiffs \n25  brought a motion asking the court to order the transfer of classes of inmates who were particularly \n26  at risk of developing a severe form of Valley Fever—an illness spread by airborne fungal spores—\n27 \n \n10 Because the merits of Plaintiffs’ motion are not properly before us, we make no findings as to \n28 \nwhat level of physical distancing might be constitutionally required in a carceral environment. \n9 \n\nCaseC: a1s:2e0 4-c:0v1-0-c2v1-3041 3D5o1c-uJSmTe n  tD #o: c2u6m-9e nFti l3e2d6: 10 4  /F06ile/2d0 0 P4a/0g4e/ 2101   o Pf a1g6e P 1a0g eoIfD 1 5#:358\n \n1  out of the prisons where the disease was most prevalent.  Plata v. Brown, No. 01-cv-1351-TEH, \n2  2013 WL 3200587, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Jun. 24, 2013).  The plaintiffs did not bring their motion \n3  under Rule 60(b)(5), nor did the Plata court treat it as a modification request.  Instead, the court \n4  analyzed whether Defendants’ specific responses to the threats posed by Valley Fever were \n5  sufficient to satisfy the Eighth Amendment.  Id. at *10–12.  After concluding that they were not, \n6  the Plata court granted the plaintiffs’ transfer request, tailoring the scope of relief to the contours \n7  of the specific Eighth Amendment violation implicated by Defendants’ inadequate Valley Fever \n8  response.  Id. at *10–13. \n9  The Supreme Court’s discussion of our ability to modify the 2009 population cap order \n10  confirms our conclusion that the remedy Plaintiffs now seek goes to a different constitutional \n11  injury than what has been litigated previously.  In describing the scope of our modification \n12  authority, the Court explained that it may be appropriate to grant Defendants more time in which \n13  to come into compliance with the 137.5% cap if it were necessary to allow the state to develop \n14  systems for identifying inmates whose release was least likely to jeopardize public safety.  Plata, \n15  563 U.S. at 544.  It noted such an extension could be conditioned on Defendants’ “ability to meet \n \n16  interim benchmarks for improvement in the provision of medical and mental health care.”  Id.  The \n17  Court also explained that as Defendants made progress in reducing the prison population, it might \n18  become apparent “that further population reductions are not necessary or less urgent than \n19  previously believed.”  Id.  In those circumstances, it could be appropriate to consider whether to \n20  extend or modify the requirements of the population cap order.  Id. \n21  In short, the Supreme Court contemplated that we could adjust our remedial order to \n22  ensure that it remained appropriately tailored to its original goal: reducing the prison population to \n23  a level sufficient, but no lower than necessary, to allow Defendants to deliver constitutionally \n24  adequate medical and mental health care services.11  See id. at 530 (explaining that prospective \n25  relief with respect to prison conditions must be “narrowly drawn” and “extend[] no further than \n26 \n \n11 The Court’s modification ruling also encompassed the situation where Defendants reached the \n27 \n137.5% goal but were still unable to provide constitutionally adequate medical care.  Plata, 563 \nU.S. at 543.  We have no doubt that under that scenario, we would have the power to reduce the \n28 \npercentage of the design capacity cap further.   \n10 \n\nCaseC: a1s:2e0 4-c:0v1-0-c2v1-3041 3D5o1c-uJSmTe n  tD #o: c2u6m-9e nFti l3e2d6: 10 4  /F06ile/2d0 0 P4a/0g4e/ 2102   o Pf a1g6e P 1a1g eoIfD 1 5#:359\n \n1  necessary to correct the violation”).  We do not believe that the Court envisaged us “modifying” \n2  our judgment to require an additional reduction in the prison population to respond to a unique \n3  threat posed by a specific virus that could not have been foreseen only a few months ago, much \n4  less at the time of the 2009 population cap order.  Our discretion to modify our prior orders is not \n5  boundless. \n6  The cases relied on by Plaintiffs only reinforce our view that the motion before us is not an \n7  appropriate modification request.  In Parsons v. Ryan, the plaintiff class entered into a settlement \n8  agreement with prison officials that required them to achieve at least 75 percent compliance with \n9  several “health care performance measures,” including that they provide inmates with health care \n10  services within twenty-four hours after a request was first made.  912 F.3d at 493–94, 499.  The \n11  prison system’s compliance rate with this performance measure was abysmal—as low as 34 \n12  percent—and after failed efforts to improve compliance, the district court issued an order requiring \n13  the defendants to use community health services (i.e., services outside the prisons) to provide the \n14  required care.  Id. at 499.  On appeal, the defendants argued that the PLRA required the district \n15  court to “make new findings of a constitutional violation” before entering the new remedial order.  \n \n16  Id. at 501.  The Ninth Circuit rejected the argument.  It concluded that the district court’s order \n17  merely implemented a new means of curing the same constitutional violation upon which the \n18  original settlement agreement had rested—failure to provide care within a reasonable time \n19  period—and that it was therefore a proper modification of the prior remedial order.  Id. \n20  Similarly, in Armstrong v. Brown, 768 F.3d 975 (9th Cir. 2014), the district court entered \n21  an injunction that required California prison officials to “track the record of each institution and \n22  the conduct of individual staff members” who were not complying with a remedial plan to cure \n23  systemic violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act.  Id. at 978.  \n24  The vague language of the injunction created problems.  The defendants contended that it required \n25  them to track only substantiated allegations of noncompliance whereas the plaintiffs argued that it \n26  required tracking and investigation of all alleged violations.  Id. at 978–79.  In response, the \n27  district court issued a new injunction that both clarified that the defendants were required to track \n28  all allegations—substantiated or not—and added dispute resolution procedures, including a \n11 \n\nCaseC: a1s:2e0 4-c:0v1-0-c2v1-3041 3D5o1c-uJSmTe n  tD #o: c2u6m-9e nFti l3e2d6: 10 4  /F06ile/2d0 0 P4a/0g4e/ 2103   o Pf a1g6e P 1a2g eoIfD 1 5#:360\n \n1  provision that allowed plaintiffs’ counsel to review the state’s investigations of allegations of \n2  noncompliance.  Id. at 979.  The defendants appealed the modified injunction, and the Ninth \n3  Circuit affirmed.  While noting that the relief ordered by the district court might have been unduly \n4  intrusive had it been implemented as an initial remedy, the Ninth Circuit concluded that “the level \n5  of intrusiveness [was] acceptable based on the history and circumstances of the case”—namely \n6  that the district court “ha[d] attempted narrower, less intrusive alternatives—and those alternatives \n7  ha[d] failed.”  Id. at 986. \n8  Plaintiffs argue that, as in Parsons and Armstrong, more intrusive measures are necessary \n9  here because the 137.5% population cap is insufficient to allow Defendants to implement the \n10  physical distancing measures they believe are necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  ECF \n11  No. 3248/6558 at 4–5.  But this argument elides the fact that the population cap order was never \n12  intended to put Defendants in a position to confront the unique threat posed by this once-in-a-\n13  century virus.  Thus, this is not a case like Parsons and Armstrong where a district court \n14  implemented progressively more intrusive measures to remedy the same, well-understood \n15  constitutional violation that formed the basis for the original remedial order.  See Parsons, 912 \n \n16  F.3d at 499; Armstrong, 768 F.3d at 978–79, 986.  Instead, Defendants ask us to alter a decade-old \n17  order to address a new alleged constitutional violation—an inadequate response to a specific \n18  virus—that our prior order was never designed to address.  This request falls outside the scope of \n19  our equitable modification authority. \n20  Our order today does not leave Plaintiffs without options for seeking relief.  While we \n21  must deny their motion as currently procedurally improper, we do so without prejudice to their \n22  bringing their request for relief in an appropriate forum.  As with the Valley Fever motion in \n23  Plata, and as was done in the original Coleman and Plata litigation, Plaintiffs may go before a \n24  single judge to press their claim that Defendants’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic is \n25  constitutionally inadequate.  For example, if they believe that the response violates Plaintiffs’ right \n26  to adequate medical care, they may seek relief before the individual Plata court.  Likewise, \n27  Plaintiffs may seek relief before the individual Coleman court if they believe that Defendants’ \n28  response to COVID-19 is preventing the delivery of adequate mental health care.  If a single-judge \n12 \n\nCaseC: a1s:2e0 4-c:0v1-0-c2v1-3041 3D5o1c-uJSmTe n  tD #o: c2u6m-9e nFti l3e2d6: 10 4  /F06ile/2d0 0 P4a/0g4e/ 2104   o Pf a1g6e P 1a3g eoIfD 1 5#:361\n \n1  court finds a constitutional violation, it may order Defendants to take steps short of release \n2  necessary to remedy that violation.  And if that less intrusive relief proves inadequate, Plaintiffs \n3  may request, or the district court may order sua sponte, the convening of a three-judge court to \n4  determine whether a release order is appropriate.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3). \n5  III.  CONCLUSION \n6    We take no satisfaction in turning away Plaintiffs’ motion without reaching the important \n7  question of whether Defendants have implemented constitutionally adequate measures to protect \n8  the inmates of California’s prisons from the serious threat posed by this unparalleled pandemic.  \n9  But we are bound by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) and the PLRA to reach this \n10  conclusion.   \n11    We emphasize that Defendants have broad authority to voluntarily take steps that may \n12  prevent the life-threatening spread of COVID-19 within their prisons, and we recognize the \n13  deference that is due to prison authorities to determine which additional measures must be taken to \n14  avoid catastrophic results.  See Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 84–85 (1987).  Defendants have \n15  represented to us that they are continuously evaluating what more they can do to protect the \n \n16  inmates within their prisons, and we urge them to leave no stone unturned.  It is likely that only \n17  through significant effort will California’s prisons be able to minimize the spread of COVID-19. \n18  *  *  * \n19    For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ emergency motion for modification of our 2009 \n20  population reduction order is DENIED without prejudice to pursuing relief in a procedurally \n21  appropriate forum, including in the individual Coleman and/or Plata courts.   \n22  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n23   \n24  Dated:  April 4, 2020\n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n13 \n\nCaseC: a1s:2e0 4-c:0v1-0-c2v1-3041 3D5o1c-uJSmTe n  tD #o: c2u6m-9e nFti l3e2d6: 10 4  /F06ile/2d0 0 P4a/0g4e/ 2105   o Pf a1g6e P 1a4g eoIfD 1 5#:362\n \n1  MUELLER, Chief District Judge, concurring: \n2    I join in the court’s conclusion that Plaintiffs have not met their burden of demonstrating \n3  they qualify for the relief they seek under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5), assuming \n4  without deciding that as the prevailing party previously they may rely on the rule for affirmative \n5  relief.  See, e.g., In re Von Borstel, No. 01-42235-elp7, 2011 WL 477817, at *4 (Bankr. D. Or. \n6  Feb. 3, 2011) (“The rule does not say that ‘a losing’ party may obtain relief; it says ‘a’ party.” \n7  Thus, a prevailing party may use Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) to seek to set aside a judgment on the \n8  ground that the judgment should have provided additional relief.” (citing United States for Use & \n9  Benefit of Familian Nw., Inc. v. RG & B Contractors, Inc., 21 F.3d 952 (9th Cir. 1994))); but see  \n10  Cano v. Baker, 435 F.3d 1337, 1340 (11th Cir. 2006) (“The equitable purpose of Rule 60(b) \n11  cannot be to ‘relieve’ a party from her own lawsuit in which she had prevailed three decades \n12  earlier.” (citation omitted)).  The court’s conclusion in this respect is sufficient to resolve the \n13  motion before us. \n14    I respectfully do not join in the court’s analysis or determination that Plaintiffs’ motion \n15  arises out of an Eighth Amendment claim entirely distinct from the claims over which this court \n \n16  has continuing jurisdiction.  This court previously found, after extended evidentiary proceedings, \n17  that “crowding generates unsanitary conditions, overwhelms the infrastructure of existing prisons, \n18  and increases the risk that infectious diseases will spread.”  Coleman v. Schwarzenegger, 922 F. \n19  Supp. 2d 882, 931 (E.D. Cal. 2009) (“Coleman I”) (citing Nov. 9, 2007 Scott Report ¶¶ 17–24, \n20  ECF No.  1528/3058).  In so finding, this court credited multiple experts who opined that prison \n21  crowding was a contributor to great vulnerability in the face of outbreak and spread of infectious \n22  disease.  Id. (referencing opinions that “crowding ‘contributes to the difficulties of healthcare \n23  delivery by virtue of the fact that it increases the incidence of illnesses, [and] infectious \n24  disease’”); id. (quoting Rep. Tr. at 257:15–22, ECF No. 1832/3541-2, for opinion of Dr. Jeffrey A. \n25  Beard that, while prisons may not always be incubators for disease, “they could be if your \n26  population densities get so intense,” including “if you have a gymnasium that you triple bunk and \n27  put hundreds and hundreds of people in a closed dense area”); id. (“Until CDCR reduces its \n28  population, it will remain highly vulnerable to outbreaks of communicable diseases, including \n \n\nCaseC: a1s:2e0 4-c:0v1-0-c2v1-3041 3D5o1c-uJSmTe n  tD #o: c2u6m-9e nFti l3e2d6: 10 4  /F06ile/2d0 0 P4a/0g4e/ 2106   o Pf a1g6e P 1a5g eoIfD 1 5#:363\n \n1  staph infections, tuberculosis and influenza.” (quoting Nov. 9, 2007 Shansky Report ¶ 135, ECF \n2  No. 1527/3057)).     \n3    Moreover, this court retained jurisdiction to determine whether the remedy it had ordered \n4  proved durable.  See Coleman v. Brown, 952 F. Supp. 2d 901, 934 (E.D.Cal./N.D.Cal. 2013).  \n5  Even though the prison population for some time has remained below the cap this court previously \n6  set, Defendants have not achieved the durability of remedy required for this court’s role to cease.  \n7  The current circumstances appear to expose, in stark terms, the potential need to revisit the current \n8  population cap.  Even as I do not believe Plaintiffs’ motion grounded in Rule 60(b)(5) can be \n9  granted, I am inclined to think this court retains broad equitable powers that might permit some \n10  reconsideration of the current cap in light of the unprecedented exigent circumstances here.  Those \n11  circumstances, as is undisputed, present potentially grave risks to members of the Plaintiff classes, \n12  as well as to correctional staff and the communities in which they reside, as a result of the \n13  COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the delivery of medical and mental health care in the state \n14  prisons.  It is undisputed that the delivery of care, to date, remains below constitutional minima.  \n15  See Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 687 n.9 (1987) (“As we explained in Milliken v. Bradley, 433 \n \n16  U.S. 267, 281 [ ], state and local authorities have primary responsibility for curing constitutional \n17  violations.  If, however [those] authorities fail in their affirmative obligations . . . judicial authority \n18  may be invoked.  Once invoked, the scope of a district court’s equitable powers to remedy past \n19  wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.” (internal quotation \n20  marks and citation omitted)).   \n21    At the same time, it is clear that a prisoner release order under the PLRA is a remedy of \n22  last resort and neither Plaintiff class has formally sought focused relief from their individual \n23  courts, a condition precedent to issuance of a prisoner release order.  See 18 U.S.C.  \n24  § 3626(a)(3)(A); see also Coleman I, 922 F. Supp. 2d at 918.  Given the availability of expedited \n25  proceedings before those district courts to immediately exhaust the possibility of inmate transfers \n26  and relocations to secure facilities to achieve constitutionally acceptable conditions for the \n27  Plaintiff classes, those proceedings must be invoked first.  \n28    With these observations, I join in the decision to deny Plaintiffs’ motion without prejudice. \n2 ",

Public health officials throughout the country have implored the general public to exercise \nsocial distancing and improved hygiene practices in an effort to curb the threat of the deadly \nvirus. But people in Defendant Sheriff Tom Dart’s custody cannot distance themselves from \nothers and they cannot exercise improved hygiene. COVID-19 has already infected people in \nDart’s custody. Dart has failed to take reasonable measures to stop the spread of COVID-19. \nAnd every single person in his custody faces a risk of death or serious harm as a result.   \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 6 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 2 of 16 PageID #:99\nCLASS DEFINITION \n  This federal class action seeks to require Dart to implement procedures that provide \nreasonable medical care for Plaintiffs and keep them reasonably safe from contracting \ncommunicable disease while in custody. But some people are so vulnerable to COVID-19 that no \nprocedures could be implemented fast enough to protect them; these people must be released \nimmediately, and they seek a writ of habeas corpus ordering just that. At the same time, some \npeople are being housed in units with known exposure to the coronavirus; these people are \nentitled to be transferred to a unit without such exposure.  \n  Plaintiffs, therefore, seek to certify one class with two subclasses as follows: \n•  The Whole Class is defined as “all people detained in the Cook County jail who are not \ndetained pursuant to a judgment of conviction.”  \n•  Subclass A is defined as “People in custody who have vulnerabilities that place them in \nheightened risk of contracting serious COVID 19, including persons over the age of 65 \nand persons with underlying medical conditions that put them at particular risk of serious \nharm or death from COVID-19, including but not limited to people with respiratory \nconditions including chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma; people with \nheart disease or other heart conditions; people who are immunocompromised as a result \nof cancer, HIV/AIDS, or any other condition or related to treatment for a medical \ncondition; people with chronic liver or kidney disease or renal failure (including hepatitis \nand dialysis patients); people with diabetes, epilepsy, hypertension, blood disorders \n(including sickle cell disease), inherited metabolic disorders; people who have had or are \nat risk of stroke; and people with any other condition specifically identified by CDC \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 6 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 3 of 16 PageID #:100\neither now or in the future as being a particular risk for severe illness and/or death caused \nby COVID-19” \n•  Subclass B is defined as “all Class members who are currently being housed on a tier \nwhere a person with a diagnosed case of COVID-19 is or has been housed.” \nBACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nPlaintiffs’ suit for injunctive relief under the Fourteenth Amendment, and Subclass A’s \npetition for habeas corpus, arise from Dart’s failure to protect them from the severe risk of death \nor serious physical harm. Those risks effect each Class and Subclass member identically. This \nCourt should, therefore, certify the Class and Subclasses.   \nThe claims of the class and subclasses are ideally suited to proceed as a class action under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) and as an analogous class habeas proceeding under \nBijeol v. Benson, 513 F.2d 965, 968 (7th Cir. 1975), in which the Seventh Circuit held that “a \nrepresentative procedure analogous to the class action provided for in Rule 23 may be \nappropriate in a habeas corpus action under some circumstances.”1 This is so because (a) every \nmember of the class and subclasses have the same legal theory as to why their federal rights are \nbeing violated; (b) Dart’s failure to take reasonable measures to protect them violates the rights \nof every Class member; (c) every Class member will use similar or overlapping evidence in \nsupport of his or her cause of action; and (d) every member of the class seeks a uniform \ninjunction or writ of habeas corpus requiring Dart to take immediate to protect them from a grave \nrisk of death or harm. In other words, each representative shares all legal claims with the Class or \n \n1Although the Supreme Court has not squarely decided whether Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure “is \napplicable to petitions for habeas corpus relief,” on several occasions the Court has decided class action habeas \npetitions. Schall v. Martin, 467 U.S. 253, 261 n.3 & 10 (1984) (declining to address the issue and accepting district \ncourt’s certification of the class; reversing lower courts’ holding that preventive detention of juveniles was \nunconstitutional); Middendorf v. Henry, 425 U.S. 25, 30 (1976) (declining to decide whether class action habeas \npetitions are cognizable; refusing to grant relief).  \n  3 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 6 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 4 of 16 PageID #:101\nSubclass she seeks to represent, each Class or Subclass’s evidence will be identical in support of \nthose claims, and the Class representatives seek the same relief as the Class or Subclass they \nseek to represent. \nIn addition to commonality, the class and subclasses easily satisfy the other requirements \nof Rule 23(a), as well as the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2). (The requirements for a class habeas \nproceeding are materially identical. Bijeol, 513 F.2d at 968. Joinder is impracticable because the \nnumber of people in Dart’s custody exceeds 5,000 on any given day, and each Subclass contains \nhundreds, and sometimes thousands, of people. \nThe claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of those of the class as a whole. As the \nsupporting declarations to the Complaint make clear, see Complaint, ECF 1, at 17-19, that \ntypicality stems from their claim that Dart has placed them at significant risk of harm by failing \nto take appropriate steps to address the high and significant risk of COVID-19 throughout the \njail.  \nNamed Plaintiffs have no conflicts with the unnamed members of the proposed class. \nTheir lawyers are experienced in federal-court civil-rights class actions, particularly those \ninvolving prisons and jails. Thus, named Plaintiffs and their counsel will adequately represent \nthe interests of the proposed class. \nFinally, Dart has refused to act in a manner that applies generally to the class as a whole, \nrendering class-wide injunctive relief appropriate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23(b)(2), and a classwide writ of habeas corpus appropriate under Bijeol, 513 F.2d at 968. \nARGUMENT \nFor a district court to certify a class action, the proposed class must satisfy the \nnumerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy requirements of Rule 23(a) and at least one \n  4 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 6 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 5 of 16 PageID #:102\nrequirement of Rule 23(b).2 Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1017 (7th Cir. 1992). Because \nthe proposed Class and Subclasses meet all four Rule 23(a) requirements and the requirements of \nRule 23(b)(2), this Court should certify Plaintiffs’ proposed Class. Rule 23(c)(5) further allows \nfor a class to be divided into subclasses, where the subclasses are treated as a class under Rule \n23. See Johnson v. Meriter Health Servs. Emp. Ret. Plan, 702 F.3d 364, 368 (7th Cir. 2012). As \ndemonstrated below, each subclass additionally meets all requirements of Rule 23(a) and Rule \n23(b) and this Court should similarly certify each of Plaintiffs’ proposed subclasses.  \nI.  Plaintiffs Satisfy Rule 23(a): They Are Numerous and Raise Common Questions, \nand the Named Plaintiffs Are Adequate Representatives With Typical Claims. \n \nA.  Numerosity is Satisfied: The Class and Subclasses Each Include Hundreds if \nNot Thousands of Members. \n \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)(1) requires that the class be “so numerous that \njoinder of all members is impracticable.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). “[A] class including more than \n40 members is generally believed to be sufficient.” Barragan v. Evanger's Dog & Cat Food Co., \n259 F.R.D. 330, 333 (N.D. Ill. 2009); Streeter v. Sheriff of Cook Cty., 256 F.R.D. 609, 612 (N.D. \nIll. 2012) (same); accord William B. Rubenstein, et al., Newberg on Class Actions, § 3:12 (5th \ned. 2011) (“[A] class of 40 or more members raises a presumption of impracticability of joinder \nbased on numbers alone”). Numerosity is easily satisfied here. Dart is currently holding \napproximately 4,770 people in his custody. The threat posed by COVID-19 is such that every \nperson in Dart’s custody faces the risk of significant harm. Everyone is at risk of transmission of \nCOVID-19. There is no available vaccine to protect against infection from COVID-19 and no \nmedications approved to treat it. People in congregate environments such as jails, which are \n \n2 Because the requirements are materially identical in this context, Plaintiffs refer to Rule 23 as the governing \nstandard. See Kazarov v. Achim, No. 02 C 5097, 2003 WL 22956006, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 12, 2003) (analyzing \npetition for representative habeas action by determining whether the “Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 factors are \nmet and that a representative action is appropriate”).  \n  5 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 6 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 6 of 16 PageID #:103\nplaces where people live, eat, and sleep in close proximity, face increased danger of contracting \nCOVID-19, as already evidenced by the rapid spread of the virus in cruise ships and nursing \nhomes. The CDC also warns of “community spread” where the virus spreads easily and \nsustainably within a community where the source of the infection is unknown. \nThe proposed subclasses also easily meet the numerosity threshold. Subclass A is \ncomprised of people who are medically vulnerable to COVID-19 because of underlying medical \nconditions—including people who live with diabetes and asthma, among other conditions. \nPeople of any age who suffer from certain underlying medical conditions, including lung disease, \nheart disease, chronic liver or kidney disease (including hepatitis and dialysis patients), diabetes, \nepilepsy, hypertension, compromised immune systems (such as from cancer, HIV, or \nautoimmune disease), blood disorder (including sickle cell disease), inherited metabolic \ndisorders, stroke, developmental delay, and asthma, are at elevated risk as well. The WHO-China \nJoint Mission Report indicates that the mortality rate from COVID-19 for those with \ncardiovascular disease was 13.2%, 9.2% for diabetes, 8.4% for hypertension, 8.0% for chronic \nrespiratory disease, and 7.6% for cancer.3 \nAccording to one study, “asthma prevalence is 30%–60% higher among individuals with \na history of incarceration as compared with the general population.”4 One study estimates that up \nto 15% of people who are in custody have asthma, 10% of people in custody live with a heart \ncondition that requires medical care, 10% live with diabetes, and 30% have hypertension.5 Based \n \n3 Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), World \nHealth Organization (Feb. 28, 2020), at 12, available at https://www.who.int/docs/default-\nsource/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf (last visited Apr. 1, 2020). \n4 Elizabth M. Vigilanto et al., Mass Incarceration and Pulmonary Health: Guidance for \nClinicians, 15 Ann. Am. Thoracic Soc. 409, 409 (2019).  \n5 Laura M. Marushack et al., Medical Problems of State and Federal Prisoners and Jail Inmates, \n2011-12, U.S. Dept. of Justice (2014).  \n \n  6 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 6 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 7 of 16 PageID #:104\non these estimates and assuming some overlap in these diagnoses, a fair estimate of the number \nof people who live with one or more of these medical vulnerabilities exceeds one thousand.  \nSubclass B is defined as all people who are housed on a tier that is or has been exposed to \nsomeone with a known coronavirus diagnosis. At the time of the filing of this Motion, at least \n164 detainees and 46 staff members has tested positive for coronavirus. This almost certainly \nunderestimates the number of actual cases by a factor of three or four, as explained in the \ncontemporaneously filed Complaint and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. But even if it did \nnot, large swaths of the jail have already been exposed to the virus, and must be thoroughly deep \ncleaned in order to be safe for human habitation. Hundreds of people, if not thousands, are \ncurrently confined in these swaths of the jail.  \nThe class and subclasses are too numerous for joinder to be considered practicable.  \nB.  Commonality is Satisfied: The Legality of Dart’s Response to the Pandemic \nInvolves Numerous Common Questions of Fact and Law.  \n \nRule 23(a)(2) requires that “there [be] questions of law or fact common to the class.” Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). “A common nucleus of operative fact is usually enough to satisfy the \ncommonality requirement.” Rosario, 963 F.2d at 1018; Streeter, 256 F.R.D. at 612 (same). “Rule \n23 must be liberally interpreted” and should be read to favor maintenance of class actions, King \nv. Kan. City S. Indus., 519 F.2d 20, 25-26 (7th Cir. 1975); Scholes v. Stone, McGuire & \nBenjamin, 143 F.R.D. 181, 185 (N.D. Ill. 1992) (“[T]he commonality requirement has been \ncharacterized as a ‘low hurdle’ easily surmounted.”).  \nPlaintiffs must demonstrate that there is “some glue” holding the claims together; the \nclass claims “must depend upon a common contention” that is “of such a nature that it is capable \nof classwide resolution.” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 351 (2011). (“What \nmatters to class certification . . . is not the raising of common questions . . . but, rather the \n  7 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 6 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 8 of 16 PageID #:105\ncapacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers . . .”) (citations and quotations \nomitted; emphasis and first ellipsis in original). In many post-Walmart cases, district courts have \nfound that systemic constitutional challenges to prison and jail conditions provide the “glue” \nnecessary to hold a class together. E.g., Olson v. Brown, 284 F.R.D. 398, 410-11 (N.D. Ind. \n2012) (jail policies and conditions); Ross v. Gossett, 2020 WL 1472072, at *3-4 (S.D. Ill. Mar. \n26, 2020) (unconstitutional practices regarding shakedowns); Rosas v. Baca, 2012 WL 2061694, \nat *3 (C.D. Cal. June 7, 2012) (jail violence case); Jones v. Guzman, 296 F.R.D. 416, 465-66 \n(E.D. La. 2013) (jail violence case); Hughes v. Judd, 2013 WL 1821077, at *23 (M.D. Fla. Mar. \n27, 2013) (unconstitutional conditions for juvenile detainees); M.D. v. Perry, 294 F.R.D. 7, 35 \n(S.D. Tex. 2013) (foster children facing abuse); Parsons v. Ryan, 289 F.R.D. 513, 516-23 (D. \nAriz. 2013) (inadequate medical and mental health care in state prisons); Butler v. Suffolk Cnty., \n289 F.R.D. 80, 98 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (jail sanitation case); Abadia-Piexoto v. United States Dep’t \nof Homeland Sec., 277 F.R.D. 572, 577 (N.D. Cal. 2011) (shackling of detainees during judicial \nproceedings). \nAs the Supreme Court explained in Wal-Mart, “for purposes of Rule 23(a)(2) [e]ven a \nsingle [common] question will do . . .” 564 U.S. at 359 (citation and internal quotations omitted; \nalterations in original). Here, Plaintiffs allege that all members of the proposed Class are at \nsignificant risk of contracting a fatal illness due to Dart’s systemic failure to implement policies \nand practices necessary to protect them. The questions of law and fact common to the class and \neach subclass are the following: \n(1) Does COVID-19 present a substantial risk of harm to people in Dart’s custody? \n  8 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 6 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 9 of 16 PageID #:106\n(2) Does COVID-19 present a risk of harm so severe to some people that the only \nConstitutionally permissible way to protect them is to release them from custody \nimmediately? \n(3) Do people detained in areas known to be exposed to a deadly pathogen have a right to \nbe transferred to another place that is not so exposed?  \nResolving these questions will yield exactly the kind of “common answer” to Plaintiffs’ Eighth \nand Fourteenth Amendment claims that the Supreme Court requires. See Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at \n351. \nAn injunctive challenge to a systemic failure to protect class members from significant \nharm is a textbook example of a case that satisfies the commonality requirement and warrants \nclass certification. Indeed, “[a] class action is . . . an appropriate vehicle to address what is \nalleged to be a systemic problem.” Coleman v. County of Kane, 196 F.R.D. 505, 507 (N.D. Ill. \n2000) (finding commonality in case against sheriff regarding bond fees). Plaintiffs here \nchallenge Dart’s systemic failure to respond reasonably to the deadly threat of COVID-19. The \ncommonality requirement is therefore easily met. See Corey H. v. Bd. of Educ. of City of Chi., \n2012 WL 2953217, at *7 (N.D. Ill. Jul. 19, 2012) (“Plaintiffs have attacked . . . systemic failures \nand district-wide policies that apply to every member of the certified class.”).  \nC.  Typicality is Satisfied: The Named Plaintiffs’ Claims are Representative of \nThose of the Class at Large. \n \nRule 23(a)(3) requires that “the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical \nof the claims or defenses of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). The standard for determining \ntypicality is not an identity of interest between the named plaintiffs and the class, but rather a \n“sufficient homogeneity of interest.” See, e.g., Jones v. Blinziner, 536 F. Supp. 1181, 1190 (N.D. \n  9 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 6 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 10 of 16 PageID #:107\nInd. 1982) (citing Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 403 n.13 (1975)). “[T]he typicality requirement \nis liberally construed.” Gaspar v. Linvatec Corp., 167 F.R.D. 51, 57 (N.D. Ill. 1996).  \nIn this case, the claims of the Plaintiffs are typical of the Class and of each Subclasses \nthat they represent. See Fonder v. Sheriff of Kankakee County, 2013 WL 5644754, at *6 (C.D. \nIll. Oct. 15, 2013) (typicality satisfied where “Plaintiff is challenging the same strip search policy \nas the class he seeks to represent”); Olson, 284 F.R.D. at 411 (typicality satisfied where class \nrepresentative and members of proposed class had legal mail opened improperly by correctional \nofficers); Inmates of Attica Corr. Facility v. Rockefeller, 453 F.2d 12, 24-25 (2d Cir. 1971) \n(finding typicality in lawsuit challenging excessive force by guards, despite individual factual \ndifferences); Ingles v. City of New York, 2003 WL 402565, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 20, 2003) \n(same); Anderson v. Garner, 22 F. Supp. 2d 1379, 1385 (N.D. Ga. 1997) (finding typicality in \nprison excessive force case even though “when compared to the Plaintiffs’ claims, the unnamed \nclass members may have suffered different injuries under different circumstances”). Every \nmember of the class faces a substantial risk of contracting COVID-19 if immediate measures are \nnot implement. Some people, like the medically vulnerable members of Subclass A, are at \nimminent risk of death or severe harm if they are not released.  \nOf course “[t]ypical does not mean identical.” Gaspar, 167 F.R.D. at 57; see also De La \nFuente v. Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., 713 F.2d 225, 232 (7th Cir. 1983) (“The typicality \nrequirement may be satisfied even if there are factual distinctions between the claims of the \nnamed plaintiffs and those of other class members.”), overruled on other grounds, Green v. \nMansour, 474 U.S. 64 (1985); Muro v. Target Corp., 580 F.3d 485, 492 (7th Cir. 2009) (same). \nThus, the typicality requirement is satisfied when the representative’s injuries arise from the \nsame practice affecting the rest of the class, even if factual differences exist. Streeter, 256 F.R.D. \n  10 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 6 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 11 of 16 PageID #:108\nat 612-13 (certifying class of detainees strip searched upon entry to Cook County Jail, despite the \nSheriff’s argument that there were differences in the circumstances of each search “because the \nlikelihood of some range of variation in how different groups of . . . detainees were treated does \nnot undermine the fact that the claims of each class [member] share a common factual basis and \nlegal theory.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Areola v. Godinez, 546 F.3d 788, 798 (7th Cir. \n2008) (typicality satisfied where plaintiff was in the “same boat” as other Cook County Jail \ndetainees who had been denied crutches); Parish v. Sheriff of Cook County, 2008 WL 4812875, \nat *4 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 24, 2008) (certifying class of Cook County Jail detainees who were denied \nadequate medical care and rejecting the Sheriff’s argument that commonality did not exist \nbecause “the named plaintiffs’ claims vary as to the type of illness complained of and the type of \nmedication at issue”); Bullock v. Sheahan, 225 F.R.D. 227, 230 (N.D. Ill. 2004) (“[p]otential \nfactual differences” relating to individual searches held insufficient to defeat typicality in a jail \nstrip search case). \nThe overarching nature of the threat of COVID-19 to every person confined in Dart’s \ncustody is sufficient to satisfy typicality. For Subclass A, each person claims that she must be \nreleased because her health is at imminent and immediate risk from the same virus and same \npolicy failures as each other person in Subclass A. And for Subclass B, each person claims an \nidentical potential exposure to an identical pathogen and seeks identical relief. Both Plaintiffs \nallege that they are (a) in the jail, (b) medically vulnerable, and (c) housed on a tier where \nanother detainee has tested positive for coronavirus. These mirror the allegations of the many \ndeclarants, both those in and recently released from the Jail, who have and are suffering the same \nharms as the Class Representatives—exposure to COVID-19 positive or symptomatic detainees, \nlack of cleaning supplies and sanitizing agents, lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), \n  11 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 6 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 12 of 16 PageID #:109\ninability to engage in social distancing or indeed any distancing in dorm and double-celling \nliving quarters with shared shower and bathroom areas, a lack of adequate medical care \nincluding for detainees with symptoms of COVID-19, and a lack of clean shared living spaces.  \nIn this way, the claims of the Class Representatives are typical of the claims of those they seek to \nrepresent. See Complaint, ECF 1, at 17-19. \nD.  The Named Plaintiffs Will Fairly and Adequately Protect the Interests of the \nClass and Subclasses.  \n \nRule 23(a)(4) requires that “the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). “This adequate representation inquiry consists \nof two parts: (1) the adequacy of the named plaintiffs as representatives of the proposed class’s \nmyriad members, with their differing and separate interests, and (2) the adequacy of the proposed \nclass counsel.” Gomez v. St. Vincent Health, Inc., 649 F.3d 583, 592 (7th Cir. 2011). All \nPlaintiffs here are represented by counsel experienced in the protection and enforcement of \nconstitutional and statutory rights. Plaintiffs each have a strong personal stake in the proceedings \nthat will “insure diligent and thorough prosecution of the litigation.” Rodriguez v. Swank, 318 F. \nSupp. 289, 294 (N.D. Ill. 1970), aff'd, 403 U.S. 901 (1971).  \n1.  Absence of Conflict within the Class \n \nThe two Named Plaintiffs in this case are set forth below: \n•  Plaintiff-Petitioner Anthony Mays is a detainee in Cook County Jail.  He has diabetes and \nhad been referred for an evaluation of a heart condition when COVID-19 hit the jail.  He \nis housed in Division 8, in an open-dormitory setting.  Multiple detainees on his tier have \nbeen removed after testing positive for COVID-19. \n•  Plaintiff-Petitioner Kenneth Foster is a detainee at Cook County Jail.  This action is \nbrought on Mr. Foster’s behalf by his next friend, Judia Jackson.  Ms. Jackson is aware of \n  12 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 6 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 13 of 16 PageID #:110\nMr. Foster’s wishes with respect to this action.  Ms. Jackson is serving as next friend \nbecause the undersigned counsel attempted to contact Mr. Foster by telephone within the \nCook County Jail, but were unable to do so due to the Jail’s operational difficulties \narising out of the COVID-19 pandemic.  See Declaration of Alison Horn (Ex. A).  Mr. \nFoster has stomach cancer, Lung-Sarcoidosis, high blood pressure, asthma, and \nbronchitis. He is living in a dorm setting in Division 2.  Mr. Foster estimates that five or \nsix people from his tier have tested positive for COVID-19.  The people who tested \npositive for the virus were removed from the dorm. \nNamed Plaintiffs have no known conflicts with other class members and they are willing and \nable to serve as named Plaintiffs in this Action.   \n2.  Adequacy of Representation \n \nPlaintiffs’ counsel are eminently qualified, experienced in conducting federal class action \nlitigation, and have adequate resources to undertake the proposed litigation to its resolution. \nPlaintiffs are represented by attorneys from Loevy & Loevy, the Roderick and Solange \nMacArthur Justice Center, and Civil Rights Corps. Counsel’s qualifications are more explicitly \nset forth in the attached declarations. See Declaration of Stephen Weil (Ex. B), Declaration of \nAlexa A. Van Brunt (Ex. C), Declaration of Locke E. Bowman (Ex. D), Declaration of Charles \nGerstein (Ex. E). \nII.  Plaintiffs Satisfy Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2): This Case Seeks an Injunction Against and \nWrit of Habeas Corpus Seeking Relief From Conditions that Place the Entire \nProposed Class at Risk of Serious Illness and Death. \n \n  The final requirement for class certification is satisfaction of at least one of the \nsubsections of Rule 23(b). Subsection (b)(2) requires that “the party opposing the class has \nacted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate \n  13 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 6 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 14 of 16 PageID #:111\nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). Courts have repeatedly held that civil-rights class actions are the \nparadigmatic 23(b)(2) suits, “for they seek classwide structural relief that would clearly redound \nequally to the benefit of each class member.” Marcera v. Chinlund, 595 F.2d 1231, 1240 (2d Cir. \n1979), vacated on other grounds, 442 U.S. 915 (1979); see also Johnson v. General Motors \nCorp., 598 F.2d 432, 435 (5th Cir. 1979). As stated in the leading treatise on class actions: \nRule 23(b)(2) was drafted specifically to facilitate relief in civil rights suits. Most \nclass actions in the constitutional and civil rights areas seek primarily declaratory \nand injunctive relief on behalf of the class and therefore readily satisfy Rule \n23(b)(2) class action criteria. \n \nA. Conte & H. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions § 25.20 (4th ed. 2002). In addition, the \nSeventh Circuit has recognized that prisoners, because of many factors “may not . . . [be] in a \nposition to seek . . . [relief] on their own behalf,” and that this fact militates in favor of class \ncertification. United States ex rel. Morgan v. Sielaff, 546 F.2d 218, 222 (7th Cir. 1976).  \n  Injunctive challenges to prison and jail conditions routinely proceed as class actions. See, \ne.g., Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 506 (2011); Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk Cnty. Jail, 502 U.S. \n367, 374 (1992); Jones 'El v. Berge, 374 F.3d 541 (7th Cir. 2004); Bruscino v. Carlson, 854 F.2d \n162, 164 (7th Cir. 1988); Hadi v. Horn, 830 F.2d 779, 781 (7th Cir. 1987); French v. Owens, 777 \nF.2d 1250, 1251 (7th Cir. 1985); Jones v. Diamond, 519 F.2d 1090, 1097 (5th Cir. 1975) \n(“Realistically, class actions are the only practicable judicial mechanism for the cleansing \nreformation and purification of these penal institutions.”); Kanter v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 58 (3d \nCir. 1994) (noting that subsection (b)(2) “is almost automatically satisfied in actions primarily \nseeking injunctive relief”); Bradley v. Harrelson, 151 F.R.D. 422, 427 (M.D. Ala. 1993) (stating \nthat subsection (b)(2) “is particularly applicable to suits such as the one sub judice which involve \nconditions of confinement in a correctional institution”). Here, the practice of high-level officials \n  14 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 6 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 15 of 16 PageID #:112\nfailing to take reasonable measures to abate the deadly threat posed by COVID-19 places all \nclass members at risk of serious illness or death. Rule 23(b)(2) is accordingly satisfied. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court the certify the \nClass and Subclasses as defined in this Motion.  \n            Respectfully submitted, \n \n              /s/ Alexa Van Brunt \n              Counsel for Plaintiffs \n             \n \n \n \n \nStephen H.

I am the Investigative Supervisor at Civil Rights Corps. I have held this position since \nApril 2018. \n2.  On the morning of April 3, 2020, I attempted to schedule legal telephone calls with seven \npeople in the custody of the Cook County Department of Corrections (CCDOC).  \n3.  I reviewed email correspondence from CCDOC Associate General Counsel Tracey \nThompson regarding the procedures for scheduling legal telephone calls with persons \ndetained at CCDOC. \n4.  In accordance with the instructions from Ms. Thompson, and on behalf of Civil Rights \nCorps Attorney Charles Gerstein, I completed one copy of the form entitled “Cook \nCounty Sheriff’s Office Request for Attorney-Client Privileged Telephone Calls” for \neach of the seven incarcerated people with whom Mr. Gerstein was requesting legal calls. \n5.  I emailed the completed forms to CCSO.legalvisit@cookcountyil.gov in two separate \nemails.  \n6.  In the first email, sent at 8:45AM CDT, I requested legal telephone calls between Mr. \nGerstein and Charles Wimberly, Booking # 20200209107, Christopher Ziegler, Booking \n# 20190705184, Anthony Mays, Booking # 20190104199, and Sharita Parks, Booking # \n20191004148 for April 3, 2020 between 12:00PM and 2:00PM CDT.   \n7.  In the second email, sent at 8:46AM CDT, I requested legal telephone calls between Mr. \nGerstein and Brandon Mathis, Booking # 20200229173, Sean Alexander, Booking # \n20200227046, and Kenneth Foster, Booking # 20200214120 for April 3, 2020 between \n2:00PM and 4:00PM.  \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 6-1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 2 of 2 PageID #:115\n8.  I received a response by email from the Cook County Sheriff’s office that stated, “I’m \nsorry but due to operational difficulties with the pandemic all calls need to be scheduled \n48 hours in advance with a two hour window for each individual. Please let me know the \ntime and date you would like to schedule these calls.” \n9.  Following the receipt of this email, I spoke by telephone with Cook County Department \nof Corrections Associate General Counsel Tracey Thompson on the telephone regarding \nthe requested legal telephone calls. \n10. During my telephone call with Ms. Thompson, she informed me that Mr. Gerstein would \nbe required to schedule legal telephone calls two business days in advance of the date of \nthe requested calls. \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my ability. \n \n_/s/ Alison Horn_____________________     April 3, 2020 \nSigned             Dated \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 6-2 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 1 of 3 PageID #:116\n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS \nEASTERN DIVISION \n \nANTHONY MAYS, Individually and on behalf   ) \nof a class of similarly situated persons; and     ) \nJUDIA JACKSON, as next friend of KENNETH  ) \nFOSTER, Individually and on behalf of a class   ) \nof similarly situated persons,        ) \n              ) \n  Plaintiffs-Petitioners,       ) \n              )  Case No. 1:20-cv-2134 \n    v.          ) \n              ) \nTHOMAS DART, Sheriff of Cook County,    ) \n              ) \n  Defendant-Respondent.      ) \n \nDECLARATION OF STPEHEN H. WEIL \n  I, Stephen H. Weil, counsel for the Plaintiffs in the above-captioned case, state \nthat the following is true and correct to the best of my knowledge: \n1.  I am an attorney with the law firm of Loevy & Loevy in Chicago. I submit \nthis declaration in support of the Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.  \n2.  Loevy & Loevy regularly engages in complex litigation, including \ncomplex class actions, many of which raise claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations \nof constitutional rights. Loevy & Loevy has the resources and experience necessary to \nconduct litigation of this nature, and has experience prosecuting class actions of similar \nsize, scope, and complexity to this case. \n3.  Attorneys at Loevy & Loevy have been appointed numerous times as class \ncounsel, including in Marconi v. City of Joliet, Case No. 10-MR-0165 (Circuit of Will \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 6-2 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 2 of 3 PageID #:117\nCounty, Ill.)

(class \naction alleging unconstitutional strip search at Lincoln Correctional Center); Young v. \nCounty of Cook, No. 06 C 0552 (N.D. Ill.) (class action alleging unconstitutional strip \nsearch of detainees at Cook County Jail). \n4.  I have been an attorney for 15 years, and practicing as a civil rights \nlitigator focused on the criminal legal system since 2014.  \n5.  I am a member in good standing of the bar of State of Illinois. \n \n6.  Loevy & Loevy has sufficient funds available to finance the costs of this \nlitigation, and the ongoing monitoring required to protect the interests of the class. \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 6-2 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 3 of 3 PageID #:118\nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \n \n \n \n/s/ Stephen H.

VAN BRUNT \n  I, Alexa Van Brunt, counsel for the Plaintiffs in the above-captioned case, state that the \nfollowing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge: \n1.  I am a Clinical Assistant Professor of Law at the Northwestern University Pritzker \nSchool of Law, and Director of  the Roderick and Solange MacArthur Justice Center Clinic and \nNorthwestern. I submit this declaration in support of the Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.  \n2.  The Roderick and Solange MacArthur Justice Center is a nationally-renowned \ncivil rights litigation firm, with offices in five states including Chicago, which is the \norganization’s headquarters. The non-profit organization is dedicated to eradicating injustice in \nthe criminal system, and advocating for de-incarceration, racial justice, and fairness in policing, \npre-trial detention, the operation of prisons and jails, and post-incarceration practices.  The \nMacArthur Justice Center has been at the forefront of efforts to dismantle the death penalty, \nensure the release of youth sentenced to spend the rest of their lives in prison, and seek \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 6-3 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 2 of 4 PageID #:120\ncompensation for those wrongfully convicted as a result of egregious state and law enforcement \nmisconduct.   \n3.  I have been an attorney for 11 years, and practicing as a civil rights litigator \nfocused on the criminal legal system since 2010.  \n4.  For the past ten years, my law practice has focused almost exclusively on \nprotecting the rights of children and adults in the Illinois criminal justice system, particularly \nthose who are subject to law enforcement misconduct or constitutional violations in the State’s \njails and prisons. I have brought civil rights actions in both federal and state courts in the State \nand nationwide. \n5.  I have previously brought class action litigation challenging the detention of \npretrial detainees in the Cook County Jail based on their inability to afford cash bail bond \n(Robinson v. Martin et al., 2016 CH 13587 (Cir. Ct. Ck. Cty.)). With Locke Bowman, one of my \nco-counsel in this suit, I recently authored a law review article concerning the unconstitutional \nuse of cash bond in pretrial legal systems. See Alexa Van Brunt and Locke E. Bowman, Toward \na Just Model of Pretrial Release: A History of Bail Reform and a Prescription for What's Next, \n108 J. CRIM. L. & CRIMINOLOGY 701 (2018).  \n6.  I have participated as lead counsel in class action suits challenging parole \nrevocation procedures in the State of Illinois, including: Morales v. Monreal, No. 13cv7572 \n(N.D.Ill); King v. Walker, No. 06cv204 (N.D. Ill); and M.H. v. Monreal et al., No. 12cv8523 \n(N.D. Ill.). All three settled after negotiations with the State of Illinois, and resulted in significant \nprocedural protections for parolees in Illinois. The M.H. and Morales settlements, in particular, \nresulted in the appointment of state-funded counsel to adults and youth facing the revocation of \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 6-3 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 3 of 4 PageID #:121\ntheir parole. In May 2017, I received the Federal Bar Association’s Award for Excellence in Pro \nBono Service for the Morales litigation. \n7.

KENNELLY, District Judge:1 \n  Anthony Mays and Kenneth Foster, both of whom are detained at Cook County \nJail while awaiting trial on criminal charges, have sued Cook County Sheriff Thomas \nDart, who operates the Jail, on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons.  Mays and \nFoster allege the Sheriff has violated the constitutional rights of persons detained at the \njail by failing to provide them with reasonably safe living conditions in the face of the \ncurrent coronavirus pandemic.  They assert claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and for writs \nof habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241.   \n  On April 9, 2020, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary \n                                            \n1  Judge Kennelly is addressing this matter as emergency judge pursuant to paragraph \n5 of Second Amended General Order 20-0012. \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 2 of 87 PageID #:1935\nrestraining order in part.  The Court directed the Sheriff to:  (1) establish and implement, \nwithin two days' time, a policy requiring prompt coronavirus testing of detained persons \nwith symptoms consistent with coronavirus disease; (2) within two days' time, eliminate \nthe use of \"bullpens\" to hold groups of new detainees during the intake process; (3) \nbegin to provide inmates and staff, within one day, soap and/or hand sanitizer sufficient \nto enable them to frequently clean their hands, and sanitation supplies sufficient to \nenable them to regularly sanitize surfaces in areas used in common; (4) establish and \ncarry out, within two days' time, a policy requiring sanitation of all such surfaces \nbetween each use; and (5) within three days' time, distribute facemasks to all detained \npersons quarantined due to their exposure to a person exhibiting symptoms consistent \nwith coronavirus disease.  The Court overruled the plaintiffs' request for additional \ntemporary relief, including a mandate for implementation of \"social distancing\" \nthroughout the Jail and to provide facemasks to every detained person.  The Court also \nconcluded that the plaintiffs seeking habeas corpus relief had failed to exhaust available \nstate court remedies. \n  The plaintiffs have now moved for entry of a preliminary injunction and other \nrelief.  They again seek writs of habeas corpus, based on newly discovered facts that \nthey contend provide a basis to excuse their failure to exhaust state court remedies.  \nThey also seek conversion of the temporary restraining order to a preliminary injunction, \nand they again request an order requiring implementation of social distancing \nthroughout the Jail, as well as transfer of detained persons from the Jail to other \nlocations within the Sheriff's control, including electronic home monitoring.  The plaintiffs \nalso request the convening of a three-judge court under the Prison Litigation Reform Act \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 3 of 87 PageID #:1936\nto consider entering a \"prisoner release order\" within the meaning of that statute. \n  For the reasons stated below, the Court converts the terms of the temporary \nrestraining order to a preliminary injunction and enters further preliminary injunctive \nrelief regarding social distancing but denies the plaintiffs' other requests for relief. \nFactual Background \nThe following discussion of relevant facts concerning coronavirus, the Cook \nCounty Jail facilities, and the parties' claims and defenses is taken from undisputed \nfacts, the affidavits and documentary evidence submitted by the parties, and the \ntestimony and exhibits offered at the evidentiary hearing held on April 23, 2020.     \nA.  The coronavirus pandemic \nThe rapid global spread of the novel coronavirus has led to a pandemic of \nextraordinary scale.  The Court's decision on the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary \nrestraining order includes a discussion of the gravity of the public health threat \nassociated with this virus.  Mays v. Dart, No. 20 C 2134, 2020 WL 1812381, at *2 (N.D. \nIll. Apr. 9, 2020). \nSymptoms of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus—what has come to \nbe known as COVID-19, which the Court will refer to as coronavirus disease—include \nfever, cough, and shortness of breath, and the health effects can be very severe, \nincluding serious damage to the lungs and other internal organs, and death.  People \nwho are sixty-five years of age or older and those with certain pre-existing health \nconditions, including chronic lung disease, moderate to severe asthma, serious heart \nconditions, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, a body mass index of forty \nor higher, and other conditions have a heightened vulnerability to severe illness if they \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 4 of 87 PageID #:1937\ncontract the coronavirus.   \nThe rapid transmission of coronavirus has been attributed to several \ncharacteristics.  Respiratory droplets containing the virus emitted by an infected person, \nthough coughing or sneezing for example, can travel several feet and may persist in the \nair for several hours.  In addition, because the virus can persist on some surfaces for up \nto three days, transmission can occur even without physical proximity to an infected \nperson.  Moreover, those who contract the virus may be asymptomatic for days or even \nfor the entire duration of the infection but can still transmit the virus to others, making it \nmore challenging to readily identify infected individuals and respond with necessary \nprecautions.   \n There is currently no known effective treatment for coronavirus disease and no \nvaccine to prevent people from contracting it.  Medical professionals and public health \nexperts agree—and the evidence in this case demonstrates beyond peradventure—that \nthe only way to curb the spread of the virus is through a multi-faceted strategy that \nincludes testing to identify those who have been infected; isolation of those who test \npositive or develop symptoms consistent with the disease; quarantining those who may \nhave come into contact with the virus; frequent sanitation of surfaces; frequent \nhandwashing; and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as facemasks.  \nAnd a key tactic recommended by public health experts to curb the spread of \ncoronavirus disease has been to keep people apart from each other—what has come to \nbe known as \"social distancing.\"  The Centers for Disease Control's Interim Guidance \non Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 5 of 87 PageID #:1938\nDetention Facilities (\"CDC Guidelines\"),2 defines social distancing as \"the practice of \nincreasing the space between individuals and decreasing the frequency of contact to \nreduce the risk of spreading a disease (ideally to maintain at least 6 feet between all \nindividuals, even those who are asymptomatic).\"  Id. at 4.   \nSocial distancing has effectively been mandated by most state governments as a \ncritical strategy in combatting the pandemic.  Here in Illinois, the state has been under a \nstatewide stay-at-home order first imposed by Governor J.B. Pritzker effective March \n20, 2020, the goal of which is to limit person-to-person contacts to curb transmission of \nthe virus.  Activities not deemed \"essential\" have been shut down.  People have been \nstrongly urged, and in many situations directed (by governments, employers, \ncommercial establishments, and so on) to maintain space between themselves and \nothers.  In addition, the wearing of PPE, primarily facemasks, has been strongly advised \nand now required in some situations, particularly when people may come into contact \nwith others. \nThe effect of the stay-at-home orders imposed in Illinois and most other states, \nalong with advice by national officials to limit contacts and group activities, has been \ndramatic: schools have been closed; commercial establishments and workplaces have \nceased operations, resulting in massive job losses; public events have largely been \ncancelled; and access to public spaces has been limited or barred entirely.  Entire \nsectors of the national economy have slowed to a snail's pace.  Society has paid a very \nhigh price to curb the spread of this highly contagious virus. \n                                            \n2 The Guidelines were issued on March 23, 2020 and are available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/guidance-correctional-\ndetention.pdf. \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 6 of 87 PageID #:1939\nB.  Operation of the Cook County Jail \nThe Sheriff runs the Cook County Jail.  As the Court stated in its written decision \non the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), the Jail is \"a very large \nphysical facility—actually a campus of separate physical facilities—whose population, if \none considers including both detainees and staff, is the size of a small (but not all that \nsmall) town.\"  Mays, 2020 WL 1812381, at *1.  Managing the Jail is extraordinarily \nchallenging because of the size of its population and physical facilities, the diverse \nneeds of the detainees, the Sheriff's public safety obligations, and his obligations to the \ncriminal justice system.  The Sheriff's public safety obligations require him to consider \nthe appropriate custodial conditions for each detained person.  As the Court has noted, \nthe Jail's population \"runs the gamut from persons with lengthy criminal records who are \naccused of committing violent crimes to non-violent offenders in custody for the first \ntime who, perhaps, remain in custody only because they and their families were unable \nto post bond money.\"  Id.  And the Sheriff's obligations to the people in his custody, \nmost of whom are detained awaiting trial on crimes for which they are therefore entitled \nto a presumption of innocence, require him to provide care sufficient to account for each \nindividual's physical and mental health conditions.  This is no small task, particularly \ngiven that populations in custody are statistically more likely to have adverse health \nconditions, both physical and mental. \nAdding an infectious disease outbreak to these conditions further complicates the \ndifficult challenge of managing the Jail.  The very nature of the Jail's setup and day-to-\nday operations facilitates rapid transmission of communicable diseases like the one \ncaused by the coronavirus.  First, the Jail's physical facilities are designed to \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 7 of 87 PageID #:1940\naccommodate large populations, all densely housed, and many in congregate settings.  \nIn particular, the Jail has many so-called \"dormitory\" units, which in normal times may \nhouse as many as hundreds of detained persons in a single room with closely-spaced \nbunk beds.   \nSecond, the Jail is a closed environment with many spaces used in common.  \nPersons detained there—even those housed in single-occupancy cells—do not have \nindividual bathing facilities; toilets are typically used in common; they eat in groups \nunder normal circumstances; and they come into contact with each other and with \ncorrectional officers in other common areas.  And even when confined, detainees are in \nclose proximity, in adjoining cells and in tiers that use a common ventilation system.   \nThird, the routine operations of the Jail require high levels of movement of \npeople.  Detained persons must be escorted from their cells to common areas like \nshower and bathroom facilities.  In normal times they are escorted to court hearings and \nrecreational areas (all or nearly all of which have come to a stop).  Finally, large \nnumbers of staff personnel, as well as vendors, move in and out of the Jail and its \nvarious areas on a daily basis.  In doing so, these individuals have contact with other \nmembers of the community at large, who themselves may have contracted coronavirus.  \nThus staff members and contractors potentially can carry the virus both into and out of \nthe Jail. \nLimiting exposure to the coronavirus in the Jail is therefore a significant \nchallenge.  Infection rate data reflects that it has been challenging to effectively curb \ntransmission of the highly infectious coronavirus in the setting of the Jail.  As of April 6, \n2020, the infection rate within the Jail was an order of magnitude higher than the rate of \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 8 of 87 PageID #:1941\ninfection in Cook County.  Mays, 2020 WL 1812381, at *8.  And on April 8, 2019, the \nNew York Times reported that, at that time, the Jail was the largest-known source of \ncoronavirus infections in the United States.  See Timothy Williams and Danielle Ivory, \nChicago’s Jail Is Top U.S. Hot Spot as Virus Spreads Behind Bars (April 8, 2020), N.Y. \nTimes, https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/coronavirus-cook-county-jail-\nchicago.html (last updated April 23, 2020). \nProcedural History \nA.  Plaintiffs' suit and motion for a temporary restraining order \n  The plaintiffs, Anthony Mays and Kenneth Foster, are detained at the Cook \nCounty Jail and have been housed on tiers in which at least one person had been \ninfected with the coronavirus.  On April 3, 2020, they sued the Sheriff on behalf of \nthemselves and others similarly situated, with allegations stemming from the risks the \ncoronavirus poses to their health.  The plaintiffs seek to represent a class and two \nputative subclasses.  The class consists of \"all people who are currently or who will in \nthe future be housed in the Cook County Jail for the duration of the COVID-19 \npandemic.\"  Compl. (dkt. no. 1) ¶ 60.  \"Subclass A consists of all people who, because \nof age or previous medical conditions, are at particularly grave risk of harm from \nCOVID-19.\"  Id. ¶ 61.  \"Subclass B consists of all people who are currently housed on a \ntier where someone already tested positive for the coronavirus.\"  Id. ¶ 62.  Mays and \nFoster both have medical conditions that heighten their risk of serious health \nconsequences from an infection by the coronavirus.   \nIn their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that because the Sheriff was not \nimplementing measures to control the spread of the coronavirus at the Jail, especially \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 9 of 87 PageID #:1942\nthose recommended in the CDC Guidelines, the conditions in the Jail facilitated rapid \ntransmission, putting the health of detained persons at great risk.  In support of this \ncontention, the plaintiffs attached several affidavits to their complaint from individuals \nwho had spoken to persons detained at the jail.  These affidavits reported the following \nconditions at the Jail in late March and early April: \n•  detained persons were not receiving soap, hand sanitizer, or facemasks; \n•  facemasks that they made for themselves out of cloth were being confiscated; \n•  detainees were being housed in bunks or beds that were between two and \nfour feet apart from each other; \n•  many detained persons were living in dormitory-style housing, where dozens \nof individuals shared a single room; \n•  detained persons were being held at intake in so-called bullpens, where \nnumerous detainees were held together for extended periods in a crowded \ncell; and \n•  the Jail's staff was not regularly sanitizing common surfaces or providing \ndetainees with cleaning supplies to do this themselves.   \n  The day they filed suit, the plaintiffs moved for the issuance of writs of habeas \ncorpus for the members of subclass A and for a TRO or preliminary injunction on behalf \nof the class as a whole, requiring the Sheriff to take action to control the rapid spread of \nthe coronavirus at the Jail.  The plaintiffs also moved to certify their proposed class and \nsubclasses.   \nAfter an extended hearing on the motion for a temporary restraining order, the \nCourt issued a written decision on April 9, 2020 denying the request for writs of habeas \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 10 of 87 PageID #:1943\ncorpus and partially, but not entirely, granting the motion for a TRO.  Mays, 2020 WL \n1812381, at *6, 14–16.  In ruling on this motion, the Court considered the affidavits from \nmedical experts, individuals who had spoken to detainees, and those from Jail officials \nand employees.  The Sheriff had raised a hearsay objection to the Court's consideration \nof the affidavits from individuals who had spoken to detainees, but hearsay may be \nconsidered in ruling on a motion for a TRO or for a preliminary injunction.  See SEC v. \nCherif, 933 F.2d 403, 412 n.8 (7th Cir. 1991).3  The TRO directed the Sheriff to take the \nfollowing actions: (1) establish and implement a policy requiring prompt testing of \nsymptomatic detainees, and—if medically appropriate and feasible based on the \navailability of testing materials—detainees who may have been exposed to the virus; \n(2) implement social distancing during intake and suspend the use of bullpens to hold \ndetained persons awaiting intake; (3) provide all detained persons with adequate soap \nor sanitizer for hand hygiene; (4) provide staff personnel and detained persons with \nadequate cleaning supplies to regularly sanitize surfaces and objects, including in high-\ntraffic areas such as shower facilities; (5) establish a policy requiring frequent sanitation \nof these areas; and (6) provide facemasks to all detained persons in quarantine.  Mays, \n2020 WL 1812381, at *14–15.   \nThe Court denied several of the plaintiffs' requests for relief.  They sought an \norder mandating social distancing throughout the facility, not just at intake, arguing that \n                                            \n3  \"Given its temporary nature, 'a preliminary injunction is customarily granted on the \nbasis of procedures that are less formal and evidence that is less complete than in a \ntrial on the merits.'\"  FTC v. Lifewatch Inc., 176 F. Supp. 3d 757, 761 (N.D. Ill. 2016) \n(quoting Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981)).  The same, of course, \nis true of a TRO. \n \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 11 of 87 PageID #:1944\nthis was one of the critical outbreak control measures outlined in the CDC Guidelines.  \nId. at *10.  The Court declined to mandate social distancing beyond intake, reasoning \nthat there are space constraints at the Jail and the Guidelines expressly recognized that \nsocial distancing may not be feasible in a correctional facility.  Id.  The Court also \ndeclined the plaintiffs' request for direct screening of medically vulnerable detainees \nbefore they show symptoms of infection, also because the CDC Guidelines did not \nmandate this.  Id.  In addition, the Court denied the plaintiffs' request to require the \nSheriff issue facemasks to every detained person, as the CDC Guidelines \nrecommended this only for those who had come into contact with a symptomatic \nindividual.  Id. at *12, 15.  Finally, the Court declined the plaintiffs' request to transfer the \nmembers of subclass B to a safe facility or other forms of custody, because the plaintiffs \nhad failed to show that the other protective measures that the Court had ordered would \nbe inadequate to protect detained persons from the health risks associated with the \ncoronavirus outbreak.  Id. at *15. The Court also declined subclass A's request for \nemergency writs of habeas corpus, concluding that they had failed to exhaust available \nstate court remedies.  Id. at *6.  \nB.  The Sheriff's response and current conditions at the Jail \n  1.  April 13 status report \nOn April 13, pursuant to the Court's direction, the Sheriff filed a status report \nregarding compliance with the TRO.  First, with respect to the directive to test \nsymptomatic detainees, the Sheriff reported that Cermak Health Services, an arm of \nCook County that provides healthcare to persons detained at the Jail, maintains the \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 12 of 87 PageID #:1945\nsupplies for medical testing and actually administers such tests.4  According to the \nSheriff, Cermak had determined that it would not be medically appropriate to test all \ndetained persons in quarantine.  The Sheriff therefore instructed his personnel to isolate \nand refer symptomatic detainees to Cermak for further evaluation and testing.   \nAs to the order to maintain social distancing during the Jail's intake process, the \nSheriff implemented a modified procedure that maintains six feet of distance between all \ndetained persons awaiting intake and provides them with facemasks.  Use of the \nbullpens was discontinued. \nRegarding the order to distribute facemasks, the Sheriff stated that he had \nacquired and on hand sufficient surgical masks to distribute to all quarantined detainees \nand employees and that he was continuing his efforts to obtain additional masks.  \nAdditionally, the Sheriff was in the process of procuring cloth masks that would be \navailable to any detained person who requested one.   \nThe Sheriff further reported that on April 9, he delivered approximately 28 gallons \nof hand sanitizer and 980 bars of soap for distribution in the Jail.  He also ordered \ndistribution of soap and sanitizer twice per week going forward.  The Sheriff noted \nconcern that some detained persons may use the soap or hand sanitizer as a weapon \nand that some might try to consume hand sanitizer.  These considerations required the \nSheriff to determine on a detainee-by-detainee basis whether to distribute hand \nsanitizer or soap. \nWith respect to the sanitation-related directives in the TRO, the Sheriff reported \n                                            \n4 From a chain-of-command standpoint, Cermak is under the control of Cook County, \nnot the Sheriff. \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 13 of 87 PageID #:1946\nthat he had distributed cleaning supplies to staff and detained persons on April 10.  He \nalso issued a sanitation policy to ensure that frequently touched areas such as \ndoorknobs and phones are sanitized between uses.  He issued another a policy \nrequiring each living unit officer to ensure that surfaces are routinely cleaned and \nsanitized during the officer's shift.  Additionally, the Sheriff stated that he was planning \nto hire an independent contractor to professionally clean the Jail. \n  2.  April 17 updates from the Sheriff \nOn April 17, three days after the Sheriff submitted his status report, officials from \nthe Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH), including one designated as a CDC \nepidemic intelligence service officer, inspected the Jail.  These officials had toured the \nJail roughly a month prior, on March 20, and issued recommendations for controlling \nCOVID-19 at the Jail.  A report from this inspection, dated March 27, was introduced in \nconnection with the preliminary injunction hearing held on April 23.  The March 27 \nrecommendations from the CDPH included screening and classifying inmates based on \ntheir level of risk associated with coronavirus disease and \"considering mass release of \ninmates to decompress the jail for urgent public health reasons.\"  Levin Dec. (dkt. no. \n70) at 10.   \nA report from the more recent April 17 had not yet been received by the Sheriff \nas of the April 23 hearing.  The Sheriff therefore submitted statements and testimony \nfrom two Jail officials who participated in the April site visit: Rebecca Levin, a senior \npublic health advisor to the Sheriff, and Michael Miller, the Executive Director of the \nCook County Department of Corrections.  Levin stated that during the April 17 \ninspection, the officials commended the Jail's efforts to reduce density in housing units.  \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 14 of 87 PageID #:1947\nMiller testified that the officials visited two of the dormitory units—Dorm 4, the largest \ndormitory unit, and Dorm 2—and commented positively about the organization and \ncleanliness of these spaces.   \nIn a declaration dated April 17, Miller also provided an update to the Sheriff's \nApril 14 status report on efforts to control the coronavirus outbreak at the Jail.  He \nreported that each person detained in a quarantine tier was receiving a new surgical-\ntype facemask each day.  Miller anticipated that at its current rate of consumption of \nmasks, the Sheriff would exhaust his supplies on June 7, 2020.  He added that, \"as \nsupplies permit,\" the Sheriff planned to distribute masks to detainees who are not on \nquarantine tiers.  Miller Dec., Def.'s Resp. to Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj., Ex. E (dkt. \nno. 62-5) ¶ 24. \nAlthough the TRO did not require the Sheriff to implement social distancing \nbeyond modifying his intake procedures, Miller reported in his April 17 affidavit that the \nSheriff had engaged in a significant effort to increase social distancing at the Jail.  \nSpecifically, he reported the following measures: opening previously closed divisions to \nbetter distribute detainees across available space; converting housing on 175 tiers to \nsingle-occupancy cells only; limiting dormitory units to fifty percent of capacity, with the \nexception of detainees in medical or \"restricted housing,\" id. ¶ 12; and limiting the \nnumber of detained persons released into dayroom common areas to half the number \nassigned to that area.  He reported that beds in dormitory units have been spaced so \nthat they are at least six feet apart, and if beds are bolted to the floor, then detained \npersons are distributed so that there is six feet of distance between occupied beds.   \nAttached to Miller's declaration was a spreadsheet with the occupancy rates as of \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 15 of 87 PageID #:1948\nApril 17 on each tier of the Jail, including units in Cermak and Division 8, the Residential \nTreatment Unit (RTU).  Miller later explained that the RTU provides twenty-four-hour \naccess to medical care and houses people who have medical needs (though the level of \nneed was not described).  This spreadsheet showed, apparently contrary to the \nstatement in Miller's declaration, that some dormitory units were still occupied above \nfifty percent capacity.  For example, Tier D of Dorm 1 in Division 2, which was not then \nunder quarantine, was occupied at eighty-one percent capacity.  In addition, many \ndormitory units in the RTU, Division 8, were occupied at nearly full capacity.  For \nexample, Tier 2F was occupied at ninety-seven percent capacity, and Tier 2G was \noccupied at one hundred percent capacity.  (Also, Tiers 2Q and 2R in Division 6 were \noccupied at sixty percent and sixty-three percent capacity, respectively.  They are not \nlabeled as dormitory units in the spreadsheet, but they each have a forty-person \ncapacity.) \nThe Sheriff submitted additional evidence reflecting that his ability to implement \nsocial distancing had increased by virtue of, among other things, a significant expansion \nof the electronic home monitoring program.  He offered a chart showing a steady \ndecline in the Jail's daily population over the previous month, including a reduction of \nroughly 230 detainees between April 9, when the Court issued the TRO, and April 17.  \nAnother chart showed a steady increase in the jail's electronic home monitoring \npopulation over the previous month, with an increase of approximately 300 detainees on \nelectronic home monitoring between April 9 and April 17.  The Sheriff also offered \nevidence, however, that utilization of this program had been extended to its outside \nlimits, or nearly so, in light of the apparent exhaustion of program vendor's supply of \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 16 of 87 PageID #:1949\nmonitoring equipment.   \n3.  Plaintiffs' reports regarding conditions at the Jail \nIn anticipation of the preliminary injunction hearing, the plaintiffs submitted a \nnumber of affidavits identifying problems or deficiencies in the Sheriff's compliance with \nthe directives in the TRO.  These affidavits were from individuals who had spoken to \ndetained persons between April 14 and April 18, and they described these persons' \ncurrent experiences at the Jail.  According to these affidavits, symptomatic individuals \nare not being tested.  Additionally, although facemasks are now being distributed, \ndetainees reported, it is not happening regularly. \nThe detained persons discussed in the affidavits also reported inadequacies in \ncleaning and sanitation practices at the Jail.  Several stated that detained persons lack \ncleaning supplies for their individual cells and that some common spaces lack cleaning \nsupplies as well.  And even where cleaning solution is available, they reported, cloths or \nwipes have not been provided to enable use of the solution.  A number of detainees \nalso reported that commonly used objects, such as telephones, are not being sanitized \nbetween uses.  In addition, they stated, the Jail's staff has not been cleaning cells, and \nsome common areas are cleaned only every other day, meaning they stand uncleaned \ndespite multiple uses and repeated touching by numerous detained persons and \npotentially staff personnel. \nThe detainees also reported an inability or great difficulty in practicing social \ndistancing.  In common areas where detained persons eat, several stated, it has been \nimpossible to practice social distancing due to the arrangement of picnic-style benches.  \nTape or paint markings have been placed on the floor in some dayrooms to designate \n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 17 of 87 PageID #:1950\nappropriate space for social distancing, but, they reported, some correctional officers \nhave mocked the practice of social distancing, and many have failed to enforce it.  By \nway of example, detained persons have been using, at the same time, telephones that \nare spaced only two feet apart.   \nC.  The renewed preliminary injunction motion \n  In their renewed motion for a preliminary injunction, filed on April 14, 2020, the \nplaintiffs contend that the Sheriff's efforts in response to the TRO \"have not worked and \ncannot work to abate the spread of the disease\" caused by the coronavirus.  Pls.' \nRenewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 55) at 4.  The plaintiffs focus primarily on two \ninadequacies of the Sheriff's efforts to date:  failure to identify and transfer medically \nvulnerable detainees out of the Jail, and insufficient social distancing, which, the \nplaintiffs contend, \"is the only way to prevent intolerable risk to [their] health and lives.\"  \nId. at 2.  \nThe plaintiffs request the following in their renewed motion for a preliminary \ninjunction.  First, they ask for a preliminary injunction ordering the Sheriff to mandate \nsocial distancing throughout the Jail.  In support of this request, the plaintiffs have \nsubmitted the declaration of Dr. Gregg Gonsalves, an epidemiologist at the Yale School \nof Medicine and School of Public Health, who opined that social distancing is \"the only \nway to prevent further, essentially uncontrolled, spread of the virus\" in the Jail.  Id., Ex. \nG (dkt. no. 55-7) ¶ 29.  In the alternative, the plaintiffs argue that if the Court concludes \nthat additional social distancing is not possible, an order should be entered requiring the \nSheriff to transfer detained persons to another safe facility, or the Court should request \nconvening a three-judge panel with the authority to order the release of detainees, as \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 18 of 87 PageID #:1951\nrequired under the Prison Litigation Reform Act .  See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3)(B).  In \naddition, subclass A has renewed its request for issuance of emergency writs of habeas \ncorpus.5     \nIn response, the Sheriff argues that he has sufficiently addressed the risks to the \nhealth of persons in his custody, in accordance with constitutional requirements, \nthrough the protective measures he has already implemented; his efforts were \nconsistent with the recommendations in the CDC Guidelines; and he has taken \nsubstantial steps to implement social distancing.  The Sheriff also appears to contend \nthat further implementation of social distancing was not realistically possible in the Jail \nat this time.  In response to the plaintiff's contention that the Sheriff has not adequately \nabated the risk of infection to medically vulnerable detainees, he argues that he cannot \nscreen such individuals, because he does not have access to detained persons' health \ninformation.  Furthermore, the Sheriff has explained, he already refers all medical \ncomplaints and issues to Cermak, and nothing more on his part is required to satisfy the \nrequirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nIn their reply brief, the plaintiffs acknowledge that the Sheriff has taken \"dramatic \nsteps\" to increase social distancing in the Jail.  Pls.' Reply in Supp. of Renewed Mot. for \nPrelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 64) at 6.  They contend, however, that these efforts have been \ninsufficient to remedy the constitutional violation.  They reaffirm their request to \nimmediately convene a three-judge court to determine whether to release detained \npersons.  They also reaffirm their request for a preliminary injunction mandating social \n                                            \n5 The plaintiffs also sought expedited discovery, but that largely became a moot point in \nlight of later developments, so the Court does not discuss the request here. \n18 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 19 of 87 PageID #:1952\ndistancing throughout the Jail as well as transfer of detained persons to \"some other \nsafe location,\" id. at 2, and they ask the Court to issue such an order \ncontemporaneously with a request to convene a three-judge panel.  Additionally, the \nplaintiffs ask the Court to convert the TRO to a preliminary injunction. \n1.  Hearing on motion for preliminary injunction \nThe Court held an evidentiary hearing on the preliminary injunction motion by \nvideoconference on April 23, 2020.  In light of the unusually compressed time schedule \nnecessitated by the development of the coronavirus pandemic and increases in \nconfirmed coronavirus infections at the Jail, the Court determined that it would consider \nthe parties' affidavits (giving due consideration to issues regarding weight) and would \npermit each side to call one live witness.  Executive Director Miller testified as the \nSheriff's witness; he offered, among other things, updates to his April 17 affidavit \nregarding the Sheriff's efforts to manage the coronavirus outbreak.   \nWith respect to screening medically vulnerable detainees, Miller testified that the \nJail was doing what it could based on the limited medical information that it has \navailable.  Miller explained that Cermak conducts a medical evaluation of every \ndetained person at intake, and based on this, it transmits information called \"alerts\" to \nthe Jail to inform housing decisions based on medical needs.  These alerts do not \ncontain any diagnostic information; rather, they simply specify the accommodations \nnecessary to address a medical need.  For example, an alert from Cermak may inform \nthe Jail that a detained person should be housed on a bottom bunk, but it will not state \nthe medical reason for this determination.  Miller testified that Cermak has not \"yet\" \ncreated an alert for those who have heightened risk of severe health consequences \n19 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 20 of 87 PageID #:1953\nfrom a coronavirus infection.  Without such an alert, Miller explained that the Jail is \nconducting coronavirus screening based on any medical information about a detained \nperson that it already has, including existing alerts.   \nMiller also reported that the Jail had made additional efforts to implement social \ndistancing.  To encourage persons housed in dormitory units to stay at their beds rather \nthan congregating in common spaces, the Jail has been providing them with free books, \nwriting pads, and puzzle books.  In addition, Miller stated, detainees throughout the Jail \nare now released to use shared shower facilities one at a time.  In common areas, six-\nfoot intervals have been demarcated with spray paint markings.  Correctional officers, \nMiller said, have been trained to enforce social distancing by first communicating to \ndetained persons the importance of maintaining the distance, and if that fails, using \ndisincentives such as loss of microwave privileges.  Miller acknowledged that despite \nthis, detainees have not always been practicing social distancing and that they continue \nto congregate in common spaces such as eating areas. \nMiller reported that the Jail's staff has worked diligently to increase the Jail's \nability to reduce the density of the population in its housing units.  Over the past month, \nhe stated, the Jail has opened up several hundred additional housing units.  Between \nApril 17 and April 23, the Jail doubled the number of detainees housed in single-\noccupancy cells, and this effort included moving 260 detainees out of double-occupancy \ncells.  Miller stated that there are currently no detainees housed in double-occupancy \ncells without a medical or security reason.  Most of those who are still in double-\noccupancy cells, he said, are either housed by Cermak or are designated by Cermak as \nrequiring placement in a double-occupancy cell due to a health condition or possible \n20 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 21 of 87 PageID #:1954\nsuicide risk.  Miller did not explain why a health condition might require placement in a \ndouble-occupancy cell.  Some of those in double-occupancy cells have been placed \nthere, he said, due to disorderly conduct—though, again, he did not explain how double-\ncelling serves a security purpose in such situations.  Miller acknowledged on cross \nexamination that social distancing is impossible for persons housed in double-\noccupancy cells. \nMiller also reported that roughly 1,000 detainees are still being housed in \ndormitory units.  He stated that approximately seventy percent of that population must \nremain in those units due to a medical need, though he did not explain this.  As for the \nremainder, Miller cited one possible non-medical reason that some detainees must \nremain in dorm units: they are housed there in accordance with requirements of the \nPrison Rape Elimination Act.  He explained that it would be \"very challenging to try to \nseparate those individuals and keep them protected as we need to under the PREA Act \nso that those individuals are not vulnerable in other areas while they're incarcerated.\"  \nApril 23, 2020 Tr. at 46–47.  Again, however, Miller did not explain this. \nMiller supplemented his testimony with an updated spreadsheet showing the \noccupancy of the Jail's housing units as of April 23.  This spreadsheet showed that the \ncapacity of almost every tier that was not in Cermak, the RTU, or under quarantine was \nfifty percent or below.  However, in Division 2, Tier D1-D was at eighty-one percent \ncapacity, and Tier D4-R was at fifty-nine percent (Tier D3-B was right at fifty percent).  A \nnumber of Cermak and RTU tiers had occupancy rates as high as ninety-seven or one \nhundred percent.   \nOn cross examination, the plaintiffs' counsel asked Miller about the high \n21 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 22 of 87 PageID #:1955\noccupancy levels in certain Cermak and RTU tiers reported in the April 17 and April 22 \nspreadsheets.  Miller explained that Cermak needed to house those individuals together \nto be able to provide them with access to care at all hours of the day or night.  Miller \nacknowledged that social distancing was not possible for those housed in the Cermak \nand RTU tiers.   \nPlaintiffs' counsel also asked Miller about a high occupancy rate listed in the April \n17 spreadsheet for a tier (referenced above) that was not in Cermak, the RTU, or under \nquarantine: Tier D of Dorm 1 in Division 2, which was then at eighty-one percent \ncapacity.  The April 22 spreadsheet showed that the dorm was still at the same \ncapacity.  Miller stated: \"There's another security level and/or issue with having this \nmany people on this tier that we've had to abide by.\"  Id. at 31.  He did not clarify the \nnature of the security issue.  Miller acknowledged that social distancing was not \npossible for detainees on that tier.   \nWhen the Court asked Miller if there was still room at the Jail to move more \ndetainees out of dorms and into cells, Miller responded, \"I do have a plan in my back \npocket.\"  Id. at 57.  He explained that he was working on moving people out of Dorms 1, \n2, and 3.  He added that the Jail is considering reconfiguring housing arrangements on \ntiers for detainees who are women to see if there is a way to create more capacity, \npresumably to disperse the much larger population of detainees who are men.   \n  As for cleaning and sanitation of common areas, Miller reported that detainees \nhave been given the supplies they need to do sanitation; he attributed shortfalls in \nsanitation to their own behavior.  For example, he stated, at each microwave stations \nand shared showers and toilets, detained persons have been provided cleaning solution \n22 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 23 of 87 PageID #:1956\nso that they can sanitize the facility prior to use.   \n  Finally, Miller stated, to ensure implementation of its response measures, such \nas sanitation of common areas or use of PPE, the Sheriff has deployed \"audit teams\" \nthat oversee these efforts.  For example, the Jail has a PPE audit team that patrols PPE \nuse and educates staff members and detained persons who are not using PPE \nproperly. \nPlaintiffs called as their hearing witness Dr. Homer Venters, a medical doctor \nwith over a decade of experience in correctional health.  Dr. Venters is the former \nDeputy Medical Director of the New York City Jail Correctional Health Service, a \nposition in which he oversaw care of detainees and medical policies governing care in \nNew York City's twelve jails.  He had previously submitted a declaration along with \nplaintiffs' preliminary injunction reply brief.  At the hearing, he testified that, in his view, \nthe Jail's coronavirus response efforts have three key deficiencies: (1) lack of a \ncohesive coronavirus response plan; (2) failure to screen for individuals at higher risk of \nexperiencing severe health consequences from a coronavirus infection; and \n(3) insufficient social distancing.   \nFirst, Dr. Venters explained that having a cohesive plan, rather than a collection \nof policy documents that address different aspects of emergency response, is a critical \nfirst step to addressing an outbreak of a communicable disease in a jail facility.  He \nstated that because jails are such complex systems, employing and housing several \nthousand people, it is not possible to respond to a large outbreak without a single, \ncoordinate plan that coordinates response measures implemented by security, health, \nand administrative staff.   \n23 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 24 of 87 PageID #:1957\nSecond, Dr. Venters testified that screening medically vulnerable individuals is \ncritical so that they can immediately receive heightened surveillance of possible \nsymptoms of a coronavirus infection.  This heightened surveillance would entail daily \nchecks on those individuals for symptoms such as elevated temperature, shortness of \nbreath, and fatigue.      \nThird, Dr. Venters emphasized the importance of social distancing in combatting \nthe spread of coronavirus.  In his declaration, Dr. Venters stated that medical literature \non the coronavirus confirms that social distancing is an essential strategy in controlling \nan outbreak.  During the hearing, he explained that because the coronavirus spreads so \neasily through respiratory droplets emitted from an infected person, transmission \"is \ngreatly impeded by physical distance that we establish through social distancing.\"  Id. at \n67.   \nDuring his testimony, Dr. Venters emphasized that practicing social distancing \nonly in some specific areas of a congregate setting like the Jail is insufficient to curb \nvirus transmission rates.  Because people are densely packed in many contexts during \nroutine operations of a detention facility—e.g., sleeping areas, dayrooms, shower \nfacilities, and areas where medication is dispensed—it is critical to implement social \ndistancing throughout the entire facility.  Dr. Venters explained that a \"lack of a full \ncommitment or complete commitment to social distancing\" in the Jail would promote \nfaster transmission of the coronavirus, and more detainees and staff would become \n\"seriously ill.\"  Id. at 74.  In his declaration, Dr. Venters had observed that the concern \nabout severe health effects is heightened when considering detainees, because they \nare statistically more likely than the general public to have pre-existing health problems \n24 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 25 of 87 PageID #:1958\nsuch as cardiovascular disease and cancer. \nDr. Venters also discussed the importance of communication with detainees and \nstaff as a means to ensure that they practice social distancing in an appropriate way.  \nSpecifically, he said, to ensure widespread observance of this practice, individuals must \nunderstand what social distancing means and why it is important.   \n On cross examination, Dr. Venters acknowledged that outbreak management in \na correctional setting imposes \"unique challenges,\" id. at 79, and that the CDC \nGuidelines are \"now the most important set of principles\" on response, id. at 81.  He \nalso acknowledged that the CDC Guidelines provide that social distancing might not \nalways be feasible in a correctional setting.   \nDr. Venters testified that although use of single-occupancy cells facilitates social \ndistancing, doing so poses a risk of increasing detainees' psychological distress from \nsocial isolation.  He also testified that the Jail's practice of housing detainees with \nmental health conditions in double-occupancy cells is inappropriate, because they \ncannot practice social distancing at all.  Though these two concerns point in opposite \ndirections, Dr. Venters reconciled them by clarifying that, in the current pandemic \nenvironment, housing detainees in single-occupancy cells is preferable to double-\noccupancy because social distancing is critical.  To address the psychological toll of \nisolation in single-occupancy cells, Dr. Venters testified, the Jail should provide \nopportunities for detained persons to come out of their cells and benefit from \nengagement with others in common areas while practicing social distancing.   \nDr. Venters's testimony largely buttressed the points made by several other \nmedical doctors and epidemiologists in affidavits and declarations that the plaintiffs had \n25 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 26 of 87 PageID #:1959\nattached to their complaint and briefing of this motion.  The plaintiffs' medical, public \nhealth, and correctional health experts have analogized the conditions in the Jail to \nthose on cruise ships, which have experienced some of the largest concentrated \noutbreaks of the coronavirus.  Specifically, these experts observe, a jail, like a cruise \nship, is an environmentally enclosed, congregate-living setting with high levels of \nmovement of people.  Mohareb Dec., Pls.'

B (dkt. no. 1-2) ¶¶ 24, 25, 26.   \nIn particular, Dr. Amir Mohareb, a medical doctor who is a biothreat response \nexpert and an instructor at Harvard Medical School, used the example of the Diamond \nPrincess cruise ship to highlight the importance of social distancing.  The Diamond \nPrincess sailed from Japan to Hong Kong in January of this year.  After one of its \npassengers tested positive for the coronavirus in the last week of January, \"strict \nprecautions of hand hygiene and cabin isolation were implemented for all crew and \npassengers.\"  Mohareb Dec. (dkt. no. 64-3) at 5.  Despite these efforts, 700 of the \npeople who had been on the ship tested positive for the virus over the course of the \nfollowing month.  This example, Dr. Mohareb, said, reflects that in the context of a \ncongregate living arrangement like a cruise ship, hand hygiene and cabin cell isolation \nare insufficient to control the transmission of the coronavirus.  He stated that a jail, \nwhich is similarly a congregate environment, \"constitutes an equal or greater risk setting \nto that of a cruise ship.\"  Id.   \nDr. Mohareb explained that because respiratory droplets emitted by an infected \nperson can travel up to six feet and be inhaled by another, social distancing is \"a \n26 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 27 of 87 PageID #:1960\nnecessary intervention to prevent the spread of infection\" from the coronavirus.  Id. at 3, \n6.  He emphasized that social distancing is particularly important because an infected \nperson may be mildly symptomatic or not symptomatic at all.  Dr. Mohareb also noted \nthat numerous authoritative bodies, including the CDC, the World Health Organization, \nand the Infectious Diseases Society of America, have recommended social distancing \nto control the transmission of coronavirus.  He added that mathematical modeling \nsupports a conclusion that social distancing is \"the primary means by which individuals \ncan be safely protected from the threat of COVID-19.\"  Id. at 5.   \nAll of the plaintiffs' expert affidavits emphasized the critical need to implement \nsocial distancing in order to meaningfully control the spread of the virus.  Gonsalves \nDec. ¶ 29 (social distancing is the \"only way\" to control outbreak); see also Rasmussen-\nTorvik Dec., Pls.' Reply in Supp. of Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj., Ex. C (dkt. no. 64-4) \n¶ 9.  They reiterated Dr. Venters's point that the very design of a correctional facilities \npromotes transmission of the coronavirus because it densely packs large groups of \npeople together.  Dr. Gonsalves stated that although correctional facilities are like cruise \nships in that they are enclosed environments, they present an even higher risk of rapid \ntransmission of the coronavirus because of \"conditions of crowding, the proportion of \nvulnerable people detained, and often scant medical care resources.\"  Gonsalves Dec. \n¶ 17.  In a joint declaration, five medical doctors with experience working in a \ncorrectional setting—including three doctors who had worked at the Jail—similarly \nobserved that the \"crowded congregate housing arrangements\" of jails and prisons \npromote the transmission of respiratory illnesses like the coronavirus disease.  Med. \nProfs.' Dec.

According to Dr. \nGonsalves, \"young and healthy individuals may be more susceptible than originally \nthought.\"  Gonsalves Dec. ¶ 5.  He reported that in March, the CDC reported that one-\nfifth of infected people between the ages of twenty to forty-four had been hospitalized.  \nDr. Mohareb also stated that \"a fraction of patients with COVID-19 in all groups go on to \ndevelop severe respiratory disease.\"  Mohareb Dec. at 1. \nAt the conclusion of the April 23 preliminary injunction hearing, the Court \nextended the TRO, which was set to expire that day, pending its ruling on the motion for \na preliminary injunction.   \nDiscussion \n  \"A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy.\"  Whitaker ex rel. Whitaker \nv. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034, 1044 (7th Cir. 2017).   \nA court's determination of whether to issue a preliminary injunction or temporary \nrestraining order involves a two-step inquiry, with a threshold phase and a balancing \nphase.  Id.  First, the party seeking the preliminary injunction has to make a threshold \nshowing, which has three elements: (1) reasonable likelihood of success on the merits \nof the claim; (2) irreparable harm to the movant absent preliminary injunctive relief; \n(3) lack of adequate remedies at law.  Id.  If the movant makes the threshold showing, \nthe court proceeds to the balancing step, in which it determines \"whether the balance of \nharm favors the moving party or whether the harm to other parties or the public \n28 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 29 of 87 PageID #:1962\nsufficiently outweighs the movant’s interests.\"  Id. \nBecause they request relief that changes the status quo or requires the Sheriff to \ntake affirmative action, the plaintiffs are requesting what is sometimes referred to as \n\"mandatory\" preliminary injunctive relief.  See Graham v. Med. Mut. of Ohio, 130 F.3d \n293, 295 (7th Cir. 1997); O'Malley v. Chrysler Corp., 160 F.2d 35, 37 (7th Cir. \n1947); cf. Schrier v. Univ. Of Co., 427 F.3d 1253, 1260 (10th Cir. 2005) (\"[D]etermining \nwhether an injunction is mandatory as opposed to prohibitory can be vexing.\").  \nMandatory preliminary injunctions typically are \"cautiously viewed and sparingly \nissued.\"  Graham, 130 F.3d at 295 (quoting Jordan v. Wolke, 593 F.2d 772, 774 (7th \nCir. 1978)); see also Knox v. Shearing, 637 F. App'x 226, 228 (7th Cir. 2016).  But \n\"there may be situations justifying a mandatory temporary injunction compelling the \ndefendant to take affirmative action\" based on the circumstances, Jordan, 593 F.2d at \n774, and \"the clearest [of] equitable grounds,\" W. A. Mack, Inc. v. Gen. Motors Corp., \n260 F.2d 886, 890 (7th Cir. 1958).  At least two courts have recognized the unusual \nnature of mandatory preliminary injunctions and yet issued them after finding violations \nof the rights of people in custody during the coronavirus pandemic.  See Barbecho v. \nDecker, No. 20-CV-2821 (AJN), 2020 WL 1876328, at *2, 8–9 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 15, 2020); \nJones v. Wolf, No. 20-CV-361, 2020 WL 1643857, at *2, 14–15 (W.D.N.Y. Apr. 2, \n2020). \n  In assessing each claim, the Court will address the first threshold requirement for \na preliminary injunction: likelihood of success on the merits, which requires showing \nonly a \"better than negligible\" chance of success.  Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1046 (quoting \nCooper v. Salazar, 196 F.3d 809, 813 (7th Cir. 1999)).  Generally speaking, \"[t]his is a \n29 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 30 of 87 PageID #:1963\nlow threshold,\" id., but the Court gives the matter greater scrutiny here in light of the fact \nthat plaintiffs are seeking affirmative conduct by the Sheriff.    \nA.  Habeas corpus claim    \n  Plaintiffs and subclass A have petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 \nU.S.C. § 2241.  The Court first addresses the issue of exhaustion of remedies and then \nconsiders subclass A's ability to satisfy the criteria for a representative action. \n  1.  Exhaustion \n  As the Court concluded in its TRO decision, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2241 is the appropriate mechanism for a state pretrial detainee to \nchallenge his or her detention.  Jackson v. Clements, 796 F.3d 841, 843 (7th Cir. 2015).  \n\"Because a pre-trial detainee is not yet in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State \ncourt, relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 is not available.\"  Id. (internal quotation marks \nomitted). \n  Section 2241 has no express exhaustion requirement, but courts apply a \ncommon-law exhaustion rule.  Richmond v. Scibana, 387 F.3d 602, 604 (7th Cir. 2004).  \nA pretrial detainee must \"exhaust all avenues of state relief\" before seeking a writ of \nhabeas corpus through a section 2241 action.  See United States v. Castor, 937 F.2d \n293, 296–97 (7th Cir. 1991).  Although there are exceptions, \"the hurdle is high.\"  \nRichmond, 387 F.3d at 604.  In deciding whether an exception applies, courts \"must \nbalance the individual and institutional interests involved, taking into account 'the nature \nof the claim presented and the characteristics of the particular administrative procedure \nprovided.'\"  Gonzalez v. O'Connell, 355 F.3d 1010, 1016 (7th Cir. 2004) (quoting \nMcCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 146 (1992), superseded by statute on other \n30 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 31 of 87 PageID #:1964\ngrounds as recognized in Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516 (2002)).  A court may excuse \nexhaustion where: \n(1) requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies causes prejudice, due \nto unreasonable delay or an indefinite timeframe for administrative action; \n(2) the agency lacks the ability or competence to resolve the issue or grant \nthe relief requested; (3) appealing through the administrative process \nwould be futile because the agency is biased or has predetermined the \nissue; or (4) where substantial constitutional questions are raised.   \n \nId.  \n  It is undisputed that a state court has the authority to release a pretrial detainee.  \nA person who is detained in Illinois may challenge his or her detention by seeking \njudicial review of his or her bond.  725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/110-6.   On March 23, \n2020, in response to an emergency petition filed by the Cook County Public Defender, \nthe Presiding Judge of the Cook County Circuit Court's Criminal Division issued an \norder setting out an expedited bond hearing process that applied to seven designated \nclasses of detained persons.  Def.'s Resp. to Mot. for TRO, Ex. E (dkt. no. 31-1) at 1–2.  \nThe seven classes included those at an elevated risk of contracting coronavirus due to \ntheir ages or underlying medical conditions—that is, the putative members of subclass \nA.  Id.  The expedited hearings took place from March 24 through March 27.  Id. at 3–5.  \nAlthough the expedited hearings do not appear to be currently ongoing, Cook County's \ncourts are still available for emergency matters, and judges are hearing motions to \nreview or reduce bail daily at all locations where court is held.  Def.'s Supp. Resp. to \nMot. for TRO, Ex. A (dkt. no. 41-1) at 1. \n  In the TRO decision, the Court concluded that the plaintiffs—who both were \nnamed as representatives of subclass A—could not show that they exhausted available \nstate remedies before petitioning for habeas corpus because they did not \"contend that \n31 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 32 of 87 PageID #:1965\nthey sought expedited bond hearings or initiated any sort of state proceedings \nchallenging their bonds.\"  Mays, 2020 WL 1812381, at *6.  The Court declined to \nexcuse exhaustion because it found that the state's existing bond reduction process is \n\"anything but futile\"; the plaintiffs did not show that the process is \"unduly time-\nconsuming in a way that undermines their claimed constitutional rights\"; and they did \nnot show that state courts cannot remedy the type of constitutional violations they raise.  \nId.  \n  After the Court issued its decision, the plaintiffs' counsel learned that Foster had \nsought release in the Circuit Court of Cook County through an expedited bond hearing.  \n(The plaintiffs do not contend that Mays separately sought release in state court prior to \nthe filing of this lawsuit.)  Foster is charged with domestic battery, robbery, and unlawful \nrestraint.  Pls.' Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj., Ex. F (dkt. no. 55-6) at ECF p. 3 of 17.  His \nbail was set at $50,000, requiring him to post $5,000 to be released, which he is unable \nto afford.  Id.  In his motion to reduce bond, he described his serious medical conditions \nand explained that they place him at a heightened risk of becoming critically ill if he \ncontracts coronavirus.  Id. at ECF p. 4–5 of 17.  He also argued that it would violate his \nconstitutional rights to keep him in custody during the coronavirus pandemic.  Id. at ECF \np. 13 of 17.  On April 2, 2020, a state trial judge heard and denied Foster's motion.  See \nid. at ECF p. 16 of 17. \n  The plaintiffs argue that Foster has sufficiently presented his request to the state \ncourts and should not be required to do more.  They acknowledge that he has not \nexhausted all avenues of state relief:  he could appeal the state court's denial of his \nmotion to reduce his bond, but plaintiffs do not contend that he done so.  They argue, \n32 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 33 of 87 PageID #:1966\nhowever, that the Court should excuse exhaustion based on the futility of an appeal or \nthe Court's equitable authority to excuse exhaustion.  They contend that an appeal \nwould take weeks to pursue, making appellate remedies practically unavailable to him in \nlight of the urgency of the coronavirus pandemic and causing an unreasonable delay \nthat would force him to continue to suffer the alleged harm.  In support of this \ncontention, they offer an affidavit from Lester Finkle, the Chief of Staff to the Cook \nCounty Public Defender, who explains the procedure for interlocutory appeals of denials \nto modify bail.  Pls.' Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj., Ex. C (dkt. no. 55-3).  Under Illinois \nSupreme Court Rule 604(c), before a defendant can file such an appeal, he must file a \nverified motion in the trial court providing certain information about himself.  Id. ¶ 2.  \nOnly after the trial court denies the verified motion can the defendant file an appeal.  Id.  \nThe affidavit submitted by the plaintiffs reflects that this process typically takes two to \nfour weeks.  Id. ¶ 5.  After that, if the appellate court denies the defendant's appeal, he \ncan seek discretionary review in the Illinois Supreme Court.  Id. ¶ 3.  Based on this \ninformation, the plaintiffs argue that their state-court remedies are futile or practically \nunavailable and that requiring them to pursue these remedies would unfairly prejudice \nthem. \n  The plaintiffs' contentions are not persuasive.  Their only evidence, Finkle's \naffidavit, describes how long such an appeal would take under ordinary circumstances.  \nBut here we are not dealing with not ordinary circumstances.  The affidavit does not \nadequately show how the state appellate process would be expected to work for a \nmedically vulnerable detainee claiming that due to a global pandemic that has infiltrated \nthe Jail, he faces immediate risk of serious health consequences unless his bail is \n33 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 34 of 87 PageID #:1967\nreduced.  We know the state courts are capable of dealing with emergency requests of \nthis type promptly and efficiently; Cook County trial court judges dealt quickly and \nefficiently with hundreds of such requests in late March, and they continue to do so now.  \nThere is no reason to believe that the Illinois Appellate Court would treat such an appeal \nas an ordinary, run-of-the-mill bail issue and would refuse to deal with it promptly.  \nAlthough a court may excuse exhaustion in the unusual case where a state process \nwould cause an unreasonable delay, see, e.g., Gonzalez, 355 F.3d at 1016, the \nplaintiffs have not established that this is so in the present situation. \n  The plaintiffs also contend that the existing bond review processes provide no \neffective remedy for the claims that the class members advance in this case.  \nSpecifically, they contend that the Illinois statute governing bail, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. \nAnn. 5/110-5, does not require state courts to consider a detained person's medical \nhealth in deciding whether to set or reduce the amount of bail and that state judges \nmaking those decisions would not be expected to consider the medical risks at the Jail.  \nBut they point to no evidence that state courts are not permitted to consider detained \npersons' medical conditions, let alone that state courts reviewing bonds are not actively \nconsidering detained persons' medical conditions in light of the coronavirus pandemic.  \nTo the contrary, the evidence in the record suggests that state courts are considering \nthe medical dangers the coronavirus presents to detained persons.  As the Court \nindicated in its TRO decision, between early March and early April 2020, the Jail's \npopulation decreased by over 1,175 detainees, Mays, 2020 WL 1812381, at *6; since \nthen, the population has decreased by at least 300 more detainees, see Def.'s Resp. to \nRenewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj., Ex. A (dkt. no. 62-1) at 1.  An affidavit submitted by the \n34 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 35 of 87 PageID #:1968\nplaintiffs reflects that this reduction in the Jail's population has occurred, at least in part, \nbecause state court judges have granted bond reductions.  See Pls.' Renewed Mot. for \nPrelim. Inj., Ex. B (dkt. no. 55-2) ¶ 3 (state courts released 719 detainees through an \nexpedited process for bond reconsiderations in light of the coronavirus pandemic).  In \nshort, the contention that state courts cannot or will not consider detained persons' \nmedical conditions in bond review proceedings is unsupported.  Accordingly, the Court \nconcludes that the plaintiffs have not shown that the state courts do not provide an \neffective remedy for detained persons with medical conditions that place them at a high \nrisk of severe illness or death if they contract coronavirus. \n  The plaintiffs also appear to argue that the state courts cannot provide an \nadequate remedy because, they contend, unlike the federal habeas claims in this case, \nstate courts can consider factors other than medical need.  That contention is based on \nan erroneous premise, which the Court will discuss momentarily, that a district court \naddressing a habeas corpus petition challenging jail conditions under section 2241 \ncannot or would not consider other factors such as whether a detainee poses a threat to \npublic safety.  The bottom line is that the plaintiffs have not shown that the bond \nreduction remedy offered by the state courts is any less effective than a federal remedy. \n  For these reasons, the Court concludes—as it did in its TRO decision—that the \nplaintiffs have no likelihood of success on the habeas corpus claim advanced by them \non behalf the representatives of subclass A due to their failure to exhaust available state \ncourt remedies.   \n  2.  Representative action \n  Even if the plaintiffs could establish some likelihood of success on their \n35 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 36 of 87 PageID #:1969\ncontention that the failure to exhaust state remedies should be excused, they would be \nunable to satisfy the criteria for a representative action.  Although the Court need not \nactually certify a representative action at this point, before issuing a preliminary \ninjunction it would need to find that the requirements for such an action conditionally \nwould be met.  Mays, 2020 WL 1812381, at *3 (collecting cases).  Because the plaintiffs \ncannot satisfy those requirements, the representative class has no likelihood of success \non the merits. \n  In the Seventh Circuit, the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure that governs class \nactions, Rule 23, does not apply to habeas corpus proceedings.  Bijeol v. Benson, 513 \nF.2d 965, 967–68 (7th Cir. 1975); cf. Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1117 (9th Cir. \n2010).  But representative actions—which are analogous to class actions—on rare \noccasions can be brought in habeas corpus proceedings.  Bijeol, 513 F.2d at 967–68; \nsee also United States ex rel. Morgan v. Sielaff, 546 F.2d 218, 220–21 (7th Cir. 1976); \nKazarov v. Achim, No. 02 C 5097, 2003 WL 22956006, at *8 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 12, 2003); \nUnited States ex rel. Green v. Peters, 153 F.R.D. 615, 619 (N.D. Ill. 1994); Faheem-El \nv. Klincar, 600 F. Supp. 1029, 1033 (N.D. Ill. 1984).  The Seventh Circuit has not \"set \ndown a strict formula which must be mechanically followed\" before people in custody \ncan bring a representative habeas corpus action.  Morgan, 546 F.2d at 221.  Instead, it \nhas suggested that courts can look to the provisions of Rule 23 in determining whether \na representative action is appropriate, though courts need not \"precisely\" comply with \nRule 23.  Id. n.5.  The Court thus finds that Rule 23 is instructive in analyzing whether \nplaintiffs can bring a representative action.  The parties seem to agree; they discuss the \nissue within the framework of Rule 23. \n36 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 37 of 87 PageID #:1970\n  To bring a class action, and by analogy a representative action, a plaintiff must \nshow that the proposed class meets the four requirements of Rule 23(a):  \"numerosity, \ncommonality, typicality, and adequate representation.\"  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, \n564 U.S. 338, 349 (2011).  In addition, \"the proposed class must satisfy at least one of \nthe three requirements listed in Rule 23(b).\"  Id. at 345.  The plaintiffs here rely on, or \nanalogize to, Rule 23(b)(2), which applies when \"the party opposing the class has acted \nor refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive \nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\"  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \n  The parties dispute whether subclass A satisfies each requirement of Rule 23, as \napplied to representative actions, apart from numerosity.  The Court discusses each \ndisputed requirement in turn. \n    a.  Commonality \n  To establish that they are likely to satisfy the commonality requirement, the \nplaintiffs must show that there likely \"are questions of law or fact common to\" the \nmembers of subclass A.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  \"That language is easy to misread.\"  \nWal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 349.  \"Commonality requires the plaintiff[s] to demonstrate that \nthe class members have suffered the same injury.\"  Id. at 349–50 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  In addition, \"[t]heir claims must depend upon a common contention\" for \nwhich the \"determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the \nvalidity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\"  Id. at 350.  Thus \"what matters . . . is \nnot the raising of common ‘questions' . . . but rather, the capacity of a [representative] \nproceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.\"  Id. \n37 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 38 of 87 PageID #:1971\nat 350 (emphasis omitted).   \"Where the same conduct or practice by the same \ndefendant gives rise to the same kind of claims from all class members, there is a \ncommon question.\"  Suchanek v. Sturm Foods, Inc., 764 F.3d 750, 756 (7th Cir. 2014). \n  Subclass A conditionally satisfies the commonality requirement because the \nplaintiffs likely can show that its members \"suffered the same injury.\"  See Wal-Mart, \n564 U.S. at 349–50.  Specifically, the members of subclass A can show that the \nSheriff's response to the coronavirus pandemic gave rise to their habeas claim.  In \naddition, the plaintiffs point to several questions the determination of which, they \ncontend, will resolve issues that are central to the validity of their habeas claim.  For \npurposes of commonality, the Court need consider only one:  whether coronavirus \npresents so severe a risk of harm to some people in the Sheriff's custody such it is \nunconstitutional to confine them in in the Jail.6   In a representative proceeding, a \ncommon answer to that question likely would drive the resolution of the litigation by \nresolving a core issue underlying subclass A's request for a writ of habeas corpus.  \n  The Sheriff contends that subclass A cannot satisfy the commonality requirement \nbecause its members seek habeas corpus relief that would require individual \nproceedings or determinations.  But issues pertaining to the individualized nature of the \ndesired injunctive relief go to the requirements of Rule 23(b), not commonality.  See id. \n                                            \n6 The Court notes that the plaintiffs posed different questions in their motion for class \ncertification than in their reply brief in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction.  \nCompare Pls.' Mot. to Cert. Class (dkt. no. 6) at 7–8 with Pls.' Reply in Supp. of \nRenewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 64) at 21–22.  Which particular question the \nCourt identifies as conditionally satisfying the commonality requirement makes no \ndifference for the purpose of this opinion.  Regardless, at least one question the \nplaintiffs pose in their reply brief would also satisfy the commonality requirement:  \nwhether detainees in the Jail, as a matter of due process, are entitled to practice social \ndistancing consistent with people in the community at large. \n38 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 39 of 87 PageID #:1972\nat 360–62; Bell v. PNC Bank, Nat. Ass'n, 800 F.3d 360, 379–80 (7th Cir. 2015).  In other \nwords, the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a) does not demand that the relief \nultimately awarded to each plaintiff be the same.  See id.; Suchanek, 764 F.3d at 756 \n(commonality of relief is not essential); In re IKO Roofing Shingle Prod. Liab. Litig., 757 \nF.3d 599, 602 (7th Cir. 2014) (\"[The commonality requirement as discussed in] Wal–\nMart has nothing to do with commonality of damages.\").  Nor is this a case in which the \ncommonality requirement is not satisfied because individual plaintiffs experienced the \nharm in meaningfully different ways.  Cf. Jamie S. v. Milwaukee Pub. Sch., 668 F.3d \n481, 497–98 (7th Cir. 2012) (class of disabled students did not meet commonality \nrequirement where its members likely experienced alleged violations of federal and \nstate law in different ways).  The putative members of subclass A all experienced the \nalleged harm from the Sheriff's response to coronavirus in the same or similar ways, \nspecifically their allegedly increased risk of exposure to the virus.  In addition, all of \nthem raise the same kind of claim, and their claims all involve a common question that \nwould resolve a central issue of that claim.  \n  The Court acknowledges that, in a case raising claims similar to the habeas \ncorpus claims asserted in this one, another judge in this district recently took a different \napproach with regard to commonality.  A putative representative class of convicted \nprisoners in Money v. Pritzker, No. 20-CV-2093, 2020 WL 1820660(N.D. Ill. Apr. 10, \n2020), also sought habeas corpus relief and medical furloughs or home detentions \nunder section 1983 based on an allegedly inadequate response to the coronavirus \npandemic by the director of the Illinois Department of Corrections.  Id. at *1–2.  For the \nsection 1983 claim, the court found the only common question \"apt to drive the \n39 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 40 of 87 PageID #:1973\nresolution of the litigation,\" id. at *15 (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350), was \"which \nclass members should actually be given a furlough,\" id.  That question did not satisfy \nthe commonality requirement, the court found, because \"individualized determinations\" \nwould be necessary to answer it.  Id.  The court also indicated that the habeas claim \nwould not be \"suitable for representative or class treatment\" because \"release \ndeterminations must be made on an individual basis regardless of the vehicle for \nconsidering and effectuating them.\"  Id. at *21 n.15.    The court did not clarify whether it \nbased its finding that the habeas claim would be unsuitable for representative or class \ntreatment on the commonality requirement or another Rule 23 consideration.  See id. \n  This Court respects the court's decision in Money, which it cites as persuasive \nauthority elsewhere in this opinion.  But to the extent that the court in Money found that \nthe putative classes failed to satisfy the commonality requirement because their \nrequested relief would entail individualized determinations, this Court departs from the \nanalysis in Money.  As indicated, the commonality requirement does not mean that the \nrelief ultimately awarded to each plaintiff must be the same.  Thus whether the release \ndeterminations would need to be made on an individual basis does not factor into the \nRule 23(a) commonality analysis.   \n  The Court concludes, for the reasons stated above, that the putative class \nsatisfies Rule 23(a)'s commonality requirement.  \n    b.  Typicality \n  The Sheriff contends that the putative subclass does not meet Rule 23(a)'s \ntypicality requirement.  He does not explain why, and he is incorrect.  The named \nplaintiffs' habeas corpus \"claim is typical if it arises from the same event or practice or \n40 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 41 of 87 PageID #:1974\ncourse of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other [subclass] members and is \nbased on the same legal theory.\"  Lacy v. Cook County, 897 F.3d 847, 866 (7th Cir. \n2018) (alteration omitted).  \"This requirement is meant to ensure that the named \nrepresentative’s claims have the same essential characteristics as the claims of the \nclass at large.\"  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Typicality is satisfied for subclass \nA because the named plaintiffs have alleged the same injurious conduct stemming from \nthe Sheriff's response to the coronavirus pandemic as the other members of the \nsubclass and have advanced the same legal theory as the subclass at large. \n    c.  Rule 23(b)(2) \n  Rule 23(b)(2) is the sticking point for the habeas corpus plaintiffs' attempt to bring \na representative action on behalf of subclass A.  As indicated, Rule 23(b)(2) allows for \nclass certification where \"the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \ngrounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief . . . is appropriate \nrespecting the class as a whole.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  It \"applies only when a \nsingle injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the \nclass,\" not \"when each individual class member would be entitled to a different \ninjunction.\"  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360.   \n  The Sheriff contends that the putative subclass A does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) \nbecause the plaintiffs seek individualized relief.  He suggests that any habeas corpus \nproceeding would need to account for each subclass member's individual \ncircumstances, including, for example, the danger each detainee would pose to the \npublic if released.  The plaintiffs expressly concede that the relief would need to be at \nleast partly individualized.  They contend, however, that this could be achieved through \n41 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 42 of 87 PageID #:1975\n\"brief, individual proceedings\" without defeating class certification.

(dkt. no. 55) at 16.  \n  In actions where plaintiffs seek an injunction that \"would merely initiate a process \nthrough which highly individualized determinations of liability and remedy are made,\" \nRule 23(b)(2) is not satisfied.  Jamie S., 668 F.3d at 499 (7th Cir. 2012) (injunction that \nestablished a system for identifying disabled children and implementing individualized \neducation plans and remedies did not satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) because it \"merely \nestablishe[d] a system for eventually providing individualized relief\").  Compare id. and \nKartman v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 634 F.3d 883, 893 (7th Cir. 2011) (in case \nchallenging insurer's performance of hail storm damage appraisals, injunction requiring \nclass-wide roof reinspection did not satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) where it \"would only initiate \nthousands of individualized proceedings to determine breach and damages\") with Chi. \nTeachers Union, Local No. 1 v.

They suggest that the type of supposedly brief, \nindividualized proceedings they seek \"have long been commonplace in class litigation.\"  \nPls.' Reply in Supp. of Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 64) at 23.  But the cases \n42 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 43 of 87 PageID #:1976\nthey cite to support that proposition are distinguishable from this one.  Both Barnes v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 278 F.R.D. 14 (D.D.C. 2011), and Dunn v. City of Chicago, 231 \nF.R.D. 367 (N.D. Ill. 2005), amended on reconsideration, No. 04 C 6804, 2005 WL \n3299391 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 30, 2005), involved individualized proceedings on damages \nunder Rule 23(b)(3), not individualized proceedings for injunctive relief under Rule \n23(b)(2).  See Barnes, 278 F.R.D. at 19–23; Dunn, 231 F.R.D. 367, at 375–78.  Dunn \nalso involved class members who had variations in how they experienced the \nconstitutional violations—an issue the court properly discussed as part of the \ncommonality analysis, not the Rule 23(b)(2) analysis.  See id. at 372.   \n  Even if the plaintiffs did not concede it, individualized proceedings would be \nrequired for writs of habeas corpus that the plaintiffs seek because the Prisoner \nLitigation Reform Act (PLRA) applies to their habeas corpus claims.  Under the PLRA, \nin tailoring any prospective or preliminary injunctive relief \"in any civil action with respect \nto prison conditions,\" a court must \"give substantial weight to any adverse impact on \npublic safety,\" among other considerations.  18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A), (a)(2).  The \nPLRA defines \"civil action with respect to prison conditions\" as \"any civil proceeding \narising under Federal law with respect to the conditions of confinement or the effects of \nactions by government officials on the lives of persons confined in prison, but does not \ninclude habeas corpus proceedings challenging the fact or duration of confinement in \nprison.\"  Id. § 3626(g)(2).  Thus if the plaintiffs' habeas claims constitute civil actions as \ndefined by the PLRA, the Court would need to give substantial weight to the public \nsafety of granting writs, which would require consideration of, among other things, any \ndanger each individual member of subclass A poses to the public. \n43 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 44 of 87 PageID #:1977\n  As the Court indicated in its TRO decision, the question of whether detained \npersons can even use a section 2241 petition to challenge the conditions of their \nconfinement has divided courts.  Mays, 2020 WL 1812381, at *6 (comparing, e.g., \nAamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1032 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (a prisoner may challenge the \nconditions of his confinement in a federal habeas corpus petition) and Thompson v. \nChoinski, 525 F.3d 205, 209 (2d Cir. 2008) (same) with Spencer v. Haynes, 774 F.3d \n467, 469–70 (8th Cir. 2014) (section 2241 petitions may not challenge conditions)).  The \nSeventh Circuit has expressed a \"long-standing view that habeas corpus is not a \npermissible route for challenging prison conditions,\" at least when a prisoner's claim \ndoes not have \"even an indirect effect on the duration of punishment.\"  Robinson v. \nSherrod, 631 F.3d 839, 840–41 (7th Cir. 2011).  But the Seventh Circuit has also noted \nthat \"the Supreme Court [has] left the door open a crack for prisoners to use habeas \ncorpus to challenge a condition of confinement.\"  Id. at 840 (quoting Glaus v. Anderson, \n408 F.3d 382, 387 (7th Cir. 2005)) (citing Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 644–46 \n(2004); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 526 n.6 (1979); Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. \n475, 499–500 (1973)). \n  In the TRO decision, the Court said that it did not need to decide the question of \nwhether the plaintiffs could challenge conditions of confinement in a habeas corpus \nproceeding definitively at the time but stated that were it \"required to address this point, \n[the Court] would not consider it to be an absolute bar to plaintiffs' motion for a \ntemporary restraining order.\"  Mays, 2020 WL 1812381, at *6.  The Court stated that \n\"[t]he plaintiffs' claims, as they have framed them, do bear on the duration of their \nconfinement (they contend, ultimately, that they cannot be held in the Jail consistent \n44 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 45 of 87 PageID #:1978\nwith the Constitution's requirements), and they are not the sort of claims that are, or can \nbe, appropriately addressed via a claim for damages.\"  Id. \n  But the plaintiffs' claims also bear on the conditions of their confinement:  they \nchallenge the constitutionality of the conditions in the Jail during the coronavirus \npandemic, and they contend that the conditions are so deficient that it is unconstitutional \nfor subclass A to be confined at the Jail.  The Seventh Circuit has not expressly \naddressed whether the PLRA applies to habeas corpus petitions that involve conditions \nof confinement, but it has not foreclosed the application of the PLRA to such petitions.  \nCf. Walker v. O'Brien, 216 F.3d 626, 634 (7th Cir. 2000) (stating that actions \"brought \nunder section 2241 . . . as habeas corpus petitions are not subject to the PLRA\"—but \nnot addressing such petitions that challenge the conditions of confinement); see also \nThomas v. Zatecky, 712 F.3d 1004, 1005 (7th Cir. 2013) (Walker holds, among other \nthings, \"that a collateral attack under § 2241 or § 2254 is not a 'civil action' for the \npurpose\" of the PLRA (emphasis added)).  By specifying that a \"civil action with respect \nto prison conditions . . . does not include habeas corpus proceedings challenging the \nfact or duration of confinement in prison,\" the language of the PLRA appears suggests \nthat it may cover other types of habeas corpus proceedings, including, potentially, those \nchallenging the conditions of confinement.  See Advocate Health Care Network v. \nStapleton, 137 S. Ct. 1652, 1659 (2017) (courts should interpret a statute in a way that \nwould \"give effect, if possible, to every clause and word\").  And at least some courts \naddressing the issue have suggested that the PLRA applies to habeas corpus petitions \ninvolving the conditions of confinement.  See Jones v. Smith, 720 F.3d 142, 145, 145 \nn.3 (2d Cir. 2013) (the PLRA does not apply to \"habeas petition[s] seeking to overturn a \n45 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 46 of 87 PageID #:1979\ncriminal conviction or sentence\" but presumably would apply to conditions-of-\nconfinement habeas claims brought under section 2241); Blair-Bey v. Quick, 151 F.3d \n1036, 1042 (D.C. Cir.) (habeas corpus petitions challenging conditions of confinement \n\"would have to be subject to the PLRA's . . . rules, as they are precisely the sort of \nactions that the PLRA sought to address\"), on reh'g, 159 F.3d 591 (D.C. Cir. 1998). \n  Accordingly, the Court concludes that the PLRA applies to the plaintiffs' habeas \ncorpus claim.  The PLRA's mandate that a court \"give substantial weight to any adverse \nimpact on public safety\" before issuing preliminary injunctive or prospective relief thus \nwould apply to the habeas corpus claim.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A), (a)(2).  To do \nso, the Court would need to consider the circumstances of the detained persons and \nany threat they pose to public safety, which plainly would vary from one person to \nanother.  This is a process that would render the claim unsuitable to certification under \nRule 23(b)(2) or its analogy for representative actions.   \n  The plaintiffs also state, in two sentences found at the very end of a small-type, \ntwenty-four-line footnote, that a release order would not require a court to resolve \nindividualized questions regarding safety because such an order would give the Sheriff \ndiscretion on which detained persons to release.  Pls.' Reply in Supp. of Renewed Mot. \nfor Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 64) at 21 n.16.  The plaintiffs make this point with respect to \ncommonality for their section 1983 claim, not on the question of whether the habeas \ncorpus claim may be handled on a representative basis.  They nowhere attempt to \nexplain how the Court could condition the issuance of writs of habeas corpus on \ndetainee-specific decisions made by the Sheriff.  As this Court stated in its TRO \ndecision, \"[t]he issuance of [a] writ of habeas corpus through a section 2241 petition is a \n46 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 47 of 87 PageID #:1980\nfederal remedy (in other words, it does not depend on state law).\"  Mays, 2020 WL \n1812381, at *7.  Nor could the issuance of a writ depend on subsequent decisions by a \ndetained person's custodian.  The habeas corpus claim proceeds against the custodian \nbased on the fundamental, long-standing rule that a person in custody \"may be liberated \nif no sufficient reason is shown to the contrary.\"  Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. 426, 435 \n(2004) (quoting Wales v. Whitney, 114 U.S. 564, 574 (1885)).  The only remedy \navailable for a habeas corpus claim is liberation of the person in custody.  See id.  It is \ndifficult to imagine a writ of habeas corpus that would tell a jailer to release the \npetitioner—unless he decides it would not be a good idea to do so.  Plaintiffs offer no \nauthority supporting the proposition that a writ of habeas corpus could appropriately be \nissued in this way. \n  In sum, though representative habeas corpus actions do not need to comply \n\"precisely\" with Rule 23, Morgan, 546 F.2d at 221 n.5, the plaintiffs cannot meet the \nrequirements for representative treatment.7  \n  Because the plaintiffs' habeas corpus claims founder on the exhaustion \nrequirement, and because they have not established that the claims may be pursued on \na representative basis, their representative action on behalf of subclass A has no \nlikelihood of success on the merits.  Accordingly, the plaintiffs' request for the Court to \n                                            \n7 The Court acknowledges that this is different from the conclusion it reached in the \nTRO decision, in which it conditionally certified subclass A.  See Mays, 2020 WL \n1812381, at *4.  But that was, of course, a provisional decision.  And even for a non-\nconditionally certified class, a court may alter or amend an order granting class \ncertification at any point before final judgment.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(C); Gen. Tel. \nCo. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160 (1982) (class certification order is \"inherently \ntentative,\" and a district court “remains free to modify it in the light of subsequent \ndevelopments in the litigation\").   \n47 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 48 of 87 PageID #:1981\nrelease medically vulnerable members of subclass A on unsecured or non-monetary \nbail conditions pending review of their habeas corpus claims is moot. \nB.  Section 1983 claim  \n  The Court next addresses the question of likelihood of success on the plaintiffs' \nsection 1983 claim, dealing with conditional class certification first, followed by the \nmerits.  The Court then addresses certain provisions of the PLRA as applied to the \nsection 1983 claim. \n  1.  Conditional class certification \n  For their section 1983 claim, the plaintiffs seek class-wide relief in the form of a \npreliminary injunction.  But because the plaintiffs only recently filed the lawsuit, there \nhas not yet been a class certification ruling.  As the Court indicated in its TRO opinion, \n\"[t]his does not foreclose the possibility of relief for the plaintiffs at this stage, because a \ndistrict court has general equity powers allowing it to grant temporary or preliminary \ninjunctive relief to a conditional class.\"  Mays, 2020 WL 1812381, at *3 (citing Lee v. \nOrr, No. 13 C 8719, 2013 WL 6490577, at *2 (N.D.

(quoting \nMeyer v. Portfolio Recovery Assocs., LLC, 707 F.3d 1036, 1043 (9th Cir. 2012)). \n  As indicated, to bring a class action a plaintiff must show that the proposed class \nmeets the four requirements of Rule 23(a):  \"numerosity, commonality, typicality, and \n48 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 49 of 87 PageID #:1982\nadequate representation.\"  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 349.  In addition, \"the proposed class \nmust satisfy at least one of the three requirements listed in Rule 23(b).\"  Wal-Mart, 564 \nU.S. at 345.  The plaintiffs rely on Rule 23(b)(2). \n   As an initial matter, the Court must clarify the scope of the class or subclasses \nfor which the plaintiffs have sought certification.  They assert count 1 under section \n1983 on behalf of all putative members of a class consisting of \"all people who are \ncurrently or who will in the future be housed in the Cook County Jail for the duration of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\"  Compl. (dkt. no. 1) ¶ 60.  In their reply brief in support of \ntheir motion for a preliminary injunction, however, the plaintiffs indicate that they also \nrequest injunctive relief for claims under section 1983 specifically for the putative \nmembers of proposed subclass B, which consists of \"all people who are currently \nhoused on a tier where someone has already tested positive for the coronavirus,\" id. ¶ \n62.  See, e.g., Pls.' Reply in Supp. of Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 64) at 29 \n(requesting the transfer of members of putative subclass B).  Accordingly, the Court \ntakes this as meaning that, with respect the section 1983 claim, the plaintiffs seek \ninjunctive relief on behalf of both the overall class and subclass B. \n  The parties dispute whether the class and subclass B satisfy each requirement of \nRule 23, except for numerosity.  The Court's analysis earlier in this opinion finding that \nsubclass A (the subclass seeking habeas relief) satisfies the typicality and commonality \nrequirements apply to the overall class and subclass B as well.  Specifically, the class \nand subclass B satisfy the commonality requirement because their members \"have \nsuffered the same injury\" and their claims \"depend upon a common contention\" for \nwhich class action proceedings will \"generate common answers apt to drive the \n49 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 50 of 87 PageID #:1983\nresolution of the litigation.\"  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350 (emphasis omitted).  As with \nsubclass A, the claims members of the class and subclass B raise at least one common \nquestion that satisfies Rule 23(a)'s commonality requirement:  whether coronavirus \npresents so severe a risk of harm to those in the Sheriff's custody that their conditions of \nconfinement are unconstitutional.  For the reasons previously discussed, Rule 23(a)'s \ncommonality requirement does not involve whether each member of the class would be \nentitled to identical relief. \n  The Class and subclass B also satisfy Rule 23(a)'s typicality requirement.  Each \nmember's section 1983 claim arises from the Sheriff's response to the coronavirus \npandemic—\"the same event or practice or course of conduct\"—and \"is based on the \nsame legal theory.\"  See Lacy, 897 F.3d at 866 (alteration omitted).   \n  The Court's analysis under Rule 23(b)(2), however, differs from its analysis \nregarding the habeas corpus claim.  Again, Rule 23(b)(2) allows for class certification \nwhere \"the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply \ngenerally to the class, so that final injunctive relief . . . is appropriate respecting the \nclass as a whole.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  It \"applies only when a single injunction or \ndeclaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class,\" not \"when each \nindividual class member would be entitled to a different injunction.\"  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. \nat 360.  \n  A good deal of the injunctive relief that the plaintiffs seek would provide relief to \nthe entire class via a single order.  Specifically, on behalf of the overall class, the \nplaintiffs request a single order mandating social distancing and/or extending the TRO \nor converting it to a preliminary injunction, which would provide the same relief to each \n50 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 51 of 87 PageID #:1984\nclass member.  Accordingly, the class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(b) to the \nextent the plaintiffs request relief under section 1983 mandating social distancing and/or \nextending the TRO or converting it into a preliminary injunction. \n  The plaintiffs' requests for prisoner transfers and/or releases on behalf of \nsubclass B, however, likely would entail individual determinations to some degree.  The \nparties do not dispute that the PLRA applies to the plaintiffs' section 1983 claim or that \nthe 1983 claim involves prison conditions.  As discussed earlier with regard to the \nhabeas corpus claim, before granting prospective or preliminary injunctive relief on the \nsection 1983 claim, the PLRA requires the Court to \"give substantial weight to any \nadverse impact on public safety,\" in addition to making other findings.  18 U.S.C. § \n3626(a)(1)(A), (a)(2).  As indicated, the Sheriff contends that these individual \ndeterminations prevent certification under 23(b)(2).  As the Court has discussed, the \nplaintiffs contend (albeit only in a footnote) that a court would not be required to make \nthose individual determinations because a court could grant a single injunction while \ndelegating those questions to the Sheriff.  Pls.' Reply in Supp. of Renewed Mot. for \nPrelim. Inj.  (dkt. no. 64) at 21 n.16; see also Brown, 563 U.S. at 537–38 (three-judge \ncourt adequately considered \"public safety by leaving\" decision \"of how best to comply \nwith its population limit to state prison officials\").  The Court recognizes that analysis of \nwhether the Sheriff may exercise discretion in carrying out a transfer or release order \nmay be different for the section 1983 claim.  Among other differences, a petition for \nhabeas corpus contemplates a singular form of relief with regard to habeas—release \nfrom custody—whereas a court has a broader spectrum of possible relief under section \n1983.  See Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. at 435; Preiser, 411 U.S. at 484–86, 489.  The range of \n51 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 52 of 87 PageID #:1985\ninjunctive relief available under section 1983 may allow courts to \"leave details of \nimplementation to [a] State's discretion by leaving sensitive policy decisions to \nresponsible and competent policy state officials.\"  See, e.g., Brown, 563 U.S. at 538.  \nThe Court need not decide that issue now, however, because, as it will explain later in \nthis opinion, at this point it concludes that the predicate under the PLRA for convening a \nthree-judge court or ordering prisoner transfers has not been established.  \n  In sum, the Court conditionally certifies the class to the extent the plaintiffs \nrequest relief under section 1983 requiring social distancing and/or extending the TRO \nor converting it to a preliminary injunction.  The Court declines to decide whether \nsubclass B satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(b) because it is not necessary to do so \nat this time. \n  2.  Likelihood of success on the merits \n  The injunctive relief requests remaining for determination are the class's requests \nto require social distancing throughout the Jail and (it appears) advance identification \nand further screening of detained persons with conditions that make them more \nvulnerable to severe health consequences from coronavirus disease, as well as their \nrequest to convert the TRO to a preliminary injunction.  (The Court addresses in later \nsections the plaintiffs' request to require the Sheriff to transfer detainees out of the Jail \nand to convene a three-judge panel.)   \n  The claims of the class arise under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment.  \"When a state actor [ ] deprives a person of his ability to care for himself \nby . . . detaining him . . . , it assumes an obligation to provide some minimum level of \nwell-being and safety.\"  Johnson v. Rimmer, 936 F.3d 695, 706 (7th Cir. 2019) (quoting \n52 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 53 of 87 PageID #:1986\nCollignon v. Milwaukee County, 163 F.3d 982, 987 (7th Cir. 1998)).  The Due Process \nClause requires a jailer to provide a pretrial detainee with food, shelter, and basic \nnecessities, including reasonably adequate sanitation, ventilation, bedding, hygienic \nmaterials, and utilities, Hardeman v. Curran, 933 F.3d 816, 820 (7th Cir. 2019), and to \n\"meet[ ] the person's medical needs while he is in custody,\" Johnson, 936 F.3d at 706.  \nMore broadly, the Due Process Clause protects pretrial detainees, who \"have not been \nconvicted of anything,\" Miranda v. County of Lake, 900 F.3d 335, 350 (7th Cir. 2018), \nfrom conditions that \"amount[ ] to punishment.\"  Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. \n2466, 247 (2015) (quoting Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 395 n.10 (1989)); \nHardeman, 933 F.3d at 823.   \n  Here there is no question that the plaintiffs' claims involve conditions that are \nsufficiently serious to invoke the Fourteenth Amendment; the Sheriff does not argue \notherwise.  A pretrial detainee may establish a Fourteenth Amendment violation based \non a condition, or combination of conditions, posing an \"unreasonable risk of serious \ndamage to [his] future health.\"  Henderson v. Sheahan, 196 F.3d 839, 847 (7th Cir. \n1999) (decided under Eighth Amendment \"deliberate indifference\" standard).  See \nHelling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33, 35 (1993) (Eighth Amendment case; \"exposure of \ninmates to a serious, communicable disease\" that poses a risk of future harm is a \ndeprivation sufficiently serious to invoke constitutional protections).  This is precisely \nwhere persons detained in the Jail find themselves.  The coronavirus is indisputably \npresent in the Jail.  And the persons detained there are housed in settings that facilitate \nits transmission.  This is true throughout the Jail, given the close proximity in which even \nsingle-celled detained persons are housed and the fact that they occupy common areas \n53 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 54 of 87 PageID #:1987\nlike bathrooms, showers, and dayrooms where other inmates congregate or have been \npresent.  And it is particularly true for detained persons who are doubled celled and \nthose who are still housed in the dormitory units, where dozens (or more) spend twenty-\nfour hours per day, or close to it, in the same room.  It is equally undisputed that \npersons are detained in these settings with the knowledge of the Sheriff and his \npersonnel, who have assigned them to live in these quarters while aware of the risks of \nvirus transmission.  All of this, taken together, is sufficient for the plaintiffs to have well \nmore than a \"better than negligible chance,\" see Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1046, of \nestablishing the threshold requirement of their due process claim—conduct that the \nSheriff knows puts detainees at a significant risk of serious harm from coronavirus.  See \nKingsley, 135 S. Ct. at 2472; Miranda, 900 F.3d at 353.  Meeting this threshold \nrequirement of the due process standard does not require an intent to cause harm; it \nrequires only knowledge of \"the physical consequences\" of one's conduct.  Kingsley, \n135 S. Ct. at 2472. \n  The primary dispute before the Court, and the point on which the Sheriff focuses \nhis defense, involves the second requirement of a due process claim.  To succeed on \ntheir claim, the plaintiffs must show that the Sheriff's conduct in addressing the risks \nposed by exposure to coronavirus is objectively unreasonable in one or more respects.  \nSee, e.g., McCann v. Ogle County, 909 F.3d 881, 886 (7th Cir. 2018).  At the \npreliminary injunction stage, however, the plaintiffs are not required to prove this \ndefinitively; they are required only to establish a reasonable likelihood that they will \nultimately succeed in proving it. \n  The plaintiffs concede that the Sheriff and others have taken significant steps to \n54 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 55 of 87 PageID #:1988\nreduce the Jail's population and to decrease the number of persons housed in groups or \ndouble celled.  They argue, however, that the Sheriff's actions do not go far enough and \nthat detained persons continue to be unreasonably exposed to a risk of serious harm.  \nThe plaintiffs contend that social distancing is not being enforced even in units where \ndetained persons are single celled, given joint usage of showers, toilet facilities, and \ndayrooms.  And, they say, social distancing is not even a possibility for the hundreds \nwho are double celled or remain in dormitory units.  The plaintiffs also contend that \ndespite policies promulgated by the Sheriff, proper sanitation—in particular, frequent \ncleaning of surfaces and facilities used in common, distribution of cleaning materials to \ndetainees, and so on—is not actually being carried out on the ground.  Finally, the \nplaintiffs contend—and it is undisputed—that nothing has been done by the Sheriff to \nenable him to identify, in advance, detained persons with medical or other conditions \nthat make them particularly vulnerable to serious illness should they contract the \ncoronavirus. \n  The Sheriff argues that he and others have taken significant steps to reduce the \nrisk to detained persons from coronavirus.  One critical aspect of this is a very \nsignificant reduction in the overall population of the Jail, accomplished by bond \nreductions issued by judges and by expansion, to its limits, of the Sheriff's electronic \nhome monitoring program.  In addition, in recent weeks, there have been far fewer new \ndetainees admitted on a daily basis than has been the case historically, presumably due \nto fewer arrests.  At the same time, the Sheriff has taken steps to increase capacity, \nincluding by reopening previously shuttered buildings and parts of buildings within the \nJail complex.  Together, these actions have enabled the Sheriff to take further steps to \n55 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 56 of 87 PageID #:1989\nseparate persons who remain detained in the Jail.  Specifically, a far greater percentage \nof detainees are now in cells by themselves.  And far fewer are housed in the dormitory \nunits than before, with many having been transferred to single-cell units.  In addition, at \nthe Sheriff's direction, detainees have been provided guidance regarding social \ndistancing.  The Sheriff has also instituted policies to enhance sanitation practices and \nto carry out these policies.  He has also implemented the distribution of facemasks to \ncertain detained persons—in particular, those who are in quarantine—consistent with \nthe availability of supplies, and he has undertaken efforts to acquire more.  (Some of \nthis has taken place as a result of the TRO entered on April 9.) \n  It cannot reasonably be disputed that the Sheriff has undertaken a significant, \nand impressive, effort to safeguard detained persons in his custody from infection by \ncoronavirus.  And based on the record, including the testimony of Executive Director \nMiller at the April 23 hearing, the Court is satisfied that the Sheriff and his staff have \nacted in good faith, with the goal of protecting the people placed in his custody, \nconsistent with his obligation to maintain security. \n  Were this an Eighth Amendment case involving convicted prisoners, the efforts \nthe Court has just described likely would be the end of the story.  To prevail in a case \ninvolving a convicted prisoner, a plaintiff is required to show that the prison official was \ndeliberately indifferent to the risk of harm to the plaintiff—in other words, the official \nknew about but disregarded that risk.  See, e.g., Orr v. Shicker, 953 F.3d 490, 499 (7th \nCir. 2020); Garcia v. Armor Corr. Health Serv., Inc., 788 F. App'x 393, 395 (7th Cir. \n2019).  Were the plaintiffs in this case required to make that showing, they would be \nunable to prevail; the Sheriff has been anything but deliberately indifferent to the risk of \n56 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 57 of 87 PageID #:1990\nharm to pretrial detainees from coronavirus.   \n  But because this is a case involving persons detained prior to an adjudication of \ntheir guilt or innocence, the Sheriff's good intentions are not dispositive of the plaintiffs' \nclaims.  There is a critical difference between a claim regarding conditions of \nconfinement brought by pretrial detainees like the plaintiffs and one brought by a \nconvicted prisoner under the Eighth Amendment, who unlike a pretrial detainee can \nconstitutionally be subjected to punishment.  See Hardeman, 933 F.3d at 824 (Eighth \nAmendment standard is \"more demanding\").  The standard by which a court evaluates \na claim by a pretrial detainee like the plaintiffs \"is solely an objective one.\"  Kingsley, \n135 S. Ct. at 2473.  The plaintiffs are not required to show that the Sheriff had an intent \nto punish or to harm them, id.; indeed, they need not show any sort of malicious or bad \nintent at all.  Rather, what they are required to show—actually, on a preliminary \ninjunction, simply establish a reasonable likelihood of showing—is that the Sheriff's \nconduct with respect to the particular condition has been objectively unreasonable in \none or more respects.  See McCann, 909 F.3d at 886.  In applying this standard, a court \n\"focus[es] on the totality of facts and circumstances\" the defendant faced \"to gauge \nobjectively—without regard to any subjective belief held by the [defendant]—whether \nthe response [to the conditions] was reasonable.\"  Id.   \n  The plaintiffs contend that the Sheriff's response to the coronavirus outbreak at \nthe Jail has not been objectively reasonable or sufficiently protective of the people in his \ncustody, at least with respect to the issues currently before the Court—social distancing, \nsanitation, and identification and monitoring of highly vulnerable detainees.  In \nevaluating the plaintiffs' contentions, the Court assesses objective reasonableness \n57 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 58 of 87 PageID #:1991\n\"from the perspective of 'a reasonable [official] on the scene,' based on what the \n[official] knew at the time.\"  Mays, 2020 WL 1812381, at *9 (quoting Kingsley, 135 S. Ct. \nat 2473).  The question, in the present context, is whether the Sheriff \"acted reasonably \nto mitigate the risks to [the] health and safety of detainees.\"  Id. (citing Hardeman, 933 \nF.3d at 825; Darnell v. Pineiro, 849 F.3d 17, 35 (2d Cir. 2017)).  And in determining the \nreasonableness of the Sheriff's actions, the Court \"must account for his legitimate \ninterest in managing the Jail facilities,\" and it must \"defer to policies and practices that \n'are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional \nsecurity.'\"  Id. (quoting Kingsley, 135 S. Ct. at 2473); see Bell, 441 U.S. at 547. \n  The fact of the matter is that the Sheriff's actions have not eliminated the risk to \ndetained persons; far from it.  But this, too, is not dispositive.  Although a jailer must \nmake a reasonable effort to abate conditions that pose an excessive risk to the health or \nsafety of the people in his custody, the fact that he fails to prevent actual harm does not \nmean that his response was unreasonable.  See Dale v. Poston, 548 F.3d 563, 569 (7th \nCir. 2008) (applying Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference standard).  More \nspecifically, the Constitution does not require a detention facility to provide \"foolproof \nprotection from infection\" by a communicable disease.  Forbes v. Edgar, 112 F.3d 262, \n266 (7th Cir. 1997) (applying Eighth Amendment standard); see also Smith v. \nSangamon Cty. Sheriff's Dep't, 715 F.3d 188, 191 (7th Cir. 2013) (applying Eighth \nAmendment standard; \"Prison and jail officials are not required to guarantee [a] \ndetainee's safety.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  That said, the ongoing risk to \ndetained persons at the Jail, confirmed by increases in the number who have tested \npositive for coronavirus and the death of six detained persons from coronavirus disease \n58 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 59 of 87 PageID #:1992\nas of April 23, is the backdrop against which the Court must view the Sheriff's conduct.   \n  The Court begins with the question of social distancing.  As the plaintiffs see it, a \npolicy that fails to fully implement social distancing throughout the Jail—which \nindisputably has not happened—cannot possibly be considered an objectively \nreasonable response to the coronavirus outbreak there.  At least until full social \ndistancing is enforced, the plaintiffs contend, detained persons face an unacceptably \nhigh risk of death or serious harm to their health. \n  The Sheriff's position is likewise simple and straightforward.  His implementation \nof a coronavirus response plan at the Jail complies, he says, with the CDC Guidelines, \nand for this reason his actions have been objectively reasonable.  The Guidelines, he \npoints out, do not require social distancing in correctional facilities where it is not \nfeasible given physical space, population, and staffing.8  The plaintiffs respond that the \nCDC Guidelines are not a surrogate for constitutional due process requirements.   \n  To support his position that compliance with the CDC Guidelines should \neffectively be dispositive, the Sheriff cites Carroll v. DeTella, 255 F.3d 470 (7th Cir. \n2001).  There the Seventh Circuit held that a convicted prisoner could not show that \nprison officials had been deliberately indifferent to his lack of access to safe drinking \nwater, because radium concentrations in the prison's drinking water were at a level that \nthe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency deemed at the time to be safe.  Id. at 472–\n73.  The court noted that because prisoners are not entitled to better quality of air, \n                                            \n8 Largely based on this aspect of the CDC Guidelines, the Court, in deciding the TRO \nmotion, declined to require the Sheriff to enforce social distancing other than during the \nintake process, one very obvious point at which social distancing was not taking place.  \nThe TRO ruling, however, is neither final nor binding.  The Court has reassessed the \nmatter with the benefit of more thorough briefing and a more complete record. \n59 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 60 of 87 PageID #:1993\nwater, or environment than the general public, prisons do not have \"a duty to take \nremedial measures against pollution or other contamination that the agencies \nresponsible for the control of these hazards do not think require remedial measures.\"  \nId.  \n  The Sheriff's reliance on Carroll is unavailing.  First of all, the plaintiffs do not \nsuggest any entitlement on the part of pretrial detainees to conditions that exceed \nhealth and safety standards applicable to the general public.  But that aside, the CDC \nGuidelines, unlike the EPA standards relied upon in Carroll, do not say or suggest that \ncompliance makes detained people safe.  This is particularly so in view of the fact that \nthe Guidelines include feasibility qualifiers, particularly in relation to social distancing.  \nSee CDC Guidelines at 1, 3, 4, 11.  Given this limitation, the Guidelines are not the \nsame as a safety standard set by a regulatory agency.  \n  For their part, the plaintiffs suggest that the CDC Guidelines \"shed no light\" on \nwhether the Sheriff's conduct has been objectively reasonable, in conformity with \nconstitutional requirements.  Pls.' Reply in Supp. of Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. \nno. 64) at 10 (quoting Thompson v. City of Chicago, 472 F.3d 444, 454 (7th Cir. 1996)). \nThe Court disagrees with this as well.  The plaintiffs rely to a significant extent on \nThompson.  There the court, considering a claim of excessive force against a police \nofficer—a claim also determined by a standard of objective reasonableness—stated that \na policy on the use of force established by the police department was \"completely \nimmaterial [on] the question of whether a violation of the federal constitution has been \nestablished.\"  Id. at 454.  But later, in United States v. Brown, 871 F.3d 532 (7th Cir. \n2017), the Seventh Circuit clarified that Thompson simply means that a police \n60 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 61 of 87 PageID #:1994\ndepartment's own policies do not establish the standard of what is reasonable for \npurposes of the Constitution.  See id. at 537 (\"Despite its strong language, Thompson \nshould not be understood as establishing a rule that evidence of police policy or \nprocedure will never be relevant to the objective-reasonableness inquiry.\").  The court \nexplained in Brown that, in the fact-intensive objective reasonableness analysis, \nevidence of national or widely used police policies could be relevant to helping a \nfactfinder understand how a reasonable officer might have behaved under the \ncircumstances that faced the defendant.  Id. at 538.  The court noted that the relevance \nof such policy evidence may turn on the \"factual complexity\" of the circumstances facing \nthe defendant, and it may be less relevant in circumstances in which a factfinder can \nrely on common sense to determine the reasonableness of conduct.  See id. \n  Here—unlike, perhaps, a relatively simple excessive force claim against an \narresting officer—the circumstances facing the Sheriff in operating the Jail are quite \ncomplex.  In these circumstances, guidance from an expert body like the CDC is \nbeneficial in assessing the objective reasonableness of the Sheriff's conduct in the face \nof an ongoing outbreak.  Indeed, in Forbes, the Seventh Circuit concluded that a \nprison's response to a case of active tuberculosis in its facility had been objectively \nreasonable in part because it had implemented and effected the recommendations of \nthe CDC.  Forbes, 112 F.3d at 267. \n  In sum, the CDC Guidelines are an important piece of evidence to consider in \nassessing the Sheriff's conduct, but they cannot be appropriately viewed as dispositive \nstanding alone.  Indeed, the CDC's recommendations on tuberculosis were not \ndispositive in Forbes; the court also considered other facts—noting, for example, that \n61 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 62 of 87 PageID #:1995\nthe prison had only one case of active tuberculosis, \"a far cry\" from an outbreak.  Id.  As \nthe Court has indicated, one reason why the CDC Guidelines are not appropriately \nviewed as dispositive of the plaintiffs' due process claims is the way in which they \naccount for feasibility.  Although feasibility may be a consideration in determining \nobjective reasonableness, see Gayton v. McCoy, 593 F.3d 610, 622 (7th Cir. 2010) \n(decided under deliberate indifference standard), no case of which the Court is aware \nsets it as a dispositive factor.  That, however, is exactly what the CDC Guidelines do, at \nleast if read as the Sheriff suggests: they set a feasibility or practicality limitation on \nsocial distancing practices that they also call \"a cornerstone of reducing transmission of \nrespiratory diseases such as COVID-19.\"  CDC Guidelines at 4.  One can certainly \nunderstand why the CDC, a public health body, has acknowledged these sorts of limits \nupon its ability to prescribe guidelines for managing jails.  But from a constitutional-law \nstandpoint, it is difficult to believe that \"do what you can, but if you can't, so be it\"9 \nsatisfies a jailer's constitutional obligation to take objectively reasonable steps to \nmitigate known risks to the life and health of people in his custody who are detained \nawaiting determination of their guilt or innocence. \n  Currently the Sheriff is housing hundreds of detained persons under conditions \nthat make social distancing completely impossible or nearly so, or at least very difficult.  \nThose for whom it is completely impossible are the detainees who are double celled.  \nThose for whom it is at least very difficult and likely impossible are detainees who are \nhoused in dormitory units that are not operating at a greatly reduced capacity.  \n                                            \n9 The Court does not intend by this to suggest that this is the attitude of the Sheriff, the \nExecutive Director, or their staff.  Here the Court is characterizing a legal argument, not \nany person's behavior.   \n62 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 63 of 87 PageID #:1996\nSpecifically, a significant number of the existing dormitory units are operating at or \ngreater than fifty percent capacity.  Based on the record before the Court, social \ndistancing is practically impossible in such units, and this cannot be completely \nattributed to detainee conduct or misconduct:  if people are kept in groups in relatively \nclose quarters, it is entirely predictable that they will have difficulty maintaining \nseparation.   \n  At the current stage of the pandemic, group housing and double celling subject \ndetainees to a heightened, and potentially unreasonable and therefore constitutionally \nunacceptable, risk of contracting and transmitting the coronavirus.  Such arrangements \nmake it impossible or unduly difficult to maintain social distancing, a \"cornerstone\" of the \nreduction of coronavirus transmission among detainees.  The Court, however, must \naccount for and give deference to the Sheriff's interest in managing the Jail facilities and \nto practices that are needed to preserve order and discipline and maintain security.  See \nKingsley, 135 S. Ct. at 2473; Bell, 441 U.S. at 547.  These include documented \nconsiderations that make group or double celling appropriate or necessary.  Feasibility \nlimitations imposed by existing or otherwise available physical facilities are also taken \ninto account, though this is not and cannot be a controlling factor.  In this regard, it is \nworth noting that despite general statements by both sides to the contrary, it does not \nappear, based on the evidence, that the Sheriff has yet hit the feasibility limit on getting \ndetainees out of group housing, even if one considers only the Jail complex itself.  See \nApr. 23, 2020 Hearing Tr. at 57:2–19 (testimony by Executive Director Miller referencing \nthe possibility of further moves of detained persons out of dormitories). \n  Based on the evidence submitted, the Court finds that the plaintiffs are \n63 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 64 of 87 PageID #:1997\nreasonably likely to succeed on their contention that group housing or double celling of \ndetained persons is objectively unreasonable given the immediate and significant risk to \ntheir life and health from transmission of coronavirus, except in the following situations: \n•  Persons detained in tiers or dormitories currently under quarantine following a \npositive test for the coronavirus within the tier or dormitory, as this makes it \ninadvisable to transfer them to other housing arrangements until the quarantine \nperiod has expired (what the Sheriff refers to as \"quarantine tiers\"). \n•  Detained persons who have tested positive for the coronavirus and are under \nmedical observation (what the Sheriff refers to as \"isolation tiers\"), a housing \narrangement that the CDC Guidelines specifically authorize. \n•  Detained persons who have tested positive for coronavirus and are recovering \n(what the Sheriff refers to as \"convalescent tiers\"), which the CDC Guidelines \nlikewise authorize. \n•  Double-celled or dormitory-housed detainees for whom there is a documented \ndetermination by a medical or mental health professional that single-celling \nposes a risk of suicide or self-harm. \n•  Persons detained housed in a dormitory unit that is at less than fifty percent \ncapacity, which the record reflects will permit adequate social distancing. \n•  Detained persons committed, at the documented direction of a medical or mental \nhealth professional, to a group housing unit that is equipped for medical or \nmental health treatment, if but only if there is not available space in an \nappropriate housing or medical unit that permits full social distancing.   \nDetained persons housed in any of the listed \"acceptable\" arrangements will, however, \n64 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 65 of 87 PageID #:1998\nneed facemasks that are replaced at appropriate intervals and must be provided with \ninstruction on how to use a facemask and the reasons for its use.  They also must be \ninstructed, at regular intervals, on the importance of social distancing. \n  The Court has omitted from the list above two categories of detained persons \nreferenced in Executive Director Miller's affidavits and testimony:  persons put into \ngroup housing or double celled because of conduct issues (including those who Miller \nreferred to during his testimony as \"our disorderly . . . population,\" Apr. 23, 2020 Tr. at \n52:6) or for reasons associated with the PREA.  On the record as it currently stands, the \nplaintiffs have a reasonable likelihood of succeeding on a contention that it is objectively \nunreasonable to effectively preclude social distancing for such persons.  With regard to \nPREA detainees, the proposition that they cannot be single celled is counterintuitive, to \nsay the least.10  And with regard to individuals with conduct issues, without more the \nCourt cannot say that there is an objectively reasonable basis to hold them in a setting \nthat does not permit adequate social distancing.  With regard to detained persons in \nthese categories, the Court is willing to entertain a properly-supported request by the \nSheriff to include them in the category of persons who may be appropriately detained in \ngroup housing, perhaps with appropriate distancing. \n  Beyond what the Court has described, the plaintiffs have not established a \nreasonable likelihood of success on their due process claims.  Specifically, the Court is \nnot prepared to say that it is constitutionally inappropriate, in light of the coronavirus \npandemic, to detain persons in the Jail in any form of group housing or to detain them in \n                                            \n10 This is so whether these persons are alleged perpetrators or likely victims, which is \nnot clear from the record. \n65 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 66 of 87 PageID #:1999\nsingle cells given the likelihood of multiple uses of common facilities and areas.  This \nwould be tantamount to saying that, in the present circumstances, the Constitution \nprohibits detaining people in jails.  The plaintiffs have not established, and are not likely \nto be able to establish, that this is so. \n  Next, the Court addresses the plaintiffs' contentions regarding advance \nidentification of detained persons who are especially vulnerable to severe illness or \ndeath if they contract the coronavirus.  The Court remains unpersuaded that the \nplaintiffs have a reasonable likelihood of showing that this is objectively unreasonable \nand thus violative of those class members' constitutional rights.  The plaintiffs' experts \nopined that screening is important so that vulnerable individuals can be monitored for \nsymptoms.  Miller explained, however, that any person with symptoms consistent with \ncoronavirus disease is already provided immediate screening and treatment, and \nmedical professionals treating such a person will have immediate access to his or her \nmedical records (which include an inventory of medical conditions reported by the \ndetained person upon intake or thereafter).  Though, as the Court stated in its TRO \ndecision, advance identification of persons with heightened vulnerability would appear \nto be a good practice and perhaps a best practice, the plaintiffs have not shown that \nfailing to do so is, under the circumstances, objectively unreasonable. \n  Finally, the Court addresses the plaintiffs' request for extension of the TRO.  The \nTRO required the Sheriff to establish and implement a policy regarding coronavirus \ntesting; provide cleaning supplies to detainees and staff and soap and/or hand sanitizer \nto detained persons; establish and implement a policy regarding sanitization of \nfrequently touched surfaces; and provide facemasks to all detained persons who are \n66 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 67 of 87 PageID #:2000\nquarantined.  Mays, 2020 WL 1812381, at *14–15.  The plaintiffs ask the Court to \nconvert these requirements into a preliminary injunction.  The Sheriff argues that the \nCourt need not extend or convert the TRO because he has complied with it and \ncontinues to do so. \n  A court \"retains the power to grant injunctive relief\" even after the defendant \nceases the allegedly unlawful conduct.  Milwaukee Police Ass'n v. Jones, 192 F.3d 742, \n748 (7th Cir. 1999); see also United Air Lines, Inc. v. Air Line Pilots Ass'n, Int'l, 563 F.3d \n257, 275 (7th Cir. 2009).  The moving party must show that such relief still is required.  \nMilwaukee Police Ass'n, 192 F.3d at 748.  \"The necessary determination is that there \nexists some cognizable danger of recurrent violation, something more than the mere \npossibility which serves to keep the case alive.\"  Id. (quoting United States v. W. T. \nGrant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633 (1953)); see also United Air Lines, Inc., 563 F.3d at 275 \n(\"The court may consider how easily former practices might be resumed at any time in \ndetermining the appropriateness of injunctive relief.\").  Where the cessation of an \nallegedly wrongful activity occurred \"only after a lawsuit has been filed,\" a district court \nis \"within its discretion\" to find that the cessation was \"not voluntary, and that even a \nvoluntary cessation is not determinative.\"  Id.  \n  Although the Sheriff appears to have complied with the TRO, the Court cannot \nsay that the constitutional violations the Court sought to address will not recur absent an \nextension of the TRO's requirements.  The Sheriff's actions to develop policies on \nsanitation and coronavirus testing, distribute soap and cleaning supplies, and distribute \nfacemasks to detained persons who are quarantined—at least those done after the April \n9 TRO—cannot be said to have been undertaken entirely voluntarily.  Rather, they were \n67 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 68 of 87 PageID #:2001\ndone in response to the TRO, and there is at least some evidence of problems in \ncarrying out the TRO's directives.  In addition, without a court order, there is at least a \npossibility that these important measures could slip to the wayside, despite the Sheriff's \nbest intentions, as he works to manage the complexities of the Jail during this public \nhealth crisis.  For these reasons, the Court concludes that it is appropriate to convert \nthe TRO to a preliminary injunction.   \n  3.  Transfer \n  The plaintiffs next request the transfer of members of subclass B out of the Jail \n\"to another safe location in the Sheriff's custody.\"  Pls.' Reply in Supp. of Renewed Mot. \nfor Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 64) at 2.  Until recently, they primarily suggested that such a \nlocation could include \"home confinement or electronic home monitoring.\"  Pls.' Resp. to \nApril 3, 2020 Ord. (dkt. no. 26-1) at 17; see also Pls.' Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. \nno. 55) at 16–17 (requesting transfer without specifying the location to which detained \npeople should be transferred).  But in their most recent reply brief, they suggest that this \nalso could include transfer to \"another correctional space, a hospital or medical facility, \na clinic, [or] administrative furlough.\"  Pls.' Reply in Supp. of Renewed Mot. for Prelim. \nInj. (dkt. no. 64) at 29.  The Sheriff contends that, under the PLRA, only a three-judge \ncourt may order such transfers and that, regardless, he lacks the authority to transfer \ndetainees to electronic home monitoring.  The Court starts with the threshold issue:  \nwhether this Court may, on its own, order the transfer of detained persons as proposed \nby the plaintiffs. \n  As indicated, under the PLRA, \"[i]n any civil action in Federal court with respect \nto prison conditions, a prisoner release order shall be entered only by a three-judge \n68 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 69 of 87 PageID #:2002\ncourt.\"  18 U.S.C.§ 3626(a)(3)(B).  The PLRA defines \"prisoner release order\" as \"any \norder, including a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunctive relief, that has \nthe purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison population, or that directs the \nrelease from or nonadmission of prisoners to a prison.\"  18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(4).  It \ndefines \"prison\" as \"any Federal, State, or local facility that incarcerates or detains \njuveniles or adults accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent \nfor, violations of criminal law.\"  Id. § 3626(g)(5).  This definition plainly includes the Jail. \n  The plaintiffs contend that the transfer of detained persons that they seek would \nnot be a prisoner release order because it would simply involve moving them from one \nplace under the Sheriff's control to another place under his control.  That misses the \nmark.  Transfers to home confinement, administrative furlough, or electronic home \nmonitoring in particular—which, at least up until they filed their reply brief, are the \nprimary forms of transfer the plaintiffs have requested—would constitute prisoner \nrelease orders because they would have \"the purpose or effect of reducing [the] \npopulation\" of the Jail.  Id. § 3626(g)(4); Money, 2020 WL 1820660, at *12 (transfers of \nprisoners to temporary medical furlough or home detention within the state's custody \nwould constitute prisoner release orders because \"the PLRA does not focus on \ncustodial status under state law, nor does it say anything about whether the reduction of \npopulation is temporary or permanent.\").  Population reduction is the \"whole point\" of \nthe transfers the plaintiffs seek—they propose to prevent or curb the spread of \ncoronavirus to detained persons, and in particular those who are vulnerable, by \nreducing the Jail's population.  See id. at *13. \n  The transfers sought by the plaintiffs would constitute prisoner release orders for \n69 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 70 of 87 PageID #:2003\nan additional reason:  they would direct the release of detained persons out of the Jail.  \nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(4).  The plaintiffs contend that, for people confined at home at \nthe direction of a state authority, a home may amount to a prison within the meaning of \nthe PLRA.  To be sure, the list of institutions that qualify as prisons under the PLRA is \nnot limited to those specified in the statute.  Witzke v. Femal, 376 F.3d 744, 753 (7th \nCir. 2004) (confinement in a drug rehabilitation halfway house qualified as confinement \nin a correctional facility under the PLRA).  But, as defined by the PLRA, a prison is a \nfacility.  Id. § 3626(g)(5).  The common definition of a facility is \"a building or \nestablishment that [provides a service or feature of a specified kind].\"11  That does not \nappear to cover a person's home; a home, even one in which a person is residing \nsubject to a court or law enforcement authority's order, is not a place that provides \nspecified services or features.12  It is hard to see the PLRA's definition of \"prison\" \nstretching that far.   In addition, even if home confinement and/or electronic home \nmonitoring constitutes imprisonment under state law (an issue the Court need not \ndecide), an order mandating the transfer of prisoners out of the Jail to confinement in \ntheir homes likely would constitute a prisoner release order because it would \"direct[] \nthe release [of prisoners] from . . . a prison\" to another place of confinement, 18 U.S.C. \n§ 3626(g)(4). \n  The plaintiffs, however, appear to take the position even if prisoner transfers \n                                            \n11 Facility, Oxford English Dictionary Online, \nhttps://www.oed.com/view/Entry/67465?redirectedFrom=facility& (last visited April 26, \n2020).   \n12 Home, Oxford English Dictionary Online, \nhttps://www.oed.com/view/Entry/87869?rskey=8yYRsS&result=1&isAdvanced=false \n(last visited April 26, 2020).   \n70 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 71 of 87 PageID #:2004\nhave the effect of reducing the prison population, a single-judge court may order them \nwhere the basis for the order is not crowding or overcrowding.  They may be correct.  \nOne of the PLRA's requirements for the entry of a prisoner release order by a three-\njudge panel is that \"crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a Federal right.\"  18 \nU.S.C. § 3626(a)(3)(E)(i).  Some courts have concluded that single-judge courts can \norder the transfers of prisoners, at least to other facilities, where the purpose of the \ntransfer involves the prisoners' medical needs or vulnerabilities.  See Plata v. Brown, \nNo. C01-1351 TEH, 2013 WL 12436093, at *9–10, 15 (N.D. Cal. June 24, 2013) \n(ordering the transfer to other institutions of certain medically high-risk categories of \nprisoners out of two prisons where they were at risk of contracting Valley Fever, a \ndisease not spread through human-to-human contact); Reaves v. Dep't of Correction, \n404 F. Supp. 3d 520, 523–24 (D. Mass. 2019) (denying a stay pending appeal and \nexplaining why the PLRA permitted the court to order the transfer of a quadriplegic \nprisoner to a medical facility equipped to care for him in Reaves v. Dep't of Correction, \n392 F. Supp. 3d 195 (D. Mass. 2019), appeal docketed, No. 19-2089 (1st Cir. Nov. 4, \n2019)); see also Money, 2020 WL 1820660, at *12 n.11 (suggesting that a single-judge \ncourts can order prisoner transfers for reasons other than crowding).  This conclusion \nseems correct:  because three-judge courts can order prisoner releases only where \ncrowding is the primary cause of the violation of a federal right, 18 U.S.C. § \n3626(a)(3)(E)(i), to ensure the vindication of people in custody's constitutional rights, the \nPLRA must be read to permit courts to order transfers where some other condition \ncauses the violation of a constitutional right.  See Plata, 2013 WL 12436093, at *9–10. \n  But a single judge's ability to order a prisoner transfer for reasons other than \n71 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 72 of 87 PageID #:2005\ncrowding makes no difference in this case:  the primary basis for the transfers the \nplaintiffs request is to reduce crowding in the Jail.  See Money, 2020 WL 1820660, at \n*13 (plaintiffs' suggestion that they did not seek a remedy for overcrowding \n\"contradict[ed] the allegations of their complaint and their entire theory of the case\").  To \nput it in simple terms, one of plaintiffs' core contentions is that their constitutional rights \nare being violated because social distancing, which they contend is crucial to protect \ntheir health, has not been or cannot be accomplished at the Jail.  Social distancing is \nessentially the converse of overcrowding.  Thus it is apparent that the plaintiffs' request \nfor prisoner transfers or releases is based on overcrowding.   \n  To be more specific, one of the central allegations in the complaint is that the \ncrowded conditions in the Jail \"ensure the continued[,] rapid, uncontrolled spread of \nCOVID-19 within the Jail and beyond—because the Jail is not and cannot be isolated \nfrom the larger community\" and \"because the Jail is a crowded, congregate \nenvironment.\"  Compl. (dkt. no. 1) ¶ 2; see also, e.g., id. at ¶¶ 20, 25–26, 30–35, 37–41, \n46, 51.  The plaintiffs hinge their legal arguments on the contention that \"without a \nreduction of the Jail's population, the lives and safety of the persons confined there \ncannot be reasonably protected\" because \"social distancing is not possible with the \ncurrent jail population.\"  Pls.' Reply in Supp. of Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. \n64) at 1; see also, e.g., Pls.' Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 55) at 1 (\"The virus \nis spreading rapidly in the jail . . ., and that is not surprising: People are sleeping within \nthree feet of each other, eating and using showers in close proximity to each other, and \ntouching the same surfaces.\").  They contend that the imperative of social distancing is \nan undisputed \"medical necessity\" and that \"[a]ll of the evidence in this record supports \n72 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 73 of 87 PageID #:2006\nthat proposition.\"  Pls.' Reply in Supp. of Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 64) at 3.  \nAs indicated, they cite evidence from a range of sources—including the CDC, the \ngovernor of Illinois, the City of Chicago, and medical and epidemiological experts—\nreflecting that social distancing is among the most effective and important interventions \nto reduce the spread of coronavirus and protect public health right now.  Id. at 3–5; see \nalso, e.g., Pls.' Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 55) at 4–8.  And, crucially, they \ncontend that social distancing at the jail is impossible because of its current population \nlevels.  Id. at 10 (\"[I]f the current population of a jail unavoidably creates intolerable risk \nto life and health then the current population must change.\"); see also id. at 10–13; Pls.' \nReply in Supp. of Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 64) at 6–8.  In short, the \nplaintiffs are requesting transfers because social distancing is impossible; with that in \nmind, it is incongruous to contend that crowding is not the basis or primary basis for \nseeking compelled transfers.  See Money, 2020 WL 1820660, at *13. \n  Citing United States v. Cook County, 761 F. Supp. 2d 794 (N.D. Ill. 2000), the \nplaintiffs contend that the PLRA applies only to prisoner release orders that are \n\"explicitly related to population caps,\" not to all such orders stemming primarily from \ncrowding.  Pls.' Reply in Supp. of Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 64) at 32 (citing \nid. at 796 –97).  That interpretation stretches the statute's language too far.  Even if \n\"[s]ponsors of the PLRA were especially concerned with courts setting 'population \ncaps,'\" Plata, 2013 WL 12436093, at *10 (quoting Gilmore v. California, 220 F.3d 987, \n998 n. 14 (9th Cir. 2000)), the PLRA's text does not limit prisoner release orders issued \nby three-judge courts to only orders that set population caps, see 18 U.S.C. § \n3626(a)(3)(E).  United States v. Cook County does not suggest otherwise.  The three-\n73 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 74 of 87 PageID #:2007\njudge court in that case found \"that overcrowding [was] a primary cause of \nunconstitutional conditions at the jail\" because it caused, among other things, \n\"excessive force by guards, grossly unsanitary and unhealthy conditions, and grossly \ninadequate medical (including mental-health) care.\"  Cook County, 761 F. Supp. 2d at \n797.  Although these conditions might have existed even without overcrowding, \novercrowding made them worse.  Id. at 797–98.  Thus the purpose of the prisoner \nrelease order in Cook County was not merely to set prison caps but, rather, to address \nconstitutional violations caused primarily by overcrowding.  See id.  The same is true in \nthis case:  the severe medical risks posed by coronavirus would exist even if the Jail \nwas not crowded, but the plaintiffs contend the crowding at the Jail significantly \nenhances those risks and makes the outbreak more challenging to control.  The \npurpose of a transfer order would be to address alleged constitutional violations \nstemming from coronavirus due to crowding in the Jail, and that is the type of order than \nonly a three-judge court may issue.   \n  4.  Three-judge court \n  The plaintiffs also have asked the Court to convene a three-judge court \"to \nconsider whether and to what extent to enter a prisoner release order.\"  Pls.' Reply in \nSupp. of Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 64) at 2.  Under the PLRA, \"[i]n any civil \naction in Federal court with respect to prison conditions, a prisoner release order shall \nbe entered only by a three-judge court.\"  18 U.S.C.§ 3626(a)(3)(B).  The Sheriff \ncontends that the requirements for convening a three-judge court have not been met. \n  The PLRA provides that no court may enter a prisoner release order unless two \nrequirements are met.  18 U.S.C. § 3636(a)(3)(A).  First, a court must have \"previously \n74 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 75 of 87 PageID #:2008\nentered an order for less intrusive relief that has failed to remedy the deprivation of the \nFederal right sought to be remedied through the prisoner release order.\"  Id. § \n3636(a)(3)(A)(i) (the \"previous order requirement\").  In addition, the defendant must \nhave \"had a reasonable amount of time to comply with the previous court orders.\"  Id. § \n3636(a)(3)(A)(ii) (the \"reasonable time requirement\").   \n  Together, these requirements ensure that a three-judge court's prisoner release \norder is a \"last resort remedy.\"  Brown, 563 U.S. at 514.  A party requesting a prisoner \nrelease order and the convening of a three-judge court must file \"materials sufficient to \ndemonstrate\" that both requirements have been met.  Id. § 3636(a)(3)(C).  A federal \njudge can also request sua sponte the convening of a three-judge court if both \nrequirements are met.  Id. § 3636(a)(3)(D).  The judge need not consider the likelihood \nof whether a three-judge court would issue a prisoner release order.  See Plata v. \nSchwarzenegger, No. C01-1351-TEH, 2007 WL 2122657, at *1 (N.D. Cal. July 23, \n2007).   \n    a.  Previous order requirement \n  The Court starts with the previous order requirement.  It previously entered an \norder for less intrusive relief by issuing the TRO.  Mays, 2020 WL 1812381, at *14–16.  \nThe Sheriff contends that the TRO does not satisfy the PLRA's previous order \nrequirement because it did not include an order requiring social distancing.  In the TRO \ndecision, the Court found that the plaintiffs had failed \"to show a reasonable likelihood of \nsuccess on their contention that the Sheriff is acting in an objectively unreasonable \nmanner by failing to mandate full social distancing.\"  Id. at *10.  The Court declined to \norder relief with respect to social distancing throughout the Jail but required the Sheriff \n75 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 76 of 87 PageID #:2009\nto enforce social distancing in connection with the new detainee intake process.  Id. at \n*14.    \n  The previous order requirement is \"satisfied if the court has entered one order \n[that] 'failed to remedy' the constitutional violation.\"  Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. at 514.  \nNeither the statute nor the relevant case law suggests that a court must attempt all \npossible steps short of release before requesting the convening of a three-judge court.  \nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3636; Brown, 563 at 514–16.  And the PLRA does not require a \nprevious order involving a particular type of remedy; instead, it simply requires a \nprevious order that attempted but failed to remedy the constitutional deprivation itself.  \nSee id.  In Brown, the Supreme Court affirmed an order of a three-judge court \nmandating a population limit for California's prison system as a remedy for constitutional \nviolations in two class actions, one involving a class of prisoners with serious mental \ndisorders and the other involving prisoners with serious medical conditions.  Id. at 499, \n502.  The Court found that district courts \"acted reasonably when they convened a \nthree-judge court,\" despite recent, ongoing plans to address the at-issue constitutional \nviolations, because they \"had a solid basis to doubt\" that the \"additional efforts . . . \nwould achieve a remedy.\"  Id. at 516.   \n  In the TRO, the Court ordered relief less intrusive than a prisoner release order.  \nSpecifically, it required the Sheriff to establish and implement policies regarding \ncoronavirus testing and sanitation in the Jail, implement social distancing during the \nnew detainee intake process, provide adequate soap and/or hand sanitizer and \nsanitation supplies, and provide facemasks to all detained persons who are \nquarantined.  Mays, 2020 WL 1812381, at *14–15.  Because the TRO has not remedied \n76 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 77 of 87 PageID #:2010\nthe overall claimed constitutional violation—deficient conditions in the Jail during a \npandemic—it satisfied the PLRA's previous order requirement. \n   \n    b.  Reasonable time requirement \n  Additionally, before a three-judge court is convened under the PLRA, the \ndefendant must have \"had a reasonable amount of time to comply with the previous \ncourt orders,\" as indicated.  Id. § 3636(a)(3)(A)(ii).  This provision \"requires that the \ndefendant have been given a reasonable time to comply with all of the court's orders.\"  \nBrown, 563 U.S. at 514 (emphasis added).  In some situations, a court may need \"to \nissue multiple orders directing and adjusting ongoing remedial efforts\" while it \"attempts \nto remedy an entrenched constitutional violation through reform of a complex \ninstitution.\"  Id. at 516.  \"Each new order must be given a reasonable time to succeed, \n[and] reasonableness must be assessed in light of the entire history of the court's \nremedial efforts.\"  Id.  But a court may request the convening of a three-judge court \neven while its remedial efforts are ongoing; otherwise, a court unreasonably would have \n\"to impose a moratorium on new remedial orders\" before a three-judge court considers \nthe issuance of a prisoner release.  Id.  \n  In Brown, the Supreme Court found that defendants in the two consolidated \ncases had reasonable time to comply with court orders where one court had \"engaged \nin remedial efforts\" for five years and the other court had done so for twelve years.  Id.  \nRemedial efforts were ongoing when the district courts requested three-judge courts, \nbut those ongoing efforts merely attempted \"to solve the crisis\" through the same \"basic \nplan[s]\" as earlier efforts.  Id. at 515.  In one case, a special master the district court \n77 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 78 of 87 PageID #:2011\nappointed to oversee remedial matters had issued over seventy remedial orders.  Id.  \nThe courts had no \"assurance[s] that further, substantially similar efforts would yield \nsuccess absent a population reduction.\"  Id.  Indeed, advances that had been made in \none case were \"'slip-sliding away' as a result of overcrowding.\"  Id. (quoting court-\nappointed special master).   \n  The plaintiffs contend that the Sheriff has had a reasonable time to comply with \nthe Court's previous order.  They have requested a preliminary injunction ordering social \ndistancing, but, in light of the urgency of the situation, they also have requested the \nconvening of a three-judge court to consider the question of prisoner release.  The \nplaintiffs appear to contend that if an injunction directing social distancing does not \nremedy the alleged constitutional violations, then only the immediate release of \nprisoners by a three-judge court will achieve a remedy, so a three-judge court needs to \nbe ready to issue a ruling as soon as that time comes.  The Sheriff contends that he has \nnot reasonably had time to comply with any such order because the Court has not \ndirected him to implement social distancing throughout the Jail. \n  The Court recognizes that determination of what amounts to a \"reasonable time\" \nto comply with a court's previous orders may depend on the circumstances, and here \nthe circumstances are extraordinary, involving an infectious virus that can be \ntransmitted quickly from person to person.  So here, perhaps, a \"reasonable time\" may \namount to days or a small number of weeks, not years as may be the case in other \nsituations.   Undue delays in responding to the coronavirus pandemic may place \ndetained persons' health and lives in imminent danger.   \n  Unlike in Brown, however, the ongoing remedial efforts in this case might remedy \n78 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 79 of 87 PageID #:2012\nthe ongoing constitutional violation—which, to be clear, involves the objective \nreasonableness of the Sheriff's response to the coronavirus outbreak, not existence of \ncoronavirus itself—if given adequate time.  The Sheriff has offered evidence that may \nbe understood to suggest that he is making a substantial effort to comply with the \nCourt's order and attempt to improve the conditions of confinement at the Jail in \nresponse to the coronavirus pandemic.  As detailed earlier in this opinion, he has \ncomplied with the TRO by implementing social distancing at intake; developing and \nimplementing a plan to distribute soap, sanitizer, and cleaning suppliers more \nfrequently; and providing facemasks to detained persons housed on tiers under \nquarantine.  In addition, he has made efforts to spread out detainees within the Jail, \neven though the TRO did not mandate it.  As detailed earlier, he has opened up \npreviously closed units, doubled the number of persons housed in single-occupancy \ncells, attempted to ensure that detained persons are assigned beds in dorm units that \nare spaced more than six feet apart, and adopted various practices to encourage \ndetained persons to practice social distancing in dorms and in common areas.   As the \nCourt has explained, it believes that the narrowly tailored relief it is ordering via this \nopinion appropriately addressed the claimed constitutional violations on which the \nplaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success.  Unlike in Brown, the additional relief \nordered in this decision is not based on the same \"basic plan\" as earlier efforts but \nrather takes a different and focused approach.  Brown, 563 U.S. at 515.  In short, it will \nrequire preventative public health measures that the Court has not previously ordered \nand that the Sheriff has not shown he has implemented.  \n  Further, although the PLRA's previous order requirement refers to a single order, \n79 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 80 of 87 PageID #:2013\nits reasonable time requirement uses the plural \"orders.\"  Compare 18 U.S.C. § \n3626(a)(3)(A)(i) with id. § 3626(a)(3)(A)(ii); see also Brown, 563 U.S. at 514.  Nothing in \nthe statute or the relevant case law indicates that a court must convene a three-judge \npanel after issuing only one order.  Rather, the case law reflects that a court can, and \nperhaps in some circumstances should, make additional efforts beyond a single TRO \nbefore convening a three-judge court to consider ordering the release of imprisoned or \ndetained persons.  See id. (releasing prisoners is a \"last resort remedy\").  This seems \nparticularly true where, as here, a Court has a basis on which to issue an additional \norder that is not \"substantially similar\" to its previous order and thus can attempt a new \napproach to remedying the constitutional violation that might \"yield success.\"  Cf. \nBrown, 563 U.S. at 515.   \n  For these reasons, the Court is not persuaded that it has given its less-intrusive \norders \"a reasonable time to succeed,\" Brown, 563 U.S. at 516; that the Sheriff has \n\"reasonable amount of time to comply\" with those orders, 18 U.S.C. § 3636(a)(3)(A)(ii); \nor that the Sheriff could have reasonable time to comply in light of the further efforts the \nCourt is taking in this order to remedy the claimed constitutional violations.  The Court \nconcludes that the PLRA's reasonable time prerequisite for the convening of a three-\njudge court has not yet been satisfied.   \n  For these reasons, the Court declines to request the convening of a three-judge \ncourt. 13  \n   \n                                            \n13 As the Court has previously advised the parties, however, immediately after the \nissuance of the TRO, the Court advised the chief circuit judge of the pendency of the \ncase and the potential need, at some point, to convene a three-judge court. \n80 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 81 of 87 PageID #:2014\n  5.  Irreparable harm \n  In addition to showing a likelihood of success on the merits, the plaintiffs must \nshow that they will likely suffer irreparable harm without a preliminary injunction.  \nWhitaker, 858 F.3d at 1044.  Irreparable harm is \"harm that cannot be repaired and for \nwhich money compensation is inadequate.\"  Orr v. Shicker, 953 F.3d 490, 502 (7th Cir. \n2020) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The plaintiffs must show more than a \"mere \npossibility\" of harm but not that harm has already occurred or is certain to occur.  \nWhitaker, 858 F.3d at 1045.  \"[A] remedy for unsafe conditions need not await a tragic \nevent.”  Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993). \n  The plaintiffs have satisfied this requirement.  They have shown a likelihood that, \nwithout additional measures to expand and enforce social distancing and the \ncontinuation of measures aimed at enhancing sanitation of surfaces within the Jail and \notherwise curbing the spread of coronavirus among detained persons, some of the \nclass members will contract the virus.   If they contract coronavirus, class members—\nparticularly those over the age of sixty-five or with certain preexisting health \nconditions—risk severe health consequences, including death.  These grave risks to \nhealth are not an insignificant possibility for the class members, all of whom are live in \nthe Jail's congregate environment, where the coronavirus has been spreading for weeks \nand where detained persons—even those who sleep their own cells—share spaces like \ncommon areas and showers.  Therefore, the plaintiffs have adequately shown a \nlikelihood that they will suffer irreparable harm without a preliminary injunction. \n  6.  No adequate remedy at law  \n  The plaintiffs also must show that they have no adequate remedy at law should \n81 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 82 of 87 PageID #:2015\nthe preliminary injunction not issue.  Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1046.  They are not required \nto show that a remedy is \"wholly ineffectual\" but rather \"that any award would be \nseriously deficient as compared to the harm suffered.\"  Id.  Where harm cannot be \npracticably remedied by monetary damages, there is no adequate legal remedy.  See \nid.; Foodcomm Int'l v. Barry, 328 F.3d 300, 304 (7th Cir. 2003); see also W.S.R. v. \nSessions, 318 F. Supp. 3d 1116, 1126–27 (N.D. Ill. 2018) (no adequate remedy of law \nto address harm from prolonging child's separation from parent).  The plaintiffs have \nclearly shown that the risk of harm to their health and possibly their lives cannot be fully \nremedied through damages, and therefore they have shown that they have no adequate \nremedy at law.    \n  7.  Balancing of harms \n  \"Once a moving party has met its burden of establishing the threshold \nrequirements for a preliminary injunction, the court must balance the harms faced by \nboth parties and the public as a whole.\"  Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1054.  The nature of the \nbalancing analysis depends on the moving party's likelihood of success: the higher the \nlikelihood, the more the balance tips in favor of granting injunctive relief.  Id.  Before \nissuing an injunction ordering a defendant to perform an affirmative act, which can \nimpose \"significant burdens on the defendant,\" a court must give \"careful consideration \n[to] the intrusiveness of the ordered act, as well as the difficulties that may be \nencountered in supervising the enjoined party's compliance with the court's order.\"  \nKartman, 634 F.3d at 892 (discussing certification of a class seeking mandatory \ninjunctive relief). \n  The Sheriff argues that the balance of harms weighs against issuing a \n82 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 83 of 87 PageID #:2016\npreliminary injunction because he is doing the best he can to contain the spread of \ncoronavirus at the Jail, including, he contends, following the CDC Guidelines to the \ngreatest extent possible.  He argues that an order requiring him to implement more \nhealth and protective measures would be disruptive to his ongoing and persistent efforts \nto protect detainees from coronavirus.  He also argues that the Court should defer to his \nexpertise and judgment regarding the best policies and practices to implement at the \nJail, particularly in light of the fundamental need for him to maintain internal security and \norder.  See Bell, 441 U.S. at 547–48.  The plaintiffs contend that the risk of severe \nhealth consequences or death to the class members is so grave that it tips the balance \nof harms in favor of granting a preliminary injunction.  Additionally, the plaintiffs argue \nthe public's interest in containing outbreaks of coronavirus favors granting injunctive \nrelief. \n  The Court concludes that the balance favors granting preliminary injunctive relief \nto the plaintiffs to the limited extent contemplated by this order.  First, as detailed above, \nthe plaintiffs have presented ample evidence of conditions that pose an unreasonable \nrisk of serious harm to the class members' health and, despite the laudable strides the \nSheriff has made since the Court issued the TRO, at least some shortcomings in the \nSheriff's mitigation of that risk.  This evidence tips the balance in favor of injunctive relief \nbecause, as the Court has explained, the plaintiffs have far surpassed their burden of \ndemonstrating a \"better than negligible\" likelihood of success on the merits.  Whitaker, \n858 F.3d at 1046 (quoting Cooper v. Salazar, 196 F.3d 809, 813 (7th Cir. 1999)).  The \ninterest of the public in containing the spread of coronavirus further tips the balance in \nfavor of injunctive relief. \n83 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 84 of 87 PageID #:2017\n  As it did in issuing the TRO, the Court acknowledges the deference owed to the \nSheriff in the operation of the Jail and in his development of internal procedures to \nmaintain safety, order, and security and to response to this severe crisis.  The Court \nrecognizes the immense amount of time and work that the Sheriff and his staff have \nspent trying to respond to this crisis.  The Court further recognizes that compliance with \njudicial orders impose burdens on the Sheriff and his staff, in no small part by requiring \nthem to devote some of their limited time and resources to following a court's directives.  \n  The Court has taken these considerations into account in ordering the limited \nrelief described in this order.  It has ensured that the relief is narrowly drawn, extends \nno further than necessary, and is the least intrusive means necessary to address the \nshortcomings discussed earlier in this opinion.  The Court has tailored the relief to \naccount for deference to the Jail's ongoing planning and efforts to address the risks \nassociated with the coronavirus outbreak.  The Court also has, as indicated earlier, \ntaken into account the enhanced requirements for issuing what it has referred to as a \n\"mandatory injunction.\"  And the Court has concluded that it will not encounter \nsignificant obstacles in supervising the order despite its mandatory nature.  Despite \nthese considerations, the risk to the health and safety of detainees and others is \nsufficient to permit and require preliminary injunctive relief.   \nC.  Preliminary injunctive relief \n  For the reasons stated above, the plaintiffs have met the criteria for a preliminary \nrestraining order with regard to at least parts of Count 1 of their complaint.  The Court \norders as follows and will also include this in a separate preliminary injunction order \nissued under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(d).  \n84 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 85 of 87 PageID #:2018\n•  The Sheriff shall maintain and carry out a policy requiring prompt coronavirus \ntesting of: (1) detained persons who exhibit symptoms consistent with \ncoronavirus disease, and (2) at medically appropriate times, detained persons \nwho have been exposed to others who have exhibited those symptoms or have \ntested positive for coronavirus.  With regard to the category (2), the Sheriff must \nacquire and maintain sufficient testing materials so that determination of the \nappropriateness of testing such persons is made pursuant to medical and public \nhealth considerations and not the availability of testing materials.  \n•  The Sheriff shall enforce social distancing during the new detainee intake \nprocess, including continued suspension of the use of bullpens and other \nmultiple-person cells or enclosures to hold new detainees awaiting intake. \n•  The Sheriff shall provide soap and/or hand sanitizer to all detainees in quantities \nsufficient to permit them to frequently clean their hands.   \n•  The Sheriff shall provide sanitation supplies sufficient and adequate to enable all \nstaff and detainees to regularly sanitize surfaces and objects on which the virus \ncould be present, including in all areas occupied or frequented by more than one \nperson (such as two-person cells, as well as bathrooms, showers, and other \nsurfaces in common areas).  The Sheriff shall also maintain and carry out a \npolicy requiring sanitization between all uses of frequently touched surfaces and \nobjects as well as monitoring and supervision to ensure that such sanitization \ntakes place regularly. \n•  The Sheriff shall provide facemasks to all detained persons who are \nquarantined—i.e., those who have been exposed to a detained person who is \n85 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 86 of 87 PageID #:2019\nsymptomatic (even if not coronavirus-positive).  The facemasks must be replaced \nat medically appropriate intervals, and the Sheriff must provide the users with \ninstruction on how to use a facemask and the reasons for its use. \n•  The Sheriff shall establish by no later than April 29, 2020 and shall put into effect \nby no later than May 1, 2020 a policy precluding group housing or double celling \nof detained persons, except in the following situations: \n  Persons detained in tiers or dormitories currently under quarantine \no\nfollowing a positive test for the coronavirus within the tier or dormitory \n(\"quarantine tiers\"); \n  Detained persons who have tested positive for the coronavirus and are \no\nunder medical observation (\"isolation tiers\"); \n  Detained persons who have tested positive for coronavirus and are \no\nrecovering (\"convalescent tiers\"); \n  Double-celled or dormitory-housed detainees for whom there is a \no\ndocumented determination by a medical or mental health professional that \nsingle-celling poses a risk of suicide or self-harm; \n  Persons detained housed in a dormitory unit that is at less than fifty \no\npercent capacity; and \n  Detained persons committed, at the documented direction of a medical or \no\nmental health professional, to a group housing unit that is equipped for \nmedical or mental health treatment, if but only if there is not available \nspace in an appropriate housing or medical unit that permits full social \ndistancing.   \n86 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 87 of 87 PageID #:2020\n•  Detained persons housed in any of the listed \"acceptable\" arrangements must be \nprovided with facemasks that are replaced at medically appropriate intervals.  \nThe detained persons must be provided with instruction on how to use a \nfacemask and the reasons for its use.  They also must be instructed, at regular \nintervals, on the importance of social distancing. \n•  On May 1, 2020, the Sheriff shall file a report regarding his compliance with the \nterms of the preliminary injunction. \n  Finally, the Court will entertain submissions by the parties regarding the duration \nof the preliminary injunction, in particular the social distancing provisions.  Typically, a \npreliminary injunction lasts until the trial on the merits, but the order the Court is entering \nis predicated on an underlying condition—the ongoing pandemic—that, one can hope, \nwill not last indefinitely.  Under ordinary circumstances, there is nothing constitutionally \ninappropriate about housing detained persons in groups and allowing them to come into \ncontact with each other.  Currently we are not living in ordinary circumstances—hence \nthe preliminary injunction—but once matters return to something approaching normal, it \nmay be appropriate to loosen the requirements of the injunction.  The Court (either the \nemergency judge or the assigned judge) will address this with the parties at a future \ndate. \nConclusion \n  The Court grants the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction in part and denies \nit in part as set out in this Memorandum Opinion and Order [dkt. no. 55]. \n \n              ________________________________ \n                MATTHEW F.

Plaintiffs (a) explain the mental-state requirement for the Class’s \nclaims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (b) explain why Subclass A Petitioners’ claims are not barred by the \nexhaustion doctrine; and (c) advise the Court whether electronic home monitoring constitutes \n“custody” under Illinois law.  \nSELECTED POINTS OF FACT FOR PLAINTIFFS’ LEGAL ARGUMENTS \n \nThe evidence supporting Plaintiffs’ motion shows that the Sheriff’s policies are not sufficient \nto provide “objectively reasonable” conditions for detainees who are exposed to the massive \noutbreak of COVID-19. The policies—facially and as a matter of implementation—fail to comport \nwith CDC Guidance, including governing correctional facilities, and put the lives of detainees at risk. \nThis renders an emergency Temporary Restraining Order (T.R.O.) both proper and necessary, under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment. The deficient policies are: \n--Medical Triage of the Vulnerable: The Cook County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) policies, as \nevidenced by the “Coronavirus Operation Plan” (“Operation Plan”), Ex. P to Defendant’s Response \n  1 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 42 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 2 of 20 PageID #:1031\nto Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order, and by “Michael Miller’s Declaration” \n(Miller Decl.) and supporting exhibits, Ex. H to the Defendant’s Response, do not provide a process \nby which the Sheriff identifies detainees who are in high risk categories for contracting serious \nCOVID 19, either because of age or pre-existing medical conditions. They also do not provide for \nany measures to separate these vulnerable detainees from others who have the virus or are suspected \nto have the virus. The Sheriff’s policy failures are supported by the declarations of the named \nplaintiffs, both of whom are medically vulnerable (Foster with lung cancer, Complaint Ex. F; Mays \nwith diabetes and a heart condition, Compl. Ex. D). Neither have received particular protections as a \nresult of their unique susceptibility to a lethal disease. The same is true of other detainees in \ndivisions throughout the Jail,1 evidenced by the declarations submitted with the Complaint.2 \n--Social Distancing: The CCSO policies do not adequately provide for social distancing.  The CDC \nrecommends individuals keep a spatial distance of 6 feet from other people, not gather in groups, \nand stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.3 This is in line with the Governor’s stay-\n \n1   E.g., Anthony Mays (Complaint Ex. D) (Mr. Mays is a detainee housed in Division 8, tier 3F, with \nDiabetes and a heart condition); Vincent Stewart (Compl. Ex.

The Sheriff’s policy is ostensibly to try to fill \nevery tier to no more than 50% of capacity—it is not, in fact, in effect. Miller Decl. ¶ 18(d) \n(“Providing a single cell to every detainee, or if in a dorm setting not exceeding 50% occupancy, is an \non-going process, subject to our ability to open previous closed areas safely and securely.”) (emphasis \nadded). Implementing social distancing is not ultimately feasible given the current population size.6 \nPuisis makes this clear: “The County of Cook is forcing over 4,700 people to live in congregate \nliving conditions at the Cook County…The current CDC recommendations for social distancing \nand frequent handwashing measures, which are the only measures available to protect against \ninfection, are not possible in the current correctional environment at the Jail.” Puisis Dec.

In the absence of \nimmediate relief, lives and health will continue to be placed at unacceptable risk. \nThis court should enter a temporary restraining order to immediately require the Sheriff to \ncorrect the failures listed above, as required by the CDC. In a nearly identical case, today, another \nfederal district court judge in Miami entered a T.R.O to address strikingly similarly circumstances. \nThat T.R.O. is attached. See Ex A.  Further, the court should also establish a procedure for the \nexpedited consideration for release of the members of subclass A. \nI.  The Fourteenth Amendment Does Not Require Plaintiffs to Show Defendant \nKnew His Objectively Unreasonable Conduct Would Cause Plaintiffs To \nEndure Infirm Conditions but Plaintiffs Have Made That Showing. \n \nPlaintiffs seek emergency injunctive relief because the Sheriff is violating their Fourteenth \nAmendment right to objectively reasonable conditions of confinement. To prove this claim, \nPlaintiffs must show that the Sheriff acted with purpose, knowledge, or possibly recklessness “with \nrespect to the bringing about of certain physical consequences in the world.” Kingsley v. Hendrickson, \n576 U.S. 389, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2472 (2015). The Sheriff concedes, for purposes of the issues in this \ncase (Def. 4/6/20 Br. at 3), that his actions “were purposeful and knowing.” Equally clear, though, \nunder multiple, recently decided Seventh Circuit cases, the defendant’s state of mind with respect to \nwhether those actions are inappropriate or potentially harmful is irrelevant. See, e.g., Hardeman v. Curran, 933 \nF.3d 816, 823 (7th Cir. 2019) (an “objective inquiry applies to all Fourteenth Amendment \nconditions-of-confinement claims brought by pretrial detainees”). In other words, proof of \ndeliberate indifference on the part of a defendant is not required. Kingsley, 135 S. Ct. at 2473; see also \nMiranda v. County of Lake, 900 F.3d 335, 354 (7th Cir. 2018). \n  9 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 42 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 10 of 20 PageID #:1039\nIn Hardeman, a class of pretrial detainees brought a lawsuit against the sheriff of Lake County \nand his chief of corrections under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation of their Fourteenth Amendment \nrights when the defendants shut off all water in the jail for three days without warning. Hardeman v. \nCty. of Lake, 2018 WL 3533254, at *1 (N.D. Ill. July 23, 2018). On appeal, the Seventh Circuit held \nthat plaintiffs had sufficiently pled a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment by alleging that “Lake \nCounty officials prevented them from caring for themselves and then deprived them of the most \nbasic of human needs—water.” Hardeman, 933 F.3d at 825. “The resulting alleged unsanitary \nconditions and physical harms were objectively unreasonable conditions of confinement that (if \nproven) violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s due-process guarantee.” Id. The Seventh Circuit \ndid not require plaintiffs to allege that the corrections chief intended, or even knew, about the \nconditions in the cellhouse that resulted from their deliberate actions. It was sufficient for plaintiffs \nto allege that the defendants’ actions to turn off the water was intentional, that it was objectively \nunreasonable, and that defendants’ actions proximately caused the plaintiffs to suffer objectively \nunreasonable conditions of confinement. Id. \nOne district court in this District has expressed the question of intent under the Fourteenth \nAmendment this way: “The state-of-mind requirement is measured against each \ndefendant’s actions (that is, whether they intentionally or recklessly engaged in the action), rather than \ntheir subjective view of the risks of the allegedly inadequate [action].”Gaston v. Beatty, No. 17-cv-\n01798, 2020 WL 1288878, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 18, 2020) (emphasis added). In other words, the \n“intent” that the Supreme Court has long held is required to prevail on a claim under the Fourteenth \nAmendment, see Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 328 (1986), refers to the action of the defendant: is \nit intentional or is it negligent? See Miranda, 900 F.3d at 354 (finding the requisite intent because \ndefendants “deliberately chose a ‘wait and see’ monitoring plan”). If the action was taken negligently, \nthen liability under the Fourteenth Amendment cannot attach. But if the action was taken \n  10 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 42 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 11 of 20 PageID #:1040\nintentionally, and if that action is objectively unreasonable and proximately causes the plaintiffs to \nsuffer injury, then the Fourteenth Amendment has been violated. See Williams v. Ortiz, 937 F.3d 936, \n942-43 (7th Cir. 2019) (in medical care context, Fourteenth Amendment poses two questions: “(1) \nwhether [the plaintiff] suffered from an objectively serious medical condition and (2) whether the \nmedical staff’s response to it was objectively unreasonable”); Lavite v. Eales, No. 19-cv-00953-JPG,  \n2019 WL 6728919, at *2 (S.D. Ill. Dec. 11, 2019) (to prevail on a conditions claim, pretrial detainee \nmust show “(1) there is a deprivation that is, from an objective standpoint, sufficiently serious to \ndeprive the plaintiff of ‘the minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities, and (2) the defendant’s \nfailure to respond or remedy the situation was objectively unreasonable.”) \nIn this case, the Sheriff has admitted that the Office “acted purposefully and knowingly” \nwhen promulgating its policies, including what those policies do (and do not) provide, and how \nthose policies do (and do not) comply with the CDC Guidance. Dkt. 40 at 3. Accordingly, the only \nlegal question remaining is whether those policies, and what they contain or omit, are objectively \nunreasonable. Miranda, 900 F.3d at 352; see also Glisson v. Ind. Dep’t of Corrs., 849 F.3d 372, 379 (7th \nCir. 2017) (a municipality’s intentional decision not to have a policy is “just as much a ‘policy’” as an \naffirmative policy is); see also id. at 383 (Sykes, J., dissenting) (agreeing a municipality’s deliberate \nchoice not to have a policy is equivalent to affirmative policy; dissenting on the issue of causation). \n  Under this law, the Sheriff’s COVID-19 policies are objectively unreasonable. As set forth \nmore fully above, the Sheriff’s policies fall short of the CDC Guidance both facially and as a matter \nof implementation. The Sheriff implemented these policies knowingly and purposefully. Precisely \nbecause they fall short of the CDC Guidance, which the Sheriff himself acknowledges is the gold \nstandard for response to the coronavirus, there is a public health crisis in the Jail. Among other \nthings, detainees do not have adequate soap, cleaning supplies, or PPE to protect them from this \n  11 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 42 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 12 of 20 PageID #:1041\ndeadly disease, and vulnerable detainees are forced to share a locked “hot box” with symptomatic \ndetainees without regard to their vulnerability. \n  If this Court determines that Plaintiffs are required to show that Sheriff Dart has actual \nknowledge of the effects of his policies on the Plaintiff class in order to prevail on any particular \nrequest for injunctive relief, Plaintiffs easily meet this burden. In the weeks and days since his \nobjectively unreasonable policies were formalized, the Sheriff has been put on the clearest possible \nnotice that they are failing disastrously. The Jail is the site of a public health disaster.  The Cook \nCounty Jail is the site of the second largest cluster of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United \nStates. Suspected infections have occurred on 62 separate tiers located throughout the Jail, all of \nwhich are now on lockdown. Yet, in his submission to the court, the Sheriff does not even acknowledge \nthe magnitude of the public health disaster unfolding on his watch. He offers not a shred of evidence that he \nhas sought help or modified his policies in any way in response to the horrific unfolding of COVID-\n19 cases in the last 14 days.  \n  It is well established that claims for injunctive relief are assessed at the time relief is to be \nentered. See, e.g., Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 36 (1993) (on prisoner’s claim for injunctive relief, \nintent requirement “should be determined in light of the prison authorities’ current attitudes and \nconduct” (emphasis added)); Farmer v. Brennan, 825 U.S. 511, 845 (1994) (intent on injunctive claim \nshould be “determined in light of the prison authorities’ current . . . conduct”).  In any event, there is \nno dispute that the Sheriff now knows about the precise conditions that Plaintiffs raise; this lawsuit \nmade him aware. Moreover, the Sheriff regularly walks through the Jail.15 He knows precisely what is \n \n15   See, e.g., WGN 720 Radio Interview with Sheriff Dart (Mar. 18, 2020), https://wgnradio.com/roe-\nconn/covid-19-containing-the-virus-behind-bars/ (last visited Apr. 7, 2020) (\"I wandered around division 6 \nand 10 yesterday talking with our folks, and our staff's . . . just amazing. . . .  And I talked to some of the \ndetainees too and they seem to have an understanding of what's going on.\"); Mark Konkol, “A Year In Jail \nFor Stealing Toothpaste?

He cannot claim to be unaware of the circumstances about which so many \ndetainees and staff have complained. Accordingly, even if the Court were to conclude, with respect \nto a particular item, that the Fourteenth Amendment demands a showing of the Sheriff’s actual \nknowledge of the specific conditions that have flowed from his policies, Plaintiffs should prevail.  \nII.  Petitioners’ Habeas Claims Are Not Barred by the Exhaustion Doctrine \nThis Court requested that Subclass A Plaintiffs brief the question of whether their claims for \nhabeas-corpus relief are barred by the exhaustion doctrine. They are not. First, under the non-\nstatutory, flexible, and prudential standard of exhaustion in pre-conviction cases, exhaustion is futile \nwhere each passing day risks Plaintiffs’ lives and where exhaustion would take weeks rather than \ndays,16 and for the same reasons exhaustion should be excused under the Court’s broad equitable \nauthority.   \nFederal courts apply a judge-made exhaustion doctrine in § 2241 cases. See Braden v. 30th \nJudicial Circuit Court of Kentucky, 410 U.S. 484, 490 (1973). Unlike the statutory exhaustion \nrequirement in § 2254, though, the judge-made exhaustion requirement for § 2241 petitions is \nprudential, flexible, and non-jurisdictional. United States v. Castor, 937 F.2d 293, 297 (7th Cir. 1991); \nSoler v. State of Ind., 47 F.3d 1173 (7th Cir. 1995) (same); see also Santiago-Lugo v. Warden, 785 F.3d 467, \n474 (11th Cir. 2015). The Supreme Court has described the exhaustion doctrine in § 2241 cases as a \n“judicially crafted instrument which reflects a careful balance between important interests of \nfederalism and the need to preserve the writ of habeas corpus as a ‘swift and imperative remedy in all \ncases of illegal restraint or confinement.’” Braden, 410 U.S. at 490 (emphasis added) (citation \nomitted). Courts, accordingly, apply it with those dual purposes in mind. See, e.g., Park v. Thompson, \n \n \n16 Plaintiffs mistakenly failed to elucidate in the hearing on April 7, 2020 that the process for review of bail \ndecisions, under Rule 604(c), is a lengthy process, thus making exhaustion futile in this case involving an \nunprecedented health emergency. \n  13 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 42 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 14 of 20 PageID #:1043\n356 F. Supp. 783, 788 (D. Haw. 1973) (“It is the legal issues that are to be exhausted, not the \npetitioner.”).  \nAn exhaustion requirement in this case would require Plaintiffs to risk their lives so that state \ncourts could take at least several weeks—or months—to consider whether the fact that Plaintiffs’ \nconfinement is threatening their lives requires their release. Thankfully federal law does not require \nsuch a result. Courts have been clear that where a petitioner’s claim threatens to become moot while \nstate courts are considering it, they need not wait to go to federal court. \nIn emergency situations, the exhaustion doctrine does not bar claims that could not be \nvindicated in state court quickly enough. See, e.g., Granberry v. Greer, 481 U.S. 129, 134 (1987) \n(acknowledging that courts may dispense with exhaustion and disrupt potential state proceedings in \n“rare cases where exceptional circumstances of peculiar urgency are shown to exist” (quoting Ex \nparte Hawk, 321 U.S. 114, 117 (1944)); Beharry v. Ashcroft, 329 F.3d 51, 62 (2d Cir. 2003) (exhaustion \nrequirement is satisfied if “available remedies provide no genuine opportunity for adequate relief” or \nif “irreparable injury may occur without immediate judicial relief” (quotations omitted)); Hendricks v. \nZenon, 993 F.2d 664, 672 (9th Cir. 1993) (holding that federal courts “have the discretion to dispense \nwith the [exhaustion] rule in rare cases where exceptional circumstances of peculiar urgency are \nshown to exist.”); Simmons v. Blodgett, 910 F. Supp. 1519, 1523 (W.D. Wash. 1996) (excusing \nexhaustion because “the federal courts need not defer to the state judicial process when no \nappropriate remedy exists at the state level or when there are circumstances rendering the state \nprocess ineffective to protect the rights of the prisoner.”), aff’d, 110 F.3d 39 (9th Cir. 1997); cf. also \nSweeney v. Bartow, 612 F.3d 571, 573 (7th Cir. 2010) (“[A] person who is in state custody awaiting a \ndetermination by the state courts of the legality of his custody may seek federal habeas corpus to \nchallenge that custody without being barred by the [related] Younger doctrine if immediate federal \nintervention is necessary to prevent the challenge from becoming moot.”). Under the common-law \n  14 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 42 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 15 of 20 PageID #:1044\nexhaustion requirement applicable to § 224 cases, courts are asked to strike a reasonable balance \nbetween the interests of comity and federalism and the protection of petitioners’ federal rights. \nBraden, 410 U.S. at 490. In emergency situations, that balance tips in favor of federal rights. \nGranberry, 481 U.S. at 134.  \nHere, there is no question that it would take at least several weeks, if not months, for \nPlaintiffs to exhaust the bond-review process and attendant appeals. To exhaust state remedies, a \npetitioner needs to invoke “one complete round” of the “normal, simple, and established part[s] of \nthe State’s appellate review process.” O’Sullivan vs. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 845 (1999). That process \nhere includes (1) filing a motion for bond reduction in the criminal court, (2) waiting for it to be \ndecided, (3) appealing its denial to the Illinois Court of Appeals, under Illinois Supreme Court Rule \n604(c), and (4) waiting for the appeal to be decided.17 This process takes several months. Compare, \ne.g., Bond Reconsideration Order, State v. Ejaz, No. 19-CR0751-01 (Ck. Cty. Cir. Ct. May 8, 2019), \nwith Order, State v. Ejaz, No. 19-CR-751-01 (Ill. App. 1d Aug. 6, 2019); and compare Bond \nModification Order, State v. Smith, No. 19-CR-7206 (Ck. Cty. Cir. Ct. May 10, 2019), with Order, State \n \n17   Plaintiffs may also have to seek review in the Illinois Supreme Court and wait for that court to decide \nthe case after the 604(c) appeal at the appellate level. Undersigned counsel (after an admittedly abbreviated \nsearch given the timeline) could find exactly one published Illinois Supreme Court case ruling on a question \nof pretrial detention under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 604(c), which authorizes pretrial detainees to seek \nreview in the court. See People v. Purcell, 201 Ill.2d 542 (2002) (ruling that defendant's constitutional right to bail \nwas violated by provision of bail statute that placed burden on defendant to establish that the proof of his \nguilt was not evident, in appeal from appellate court’s ruling on 604(c) petition). The U.S. Supreme Court has \nheld that Illinois’s certiorari procedure is required for exhaustion of post-conviction habeas claims, see \nO’Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 845, but it is not clear whether certiorari is required for non-post-conviction claims. \nThat is because when a remedy is never used to grant the relief requested it is not considered part of a state’s \n“normal . . .  appellate review process.” Compare id., with Wilwording v. Swenson, 404 U.S. 249, 249–50 (1971) \n(reversing appellate court judgment dismissing claim for failing to pursue mandamus and noting that \nmandamus had never been used in state to grant requested relief). In any event, Plaintiffs need not, and do \nnot, take a position on whether resort to the Illinois Supreme Court would be necessary because the ordinary \nappellate process to which they would be subject would take longer than is reasonable to require them to wait \nunder the extreme circumstances of this case. \n \n  15 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 42 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 16 of 20 PageID #:1045\nv. Smith, No. 19-CR-7206 (Ill. App. 1d Aug. 27, 2019).18 It is not plausible that it would be completed \nin time to prevent irreparable harm to Plaintiffs’ health and lives.19 This is particularly evident given \nthat Cook County criminal courts are regularly still denying bail reviews, even for people at high risk \nof COVID-19.20  \nFinally, bond review is the only mechanism available; there is no state habeas proceeding \ngoverning these circumstances. See Beacham v. Walker, 231 Ill.2d 51, 58 (“It is well established that an \norder of habeas corpus is available only to obtain the release of a prisoner who has been incarcerated \nunder a judgment of a court that lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter or the person of the \npetitioner, or where there has been some occurrence subsequent to the prisoner's conviction that \nentitles him to release.”). And even were such a proceeding available, Plaintiffs would not need to \nfile one because a separate habeas proceeding is not part of Illinois’s “normal process . . . of appellate \nreview.” O’Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 845.     \nIf this is not an emergency situation it is hard to imagine what would be. As explained in \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a T.R.O., their lives are at risk every day. And, as explained above, exhausting \nstate remedies would take at least weeks, if not months, to complete. Therefore, exhaustion would be \n \n18   Plaintiffs would be happy to share courtesy copies of these orders with the Court and defense \ncounsel, but did not attach them in an effort not to overwhelm the record.  \n \n19   Named Plaintiffs did not submit requests for bond reduction in the context of the special proceeding \ninstituted by Judge Martin, but this does not constitute a procedural default. As this brief makes clear, \nexhausting the bond review process would take too long and thus would be futile. Moreover, the situation in \nthe jail has deteriorated rapidly since the time of Judge Martin’s special proceeding. Plaintiffs’ claims in this \nCourt stem from the risks to their safety now; that it was unclear (to them) that their safety was at risk several \nweeks ago constitutes cause for their default, even if there were one. See Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72 \n(1977) (establishing cause-and-prejudice standard for procedural default). Additionally, many members of the \nPlaintiffs class were arrested after Judge Martin’s proceedings were concluded and thus would not have had \nthis remedy to pursue, or otherwise had their bond review denied in those proceedings.  \n \n20   Pretrial detainees who have recently moved to alter their conditions of release on the ground that \ntheir lives were threatened in the Jail have been turned away by the state courts. See, e.g., Andy Grimm, “Bail \ndenied—twice—for inmate with COVID-19,” Chicago Sun-Times, (Apr. 1, 2020), \nhttps://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/4/1/21203554/bail-denied-twice-for-inmate-with-covid-\n19. \n  16 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 42 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 17 of 20 PageID #:1046\nfutile, and additionally this Court should exercise its discretion to hear this case even if exhaustion \nwould otherwise be required. \nIII.  Home Confinement or the Electronic Monitoring Program is Custodial, for \nPurposes of the County Jail Act and the Sheriff’s Liability. \n \nThis Court asked Plaintiffs to address whether home confinement or electronic monitoring, \nas administered by the Sheriff, is considered being in “custody” under Illinois law. The answer to \nthat is an unqualified yes.21 \nAs evidence of this, the Illinois crediting statute, effective in 2012, provides that pretrial \nhome detention counts toward the calculation of a term of imprisonment. 730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-100(b): \n(“Except as set forth in subsection (e), the offender shall be given credit on the determinate \nsentence or maximum term and the minimum period of imprisonment for the number of days spent \nin custody as a result of the offense for which the sentence was imposed…. the trial court shall give \ncredit to the defendant for time spent in home detention on the same sentencing terms as incarceration as \nprovided in Section 5-8A-3.” ) (emphasis added). Home detention is “the confinement of a person \nconvicted or charged with an offense to his or her place of residence under the terms and conditions \nestablished by the supervising authority.” 730 ILCS 5/5–8A–2(C) (West 2012). “Supervising \nauthority” is defined as “the Department of Corrections, probation supervisory authority, sheriff, \nsuperintendent of municipal house of corrections or any other officer or agency charged with \nauthorizing and supervising home detention.” 730 ILCS 5/5–8A–2(E) (emphasis added). \nInterpreting this statutory language in toto, the Illinois appellate courts have said that home \nconfinement that is administered by a sheriff’s department (as opposed to as a condition of bond set \nby the criminal court,) constitutes home detention within the purview of the crediting statute, 730 \nILCS 5/5-4.5-100(b), since “any violation of the conditions imposed the sheriff's department ‘could \n \n21   As discussed in the April 7, 2020 hearing, this argument is relevant to Plaintiffs’ claim concerning the \ntransfer subclass B members, not Plaintiffs’ request for release of medically-vulnerable people. \n  17 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 42 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 18 of 20 PageID #:1047\nresult in [the detainee’s] immediate arrest and reincarceration.’” People v. Smith, 2014 IL App (3d) \n130548, ¶ 37 (holding defendant was not entitled to credit for time served on home confinement \nwhere he had been released by trial court as condition of an appeal bond, but differentiating \ndefendant from someone subject to confinement as part of sheriff’s home detention program) \n(citing Beachem, 229 Ill. 2d at 251-53) (individual ordered to report to a Sheriff’s Day Reporting \nProgram was “in custody” for purposes of the Illinois crediting statute and could be re-incarcerated \nin the Cook County Jail at the sheriff’s discretion and without a warrant.) (“In the present case, the \nsheriff's decision to modify the means used to hold defendant had no impact on the sheriff's legal \nauthority over defendant or on defendant's obligation to submit to that authority. Thus, \ndefendant…was in custody while participating in the Program.”).  \n          Further evidence of this proposition can be found in the Sheriff’s regulations governing \nelectronic monitoring and home confinement.22 These state that failure to abide by the requirements \nof home confinement, by tampering with the ankle bracelet or telephone device, renders a detainee \nsubject “to prosecution for the crime of escape.” Cook County Sheriff Rules and Regulations for \nElectronic Monitoring (attached as Ex. _); see also People v. Rogers, 2012 IL App (1st) 102031, ¶ 8 \n(discussing Cook County Sheriff’s electronic monitoring program including program contract \ninforming detainees that “violation of the program conditions may result in a warrant being issued \nfor your arrest for [the] crime of escape under 730 ILCS 5/5–8A–4.1.”). Per those same rules, \ndetainees who wish to obtain “movement” from their home confinement must provide the request \nto the Sheriff’s Department three days in advance. Id. Detainees are only allowed movement if \napproved by the Sheriff.  Id. They must allow the Sheriff’s correctional staff into their home at any \ntime. Id. They are in the Sheriff’s custody  \n \n22 See Cook County Sheriff’s Office, Electronic Monitoring Rules and Regulations, \nhttps://www.cookcountysheriff.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/EMU-711G-Particpant-Information-\nBrochure.pdf (last visited Apr. 7, 2020). \n  18 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 42 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 19 of 20 PageID #:1048\n          The question of custody is relevant for purposes of consideration of the Illinois County Jail \nAct in this litigation. See 730 ILCS 125/14 (“At any time, in the opinion of the Warden, the lives or \nhealth of the prisoners are endangered or the security of the penal institution is threatened, to such a \ndegree as to render their removal necessary, the Warden may cause an individual prisoner or a group \nof prisoners to be removed to some suitable place within the county…where they may be confined until they can be \nsafely returned to the place whence they were removed.”) (emphasis added”). The Sheriff had, and \nstill has, the capacity to move people at risk of contracting COVID-19 from the jail facility at 26th \nand California to another location in his custody, including home confinement, under the terms of \nthe County Jail Act. That he failed to do so when faced with the spread of an infectious disease is \nobjectively unreasonable. See Miranda, 900 F.3d at 353-54 (jury must decide if corrections medical \nofficers were liable under Fourteenth Amendment for failure to provide adequate healthcare where \nthere was evidence they “deliberately chose a ‘wait and see’ monitoring plan,” as to detainee who \nstopped eating and drinking); Smith v. Kapotas, No. 18 C 4260, 2020 WL 553619, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Feb. \n4, 2020) (citing Gordon v. City of Orange, 888 F.3d 1118, 1125 (9th Cir. 2018) (pretrial detainee must \nprove, among other elements, that “the defendant did not take reasonable available measures to \nabate [a serious] risk [of harm], even though a reasonable official in the circumstances would have \nappreciated the high degree of risk involved—making the consequences of the defendant’s conduct \nobvious”)). \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, and as set forth in Plaintiffs’ Complaint, Motion for a Temporary \nRestraining Order, supplemental briefing on the Prison Litigation Reform Act, and as addressed in \nthe April 7, 2020 hearing, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enter a Temporary \nRestraining Order and other such relief as set forth in their Class Action Complaint.  \n \n  19 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 42 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 20 of 20 PageID #:1049\n            Respectfully submitted, \n              /s/ Alexa Van Brunt \n              Counsel for Plaintiffs \nStephen H.

Dart respectfully requests that this Court stay enforcement of \nthe mandatory preliminary injunction order and any discovery related to the underlying \ncomplaint pending appeal. In support of his motion, Sheriff Dart states as follows. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Sheriff seeks a stay from the mandatory injunction order directing him to \nimplement certain operational policies at the Cook County Jail related to the \ncoronavirus pandemic. He is likely to succeed on the merits of this appeal because the \ncourt misinterpreted and misapplied the “objective reasonableness” standard \ngoverning constitutional claims brought by pretrial detainees. If the injunction remains \nin place throughout the appeal, the Sheriff will essentially cede control of critical and \ntime-sensitive Jail operations to the district court, which has effectively made itself \n1030311\\305803793.v1 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-1            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 20\n \n“super-warden” of the Jail. That type of invasive oversight will cause irreparable harm, \nnot only for violating fundamental principles of federalism and judicial restraint, but \nalso because compliance will significantly hamper the Sheriff’s ability to safely operate \nthe Jail. Plaintiffs are not likely to suffer an unreasonable risk of harm if the injunction is \nstayed. Recent test data show that there are currently only 37 COVID-positive detainees \nin the Jail. The COVID test positivity rate is 3%, less than one-third of the rate in the \nsurrounding community, which, by World Health Organization standards, indicates \nthat the virus has been contained.1 \nThe Sheriff sought a stay in district court, which was denied. However, the court \nfailed to conduct any meaningful analysis of the relative harm to the parties in the event \nof a stay. In fact, the court failed to address the Sheriff’s argument on the lack of harm to \nPlaintiffs at all. (Dkt.109, ROA2985). Applying the standard properly here, this Court \nshould find that the Sheriff has established that he is entitled to a stay of enforcement of \nthe injunction and stay any further proceedings in the district court while the case is on \nappeal. \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \nOn April 27, 2020, the district court entered a mandatory preliminary injunction \nagainst the Sheriff directing him to implement certain coronavirus-containment \npractices at the Cook County Jail, the vast majority of which have been in place since \n                                                 \n \n1 Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center, \nhttps://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/testing-positivity (last visited June 5, 2020). \n2 \n1030311\\305803793.v1 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-1            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 20\n \nwell before this lawsuit was filed. The injunction required the Sheriff to continue \nproviding detainees with soap, facemasks, and cleaning supplies; to ensure that Cermak \nHealth Services continues to administer COVID-19 tests to symptomatic detainees and \nthose exposed to COVID-positive detainees, as medically indicated; and to implement \nstrict six-foot social distancing during the Jail intake process and in the housing units, \nsubject to certain exceptions. (Dkt. 73, ROA2017-18).  \nFive days later, the Sheriff filed a status report on implementation of the \ninjunction, as the order required. In it, he stated that he was fully compliant with the \nterms of the injunction at that time. But he cautioned that he was close to reaching the \n“feasibility limit” of his ability to maintain strict social distancing in the housing areas, \nbased on the ever-changing population at the Jail and the complex factors involved in \nmaking housing assignments. (Dkt.84, ROA2216-17).  \nSeveral days later, the Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuit Courts of Appeals \nissued orders staying enforcement of mandatory injunctions against local jails that were \nnearly identical to the one at issue here.2 The appellate courts held that the injunction \norders gave district courts the power to impermissibly interfere with jail operations, \nessentially making them “super-wardens” of the jails at a time when a jail director’s \nexpertise is most needed, and when a court’s interference is most detrimental.  \n                                                 \n \n2 Swain v. Junior, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 14301 (11th Cir., May 5, 2020); Roman v. Wolf, 2020 U.S. \nApp. LEXIS 14331 (9th Cir., May 5, 2020); Valentine v. Collier, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 12941 (5th Cir., \nApr. 22, 2020). \n3 \n1030311\\305803793.v1 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-1            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 20\n \nIn light of this newly-developed case law, and a persistent threat of contempt for \npotentially running afoul of the injunction, the Sheriff filed a timely notice of appeal on \nMay 11, 2020. Several days later, the Sheriff discovered that the coronavirus test \npositivity rate in the Jail had decreased dramatically, to the point of being nearly \ncontained, according to World Health Organization standards. In light of these \ndevelopments, the Sheriff moved to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal. \nOn May 29, 2020, following argument by the parties, the district court denied the \nmotion. (Dkt.109, ROA2976; Exh. A, Hearing Transcript, 5/21/20). The Sheriff now \nrenews his motion in this Court. \nARGUMENT \nThe Seventh Circuit applies a “sliding scale” approach when deciding whether to \nissue a stay of a district court’s ruling pending an appeal.  See Hinrichs v. Bosma, 440 F.3d \n393, 396 (7th Cir. 2006); Sofinet v. INS, 188 F.3d 703, 706-07 (7th Cir. 1999); In re Forty-Eight \nInsulations, Inc. 115 F.3d 1294, 1300-01 (7th Cir. 1997); Cavel International, Inc. v. Madigan, \n500 F.3d 544, 547 (7th Cir. 2007).  Under this sliding scale approach, “the more likely it is \nthat [the party requesting injunctive relief] will succeed on the merits, the less the balance \nof irreparable harms need weigh towards its side; the less likely it is the [moving party] \nwill succeed, the more the balance need weigh toward its side.”  Sofinet v. INS, 188 F.3d \nat 706-707 (quoting Abbott Laboratories v. Mead Johnson & Co., 971 F.2d 6 (7th Cir. 1992)).  \nIn this case, the district court failed to conduct a meaningful analysis of the \nbalancing of harms when ruling on the Sheriff’s motion, and denied the motion based on \nthe merits of the appeal alone. As such, it did not exercise its discretion as required under \n4 \n1030311\\305803793.v1 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-1            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 20\n \nthe standard and its decision is not entitled to deference. Cavel Int’l, 500 F.3d at 547. The \nCourt may conclude, on plenary review, that a stay is warranted. \nI.  The Sheriff is Likely to Succeed on Appeal Because the District Court \nMisapplied the Objective Reasonableness Standard. \n \nPlaintiffs, a proposed class of pretrial detainees, alleged that the Sheriff failed to \nprotect them from the risk of contracting coronavirus in the Jail. Following the United \nStates Supreme Court’s decision in Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2473 (2015), \nthis  Court  applies  the  objective  reasonableness  standard  under  the  fourteenth \namendment to evaluate conditions of confinement claims brought by pretrial detainees. \nHardeman v. Curran, 933 F.3d 816, 822 (7th Cir. 2019). It appears that this may be the first \ncase to apply this emerging “objective reasonableness” standard in the context of the \ncoronavirus pandemic.  \nWhen evaluating whether a jail director’s conduct was objectively reasonable \nunder the fourteenth amendment, courts must consider the “perspective of a reasonable \n[jail director],” including what he “knew at the time, not with the 20/20 vision of \nhindsight.” Kingsley, 135 S. Ct. at 2473. The standard must be applied under the \nparticular facts and circumstances of each case. Id. Courts also must “account for the \n‘legitimate interests that stem from [the government’s] need to manage the facility in \nwhich the individual is detained,’ appropriately deferring to ‘policies and practices that \nin th[e] judgment’ of jail officials ‘are needed to preserve internal order and discipline \nand to maintain institutional security.’” Id., quoting Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 540 \n(1979). “Courts must be mindful that these inquiries spring from constitutional \n5 \n1030311\\305803793.v1 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-1            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 20\n \nrequirements and that judicial answers to them must reflect that fact rather than a court’s \nidea of how best to operate a detention facility.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 539 (emphasis added). \nThe Sheriff’s extensive efforts to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the Jail  \nbegan in January, a full two months before the first case was confirmed and nearly 10 \nweeks before this lawsuit was filed. The Sheriff’s Coronavirus Operation Plan and \nrelated protocols are all based on the Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus \nDisease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities (CDC Guidance), \nissued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the leading authority on \nmanaging the coronavirus outbreak. In interpreting the Guidance, the Sheriff consulted \nwith representatives of the CDC, who toured the Jail facility on April 17 (Dkt.70, \nROA1920), CDPH and IDPH, Cermak, and a team of retained subject matter experts. \nDespite these and many other proactive efforts, the district court concluded that the \nSheriff’s actions were objectively unreasonable, and he did not sustain his constitutional \nburden. However, the district court’s interpretation of the objective reasonableness \nstandard is flawed, and its decision likely to be reversed on appeal. \nAmong other things, Plaintiffs alleged that the Sheriff must implement strict \nsocial distancing throughout the Jail at all times. As Plaintiffs acknowledge, the Sheriff \nmade significant efforts to implement social distancing in the housing tiers to the \nmaximum extent possible, as part of his overall efforts to contain the spread of the \nvirus. He opened 4 previously-closed divisions of the Jail in mid-March to enable more \nsocial distancing. (Dkt.62-5, ROA1687). He also assisted various criminal justice \nstakeholders in obtaining court-ordered bond modifications for over 1,300 eligible \n6 \n1030311\\305803793.v1 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-1            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 20\n \ndetainees in an effort to reduce the Jail population. (Dkt.29-1, ROA377-79). Ultimately, \nthe Sheriff was able to move nearly all detainees into single cells or in dorms occupied \nat 50% capacity or less to maximize social distancing. (Dkt.62-5, ROA1694-99). \nHowever, due to physical and operational limitations at the Jail, the Sheriff is \nunable to implement strict social distancing in all housing tiers. Specifically, the Sheriff \nargued that it was not “feasible” to implement strict social distancing for certain \ndetainee populations: (1) detainees in isolation, quarantine, or convalescent housing \nhave restricted housing requirements because of their infection status; (2) detainees who \nare assigned to housing in the Residential Treatment Unit or the Cermak Urgent Care \ndivision of the Jail must remain in those housing areas physically equipped to manage \ntheir significant medical or mental health needs; and (3) detainees who might be at risk \nof suicide or self-harm if isolated in single-celled housing. (Dkt. 62, ROA1655-69). He \nalso sought a security exception to allow double-celling for purposes of stabilizing a \nsecurity disruption or fight. Nevertheless, it was objectively reasonable to comply with \nthe CDC Guidance here, as with all other coronavirus policies at the Jail, by maximizing \nsocial distancing to the extent possible and relying on “feasibility exceptions” to \naccommodate a lack of physical space and staffing and operational considerations, \nbased on the unique features of the Jail. (Dkt. 30-15, ROA704). \nThe district court disagreed. It held that the CDC Guidelines are an “important \npiece of evidence to consider” in assessing the Sheriff’s conduct, but are not dispositive \nof objective reasonableness. (Dkt.73, ROA1994-95). Accordingly, it held that the Sheriff’s \nconduct was not objectively reasonable here.  \n7 \n1030311\\305803793.v1 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-1            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 20\n \nAs a remedy, the court ordered the Sheriff to implement social distancing in the \nhousing tiers, except for: (1) detainees in isolation, quarantine, or convalescent tiers; (2) \ndetainees assigned to RTU or Cermak specialized medical housing due to medical or \nmental health needs; and (3) detainees who might be at risk of suicide or self-harm \nisolated in a single cell. The court denied the Sheriff’s request for a security exception at \nthe Jail. (Dkt.73, ROA1997-98). \nIn other words, after finding that the Sheriff was objectively unreasonable for \nrelying on the CDC Guidance to implement social distancing as he did, the court \nenjoined the Sheriff to do precisely as he proposed. In doing so, the court necessarily \nnegated the predicate constitutional violation that enabled it to grant relief. That is, if \nthe challenged conduct becomes the court-ordered relief, then that conduct cannot be \nthe basis for a constitutional violation. As a practical matter, where the Sheriff \npreviously relied on his expertise and discretion to make housing assignments and had \nthe flexibility to make adjustments as necessary, he is now bound by court order to \nmake those previously-discretionary housing assignments, but cannot adjust them as \nnecessary without running afoul of the injunction.  \nCertainly that cannot be the correct result. On the contrary, it is objectively \nreasonable for the Sheriff to rely on the CDC Guidance, including its “feasibility \nexceptions,” in implementing the social distancing policy. Not only did the district \ncourt implicitly reach that conclusion with its order on relief, this Court has previously \nacknowledged as much. In Carroll v. DeTella, 255 F.3d 470, 472-73 (7th Cir. 2001), this \nCourt held that it is reasonable for a prison official to rely on standards that a \n8 \n1030311\\305803793.v1 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-1            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 20\n \ngovernment agency promulgates. “They can defer to the superior expertise of those \nauthorities.” Id. In the specific context of the CDC, this Court has held that it was \nobjectively reasonable for a prison to rely on and implement CDC recommendations in \nresponse to a suspected infectious disease outbreak. Forbes v. Edgar, 112 F.3d 262, 267 \n(7th Cir. 1997). Accordingly, the Sheriff is likely to establish success on the merits of the \nappeal based on the court’s improper application of the objective reasonableness \nstandard. \nII.  Irreparable Harm to the Sheriff   \nWhile the likelihood of the success on the merits of the appeal is unquestionably a \nfactor is evaluating the need for a stay, it need not be controlling. The sliding scale \napproach permits the Court to weigh the likelihood of success on appeal with the relative \ndegree of harm in the absence of a stay holistically. Yet here, the district court concluded \nthat  the  Sheriff’s  motion  for  stay  was  meritless  without  undertaking  a  meaningful \nanalysis of the relative harms that would befall the Sheriff or Plaintiffs in the absence of \nan injunction.  See Cavel International, 500 F.3d at 547. \nAt most, the district court expressed skepticism that ordering the Sheriff to \ncomply with an injunction that forces him to do what he already was doing could cause \nirreparable harm. (Dkt.109, ROA2983). On the contrary, this is perhaps the most \ninvidious harm of all. As explained above, when the court enjoins the Sheriff to do \nprecisely what he was doing, the court necessarily negates the supposed constitutional \nviolation that was the predicate for the injunction. If the challenged conduct becomes \n9 \n1030311\\305803793.v1 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-1            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 20\n \nthe court-ordered relief, then that conduct cannot be the basis for a constitutional \nviolation.  \nAs the Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits recently held, a mandatory injunction \nthat restricts the Sheriff’s ability to perform the most critical aspects of jail management \nimpermissibly elevates the district court to “super-warden,” in violation of \nlongstanding federalism principles deeply rooted in United State Supreme Court \nprecedent. The injunction essentially “transfers the power to administer the [Jail] in the \nmidst of the pandemic from public officials to the district court.” Swain v. Junior, 2020 \nU.S. App. LEXIS 14301, *13 (11th Cir., May 5, 2020). It puts the Sheriff in the impossible \nposition of choosing to violate the order to preserve order at the Jail, or run to court to \nget a “permission slip” to lawfully perform the most fundamental Jail operation \nfunctions, which really is no option at all when these decisions need to made in a split-\nsecond. The district court did not address the Sheriff’s arguments about the vital harm \ncaused by the injunction as discussed in Swain, Valentine, or Roman. (Dkt.109, \nROA2980). \nThere is no question that the coronavirus pandemic has had a profound impact \non all aspects of society. Governments around the globe have struggled to find ways to \nrespond to it. The Sheriff wisely enlisted public health experts at the federal, state, and \nlocal levels to assist in developing the appropriate response to the pandemic within the \nJail, and did so well before the first case of coronavirus arrived there.  \nThe Court’s injunction undermines this reasoned and thoughtful approach, and \nthe expert recommendations that it produced. It puts the Court in a superior position to \n10 \n1030311\\305803793.v1 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-1            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 20\n \ndecide what should be done, what can be done, and what must be done under these \ncircumstances. Cf. Bell, 441 U.S. at 539 (courts must defer to the sheriff’s discretion to \noperate the jail as he sees fit, “rather than a court’s idea of how best to operate a \ndetention facility”). The Court’s order is particularly troubling because its duration is \nopen-ended, which places the Sheriff in the unbounded threat of contempt while \nexercising his inherent discretion to safely operate the Jail. All of this amounts to an \nirreparable harm. \nThe United States Supreme Court has long recognized that courts must defer to \nthe expertise of correctional officials to operate their jails as necessary to preserve safety \nand order, and be permitted to exercise their “substantial discretion to devise \nreasonable solutions” the problems they face. Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders, 566 \nU.S. 318, 326 (2012). This is even more critical in the context of a federal district court \ninterfering in the operations of a county jail, given the primacy of a local government’s \ninterest in operating its criminal justice system. Indeed, “it is difficult to imagine an \nactivity in which a State has a stronger interest, or one that is more intricately bound up \nwith state laws, regulations, and procedures, than the administration of its prisons.” \nWoodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 94 (2006).  \nThe harm is no more evident than it was this past weekend. In the midst of the \ncoronavirus pandemic, Chicago and suburban Cook County endured a period of \nextraordinary civil unrest, resulting in unanticipated widespread rioting and looting. It \nresulted in the arrest of more than 1,000 people, many of whom the Sheriff will be \nordered to detain and obligated to house. Yet, the Sheriff is constrained by the \n11 \n1030311\\305803793.v1 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-1            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 20\n \ninjunction that requires him to implement strict social distancing in the housing tiers \nwith limited exceptions that do not address this tension.  \nAs the Sheriff cautioned in his May 1, 2020, Status Report, at some point, he will \nreach a “feasibility limit,” where he cannot house all of the detainees according to the \ndistrict court’s aspirational, yet unmanageable, goals. That limit may arrive following \nan extraordinary situation like last weekend, or a more routine population spike \nfollowing a particularly difficult day in the County. It may last a day, a week, or longer. \nBut the Sheriff cannot refuse to accept custody of these individuals, and they come \nwhen they come. He does not have the luxury of constantly running back to court to get \na “permission slip” to handle a situation that can, and should, be managed on the \nground. In all likelihood, it would probably involve the needless exercise of the Sheriff \nproposing a solution to handle a population spike, and the court accepting it.  \nThe district court, and Plaintiffs, repeatedly recognized the Sheriff’s \nextraordinary efforts to maximize social distancing by opening 5 new divisions of the \nJail (another division opened last week), helping obtain release for 1,300 eligible \ndetainees, and managing the housing tiers like a chess match. He has always acted “in \ngood faith” in doing so, and well before this lawsuit was filed. There is no reason to \nbelieve that he would discontinue these efforts absent the injunction order. The Sheriff \nis implementing social distancing throughout the Jail. But only he is in a position to \nknow when his staff, also not immune from the impacts of the pandemic, may safely \nmanage these strict social distancing practices and when it may not, requiring \nexceptions to manage the security issues inherent in Jail operations. Notably, in these \n12 \n1030311\\305803793.v1 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-1            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 20\n \ntimes of high emotion and frustration in the Jail, the court denied the Sheriff’s requested \nsecurity exception. \nOn May 5, 2020, the Eleventh Circuit stayed enforcement of a similar mandatory \ninjunction entered by the district court against the Miami-Dade Corrections and \nRehabilitations Department, enjoining it to continue implementing the same hygienic, \nsanitization, and social distancing policies that the Sheriff was ordered to continue \nimplementing here. The appellate court found that the injunction “transfer[red] the \npower to administer the [jail] in the midst of the pandemic from public officials to the \ndistrict court.” Swain, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 14301, *13. The appellate court also found \nthat “the injunction hamstrings [jail] officials with years of experience running \ncorrectional facilities, and the elected officials they report to, from acting with dispatch \nto respond to this unprecedented pandemic.” Id. at *13-14. The jail director must be \npermitted to “respond to the rapidly evolving circumstances on the ground without \nfirst seeking ‘a permission slip from the district court.’” Id. at *14, quoting Valentine v. \nCollier, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 12941, *9-10 (5th Cir., Apr. 22, 2020). Ultimately, the \nappellate court found that the district court elevating itself to the role of “super-\nwarden” of the jail caused irreparable harm to the defendants. Id. at *13. \nSwain followed from a decision by the Fifth Circuit just two weeks earlier in \nValentine v. Collier, which also stayed a mandatory injunction that would require the \nTexas Department of Criminal Justice (“TDCJ”) to enact a number of measures to \ncontrol the spread of coronavirus. In addition to the shared reasoning in Swain as to the \ndistrict court’s intrusion upon the corrections officials’ role, the Valentine court also held \n13 \n1030311\\305803793.v1 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-1            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 20\n \nthat the district court impermissibly enjoined the TDCJ to follow its own laws and \nprocedures. Valentine, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 12941, *9. The terms of the injunction \n“largely overlap[ped] with the TDCJ’s COVID-19 policy requirements and \nrecommendations,” and in the district court’s mind, that “promoted compliance” with \nthose policies. However, an order enjoining a state actor to follow its own laws and \npolicies is prohibited under the eleventh amendment. Id., citing Pennhurst State School & \nHospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 (1984).  \nMoreover, the district court erred in imposing “extra measures” on the TDCJ, \nbeyond what is required by the CDC Guidance, when there was no support for the \nconclusion that the Guidance was not constitutionally adequate. Id.; Roman v. Wolf, 2020 \nU.S. App. LEXIS 14331, *4 (9th Cir., May 5, 2020) (Collins, J., concurring in part and \ndissenting in part) (the district court cannot disregard the CDC’s acknowledgement that \nthe Guidance may be adapted to suit a particular facility’s physical or operational \nlimitations, and proposes reasonable alternatives). Indeed, the appellate court explained \nthat the TDCJ’s “ability to continue to adjust its policies is significantly hampered by the \npreliminary injunction, which locks in place a set of policies for a crisis that defies fixed \napproaches.” Id. at *13. The appellate court found that the TDCJ would be irreparably \nharmed absent a stay of the injunction because it could not respond to the COVID-19 \nthreat without first getting “a permission slip from the district court.” Id.  \nHere, the court’s preliminary injunction order is impermissible on all of these \ngrounds. From the beginning, the Sheriff consulted with leading public health experts \nto ensure the coronavirus response followed the advice of public health officials, while \n14 \n1030311\\305803793.v1 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-1            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 20\n \nalso recognizing the practical realities of operating the Jail. If he is forced to weigh the \nthreat of contempt for possibly violating a term of the injunction while making the daily \ndecisions necessary to safely operate the Jail, the Sheriff will suffer irreparable harm. \nFor example, the Sheriff and his partners must be able to adjust the policies in place at \nthe Jail as the CDC recommendations change, as in the case of changes to the testing \nprotocols. Here, the Court sought to fashion guidelines for social distancing it felt was \nappropriate, not what was actually feasible in the Sheriff’s judgment. While the district \ncourt nodded to the complexity of jail operations generally and the difficulty of \nmanaging the Jail during a global pandemic, those words ring hollow when it imposed \nobligations on the Sheriff that add to these difficulties exponentially. Staffing, detainee \nconduct, population fluctuation, and even the unforeseeable circumstances like the \nevents of last weekend have a pervasive impact on Jail operations, and the Sheriff must \nretain the discretion and flexibility to manage those impacts without seeking a \n“permission slip” from the court. \nIII.  Plaintiffs Will Not Be Harmed in the Absence of a Stay and the Balance \nof Harms Favors the Sheriff  \n \nPlaintiffs will not be irreparably harmed if the injunction is stayed. The question \nis not whether COVID-19 poses a harm, but whether Plaintiffs have shown that they \nwill suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the injunction. Nevertheless, it is \nimportant to highlight that the Sheriff’s policies have dramatically reduced the risk of \ninfection in the Jail. The fourteen-day average COVID-testing positivity rate is now 3% \nof those tested over the past 14 days ending June 3—nearly one-quarter of the rate in \n15 \n1030311\\305803793.v1 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-1            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 20\n \nthe surrounding community.3 This metric represents the ratio of positive cases to the \ntotal number of tests administered to the population. Under World Health Organization \n(WHO) standards, the Sheriff has more than “flattened the curve” inside the Jail; the \nvirus is at the critical containment rate of less than 5% over 14 days.4 (Exh. B, Test \nPositivity Rate Report, June 4, 2020).5 This achievement is noteworthy in and of itself, \nand particularly so in a congregate setting like the Jail. \nIn a recent joint press release issued with Cermak, the Sheriff and his team also \ndocumented that the number of new COVID-19 cases at the Jail has been decreasing \nsteadily over the past four weeks. (Dkt.98-2, ROA2882). As of yesterday, there were \n4,528 detainees in the Jail, 37 of whom are currently COVID-positive, and a total of \n2,452 detainees who have tested negative.6 Notably, the vast majority of the 37 positive \ncases are detainees entering the facility from the community during intake, and not \nspread of the virus among the existing Jail population. (Dkt.98-2, ROA2992).  The \ndistrict court did not mention these impressive data in its order denying the stay, let \nalone consider them in balancing the potential harm of lifting the injunction. \n                                                 \n \n3 https://www.dph.illinois.gov/restore \n4 Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center, \nhttps://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/testing-positivity (last visited June 3, 2020). \n5 This report is an updated version of the document filed in support of the motion for stay in the \ndistrict court. \n6 https://www.cookcountysheriff.org/covid-19-cases-at-ccdoc/; \nhttps://www.cookcountysheriff.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/06/CCSO_BIU_CommunicationsCCDOC_v1_2020_06_04.pdf  \n(last visited June 5, 2020).  \n \n16 \n1030311\\305803793.v1 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-1            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 20\n \nMake no mistake: these successes are a result of the testing and isolation policies \nin effect at the Jail since March, not the injunction, which essentially sought \ndocumentation of existing sanitation and hygienic procedures and to maximize social \ndistancing wherever possible. (See, e.g., Dkt. 109, ROA 2980). While the latter practices \nhave always been part of the Sheriff’s Coronavirus Operation Plan and have long been in \npractice, they are not the driving force behind containment. Since January 24, new \ndetainees entering the Jail have been screened for coronavirus symptoms. On March 14, \nnew detainees were being quarantined at intake before they could enter the general \npopulation. On March 20, Cermak was approved to administer testing in a non-hospital \nsetting, and began testing immediately on approval. On March 23, COVID-positive \ndetainees began being housed in medical isolation and the remainder of the detainee’s \ntier was quarantined. On March 26, the Sheriff began converting every available cell \nfrom double-celled to single-celled, and moved detainees to dormitories in previously-\nclosed divisions of the Jail, to enhance social distancing strategies. (Dkt.87-1, ROA2668-\n79). Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on April 3. The injunction was entered on April 27. \nThere has never been an allegation, let alone evidence, that the Sheriff is likely to \nstop the practices that have led to these results, and any suggestion to the contrary is \npurely speculative. As the district court has repeatedly recognized, “it cannot \nreasonably be disputed” that the Sheriff has undertaken “significant and impressive” \nefforts to control the spread of the virus in the Jail, and that he has always “acted in \ngood faith, with the goal of protecting the people in his custody” in doing so. (Dkt. 73, \nROA 1989). To now casually conclude, as the district court did, that staying the \n17 \n1030311\\305803793.v1 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-1            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 20\n \ninjunction would “permit the Sheriff to lift [coronavirus-protective] measures” and \n“place the health of detained persons at serious risk,” absent any actual allegation or \nevidence, is unfounded. (Dkt. 109, ROA 2985).  \nGiven the impressive data showing the success of the Sheriff’s policies, there is \nno likelihood that he will discontinue these procedures and jeopardize these highly \nsuccessful results. The Sheriff has invested heavily in these procedures, which were \nwell-researched, well-designed, and well-supported in consultation with public health \nagencies and retained experts and grounded in the CDC Guidance. The Sheriff has and \nwill continue “in good faith” to implement these policies, as he has done for months. \nGiven the success of the Sheriff’s policies, and the confidence that they will continue to \nbe implemented, the balance of harms weighs in favor of a stay to release the Sheriff \nfrom the bonds of the Court’s oversight as “super-warden.”  \nAs to the public’s interest, where the government is the party opposing the \npreliminary injunction, its interest and harm merge with the public interest. Nken v. \nHolder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). As discussed above, the Sheriff and the public interest \nwill suffer irreparable harm if he must compromise the safe and efficient operation of \nthe Jail to comply with ill-informed, if well-meaning, obligations under threat of \ncontempt. Thus, it is in the best interest of all to stay enforcement of the injunction \npending appeal. \n \n   \n18 \n1030311\\305803793.v1 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-1            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 20\n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Sheriff Dart respectfully requests that the Court stay \nenforcement of the preliminary injunction and all other discovery pending resolution of \nthe appeal from the preliminary injunction order. \n \nRobert T.

KENNELLY, District Judge, as emergency judge: \n  On April 27, 2020, the Court granted in part the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary \ninjunction in this class action lawsuit regarding conditions at the Cook County Jail, \nordering some of the relief sought by the plaintiffs but denying a number of their \nrequests.  See Mays v. Dart, No. 20 C 2134, 2020 WL 1987007 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 27, 2020) \n(\"Mays 2\").  The preliminary injunction tracked a temporary restraining order entered \nabout three weeks earlier but included one additional requirement.  See Mays v. Dart, \nNo. 20 C 2134, 2020 WL 1812381 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 9, 2020) (\"Mays 1\").   \n  The preliminary injunction also directed the Sheriff of Cook County—the \ndefendant in the case—to submit a report regarding compliance.  The Sheriff did this on \nMay 1, 2020.  On May 6, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a response to the Sheriff's report in \nwhich they sought expedited discovery, contending they needed this to determine \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 2 of 12 PageID #:2977\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-3            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 12\ncompliance with the preliminary injunction.  On May 11, the Sheriff objected and moved \nto strike the request for expedited discovery.  Also on May 11, the Sheriff filed a notice \nof appeal from the preliminary injunction.  Eight days after that, on May 19—a little over \nthree weeks after entry of the preliminary injunction—the Sheriff moved for a stay \npending appeal and repeated his request to strike the plaintiffs' proposed expedited \ndiscovery requests.  At the request of the judge assigned to the case, the undersigned \njudge, acting as emergency judge, directed the plaintiffs to respond to the stay motion \nthe next day and heard argument on the Sheriff's stay motion as well as the plaintiffs' \nexpedited discovery request on May 21, 2020. \n  For the reasons stated below, the Court denies the Sheriff's motion to stay the \npreliminary injunction pending appeal and also denies the plaintiffs' request for \nexpedited discovery. \nDiscussion \n  Familiarity with the Court's temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction \ndecisions is assumed.  The plaintiffs in this case contend that the Sheriff is violating the \nFourteenth Amendment due process rights of persons detained at the Jail by failing to \nprovide them with reasonably safe living conditions in the face of the coronavirus \npandemic.  In their motion for a preliminary injunction (as in their TRO motion), the \nplaintiffs sought wide-ranging relief.  This included mandatory social distancing of \ndetained persons throughout the Jail—relief that would amount to universal single-\ncelling and then some; transfer of detained persons to electronic home monitoring; and \nconvening a three-judge court under the Prison Litigation Reform Act to consider the \nrelease of detained persons.  The plaintiffs also sought measures to identify and \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 3 of 12 PageID #:2978\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-3            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 12\nseparate medically vulnerable detained persons and to require coronavirus testing, \ncleaning of Jail facilities, and provision of personal protective equipment. \n  After extensive briefing and hearings, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motions, \nbut only in part.  The Court entered a TRO including certain requirements on April 9 and \na preliminary injunction with those same requirements plus one more on April 27.  On \nboth occasions, however, the Court overruled the plaintiffs' requests for sweeping \nremedies, declining their requests to release detainees with medical vulnerabilities, \nmandate full \"social distancing\" throughout the jail, and convene a three-judge court to \nprisoner releases. \n  The Sheriff has moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal, and \nplaintiffs have moved for expedited discovery to assess the Sheriff's compliance with \nthe injunction.  The Court addresses each request in turn. \n1.  Stay pending appeal \n  In deciding whether to stay an order pending appeal, a court considers whether \nthe movant \"has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits\"; \nwhether the movant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; whether a stay \"will \nsubstantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding\"; and \"where the public \ninterest lies.\"  Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987). \n  a.  Movant's likelihood of success \n  The Sheriff has not made a \"strong showing\" of likelihood of success.  The \nrecord before the Court when it issued the preliminary injunction reflected that the \npeople detained at the Jail faced a real and persistent danger to their health.  As of April \n9, when the Court issued a temporary restraining order that embodied most of the relief \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 4 of 12 PageID #:2979\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-3            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 12\nextended via the preliminary injunction, the Jail had the largest single concentration of \nconfirmed coronavirus infections in the entire country.  See Mays 1, 2020 WL 1812381, \nat *2.  At the time of the preliminary injunction, although the number of positive-tested \ndetained persons in isolation had declined, the overall positive test numbers were \ncontinuing to increase (350 on April 17 vs. 289 on April 10), indicating that the virus was \ncontinuing to spread within the Jail.  See Def.'s Resp. to Pls.' Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 2-3.  \nBefore the issuance of the TRO and the preliminary injunction, the Sheriff had, \nundeniably, taken steps to attempt to stem the spread of the virus.  But the Constitution \ndoes not say that so long as a jailer does something, he complies with constitutional \nobligations.  Rather, if jailer does not take objectively reasonable steps to protect \ndetained persons from a known and serious risk, he violates the Fourteenth \nAmendment.  The Court concluded that plaintiffs had established a reasonable \nlikelihood of showing the objective unreasonableness of some of the Sheriff's actions or \ninaction. \n  In seeking a stay of the preliminary injunction, the Sheriff contends that he has \nconsistently acted in good faith, and the Court does not dispute this.  But the Sheriff's \nintent was not and is not the issue.  The law in this Circuit is clear that conditions of \nconfinement cases involving pretrial detainees are judged by a standard of objective \nreasonableness, not by assessing whether the Sheriff had good or bad intentions.  See, \ne.g., Hardeman v. Curran, 933 F.3d 816, 823-24 (7th Cir. 2019).  The Court notes that \nin this regard, this case is nothing like two cases cited by the Sheriff in his motion to \nstay, in which appellate courts granted stays of coronavirus-related preliminary \ninjunctions.  See Swain v. Junior, 958 F.3d 1051 (11th Cir. 2020); Valentine v. Collier, \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 5 of 12 PageID #:2980\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-3            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 12\n956 F.3d 797 (11th Cir. 2020).  The courts in those cases found a significant likelihood \nof success on the part of the jailer largely due to the absence of evidence that the jailer \nexhibited the intent required by those Circuits, specifically, deliberate indifference.  That \nis not the standard that applies in this Circuit or in this case.  The Sheriff may not have \nexhibited deliberate indifference, but that is not the same as saying that his actions or \ninaction were objectively reasonable.   \n  The Sheriff also contends that his approach has worked, citing decreases in the \nincidence of new coronavirus cases at the Jail over the last several weeks.  There are at \nleast two problems with this argument.  First, it amounts to 20/20 hindsight.  The Court \nruled, and had to rule, based on the record as it was presented at the time, not based \non how things turned out several weeks later.  Second, the TRO and preliminary \ninjunction directed the Sheriff to take steps he was not already taking or was not taking \nin an effective way.  In particular, the Court's orders directed the Sheriff to do the \nfollowing: \n•  cease the use of crowded \"bullpens\" holding multiple detained persons at intake; \n•  (on the preliminary injunction) enforce social distancing in most of the Jail; \n•  obtain and distribute facemasks to persons exposed to infected or quarantined \ndetainees; \n•  establish a Sheriff's Office policy to implement prompt testing for detained \npersons exhibiting symptoms of coronavirus disease; \n•  enable actual, not just theoretical, access to adequate sanitation supplies; and \n•  actually enforce cleaning and sanitation requirements in areas of the Jail \naccessed in common, such as showers, bathrooms, and day rooms. \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 6 of 12 PageID #:2981\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-3            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 12\nThe Sheriff's argument about positive results does not account for the very real \npossibility that the measures ordered by the Court at the TRO and preliminary injunction \nstage contributed to those results. \n  On the merits, the Sheriff's primary argument appears to be that guidelines for \nprison and jail administrators issued by the Centers for Disease Control are \ndeterminative of the question of objective reasonableness and that he has consistently \ncomplied with them.  This contention likewise has at least two flaws.  First, the Sheriff \nhas cited no authority establishing that an externally-created set of guidelines like these \namounts to a constitutional measuring stick.  Rather, the law in this Circuit is that such \nguidelines are relevant in determining objective reasonableness, but not determinative.  \nSee, e.g., United States v. Brown, 871 F.3d 532, 538 (7th Cir. 2017); Thompson v. City \nof Chicago, 472 F.3d 444, 454 (7th Cir. 1996).  In the respect most pertinent to this \ncase, the CDC guidelines set a feasibility or practicality limitation that, the Court \nconcluded, could not be determinative of the constitutional question presented by \nplaintiffs' claims.  Second, and perhaps just as importantly, the record established that \nthe Jail had not yet reached feasibility limitations regarding the spacing of detained \npersons:  the Jail's executive director so testified at the preliminary injunction hearing, \nindicating that the Jail had additional space that could be used to further spread out \ndetainees.  Thus the record reflected that the Sheriff's practices in this particular respect \ndid not measure up to the CDC guidelines. \n  Next, contrary to the Sheriff's contention, the Court did not fail to give appropriate \ndeference to the Sheriff's expertise or his interest in appropriate management of the \nJail.  To the contrary, the Court did exactly what the law requires.  See Mays 2, 2020 \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 7 of 12 PageID #:2982\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-3            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 12\nWL 1987007, at *27 (citing Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2073 (2015); Bell \nv. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547 (1979)).  Indeed, the Court rejected, both at the TRO and \npreliminary injunction stages, much—in fact most—of the relief sought by plaintiffs.  \nSpecifically, the Court declined to: \n•  order the Sheriff to identify and triage detained persons believed to be medically \nvulnerable; \n•  relocate vulnerable detainees to custodial (and perhaps non-custodial) locations \nother than the Jail; \n•  mandate full social distancing throughout the Jail; \n•  distribute personal protective equipment to every detained person; \n•  institute a robust program of coronavirus testing of all detainees throughout the \nJail; and \n•  convene a three-judge court to consider releasing detained persons from the Jail.  \nOn each of these points, the Court either found that plaintiffs were unlikely to be able to \nshow the Sheriff's actions were objectively unreasonable, or deferred to the Sheriff's \nexpertise and discretion, or both. \n  One certainly understand why, as a strategic matter, the Sheriff's motion for a \nstay omits any reference to what the Court did not order.  But a look at the full picture \nconfirms that the Court followed a careful and restrained approach, honoring both the \nconstitutional entitlement of detained persons to reasonable measures to protect their \nphysical health and the Sheriff's legitimate interest in maintaining security, preserving \norder, and making discretionary determinations regarding allocation of resources.  The \nlaw is clear that a court must consider both.  The Supreme Court has stated that \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 8 of 12 PageID #:2983\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-3            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 12\nalthough courts must be \"sensitive to . . . the need for deference to experienced and \nexpert prison administrators,\" they \"nevertheless must not shrink from their obligation to \n“enforce the constitutional rights of all persons, including prisoners.  Courts may not \nallow constitutional violations to continue simply because a remedy would involve \nintrusion into the realm of prison administration.\"  Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 492, 511 \n(2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \n  In sum, the Court concludes that the Sheriff has not shown, let along \"strongly\" \nshown, that he is likely to succeed on appeal.  \n  b.  Irreparable injury to movant \n  The Sheriff's argument regarding irreparable injury likewise falls short.  In fact, \nthe Sheriff's position on this point is internally inconsistent.  One the one hand, he \ncontends that the Court has \"undermine[d]\" his \"thoughtful and reasonable\" approach to \nthe coronavirus pandemic as it affects the Jail.  Def.'s Mot. to Stay at 13.  On the other \nhand, he contends that the Court has essentially ordered him to do what he was already \ndoing, id. at 12, thereby inserting itself as an unnecessary watchdog.  Both cannot be \ntrue at the same time.  The fact is that the Court has done neither.  The Court observes, \nthough, that it is difficult to see how the Sheriff will experience \"irreparable harm\" if he \nhas to comply with the injunction by doing what he says he would do anyway. \n  The Sheriff says that the additional burden imposed by court oversight amounts \nto irreparable harm.  The upshot of this argument, however, is that any party appealing \nan injunction would automatically meet the irreparable harm requirement for a stay—\nbecause an injunction is, after all, an injunction.  This cannot be the case.  That aside, \nthe Court has not imposed any monitoring requirements beyond the initial compliance \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 9 of 12 PageID #:2984\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-3            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 12\nreport, which the Sheriff filed over three weeks ago and thus which cannot possibly \nconstitute irreparable harm.  The Court declined plaintiffs' requests to appoint outside \nmonitors and to permit inspections of the Jail's facilities.  \n  Finally, at argument, the Sheriff's counsel seemed to suggest that the fact that \nthe plaintiffs had served discovery requests and were thereby trying to, in effect, stick \ntheir noses into his operations and decision-making amounts to irreparable harm.  This \ncannot be the case either.  Again, as the Sheriff's counsel conceded, a case does not \nend with a preliminary injunction; it is commonplace for discovery to proceed in a lawsuit \neven after a preliminary injunction is issued.  So dealing with discovery requests cannot \npossibly constitute irreparable harm either.  (Regardless, as discussed below, the Court \nis relieving the Sheriff of the burden of responding to plaintiffs' discovery requests at this \ntime).    \n  Last but not least on the question of irreparable harm, it is noteworthy that the \nSheriff waited more than three weeks after the issuance of the preliminary injunction \nbefore moving for a stay.  This cuts against the contention that the Sheriff has \nexperienced, or will experience, much harm at all, let alone harm appropriately \nconsidered to be irreparable.1  \n   \n                                            \n1 It may be that the Sheriff's real concern involves the potential for future problems \nshould increased population at the Jail limit his ability to comply with social distancing \nrequirements.  On this, though, it is worth noting that the Court specifically invited the \nSheriff to make a request to include certain at-risk detainees among those who may be \nappropriately detained in group housing, see Mays 2, 2020 WL 1987007, at *34, and to \nreturn to court to loosen the preliminary injunction's requirements if changed \ncircumstances call for it, see id. at *37.  The Sheriff has not taken the Court up on either \ninvitation. \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 10 of 12 PageID #:2985\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-3            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 12\n  c.  Injury to parties other than movant \n  The next question is whether a stay will risk substantial injury to other interested \nparties, specifically to the plaintiff class.  This is essentially the flip side of the point just \naddressed.  The Sheriff did not voluntarily take all of the coronavirus-protective \nmeasures that he cites.  Some were done pursuant to court order—either the TRO, or \nthe preliminary injunction, or both.  Staying the injunction would permit the Sheriff to lift  \nmeasures and thereby again place the health of detained persons at serious risk.  That \nrisk cannot be discounted based on the Sheriff's assurances alone.  Again, a number of \nthe measures he took were instituted only after the Court's TRO or preliminary \ninjunction.  See Mays 2, 2020 WL 1987007, at *29.  The Court finds that there is at least \nsome risk of substantial injury to detained persons if the preliminary injunction is stayed.   \n  d.  The public interest \n  On the question of the public interest, the Sheriff cites Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. \n418, 435 (2009), for the proposition that the Sheriff, as a public official, effectively \nembodies the public interest.  See Def.'s Mot. to Stay at 19.  It is not quite that simple.  \nHere the Sheriff is charged with protecting not just the public at large, but also the \ndetained persons placed in his custody, all or nearly all of whom have family members \non the outside.  Their interests are part of the public interest.  And the detained persons' \nconstitutional rights—and their health and lives—are at stake.  It is anything but clear \nthat the Sheriff can claim the public interest mantle entirely for himself.   \n  For the reasons described, the Court concludes that the Sheriff has not met the \nrequirements for a stay of the preliminary injunction.  The Court therefore denies his \nmotion to stay.   \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 11 of 12 PageID #:2986\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-3            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 12\n2.  Plaintiffs' request for expedited discovery \n  As the Court indicated earlier, and as the Sheriff's counsel conceded at \nargument, the appeal of a preliminary injunction does not require the rest of the case to \ncome to a halt in the district court.  Put another way, a preliminary injunction is not the \nfinal resolution of a case.  It follows that a party who is preliminarily enjoined is not \nrelieved of the obligation to provide discovery in response to appropriate requests.  In \naddition, as the Sheriff likewise conceded at argument, an appeal does not prevent the \ndistrict court from enforcing a preliminary injunction.  See, e.g., Union Oil Co. of Calif. v. \nLeavell, 220 F.3d 562, 565-66 (7th Cir. 2000). \n  Plaintiffs' discovery requests, they say, are aimed at determining compliance.  \nThis is plainly not the case for all of them; some involve matters beyond the relief the \nCourt ordered in the injunction.  But this does not make those particular requests \ninappropriate.  They are within the realm of permissible discovery for the ongoing \nlitigation of the case—which, again, does not end with the issuance of a preliminary \ninjunction.   The same is true of the plaintiffs' other requests; all of them appear to be \nwithin the scope of permissible discovery under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n26(b)(1).   \n  Defendants say that the Court should, and perhaps must, put the brakes on the \nplaintiffs' requested discovery because of the appeal.  The question of whether and to \nwhat extent plaintiffs may engage in discovery, however, is not an emergency issue \nwithin the scope of the undersigned judge's role as emergency judge.  The only aspect \nthat is urgent is the request for expedited discovery; that is what the undersigned judge \ntook on when requested by the assigned judge to handle the motions for a stay and for \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 12 of 12 PageID #:2987\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-3            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 12\nexpedited discovery. \n  All of that aside, the Court concludes that the expedited discovery requests have \nnot been properly served.  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 26(d), a party \n\"may not seek discovery\" before the parties have conferred under Rule 26(f) or unless \nauthorized by the Rules, a stipulation, or a court order.  None of this has happened in \nthis case.  In particular, at the time the discovery had been served there had been no \nRule 26(f) conference.   \n  For these reasons, the Court directs that the Sheriff need not answer plaintiffs' \ncurrent discovery requests.  At the conclusion of the oral argument on the present \nmotions on May 21, the Court directed the parties to submit a proposed scheduling \norder to the assigned judge by June 2, 2020 and to conduct their Rule 26(f) conference \nbefore that.   Plaintiffs may re-serve their discovery requests following the Rule 26(f) \nconference and may, if appropriate, move the assigned judge to permit expedited \ndiscovery.  \nConclusion \n  For the reasons stated above, the Court denies defendant's motion to stay the \npreliminary injunction pending appeal [dkt. no. 98] and denies plaintiffs' motion for \nexpedited discovery [dkt. no. 85]. \nDate:  May 29, 2020 \n              ________________________________ \n                MATTHEW F.

Thomas Dart. \n4 THE COURT:  All right.  So I think it will be helpful \n5 if maybe just one of the lawyers for the plaintiff can give \n6 the names of all the lawyers who are on the video for the \n7 plaintiffs.  \n8 MS. VAN BRUNT:  Sure, your Honor.  I am happy to do \n9 that.  \n10 This is Alexa Van Brunt, V-a-n B-r-u-n-t.  Also on \n11 for plaintiffs are Sarah Grady, G-r-a-d-y, and Locke Bowman, \n12 B-o-w-m-a-n.  \n13 THE COURT:  And defense counsel?  You have to unmute.  \n14 MR. SHANNON:  Your Honor, Robert Shannon on behalf of \n15 defendant.  With me is Jim Lydon, our paralegal, Lisa Plaza.  \n16 Your Honor, I also wanted to let you know that Ms. \n17 Sperry is leading a panel presentation and she will be here \n18 stepping in at 1:30.  We did not want to have to continue or \n19 delay the start of this, but it is my hope pending any \n20 (technical difficulties). \n21 THE COURT REPORTER:  You're breaking up. \n22 THE COURT:  So here's the problem.  \n23 You know, these video conferencing things, and maybe \n24 we don't have the best one in the world, they don't really \n25 expect that people are going to be using them over \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n4\n1 speakerphones like you're doing.  So we are getting -- I am \n2 hearing basically about a third of what you are saying, and \n3 the same is true of the court reporter.  I can tell from her \n4 body language.  \n5 And so I didn't get -- I heard you say something \n6 about 1:30, but that's about all I could hear.  \n7 MR. SHANNON:  Can you hear me better now, your Honor?  \n8 THE COURT:  That's less feedback than the \n9 speakerphone was.  Okay.  \n10 MR. SHANNON:  Should I identify counsel for the \n11 defendants again?  \n12 THE COURT:  Please do. \n13 MR. SHANNON:  Robert Shannon on behalf of defendant.  \n14 With me is Jim Lydon.  In the room is our paralegal, Lisa \n15 Plaza.  \n16 Ms. Gretchen Sperry is completing a panel, a CLE \n17 presentation, and she will be joining the room at \n18 approximately 1:30. \n19 THE COURT:  Ah, that was the 1:30 thing.  I've got to \n20 step away and grab something.  \n21 So I actually -- so I've read everything that was \n22 submitted.  Sorry.  This is the clerk calling me.  I have to \n23 take this.  \n24 Sorry.  Give me a second.  \n25 (Brief interruption.) \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n5\n1 THE COURT:  Okay.  So I actually want to start off \n2 with some questions.  And I am going to start off with \n3 questions I have starting off with for defense counsel.  \n4 Does -- if the judge issues a preliminary injunction \n5 and the preliminary injunction gets appealed, does that \n6 deprive the district court of jurisdiction to deal with the \n7 rest of the case?  \n8 That's the question. \n9 MR. SHANNON:  This is Robert Shannon, your Honor.\n10 THE COURT:   That's all coming from you guys.  I'm \n11 just telling you.  All that whistling and feedback, all this \n12 feedback is coming from you guys.  \n13 You would be way better off doing this in front of \n14 your own screen at a computer somewhere.\n15 (Technical difficulties.)\n16 THE COURT:  Did you hear my question, Mr. Shannon?\n17 MR. SHANNON:  Yes, your first one or the second one, \n18 Judge?  \n19 THE COURT:  Well, the second one is why the heck \n20 aren't you doing this off of a computer?  \n21 My first question is does an appeal -- if the judge \n22 issues a preliminary injunction and the party who has been \n23 enjoined appeals the preliminary injunction, does that deprive \n24 the district judge of jurisdiction over the rest of the case?\n25 (Technical difficulties.) \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n6\n1 THE COURT:  Okay.  So we are going to -- you know, \n2 this is all coming from the conference people.  \n3 MR. SHANNON:  Judge, we are going to call.  Give us \n4 one moment. \n5 (Brief interruption.) \n6 THE COURT:  I am just waiting for some sort of a \n7 thumb's up or something from the Hinshaw table so that you've \n8 got your act together so we can hear you.  \n9 MR. SHANNON:  Your Honor, is this any better?  \n10 THE COURT:  That's better.  On that one, I am only \n11 hearing it twice, as opposed to ten times, so I guess that's \n12 better. \n13 MR. SHANNON:  Okay.  Now we should be fine.  Is that \n14 correct? \n15 THE COURT:  Yes, now you're fine.  Now you're fine.  \n16 Okay.  Answer my question, please. \n17 MR. SHANNON:  Can you hear me, your Honor?  \n18 Okay.  Thumbs up.  \n19 Okay.  Your Honor, I may, with your Honor's \n20 permission, ask Ms. Sperry to expand on this when she joins, \n21 but I think the answer to your question is that the district \n22 court does not lose jurisdiction for the permanent injunction, \n23 but loses any issues involved in the appeal.  \n24 Here what is somewhat unique -- \n25 THE COURT:  No, you just answered my question.  No, \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n7\n1 stop.  \n2 So look, Mr. Shannon, with due respect, you just \n3 wasted ten minutes of my time.  Okay?  So you answered my \n4 question.  Now I am going to ask another one.  I will give you \n5 a chance to say whatever you want to say in a minute.  I have \n6 got, like, 30 pages of briefs from you guys.  I've got \n7 questions.  I am going to get them answered, and I am going to \n8 get those questions answered and that's it.  \n9 So let's say a preliminary injunction gets appealed \n10 and somebody wants to do discovery toward the question of \n11 whether they should ask for a permanent injunction and, you \n12 know, what they need to prove their claims.  \n13 Does the district judge have the authority to deal \n14 with issues about that?  \n15 MR. SHANNON:  Not if -- not if it is related to the \n16 appeal on the preliminary injunction, your Honor. \n17 THE COURT:  So I'll just tell you that one of the -- \n18 one thing I can tell you is that there is no case that you've \n19 cited -- there is no case that you've cited in any of your \n20 materials that says anything close to that.  \n21 So what's your authority?  What's the case that says \n22 what you just told me?  \n23 And I'm going to tell you I've been a lawyer for 39 \n24 years, okay?  Unless this has changed in the last two weeks, \n25 what you just said is just wrong.  So tell me the case that \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n8\n1 says it.  \n2 MR. SHANNON:  It would only be in our brief, your \n3 Honor, and I will have Ms. Sperry, when she arrives, respond \n4 in any way that you are comfortable with, but I think what is \n5 unique about this particular case is that the threshold issue \n6 is that while plaintiffs may take the position that the \n7 district court could retain jurisdiction over discovery, \n8 quote/unquote discovery requests that were pending in advance \n9 of the notice of appeal, that is not the case here because \n10 those discovery requests, as we have set forth in our briefs, \n11 were legally and procedurally defective. \n12 THE COURT:  Yeah, so the problem with what you just \n13 said is that what that means, the upshot of that is that if a \n14 preliminary injunction gets appealed, the case has to come to \n15 a grinding halt, which is contrary to, like I said, the last \n16 39 years I've been practicing law, unless something has \n17 changed in the past couple of weeks.  \n18 So let's just talk about an ordinary commercial, \n19 okay?  Let's say you have a standard agreement not to compete.  \n20 Plaintiff comes in and says the employee left, he's violating \n21 the covenant not to compete, he's soliciting customers, he's \n22 doing this, he's doing that.  The judge issues a preliminary \n23 injunction.  The employee who is a defendant in the case \n24 appeals the preliminary injunction.  Okay.  So there is a \n25 preliminary injunction in place, but that's not the end of the \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n9\n1 case because a preliminary injunction is, by definition, \n2 preliminary.  \n3 And so now the plaintiff says, okay, I want to get \n4 more details about this.  I want to find out who all the \n5 customers are that this person dealt with.  I want to know \n6 what he said to them.  I want to know, you know, what sales he \n7 made to them.  So they start sending out discovery requests.  \n8 From what you just told me, they can't do that and \n9 the district judge would have to prevent them from doing that, \n10 which is just absolute poppycock, and that's about the nicest \n11 way I can put it.  \n12 So what's the case that says that?  \n13 MR. SHANNON:  Well, your Honor, they're asking for \n14 emergency discovery, and as we've identified under an \n15 effective procedural mechanism, and I guess it feeds into the \n16 elements on the motion to stay, right?  I mean, that would be \n17 the analysis.  \n18 THE COURT:  Okay.  So just as a person who makes \n19 decisions for a living, just a little practice point here.  \n20 When somebody doesn't answer questions, that -- and they don't \n21 do it after the second try, that usually tells the \n22 decisionmaker that a truthful answer would not be good for the \n23 person who is answering the question.  \n24 MR. SHANNON:  Your Honor, I am not -- \n25 THE COURT:  So let me get to my next question.  \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n10\n1 Does an appeal from a preliminary injunction preclude \n2 the district court from enforcing the preliminary injunction \n3 if it's not stayed?  Yes or no?  \n4 MR. SHANNON:  Well, I would say, your Honor, only if \n5 a proper motion is filed, and that has not occurred.  That was \n6 one of our points.  If there was a rule to -- \n7 THE COURT:  Don't add facts to my question.  I'm \n8 asking the question in the way I'm asking it because that's \n9 the way I want it answered.  \n10 Does an appeal of a preliminary injunction that \n11 hasn't been stayed preclude the district court from enforcing \n12 it?  \n13 MR. SHANNON:  Your Honor, what we argue in our brief \n14 is that it's -- the district court is divested of jurisdiction \n15 while the matter is up on appeal.  \n16 THE COURT:  Okay.  Is that a yes to my question, or \n17 is it a no?  \n18 MR. SHANNON:  I'm losing track of the double \n19 negatives, your Honor.  \n20 THE COURT:  It wasn't a double negative in the \n21 question.  \n22 So, look, you've got to listen carefully this time.  \n23 And this is going to be your last opportunity to answer \n24 questions.  If I get an evasive answer again, which is what \n25 you've been giving me, then I am just going to talk to \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n11\n1 somebody else from now on.  \n2 Does an appeal by a dis- -- \n3   UNIDENTIFIED VOICE:  I thought that -- \n4 THE COURT:  Whoever is talking, shut up.  \n5 Does an appeal of a preliminary injunction that has \n6 not been stayed preclude the district court from enforcing the \n7 preliminary injunction?  Yes or no?  \n8 MR. SHANNON:  Your Honor, Ms. Sperry has arrived.  \n9 Can I please ask her to respond to your question? \n10 THE COURT:  I just want somebody to answer the damned \n11 thing.  You're wasting my time by even doing that.  Answer the \n12 question, for crying out loud. \n13 MS. SPERRY:  The Court can enforce the injunction -- \n14 THE COURT:  I want a yes or I want a no.  I want a \n15 yes or I want a no. \n16 MS. SPERRY:  Yes. \n17 THE COURT:  Okay.  So I can enforce it.  Okay.  So \n18 that's my first question.  \n19 So now I've got Ms. Sperry in the room.  I am going \n20 to ask the question that Mr. Shannon wasn't answering before.  \n21 Does an appeal from a preliminary injunction deprive \n22 the district court of jurisdiction over the rest of the case?  \n23 Yes or no?  \n24 MS. SPERRY:  The rest of the case?  \n25 THE COURT:  Right.  \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n12\n1 MS. SPERRY:  No.  \n2 THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.  \n3 MS. SPERRY:  The underlying complaint. \n4 THE COURT:  And both of those answers, by the way, \n5 are consistent with my understanding of the law.  \n6 Okay.  So now I am going to get to my third question.  \n7 I don't care who answers this, and you don't have to \n8 preface it by can I permit this person to answer?  I don't \n9 care who answers it.  I just want somebody to answer it, okay? \n10 So depending upon how I read the defendant's last \n11 brief, I'm not sure what your answer is to this question, \n12 which is why I'm asking it.  A party who is a beneficiary of a \n13 preliminary injunction and who claims it's been violated, are \n14 they entitled to get discovery to try to find out if it's been \n15 violated?  \n16 MS. SPERRY:  Not if it has not been ordered by the \n17 court as part of the preliminary injunction motion to monitor \n18 compliance. \n19 THE COURT:  So you have to get leave of court to just \n20 send out discovery requests?  \n21 MS. SPERRY:  If it has not been -- \n22 THE COURT:  Why would that be?\n23 MS. SPERRY:  In other cases, if the Court, as part of \n24 its preliminary injunction order, has permitted the parties to \n25 continue discovery for purposes of monitoring compliance, that \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n13\n1 may be the case.  It is not the case here. \n2 THE COURT:  Time out.  So what's the provision in the \n3 Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that says that a party has to \n4 get leave of court to just serve discovery.  I'm not talking \n5 about expedited.  I'm just talking about regular discovery.  \n6 Let's just say that the plaintiffs have sent you, \n7 which by the way, they should have on May the 6th, they just \n8 sent you these discovery requests.  Said, here's our discovery \n9 requests under Rule 34 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n10 Here's our request for production of documents, please answer \n11 these.  \n12 Would there be something wrong with that?  You don't \n13 have to get leave of court to serve a Rule 34 request, do you?  \n14 MS. SPERRY:  Here, I think, is the distinction, your \n15 Honor.  They can serve discovery requests with respect to the \n16 complaint itself in pursuit of the underlying case in the \n17 trial moving toward a permanent injunction perhaps.  \n18 But with respect to monitoring compliance, unless \n19 it's specifically ordered by the court, our view is that there \n20 is no inherent right to pursue discovery if it's not ordered \n21 by court.  \n22 THE COURT:  Okay.  So I -- \n23 MS. SPERRY:  For compliance. \n24 THE COURT:  I got your briefs in front of me here.  \n25 So point -- tell me the page that has the case or cases on it \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n14\n1 that say that or the rule or whatever it is.  Where do I find \n2 this in the brief?  \n3 MS. SPERRY:  Bear with me, Judge.  I'm just getting \n4 my bearings here.  \n5 Oh, so the case of Bradford-Scott Data Corp. vs. -- \n6 THE COURT:  What page of what brief?  \n7 MS. SPERRY:  Page 6 of the defendant's motion to \n8 stay.  \n9 THE COURT:  Okay.  Hang on a second.  This is the \n10 last thing, right?  \n11 MS. SPERRY:  Correct, document 98-1.  \n12 THE COURT:  I'm there.  Page 6.  Go ahead. \n13 MS. SPERRY:  Sure.  \n14 So the case of Bradford-Scott Data Corp. v. Physician \n15 Computer Network provides, and Griggs that it cites to, \n16 provides that the Court has jurisdiction over the remaining \n17 aspects of the case that are not on appeal.  \n18 There is -- but as far as monitoring compliance that \n19 is separate from and is part of the preliminary -- well, the \n20 order is part of the preliminary injunction order.  \n21 So if the party wanted to pursue, as I said, the \n22 underlying complaint and proceed through the normal channels \n23 of discovery, pursuing the permanent injunction perhaps on the \n24 complaint that remains, that would be different and that \n25 certainly is not the character of the discovery requests that \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n15\n1 were issued here that purportedly are to monitor compliance, \n2 although, as you note from the filings, it goes far beyond \n3 what the Court actually ordered in the injunction itself.  \n4 THE COURT:  Okay.  So what you're telling me is that \n5 this Bradford whatever it is, Bradford hyphen something, this \n6 Bradford-Scott case says that you can't do discovery that \n7 amounts to trying to monitor compliance with a preliminary \n8 injunction and I think you said before unless the judge lets \n9 you.  \n10 MS. SPERRY:  So in -- so Bradford-Scott says that the \n11 Court loses -- the district court loses jurisdiction over all \n12 aspects of the injunction that are on appeal with the \n13 exception of any of the underlying proceedings on the original \n14 complaint.  The cases, for example, on page 7 of the brief, \n15 Perfecseal v. Heezen and the other cases cited by the \n16 plaintiffs, in those cases the ability to monitor, \n17 quote/unquote monitor, but the ability to pursue discovery \n18 with respect to compliance with the injunction was \n19 specifically ordered as part of the injunction order in those \n20 cases, which isn't the case here.  And that the Court opted \n21 for the status report avenue of ensuring compliance.  \n22 THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.  But you said a few \n23 minutes ago that -- I think you said a few minutes ago that \n24 the district court retains the ability to enforce the \n25 preliminary injunction even if it's on appeal if it's not \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n16\n1 stayed, right?  \n2 MS. SPERRY:  If it's not stayed, the Court -- the \n3 Court does have the ability to enforce it if it isn't stayed, \n4 that's true.  That, in our view, does not entitle the other \n5 side to discovery upon it. \n6 THE COURT:  Okay.  So are you saying, basically, that \n7 because there isn't something in the preliminary injunction \n8 that says you're entitled to do discovery, to do it, it's too \n9 late to change that now?  \n10 MS. SPERRY:  That's our view, yes. \n11 THE COURT:  Huh, okay.  \n12 And your position is is that none of these discovery \n13 requests that you've been served with here has anything to do \n14 with what I call the rest of the case, in other words, whether \n15 the plaintiffs ought to be able to get a permanent injunction?  \n16 Is that -- \n17 MS. SPERRY:  I'm sorry.  I'm thinking.  \n18 In our view, no, not as presented, no.  \n19 THE COURT:  Okay.  Because actually your argument \n20 kind of is that they are because you make the point on some of \n21 these requests that they go beyond what the preliminary \n22 injunction says.  So it can't involve the preliminary \n23 injunction, it must involve the rest of the case.  \n24 MS. SPERRY:  Well, they involve things that go beyond \n25 what the Court had ordered.  I guess -- \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n17\n1 THE COURT:  I understand, but that means they involve \n2 the rest of the case.  I mean, my point is that your position \n3 kind of runs headlong into itself when it turns the corner. \n4 MS. SPERRY:  I understand what you're saying.  I \n5 understand the distinction that you're making, and perhaps \n6 Mr. Shannon has a better view, if you don't mind, your Honor.  \n7 MR. SHANNON:  Judge, can I add to the response, your \n8 Honor?  \n9 THE COURT:  You can do it quickly, yeah, and \n10 responsively. \n11 MR. SHANNON:  So -- and I will work off of what the \n12 plaintiff has said.  I mean, the plaintiff has asked for \n13 permission to issue this discovery.  They are explaining and \n14 attempting to advise the Court that they have established good \n15 cause for issuance of discovery built around this notion of \n16 compliance.  \n17 And the difference I think, and some of this is \n18 procedural, but some of this is more of a gatekeeper function.  \n19 The thing that's unique here, your Honor, is getting back to \n20 what I, frankly, have been talking about since the beginning \n21 of our conferences, that if it is discovery related to the \n22 permanent injunction, then we should be doing that by way of a \n23 real schedule, a real structure with a gatekeeper and a time \n24 line that everyone is operating off of the same page on, not \n25 these ad hoc, regular and routine emergency freestanding \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n18\n1 requests that really, as you'll note from our brief, in our \n2 mind are akin to a rule to show cause or a motion for \n3 contempt, which carries a much more significant burden than \n4 just good cause to make us respond to this stuff that they \n5 deem appropriate at this point.  \n6 THE COURT:  All right.  I'm just trying to process \n7 that.  \n8 So it kind of sounded like what you were telling me \n9 is that if this discovery involves the rest of the case, they \n10 can't do it because there isn't a discovery schedule in place.  \n11 Where is that coming from?  Is that in the Rules of Civil \n12 Procedure somewhere?  \n13 MR. SHANNON:  Well, I think -- I suppose it would be \n14 part of a district court scheduling order, your Honor, but to \n15 some extent, I'm operating off of custom, too, and that's -- \n16 if this matter is assigned to Judge Gettleman and the other \n17 permanent injunction hearings I have had, there is a schedule.  \n18 It typically involves expert disclosures.  It typically \n19 involves times to respond.  It typically will involve motions \n20 to compel in the district court or whichever court is \n21 presiding will serve as the gatekeeper, but there is a \n22 structure.  It's not this hovercraft, this kind of \n23 freestanding, we think we need this now because we would like \n24 to explore whether you're complying with the judge's order. \n25 THE COURT:  So -- so if the plaintiffs had just sent \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n19\n1 out these things, and, you know, said, okay, this is our Rule \n2 34 request for production, your response would be then, no, \n3 you can't do that because we don't -- the judge hasn't imposed \n4 -- hasn't set a discovery schedule, it sounds like.  Is that \n5 right?  \n6 MR. SHANNON:  I don't know that that would be our \n7 position, your Honor.  I suspect that we would probably issue \n8 our own discovery, and at some point, we'd work out a schedule \n9 with the plaintiffs.  \n10 THE COURT:  I don't know if that was a yes or if it \n11 was a no, but thanks.  \n12 Okay.  So who wants to talk about this issue of on \n13 the plaintiffs' side about this issue of what, when and how \n14 and under what circumstances you're entitled to do discovery \n15 at this point?  \n16 MS. GRADY:  Your Honor, I can handle that question.  \n17 So as an initial matter, we think the law on the \n18 jurisdictional point is clear that's separate from a showing, \n19 and that would be true because frankly these discovery \n20 requests are relevant to both the preliminary injunction and \n21 the permanent injunction, and a party always has the right to \n22 ask the Court for expedited or emergency discovery even before \n23 there is a scheduling order in place.  We've done that in \n24 other cases.  That is what Rule 26(d) expressly permits \n25 parties to do, to come to court and say I need this discovery \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n20\n1 because there is an emergency here.  \n2 Sometimes that's statute of limitations.  Sometimes \n3 it's something else, but that's an available mechanism for the \n4 Court.  \n5 The Court can order that discovery to be answered on \n6 an expedited schedule, and the cases that we have laid out in \n7 our brief at Docket 85 and also the brief we filed yesterday, \n8 that's at Docket 102, lay out the standard for that, that's \n9 good cause, and we've explained why we need that.  I think, \n10 frankly, the substance of the case establishes what the \n11 emergency is and why we need the discovery to understand what \n12 the status of the situation is in the jail, especially given \n13 our declarations that we've submitted and establishing that \n14 the Sheriff's contention -- he's got everything well in hand \n15 is not so.  \n16 I'm happy to speak more about why the district court \n17 has jurisdiction.  There can be really no dispute, for \n18 example, that the Court could order witnesses to give \n19 testimony in order to assess whether the defendants were in \n20 compliance with the preliminary injunction.  \n21 There can be no distinction between ordering them to \n22 do that and ordering them instead to tell us about that sort \n23 of a thing.  And there's just no case that establishes that \n24 discovery about compliance is there's no jurisdiction for the \n25 order about compliance. \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n21\n1 THE COURT:  So why didn't you guys just serve these \n2 as discovery requests and rather than putting them in like, \n3 whatever it was, a response to a status report or something \n4 like that?  \n5 MS. GRADY:  Well, I think that there are two -- two \n6 responses to that.  One is that the timing that we believe is \n7 necessary to get responses is immediate.  And for the reasons \n8 laid out in our brief, you know, we needed those responses \n9 right away, and I'm happy to defer to the brief on that. \n10 THE COURT:  15 days have gone by, okay?  So what's \n11 the second reason?  \n12 MS. GRADY:  Okay.  The other -- the other reason is \n13 that although we served waivers of service basically at the \n14 time we served our complaint, the defendants have not yet \n15 completed the waivers of service, and so I think under the \n16 Federal Rules, there may be some tricky issues about being \n17 able to demand that they respond to discovery without a court \n18 order. \n19 THE COURT:  Okay.  That sounds like an actual reason.  \n20 Okay.  \n21 Let me ask you on the plaintiffs' side.  Again, it \n22 doesn't have to be the same person that answers all of these \n23 questions.  I just make the observation that a good deal of at \n24 least the plaintiffs' last submission, maybe the one before \n25 that as well, kind of sounds more like, well, we really don't \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n22\n1 think the preliminary injunction went far enough, you ought to \n2 be doing more, rather than give us discovery to ascertain \n3 compliance.  \n4 So I want to find out -- I basically have -- your \n5 discovery requests, your document requests, there's seven of \n6 them.  If I can kind of boil those down to their essentials.  \n7 Number one is information regarding the number of tests, \n8 number of positive tests.  \n9 Number two is information about the protocol for \n10 testing.  \n11 Number three is identification of people who have \n12 died from coronavirus disease.  \n13 Number four is identify everybody in the RTU, various \n14 things about them.  \n15 Number five is update the tier occupancy report.  \n16 Number six is provide supporting information for \n17 those who -- it has to do with group housing, why they have to \n18 be in group housing or why they can't be in group housing. \n19 And then number seven was CCTV footage for a \n20 particular day for like about 10 or 11 tiers.  \n21 So I want to zero in on two of those.  What does \n22 identifying people who have died and identifying who's in the \n23 RTU have to do with compliance with the preliminary \n24 injunction?  \n25 MS. VAN BRUNT:  Your Honor, it's Alexa Van Brunt.  \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n23\n1 The people in the RTU, while not subject to the \n2 social distancing requirements, are subject to the \n3 requirements related to protective personal equipment and \n4 sanitation, and we have strong concerns about the state of \n5 affairs in the RTU and Cermak because of how crowded they are \n6 and because of reports we've received about additions in those \n7 units from detainees and their families. \n8 THE COURT:  How does that relate to discovery request \n9 number four?  What you just said, how does it relate to \n10 discovery request number four?  \n11 MS. VAN BRUNT:  Right.  That relates to -- apologies \n12 -- to CCTV footage over the RTU.  \n13 As to number four, which seeks the actual booking \n14 information and medical designation, the Sheriff is in one of \n15 the exceptions to social distancing requirements, it lays out \n16 the documentation that is necessary for those exceptions, and \n17 one of those relates to the need to be in housing that is \n18 equipped for medical and mental health treatment.  \n19 So we want to assess whether everybody who is in RTU \n20 and in Cermak which are not socially distanced under the order \n21 are, in fact, there for a proper medical reason in accordance \n22 with the order.  \n23 THE COURT:  Are you looking at request number four?  \n24 MS. VAN BRUNT:  Yes, your Honor, but it does dovetail \n25 with request -- \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n24\n1 THE COURT:  Okay.  I understand, but it's a separate \n2 request, so it's its own thing.  It's got a number on it.  \n3 It's a paragraph, and it's separated from the other thing.  So \n4 what is it in number four that's going to get you anything \n5 about what you just said?  \n6 MS. VAN BRUNT:  The medical designation, your Honor.  \n7 THE COURT:  What is a medical designation, as you \n8 understand that to be used by the Sheriff?  \n9 MS. VAN BRUNT:  They have specific designations, \n10 these M3, M4. \n11 THE COURT:  Code, right?  Yeah. \n12 MS. VAN BRUNT:  Yeah, the code for varying levels of \n13 physical and mental health needs and disability. \n14 THE COURT:  So you're trying -- so that would -- so \n15 that would enable you to ascertain what the -- you know what \n16 those codes mean presumably.  That would unable you to \n17 ascertain what the designation is of each person in the RTU in \n18 Cermak. \n19 MS. VAN BRUNT:  We believe so.  We know what the \n20 codes mean to the extent they were elucidated in the Sheriff's \n21 pleadings, and we used those codes because we thought it would \n22 be easiest for the Sheriff to respond using its own codes as \n23 opposed to ones we made up. \n24 THE COURT:  Okay.  What about number three, \n25 information sufficient to identify everybody who has died.  \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n25\n1 What part of the preliminary injunction does that relate to?  \n2 MS. VAN BRUNT:  Your Honor, that goes closely again, \n3 I'm sorry to use the word dovetails, but with testing, and we \n4 have received information that people who have been in the \n5 jail and who are immediately released have subsequently died \n6 and have not been counted in the Sheriff's numbers of people \n7 who were sick and then subsequently died as a result of being \n8 sick in the jail.  \n9 We think this is just a general issue of transparency \n10 about what the state of the disease is in the jail, frankly.  \n11 This is the one that is possibly the least -- everything else \n12 is related to compliance, but, your Honor, we've got to say we \n13 need to know who actually is infected and who is dying as a \n14 result of this disease as a general matter, and we have grave \n15 concerns about what we are hearing in terms of the disparities \n16 between who is dying -- \n17 THE COURT:  You're getting pretty far away from my \n18 question at this point. \n19 MS. VAN BRUNT:  Apologies.  \n20 THE COURT:  So you think the Sheriff has got \n21 information about who's died after they left the jail, which \n22 is what number three really relates to?  \n23 MS. VAN BRUNT:  Correct.  It's that last phrase. \n24 THE COURT:  What makes you think they'd have that?  \n25 MS. VAN BRUNT:  Well, if he doesn't have it, we'd \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n26\n1 like to know that.  It -- we -- \n2 THE COURT:  Yeah, honestly, look, if you want to get \n3 yelled at like Mr. Shannon did for not answering questions, \n4 just keep it up.  Okay?  That's not an answer to my question.  \n5 Do you want to answer my question?  \n6 MS. VAN BRUNT:  Apologies.  We don't know that he \n7 knows it, but we don't know.  \n8 THE COURT:  I'm getting the feedback beeping again, \n9 which I'm pretty sure is coming from the conference room at \n10 Hinshaw.  Just saying.  \n11 I want to go back -- again, we're just talking about \n12 the discovery requests at this point.  So why isn't -- why \n13 isn't the right thing to do here -- so, well, actually, let me \n14 ask a different question.  This picks up on something that \n15 either Ms. Grady or Ms. Van Brunt said.  \n16 So what's the story with returning the waiver of \n17 service, Mr. Shannon or anybody else on the defense side?  \n18 MR. SHANNON:  We haven't answered yet, your Honor.  I \n19 was not aware of that. \n20 THE COURT:  No, no, no.  Did you hear my question?  \n21 My question was where are you on returning the waiver of \n22 service?  \n23 MR. SHANNON:  I was not aware of that, your Honor, \n24 and I will have to check on that.  \n25 THE COURT:  Okay.  Who on the plaintiffs' side is \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n27\n1 familiar with when the waiver of service was sent?  \n2 MS. GRADY:  Your Honor, I am happy -- I'm in the \n3 process of pulling that up.  \n4 THE COURT:  I'm going to step away for a second and \n5 just grab one thing.  \n6 (Brief pause.) \n7 THE COURT:  Raise your hand if you're hearing that \n8 infernal beeping?  \n9 Okay.  Raise your hand if it's driving you bonkers?  \n10 Oh, it stopped.  Okay.  Maybe that's all it took.  You just \n11 had to yell at it.  \n12 Are we close, Ms. Grady?  \n13 MS. GRADY:  I'm so sorry, your Honor.  I really did \n14 think that I was going to have it pulled up.  It -- \n15 THE COURT:  Maybe I should ask another question.  Are \n16 you sure you sent one?  \n17 MS. GRADY:  Well, I would expect my search to be \n18 doing a better job.  \n19 If I can have about three minutes, I can probably \n20 tell you as a confirmed matter that we did or that we probably \n21 didn't.  If I can have one minute to look. \n22 THE COURT:  I'm actually going to go a different \n23 direction here for a second, but I've got to pull up the \n24 docket in order to do that, so just give me a second to do \n25 that.  \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n28\n1 All right.  \n2 MS. GRADY:  Your Honor, while we are doing that, I \n3 can confirm that we did on April 4th.  \n4 THE COURT:  Okay.  \n5 All right.  So turning over to the defense.  So they \n6 sent the waiver of service on April the 4th.  What's going on \n7 with it?  \n8 MR. SHANNON:  I'm going to have to find out, your \n9 Honor.  I am not in a position -- \n10 THE COURT:  If you don't know right now, there is not \n11 much point.  \n12 To the extent that the rules, you know, delay the \n13 initiation of discovery, basically what they talk about is \n14 they talk about the judge issuing a scheduling order and when \n15 the judge is supposed to issue a scheduling order, and it says \n16 that the judge must issue -- this is 16(b)(2), the judge must \n17 issue a scheduling -- the scheduling order as soon as \n18 practicable.  \n19 But unless the judge finds good cause for delay, the \n20 judge must issue it within the earlier of 90 days after any \n21 defendant has been served with the complaint or 60 days after \n22 any defendant has appeared.  \n23 Defendants appeared on April the 5th.  The 5th plus \n24 60 would be something like June the 3rd.  Maybe June the 2nd.  \n25 My math is maybe a little off there.  \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n29\n1 Okay.  We're going to pause on the discovery, and we \n2 are going to come back to that in a second.  Now I am going to \n3 talk about the main question.  \n4 So the last document that was filed on the request \n5 for a stay pending appeal was filed by the plaintiff, so I'd \n6 like to give Mr. -- whoever wants to deal with this on the \n7 defense side a chance to discuss the question of a stay \n8 pending appeal.  \n9 MS. SPERRY:  Your Honor, I won't go too far out of \n10 our briefs, but there are a couple of points that I think are \n11 very important to keep in mind as to why a stay is warranted \n12 in this case.  \n13 In addition to the facts that we believe, given the \n14 uncertainty about the standard, legal standard, to be applied, \n15 certainly there is a likelihood of success on the merits of \n16 the appeal itself.  \n17 More importantly, the injunction must be stayed \n18 because the efforts that have been in place at the jail since \n19 well before this case has been filed have been successful in \n20 controlling the spread of the virus as demonstrated by the \n21 data that we submitted which show, most importantly, that the \n22 test positivity rate in the jail is now less than 6 percent.  \n23 The test positivity rate as a frame of reference in \n24 the northeast region of the state of the governor's order, for \n25 example, is somewhere around 18 percent, meaning that if all \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n30\n1 of the detainees that are tested, and we have, and I'll get to \n2 this, but we have expanded greatly the number of detainees \n3 tested, but of all of them who are tested, less than 6 percent \n4 of them are testing positive, and of them, the vast majority \n5 of them are entering the jails from the community at intake.  \n6 This is not due to the spread of the virus inside the jail.  \n7 So what all of this means is that the efforts that \n8 have been in place, the most important efforts that have led \n9 to this success have been, for example, the assignment of \n10 isolation housing for positive tests of detainees, quarantine \n11 housing for those who have been exposed, opening tiers of the \n12 jail to allow for social distancing in the housing areas, the \n13 efforts that have been made to obtain PPE and have the jail \n14 designated as a rapid testing site.  \n15 Those are all of the efforts that have led to these \n16 great successes that we are now seeing.  They've been in place \n17 long before the suit was filed and certainly before the \n18 injunction itself was entered.  Therefore, number one, there \n19 is no risk that the Sheriff is going to stop doing these \n20 structural efforts within the jail and compromise the success \n21 that he has had so far.  And, number two, that those efforts \n22 have in and of themselves been responsible for these results.  \n23 The injunction largely reinforced the things that the \n24 Sheriff was already doing again before the suit was filed.  So \n25 the harm, of course, is that now the Sheriff is in a position \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n31\n1 of having to operate the jail under threat of contempt for \n2 making a decision that may be warranted, for example, by the \n3 CDC's recommendations.  However, it might be in conflict with \n4 the Court's injunction.  \n5 And there are now three appellate circuits in this \n6 country that have determined that that in and of itself is a \n7 greater harm, the federalism issues that are raised by a \n8 federal court imposing these types of restrictions and \n9 interference on the Sheriff's inherent discretion to operate \n10 the jail safely, which, again, he has proven that he is doing, \n11 that that in and of itself is a greater harm than lifting the \n12 injunction because of the fact that the detainees are now at \n13 an extraordinarily low rate risk of infection, the absence of \n14 the injunction is not going to be of harm to them.  Certainly \n15 not -- \n16 THE COURT:  Okay.  I am going to interrupt you for a \n17 second.  Because -- \n18 MS. SPERRY:  Yes. \n19 THE COURT:  -- I mean, in light about the first \n20 two-thirds of what you said, that we're already doing this, \n21 we're already doing that, and then largely the tenor of the \n22 written materials that have been filed is that you basically \n23 just ordered us to do stuff we were already doing, if that's \n24 true, I guess I'm really having a hard time coming to grips \n25 with the proposition that the Sheriff, which has to show \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n32\n1 irreparable harm absent a stay, how the Sheriff is going to be \n2 irreparably harmed if there is not a stay in light of, you \n3 know, basically what the whole tenor of what your briefs say.  \n4 So, I mean, I know you want to focus on other things.  \n5 You want to focus on there's no harm to the plaintiff because \n6 we're going to keep doing all these things, but let's zero in \n7 on that issue for me. \n8 MS. SPERRY:  Sure, of course.  \n9 The irreparable harm here, as the 5th, the 11th and \n10 9th Circuits have found is that forcing -- essentially this \n11 injunction places the Sheriff in the position of having to \n12 consider a potential claim of contempt with the injunction \n13 order, which interferes with his inherent discretion to \n14 operate the jail as he sees fit.  \n15 And this is deeply rooted in the United States \n16 Supreme Court precedent about the federal courts not elevating \n17 themselves to the quote/unquote superwarden, as the 11th \n18 Circuit said it, micromanaging, essentially, the functions of \n19 the jail, and placing the sheriffs in the untenable position \n20 of having to say, well, I'm either going to be in contempt or \n21 I can operate the jail safely in the way that I have the \n22 inherent discretion to do, and that that, as a matter of \n23 federalism and otherwise, is an irreparable harm greater than \n24 any risk the plaintiffs -- \n25 THE COURT:  I have two questions about that, two \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n33\n1 questions about that.  One is just to clarify.  \n2 So basically the irreparable harm is the fact that \n3 the Sheriff essentially, for want of a better word, has to \n4 look over his shoulder, right?  \n5 (Laughter.) \n6 MS. SPERRY:  That's correct. \n7 THE COURT:  That's what you're saying.  \n8 Okay.  Then secondly, secondly, was it the -- and by \n9 the way, whatever that laughter was in the background, it's \n10 got to stop now.  \n11 And I'm going to just pause to let that sink in.  \n12 It's got to stop now.  Just pretend you're in a courtroom \n13 because effectively you are.  \n14 My second question is this:  In any of the other \n15 cases that you had talked about, the three circuit court cases \n16 that you mentioned, Ms. Sperry, was there -- had the defendant \n17 in those cases taken the position, either in the district \n18 court or in the Court of Appeals, that they were already doing \n19 independently all of the things that they had been directed to \n20 do by the preliminary injunction?  \n21 MS. SPERRY:  In those particular cases, your Honor, \n22 they had efforts in place to contain the spread of the virus.  \n23 The court in some cases was ordering those jail directors to \n24 do that, sometimes more than that.  \n25 But, yes, they were already taking effective steps to \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n34\n1 control the spread of the virus in the jail. \n2 MR. SHANNON:  Your Honor?  \n3 THE COURT:  I am going to ask my question again.  I \n4 am going to ask that question again, and I'm going to just \n5 pull it up on the realtime so I ask it exactly the same way as \n6 I asked it before.  One second here.  \n7 Have the defendants in those cases taken the \n8 position, either in the district court or in the Court of \n9 Appeals, that they were already doing independently all of the \n10 things that they had been directed to do by the preliminary \n11 injunction?  \n12 Did you hear my question?  Have the defendants in \n13 those cases taken the position, either in the district court \n14 or in the Court of Appeals, that they were already doing \n15 independently all of the things that they were directed to do \n16 by the preliminary injunction?  \n17 MS. SPERRY:  Yes. \n18 THE COURT:  That's the question.  \n19 They did?  Which one so I can go look.  I want to go \n20 look.  So tell me which one or which ones.  They took that \n21 position either in the district court or the Court of Appeals. \n22 MS. SPERRY:  My recollection is that it was the Swain \n23 case from the 11th Circuit out of Miami-Dade County, and that \n24 the position was that they -- \n25 THE COURT:  Just tell me the cases.  No, no, no.  I \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n35\n1 gave you a really clear question.  I asked it three times.  \n2 You said yes.  You said you think it's that case.  What other \n3 ones?  \n4 I can go read them.  I'll just go read them.  I want \n5 to find out if that's what they said, so what's the other one \n6 if there is another one?  \n7 MS. SPERRY:  The other is the Valentine case from the \n8 5th Circuit. \n9 THE COURT:  Valentine.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you. \n10 MS. SPERRY:  And the third is Roman out of the 9th \n11 Circuit. \n12 THE COURT:  Okay.  So you're telling me, again, we \n13 are going back to my question.  You're telling me that in each \n14 one of those cases if I go back and look, I am going to find \n15 that the defendant told either the district court or the Court \n16 of Appeals that they were already doing, independently of the \n17 preliminary injunction, everything that the preliminary \n18 injunction ordered them to do?  I'm going to find that there \n19 because that was my question, is that right?  \n20 MS. SPERRY:  That is my recollection as I sit here, \n21 your Honor, yes. \n22 THE COURT:  Okay.  \n23 All right.  Right.  Let me hear from the plaintiff on \n24 the question on the table.  \n25 MS. VAN BRUNT:  My apologies, your Honor.  I didn't \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n36\n1 hear that very last bit.  \n2 THE COURT:  I want to hear from the plaintiffs on the \n3 stay issue.  \n4 MS. VAN BRUNT:  All right.  I'll take irreparable \n5 harm if that's all right.  \n6 I think that the Sheriff's greatest weakness is that \n7 there has been and cannot be a showing of irreparable harm \n8 where the Sheriff states, as he did, that he is already \n9 complying with the preliminary injunction and fully intends to \n10 keep complying.  \n11 There's also the issue of timing.  It's strange that \n12 there's been a three-week delay in filing a motion to stay.  \n13 The harm is irreparable.  One would expect that the filing \n14 would have come the day after or thereabouts.  \n15 There's also the fact that most of the irreparable \n16 harm the Sheriff mentioned is speculative, and possible future \n17 harm should changed circumstances request or mandate changes \n18 to the preliminary injunction.  But as we put forth in our \n19 brief, the response for that is not a stay, but rather the \n20 Sheriff seeking a modification of the decree in accordance of \n21 those circumstances with an evidentiary basis for it.  And so \n22 far there has been no such showing of proof.  \n23 Altogether, there hasn't been a showing of \n24 irreparable harm, and it's a balancing -- \n25 THE COURT:  So what about this argument that -- \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n37\n1 actually, I am going to ask again that everybody who is not \n2 talking mute yourself.  Everybody, phone, video, everybody, \n3 mute yourself.  I can tell if you're muting yourself.  Okay.  \n4 So everybody do that right now.  Anybody who is not talking, \n5 mute yourself.  \n6 Okay.  So we've got Michael McAndrews who hasn't \n7 muted himself.  We've got Matthew Hendrickson.  We've got \n8 somebody named Donna.  We've got somebody named Elizabeth \n9 Perado.  We've got a couple of my law clerks apparently.  We \n10 got a couple of wireless callers.  Mute yourselves, people.  \n11 Thanks.  \n12 MS. SPERRY:  Your Honor, I do think that some of the \n13 wireless callers are muted but for some reason don't appear as \n14 muted on the participants' list. \n15 THE COURT:  Okay.  Anyway.  What about this argument \n16 that the fact that the Sheriff essentially has to operate \n17 under scrutiny by a court at the risk of a potential contempt \n18 is enough irreparable harm?  What do you have to say about \n19 that?  \n20 MS. VAN BRUNT:  Your Honor, obviously, there is some \n21 burden involved in operating under a preliminary injunction \n22 order, which is why there was such a substantial process to \n23 get to this point already.  And, of course, there is a level \n24 of judicial deference to jailers in operating their jails, \n25 that that is not in opposition to the mandates of the \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n38\n1 Constitution.  \n2 And so in Brown v. Plata, we cite that in our brief, \n3 and Ms. Grady is happy to talk about the merits of the case, \n4 which is why we are here in the first place because there has \n5 been a sufficient showing at this stage of a violation of the \n6 Fourteenth Amendment objective reasonableness standard.  \n7 So there can't be a stay just because there is some \n8 onerous mandate attendant to having a preliminary injunction \n9 when there's already been an evidentiary showing that it's \n10 necessary. \n11 THE COURT:  Okay.  So who is going to talk about the \n12 other stay factors?  \n13 MS. GRADY:  Your Honor, I can talk about that.  \n14 I think the important thing that we think to keep in \n15 mind about Swain and Valentine and I would say the Roman in \n16 the 9th Circuit consists of about two or three sentences, so \n17 there's really not a discussion there laying out the factors.  \n18 In fact, they do enforce the stay related to that.  \n19 For Swain and Valentine, they look at all of the \n20 things, and one of the things they talk about first and \n21 foremost is the likelihood of success on appeal.  And it's in \n22 conjunction with that that they assess the burden on the state \n23 official in Valentine and the county in Swain because where \n24 they have assessed that the district court failed to properly \n25 make findings about the suggested intent, which was required \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n39\n1 in both of those circuits, then the harm of having oversight \n2 was elevated.  So it's all of those factors that have to be \n3 taken together.  \n4 We argue in our brief about why we think there are no \n5 merits arguments here.  The Sheriff doesn't identify a legal \n6 issue.  The arguments in the motion to stay largely disagree \n7 with the result that this Court reached but don't attack the \n8 evidence of the Court's weighing of that evidence, and there \n9 can be no real dispute that there is real harm to plaintiffs, \n10 especially given what counsel just identified, which is that \n11 if these measures were to suddenly be undone, the risk of \n12 infection would by their own admission virtually skyrocket.  \n13 The rule they ask for essentially, every jailer is \n14 irreparably harmed by anybody looking over their shoulder, \n15 which would mean any preliminary injunction involving a \n16 municipality or governmental entity would automatically be \n17 exempt from any district court preliminary injunction until a \n18 Court of Appeals had weighed in.  \n19 That's not the law.  There's no case that says that, \n20 and this Court has to assess all the factors.  \n21 THE COURT:  Okay.  \n22 MR. SHANNON:  Your Honor, can I respond briefly, your \n23 Honor?  \n24 THE COURT:  I don't know who that is.  \n25 MR. SHANNON:  This is Robert Shannon, Bob Shannon on \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n40\n1 behalf of defendant. \n2 THE COURT:  Briefly, yeah, you can respond briefly. \n3 MR. SHANNON:  I want to respond briefly, your Honor, \n4 on this notion of -- which we feel strongly about of harm to \n5 the Sheriff's Office, and I think the point is that \n6 plaintiffs' own actions here add texture to what the circuit \n7 cases are talking about, and it's not simply a matter of \n8 oversight or someone looking over, us having to look over our \n9 shoulder.  \n10 Your Honor's order was issued on April the 27th, 80 \n11 pages, and it's the emergency nature of how plaintiffs \n12 continue to approach this which is unique and which is \n13 significant.  \n14 This jail spent most of the month of April focused on \n15 this piece of litigation compared to others in the middle of \n16 trying to deal with a pandemic.  It was a tremendous \n17 undertaking, extraordinarily burdensome, and we did our \n18 emergency work.  And we filed our compliance report on May the \n19 1st, and four days later we received a brand new set of \n20 emergency discovery requests asking that we respond within 48 \n21 hours.  That's -- \n22 THE COURT:  So I'm sorry.  I need to interrupt you \n23 for a second, Mr. Shannon.  \n24 Are you saying the fact that you've got these \n25 discovery requests is part of the irreparable harm?  \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n41\n1 MR. SHANNON:  We cannot and what the cases -- yes, \n2 your Honor, but if I can explain. \n3 THE COURT:  Just be -- can you please just say yes or \n4 no, and then you can expound?  Is that a part of the \n5 irreparable harm?  \n6 MR. SHANNON:  Yes. \n7 THE COURT:  Okay.  So I have a follow-up question.  \n8 You basically are saying they can't do that, and so \n9 if I take that away, then there goes that irreparable harm.  \n10 Your position is, legally speaking, A, they can't ask \n11 for that discovery; and, B, I can't order it.  And so if \n12 you're right, then that can't be part of the irreparable harm \n13 because it's kind of null and void, so to speak. \n14 MR. SHANNON:  If your Honor enters the stay and only \n15 then. \n16 THE COURT:  No, no, no, no, no.  That's not what we \n17 are talking about.  No, no.  Completely independently.  You \n18 said they can't do that discovery, period, because the \n19 preliminary injunction order itself did not contemplate \n20 discovery, and there has not been a scheduling order or \n21 anything else, and so they can't do the discovery completely \n22 independent of the stay.  \n23 And so now you're arguing, well, wait a second, \n24 Judge, the fact that we have to respond to all of this \n25 discovery, that's part of the irreparable harm.  So, fine, I \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n42\n1 get it.  I get that's your argument.  \n2 So then that means that if I don't let them do the \n3 discovery, there goes that aspect of the irreparable harm, \n4 right?  \n5 MR. SHANNON:  I do believe that, your Honor.  But \n6 what I believe doesn't mean anything until a court orders it \n7 because their own actions have shown that they will continue \n8 to file things with an emergency request -- \n9 THE COURT:  Okay.  So if they were calling you on the \n10 phone five times a day, would that be irreparable harm, too?  \n11 MR. SHANNON:  You know, it would be a factor to be \n12 considered under the circuit court decisions that say -- \n13 THE COURT:  I'm sorry for interrupting.  Go ahead and \n14 finish the point that you were going to make. \n15 MR. SHANNON:  And that's -- I'll close with this \n16 comment.  \n17 That is what is unique about this specific set of \n18 discovery requests, your Honor.  It wasn't just discovery in \n19 the normal course of the permanent injunction.  It's assuming \n20 non-compliance, asking for information to explore \n21 non-compliance under an emergency basis, responding within 48 \n22 hours after this jail had already been derailed for one month \n23 trying to accommodate the request and dealing with this \n24 hearing.  And what the circuit court cases say, in a pandemic, \n25 a jail should not be subject to that.  \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n43\n1 THE COURT:  Okay.  I want to make an observation \n2 about that last comment, and then I am going to say what we \n3 are going to do going forward.  \n4 So I understand that a lot of people had to spend a \n5 lot of time dealing with the temporary restraining order \n6 motion and the preliminary injunction motion in this case.  I \n7 understand that.  \n8 You just used the word derailed.  Now, you can't on \n9 the one hand, you can't on the one hand say that we're doing \n10 all this stuff; you know, everything that you ordered us to \n11 do, we were already doing.  As a jail running the jail, you \n12 can't say that on the one hand and on the other hand say that \n13 the jail was derailed by this lawsuit.  \n14 Maybe a bunch of lawyers were derailed by the \n15 lawsuit, and I know Mr. Miller had to spend a goodly amount of \n16 time on that.  I greatly appreciate that.  He spent a goodly \n17 amount of time on it, but you've got to pick your hyperbole a \n18 little bit more carefully.  I'm just going to say that. \n19 So here's what we're going to do.  I'm going to take \n20 under advisement the motion to stay pending appeal.  I am \n21 going to take under advisement the discovery requests and, I \n22 guess, the corresponding motion to strike them.  \n23 I'm going to color a little bit outside of the lines \n24 here, and if Judge Gettleman has a problem with this, you \n25 know, he can undo it obviously, and it's quite all right with \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n44\n1 me because it's his case, but I'm going to -- because there is \n2 a case beyond the preliminary injunction because the \n3 plaintiffs have asked for a permanent injunction.  So I'm \n4 going to direct the parties to have their -- to submit a \n5 proposed scheduling order under 16(b) by a week from next \n6 Monday.  That's going to go to Judge Gettleman by the 2nd of \n7 June.  \n8 And so you're to have your conference under 26(f) at \n9 some appropriate point between now and then, but that's when \n10 the draft scheduling order is due to Judge Gettleman.  So that \n11 at least as of June the 2nd, or whenever Judge Gettleman \n12 enters it, will take off the table at least the theoretical \n13 proposition that discovery can't be done absent a court order \n14 because the case doesn't end with a preliminary injunction.  \n15 No case in history has ended after a preliminary injunction \n16 unless the parties have settled it, okay, or somebody has \n17 changed their mind and given up on it, I don't know.  \n18 So everything else is taken under advisement.  Nobody \n19 has leave to file anything else.  I've got plenty enough to \n20 work with based on what you've given me and on the arguments \n21 you've made today.\n22 (Discussion off the record.) \n23 THE COURT:  All right.  Thanks, everybody.  Have a \n24 good rest of the day.  \n25 MS. GRADY:  Thank you, your Honor.  \n\n \nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-4            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 45\n45\n1 MS.

KENNELLY, District Judge:1 \n  Anthony Mays and Kenneth Foster, both of whom are detained at Cook County \nJail while awaiting trial on criminal charges, have sued Cook County Sheriff Thomas \nDart, who operates the Jail, on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons.  Mays and \nFoster allege the Sheriff has violated the constitutional rights of persons detained at the \njail by failing to provide them with reasonably safe living conditions in the face of the \ncurrent coronavirus pandemic.  They assert claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and for writs \nof habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241.   \n  On April 9, 2020, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary \n                                            \n1  Judge Kennelly is addressing this matter as emergency judge pursuant to paragraph \n5 of Second Amended General Order 20-0012. \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 2 of 87 PageID #:1935\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nrestraining order in part.  The Court directed the Sheriff to:  (1) establish and implement, \nwithin two days' time, a policy requiring prompt coronavirus testing of detained persons \nwith symptoms consistent with coronavirus disease; (2) within two days' time, eliminate \nthe use of \"bullpens\" to hold groups of new detainees during the intake process; (3) \nbegin to provide inmates and staff, within one day, soap and/or hand sanitizer sufficient \nto enable them to frequently clean their hands, and sanitation supplies sufficient to \nenable them to regularly sanitize surfaces in areas used in common; (4) establish and \ncarry out, within two days' time, a policy requiring sanitation of all such surfaces \nbetween each use; and (5) within three days' time, distribute facemasks to all detained \npersons quarantined due to their exposure to a person exhibiting symptoms consistent \nwith coronavirus disease.  The Court overruled the plaintiffs' request for additional \ntemporary relief, including a mandate for implementation of \"social distancing\" \nthroughout the Jail and to provide facemasks to every detained person.  The Court also \nconcluded that the plaintiffs seeking habeas corpus relief had failed to exhaust available \nstate court remedies. \n  The plaintiffs have now moved for entry of a preliminary injunction and other \nrelief.  They again seek writs of habeas corpus, based on newly discovered facts that \nthey contend provide a basis to excuse their failure to exhaust state court remedies.  \nThey also seek conversion of the temporary restraining order to a preliminary injunction, \nand they again request an order requiring implementation of social distancing \nthroughout the Jail, as well as transfer of detained persons from the Jail to other \nlocations within the Sheriff's control, including electronic home monitoring.  The plaintiffs \nalso request the convening of a three-judge court under the Prison Litigation Reform Act \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 3 of 87 PageID #:1936\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nto consider entering a \"prisoner release order\" within the meaning of that statute. \n  For the reasons stated below, the Court converts the terms of the temporary \nrestraining order to a preliminary injunction and enters further preliminary injunctive \nrelief regarding social distancing but denies the plaintiffs' other requests for relief. \nFactual Background \nThe following discussion of relevant facts concerning coronavirus, the Cook \nCounty Jail facilities, and the parties' claims and defenses is taken from undisputed \nfacts, the affidavits and documentary evidence submitted by the parties, and the \ntestimony and exhibits offered at the evidentiary hearing held on April 23, 2020.     \nA.  The coronavirus pandemic \nThe rapid global spread of the novel coronavirus has led to a pandemic of \nextraordinary scale.  The Court's decision on the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary \nrestraining order includes a discussion of the gravity of the public health threat \nassociated with this virus.  Mays v. Dart, No. 20 C 2134, 2020 WL 1812381, at *2 (N.D. \nIll. Apr. 9, 2020). \nSymptoms of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus—what has come to \nbe known as COVID-19, which the Court will refer to as coronavirus disease—include \nfever, cough, and shortness of breath, and the health effects can be very severe, \nincluding serious damage to the lungs and other internal organs, and death.  People \nwho are sixty-five years of age or older and those with certain pre-existing health \nconditions, including chronic lung disease, moderate to severe asthma, serious heart \nconditions, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, a body mass index of forty \nor higher, and other conditions have a heightened vulnerability to severe illness if they \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 4 of 87 PageID #:1937\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\ncontract the coronavirus.   \nThe rapid transmission of coronavirus has been attributed to several \ncharacteristics.  Respiratory droplets containing the virus emitted by an infected person, \nthough coughing or sneezing for example, can travel several feet and may persist in the \nair for several hours.  In addition, because the virus can persist on some surfaces for up \nto three days, transmission can occur even without physical proximity to an infected \nperson.  Moreover, those who contract the virus may be asymptomatic for days or even \nfor the entire duration of the infection but can still transmit the virus to others, making it \nmore challenging to readily identify infected individuals and respond with necessary \nprecautions.   \n There is currently no known effective treatment for coronavirus disease and no \nvaccine to prevent people from contracting it.  Medical professionals and public health \nexperts agree—and the evidence in this case demonstrates beyond peradventure—that \nthe only way to curb the spread of the virus is through a multi-faceted strategy that \nincludes testing to identify those who have been infected; isolation of those who test \npositive or develop symptoms consistent with the disease; quarantining those who may \nhave come into contact with the virus; frequent sanitation of surfaces; frequent \nhandwashing; and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as facemasks.  \nAnd a key tactic recommended by public health experts to curb the spread of \ncoronavirus disease has been to keep people apart from each other—what has come to \nbe known as \"social distancing.\"  The Centers for Disease Control's Interim Guidance \non Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 5 of 87 PageID #:1938\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nDetention Facilities (\"CDC Guidelines\"),2 defines social distancing as \"the practice of \nincreasing the space between individuals and decreasing the frequency of contact to \nreduce the risk of spreading a disease (ideally to maintain at least 6 feet between all \nindividuals, even those who are asymptomatic).\"  Id. at 4.   \nSocial distancing has effectively been mandated by most state governments as a \ncritical strategy in combatting the pandemic.  Here in Illinois, the state has been under a \nstatewide stay-at-home order first imposed by Governor J.B. Pritzker effective March \n20, 2020, the goal of which is to limit person-to-person contacts to curb transmission of \nthe virus.  Activities not deemed \"essential\" have been shut down.  People have been \nstrongly urged, and in many situations directed (by governments, employers, \ncommercial establishments, and so on) to maintain space between themselves and \nothers.  In addition, the wearing of PPE, primarily facemasks, has been strongly advised \nand now required in some situations, particularly when people may come into contact \nwith others. \nThe effect of the stay-at-home orders imposed in Illinois and most other states, \nalong with advice by national officials to limit contacts and group activities, has been \ndramatic: schools have been closed; commercial establishments and workplaces have \nceased operations, resulting in massive job losses; public events have largely been \ncancelled; and access to public spaces has been limited or barred entirely.  Entire \nsectors of the national economy have slowed to a snail's pace.  Society has paid a very \nhigh price to curb the spread of this highly contagious virus. \n                                            \n2 The Guidelines were issued on March 23, 2020 and are available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/guidance-correctional-\ndetention.pdf. \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 6 of 87 PageID #:1939\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nB.  Operation of the Cook County Jail \nThe Sheriff runs the Cook County Jail.  As the Court stated in its written decision \non the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), the Jail is \"a very large \nphysical facility—actually a campus of separate physical facilities—whose population, if \none considers including both detainees and staff, is the size of a small (but not all that \nsmall) town.\"  Mays, 2020 WL 1812381, at *1.  Managing the Jail is extraordinarily \nchallenging because of the size of its population and physical facilities, the diverse \nneeds of the detainees, the Sheriff's public safety obligations, and his obligations to the \ncriminal justice system.  The Sheriff's public safety obligations require him to consider \nthe appropriate custodial conditions for each detained person.  As the Court has noted, \nthe Jail's population \"runs the gamut from persons with lengthy criminal records who are \naccused of committing violent crimes to non-violent offenders in custody for the first \ntime who, perhaps, remain in custody only because they and their families were unable \nto post bond money.\"  Id.  And the Sheriff's obligations to the people in his custody, \nmost of whom are detained awaiting trial on crimes for which they are therefore entitled \nto a presumption of innocence, require him to provide care sufficient to account for each \nindividual's physical and mental health conditions.  This is no small task, particularly \ngiven that populations in custody are statistically more likely to have adverse health \nconditions, both physical and mental. \nAdding an infectious disease outbreak to these conditions further complicates the \ndifficult challenge of managing the Jail.  The very nature of the Jail's setup and day-to-\nday operations facilitates rapid transmission of communicable diseases like the one \ncaused by the coronavirus.  First, the Jail's physical facilities are designed to \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 7 of 87 PageID #:1940\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\naccommodate large populations, all densely housed, and many in congregate settings.  \nIn particular, the Jail has many so-called \"dormitory\" units, which in normal times may \nhouse as many as hundreds of detained persons in a single room with closely-spaced \nbunk beds.   \nSecond, the Jail is a closed environment with many spaces used in common.  \nPersons detained there—even those housed in single-occupancy cells—do not have \nindividual bathing facilities; toilets are typically used in common; they eat in groups \nunder normal circumstances; and they come into contact with each other and with \ncorrectional officers in other common areas.  And even when confined, detainees are in \nclose proximity, in adjoining cells and in tiers that use a common ventilation system.   \nThird, the routine operations of the Jail require high levels of movement of \npeople.  Detained persons must be escorted from their cells to common areas like \nshower and bathroom facilities.  In normal times they are escorted to court hearings and \nrecreational areas (all or nearly all of which have come to a stop).  Finally, large \nnumbers of staff personnel, as well as vendors, move in and out of the Jail and its \nvarious areas on a daily basis.  In doing so, these individuals have contact with other \nmembers of the community at large, who themselves may have contracted coronavirus.  \nThus staff members and contractors potentially can carry the virus both into and out of \nthe Jail. \nLimiting exposure to the coronavirus in the Jail is therefore a significant \nchallenge.  Infection rate data reflects that it has been challenging to effectively curb \ntransmission of the highly infectious coronavirus in the setting of the Jail.  As of April 6, \n2020, the infection rate within the Jail was an order of magnitude higher than the rate of \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 8 of 87 PageID #:1941\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\ninfection in Cook County.  Mays, 2020 WL 1812381, at *8.  And on April 8, 2019, the \nNew York Times reported that, at that time, the Jail was the largest-known source of \ncoronavirus infections in the United States.  See Timothy Williams and Danielle Ivory, \nChicago’s Jail Is Top U.S. Hot Spot as Virus Spreads Behind Bars (April 8, 2020), N.Y. \nTimes, https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/coronavirus-cook-county-jail-\nchicago.html (last updated April 23, 2020). \nProcedural History \nA.  Plaintiffs' suit and motion for a temporary restraining order \n  The plaintiffs, Anthony Mays and Kenneth Foster, are detained at the Cook \nCounty Jail and have been housed on tiers in which at least one person had been \ninfected with the coronavirus.  On April 3, 2020, they sued the Sheriff on behalf of \nthemselves and others similarly situated, with allegations stemming from the risks the \ncoronavirus poses to their health.  The plaintiffs seek to represent a class and two \nputative subclasses.  The class consists of \"all people who are currently or who will in \nthe future be housed in the Cook County Jail for the duration of the COVID-19 \npandemic.\"  Compl. (dkt. no. 1) ¶ 60.  \"Subclass A consists of all people who, because \nof age or previous medical conditions, are at particularly grave risk of harm from \nCOVID-19.\"  Id. ¶ 61.  \"Subclass B consists of all people who are currently housed on a \ntier where someone already tested positive for the coronavirus.\"  Id. ¶ 62.  Mays and \nFoster both have medical conditions that heighten their risk of serious health \nconsequences from an infection by the coronavirus.   \nIn their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that because the Sheriff was not \nimplementing measures to control the spread of the coronavirus at the Jail, especially \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 9 of 87 PageID #:1942\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nthose recommended in the CDC Guidelines, the conditions in the Jail facilitated rapid \ntransmission, putting the health of detained persons at great risk.  In support of this \ncontention, the plaintiffs attached several affidavits to their complaint from individuals \nwho had spoken to persons detained at the jail.  These affidavits reported the following \nconditions at the Jail in late March and early April: \n•  detained persons were not receiving soap, hand sanitizer, or facemasks; \n•  facemasks that they made for themselves out of cloth were being confiscated; \n•  detainees were being housed in bunks or beds that were between two and \nfour feet apart from each other; \n•  many detained persons were living in dormitory-style housing, where dozens \nof individuals shared a single room; \n•  detained persons were being held at intake in so-called bullpens, where \nnumerous detainees were held together for extended periods in a crowded \ncell; and \n•  the Jail's staff was not regularly sanitizing common surfaces or providing \ndetainees with cleaning supplies to do this themselves.   \n  The day they filed suit, the plaintiffs moved for the issuance of writs of habeas \ncorpus for the members of subclass A and for a TRO or preliminary injunction on behalf \nof the class as a whole, requiring the Sheriff to take action to control the rapid spread of \nthe coronavirus at the Jail.  The plaintiffs also moved to certify their proposed class and \nsubclasses.   \nAfter an extended hearing on the motion for a temporary restraining order, the \nCourt issued a written decision on April 9, 2020 denying the request for writs of habeas \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 10 of 87 PageID #:1943\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\ncorpus and partially, but not entirely, granting the motion for a TRO.  Mays, 2020 WL \n1812381, at *6, 14–16.  In ruling on this motion, the Court considered the affidavits from \nmedical experts, individuals who had spoken to detainees, and those from Jail officials \nand employees.  The Sheriff had raised a hearsay objection to the Court's consideration \nof the affidavits from individuals who had spoken to detainees, but hearsay may be \nconsidered in ruling on a motion for a TRO or for a preliminary injunction.  See SEC v. \nCherif, 933 F.2d 403, 412 n.8 (7th Cir. 1991).3  The TRO directed the Sheriff to take the \nfollowing actions: (1) establish and implement a policy requiring prompt testing of \nsymptomatic detainees, and—if medically appropriate and feasible based on the \navailability of testing materials—detainees who may have been exposed to the virus; \n(2) implement social distancing during intake and suspend the use of bullpens to hold \ndetained persons awaiting intake; (3) provide all detained persons with adequate soap \nor sanitizer for hand hygiene; (4) provide staff personnel and detained persons with \nadequate cleaning supplies to regularly sanitize surfaces and objects, including in high-\ntraffic areas such as shower facilities; (5) establish a policy requiring frequent sanitation \nof these areas; and (6) provide facemasks to all detained persons in quarantine.  Mays, \n2020 WL 1812381, at *14–15.   \nThe Court denied several of the plaintiffs' requests for relief.  They sought an \norder mandating social distancing throughout the facility, not just at intake, arguing that \n                                            \n3  \"Given its temporary nature, 'a preliminary injunction is customarily granted on the \nbasis of procedures that are less formal and evidence that is less complete than in a \ntrial on the merits.'\"  FTC v. Lifewatch Inc., 176 F. Supp. 3d 757, 761 (N.D. Ill. 2016) \n(quoting Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981)).  The same, of course, \nis true of a TRO. \n \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 11 of 87 PageID #:1944\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nthis was one of the critical outbreak control measures outlined in the CDC Guidelines.  \nId. at *10.  The Court declined to mandate social distancing beyond intake, reasoning \nthat there are space constraints at the Jail and the Guidelines expressly recognized that \nsocial distancing may not be feasible in a correctional facility.  Id.  The Court also \ndeclined the plaintiffs' request for direct screening of medically vulnerable detainees \nbefore they show symptoms of infection, also because the CDC Guidelines did not \nmandate this.  Id.  In addition, the Court denied the plaintiffs' request to require the \nSheriff issue facemasks to every detained person, as the CDC Guidelines \nrecommended this only for those who had come into contact with a symptomatic \nindividual.  Id. at *12, 15.  Finally, the Court declined the plaintiffs' request to transfer the \nmembers of subclass B to a safe facility or other forms of custody, because the plaintiffs \nhad failed to show that the other protective measures that the Court had ordered would \nbe inadequate to protect detained persons from the health risks associated with the \ncoronavirus outbreak.  Id. at *15. The Court also declined subclass A's request for \nemergency writs of habeas corpus, concluding that they had failed to exhaust available \nstate court remedies.  Id. at *6.  \nB.  The Sheriff's response and current conditions at the Jail \n  1.  April 13 status report \nOn April 13, pursuant to the Court's direction, the Sheriff filed a status report \nregarding compliance with the TRO.  First, with respect to the directive to test \nsymptomatic detainees, the Sheriff reported that Cermak Health Services, an arm of \nCook County that provides healthcare to persons detained at the Jail, maintains the \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 12 of 87 PageID #:1945\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nsupplies for medical testing and actually administers such tests.4  According to the \nSheriff, Cermak had determined that it would not be medically appropriate to test all \ndetained persons in quarantine.  The Sheriff therefore instructed his personnel to isolate \nand refer symptomatic detainees to Cermak for further evaluation and testing.   \nAs to the order to maintain social distancing during the Jail's intake process, the \nSheriff implemented a modified procedure that maintains six feet of distance between all \ndetained persons awaiting intake and provides them with facemasks.  Use of the \nbullpens was discontinued. \nRegarding the order to distribute facemasks, the Sheriff stated that he had \nacquired and on hand sufficient surgical masks to distribute to all quarantined detainees \nand employees and that he was continuing his efforts to obtain additional masks.  \nAdditionally, the Sheriff was in the process of procuring cloth masks that would be \navailable to any detained person who requested one.   \nThe Sheriff further reported that on April 9, he delivered approximately 28 gallons \nof hand sanitizer and 980 bars of soap for distribution in the Jail.  He also ordered \ndistribution of soap and sanitizer twice per week going forward.  The Sheriff noted \nconcern that some detained persons may use the soap or hand sanitizer as a weapon \nand that some might try to consume hand sanitizer.  These considerations required the \nSheriff to determine on a detainee-by-detainee basis whether to distribute hand \nsanitizer or soap. \nWith respect to the sanitation-related directives in the TRO, the Sheriff reported \n                                            \n4 From a chain-of-command standpoint, Cermak is under the control of Cook County, \nnot the Sheriff. \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 13 of 87 PageID #:1946\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nthat he had distributed cleaning supplies to staff and detained persons on April 10.  He \nalso issued a sanitation policy to ensure that frequently touched areas such as \ndoorknobs and phones are sanitized between uses.  He issued another a policy \nrequiring each living unit officer to ensure that surfaces are routinely cleaned and \nsanitized during the officer's shift.  Additionally, the Sheriff stated that he was planning \nto hire an independent contractor to professionally clean the Jail. \n  2.  April 17 updates from the Sheriff \nOn April 17, three days after the Sheriff submitted his status report, officials from \nthe Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH), including one designated as a CDC \nepidemic intelligence service officer, inspected the Jail.  These officials had toured the \nJail roughly a month prior, on March 20, and issued recommendations for controlling \nCOVID-19 at the Jail.  A report from this inspection, dated March 27, was introduced in \nconnection with the preliminary injunction hearing held on April 23.  The March 27 \nrecommendations from the CDPH included screening and classifying inmates based on \ntheir level of risk associated with coronavirus disease and \"considering mass release of \ninmates to decompress the jail for urgent public health reasons.\"  Levin Dec. (dkt. no. \n70) at 10.   \nA report from the more recent April 17 had not yet been received by the Sheriff \nas of the April 23 hearing.  The Sheriff therefore submitted statements and testimony \nfrom two Jail officials who participated in the April site visit: Rebecca Levin, a senior \npublic health advisor to the Sheriff, and Michael Miller, the Executive Director of the \nCook County Department of Corrections.  Levin stated that during the April 17 \ninspection, the officials commended the Jail's efforts to reduce density in housing units.  \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 14 of 87 PageID #:1947\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nMiller testified that the officials visited two of the dormitory units—Dorm 4, the largest \ndormitory unit, and Dorm 2—and commented positively about the organization and \ncleanliness of these spaces.   \nIn a declaration dated April 17, Miller also provided an update to the Sheriff's \nApril 14 status report on efforts to control the coronavirus outbreak at the Jail.  He \nreported that each person detained in a quarantine tier was receiving a new surgical-\ntype facemask each day.  Miller anticipated that at its current rate of consumption of \nmasks, the Sheriff would exhaust his supplies on June 7, 2020.  He added that, \"as \nsupplies permit,\" the Sheriff planned to distribute masks to detainees who are not on \nquarantine tiers.  Miller Dec., Def.'s Resp. to Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj., Ex. E (dkt. \nno. 62-5) ¶ 24. \nAlthough the TRO did not require the Sheriff to implement social distancing \nbeyond modifying his intake procedures, Miller reported in his April 17 affidavit that the \nSheriff had engaged in a significant effort to increase social distancing at the Jail.  \nSpecifically, he reported the following measures: opening previously closed divisions to \nbetter distribute detainees across available space; converting housing on 175 tiers to \nsingle-occupancy cells only; limiting dormitory units to fifty percent of capacity, with the \nexception of detainees in medical or \"restricted housing,\" id. ¶ 12; and limiting the \nnumber of detained persons released into dayroom common areas to half the number \nassigned to that area.  He reported that beds in dormitory units have been spaced so \nthat they are at least six feet apart, and if beds are bolted to the floor, then detained \npersons are distributed so that there is six feet of distance between occupied beds.   \nAttached to Miller's declaration was a spreadsheet with the occupancy rates as of \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 15 of 87 PageID #:1948\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nApril 17 on each tier of the Jail, including units in Cermak and Division 8, the Residential \nTreatment Unit (RTU).  Miller later explained that the RTU provides twenty-four-hour \naccess to medical care and houses people who have medical needs (though the level of \nneed was not described).  This spreadsheet showed, apparently contrary to the \nstatement in Miller's declaration, that some dormitory units were still occupied above \nfifty percent capacity.  For example, Tier D of Dorm 1 in Division 2, which was not then \nunder quarantine, was occupied at eighty-one percent capacity.  In addition, many \ndormitory units in the RTU, Division 8, were occupied at nearly full capacity.  For \nexample, Tier 2F was occupied at ninety-seven percent capacity, and Tier 2G was \noccupied at one hundred percent capacity.  (Also, Tiers 2Q and 2R in Division 6 were \noccupied at sixty percent and sixty-three percent capacity, respectively.  They are not \nlabeled as dormitory units in the spreadsheet, but they each have a forty-person \ncapacity.) \nThe Sheriff submitted additional evidence reflecting that his ability to implement \nsocial distancing had increased by virtue of, among other things, a significant expansion \nof the electronic home monitoring program.  He offered a chart showing a steady \ndecline in the Jail's daily population over the previous month, including a reduction of \nroughly 230 detainees between April 9, when the Court issued the TRO, and April 17.  \nAnother chart showed a steady increase in the jail's electronic home monitoring \npopulation over the previous month, with an increase of approximately 300 detainees on \nelectronic home monitoring between April 9 and April 17.  The Sheriff also offered \nevidence, however, that utilization of this program had been extended to its outside \nlimits, or nearly so, in light of the apparent exhaustion of program vendor's supply of \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 16 of 87 PageID #:1949\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nmonitoring equipment.   \n3.  Plaintiffs' reports regarding conditions at the Jail \nIn anticipation of the preliminary injunction hearing, the plaintiffs submitted a \nnumber of affidavits identifying problems or deficiencies in the Sheriff's compliance with \nthe directives in the TRO.  These affidavits were from individuals who had spoken to \ndetained persons between April 14 and April 18, and they described these persons' \ncurrent experiences at the Jail.  According to these affidavits, symptomatic individuals \nare not being tested.  Additionally, although facemasks are now being distributed, \ndetainees reported, it is not happening regularly. \nThe detained persons discussed in the affidavits also reported inadequacies in \ncleaning and sanitation practices at the Jail.  Several stated that detained persons lack \ncleaning supplies for their individual cells and that some common spaces lack cleaning \nsupplies as well.  And even where cleaning solution is available, they reported, cloths or \nwipes have not been provided to enable use of the solution.  A number of detainees \nalso reported that commonly used objects, such as telephones, are not being sanitized \nbetween uses.  In addition, they stated, the Jail's staff has not been cleaning cells, and \nsome common areas are cleaned only every other day, meaning they stand uncleaned \ndespite multiple uses and repeated touching by numerous detained persons and \npotentially staff personnel. \nThe detainees also reported an inability or great difficulty in practicing social \ndistancing.  In common areas where detained persons eat, several stated, it has been \nimpossible to practice social distancing due to the arrangement of picnic-style benches.  \nTape or paint markings have been placed on the floor in some dayrooms to designate \n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 17 of 87 PageID #:1950\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nappropriate space for social distancing, but, they reported, some correctional officers \nhave mocked the practice of social distancing, and many have failed to enforce it.  By \nway of example, detained persons have been using, at the same time, telephones that \nare spaced only two feet apart.   \nC.  The renewed preliminary injunction motion \n  In their renewed motion for a preliminary injunction, filed on April 14, 2020, the \nplaintiffs contend that the Sheriff's efforts in response to the TRO \"have not worked and \ncannot work to abate the spread of the disease\" caused by the coronavirus.  Pls.' \nRenewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 55) at 4.  The plaintiffs focus primarily on two \ninadequacies of the Sheriff's efforts to date:  failure to identify and transfer medically \nvulnerable detainees out of the Jail, and insufficient social distancing, which, the \nplaintiffs contend, \"is the only way to prevent intolerable risk to [their] health and lives.\"  \nId. at 2.  \nThe plaintiffs request the following in their renewed motion for a preliminary \ninjunction.  First, they ask for a preliminary injunction ordering the Sheriff to mandate \nsocial distancing throughout the Jail.  In support of this request, the plaintiffs have \nsubmitted the declaration of Dr. Gregg Gonsalves, an epidemiologist at the Yale School \nof Medicine and School of Public Health, who opined that social distancing is \"the only \nway to prevent further, essentially uncontrolled, spread of the virus\" in the Jail.  Id., Ex. \nG (dkt. no. 55-7) ¶ 29.  In the alternative, the plaintiffs argue that if the Court concludes \nthat additional social distancing is not possible, an order should be entered requiring the \nSheriff to transfer detained persons to another safe facility, or the Court should request \nconvening a three-judge panel with the authority to order the release of detainees, as \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 18 of 87 PageID #:1951\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nrequired under the Prison Litigation Reform Act .  See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3)(B).  In \naddition, subclass A has renewed its request for issuance of emergency writs of habeas \ncorpus.5     \nIn response, the Sheriff argues that he has sufficiently addressed the risks to the \nhealth of persons in his custody, in accordance with constitutional requirements, \nthrough the protective measures he has already implemented; his efforts were \nconsistent with the recommendations in the CDC Guidelines; and he has taken \nsubstantial steps to implement social distancing.  The Sheriff also appears to contend \nthat further implementation of social distancing was not realistically possible in the Jail \nat this time.  In response to the plaintiff's contention that the Sheriff has not adequately \nabated the risk of infection to medically vulnerable detainees, he argues that he cannot \nscreen such individuals, because he does not have access to detained persons' health \ninformation.  Furthermore, the Sheriff has explained, he already refers all medical \ncomplaints and issues to Cermak, and nothing more on his part is required to satisfy the \nrequirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nIn their reply brief, the plaintiffs acknowledge that the Sheriff has taken \"dramatic \nsteps\" to increase social distancing in the Jail.

Additionally, the \nplaintiffs ask the Court to convert the TRO to a preliminary injunction. \n1.  Hearing on motion for preliminary injunction \nThe Court held an evidentiary hearing on the preliminary injunction motion by \nvideoconference on April 23, 2020.  In light of the unusually compressed time schedule \nnecessitated by the development of the coronavirus pandemic and increases in \nconfirmed coronavirus infections at the Jail, the Court determined that it would consider \nthe parties' affidavits (giving due consideration to issues regarding weight) and would \npermit each side to call one live witness.  Executive Director Miller testified as the \nSheriff's witness; he offered, among other things, updates to his April 17 affidavit \nregarding the Sheriff's efforts to manage the coronavirus outbreak.   \nWith respect to screening medically vulnerable detainees, Miller testified that the \nJail was doing what it could based on the limited medical information that it has \navailable.  Miller explained that Cermak conducts a medical evaluation of every \ndetained person at intake, and based on this, it transmits information called \"alerts\" to \nthe Jail to inform housing decisions based on medical needs.  These alerts do not \ncontain any diagnostic information; rather, they simply specify the accommodations \nnecessary to address a medical need.  For example, an alert from Cermak may inform \nthe Jail that a detained person should be housed on a bottom bunk, but it will not state \nthe medical reason for this determination.  Miller testified that Cermak has not \"yet\" \ncreated an alert for those who have heightened risk of severe health consequences \n19 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 20 of 87 PageID #:1953\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nfrom a coronavirus infection.  Without such an alert, Miller explained that the Jail is \nconducting coronavirus screening based on any medical information about a detained \nperson that it already has, including existing alerts.   \nMiller also reported that the Jail had made additional efforts to implement social \ndistancing.  To encourage persons housed in dormitory units to stay at their beds rather \nthan congregating in common spaces, the Jail has been providing them with free books, \nwriting pads, and puzzle books.  In addition, Miller stated, detainees throughout the Jail \nare now released to use shared shower facilities one at a time.  In common areas, six-\nfoot intervals have been demarcated with spray paint markings.  Correctional officers, \nMiller said, have been trained to enforce social distancing by first communicating to \ndetained persons the importance of maintaining the distance, and if that fails, using \ndisincentives such as loss of microwave privileges.  Miller acknowledged that despite \nthis, detainees have not always been practicing social distancing and that they continue \nto congregate in common spaces such as eating areas. \nMiller reported that the Jail's staff has worked diligently to increase the Jail's \nability to reduce the density of the population in its housing units.  Over the past month, \nhe stated, the Jail has opened up several hundred additional housing units.  Between \nApril 17 and April 23, the Jail doubled the number of detainees housed in single-\noccupancy cells, and this effort included moving 260 detainees out of double-occupancy \ncells.  Miller stated that there are currently no detainees housed in double-occupancy \ncells without a medical or security reason.  Most of those who are still in double-\noccupancy cells, he said, are either housed by Cermak or are designated by Cermak as \nrequiring placement in a double-occupancy cell due to a health condition or possible \n20 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 21 of 87 PageID #:1954\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nsuicide risk.  Miller did not explain why a health condition might require placement in a \ndouble-occupancy cell.  Some of those in double-occupancy cells have been placed \nthere, he said, due to disorderly conduct—though, again, he did not explain how double-\ncelling serves a security purpose in such situations.  Miller acknowledged on cross \nexamination that social distancing is impossible for persons housed in double-\noccupancy cells. \nMiller also reported that roughly 1,000 detainees are still being housed in \ndormitory units.  He stated that approximately seventy percent of that population must \nremain in those units due to a medical need, though he did not explain this.  As for the \nremainder, Miller cited one possible non-medical reason that some detainees must \nremain in dorm units: they are housed there in accordance with requirements of the \nPrison Rape Elimination Act.  He explained that it would be \"very challenging to try to \nseparate those individuals and keep them protected as we need to under the PREA Act \nso that those individuals are not vulnerable in other areas while they're incarcerated.\"  \nApril 23, 2020 Tr. at 46–47.  Again, however, Miller did not explain this. \nMiller supplemented his testimony with an updated spreadsheet showing the \noccupancy of the Jail's housing units as of April 23.  This spreadsheet showed that the \ncapacity of almost every tier that was not in Cermak, the RTU, or under quarantine was \nfifty percent or below.  However, in Division 2, Tier D1-D was at eighty-one percent \ncapacity, and Tier D4-R was at fifty-nine percent (Tier D3-B was right at fifty percent).  A \nnumber of Cermak and RTU tiers had occupancy rates as high as ninety-seven or one \nhundred percent.   \nOn cross examination, the plaintiffs' counsel asked Miller about the high \n21 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 22 of 87 PageID #:1955\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\noccupancy levels in certain Cermak and RTU tiers reported in the April 17 and April 22 \nspreadsheets.  Miller explained that Cermak needed to house those individuals together \nto be able to provide them with access to care at all hours of the day or night.  Miller \nacknowledged that social distancing was not possible for those housed in the Cermak \nand RTU tiers.   \nPlaintiffs' counsel also asked Miller about a high occupancy rate listed in the April \n17 spreadsheet for a tier (referenced above) that was not in Cermak, the RTU, or under \nquarantine: Tier D of Dorm 1 in Division 2, which was then at eighty-one percent \ncapacity.  The April 22 spreadsheet showed that the dorm was still at the same \ncapacity.  Miller stated: \"There's another security level and/or issue with having this \nmany people on this tier that we've had to abide by.\"  Id. at 31.  He did not clarify the \nnature of the security issue.  Miller acknowledged that social distancing was not \npossible for detainees on that tier.   \nWhen the Court asked Miller if there was still room at the Jail to move more \ndetainees out of dorms and into cells, Miller responded, \"I do have a plan in my back \npocket.\"  Id. at 57.  He explained that he was working on moving people out of Dorms 1, \n2, and 3.  He added that the Jail is considering reconfiguring housing arrangements on \ntiers for detainees who are women to see if there is a way to create more capacity, \npresumably to disperse the much larger population of detainees who are men.   \n  As for cleaning and sanitation of common areas, Miller reported that detainees \nhave been given the supplies they need to do sanitation; he attributed shortfalls in \nsanitation to their own behavior.  For example, he stated, at each microwave stations \nand shared showers and toilets, detained persons have been provided cleaning solution \n22 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 23 of 87 PageID #:1956\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nso that they can sanitize the facility prior to use.   \n  Finally, Miller stated, to ensure implementation of its response measures, such \nas sanitation of common areas or use of PPE, the Sheriff has deployed \"audit teams\" \nthat oversee these efforts.  For example, the Jail has a PPE audit team that patrols PPE \nuse and educates staff members and detained persons who are not using PPE \nproperly. \nPlaintiffs called as their hearing witness Dr. Homer Venters, a medical doctor \nwith over a decade of experience in correctional health.  Dr. Venters is the former \nDeputy Medical Director of the New York City Jail Correctional Health Service, a \nposition in which he oversaw care of detainees and medical policies governing care in \nNew York City's twelve jails.  He had previously submitted a declaration along with \nplaintiffs' preliminary injunction reply brief.  At the hearing, he testified that, in his view, \nthe Jail's coronavirus response efforts have three key deficiencies: (1) lack of a \ncohesive coronavirus response plan; (2) failure to screen for individuals at higher risk of \nexperiencing severe health consequences from a coronavirus infection; and \n(3) insufficient social distancing.   \nFirst, Dr. Venters explained that having a cohesive plan, rather than a collection \nof policy documents that address different aspects of emergency response, is a critical \nfirst step to addressing an outbreak of a communicable disease in a jail facility.  He \nstated that because jails are such complex systems, employing and housing several \nthousand people, it is not possible to respond to a large outbreak without a single, \ncoordinate plan that coordinates response measures implemented by security, health, \nand administrative staff.   \n23 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 24 of 87 PageID #:1957\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nSecond, Dr. Venters testified that screening medically vulnerable individuals is \ncritical so that they can immediately receive heightened surveillance of possible \nsymptoms of a coronavirus infection.  This heightened surveillance would entail daily \nchecks on those individuals for symptoms such as elevated temperature, shortness of \nbreath, and fatigue.      \nThird, Dr. Venters emphasized the importance of social distancing in combatting \nthe spread of coronavirus.  In his declaration, Dr. Venters stated that medical literature \non the coronavirus confirms that social distancing is an essential strategy in controlling \nan outbreak.  During the hearing, he explained that because the coronavirus spreads so \neasily through respiratory droplets emitted from an infected person, transmission \"is \ngreatly impeded by physical distance that we establish through social distancing.\"  Id. at \n67.   \nDuring his testimony, Dr. Venters emphasized that practicing social distancing \nonly in some specific areas of a congregate setting like the Jail is insufficient to curb \nvirus transmission rates.  Because people are densely packed in many contexts during \nroutine operations of a detention facility—e.g., sleeping areas, dayrooms, shower \nfacilities, and areas where medication is dispensed—it is critical to implement social \ndistancing throughout the entire facility.  Dr. Venters explained that a \"lack of a full \ncommitment or complete commitment to social distancing\" in the Jail would promote \nfaster transmission of the coronavirus, and more detainees and staff would become \n\"seriously ill.\"  Id. at 74.  In his declaration, Dr. Venters had observed that the concern \nabout severe health effects is heightened when considering detainees, because they \nare statistically more likely than the general public to have pre-existing health problems \n24 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 25 of 87 PageID #:1958\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nsuch as cardiovascular disease and cancer. \nDr. Venters also discussed the importance of communication with detainees and \nstaff as a means to ensure that they practice social distancing in an appropriate way.  \nSpecifically, he said, to ensure widespread observance of this practice, individuals must \nunderstand what social distancing means and why it is important.   \n On cross examination, Dr. Venters acknowledged that outbreak management in \na correctional setting imposes \"unique challenges,\" id. at 79, and that the CDC \nGuidelines are \"now the most important set of principles\" on response, id. at 81.  He \nalso acknowledged that the CDC Guidelines provide that social distancing might not \nalways be feasible in a correctional setting.   \nDr. Venters testified that although use of single-occupancy cells facilitates social \ndistancing, doing so poses a risk of increasing detainees' psychological distress from \nsocial isolation.  He also testified that the Jail's practice of housing detainees with \nmental health conditions in double-occupancy cells is inappropriate, because they \ncannot practice social distancing at all.  Though these two concerns point in opposite \ndirections, Dr. Venters reconciled them by clarifying that, in the current pandemic \nenvironment, housing detainees in single-occupancy cells is preferable to double-\noccupancy because social distancing is critical.  To address the psychological toll of \nisolation in single-occupancy cells, Dr. Venters testified, the Jail should provide \nopportunities for detained persons to come out of their cells and benefit from \nengagement with others in common areas while practicing social distancing.   \nDr. Venters's testimony largely buttressed the points made by several other \nmedical doctors and epidemiologists in affidavits and declarations that the plaintiffs had \n25 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 26 of 87 PageID #:1959\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nattached to their complaint and briefing of this motion.  The plaintiffs' medical, public \nhealth, and correctional health experts have analogized the conditions in the Jail to \nthose on cruise ships, which have experienced some of the largest concentrated \noutbreaks of the coronavirus.  Specifically, these experts observe, a jail, like a cruise \nship, is an environmentally enclosed, congregate-living setting with high levels of \nmovement of people.  Mohareb Dec., Pls.'

The Diamond \nPrincess sailed from Japan to Hong Kong in January of this year.  After one of its \npassengers tested positive for the coronavirus in the last week of January, \"strict \nprecautions of hand hygiene and cabin isolation were implemented for all crew and \npassengers.\"  Mohareb Dec. (dkt. no. 64-3) at 5.  Despite these efforts, 700 of the \npeople who had been on the ship tested positive for the virus over the course of the \nfollowing month.  This example, Dr. Mohareb, said, reflects that in the context of a \ncongregate living arrangement like a cruise ship, hand hygiene and cabin cell isolation \nare insufficient to control the transmission of the coronavirus.  He stated that a jail, \nwhich is similarly a congregate environment, \"constitutes an equal or greater risk setting \nto that of a cruise ship.\"  Id.   \nDr. Mohareb explained that because respiratory droplets emitted by an infected \nperson can travel up to six feet and be inhaled by another, social distancing is \"a \n26 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 27 of 87 PageID #:1960\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nnecessary intervention to prevent the spread of infection\" from the coronavirus.  Id. at 3, \n6.  He emphasized that social distancing is particularly important because an infected \nperson may be mildly symptomatic or not symptomatic at all.  Dr. Mohareb also noted \nthat numerous authoritative bodies, including the CDC, the World Health Organization, \nand the Infectious Diseases Society of America, have recommended social distancing \nto control the transmission of coronavirus.  He added that mathematical modeling \nsupports a conclusion that social distancing is \"the primary means by which individuals \ncan be safely protected from the threat of COVID-19.\"  Id. at 5.   \nAll of the plaintiffs' expert affidavits emphasized the critical need to implement \nsocial distancing in order to meaningfully control the spread of the virus.

C (dkt. no. 64-4) \n¶ 9.  They reiterated Dr. Venters's point that the very design of a correctional facilities \npromotes transmission of the coronavirus because it densely packs large groups of \npeople together.  Dr. Gonsalves stated that although correctional facilities are like cruise \nships in that they are enclosed environments, they present an even higher risk of rapid \ntransmission of the coronavirus because of \"conditions of crowding, the proportion of \nvulnerable people detained, and often scant medical care resources.\"  Gonsalves Dec. \n¶ 17.  In a joint declaration, five medical doctors with experience working in a \ncorrectional setting—including three doctors who had worked at the Jail—similarly \nobserved that the \"crowded congregate housing arrangements\" of jails and prisons \npromote the transmission of respiratory illnesses like the coronavirus disease.

According to Dr. \nGonsalves, \"young and healthy individuals may be more susceptible than originally \nthought.\"  Gonsalves Dec. ¶ 5.  He reported that in March, the CDC reported that one-\nfifth of infected people between the ages of twenty to forty-four had been hospitalized.  \nDr. Mohareb also stated that \"a fraction of patients with COVID-19 in all groups go on to \ndevelop severe respiratory disease.\"  Mohareb Dec. at 1. \nAt the conclusion of the April 23 preliminary injunction hearing, the Court \nextended the TRO, which was set to expire that day, pending its ruling on the motion for \na preliminary injunction.   \nDiscussion \n  \"A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy.\"  Whitaker ex rel. Whitaker \nv. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034, 1044 (7th Cir. 2017).   \nA court's determination of whether to issue a preliminary injunction or temporary \nrestraining order involves a two-step inquiry, with a threshold phase and a balancing \nphase.  Id.  First, the party seeking the preliminary injunction has to make a threshold \nshowing, which has three elements: (1) reasonable likelihood of success on the merits \nof the claim; (2) irreparable harm to the movant absent preliminary injunctive relief; \n(3) lack of adequate remedies at law.  Id.  If the movant makes the threshold showing, \nthe court proceeds to the balancing step, in which it determines \"whether the balance of \nharm favors the moving party or whether the harm to other parties or the public \n28 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 29 of 87 PageID #:1962\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nsufficiently outweighs the movant’s interests.\"  Id. \nBecause they request relief that changes the status quo or requires the Sheriff to \ntake affirmative action, the plaintiffs are requesting what is sometimes referred to as \n\"mandatory\" preliminary injunctive relief.  See Graham v. Med. Mut. of Ohio, 130 F.3d \n293, 295 (7th Cir. 1997); O'Malley v. Chrysler Corp., 160 F.2d 35, 37 (7th Cir. \n1947); cf. Schrier v. Univ. Of Co., 427 F.3d 1253, 1260 (10th Cir. 2005) (\"[D]etermining \nwhether an injunction is mandatory as opposed to prohibitory can be vexing.\").  \nMandatory preliminary injunctions typically are \"cautiously viewed and sparingly \nissued.\"  Graham, 130 F.3d at 295 (quoting Jordan v. Wolke, 593 F.2d 772, 774 (7th \nCir. 1978)); see also Knox v. Shearing, 637 F. App'x 226, 228 (7th Cir. 2016).  But \n\"there may be situations justifying a mandatory temporary injunction compelling the \ndefendant to take affirmative action\" based on the circumstances, Jordan, 593 F.2d at \n774, and \"the clearest [of] equitable grounds,\" W. A. Mack, Inc. v. Gen. Motors Corp., \n260 F.2d 886, 890 (7th Cir. 1958).  At least two courts have recognized the unusual \nnature of mandatory preliminary injunctions and yet issued them after finding violations \nof the rights of people in custody during the coronavirus pandemic.  See Barbecho v. \nDecker, No. 20-CV-2821 (AJN), 2020 WL 1876328, at *2, 8–9 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 15, 2020); \nJones v. Wolf, No. 20-CV-361, 2020 WL 1643857, at *2, 14–15 (W.D.N.Y. Apr. 2, \n2020). \n  In assessing each claim, the Court will address the first threshold requirement for \na preliminary injunction: likelihood of success on the merits, which requires showing \nonly a \"better than negligible\" chance of success.  Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1046 (quoting \nCooper v. Salazar, 196 F.3d 809, 813 (7th Cir. 1999)).

The Court first addresses the issue of exhaustion of remedies and then \nconsiders subclass A's ability to satisfy the criteria for a representative action. \n  1.  Exhaustion \n  As the Court concluded in its TRO decision, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2241 is the appropriate mechanism for a state pretrial detainee to \nchallenge his or her detention.  Jackson v. Clements, 796 F.3d 841, 843 (7th Cir. 2015).  \n\"Because a pre-trial detainee is not yet in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State \ncourt, relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 is not available.\"  Id. (internal quotation marks \nomitted). \n  Section 2241 has no express exhaustion requirement, but courts apply a \ncommon-law exhaustion rule.  Richmond v. Scibana, 387 F.3d 602, 604 (7th Cir. 2004).  \nA pretrial detainee must \"exhaust all avenues of state relief\" before seeking a writ of \nhabeas corpus through a section 2241 action.  See United States v. Castor, 937 F.2d \n293, 296–97 (7th Cir. 1991).  Although there are exceptions, \"the hurdle is high.\"  \nRichmond, 387 F.3d at 604.  In deciding whether an exception applies, courts \"must \nbalance the individual and institutional interests involved, taking into account 'the nature \nof the claim presented and the characteristics of the particular administrative procedure \nprovided.'\"  Gonzalez v. O'Connell, 355 F.3d 1010, 1016 (7th Cir. 2004) (quoting \nMcCarthy v.

Nussle, 534 U.S. 516 (2002)).

The Court declined to \nexcuse exhaustion because it found that the state's existing bond reduction process is \n\"anything but futile\"; the plaintiffs did not show that the process is \"unduly time-\nconsuming in a way that undermines their claimed constitutional rights\"; and they did \nnot show that state courts cannot remedy the type of constitutional violations they raise.  \nId.  \n  After the Court issued its decision, the plaintiffs' counsel learned that Foster had \nsought release in the Circuit Court of Cook County through an expedited bond hearing.  \n(The plaintiffs do not contend that Mays separately sought release in state court prior to \nthe filing of this lawsuit.)  Foster is charged with domestic battery, robbery, and unlawful \nrestraint.  Pls.' Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj., Ex. F (dkt. no. 55-6) at ECF p. 3 of 17.  His \nbail was set at $50,000, requiring him to post $5,000 to be released, which he is unable \nto afford.  Id.  In his motion to reduce bond, he described his serious medical conditions \nand explained that they place him at a heightened risk of becoming critically ill if he \ncontracts coronavirus.  Id. at ECF p. 4–5 of 17.  He also argued that it would violate his \nconstitutional rights to keep him in custody during the coronavirus pandemic.  Id. at ECF \np. 13 of 17.  On April 2, 2020, a state trial judge heard and denied Foster's motion.  See \nid. at ECF p. 16 of 17. \n  The plaintiffs argue that Foster has sufficiently presented his request to the state \ncourts and should not be required to do more.  They acknowledge that he has not \nexhausted all avenues of state relief:  he could appeal the state court's denial of his \nmotion to reduce his bond, but plaintiffs do not contend that he done so.  They argue, \n32 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 33 of 87 PageID #:1966\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nhowever, that the Court should excuse exhaustion based on the futility of an appeal or \nthe Court's equitable authority to excuse exhaustion.  They contend that an appeal \nwould take weeks to pursue, making appellate remedies practically unavailable to him in \nlight of the urgency of the coronavirus pandemic and causing an unreasonable delay \nthat would force him to continue to suffer the alleged harm.  In support of this \ncontention, they offer an affidavit from Lester Finkle, the Chief of Staff to the Cook \nCounty Public Defender, who explains the procedure for interlocutory appeals of denials \nto modify bail.  Pls.' Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj., Ex. C (dkt. no. 55-3).  Under Illinois \nSupreme Court Rule 604(c), before a defendant can file such an appeal, he must file a \nverified motion in the trial court providing certain information about himself.  Id. ¶ 2.  \nOnly after the trial court denies the verified motion can the defendant file an appeal.  Id.  \nThe affidavit submitted by the plaintiffs reflects that this process typically takes two to \nfour weeks.  Id. ¶ 5.  After that, if the appellate court denies the defendant's appeal, he \ncan seek discretionary review in the Illinois Supreme Court.  Id. ¶ 3.  Based on this \ninformation, the plaintiffs argue that their state-court remedies are futile or practically \nunavailable and that requiring them to pursue these remedies would unfairly prejudice \nthem. \n  The plaintiffs' contentions are not persuasive.  Their only evidence, Finkle's \naffidavit, describes how long such an appeal would take under ordinary circumstances.  \nBut here we are not dealing with not ordinary circumstances.  The affidavit does not \nadequately show how the state appellate process would be expected to work for a \nmedically vulnerable detainee claiming that due to a global pandemic that has infiltrated \nthe Jail, he faces immediate risk of serious health consequences unless his bail is \n33 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 34 of 87 PageID #:1967\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nreduced.  We know the state courts are capable of dealing with emergency requests of \nthis type promptly and efficiently; Cook County trial court judges dealt quickly and \nefficiently with hundreds of such requests in late March, and they continue to do so now.  \nThere is no reason to believe that the Illinois Appellate Court would treat such an appeal \nas an ordinary, run-of-the-mill bail issue and would refuse to deal with it promptly.  \nAlthough a court may excuse exhaustion in the unusual case where a state process \nwould cause an unreasonable delay, see, e.g., Gonzalez, 355 F.3d at 1016, the \nplaintiffs have not established that this is so in the present situation. \n  The plaintiffs also contend that the existing bond review processes provide no \neffective remedy for the claims that the class members advance in this case.  \nSpecifically, they contend that the Illinois statute governing bail, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. \nAnn. 5/110-5, does not require state courts to consider a detained person's medical \nhealth in deciding whether to set or reduce the amount of bail and that state judges \nmaking those decisions would not be expected to consider the medical risks at the Jail.  \nBut they point to no evidence that state courts are not permitted to consider detained \npersons' medical conditions, let alone that state courts reviewing bonds are not actively \nconsidering detained persons' medical conditions in light of the coronavirus pandemic.  \nTo the contrary, the evidence in the record suggests that state courts are considering \nthe medical dangers the coronavirus presents to detained persons.  As the Court \nindicated in its TRO decision, between early March and early April 2020, the Jail's \npopulation decreased by over 1,175 detainees, Mays, 2020 WL 1812381, at *6; since \nthen, the population has decreased by at least 300 more detainees, see Def.'s Resp. to \nRenewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj., Ex. A (dkt. no. 62-1) at 1.  An affidavit submitted by the \n34 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 35 of 87 PageID #:1968\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nplaintiffs reflects that this reduction in the Jail's population has occurred, at least in part, \nbecause state court judges have granted bond reductions.  See Pls.' Renewed Mot. for \nPrelim. Inj., Ex. B (dkt. no. 55-2) ¶ 3 (state courts released 719 detainees through an \nexpedited process for bond reconsiderations in light of the coronavirus pandemic).  In \nshort, the contention that state courts cannot or will not consider detained persons' \nmedical conditions in bond review proceedings is unsupported.  Accordingly, the Court \nconcludes that the plaintiffs have not shown that the state courts do not provide an \neffective remedy for detained persons with medical conditions that place them at a high \nrisk of severe illness or death if they contract coronavirus. \n  The plaintiffs also appear to argue that the state courts cannot provide an \nadequate remedy because, they contend, unlike the federal habeas claims in this case, \nstate courts can consider factors other than medical need.  That contention is based on \nan erroneous premise, which the Court will discuss momentarily, that a district court \naddressing a habeas corpus petition challenging jail conditions under section 2241 \ncannot or would not consider other factors such as whether a detainee poses a threat to \npublic safety.  The bottom line is that the plaintiffs have not shown that the bond \nreduction remedy offered by the state courts is any less effective than a federal remedy. \n  For these reasons, the Court concludes—as it did in its TRO decision—that the \nplaintiffs have no likelihood of success on the habeas corpus claim advanced by them \non behalf the representatives of subclass A due to their failure to exhaust available state \ncourt remedies.   \n  2.  Representative action \n  Even if the plaintiffs could establish some likelihood of success on their \n35 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 36 of 87 PageID #:1969\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\ncontention that the failure to exhaust state remedies should be excused, they would be \nunable to satisfy the criteria for a representative action.  Although the Court need not \nactually certify a representative action at this point, before issuing a preliminary \ninjunction it would need to find that the requirements for such an action conditionally \nwould be met.  Mays, 2020 WL 1812381, at *3 (collecting cases).  Because the plaintiffs \ncannot satisfy those requirements, the representative class has no likelihood of success \non the merits. \n  In the Seventh Circuit, the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure that governs class \nactions, Rule 23, does not apply to habeas corpus proceedings.  Bijeol v. Benson, 513 \nF.2d 965, 967–68 (7th Cir. 1975); cf. Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1117 (9th Cir. \n2010).  But representative actions—which are analogous to class actions—on rare \noccasions can be brought in habeas corpus proceedings.  Bijeol, 513 F.2d at 967–68; \nsee also United States ex rel. Morgan v. Sielaff, 546 F.2d 218, 220–21 (7th Cir. 1976); \nKazarov v. Achim, No. 02 C 5097, 2003 WL 22956006, at *8 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 12, 2003); \nUnited States ex rel. Green v. Peters, 153 F.R.D. 615, 619 (N.D. Ill. 1994); Faheem-El \nv. Klincar, 600 F. Supp. 1029, 1033 (N.D. Ill. 1984).  The Seventh Circuit has not \"set \ndown a strict formula which must be mechanically followed\" before people in custody \ncan bring a representative habeas corpus action.  Morgan, 546 F.2d at 221.  Instead, it \nhas suggested that courts can look to the provisions of Rule 23 in determining whether \na representative action is appropriate, though courts need not \"precisely\" comply with \nRule 23.  Id. n.5.  The Court thus finds that Rule 23 is instructive in analyzing whether \nplaintiffs can bring a representative action.  The parties seem to agree; they discuss the \nissue within the framework of Rule 23. \n36 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 37 of 87 PageID #:1970\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\n  To bring a class action, and by analogy a representative action, a plaintiff must \nshow that the proposed class meets the four requirements of Rule 23(a):  \"numerosity, \ncommonality, typicality, and adequate representation.\"  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, \n564 U.S. 338, 349 (2011).  In addition, \"the proposed class must satisfy at least one of \nthe three requirements listed in Rule 23(b).\"  Id. at 345.  The plaintiffs here rely on, or \nanalogize to, Rule 23(b)(2), which applies when \"the party opposing the class has acted \nor refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive \nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\"  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \n  The parties dispute whether subclass A satisfies each requirement of Rule 23, as \napplied to representative actions, apart from numerosity.  The Court discusses each \ndisputed requirement in turn. \n    a.  Commonality \n  To establish that they are likely to satisfy the commonality requirement, the \nplaintiffs must show that there likely \"are questions of law or fact common to\" the \nmembers of subclass A.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  \"That language is easy to misread.\"  \nWal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 349.  \"Commonality requires the plaintiff[s] to demonstrate that \nthe class members have suffered the same injury.\"  Id. at 349–50 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  In addition, \"[t]heir claims must depend upon a common contention\" for \nwhich the \"determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the \nvalidity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\"  Id. at 350.  Thus \"what matters . . . is \nnot the raising of common ‘questions' . . . but rather, the capacity of a [representative] \nproceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.\"  Id. \n37 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 38 of 87 PageID #:1971\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nat 350 (emphasis omitted).   \"Where the same conduct or practice by the same \ndefendant gives rise to the same kind of claims from all class members, there is a \ncommon question.\"  Suchanek v. Sturm Foods, Inc., 764 F.3d 750, 756 (7th Cir. 2014). \n  Subclass A conditionally satisfies the commonality requirement because the \nplaintiffs likely can show that its members \"suffered the same injury.\"  See Wal-Mart, \n564 U.S. at 349–50.  Specifically, the members of subclass A can show that the \nSheriff's response to the coronavirus pandemic gave rise to their habeas claim.  In \naddition, the plaintiffs point to several questions the determination of which, they \ncontend, will resolve issues that are central to the validity of their habeas claim.  For \npurposes of commonality, the Court need consider only one:  whether coronavirus \npresents so severe a risk of harm to some people in the Sheriff's custody such it is \nunconstitutional to confine them in in the Jail.6   In a representative proceeding, a \ncommon answer to that question likely would drive the resolution of the litigation by \nresolving a core issue underlying subclass A's request for a writ of habeas corpus.  \n  The Sheriff contends that subclass A cannot satisfy the commonality requirement \nbecause its members seek habeas corpus relief that would require individual \nproceedings or determinations.  But issues pertaining to the individualized nature of the \ndesired injunctive relief go to the requirements of Rule 23(b), not commonality.  See id. \n                                            \n6 The Court notes that the plaintiffs posed different questions in their motion for class \ncertification than in their reply brief in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction.  \nCompare Pls.' Mot. to Cert. Class (dkt. no. 6) at 7–8 with Pls.' Reply in Supp. of \nRenewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 64) at 21–22.  Which particular question the \nCourt identifies as conditionally satisfying the commonality requirement makes no \ndifference for the purpose of this opinion.  Regardless, at least one question the \nplaintiffs pose in their reply brief would also satisfy the commonality requirement:  \nwhether detainees in the Jail, as a matter of due process, are entitled to practice social \ndistancing consistent with people in the community at large. \n38 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 39 of 87 PageID #:1972\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nat 360–62; Bell v. PNC Bank, Nat. Ass'n, 800 F.3d 360, 379–80 (7th Cir. 2015).  In other \nwords, the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a) does not demand that the relief \nultimately awarded to each plaintiff be the same.  See id.; Suchanek, 764 F.3d at 756 \n(commonality of relief is not essential); In re IKO Roofing Shingle Prod. Liab. Litig., 757 \nF.3d 599, 602 (7th Cir. 2014) (\"[The commonality requirement as discussed in] Wal–\nMart has nothing to do with commonality of damages.\").  Nor is this a case in which the \ncommonality requirement is not satisfied because individual plaintiffs experienced the \nharm in meaningfully different ways.  Cf. Jamie S. v. Milwaukee Pub. Sch., 668 F.3d \n481, 497–98 (7th Cir. 2012) (class of disabled students did not meet commonality \nrequirement where its members likely experienced alleged violations of federal and \nstate law in different ways).  The putative members of subclass A all experienced the \nalleged harm from the Sheriff's response to coronavirus in the same or similar ways, \nspecifically their allegedly increased risk of exposure to the virus.  In addition, all of \nthem raise the same kind of claim, and their claims all involve a common question that \nwould resolve a central issue of that claim.  \n  The Court acknowledges that, in a case raising claims similar to the habeas \ncorpus claims asserted in this one, another judge in this district recently took a different \napproach with regard to commonality.  A putative representative class of convicted \nprisoners in Money v. Pritzker, No. 20-CV-2093, 2020 WL 1820660(N.D. Ill. Apr. 10, \n2020), also sought habeas corpus relief and medical furloughs or home detentions \nunder section 1983 based on an allegedly inadequate response to the coronavirus \npandemic by the director of the Illinois Department of Corrections.  Id. at *1–2.  For the \nsection 1983 claim, the court found the only common question \"apt to drive the \n39 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 40 of 87 PageID #:1973\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nresolution of the litigation,\" id. at *15 (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350), was \"which \nclass members should actually be given a furlough,\" id.  That question did not satisfy \nthe commonality requirement, the court found, because \"individualized determinations\" \nwould be necessary to answer it.  Id.  The court also indicated that the habeas claim \nwould not be \"suitable for representative or class treatment\" because \"release \ndeterminations must be made on an individual basis regardless of the vehicle for \nconsidering and effectuating them.\"  Id. at *21 n.15.    The court did not clarify whether it \nbased its finding that the habeas claim would be unsuitable for representative or class \ntreatment on the commonality requirement or another Rule 23 consideration.  See id. \n  This Court respects the court's decision in Money, which it cites as persuasive \nauthority elsewhere in this opinion.  But to the extent that the court in Money found that \nthe putative classes failed to satisfy the commonality requirement because their \nrequested relief would entail individualized determinations, this Court departs from the \nanalysis in Money.  As indicated, the commonality requirement does not mean that the \nrelief ultimately awarded to each plaintiff must be the same.  Thus whether the release \ndeterminations would need to be made on an individual basis does not factor into the \nRule 23(a) commonality analysis.   \n  The Court concludes, for the reasons stated above, that the putative class \nsatisfies Rule 23(a)'s commonality requirement.  \n    b.  Typicality \n  The Sheriff contends that the putative subclass does not meet Rule 23(a)'s \ntypicality requirement.  He does not explain why, and he is incorrect.  The named \nplaintiffs' habeas corpus \"claim is typical if it arises from the same event or practice or \n40 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 41 of 87 PageID #:1974\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\ncourse of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other [subclass] members and is \nbased on the same legal theory.\"  Lacy v. Cook County, 897 F.3d 847, 866 (7th Cir. \n2018) (alteration omitted).  \"This requirement is meant to ensure that the named \nrepresentative’s claims have the same essential characteristics as the claims of the \nclass at large.\"  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Typicality is satisfied for subclass \nA because the named plaintiffs have alleged the same injurious conduct stemming from \nthe Sheriff's response to the coronavirus pandemic as the other members of the \nsubclass and have advanced the same legal theory as the subclass at large. \n    c.  Rule 23(b)(2) \n  Rule 23(b)(2) is the sticking point for the habeas corpus plaintiffs' attempt to bring \na representative action on behalf of subclass A.  As indicated, Rule 23(b)(2) allows for \nclass certification where \"the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \ngrounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief . . . is appropriate \nrespecting the class as a whole.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  It \"applies only when a \nsingle injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the \nclass,\" not \"when each individual class member would be entitled to a different \ninjunction.\"  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360.   \n  The Sheriff contends that the putative subclass A does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) \nbecause the plaintiffs seek individualized relief.  He suggests that any habeas corpus \nproceeding would need to account for each subclass member's individual \ncircumstances, including, for example, the danger each detainee would pose to the \npublic if released.  The plaintiffs expressly concede that the relief would need to be at \nleast partly individualized.  They contend, however, that this could be achieved through \n41 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 42 of 87 PageID #:1975\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\n\"brief, individual proceedings\" without defeating class certification.

Ill. Nov. 30, 2005), involved individualized proceedings on damages \nunder Rule 23(b)(3), not individualized proceedings for injunctive relief under Rule \n23(b)(2).  See Barnes, 278 F.R.D. at 19–23; Dunn, 231 F.R.D. 367, at 375–78.  Dunn \nalso involved class members who had variations in how they experienced the \nconstitutional violations—an issue the court properly discussed as part of the \ncommonality analysis, not the Rule 23(b)(2) analysis.  See id. at 372.   \n  Even if the plaintiffs did not concede it, individualized proceedings would be \nrequired for writs of habeas corpus that the plaintiffs seek because the Prisoner \nLitigation Reform Act (PLRA) applies to their habeas corpus claims.  Under the PLRA, \nin tailoring any prospective or preliminary injunctive relief \"in any civil action with respect \nto prison conditions,\" a court must \"give substantial weight to any adverse impact on \npublic safety,\" among other considerations.  18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A), (a)(2).  The \nPLRA defines \"civil action with respect to prison conditions\" as \"any civil proceeding \narising under Federal law with respect to the conditions of confinement or the effects of \nactions by government officials on the lives of persons confined in prison, but does not \ninclude habeas corpus proceedings challenging the fact or duration of confinement in \nprison.\"  Id. § 3626(g)(2).  Thus if the plaintiffs' habeas claims constitute civil actions as \ndefined by the PLRA, the Court would need to give substantial weight to the public \nsafety of granting writs, which would require consideration of, among other things, any \ndanger each individual member of subclass A poses to the public. \n43 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 44 of 87 PageID #:1977\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\n  As the Court indicated in its TRO decision, the question of whether detained \npersons can even use a section 2241 petition to challenge the conditions of their \nconfinement has divided courts.

Haynes, 774 F.3d \n467, 469–70 (8th Cir. 2014) (section 2241 petitions may not challenge conditions)).  The \nSeventh Circuit has expressed a \"long-standing view that habeas corpus is not a \npermissible route for challenging prison conditions,\" at least when a prisoner's claim \ndoes not have \"even an indirect effect on the duration of punishment.\"  Robinson v. \nSherrod, 631 F.3d 839, 840–41 (7th Cir. 2011).  But the Seventh Circuit has also noted \nthat \"the Supreme Court [has] left the door open a crack for prisoners to use habeas \ncorpus to challenge a condition of confinement.\"  Id. at 840 (quoting Glaus v. Anderson, \n408 F.3d 382, 387 (7th Cir. 2005)) (citing Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 644–46 \n(2004); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 526 n.6 (1979); Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. \n475, 499–500 (1973)). \n  In the TRO decision, the Court said that it did not need to decide the question of \nwhether the plaintiffs could challenge conditions of confinement in a habeas corpus \nproceeding definitively at the time but stated that were it \"required to address this point, \n[the Court] would not consider it to be an absolute bar to plaintiffs' motion for a \ntemporary restraining order.\"  Mays, 2020 WL 1812381, at *6.  The Court stated that \n\"[t]he plaintiffs' claims, as they have framed them, do bear on the duration of their \nconfinement (they contend, ultimately, that they cannot be held in the Jail consistent \n44 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 45 of 87 PageID #:1978\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nwith the Constitution's requirements), and they are not the sort of claims that are, or can \nbe, appropriately addressed via a claim for damages.\"  Id. \n  But the plaintiffs' claims also bear on the conditions of their confinement:  they \nchallenge the constitutionality of the conditions in the Jail during the coronavirus \npandemic, and they contend that the conditions are so deficient that it is unconstitutional \nfor subclass A to be confined at the Jail.  The Seventh Circuit has not expressly \naddressed whether the PLRA applies to habeas corpus petitions that involve conditions \nof confinement, but it has not foreclosed the application of the PLRA to such petitions.  \nCf. Walker v. O'Brien, 216 F.3d 626, 634 (7th Cir. 2000) (stating that actions \"brought \nunder section 2241 . . . as habeas corpus petitions are not subject to the PLRA\"—but \nnot addressing such petitions that challenge the conditions of confinement); see also \nThomas v. Zatecky, 712 F.3d 1004, 1005 (7th Cir. 2013) (Walker holds, among other \nthings, \"that a collateral attack under § 2241 or § 2254 is not a 'civil action' for the \npurpose\" of the PLRA (emphasis added)).  By specifying that a \"civil action with respect \nto prison conditions . . . does not include habeas corpus proceedings challenging the \nfact or duration of confinement in prison,\" the language of the PLRA appears suggests \nthat it may cover other types of habeas corpus proceedings, including, potentially, those \nchallenging the conditions of confinement.  See Advocate Health Care Network v. \nStapleton, 137 S. Ct. 1652, 1659 (2017) (courts should interpret a statute in a way that \nwould \"give effect, if possible, to every clause and word\").  And at least some courts \naddressing the issue have suggested that the PLRA applies to habeas corpus petitions \ninvolving the conditions of confinement.  See Jones v. Smith, 720 F.3d 142, 145, 145 \nn.3 (2d Cir. 2013) (the PLRA does not apply to \"habeas petition[s] seeking to overturn a \n45 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 46 of 87 PageID #:1979\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\ncriminal conviction or sentence\" but presumably would apply to conditions-of-\nconfinement habeas claims brought under section 2241); Blair-Bey v. Quick, 151 F.3d \n1036, 1042 (D.C. Cir.) (habeas corpus petitions challenging conditions of confinement \n\"would have to be subject to the PLRA's . . . rules, as they are precisely the sort of \nactions that the PLRA sought to address\"), on reh'g, 159 F.3d 591 (D.C. Cir. 1998). \n  Accordingly, the Court concludes that the PLRA applies to the plaintiffs' habeas \ncorpus claim.  The PLRA's mandate that a court \"give substantial weight to any adverse \nimpact on public safety\" before issuing preliminary injunctive or prospective relief thus \nwould apply to the habeas corpus claim.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A), (a)(2).  To do \nso, the Court would need to consider the circumstances of the detained persons and \nany threat they pose to public safety, which plainly would vary from one person to \nanother.  This is a process that would render the claim unsuitable to certification under \nRule 23(b)(2) or its analogy for representative actions.   \n  The plaintiffs also state, in two sentences found at the very end of a small-type, \ntwenty-four-line footnote, that a release order would not require a court to resolve \nindividualized questions regarding safety because such an order would give the Sheriff \ndiscretion on which detained persons to release.  Pls.' Reply in Supp. of Renewed Mot. \nfor Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 64) at 21 n.16.  The plaintiffs make this point with respect to \ncommonality for their section 1983 claim, not on the question of whether the habeas \ncorpus claim may be handled on a representative basis.  They nowhere attempt to \nexplain how the Court could condition the issuance of writs of habeas corpus on \ndetainee-specific decisions made by the Sheriff.  As this Court stated in its TRO \ndecision, \"[t]he issuance of [a] writ of habeas corpus through a section 2241 petition is a \n46 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 47 of 87 PageID #:1980\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nfederal remedy (in other words, it does not depend on state law).\"  Mays, 2020 WL \n1812381, at *7.  Nor could the issuance of a writ depend on subsequent decisions by a \ndetained person's custodian.  The habeas corpus claim proceeds against the custodian \nbased on the fundamental, long-standing rule that a person in custody \"may be liberated \nif no sufficient reason is shown to the contrary.\"  Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. 426, 435 \n(2004) (quoting Wales v. Whitney, 114 U.S. 564, 574 (1885)).  The only remedy \navailable for a habeas corpus claim is liberation of the person in custody.  See id.  It is \ndifficult to imagine a writ of habeas corpus that would tell a jailer to release the \npetitioner—unless he decides it would not be a good idea to do so.  Plaintiffs offer no \nauthority supporting the proposition that a writ of habeas corpus could appropriately be \nissued in this way. \n  In sum, though representative habeas corpus actions do not need to comply \n\"precisely\" with Rule 23, Morgan, 546 F.2d at 221 n.5, the plaintiffs cannot meet the \nrequirements for representative treatment.7  \n  Because the plaintiffs' habeas corpus claims founder on the exhaustion \nrequirement, and because they have not established that the claims may be pursued on \na representative basis, their representative action on behalf of subclass A has no \nlikelihood of success on the merits.  Accordingly, the plaintiffs' request for the Court to \n                                            \n7 The Court acknowledges that this is different from the conclusion it reached in the \nTRO decision, in which it conditionally certified subclass A.  See Mays, 2020 WL \n1812381, at *4.  But that was, of course, a provisional decision.  And even for a non-\nconditionally certified class, a court may alter or amend an order granting class \ncertification at any point before final judgment.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(C); Gen. Tel. \nCo. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160 (1982) (class certification order is \"inherently \ntentative,\" and a district court “remains free to modify it in the light of subsequent \ndevelopments in the litigation\").   \n47 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 48 of 87 PageID #:1981\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nrelease medically vulnerable members of subclass A on unsecured or non-monetary \nbail conditions pending review of their habeas corpus claims is moot. \nB.  Section 1983 claim  \n  The Court next addresses the question of likelihood of success on the plaintiffs' \nsection 1983 claim, dealing with conditional class certification first, followed by the \nmerits.  The Court then addresses certain provisions of the PLRA as applied to the \nsection 1983 claim. \n  1.  Conditional class certification \n  For their section 1983 claim, the plaintiffs seek class-wide relief in the form of a \npreliminary injunction.  But because the plaintiffs only recently filed the lawsuit, there \nhas not yet been a class certification ruling.  As the Court indicated in its TRO opinion, \n\"[t]his does not foreclose the possibility of relief for the plaintiffs at this stage, because a \ndistrict court has general equity powers allowing it to grant temporary or preliminary \ninjunctive relief to a conditional class.\"  Mays, 2020 WL 1812381, at *3 (citing Lee v. \nOrr, No. 13 C 8719, 2013 WL 6490577, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 10, 2013); Al Otro Lado v. \nWolf, 952 F.3d 999, 1005 n.4 (9th Cir. 2020); Gooch v. Life Inv'rs Ins. Co. of Am., 672 \nF.3d 402, 433 (6th Cir. 2012); Howe v. Varity Corp., 896 F.2d 1107, 1112 (8th Cir. \n1990)).  \"Furthermore, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) 'does not restrict class \ncertification to instances when final injunctive relief issues' and permits certification of a \nconditional class for the purpose of granting preliminary injunctive relief.\"  Id. (quoting \nMeyer v. Portfolio Recovery Assocs., LLC, 707 F.3d 1036, 1043 (9th Cir. 2012)). \n  As indicated, to bring a class action a plaintiff must show that the proposed class \nmeets the four requirements of Rule 23(a):  \"numerosity, commonality, typicality, and \n48 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 49 of 87 PageID #:1982\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nadequate representation.\"  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 349.  In addition, \"the proposed class \nmust satisfy at least one of the three requirements listed in Rule 23(b).\"  Wal-Mart, 564 \nU.S. at 345.  The plaintiffs rely on Rule 23(b)(2). \n   As an initial matter, the Court must clarify the scope of the class or subclasses \nfor which the plaintiffs have sought certification.  They assert count 1 under section \n1983 on behalf of all putative members of a class consisting of \"all people who are \ncurrently or who will in the future be housed in the Cook County Jail for the duration of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\"  Compl. (dkt. no. 1) ¶ 60.  In their reply brief in support of \ntheir motion for a preliminary injunction, however, the plaintiffs indicate that they also \nrequest injunctive relief for claims under section 1983 specifically for the putative \nmembers of proposed subclass B, which consists of \"all people who are currently \nhoused on a tier where someone has already tested positive for the coronavirus,\" id. ¶ \n62.  See, e.g., Pls.' Reply in Supp. of Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 64) at 29 \n(requesting the transfer of members of putative subclass B).  Accordingly, the Court \ntakes this as meaning that, with respect the section 1983 claim, the plaintiffs seek \ninjunctive relief on behalf of both the overall class and subclass B. \n  The parties dispute whether the class and subclass B satisfy each requirement of \nRule 23, except for numerosity.  The Court's analysis earlier in this opinion finding that \nsubclass A (the subclass seeking habeas relief) satisfies the typicality and commonality \nrequirements apply to the overall class and subclass B as well.  Specifically, the class \nand subclass B satisfy the commonality requirement because their members \"have \nsuffered the same injury\" and their claims \"depend upon a common contention\" for \nwhich class action proceedings will \"generate common answers apt to drive the \n49 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 50 of 87 PageID #:1983\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nresolution of the litigation.\"  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350 (emphasis omitted).  As with \nsubclass A, the claims members of the class and subclass B raise at least one common \nquestion that satisfies Rule 23(a)'s commonality requirement:  whether coronavirus \npresents so severe a risk of harm to those in the Sheriff's custody that their conditions of \nconfinement are unconstitutional.  For the reasons previously discussed, Rule 23(a)'s \ncommonality requirement does not involve whether each member of the class would be \nentitled to identical relief. \n  The Class and subclass B also satisfy Rule 23(a)'s typicality requirement.  Each \nmember's section 1983 claim arises from the Sheriff's response to the coronavirus \npandemic—\"the same event or practice or course of conduct\"—and \"is based on the \nsame legal theory.\"  See Lacy, 897 F.3d at 866 (alteration omitted).   \n  The Court's analysis under Rule 23(b)(2), however, differs from its analysis \nregarding the habeas corpus claim.  Again, Rule 23(b)(2) allows for class certification \nwhere \"the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply \ngenerally to the class, so that final injunctive relief . . . is appropriate respecting the \nclass as a whole.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  It \"applies only when a single injunction or \ndeclaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class,\" not \"when each \nindividual class member would be entitled to a different injunction.\"  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. \nat 360.  \n  A good deal of the injunctive relief that the plaintiffs seek would provide relief to \nthe entire class via a single order.  Specifically, on behalf of the overall class, the \nplaintiffs request a single order mandating social distancing and/or extending the TRO \nor converting it to a preliminary injunction, which would provide the same relief to each \n50 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 51 of 87 PageID #:1984\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nclass member.  Accordingly, the class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(b) to the \nextent the plaintiffs request relief under section 1983 mandating social distancing and/or \nextending the TRO or converting it into a preliminary injunction. \n  The plaintiffs' requests for prisoner transfers and/or releases on behalf of \nsubclass B, however, likely would entail individual determinations to some degree.  The \nparties do not dispute that the PLRA applies to the plaintiffs' section 1983 claim or that \nthe 1983 claim involves prison conditions.  As discussed earlier with regard to the \nhabeas corpus claim, before granting prospective or preliminary injunctive relief on the \nsection 1983 claim, the PLRA requires the Court to \"give substantial weight to any \nadverse impact on public safety,\" in addition to making other findings.  18 U.S.C. § \n3626(a)(1)(A), (a)(2).  As indicated, the Sheriff contends that these individual \ndeterminations prevent certification under 23(b)(2).  As the Court has discussed, the \nplaintiffs contend (albeit only in a footnote) that a court would not be required to make \nthose individual determinations because a court could grant a single injunction while \ndelegating those questions to the Sheriff.  Pls.' Reply in Supp. of Renewed Mot. for \nPrelim. Inj.  (dkt. no. 64) at 21 n.16; see also Brown, 563 U.S. at 537–38 (three-judge \ncourt adequately considered \"public safety by leaving\" decision \"of how best to comply \nwith its population limit to state prison officials\").  The Court recognizes that analysis of \nwhether the Sheriff may exercise discretion in carrying out a transfer or release order \nmay be different for the section 1983 claim.  Among other differences, a petition for \nhabeas corpus contemplates a singular form of relief with regard to habeas—release \nfrom custody—whereas a court has a broader spectrum of possible relief under section \n1983.  See Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. at 435; Preiser, 411 U.S. at 484–86, 489.  The range of \n51 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 52 of 87 PageID #:1985\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\ninjunctive relief available under section 1983 may allow courts to \"leave details of \nimplementation to [a] State's discretion by leaving sensitive policy decisions to \nresponsible and competent policy state officials.\"  See, e.g., Brown, 563 U.S. at 538.  \nThe Court need not decide that issue now, however, because, as it will explain later in \nthis opinion, at this point it concludes that the predicate under the PLRA for convening a \nthree-judge court or ordering prisoner transfers has not been established.  \n  In sum, the Court conditionally certifies the class to the extent the plaintiffs \nrequest relief under section 1983 requiring social distancing and/or extending the TRO \nor converting it to a preliminary injunction.  The Court declines to decide whether \nsubclass B satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(b) because it is not necessary to do so \nat this time. \n  2.  Likelihood of success on the merits \n  The injunctive relief requests remaining for determination are the class's requests \nto require social distancing throughout the Jail and (it appears) advance identification \nand further screening of detained persons with conditions that make them more \nvulnerable to severe health consequences from coronavirus disease, as well as their \nrequest to convert the TRO to a preliminary injunction.  (The Court addresses in later \nsections the plaintiffs' request to require the Sheriff to transfer detainees out of the Jail \nand to convene a three-judge panel.)   \n  The claims of the class arise under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment.  \"When a state actor [ ] deprives a person of his ability to care for himself \nby . . . detaining him . . . , it assumes an obligation to provide some minimum level of \nwell-being and safety.\"  Johnson v. Rimmer, 936 F.3d 695, 706 (7th Cir. 2019) (quoting \n52 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 53 of 87 PageID #:1986\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nCollignon v. Milwaukee County, 163 F.3d 982, 987 (7th Cir. 1998)).  The Due Process \nClause requires a jailer to provide a pretrial detainee with food, shelter, and basic \nnecessities, including reasonably adequate sanitation, ventilation, bedding, hygienic \nmaterials, and utilities, Hardeman v. Curran, 933 F.3d 816, 820 (7th Cir. 2019), and to \n\"meet[ ] the person's medical needs while he is in custody,\" Johnson, 936 F.3d at 706.  \nMore broadly, the Due Process Clause protects pretrial detainees, who \"have not been \nconvicted of anything,\" Miranda v. County of Lake, 900 F.3d 335, 350 (7th Cir. 2018), \nfrom conditions that \"amount[ ] to punishment.\"  Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. \n2466, 247 (2015) (quoting Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 395 n.10 (1989)); \nHardeman, 933 F.3d at 823.   \n  Here there is no question that the plaintiffs' claims involve conditions that are \nsufficiently serious to invoke the Fourteenth Amendment; the Sheriff does not argue \notherwise.  A pretrial detainee may establish a Fourteenth Amendment violation based \non a condition, or combination of conditions, posing an \"unreasonable risk of serious \ndamage to [his] future health.\"  Henderson v. Sheahan, 196 F.3d 839, 847 (7th Cir. \n1999) (decided under Eighth Amendment \"deliberate indifference\" standard).  See \nHelling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33, 35 (1993) (Eighth Amendment case; \"exposure of \ninmates to a serious, communicable disease\" that poses a risk of future harm is a \ndeprivation sufficiently serious to invoke constitutional protections).  This is precisely \nwhere persons detained in the Jail find themselves.  The coronavirus is indisputably \npresent in the Jail.  And the persons detained there are housed in settings that facilitate \nits transmission.  This is true throughout the Jail, given the close proximity in which even \nsingle-celled detained persons are housed and the fact that they occupy common areas \n53 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 54 of 87 PageID #:1987\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nlike bathrooms, showers, and dayrooms where other inmates congregate or have been \npresent.  And it is particularly true for detained persons who are doubled celled and \nthose who are still housed in the dormitory units, where dozens (or more) spend twenty-\nfour hours per day, or close to it, in the same room.  It is equally undisputed that \npersons are detained in these settings with the knowledge of the Sheriff and his \npersonnel, who have assigned them to live in these quarters while aware of the risks of \nvirus transmission.  All of this, taken together, is sufficient for the plaintiffs to have well \nmore than a \"better than negligible chance,\" see Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1046, of \nestablishing the threshold requirement of their due process claim—conduct that the \nSheriff knows puts detainees at a significant risk of serious harm from coronavirus.  See \nKingsley, 135 S. Ct. at 2472; Miranda, 900 F.3d at 353.  Meeting this threshold \nrequirement of the due process standard does not require an intent to cause harm; it \nrequires only knowledge of \"the physical consequences\" of one's conduct.  Kingsley, \n135 S. Ct. at 2472. \n  The primary dispute before the Court, and the point on which the Sheriff focuses \nhis defense, involves the second requirement of a due process claim.  To succeed on \ntheir claim, the plaintiffs must show that the Sheriff's conduct in addressing the risks \nposed by exposure to coronavirus is objectively unreasonable in one or more respects.  \nSee, e.g., McCann v. Ogle County, 909 F.3d 881, 886 (7th Cir. 2018).  At the \npreliminary injunction stage, however, the plaintiffs are not required to prove this \ndefinitively; they are required only to establish a reasonable likelihood that they will \nultimately succeed in proving it. \n  The plaintiffs concede that the Sheriff and others have taken significant steps to \n54 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 55 of 87 PageID #:1988\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nreduce the Jail's population and to decrease the number of persons housed in groups or \ndouble celled.  They argue, however, that the Sheriff's actions do not go far enough and \nthat detained persons continue to be unreasonably exposed to a risk of serious harm.  \nThe plaintiffs contend that social distancing is not being enforced even in units where \ndetained persons are single celled, given joint usage of showers, toilet facilities, and \ndayrooms.  And, they say, social distancing is not even a possibility for the hundreds \nwho are double celled or remain in dormitory units.  The plaintiffs also contend that \ndespite policies promulgated by the Sheriff, proper sanitation—in particular, frequent \ncleaning of surfaces and facilities used in common, distribution of cleaning materials to \ndetainees, and so on—is not actually being carried out on the ground.  Finally, the \nplaintiffs contend—and it is undisputed—that nothing has been done by the Sheriff to \nenable him to identify, in advance, detained persons with medical or other conditions \nthat make them particularly vulnerable to serious illness should they contract the \ncoronavirus. \n  The Sheriff argues that he and others have taken significant steps to reduce the \nrisk to detained persons from coronavirus.  One critical aspect of this is a very \nsignificant reduction in the overall population of the Jail, accomplished by bond \nreductions issued by judges and by expansion, to its limits, of the Sheriff's electronic \nhome monitoring program.  In addition, in recent weeks, there have been far fewer new \ndetainees admitted on a daily basis than has been the case historically, presumably due \nto fewer arrests.  At the same time, the Sheriff has taken steps to increase capacity, \nincluding by reopening previously shuttered buildings and parts of buildings within the \nJail complex.  Together, these actions have enabled the Sheriff to take further steps to \n55 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 56 of 87 PageID #:1989\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nseparate persons who remain detained in the Jail.  Specifically, a far greater percentage \nof detainees are now in cells by themselves.  And far fewer are housed in the dormitory \nunits than before, with many having been transferred to single-cell units.  In addition, at \nthe Sheriff's direction, detainees have been provided guidance regarding social \ndistancing.  The Sheriff has also instituted policies to enhance sanitation practices and \nto carry out these policies.  He has also implemented the distribution of facemasks to \ncertain detained persons—in particular, those who are in quarantine—consistent with \nthe availability of supplies, and he has undertaken efforts to acquire more.  (Some of \nthis has taken place as a result of the TRO entered on April 9.) \n  It cannot reasonably be disputed that the Sheriff has undertaken a significant, \nand impressive, effort to safeguard detained persons in his custody from infection by \ncoronavirus.  And based on the record, including the testimony of Executive Director \nMiller at the April 23 hearing, the Court is satisfied that the Sheriff and his staff have \nacted in good faith, with the goal of protecting the people placed in his custody, \nconsistent with his obligation to maintain security. \n  Were this an Eighth Amendment case involving convicted prisoners, the efforts \nthe Court has just described likely would be the end of the story.  To prevail in a case \ninvolving a convicted prisoner, a plaintiff is required to show that the prison official was \ndeliberately indifferent to the risk of harm to the plaintiff—in other words, the official \nknew about but disregarded that risk.  See, e.g., Orr v. Shicker, 953 F.3d 490, 499 (7th \nCir. 2020); Garcia v. Armor Corr. Health Serv., Inc., 788 F. App'x 393, 395 (7th Cir. \n2019).  Were the plaintiffs in this case required to make that showing, they would be \nunable to prevail; the Sheriff has been anything but deliberately indifferent to the risk of \n56 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 57 of 87 PageID #:1990\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nharm to pretrial detainees from coronavirus.   \n  But because this is a case involving persons detained prior to an adjudication of \ntheir guilt or innocence, the Sheriff's good intentions are not dispositive of the plaintiffs' \nclaims.  There is a critical difference between a claim regarding conditions of \nconfinement brought by pretrial detainees like the plaintiffs and one brought by a \nconvicted prisoner under the Eighth Amendment, who unlike a pretrial detainee can \nconstitutionally be subjected to punishment.  See Hardeman, 933 F.3d at 824 (Eighth \nAmendment standard is \"more demanding\").  The standard by which a court evaluates \na claim by a pretrial detainee like the plaintiffs \"is solely an objective one.\"  Kingsley, \n135 S. Ct. at 2473.  The plaintiffs are not required to show that the Sheriff had an intent \nto punish or to harm them, id.; indeed, they need not show any sort of malicious or bad \nintent at all.  Rather, what they are required to show—actually, on a preliminary \ninjunction, simply establish a reasonable likelihood of showing—is that the Sheriff's \nconduct with respect to the particular condition has been objectively unreasonable in \none or more respects.  See McCann, 909 F.3d at 886.  In applying this standard, a court \n\"focus[es] on the totality of facts and circumstances\" the defendant faced \"to gauge \nobjectively—without regard to any subjective belief held by the [defendant]—whether \nthe response [to the conditions] was reasonable.\"  Id.   \n  The plaintiffs contend that the Sheriff's response to the coronavirus outbreak at \nthe Jail has not been objectively reasonable or sufficiently protective of the people in his \ncustody, at least with respect to the issues currently before the Court—social distancing, \nsanitation, and identification and monitoring of highly vulnerable detainees.  In \nevaluating the plaintiffs' contentions, the Court assesses objective reasonableness \n57 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 58 of 87 PageID #:1991\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\n\"from the perspective of 'a reasonable [official] on the scene,' based on what the \n[official] knew at the time.\"  Mays, 2020 WL 1812381, at *9 (quoting Kingsley, 135 S. Ct. \nat 2473).  The question, in the present context, is whether the Sheriff \"acted reasonably \nto mitigate the risks to [the] health and safety of detainees.\"  Id. (citing Hardeman, 933 \nF.3d at 825; Darnell v. Pineiro, 849 F.3d 17, 35 (2d Cir. 2017)).  And in determining the \nreasonableness of the Sheriff's actions, the Court \"must account for his legitimate \ninterest in managing the Jail facilities,\" and it must \"defer to policies and practices that \n'are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional \nsecurity.'\"  Id. (quoting Kingsley, 135 S. Ct. at 2473); see Bell, 441 U.S. at 547. \n  The fact of the matter is that the Sheriff's actions have not eliminated the risk to \ndetained persons; far from it.  But this, too, is not dispositive.  Although a jailer must \nmake a reasonable effort to abate conditions that pose an excessive risk to the health or \nsafety of the people in his custody, the fact that he fails to prevent actual harm does not \nmean that his response was unreasonable.  See Dale v. Poston, 548 F.3d 563, 569 (7th \nCir. 2008) (applying Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference standard).  More \nspecifically, the Constitution does not require a detention facility to provide \"foolproof \nprotection from infection\" by a communicable disease.  Forbes v. Edgar, 112 F.3d 262, \n266 (7th Cir. 1997) (applying Eighth Amendment standard); see also Smith v. \nSangamon Cty. Sheriff's Dep't, 715 F.3d 188, 191 (7th Cir. 2013) (applying Eighth \nAmendment standard; \"Prison and jail officials are not required to guarantee [a] \ndetainee's safety.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  That said, the ongoing risk to \ndetained persons at the Jail, confirmed by increases in the number who have tested \npositive for coronavirus and the death of six detained persons from coronavirus disease \n58 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 59 of 87 PageID #:1992\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nas of April 23, is the backdrop against which the Court must view the Sheriff's conduct.   \n  The Court begins with the question of social distancing.  As the plaintiffs see it, a \npolicy that fails to fully implement social distancing throughout the Jail—which \nindisputably has not happened—cannot possibly be considered an objectively \nreasonable response to the coronavirus outbreak there.  At least until full social \ndistancing is enforced, the plaintiffs contend, detained persons face an unacceptably \nhigh risk of death or serious harm to their health. \n  The Sheriff's position is likewise simple and straightforward.  His implementation \nof a coronavirus response plan at the Jail complies, he says, with the CDC Guidelines, \nand for this reason his actions have been objectively reasonable.  The Guidelines, he \npoints out, do not require social distancing in correctional facilities where it is not \nfeasible given physical space, population, and staffing.8  The plaintiffs respond that the \nCDC Guidelines are not a surrogate for constitutional due process requirements.   \n  To support his position that compliance with the CDC Guidelines should \neffectively be dispositive, the Sheriff cites Carroll v. DeTella, 255 F.3d 470 (7th Cir. \n2001).  There the Seventh Circuit held that a convicted prisoner could not show that \nprison officials had been deliberately indifferent to his lack of access to safe drinking \nwater, because radium concentrations in the prison's drinking water were at a level that \nthe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency deemed at the time to be safe.  Id. at 472–\n73.  The court noted that because prisoners are not entitled to better quality of air, \n                                            \n8 Largely based on this aspect of the CDC Guidelines, the Court, in deciding the TRO \nmotion, declined to require the Sheriff to enforce social distancing other than during the \nintake process, one very obvious point at which social distancing was not taking place.  \nThe TRO ruling, however, is neither final nor binding.  The Court has reassessed the \nmatter with the benefit of more thorough briefing and a more complete record. \n59 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 60 of 87 PageID #:1993\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nwater, or environment than the general public, prisons do not have \"a duty to take \nremedial measures against pollution or other contamination that the agencies \nresponsible for the control of these hazards do not think require remedial measures.\"  \nId.  \n  The Sheriff's reliance on Carroll is unavailing.  First of all, the plaintiffs do not \nsuggest any entitlement on the part of pretrial detainees to conditions that exceed \nhealth and safety standards applicable to the general public.  But that aside, the CDC \nGuidelines, unlike the EPA standards relied upon in Carroll, do not say or suggest that \ncompliance makes detained people safe.  This is particularly so in view of the fact that \nthe Guidelines include feasibility qualifiers, particularly in relation to social distancing.  \nSee CDC Guidelines at 1, 3, 4, 11.  Given this limitation, the Guidelines are not the \nsame as a safety standard set by a regulatory agency.  \n  For their part, the plaintiffs suggest that the CDC Guidelines \"shed no light\" on \nwhether the Sheriff's conduct has been objectively reasonable, in conformity with \nconstitutional requirements.  Pls.' Reply in Supp. of Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. \nno. 64) at 10 (quoting Thompson v. City of Chicago, 472 F.3d 444, 454 (7th Cir. 1996)). \nThe Court disagrees with this as well.  The plaintiffs rely to a significant extent on \nThompson.  There the court, considering a claim of excessive force against a police \nofficer—a claim also determined by a standard of objective reasonableness—stated that \na policy on the use of force established by the police department was \"completely \nimmaterial [on] the question of whether a violation of the federal constitution has been \nestablished.\"  Id. at 454.  But later, in United States v. Brown, 871 F.3d 532 (7th Cir. \n2017), the Seventh Circuit clarified that Thompson simply means that a police \n60 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 61 of 87 PageID #:1994\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\ndepartment's own policies do not establish the standard of what is reasonable for \npurposes of the Constitution.  See id. at 537 (\"Despite its strong language, Thompson \nshould not be understood as establishing a rule that evidence of police policy or \nprocedure will never be relevant to the objective-reasonableness inquiry.\").  The court \nexplained in Brown that, in the fact-intensive objective reasonableness analysis, \nevidence of national or widely used police policies could be relevant to helping a \nfactfinder understand how a reasonable officer might have behaved under the \ncircumstances that faced the defendant.  Id. at 538.  The court noted that the relevance \nof such policy evidence may turn on the \"factual complexity\" of the circumstances facing \nthe defendant, and it may be less relevant in circumstances in which a factfinder can \nrely on common sense to determine the reasonableness of conduct.  See id. \n  Here—unlike, perhaps, a relatively simple excessive force claim against an \narresting officer—the circumstances facing the Sheriff in operating the Jail are quite \ncomplex.  In these circumstances, guidance from an expert body like the CDC is \nbeneficial in assessing the objective reasonableness of the Sheriff's conduct in the face \nof an ongoing outbreak.  Indeed, in Forbes, the Seventh Circuit concluded that a \nprison's response to a case of active tuberculosis in its facility had been objectively \nreasonable in part because it had implemented and effected the recommendations of \nthe CDC.  Forbes, 112 F.3d at 267. \n  In sum, the CDC Guidelines are an important piece of evidence to consider in \nassessing the Sheriff's conduct, but they cannot be appropriately viewed as dispositive \nstanding alone.  Indeed, the CDC's recommendations on tuberculosis were not \ndispositive in Forbes; the court also considered other facts—noting, for example, that \n61 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 62 of 87 PageID #:1995\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nthe prison had only one case of active tuberculosis, \"a far cry\" from an outbreak.  Id.  As \nthe Court has indicated, one reason why the CDC Guidelines are not appropriately \nviewed as dispositive of the plaintiffs' due process claims is the way in which they \naccount for feasibility.  Although feasibility may be a consideration in determining \nobjective reasonableness, see Gayton v. McCoy, 593 F.3d 610, 622 (7th Cir. 2010) \n(decided under deliberate indifference standard), no case of which the Court is aware \nsets it as a dispositive factor.  That, however, is exactly what the CDC Guidelines do, at \nleast if read as the Sheriff suggests: they set a feasibility or practicality limitation on \nsocial distancing practices that they also call \"a cornerstone of reducing transmission of \nrespiratory diseases such as COVID-19.\"  CDC Guidelines at 4.  One can certainly \nunderstand why the CDC, a public health body, has acknowledged these sorts of limits \nupon its ability to prescribe guidelines for managing jails.  But from a constitutional-law \nstandpoint, it is difficult to believe that \"do what you can, but if you can't, so be it\"9 \nsatisfies a jailer's constitutional obligation to take objectively reasonable steps to \nmitigate known risks to the life and health of people in his custody who are detained \nawaiting determination of their guilt or innocence. \n  Currently the Sheriff is housing hundreds of detained persons under conditions \nthat make social distancing completely impossible or nearly so, or at least very difficult.  \nThose for whom it is completely impossible are the detainees who are double celled.  \nThose for whom it is at least very difficult and likely impossible are detainees who are \nhoused in dormitory units that are not operating at a greatly reduced capacity.  \n                                            \n9 The Court does not intend by this to suggest that this is the attitude of the Sheriff, the \nExecutive Director, or their staff.  Here the Court is characterizing a legal argument, not \nany person's behavior.   \n62 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 63 of 87 PageID #:1996\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nSpecifically, a significant number of the existing dormitory units are operating at or \ngreater than fifty percent capacity.  Based on the record before the Court, social \ndistancing is practically impossible in such units, and this cannot be completely \nattributed to detainee conduct or misconduct:  if people are kept in groups in relatively \nclose quarters, it is entirely predictable that they will have difficulty maintaining \nseparation.   \n  At the current stage of the pandemic, group housing and double celling subject \ndetainees to a heightened, and potentially unreasonable and therefore constitutionally \nunacceptable, risk of contracting and transmitting the coronavirus.  Such arrangements \nmake it impossible or unduly difficult to maintain social distancing, a \"cornerstone\" of the \nreduction of coronavirus transmission among detainees.  The Court, however, must \naccount for and give deference to the Sheriff's interest in managing the Jail facilities and \nto practices that are needed to preserve order and discipline and maintain security.  See \nKingsley, 135 S. Ct. at 2473; Bell, 441 U.S. at 547.  These include documented \nconsiderations that make group or double celling appropriate or necessary.  Feasibility \nlimitations imposed by existing or otherwise available physical facilities are also taken \ninto account, though this is not and cannot be a controlling factor.  In this regard, it is \nworth noting that despite general statements by both sides to the contrary, it does not \nappear, based on the evidence, that the Sheriff has yet hit the feasibility limit on getting \ndetainees out of group housing, even if one considers only the Jail complex itself.  See \nApr. 23, 2020 Hearing Tr. at 57:2–19 (testimony by Executive Director Miller referencing \nthe possibility of further moves of detained persons out of dormitories). \n  Based on the evidence submitted, the Court finds that the plaintiffs are \n63 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 64 of 87 PageID #:1997\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nreasonably likely to succeed on their contention that group housing or double celling of \ndetained persons is objectively unreasonable given the immediate and significant risk to \ntheir life and health from transmission of coronavirus, except in the following situations: \n•  Persons detained in tiers or dormitories currently under quarantine following a \npositive test for the coronavirus within the tier or dormitory, as this makes it \ninadvisable to transfer them to other housing arrangements until the quarantine \nperiod has expired (what the Sheriff refers to as \"quarantine tiers\"). \n•  Detained persons who have tested positive for the coronavirus and are under \nmedical observation (what the Sheriff refers to as \"isolation tiers\"), a housing \narrangement that the CDC Guidelines specifically authorize. \n•  Detained persons who have tested positive for coronavirus and are recovering \n(what the Sheriff refers to as \"convalescent tiers\"), which the CDC Guidelines \nlikewise authorize. \n•  Double-celled or dormitory-housed detainees for whom there is a documented \ndetermination by a medical or mental health professional that single-celling \nposes a risk of suicide or self-harm. \n•  Persons detained housed in a dormitory unit that is at less than fifty percent \ncapacity, which the record reflects will permit adequate social distancing. \n•  Detained persons committed, at the documented direction of a medical or mental \nhealth professional, to a group housing unit that is equipped for medical or \nmental health treatment, if but only if there is not available space in an \nappropriate housing or medical unit that permits full social distancing.   \nDetained persons housed in any of the listed \"acceptable\" arrangements will, however, \n64 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 65 of 87 PageID #:1998\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nneed facemasks that are replaced at appropriate intervals and must be provided with \ninstruction on how to use a facemask and the reasons for its use.  They also must be \ninstructed, at regular intervals, on the importance of social distancing. \n  The Court has omitted from the list above two categories of detained persons \nreferenced in Executive Director Miller's affidavits and testimony:  persons put into \ngroup housing or double celled because of conduct issues (including those who Miller \nreferred to during his testimony as \"our disorderly . . . population,\" Apr. 23, 2020 Tr. at \n52:6) or for reasons associated with the PREA.  On the record as it currently stands, the \nplaintiffs have a reasonable likelihood of succeeding on a contention that it is objectively \nunreasonable to effectively preclude social distancing for such persons.  With regard to \nPREA detainees, the proposition that they cannot be single celled is counterintuitive, to \nsay the least.10  And with regard to individuals with conduct issues, without more the \nCourt cannot say that there is an objectively reasonable basis to hold them in a setting \nthat does not permit adequate social distancing.  With regard to detained persons in \nthese categories, the Court is willing to entertain a properly-supported request by the \nSheriff to include them in the category of persons who may be appropriately detained in \ngroup housing, perhaps with appropriate distancing. \n  Beyond what the Court has described, the plaintiffs have not established a \nreasonable likelihood of success on their due process claims.  Specifically, the Court is \nnot prepared to say that it is constitutionally inappropriate, in light of the coronavirus \npandemic, to detain persons in the Jail in any form of group housing or to detain them in \n                                            \n10 This is so whether these persons are alleged perpetrators or likely victims, which is \nnot clear from the record. \n65 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 66 of 87 PageID #:1999\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nsingle cells given the likelihood of multiple uses of common facilities and areas.  This \nwould be tantamount to saying that, in the present circumstances, the Constitution \nprohibits detaining people in jails.  The plaintiffs have not established, and are not likely \nto be able to establish, that this is so. \n  Next, the Court addresses the plaintiffs' contentions regarding advance \nidentification of detained persons who are especially vulnerable to severe illness or \ndeath if they contract the coronavirus.  The Court remains unpersuaded that the \nplaintiffs have a reasonable likelihood of showing that this is objectively unreasonable \nand thus violative of those class members' constitutional rights.  The plaintiffs' experts \nopined that screening is important so that vulnerable individuals can be monitored for \nsymptoms.  Miller explained, however, that any person with symptoms consistent with \ncoronavirus disease is already provided immediate screening and treatment, and \nmedical professionals treating such a person will have immediate access to his or her \nmedical records (which include an inventory of medical conditions reported by the \ndetained person upon intake or thereafter).  Though, as the Court stated in its TRO \ndecision, advance identification of persons with heightened vulnerability would appear \nto be a good practice and perhaps a best practice, the plaintiffs have not shown that \nfailing to do so is, under the circumstances, objectively unreasonable. \n  Finally, the Court addresses the plaintiffs' request for extension of the TRO.  The \nTRO required the Sheriff to establish and implement a policy regarding coronavirus \ntesting; provide cleaning supplies to detainees and staff and soap and/or hand sanitizer \nto detained persons; establish and implement a policy regarding sanitization of \nfrequently touched surfaces; and provide facemasks to all detained persons who are \n66 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 67 of 87 PageID #:2000\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nquarantined.  Mays, 2020 WL 1812381, at *14–15.  The plaintiffs ask the Court to \nconvert these requirements into a preliminary injunction.  The Sheriff argues that the \nCourt need not extend or convert the TRO because he has complied with it and \ncontinues to do so. \n  A court \"retains the power to grant injunctive relief\" even after the defendant \nceases the allegedly unlawful conduct.  Milwaukee Police Ass'n v. Jones, 192 F.3d 742, \n748 (7th Cir. 1999); see also United Air Lines, Inc. v. Air Line Pilots Ass'n, Int'l, 563 F.3d \n257, 275 (7th Cir. 2009).  The moving party must show that such relief still is required.  \nMilwaukee Police Ass'n, 192 F.3d at 748.  \"The necessary determination is that there \nexists some cognizable danger of recurrent violation, something more than the mere \npossibility which serves to keep the case alive.\"  Id. (quoting United States v. W. T. \nGrant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633 (1953)); see also United Air Lines, Inc., 563 F.3d at 275 \n(\"The court may consider how easily former practices might be resumed at any time in \ndetermining the appropriateness of injunctive relief.\").  Where the cessation of an \nallegedly wrongful activity occurred \"only after a lawsuit has been filed,\" a district court \nis \"within its discretion\" to find that the cessation was \"not voluntary, and that even a \nvoluntary cessation is not determinative.\"  Id.  \n  Although the Sheriff appears to have complied with the TRO, the Court cannot \nsay that the constitutional violations the Court sought to address will not recur absent an \nextension of the TRO's requirements.  The Sheriff's actions to develop policies on \nsanitation and coronavirus testing, distribute soap and cleaning supplies, and distribute \nfacemasks to detained persons who are quarantined—at least those done after the April \n9 TRO—cannot be said to have been undertaken entirely voluntarily.  Rather, they were \n67 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 68 of 87 PageID #:2001\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\ndone in response to the TRO, and there is at least some evidence of problems in \ncarrying out the TRO's directives.  In addition, without a court order, there is at least a \npossibility that these important measures could slip to the wayside, despite the Sheriff's \nbest intentions, as he works to manage the complexities of the Jail during this public \nhealth crisis.  For these reasons, the Court concludes that it is appropriate to convert \nthe TRO to a preliminary injunction.   \n  3.  Transfer \n  The plaintiffs next request the transfer of members of subclass B out of the Jail \n\"to another safe location in the Sheriff's custody.\"  Pls.' Reply in Supp. of Renewed Mot. \nfor Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 64) at 2.  Until recently, they primarily suggested that such a \nlocation could include \"home confinement or electronic home monitoring.\"  Pls.' Resp. to \nApril 3, 2020 Ord. (dkt. no. 26-1) at 17; see also Pls.' Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. \nno. 55) at 16–17 (requesting transfer without specifying the location to which detained \npeople should be transferred).  But in their most recent reply brief, they suggest that this \nalso could include transfer to \"another correctional space, a hospital or medical facility, \na clinic, [or] administrative furlough.\"  Pls.' Reply in Supp. of Renewed Mot. for Prelim. \nInj. (dkt. no. 64) at 29.  The Sheriff contends that, under the PLRA, only a three-judge \ncourt may order such transfers and that, regardless, he lacks the authority to transfer \ndetainees to electronic home monitoring.  The Court starts with the threshold issue:  \nwhether this Court may, on its own, order the transfer of detained persons as proposed \nby the plaintiffs. \n  As indicated, under the PLRA, \"[i]n any civil action in Federal court with respect \nto prison conditions, a prisoner release order shall be entered only by a three-judge \n68 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 69 of 87 PageID #:2002\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\ncourt.\"  18 U.S.C.§ 3626(a)(3)(B).  The PLRA defines \"prisoner release order\" as \"any \norder, including a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunctive relief, that has \nthe purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison population, or that directs the \nrelease from or nonadmission of prisoners to a prison.\"  18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(4).  It \ndefines \"prison\" as \"any Federal, State, or local facility that incarcerates or detains \njuveniles or adults accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent \nfor, violations of criminal law.\"  Id. § 3626(g)(5).  This definition plainly includes the Jail. \n  The plaintiffs contend that the transfer of detained persons that they seek would \nnot be a prisoner release order because it would simply involve moving them from one \nplace under the Sheriff's control to another place under his control.  That misses the \nmark.  Transfers to home confinement, administrative furlough, or electronic home \nmonitoring in particular—which, at least up until they filed their reply brief, are the \nprimary forms of transfer the plaintiffs have requested—would constitute prisoner \nrelease orders because they would have \"the purpose or effect of reducing [the] \npopulation\" of the Jail.  Id. § 3626(g)(4); Money, 2020 WL 1820660, at *12 (transfers of \nprisoners to temporary medical furlough or home detention within the state's custody \nwould constitute prisoner release orders because \"the PLRA does not focus on \ncustodial status under state law, nor does it say anything about whether the reduction of \npopulation is temporary or permanent.\").  Population reduction is the \"whole point\" of \nthe transfers the plaintiffs seek—they propose to prevent or curb the spread of \ncoronavirus to detained persons, and in particular those who are vulnerable, by \nreducing the Jail's population.  See id. at *13. \n  The transfers sought by the plaintiffs would constitute prisoner release orders for \n69 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 70 of 87 PageID #:2003\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nan additional reason:  they would direct the release of detained persons out of the Jail.  \nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(4).  The plaintiffs contend that, for people confined at home at \nthe direction of a state authority, a home may amount to a prison within the meaning of \nthe PLRA.  To be sure, the list of institutions that qualify as prisons under the PLRA is \nnot limited to those specified in the statute.  Witzke v. Femal, 376 F.3d 744, 753 (7th \nCir. 2004) (confinement in a drug rehabilitation halfway house qualified as confinement \nin a correctional facility under the PLRA).  But, as defined by the PLRA, a prison is a \nfacility.  Id. § 3626(g)(5).  The common definition of a facility is \"a building or \nestablishment that [provides a service or feature of a specified kind].\"11  That does not \nappear to cover a person's home; a home, even one in which a person is residing \nsubject to a court or law enforcement authority's order, is not a place that provides \nspecified services or features.12  It is hard to see the PLRA's definition of \"prison\" \nstretching that far.   In addition, even if home confinement and/or electronic home \nmonitoring constitutes imprisonment under state law (an issue the Court need not \ndecide), an order mandating the transfer of prisoners out of the Jail to confinement in \ntheir homes likely would constitute a prisoner release order because it would \"direct[] \nthe release [of prisoners] from . . . a prison\" to another place of confinement, 18 U.S.C. \n§ 3626(g)(4). \n  The plaintiffs, however, appear to take the position even if prisoner transfers \n                                            \n11 Facility, Oxford English Dictionary Online, \nhttps://www.oed.com/view/Entry/67465?redirectedFrom=facility& (last visited April 26, \n2020).   \n12 Home, Oxford English Dictionary Online, \nhttps://www.oed.com/view/Entry/87869?rskey=8yYRsS&result=1&isAdvanced=false \n(last visited April 26, 2020).   \n70 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 71 of 87 PageID #:2004\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nhave the effect of reducing the prison population, a single-judge court may order them \nwhere the basis for the order is not crowding or overcrowding.  They may be correct.  \nOne of the PLRA's requirements for the entry of a prisoner release order by a three-\njudge panel is that \"crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a Federal right.\"  18 \nU.S.C. § 3626(a)(3)(E)(i).  Some courts have concluded that single-judge courts can \norder the transfers of prisoners, at least to other facilities, where the purpose of the \ntransfer involves the prisoners' medical needs or vulnerabilities.  See Plata v. Brown, \nNo. C01-1351 TEH, 2013 WL 12436093, at *9–10, 15 (N.D. Cal.

This conclusion \nseems correct:  because three-judge courts can order prisoner releases only where \ncrowding is the primary cause of the violation of a federal right, 18 U.S.C. § \n3626(a)(3)(E)(i), to ensure the vindication of people in custody's constitutional rights, the \nPLRA must be read to permit courts to order transfers where some other condition \ncauses the violation of a constitutional right.

See Money, 2020 WL 1820660, at \n*13 (plaintiffs' suggestion that they did not seek a remedy for overcrowding \n\"contradict[ed] the allegations of their complaint and their entire theory of the case\").  To \nput it in simple terms, one of plaintiffs' core contentions is that their constitutional rights \nare being violated because social distancing, which they contend is crucial to protect \ntheir health, has not been or cannot be accomplished at the Jail.  Social distancing is \nessentially the converse of overcrowding.  Thus it is apparent that the plaintiffs' request \nfor prisoner transfers or releases is based on overcrowding.   \n  To be more specific, one of the central allegations in the complaint is that the \ncrowded conditions in the Jail \"ensure the continued[,] rapid, uncontrolled spread of \nCOVID-19 within the Jail and beyond—because the Jail is not and cannot be isolated \nfrom the larger community\" and \"because the Jail is a crowded, congregate \nenvironment.\"  Compl. (dkt. no. 1) ¶ 2; see also, e.g., id. at ¶¶ 20, 25–26, 30–35, 37–41, \n46, 51.  The plaintiffs hinge their legal arguments on the contention that \"without a \nreduction of the Jail's population, the lives and safety of the persons confined there \ncannot be reasonably protected\" because \"social distancing is not possible with the \ncurrent jail population.\"  Pls.'

They contend that the imperative of social distancing is \nan undisputed \"medical necessity\" and that \"[a]ll of the evidence in this record supports \n72 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 73 of 87 PageID #:2006\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nthat proposition.\"  Pls.' Reply in Supp. of Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 64) at 3.  \nAs indicated, they cite evidence from a range of sources—including the CDC, the \ngovernor of Illinois, the City of Chicago, and medical and epidemiological experts—\nreflecting that social distancing is among the most effective and important interventions \nto reduce the spread of coronavirus and protect public health right now.  Id. at 3–5; see \nalso, e.g., Pls.' Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 55) at 4–8.  And, crucially, they \ncontend that social distancing at the jail is impossible because of its current population \nlevels.  Id. at 10 (\"[I]f the current population of a jail unavoidably creates intolerable risk \nto life and health then the current population must change.\"); see also id. at 10–13; Pls.' \nReply in Supp. of Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 64) at 6–8.  In short, the \nplaintiffs are requesting transfers because social distancing is impossible; with that in \nmind, it is incongruous to contend that crowding is not the basis or primary basis for \nseeking compelled transfers.  See Money, 2020 WL 1820660, at *13. \n  Citing United States v. Cook County, 761 F. Supp. 2d 794 (N.D. Ill. 2000), the \nplaintiffs contend that the PLRA applies only to prisoner release orders that are \n\"explicitly related to population caps,\" not to all such orders stemming primarily from \ncrowding.  Pls.' Reply in Supp. of Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 64) at 32 (citing \nid. at 796 –97).  That interpretation stretches the statute's language too far.  Even if \n\"[s]ponsors of the PLRA were especially concerned with courts setting 'population \ncaps,'\" Plata, 2013 WL 12436093, at *10 (quoting Gilmore v. California, 220 F.3d 987, \n998 n. 14 (9th Cir. 2000)), the PLRA's text does not limit prisoner release orders issued \nby three-judge courts to only orders that set population caps, see 18 U.S.C. § \n3626(a)(3)(E).  United States v. Cook County does not suggest otherwise.  The three-\n73 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 74 of 87 PageID #:2007\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\njudge court in that case found \"that overcrowding [was] a primary cause of \nunconstitutional conditions at the jail\" because it caused, among other things, \n\"excessive force by guards, grossly unsanitary and unhealthy conditions, and grossly \ninadequate medical (including mental-health) care.\"  Cook County, 761 F. Supp. 2d at \n797.  Although these conditions might have existed even without overcrowding, \novercrowding made them worse.  Id. at 797–98.  Thus the purpose of the prisoner \nrelease order in Cook County was not merely to set prison caps but, rather, to address \nconstitutional violations caused primarily by overcrowding.  See id.  The same is true in \nthis case:  the severe medical risks posed by coronavirus would exist even if the Jail \nwas not crowded, but the plaintiffs contend the crowding at the Jail significantly \nenhances those risks and makes the outbreak more challenging to control.  The \npurpose of a transfer order would be to address alleged constitutional violations \nstemming from coronavirus due to crowding in the Jail, and that is the type of order than \nonly a three-judge court may issue.   \n  4.  Three-judge court \n  The plaintiffs also have asked the Court to convene a three-judge court \"to \nconsider whether and to what extent to enter a prisoner release order.\"  Pls.' Reply in \nSupp. of Renewed Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (dkt. no. 64) at 2.  Under the PLRA, \"[i]n any civil \naction in Federal court with respect to prison conditions, a prisoner release order shall \nbe entered only by a three-judge court.\"  18 U.S.C.§ 3626(a)(3)(B).  The Sheriff \ncontends that the requirements for convening a three-judge court have not been met. \n  The PLRA provides that no court may enter a prisoner release order unless two \nrequirements are met.  18 U.S.C. § 3636(a)(3)(A).  First, a court must have \"previously \n74 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 75 of 87 PageID #:2008\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nentered an order for less intrusive relief that has failed to remedy the deprivation of the \nFederal right sought to be remedied through the prisoner release order.\"  Id. § \n3636(a)(3)(A)(i) (the \"previous order requirement\").  In addition, the defendant must \nhave \"had a reasonable amount of time to comply with the previous court orders.\"  Id. § \n3636(a)(3)(A)(ii) (the \"reasonable time requirement\").   \n  Together, these requirements ensure that a three-judge court's prisoner release \norder is a \"last resort remedy.\"  Brown, 563 U.S. at 514.  A party requesting a prisoner \nrelease order and the convening of a three-judge court must file \"materials sufficient to \ndemonstrate\" that both requirements have been met.  Id. § 3636(a)(3)(C).  A federal \njudge can also request sua sponte the convening of a three-judge court if both \nrequirements are met.  Id. § 3636(a)(3)(D).  The judge need not consider the likelihood \nof whether a three-judge court would issue a prisoner release order.  See Plata v. \nSchwarzenegger, No. C01-1351-TEH, 2007 WL 2122657, at *1 (N.D. Cal. July 23, \n2007).   \n    a.  Previous order requirement \n  The Court starts with the previous order requirement.  It previously entered an \norder for less intrusive relief by issuing the TRO.  Mays, 2020 WL 1812381, at *14–16.  \nThe Sheriff contends that the TRO does not satisfy the PLRA's previous order \nrequirement because it did not include an order requiring social distancing.  In the TRO \ndecision, the Court found that the plaintiffs had failed \"to show a reasonable likelihood of \nsuccess on their contention that the Sheriff is acting in an objectively unreasonable \nmanner by failing to mandate full social distancing.\"  Id. at *10.  The Court declined to \norder relief with respect to social distancing throughout the Jail but required the Sheriff \n75 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 76 of 87 PageID #:2009\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nto enforce social distancing in connection with the new detainee intake process.  Id. at \n*14.    \n  The previous order requirement is \"satisfied if the court has entered one order \n[that] 'failed to remedy' the constitutional violation.\"  Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. at 514.  \nNeither the statute nor the relevant case law suggests that a court must attempt all \npossible steps short of release before requesting the convening of a three-judge court.  \nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3636; Brown, 563 at 514–16.  And the PLRA does not require a \nprevious order involving a particular type of remedy; instead, it simply requires a \nprevious order that attempted but failed to remedy the constitutional deprivation itself.  \nSee id.  In Brown, the Supreme Court affirmed an order of a three-judge court \nmandating a population limit for California's prison system as a remedy for constitutional \nviolations in two class actions, one involving a class of prisoners with serious mental \ndisorders and the other involving prisoners with serious medical conditions.  Id. at 499, \n502.  The Court found that district courts \"acted reasonably when they convened a \nthree-judge court,\" despite recent, ongoing plans to address the at-issue constitutional \nviolations, because they \"had a solid basis to doubt\" that the \"additional efforts . . . \nwould achieve a remedy.\"  Id. at 516.   \n  In the TRO, the Court ordered relief less intrusive than a prisoner release order.  \nSpecifically, it required the Sheriff to establish and implement policies regarding \ncoronavirus testing and sanitation in the Jail, implement social distancing during the \nnew detainee intake process, provide adequate soap and/or hand sanitizer and \nsanitation supplies, and provide facemasks to all detained persons who are \nquarantined.  Mays, 2020 WL 1812381, at *14–15.  Because the TRO has not remedied \n76 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 77 of 87 PageID #:2010\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nthe overall claimed constitutional violation—deficient conditions in the Jail during a \npandemic—it satisfied the PLRA's previous order requirement. \n   \n    b.  Reasonable time requirement \n  Additionally, before a three-judge court is convened under the PLRA, the \ndefendant must have \"had a reasonable amount of time to comply with the previous \ncourt orders,\" as indicated.  Id. § 3636(a)(3)(A)(ii).  This provision \"requires that the \ndefendant have been given a reasonable time to comply with all of the court's orders.\"  \nBrown, 563 U.S. at 514 (emphasis added).  In some situations, a court may need \"to \nissue multiple orders directing and adjusting ongoing remedial efforts\" while it \"attempts \nto remedy an entrenched constitutional violation through reform of a complex \ninstitution.\"  Id. at 516.  \"Each new order must be given a reasonable time to succeed, \n[and] reasonableness must be assessed in light of the entire history of the court's \nremedial efforts.\"  Id.  But a court may request the convening of a three-judge court \neven while its remedial efforts are ongoing; otherwise, a court unreasonably would have \n\"to impose a moratorium on new remedial orders\" before a three-judge court considers \nthe issuance of a prisoner release.  Id.  \n  In Brown, the Supreme Court found that defendants in the two consolidated \ncases had reasonable time to comply with court orders where one court had \"engaged \nin remedial efforts\" for five years and the other court had done so for twelve years.  Id.  \nRemedial efforts were ongoing when the district courts requested three-judge courts, \nbut those ongoing efforts merely attempted \"to solve the crisis\" through the same \"basic \nplan[s]\" as earlier efforts.  Id. at 515.  In one case, a special master the district court \n77 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 78 of 87 PageID #:2011\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nappointed to oversee remedial matters had issued over seventy remedial orders.  Id.  \nThe courts had no \"assurance[s] that further, substantially similar efforts would yield \nsuccess absent a population reduction.\"  Id.  Indeed, advances that had been made in \none case were \"'slip-sliding away' as a result of overcrowding.\"  Id. (quoting court-\nappointed special master).   \n  The plaintiffs contend that the Sheriff has had a reasonable time to comply with \nthe Court's previous order.  They have requested a preliminary injunction ordering social \ndistancing, but, in light of the urgency of the situation, they also have requested the \nconvening of a three-judge court to consider the question of prisoner release.  The \nplaintiffs appear to contend that if an injunction directing social distancing does not \nremedy the alleged constitutional violations, then only the immediate release of \nprisoners by a three-judge court will achieve a remedy, so a three-judge court needs to \nbe ready to issue a ruling as soon as that time comes.  The Sheriff contends that he has \nnot reasonably had time to comply with any such order because the Court has not \ndirected him to implement social distancing throughout the Jail. \n  The Court recognizes that determination of what amounts to a \"reasonable time\" \nto comply with a court's previous orders may depend on the circumstances, and here \nthe circumstances are extraordinary, involving an infectious virus that can be \ntransmitted quickly from person to person.  So here, perhaps, a \"reasonable time\" may \namount to days or a small number of weeks, not years as may be the case in other \nsituations.   Undue delays in responding to the coronavirus pandemic may place \ndetained persons' health and lives in imminent danger.   \n  Unlike in Brown, however, the ongoing remedial efforts in this case might remedy \n78 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 79 of 87 PageID #:2012\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nthe ongoing constitutional violation—which, to be clear, involves the objective \nreasonableness of the Sheriff's response to the coronavirus outbreak, not existence of \ncoronavirus itself—if given adequate time.  The Sheriff has offered evidence that may \nbe understood to suggest that he is making a substantial effort to comply with the \nCourt's order and attempt to improve the conditions of confinement at the Jail in \nresponse to the coronavirus pandemic.  As detailed earlier in this opinion, he has \ncomplied with the TRO by implementing social distancing at intake; developing and \nimplementing a plan to distribute soap, sanitizer, and cleaning suppliers more \nfrequently; and providing facemasks to detained persons housed on tiers under \nquarantine.  In addition, he has made efforts to spread out detainees within the Jail, \neven though the TRO did not mandate it.  As detailed earlier, he has opened up \npreviously closed units, doubled the number of persons housed in single-occupancy \ncells, attempted to ensure that detained persons are assigned beds in dorm units that \nare spaced more than six feet apart, and adopted various practices to encourage \ndetained persons to practice social distancing in dorms and in common areas.   As the \nCourt has explained, it believes that the narrowly tailored relief it is ordering via this \nopinion appropriately addressed the claimed constitutional violations on which the \nplaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success.  Unlike in Brown, the additional relief \nordered in this decision is not based on the same \"basic plan\" as earlier efforts but \nrather takes a different and focused approach.  Brown, 563 U.S. at 515.  In short, it will \nrequire preventative public health measures that the Court has not previously ordered \nand that the Sheriff has not shown he has implemented.  \n  Further, although the PLRA's previous order requirement refers to a single order, \n79 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 80 of 87 PageID #:2013\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nits reasonable time requirement uses the plural \"orders.\"  Compare 18 U.S.C. § \n3626(a)(3)(A)(i) with id. § 3626(a)(3)(A)(ii); see also Brown, 563 U.S. at 514.  Nothing in \nthe statute or the relevant case law indicates that a court must convene a three-judge \npanel after issuing only one order.  Rather, the case law reflects that a court can, and \nperhaps in some circumstances should, make additional efforts beyond a single TRO \nbefore convening a three-judge court to consider ordering the release of imprisoned or \ndetained persons.  See id. (releasing prisoners is a \"last resort remedy\").  This seems \nparticularly true where, as here, a Court has a basis on which to issue an additional \norder that is not \"substantially similar\" to its previous order and thus can attempt a new \napproach to remedying the constitutional violation that might \"yield success.\"  Cf. \nBrown, 563 U.S. at 515.   \n  For these reasons, the Court is not persuaded that it has given its less-intrusive \norders \"a reasonable time to succeed,\" Brown, 563 U.S. at 516; that the Sheriff has \n\"reasonable amount of time to comply\" with those orders, 18 U.S.C. § 3636(a)(3)(A)(ii); \nor that the Sheriff could have reasonable time to comply in light of the further efforts the \nCourt is taking in this order to remedy the claimed constitutional violations.  The Court \nconcludes that the PLRA's reasonable time prerequisite for the convening of a three-\njudge court has not yet been satisfied.   \n  For these reasons, the Court declines to request the convening of a three-judge \ncourt. 13  \n   \n                                            \n13 As the Court has previously advised the parties, however, immediately after the \nissuance of the TRO, the Court advised the chief circuit judge of the pendency of the \ncase and the potential need, at some point, to convene a three-judge court. \n80 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 81 of 87 PageID #:2014\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\n  5.  Irreparable harm \n  In addition to showing a likelihood of success on the merits, the plaintiffs must \nshow that they will likely suffer irreparable harm without a preliminary injunction.  \nWhitaker, 858 F.3d at 1044.  Irreparable harm is \"harm that cannot be repaired and for \nwhich money compensation is inadequate.\"  Orr v. Shicker, 953 F.3d 490, 502 (7th Cir. \n2020) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The plaintiffs must show more than a \"mere \npossibility\" of harm but not that harm has already occurred or is certain to occur.  \nWhitaker, 858 F.3d at 1045.  \"[A] remedy for unsafe conditions need not await a tragic \nevent.”  Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993). \n  The plaintiffs have satisfied this requirement.  They have shown a likelihood that, \nwithout additional measures to expand and enforce social distancing and the \ncontinuation of measures aimed at enhancing sanitation of surfaces within the Jail and \notherwise curbing the spread of coronavirus among detained persons, some of the \nclass members will contract the virus.   If they contract coronavirus, class members—\nparticularly those over the age of sixty-five or with certain preexisting health \nconditions—risk severe health consequences, including death.  These grave risks to \nhealth are not an insignificant possibility for the class members, all of whom are live in \nthe Jail's congregate environment, where the coronavirus has been spreading for weeks \nand where detained persons—even those who sleep their own cells—share spaces like \ncommon areas and showers.  Therefore, the plaintiffs have adequately shown a \nlikelihood that they will suffer irreparable harm without a preliminary injunction. \n  6.  No adequate remedy at law  \n  The plaintiffs also must show that they have no adequate remedy at law should \n81 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 82 of 87 PageID #:2015\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nthe preliminary injunction not issue.  Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1046.  They are not required \nto show that a remedy is \"wholly ineffectual\" but rather \"that any award would be \nseriously deficient as compared to the harm suffered.\"  Id.  Where harm cannot be \npracticably remedied by monetary damages, there is no adequate legal remedy.  See \nid.; Foodcomm Int'l v. Barry, 328 F.3d 300, 304 (7th Cir. 2003); see also W.S.R. v. \nSessions, 318 F. Supp. 3d 1116, 1126–27 (N.D. Ill. 2018) (no adequate remedy of law \nto address harm from prolonging child's separation from parent).  The plaintiffs have \nclearly shown that the risk of harm to their health and possibly their lives cannot be fully \nremedied through damages, and therefore they have shown that they have no adequate \nremedy at law.    \n  7.  Balancing of harms \n  \"Once a moving party has met its burden of establishing the threshold \nrequirements for a preliminary injunction, the court must balance the harms faced by \nboth parties and the public as a whole.\"  Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1054.  The nature of the \nbalancing analysis depends on the moving party's likelihood of success: the higher the \nlikelihood, the more the balance tips in favor of granting injunctive relief.  Id.  Before \nissuing an injunction ordering a defendant to perform an affirmative act, which can \nimpose \"significant burdens on the defendant,\" a court must give \"careful consideration \n[to] the intrusiveness of the ordered act, as well as the difficulties that may be \nencountered in supervising the enjoined party's compliance with the court's order.\"  \nKartman, 634 F.3d at 892 (discussing certification of a class seeking mandatory \ninjunctive relief). \n  The Sheriff argues that the balance of harms weighs against issuing a \n82 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 83 of 87 PageID #:2016\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\npreliminary injunction because he is doing the best he can to contain the spread of \ncoronavirus at the Jail, including, he contends, following the CDC Guidelines to the \ngreatest extent possible.  He argues that an order requiring him to implement more \nhealth and protective measures would be disruptive to his ongoing and persistent efforts \nto protect detainees from coronavirus.  He also argues that the Court should defer to his \nexpertise and judgment regarding the best policies and practices to implement at the \nJail, particularly in light of the fundamental need for him to maintain internal security and \norder.  See Bell, 441 U.S. at 547–48.  The plaintiffs contend that the risk of severe \nhealth consequences or death to the class members is so grave that it tips the balance \nof harms in favor of granting a preliminary injunction.  Additionally, the plaintiffs argue \nthe public's interest in containing outbreaks of coronavirus favors granting injunctive \nrelief. \n  The Court concludes that the balance favors granting preliminary injunctive relief \nto the plaintiffs to the limited extent contemplated by this order.  First, as detailed above, \nthe plaintiffs have presented ample evidence of conditions that pose an unreasonable \nrisk of serious harm to the class members' health and, despite the laudable strides the \nSheriff has made since the Court issued the TRO, at least some shortcomings in the \nSheriff's mitigation of that risk.  This evidence tips the balance in favor of injunctive relief \nbecause, as the Court has explained, the plaintiffs have far surpassed their burden of \ndemonstrating a \"better than negligible\" likelihood of success on the merits.  Whitaker, \n858 F.3d at 1046 (quoting Cooper v. Salazar, 196 F.3d 809, 813 (7th Cir. 1999)).  The \ninterest of the public in containing the spread of coronavirus further tips the balance in \nfavor of injunctive relief. \n83 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 84 of 87 PageID #:2017\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\n  As it did in issuing the TRO, the Court acknowledges the deference owed to the \nSheriff in the operation of the Jail and in his development of internal procedures to \nmaintain safety, order, and security and to response to this severe crisis.  The Court \nrecognizes the immense amount of time and work that the Sheriff and his staff have \nspent trying to respond to this crisis.  The Court further recognizes that compliance with \njudicial orders impose burdens on the Sheriff and his staff, in no small part by requiring \nthem to devote some of their limited time and resources to following a court's directives.  \n  The Court has taken these considerations into account in ordering the limited \nrelief described in this order.  It has ensured that the relief is narrowly drawn, extends \nno further than necessary, and is the least intrusive means necessary to address the \nshortcomings discussed earlier in this opinion.  The Court has tailored the relief to \naccount for deference to the Jail's ongoing planning and efforts to address the risks \nassociated with the coronavirus outbreak.  The Court also has, as indicated earlier, \ntaken into account the enhanced requirements for issuing what it has referred to as a \n\"mandatory injunction.\"  And the Court has concluded that it will not encounter \nsignificant obstacles in supervising the order despite its mandatory nature.  Despite \nthese considerations, the risk to the health and safety of detainees and others is \nsufficient to permit and require preliminary injunctive relief.   \nC.  Preliminary injunctive relief \n  For the reasons stated above, the plaintiffs have met the criteria for a preliminary \nrestraining order with regard to at least parts of Count 1 of their complaint.  The Court \norders as follows and will also include this in a separate preliminary injunction order \nissued under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(d).  \n84 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 85 of 87 PageID #:2018\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\n•  The Sheriff shall maintain and carry out a policy requiring prompt coronavirus \ntesting of: (1) detained persons who exhibit symptoms consistent with \ncoronavirus disease, and (2) at medically appropriate times, detained persons \nwho have been exposed to others who have exhibited those symptoms or have \ntested positive for coronavirus.  With regard to the category (2), the Sheriff must \nacquire and maintain sufficient testing materials so that determination of the \nappropriateness of testing such persons is made pursuant to medical and public \nhealth considerations and not the availability of testing materials.  \n•  The Sheriff shall enforce social distancing during the new detainee intake \nprocess, including continued suspension of the use of bullpens and other \nmultiple-person cells or enclosures to hold new detainees awaiting intake. \n•  The Sheriff shall provide soap and/or hand sanitizer to all detainees in quantities \nsufficient to permit them to frequently clean their hands.   \n•  The Sheriff shall provide sanitation supplies sufficient and adequate to enable all \nstaff and detainees to regularly sanitize surfaces and objects on which the virus \ncould be present, including in all areas occupied or frequented by more than one \nperson (such as two-person cells, as well as bathrooms, showers, and other \nsurfaces in common areas).  The Sheriff shall also maintain and carry out a \npolicy requiring sanitization between all uses of frequently touched surfaces and \nobjects as well as monitoring and supervision to ensure that such sanitization \ntakes place regularly. \n•  The Sheriff shall provide facemasks to all detained persons who are \nquarantined—i.e., those who have been exposed to a detained person who is \n85 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 86 of 87 PageID #:2019\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\nsymptomatic (even if not coronavirus-positive).  The facemasks must be replaced \nat medically appropriate intervals, and the Sheriff must provide the users with \ninstruction on how to use a facemask and the reasons for its use. \n•  The Sheriff shall establish by no later than April 29, 2020 and shall put into effect \nby no later than May 1, 2020 a policy precluding group housing or double celling \nof detained persons, except in the following situations: \n  Persons detained in tiers or dormitories currently under quarantine \no\nfollowing a positive test for the coronavirus within the tier or dormitory \n(\"quarantine tiers\"); \n  Detained persons who have tested positive for the coronavirus and are \no\nunder medical observation (\"isolation tiers\"); \n  Detained persons who have tested positive for coronavirus and are \no\nrecovering (\"convalescent tiers\"); \n  Double-celled or dormitory-housed detainees for whom there is a \no\ndocumented determination by a medical or mental health professional that \nsingle-celling poses a risk of suicide or self-harm; \n  Persons detained housed in a dormitory unit that is at less than fifty \no\npercent capacity; and \n  Detained persons committed, at the documented direction of a medical or \no\nmental health professional, to a group housing unit that is equipped for \nmedical or mental health treatment, if but only if there is not available \nspace in an appropriate housing or medical unit that permits full social \ndistancing.   \n86 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 73 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 87 of 87 PageID #:2020\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 12-5            Filed: 06/05/2020      Pages: 87\n•  Detained persons housed in any of the listed \"acceptable\" arrangements must be \nprovided with facemasks that are replaced at medically appropriate intervals.  \nThe detained persons must be provided with instruction on how to use a \nfacemask and the reasons for its use.  They also must be instructed, at regular \nintervals, on the importance of social distancing. \n•  On May 1, 2020, the Sheriff shall file a report regarding his compliance with the \nterms of the preliminary injunction. \n  Finally, the Court will entertain submissions by the parties regarding the duration \nof the preliminary injunction, in particular the social distancing provisions.  Typically, a \npreliminary injunction lasts until the trial on the merits, but the order the Court is entering \nis predicated on an underlying condition—the ongoing pandemic—that, one can hope, \nwill not last indefinitely.  Under ordinary circumstances, there is nothing constitutionally \ninappropriate about housing detained persons in groups and allowing them to come into \ncontact with each other.  Currently we are not living in ordinary circumstances—hence \nthe preliminary injunction—but once matters return to something approaching normal, it \nmay be appropriate to loosen the requirements of the injunction.  The Court (either the \nemergency judge or the assigned judge) will address this with the parties at a future \ndate. \nConclusion \n  The Court grants the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction in part and denies \nit in part as set out in this Memorandum Opinion and Order [dkt. no. 55]. \n \n              ________________________________ \n                MATTHEW F.

There is no dispute about the deadly impact of \nCOVID-19, which has killed more than 413,000 people. And there can be no dispute \nabout the public health disaster that began to unfold at the Jail in early April, when \nit became the largest single-known source of infections in the nation. A recent peer-\nreviewed study has found that more than 15% (1 in 6) of all COVID-19 cases in \nIllinois can be traced to the Jail. Ex. 1.1 \nAfter filing suit, Plaintiffs sought emergency injunctive relief to protect them \nfrom the Sheriff’s objectively unreasonable conduct that was putting them in \njeopardy. Plaintiffs submitted voluminous evidence about what measures public \nhealth and medical experts had determined were necessary to protect against \nuncontrolled spread of COVID-19. The Sheriff did not dispute that these measures \nwere necessary, but contended he had the situation “under control.” R.62 at 2. On \nApril 9, the district court entered a TRO, granting some, but not all, of the \nmeasures Plaintiffs had requested. At that time, more than 400 detainees and staff \nhad tested positive for COVID-19. On April 27, the district court entered a \npreliminary injunction, continuing the TRO relief and ordering the Sheriff to \nimplement certain social distancing measures. At that time, 788 detainees and staff \nhad tested positive for COVID-19, and six people had died. Apr. 23, 2020 Hr’g (Hr’g) \nat 142:16-143:3. \n \n1 Plaintiffs submit this report pursuant to Rule 8(a)(2), which permits this Court to \nconsider affidavits or other sworn statements regarding facts that may be in dispute. \n1 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 17-1            Filed: 06/12/2020      Pages: 25 (3 of 32)\nOn June 5, nearly six weeks after the preliminary injunction and more than \ntwo months after the TRO, the Sheriff asked this Court for a stay of the preliminary \ninjunction.2 The Sheriff raises no legitimate issue on which he is likely to prevail on \nappeal, and his assertion of irreparable harm is internally inconsistent and lacks \nevidentiary support. The district court’s denial of a stay was accordingly no abuse of \ndiscretion, but instead supported by uncontroverted evidence in the record, \nincluding the Sheriff’s own admissions and evidence. The motion for a stay should \nbe denied. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nCOVID-19 has no cure and no vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control \n(CDC) advises that the best way to prevent COVID-19 is to avoid exposure, by: (1) \nfrequent handwashing, (2) social distancing, (3) wearing a mask, and (4) \ndisinfecting surfaces. See R.1 ¶ 18 n.17 (citing “How to Protect Yourself,” CDC, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html).  \nOn March 23, the Sheriff reported its first COVID-19 case at the Jail. R.31-2 \nat 3. By April 3, the day Plaintiffs filed suit, more than 200 staff and detainees had \ntested positive, and 14 detainees had been hospitalized. R.2 at 6. In their lawsuit, \nPlaintiffs Mays and Jackson asserted 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims on behalf of a class of \ndetainees at the Jail, as well as claims under 28 U.S.C. § 2241.  \n \n2 The Sheriff also seeks to stay all discovery in the case. But he offers no explanation \nas to why such a stay is appropriate, why he did not first seek this relief in the district \ncourt, or whether this Court even has jurisdiction to issue such a stay. Fed. R. App. P. 8(a); \nsee also Abelesz v. OTP Bank, 692 F.3d 638, 647 (7th Cir. 2012) (discussing pendent \nappellate jurisdiction). \n2 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 17-1            Filed: 06/12/2020      Pages: 25 (4 of 32)\nPlaintiffs immediately sought a TRO requiring the Sheriff to implement well-\nknown public health measures necessary to protect detainees from rampant spread \nof COVID-19. Id. at 15-16. In support of their request, Plaintiffs cited CDC guidance \nand testimony from five medical experts with substantial correctional experience, \nincluding three doctors who previously served as medical directors at the Jail. R.1-2 \n¶¶ 1-5. These experts opined that the Sheriff needed to take action to protect \ndetainees, whose health and safety were imminently threatened by the COVID-19 \noutbreak. Id. ¶¶ 28-37. They opined that the Sheriff must expand detainee testing, \nprovide detainees masks, provide full, free access to hygiene and sanitation \nsupplies, and implement social distancing throughout the Jail. Id. ¶¶ 29-35. \nPlaintiffs also submitted declarations from recently released detainees (and \nindividuals who had spoken with detainees), who reported that detainees were not \nprovided adequate hygiene, cleaning supplies, or masks, they remained in close \nquarters where they could not socially distance, commonly-used surfaces were not \nregularly disinfected, and they were not being tested for COVID-19, even if they \nwere suffering classic COVID-19 symptoms. R.1-4 through 1-21.  \nThe Sheriff responded to Plaintiffs’ motion on April 6, raising no dispute \nabout the measures necessary to protect detainees’ health and safety. R.29-1. The \nSheriff simply argued that he was already taking those actions. Id. at 4. \nOn April 9, the district court entered a TRO “considerably narrower than the \norder the plaintiffs have requested.” R.48 at 3. The court weighed the parties’ \nevidence and determined Plaintiffs’ evidence established that “certain of the \n3 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 17-1            Filed: 06/12/2020      Pages: 25 (5 of 32)\nconditions created by the intentional actions of the Sheriff enable the spread of \n[COVID-19] and significantly heighten detainees’ risk of contracting the virus.” Id. \nat 18. The court specifically found that the Sheriff was not providing facemasks for \ndetainees, was not providing detainees with adequate access to soap, and was not \nproviding for sanitation of commonly-used spaces. Id. at 18-20. The court also found \nthat the Sheriff had no COVID-19 testing policy for detainees and was not \nimplementing social distancing during intake, where individuals are housed in \ncrowded cells called “bullpens.” Id. at 24, 30-31. The court found these failures \nobjectively unreasonable, given Plaintiffs’ evidence about COVID-19’s dangers and \nthe steps necessary to protect against its uncontrolled spread, as well as the high \nnumber of infected individuals at the Jail. Id. at 18-20. At the time of the TRO, \nmore than 400 detainees and staff had tested positive, one detainee had died, and \nthe Jail was the largest known source of infections in the nation. Id. at 4. \nIn its TRO, the district court ordered the Sheriff to: (1) establish a policy \nrequiring prompt COVID-19 testing for symptomatic detainees and (as practicable) \ndetainees who had been exposed; (2) enforce social distancing during intake and \nsuspend the use of bullpens; (3) establish a policy to ensure detainees could access \nhygiene and sanitation supplies sufficient for regular hand-washing and surface \nsanitization, and to require sanitization of frequently touched objects between uses; \nand (4) provide facemasks to detainees exposed to COVID-19. Id. at 34-36. The \ncourt denied all of Plaintiffs’ other requests for injunctive relief, determining that \nthey had not met their evidentiary burden. Id. at 14, 23-25, 36. \n4 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 17-1            Filed: 06/12/2020      Pages: 25 (6 of 32)\nOn April 13, the Sheriff told the district court he had begun enforcing social \ndistancing during intake on April 10; created a policy governing COVID-19 testing \non April 11; created the court-ordered hygiene and sanitation policies on April 11; \nand provided surgical masks to all detainees exposed to COVID-19 on April 13. R.51 \nat 3-4, 8, 17-18. \nOn April 14, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, seeking to \ncontinue the relief ordered in the TRO, and asking the district court to order the \nSheriff to enforce social distancing throughout the Jail, release medically-\nvulnerable detainees, and convene a three-judge panel to consider a prisoner release \norder. R.55 at 3-19. When Plaintiffs filed their motion, 541 detainees and staff had \ntested positive. R.55 at 1. \nIn support, Plaintiffs submitted evidence from Dr. Homer Venters, an \nepidemiologist and correctional medical expert, R.64-2; Dr. Amir Mohareb, an \ninfectious disease specialist at Harvard, R.64-3; Dr. Gregg Gonsalves, an \nepidemiologist at Yale, R.55-7; and Dr. Laura Rasmussen-Torvik, the Chief of \nEpidemiology at Northwestern, R.64-4. All four experts (and the five experts whose \ndeclaration was filed with Plaintiffs’ Complaint) opined that complete social \ndistancing was the only way to meaningfully reduce COVID-19’s rampant spread at \nthe Jail. R.64-2 at 9; R.64-3 at 6-7; R.55-7 at 7; R.64-4 at 3; R.1-2 at 9. Plaintiffs also \nsubmitted declarations from investigators who spoke with detainees, all of whom \nreported they were not able to socially distance. R.55-5 at 2-11.  \n5 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 17-1            Filed: 06/12/2020      Pages: 25 (7 of 32)\nThe Sheriff did not dispute Plaintiffs’ overwhelming evidence about \ncontinued COVID-19 risks at the Jail, the imminent threat of harm posed to \ndetainees, or the public health measures—including social distancing—that \nPlaintiffs’ evidence established were necessary to control the spread. The Sheriff \ninstead told the district court that an injunction was unnecessary because COVID-\n19 was “under control” at the Jail. R.62 at 3. And although he argued he was taking \nsteps to implement social distancing at the Jail, id. at 19, his evidence \ndemonstrated that many detainees remained housed in tiers well over 50% \ncapacity. R.62-5 at 9-12. \nThe district court held an evidentiary hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion on April \n23. R.71. At that time, at least 788 detainees and staff had contracted COVID-19, \nand the positive testing rate for detainees was nearly 70%, suggesting that the \nactual number of COVID-19-positive individuals at the Jail was far higher. Hr’g at \n142:14-143:14.  \nPlaintiffs presented Dr. Venters, who testified about the importance of social \ndistancing in controlling COVID-19’s spread. Hr’g at 65:9-120:12; see also R.73 at \n24-26. The Sheriff presented Michael Miller, the Jail’s Executive Director, who did \nnot dispute any of Plaintiffs’ evidence regarding the need for social distancing. Hr’g \nat 8:1-64:3, 123:22-141:19; see also R.73 at 19-23. \nOn April 27, the district court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction in part. R.73. The court weighed both sides’ evidence and found that \nPlaintiffs were likely to prevail on their claim that the Sheriff was objectively \n6 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 17-1            Filed: 06/12/2020      Pages: 25 (8 of 32)\nunreasonable in his efforts to effect social distancing. Id. at 63-64. The court \nrepeatedly recognized its obligation to accord deference to the Sheriff’s security \ninterests, and accordingly permitted him flexibility regarding social distancing in \nmany respects. But the court determined greater social distancing was necessary \nand the Sheriff had provided no adequate explanation as to why he could not or \nshould not do more. Id. at 63. \nThe district court converted the TRO to a preliminary injunction, and \nadditionally ordered the Sheriff to establish a “policy precluding group housing or \ndouble celling of detained persons” with exceptions for detainees who: (1) were in \nquarantined units; (2) had tested positive; (3) needed double-celling because of a \nrisk of self-harm; (4) were housed in a “group housing unit that is equipped for \nmedical or mental health treatment” if there is no available space in a medical unit \nthat permits social distancing; or (5) were housed in dorms at less than 50% \ncapacity. R.74 at 2-3. The court denied all Plaintiffs’ other requests for relief. \nMore than three weeks after it was entered, the Sheriff moved to stay the \ninjunction in the district court. R.98-1. The district court denied the motion on May \n29, finding that the Sheriff had not established his likelihood of success on appeal or \nany irreparable harm. R.109. One week later, the Sheriff sought a stay in this \nCourt.  \nLEGAL STANDARD \n“A stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise \nresult.” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 433 (2009). It is a request that this Court \n7 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 17-1            Filed: 06/12/2020      Pages: 25 (9 of 32)\nexercise its equitable powers, and the movant bears the burden of showing that \nsuch an exercise is warranted by the circumstances. Id.  \nThis Court reviews the district court’s denial of a stay pending appeal for an \nabuse of discretion, reviewing findings of fact for clear error. Venckiene v. United \nStates, 929 F.3d 843, 853 (7th Cir. 2019). Motions to stay require consideration of \nfour factors: (1) whether the movant has shown a strong likelihood of success on the \nmerits; (2) whether the movant will suffer irreparable harm without a stay; (3) \nwhether a stay would substantially harm the non-movants; and (4) whether the \npublic interest favors a stay. Nken, 556 U.S. at 434; In re A&F Enters., Inc., 742 \nF.3d 763, 766 (7th Cir. 2014). \nThe Sheriff contends this Court should conduct a “plenary review” of his \nmotion because the district court failed to “meaningful[ly] analy[ze]” the relevant \nfactors. Mot. at 4-5. But this assertion is plainly rebutted by the district court’s \nopinion, which thoroughly discusses the stay factors and their application to this \ncase. R.109 at 3-10. The district court addressed each of the Sheriff’s arguments on \nhis likelihood of success, the probability of irreparable harm, and the public \ninterest. Id. Abuse of discretion accordingly governs this Court’s review. Cf. Cavel \nInt’l, Inc. v. Madigan, 500 F.3d 544, 547 (7th Cir. 2007) (conducting plenary review \nonly because the district court failed to balance any of the relevant factors, instead \ndenying a stay based solely on likelihood of success).  \n \n \n8 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 17-1            Filed: 06/12/2020      Pages: 25 (10 of 32)\nARGUMENT \nThe district court correctly determined a stay was inappropriate. After \nwaiting several weeks to seek a stay in either court, the Sheriff has articulated no \nharm that he has or will suffer without a stay, much less provided the evidence \ndescribed in Rule 8. His motion instead contends that he would prefer not to be \nsubject to judicial scrutiny for the actions he is (and is not) taking regarding the \npandemic. The Sheriff also fails to acknowledge that the decreased infection rate at \nthe Jail occurred after the district court’s preliminary injunction, showing that the \ninjunction is critical to protect Plaintiffs’ safety. Especially given the lack of any \ncredible arguments on the merits of the appeal, each of the factors counsels against \na stay. This Court should deny the motion. \nI.  The Sheriff Has Not Shown a Strong Likelihood of Success on the \nMerits. \n \nThis Court’s review of the district court’s decision to enter a preliminary \ninjunction is for abuse of discretion. Turnell v. CentiMark Corp., 796 F.3d 656, 662 \n(7th Cir. 2015). The Sheriff contends he is likely to win on the merits of his appeal \nbecause the district court misapplied the standard governing Plaintiffs’ claims. But \nthe Sheriff does not dispute that Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment claims properly \nrequired an inquiry into the objective reasonableness of his actions to protect \nPlaintiffs from the threat of COVID-19. Mot. at 5; R.73 at 54, 57-58. The Sheriff \ninstead argues the court erred because it ordered him to do what he was already \ndoing, and failed to give dispositive effect to the CDC Guidance for Detention \nFacilities. Neither contention has merit. \n9 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 17-1            Filed: 06/12/2020      Pages: 25 (11 of 32)\nThe district court recognized that the Sheriff’s objective reasonableness must \nbe assessed “based on what the [Sheriff] knew at the time[,]” and “must account for \nhis legitimate interest in managing the Jail facilities” and “defer to policies and \npractices that are needed to preserve the internal order and discipline and to \nmaintain institutional security.” R.73 at 58 (citing Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. \nCt. 2466, 2473 (2015); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547 (1979)) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). But the district court recognized that deference to the Sheriff was \nnot limitless, and did not excuse the court’s “obligation to enforce the constitutional \nrights of all persons, including prisoners.” R.109 at 8 (citing Brown v. Plata, 563 \nU.S. 492, 511 (2011)); see also Brown, 563 U.S. at 511 (“Courts may not allow \nconstitutional violations to continue simply because a remedy would involve \nintrusion into the realm of prison administration.”). \nApplying those precedents to the facts at hand, the district court discussed \nthe wealth of unrebutted medical evidence from Plaintiffs, including expert \ntestimony from medical and public health experts, who unanimously opined that \nsocial distancing (in addition to adequate hygiene, sanitation, masks, and testing) \nwas necessary to meaningfully control COVID-19’s spread. R.73 at 23-28. The court \nacknowledged the evidence that these measures were particularly critical in \nsettings like the Jail, which “densely packs large groups of people together.” Id. at \n27. The court addressed the Sheriff’s evidence about his efforts to implement social \ndistancing and his decision not to socially distance certain detainees, noting that \nthe Sheriff had offered no explanation for some of these decisions. Id. at 19-23 (e.g., \n10 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 17-1            Filed: 06/12/2020      Pages: 25 (12 of 32)\nthe Sheriff’s executive director testified that some detainees were placed in double-\noccupancy cells “due to disorderly conduct” but “did not explain how double-celling \nserves a security purpose in such situations”).3  \nThe district court accordingly determined, after weighing the evidence and \ngiving due consideration to the Sheriff’s security interests, that a preliminary \ninjunction mandating some social distancing (with exceptions) was appropriate. Id. \nat 63-64. The court specifically found that group housing and double-celling “is \nobjectively unreasonable given the immediate and significant risk to [Plaintiff’s] life \nand health” but that certain exceptions were necessary to “account for and give \ndeference to the Sheriff’s interest in managing the Jail facilities and to practices \nthat are needed to preserve order and discipline and maintain security.” Id. \nAccording that deference, the court exempted detainees from its social distancing \norder who: (1) were housed in a quarantined tier; (2) had tested positive for COVID-\n19; (3) were at risk of self-harm; (4) were housed in a group housing unit equipped \nfor medical treatment, where full social distancing was infeasible; and (5) were \nhoused in dorms at less than 50% capacity. Id. at 64. \nThe Sheriff does not dispute the district court’s findings about Plaintiffs’ risk \nof harm or need for social distancing, but argues he was already taking the actions \nordered. Mot. at 8. The record belies this contention. In denying the Sheriff’s motion \n \n3 The Sheriff still has not provided any explanation why so-called “disorderly” \ndetainees must be double-celled, or why detainees identified as potential sexual assault \nvictims must sacrifice their health to be protected from assault, despite the district court’s \nexpress indication that it would consider a request to modify the injunction if some \nexplanation could be provided. R.109 at 9. \n11 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 17-1            Filed: 06/12/2020      Pages: 25 (13 of 32)\nto stay, the district court expressly found that “the TRO and preliminary injunction \ndirected the Sheriff to take steps he was not already taking or was not taking in an \neffective way.” R.109 at 5. The record unequivocally supports this finding.  \nAfter the TRO, the Sheriff stated that to comply with the court’s order, he \nhad: “been implementing the[] new” intake distancing policy “since April 10” (the \nday after the TRO was entered); amended an outbreak prevention policy on April 11 \n“to create a plan for administering the [COVID-19] tests” as ordered by the court; \ncreated and distributed a sanitation policy on April 11; and “provid[ed] all \nquarantined detainees one surgical mask per day” beginning on April 13. R.51 at 6, \n8, 17-18.  \nAfter the April 27 preliminary injunction, the Sheriff reported that he had \namended his testing policy to comply with the court’s order. R.84 at 2. He also \nreported changing his social distancing practices in response to the Court’s order by \nsignificantly limiting the number of detainees in housing units. Id. at 12 (“184 of \n206 housing units are at 50% capacity or less” and all other units “fall within one or \nmore of the [court’s] exceptions”). The record demonstrates the district court did not \norder the Sheriff simply to do what he had already been doing. It compelled the \nSheriff to take steps the uncontroverted evidence established were necessary to \nprotect detainees’ lives. \nThe Sheriff next contends that, because the CDC’s Correctional Guidance \nincludes certain “feasibility exceptions,” his actions were objectively reasonable. \nThis argument fails. \n12 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 17-1            Filed: 06/12/2020      Pages: 25 (14 of 32)\nThis Court has repeatedly held that administrative guidance, although \npotentially relevant to the reasonableness of conduct, is not dispositive. United \nStates v. Proano, 912 F.3d 431, 439 (7th Cir. 2019); United States v. Brown, 871 \nF.3d 532, 537 (7th Cir. 2017); Thompson v. City of Chicago, 472 F.3d 444, 454 (7th \nCir. 2006). In Brown, this Court held that determining the objective reasonableness \nof a state actor’s conduct is “governed by constitutional principles” and “turns on the \nfacts and circumstances of each particular case[,]” and not administrative \nregulations. 871 F.3d at 536-37. This Court reasoned that although agency \nregulations may be relevant to the constitutional analysis, affording them \ndispositive effect would empower the agency to become the arbiter on the \nConstitution—“a prospect that would have horrified those responsible for the [Bill of \nRights]’s ratification.” Id. at 537; see also Proano, 912 F.3d at 439 (The \nConstitution, not policies or regulations, “sets the constitutional floor” for what is \nobjectively reasonable.). \nThe district court determined that, given these precedents, the CDC’s \nCorrectional Guidance was “an important piece of evidence to consider in assessing \nthe Sheriff’s conduct,” but was not “dispositive standing alone.” R.73 at 61. That \ndetermination was correct. \nThe Sheriff’s citation to two cases involving the deliberate indifference \nstandard is unavailing. See Mot. at 8-9. In both, the plaintiff had provided no \nevidence to support injunctive measures beyond what the regulations required. See \nCaroll v. DeTella, 255 F.3d 470, 472-73 (7th Cir. 2001); Forbes v. Edgar, 112 F.3d \n13 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 17-1            Filed: 06/12/2020      Pages: 25 (15 of 32)\n262, 267 (7th Cir. 1997). Here, Plaintiffs showed by substantial evidence that \nobjective reasonableness required the measures ordered by the district court. \nThe Sheriff’s argument also fails to acknowledge that the district court’s \npreliminary injunction decision found the Sheriff’s decision not to socially distance \ncertain detainees was not based solely on feasibility. R.73 at 63 (“[I]t does not \nappear, based on the evidence, that the Sheriff has yet hit the feasibility limit on \ngetting detainees out of group housing, even if one considers only the Jail complex \nitself.”). This has been borne out by the Sheriff’s own subsequent submissions, \nwhere he claimed compliance with the court’s injunction by implementing the \nrequired social distancing. R.84 at 12. Notably, the Sheriff reported a marked \ndecrease in the Jail’s infection rate after he reported compliance with the \npreliminary injunction. Mot. at 2.  \nSimply put, the district court’s finding that the Sheriff’s inaction regarding \nsocial distancing was objectively unreasonable is not clearly erroneous, and the \nSheriff’s contention to the contrary is meritless. The Sheriff has therefore not shown \nthat he is likely to succeed on the merits of his appeal. \nII.  The Sheriff’s Motion Demonstrates He Will Suffer No Irreparable \nHarm If the Injunction Is Not Stayed. \n \nThe Sheriff’s motion for a stay was filed nearly six weeks after the \npreliminary injunction, and more than two months after the TRO. R.48; R.73. That \ndelay falls squarely on the Sheriff’s shoulders, who waited more than three weeks \nafter the preliminary injunction to file a motion for a stay in the district court, R. \n98-1, and a full week after its denial to seek relief on appeal, R.109. Appellate \n14 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 17-1            Filed: 06/12/2020      Pages: 25 (16 of 32)\ncourts have found such unexplained delay substantially undercuts an assertion of \nirreparable harm. Hirschfeld v. Bd. of Elections, 984 F.2d 35, 39 (2d Cir. 1993); see \nalso Garcia v. Google, Inc., 786 F.3d 733, 746 (9th Cir. 2015). \nMoreover, given the weeks that have now elapsed, an assertion of irreparable \nharm should be accompanied by evidence of actual harm suffered as a result of the \ninjunction. Al Otro Lado v. Wolf, 952 F.3d 999, 1007 (9th Cir. 2020) (no irreparable \nharm because injunction had been in place for three weeks before government \nsought a stay, but instead of “evidence of harms that did occur because of the \ninjunction[,]” it offered only “estimates, assumptions, and projections”); see also \nFed. R. App. P. 8(a)(2)(B) (directing the movant to attach “affidavits or other sworn \nstatements supporting facts subject to dispute”). But the Sheriff provides no such \nevidence. Mot. at 11. \nThe Sheriff’s assertion of irreparable harm is further undercut by his own \npromises that “there is no likelihood that [the Sheriff] will discontinue” the actions \nthe preliminary injunction mandates. Mot. at 18; see also id. at 12 (“There is no \nreason to believe that [the Sheriff] would discontinue these efforts absent the \ninjunction order.”). As the district court recognized, the Sheriff’s argument is \n“internally inconsistent.” R.109 at 8. The Sheriff cannot credibly argue that \ndeclining to stay the injunction inflicts irreparable harm while simultaneously \npromising to abide by its terms even if a stay is issued.4 \n \n4 Further evidencing the lack of irreparable harm is the Sheriff’s decision not to seek \nexpedited consideration of the merits of his appeal. \n \n15 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 17-1            Filed: 06/12/2020      Pages: 25 (17 of 32)\nIn essence, the Sheriff argues irreparable harm is always present when a \npreliminary injunction directs a defendant to take action. As the district court \nnoted, “[t]he upshot of this argument, however, is that any party appealing an \ninjunction would automatically meet the irreparable harm requirement for a stay—\nbecause an injunction is, after all, an injunction.” R.109 at 8. The district court \ncorrectly rejected this argument, for which the Sheriff cites no authority. \nThe Sheriff relies on stays issued in Valentine v. Collier, 956 F.3d 797 (5th \nCir. 2020), and Swain v. Junior, 958 F.3d 1081 (11th Cir. 2020), to bolster his \ndeference arguments. But Swain and Valentine are not instructive here for multiple \nreasons, including because they rest on different legal standards. The Eleventh \nCircuit issued a stay in Swain after finding the district court did not properly \naddress, nor did plaintiffs provide, evidence sufficient to establish the defendants’ \nsubjective intent so as to show deliberate indifference. 958 F.3d at 1089 (noting lack \nof evidence “to establish that the defendants subjectively believed the measures \nthey were taking were inadequate”). The stay order in Valentine5 similarly relied on \nfinding the district court improperly “treat[ed] inadequate measures as dispositive \nof the [d]efendants’ mental state.” 956 F.3d at 802. \n \n5 The Fifth Circuit recently vacated the Valentine preliminary injunction, finding \nthat the prison had substantially complied with its terms. Valentine v. Collier, No. 20-20207 \n(June 5, 2020).  Two of the three judges on the panel wrote separately, however, to express \nsupport for the merits of plaintiffs’ claims and concern for the prison’s conditions.  Id. at 2 \n(Davis, J., concurring) (holding prisoners under circumstances where they are unable to \nsocially distance is “nothing short of a human tragedy”); id. at 4 (Graves, Jr., J., concurring) \n(“[p]rison walls do not form a barrier separating prison inmates from the protections of the \nConstitution”). \n16 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 17-1            Filed: 06/12/2020      Pages: 25 (18 of 32)\nHere, the district court did apply the correct legal standard, and accorded the \nSheriff substantial deference in adjudicating Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction \nmotion. R.73 at 58, 63, 84. But deference does not mean blindness, and the court \nwas simultaneously obligated to evaluate whether the Sheriff ran afoul of the \nFourteenth Amendment. Brown, 563 U.S. at 511; see also King v. McCarty, 781 \nF.3d 889, 897-98 (7th Cir. 2015) (deference does not prohibit the court from \nintervening in jail management to prohibit constitutional violations). The Sheriff \nwould claim irreparable harm any time a federal court ordered him to take action to \nuphold his constitutional responsibilities. This is not the law. Given the Sheriff’s \nfailure to produce any evidence about the harm inflicted by this injunction—despite \nhaving months to do so—this Court should reject his assertion of irreparable harm. \nSee Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 90 (1974) (“Mere injuries, however \nsubstantial, in terms of money, time and energy necessarily expended in the \nabsence of a stay, are not enough” to demonstrate irreparable harm.). \nIII.  Plaintiffs Will Be Substantially Injured If This Court Stays the \nInjunction. \n \nIn contrast to the lack of harm suffered by the Sheriff, Plaintiffs will suffer \nreal harm if the stay is granted. The district court noted that the Sheriff did not \nundertake the actions at issue in the preliminary injunction voluntarily, so \n“[s]taying the injunction would permit the Sheriff to lift [those] measures and \nthereby again place the health of detained persons at serious risk.” R.109 at 10. The \ndistrict court is correct. \n17 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 17-1            Filed: 06/12/2020      Pages: 25 (19 of 32)\nThe Sheriff contends Plaintiffs will suffer no irreparable harm if a stay is \nentered because the infection rate has decreased since the preliminary injunction. \nMot. at 15. This assertion supports the necessity of leaving the injunction in place, \nlest the Sheriff abandon the court-ordered measures that the record established are \ncritical to minimizing the spread of the virus.6 R.73 at 23-28; R.48 at 18-20; R.55-7 \nat 6-7; R.64-2 at 6-13; R.64-3 at 5-6; R.64-4 at 2-3; R.1-2 at 3-9; see also United \nStates v. Oregon State Med. Soc., 343 U.S. 326, 333 (1952) (“[t]he sole function of an \naction for injunction is to forestall future violations”). \nThe timeline of the infection rate is strong evidence that the district court’s \npreliminary injunction played a pivotal role in protecting detainees’ lives. The day \nof the preliminary injunction hearing, the infection rate was nearly 70%. Hr’g at \n143:1-3. The Sheriff contends the infection rate is now 3%. Mot. at 2. The timing of \nthis claimed decrease perfectly aligns with the entry of the preliminary injunction. \nSee R.109 at 6 (“The Sheriff’s argument about positive results does not account for \nthe very real possibility that the measures ordered by the Court at the TRO and \npreliminary injunction stage contributed to those results.”).  \nThe Jail is simply not a place where ingress and egress can be limited. People \nlive in tightly confined congregate spaces. If the stay is granted and the Sheriff is \nallowed to revert the Jail to its pre-order conditions, when spread of the virus was \n \n6 The Sheriff repeats his assurance that he will abide by the terms of the injunction \neven if this Court enters a stay. As discussed above, that defeats any assertion by the \nSheriff that he will suffer irreparable harm absent a stay. It further suggests that denial of \na stay would “minimize the costs of error[,]” In re A&F Enters., 742 F.3d at 766, since the \ninjunction is not imposing any additional costs on the Sheriff’s conduct. \n18 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 17-1            Filed: 06/12/2020      Pages: 25 (20 of 32)\nrampant, there is every reason to believe that transmission rates will again \nincrease. There is no doubt that Plaintiffs will accordingly suffer measurable harm. \nIV.  Consideration of the Public Interest Counsels Against a Stay. \nThe Sheriff contends that, as a state actor, his interests and the public \ninterest “merge[.]” Mot. at 18. The Sheriff cites Nken in support, but misrepresents \nthe holding. To the contrary, Nken recognized that there is a public interest in \npreventing wrongful government action. 556 U.S. at 436. And this Court has \nsimilarly held that “[e]nforcing a constitutional right is in the public interest.” \nWhole Woman’s Health Alliance v. Hill, 937 F.3d 864, 875 (7th Cir. 2019). The \ndistrict court determined the Sheriff’s conduct had run afoul of Plaintiffs’ \nFourteenth Amendment rights, and there is substantial public interest in ensuring \nthat the Court does not give leave to the Sheriff to continue that conduct during the \npendency of this appeal. \nMoreover, just as allowing the Sheriff to abandon the measures ordered by \nthe district court will severely harm Plaintiffs, so too will it injure the public. The \nJail is part of the Cook County community. The Health Issues study shows that an \nuncontrolled rate of infection inside the Jail directly results in dire health outcomes \noutside the Jail as well. Ex. 1. As such, if this Court issues a stay, permitting the \nSheriff to abandon the measures the district court correctly found were necessary to \nprotect against uncontrolled spread of COVID-19, the entire community will be put \nat risk.  \n19 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 17-1            Filed: 06/12/2020      Pages: 25 (21 of 32)\nThe public has a strong interest in combatting the spread of COVID-19 (both \nat the Jail and in the community), and in vindicating Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth \nAmendment rights. The Sheriff’s motion for a stay is unfounded. \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court deny the \nSheriff’s motion. \n   \n20 \n\nCase: 20-1792      Document: 17-1            Filed: 06/12/2020      Pages: 25 (22 of 32)\n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n           \n            /s/ Sarah Grady       \n              Counsel for Plaintiffs-Appellees \n \n \n \nJon Loevy \nSarah Grady* \nLOEVY & LOEVY \n311 N.

For the reasons set forth in \nthe Joint Motion and further described below, the Court grants the Motion as follows: \n1.  Plaintiffs brought this case pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for injunctive relief on \nbehalf of a class of individuals detained at the Cook County Jail regarding the Sheriff’s response \nto the coronavirus.  (Joint Motion ¶ 1.) In response, the Sheriff has maintained that his actions \nhave been objectively reasonable. (Joint Motion ¶ 1.) \n2.  On April 27, 2020, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction in part, directing the Sheriff to take certain actions regarding testing, social distancing, \nhygiene materials, sanitation, and facemasks.  (Joint Motion ¶ 4.)  In granting the motion, the \nCourt found that the injunctive relief it had ordered “narrowly drawn, extends no further than \nnecessary, and is the least intrusive means necessary to address” the constitutional violation as \nrequired under 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1).  (Joint Motion ¶ 4; Dkt. 73 at 82.)   \n3.  The Sheriff has appealed the Court’s April 27, 2020 preliminary injunction order.  \n(Joint Motion ¶ 5.)  On June 19, 2020, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals stayed that part of \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 141 Filed: 07/09/20 Page 2 of 3 PageID #:3729\nthe injunction requiring the Sheriff to establish and put into effect a policy “precluding group \nhousing or double celling of detained persons.”  (Joint Motion ¶ 6.) \n4.  The Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”) provides that a preliminary \ninjunction will expire 90 days after its entry absent further action by the Court.  See 18 U.S.C. § \n3626(a)(2).  Under that provision, the Court’s April 27, 2020 preliminary injunction order would \nexpire on July 27, 2020 absent further action by the Court. \n5.  The Court finds that it has authority and jurisdiction to extend the duration of the \npreliminary injunction pending resolution of the Sheriff’s appeal of the Court’s April 27, 2020 \npreliminary injunction order.   \n6.  In the interests of judicial economy and in an effort to maintain the status quo for \nthe duration of the appeal, as well as other reasons set forth in the parties’ Joint Motion and \nelsewhere in this Order, the Court therefore grants the parties’ motion and ORDERS that its \nApril 27, 2020 preliminary injunction order, subject to the appellate court’s partial stay order, be \nextended until such time as the Court can take proper action following the return of the mandate \nto this Court from the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. This Order does not prohibit either \nparty from requesting modification of the preliminary injunction.  \n7.  The Court enters this Order without waiver of the Sheriff’s arguments regarding \nthe propriety of the Court’s findings and the entry of the preliminary injunction as set forth \nthroughout the proceedings before this Court and now in the appellate court. \n8.  In their Joint Motion the parties further agreed and jointly proposed that discovery \nin the underlying case should be stayed until such time as the Court can take proper action \nfollowing the return of the mandate to this Court from the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.  \n(Joint Motion ¶ 11.)

KENNELLY, District Judge, as emergency judge: \n  On April 27, 2020, the Court granted in part the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary \ninjunction in this class action lawsuit regarding conditions at the Cook County Jail, \nordering some of the relief sought by the plaintiffs but denying a number of their \nrequests.  See Mays v. Dart, No. 20 C 2134, 2020 WL 1987007 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 27, 2020) \n(\"Mays 2\").  The preliminary injunction tracked a temporary restraining order entered \nabout three weeks earlier but included one additional requirement.  See Mays v. Dart, \nNo. 20 C 2134, 2020 WL 1812381 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 9, 2020) (\"Mays 1\").   \n  The preliminary injunction also directed the Sheriff of Cook County—the \ndefendant in the case—to submit a report regarding compliance.  The Sheriff did this on \nMay 1, 2020.  On May 6, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a response to the Sheriff's report in \nwhich they sought expedited discovery, contending they needed this to determine \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 2 of 12 PageID #:2977\ncompliance with the preliminary injunction.  On May 11, the Sheriff objected and moved \nto strike the request for expedited discovery.  Also on May 11, the Sheriff filed a notice \nof appeal from the preliminary injunction.  Eight days after that, on May 19—a little over \nthree weeks after entry of the preliminary injunction—the Sheriff moved for a stay \npending appeal and repeated his request to strike the plaintiffs' proposed expedited \ndiscovery requests.  At the request of the judge assigned to the case, the undersigned \njudge, acting as emergency judge, directed the plaintiffs to respond to the stay motion \nthe next day and heard argument on the Sheriff's stay motion as well as the plaintiffs' \nexpedited discovery request on May 21, 2020. \n  For the reasons stated below, the Court denies the Sheriff's motion to stay the \npreliminary injunction pending appeal and also denies the plaintiffs' request for \nexpedited discovery. \nDiscussion \n  Familiarity with the Court's temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction \ndecisions is assumed.  The plaintiffs in this case contend that the Sheriff is violating the \nFourteenth Amendment due process rights of persons detained at the Jail by failing to \nprovide them with reasonably safe living conditions in the face of the coronavirus \npandemic.  In their motion for a preliminary injunction (as in their TRO motion), the \nplaintiffs sought wide-ranging relief.  This included mandatory social distancing of \ndetained persons throughout the Jail—relief that would amount to universal single-\ncelling and then some; transfer of detained persons to electronic home monitoring; and \nconvening a three-judge court under the Prison Litigation Reform Act to consider the \nrelease of detained persons.  The plaintiffs also sought measures to identify and \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 3 of 12 PageID #:2978\nseparate medically vulnerable detained persons and to require coronavirus testing, \ncleaning of Jail facilities, and provision of personal protective equipment. \n  After extensive briefing and hearings, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motions, \nbut only in part.  The Court entered a TRO including certain requirements on April 9 and \na preliminary injunction with those same requirements plus one more on April 27.  On \nboth occasions, however, the Court overruled the plaintiffs' requests for sweeping \nremedies, declining their requests to release detainees with medical vulnerabilities, \nmandate full \"social distancing\" throughout the jail, and convene a three-judge court to \nprisoner releases. \n  The Sheriff has moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal, and \nplaintiffs have moved for expedited discovery to assess the Sheriff's compliance with \nthe injunction.  The Court addresses each request in turn. \n1.  Stay pending appeal \n  In deciding whether to stay an order pending appeal, a court considers whether \nthe movant \"has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits\"; \nwhether the movant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; whether a stay \"will \nsubstantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding\"; and \"where the public \ninterest lies.\"  Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987). \n  a.  Movant's likelihood of success \n  The Sheriff has not made a \"strong showing\" of likelihood of success.  The \nrecord before the Court when it issued the preliminary injunction reflected that the \npeople detained at the Jail faced a real and persistent danger to their health.  As of April \n9, when the Court issued a temporary restraining order that embodied most of the relief \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 4 of 12 PageID #:2979\nextended via the preliminary injunction, the Jail had the largest single concentration of \nconfirmed coronavirus infections in the entire country.  See Mays 1, 2020 WL 1812381, \nat *2.  At the time of the preliminary injunction, although the number of positive-tested \ndetained persons in isolation had declined, the overall positive test numbers were \ncontinuing to increase (350 on April 17 vs. 289 on April 10), indicating that the virus was \ncontinuing to spread within the Jail.  See Def.'s Resp. to Pls.' Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 2-3.  \nBefore the issuance of the TRO and the preliminary injunction, the Sheriff had, \nundeniably, taken steps to attempt to stem the spread of the virus.  But the Constitution \ndoes not say that so long as a jailer does something, he complies with constitutional \nobligations.  Rather, if jailer does not take objectively reasonable steps to protect \ndetained persons from a known and serious risk, he violates the Fourteenth \nAmendment.  The Court concluded that plaintiffs had established a reasonable \nlikelihood of showing the objective unreasonableness of some of the Sheriff's actions or \ninaction. \n  In seeking a stay of the preliminary injunction, the Sheriff contends that he has \nconsistently acted in good faith, and the Court does not dispute this.  But the Sheriff's \nintent was not and is not the issue.  The law in this Circuit is clear that conditions of \nconfinement cases involving pretrial detainees are judged by a standard of objective \nreasonableness, not by assessing whether the Sheriff had good or bad intentions.  See, \ne.g., Hardeman v. Curran, 933 F.3d 816, 823-24 (7th Cir. 2019).  The Court notes that \nin this regard, this case is nothing like two cases cited by the Sheriff in his motion to \nstay, in which appellate courts granted stays of coronavirus-related preliminary \ninjunctions.  See Swain v. Junior, 958 F.3d 1051 (11th Cir. 2020); Valentine v. Collier, \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 5 of 12 PageID #:2980\n956 F.3d 797 (11th Cir. 2020).  The courts in those cases found a significant likelihood \nof success on the part of the jailer largely due to the absence of evidence that the jailer \nexhibited the intent required by those Circuits, specifically, deliberate indifference.  That \nis not the standard that applies in this Circuit or in this case.  The Sheriff may not have \nexhibited deliberate indifference, but that is not the same as saying that his actions or \ninaction were objectively reasonable.   \n  The Sheriff also contends that his approach has worked, citing decreases in the \nincidence of new coronavirus cases at the Jail over the last several weeks.  There are at \nleast two problems with this argument.  First, it amounts to 20/20 hindsight.  The Court \nruled, and had to rule, based on the record as it was presented at the time, not based \non how things turned out several weeks later.  Second, the TRO and preliminary \ninjunction directed the Sheriff to take steps he was not already taking or was not taking \nin an effective way.  In particular, the Court's orders directed the Sheriff to do the \nfollowing: \n•  cease the use of crowded \"bullpens\" holding multiple detained persons at intake; \n•  (on the preliminary injunction) enforce social distancing in most of the Jail; \n•  obtain and distribute facemasks to persons exposed to infected or quarantined \ndetainees; \n•  establish a Sheriff's Office policy to implement prompt testing for detained \npersons exhibiting symptoms of coronavirus disease; \n•  enable actual, not just theoretical, access to adequate sanitation supplies; and \n•  actually enforce cleaning and sanitation requirements in areas of the Jail \naccessed in common, such as showers, bathrooms, and day rooms. \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 6 of 12 PageID #:2981\nThe Sheriff's argument about positive results does not account for the very real \npossibility that the measures ordered by the Court at the TRO and preliminary injunction \nstage contributed to those results. \n  On the merits, the Sheriff's primary argument appears to be that guidelines for \nprison and jail administrators issued by the Centers for Disease Control are \ndeterminative of the question of objective reasonableness and that he has consistently \ncomplied with them.  This contention likewise has at least two flaws.  First, the Sheriff \nhas cited no authority establishing that an externally-created set of guidelines like these \namounts to a constitutional measuring stick.  Rather, the law in this Circuit is that such \nguidelines are relevant in determining objective reasonableness, but not determinative.  \nSee, e.g., United States v. Brown, 871 F.3d 532, 538 (7th Cir. 2017); Thompson v. City \nof Chicago, 472 F.3d 444, 454 (7th Cir. 1996).  In the respect most pertinent to this \ncase, the CDC guidelines set a feasibility or practicality limitation that, the Court \nconcluded, could not be determinative of the constitutional question presented by \nplaintiffs' claims.  Second, and perhaps just as importantly, the record established that \nthe Jail had not yet reached feasibility limitations regarding the spacing of detained \npersons:  the Jail's executive director so testified at the preliminary injunction hearing, \nindicating that the Jail had additional space that could be used to further spread out \ndetainees.  Thus the record reflected that the Sheriff's practices in this particular respect \ndid not measure up to the CDC guidelines. \n  Next, contrary to the Sheriff's contention, the Court did not fail to give appropriate \ndeference to the Sheriff's expertise or his interest in appropriate management of the \nJail.  To the contrary, the Court did exactly what the law requires.  See Mays 2, 2020 \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 7 of 12 PageID #:2982\nWL 1987007, at *27 (citing Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2073 (2015); Bell \nv. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547 (1979)).  Indeed, the Court rejected, both at the TRO and \npreliminary injunction stages, much—in fact most—of the relief sought by plaintiffs.  \nSpecifically, the Court declined to: \n•  order the Sheriff to identify and triage detained persons believed to be medically \nvulnerable; \n•  relocate vulnerable detainees to custodial (and perhaps non-custodial) locations \nother than the Jail; \n•  mandate full social distancing throughout the Jail; \n•  distribute personal protective equipment to every detained person; \n•  institute a robust program of coronavirus testing of all detainees throughout the \nJail; and \n•  convene a three-judge court to consider releasing detained persons from the Jail.  \nOn each of these points, the Court either found that plaintiffs were unlikely to be able to \nshow the Sheriff's actions were objectively unreasonable, or deferred to the Sheriff's \nexpertise and discretion, or both. \n  One certainly understand why, as a strategic matter, the Sheriff's motion for a \nstay omits any reference to what the Court did not order.  But a look at the full picture \nconfirms that the Court followed a careful and restrained approach, honoring both the \nconstitutional entitlement of detained persons to reasonable measures to protect their \nphysical health and the Sheriff's legitimate interest in maintaining security, preserving \norder, and making discretionary determinations regarding allocation of resources.  The \nlaw is clear that a court must consider both.  The Supreme Court has stated that \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 8 of 12 PageID #:2983\nalthough courts must be \"sensitive to . . . the need for deference to experienced and \nexpert prison administrators,\" they \"nevertheless must not shrink from their obligation to \n“enforce the constitutional rights of all persons, including prisoners.  Courts may not \nallow constitutional violations to continue simply because a remedy would involve \nintrusion into the realm of prison administration.\"  Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 492, 511 \n(2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \n  In sum, the Court concludes that the Sheriff has not shown, let along \"strongly\" \nshown, that he is likely to succeed on appeal.  \n  b.  Irreparable injury to movant \n  The Sheriff's argument regarding irreparable injury likewise falls short.  In fact, \nthe Sheriff's position on this point is internally inconsistent.  One the one hand, he \ncontends that the Court has \"undermine[d]\" his \"thoughtful and reasonable\" approach to \nthe coronavirus pandemic as it affects the Jail.  Def.'s Mot. to Stay at 13.  On the other \nhand, he contends that the Court has essentially ordered him to do what he was already \ndoing, id. at 12, thereby inserting itself as an unnecessary watchdog.  Both cannot be \ntrue at the same time.  The fact is that the Court has done neither.  The Court observes, \nthough, that it is difficult to see how the Sheriff will experience \"irreparable harm\" if he \nhas to comply with the injunction by doing what he says he would do anyway. \n  The Sheriff says that the additional burden imposed by court oversight amounts \nto irreparable harm.  The upshot of this argument, however, is that any party appealing \nan injunction would automatically meet the irreparable harm requirement for a stay—\nbecause an injunction is, after all, an injunction.  This cannot be the case.  That aside, \nthe Court has not imposed any monitoring requirements beyond the initial compliance \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 9 of 12 PageID #:2984\nreport, which the Sheriff filed over three weeks ago and thus which cannot possibly \nconstitute irreparable harm.  The Court declined plaintiffs' requests to appoint outside \nmonitors and to permit inspections of the Jail's facilities.  \n  Finally, at argument, the Sheriff's counsel seemed to suggest that the fact that \nthe plaintiffs had served discovery requests and were thereby trying to, in effect, stick \ntheir noses into his operations and decision-making amounts to irreparable harm.  This \ncannot be the case either.  Again, as the Sheriff's counsel conceded, a case does not \nend with a preliminary injunction; it is commonplace for discovery to proceed in a lawsuit \neven after a preliminary injunction is issued.  So dealing with discovery requests cannot \npossibly constitute irreparable harm either.  (Regardless, as discussed below, the Court \nis relieving the Sheriff of the burden of responding to plaintiffs' discovery requests at this \ntime).    \n  Last but not least on the question of irreparable harm, it is noteworthy that the \nSheriff waited more than three weeks after the issuance of the preliminary injunction \nbefore moving for a stay.  This cuts against the contention that the Sheriff has \nexperienced, or will experience, much harm at all, let alone harm appropriately \nconsidered to be irreparable.1  \n   \n                                            \n1 It may be that the Sheriff's real concern involves the potential for future problems \nshould increased population at the Jail limit his ability to comply with social distancing \nrequirements.  On this, though, it is worth noting that the Court specifically invited the \nSheriff to make a request to include certain at-risk detainees among those who may be \nappropriately detained in group housing, see Mays 2, 2020 WL 1987007, at *34, and to \nreturn to court to loosen the preliminary injunction's requirements if changed \ncircumstances call for it, see id. at *37.  The Sheriff has not taken the Court up on either \ninvitation. \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 10 of 12 PageID #:2985\n  c.  Injury to parties other than movant \n  The next question is whether a stay will risk substantial injury to other interested \nparties, specifically to the plaintiff class.  This is essentially the flip side of the point just \naddressed.  The Sheriff did not voluntarily take all of the coronavirus-protective \nmeasures that he cites.  Some were done pursuant to court order—either the TRO, or \nthe preliminary injunction, or both.  Staying the injunction would permit the Sheriff to lift  \nmeasures and thereby again place the health of detained persons at serious risk.  That \nrisk cannot be discounted based on the Sheriff's assurances alone.  Again, a number of \nthe measures he took were instituted only after the Court's TRO or preliminary \ninjunction.  See Mays 2, 2020 WL 1987007, at *29.  The Court finds that there is at least \nsome risk of substantial injury to detained persons if the preliminary injunction is stayed.   \n  d.  The public interest \n  On the question of the public interest, the Sheriff cites Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. \n418, 435 (2009), for the proposition that the Sheriff, as a public official, effectively \nembodies the public interest.  See Def.'s Mot. to Stay at 19.  It is not quite that simple.  \nHere the Sheriff is charged with protecting not just the public at large, but also the \ndetained persons placed in his custody, all or nearly all of whom have family members \non the outside.  Their interests are part of the public interest.  And the detained persons' \nconstitutional rights—and their health and lives—are at stake.  It is anything but clear \nthat the Sheriff can claim the public interest mantle entirely for himself.   \n  For the reasons described, the Court concludes that the Sheriff has not met the \nrequirements for a stay of the preliminary injunction.  The Court therefore denies his \nmotion to stay.   \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 11 of 12 PageID #:2986\n2.  Plaintiffs' request for expedited discovery \n  As the Court indicated earlier, and as the Sheriff's counsel conceded at \nargument, the appeal of a preliminary injunction does not require the rest of the case to \ncome to a halt in the district court.  Put another way, a preliminary injunction is not the \nfinal resolution of a case.  It follows that a party who is preliminarily enjoined is not \nrelieved of the obligation to provide discovery in response to appropriate requests.  In \naddition, as the Sheriff likewise conceded at argument, an appeal does not prevent the \ndistrict court from enforcing a preliminary injunction.  See, e.g., Union Oil Co. of Calif. v. \nLeavell, 220 F.3d 562, 565-66 (7th Cir. 2000). \n  Plaintiffs' discovery requests, they say, are aimed at determining compliance.  \nThis is plainly not the case for all of them; some involve matters beyond the relief the \nCourt ordered in the injunction.  But this does not make those particular requests \ninappropriate.  They are within the realm of permissible discovery for the ongoing \nlitigation of the case—which, again, does not end with the issuance of a preliminary \ninjunction.   The same is true of the plaintiffs' other requests; all of them appear to be \nwithin the scope of permissible discovery under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n26(b)(1).   \n  Defendants say that the Court should, and perhaps must, put the brakes on the \nplaintiffs' requested discovery because of the appeal.  The question of whether and to \nwhat extent plaintiffs may engage in discovery, however, is not an emergency issue \nwithin the scope of the undersigned judge's role as emergency judge.  The only aspect \nthat is urgent is the request for expedited discovery; that is what the undersigned judge \ntook on when requested by the assigned judge to handle the motions for a stay and for \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 109 Filed: 05/29/20 Page 12 of 12 PageID #:2987\nexpedited discovery. \n  All of that aside, the Court concludes that the expedited discovery requests have \nnot been properly served.  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 26(d), a party \n\"may not seek discovery\" before the parties have conferred under Rule 26(f) or unless \nauthorized by the Rules, a stipulation, or a court order.  None of this has happened in \nthis case.  In particular, at the time the discovery had been served there had been no \nRule 26(f) conference.   \n  For these reasons, the Court directs that the Sheriff need not answer plaintiffs' \ncurrent discovery requests.  At the conclusion of the oral argument on the present \nmotions on May 21, the Court directed the parties to submit a proposed scheduling \norder to the assigned judge by June 2, 2020 and to conduct their Rule 26(f) conference \nbefore that.   Plaintiffs may re-serve their discovery requests following the Rule 26(f) \nconference and may, if appropriate, move the assigned judge to permit expedited \ndiscovery.  \nConclusion \n  For the reasons stated above, the Court denies defendant's motion to stay the \npreliminary injunction pending appeal [dkt. no. 98] and denies plaintiffs' motion for \nexpedited discovery [dkt. no. 85]. \nDate:  May 29, 2020 \n              ________________________________ \n                MATTHEW F.

A rapidly escalating public health disaster is unfolding behind the walls of the Cook \nCounty Jail (the “Jail”).  In the 11 days since March 23, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-\n19, the disease caused by a deadly coronavirus for which there is no vaccine and no cure, has risen \nfrom one to at least 167.  A total of 46 corrections staff are also known to have COVID-19.  These \nnumbers will continue to rise dramatically because of the circumstances alleged in this complaint. \n2.  The Jail, which is operated under the supervision of defendant Thomas Dart, the \nSheriff of Cook County, has failed in its constitutional responsibility to the persons detained there \nto provide reasonable protection against the further spread of this deadly disease.  Social distancing \nwithin the Jail is currently impossible because the Jail is a crowded, congregate environment in \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 2 of 30 PageID #:2\nwhich some 4,700 individuals are detained, in dual cell or dorm quarters.  The Jail has repeatedly \nfailed and continues to fail to separate persons known to have been exposed to COVID-19 from \nother detainees.  Sanitation of surfaces and objects that are frequently touched by the infected and \nthe not-yet-infected is non-existent.  Personal hygiene is impossible because detainees do not have \nsoap or hand sanitizer.  These conditions violate applicable guidance of the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention (the “CDC”) and ensure the continued rapid, uncontrolled spread of \nCOVID-19 within the Jail and beyond—because the Jail is not and cannot be isolated from the \nlarger community. \n3.  This is a representative action on behalf of the class of persons who are detained in \nthe Jail and, because of the failings of Defendant Dart and his staff, are facing unreasonable and \nunnecessary risks of exposure to the coronavirus, possible serious respiratory illness, and death.  \n4.  Included in the class are persons at elevated risk for contracting serious COVID-19 \nand dying from the disease because they are elderly and/or have underlying health issues, such as \nasthma, other chronic respiratory problems, kidney problems or hypertension, among others.  The \nrisks to these vulnerable people from remaining in the chaotic and infectious environment that \nreigns within the Jail are unacceptable.  This group cannot, under current conditions, receive \nreasonable medical care or protection from COVID-19 within the Jail.  They must be released \nbecause, within the time frame that would be necessary to improve safety, they would suffer \nirreparable harm and are therefore jailed in violation of the Constitution of the United States. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a), and 2241(a).  \nThis Court has jurisdiction over Subclass A’s petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2241.  \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 3 of 30 PageID #:3\n6.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because the events giving \nrise to the claims asserted in this complaint occurred in this District. \nPARTIES \n7.  Plaintiff-Petitioner Anthony Mays is a detainee in Cook County Jail.  He has \ndiabetes and had been referred for an evaluation of a heart condition when COVID-19 hit the jail.  \nHe is housed in Division 8, in an open-dormitory setting.  Multiple detainees on his tier have been \nremoved after testing positive for COVID-19. \n8.  Plaintiff-Petitioner Kenneth Foster is a detainee at Cook County Jail.  This action \nis brought on Mr. Foster’s behalf by his next friend, Judia Jackson.  Ms. Jackson is aware of Mr. \nFoster’s wishes with respect to this action.  Ms. Jackson is serving as next friend because the \nundersigned counsel attempted to contact Mr. Foster by telephone within the Cook County Jail, \nbut were unable to do so due to the Jail’s operational difficulties arising out of the COVID-19 \npandemic.  See Declaration of Alison Horn (Ex. A). Mr. Foster has stomach cancer, Lung-\nSarcoidosis, high blood pressure, asthma, and bronchitis. He is living in a dorm setting in Division \n2.  Mr. Foster estimates that five or six people from his tier have tested positive for COVID-19.  \nThe people who tested positive for the virus were removed from the dorm. \n9.  Defendant-Respondent Thomas J. Dart is the Sheriff of Cook County, Illinois.  He \nis sued in his official capacity. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  The COVID-19 epidemic is a global health emergency. \n10.  The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has reached pandemic status according to \nthe World Health Organization (“WHO”).  In only a few months more than one million people \nworldwide have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and nearly 60,000 of those people have died.1  \n \n1   https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ (last visited April 3, 2020). \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 4 of 30 PageID #:4\nIn the United States alone, as this complaint is being filed, there are hundreds of thousands of \nconfirmed cases and over six thousand deaths.2  The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has \ngrown, and is expected to grow, exponentially.  The CDC projects that without swift and effective \npublic health interventions, over 200 million people in the U.S. could be infected with COVID-19 \nover the course of the epidemic, with as many as 1.7 million deaths.3  As of April 2, there were \nmore than 7,695 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Illinois, up from just 20 on March 18, 2020.  Of \nthese, 157 people have died.4 \nB.  COVID-19 is a highly contagious and lethal disease. \n11.  COVID-19 is a particularly contagious disease.  The virus can survive for up to \nthree hours in the air, as an aerosol, and can be directly transmitted by inhalation to other \nindividuals in close proximity.  Droplets can also land on surfaces and be picked up by the hands \nof another person who can then become infected by contacting a mucous membrane (eyes, mouth, \nor nose) with their hand.  COVID-19 can survive four hours on copper, up to twenty-four hours \non cardboard, and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel.5  A recent study of an early \ncluster of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China revealed the dangers of indirect transmission \n \n \n2    Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cases in U.S., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-\nus.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-in-us.html \n(last visited April 1, 2020).  \n \n3    Sheri Fink, Worst-Case Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths, The New York Times, (Mar. 13, 2020), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/coronavirus-deaths-estimate.html  \n \n4    http://www.dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/diseases-a-z-list/coronavirus (last \nvisited April 3, 2020). \n5    Dr. Michael Puisis, Dr. Robert Cohen, Dr. John Raba, Dr. Sergio Rodriguez, and Dr. Ron Shansky, \nDeclaration of Medical Professionals Concerned about the Spread of COVID-19 in the Cook County Jail \n(hereinafter Puisis et al.)

Controlling  the  spread  of  COVID-19  is  even  more  difficult  because  of  the \nprominence of asymptomatic transmission—i.e., transmission by people who are contagious but \nwho exhibit limited or no symptoms.  This poses enormous challenges to control of spread, because \nit renders ineffective any screening tools dependent on identifying disease symptoms.7 \n13.  Older adults face greater chances of serious illness or death from COVID-19.  \nCertain underlying medical conditions increase the risk of serious COVID-19 disease for people \nof any age—including lung disease, heart disease, chronic liver or kidney disease (including \nhepatitis and dialysis patients), diabetes, epilepsy, hypertension, compromised immune systems \n(such as from cancer, HIV, or autoimmune disease), blood disorders (including sickle cell disease), \ninherited metabolic disorders, stroke, and developmental delay.8  The WHO-China Joint Mission \nReport indicates that the mortality rate for those with cardiovascular disease was 13.2%, 9.2% for \ndiabetes, 8.4% for hypertension, 8.0% for chronic respiratory disease, and 7.6% for cancer.9 \n14.  For people who are older or with medical conditions that increase the risk of serious \nCOVID-19 infection, symptoms such as fever, coughing and shortness of breath can be especially \n \n6   Cai J, Sun W, Huang J, Gamber M, Wu J, He G.

In a February 29, 2020 WHO-China Joint Mission Report, the preliminary mortality rate \nanalyses showed that individuals age 70-79 had an overall 8% mortality rate, individuals age 60-\n69 had a 3.6% mortality rate, and individuals age 50-59 had a 1.3% mortality rate.  Increasingly, \nand in the United States in particular, even some younger and healthier people who contract \nCOVID-19 will require hospitalization for supportive care, including intravenous fluids and \nsupplemental oxygen.10  \n15.  Patients who eventually die do so of multiple organ failure, shock, acute respiratory \ndistress syndrome, heart failure, arrhythmias, and renal failure.11  For those who survive serious \nCOVID-19, recent clinical evidence indicates that the virus may cause damage to organs such as \nthe heart, the liver, and the kidneys, as well as to organ systems such as the blood and the immune \nsystem.12  This damage can be so extensive and severe that it may be enduring.13  Among other \nthings, patients who suffer severe symptoms from COVID-19 end up having damage to the walls \nand air sacs of their lungs, leaving debris in the lungs and causing the walls of lung capillaries to \nthicken so that they are less able to transfer oxygen going forward.14  Indeed studies of some \nrecovered patients in China and Hong Kong indicate a declined lung function of 20% to 30% after \nrecovery.15 \n \n10    Puisis et al. ¶ 10. \n \n11   Tianbing Wang et al., Comorbidities and multi-organ injuries in the treatment of COVID-19, The Lancet, \nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30558-4/fulltext (March 21, 2020). \n \n12   Tianbing Wang et al., Comorbidities and multi-organ injuries in the treatment of COVID-19, The Lancet, \nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30558-4/fulltext (March 21, 2020). \n \n13   George Washington University Hospital, GW Hospital Uses Innovative VR Technology to Assess Its First \nCOVID-19 Patient https://www.gwhospital.com/resources/podcasts/covid19-vr-technology (last visited April 1, \n2020) \n \n14   https://health.clevelandclinic.org/heres-the-damage-coronavirus-covid-19-can-do-to-your-lungs/ \n \n15   https://www.dw.com/en/covid-19-recovered-patients-have-partially-reduced-lung-function/a-52859671 \n \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 7 of 30 PageID #:7\n16.  A high percentage of people in higher risk categories who develop COVID-19 will \nneed advanced supportive care requiring highly specialized equipment that is in limited supply, \nand the dedicated attention of an entire team of care providers, respiratory therapists, and intensive \ncare doctors.16  This level of support can quickly exceed local health care resources. \n17.  There is no vaccine or known cure for COVID-19.  No one is immune, nor is there \nany known medication to prevent or treat infection.  In this setting, the only known methods to \nreduce the risk for vulnerable people of serious illness or death from COVID-19 are to prevent \ninfection through social distancing and rigorous hygiene, including washing hands frequently with \nsoap and water.   \n18.  The measures required to accomplish this prevention effectively are extreme.  The \nCDC and other public health agencies have universally prescribed social distancing—every person \nshould remain at a distance of at least six feet from every other person—and rigorous hygiene—\nincluding regular and thorough hand washing with soap and water, the use of alcohol-based hand \nsanitizer, proper sneeze and cough etiquette, and frequent cleaning of all surfaces—as the only \nways to meaningfully mitigate the spread of this virus.17  \n19.  The CDC has issued a guidance that gatherings of more than 10 people must not \noccur.18   People in congregate environments, which are places where people live, eat, and sleep \nin close proximity, face increased danger of contracting COVID-19, as already evidenced by the \n \n16   https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763879 \n \n17    Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): How to Protect Yourself, CDC, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-\nsick/prevention.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-\nncov%2Fprepare%2Fprevention.html (last visited Mar. 29, 2020).  \n \n18    Interim Guidance for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), Guidance as of 3/15/2020, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/mass-gatherings-ready-for-covid-19.html (last \nvisited Apr. 1, 2020).  \n \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 8 of 30 PageID #:8\nrapid spread of the virus in cruise ships and nursing homes.  The CDC also warns of “community \nspread” where the virus spreads easily and sustainably within a community where the source of \nthe infection is unknown.19  \nC.  Incarcerated People Are Particularly Vulnerable to COVID-19. \n20.  None of the recommended measures for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 are \navailable for persons confined in correctional facilities and for those who must interact with them.  \nJails are designed to be, and operate as, congregate environments, where the priority is security—\nnot medical quarantine.20  Many people live in dormitory-like sleeping arrangements. They have \nlimited freedom of movement and no control over the movements of others with whom they are \nrequired to congregate on a daily basis.  It is impossible to achieve the CDC’s social distancing \nstandard in these settings.21  Infectious diseases, particularly airborne diseases such as COVID-19, \nare more likely to spread rapidly between individuals in correctional facilities.22 \n21.  The risk of contracting an infectious disease is also higher in correctional facilities \nbecause the facilities are not sanitary environments.  People share toilets, sinks, and showers, and \noften have limited access to soap, hand sanitizer, hot water, and other necessary hygiene items.  \nJails are a warren of metal doors and surfaces that are touched by dozens, and sometimes hundreds, \nor correctional staff and detainees every day.  Surfaces are infrequently washed, if at all, and \ncleaning supplies are in short supply.23  Activities that free citizens can perform on their own, like \n \n19    Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): How Coronavirus Spreads, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html (last visited Apr. 1, \n2020).  \n \n20    Puisis et al. ¶¶ 16, 23-24 \n. \n21    Id., ¶  25. \n \n22   Id., ¶¶ 23-25.  \n \n23    Id.,  ¶  25. \n \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 9 of 30 PageID #:9\neating, are entirely different in the correctional setting: food, dishes, utensils, cups and trays pass \nthrough numerous hands on the way to the detainee. \n22.  The people who live in these environments—environments that defy all current \npublic health standards—are themselves at significant risk of death from COIVD-19 due to the \nhigh rates of chronic health conditions, substance use, mental health issues, and aging and \nchronically ill populations who may be vulnerable to more severe illnesses, and to death, after \ninfection  from  COVID-19.24  Prisoners  are  unusually  vulnerable  to  stress-related  and \ncommunicable diseases.  Formerly incarcerated persons suffer higher rates of certain kinds of \npsychiatric and medical problems.  Incarceration leads to higher rates of morbidity (illness rates) \nand mortality (i.e., it lowers the age at which people die).  \n23.  Health profiles of incarcerated people show that they are significantly sicker and \nmore vulnerable to COVID-19 than the population at large: \n \nPeter Wagner & Emily Widra, No need to wait for pandemics: The public health case for \ncriminal justice reform, Prison Policy Initiative (Mar. 6, 2020), \nwww.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2020/03/06/pandemic/ \n \n \n24    Id., ¶ 27. \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 10 of 30 PageID #:10\n24.  Jail health units are not equipped with sufficient emergency medical equipment, \nsuch as oxygen tanks, negative pressure rooms, and oxygen face masks, to respond to an outbreak \nof patients with respiratory distress.  For these reasons, among others, experts have warned that, \n“widespread community transmission of COVID-19 within a correctional institution is likely to \nresult in a disproportionately high COVID-19 mortality rate.”25  While Cook County Jail has a \ndedicated health unit, that unit ultimately relies on outside community hospitals to provide more \nadvanced and intensive medical care, and during an epidemic, this will not be possible, as those \noutside facilities become at or over capacity.26   \n25.  Jails, furthermore, are not closed environments.  By necessity, members of the free \ncommunity, including correctional officers, social workers, attorneys, medical personnel, and \nmany others must enter and leave jails on a daily basis.  Staff arrive and leave each facility three \ntimes a day in large numbers, and there is no current, in-place ability to adequately screen staff for \nnew, asymptomatic infection.  In addition, new detainees are admitted into jails every day, many \nof whom may be asymptomatic and thus not flagged for quarantine, even with robust intake \nscreening procedures.  When the COVID-19 virus occurs and spreads within a jail, all persons, \nstaff and prisoners alike, are at heightened risk of contracting the virus and, in turn, spreading the \nvirus to others with whom they come in contact in their own homes and neighborhoods.27   \n \n25   “COVID-19 in Correctional Settings: Unique Challenges and Proposed Responses” (March 23, 2020),  \nhttps://amend.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID-in-Corrections-Challenges-and-Solutions-1.pdf; \nsee also “Correctional Facilities In The Shadow Of COVID-19: Unique Challenges And Proposed Solutions,\" \nHealth Affairs Blog, March 26, 2020,  available at: \nhttps://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200324.784502/full/   \n \n26    Puisis et al. ¶ 18. \n \n27    Id. ¶ 27. \n \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 11 of 30 PageID #:11\n26.  It is virtually impossible, in short, to prevent an extremely contagious disease like \nCOVID-19 from entering a jail and infecting the population there. \nD.  Cook County Jail is a COVID-19 Accelerator \n27.  The danger COVID-19 poses to correctional facilities generally is even more in \nevidence at Cook County Jail.  Each of the statements in paragraphs 20 through 26, supra applies \nwith full force to the Cook County Jail.  \n28.  Local community groups have amplifying the acute danger that COVID-19 posed \nto Cook County Jail since early March.28  The Circuit Court rejected requests from the Cook \nCounty Public Defender to issue mass orders freeing low-level detainees and those who were in \ndetention solely because they could not afford their money bonds, instead requiring individual \nbond hearings for each person who might be released.  That review was expedited for detainees \nwhose court of charge was the 2600 South California Avenue complex, but no such expediting \norders were issued for detainees whose court of charge were the multiple Circuit Court locations \nin the Chicago suburbs.   \n29.  The upshot of these measures has led to the release of approximately 800 detainees \nfrom the Jail since March 20, 2020.  Those measures, however, have left more than 4,700 detainees \nin the Jail at the time of this filing.  And, as set forth below, the Jail has demonstrably failed to \nprotect these thousands of individuals from COVID-19.  \n30.  Cook County Jail is one of the largest single-site jails in the United States.  In \naddition to its 4,700 detainees, it is served by hundreds of staff who enter and leave the facility in \nthree different shifts every day.   \n \n28   https://chicagobond.org/2020/03/06/people-should-be-released-from-cook-county-jail-to-support-public-\nhealth-during-coronavirus-outbreak/ \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 12 of 30 PageID #:12\n31.  Throughout the course of a person’s detention, the Jail subjects people to one \ncongregate setting after another, as the ensuing publicly-available photographs make clear Those \ncongregate settings begin on intake, when new detainees are housed together in bullpens or similar \nenvironments, presenting a ready opportunity for the spread of the virus: \n \n32.  Many of the units housing the largest numbers of detainees are congregate settings \nas well, in which social distancing is not a remote possibility.  The photographs below depict one \nof several tiers in Division 2 of the jail (in which several of the detainees whose declarations are \nattached hereto reside), and which houses a large portion of the jail’s detainees: \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 13 of 30 PageID #:13\n  \n \n \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 14 of 30 PageID #:14\n \n33.  The situation is similar in the Jail’s Residential Treatment Unit (“RTU”), where \nmedically vulnerable detainees are housed: \n \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 15 of 30 PageID #:15\n34.  Notably, the RTU also contains numerous mentally ill detainees, who make up a \nsubstantial portion of the Jail’s population.29 Mentally ill prisoners are particularly vulnerable, \namong other reasons, because they may not have the wherewithal to inform jail staff that they feel \nill.30 \n35.  Detainees are surrounded not only by other detainees, but also numerous hard \nsurfaces that, if touched, can host COVID-19 for hours.  Such areas are the only places where \ndetainees can sit, eat, and perform any number of basic functions that persons in the free world \ncan perform in social isolation.  Indeed, the Jail is a warren of doors, sally ports, showers, \nbathrooms, and various other surfaces that are constantly being touched by jail staff and by \ndetainees all day, every day; COVID-19 can survive on such surfaces for days. And as the \nsupporting declarations make clear, the shared communal areas within the divisions are still in \ndaily use. \nE.  The Jail is not effectively preventing the spread of COVID-19. \n36.  Inside accounts from Jail staff, detainees, and Cermak medical personnel paint a \npicture of an unfolding disaster. \n37.  Detainees are housed in congregate settings.  To combat the spread of COVID-\n19, the Sheriff’s Office has implemented quarantine protocols.  As Dr. Michael Puisis, the former \nMedical Director of the Cook County Jail, and his colleagues—Cook County correctional experts, \nDr. Robert Cohen, Dr. John Raba, Dr. Sergio Rodriguez, and Dr. Ron Shansky—explain, however, \nthese protocols are insufficient and unsustainable as currently implemented:   \nInmates are still being admitted into Cook County Jail.  New inmates are being \nquarantined.  Known or suspicious cases of COVID-19 require isolation from others.  \n \n29   https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2019/01/chicagos-jail-is-the-one-of-the-countys-biggest-\nmental-health-care-providers-heres-a-look-inside/ \n \n30 Puisis et al. ¶ 21. \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 16 of 30 PageID #:16\nHowever, the housing units are not set up for mass quarantine or isolation.  The jail was \nbuilt with security in mind not medical isolation or quarantine.  For purposes of \nquarantine, the jail is cohorting groups of incoming inmates into tiers for a period of time.  \nBecause inmates continue to be incarcerated in the Jail, invariably, this will result in a \nsignificant portion of the jail dedicated to quarantine.   It is recommended that quarantine \ncontinue for 14 days.  If any individual in the cohort becomes COVID-19 positive, the \nentire group is again quarantined again for another 14 days.  As the number of persons in \nquarantine grows, managing them clinically becomes insurmountable and will result in \nfailure to manage.   \nPuisis et al. ¶ 16 (footnote omitted). \n38.  In layman’s terms, because the jail is replete with congregate settings—open \ndormitories and tiers where the persons who are likely to have been infected are cheek by jowl \nwith those who might not be—“[i]ncreasingly it is becoming difficult to separate suspect infected \npersons from the uninfected[,] and therefore infections will rise.”31 Indeed, Dr. Puisis and his \ncolleagues explain, this failure to contain infected detainees is demonstrated in the explosion of \ncoronavirus infections, from 1 to nearly 200 confirmed cases in 11 days.32 \n39.  The opinion of Dr. Puisis, Dr. Shanksy, Dr. Raba, Dr. Cohen and Dr. Rodriguez is \nconfirmed by facts on the ground.  Ample evidence shows that a large percentage of detainees \ncontinue to be housed in tightly packed dormitories or similar conditions where the virus can \nspread easily.   \n40.  On March 31, counsel for a class of jail employees in an unrelated matter wrote a \nlengthy letter to Sheriff Dart.33  Among other things the letter explains that: \n●  People arriving at the Jail’s intake unit are being placed in crowded “bull pens” and open \ndorms, not single cells.  Such bullpens and dormitories, which are depicted above, \n \n31   Puisis et al. ¶  17. \n \n32   Id. \n \n33   March 31, 2020 Letter from Marni Willenson, Caitlin Cervenka, Matthew J. Piers, Caryn Lederer, Cyrus \nMehri, Ellen Eardley, and Michael D. Lieder to Thomas J. Dart and Toni Preckwinkle (hereinafter “March Letter) \n(Ex. C). \n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 17 of 30 PageID #:17\nfacilitate the spread of the virus, as the Puisis et al. declaration makes clear. \n \n●  Incarcerated peoples were moved off a tier to reduce occupancy on that tier to one person \nper cell--but they are being moved to Division 2, which has dormitory style bunks.  The \ntype of Division 2 dormitory bunking, which is depicted in photographs above, makes \nsocial distancing impossible. \n \n●  The Sheriff opened a “boot camp” building to quarantine other detainees. Nobody in the \nboot camps is housed in single cells, however; instead it is a dormitory setting that leaves \ndetainees to be housed with infected people.34 \n \n●  Even in situations where detainees are not housed in dormitories, they are not isolated, \neither.  To the contrary, officers assigned to multiple housing divisions report that people \nare still double or even quadruple bunked.  \n \n41.  The March 31 staff letter is consistent with accounts of detainees, set forth in the \ndeclarations filed in support of this action, who are or were housed throughout the Jail, and who \nreport crowded, dormitory conditions throughout the facility.  These detainees report that, in \naddition to the packed settings, detainees are essentially powerless to practice adequate hygiene or \nsocial distancing.  The declarations submitted on behalf of the detainees make clear that all are at \nrisk of exposure to COVID-19 positive or symptomatic detainees, all lack access to adequate \ncleaning supplies and sanitizing agents, all lack any form of personal protective equipment (PPE), \nnone are able to engage in social distancing or indeed any distancing in dorm and double-celling \nliving quarters with shared shower and bathroom areas, and all lack adequate medical care, \nincluding for those detainees with symptoms of COVID-19.35 In particular: \n \n34   Puisis et al. also opined that the boot camp had “insufficient jail medical staff to staff this unit which is in \npart or in whole staffed by individuals from the Cook County Health and Hospital System’s ambulatory centers \nwhich are now closed.” Puisis et al. ¶ 18. \n \n35 The information in this complaint that is specified as originating from interviews of detainees in the Jail is \nsupported by the additional declarations of Sean Alexander (Ex.

He has diabetes and had been referred for an evaluation \nof a heart condition when COVID-19 hit the jail.  He is housed in Division 8, in an open-\ndormitory setting.  The dormitory has beds that are paced two feet apart.  There are \napproximately 40 beds on Mr. Mays’ tier, and it is full (“packed”).  Mays estimates that \nonly two of the beds are empty.

Mr. Stewart is housed in Division 8, in an open dormitory setting.  \nEveryone in the dormitory must share the same microwave for cooking food.  He has \nbeen given no additional cleaning or sanitizing products since the outbreak of COVID-19 \nin Illinois and in the Jail.  He states that detainees are not given any personal protective \nequipment. Affidavit of Matthew McLoughlin on Behalf of Shirley Stewart for Vincent \nStewart (Ex.

He is living in a dorm \nsetting in Division 2. He sleeps on a lower bunk. Everyone on his tier sleeps very close \ntogether.  Everyone on Mr. Foster’s tier shares a shower and bathroom area. Everyone is \ntogether all the time and there is very little privacy.  Five or six people from Mr. Foster’s \ndorm have tested positive for COVID-19.  The people who tested positive for the virus \nwere removed from the dorm. Affidavit of Christina Lorenzo on Behalf of Judia Jackson \nfor Kenneth Foster (Ex. F). \n \n●  Sharita Parks is 35 years old.  She is housed in Division 8, in an open-dormitory setting.  \nThe other detainees on her tier sleep close to her, and all the women on the dormitory \nshare a bathroom and shower area, as well as a common eating area. One woman in the \ntier tested positive for COVID-19, and was removed from the dorm. Affidavit of \nChristina Lorenzo on Behalf of Crystal Smith for Sharita Parks (Ex. G). \n \n●  Charles Wimberly is 22 years old.  He has bronchitis. Mr. Wimberly is housed in \nDivision 6.  He shares a cell with another cellmate.  The detainees in the division have a \nshared shower area. Mr. Wimberly does not have access to soap. He has not received \nhand sanitizer in over a week. He states that the Jail does not provide personal protective \nequipment to detainees. Mr. Wimberly uses his shirt to cover the phone, because staff are \nnot cleaning the phones. Affidavit of Christina Lorenzo on Behalf of Jala Burns for \nCharles James Wimberly (Ex. H).  \n \n●  Carver Young was housed in Division 2 until he was released from the Jail on March 26.  \nHis tier was a large dormitory room, shared with 350 to 400 other people. They spent all \nday in the same room.  Bunks in Division 2 were approximately a foot apart.  There were \nabout 30 showers, 11 or 12 toilets, and 4 large sinks with 3 hoses on each sink shared by \nall the men.  At the time he left, each detainee received one small bar of soap per week.  \n \n(Ex.

Despite those symptoms, he is still \nco-living with a cellmate. Division 6, where he resides, is on lockdown because it is in \nquarantine. Two men in the division got sick with the virus. Both were transferred off the \ndeck. Mr. Robinson does not know what happened to them. Declaration of Christina \nLorenzo on Behalf of Mary Robinson for Terrance Robinson (Ex.

Mr. Mathis \nwas previously shot in the throat, and his throat was reconstructed, making it hard for him \nto breathe. He had open heart surgery when he was a child. He suffers from blood clots \nand swelling in his feet. Social distancing is not possible in the division. All detainees are \nclose together when they are in the common room, on the phones, or in the dayroom.  Mr. \nMathis has not been tested for COVID-19 but he has started to feel sick. He feels hot and \nlike he cannot breathe, and suffers headaches. Declaration of Christina Lorenzo on Behalf \nof Andjine Doret for Brandon Mathis (Ex. K). \n \n42.  The Jail’s medical staff is being depleted by COVID-19.  COVID-19 has a high \nrate of infection among medical staff who care for coronavirus patients, which appears to be \ndepleting ranks of medical staff at the Jail.36  What is more, COVID-19 patients require intensive \ncare and attention from skilled medical staff to ensure that they remain stable, which taxes \navailable staff even further.37   \n43.  The Jail’s medical staff is so diminished that medical personnel have no ability to \nmonitor detainees.  This has meant that detainees in non-quarantined environments cannot be \nmonitored and caught early should they become symptomatic.  Even detainees on quarantined tiers \nhave been largely abandoned. While Division 6 has been quarantined—as reported by multiple \ndetainees—and though the Division hosted one of the first detainees to have tested positive with \nCOVID-19,38 detainees there do not report increased testing or even temperatures being taken \n \n36    Puisis et al. ¶ 18 \n \n37   Id.  \n \n38   https://news.wttw.com/2020/03/23/2-detainees-cook-county-jail-test-positive-covid-19 \n19 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 20 of 30 PageID #:20\nwithin the facility.  Corroborating this account, detainees report that their tiers no longer have sick \ncall slips, with the effect that visibly sick detainees have no way to report their illnesses to medical \npersonnel.39 \n44.  That is confirmed by the March 31 staff letter.  Staff report that “neither the \nSheriff’s Office nor Cook County Health is conducting regular temperature checks on incarcerated \npeople to identify those with symptoms of COVID-19.”  Detainees in the quarantine tiers are not \nbeing monitored or having their temperature taken because there are not enough nurses to do so.  \nWithout any infection control, these “quarantines” are really just incubators of the infection and \nare rapidly spreading the disease. \n45.  Additionally, with so few medical staff, the existing health staff employees—i.e., \nthose dealing with sick detainees—must travel all over the facility to carry out their duties, \npotentially spreading the illness from one division to another.  Indeed, to make matters worse, the \nMarch 31 letter reports that many of these employees do not have access to N95 masks, increasing \ntheir  chances  of  infection  and  further  raising  the  risk  that  they  will  infect  other  staff  and \nincarcerated people, spreading the infection even further.  \n46.  The Jail does not have sufficient personal protective equipment.  Because there \nare still so many detainees to oversee, a large number of staff are needed throughout the Jail \ncomplex.  And there is not enough personal protective equipment (“PPE”) to go around.  N95 \nmasks are being rationed among officers, and those officers who do have PPE are being limited to \none mask per shift.   Other officers have been given surgical masks and told to store them in plastic \nbags for reuse, and many officers have no masks at all.  Staff who work on quarantine units, \nmeanwhile,  are  given  more  protective  equipment,  but  they  are  told  to  re-use  it  or  have  it \n \n \n39   Affidavit of Stephen Weil on Behalf of Anthony Mays. \n20 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 21 of 30 PageID #:21\n“sanitized”—even when the equipment is specified as single-use.  There is no indication that such \nsingle-use protective equipment can be effectively sanitized, particularly for a new and little \nunderstood virus.   \n47.  And as the supporting declarations make clear, on information and belief, no \ndetainees have access to any PPE, even if they are symptomatic. \n48.  The Jail has not been able to provide basic hygiene.  The Sheriff also has not \ntrained all its staff in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.  Staff report that “Officers have not been \ntrained on how to teach incarcerated people to properly disinfect showers, bathrooms, common \nspaces in housing units that numerous people and employees come into contact with, or their own \ncells. Officers also uniformly report that the Sheriff’s Office has not provided them with additional \ndisinfectant or other cleaning supplies to sanitize their own workspaces or other surfaces in the \nfacility that numerous employees come into contact with. Employees report that cleaning supplies \nthat used to be available, including disinfectant wipes, have disappeared. In addition, multiple \nemployees report the reuse of dirty rags without proper disinfection.”   \n49.  Correctional staff have not been trained to avoid spreading the disease.  With so \nmany staff still needed to operate the jail, there evidently have not been enough time or resources \nto train them.  The March 31 staff letter reports that “[c]orrectional personnel have not been trained \non how to protect themselves from contracting or spreading COVID-19.”  Staff have not been \ntrained either in protecting themselves or the people incarcerated, how to disinfect the various \nsurfaces in the jail that are touched by incarcerated people and staff constantly, or how to safely \ndispose of the minimal personal protective equipment that they have been provided.   \n50.  This  failure  to  train  is  acute.    It  includes  correctional  staff  assigned  to  the \nquarantined tiers housing people who have tested positive for COVID-19.  Having received no \n21 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 22 of 30 PageID #:22\ntraining in how to avoid transmission, these staff routinely exit the COVID-19 quarantines and \ncross-contaminate passageways, work areas, and other parts of the Jail. \n51.  The Jail cannot stop corrections staff from importing the virus.  COVID-19 poses \na particular threat because a person can be entirely asymptomatic, yet spread the disease to others.  \nThe drastic social distancing measures that have been imposed across the country are designed to \ncombat precisely this problem—staying at home, we are able to limit our contact with other \npersons, even those who are asymptomatic.  But every day hundreds of jail employees, working \non three different shifts, travel into and out of the jail.  Any one of those employees can be \ncarrying—and transmitting—COVID-19, and Sheriff Dart has candidly admitted he has no means \nof stopping this disease vector. \n52.  But the Sheriff has failed to take even modest measures to cut back on the \ntransmission.  The March 31 letter also reports that, apparently due to a lack of medical staff, \ntemperature checks are not being performed on all staff entering the jail, either.  Indeed, a number \nof employees assigned to the Jail’s health facility report that they were not checked at all.  And the \nMarch 31 letter reports that while some temperature checks appear to have begun on staff entering \nsome facilities, they are being done with industrial temperature “guns” that are specifically marked \nas “not for use on humans or animals,” indicating the Sheriff simply lacks the capacity to conduct \ntesting. \n53.  In so many words, the Jail has failed, in plenary fashion, to implement basic \nmeasures that will prevent the COVID-19 pandemic from sweeping through the facility.  \nF.  COVID-19 is overrunning the Cook County Jail. \n54.  That  catastrophe,  indeed,  has  arrived.  On  March  22,  the  first  Cook  County \nDepartment of Corrections employee tested positive for COVID-19. On March 23, the first \n22 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 23 of 30 PageID #:23\nincarcerated person tested positive.  That was eleven days ago.  Officially, as of this filing 46 Jail \nstaff have tested positive, while 167 detainees have tested positive.  That “attack rate”—that is, the \nrate at which the population is being infected—is a double-digit multiple of the rate in Cook \nCounty.     \n55.  Put differently, the Cook County Jail has shown itself to be a powerful accelerator \nof COVID-19.  The Jail’s detainees, and its staff, are all drawn from Cook County.  In Cook \nCounty, the current COVID-19 infection rate is .87 per 1,000 people.  The rate of infection inside \nthe jail on the other hand, is 35.45 per 1,000 people—40 times the infection rate of the surrounding \npopulation.     \n56.  If anything, however, these figures dramatically undercount the rate of infection.  \nStaff and detainees alike report that hundreds of detainees still live in congregate dorms where \nlittle or no preventative testing is being done to identify and remove sick detainees.  Moreover, as \nDr. Puisis and his colleagues set forth, the logic of “quarantine” in such settings is simply \nunsustainable40; the Jail, rather, is quickly reaching a the point where it will be forced to house \ndetainees suffering from COVID-19 in open, close settings with hundreds of other people, leaving \nthis highly contagious disease to spread freely and rapidly in the population.  And given the serious \nailments that many detainees already suffer from, there is every reason to expect that numerous \ndetainees at the Jail will die if they are not released immediately. The Sheriff has ceased updating \ndaily information on the number of infected detainees at the Jail.  The last update of the infection \ncount occurred on April 2. \n57.  The Sheriff has the authority to address these conditions. But he has intentionally \nfailed to use it to protect the lives of those in the Jail. Under the Illinois County Jail Act, 730 ILCS \n \n40 Pusis et al. ¶ 16. \n23 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 24 of 30 PageID #:24\n§ 125/14, when the Sheriff, as the Warden of the Jail, believes “the lives or health of the prisoners \nare endangered,” he has the authority to “remove” a “group of prisoners… to some suitable place \nwithin the county… where they may be confined until they can be safely returned to the place \nwhence they were removed.” This statutorily-created authority, in effect since 2012, endows the \nSheriff with the ability to place prisoners in his custody who face a health risk on Electronic \nMonitoring or Home Confinement or in some other place in Cook County, in order to protect the \nlives of those prisoners. \n58.  The Sheriff has intentionally failed to utilize this statutory authority in the midst \nof a national pandemic and state emergency, while a growing number of detainees and staff are \ninfected and made sick every day.  \n59.  As a result, the Sheriff has been deliberately indifferent to the rights and \nwellbeing of all the prisoners in his custody, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n60.  Pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the \nindividual named Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and a class consisting of all \npeople who are currently or who will in the future be housed in the Cook County Jail for the \nduration of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The class allegations and law are set forth in more detail in \nthe accompanying motion for class certification. \n61.  This Class includes two subclasses. Subclass A consists of all people who, because \nof age or previous medical conditions, are at particularly grave risk of harm from COVID-19.  \n62.  Subclass B consists of all people who are currently housed on a tier where someone \nhas already tested positive for the coronavirus. \n24 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 25 of 30 PageID #:25\n63.  A class action is the only practicable means by which the individual named \nPlaintiffs and the class members can challenge the Sheriff’s unconstitutional actions. Many \nmembers of the class are without the means to retain an attorney to represent them in a civil rights \nlawsuit. \n64.  The class and subclasses are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical. \nThe number of people in custody exceeds 4,700, and each subclass contains at least hundreds of \npersons.  Specifically, demographic data regarding the health of correctional populations, which \nis set forth above, indicates that Subclass A consists of hundreds of persons.  Subclass B, likewise, \nconsists of hundreds of persons, including but not limited to all detainees in Division 6, who live \non tiers where one or more infected persons was present. \n65.  There are questions of law and fact common to all class members and the subclass, \nincluding, among many others: (1) does COVID-19 present a substantial risk of harm to people \ndetained in the Cook County Jail? And (2) is the Sheriff adequately protecting the class members \nfrom the risk of serious harm?  These questions are also typical to each member of the sub-classes.  \nAdditionally,  the  members  of  Subclass  A  share  the  common  question  of  their  particular \nvulnerability to the COVID-19 pandemic, while the members of Subclass B share the common \nquestion regarding whether they are entitled to a safer environment. \n66.  The claims of the class representatives are typical of the claims of the class, and of \nthe subclasses.  That typicality stems from their claim that Dart has placed them at significant risk \nof harm by failing to take appropriate steps to address the risk of COVID-19 throughout the Cook \nCounty Jail.  Every person at the Jail faces a heightened risk of risk of contracting COVID-19 if \nthey are not adequately protected by Dart.   \n25 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 26 of 30 PageID #:26\n67.  The claims of the subclass representatives are typical of the subclass members as \nwell.  The claims of the representatives of Subclass A are typical as each member is subject to \nincreased risk as a result of their existing medical conditions. The claims of the representatives of \nSubclass B are typical in that they are all threatened with infection because of their housing \nlocation, which would be resolved with the proposed remedy. \n68.  The individual named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of \nthe class and subclasses. The named Plaintiffs have no conflicts with the unnamed members of the \nproposed class. In addition, their lawyers are experienced in federal court civil rights class actions, \nparticularly those involving prisons and jails. \n69.  The Defendant has failed to act in a manner that applies generally to the class as a \nwhole, rendering class-wide injunctive and declaratory relief appropriate. \nCOUNT I \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 (on behalf of all Class members), Fourteenth Amendment \n \n70.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in this \nCount. \n71.  Plaintiffs and the classes they represent have been deprived and continue to be \ndeprived by the Defendant of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to reasonably safe \nliving conditions.  Specifically, Defendant is aware of the substantial risk of harm that COVID-19 \nposes to all individuals, and is further aware of the particular risks of severe illness and possible \ndeath that Plaintiffs face as a result of the inherently congregate and unclean settings in the Cook \nCounty Jail.  Despite this knowledge, Defendant has failed to take reasonable measures to mitigate \nthese dangers. \n72.  As a result of Defendant’s actions and inactions, class members face a substantial \nrisk of contracting COVID-19 and sustaining a serious illness that could lead to death.   \n26 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 27 of 30 PageID #:27\n73.  Defendant’s failure to take appropriate steps to curb the substantial threat posed by \nCOVID-19 to each person in his custody, as described more fully above, violates Plaintiff’s rights \nto unreasonable risk of death and bodily harm. \n74.  Consequently, the Defendants are in continuous violation of these Plaintiffs’ rights \nand the rights of the members of the subclasses under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution. \n75.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief against all Defendants to prevent \nthe continued violation of the rights of Plaintiffs and the class they represent. \nCOUNT II \nPetition for Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (on behalf of Subclass A) \n \n76.  Subclass A petitioners repeat and re-allege the preceding paragraphs as if fully set \nforth in this Count. \n77.  Subclass A Petitioners are not in custody pursuant to a judgment of conviction of a \nstate court. \n78.  Subclass A Petitioners should be deemed to have exhausted state court remedies.  \nBecause they seek release in light of the immediate and urgent risks to their health and lives, there \nis no remedy that could be pursued in the courts of the State of Illinois that would protect their \nrights.  Exhaustion of any such remedy would be futile. \n79.  Respondent is holding Subclass A Petitioners in custody in violation of the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.  Due \nProcess forbids exposing Petitioner to a severe risk of death, pain, or permanent severe injury, and \nat this time no options available to Respondent will adequately mitigate that risk other than \nimmediate release from custody. \n27 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/03/20 Page 28 of 30 PageID #:28\nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \n \n          WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and the class they seek to represent, \nrequest that this Court enter judgment in their favor and against Defendant Tom Dart and order \nthe following relief: \na.

KENNELLY, District Judge:1 \n  Anthony Mays and Kenneth Foster2 are pretrial detainees at Cook County Jail in \nChicago, Illinois.  On behalf of themselves and a putative class, they have sued the \nCook County Sheriff Thomas Dart, who operates the Jail, alleging that he has violated \ntheir rights under the Fourteenth Amendment by failing to provide them with reasonably \nsafe living conditions in the face of the current coronavirus pandemic.  The plaintiffs \nassert claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and for writs of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § \n2241.  They have moved for entry of a temporary restraining order requiring the Sheriff \n                                            \n1  Judge Kennelly is addressing this matter as emergency judge pursuant to paragraph \n5 of Second Amended General Order 20-0012. \n \n2 The claim for Foster is brought by Judia Jackson, his next friend, because plaintiffs' \ncounsel attempted to contact Foster by telephone but were unable to reach him due to \nthe Jail's operational limits arising out of the coronavirus pandemic.  \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 2 of 37 PageID #:1068\nto take additional precautions to stem the spread of coronavirus into and within the Jail.  \nUltimately, plaintiffs contend, they cannot be held at the Jail in a way that is consistent \nwith their constitutional rights—though they do not seek outright release from custody \nas part of their motion for a temporary restraining order.  Rather, they seek changes in \nthe Sheriff's policies, including in how they are carried out, as well as, for one proposed \nsubclass, a change in the locations where they are kept in custody.  See Emerg. Mot. \nfor Temp. Restraining Order of Prelim. Inj., dkt. no. 2, at 15-16, 17–19 (spelling out the \nrelief sought on the request for a TRO).   \n  The Court begins by acknowledging the importance of the issues presented by \nthe parties.  The Sheriff is responsible for operating and administering a very large \nphysical facility—actually a campus of separate physical facilities—whose population, if \none considers including both detainees and staff, is the size of a small (but not all that \nsmall) town.  This is an extraordinarily difficult task.  The detainee population runs the \ngamut from persons with lengthy criminal records who are accused of committing \nviolent crimes to non-violent offenders in custody for the first time who, perhaps, remain \nin custody only because they and their families were unable to post bond money.  And it \nalso runs the gamut from young, healthy persons to older detainees with serious \nmedical or mental health issues.  Operating the Jail, even under normal circumstances, \nis a very challenging task that occupies a large, full-time staff of policymakers, subject \nmatter experts, and front-line correctional officers, medical and mental health workers, \ncounselors, and others.  And these are not normal circumstances.  Fashioning a public \npolicy and public health response to the coronavirus pandemic has challenged \ngovernment officials across our country and throughout the world, who are facing a \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 3 of 37 PageID #:1069\ncrisis unlike any we have faced for decades, and perhaps generations.  The task is no \nless difficult, and no less unfamiliar, for administrators of jails.    \n  This does not mean, however, that constitutional protections fall by the wayside.  \nGovernment officials in our country are bound by constitutional requirements even when \nthey are dealing with difficult and unfamiliar challenges to public health and safety.  \nPersons accused of crimes who are detained pending trial do not shed their \nconstitutional rights at the jailhouse door.  The government has determined to lock them \nup pending determination of their guilt or innocence, and by doing so the government \ntakes on an obligation to protect their health and safety.  And it cannot be forgotten that \nby requiring this, we safeguard the health and safety of the community at large—from \nwhich the detainees have come and to which they and the officers guarding them will \nreturn. \n  In light of these considerations, and for the reasons stated below, the Court \nissues a temporary restraining order, though considerably narrower than the order the \nplaintiffs have requested.  In particular, the Court declines the plaintiffs' request to \nrequire the Sheriff to move certain of them to other forms of custodial arrangements \nsuch as home incarceration. \nBackground \n  Mays and Foster have serious medical conditions that make them highly \nvulnerable to complications arising from what has been termed COVID-19, a novel form \nof coronavirus that is causing a global pandemic.  (The Court will use the term \ncoronavirus.)  As of this morning, 432,550 Americans and over 1,502,610 people \naround the world have been diagnosed with the virus—figures that understate its \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 4 of 37 PageID #:1070\nspread, as they include only those who have managed to get tested.    See Coronavirus \nResource Center, Johns Hopkins Univ. & Med., https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/ (last \nupdated April 9, 2020, 8:38 A.M.).  Over 89,910 have died, including over 14,800 \nAmericans.  Id.  At present, there is no known cure and no known vaccine. \n  People over the age of 65 and people of all ages with serious underlying medical \nconditions face an elevated risk of suffering from severe illness if they contract \ncoronavirus.  Because the virus spreads more rapidly when people are in close contact \nwith each other, government officials have drastically reduced activity involving person-\nto-person contact in cities, nations, and economies around the world, including Chicago \nand Illinois.   \n  Reducing the spread of the virus is, however, especially challenging in jails and \nprisons.  The Cook County Jail is a complex where, at any given time, thousands of \ndetainees live in either barracks-style dormitories, shared cells, or individual cells as \nthey await trial on the crimes of which they have been accused.  As of April 8, 2020, 251 \ndetainees and 150 employees at the Jail have tested positive for coronavirus, and one \ndetainee has died of apparent complications from it.  See COVID-19 Cases at CCDOC, \nCook County Sheriff's Office, https://www.cookcountysheriff.org/covid-19-cases-at-\nccdoc/ (last updated April 8, 2020, 5:00 P.M.).  While the Court was drafting this \nopinion, the news broke that the Jail is the largest single known source of infections in \nthe nation.  See Timothy Williams and Danielle Ivory, \"Chicago’s Jail is Top U.S. Hot \nSpot as Virus Spreads Behind Bars\" (April 8, 2020), N.Y. Times, \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/coronavirus-cook-county-jail-chicago.html (last \nupdated April 9, 2020, 8:47 A.M.).    The plaintiffs allege that conditions at the Jail—\n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 5 of 37 PageID #:1071\nincluding, for example, the very close proximity in which detainees are held in the Jail’s \nhousing divisions and intake areas, inadequate distribution of soap and sanitation \nsupplies for detainees, and a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) for detainees \nwho have been exposed to others with symptoms of the virus—violate constitutional \nrequirements. \n  On April 3, 2020, the plaintiffs filed this lawsuit.  In Count 1, they allege, under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983, that the Sheriff has violated their Fourteenth Amendment right to \nconstitutionally adequate living conditions by failing to implement appropriate measures \nto control the spread of the virus.  In Count 2, they petition for writs of habeas corpus \nthrough 28 U.S.C. § 2241 because, they contend, they cannot constitutionally be \ndetained at the Jail during the pandemic. \n  At the same time the plaintiffs filed suit, they moved to certify a class consisting \nof \"all people who are currently or who will in the future be housed in the Cook County \nJail for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.\"  Compl., dkt. no. 1, ¶ 60.  They also \nrequested certification of two subclasses.  \"Subclass A consists of all people who, \nbecause of age or previous medical conditions, are at particularly grave risk of harm \nfrom COVID-19.\"  Id. ¶ 61.  \"Subclass B consists of all people who are currently housed \non a tier where someone has already tested positive for the coronavirus.\"  Id. ¶ 62.   \n  The plaintiffs also immediately moved for a temporary restraining order or \npreliminary injunction requiring implementation of specified preventive and protective \nmeasures at the Jail.  See Emerg. Mot. for Temp. Restraining Order of Prelim. Inj., dkt. \nno. 2, at 15-16.  The measures that the plaintiffs seek to implement would require the \nSheriff to triage medically vulnerable detainees, enable social distancing, provide \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 6 of 37 PageID #:1072\ndetainees with adequate supplies for sanitation and handwashing, distribute PPE to \ndetainees, and take additional steps when quarantining and isolating symptomatic of \ncoronavirus positive detainees, among other things.  And, as indicated, their motion \nseeks relocation of certain class members to other custodial locations.  On April 7, \n2020, the Court held a hearing on the motion, at which counsel appeared and argued \nvia telephone. \nDiscussion \nA.  Conditional class certification \nThe plaintiffs seek classwide relief in the form of a temporary restraining order, \nbut because the lawsuit was just filed there has not yet been a class certification ruling.  \nThis does not foreclose the possibility of relief for the plaintiffs at this stage, because a \ndistrict court has general equity powers allowing it to grant temporary or preliminary \ninjunctive relief to a conditional class.  Lee v. Orr, No. 13 CV 8719, 2013 WL 6490577, \nat *2 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 10, 2013) (citing Ill. League of Advocates for the Developmentally \nDisabled v. Ill. Dep't of Human Servs., No. 13 C 1300, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90977, at \n*10-11 (N.D. Ill. June 28, 2013)); see also Al Otro Lado v. Wolf, 952 F.3d 999, 1005 n.4 \n(9th Cir. 2020); Gooch v. Life Inv'rs Ins. Co. of Am., 672 F.3d 402, 433 (6th Cir. 2012) \n(\"[T]here is nothing improper about a preliminary injunction preceding a ruling on class \ncertification.\"); Howe v. Varity Corp., 896 F.2d 1107, 1112 (8th Cir. 1990).  Furthermore, \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) \"does not restrict class certification to instances \nwhen final injunctive relief issues\" and permits certification of a conditional class for the \npurpose of granting preliminary injunctive relief.  Meyer v. Portfolio Recovery Assocs., \nLLC, 707 F.3d 1036, 1043 (9th Cir. 2012); see also Howe, 896 F.2d at 1112 (affirming \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 7 of 37 PageID #:1073\ngrant of a preliminary injunction to a conditional class).   \nUnder Rule 23(a), the four prerequisites for class certification are numerosity, \ncommonality, typicality, and adequate representation.  Beaton v. SpeedyPC Software, \n907 F.3d 1018, 1025 (7th Cir. 2018).  \"Once these four prerequisites are satisfied, the \npotential class must also satisfy at least one provision of Rule 23(b).\"  Rosario v. \nLivaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1017 (7th Cir. 1992).  The plaintiffs have made a sufficient \nshowing for conditional certification of Subclasses A and B for the purpose of the \npresent motion for a temporary restraining order.   \nAs for the first prerequisite, numerosity, there is \"no magic number\" that is \nregarded as sufficient, but forty is generally accepted as sufficient to satisfy Rule 23(a).  \nMulvania v. Sheriff of Rock Island Cty., 850 F.3d 849, 859 (7th Cir. 2017).  It is \nundisputed that there are over 4,000 detainees in the Jail, and the plaintiffs cite \nstatistics that in incarcerated populations, on average 15 percent of the detainees have \nasthma, 10 percent have heart conditions, 10 percent have diabetes, and 30 percent \nhave hypertension.  Applying even the lowest of these percentages to the detainee \npopulation of over 4,000 yields hundreds of detainees with medical conditions that \nheighten the risk of harm from a coronavirus infection.  This is sufficient to establish \nnumerosity for conditional certification of Subclass A.  As for Subclass B, the plaintiffs \nhave likewise sufficiently demonstrated numerosity for purposes of conditional \ncertification.  Over two hundred detainees have tested positive for coronavirus, and \nmost detainees are housed in tiers which are shared with anywhere from forty to several \nhundred other detainees.  This is sufficient to show that there are likely far more than \nforty detainees in proposed Subclass B. \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 8 of 37 PageID #:1074\nThere is also commonality with respect to the claims of Subclass A member and \nSubclass B members.  Commonality requires at least one question common to all the \nclass members, the answer to which is “apt to drive the resolution of the \nlitigation.\"   Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011).  Both subclasses' \nclaims turn on a common question of whether detainees are facing an unconstitutional \nrisk of harm to their health due to conditions in the Jail that facilitate the spread of \ncoronavirus and the absence of protections adequate to stem its spread. \n  The Seventh Circuit has explained that a named plaintiff's claims are typical if \nthey \"arise[ ] from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the \nclaims of other class members and [are] based on the same legal theory.\" Lacy v. Cook \nCounty, 897 F.3d 847, 866 (7th Cir. 2018).  The claims of the named plaintiffs here are \ntypical of the class, because the named plaintiff and the members of the class all \ncontend that they face a serious risk of contracting coronavirus due to the Jail's \nallegedly deficient living conditions and precautions, and they and the class seek the \nsame relief.  In addition, the named plaintiffs' claims are typical of the putative members \nof Subclass A, who all contend that they face an elevated risk of experiencing \ncomplications if they contract coronavirus, and of the putative members of Subclass B, \nwho all claim exposure at the Jail to someone who has already tested positive. \nThere is also adequate representation of both subclasses by Foster.  Under this \nrequirement of Rule 23(a), the named plaintiff must be a member of the putative class \nand must have the same interest and injury as other members.  Beaton, 907 F.3d at \n1027.  Foster alleges that he faces heightened risk of harm from coronavirus infection \nbecause he suffers from stomach cancer, lung disease, asthma, and bronchitis, so he is \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 9 of 37 PageID #:1075\na member of putative Subclass A.  And because several people on Foster's tier have \ntested positive for coronavirus, he is also a member of putative Subclass B.  Foster \nshares an interest with members of both subclasses in relief from the jail conditions that \nthe classes allege have put them at risk severe risk of health harm from coronavirus.   \nIn sum, the requirements of Rule 23(a) are sufficiently met to allow provisional \ncertification of both subclasses for purposes of the motion for temporary restraining \norder. \n  Rule 23(b)(2) permits class actions if \"the party opposing the class has acted or \nrefused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,\" so that injunctive or \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate for the class as a whole.  The plaintiffs satisfy this \nrequirement because they seek \"the same . . . injunctive relief for everyone\" in the class \nand in each subclass.  See Chi. Teachers Union, Local No. 1 v. Bd. of Educ. of Chi., \n797 F.3d 426, 442 (7th Cir. 2015). \n  For these reasons, the Court conditionally certifies Subclasses A and B for the \npurpose of the motion for a temporary restraining order. \nB.  Temporary restraining order  \n  The Court addresses in this decision only the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary \nrestraining order, not their motion for a preliminary injunction.  One reason is that the \nmotion involves at least some disputed facts that potentially require an evidentiary \nhearing before they may be determined.  See Dexia Credit Local v. Rogan, 602 F.3d \n879, 884 (7th Cir. 2010); Promatek Indus., Ltd. v. Equitrac Corp., 300 F.3d 808, 814 \n(7th Cir. 2002), as amended (Oct. 18, 2002); Syntex Ophthalmics, Inc. v. Tsuetaki, 701 \nF.2d 677, 682 (7th Cir. 1983).  The motion for preliminary injunction is therefore left for \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 10 of 37 PageID #:1076\nlater consideration. \n  The standard for issuing a temporary restraining order is identical to that \ngoverning the issuance of a preliminary injunction.  Trs. of Chi. Reg'l Council of \nCarpenters Welfare Fund v. Norem, No. 17 C 4851, 2017 WL 4620798, at *2 (N.D. Ill. \nOct. 16, 2017) (citing Long v. Bd. of Educ., Dist. 128, 167 F. Supp. 2d 988, 990 (N.D. Ill. \n2001)).  A court's determination of whether to issue a preliminary injunction or \ntemporary restraining order involves a two-step inquiry, with a threshold phase and a \nbalancing phase.  Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d \n1034, 1044 (7th Cir. 2017).  At the threshold phase, the moving party must show: (1) \nwithout the requested relief, he will suffer irreparable harm during the pendency of his \naction; (2) traditional legal remedies would be inadequate; and (3) he has some \nlikelihood of success on the merits.  Id.  If the movant satisfies these requirements, the \ncourt proceeds to the balancing analysis \"to determine whether the balance of harms \nfavors the moving party or whether the harm to other parties or the public sufficiently \noutweighs the movant’s interests.\"  Id. \n  The Court also notes that the plaintiffs are arguably seeking what is sometimes \nreferred to as a \"mandatory injunction,\" that is, a restraining order that requires an \naffirmative act by the defendant.  Mandatory injunctions are \"ordinarily cautiously \nviewed and sparingly issued.\"  Graham v. Med. Mut. of Ohio, 130 F.3d 293, 295 (7th \nCir. 1997). \n  1.  Likelihood of success on the merits \nThe moving party \"need not demonstrate a likelihood of absolute success on the \nmerits.\"  Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1046.  A \"better than negligible\" chance of success is \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 11 of 37 PageID #:1077\nsufficient.  Id. (quoting Cooper v. Salazar, 196 F.3d 809, 813 (7th Cir. 1999)). \n    a.  Habeas corpus \n  Plaintiffs and subclass A have petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 \nU.S.C. § 2241, which is the appropriate way for a state pre-trial detainee to challenge \nhis or her detention.  Jackson v. Clements, 796 F.3d 841, 843 (7th Cir. 2015).  \n\"Because a pre-trial detainee is not yet in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State \ncourt, relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 is not available.\"  Id. (internal quotation marks \nomitted). \n  Section 2241 has no express exhaustion requirement, but courts apply a \ncommon-law exhaustion rule.  Richmond v. Scibana, 387 F.3d 602, 604 (7th Cir. 2004).  \nA pretrial detainee must \"exhaust all avenues of state relief\" before seeking a writ of \nhabeas corpus through a section 2241 action.  See United States v. Castor, 937 F.2d \n293, 296–97 (7th Cir. 1991).  Although there are exceptions, \"the hurdle is high.\"  \nRichmond, 387 F.3d at 604.  In deciding whether an exception applies, courts \"must \nbalance the individual and institutional interests involved, taking into account 'the nature \nof the claim presented and the characteristics of the particular administrative procedure \nprovided.'\"  Gonzalez v. O'Connell, 355 F.3d 1010, 1016 (7th Cir. 2004) (quoting \nMcCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 146 (1992), superseded by statute on other \ngrounds as recognized in Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516 (2002)).  A court may excuse \nexhaustion where: \n(1) requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies causes prejudice, due \nto unreasonable delay or an indefinite timeframe for administrative action; \n(2) the agency lacks the ability or competence to resolve the issue or grant \nthe relief requested; (3) appealing through the administrative process \nwould be futile because the agency is biased or has predetermined the \nissue; or (4) where substantial constitutional questions are raised.   \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 12 of 37 PageID #:1078\n \nId.; see also Chazen v. Marske, 938 F.3d 851, 863 (7th Cir. 2019) (applying futility \nexception).   \n  It is undisputed that a state court has the authority to release a pretrial detainee.  \nA detainee in Illinois may challenge his or her detention by seeking judicial review of his \nor her bond.  725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/110-6.3  And on March 23, 2020, in response to \nan emergency petition filed by the Cook County Public Defender, the Presiding Judge of \nthe Cook County Circuit Court's Criminal Division issued an order setting out an \nexpedited bond hearing process that applied to seven designated classes of detainees.  \nDefs.' Resp., Ex. E (dkt. no. 31-1) at 1-2.  The classes included those at an elevated risk \nof contracting coronavirus due to their ages or underlying medical conditions—that is, \nthe putative members of Subclass A.  Id.  The expedited hearings took place from \nMarch 24 through March 27.  Id. at 3–5.  Although the expedited hearings do not appear \nto be currently ongoing, Cook County's courts are still available for emergency matters, \nand judges are hearing motions to review or reduce bail daily at all locations where \ncourt is held.  Defs.' Supp. Resp., Ex. A (dkt. no. 41-1) at 1. \n  The plaintiffs do not contend that they sought expedited bond hearings or \ninitiated any sort of state proceedings challenging their bonds.4  Instead, they contend \n                                            \n3 At the hearing held on April 7, 2020, though not in their supplemental brief filed after \nthe hearing, the plaintiffs advanced another futility argument, specifically that the risk to \ntheir health could not be asserted as a basis to allow release on bond.  The argument is \nunsupported, and it is undercut by the numerous bond reductions and releases that \nhave taken place in recent weeks, largely as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. \n \n4 At the hearing, but not in any of their briefs, the plaintiffs suggested that the Public \nDefender's motion could serve to exhaust their claims.  But they were not named parties \nto that motion and, regardless, the state court's ruling on that motion would undermine \ntheir argument because it made possible an additional avenue of relief. \n \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 13 of 37 PageID #:1079\nthat exhaustion is futile because the bond review process does not move quickly \nenough.  The defendants, in turn, contend that the plaintiffs should have sought \nreductions of their bonds through the expedited and/or emergency hearings that were \navailable, may now seek release via other established processes, and that these \nprocesses are not futile. \n   The plaintiffs in subclass A cannot show that they exhausted available state \ncourt remedies before petitioning for habeas corpus.  As indicated, the plaintiffs have \nnot sought bond reductions at all.  And the record reflects that this process is anything \nbut futile.  During the week the expedited bond hearings were held, the Jail's population \ndecreased by 424 detainees.  Defs.' Resp., Ex. B (dkt. no. 30-2) ¶ 27.  Since March 9, \nthe Jail's population has decreased by 1,175 detainees—bringing it to a record low, at \nleast for the past few decades—and even since the completion of the expedited bond \nhearing process, the Jail's population has decreased by over 265 detainees.  E.g., id. ¶¶ \n10, 28–29.   \n  Nor have the plaintiffs established that the existing and available process for \nreview of their detention is unduly time-consuming in a way that undermines their \nclaimed constitutional rights.  They say the process, in its entirety, could take several \nweeks or months.  But this assumes a given detainee will lose at every stage and will \nhave to appeal all the way to the state supreme court.  In the Court's view, it is rather \nincongruous to call an otherwise available process unnecessarily time-consuming or \nfutile when one has made no effort to initiate it.  More to the point, the plaintiffs point to \nno evidence that detainees who have sought bond hearings are currently facing undue \ndelays.  Thus although a court may excuse exhaustion in unusual circumstances if it \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 14 of 37 PageID #:1080\nwould cause an unreasonable delay, see, e.g., Gonzalez, 355 F.3d at 1016, the \nplaintiffs have not made the necessary showing.  And to the extent they contend that \nthe requirement of exhaustion should be excused due to the nature of the constitutional \nquestions they raise, they have made no showing that the state courts cannot remedy \nthese claimed violations. \n  In sum, the habeas corpus claim on the part of the representatives of subclass A \nis barred due to their failure to exhaust available state court remedies.  As a result, the \nsubclass has no likelihood of success on the merits.5  This renders moot the plaintiffs' \nrequest for the Court to establish a procedure for the expedited consideration of release \nof the members of subclass A, which the plaintiffs sought only with respect to the \nhabeas corpus claim. \n  Though this determination renders the parties' other arguments regarding habeas \ncorpus superfluous, the Court will address certain of them to ensure a more complete \nrecord and to eliminate issues from the need for future consideration.  First, the parties \ndispute whether detainees can even challenge the conditions of their confinement \nthrough section 2241—an issue that has also divided courts.  Compare, e.g., Aamer v. \nObama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1032 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (a prisoner may challenge the conditions \nof his confinement in a federal habeas corpus petition) and Thompson v. Choinski, 525 \nF.3d 205, 209 (2d Cir. 2008) (same) with Spencer v. Haynes, 774 F.3d 467, 469–70  \n(8th Cir. 2014) (section 2241 petitions may not challenge conditions).  The Seventh \n                                            \n5 If the plaintiffs wish to seek prompt appellate review of this ruling, the Court is willing to \nconsider dismissing Count 2 of their complaint for failure to exhaust and certifying the \nruling for immediate appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).  Any such request should be \npresented to the undersigned judge in his capacity as emergency judge. \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 15 of 37 PageID #:1081\nCircuit has expressed a \"long-standing view that habeas corpus is not a permissible \nroute for challenging prison conditions,\" at least when a prisoner's claim does not have \n\"even an indirect effect on the duration of punishment.\"  Robinson v. Sherrod, 631 F.3d \n839, 840–41 (7th Cir. 2011).  But the Seventh Circuit has also noted that \"the Supreme \nCourt [has] left the door open a crack for prisoners to use habeas corpus to challenge a \ncondition of confinement.\"  Id. at 840 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Glaus v. \nAnderson, 408 F.3d 382, 387 (7th Cir.2005); Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 644–46 \n(2004); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 526 n.6 (1979); Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. \n475, 499–500 (1973)).  Were the Court required to address this point, it would not \nconsider it to be an absolute bar to plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order.  \nThe plaintiffs' claims, as they have framed them, do bear on the duration of their \nconfinement (they contend, ultimately, that they cannot be held in the Jail consistent \nwith the Constitution's requirements), and they are not the sort of claims that are, or can \nbe, appropriately addressed via a claim for damages.  The Court need not, however, \ndecide this point definitively at this point. \n  Next, the Sheriff argues that he has no authority to release detainees because, \nhe contends, only the criminal trial court has authority to release a person in custody.  \nCiting the Illinois County Jail Act, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 125/14, the Sheriff contends \nthat he can transfer pretrial detainees—which, his counsel conceded at the hearing \n(contrary to statements in the Sheriff's brief), could include placing them in home \ncustody—but that he lacks authority to release them outright.  This argument has no \nbearing on the petition for habeas corpus.  The issuance of writ of habeas corpus \nthrough a section 2241 petition is a federal remedy (in other words, it does not depend \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 16 of 37 PageID #:1082\non state law), and a habeas corpus petition is always addressed to the prisoner's \ncustodian, in this case the Sheriff.  Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. 426, 447 (2004) \n(\"Whenever a § 2241 habeas petitioner seeks to challenge his present physical custody \nwithin the United States, he should name his warden as respondent.\").  Whether the \nSheriff has authority under state law to release detainees on his own does not matter. \n  Finally, the Sheriff also suggests that the subclass A plaintiffs' habeas corpus \npetition is barred by Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), which \"requires federal \ncourts to abstain from interfering with pending state proceedings to enforce a state's \ncriminal laws and certain other types of law as well.\"  Sweeney v. Bartow, 612 F.3d 571, \n573 (7th Cir. 2010).  Although the Seventh Circuit has held that Younger abstention may \napply to a habeas corpus petition, id., there is no basis to abstain here, as there is no \npending state proceeding.  The Sheriff's real argument is non-exhaustion, not Younger \nabstention. \n    b.  Section 1983 claim \nThe Fourteenth Amendment protects pretrial detainees, who are entitled to a \nconstitutional presumption of innocence, from being held in conditions that amount to \npunishment.  Miranda v. County of Lake, 900 F.3d 335, 350-51 (7th Cir. 2018).  \nAnalysis of a due process challenge to conditions of confinement involves two \nsteps.  See Miranda, 900 F.3d at 353.  The first is a determination of whether the \ndefendant's conduct was purposeful, knowing, or \"perhaps even reckless[],\" id., with \nrespect to the \"physical consequences in the world\" of his conduct.  Kingsley v. \nHendrickson, 576 U.S. 389, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2472 (2015).  The conditions created by \nthe defendant's conduct must be, \"from an objective standpoint, sufficiently serious.\"  \n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 17 of 37 PageID #:1083\nSee Gray v. Hardy, 826 F.3d 1000, 1005 (7th Cir. 2016).6  The second step is an \nassessment of the reasonableness of the defendant's conduct, in light of the \"totality of \nfacts and circumstances\" facing the defendant.  McCann v. Ogle County, 909 F.3d 881, \n886 (7th Cir. 2018).  The reasonableness of the defendant's conduct is measured \nobjectively \"without regard to any subjective belief held by the [defendant].\"  Id.   \ni.  Knowing conduct and seriousness of conditions  \n \nThe Sheriff does not dispute that his establishment of certain policies and his \nnon-establishment of others that are sought amounts to knowing conduct; at the \nhearing.  For a condition created by a defendant's conduct to be \"sufficiently serious\" to \nviolate a detainee's Fourteenth Amendment rights, the defendant's knowing acts or \nomissions must result \"in the denial of the minimal civilized measure of life's \nnecessities.\"  See Gray, 826 F.3d at 1005 (quoting Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, \n834 (1994)).  Actual, present harm is not required; conditions that pose an \n\"unreasonable risk of serious damage to the [detainee's] future health\" may violate a \ndetainee's Fourteenth Amendment rights.  See Henderson v. Sheahan, 196 F.3d 839, \n847 (7th Cir. 1999).  To determine if conditions of confinement pose an \"unreasonable \nrisk\" to pretrial detainees' future health, a court must make a \"scientific and statistical \ninquiry into the seriousness of the potential harm and the likelihood that such injury to \n                                            \n6  The claim in Gray was brought by a convicted prisoner, not a pretrial detainee, and \ntherefore his claim was governed by the Eighth Amendment, not the Fourteenth \nAmendment.  The analyses of conditions-of-confinement claims under Fourteenth \nAmendment and Eighth Amendment overlap in the assessment of whether the \nconditions were sufficiently severe, but they diverge in the assessment of the propriety \nof the defendant's conduct: the standard is subjective for Eighth Amendment claims \n(which require a showing of deliberate indifference) and objective for Fourteenth \nAmendment claims (which require a showing of unreasonableness).  See Hardeman v. \nCurran, 933 F.3d 816, 822 (7th Cir. 2019). \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 18 of 37 PageID #:1084\nhealth will actually be caused\" by the conditions.  Id.  A court must also consider \nwhether the risk of harm was \"not one that today's society chooses to tolerate.\"  Id. \nThe plaintiffs are reasonably likely to succeed in showing that at least some of \nthe conditions they cite pose an unreasonable risk to their future health.  See id.  The \nscientific evidence in the record— including the Center for Disease Control's Interim \nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional \nand Detention Facilities (\"CDC Guidelines\") and a declaration from medical doctors \nsubmitted by the plaintiffs—reflects that coronavirus is highly contagious, persists in the \nenvironment, and may be hard to detect by observation of symptoms only.  The virus \napparently spreads easily, through coughing or sneezing; droplets with the virus can \nremain in the air for up to three hours.  Additionally, and importantly for purposes of the \npresent case, coronavirus apparently persists on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for \nup to two to three days.  Those who have been infected with the virus may not become \nsymptomatic for up to fourteen days.  In light of these qualities and the present lack of a \nvaccine or cure for the virus, frequent handwashing, social distancing, sanitation of \nsurfaces, and the use of PPE are the only available methods to protect against \ncoronavirus infection. \nIn the context of this evidence, the plaintiffs have demonstrated that certain of the \nconditions created by the intentional actions of the Sheriff enable the spread of \ncoronavirus and significantly heighten detainees' risk of contracting the virus.  First, the \naffidavits from current and recently released detainees reflect that Sheriff's personnel \nhave not been cleaning common spaces after a detainee on the tier has tested positive \n18 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 19 of 37 PageID #:1085\nfor coronavirus.7  The affidavits submitted by the plaintiffs also reflect that detainees are \nbeing housed under conditions that make social distancing impossible, thereby \nfacilitating the spread of coronavirus.  Many detainees are in congregate living \nsituations, in which anywhere from forty to over a hundred detainees are housed in a \nsingle room.  The beds in these open living spaces are very close together, separated \nby only one to four feet.  And detainees who are housed in single- or dual-occupancy \ncells still must use common bathroom facilities, which are typically shared by forty to \nfifty people, including large groups at a single time.   \nThe affidavits submitted by the plaintiffs further suggest that detainees currently \nlack the means to attempt to protect themselves from a potential coronavirus infection.  \nAlthough they are sharing tier with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, \nthe plaintiffs contend, the Sheriff has not provided them with adequate supplies of soap, \nwith cleaning supplies, or with PPE such as facemasks.  The record reflects that only \nsymptomatic detainees have been issued facemasks and that detainees otherwise have \nnot received any PPE.  The plaintiffs' affidavits reflect that requests for facemasks have \nbeen refused by Jail personnel and that when detainees have resorted to making their \nown masks from cloth, those masks have been confiscated.  \nThe plaintiffs also contend that the Jail is not screening its population to identify, \nand separate, detainees who have heightened vulnerability to coronavirus disease due \n                                            \n7  Although the Sheriff objects that many of the plaintiffs' affidavits contain hearsay, it is \nwell established that a Court may consider hearsay in ruling on a preliminary injunction \nmotion (and thus on a motion for a temporary restraining order).  See SEC v. Cherif, \n933 F.2d 403, 412 n.8 (7th Cir. 1991). \n \n \n \n19 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 20 of 37 PageID #:1086\nto age or preexisting medical conditions.  As a result, the plaintiffs contend, those \ndetainees are housed, and will in the future be housed, in tiers where a detainee has \ntested positive.  The plaintiffs argue that this places these vulnerable detainees at a \nhigh risk of severe health consequences. \n  The statistical evidence that exists also indicates that the conditions at the Jail \nhave created a significant and unreasonable risk to the plaintiffs' future health.  The Jail \ncurrently has the highest rate of new coronavirus infections in the country, and it far \nexceeds that of Cook County.  As of April 6, 2020, the infection rate in Cook County was \n1.56 per 1000 people, whereas in the Jail, it was 50 per 1,000 people.  The disparity \nbetween these rates tends to support the contention that the conditions at the Jail \nfacilitate the spread of coronavirus and exacerbate the risk of infection for detainees. \nThe plaintiffs have shown a reasonable likelihood of success on their contention \nthat at least some current conditions at the Jail relating to the Sheriff's response to the \ncoronavirus outbreak collectively create a risk of harm from coronavirus that is \"not one \nthat today's society chooses to tolerate.\"  See Sheahan, 196 F.3d at 847.  In recognition \nof the importance of social distancing, Illinois' governor has instituted a statewide stay-\nat-home order.  Frequent handwashing, use of PPE such as facemasks, and sanitizing \nof commonly used surfaces have, in the past several weeks, become routine \nprecautions employed by the general population.  Under the circumstances, plaintiffs \nare reasonably likely to succeed on their contention that conditions at the Jail create an \nunreasonable risk to their health that is sufficiently serious to bring their due process \nrights into play, thus requiring assessment of the reasonableness of the Sheriff's \nactions.  \n20 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 21 of 37 PageID #:1087\n    ii.  Objective reasonableness \nObjective reasonableness is assessed from the perspective of \"a reasonable \n[official] on the scene,\" based on what the officer knew at the time, Kingsley, 135 S. Ct. \nat 2473; from that perspective a court determines if the official acted reasonably to \nmitigate the risks to health and safety of the detainees.  See Hardeman, 933 F.3d at \n825; see also Darnell v. Pineiro, 849 F.3d 17, 35 (2d Cir. 2017).  In assessing the \nreasonableness of the Sheriff's conduct, the Court must account for his legitimate \ninterest in managing the Jail facilities and must defer to policies and practices that \"are \nneeded to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional \nsecurity.\"  Kingsley, 135 S. Ct. at 2473 (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at). \nThe Sheriff argues that his conduct has been objectively reasonable because he \nhas promulgated policies and procedures intended to implement the CDC Guidelines, \nwhich both parties have expressly relied upon as a guide to assessing the \nreasonableness of the Sheriff's conduct.  The establishment of a policy that is consistent \nwith authoritative guidance and best practices may, in fact, comply with constitutional \nrequirements.  But establishing appropriate policies does not fully discharge the \nSheriff’s constitutional obligations; a policy is only as good as its execution.  In this \ncase, the plaintiffs challenge certain of the Sheriff’s policies as inadequate and thus \nunreasonable, but they also challenge the implementation of other policies that may be \nfacially adequate.  For example, the plaintiffs offer an affidavit from a correctional officer \nwho states that, despite the Sheriff’s declared policy, facemasks are being rationed and \nare not readily available for Jail staff.  And they likewise offer affidavits from recent \ndetainees and from persons who have spoken with current detainees that are indicative \n21 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 22 of 37 PageID #:1088\nof objectively unreasonable deficiencies in the implementation of certain of the Sheriff’s \ndeclared policies.   \n  With these considerations in mind, the Court assesses the plaintiffs’ likelihood of \nsuccess on its challenges to the Sheriff's actions in response to the health risks to \ndetainees posed by coronavirus. \n      a.  Medical triage of vulnerable detainees \n  The plaintiffs contend that the Sheriff has not established a process to identify \ndetainees who are in high risk categories for complications from coronavirus or \nmeasures to separate vulnerable detainees from others who are confirmed or \nsuspected of having the virus.  The Sheriff contends he has worked to establish policies \nthat are consistent with the CDC's guidelines and that identify potentially vulnerable \ndetainees.  He points to evidence that Sheriff’s personnel are working to help the state \ncourts expedite case and bond review hearings by identifying detainees who are \nconsidered at a high risk of having complications from the virus based on age or \nmedical conditions.  But apart from using medical alerts in the Sheriff’s office’s computer \nsystem, the submissions made to the Court offer no description of an actual process for \nidentifying vulnerable detainees.  \n  Given the widely acknowledged risks to medically vulnerable individuals, it \nundoubtedly would be advisable for the Sheriff to identify, in advance of any \nsymptomatology, detainees who are in high-risk categories.  The CDC’s guidance says \nthat correctional facilities should ensure that detainees are medically evaluated and \ntreated \"at the first signs of COVID-19 symptoms,\" including a determination regarding \nwhether an individual is in a high-risk category.  Defs.' Resp., Ex. O (dkt. no. 30-15), at \n22 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 23 of 37 PageID #:1089\n23.  Knowing in advance who the high-risk detainees are, and maintaining an \naccessible record of this, would facilitate more careful monitoring and treatment of the \nmedical condition of any such person who develops symptoms consistent with \ncoronavirus disease.  But the CDC’s guidance does not require correctional facilities to \nidentify medically vulnerable detainees before they show symptoms or to segregate \nthem from other detainees in advance.  For purposes of the present motion, the Court \ncannot say that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their contention that the Sheriff’s \nclaimed failure to identify these detainees in advance is objectively unreasonable.   \n      b.  Social distancing \n  The plaintiffs contend that the Sheriff's policies run afoul of social-distancing \nguidance; the Sheriff has not mandated this within the Jail; and current housing \narrangements make social distancing impossible or virtually so, at least in many of the \nJail’s divisions.  In several areas, detainees are housed in congregate setting somewhat \neuphemistically called \"dormitory\"-type rooms—really, more like a military barracks, with \ndozens of inmates in close-quarters bunkbeds in a single large room.  In others, \ndetainees are doubled-celled in very small rooms.  And in most areas of the Jail, large \ngroups of detainees share showers, bathrooms, and dayrooms, as is common in most \npretrial detention facilities.  The plaintiffs contend that this runs afoul of CDC guidance \nand unreasonably endangers detainees’ health.  The Sheriff contends that he is \nundertaking what he contends are reasonably feasible efforts to socially distance \ndetainees and to educate them on the need for social distancing and how to practice it.  \nThe Sheriff also contends that he is working to reduce the occupancy of the Jails' \ndormitory-style housing by as much as fifty percent.  He also points to a policy that \n23 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 24 of 37 PageID #:1090\nrequires the isolation of new detainees from the Jail’s general population for fourteen \ndays as of April 6, 2020 (up from seven days in an earlier iteration of the policy).   \n  At the April 7 hearing, however, defense counsel was unable to confirm whether \nsuch efforts make it possible to separate detainees' beds by six feet or, indeed, how \nmuch separation exists in the dormitory-type buildings.  The only evidence in the record \nsuggests that detainees likely are still packed rather closely in those facilities.  In \naddition, the record appears to reflect that the Sheriff continues to maintain the historical \npractice of holding all new detainees awaiting intake for extended periods in enclosed, \ncrowded cells commonly called bullpens.  This occurs even before new detainees—all \nof whom have come from the community at large—are medically evaluated.  This, it \nwould appear, is a volitional, knowing policy choice by the Sheriff. \n  Plaintiffs have shown a reasonable likelihood of success on their contention that \nthe intake procedure is objectively unreasonable and creates an undue risk of harm to \nnew detainees who are thereby exposed to others who have not been medically \nevaluated and may have coronavirus disease symptoms.  The CDC’s guidance \nrecommends that correctional facilities \"[e]nforce increased space between individuals \nin holding cells, as well as in lines and waiting areas such as intake.\"  Defs.' Resp., Ex. \nO (dkt. no. 30-15), at 11.  There is no evidence that the Sheriff is enforcing those \nmeasures, particularly with respect to the intake process; indeed, what evidence exists \nis to the contrary.  \nIt is less clear, however, that the Sheriff’s existing housing arrangements for \nadmitted detainees may be considered objectively unreasonable.  In this regard, the \nCDC’s guidance is not as definitive as plaintiffs suggest; it acknowledges that space \n24 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 25 of 37 PageID #:1091\nlimitations may require a departure from better social-distancing practices.  Though the \nexisting situation likely increases the risk to detainees, the CDC's guidance expressly \nrecognizes that complete social distancing may not be possible in the sleeping areas of \na jail.  Space constraints at the Jail do not allow for the more preferable degree of social \ndistancing that exists in the community at large.  The Court concludes that plaintiffs \nhave filed to show a reasonable likelihood of success on their contention that the Sheriff \nis acting in an objectively unreasonable manner by failing to mandate full social \ndistancing.  This is particularly so because the Sheriff's submission reflects an ongoing \neffort to modify custodial arrangements at the Jail in a way that will permit greater \nseparation of detainees. \n      c.  Sanitation \n  The plaintiffs contend that, although sanitation and handwashing are considered \nto be among the best defenses against the spread of coronavirus, the Sheriff's policies \nfail to provide for sufficient distribution of soap, sanitizing agents, and cleaning products \nto detainees.  In particular, the plaintiffs note, the Sheriff's coronavirus response plan \ndoes not provide for the distribution of sanitation supplies to detainees at all.  Affidavits \nsubmitted by and on behalf of both current and former detainees reflect that detainees \nare not being given sanitation supplies to clean cells or shared showers that have not \notherwise been sanitized, and that they either have not received soap or received only a \nvery small supply insufficient to permit the frequent hand-washing recommended by \npublic health experts.  In addition, a correctional officer who has submitted an affidavit in \n25 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 26 of 37 PageID #:1092\nsupport of plaintiffs’ motion8 states that access to soap and sanitation supplies also \npose a problem for Jail staff who have some responsibility for cleaning areas under their \nobservation and control.  For his part, the Sheriff contends he is working to distribute \nsupplies more frequently, to implement more frequent and thorough sanitary measures, \nand follow the CDC's guidelines. \n  The CDC's guidance advises correctional facilities to ensure that sufficient \namounts of sanitation and cleaning supplies are available and that detainees have free \nsoap \"sufficient to allow frequent hand-washing.\"  Defs.' Resp., Ex. O (dkt. no. 30-15), at \n8.  The CDC also advises that frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned and \ndisinfected several times a day.  The Sheriff, however, has offered nothing to indicate \nthat his policies ensure the provision of sufficient soap to detainees (let alone that it is \nbeing provided free of charge, assuming that is a relevant consideration for present \npurposes).  By contrast, there is plenty of evidence to the contrary.  The Sheriff also \npoints to policies that call for sanitation and cleaning supplies to be made available to \ndetainees, but he offers no evidence that this is actually happening on the ground, and \nas indicated the plaintiffs have offered significant evidence reflecting that it is not \nhappening.  This means that it is highly likely, as the plaintiffs contend, that numerous \nareas subject to common access in the Jail, including dayrooms, other common areas \nlike showers and bathrooms, two-person cells, and the dormitory-type rooms, are going \nuncleaned for extended periods, thus increasing the risk of transmission of coronavirus \n                                            \n8 At the hearing, defense counsel attempted to cast doubt upon the credibility of the \ncorrectional officer, saying that he had been involved in other disputes or lawsuits with \nthe Sheriff.  The Court does not and need not make a credibility determination at this \nstage, other than to note that the officer’s statements are consistent with those made by \ndetainees in other affidavits submitted by the plaintiffs. \n26 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 27 of 37 PageID #:1093\nby detainees not yet isolated as symptomatic who have been in or touched objects in \nthose areas.  The Court cannot at this point quantify the risk, but the significant number \nof confirmed coronavirus infections among detainees certainly suggests the risk is \nsignificant.  For these reasons, the Court concludes that plaintiffs have shown a \nreasonable likelihood of success on their claim that the execution of the Sheriff's \npolicies regarding sanitation and sanitation supplies is objectively unreasonable.  \n      d.  PPE    \nThe plaintiffs next contend that the Sheriff's policies do not require providing PPE \nto every detainee and that this is objectively unreasonable under the circumstances.  \nThe first of these propositions appears to be undisputed:  detainees as a whole are not \nbeing issued facemasks or other forms of PPE.  Current and former detainees have \nstated via affidavits that they did not receive any PPE, that only detainees with \nsymptoms received PPE, that detainees' requests for PPE have been denied by \nSheriff’s personnel, and that when detainees tried to make their own face coverings, \nofficers have confiscated them.  The Sheriff has offered no contrary evidence on these \npoints.  The plaintiffs also suggest that some, but not all, correctional officers wear or \nhave been wearing PPE in the Jail—at least, not until recently (though even this \nappears to be disputed via the affidavit from the correctional officer submitted by the \nplaintiffs on the morning of April 7).  The Sheriff contends that he has been proactively \nworking to obtain PPE and conform with best practices regarding its use, including, as \nof recently, requiring all employees to wear PPE in the Jail.  The Sheriff also offers \nevidence that he has created a team of officers who patrol tiers checking that \ncorrectional staff are appropriately are using PPE.   \n27 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 28 of 37 PageID #:1094\n  The CDC's guidelines for detainees' use of PPE recognize some flexibility; they \nrequire symptomatic detainees to wear masks but do not mandate this for those \ndetainees' close contacts.  But the CDC's guidance also indicates that asymptomatic \ndetainees should get \"face masks for source control as feasible based on local supply, \nespecially if housed as a cohort.\"  Defs.' Resp., Ex. O (dkt. no. 30-15), at 25 (emphasis \nadded).  Based on the record before the Court, the Sheriff's office gives PPE only to \nsymptomatic detainees—a significant but still relatively modest proportion of the total \ndetainee population at this point—even though the Sheriff currently has enough \nsupplies to provide PPE to employees for at least a month.  Because current guidance \nindicates that even cloth masks can reduce the spread of coronavirus, and the virus is \nspreading rapidly throughout the Jail, the plaintiffs have a reasonable likelihood of \nsuccess on their contention that it is objectively unreasonable for the Sheriff to fail to \nprovide facemasks at least to those detainees who are in quarantine—i.e., those who \nhave been exposed to a detainee who is symptomatic (even if not coronavirus-positive).  \nThis failure creates an increased risk of further spread of coronavirus to other \ndetainees, not to mention Jail staff and, by extension, members of the general public \nwith whom those staff members have contact.  The plaintiffs likewise have shown a \nreasonable likelihood of success on their contention that the Sheriff is not enforcing the \nuse of PPE by Jail staff who come into contact with detainees, which poses a similar \nrisk to detainees given those staff members’ exposure to others outside the Jail. \n      e.  Quarantine and isolation \n  The plaintiffs also criticize the Sheriff's policies on quarantining detainees who \nhave been exposed to other detainees who have exhibited symptoms consistent with \n28 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 29 of 37 PageID #:1095\ncoronavirus disease.  The policy, as discussed earlier, calls for quarantining the entire \ntier where any such detainee was housed for a fourteen-day period, extended if \nsomeone else in the tier thereafter exhibits symptoms.  But plaintiffs’ criticism is not that \nthe policy is inappropriate.  Rather their contention appears to be that in the near to \nmedium term the Sheriff's practice will make it impossible for him to manage the crisis \ngiven the number of tiers that likely will be under quarantine.  Plaintiffs’ position, it \nseems to the Court, amounts to a contention that the practice of quarantining is likely to \nfail, so the Court will ultimately have to order detainee releases now to relieve the \npressure.  That, however, is not the issue currently before the Court, and in any event \nthe plaintiffs have not made the showing that this is an appropriate remedy at this \npoint.9 \nThe Sheriff contends that he is following the CDC's guidance and has \nimplemented it.  As indicated, he has quarantined for at least fourteen days any \ndetainee who has been in contact with a symptomatic detainee, and if a tier is \nquarantined, no new detainees are admitted to it or transferred from it.  In addition, \nsymptomatic detainees are moved to isolation tiers, and coronavirus-positive detainees \nare moved to different isolation tiers, for at least fourteen days.  The plaintiffs offer no \nevidence reflecting that this is not what the Sheriff is doing. \n  The CDC’s guidance does not require correctional facilities to individually isolate \ndetainees who have tested positive for coronavirus or have been in close contact with \n                                            \n9 For this reason, and because the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3)(A) have not \nbeen met, the Court need not address the applicability of section 3626 to the plaintiffs' \nrequest for relief.  The same is true with regard to subclass B's request to be transferred \nto alternate custodial locations.  At least at present, the plaintiffs are not seeking release \nfrom custody. \n29 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 30 of 37 PageID #:1096\nsomeone who has.  Rather, the CDC recognizes that some facilities may not have \nenough individual cells for individual isolation and may need to quarantine together \ngroups of detainees exposed to others who have tested positive.  The CDC's guidance \nfurther states that if a correctional facility has a need to isolate or quarantine detainees \nin groups, detainees with confirmed coronavirus cases should not be placed into \nisolation with symptomatic detainees or other detainees.  The Sheriff's policies follow \nthis recommendation, and the plaintiffs point to no evidence that he is not implementing \nthose policies.  The Court concludes that plaintiffs have not shown a reasonable \nlikelihood of success on their contention that the Sheriff’s quarantining policies and \npractices are objectively reasonable.   \n      f.  Coronavirus testing \n  The plaintiffs contend—and it is reasonable to believe—that there are likely more \ninfections in the Jail than currently reported because of the limited availability of \ncoronavirus tests.  They ask the Court to order the immediate implementation of rapid \ntesting.  The Sheriff contends that Cermak Health Services has obtained approval to \nstart administering a rapid testing process developed by Abbott Laboratories as of April \n7.  But when the Court asked at the hearing—on April 7—about the status of that \ntesting, the Sheriff's counsel did not know whether or how it was being implemented.  \nRather, counsel said that this was up to Cermak, which is controlled by Cook County, \nnot the Sheriff.   \nThe CDC’s guidance does not offer a specific recommendation on how widely \ntesting should be done.  It does imply, however, that people who are symptomatic \nshould be tested if feasible.  In light of the evidence that the Sheriff now has access to \n30 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 31 of 37 PageID #:1097\nrapid coronavirus testing, it is not objectively reasonable for the Sheriff himself—not just \nCermak Health Services—to fail to have a policy in place regarding implementation of \nprompt testing, in particular for detainees who exhibit symptoms consistent with \ncoronavirus disease.  See, e.g., Calhoun v. Ramsey, 408 F.3d 375, 380 (7th Cir. 2005) \n(failure to have a policy may, in certain circumstances, constitute an unconstitutional \npolicy).   \n  2.  Irreparable harm and inadequate remedy at law   \n  To meet the threshold requirement for a temporary restraining order, the plaintiffs \nmust also demonstrate that without it, they will suffer irreparable harm for which they \nlack an adequate remedy at law.  Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1044, 1046.  This requires a \nshowing of more than a \"mere possibility\" of harm, but harm need not be a certainty in \norder for a court may grant relief.  Id. at 1044.   \nThe plaintiffs have adequately shown a likelihood that they will suffer irreparable \nharm without a temporary restraining order.  Some of the plaintiffs—at least those over \nthe age of 65 or with preexisting health conditions—risk severe health consequences, \nincluding death, if they contract coronavirus disease.  For others, a coronavirus infection \nmay result in permanent lung damage.  These grave risks to health are not an \ninsignificant possibility for the plaintiffs, all of whom are housed in units or tiers in which \na person has tested positive for coronavirus, all or nearly all of whom are housed in \nclose proximity with others, and many and likely most of whom have not been given \nsufficient soap or sanitation supplies, let alone PPE.  \"[A] remedy for unsafe conditions \nneed not await a tragic event.\"  Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993).  And \nbecause the risk of harm to plaintiffs is a grave threat to their health and possibly their \n31 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 32 of 37 PageID #:1098\nlives, they have shown a risk of harm for which \"it is not practicable to calculate \ndamages\" and therefore has no adequate remedy at law.   See Foodcomm Int'l v. Barry, \n328 F.3d 300, 304 (7th Cir. 2003); cf. W.S.R. v. Sessions, 318 F. Supp. 3d 1116, 1126 \n(N.D. Ill. 2018) (no adequate remedy of law to address harm from prolonging child's \nseparation from parent). \n3.  Balancing of harms \n  \"Once a moving party has met its burden of establishing the threshold \nrequirements for a preliminary injunction, the court must balance the harms faced by \nboth parties and the public as a whole.\"  Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1054.  The nature of the \nbalancing depends on the moving party's likelihood of success: the higher the likelihood, \nthe more the balance tips in favor of granting injunctive relief.  Id.   \n  The Sheriff argues that this balance tips against entry of a temporary restraining \norder because an injunction requiring him to implement additional health and protective \nmeasures would be disruptive to his ongoing efforts to address the spread of \ncoronavirus in the Jail.  The Sheriff also argues that the Court should defer to the Jail's \npractices and its execution of policies that preserve internal order, discipline, and \nsecurity in the facility.  See Bell, 441 U.S. at 547.  The plaintiffs contend that their risk of \nsevere health consequences or death as a result of coronavirus infection is so grave \nthat it tips the balance in favor of granting a temporary restraining order.  Additionally, \nthe plaintiffs argue that the public health interest in limiting the spread of the virus also \nfavors granting relief. \n  The Court concludes that the balance favors granting injunctive relief to the \nplaintiffs to the limited extent contemplated by this order.  First, as detailed above, the \n32 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 33 of 37 PageID #:1099\nplaintiffs have presented ample evidence of conditions that pose an unreasonable risk \nof serious harm to the class members' health and at least some shortcomings in the \nSheriff's mitigation of that risk.  As the Court has detailed, this showing, on the points \nidentified earlier, surpasses the plaintiffs' burden of showing a \"better than negligible\" \nchance of success. Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1046.   Furthermore, the interest of the public \nin containing the further spread of this highly contagious virus also favors granting relief \nto the plaintiffs.   \nThe Court again acknowledges the deference owed to the Sheriff in the operation \nof the Jail and in his development of internal procedures to maintain safety, order, and \nsecurity and to response to this severe crisis.  The Court has taken these \nconsiderations into account in ordering the limited relief described in this order.  The \nCourt has tailored this relief to account for deference to the Jail's ongoing planning and \nefforts to address the risks associated with the coronavirus outbreak.  The Court has \nalso, as indicated earlier, taken into account the enhanced requirements for issuing \nwhat it has referred to as a \"mandatory injunction.\"  The risk to the health and safety of \ndetainees and others is sufficient to invoke this form of relief. \nC.  Remedy    \n  For the reasons stated above, the plaintiffs have met the criteria for a temporary \nrestraining order with regard to at least parts of the claim Count 1 of their complaint.  \nThe next question is what remedy is appropriate under the circumstances.  The Court \naddresses in turn each category of remedy the plaintiffs seek. \n  1.  Coronavirus testing   \n  The plaintiffs seek an order requiring the Sheriff to acquire access to rapid \n33 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 34 of 37 PageID #:1100\ncoronavirus testing and ensure that all people who enter the Jail with the virus can be \nquickly identified and medically isolated.  They also seek an order requiring the Sheriff \nto quarantine all new detainees until test results become available or, if testing cannot \nbe done, for fourteen days unless they become symptomatic. \n  In light of the evidence that the Sheriff now has access to rapid coronavirus \ntesting, and for the reasons previously stated, the Court grants plaintiffs' request only to \nthe following limited extent.  The Court directs the Sheriff to establish by April 11, 2020, \nand to implement immediately thereafter, a policy requiring prompt coronavirus testing \nof detainees who exhibit symptoms consistent with coronavirus disease as well as, at \nmedically appropriate times and to the extent feasible based on the acquisition of \nsufficient testing materials, detainees who have been exposed to others who have \nexhibited those symptoms or have tested positive for coronavirus.   \n  Because evidence shows the Sheriff has a policy in place requiring a fourteen-\nday quarantine of all new detainees (the apparent length of coronavirus's incubation \nperiod), the Court declines to require further testing or quarantining of new detainees \nbefore housing them in the general population, though the Sheriff should account for \nnew detainees in his testing plan. \n  2.  Quarantining and social distancing \n   The plaintiffs also seek an order requiring the Sheriff to medically isolate all \ndetainees who are positive for COVID-19 in a controlled, monitored environment in \nwhich they are not at risk for infecting others; quarantine all detainees who are \nsymptomatic and/or have been exposed to a confirmed case of COVID-19 in such an \nenvironment; and mandate social distancing among all detainees.  For the reasons \n34 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 35 of 37 PageID #:1101\ndescribed earlier, the Court at this time directs only that the Sheriff enforce, effective on \nApril 11, 2020, social distancing during the new detainee intake process, including \nsuspending the use of bullpens to hold new detainees awaiting intake. \n  3.  Sanitation \n  The plaintiffs next seek an order requiring the Sheriff to provide sufficient soap \nand hand sanitizer to all detainees so that they may frequently wash their hands.  In \naddition, they seek an order directing the Sheriff to provide sanitation supplies to enable \nall staff and detainees to regularly sanitize surfaces and objects on which coronavirus \ncould be present and to provide supervision to ensure that sanitizing takes place \nbetween uses of those surfaces and objects.  They also seek an order directing the \nSheriff to educate all staff and detainees on the importance of regularly sanitizing all \nsurfaces and objects on which the virus could be present.   \n  For the reasons stated above, the Court directs the Sheriff to begin, by April 10, \n2020, providing soap and/or hand sanitizer to all detainees in quantities sufficient to \npermit them to frequently clean their hands.  The Court also orders the Sheriff to begin, \nby April 10, 2020, providing adequate sanitation supplies to enable all staff and \ndetainees to regularly sanitize surfaces and objects on which the virus could be present, \nincluding in all areas occupied or frequented by more than one person (such as two-\nperson cells, as well as bathrooms and showers).  The Court further directs the Sheriff \nto establish, by April 11, 2020, a policy requiring sanitization between all uses of \nfrequently touched surfaces and objects as well as monitoring and supervision to \nensure that such sanitization takes place regularly.  In light of evidence that the Sheriff \nhas established education programs on preventative measures pertaining to \n35 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 36 of 37 PageID #:1102\ncoronavirus, the Court declines to impose any further requirements in this regard. \n  4.  PPE   \n  For the reasons the Court has described, it declines plaintiffs' request for an \norder requiring the Sheriff to provide all detainees with PPE.  Instead, the Court orders \nthe Sheriff, effective April 12, 2020, to provide facemasks to all detainees who are \nquarantined—i.e., those who have been exposed to a detainee who is symptomatic \n(even if not coronavirus-positive).   \n  It appears to the Court that, as of the date of the hearing, the Sheriff is \nadequately enforcing the use of PPE by Jail staff who come into contact with detainees, \nso the Court declines to impose further requirements in that regard. \n  5.  Adequate medical staff \n  The plaintiffs request the Court to order the Sheriff to provide adequate medical \nstaff to monitor all detainees within the Jail.  Because the plaintiffs have pointed to no \nevidence that the Jail's medical staff are under the purview of the Sheriff, as opposed to \nCermak Health Services, the Court declines to impose this requirement upon the \nSheriff.  The Court also notes that the record does not sufficiently reflect a current lack \nof adequate medical staff, making the requested relief inappropriate as part of a \ntemporary restraining order even were this a matter under the control of the Sheriff.  \n  6.  Medical triage of vulnerable detainees \n  For the reasons stated above, the Court declines to enter an order requiring the \nSheriff to immediately identify or segregate all medically vulnerable detainees even if \nthey are not showing symptoms.   \n   \n36 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 47 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 37 of 37 PageID #:1103\n  7.  Transfer of Subclass B members \n  Finally, the plaintiffs have requested an order requiring transfer of the putative \nmembers of Subclass B to a safe facility or other forms of custody.  They contend that \neven the implementation of reasonable sanitation and other related procedures is \ninsufficient to protect these class members, some of whom may already have been \nexposed to coronavirus, from contracting the disease.  The Court concludes that \nplaintiffs have not demonstrated that the requirements of this temporary restraining \norder, coupled with the steps the Sheriff is already taking to prevent the spread of the \ndisease, are insufficient and thus denies this requested relief.   \nConclusion   \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants in part plaintiffs' motion for a \ntemporary restraining order [dkt. no. 2] with regard to Count 1 of the complaint but \notherwise denies the motion.  The Court enters a temporary restraining order to the \nextent explained in the relief section of this opinion.  The Court directs the Sheriff to file \na report by 4:00 p.m. on April 13, 2020 regarding his implementation of the Court's \ndirectives.  The case is set for a telephonic status hearing before the undersigned \njudge, as emergency judge, on April 14, 2020 at 9:00 a.m.  The Clerk will provide the \nparties with call-in information prior to April 14.  \n \n              ________________________________ \n                MATTHEW F.

County of Riverside  \n   \n \nPresent: The Honorable  VIRGINIA A. PHILLIPS, CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n   \nCHRISTINE CHUNG    Not Reported \nDeputy Clerk    Court Reporter \n     \n \nAttorney(s) Present for Plaintiff(s):  Attorney(s) Present for Defendant(s): \nNone Present    None Present \n \nProceedings:  (IN CHAMBERS) MINUTE ORDER GRANTING “EMERGENCY MOTION TO \nENFORCE CONSENT DECREE” [DKT. 177]  \n \nOn April 6, 2020, Plaintiff Quinton Gray (“Plaintiff”) filed a document captioned \n“Emergency Motion1 to Enforce Consent Decree.”  (“Motion,” Dkt. 177).  Pursuant to this \nCourt’s April 8, 2020 Minute Order, (Dkt. 182), Defendant County of Riverside \n(“Defendant”) opposed the Motion on April 10, 2020 (“Opp.,” Dkt. 183).  After \nconsidering all papers submitted in support of, and in opposition to, the Motion, as well \nas the arguments advanced during the telephonic hearing on April 13, 2020, the Court \nGRANTS the Motion.  \n \nIn 2016, the Parties entered into a Consent Decree “to ensure the provision of \nconstitutional health care and to ensure non-discrimination for inmates with disabilities \nin the Riverside County Jails.”  (Dkt. 173 ¶ 1).  The plaintiff class includes three distinct \nsubclasses: the medical subclass, which comprises “[a]ll prisoners who are now, or will \nin the future be, subjected to the medical care policies and practices of the Riverside \n                                              \n1 The Court notes that an “Emergency Motion” is procedurally improper.  Plaintiff \nshould have filed an ex parte application to shorten time for hearing on a motion, \nin conformance with Local Rule 7-19.  In the interests of justice, the Court will \ntreat Plaintiff’s Motion as though it had been filed properly.  \nPage 1 of 6  CIVIL MINUTES – GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk cc  \n \n\nCase 5C:1a3s-ec:v -10:2004-4c4v--V0A21P3-O4 PD o  cDuomcuemnte #n:t  5169 1F i le Fdi:le 0d4 0/144/1/240/2 P0a  g Pea 3g eo f2 7 o Pf a6g  e PIDa g#e:1 I5D9 #6:17955\nJails”; the mental health subclass, which comprises “[a]ll prisoners who are now, or will \nin the future be, subjected to the mental health care policies and practices of the \nRiverside Jails”; and the disability subclass, which comprises “all prisoners who are \nnow, or will be in the future, subjected to policies and practices of the Riverside jails \nregarding specialized or sheltered housing for prisoners due to their mobility \nimpairments and need for assistive devices, and the provision and confiscation of \naccommodations for prisoners with mobility impairments[.]”  (Dkt. 173 ¶ 3).   \n \nThe Parties to the Consent Decree negotiated a Remedial Plan, which “is \ndesigned to meet the minimum level of health care necessary to fulfill Defendant’s \nobligations under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as to ensure non-\ndiscrimination against inmates with disabilities in the areas addressed by the Plan, as \nrequired by the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.”  (Dkt. 173 ¶ 9).  In light \nof the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic2, “Plaintiffs seek to enforce the Consent \nDecree by requiring the County to submit a plan to the Court to implement the \nGovernor’s order for physical distancing for all Californians housed in the jails and to \nprovide sanitation and other essential services generally accepted as necessary in \ncorrectional facilities to provide for the basic health needs of incarcerated people.”  \n(Motion at 3-4). \n \nAs Defendant argues, the Consent Decree specifies a dispute resolution process \nwhich provides that the Parties first conduct negotiations to resolve informally matters in \ndispute, then, if they are unable to resolve the dispute, to request that the Relevant \nCourt experts evaluate the issue and prepare a report.  Following preparation of this \nreport, if the parties still are unable to resolve the issue, they may request mediation \nwith Judge Raul Ramirez.  Only after having mediated are the parties to file a motion for \nrelief with this Court.  (Dkt. 173 ¶¶ 26–29).  Here, the parties have conducted the first \ntwo steps, but have not yet mediated.  Nevertheless, “[g]iven the urgent nature of the \nproceedings, Plaintiffs request the Court modify the Consent Decree to allow for urgent \nappeal for enforcement directly to the Court.”  (Motion at 17 n.2).   \n \n                                              \n2 The pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption to daily life.  On March 13, \n2020, the President of the United States declared a National Emergency in re-\nsponse to the Coronavirus Disease- 2019 (“COVID-19”) pandemic pursuant to \nthe National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. § 1601, et seq.).  California Governor \nGavin Newson has declared a state of emergency in response to the COVID-19 \noutbreak and, in his March 19, 2020 Executive Order N-33-20, “require[d] physi-\ncal distancing to keep Californians at least six feet apart at all times and to pre-\npare hospitals and health care workers for the coming surge in cases.”  (Motion \nat 2). \nPage 2 of 6  CIVIL MINUTES – GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk cc  \n \n\nCase 5C:1a3s-ec:v -10:2004-4c4v--V0A21P3-O4 PD o  cDuomcuemnte #n:t  5169 1F i le Fdi:le 0d4 0/144/1/240/2 P0a  g Pea 4g eo f3 7 o Pf a6g  e PIDa g#e:1 I5D9 #7:17956\nThe Court finds good cause to modify the Consent Decree to permit appeal to \nthis Court.  “[A] party seeking modification of a consent decree bears the burden of \nestablishing that a significant change in circumstances warrants revision of the decree. . \n. . A party seeking modification of a consent decree may meet its initial burden by \nshowing either a significant change either in factual conditions or in law.”” Rufo v. \nInmates of Suffolk Cty. Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 383–84 (1992).  The party seeking \nmodification need not prove the change in circumstance was “unforeseen and \nunforeseeable” at the time of entering into the consent decree, but “[o]rdinarily, . . . \nmodification should not be granted where a party relies upon events that actually were \nanticipated at the time it entered into a decree.”  Id. at 385 (emphasis added).  Here, \nclearly, the emergency resulting from the pandemic constitutes a “significant change in \ncircumstances” that was not actually foreseen at the time the parties entered into the \nConsent Decree.  Id. at 383.   \n \nThe parties therefore meet the standard to modify the Consent Decree to permit \nappeal to this Court.  In light of the urgency of the matter, the Court orders a two-track \ndispute resolution mechanism.  The Parties are to proceed with mediation before Judge \nRamirez on April 17, 2020, or an earlier date, if possible.  (See Opp. at 10).  The Court \nsimultaneously assumes jurisdiction to enforce the Consent Decree to the extent \nspecified in this Order.   \n \nThe Court next turns to Defendant’s obligations under the Consent Decree.  \nPlaintiff seeks to enforce the Consent Decree’s mandate to “meet the minimum level of \nhealth care necessary to fulfill Defendant’s obligations under the Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments,” (Dkt. 173 ¶ 9), by ensuring that Defendants implement the physical \ndistancing recommendations made by the Court’s experts, (see Dkt. 178, Ex. J, Allen \nExpert Report, ¶¶ 9-10, 14-16; Dkt. 178, Ex. K, Gage Expert Report, ¶¶ 5-10.).  Plaintiff \nargues that the County has several options available to limit the spread of the disease \nwithin the jails, including transferring prisoners to new, currently empty, John J. Benoit \nDetention Center (“JJBDC”) in Indio, California; relocating particularly vulnerable \nprisoners; and even release people to allow for physical distancing.  (Motion at 4).  At \nthe hearing, Defendant did not have information regarding conditions in the existing \ncounty jail facilities, insisted that moving prisoners to a newly completed, empty jail in \nIndio was not feasible, and admitted that it had not researched alternative housing \noptions such as recreation centers, halfway houses, and hotels.  Rather than having \ncreated a plan to safeguard those most vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus, Defendant \nconceded that it has not conducted an analysis of its own records to identify particularly \nvulnerable prisoners.  It also has not conducted an analysis of its jail population to \ndetermine whether there are any low-level offenders who might be eligible for early \nrelease. \nPage 3 of 6  CIVIL MINUTES – GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk cc  \n \n\nCase 5C:1a3s-ec:v -10:2004-4c4v--V0A21P3-O4 PD o  cDuomcuemnte #n:t  5169 1F i le Fdi:le 0d4 0/144/1/240/2 P0a  g Pea 5g eo f4 7 o Pf a6g  e PIDa g#e:1 I5D9 #8:17957\n \nDespite Defendant’s insistence that conditions in the Riverside County jails are \ncompliant with public health recommendations regarding social distancing, its counsel \nlacked information to respond to the Court’s questions regarding the ability to maintain 6 \nfeet distance between all prisoners in the jail, at all times, its plan for doing so, the size \nof cells and dormitories, and the number of prisoners per room. \nDefendant failed to provide satisfactory information about the feasibility of trans-\nfer of prisoners to other jail or non-jail facilities, including transfers of prisoners currently \nconfined in crowded jails to the new, empty, John J. Benoit Detention Center (“JJBDC”) \nin Indio, California.  The County states that it is “not-yet-ready to be populated” but pro-\nvides no details as to why.  (Opp. at 13).  The County stated at the hearing that the facil-\nity was completed in February 2020, but maintained that it is not yet ready for prisoners.  \nIn their papers and at the hearing, Defendant argued that “[t]he Sheriff’s Department is \ncurrently in the midst of a ninety day ‘transition period’ of the facility to determine \nwhether any issues arise that will need to be resolved before JJBDC can be populated \nwith inmates.”  (Dkt. 183-4, “Graves Decl.” ¶ 4).  The County states that the technology \nused in the JJBDC facility differs from that of other County facilities, but did not explain, \nin its papers or at the hearing, why this would prevent the transfer of inmates in an \nemergency situation.  (Graves Decl. ¶ 5).   \nShould the County be unable to implement adequate social distancing within its \nexisting jail facilities and take other necessary steps to decrease risk of infection, this \nCourt has the authority to order the transfer of prisoners to different facilities. Under \nCalifornia law, the Sheriff has the authority to relocate prisoners to respond to \nemergency situations: \n \nIn any case in which an emergency endangering the lives of inmates of a \nstate, county, or city penal or correctional institution has occurred or is im-\nminent, the person in charge of the institution may remove the inmates \nfrom the institution. He shall, if possible, remove them to a safe and con-\nvenient place and there confine them as long as may be necessary to \navoid the danger, or, if that is not possible, may release them. \nOther courts, including the Superior Court for the County of Sacramento County, al-\nready have ordered the Sheriff to use its authority under Cal. Gov't Code § 8658 to re-\nspond to the coronavirus emergency.  See Order Authorizing Sacramento County Sher-\niff’s Department to Grant Release (Cal. Super. Ct., Sac. Cty., Mar. 25, 2020).  \n \nDefendant argues that the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”) precludes this \nCourt from ordering the release of prisoners.  Even assuming this is true, nothing in the \nPage 4 of 6  CIVIL MINUTES – GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk cc  \n \n\nCase 5C:1a3s-ec:v -10:2004-4c4v--V0A21P3-O4 PD o  cDuomcuemnte #n:t  5169 1F i le Fdi:le 0d4 0/144/1/240/2 P0a  g Pea 6g eo f5 7 o Pf a6g  e PIDa g#e:1 I5D9 #9:17958\nPLRA prohibits a district judge from ordering the transfer of prisoners in response to vio-\nlations of their constitutional rights, as the district court did in Brown v. Plata, 2013 WL \n3200587, No. C01-1351 TEH (N.D. Cal. June 24, 2013), nor would it prohibit the Court \nfrom ordering the Sheriff to use his authority under § 8658 to transfer prisoners.  \n“[A]n order to transfer any single inmate out of a prison to correct the violation of \na constitutional right” where a “transfer was necessary for the inmate to obtain appropri-\nate medical care” is not a “prisoner release order,” but rather a transfer.  Plata v. Brown, \n2013 WL 3200587 at *8.  The same is true of “a policy that would result in transfer of a \nlarge group of inmates.”  Id.  Indeed, several potential courses of action qualify as \n“transfer” for the purposes of the PLRA.  Relocation to halfway houses, for example, is a \n“transfer” rather than “release.”  The PLRA defines a “residential reentry center” as a \nform of “prerelease custody.”  See 18 U.S.C. § 3624(g)(2)(B) (“A prisoner placed in pre-\nrelease custody pursuant to this subsection who is placed at a residential reentry center \nshall be subject to such conditions as the Director of the Bureau of Prisons [(BOP)] de-\ntermines appropriate.”).  Ninth Circuit case law assumes that a person in a “residential \nreentry center” is a “prisoner” and subject to BOP control.  See, e.g., Bottinelli v. Sala-\nzar, 929 F.3d 1196, 1200 (9th Cir. 2019) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3624(c)(1) as “requiring that \nthe BOP, ‘to the extent practicable, ensure that a prisoner serving a term of imprison-\nment spends a portion of the final months of that term’ in prerelease custody”). \n \nIn Plata v. Brown, the court declined to decide which standard governs the \ncourt’s review of such requests for transfer, finding that the Plata plaintiffs could satisfy \nthe most burdensome standard.  That standard “would require [them] to demonstrate \nthat the [transfer] policy must be enforced because failure to do so would result in delib-\nerate indifference under the Eighth Amendment.”  Id. at *10.  The Court makes no deter-\nmination here as to whether Plaintiff has met this standard, but notes that the County’s \nrecitation of “aggressive and swift” measures it has taken in response to COVID-19, \nnone of which concern jails, suggests that the County’s failure to act to protect inmates \ndoes indeed constitute deliberate indifference.  (Opp. at 16).  The County’s assurances \nthat it has provided unlimited free soap to prisoners and advised prisoners to remain \nphysically distant—without establishing that it is physically possible to do so—is unlikely \nto be sufficient to defeat a claim of deliberate indifference (or sufficient to defeat the re-\nquest to transfer prisoners for health reasons).  \nIn sum, Defendant has failed to demonstrate that it is currently taking adequate \nprecautions to protect the health of the prisoners in the county jails.  Plaintiff’s request \nthat Defendant be required “to submit a plan to the Court to implement the Governor’s \norder for physical distancing for all Californians housed in the jails” (Motion at 3-4), is \ntherefore GRANTED. \nPage 5 of 6  CIVIL MINUTES – GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk cc  \n \n\nCase 5C:1a3s-ec:v -10:2004-4c4v--V0A21P3-O4 PD o  cDuomcuemnte #n:t  5169 1F i le Fdi:le 0d4 0/144/1/240/2 P0a  g Pea 7g eo f6 7 o Pf a6g  e PIDa g#e:1 I6D0 #0:17959\nPlaintiffs are instructed to submit a proposed order detailing the findings and \noutstanding questions from the April 13, 2020 hearing no later than 4:00 p.m. on April \n15, 2020.

In support of their \njoint motion, the parties state: \nBACKGROUND \n1.  On April 3, 2020, Plaintiffs filed this suit as a putative class action against Sheriff \nThomas J. Dart, in his official capacity as Cook County Sheriff, alleging violations of their \nconstitutional rights based on Defendant’s response to COVID-19 in the Cook County Jail and \nmoving for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) and a preliminary injunction on behalf of a \nclass of litigants (“Litigation”). \n2.  Plaintiffs additionally moved to certify a class of all people who were housed or \nwho would in the future be housed in the Cook County Jail for the duration of the COVID-19 \npandemic, regarding the Cook County Sheriff’s Office’s response to the pandemic. See ECF No. \n \n1   The parties apologize to the Court for this tardy filing, which was the product of a \nmiscommunication among counsel. \n \n   \n1030311\\314540507.v1 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 298 Filed: 09/14/23 Page 2 of 11 PageID #:5008\n6. Plaintiffs also moved to certify two additional subclasses—Subclass A consisted of all people \nwho, because of age or previous medical conditions, are at particularly grave risk of harm from \nCOVID-19, while Subclass B consisted of all people currently housed on a tier where someone \ntested positive for coronavirus.  The class and two subclasses are collectively referred to as \n“Proposed Class.” \n3.  On April 9, 2020, Judge Matthew Kennelly, in his capacity as Emergency Judge, \nand after an extended hearing on the motion for a TRO, granted in part and denied in part \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a TRO requiring the Defendant to take certain actions in response to \nCOVID-19, while denying Plaintiffs’ request for class-wide habeas corpus relief. ECF No. 47. \n4.  On April 27, 2020, Judge Kennelly granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs’ \nrequest to convert the TRO of April 9, 2020 to a preliminary injunction with certain additional \nrelief, and again denied Plaintiffs’ request for class-wide habeas corpus relief.  ECF Nos. 73, 74. \nIn issuing the preliminary injunction, Judge Kennelly conditionally certified the Proposed Class. \nECF No. 73 at 48-52. \n5.  On May 11, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office filed a notice of appeal \nregarding the district court’s preliminary injunction order. \n6.  On June 19, 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit \nstayed a portion of the district court’s April 27, 2020 preliminary injunction. On September 8, \n2020, the Seventh Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court’s preliminary \ninjunction. Mays v. Dart, 974 F.3d 810 (7th Cir. 2020). \n7.  The Sheriff’s Office then filed a petition for writ of certiorari before the United \nStates Supreme Court, seeking review of the Seventh Circuit’s decision of September 8, 2020.  \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 298 Filed: 09/14/23 Page 3 of 11 PageID #:5009\nWhile the petition was pending, the parties agreed to extend those portions of the April 27, 2020 \npreliminary injunction that had been affirmed in the Seventh Circuit’s September 8, 2020 ruling. \n8.  On October 4, 2021, the Supreme Court of the United States denied the Sheriff’s \nOffice’s petition for a writ of certiorari to review the Seventh Circuit’s decision of September 8, \n2020. \n9.  Between October 2021 and May 2022, the parties held multiple conferences \nregarding discovery, dispositive motion practice, and of the preliminary injunction, as well as the \npotential for settlement of the Litigation. \n10.  On May 2022, the Parties engaged in settlement discussions, with participation \nfrom Cook County Health, which operates Cermak Health Services (“Cermak”), the medical \nprovider for the Cook County Jail. \n11.  Beginning in January 2023, the Parties and Cermak participated in multiple \nsettlement conferences with Magistrate Judge M. David Weisman, culminating in a settlement in \nprinciple on March 20, 2023.   \n12.  Subsequent to this settlement in principle the Parties, after consulting with their \ncounsel, concluded that it would be in their best interests to fully and completely resolve all \nclass-wide disputes between them without the burden, expense, and inconvenience of further \nlitigation or the trial process. \nSETTLEMENT TERMS \n13.  As the Court is aware, the parties’ settlement includes Policy Modifications and \nPayment of Attorney Fees.    The parties’ agreement contemplates that the settlement will be a \ncomplete resolution of the Litigation, and that the April 27, 2020 preliminary injunction (ECF \nNo. 74), as modified by the Seventh Circuit, will be dissolved upon the final approval of the \nsettlement.  For policy modifications, Cermak agreed to modify Policy B-02.6 related to \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 298 Filed: 09/14/23 Page 4 of 11 PageID #:5010\nCOVID-19 and the Sheriff’s Office agreed to modify Policy 1603 relating to its COVID-19 \nprocedures.  Plaintiffs also agreed to accept a monetary payment to satisfy all attorney’s fees, \ncosts, expert-witness fees and costs, and any other financial obligation incurred by Plaintiffs, the \nProposed Class, and their counsel in prosecuting this Litigation.  Both entities’ policy \nmodifications, as well as the attorney’s fees, are the product of an arms-length negotiation \nbetween the parties and Cermak with the Court’s assistance. \n14.  By resolving this matter, the Parties intend to resolve all pending claims class-\nwide arising out of this Litigation.  The Parties acknowledge the existing preliminary injunction, \nin effect since April 27, 2020, will be dissolved upon the filing of the Parties’ stipulation of \ndismissal. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n“There is . . . a strong judicial policy in favor of class action settlement.” 4 Newberg and \nRubenstein on Class Actions § 13:1 (6th ed.) (quotation omitted).  Accord Isby v. Bayh, 75 F.3d \n1191, 1196 (7th Cir. 1996) (“Federal courts naturally favor the settlement of class action \nlitigation.”). Under Rule 23(e), a class action settlement that is binding on absent class members \nrequires court approval. See In re Motorola Sec. Litig., 644 F.3d 511, 518 (7th Cir. 2011).  This \ncourt approval is a two-step process: (1) preliminary approval of the settlement, and (2) final \ndetermination that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate after a notice period. See \nArmstrong v. Bd. of Sch. Directors of City of Milwaukee, 616 F.2d 305, 314 (7th Cir. 1980), \noverruled on other grounds by Felzen v. Andreas, 134 F.3d 873 (7th Cir. 1998). \nTo grant preliminary approval, the court determines whether the class is proper for \nsettlement purposes, and, if so, preliminarily certifies the class for that purpose. See Amchem \nProds., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 620 (1997). To support class certification, a court must \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 298 Filed: 09/14/23 Page 5 of 11 PageID #:5011\nfind each of Rule 23(a)’s four requirements has been satisfied: (1) numerosity; (2) commonality; \n(3) typicality; and (4) adequacy of representation. In addition to these requirements, “parties \nseeking class certification must show that the action is maintainable under Rule 23(b)(1), (2), or \n(3).” Id. at 614.  \nFor purposes of this joint motion, and without waiver of any defenses or acceptance of \nliability, the Parties stipulate that the proposed class meets the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2), \nwhich “permits class actions for declaratory or injunctive relief where ‘the party opposing the \nclass has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class.’” Id. (quoting Rule \n23(b)(2)). See Amchem Prods., 521 U.S. at 614 (“Rule 23(b)(2) permits class actions for \ndeclaratory or injunctive relief where ‘the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \ngrounds generally applicable to the class.’ Civil rights cases against parties charged with \nunlawful, class-based discrimination are prime examples.”). \nWhen deciding whether to grant preliminary approval, the court determines whether the \nproposed settlement warrants consideration by members of the class and a later, full examination \nby the court at a final approval hearing. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). Preliminary approval merely \nrequires the Court to determine whether the settlement falls “within the range of possible \napproval.”  Armstrong, 616 F.2d at 314.  The proposed Settlement Class and Agreement satisfy \nthese requirements. \nANALYSIS \n \nRule 23(a) and Rule 23(b)(2) set forth four requirements for certifying an injunctive \nclass. Under Rule 23(a), the four prerequisites for class certification are numerosity, \ncommonality, typicality, and adequate representation. Beaton v. SpeedyPC Software, 907 F.3d \n1018, 1025 (7th Cir. 2018). “Once these four prerequisites are satisfied, the potential class must \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 298 Filed: 09/14/23 Page 6 of 11 PageID #:5012\nalso satisfy at least one provision of Rule 23(b).” Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1017 (7th \nCir. 1992).   \nPlaintiffs filed their class action complaint on behalf of a class consisting of “all people \nwho are currently or who will in the future be housed in the Cook County Jail for the duration of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic.”  ECF No. 1 ¶ 60.  The Court provisionally certified this class (as well \nas two subclasses) in its April 9, 2020 TRO decision.  ECF No. 47 at 6-9.  The parties stipulate \nthat, for purposes of settlement and without waiver of any defenses, the Court’s TRO class \ncertification analysis is equally applicable to a class of “all people who are currently or who \nwill in the future be housed in the Cook County Jail.”  The parties quote from the relevant \nportions: \nA.  The proposed class provisionally certified by the Court meets the \nrequirements of Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b)(2). \n \nFor the purposes of this joint motion to approve settlement the parties, while reserving \ntheir rights, stipulate that the proposed settlement class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(a) \nand Rule 23(b)(2).  The parties draw from the class certification analysis set forth in the Court’s \nApril 9, 2020 TRO opinion, ECF No. 47. \n1.  The proposed class meets the numerosity requirement.  \n \nThe Court’s April 9, 2020 Order stated: \n \nAs for the first prerequisite, numerosity, there is “no magic number” that is \nregarded as sufficient, but forty is generally accepted as sufficient to satisfy Rule \n23(a). Mulvania v. Sheriff of Rock Island Cty., 850 F.3d 849, 859 (7th Cir. 2017). \nIt is undisputed that there are over 4,000 detainees in the Jail . . . . \n \nECF No. 47 at 7.  The April 9 Order held that classes within the Jail satisfied the numerosity \nrequirement.  Id. The parties stipulate for purposes of this settlement that the proposed class \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 298 Filed: 09/14/23 Page 7 of 11 PageID #:5013\nsatisfies the requirement as well, since at any one time there are thousands of people housed at \nthe Cook County Jail. \n2.  The proposed class meets the commonality requirement. \nThe April 9 Order held that the commonality requirement had been satisfied, noting: \nCommonality requires at least one question common to all the class members, the \nanswer to which is “apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.” Wal-Mart Stores, \nInc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011). [The class] claims turn on a common \nquestion of whether detainees are facing an unconstitutional risk of harm to their \nhealth due to conditions [arising from the COVID-19] in the Jail . . . . \n \nECF No. 47 at 8.  For purposes of this settlement, the parties likewise stipulate that the \ncommonality requirement is satisfied, in that there is a common question of whether the \nproposed settlement terms provide appropriate protection for the class members going forward, \nconsidering the current state and prevalence of the COVID-19 coronavirus. \n3.  The proposed class representatives meet the typicality requirement. \n \nThe Court’s April 9 Order noted that “a named plaintiff's claims are typical if they \n‘arise[] from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other \nclass members and [are] based on the same legal theory.’”  ECF No. 47 at 8 (quoting Lacy v. \nCook County, 897 F.3d 847, 866 (7th Cir. 2018)).  The Court held that “[t]he claims of the \nnamed plaintiffs here are typical of the class, because the named plaintiff and the members of the \nclass all contend that they face a serious risk of contracting coronavirus due to the Jail's allegedly \ndeficient living conditions and precautions, and they and the class seek the same relief.”  Id. \nFor purposes of this settlement, the parties stipulate that the typicality requirements are \nmet in the settlement context, as the proposed settlement affords class-wide relief equally \napplicable to all members of the proposed class. \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 298 Filed: 09/14/23 Page 8 of 11 PageID #:5014\n4.  The proposed class representatives and proposed class counsel meet the \nadequacy requirement. \n \nThe Court’s April 9 Order held that the adequacy requirement was satisfied, as the class \nrepresentatives “share[] an interest with the [absent class] members . . . in relief from jail \nconditions that [Plaintiffs] allege have put them at risk” from the coronavirus. ECF No. 47 at 9.  \nFor purposes of this settlement, the parties stipulate that this requirement is met here as well, as \nthe interests of the class representatives and the absent class members are aligned with respect to \nthe impact of COVID-19 on people housed in the Cook County Jail. The parties further \nrespectfully submit that class counsel are adequate representatives.   \n5.  The proposed class meets the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2). \n \nIn its April 9 Order, the Court held that Rule 23(b)(2) certification was appropriate, \nobserving that: \nRule 23(b)(2) permits class actions if “the party opposing the class has acted or \nrefused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,” so that injunctive or \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate for the class as a whole. The plaintiffs satisfy this \nrequirement because they seek “the same . . . injunctive relief for everyone” in the \nclass and in each subclass. See Chi. Teachers Union, Local No. 1 v. Bd. of Educ. \nof Chi., 797 F.3d 426, 442 (7th Cir. 2015). \nECF No. 47 at 9.  For purposes of this settlement, the parties stipulate that Rule 23(b)(2) is \nsatisfied, as the settlement relief submitted for settlement approval would apply to all class \nmembers equally.  \n  For these reasons, the parties stipulate for purposes of settlement that the proposed \nsettlement class should be certified under Rule 23(b)(2). \nB.  The proposed settlement falls well within the range of possible approval. \n “District court review of a class action settlement proposal is a two-step process. The \nfirst step is a preliminary, pre-notification hearing to determine whether the proposed settlement \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 298 Filed: 09/14/23 Page 9 of 11 PageID #:5015\nis ‘within the range of possible approval.’ This hearing is not a fairness hearing; its purpose, \nrather, is to ascertain whether there is any reason to notify the class members of the proposed \nsettlement and to proceed with a fairness hearing.”  Armstrong, 616 F.2d at 314. With respect to \nthe first, preliminary step, “[i]f the proposed settlement appears to be the product of serious, \ninformed, non-collusive negotiations, has no obvious deficiencies, does not improperly grant \npreferential treatment to class representatives or segments of the class, and falls within the range \nof possible approval, then the court should direct that the notice be given to the class members of \na formal fairness hearing.” Manual for Complex Litigation, Second § 30.44 (1985).   \nThe parties respectfully submit that the preliminary requirements for notice are satisfied \nin this case.  As the Court is well aware, the proposed settlement is the result of months of hard-\nfought, arms-length negotiations between Plaintiffs and Defendants. Prior to these negotiations, \nPlaintiffs vigorously litigated their case, moved for multiple injunctions, and appeared before the \nCourt on numerous occasions.  Defendant Dart denied and continues to deny liability altogether \nand litigated with equal vigor.  Recognizing the changing nature of the pandemic, and the \ndifficult legal and factual issues raised by this case, counsel for both parties engaged in months \nof negotiations, passed multiple settlement drafts, and sought and received multiple extensions \nfrom this Court, and ultimately conducted an arms-length mediation, in which this Court \nparticipated, before finally reaching the agreement that is now before this Court. \nFurthermore, the parties submit that the proposed settlement falls within the range of \npossible approval on the merits.  While the parties remain in disagreement about the merits of \nthis Litigation, it is beyond dispute that (a) at the time this case was filed, the COVID-19 \npandemic posed a serious and urgent danger to the general public and people housed in the Cook \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 298 Filed: 09/14/23 Page 10 of 11 PageID #:5016\nCounty Jail alike, and that (b) that while COVID-19 remains a transmissible infection, the public \ndanger it originally posed has since dissipated, and the pandemic has ended.   \nIn light of the changed nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed settlement offers \nreal, substantive relief.  The agreed changes to Cermak Policy B-02.6 and Cook County \nSheriff’s Office Policy 1603 address both entities’ response to COVID-19 should the virus re-\nemerge as a serious public health threat.   \nThe agreed-upon attorney fees, meanwhile, offer compensation, negotiated at arm’s \nlength, for the considerable expenses incurred by Plaintiff counsel who, as the Court is aware, \ndevoted hundreds of hours and made expert expenditures to the prosecution of this case and the \nprotection of the class. \nA.  The proposed notice form and notice plan is appropriate. \nThe parties respectfully submit that the proposed notice form, attached hereto as Exhibit \n1, is appropriate.  As the Court’s July 25, 2023 Order contemplates, the proposed notice will be \nposted throughout the Jail for a 45-day period.   ECF No. 291.   \nThe parties respectfully submit that the content of the proposed notice form is \nappropriate.  The form explains the basis of the lawsuit, the contours of the settlement class, the \nrelief to which the settlement class members are entitled, and the rights of the settlement class \nmembers (including the right to object).  The notice also provides contact information for \nPlaintiffs’ counsel in the event a class member has questions about the settlement.  The proposed \nnotice form and plan each satisfy Rule 23(c)(2) and Rule 23(e)(1)’s elements for effecting class \nnotice.  \nThe parties do seek the Court’s guidance with respect to one aspect of notice: the \nSheriff’s Office believes publication of notice should be made in the Chicago Tribune and \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 298 Filed: 09/14/23 Page 11 of 11 PageID #:5017\nChicago Sun-Times, as newspapers of record for Cook County, Illinois.  Plaintiffs question the \nneed for this additional notice, given the definition of the class.  The parties seek guidance from \nthe Court regarding whether this additional form of notice is called for in this case. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the parties jointly and respectfully submit that the proposed \nsettlement is within the range of possible approval, and that the proposed notice should be \npublished to the class. \nDate: September 14, 2023        Respectfully submitted: \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ COUNSEL  DEFENDANT’S COUNSEL \n \n/s/ Locke Bowman                        _  /s/ Robert T.

Robert Gettleman \n \nPARTIES’ JOINT MOTION TO EXTEND THE PRELIMINARY  \nINJUNCTION AND TO STAY DISCOVERY PENDING APPEAL \n \n  Plaintiff, ANTHONY MAYS, Individually and on behalf of a class of similarly situated \npersons, and Plaintiff JUDIA JACKSON, as next friend of KENNETH FOSTER, Individually and \non behalf of a class of similarly situated persons (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), by and through their \nattorneys at the RODERICK AND SOLANGE MACARTHUR JUSTICE CENTER, LOEVY & \nLOEVY, CIVIL RIGHTS CORPS, and WINSTON & STRAWN, LLP; and Defendant THOMAS \nJ. DART (“Defendant”), by and through his attorneys at HINSHAW & CULBERTSON, LLP, \nhereby jointly move this Court to extend the duration of its Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. 74), \nsubject to the order of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals staying social distancing requirements \nin housing areas, and to stay all discovery in the District Court until such time as the district court \ncan take proper action following the return of the mandate to the district court from the Seventh \nCircuit, in the interest of efficiency and preserving the status quo. In support of their motion, the \nparties state as follows: \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 137 Filed: 07/07/20 Page 2 of 6 PageID #:3219\n1.  Plaintiffs have brought this case for injunctive relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \non behalf of a class of all individuals detained at the Cook County Jail regarding the actions taken \nby the Sheriff in response to the coronavirus. Dkt. 1. In response, the Sheriff has maintained that \nhis actions have been objectively reasonable. Dkt. 29, 41, 62. \n2.  On April 9, 2020, the Court entered a temporary restraining order, directing the \nSheriff to establish and implement policies regarding coronavirus testing, sanitation, and hygiene; \nto enforce social distancing during the new detainee intake process (and to suspend the use of \nbullpens at intake); and to provide masks to quarantined detainees. Dkt. 47 at 33-36 (detailing the \ncontents of the required policies). \n3.  On April 14, 2020, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. Dkt. 55. On April \n23, 2020, the Court conducted an evidentiary hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion, and both sides \npresented additional evidence and live testimony. Dkt. 71.  \n4.  On April 27, 2020, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction \nin part. Dkt. 73. The Court entered a preliminary injunction directing the Sheriff to take certain \nactions regarding testing, social distancing, hygiene materials, sanitation, and facemasks. Dkt. 74. \nThe Court found that its preliminary injunction was “narrowly drawn, extends no further than \nnecessary, and is the least intrusive means necessary to address” the constitutional violation, the \nfindings required under 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1). See Dkt. 73 at 82.  \n5.  On May 11, 2020, the Sheriff filed a  notice of appeal from the preliminary \ninjunction order, which remains pending, and is currently being heard by the Seventh Circuit Court \nof Appeals on an expedited basis. The Sheriff’s opening appellate brief is due July 10; Plaintiffs’ \nresponse brief is due July 24; and the Sheriff’s reply brief is due July 31. Oral argument has been \nscheduled for August 18, 2020. Mays v. Dart, 20-1792, Dkt. 29. The Sheriff joins this Motion \n2   \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 137 Filed: 07/07/20 Page 3 of 6 PageID #:3220\nwithout waiver of his arguments regarding the propriety of the Court’s findings and the entry of \nthe preliminary injunction as set forth throughout the proceedings before this Court and now in the \nappellate court.  \n6.  On June 19, 2020, the appellate court stayed that part of the injunction requiring \nthe Sheriff to establish and put into effect a policy “precluding group housing or double celling of \ndetained persons.” Dkt. 127.  \n7.  Because the Court did not set an end date for the preliminary injunction, see Dkt. \n73 at 87, the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”) provides that the preliminary injunction will \nautomatically expire 90 days after its entry—i.e., by July 27, 2020—absent further action by the \nCourt. See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2).  \n8.  The parties agree that the Court previously made the findings required under \nsubsection (a)(1) of the PLRA. Id. § 3626(a)(1). The parties further agree that this Court has \nauthority and jurisdiction to extend the duration of the preliminary injunction pending resolution \nof the appeal. See, e.g., Yates v. Collier, 677 F. App’x 915, 918 (5th Cir. 2017) (finding that \nplaintiffs could have sought an extension of the preliminary injunction beyond the PLRA’s 90-day \nexpiration date in order to permit appellate review); Ga. Advocacy Office v. Jackson, 2020 WL \n1883877, at *4-5 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 26, 2020) (finding that 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2)’s requirement to \nmake the order final “refers to finalizing the preliminary injunction by including the required \nfindings so that the preliminary injunction may be extended beyond the 90-day period during the \npendency of the action or until further order of the court”).  \n9.  The parties agree that should the circumstances warrant, the district court has \njurisdiction to entertain a request by either party to modify the preliminary injunction. Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 62(d).  \n3   \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 137 Filed: 07/07/20 Page 4 of 6 PageID #:3221\n10.  The parties agree that, in the interests of judicial economy and in an effort to \nmaintain the status quo for the duration of the appeal, the duration of the preliminary injunction \nentered by this Court on April 27, 2020, Dkt. 74, subject to the appellate court’s partial stay order, \nshould be extended until such time as the district court can take proper action following the return \nof the mandate to the district court from the Seventh Circuit, subject to further extension or \nmodification. The parties expressly agree that the Seventh Circuit’s order staying enforcement of \nthe injunction’s requirement to establish and implement a policy precluding group housing or \ndouble celling of detainees remains in effect as to that provision of the Preliminary Injunction if \nthe Court grants the parties’ joint motion. Dkt. 127. \n11.  The parties also agree that discovery in the underlying case should be stayed until \nthe pending appeal in this case is decided. Such an order, entered concurrently with the extension \nof the duration of the preliminary injunction, will ensure that the status quo is preserved and will \nfurther judicial economy by relieving the parties and the Court of the substantial burden of \nconducting discovery before significant legal issues are decided by the Seventh Circuit. \n12.  Counsel  for  Plaintiffs  and  the  Sheriff  have  consulted  with  counsel  for  the \nIntervenors, who reported that Intervenors, International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 700, \nhave no objection to this motion or the relief sought. \n  Wherefore, the parties jointly request that this Court enter an order extending the duration \nof the Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. 74), subject to further extension or modification and the \nappellate court’s partial stay order, and staying all discovery, until such time as the district court \ncan take proper action following the return of the mandate to the district court from the Seventh \nCircuit. \n   \n4   \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 137 Filed: 07/07/20 Page 5 of 6 PageID #:3222\n \nRespectfully submitted: \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ COUNSEL      DEFENDANT’S COUNSEL \n       \n/s/ Sarah Grady     _  /s/ Robert Shannon                       _ \nSarah C.

The virus is spreading rapidly in the jail since the issuance of this Court’s order,1 and that \nis not surprising: People are sleeping within three feet of each other, eating and using showers in \nclose proximity to each other, and touching the same surfaces. For counsel and the Court, casually \nspeaking to a neighbor at arm’s length or touching the pump at the gas station with an un-gloved \nhand are terrifying prospects; in the Cook County Jail, people are confined in near-constant contact \nwith each other in dormitory settings, forced to forgo the social distancing that overwhelming \nscientific and medical consensus has led government officials to mandate—by emergency decrees \n \n1   As of April 9, 448 detainees and Sheriff's staff had tested positive for COVID-19. Two detainees \nhave died since that date. As of April 13, 541 detainees and Sheriff's staff had tested positive for COVID-\n19. Injustice Watch, Cook County Jail Coronavirus \nTracker, https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/1AI4THiXJ_6Nt-\n9NXwE0MfO_DUaa1Koxi/page/hcyJB?s=oQGghs5nYPk (last visited Apr. 14, 2020). \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 2 of 21 PageID #:1494\nenforceable through criminal penalties—that the rest of us practice. These human beings are at \ngrave risk.  \n  In its April 9 temporary order, this Court concluded that full social distancing of detainees \nwas not required because CDC guidance governing correctional facilities recognizes that “space \nlimitations may require a departure from better social-distancing practices” and because the CDC \nacknowledged that correctional facilities must operate within their physical limitations for the \npurposes of that Agency’s emergency guidance to them. “Order” (Doc. 48) at 24-25. Instead of \nordering full social distancing—which may be impossible without reducing the population of the \njail—this Court took the initial step of first requiring safer practices within the jail and, specifically, \nsocial distancing at intake. (Id.) Since the Court’s order, it has become clear—as the evidence \nPlaintiffs proffer with this motion shows—that social distancing of detainees is the only way to \nprevent an intolerable risk to Plaintiffs’ health and lives. One of two additional things is therefore \ntrue: either it is possible for the Sheriff to implement medically required social distancing at current \npopulation levels, and he must be ordered to do so; or it is not possible for the Sheriff to implement \nmedically required social distancing at current population levels, and the jail’s population must be \ndecreased.  \nIn light of this reality and the continued spread of the virus since the Complaint, Plaintiffs \nrenew their ongoing request for a preliminary injunction and seek the following specific relief: (1) \nmedical triage of vulnerable detainees and the implementation of social distancing, including but \nnot limited to through transfer of detainees out of the Jail site at 2600 S. California; and (2) an \nemergency petition for habeas corpus on behalf of named Plaintiff Kenneth Foster and the class \nthat he represents; and (3) narrow, targeted, and expedited discovery, see Ex. A and Part II(B), \ninfra, which is necessary to determine whether the Sheriff is capable of complying with an \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 3 of 21 PageID #:1495\ninjunction requiring medical triage and social distancing and whether the Sheriff has complied \nwith the Court’s TRO.   \nImportantly,  if  this  Court  concludes  that  medically  necessary  social  distancing  is \nimpossible given the current population in the jail, Plaintiffs request that this Court convene an \nemergency three-judge district Court as required by 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3)(A) so that Plaintiffs \nmay proceed before to a tribunal with the statutory authority to grant the relief that the U.S. \nConstitution demands that they receive. Time is of the essence and the moment is unprecedented. \nWhether the medically required measures are taken in the next several days will determine whether \nthousands of additional people contract COVID-19. \nI.  The Existing TRO is an Essential First Step but One That Will Not Fully Protect \nAgainst the Constitutional Violations in the Jail.  \n \nIn its April 9 order, the Court required that several steps be taken to improve conditions in \nthe Jail. Specifically, the Court required the Office of the Sheriff (a) to establish and implement a \npolicy requiring prompt coronavirus testing of symptomatic detainees and, to the extent feasible \nand at medically appropriate times, detainees who have been exposed to confirmed positive \ncoronavirus cases and to symptomatic detainees (Order at 34); (b) to enforce social distancing \nduring the new detainee intake process, including suspending the use of bullpens to hold new \ndetainees awaiting intake (Order at 35); (c) to provide soap and or hand sanitizer to all detainees \nin quantities sufficient to permit them to frequently clean their hands; to provide adequate \nsanitation supplies to enable staff and detainees to regularly sanitize surfaces and objects on which \nthe virus could be present; and to create and implement a policy of frequent sanitation of objects \nand surfaces and of monitoring to ensure the sanitation takes place; and (d) to provide facemasks \nto all detainees who have been exposed to a case of coronavirus or to a symptomatic detainee—\ni.e., all detainees in quarantine.   \n  3 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 4 of 21 PageID #:1496\nUnfortunately, the evidence available since the TRO establishes that these essential steps \nhave not worked and cannot work to abate the spread of the disease. Two facts are of utmost \nimportance to this point: First, COVID-19 presents a threat of serious illness, organ failure, and \ndeath,  particularly  to  individuals  with  pre-existing  medical  vulnerabilities.2  Second,  the \noverwhelming scientific and medical consensus, as will be more fully described by Plaintiffs’ \nexperts, is that it is not possible to reduce the serious risk of COVID-19 infection without social \ndistancing.  The legal significance of these two facts, under binding precedent discussed below, is \nthat requiring confinement under conditions that expose individuals to this serious risk is not \nconstitutionally permissible. Only two options remain, then. Either Defendant is ordered to \naccomplish the social distancing that overwhelming evidence demands and that all of us are \nrequired to practice in our own lives, or Defendant is ordered to reduce the population of the jail \nuntil such distancing is possible.  \nII.  Social Distancing Is Necessary to Prevent an Unreasonable Risk to the Class. \n \nThe only way to prevent a severe risk to Plaintiffs is to immediately implement medically \nrequired social distancing. Dr. Gregg Gonsalves, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Medicine \nand School of Public Health, submits an expert declaration attached to this Motion. In it, he \nexplains the risks that COVID-19 poses to the health of people in the jail. COVID-19, he testifies, \ncan lead to “bilateral interstitial pneumonia, which causes partial or total collapse of the lung \n \n2   See Melissa Healy, Coronavirus infection may cause lasting damage throughout the body, doctors \nfear, Los Angeles Times (Apr. 10, 2020) https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-04-10/coronavirus-\ninfection-can-do-lasting-damage-to-the-heart-liver (“[E]ven after patients who become severely ill have \nrecovered and cleared the virus, physicians have begun seeing evidence of the infection’s lingering \neffects,” and describing many biological functions that had “failed to return to normal,” including \nimpaired liver function, and noting concern from cardiologists that “there will be long-term sequelae” \nform the disease); Tianbing Wang et al., Comorbidities and multi-organ injuries in the treatment of \nCOVID-19, The Lancet, https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30558-\n4/fulltext (Mar. 21, 2020) (reporting clinical indications that COVID-19 is not only capable of causing \npneumonia; it may also cause damage to other organs such as the heart, the liver, and the kidneys). \n  4 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 5 of 21 PageID #:1497\nalveoli, making it difficult or impossible for patients to breathe. . . . COVID-19 can progress from \na fever to life-threatening pneumonia with what are known as ‘ground-glass opacities.’” Ex. G ¶ 2. \nIn his expert opinion, the only way to prevent an “essentially uncontrolled” spread of this deadly \nvirus is to require complete “social distancing” of inmates—that is, to keep them six feet apart \nfrom one another. Compare id. ¶ 16 (“Social distancing means, in essence, isolating oneself from \nother people . . . and generally staying at least 6-12 feet from other people.”), with id. ¶ (“In my \nopinion, from an epidemiological perspective, ensuring that all detainees in Cook County Jail can \nsocially distance from one another is the only way to prevent further, essentially uncontrolled, \nspread of the virus.”).3  \nAs discussed more fully below, the Constitution forbids jailing people in conditions that \npose an “unreasonable” risk to their health where “the risk . . . is not one that today’s society \nchooses to tolerate.” Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 36 (1993). The mere fact that the CDC \nacknowledged in its guidance to jails that full social distancing may not be immediately feasible \nat current population levels does not affect the applicable constitutional principle. Cf. Edward J. \nHanlon, “Proof of Unconstitutional Prison Conditions,” 24 AMJUR POF 3d 467 § 7 (“Most \ncourts have held that it is improper to attempt to assess whether a given occupancy level violates \na pretrial detainee's Fourteenth Amendment rights or a prisoner's Eighth Amendment rights by \nreference to standards set by a professional organization or by expert testimony based on such \nstandards.”) (citing cases);  Moralis v. Fageole, No. 06 C 2034, 2007 WL 2893652, at (CD. Ill. \n \n3   Plaintiffs’ counsel has also worked with Professor Gonsalves to create a model that provides \nprojections of the impact of COVID-19 within correctional facilities like the Cook County Jail based on \nthe Jail's ability to implement social distancing. See Ex. D (Grady Declaration) (providing information \nabout the creation of the Model); See also Ex. J (COVID-19 Incarceration Model) (being provided to the \nCourt in its native Excel format via e-mail to the Court and counsel). \n \n  5 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 6 of 21 PageID #:1498\nSept. 28, 2007) (“ [D]efendants cannot simply escape their duty to provide dental care to those \ndetained in their jail by asserting [the United States Marshall Service agreement] does not \nauthorize the treatment.”). This is true for two reasons: First, the CDC never purported to declare \nthat social distancing is unnecessary; it only concluded that at current population levels it may \nnot be feasible.  To this point, the CDC guidelines for correctional institutions specifically \nencourage correctional administrators to “work with local law enforcement and court officials” \nto “prevent over-crowding of correctional and detention facilities,”4 and in other settings, the \nCDC recommends wholesale cancellation of schools, closures of nursing facilities, closing of \nbusiness offices, and cancellation of “faith-based gatherings of any size.”5  Indeed as one court \nobserved, \nThough the CDC has recommended public health guidance for detention facilities \n. . . these measures are inadequate to sufficiently decrease the substantial likelihood \nthat  Petitioner  will  contract  COVID-19.  As  prison  officials  are  beginning  to \nrecognize around the country, even the most stringent precautionary measures—\nshort of limiting the detained population itself—simply cannot protect detainees \nfrom the extremely high risk of contracting this unique and deadly disease. \n \nMalam v. Barr, No. 20-10829, 2020 WL 1672662, at *8 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 5, 2020), as amended \n(Apr. 6, 2020). Second, there is no doubt that the risk of exposure to COVID-19 even in the general \npublic is one to which society is unwilling to subject itself as a whole. Governors across the \ncountry, including in Illinois, have mandated social distancing and are using criminal laws to \nenforce that mandate.  \n \n4 CDC, Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and \nDetention Facilities, at 6 (Mar. 23, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\ncov/downloads/guidance-correctional-detention.pdf. \n5 CDC, Implementation of Mitigation Strategies for Communities with Local COVID-19 Transmission, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf (last visited \nApril 14, 2020) (“substantial” spread recommendations). \n  6 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 7 of 21 PageID #:1499\nAt a hearing, Plaintiffs will present testimony from Dr. Homer Venters, a correctional \nhealth expert and epidemiologist. Dr. Venters, whose CV is attached as Exhibit H, served as the \nChief Medical Officer for the New York City jail system and before that, worked for several \nyears in various other administrative positions in New York’s jail system. Dr. Venters now \nserves as the President of Community Oriented Correctional Health Services, an organization \nworking with correctional healthcare systems to improve patient services. Dr. Venters regularly \nprovides expert testimony on the topic of correctional healthcare and has extensive experience \ncreating policies and practices to respond to infectious disease outbreaks in the correctional \nsetting. \nPlaintiffs expect that Dr. Venters will testify about the pressing need for social distancing \nat the Cook County Jail to protect against rampant infection. Dr. Venters will also testify about \nthe need to triage and separate medically vulnerable detainees because of the higher level of \nmedical supervision that they required during a viral outbreak. Finally, Dr. Venters will provide \ntestimony about the various ways in which the Sheriff's policies are inadequate to protect against \nthe substantial risk of harm posed to detainees at the Jail by rampant spread of the virus. \nPlaintiffs will also present evidence from Dr. Amir Moheb Mohareb, an infectious \ndisease specialist. Dr. Mohareb completed his medical degree at Johns Hopkins University \nSchool of Medicine, his medical training at Yale-New Haven Hospital, and his infectious disease \nfellowship training in the joint program of Brigham & Women's Hospital and Massachusetts \nGeneral Hospital. He is board-certified in both Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases. A \ncopy of his CV is attached as Exhibit I. Dr. Mohareb practices at Massachusetts General Hospital \nand teaches at Harvard Medical School. Among other qualifications, Dr. Mohareb is a member \n  7 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 8 of 21 PageID #:1500\nof the Biothreats Response Team at Massachusetts General Hospital, a position which has \nrequired him to take a leading role in infection control during the current COVID-19 outbreak. \nPlaintiffs expect that Dr. Mohareb will testify about the clinical presentation of COVID-\n19, the typical course of the disease in both non-vulnerable and vulnerable populations, and the \nmethod and rates of transmission of the virus. Dr. Mohareb will also offer testimony about the \nprimary importance of social distancing in protecting against transmission of the virus, and the \nimportant, but supportive, role that hygiene and sanitization plays in protecting against \ntransmission of the virus. \n  The above expert evidence regarding COVID-19 in the Jail, which Plaintiffs touch upon \nhere and that they intend to present more fulsomely at the hearing, is confirmed by a broad and \ndeep public health consensus. More than six hundred public health officials wrote to the CDC to \nask that it explicitly call for significant reductions of the incarcerated population on the ground \nthat the current risk even assuming compliance with other CDC protocols is intolerably high.6  \nIII.  If Social Distancing Is Possible at the Current Population Levels, this Court \nShould Order it Immediately. \n \nThe Sheriff must immediately be ordered to take all possible steps to implement medically \nrequired social distancing because it is the only way to prevent a severe risk of harm. Detainees \nmay not constitutionally be exposed to a severe risk of contracting a communicable disease. Gates \nv.

Manson, 651 F.2d \n96, 109–11 (2d Cir. 1981).  \nAt this current time, it is clear that social distancing is not happening outside of intake at \nthe Jail. Declarations on behalf of detainees that were taken on April 13 and 14, and are submitted \nas Group Exhibit E, make this evident. Detainees continue to reside in dorms, sleeping in close \nproximity to others, and in cells with two people.7  Detainees also continue to share common areas, \nsinks, showers, toilets and eating areas.8 Given the current state of affairs, the question is not \n \n7   See e.g., Affidavit of Christina Lorenzo (“Lorenzo”) on Behalf of Durrell Barker (“Mr. Barker is \ncurrently residing in a two-person cell with a cellmate. He was previously in a one-person cell but then he \nreceived a cellmate on April 11, 2020.”); Aff. of Kara Crutcher on Behalf of Lonnie Sanders (“Until the \nmorning of April 14, Mr. Sanders was living in a two-person cell with another person.

As their contemporaneously filed motion for expedited discovery shows, Plaintiffs \nare seeking a minimally intrusive means to determine whether medically required social distancing \nis possible, but if it is there can be no doubt that the Sheriff must implement it immediately.   \nIV.  If Social Distancing is Impossible at the Current Population Levels, the Jail \nPopulation Must Be Reduced through Release or Habeas Corpus, or People Must \nbe Transferred to Another Safe Location in the Sheriff’s Custody.9 \n \nIf medically required social distancing is not possible, people in the jail must be transferred \n(which is not a prisoner release order under the PLRA), or the jail population must be reduced, by \nconvening a three-judge district court to hear evidence and issue a prisoner-release order, or by \ngranting habeas corpus release to sufficient numbers of the medically vulnerable so as to enable \nmedically required social distancing.  \nA. Population Density at the Jail Must be Reduced. \n \nTo show a constitutional violation in this case, Plaintiffs must show that they are being \nconfined in conditions that are “objectively unreasonable.” (Order at 16–17.)  \nIt might seem obvious that if the current population of a jail unavoidably creates intolerable \nrisk to life and health then the current population must change. But the Sheriff contends that “the \nConstitution simply cannot require that the only objectively reasonable response to the current \npandemic is for wardens across the country to be forced to open the jail doors.” (Doc. 41 at 9–10.) \nHe cites no authority for this proposition.  Because the proposition would apply regardless of the \n \nshowers and bathrooms. Detainees in the tier eat at shared picnic-style tables. People share the telephones, \nwhich are located about one foot from one another.”) (attached hereto as Group Ex. E). \n \n9   Plaintiffs incorporate all prior briefing on the Prison Litigation Reform Act, habeas corpus and \ntransfer submitted in the above-captioned case, and which are specifically referenced throughout this \nmotion.  \n  10 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 11 of 21 PageID #:1503\nrisk to the detainees, taken to its inevitable conclusion it would require that people—in this case \nlegally innocent people, charged but not convicted of crimes, and many releasable on mere \npayment of money—suffer excruciating and preventable illness and death. According to the \nSheriff, even if Plaintiffs prove that they are at an unreasonable risk of death or serious injury in \nthe jail, and even if they prove that the only way to mitigate that risk is to transfer people or reduce \nthe number of people in the jail, they still cannot obtain relief. This has it backwards. If current \npopulation levels in the Jail necessarily result in unconstitutional conditions, that does not make \nthe conditions “objectively reasonable” and therefore constitutional; it requires a change in \npopulation levels. \nThe Sheriff argues also that it cannot be objectively unreasonable to do the best that one \ncan under the circumstances—that is, if he is indeed doing his best (a point that Plaintiffs dispute \nat least prior to this Court’s intervention) to keep people safe in the jail, an injunction cannot issue. \n(Doc. 41 at 9-10) This is not the law. The law does not require the Sheriff to be a bad person or to \nbe responsible for the overcrowded jail in order to be ordered to cease confining people in unlawful \nand dangerous conditions.  In Brown v. Plata, the Supreme Court confirmed that where the prison \npopulation is such that reduction is the only way to cure a constitutional violation, an injunction \nmay issue even if the defendant’s affirmative conduct did not cause the overcrowding. 563 U.S. \n493, 521, 526–29 (2011) (noting that prisoner-release order was appropriate because adequate care \nwas “impossible” without a reduction). If it were true that doing one’s best under the circumstances \nmeant that there could be no constitutional violation—under the Eighth amendment, let alone the \nFourteenth—then Brown’s conclusion that non-release measures were “impossible” would have \nended that case.  But the plaintiffs in Brown won. \n  11 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 12 of 21 PageID #:1504\nThis principle is illustrated by the leading precedent in this area.  In a case seeking \ninjunctive relief, the question is whether at the time the relief would issue the Plaintiffs state a \nConstitutional violation. See Helling, 509 U.S. at 36 (“[T]he subjective factor . . . should be \ndetermined in light of the prison authorities’ current attitudes and conduct.”). If the Sheriff were \ntold that a bomb or a gas line were about to explode in the jail in several days, it would make no \nsense to say that the Constitution has not been violated because up to that point there was nothing \nthe Sheriff could have done to prevent the harm; at that point, the moment before the explosion—\nthe Court may order the Sheriff to get people out of the jail. The Supreme Court explained that \neven the more restrictive deliberate-indifference standard follows this “common sense” notion: \nIf, for example, the evidence before a district court establishes that an inmate faces \nan objectively intolerable risk of serious injury, the defendants could not plausibly \npersist in claiming lack of awareness, any more than prison officials who state \nduring  the  litigation  that  they  will  not  take  reasonable  measures  to  abate  an \nintolerable risk of which they are aware could claim to be subjectively blameless \nfor purposes of the Eighth Amendment, and in deciding whether an inmate has \nestablished a continuing constitutional violation a district court may take such \ndevelopments into account.  \n \nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 846 n.9 (1994).    \nMoney v. Pritzker, Case No. 20-cv-2093, 2020 WL 1820660 (N.D. Ill. April 10, 2020), \ndoes not counsel a different result than this Supreme Court precedent. There, the Court considered \na request for population reduction in the Illinois Department of Corrections owing to the risks \nposed by COVID-19. The Court concluded that plaintiffs had not shown “deliberate indifference” \nto an unconstitutional risk of serious harm because numerous measures were being implemented \nsuch that there was no factual showing of an immediate intolerable risk to the plaintiffs’ health \nand lives. Id. at *17–18.10  Most importantly, Money did not have the benefit of an evidentiary \n \n10   To the extent it makes a difference, in this case, the lesser standard of “objectively unreasonable” \nconditions applies to Plaintiffs’ claims because they are pretrial detainees. It should be noted that forcing \n  12 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 13 of 21 PageID #:1505\nrecord that establishes that the only way to mitigate medically intolerable serious risk of infection \nwas social distancing.  Such distancing should be ordered here to reduce that risk, and if the current \npopulation requires unconstitutional conditions of confinement, the population must change.  \nMoney does not hold otherwise.  Moreover, the Money plaintiffs, unlike Plaintiffs here, did not \nrequest improved conditions in the facilities to prevent an outbreak; their request, unlike Plaintiffs’ \nhere, was interpreted by the court as one for immediate release and, therefore, the Money Court \ncould not address the question whether continuing to jail people in conditions that threaten their \nlives after lesser steps have been implemented or are impossible violates the Constitution. Id. at \n*12–13. Moreover, Money considered the case at a time when an outbreak had not already \nthreatened the lives of many people inside the facility; here, three people are already dead because \nof this virus. It is within that context and in a facility that is the largest known site of outbreak in \nthe United States, that Plaintiffs’ expert testimony and legal argument is before this Court.   \na.  Habeas Corpus \nPlaintiff Kenneth Foster, by his next friend, seeks emergency release from the Jail pursuant \nto a Section 2241 writ of habeas corpus because Mr. Foster has multiple health problems that place \nhim at elevated risk of contracting serious COVID 19, making his continued detention in the Jail \nobjectively unreasonable.  Mr. Foster seeks this relief on behalf of himself and on behalf of those \nmembers of subclass A who, in addition to having health vulnerabilities that elevate their risk of \nserious COVID 19, also, like Mr. Foster, sought release from the Jail pursuant to the procedure \nestablished by Cook County Criminal Court Chief Judge Leroy K. Martin, Jr. by order dated March \n23, 2020 and were denied.   \n \nsomeone to remain confined after a serious and intolerable risk to their life is proven would likely meet \neither standard. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 846 & n.9. \n  13 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 14 of 21 PageID #:1506\nThe court’s April 9 order concluded that Plaintiff Foster and the subclass he provisionally \nrepresents are not entitled to habeas relief because Mr. Foster presented no evidence that he and \nthe class had attempted to initiate the emergency procedure established by Judge Martin.  See \nOrder at 13.  The undersigned counsel has subsequently learned that, in fact, Mr. Foster did seek \nrelease in the Circuit Court of Cook County under the Judge Martin procedure. Group Ex. F to this \nmotion includes a motion to reduce bail, filed with the Circuit Court in Mr. Foster’s case on March \n30.  Mr. Foster is charged with robbery, domestic battery and unlawful restraint.  Bail is set at \n$50,000 and he remains in the Jail because he does not have $5000 to pay bond.  The motion to \nreduce bond sets forth Mr. Foster’s medical vulnerabilities (¶¶ 5-8) and explains that those \nvulnerabilities place him particularly at risk within the Jail in light of the pandemic (¶¶ 27-28).  \nThe motion specifically alleges that Mr. Foster’s constitutional right to objectively reasonable \nconditions of confinement in violation of the principles enunciated in Helling v. McKinney, 509 \nU.S. 25, 33-34 (1993).  See Ex. F at ¶¶ 29-31. The motion was heard by Judge Joyce and was \ndenied on April 2.  See Ex. F. \nThe Public Defender has informed the undersigned counsel that Mr. Foster’s petition was \none of 1193 cases that her office presented for review pursuant to Judge Martin’s procedure and \nthat release was granted in 719 cases—leaving over 470 cases in which the defendant sought \nrelease but was denied.  See Declaration of Locke E. Bowman Ex. B hereto) at ¶ 3.  Counsel are \ninformed and believe that the petitioner-defendant in a significant number of those cases suffers \nfrom an underlying health condition that makes them vulnerable to the coronavirus.  The Sheriff \npossesses information that can confirm this belief.  Class wide treatment of this habeas claim is \ntherefore appropriate. \n  14 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 15 of 21 PageID #:1507\nAs Plaintiffs have acknowledged elsewhere, Illinois law provides a right of appeal from a \ntrial court’s refusal to modify bond.  See Ill. S. Ct. Rule 604(c).  But that remedy would require \nweeks to pursue, as the declaration of the Public Defender’s Chief of Staff, Lester Finkle, (attached \nas Ex. C) makes clear.  Plaintiffs have argued elsewhere that such time frames render appellate \nremedies  practically  unavailable  in  the  context  of  the  present  emergency.    See  Plaintiffs’ \nSupplemental Br. in Support of TRO (Doc. No. 42) at 13-16.  Those arguments are incorporated \nby reference here.  This court should find, under the circumstances, that exhaustion must be \nexcused, either because it would be futile or by application of the court’s equitable authority to \nexcuse exhaustion in Section 2241 cases.  See generally Gonzalez v. O’Connell, 355 F.3d 1010, \n1016 (7th Cir. 2004). \nMr. Foster is entitled to a writ of habeas corpus based on the totality of the evidence before \nthe court as to the unacceptable risk he faces within the Jail of contracting a life-altering, \npotentially fatal illness.  Mr. Foster suffers from a number of chronic illnesses that elevate his risk, \nincluding a history of stomach cancer (for which he was scheduled to begin chemotherapy at the \ntime of his arrest), chronic kidney disease and high blood pressure, among others.  See Ex. __ at ¶ \n5.  He has a home to which he could return, where he would live alone and would not be a threat \nto the personal safety of any person.  See Bowman Dec. at ¶ 4.  It is appropriate to grant habeas \ncorpus relief to a confined person in order to remove that individual from unacceptable conditions \nof confinement.  Compare, e.g., Robinson v. Sherrod, 631 F.3d 839, 840–41 (7th Cir. 2011), with \nGlaus v. Anderson, 408 F.3d 382, 387 (7th Cir. 2005); see also TRO Order at 14–15.  \nThe same relief is appropriate for each member of the class identified in this motion.  Every \nmember of this class faces the same unacceptable risk of serious illness or death because of their \nheightened vulnerability to the coronavirus and every member of the class faces that risk because \n  15 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 16 of 21 PageID #:1508\nof the impossibility of social distancing within the Jail and the exorbitant risk of infection in the \nJail environment.  These common factual and legal issues should therefore be addressed on a class \nwide basis. \nPlaintiffs acknowledge that the court will need to individually assess the conditions under \nwhich each individual class member should be released, consistent with public safety concerns \nseparate from the spread of the coronavirus.  After adjudication of the class wide issues, such \nindividual questions may be taken up by the parties and the court on a case-by-case basis. \nb.  Transfer \nThis Court, sitting as a single judge, may order that Dart transfer prisoners to a safe facility \nor form of custody of his choosing. As Plaintiffs’ response to the Court’s April 3 Order makes \nclear (Doc. No. 26-1) at 17-25, an order that prisoners be transferred to receive adequate medical \ncare or to be removed from areas where they would be exposed to deadly diseases is not a “prisoner \nrelease order” within the meaning of the PLRA and, therefore, may be issued by a single-judge \ncourt. See Plata v. Brown, No. C01-1351 TEH, 2013 WL 3200587, at *8 (N.D. Cal. June 24, 2013) \n(granting motion requiring transfer from area at high risk of coccidioidomycosis, known as “Valley \nFever”); Reaves v. Dep’t of Correction, 404 F. Supp. 3d 520, 523 (D. Mass. 2019) (three judge \npanel was not required for order of transfer of quadriplegic prisoner to another facility in which he \nwould be treated by a physician with training to care for his substantial and numerous medical \nneeds, as remedy for defendants’ failure to provide adequate medical care). This is true under the \nPrison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), even if the Sheriff transfers detainees to forms of custody \noutside of traditional prison buildings. See Jackson v. Johnson, 475 F.3d 261, 265-66 (5th Cir. \n2007) (holding that a person subjected to confinement in a halfway house counts as a “prisoner” \nunder the PLRA ) (“[A]lthough Jackson has been released from confinement in prison, his release \n  16 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 17 of 21 PageID #:1509\nwas not to the general public but was rather to a different form of confinement, albeit with certain \nadditional liberties. It is clear that Jackson is being ‘detained in any facility’ since he is locked up \nin the halfway house 16 to 24 hours a day and since he may leave the halfway house only for very \nlimited purposes.” (citing Witzke v. Femal, 376 F.3d 744, 752 (7th Cir. 2004) (determining that \nhalfway-house resident who could leave the facility only during the day and was locked inside at \nnight was confined for PLRA purposes)). Under the PLRA, a “prison” is a “Federal, State, or local \nfacility that incarcerates or detains.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(5). As Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Brief \nfurther elucidates (Doc. No. 42 at 17-19), Plaintiffs are not asking that they be sent anywhere other \nthan a safe facility that incarcerates them—that is a place that “confin[es]” them, see Black’s Law \nDictionary, Incarceration (11th ed. 2019) —and, therefore, they do not seek a “prisoner release \norder” under the PLRA.11   \nc.  Release \nFinally, if this Court concludes that social distancing is medically required to reasonably \nprevent transmission of the virus and that this social distancing is likely impossible under current \nconditions, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court immediately convene a three-judge panel \npursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3626(a)(3)(A).  \nTo convene a three-judge district court, this Court must (a) have “previously entered an \norder for less intrusive relief that has failed to remedy the deprivation of the Federal right sought \nto be remedied”; and (b) that the Court give the Defendant a “reasonable time” to comply with the \nprior order to determine whether compliance will cure the constitutional violation. Id. “[W]hat is \n \n11   The district court in Gray v. County of Riverside, No. 13 C 0444, Dkt. 191 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 14, \n2020), recently recognized that an order directing a sheriff to transfer detainees to a safer location is not a \n\"prisoner release order\" and therefore not subject to the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3). See Ex. \nK (Order Granting Emergency Motion to Enforce Consent Decree) at 4-5. \n \n  17 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 18 of 21 PageID #:1510\nreasonable in ordinary times may be quite different from what is reasonable in these extraordinary \ntimes.” Coleman v. Newsome, No. 01-CV-01351-JST, 2020 WL 1675775, at *4 n. 9 (E.D. Cal. \nApr. 4, 2020) (three-judge court). \nMuch of what comes next depends on the Office of the Sheriff.  If the Sheriff contends that \nsocial distancing of the kind required by medical science (which the Sheriff appears to have \nimplemented  at  intake,  see  Doc.  51-2)  is  possible  throughout  the  facility  with  the  current \npopulation at the physical 2600 S. California facility, then this Court should order that, an \nemergency three-judge panel need not be convened, and Plaintiffs should be given a chance to \ndiscover on an expedited basis the extent to which Defendant’s contention is true.  \nIf,  however,  the  Sheriff  contends  that  the  Office  is  doing  its  best  under  difficult \ncircumstances but that, for whatever reason, such social distancing is not immediately possible \nwith the current jail population, no further time is reasonable to comply.  By definition, further \ntime will not yield compliance and will not lead to constitutionally tolerable conditions.  At that \npoint, release will be the only remaining option to save the lives and health of potentially thousands \nof people, and so Plaintiffs would request that a tribunal statutorily empowered to order release be \nconvened as quickly as possible to hear evidence on whether the current population at the jail is \nindeed the source of constitutional violations, and to determine whether release is necessary. See, \ne.g., Coleman, 2020 WL 1675775, at *4 n. 9.  Should the tribunal be unable to be convened within \nthe time period necessary to avert disaster under prevailing scientific reality, then that narrow \nprocedural component of the PLRA would be unconstitutional because it would prevent the \nemergency  vindication  of  essential  constitutional  rights,  and  this  Court  should  order  such \nemergency relief until such time as the tribunal can convene. Cf. See, e.g., Plata, , 2013 WL \n  18 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 19 of 21 PageID #:1511\n3200587 at *8 (rejecting interpretation of the PLRA because it “would prevent vindication of the \ninmates’ constitutional rights and would therefore be impermissible”).  \nB.  Limited Discovery Is Necessary and Appropriate as to the Relief Requested. \n  The court should also afford Plaintiffs an opportunity to conduct limited discovery on an \nexpedited basis in advance of a hearing on their requests. Although the commencement of formal \ndiscovery typically awaits the completion of the parties’ Rule 26(f) conference, the court’s ability \nto control the timing and sequencing of discovery has been interpreted to allow the entry of an \norder  to  expedite  the  discovery  process—particularly  where  the  plaintiff  seeks  preliminary \ninjunctive relief.  See, e.g., Ellsworth Associates, Inc. v. United States, 917 F. Supp. 841, 844 (D. \nD.C. 1996); Revlon Consumer Products Corp. v. Jennifer Leather Broadway, Inc., 858 F. Supp. \n1268, 1269 (S.D.N.Y. 1994); Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago v. Hicks, 1990 WL 16298 (N.D. \nIll. Jan. 26, 1990). To obtain expedited discovery, the requesting party must establish “good \ncause,” generally interpreted to mean that the need for discovery outweighs the prejudice to the \nresponding party. Share Corp. Momar, Inc. 2010 WL 724321 (E.D. Wis. Feb. 26, 2010). \nPlaintiffs seek to leave to expedite three items of discovery: (1) Plaintiffs seek entry into \nthe Jail for their designated medical/public health expert and, in the course of that view, the \nopportunity to photograph and to take video of selected conditions; (2) Plaintiffs seek depositions, \nlimited to three hours, of Dr. Connie Menella, the Chair of Correctional Health at Cook County \nHospital, whose declaration the Sheriff filed in response to relief in this case and as part of the \nSheriff’s status on compliance with the TRO, and of Michael Miller, the Jail’s First Assistant \nExecutive Director whose declaration the Sheriff filed in opposition to relief in this case; and (3) \nthe opportunity to propound a narrow set of document production requests seeking the identity and \n  19 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 20 of 21 PageID #:1512\nlocation of the members of subclass A and ongoing data regarding the spread of the coronavirus \nin the Jail, among other things. This proposed discovery is attached as Exhibit A.   \nThere is “good cause” for this discovery.  The court has held that Plaintiffs are entitled to \na TRO with respect to certain aspects of the Jail’s response to the pandemic, as to which there is \nevidence of inadequacy. Plaintiffs have proffered new evidence further supporting their very \nurgent claim that the lives of members of the plaintiff classes are being unnecessarily placed at \nrisk by further inadequacies of the Jail’s coronavirus response—in particular, the failure to \nmandate social distancing and the failure to identify and triage medically vulnerable detainees.  \nThe limited discovery Plaintiffs seek is necessary to enable the Plaintiffs to present evidence to \nthe court in the emergency hearing that Plaintiffs seek on their second preliminary injunction \nmotion. \nPlaintiff recognize that the Jail is in crisis; that there is a shortage of staff because of illness, \nincluding confirmed and suspected coronavirus cases among Jail staff; and that these are trying \ntimes for all of us.  With this in mind, Plaintiffs have narrowly circumscribed their discovery \nrequests so as to intrude only minimally on the Jail.  Balancing the need for discovery against the \nprejudice caused to the Sheriff, the court should conclude that there is “good cause” to expedite \ndiscovery and to grant this motion in its entirety. \n  WHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  request  that  this  Court  grant  their  renewed  motion  for  a \nPreliminary Injunction and for limited, expedited discovery. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  20 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 21 of 21 PageID #:1513\nRespectfully submitted, \n  \n/s/ Alexa A.

BOWMAN \n \n1.  I am attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Illinois and one of the \ncounsel for the plaintiff class in this litigation. \n2.  On April 7, 2020, I exchanged emails with Amy P. Campanelli, Pubic Defender \nof Cook County, and Lester Finkle, her Chief of Staff, regarding the results the Public Defender \nhad on the motions that the office brought pursuant to an order entered by Circuit Court of Cook \nCounty Chief Judge Leroy K. Martin, Jr. regarding the availability of expedited procedures to \nreconsider bond for detainees in the Cook County Jail in light of the coronavirus pandemic. \n3.  Ms. Campanelli reported to me that the office presented 1070 cases for expedited \nreview pursuant to the Judge Martin order at the criminal courthouse at 26th Street and \nCalifornia Avenue and that 123 such cases were presented at the Markham courthouse.  Release \nwas granted in 673 Chicago cases and 46 Markham cases, yielding totals of 1193 cases \nconsidered and 719 releases granted.  Thus, release was denied in 472 cases in which the \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55-2 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 3 of 3 PageID #:1522\ndefendant sought release pursuant to Judge Martin’s expedited procedure for reconsidering bond \nin light of the coronavirus pandemic. \n4.  On April 14, I spoke with Judia Jackson, next friend of Plaintiff Kenneth Foster in \nthis litigation.  Ms. Jackson informed me that, prior to his arrest, Mr. Foster had made \narrangements to live at 4428 W. Wilcox in Chicago, in the first floor apartment (unit 1).  That \nbuilding is owned by Sheldon Dabney, who is a close personal friend of Ms. Jackson.  The \nbuilding is now vacant.  Mr. Foster had agreed to assist Mr. Dabney by acting as a handyman \nand caretaker for the property in Mr. Dabney’s absence.  Mr. Foster is welcome to live at the \nproperty, as previously arranged, should Mr. Foster be released from the Jail. \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information I have provided is true and \ncorrect to the best of my knowledge, information, memory, and belief. \n \nApril 14, 2020          \nChicago, Illinois        ___/s/ Locke E.

Robert Gettleman \n  Defendant-Respondent.    )  Presiding Judge \n \nDECLARATION OF LESTER FINKLE \n \n1.  I am an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Illinois.  I have spent my \nentire professional career since graduation from law school in 1982 engaged in the practice of \ncriminal law in Cook County, Illinois. I am currently Chief of Staff to Cook County Public \nDefender Amy P. Campanelli.  I am very familiar with the practice of criminal law, not only in \nterms of the applicable rules, statutes and case authority, but also in terms of the realities on the \nground in Cook County and the application of the rules and standards in practice. \n2.  Illinois Supreme Court Rule 604(c) provides for a right of interlocutory appeal \nfrom denials of a trial court’s refusal to modify bail or the conditions thereof.  The interlocutory \nappeal authorized by Rule 604(c) must be preceded by a verified motion in the trial court setting \nforth five specified items of information about the defendant.  Upon denial by the trial court of \nsuch a verified motion, the defendant may file a “verified motion for review” in the Illinois \nAppellate Court, setting forth the ruling below, the crimes charged, the “amount and condition of \nbail,” and the arguments in support of relief.  Id.  The State has an opportunity to answer the \nmotion, but is not required to do so. \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55-3 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 3 of 3 PageID #:1525\n3.  Upon denial by the Appellate Court, the defendant has the right to seek \ndiscretionary review in the Illinois Supreme Court via a petition for leave to appeal. \n4.  The Cook County Public Defender does not routinely file motions for review in \nthe Appellate Court pursuant to Rule 604(c).  In certain cases, however, our Office has filed such \nmotions.  I am therefore generally aware of the process and, in particular, the time frames that \nare involved in litigating a 604(c) appeal.   \n5.  In my experience, the time from denial of a motion to reconsider bond in the trial \ncourt to decision on a verified motion for review under Rule 604(c) by the Illinois Appellate \nCourt is measured in weeks.  It typically takes approximately two to four weeks from denial of a \nbond reconsideration motion to the ruling from the Appellate Court in such cases.   \n6.  In my experience generally, the process of filing a motion for leave to appeal with \nthe Illinois Supreme Court and obtaining that court’s decision on whether to accept a case takes \nat least four to six weeks.  When the Illinois Supreme Court accepts a case for review, the \nprocess to decision lasts for months, at least. \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information I have provided is true and \ncorrect to the best of my knowledge, information, memory, and belief. \n \nApril 6, 2020          /s/  \nChicago, Illinois        _______________________________________ \n                Lester Finkle \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55-4 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 1 of 8 PageID #:1526\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT D \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55-4 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 2 of 8 PageID #:1527\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS \nEASTERN DIVISION \n \nANTHONY MAYS, et al.,      )   \n            ) \n  Plaintiffs-Petitioners,     ) \n            )   Case No. 20-cv-2134 \nv.        ) \n            )   The Hon.

I am over the age of eighteen and am fully competent to make this declaration. I \nmake this declaration based upon personal knowledge unless otherwise indicated. \n2.  I am an attorney at the law firm of Loevy & Loevy. On April 13, 2020, my firm \nobtained the COVID-19 Incarceration Model published by Recidiviz, a non-profit technology \ncompany that builds open-source data platforms to assess outcomes in criminal justice systems, \nby visiting Recidiviz’s website at: https://www.recidiviz.org/covid. \n3.  The COVID-19 Incarceration Model (the Model) is an interactive model that \nprovides an estimated projection of the impact of COVID-19 within correctional facilities like \nthe Cook County Jail. \n4.  The Model specifically provides projections regarding the likely number of \nindividuals who are infectious over time, the likely number of individuals who are currently \nexposed over time, the likely number of individuals requiring hospitalization over time, and the \nlikely number of fatalities. It further provides projections regarding the total number of cases in \nboth the detained and staff populations, the total number of hospitalizations in both the detained \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55-4 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 3 of 8 PageID #:1528\nand staff populations, and the peak percentage of hospital beds from the community that will be \nutilized by COVID-19 infected individuals traced to the Jail. \n5.  Those projections vary based on the amount of social distancing that is enforced \nat the Jail, leading to a change in the rate of spread that is quantified in the Model. The Model \nprovides three modes regarding the rate of spread: (a) High (very little social distancing), (b) \nModerate (some social distancing), and (c) Low (substantial social distancing). The formulas \nemployed by the Model to arrive at its projections are set forth in the “Calculation Data” tab in \nthe Model. \n6.  The Model’s predictions are based on a large amount of national data, including, \namong others, statistics from the CDC regarding the periods of incubation, contagion, and \ninfection, recovery times, hospitalization and mild case rates, and mortality rates. The Model \nalso bases its predictions on data regarding the rate of spread in high, medium, and low spread \nsettings. The data used by the Model are set forth in the “Variables” tab in the Model. \n7.  The Model permits the user to edit the inputs based on the most recent data \navailable. Accordingly, under my direction, staff at my firm and law students at Northwestern \nLaw School worked to collect the most recent information regarding Cook County-specific data, \nincluding, among others, the total number of hospital and ICU beds in the county, the number of \nCOVID-19 cases and fatalities in the county, the current population and capacity of the Cook \nCounty Jail, the current number of staff at the Jail, and the current number of reported cases at \nthe Jail by detainees and staff. The source of that data is reflected in rows 49-56 on the \n“Variables” tab in the Model, and is inputted in the “Jail and Prison Data” tab, as well as the \n“Inputs” tab in the Model. \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55-4 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 4 of 8 PageID #:1529\n8.  After inputting the data collected, the Model predicts that with a “High” rate of \nspread (i.e., no social distancing), 3,880 detainees and 2,954 staff will contract COVID-19, \nleading to a peak hospital bed utilization rate of 5.3%. The Model predicts that with a “Low” rate \nof spread (i.e., substantial social distancing), 2,968 detainees and 2,341 staff will contract \nCOVID-19, leading to a peak hospital bed utilization rate of 3.2%. The Model’s outputs under \nthese scenarios are attached to this declaration in PDF format. \n9.  I provided the Model to Gregg Gonsalves, who reviewed the data and calculations \nused to generate the Model’s output. Professor Gonsalves’s discussion of the Model is set forth \nin paragraph 28 of his declaration, and Professor Gonsalves is prepared to answer questions \nabout the Model, including the assumptions upon which it relies, and the accuracy and \nlimitations of its projections. \n10.  Immediately after the filing of Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction, I will \ntransmit a copy of the Model in its native Excel format to the Court’s proposed order box, \ncopying counsel for all parties. \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \nExecuted on April 14, 2020 in Chicago, Illinois. \n \n \n \n \nSarah Grady \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55-4 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 5 of 8 PageID #:1530\n \n \n \nAttachment 1 \nCOVID-19 Incarceration Model Output \nUtilizing the “High” Rate of Spread \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55-4 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 6 of 8 PageID #:1531\nCOVID-19 Incarceration Model\n4/3/2020\nOur understanding of the virus is evolving daily; for the most up-to-date model, download the \nlatest version from recidiviz.org/covid\nWhat is this?\nThis is an interactive model to allow criminal justice leaders and their staff to project the likely impact of COVID-19 \nwithin facilities.

I am a volunteer investigator at the Chicago Community Bond \nFund assisting Plaintiffs’ counsel in Mays v. Dart. On April 13, I spoke to Durell Barker, a \ndetainee in the Cook County Jail, who provided me the following information. \n \n1.  Mr. Barker is 36 years old. He is residing in Division 10 (DIV10-2B-2122-2) of the Cook \nCounty Jail. He is incarcerated on a no bond order. He has been in the Jail since October \n22, 2019. \n \n2.  Mr. Barker has asthma, sickle cell trait and acute bronchitis. He is not receiving \nmedication. \n \n3.  Mr. Barker is currently residing in a two-person cell with a cellmate. He was previously \nin a one-person cell but then he received a cellmate on April 11, 2020. \n \n4.  Mr. Barker’s tier is not on lockdown. They are letting 7 to 10 people out of their cells at a \ntime, though sometimes everyone on the tier is let out at the same time. This does not \nmake sense to Mr. Barker if the Jail is trying to social distance the detainees.  \n \n5.  Social distancing is not possible in the tier. Everyone on the tier shares the shower area \nand the phone, which are close together. They also share common areas.  \n \n6.  People around Mr. Barker are visibly sick. Staff have not come around the tier to take \npeople’s temperatures.  \n \n7.  There are no grievance slips on the tier. Jail staff claim they have no slips to hand out. \n \n8.  Mr. Barker has not received cleaning supplies for his cell or the common areas. Mr. \nBarker receives one tiny and thin bar of soap per week.  \n \n9.  Mr. Barker received a mask for the first time on April 12. \n \n10. Mr. Barker has not seen a counselor for 2-3 weeks. \n \n \nI am providing this hearsay declaration because of restrictions on visitors and contact with \ndetainees in the Cook County Jail.

I am a volunteer investigator at the Chicago Community Bond \nFund assisting Plaintiffs’ counsel in Mays v. Dart. On April 13, 2020, I spoke to Ricardo \nHargrove, a detainee in the Cook County Jail, who provided me the following information. \n \n \n1.  Mr. Hargrove resides in Division 11 (Div11-DA-201-1).  \n \n2.  Mr. Hargrove has kidney problems and bronchitis. He is not receiving medication.  \n \n3.  Mr. Hargrove believes his unit is under quarantine; 6 people have been removed from it \nwith COVID-19 symptoms. \n \n4.  On April 13, Mr. Hargrove saw one detainee get taken out of his cell.  He was so sick he \ncould barely walk.  This detainee’s cellmate was left back in the cell; Mr. Hargrove did \nnot see the cellmate receive cleaning supplies. \n \n5.  Mr. Hargrove estimates that there are currently 48 people on his tier.  They are allowed \nout into the common area 6 cells at a time. \n \n6.  The detainees use a shared shower area.  They can use the shared shower area when they \nare allowed out of their cells to use the phones. \n \n7.  The detainees have been given a mix of soap and water and have been told that it is hand \nsanitizer. \n \n8.  The detainees have not been given cleaning supplies.  Mr. Hargrove has not seen the \ntier’s common areas get cleaned at all. \n \n9.  Mr. Hargrove believes he may have COVID-19.  Jail staff tested his cellmate on April 3 \nand removed him the same day.  When they did so Mr. Hargrove begged for cleaning \nsupplies, but was not given any. \n \n10. Since then, Mr. Hargrove has had shakes, fever, and a bad cough.  He also has hot \nflashes, and his eyes have been red, but he has not been tested.  \n \nI am providing this hearsay declaration because of restrictions on visitors and contact with \ndetainees in the Cook County Jail.

Mr. Arroyo resides in Division 8, in a Residential Treatment Unit (“RTU”) tier 4G. \n \n2.  Mr. Arroyo is on blood pressure medicine and blood thinner.  He is a diabetic.  He has \ndifficulty breathing, and was on a ventilator before being admitted to the jail (admitted to \njail March 1, 2020). \n \n3.  There are 38 beds in Mr. Arroyo’s tier.  He estimates that 30 are being used.  The beds \nare not far apart and social distancing is not possible. \n \n4.  Everyone on Mr. Arroyo’s tier was given a bar of soap several days ago, but the soap is \nsingle-use, very small.   \n \n5.  He was shot in the chest near the heart area four years ago, and takes a medication called \nMetropol, 25mg, for the resulting condition. \n \nI am providing this hearsay declaration because of restrictions on visitors and contact with \ndetainees in the Cook County Jail.

Some people were taken off the tier because they were sick. \n \n4.  The tier has 4 showers and 4 bathroom stalls. \n \n5.  The tier’s day room is crammed.  Social distancing is impossible. \n \n6.  Detainees got soap 4-5 days ago.  Each bar of soap is the size of a debit card.  Mr. \nZabrzenski used this soap to wash two pairs of socks, which expended it. \n \n7.  The dorm is cleaned by one person who volunteered to do so.  This happens once a day, \nor sometimes twice.  There is no other cleaning happening. \n \n8.  Staff generally wear masks, and yesterday the detainees were given masks.  They are \nsurgical masks, and the detainees do not know how to wear them. \n \n9.  There has been little information about COVID-19 provided to the detainees—instead \nthey get their information from local news broadcasts.   \n \n10. Detainees in the RTU have had to argue with staff to get other detainees tested, even \nwhen they are running high fevers. \n \n11. Detainees who are sick with COVID-19 symptoms are removed, but nobody knows what \nhappens to them.   \n \n \nI am providing this hearsay declaration because of restrictions on visitors and contact with \ndetainees in the Cook County Jail.

GONSALVES, upon my personal knowledge, and in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1746, declare as follows: \n \n1.  I am an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Medicine and School of Public Health. I \nhave worked at the schools of medicine and public health since 2017. Attached as Exhibit \nA is my CV.  \n \n2.  COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome \ncoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a virus closely related to the SARS virus. In its least \nserious form, COVID-19 can cause illness including fever, cough, and shortness of \nbreath. However, for individuals who become more seriously ill, a common complication \nis bilateral interstitial pneumonia, which causes partial or total collapse of the lung \nalveoli, making it difficult or impossible for patients to breathe. Thousands of patients \nhave required hospital-grade respirators, and COVID-19 can progress from a fever to \nlife-threatening pneumonia with what are known as “ground-glass opacities,” a lung \nabnormality that inhibits breathing. \n \n3.  In about 16% of cases of COVID-19, illness is severe including pneumonia with \nrespiratory failure, septic shock, multi organ failure, and even death.  \n \n4.  Certain populations of people are at particular risk of contracting severe cases of COVID-\n19. People over the age of fifty are at higher risk, with those over seventy at serious risk. \nAs the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has advised, certain medical conditions \nincrease the risk of serious COVID-19 for people of any age. These medical conditions \ninclude: those with lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, blood disorders, chronic liver or \nkidney disease, inherited metabolic disorders, developmental delays, those who are \nimmunocompromised (such as from cancer, HIV, autoimmune diseases), those who have \nsurvived strokes, and those who are pregnant.1 \n \n5.  There is no vaccine against COVID-19 and there is no known cure. No one is immune. \nThe only known effective measures to prevent injuries or deaths resulting from COVID-\n19 are to prevent individuals from being infected with the virus. In fact, young and \nhealthy individuals may be more susceptible than originally thought. New data from the \nCDC show that up to one-fifth of infected people ages 20-44 have been hospitalized, \nincluding 2%-4% who required treatment in an intensive care unit.2 \n \n                                                 \n1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): People Who May Be at \nHigher Risk for Severe Illness, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-\ncomplications.html (last accessed Mar. 18, 2020). \n2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Severe Outcomes Among Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 \n(COVID-19) — United States, February 12–March 16, 2020 (Mar. 26, 2020), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm?s_cid=mm6912e2_w  \nSharon Begley, New analysis breaks down age-group risk for coronavirus — and shows millennials are not \ninvincible (March 18, 2020) \nhttps://www.statnews.com/2020/03/18/coronavirus-new-age-analysis-of-risk-confirms-young-adults-not-invincible/   \n  1 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55-7 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 3 of 8 PageID #:1564\n6.  The number of people infected is growing exponentially. The death toll in, for instance, \nthe nation of Italy, which began experiencing this epidemic about a week earlier than the \nfirst diagnosed American cases, rose by 30% overnight in the 24 hours between March 5, \n2020 and March 6, 2020.3 On March 17, 2020, Italy reported 345 new coronavirus deaths \nin the previous 24 hours, an increase in the death toll of 16%.4   \n \n7.  Similar rapid growth has occurred in the United States. Though testing has been limited, \nas of the beginning of March, a limited number of cases had been discovered in the \nUnited States and few deaths had been reported. Today, more than half a million cases \nhave been discovered in the United States and more than 20,000 people have died.5 Ten \nthousand of those deaths have occurred in New York state in the past 30 days.6 \n \n8.  Without effective public health interventions, a COVID-19 response team at the Imperial \nCollege in the United Kingdom projected 2.2 million or more deaths in the United \nStates.7  \n \n9.  For all people, even in advanced countries with very effective health care systems, the \ncase fatality rate of COVID-19 is about ten fold higher than that observed from a severe \nseasonal influenza. In the more vulnerable groups, both the need for care, including \nintensive care, and death is much higher than we observe from influenza infection. In the \nhighest risk populations, the case fatality rate is about 15%. For high risk patients who do \nnot die from COVID-19, a prolonged recovery is expected to be required, including the \nneed for extensive rehabilitation for profound deconditioning, loss of digits, neurologic \ndamage, and loss of respiratory capacity that can be expected from such a severe illness.  \n \n10. Based on data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health \nOrganization, and National Center for Biotechnology Information on the speed at which \nSARS-CoV-2 has spread since it is first known to have infected a human in November \n2019, the virus is estimated to be twice as contagious as influenza.8 Unlike influenza, \nthere are no known vaccines or antiviral medications to prevent or treat infection from \nCOVID-19. Because the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is passed through respiratory \ndroplets and also appears to be able to survive on inanimate surfaces, it can be \ntransmitted even when an infected person is no longer in the immediate vicinity. Data \nfrom China indicates that the average infected person passes the virus on to 2-3 other \n                                                 \n3 Worldometer, Italy, https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/ (last accessed Mar. 26, 2020). \n4 Id. \n5 Johns Hopkins, Coronavirus Resource Center, https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map (last accessed April 13, 2020).  \n6 The COVID Tracking Project, New York State, https://covidtracking.com/data/state/new-york (last accessed April \n13, 2020). \n7 Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team, Impact of non-pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) to reduce \nCOVID-19 mortality and healthcare demand (Mar. 16, 2020), https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-\ncollege/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf. \n8 Brian Resnick & Christina Animashaun, Why Covid-19 is worse than the flu, in one chart, Vox (Mar. 18, 2020), \nhttps://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/3/18/21184992/coronavirus-covid-19-flu-comparison-chart.  \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55-7 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 4 of 8 PageID #:1565\npeople at distances of 3-6 feet.9 Everyone is at risk of infection because our immune \nsystems have never been exposed to or developed protective responses against this virus.  \n \n11. The current estimated incubation period of COVID-19 is between 2 and 14 days, \nmeaning that a patient who begins showing symptoms today may have been contagious \nfor as long as two weeks prior. The time course of the disease once symptoms appear can \nbe very rapid. A patient’s condition can seriously deteriorate in as little as five days \n(perhaps sooner) following initial detection of symptoms. The current estimated rate for \nlife-threatening complications is approximately 20%, with a fatality rate estimated at \nbetween 1% and 5%. All of these risk assessment numbers, however, appear to be rising. \n \n12. It is clear that, currently, the numbers of people diagnosed reflect only a portion of those \nlikely infected; very few people have been tested, and many are asymptomatic, so they do \nnot even know they should be tested. As a result, thousands of people are likely living \nday to day and carrying a potentially fatal disease that is easily transmitted—and no one \nis aware of it.  \n \n13. Illinois announced the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the state on January 24, 2020.10 \nAs of April 13, the IL Department of Public Health has confirmed 22,025 cases of \nCOVID-19 in the state.11 As of March 21, 2020, Illinois has been under a mandatory \nshelter-in-placer order.12 Since then, more than half of the world’s population has been \nplaced under mandatory lockdowns, and cities and institutions across the United States \nhave closed public events, workplaces, and schools in order to curb spread of COVID-19 \nby limiting person-to-person transmission in group settings.  \n \n14. On March 13, 2020 President Donald J. Trump announced a national state of emergency \nin response to the disease’s outbreak.13  \n \n15.

The virus is thought to be transmitted mainly between people who are in close contact \nwith one another (within about 6 feet) through respiratory droplets produced when an \ninfected person coughs or sneezes. It also may be possible that a person can get COVID-\n19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own \nmouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. What doctors and experts are calling “community \nspread” is at the root, and “containment” and “social distancing” are being enforced as \nthe best methods of prevention. Containment requires intensive hand washing practices, \ndecontamination and aggressive cleaning of surfaces, and identifying and isolating people \nwho are ill or who have had contact with people who are ill. Social distancing means, in \nessence, isolating oneself from other people: working from home, avoiding travel, \navoiding crowds and contact with others, not touching common surfaces, and generally \nstaying at least 6-12 feet from other people.  \n \n17. In light of COVID-19, individuals in detention facilities are at risk of serious harm. \nDetention facilities are designed to maximize control of the incarcerated population, not \nto minimize disease transmission or to efficiently deliver health care. These facilities are \nenclosed environments, much like the cruise ships that were the site of the largest \nconcentrated outbreaks of COVID-19. Detention facilities have even greater risk of \ninfectious spread than other enclosed environments because of conditions of crowding, \nthe proportion of vulnerable people detained, and often scant medical care resources. \nDuring the H1N1 influenza (“Swine Flu”) epidemic in 2009, jails and prisons were sites \nof severe outbreaks of viral infection.15  \n \n18. People incarcerated in detention facilities have an even greater need to utilize social \ndistancing to protect against rampant rates of infection. Toilets, sinks, and showers are \nshared, without disinfection between use. Food preparation and food service is \ncommunal, with little opportunity for surface disinfection. Spaces are poorly ventilated, \nwhich promotes highly efficient spread of diseases through droplets.  \n \n19. The medical facilities at jails and prisons are almost never sufficiently equipped to handle \nwidespread outbreaks of infectious diseases. To prevent transmission of droplet-borne \ninfectious diseases, people who are infected and ill need to be isolated in specialized \nairborne negative pressure rooms. Most jails and prisons have few negative pressure \nrooms if any, and these may be already in use by people with other conditions (including \ntuberculosis or influenza). Resources will become exhausted rapidly and any beds \navailable will soon be at capacity. As an outbreak spreads, medical personnel become \nsick and do not show up to work. Facilities can become dangerously understaffed with \nhealthcare providers.  \n \n20. Jails and prisons often need to rely on outside facilities (hospitals, emergency \ndepartments) to provide intensive medical care given that the level of care they can \nprovide in the facility itself is typically relatively limited. \n \n                                                 \n15 David M. Reutter, Swine Flu Widespread in Prisons and Jails, but Deaths are Few, PRISON LEGAL NEWS (Feb. \n15, 2010), https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2010/feb/15/swine-flu-widespread-in-prisons-and-jails-but-\ndeaths-are-few/. \n  4 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55-7 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 6 of 8 PageID #:1567\n21. As health systems inside facilities are taxed, people with chronic underlying physical and \nmental health conditions may not be able to receive the care they need. Failure to provide \nindividuals adequate medical care for their underlying chronic health conditions results in \nincreased risk of COVID-19 infection and increased risk of infection-related morbidity \nand mortality if they do become infected.  \n \n22. Failure to provide adequate mental health care, as may happen when health systems in \njails and prisons are taxed by COVID-19 outbreaks, can result in poor health outcomes. \nMoreover, mental health conditions may be exacerbated by the stress of incarceration \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, including isolation and lack of visitation.  \n \n23. These risks have all been borne out during past epidemics of influenza in jails and \nprisons. For example, in 2012, the CDC reported an outbreak of influenza in 2 facilities \nin Maine, resulting in two inmate deaths.16 Subsequent CDC investigation of 995 inmates \nand 235 staff members across the 2 facilities discovered insufficient supplies of influenza \nvaccine and antiviral drugs for treatment of people who were ill and prophylaxis for \npeople who were exposed. During the swine flu outbreak in 2009, jails and prisons \nexperienced a disproportionately high number of cases.17 Even facilities on “quarantine” \ncontinued to accept new intakes, rendering the quarantine incomplete. These scenarios \noccurred in the “best case” of influenza, a viral infection for which there was an effective \nand available vaccine and antiviral medications, unlike COVID-19, for which there is \ncurrently neither. \n \n24. Due to the crowded conditions and scarcity of sanitary and medical resources, \ntransmission of infectious diseases in jails and prisons, including the Cook County Jail, is \nincredibly common. These risks are magnified for those diseases, like COVID-19, that \nare transmitted by respiratory droplets. \n \n25. The experiences of other nations fighting COVID-19 outbreaks demonstrate the \nparticular risk of COVID-19 transmission present in detention facility settings. Prisons in \nChina reported more than 500 cases of COVID-19 spread across four facilities, and these \ncases affected both correctional officers and incarcerated people.18 Secretary of State \nMike Pompeo has called for Iran to release U.S. citizens detained there because of \n“deeply troubling” “[r]eports that COVID-19 has spread to Iranian prisons,” noting that \n“[t]heir detention amid increasingly deteriorating conditions defies basic human \ndecency.”19   \n                                                 \n16 Influenza Outbreaks at Two Correctional Facilities – Maine, March 2011, Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (2012), https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6113a3.htm. \n17 David M.

As of April 12, 2020, of the 22,025 confirmed cases in the state of Illinois, 306 of those \ncases have been detainees at the Cook County Jail.20 An addition 181 correctional \nofficers at the jail have been infected.21 The New York Times reported that the Cook \nCounty Jail is now the largest single source of coronavirus infections in the United \nStates.22 \n \n27. Continued uncontrolled outbreak in the Cook County Jail will impose a significant \nstraing on the larger community and its health care system. COVID-19 threatens the well-\nbeing of detained individuals, the corrections staff who shuttle between detention \nfacilities and outside communities, and members of those outside communities. Staff, \nvisitors, contractors, and vendors who pass between communities and facilities and can \nbring infectious diseases into facilities. Moreover, rapid turnover of jail and prison \npopulations means that people often cycle between facilities and communities. People \noften need to be transported to and from facilities to attend court and move between \nfacilities. Strains on the medical systems of detention facilities have implications for the \noutside hospitals and emergency departments on which detention facilities already \ndepend for intensive medical care services. Prison health is public health. \n \n28. I have reviewed the Recidiviz model of expected COVID-19 cases at the Cook County \nJail provided by the plaintiffs in this lawsuit to the Court. That model uses local and \nnational data to estimate the projected course of the COVID-19 outbreak at the jail with a \nlow, moderate, and high rate of spread. Among other things, it shows that expected \npercentage of county hospital beds that will be occupied by detainees of the Cook County \njail in the coming weeks. While the estimates vary depending on assumptions about \nsocial distancing measures inside of the jail, up to 5% of all county hospital beds may be \nneeded to treat jail detainees if substantial measures to enforce social distancing are not \ntaken. The result is that a significant portion of the county’s hospital capacity will be \nneeded to treat the jail population, even though that population represents a tiny fraction \nof the county’s total population. \n \n29. The only viable public health strategy available is risk mitigation. In my opinion, from an \nepidemiological perspective, ensuring that all detainees in Cook County Jail can socially \ndistance from one another is the only way to prevent further, essentially uncontrolled, \nspread of the virus. Social distancing is necessary for the safety of detained individuals \nand the broader community as we address the rapid global outbreak of COVID-19.  \n \n30. Enabling social distancing at the Jail has a number of valuable effects on public health \nand public safety: it reduces the chance of spread if the virus is introduced; it allows \neasier provision of preventive measures such as soap for handwashing, cleaning supplies \nfor surfaces, frequent laundering and showers, etc.; and it helps prevent overloading the \nwork of detention staff such that they can continue to ensure the safety of detainees.  \n \n                                                 \n20 https://www.cookcountysheriff.org/covid-19-cases-at-ccdoc/ (last visited Apr. 13, 2020). \n21 https://www.cookcountysheriff.org/covid-19-cases-at-ccdoc/ (last visited Apr. 13, 2020). \n22 https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/04/09/us/09reuters-health-coronavirus-usa-prison.html. \n  6 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02134 Document #: 55-7 Filed: 04/14/20 Page 8 of 8 PageID #:1569\n31. The public health crisis requires each and every one of us to re-evaluate how we conduct \nour lives and care for one another. Institutions responsible for the care and custody of \nvulnerable populations must take unique steps to “flatten the curve” and slow the spread \nof this virus. Enforcing social distancing at the Jail will help mitigate the harm to \ndetainees, staff, and the public from the COVID-19 outbreak.  \n \n32.

County of Riverside  \n   \n \nPresent: The Honorable  VIRGINIA A. PHILLIPS, CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n   \nCHRISTINE CHUNG    Not Reported \nDeputy Clerk    Court Reporter \n     \n \nAttorney(s) Present for Plaintiff(s):  Attorney(s) Present for Defendant(s): \nNone Present    None Present \n \nProceedings:  (IN CHAMBERS) MINUTE ORDER GRANTING “EMERGENCY MOTION TO \nENFORCE CONSENT DECREE” [DKT. 177]  \n \nOn April 6, 2020, Plaintiff Quinton Gray (“Plaintiff”) filed a document captioned \n“Emergency Motion1 to Enforce Consent Decree.”  (“Motion,” Dkt. 177).  Pursuant to this \nCourt’s April 8, 2020 Minute Order, (Dkt. 182), Defendant County of Riverside \n(“Defendant”) opposed the Motion on April 10, 2020 (“Opp.,” Dkt. 183).  After \nconsidering all papers submitted in support of, and in opposition to, the Motion, as well \nas the arguments advanced during the telephonic hearing on April 13, 2020, the Court \nGRANTS the Motion.  \n \nIn 2016, the Parties entered into a Consent Decree “to ensure the provision of \nconstitutional health care and to ensure non-discrimination for inmates with disabilities \nin the Riverside County Jails.”  (Dkt. 173 ¶ 1).  The plaintiff class includes three distinct \nsubclasses: the medical subclass, which comprises “[a]ll prisoners who are now, or will \nin the future be, subjected to the medical care policies and practices of the Riverside \n                                              \n1 The Court notes that an “Emergency Motion” is procedurally improper.  Plaintiff \nshould have filed an ex parte application to shorten time for hearing on a motion, \nin conformance with Local Rule 7-19.  In the interests of justice, the Court will \ntreat Plaintiff’s Motion as though it had been filed properly.  \nPage 1 of 6  CIVIL MINUTES – GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk cc  \n \n\nCase 5C:1a3s-ec:v -10:2004-4c4v--V0A21P3-O4 PD o  cDuomcuemnte #n:t  5169 1F i le Fdi:le 0d4 0/144/1/240/2 P0a  g Pea 3g eo f2 7 o Pf a6g  e PIDa g#e:1 I5D9 #6:17955\nJails”; the mental health subclass, which comprises “[a]ll prisoners who are now, or will \nin the future be, subjected to the mental health care policies and practices of the \nRiverside Jails”; and the disability subclass, which comprises “all prisoners who are \nnow, or will be in the future, subjected to policies and practices of the Riverside jails \nregarding specialized or sheltered housing for prisoners due to their mobility \nimpairments and need for assistive devices, and the provision and confiscation of \naccommodations for prisoners with mobility impairments[.]”  (Dkt. 173 ¶ 3).   \n \nThe Parties to the Consent Decree negotiated a Remedial Plan, which “is \ndesigned to meet the minimum level of health care necessary to fulfill Defendant’s \nobligations under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as to ensure non-\ndiscrimination against inmates with disabilities in the areas addressed by the Plan, as \nrequired by the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.”  (Dkt. 173 ¶ 9).  In light \nof the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic2, “Plaintiffs seek to enforce the Consent \nDecree by requiring the County to submit a plan to the Court to implement the \nGovernor’s order for physical distancing for all Californians housed in the jails and to \nprovide sanitation and other essential services generally accepted as necessary in \ncorrectional facilities to provide for the basic health needs of incarcerated people.”  \n(Motion at 3-4). \n \nAs Defendant argues, the Consent Decree specifies a dispute resolution process \nwhich provides that the Parties first conduct negotiations to resolve informally matters in \ndispute, then, if they are unable to resolve the dispute, to request that the Relevant \nCourt experts evaluate the issue and prepare a report.  Following preparation of this \nreport, if the parties still are unable to resolve the issue, they may request mediation \nwith Judge Raul Ramirez.  Only after having mediated are the parties to file a motion for \nrelief with this Court.  (Dkt. 173 ¶¶ 26–29).  Here, the parties have conducted the first \ntwo steps, but have not yet mediated.  Nevertheless, “[g]iven the urgent nature of the \nproceedings, Plaintiffs request the Court modify the Consent Decree to allow for urgent \nappeal for enforcement directly to the Court.”  (Motion at 17 n.2).   \n \n                                              \n2 The pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption to daily life.  On March 13, \n2020, the President of the United States declared a National Emergency in re-\nsponse to the Coronavirus Disease- 2019 (“COVID-19”) pandemic pursuant to \nthe National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. § 1601, et seq.).  California Governor \nGavin Newson has declared a state of emergency in response to the COVID-19 \noutbreak and, in his March 19, 2020 Executive Order N-33-20, “require[d] physi-\ncal distancing to keep Californians at least six feet apart at all times and to pre-\npare hospitals and health care workers for the coming surge in cases.”  (Motion \nat 2). \nPage 2 of 6  CIVIL MINUTES – GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk cc  \n \n\nCase 5C:1a3s-ec:v -10:2004-4c4v--V0A21P3-O4 PD o  cDuomcuemnte #n:t  5169 1F i le Fdi:le 0d4 0/144/1/240/2 P0a  g Pea 4g eo f3 7 o Pf a6g  e PIDa g#e:1 I5D9 #7:17956\nThe Court finds good cause to modify the Consent Decree to permit appeal to \nthis Court.  “[A] party seeking modification of a consent decree bears the burden of \nestablishing that a significant change in circumstances warrants revision of the decree. . \n. . A party seeking modification of a consent decree may meet its initial burden by \nshowing either a significant change either in factual conditions or in law.”” Rufo v. \nInmates of Suffolk Cty. Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 383–84 (1992).  The party seeking \nmodification need not prove the change in circumstance was “unforeseen and \nunforeseeable” at the time of entering into the consent decree, but “[o]rdinarily, . . . \nmodification should not be granted where a party relies upon events that actually were \nanticipated at the time it entered into a decree.”  Id. at 385 (emphasis added).  Here, \nclearly, the emergency resulting from the pandemic constitutes a “significant change in \ncircumstances” that was not actually foreseen at the time the parties entered into the \nConsent Decree.  Id. at 383.   \n \nThe parties therefore meet the standard to modify the Consent Decree to permit \nappeal to this Court.  In light of the urgency of the matter, the Court orders a two-track \ndispute resolution mechanism.  The Parties are to proceed with mediation before Judge \nRamirez on April 17, 2020, or an earlier date, if possible.  (See Opp. at 10).  The Court \nsimultaneously assumes jurisdiction to enforce the Consent Decree to the extent \nspecified in this Order.   \n \nThe Court next turns to Defendant’s obligations under the Consent Decree.  \nPlaintiff seeks to enforce the Consent Decree’s mandate to “meet the minimum level of \nhealth care necessary to fulfill Defendant’s obligations under the Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments,” (Dkt. 173 ¶ 9), by ensuring that Defendants implement the physical \ndistancing recommendations made by the Court’s experts, (see Dkt. 178, Ex. J, Allen \nExpert Report, ¶¶ 9-10, 14-16; Dkt. 178, Ex. K, Gage Expert Report, ¶¶ 5-10.).  Plaintiff \nargues that the County has several options available to limit the spread of the disease \nwithin the jails, including transferring prisoners to new, currently empty, John J. Benoit \nDetention Center (“JJBDC”) in Indio, California; relocating particularly vulnerable \nprisoners; and even release people to allow for physical distancing.  (Motion at 4).  At \nthe hearing, Defendant did not have information regarding conditions in the existing \ncounty jail facilities, insisted that moving prisoners to a newly completed, empty jail in \nIndio was not feasible, and admitted that it had not researched alternative housing \noptions such as recreation centers, halfway houses, and hotels.  Rather than having \ncreated a plan to safeguard those most vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus, Defendant \nconceded that it has not conducted an analysis of its own records to identify particularly \nvulnerable prisoners.  It also has not conducted an analysis of its jail population to \ndetermine whether there are any low-level offenders who might be eligible for early \nrelease. \nPage 3 of 6  CIVIL MINUTES – GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk cc  \n \n\nCase 5C:1a3s-ec:v -10:2004-4c4v--V0A21P3-O4 PD o  cDuomcuemnte #n:t  5169 1F i le Fdi:le 0d4 0/144/1/240/2 P0a  g Pea 5g eo f4 7 o Pf a6g  e PIDa g#e:1 I5D9 #8:17957\n \nDespite Defendant’s insistence that conditions in the Riverside County jails are \ncompliant with public health recommendations regarding social distancing, its counsel \nlacked information to respond to the Court’s questions regarding the ability to maintain 6 \nfeet distance between all prisoners in the jail, at all times, its plan for doing so, the size \nof cells and dormitories, and the number of prisoners per room. \nDefendant failed to provide satisfactory information about the feasibility of trans-\nfer of prisoners to other jail or non-jail facilities, including transfers of prisoners currently \nconfined in crowded jails to the new, empty, John J. Benoit Detention Center (“JJBDC”) \nin Indio, California.  The County states that it is “not-yet-ready to be populated” but pro-\nvides no details as to why.  (Opp. at 13).  The County stated at the hearing that the facil-\nity was completed in February 2020, but maintained that it is not yet ready for prisoners.  \nIn their papers and at the hearing, Defendant argued that “[t]he Sheriff’s Department is \ncurrently in the midst of a ninety day ‘transition period’ of the facility to determine \nwhether any issues arise that will need to be resolved before JJBDC can be populated \nwith inmates.”  (Dkt. 183-4, “Graves Decl.” ¶ 4).  The County states that the technology \nused in the JJBDC facility differs from that of other County facilities, but did not explain, \nin its papers or at the hearing, why this would prevent the transfer of inmates in an \nemergency situation.  (Graves Decl. ¶ 5).   \nShould the County be unable to implement adequate social distancing within its \nexisting jail facilities and take other necessary steps to decrease risk of infection, this \nCourt has the authority to order the transfer of prisoners to different facilities. Under \nCalifornia law, the Sheriff has the authority to relocate prisoners to respond to \nemergency situations: \n \nIn any case in which an emergency endangering the lives of inmates of a \nstate, county, or city penal or correctional institution has occurred or is im-\nminent, the person in charge of the institution may remove the inmates \nfrom the institution. He shall, if possible, remove them to a safe and con-\nvenient place and there confine them as long as may be necessary to \navoid the danger, or, if that is not possible, may release them. \nOther courts, including the Superior Court for the County of Sacramento County, al-\nready have ordered the Sheriff to use its authority under Cal. Gov't Code § 8658 to re-\nspond to the coronavirus emergency.  See Order Authorizing Sacramento County Sher-\niff’s Department to Grant Release (Cal. Super. Ct., Sac. Cty., Mar. 25, 2020).  \n \nDefendant argues that the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”) precludes this \nCourt from ordering the release of prisoners.  Even assuming this is true, nothing in the \nPage 4 of 6  CIVIL MINUTES – GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk cc  \n \n\nCase 5C:1a3s-ec:v -10:2004-4c4v--V0A21P3-O4 PD o  cDuomcuemnte #n:t  5169 1F i le Fdi:le 0d4 0/144/1/240/2 P0a  g Pea 6g eo f5 7 o Pf a6g  e PIDa g#e:1 I5D9 #9:17958\nPLRA prohibits a district judge from ordering the transfer of prisoners in response to vio-\nlations of their constitutional rights, as the district court did in Brown v. Plata, 2013 WL \n3200587, No. C01-1351 TEH (N.D. Cal. June 24, 2013), nor would it prohibit the Court \nfrom ordering the Sheriff to use his authority under § 8658 to transfer prisoners.  \n“[A]n order to transfer any single inmate out of a prison to correct the violation of \na constitutional right” where a “transfer was necessary for the inmate to obtain appropri-\nate medical care” is not a “prisoner release order,” but rather a transfer.  Plata v. Brown, \n2013 WL 3200587 at *8.  The same is true of “a policy that would result in transfer of a \nlarge group of inmates.”  Id.  Indeed, several potential courses of action qualify as \n“transfer” for the purposes of the PLRA.  Relocation to halfway houses, for example, is a \n“transfer” rather than “release.”  The PLRA defines a “residential reentry center” as a \nform of “prerelease custody.”  See 18 U.S.C. § 3624(g)(2)(B) (“A prisoner placed in pre-\nrelease custody pursuant to this subsection who is placed at a residential reentry center \nshall be subject to such conditions as the Director of the Bureau of Prisons [(BOP)] de-\ntermines appropriate.”).  Ninth Circuit case law assumes that a person in a “residential \nreentry center” is a “prisoner” and subject to BOP control.  See, e.g., Bottinelli v. Sala-\nzar, 929 F.3d 1196, 1200 (9th Cir. 2019) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3624(c)(1) as “requiring that \nthe BOP, ‘to the extent practicable, ensure that a prisoner serving a term of imprison-\nment spends a portion of the final months of that term’ in prerelease custody”). \n \nIn Plata v. Brown, the court declined to decide which standard governs the \ncourt’s review of such requests for transfer, finding that the Plata plaintiffs could satisfy \nthe most burdensome standard.  That standard “would require [them] to demonstrate \nthat the [transfer] policy must be enforced because failure to do so would result in delib-\nerate indifference under the Eighth Amendment.”  Id. at *10.  The Court makes no deter-\nmination here as to whether Plaintiff has met this standard, but notes that the County’s \nrecitation of “aggressive and swift” measures it has taken in response to COVID-19, \nnone of which concern jails, suggests that the County’s failure to act to protect inmates \ndoes indeed constitute deliberate indifference.  (Opp. at 16).  The County’s assurances \nthat it has provided unlimited free soap to prisoners and advised prisoners to remain \nphysically distant—without establishing that it is physically possible to do so—is unlikely \nto be sufficient to defeat a claim of deliberate indifference (or sufficient to defeat the re-\nquest to transfer prisoners for health reasons).  \nIn sum, Defendant has failed to demonstrate that it is currently taking adequate \nprecautions to protect the health of the prisoners in the county jails.  Plaintiff’s request \nthat Defendant be required “to submit a plan to the Court to implement the Governor’s \norder for physical distancing for all Californians housed in the jails” (Motion at 3-4), is \ntherefore GRANTED. \nPage 5 of 6  CIVIL MINUTES – GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk cc  \n \n\nCase 5C:1a3s-ec:v -10:2004-4c4v--V0A21P3-O4 PD o  cDuomcuemnte #n:t  5169 1F i le Fdi:le 0d4 0/144/1/240/2 P0a  g Pea 7g eo f6 7 o Pf a6g  e PIDa g#e:1 I6D0 #0:17959\nPlaintiffs are instructed to submit a proposed order detailing the findings and \noutstanding questions from the April 13, 2020 hearing no later than 4:00 p.m. on April \n15, 2020.
