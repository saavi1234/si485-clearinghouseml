The Court finds good cause to GRANT both portions of the Motion. Accordingly, Defendants have up to, and including, 12-28-2020 to Respond to Plaintiff's First Set of Written Discovery. Further, the Scheduling Order is modified as follows: Affirmative Experts due 1-29-2021; Written Discovery served on parties by 2-5-2021; Rebuttal Experts due 3-5-2021; Discovery closes 3-19-2021; 702 Motions deadline 4-5-2021; Dispositive Motions deadline 4-23-2021; and Final Pretial Conference is set for 6-23-2021 at 9:30 am in Courtroom C201 before Magistrate Judge S.

    "summary": "<p>On April 7, 2020, inmates held in Weld County Jail with high risks of complications from COVID-19 filed this putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The plaintiffs sued the Sheriff of Weld County under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, alleging the conditions of confinement violated their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. They alleged that the defendant had failed to adequately address the COVID-19 pandemic and that Weld County Jail was not following public health guidelines. They also claimed that they shared common utilities, such as toilets, that they were unable to practice social distancing, and that they did not have regular access to hand soap. The plaintiffs sought class certification, a temporary restraining order, and that the court order the defendant to implement a plan that would ensure compliance with public health guidelines. Concurrent with the complaint, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and expedited hearing.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs' proposed class was: All current and future persons held at the Weld County Jail who are at high risk of complications from COVID-19 because</p>\r\n<blockquote>(a) they are age 55 or older; or (b) they have the following chronic health conditions: cancer; autoimmune disease (including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Sjogren&rsquo;s, Crohn&rsquo;s); chronic lung disease (including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or other chronic conditions associated with impaired lung function); history of cardiovascular disease; chronic arthritis; chronic liver or kidney disease; diabetes; hypertension; heart failure; HIV; on chronic steroids or other immunosuppressant medications for chronic conditions; (c) they have history of smoking or other substance abuse disorders; or (d) they are pregnant.</blockquote>\r\n<p>On April 14, 2020, plaintiffs filed a motion to withdraw their request for a temporary restraining order and moved for a setting of a preliminary injunction hearing. On April 15, 2020, Judge Philip A. Brimmer granted the motion and set a preliminary injunction hearing for the week of April 27, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>On April 17, 2020, plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for limited expedited discovery, seeking: (1) an inspection of the Weld County jail by plaintiffs' medical expert; (2) a daily report from April 11 to the date of the preliminary injunction hearing detailing the number of individuals in isolation or quarantine; (3) a daily report from April 11 to the date of the preliminary injunction hearing detailing the number of individuals at the jail who had tested positive for COVID-19; and (4) copies of all policies and procedures issued by defendants concerning COVID-19. Defendants opposed the motion, arguing that the inspection would be unnecessary and an undue burden.</p>\r\n<p>On April 21, 2020, Judge Brimmer granted in part and denied in part plaintiffs' motion for limited expedited discovery. Judge Brimmer granted a limited inspection of Weld County Jail and the requested daily reports, but denied the request for all policies and procedures.</p>\r\n<p>On April 26, 2020, defendant filed a motion for a protective order, seeking to block a public records request by the plaintiffs for \"policies, procedures, manuals, guidelines, training materials, and orders relating to the coronavirus.\" On April 27, 2020, Judge Brimmer denied the motion, asserting that the defendant had failed to show that it would suffer any harm by complying with the plaintiffs' request.</p>\r\n<p>On May 11, the plaintiff's motion for TRO and preliminary injunction was granted in part. 614 F.Supp.3d 899. Specifically, the court ordered that on or before May 18, the defendant provide a list of persons &ldquo;medically vulnerable&rdquo; currently held at the Weld County Jail (over the age of 65 or with medical conditions). Additionally, they were required to institute a policy to ensure medically vulnerable inmates are &ldquo;socially distanced&rdquo; from other inmates housed in the Jail, enhanced sanitization, and increased monitoring for COVID-19 for those medically vulnerable by May 21. The defendants were also required to provide a report on the same day.</p>\r\n<p>The case has been reassigned to Magistrate Judge S. Kato Crews on May 12. On May 18, the defendants notified the court of their complete compliance with the court's preliminary injunction order. The plaintiffs disagreed and filed a motion for a hearing regarding the defendant's non-compliance on May 21. On July 2, the court denied the motion finding that the plaintiff's purpose of asking for a hearing is unclear. The court noted that the plaintiffs did not ask that defendant be held in civil contempt for violating the preliminary injunction order nor ask the court to modify the preliminary injunction order. Instead, they sought a hearing because of an &ldquo;imbalance in access to relevant information,\" but failed to explain why this information must be probed at a hearing rather than through the discovery process.</p>\r\n<p>On July 24, the plaintiffs sought to renew the preliminary injunction for an additional 30 days, which was granted on July 29. The plaintiffs again sought to renew the preliminary injunction for an additional 30 days on September 3, which was granted the next day. The preliminary injunction continued to be extended until December 9, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>On November 11, 2020, the parties filed a joint motion for the preliminary approval of class settlement, certification of a class and appointment of class counsel, and permission to post class notice. The parties reported that they had successfully negotiated a resolution to the dispute. The parties included in their motion a proposed consent decree that would ensure measures to protect class members from COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>The parties reported that the proposed consent decree was negotiated at arms-length without any conflicts of interest. Both parties conceded that they were uncertain of what the eventual outcome of the litigation would be considering the novelty of COVID-19. Both parties agreed that a settlement would be more valuable than proceeding to trial, given the complexity of the resolution and the immediacy of the COVID-19 crisis.</p>\r\n<p><em>Consent Decree</em></p>\r\n<p>The proposed consent decree implemented the CDC's definition of \"medically vulnerable\", subject to future modification by the CDC. The defendant agreed to identify medically vulnerable inmates during booking and intake and to protect such individuals during the remainder of the intake process. The WCJ agreed to attempt to house medically vulnerable inmates in single-cell units during intake and to use specified procedures to minimize exposure if single cells are not available. The WCJ agreed to continue to limit the exposure of medically vulnerable inmates in the general jail population and pledged to permit the maximum amount of daily out-of-cell time for inmates consistent with social distancing protocols.</p>\r\n<p>As part of the consent decree, the WCJ agreed to medically isolate COVID-19 positive inmates in isolation units and to ensure that such an environment would be non-punitive. The jail also promised to use enhanced sanitation procedures, to distribute masks, and to regularly monitor medically vulnerable inmates for COVID-19 symptoms. The jail also agreed to provide testing for inmates consistent with CDC guidelines and to continue remote visitation opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>WCJ agreed to maintain modified arrest standards that would remain in place for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis and pledged to advise Weld County police chiefs to be judicious with jail space.</p>\r\n<p>The consent decree also provided that the defendant comply with robust data reporting to plaintiffs' counsel to monitor compliance with the decree. The plaintiffs and the class were required to release all claims for injunctive and declaratory relief arising from COVID-19 at the WCJ prior to the decree. The expiration of the decree was set at the expiration of the executive order made by the Governor of Colorado declaring a state of emergency, unless the order was renewed or replaced. The defendant also agreed to pay the plaintiffs' counsel $122,387.60 for attorney's fees and costs.</p>\r\n<p>The November 11 motion also included a certification of settlement class and appointment of class counsel. The parties sought to certify all past, present, and future inmates housed at WCJ from April 7, 2020 through the end of the COVID-19 emergency who are \"medically vulnerable\". The two proposed class representatives fell within the high-risk populations vulnerable to COVID-19. Counsel for the plaintiffs were appointed class counsel.</p>\r\n<p>On December 11, 2020, Judge Brimmer ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs to clarify the meaning of \"past\" and \"future\" within the definition of the class and to discuss locations for posting the notice of the settlement within the WCJ in English and Spanish, as well as a location for sending objections.</p>\r\n<p>On December 29, 2020, Judge Brimmer granted the joint motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement, certification of a class and appointment of class counsel, and permission to post class notice. The parties agreed to withdraw past inmates from the proposed class and agreed that the extension of the consent decree to the end of the COVID-19 emergency covered future medically vulnerable inmates. The parties designated one of plaintiffs' counsel as the person to receive objections to the proposed settlement.</p>\r\n<p>The parties also agreed to upload the class notice to the WCJ's jail-wide television system in English and Spanish. The court preliminarily certified all present and future medically vulnerable inmates through the end of the COVID-19 emergency and ordered that plaintiffs' attorneys were appointed class counsel.</p>\r\n<p>On February 16, 2021, the court issued a final judgment granting the joint motion for final approval of class action settlement and final certification of the proposed class and dismissing the case with prejudice.</p>",

Hegarty, Esq., Andrew D. \nRingel, Esq., and John F. Peters, Esq., of Hall & Evans, L.L.C., submits his Response to \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order ... and Expedited Hearing [ECF 1] and \nrequests Plaintiffs’ Motion be denied in its entirety,1 as follows: \n \n                                            \n1 In compliance with the Court’s April 8, 2020, Minute Order, the Sheriff responds \nto ECF 1 only insofar as it seeks a temporary restraining order and expedited hearing. \nThe Sheriff reserves the right to respond further to the Motion insofar as it seeks a \npreliminary injunction. This Response was filed before April 13, 2020, at 9:00 AM MDT. \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 43\n \nI.  INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY \nECF  1,  Plaintiffs’  Motion  for  Temporary  Restraining  Order  ...  and  Expedited \nHearing (“Motion”) asks this Court to serve as the Keeper of the Weld County Jail instead \nof its elected Sheriff.  While the current pandemic brought on by the novel coronavirus \n(“COVID-19”) presents unprecedented challenges for all Americans, no basis exists for \nthis Court to depart from the applicable law governing granting the type of mandatory and \nsystemic injunctive relief Plaintiffs demand from the Sheriff of Weld County. This Court’s \nevaluation of the facts presented in this Response must be undertaken against the \nbackground of the applicable law set forth in this Response. A myriad of legal, factual, \nand practical barriers exist to the wholesale relief Plaintiffs seek from this Court. \nSince the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Sheriff and his deputies have \nworked hard to determine an appropriate response that sufficiently advances all the \ndifferent applicable interests—the need to operate the Weld County Jail; the need to \nprotect the safety and health of inmates, detainees, and staff; and the need to protect the \npublic  of Weld  County  and  Colorado.  As  set  forth  in  the  Sheriff’s  Declaration  that \naccompanies this Response, the Sheriff and his staff have engaged and continue to \nengage in ongoing efforts to meet all of these goals. The Sheriff and undersigned counsel \nstrongly believe any review of the totality of the Sheriff’s efforts and of the Weld County \nSheriff’s Office’s efforts demonstrate appropriate steps have been taken from a wide \nvariety  of  angles  to  protect  all  applicable  interests.  To  the  extent  any  areas  of \nimprovement can be identified, the Sheriff welcomes the input of everyone to continue to \nimprove all aspects of the operations of the Weld County Jail. At its bottom, the issue \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 43\n \nbefore this Court is not whether the Sheriff has been able to adopt any specific aspect of \nthe Centers for Disease Control guidelines adopted generally for the entire United States \nand not specifically suited for the unique circumstances of a correctional facility.  Instead, \nthe issue this Court must determine is whether Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights have been \nviolated. Fundamentally, based on the entire record before this Court as set forth in this \nResponse, the short answer (and the full answer) to that fundamental question is, “No.” \nFor the below reasons, Plaintiffs’ claims are moot, and Plaintiffs’ effort suffers from \ncrippling procedural and substantive infirmities. Plaintiffs are thus unable to satisfy the \nheightened burden necessary to attain injunctive relief at this juncture. Plaintiffs’ Motion \nfor Temporary Restraining Order ... and Expedited Hearing must be denied in its entirety. \nII.  RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS’ STATEMENT AS TO NOTICE TO DEFENDANT \nThe  Sheriff’s  counsel  disagrees  with  Plaintiffs’  statement  in  their  “Notice  to \nDefendant.” The Sheriff’s counsel did not “indicate[] that Defendant opposes the relief \nsought herein.” [ECF 1, at 28]. Rather, counsel for the Sheriff conferred extensively with \ncounsel for Plaintiffs before Plaintiffs filed ECF 1 and counsel were still in the process of \nconferring when ECF 1 was filed. Nevertheless, upon review of the as-filed version of \nECF 1, and for the reasons stated below, the Sheriff’s counsel states ECF 1 is opposed. \nIII.  COUNTER-STATEMENT OF FACTS \nFiled with this Response is the Declaration of Sheriff Steven Reams, Defendant. \n[See Decl. of Sheriff Steven Reams, Exhibit A]. The Sheriff’s Declaration, along with an \ndossier of attachments comprising emails, protocols, and other documents substantiating \nthe Declaration’s contents, sets forth the comprehensive and sustained effort the Weld \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 43\n \nCounty Sheriff’s Office (“WCSO”), under the Sheriff’s leadership, has brought to bear to \naddress the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the operations of the Weld County \nJail (“WCJ”) and to ensure inmate health and safety as much as reasonably practicable. \nBeginning in late February 2020, the Sheriff and the WCSO have taken substantial steps \nto generate, implement, and refine the policies and protocols of the WCSO to address the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. WCSO protocols and processes incorporated national guidelines \nfrom  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  (“CDC”),  state  directives  from  the  Colorado \nDepartment of Public Health and Environment (“CDPHE”), and local information and \nguidance from the Weld County Health Department (“WCHD”). All decisions made by the \nSheriff and the WCSO and adopted at the WCJ related to the COVID-19 pandemic have \nbeen made based on an assessment of the health and safety needs of the inmates, \nWCSO employees, and the public. All decisions made by the Sheriff and the WCSO and \nadopted at the WCJ related to the COVID-19 pandemic also were made based on distinct \noperational needs of a jail, the physical plant, structure, and layout of WCJ, and the \nresources and supplies available to the WCSO. The Sheriff and the WCSO persist in \nevaluating and responding to the different events which occurred since before COVID-19 \nbecame an issue for the WCSO generally and at the WCJ specifically and will continue \nto do so. [See Sheriff Decl., Exh. A, ¶ 6]. \nRather than set forth the details of the Sheriff’s and the WCSO’s response as \nincluded in the Sheriff’s Declaration, the Court is referred to the Declaration and specific \nreferences in the argument below are made to the Declaration as appropriate. \n \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 43\n \nIV.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nPlaintiffs incorrectly state the standard for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) or \nother injunctive relief, as relevant to the relief Plaintiffs request. Injunctive relief is an \nextraordinarily drastic remedy and is granted only in cases where the right to relief is \nclearly established. See Goldammer v. Fay, 326 F.2d 268, 270 (10th Cir. 1964). The \nmovants bear the burden to establish their right to relief. Penn v. San Juan Hospital, \nInc., 528 F.2d 1181, 1185 (10th Cir. 1975). Further, “[TROs] and preliminary injunctions \ndiffer in how long they can last. Temporary restraining orders can last no more than \nfourteen days; preliminary injunctions can last longer. When a temporary restraining order \nlasts longer than fourteen days, it becomes appealable as a preliminary injunction. This \nis true even if the district court labels its order a temporary restraining order.” Tooele \nCnty. v. United States, 820 F.3d 1183, 1187 (10th Cir. 2016) (footnote omitted) (citation \nomitted) (concluding District Court violated Anti-Injunction Act by issuing injunctive relief \nwhich had effect of enjoining state court proceedings). \nThe Sheriff agrees that to obtain a TRO (as with a preliminary injunction), Plaintiffs \nmust prove four elements: (1) they will suffer irreparable injury unless the relief issues; \n(2) the threatened injury outweighs whatever damages the relief might cause the Sheriff’s \nability to operate the WCJ; (3) such injunctive relief will not be adverse to the public \ninterest; and (4) Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of succeeding on the merits of their \ncase. Schrier v. Univ. of Colo., 427 F.3d 1253, 1258 (10th Cir. 2005) (affirming denial \nof injunctive relief); Little v. Jones, 607 F.3d 1245, 1251 (10th Cir. 2010) (same). \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 43\n \nInjunctive relief is “extraordinary” and should not issue unless the right to relief is “clear \nand unequivocal.” Kikumura v. Hurley, 242 F.3d 950, 955 (10th Cir. 2001). \nPlaintiffs next argue, however, that “where the moving party has established that \nthe three ‘harm’ factors tip decidedly in its favor, the ‘probability of success’ requirement \nis relaxed[.]” [ECF 1, at 30 (quoting Star Fuel Marts, LLC v. Sam’s East, Inc., 362 F.3d \n639, 652-53 (10th Cir. 2004)]. This is the wrong standard. Rather, in these circumstances, \nPlaintiffs labor under a “heightened burden” for injunctive relief, a burden imposed where \nthe sought-after relief: (1) disturbs the status quo; (2) is mandatory instead of prohibitory; \nor (3) affords the movant substantially all the relief it may recover after a full merits trial. \nSCFC ILC, Inc. v. VISA USA, Inc., 936 F.2d 1096, 1098-99 (10th Cir. 1991); accord O \nCentro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 973, 975 (10th \nCir. 2004) (en banc) (“O Centro”), aff’d on other grounds sub nom., Gonzales v. O \nCentro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418 (2006); see also In re \nHomeAdvisor, Inc. Litig., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141984, at *11-14 (D. Colo. Aug. 20, \n2019) (Brimmer, C.J.) (discussing whether injunction disturbs status quo or is mandatory). \nPlaintiffs “must make a strong showing both with regard to the likelihood of success on \nthe merits and with regard to the balance of harms, and may not rely on our modified \nlikelihood-of-success-on-the-merits standard.” O Centro, 389 F.3d at 976. This is so \nbecause “[s]uch disfavored injunctions ‘must be more closely scrutinized to assure that \nthe exigencies of the case support the granting of a remedy that is extraordinary even in \nthe normal course.’” Schrier, 427 F.3d at 1259 (quoting O Centro, 389 F.3d at 975). \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 43\n \nFirst, the “status quo” is not defined by “the parties’ existing legal rights,” but by \n“the reality of the existing status and relationships between the parties, regardless of \nwhether the existing status and relationships may ultimately be found to be in accord or \nnot in accord with the parties’ legal rights.” SCFC ILC, 936 F.2d at 1100. Second, \nmandatory injunctions are more burdensome than prohibitory ones because they compel \nthe nonmovant to act affirmatively in a particular way, and hence necessitate potential \nongoing supervision to assure the nonmovant is abiding by the injunction. Id. at 1099.  \nThird, injunctive relief awarding the movants substantially all the relief to which they may \nbe entitled if it succeeded on the merits echoes the “Sentence first, Verdict Afterwards” \nprocedure  parodied  in  Alice  in  Wonderland,  anathema  to  the  American  system  of \njurisprudence. See id. at 1099 & n.4. Here, Plaintiffs ask this Court to immediately order \nthe Sheriff and the WCJ to put in place numerous requirements, or alternatively, begin \nthe wholesale release of those incarcerated and detained in the WCJ. Plaintiffs’ requested \ninjunctive relief requires the Sheriff to take affirmative action, making the injunctive relief \nquintessentially mandatory. Clearly, the requested relief fundamentally would alter the \nstatus quo. Among other relief, Plaintiffs ask this Court to order the Sheriff and the WCJ \n“be required to physically distance all inmates from one another and staff within the \n[WCJ]” or “alternatively ask this Court to order the transfer of a sufficient number of \ninmates to electronic home monitoring to allow for appropriate physical distancing within \nthe Weld County Jail.” [ECF 1, at 6-7]. This extraordinary request alters the status quo, \neither by changing the bond conditions or sentences of dozens to hundreds of inmates, \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 43\n \nwhich the Sheriff has no power to do under state law,2 or by requiring the Sheriff to put in \nplace directives to WCJ deputies to forcefully ensure compliance with social distancing.3 \nFourth, Plaintiffs ask the Court to immediately order the full relief sought in the \nComplaint, before any discovery, trial, or dispositive briefing. For all of these reasons, \nPlaintiffs must meet the heightened standard for disfavored injunctive relief. \nFinally, Plaintiffs’ demand for injunctive relief is not only subject to the heightened \nstandard of a mandatory injunction.  It is also subject to the limitations and requirements \nof the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PLRA”) discussed at length below. \nHence, this Court must subject Plaintiffs’ application for injunctive relief to the \nextraordinary scrutiny it warrants under the circumstances of this case. \nV.  ARGUMENT \nSeveral substantive and fully applicable statutes and bodies of caselaw, some of \nwhich are conspicuously absent from Plaintiffs’ Motion, must inform the Court’s decision \non the propriety of granting the sought-after injunctive relief which would come with a \n                                            \n2 As discussed later in this Response, the Court lacks the authority to change \ninmates’ bond conditions and sentences, as only Colorado state courts have jurisdiction \nover bond conditions and sentences of WCJ inmates; this is not a habeas corpus action \nbut a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action; and federal courts lack authority to enjoin state courts \nthrough a § 1983 action in most circumstances, based on the plain terms of § 1983. \n \n3 Plaintiffs have not given this Court any direction for how the Sheriff could enforce \nsocial distancing in the WCJ. Would the Court authorize all necessary force to maintain \na six-foot distance between all inmates at all times even in the face of inmate refusal? \nWould tasers be permitted if inmates refused to socially distance? Could any inmate who \nrefused be put in indefinite solitary confinement? Would deputies acting under the Court \nOrder  to  ensure  social  distancing  be  immune  from  suit  alleging  excessive  force  in \nensuring  compliance  with  the  Order?  As  such,  Plaintiffs’  request  to  ensure  social \ndistancing opens a Pandora’s Box of legal conundrums and § 1983 claims, none of which \nPlaintiffs appear to have considered. \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 43\n \nTRO and expedited hearing. When those substantive and fully applicable legal principles \nare applied to the true and correct timeline and factual scenario presented with this \nResponse, it is apparent Plaintiffs cannot satisfy any of the four elements necessary to \ngrant injunctive relief. Thus, this Court should deny the Motion and should preclude \nissuance of the sought-after injunctive relief and expedited hearing. \nA. The Prison Litigation Reform Act Both Governs and Limits Plaintiffs’ Claims \nPlaintiffs omit any mention of the PLRA or the impact of the PLRA on their claims \nand claimed entitlement to injunctive relief against the Sheriff. \nPlaintiffs’ claims inarguably are subject to the PLRA. See, e.g., Wolfson v. United \nStates, 336 F. App’x 792, 794-95 (10th Cir. 2009) (“prisoner” in PLRA includes individuals \naccused of criminal law violations and those sentenced criminally); 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(h) \n(defining “prisoner” as “any person incarcerated or detained in any facility who is accused \nof, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law or \nthe terms and conditions of parole, probation, pretrial release, or diversionary program”). \nThe PLRA “imposes limits on the scope and duration of preliminary and permanent \ninjunctive relief.” Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 650 (2004). The “new standards for \ninjunctive and prospective relief” provided by the PLRA underscores the fact “the PLRA \n‘strongly disfavors continuing relief through the federal courts; indeed, its fundamental \npurpose [is] to extricate them from managing state prisons.’” Porter v. Graves, 597 F. \nApp’x 964, 967 (10th Cir. 2014) (quoting Guajardo v. Tex. Dep’t of Crim. Justice, 363 \nF.3d 392, 394 (5th Cir. 2004)). Specifically, the PLRA provides the following requirements \nfrom Congress which governs TROs and both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief: \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 43\n \n(a) Requirements for relief. \n  \n(1) Prospective relief. \n \n(A) Prospective  relief  in  any  civil  action  with  respect  to  prison \nconditions shall extend no further than necessary to correct the \nviolation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs. The \ncourt shall not grant or approve any prospective relief unless the \ncourt finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than \nnecessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least \nintrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal \nright. The court shall give substantial weight to any adverse impact \non public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused \nby the relief. \n \n(B) The court shall not order any prospective relief that requires or \npermits a government official to exceed his or her authority under \nState or local law or otherwise violates State or local law, unless— \n \n(i) Federal law requires such relief to be ordered in violation \nof State or local law; \n \n(ii) the relief is necessary to correct the violation of a Federal \nright; and \n \n(iii) no other relief will correct the violation of the Federal right. \n \n(C) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the courts, \nin exercising their remedial powers, to order the construction of \nprisons or the raising of taxes, or to repeal or detract from otherwise \napplicable limitations on the remedial powers of the courts. \n \n(2) Preliminary injunctive relief. In any civil action with respect to prison \nconditions, to the extent otherwise authorized by law, the court may enter a \ntemporary restraining order or an order for preliminary injunctive relief. \nPreliminary injunctive relief must be narrowly drawn, extend no further than \nnecessary to correct the harm the court finds requires preliminary relief, and \nbe the least intrusive means necessary to correct that harm. The court shall \ngive  substantial  weight  to  any  adverse  impact  on  public  safety  or the \noperation of a criminal justice system caused by the preliminary relief and \nshall respect the principles of comity set out in paragraph (1)(B) in tailoring \nany preliminary relief. Preliminary injunctive relief shall automatically expire \non the date that is 90 days after its entry, unless the court makes the findings \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 43\n \nrequired under subsection (a)(1) for the entry of prospective relief and \nmakes the order final before the expiration of the 90-day period. \n \n(3) Prisoner release order. \n \n(A) In any civil action with respect to prison conditions, no court shall \nenter a prisoner release order unless— \n \n(i) a court has previously entered an order for less intrusive \nrelief that has failed to remedy the deprivation of the Federal \nright  sought  to  be  remedied  through  the  prisoner  release \norder; and \n \n(ii) the defendant has had a reasonable amount of time to \ncomply with the previous court orders. \n \n(B) In  any  civil  action  in  Federal  court  with  respect  to  prison \nconditions, a prisoner release order shall be entered only by a three-\njudge  court  in  accordance  with  section  2284  of  title  28,  if  the \nrequirements of subparagraph (E) have been met. \n \n(C) A party seeking a prisoner release order in Federal court shall \nfile with any request for such relief, a request for a three-judge court \nand  materials sufficient  to  demonstrate that  the  requirements  of \nsubparagraph (A) have been met. \n \n(D) If the requirements under subparagraph (A) have been met, a \nFederal judge before whom a civil action with respect to prison \nconditions is pending who believes that a prison release order should \nbe considered may sua sponte request the convening of a three-\njudge court to determine whether a prisoner release order should be \nentered. \n \n(E) The three-judge court shall enter a prisoner release order only if \nthe court finds by clear and convincing evidence that— \n \n(i) crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a Federal \nright; and \n \n(ii) no other relief will remedy the violation of the Federal right. \n \n(F) Any  State  or  local  official  including  a  legislator  or  unit  of \ngovernment whose jurisdiction or function includes the appropriation \nof funds for the construction, operation, or maintenance of prison \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 43\n \nfacilities, or the prosecution or custody of persons who may be \nreleased from, or not admitted to, a prison as a result of a prisoner \nrelease  order  shall  have  standing  to  oppose  the  imposition  or \ncontinuation in effect of such relief and to seek termination of such \nrelief, and shall have the right to intervene in any proceeding relating \nto such relief. \n \n18 U.S.C. § 3626. \nThe injunctive relief provisions of the PLRA have significant implications for the \nrelief requested in Plaintiffs’ Motion. First, any TRO or other inchoate injunctive relief \n“must be narrowly drawn, extend no further than necessary to correct the harm the court \nfinds requires preliminary relief, and be the least intrusive means necessary to correct \nthat harm.”  18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2); see also Biodiversity Assocs. v. Cables, 357 F.3d \n1152, 1167 (10th Cir. 2004) (PLRA “had set new limits on the power of courts to give \ninjunctive relief to prisoners, requiring (among other things) that any injunctive relief \ngranted be both narrowly drawn to correct the violation of federal rights and also the least \nintrusive means of correcting the violation. 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A).”); Martinez v. \nMaketa, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60711, at *10 (D. Colo. June 7, 2011) (“”Prior to granting \ninjunctive relief in a prison conditions case, the Prison Litigation Reform Act requires this \nCourt to find that the relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct \nthe violation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, and is the least intrusive means necessary \nto correct the violation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.”). \nSecond, in crafting such relief, this Court “shall give substantial weight to any \nadverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by \nthe preliminary relief and shall respect the principles of comity set out in paragraph (1)(B) \nin tailoring any preliminary relief.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2). “Under the PLRA, federal courts \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 43\n \nare prohibited from becoming involved in the actions of the state’s correctional system \nabsent compelling reasons. A court considering whether to grant injunctive relief in a \nprisoner case must give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the \noperation of the criminal justice system.” Oken v. Sizer, 321 F. Supp. 2d 658, 666-67 (D. \nMd.), cert. denied, 542 U.S. 917 (2004). \nThird, no court can issue a prison release order until it “has previously entered an \norder for less intrusive relief that has failed to remedy the deprivation of the Federal right \nsought to be remedied through the prisoner release order” and the jail “has had a \nreasonable amount of time to comply with the previous court orders.” 18 U.S.C. § \n3626(a)(3)(a)(i) & (ii); see, e.g., Roberts v. Cnty. of Mahoning, 495 F. Supp. 2d 694, \n698 (N.D. Ohio 2006) (recognizing requirement under the PLRA “that the Defendants \nhave been given an opportunity to correct the problem of jail overcrowding and have been \nunable to do so without further intervention by this Court.”). \nFourth, any prison release order requires a court order from a three-judge panel. \n18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3)(B)-(E); Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 514 (2011); United States \nv. Cook Cnty., 761 F. Supp. 2d 794, 797 (N.D. Ill. 2011). The procedures for appointing \na three-judge court are found at 28 U.S.C. § 2284. \nFifth, “the PLRA requires that district courts issuing prospective relief in cases \ninvolving prison conditions make certain findings in order for that relief to conform to the \nlaw.” Alloway v. Hodge, 72 F. App’x 812, 815 (10th Cir. 2003). Any failure by a District \nCourt to make these required factual findings under the PLRA is reversible error. Doe v. \nCook Cnty., 798 F.3d 558, 564 (7th Cir. 2015). \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 43\n \nAny consideration by this Court of Plaintiffs’ requested relief must comply with all \nthese provisions of the PLRA. Like the mandatory injunctive relief requested by Plaintiffs \nhere, the PLRA’s requirements for injunctive relief also pose a substantial barrier to this \nCourt ordering any such relief. \nB. Deference Is Due to the Expertise and Judgment of Correctional Officials \nPlaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief must also be evaluated in the context of the \nability and expertise of the Sheriff to appropriately and effectively operate the Weld \nCounty Jail, and the concomitant necessitation for the Court to defer to such expertise. \nThe Supreme Court of the United States has long recognized the need for federal \ncourts to exercise deference to, and restraint in connection with, operations decisions by \ncorrectional officials. “[P]roblems that arise in the day-to-day operation of a corrections \nfacility are not susceptible to easy solutions. Prison administrators therefore should be \naccorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices \nthat in their judgment are needed to preserve order and discipline and to maintain \ninstitutional security.” Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547 (1979); Romo v. Champion, \n446 F.3d 1013, 1015 (10th Cir. 1995).   \nThe Supreme Court’s deference to prison officials arises in part from the expertise \nthose officials possess. Bell, 441 U.S. at 548; Jones v. N.C. Prisoners’ Labor Union, \nInc.,  433  U.S.  119,  128  (1977).  “[W]e  accord  prison  authorities  deference  as  they \nundertake that complex job.” Williams v. Taylor, 561 F. App’x 695, 699 (10th Cir. 2014). \n“We  must  accord  substantial  deference  to  the  professional  judgment  of  prison \nadministrators, who bear a significant responsibility for defining the legitimate goals of a \n14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 43\n \ncorrections system and for determining the most appropriate means to accomplish them.”  \nOverton v. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 126, 132 (2003). \nThe Supreme Court recognizes deference is also appropriate on separation of \npowers grounds. “[T]he operation of our correctional facilities is peculiarly the province of \nthe Legislative and Judicial Branches of our Government, not the Judicial.” Bell, 441 U.S. \nat 548. “[I]t is not the role of the federal judiciary to scrutinize and interfere with the daily \noperations of a state prison.” Peterson v. Shanks, 149 F.3d 1140, 1144 (10th Cir. 1998).   \nCourts have no power “to supervise prison administration or to interfere with the ordinary \nprison rules or regulations.” Banning v. Looney, 213 F.2d 771, 771 (10th Cir. 1954). \n“Application of this deferential standard ensures that ‘prison administrators ..., and \nnot the courts, [are] to make the difficult judgments concerning institutional operations.’”  \nUnited States v. Rivera, 83 F. Supp. 3d 1130, 1133 (D. Colo. 2015) (quoting Turner v. \nSafley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987)). “[T]here is a strong public interest in affording substantial \ndeference to prison officials in managing the daily operations of a prison due to the unique \nnature, needs and concerns of the prison environment.” Pinson v. Pacheco, 424 F. App’x \n749, 756 (10th Cir. 2011). “Running a prison is an inordinately difficult undertaking that \nrequires expertise, planning, and the commitment of resources, all of which are peculiarly \nwithin the province of the legislative and executive branches of government. Prison \nadministration is, moreover, a task that has been committed to the responsibility of those \nbranches, and separation of powers concerns counsel a policy of judicial restraint. Where \na state penal system is involved, federal courts have, as we indicated in  Martinez, \n15 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 43\n \nadditional reason to accord deference to the appropriate prison authorities.’” Turner, 482 \nU.S. at 85 (citing Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 405 (1974)). \nThis Court’s evaluation of the Sheriff’s and the WCJ’s response to the COVID-19 \npandemic must be undertaken in light of the strong deference this Court must show to jail \nadministrators and officials under these precedents. See, e.g., Orwig v. Williams, 2019 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 169556 (D. Colo. Sept. 30, 2019) (Brimmer, C.J.) (evaluating RLUIPA \nclaim under Turner in the prison context and recognizing deference due prison officials); \nSilverstein v. Fed. Bur. of Prisons, 704 F. Supp. 2d 1077, 1095 (D. Colo. 2010) \n(Brimmer, C.J.) (“On issue of prison management and placement of inmates, courts owe \nprison officials considerable deference.”). \nC. Plaintiffs’ Misinterpretation of the Law on Conditions of Confinement Claims \nA corrective is necessary about Plaintiffs’ misinterpretation of the law in the Tenth \nCircuit concerning conditions of confinement claims. \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint [ECF 7] attempts two claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, both \nalleging unconstitutional conditions of confinement. The two claims are nearly identical, \nbut Claim 1 is brought under the Fourteenth Amendment for Plaintiffs held as pretrial \ndetainees, and Claim 2 is brought under the Eighth Amendment for Plaintiffs who have \nbeen convicted of crimes and are serving sentences. The same standard applies to both \nthese claims. See Craig v. Eberly, 164 F.3d 490, 495 (10th Cir. 1998); Ledbetter v. City \nof Topeka, Kan., 318 F.3d 1183, 1188 (10th Cir. 2003).  \nPlaintiffs  argue  different  standards  apply  to  pretrial  detainees  and  convicted \nprisoners and argue Craig was abrogated by Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466 \n16 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 43\n \n(2015). See [ECF 1, at 32 n.62]. To support this argument, Plaintiffs cite Abila v. Funk, \n220 F. Supp. 3d 1121, 1181 (D.N.M. 2016) (Browning, J.), and cases from various other \nCircuits, but not the Tenth Circuit. When Judge Browning decided Abila, he did not have \nthe benefit of Tenth Circuit opinions on point. The Tenth Circuit has since observed this \nargument exists but (repeatedly) declined to address it, as recently as March 26, 2020. \nSee, e.g., Khan v. Barela, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 9438 (10th Cir. Mar. 26, 2020) (“In this \ncircuit, there is an open question whether, in light of Kingsley’s pronouncement regarding \nexcessive-force claims, the subjective component of the Farmer test applies to a pretrial \ndetainee’s claims regarding conditions of confinement and inadequate medical care.”); \nBurke v. Regalado, 935 F.3d 960, 991 n.9 (10th Cir. 2019) (recognizing argument but \ndeclining to resolve it); Perry v. Durborow, 892 F.3d 1116, 1122 n.1 (10th Cir. 2018).4 \nBecause the Tenth Circuit has not overruled Craig, it remains controlling law for this \nCourt, Plaintiffs are incorrect, and the same deliberate indifference standard applies to \nclaims for both pretrial detainees and convicted inmates. \nThe  applicable  standard,  therefore,  requires  all  Plaintiffs  to  satisfy  both  an \nobjective  and a  subjective  component.  Craig,  164  F.3d  at 495.  First,  the  objective \ncomponent requires the alleged deprivation be “sufficiently serious.” Wilson v. Seiter, \n501  U.S.  294,  298  (1991).  “[O]nly  those  deprivations  denying  the  minimal  civilized \nmeasure of life’s necessities ... are sufficiently grave to form the basis of an Eighth \n                                            \n4  See also Ueding v. Border, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36835 (D. Colo. Mar. 7, \n2019) (in case involving pretrial detainee under the Fourteenth Amendment applying \nKingsley to excessive force claim and Craig to conditions of confinement claim); Hill v. \nReardon, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 234762 (D. Colo. Nov. 16, 2018) (same). \n17 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of 43\n \nAmendment violation.” Id. at 298. Both the severity and the duration of the allegedly \nunconstitutional conditions of confinement are taken into consideration as are the totality \nof the overall conditions of confinement. Id. at 304-05; Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, \n834 (1994); Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 346 (1981). \nSecond, the subjective component of the inquiry requires the official to have a \nsufficiently culpable state of mind. “In the context of prison-conditions claims, the required \nstate of mind is one of deliberate indifference to inmate health and safety.” Craig, 164 \nF.3d at 495. “In other words, the jailer is liable only if he or she knows of and disregards \nan excessive risk to inmate health and safety; the official must both be aware of facts \nfrom which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, \nand he must also draw the inference.” Id. “The test requires both knowledge and disregard \nof possible risks, a mens rea on a par with criminal recklessness. If an official is aware of \nthe potential for harm but takes reasonable efforts to avoid or alleviate that harm, he bears \nno liability under this standard.” Despain v. Uphoff, 264 F.3d 965, 975 (10th Cir. 2001) \n(internal citations omitted). \nD. Both the Sheriff and This Court Lack Authority to Modify Sentences and Bonds \nAn  explanation  is  necessary  concerning  the  legal  restraints  on  the  Sheriff’s  \nauthority to modify sentences and bonds, and this Court’s inability to accept Plaintiffs’ \ninvitation to weaponize the United States Constitution and require the Sheriff to do so. \nPlaintiffs  ask  this  Court  to  order  the  Sheriff  to  ensure  social  distancing  the \nequivalent of CDC guidelines, or alternatively order the release from the WCJ of sufficient \ninmates to electronic home monitoring to allow for physical distancing of the equivalent \n18 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of 43\n \nof CDC guidelines within the WCJ. [ECF 1, at 6-7]. This Court cannot order either of these \nremedies through a temporary restraining order or through other injunctive relief. \nFirst, due to the physical and architectural realities of the WCJ, the only means to \nguarantee social distancing by at least six feet at all times would be to authorize the Sheriff \nand his deputies to use all necessary force to ensure all inmates are socially distancing \nat all times or to order prisoners released. Neither is a viable option for a temporary \nrestraining order or other injunctive relief.5 \nSecond, this Court cannot order Plaintiffs or any other inmates released from the \nWCJ. First, as discussed above, the PLRA imposes multiple requirements before the \nfederal judiciary may issue a prisoner release order. It is not possible for this Court to \ncomply with those requirements in issuing the requested TRO or any related initial-stage \ninjunctive relief because, among other reasons, the Court must first convene a three judge \npanel, 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3)(B)-(E), must first enter a less intrusive order, and must first \ngive the Sheriff and WCJ a reasonable time to comply. Id., § 3626(a)(3)(a)(i) and (ii). This \ncannot be achieved in the expedited timeframe which Plaintiffs contemplate for a TRO or \nrelated  initial-stage  injunctive  relief.  Any  prisoner  release  order  therefore  would  be \nreversible error in direct violation of the PLRA. \nThird, the Court also cannot use injunctive relief in this action to direct Colorado \nstate judges to take any action. See 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (expressly disallowing injunctive \n                                            \n5 For instance, would Plaintiffs have all WCSO deputies refrain from all hands-on \nmethods to subdue noncompliant or disruptive inmates or detainees and use only Tasers \nor pepperball rounds? The Sheriff certainly would not endorse such a course of action \nand, presumably, neither would this Court. \n19 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of 43\n \nrelief against a judicial officer “for an act or omission taken in such officer’s judicial \ncapacity  ...  unless  a  declaratory  decree  was  violated  or  declaratory  relief  was \nunavailable.”); Knox v. Bland, 632 F.3d 1290, 1292 (10th Cir. 2011). By fiat of Congress, \ntherefore, in a § 1983 action this Court lacks authority to direct a state court judge to \nmodify an inmate’s or a detainee’s bond, reconsider a sentence, or otherwise direct a \nstate court judge to order the release of a particular inmate. \nFourth, Plaintiffs have not brought this action seeking relief through habeas corpus \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254, which might allow this Court to consider whether individual \nPlaintiffs’ bonds or sentences were unconstitutional.6 \nAnd even if this Court had the jurisdiction and authority to modify Plaintiffs’ bonds \nthrough this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action, Younger abstention dictates the Court not intervene \ninto an ongoing criminal prosecution. See Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971); \nChapman v. Oklahoma, 472 F.3d 747, 749 (10th Cir. 2006) (discussing factors to \nconsider regarding Younger abstention). This is especially true where crime victim rights \nwould be implicated and potentially violated. See Colo. Const. Art. II, § 16a (“Any person \nwho is a victim of a criminal act, or such person’s designee, legal guardian, or surviving \nimmediate family members if such person is deceased, shall have the right to be heard \nwhen relevant, informed, and present at all critical stages of the criminal justice process.  \nAll  terminology,  including  the  term  ‘critical stages’,  shall  be defined  by  the  general \nassembly.”); C.R.S. §§ 24-4.1-302(1)(f) & (h) (victim rights attach to charges of assault in \n                                            \n6 Even if Plaintiffs had petitioned for writs of habeas corpus, Plaintiffs likely could \nnot meet the requirements of 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1). \n \n20 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of 43\n \nthe  first  and  third  degree,  charges  currently  pending  against  Plaintiff  Barnum  and \nCarranza, respectively). The victims in these cases have both a constitutional and a \nstatutory right to be informed of all “critical stages,”7 id. § 302.5(1)(b), and also have the \nright to be informed when the defendant is released from the county jail, id. § 302.5(1)(d), \nand  the  right  to  be  heard  at  a  bond  hearing,  id.  § 302.5(1)(d)(I),  a  sentencing  or \nresentencing  hearing,  id.  § 302.5(1)(d)(IV),  or  a  sentence  modification  hearing.  Id. \n§ 302.5(1)(d)(V). Colorado law requires Colorado state judges to inquire whether the \nvictim is present and wishes to address the court at any of these hearings before the \nCourt rules. Id. § 303. While these state statutes are not binding on this Court, Younger \nabstention dictates this Court should be mindful of these and other comity and federalism \nconcerns before directly intervening in state criminal cases. \nThe Sheriff also lacks unilateral authority to release inmates from the WCJ either \nunder his own authority or pursuant to any order from this Court. While the Sheriff is the \ncustodian of the WCJ, C.R.S. § 30-10-511, all WCJ inmates are there because of lawful \nstate court orders. See, e.g., C.R.S. §§ 18-1.3-202 (Colorado state court may sentence \na convicted felon, such as Plaintiff Hunter, to up to ninety days jail as a condition of \nprobation); 16-4-102 (Colorado state court must set bond before trial, which a state judge \ndid for Plaintiffs Carranza, Martinez, Barnum, Lewis, and Ward). Convicted inmates may \nrequest sentence reconsideration, see Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(b), and pretrial detainees may \n                                            \n7  As  relevant  here,  “critical  stages”  include:  change  in  bond,  sentencing  or \nresentencing, modification to a sentence by Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(a) or 35(b) motion, or \n“the parole, release, or discharge from imprisonment of a person convicted of a crime.” \nSee Colo. Rev. Stat. §§ 24-4.1-302(2)(c), (h), (j), and (n). \n \n21 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 22 of 43\n \nrequest bond reduction. See C.R.S. § 16-4-109.8 Absent state court orders granting this \nrelief, the Sheriff must abide by current court orders and keep inmates in custody at the \nWCJ. See C.R.S. § 17-26-103 (“keepers of the several county jails ... shall receive and \nsafely keep every person duly committed ... to such jail” and “shall not without lawful \nauthority let out of such jail, on bail or otherwise, any such person”). And the Sheriff cannot \nrelease convicted persons before they lawfully serve their sentences. See C.R.S. § 17-\n26-109 (time computation sheriffs are required to apply in calculating release dates and \nawarding good time to convicts serving sentences in county jails). \nIn light of these limitations, the Sheriff took proactive steps that are within his legal \nauthority to reduce the WCJ population. The Sheriff directed his deputies, and made \nseveral requests of local law enforcement, not to arrest suspects whenever possible but \ninstead  to  issue  summonses  for  court  dates  well  into  the  future.  This  alone  has \nsignificantly reduced the number of incoming inmates, resulting in a 35% decrease in jail \npopulation since March 1, 2020. But Colorado law still requires law enforcement officers \nto arrest a suspect when the officers have probable cause for specified crimes. See, e.g., \nC.R.S. 18-6-803.6(1) (peace officer must arrest after determining there is probable cause \nfor offense involving domestic violence). The Sheriff must, therefore, continue to operate \n                                            \n8 Plaintiffs Carranza, Barnum, and Lewis have petitioned for bond modifications to \nallow reduced security amounts or personal recognizance bonds, pursuant to C.R.S. \n§ 16-4-109. Colorado state judges considered and denied Mr. Carranza’s request on \nMarch 18, 2020, Mr. Barnum’s request on March 25, 2020, and Mr. Ward’s request on \nMarch 24, 2020. A Colorado state judge reduced the amount of security required on Mr. \nLewis’s  bond.  Plaintiff  Hunter  has  petitioned  a  Colorado  state  judge  for  sentence \nreduction, but no ruling issued, to the Sheriff’s knowledge. Plaintiffs Ward and Propes are \nno longer in WCJ custody due to the natural expiration of their confinement under statute \nand caselaw and, as discussed herein, their claims are moot. \n22 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 23 of 43\n \nwithin physical structure of the jail and legal structure of Colorado law, receiving new \narrivals—after arrest or sentencing—and detaining them until lawfully allowed to release \nthem pursuant to the requirements of Colorado law and any applicable order of a state \ncourt judge. This Court’s evaluation of Plaintiffs’ demand for injunctive relief must be \nevaluated within these legal constraints on the Sheriff under Colorado law. \nE.  Plaintiffs Must Establish a Custom, Policy, or Practice of the Sheriff Violated \n      their Constitutional Rights for Any Cognizable Claim to Be Successful \n \nPlaintiffs sued the Sheriff in his official capacity, not individually. “A ‘suit against \n[the Sheriff] in his official capacity as sheriff is the equivalent of a suit against [the] \nCounty.’” Layton v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm’rs, 512 F. App'x 861, 867 n.4 (10th Cir. 2013) \n(alteration in original) (quoting Lopez v. LeMaster, 172 F.3d 756, 762 (10th Cir. 1999)). \nTo establish liability for Weld County, Plaintiffs must show “deliberate action attributable \nto the municipality itself is the ‘moving force’ behind the plaintiff’s deprivation of federal \nrights.” Bd. of Cnty. Com'rs of Bryan Cnty., Okla. v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 403 (1997) \n(“Bryan Cnty.”); Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978). However, \nPlaintiffs neither pled such a claim in their operative Complaint, ECF 7, nor made any \nargument in ECF 1 as to why they are likely to succeed on the merits of such a claim. \nVeritably, it is because they cannot.9 \nA local government may not be sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for an injury inflicted \nsolely by its employees or agents. Waller v. City & Cnty. of Denver, 932 F.3d 1277 (10th \n                                            \n9 What’s more, even if Plaintiffs were somehow to amend their Complaint in the \nfuture to add a Monell municipal liability claim or restructure their allegations to attempt \nto allege a municipal liability claim, they won’t be entitled to the presumption of fact as to \nany allegation which contradicts the evidence encompassed by the Sheriff’s Declaration. \n23 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 24 of 43\n \nCir. 2019) (affirming Rule 12 dismissal); Mocek v. City of Alb., 813 F.3d 912, 934 (10th \nCir. 2015). Municipal liability under § 1983 mandates a constitutional violation “attributable \nto the municipality itself” and requires a plaintiff to demonstrate (1) the existence of a \nmunicipal custom or policy and (2) a direct and causal link between the custom or policy \nand the violation alleged. Jenkins v. Wood, 81 F.3d 988, 993 (10th Cir. 1996). Indeed, \nto adequately allege municipal liability, a plaintiff must state sufficient nonconclusory facts \non: “(1) official policy or custom, (2) causation, and (3) state of mind.” Schneider v. City \nof Grand Junction Police Dep’t, 717 F.3d 760, 769 (10th Cir. 2013). \nCustom/Policy/Practice: an “official policy or custom” must take one of five forms: \n(1) a formal regulation or policy statement; (2) an informal custom amounting \nto a widespread practice that, although not authorized by written law or \nexpress municipal policy, is so permanent and well settled as to constitute a \ncustom or usage with the force of law; (3) the decisions of employees with \nfinal policymaking authority; (4) the ratification by such final policymakers of \nthe decisions—and the basis for them—of subordinates to whom authority \nwas delegated subject to these policymakers’ review and approval; or (5) the \nfailure to adequately train or supervise employees, so long as that failure \nresults from deliberate indifference to the injuries that may be caused. \n \nWaller, 932 F.3d at 1283; Bryson v. City of Okla. City, 627 F.3d 784, 788 (10th Cir. \n2010). Regardless of the plaintiffs’ specific municipal liability theory, the plaintiffs bear the \nburden to demonstrate the essential policy or custom. See Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at 403 \n(“In Monell and subsequent cases, we have required a plaintiff seeking to impose liability \non a municipality . . . to identify a municipal ‘policy’ or ‘custom’ that caused the plaintiff's \ninjury.”) (emphasis added)). The factual basis for an alleged policy or custom must consist \nof much more than what allegedly happened to the plaintiffs. E.g., Griego v. City of Alb., \n24 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 25 of 43\n \n100 F. Supp. 3d 1192, 1215 (D.N.M. 2015) (“[A]t the pleading stage, the existence of a \nMonell policy is a ‘conclusion’ to be built up to, rather than a ‘fact’ to be baldly asserted.”). \nA custom is a “persistent and widespread” practice which “constitutes the standard \noperating  procedure  of  the  local governmental entity.”  Mitchell  v.  City  & Cnty.  of \nDenver, 112 F. App’x 662, 672 (10th Cir. 2004). It may also be a series of decisions by a \nsubordinate official of which the supervisor must have been aware. City of St. Louis v. \nPraprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 130 (1988). Liability attaches in such a case because “the \nsupervisor could realistically be deemed to have adopted a policy that happened to have \nbeen formulated or initiated by a lower-ranking official.” Id. \n“Consistent with the plain meaning of ‘custom,’ proof of an isolated incident does \nnot show a custom.” King v. Glanz, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84927, at *4-5 (N.D. Okla. \nJune 23, 2014); see Lankford v. City of Hobart, 73 F.3d 283, 286 (10th Cir. 1996); \nGates v. Unified Sch. Dist. No. 449, 996 F.2d 1035, 1041 (10th Cir. 1993). Evidence of \nhow a municipality’s actors acted in just one case is insufficient to establish a persistent \nand widespread practice that is permanent and well settled (the high threshold necessary \nto succeed on a municipal liability claim). Henderson v. City & Cnty. of Denver, 2014 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 7140, *30 (D. Colo. Jan. 21, 2014); City of Okla. City v. Tuttle, 471 \nU.S. 808, 823-24 (1985) (“Proof of a single incident of unconstitutional activity is not \nsufficient to impose liability under Monell, unless proof of the incident includes proof that \nit was caused by existing, unconstitutional municipal policy.”). \nCausation: the entity, via “deliberate” conduct, must have been the “moving force” \nbehind the alleged injury, requiring both an action “taken with the requisite degree of \n25 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 26 of 43\n \nculpability” and a “direct causal link” between the action and the alleged deprivation of \nrights. Bd. of Cnty. Comm’rs v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 404 (1997); see Bryan Cnty., \n520 U.S. at 404; Canton, 489 U.S. at 385. And even if a constitutional violation occurred \nas purportedly alleged, no municipal liability is based on pure respondeat superior. See \nMonell, 436 U.S. at 694. Local governments are liable only for their own illegal acts. \nConnick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 51, 60 (2011). This causation requirement is satisfied \nif the plaintiffs show “the municipality was the ‘moving force’ behind the injury alleged.” \nBryan Cty., 520 U.S. at 404. As the Supreme Court has made increasingly clear over the \npast 40 years, proof of a policy claim requires a tight causal connection between the \nalleged policy and the constitutional injury. In Monell, the Court held a plaintiff had to \nidentify a causal nexus between his injury and the municipality’s alleged custom or policy. \nMonell, 436 U.S. at 693-94. And in City of Canton, the Court held a viable municipal \nliability claim required the identified deficiency in a city’s training program must be “closely \nrelated to the ultimate injury.” Canton, 489 U.S. at 391.  \nState of Mind: In addition, Plaintiffs must also establish the requisite degree of \nculpability on the County’s part – namely, the alleged municipal practices were carried \nout with “deliberate indifference” to their known or obvious consequences. City of Canton \nv. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 388 (1989); Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at 400. The prevailing state-\nof-mind  standard  for  entity  liability  in  the  Tenth  Circuit  is  deliberate  indifference \n“regardless of the nature of the underlying constitutional violation.” Schneider, 717 F.3d \nat 771 n.5. Importantly, for a conditions of confinement case like the above-captioned \naction, deliberate indifference “is defined differently for Eighth Amendment and municipal \n26 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 27 of 43\n \nliability purposes.” Barney v. Pulsipher, 143 F.3d 1299, 1307 n.5 (10th Cir. 1998). The \ndeliberate indifference standard for prison conditions is a subjective standard, requiring \n“actual knowledge of a risk by the official.” Id. Deliberate indifference for municipal liability, \nin stark contrast, is an objective standard and requires a risk to be “so obvious that the \nofficial [or the entity] should have known of it.” Id. That is, to even get to the merits of an \nEighth Amendment claim, Plaintiffs must hurdle an extremely high threshold bar. \nF.  Alleged Violation of the Centers for Disease Control Social Distancing or Other \nGuidelines Is Not the Equivalent of a Violation of the United States Constitution \n \nThe entire thrust of Plaintiffs’ Motion is an effort to establish the Sheriff and the \nWCJ allegedly failed to adhere to the social distancing and other guidelines set by the \nCDC. [See generally ECF 1]. This Court must reject Plaintiffs’ effort to constitutionalize \nthe CDC guidelines. The issue before this Court is not whether the Sheriff and the WCJ \nare adhering to the CDC guidelines—although as the Sheriff’s Declaration establishes, \nthey are, to the best of their abilities based on the realities of the daily operations of a \njail—but rather, whether the customs, policies and procedures of the WCJ implemented \nby the Sheriff to address COVID-19 violate the United States Constitution. \nIt has long been the law that a violation of agency policy, regulation, rule, training, \nor practice—from any agency—is not the equivalent of a violation of constitutional rights. \nSee, e.g., Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 193-96 (1984); Tanberg v. Sholtis, 401 F.3d \n1151, 1159-60 (10th Cir. 2005); Herring v. Keenan, 218 F.3d 1171, 1180 (10th Cir. \n2000); Wilson v. Meeks, 52 F.3d 1547, 1554 (10th Cir. 1995); Giannetti v. City of \nStillwater, 216 F. App’x 756, 766 (10th Cir. 2007). No reasoned difference exists to \ndistinguish the CDC’s COVID-19 social distancing and other guidelines from the above \n27 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 28 of 43\n \nprecedent. This Court must focus not on whether the current operations of the WCJ are \ncompliant with the CDC or other health and safety guidelines, but whether they violate \nthe inmates’ constitutional rights—two altogether different inquiries. \nG. Plaintiffs Have Not Met and Cannot Meet the Legal Requirements Necessary for \ntheir Requested Injunctive Relief in the Form of a TRO Here as a Matter of Law. \n \nKeeping all the above principles in mind, as the Court must, Plaintiffs have not \nsatisfied and cannot satisfy any of the four elements necessary to grant injunctive relief. \nThus, this Court should deny Plaintiffs’ Motion and deny the sought-after injunctive relief \nin the form of a TRO and of an expedited hearing. \n1.  Plaintiffs have no likelihood of success on the merits whatsoever.10 \nPlaintiffs’ two claims against the Sheriff are brought in his official capacity. These \nclaims are therefore asserted against Weld County. See Layton, 512 F. App'x at 867 n.4. \nWhile ECF 1 discusses the merits of Plaintiffs’ claimed constitutional deprivation, ECF 1 \nomits any discussion or argument as to municipal liability. This is fatal, as Plaintiffs did \nnot even attempt to show they are likely to succeed on a municipal liability claim.  \nThe Court need not even consider this flaw, however, because Plaintiffs cannot \nprove an underlying deprivation of constitutional rights. See Ellis v. Ogden City, 589 F.3d \n1099, 1104 (10th Cir. 2009) (municipal “liability will not attach ‘where there was no \nunderlying constitutional violation by any of [the municipality’s] officers.’”) (quoting Graves \n                                            \n10 Plaintiff Ward and Plaintiff Propes have been released from the WCJ due to the \nnatural expiration of their confinement under statute and caselaw. Longstanding Tenth \nCircuit precedent which this Court must follow dictates their claims for injunctive relief (the \nonly type of relief sought in ECF 1) are moot without possibility of resurrection. E.g., \nGreen v. Branson, 108 F.3d 1296, 1300 (10th Cir. 1997). \n28 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 29 of 43\n \nv. Thomas, 450 F.3d 1215, 1218 (10th Cir. 2006) (alteration in original)). Applying the \nEighth Amendment deliberate indifference standard makes this clear, for two reasons. \nFirst, the Sheriff recognizes the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic and the \npotential of the virus to cause a serious health condition if a person falls ill. To the Sheriff’s \nknowledge, none of the Plaintiffs have been sick with COVID-19 or are sick with COVID-\n19. For simplicity and efficiency, however, the Sheriff is not contesting the objective factor \nof the Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference standard purely for purposes of this \nResponse, but the Sheriff reserves the right to do so later in the proceedings. \nSecond, the Sheriff was not deliberately indifferent. The WCSO and its leader \nhave taken the COVID-19 crisis quite seriously and implemented many new processes \nand procedures to protect jail staff and inmates, as more fully described in the Sheriff’s \nDeclaration.  [See  Exh.  A  and  its  attachments].  Contrary  to  Plaintiffs’  hyperbolic \nassertions, the Sheriff is and has been aware of the dangers posed by COVID-19, and it \nis precisely because the Sheriff has been aware of those dangers the WCSO acted \nquickly and decisively to implement these policies and procedures beginning as far back \nas February 2020. Because the Sheriff “[took] reasonable efforts to avoid or alleviate that \nharm, [the Sheriff] bears no liability under this standard.”  Despain, 264 F.3d at 975. \nDespain requires reasonable efforts, and the Court must evaluate the actions of the \nSheriff and the WCSO in the context of what reasonably can be achieved within a jail. It \nis undisputed a jail cannot be expected to replicate the conditions of a hospital.11 \n                                            \n11 Although even hospitals have been forced to adapt to provide care to COVID-\n19 patients. See, e.g., Madeline Holcombe, Holly Yan and Eric Levenson, New York’s \nCentral Park and harbor are now home to makeshift hospitals, CNN, March 30, 2020, \n29 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 30 of 43\n \nThe following represents but a fraction of the many new policies and procedures \nwhich the Sheriff and the WCSO put in place to protect staff and inmates from COVID-19 \nin  the  WCJ,  as  more  fully  detailed  in  Exh.  A  and  its  attachments  which  must  be \nconsidered as a whole (citations are noted parenthetically by page and paragraph): \n•  The WCSO implemented multiple policies to allow for social distancing, within the \nphysical limits allowed by WCJ population and its physical plant: March 13, 2020 \nlimits on outside visitors (pp. 7-8, ¶¶ 22-23); multiple iterations of social distancing \nguidelines for WCSO staff (p. 8, ¶ 25; p. 12, ¶ 44; pp. 13-14, ¶ 49); reduced inmate \nreclassification (p. 19, ¶ 79); and March 31, 2020, transmission of a then-current \nlist of all inmates for sentence review to the Chief Judge for the Nineteenth Judicial \nDistrict of Colorado (p. 16, ¶ 65). \n•  The WCJ employs a professional janitorial staff which has been cleaning and \nsanitizing, and continues to clean and sanitize, the WCJ (p. 25, ¶ 109); all library \nbooks are now cleaned and sanitized after each use (p. 15, ¶ 56); common-use \nfixtures, such as water fountains, are sanitized multiple times per day (p. 22, ¶ 93); \nand the WCJ both directed inmates to clean and sanitize toilets before and after \neach use and provided supplies for that purpose (p. 22, ¶ 94). \n•  The WCJ has provided to inmates free of charge, continues to provide to inmates \nfree of charge, and will continue to provide to inmates free of charge, sanitation \nsupplies like soap and cleaner (p. 21, ¶ 91); and on February 27, 2020, perceiving \n                                            \navailable  at:  https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/us/new-york-coronavirus-cases-deaths/ \nindex.html (last visited April 11, 2020). \n30 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 31 of 43\n \nthe potential future risk which COVID-19 might pose to the jail, the WCJ began \ndoubling its normal order of Clorox wipes and hand sanitizer (p. 3, ¶ 10). \n•  The WCJ attempted to procure masks for inmates for weeks, but they proved \ndifficult to obtain (p. 8, ¶ 24; p. 14, ¶ 50); and after nearly a month of trying to obtain \nmasks, the WCJ received a shipment on April 8, 2020, and immediately distributed \nmasks to all inmates, along with guidance on proper use of masks (p. 20, ¶ 83). \n•  On March 11, 2020, the WCSO instructed Aramark, its food services vendor, to \ndevelop a plan in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak at the jail, and the WCSO \nreceived that plan from Aramark on March 13, 2020 and verbally requested on \nMarch 30, 2020 that Aramark plan to implement it if necessary (p. 6, ¶ 17; p. 7, \n¶ 21; p. 16, ¶ 62); on April 6, 2020, the WCJ began requiring inmate trustees, who \nwork in multiple functions in the jail including food preparation, to have their \ntemperature taken before work and to wear masks while working (p. 20, ¶ 81). \n•  On March 10, 2020, the WCSO requested its medical services vendor to prepare \nscreening tools for COVID-19 for deputies to ask all new arrivals during booking \n(pp. 4-5, ¶ 14); on March 11-12, 2020, WCSO implemented a screening and \nisolation protocol for COVID-19 (pp. 5-6, ¶ 15); on March 16, 2020, well before \nthere were any positive COVID-19 tests in the WCJ, the WCSO set aside areas of \nthe WCJ for “screening pods” or multi-day observation of new arrivals (p. 9, ¶ 30); \nafter the WCJ identified its first suspected COVID-19 case in an inmate on March \n19, 2020, all other occupants of the inmate’s unit were screened (pp. 11-12, ¶ 43); \nafter the first positive COVID-19 test of an inmate on March 31, 2020, the WCJ \n31 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 32 of 43\n \nimplemented multiple policies to quarantine the podmates of that inmate in the \nsame pod (pp. 17-18, ¶ 68); and the WCSO placed the entire WCJ population on \nlockdown on April 1, 2020, to reduce any spread of COVID-19 (p. 18, ¶ 69). \n•  Inmates continue to have the same access to media as they have always had (pp. \n23-24, ¶ 103); on April 9, 2020, the WCSO posted reminders of COVID-19 related \ninformation (p. 20, ¶ 84); and on April 10, 2020, each inmate was given a flyer on \nCDC-recommendations for how to use masks (p. 21, ¶ 87). \nThis summary includes only a portion of the steps the Sheriff and the WCSO have \ntaken to protect the health and safety of inmates and staff at the WCJ. The Sheriff’s well-\ndocumented actions to combat COVID-19 are significantly more credible than Plaintiffs’ \nown Declarations, which allege vague and unsupported concerns. The Sherriff asks the \nCourt to review his entire Declaration and all attachments. After doing so, the Court must \nconclude  the  Sheriff  was  not  deliberately  indifferent  under  the  Eighth  Amendment \nstandard. Plaintiffs have not, cannot, and will not prove any constitutional deprivation. \nMore fundamentally, regarding the municipal liability standard which as a matter \nof law undisputedly applies here, Plaintiffs have made no showing the County is liable. \nECF 1 does not specifically articulate which of the five established theories of municipal \nliability on which Plaintiffs rely, see Section V.E supra; it does not address how the Sheriff \nwas deliberately indifferent under the municipal liability standard; and it does not address \nhow any custom, practice, or policy of the Sheriff was the moving force behind Plaintiffs’ \nasserted  constitutional  violations.  In  other  words,  Plaintiffs  blithely  ignore  municipal \nliability entirely, though the only claims Plaintiffs brought are municipal liability claims. \n32 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 33 of 43\n \nThe Sheriff does not know which theory Plaintiffs would put forth for municipal \nliability and will not speculate about the relative merits of any potential theories here. But \nas the Sheriff’s Declaration, its attachments, and the above summary thereof show, the \nSheriff and WCSO decisionmakers were not deliberately indifferent, categorically, to \nobvious risks to inmates. To the contrary, relevant decisionmakers acted early and often \nto ensure a reasonably safe environment within a jail setting. Given the multiple policies \nand actions taken to address COVID-19 in the WCJ, no potential municipal liability theory \ncould succeed as the moving force behind a constitutional deprivation for Plaintiffs. \nPlaintiffs have not made any showing of why they are likely to succeed on their \nmunicipal liability claims, let alone the “strong showing” required for this Court to grant \ndisfavored injunctive relief. Plaintiffs are quite unlikely to prevail on the merits at all, much \nless marshal the required showing of a “substantial” likelihood of success on the merits. \n2.  For purposes of this Response, the Sheriff does not contest the prospect of \nirreparable injury which might result from COVID-19 as a general matter. \n \nThe Sheriff acknowledges falling ill with COVID-19 poses real and serious health \nrisks to many people worldwide, including Plaintiffs. To the Sheriff’s knowledge, however, \nnone of the Plaintiffs is sick with COVID-19. For simplicity and efficiency, however, the \nSheriff is not contesting this factor for the purposes of this Response, but reserves the \nright to do so later in the proceedings. \n3.  The threatened injury does not outweigh potential harm to WCJ and WCSO. \nPlaintiffs argue there is no identifiable harm to the WCJ or WCSO, except minor \nadministrative costs. [ECF 1, at 50]. This is entirely incorrect for several reasons. First, \nthe WCSO assuredly has a strong and judicially recognized interest in maintaining control \n33 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 34 of 43\n \nover the WCJ without Court supervision. E.g., Overton, 539 U.S. at 132; Bell, 441 U.S. \nat 547-48. Mandatory injunctive relief would necessitate ongoing Court supervision to \nassure the WCSO is abiding by any order. SCFC ILC, 936 F.2d at 1099. The WCSO \nwould thus lose the ability to react quickly to changes in circumstances in the WCJ and \nwould have to go to the Court for approval continuously, as the WCJ adapts to the \nevolving COVID-19 crisis and public health recommendations. Second, the multiple forms \nof injunctive relief Plaintiffs request, see [ECF 1, at 6-7], would require the WCSO to take \nmany separate actions, the cost and implementation of which are ambiguous. Plaintiffs \nhave not addressed how the Court could, for instance, order a third-party vendor of \nprofessional cleaners with no correctional experience to work in a secure facility such as \na jail. How quickly would the cleaners have to be hired? Would there be adequate time to \nvet them for security risks? Would the WCSO be liable if the cleaners were negligent in \ncleaning  and  sanitizing? Would Weld  County  taxpayers  be  required  to  pay  for  the \ncleaners? And what about the already-employed professional cleaning staff, would they \nhave to be kept on payroll while displaced by this third-party vendor yet have the County \ncontinue paying the payroll costs of wages and benefits due County employees? \nPlaintiffs also fail to address whether they are asking the Court to order the WCSO \nto provide each inmate only one mask or a separate mask for each day. As the Court is \nno doubt aware, there is a nationwide shortage of personal protective equipment (“PPE”), \nincluding masks.12 While the WCSO has worked for weeks to locate PPE—with quite a \n                                            \n12 See Olga Khazan, Why We’re Running out of Masks, The Atlantic, April 10, \n2020,  available  at  https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/why-were-\nrunning-out-of-masks-in-the-coronavirus-crisis/609757/ (last visited April 11, 2020). \n34 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 35 of 43\n \nfew staff members even using homemade masks to conserve WCJ mask supply for \ninmates, see [Exh. A, p. 24 ¶ 104], the WCSO faces the same hurdles as the rest of the \nUnited States in locating and obtaining PPE supplies. Similarly, Plaintiffs fail to address \nhow the WCJ could implement policies enforcing social distancing at all times yet guard \nagainst the additional liability the WCSO presumably and otherwise would be alleged to \nbear for using varying levels of force in carrying out those Court-ordered policies. \n  As even these few considerations show, Plaintiffs fail to show their interests \noutweigh the alarming potential of damage to the WCSO, for the very simple reason it did \nnot occur to Plaintiffs to realistically consider the potential damage to the WCSO. And \nPlaintiffs certainly have not made the “strong showing” required for the Court to grant this \ndisfavored injunctive relief. The Court must conclude Plaintiffs have not met their burden \non this “balance of harms” factor. \n4.  Plaintiffs’ requested injunctive relief would be adverse to the public interest \nbecause it unreasonably threatens public safety. \n \nThe PLRA requires this Court to “give substantial weight to any adverse impact on \npublic safety” in considering injunctive relief that would release prisoners. 18 U.S.C. § \n3626(a)(2); see also Section V.A supra. Plaintiffs disregarded this requirement and do not \ndiscuss  public  safety  or  acknowledge  public  safety  risks  at  any  point.  Given  the \narchitectural and staffing realities of the WCJ, it is neither possible nor advisable for the \nWCSO to patrol the WCJ to ensure all inmates are at least six feet from all other people \nat all times. Plaintiffs ask, in the alternative, this Court order prisoners released from the \nWCJ. [ECF 1, at 7]. Beyond the multiple legal impediments to such an order, see Sections \nV.A & V.D supra, releasing inmates would create an unjustifiable public safety risk. To be \n35 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 36 of 43\n \nblunt, there are very good reasons Colorado state judges determined WCJ inmates \nshould be confined there and not remain at liberty in the community. A review of the public \nsafety risks which Plaintiffs themselves pose merely underscores this overriding concern: \n•  Plaintiff Carranza is currently held in the WCJ on a $1,000 cash or surety bond, \nfacing a charge of assault in the third degree, pursuant to C.R.S. § 18-3-204. Mr. \nCarranza has failed to appear or failed to comply with court orders six times. His \nprior criminal history includes arrests for burglary, possession of a controlled \nsubstance, forgery, and a sentence to the Colorado Department of Corrections and \nlater arrest for a parole violation, among other arrests. Given his poor record of \ncompliance with court orders and his prior criminal history, he poses a significant \ncommunity safety risk. This is perhaps why Colorado state judges have already \ndenied two motions for bond modification from Mr. Carranza, filed March 16 and \n23, 2020. See Exhibit A-40 for further information on Mr. Carranza. \n•  Plaintiff Martinez is currently held on three separate bonds: a $70,000 cash or \nsurety bond for a charge of escape, a $50,000 cash or surety bond for a controlled \nsubstance charge, and a $10,000 cash or surety bond for a charge of vehicular \neluding. Mr. Martinez has failed to appear or failed to comply with court orders 10 \ntimes.  His  prior  criminal  history  includes  arrests  for  vehicular  eluding  and \npossession of a controlled substance, a bond violation, and a sentence to the \nColorado Department of Corrections and later arrest for a parole violation, among \nother arrests. Given Mr. Martinez’s record of noncompliance with court orders, his \ncurrent charge of escape, and his prior criminal history, Mr. Martinez presents an \n36 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 37 of 43\n \nunjustifiable community safety risk. This likely explains why Colorado state judges \nhave required and aggregate $130,000 in cash or surety bonds. See Exhibit A-41 \nfor further information on Mr. Martinez. \n•  Plaintiff Barnum is currently held in the WCJ on a $25,000 cash or surety bond, \nfacing a charges of assault in the first degree, pursuant to C.R.S. § 18-3-202, \nalleging he intentionally caused serious bodily injury to another with a deadly \nweapon, a statutory crime of violence under Colorado law requiring a sentence to \nthe Colorado Department of Corrections of between 10 and 32 years. See id. § 18-\n1.3-406. Mr. Barnum has failed to appear or failed to comply with court orders \nthirteen times. His prior criminal history includes six prior arrests for driving under \nthe influence and a sentence to the Colorado Department of Corrections for theft, \namong other arrests. The serious nature of his current charge and its mandatory \nprison sentence, Mr. Barnum’s poor record of compliance with court orders, and \nthe significant public safety risk posed by multiple DUI offenders make him a \nsignificant and unjustifiable public safety risk. He sought a bond modification with \nthe Colorado state court and has a bond hearing scheduled for April 15, 2020. See \nExhibit A-42 for further information on Mr. Barnum. \n•  Plaintiff Lewis is currently held in the WCJ on a $500 cash only bond, facing a \nfelony charge of driving under the influence with three or more prior convictions, \npursuant to C.R.S. § 42-4-1301, obstructing a peace officer, and possession of a \ncontrolled substance, among other charges. He is also held on a $1,000 cash only \nbond, facing an allegation that he failed to comply with probation. Mr. Lewis has \n37 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 38 of 43\n \nfailed to appear or failed to comply with court orders five times. His prior criminal \nhistory includes four prior arrests for driving under the influence, multiple prior \ncontrolled substance related arrests, and an arrest for vehicular eluding, among \nother arrests. Despite Mr. Lewis’s poor record of compliance with court orders and \nthe significant public safety risk of multiple DUI offenders, especially those who \nelude peace officers, a Colorado state court judge reduced Mr. Lewis’s original \n$60,000 cash bond to the current $1,000 cash bond. See Exhibit A-43 for further \ninformation on Mr. Lewis. \n•  Plaintiff Ward has been released from the WCJ. See Green, 108 F.3d at 1296. \n•  Plaintiff Propes has been released from the WCJ. See Green, 108 F.3d at 1296. \n•  Plaintiff Hunter is currently serving a jail sentence for possession of a weapon by \na previous offender, a charge necessarily requiring a prior felony conviction. See \nC.R.S. § 18-12-108. His scheduled release date is  April 26, 2020. He has a \nsentence reconsideration hearing scheduled for Tuesday, April 14, 2020. See \nExhibit A-46 for further information on Mr. Hunter. \nAs  this  information  shows,  releasing  Plaintiffs—at  least  those  who  are  even  still \ndetained—into the Weld County community before a Colorado state court judge has \ndetermined they should be released would pose an unjustifiable community safety risk. \nThe community should not be forced to bear the risk of violent offenders, multiple DUI \noffenders, and offenders who consistently and repeatedly fail to comply with court orders. \nPlaintiffs’ assertion they are at risk of sickness and death in the WCJ does not outweigh \nthe proven threat to community safety of all Plaintiffs who remain housed within the WCJ. \n38 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 39 of 43\n \nMoreover, this Court should be mindful of comity and federalism, see Section V.D \nsupra, and should be loath to override public safety decisions made by Colorado state \ncourt judges, who have substantially more information available to them about individual \ninmates in the WCJ than does this Court, as this Court is well aware from its own \nexperience making similar release decisions in the federal system. \nFinally, the COVID-19 crisis has impacted law enforcement as it has every other \nsector of society. The additional strain upon law enforcement’s already heavy burden \nduring this crisis of releasing dangerous offenders in the community is not in the public \ninterest.  In  summary,  the  public  safety  risk  of  Plaintiffs’  sought-after  relief  strongly \noutweighs Plaintiffs’ interest in the relief, meaning Plaintiffs won’t prevail on this factor. \n5.  If the Court orders injunctive relief, significant security should be required. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 65(c) allows the Court to order a security as a condition of any \ninjunctive relief “to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been \nwrongfully enjoined or restrained.” The Sheriff asserts any injunctive relief, in the form of \na TRO or otherwise, is manifestly inappropriate. But if the Court does order relief, the \nWCSO may have significant costs to bear—costs which ultimately would be borne by \nWeld County taxpayers. Thus, to compensate those taxpayers for potentially improvident \nrelief, the Court should order posting of a security interest of at least $500,000.13 \n                                            \n13 As stated in the Sheriff’s Declaration, the WCJ’s year-to-date net operating cost \nthrough February 29, 2020 is $77,470 daily, which is the best available figure the Sheriff \ncould give the Court as of April 13, 2020, given data entry limitations. [ECF 1, at 25 ¶ \n113]. Multiplying this figure by the 14 days for which a TRO would be active comes out to \na total of $1,084,580. Although imposition of a security posting requirement of even less \nthan half of such a figure in this case still may seem harsh, it would be equally harsh to \nsaddle Weld County taxpayers with the costs of improvidently granted injunctive relief. \n39 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 40 of 43\n \nThis security would account for a wide range of potential (or likely) costs of the \nrequested injunctive relief, such as: hiring an outside cleaning company to clean the jail \neach day; keeping the already-existing County janitorial staff on payroll and benefits while \nthis third-party vendor does their job; moving more deputies into the jail to enforce inmate \nsocial distancing, thereby reducing law enforcement presence in the community; paying \nthe exorbitant cost for already-existent PPE on primary or secondary markets, if the PPE \nis to be replaced daily; locating and paying for alternate locations to house inmates (if \nthey even exist at this point), such as other jails, if the court orders a reduction in inmate \nnumbers in the WCJ, as the WCSO cannot lawfully release inmates from custody; \ndefending potential lawsuits based on excessive force, prison conditions, or other claims, \nand on sanctions for violating victim rights, caused by compliance with the Court’s Order. \nMoreover, as discussed above, several Plaintiffs have cash or surety bonds which \nColorado state judicial officers have been unwilling to remove, and the Colorado Supreme \nCourt recently denied a strikingly similar request to order the mass and immediate release \nof persons in county jails due to the pandemic.14 Granting injunctive relief without security \nwould be an end run around those bonds, as it could require Plaintiffs’ release without \npayment of security,  contravening the considered judgment of Colorado state court \njudges. For all these reasons, if the Court grants injunctive relief despite the many weighty \narguments, authorities, exhibits, and explanation the Sheriff has provided the Court here, \nthe Court should require Plaintiffs to post a security interest of at least $500,000. \n                                            \n14 See dockets in Colo. Sup. Ct. Nos. 2020SA116 (and Apr. 3, 2020 Order), \n2020SA117 (and Apr. 3, 2020 Order), of which the Court can take judicial notice. \n40 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 41 of 43\n \n6.  Other legal considerations weigh against granting injunctive relief. \nFirst, a temporary restraining order is appropriate only if “specific facts in an \naffidavit or a verified complaint clearly show that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, \nor damage will result to the movant before the adverse party can be heard in opposition.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(1)(A). Plaintiffs offered the Court neither affidavits signed by all \nPlaintiffs directly nor a verified complaint signed by all Plaintiffs directly. And besides, the \nCourt must assess their claimed entitlement to a TRO and emergency hearing in light of \nthe state of the facts as of today April 13, 2020, not as of April 7, 2020. \nSecond, Plaintiffs’ sought-after injunctive relief would place the Sheriff between a \nproverbial  Scylla  and  Charybdis.  The  Sheriff  would  be  forced  to  choose  between \ncomplying with the narrowness of Colorado state law on detaining inmates pursuant to \nColorado state court orders, see Section V.D supra, and complying with the breadth of \nthis Court’s orders potentially requiring the release of those inmates. Where an entity \ndefendant like the Sheriff would be “whipsaw[ed]” into attempting to comply with two \nconflicting directives issued by two different courts, as here, temporary injunctive relief is \nespecially inappropriate. Bayaud Enters. v. United States Dep’t of Veteran’s Affairs, \n2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97303, at *15-16 (D. Colo. June 10, 2019) (Krieger, S.J.). \nThird, the PLRA’s multiple requirements for injunctive relief as to prisoners such \nas Plaintiffs and the rest of their WCJ co-inmates, see Section V.A supra, significantly \nweigh against granting Plaintiffs a TRO or other injunctive relief. Granting the relief in \ncontravention of the PLRA’s plain requirements likely would be reversible error, and the \nCourt should decline Plaintiffs’ invitation to meander into the buzzsaw of reversible error. \n41 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 42 of 43\n \nVI.  CONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs would have this Court, and the public, believe the Sheriff is plucking his \nStradivarius gleefully while the Weld County Jail and its inmates succumb to COVID-19.15 \nHowever,  as  the  above  authorities,  analysis,  exhibits,  and  explanation  demonstrate \nforcefully, such a characterization is far from the actual truth. Rather, the evidence \npresented in and along with this Response demonstrates the Sheriff and the Weld County \nSheriff’s Office have diligently, comprehensively, and appropriately addressed COVID-19 \nat the Weld County Jail. Every day, Weld County Jail personnel balance the needs of \nsafety and security with the health needs of all the inmates in the Jail and themselves. \nIn conclusion, for the foregoing reasons, Defendant Sheriff Steven Reams, as the \nduly elected Sheriff for the County of Weld, State of Colorado, respectfully requests this \nCourt enter an Order: denying Plaintiffs’ application for a temporary restraining order and \nexpedited hearing in this matter; and granting all other relief deemed just and proper. \nRespectfully submitted this 13th day of April, 2020. \ns/ Matthew J.

I have personal knowledge of the matters set forth in this Declaration.\n2. I currently serve as the duly elected Sheriff for the County of Weld, State of\nColorado. I have served in this position for a total of five (5) years. \n3. Before beginning my tenure as Weld County Sheriff on January 25, 2015, I was\nemployed with the Weld County Sheriff’s Office (“WCSO”) for eighteen (18) prior years \nand served in many positions: master control operator, Detentions Division officer, patrol \ndeputy after earning Peace Officer Standards Training (“POST”) certification, detective, \n1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 28\n \ncommander, Detentions Division deputy bureau chief, Patrol Division deputy bureau \nchief, Public Safety bureau chief, and Detentions Division bureau chief. \n4.  I  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  criminal  justice  from  Colorado  Technical \nUniversity in 2007, and I also completed the FBI National Academy in 2007. \nSUBSTANTIAL STEPS WHICH WCSO TOOK TO COMBAT COVID-19 \n5.  I am individually familiar with the protocols and processes which the WCSO as \na whole generated, implemented, and refined in response to the global, national, and \nlocal public health threat posed by the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”), because I was \npersonally involved in generating, implementing, refining, and approving such protocols \nand processes in consultation with a team of WCSO staff and local public health officials. \n6.  Such protocols and processes also incorporated national guidelines from the \nfederal Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”), and state directives from the Colorado \nDepartment of Public Health and Environment (“CDPHE”), among others.  I am not aware \nof  any  specific  guidelines  adopted  by  any  federal  or  state  public  health  authority \nspecifically  governing  how  COVID-19  should  be  addressed  in  a  correctional facility \nsetting. All decisions I have made and the WCSO has adopted at the Weld County Jail \n(“WCJ”) related to the COVID-19 pandemic have been made based on an assessment of \nthe  health  and  safety  needs  of  the  inmates  and  detainees  (hereinafter  collectively \n“inmates”), WCSO employees, and the public. All decisions I have made and the WCSO \nhas adopted at the WCJ related to the COVID-19 pandemic have also been made based \non the distinct operational needs of a jail; the physical plant, structure, and layout of WCJ; \nand the resources and supplies available to the WCSO. As this Declaration establishes, \nI and the WCSO continue to evaluate and respond to different events  which have \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 28\n \noccurred since COVID-19 became an issue for the WCSO generally and at the WCJ \nspecifically and we will continue to do so. \n7.  Prior to February 27, 2020, the WCSO became aware of the growing number \nof COVID-19 infections which were occurring worldwide, although as yet there were fewer \nthan 20 reported positive infection tests in the United States1 and Weld County had not \nyet experienced any reported cases of COVID-19. \n8.  Thereafter the WCSO took substantial steps to generating, implementing, and \nrefining such protocols and processes in a manner intended to protect the health and \nsafety of WCJ inmates, WCSO personnel, and the Weld County public. \n9.  On February 27, 2020, I directed the WCSO Detentions Division Captain and \nthe Administrative Division Captain to review the WCSO’s policies on Inmate Screening \nand Evaluations and on Communicable Diseases, and to begin to update them as \nneeded, in the event there was an outbreak of COVID-19 either in Weld County proper \nor the WCJ and for the WCSO to be positioned to respond in a manner most protective \nof the health and safety of WCJ inmates, WCSO personnel, and the Weld County public. \nThese two captains confirmed to me they followed my directive. \n10. Also on February 27, 2020, the WCSO began doubling its usual order of \nClorox wipes, toilet paper, and hand sanitizer for use at the WCJ, because the WCSO \nperceived national trends which might lead to a shortage of such items and the WCSO \nwanted to do everything it could to ensure sufficient supply on hand. \n                                            \n1 See, e.g., https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-\nus.html#2019coronavirus-summary (last visited April 13, 2020). \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 28\n \n11. On March 4, 2020, the Weld County Department of Human Resources in \nconsultation with Weld County Health Department (“WCHD”) sent a lengthy substantive \nemail to all Weld County staff advising them, although neither the State of Colorado nor \nWeld County experienced any reported cases of COVID-19, certain additional safety \nprecautions must be taken by all Weld County employees (inclusive of WCSO), including: \nfrequent cleaning of hands by washing them or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer \nwhen soap and water are not available; covering noses and mouths when coughing and \nsneezing; avoiding close contact with those exhibiting cold or flu-like symptoms; and \nstaying home from their duties if they show symptoms of any sickness. [See Exh. A-1.] \n12. On  March  5,  2020,  at  my  direction,  WCSO  Captains  began  planning \ncontingencies for the potential effect of COVID-19 on the WCSO and its operations, \nincluding the operations of the WCJ. \n13. On March 6, 2020, WCSO leadership collaborated with Jon Echols, President \nof WCSO medical services vendor Turn Key Health Clinics (“TKHC”), on the development \nof screening tools and protocols for the WCJ’s anticipated response for COVID-19. This \nwas a preemptive response to what WCSO leadership believed would potentially be an \nurgent need in the coming weeks and to establish a collaborative reaction specific to the \nWCJ as to possible spread of COVID-19. I met separately with Mr. Echols to discuss and \nconfirm the same information with him which WCSO leadership just discussed with him. \n14. On March 10, 2020, the WCSO requested screening tools from TKHC for \nbooking deputies to utilize to ask questions of persons being booked at the WCJ related \nto risk factors of COVID-19 prior to admission to the WCJ, to secure the booking side of \nthe WCJ along with furnishment of a process for nursing staff intervention if the questions \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 28\n \nbeing posed to persons being booked received positive responses. The requested tools \nand processes were provided to the WCSO by TKHC and started to be used by booking \ndeputies in short order after receipt of those tools and processes. [See Exh. A-2.] \n15. On March 11, 2020, WCSO personnel sent a lengthy email to the County \nDepartment of Buildings and Grounds outlining the procedures which the WCSO intended \nto implement at the WCJ beginning March 12, 2020, including but not limited to: \na.  Enhanced arrest screening procedures, including questions related to \nsymptomology which if a positive response was generated would lead to the \nperforming of a more targeted assessment by medical staff to include isolation of \nthe arrestee from the rest of the WCJ population if it was determined appropriate \nfor the arrestee to be admitted to the WCJ; \nb.  Enhanced  in-custody  screening  procedures  by  which  any  and  all \ninmates  who  complained  of  symptoms  appearing  even  potentially  related  to \nCOVID-19 would be immediately screened by medical staff, and if medical staff \ndeemed such inmates were experiencing symptoms potentially related to COVID-\n19, such inmates would be immediately isolated per the “Respiratory Isolation \nPreparedness” protocol recommended by TKHC. \nc.  While isolated this way, inmates would be confined to “negative airflow” \nroom for a minimum of 14 days or otherwise in accordance with CDC guidelines, \nensuring no inmate would be held even in quarantine past mandatory release date; \nd.  If  the  number of  inmates  needing  to be  isolated due  to  COVID-19 \nexceeded the capacity of the negative airflow rooms, such inmates would all \ntransition to a housing unit designated as an isolation unit in which no inmates \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 28\n \nwould be permitted except those whom medical staff deemed to be experiencing \nsymptoms potentially related to COVID-19; and \ne.  The WCSO would cooperate fully with outside public entities, including \nmedical staff contacting appropriate public health authorities for various purposes, \nto include completion of proper testing for COVID-19, having on hand all needed \nequipment, and collaboration with local public health authorities. \n[See Exh. A-3.] The isolation protocol actually took effect March 11, 2020, a day earlier \nthan expected. All other foregoing steps were implemented as of March 12, 2020. \n16. Also on March 11, 2020, the WCSO posted a sign at its back gate advising \narrestees they would have to answer questions about recent travel outside of the United \nStates, which of course would place them at higher risk of infection for COVID-19 and, in \nconnection with this sign, directed control deputies to ask local law enforcement who \narrest individuals who are then typically placed in the WCJ to implement mandatory \narrestee questioning concerning travel outside of the United States in the prior 30 days \nto ensure a more targeted assessment and evaluation of such arrestees. [See Exh. A-4.] \n17. Also on March 11, 2020, the WCSO instructed Aramark, its food services \nvendor, to develop a plan for a decrease in its staff, or potentially a decrease in the Inmate \nTrustee population who assisted with food services, to ensure food services continued \nand still met all dietary standards in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak in the WCJ. \n18. On March 12, 2020, the WCSO updated its command staff contact list for \npurposes of preparing to check in with WCSO personnel who called in sick from work to \nensure adequate staffing of the WCJ. \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 28\n \n19. Also on March 12, 2020, the WCSO contacted the Weld County Office of \nEmergency Management (“WCOEM”) for guidance on cleaning out vehicles of WSCO \nPatrol Division personnel in which a suspected COVID-19-infected arrestee was present \nand guidance on appropriate PPE for Detentions Division personnel who would have to \nstaff any COVID-19 containment units which might be created at WCJ. [See Exh. A-5.] \n20. Also on March 12, 2020, the WCSO learned a North Colorado Medical Center \nemployee tested positive for COVID-19. The WCSO immediately issued guidance to its \nPatrol Division to take extra precautions for public health and safety, including ensuring \nPPE was present in all vehicles and keeping hands clean and away from one’s face. \n21. On March 13, 2020, the WCSO received from Aramark the safety plan which \nthe WCSO had requested to ensure continuity of service to inmates amid a pandemic yet \nensure protection of inmates and staff as much as reasonably possible. [See Exh. A-6.] \n22. Also on March 13, 2020, in an effort to implement social distancing guidelines \nwell  before  the  CDPHE  or  Colorado Governor  Jared  Polis  issued  any  guidance  or \ndirective on this topic, the WCSO suspended all religious volunteer activity for 30 days or \nuntil further notice to reduce the exposure of WCSO staff, inmates, and the general public. \nThis suspension, which is neutral and generally applicable, remains in effect today. \n23. Also on March 13, 2020, the WCSO suspended all professional visitor activity \ninside the WCJ except for attorney visits and people needing to conduct official law \nenforcement business and, subject to availability, permitted people outside of these two \nlimited  groups  to  meet  with  inmates  via  videoconference.  In  accordance  with  this \nsuspension, the WCSO also strongly encouraged attorneys and law enforcement to visit \nvia videoconference subject to availability but left the option open to meet in professional \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 28\n \nvisiting rooms if those individuals desired and implemented the provision of sanitizing \nsupplies for video equipment to professional visitors wanting to visit via video. The \npurpose of this protocol was to minimize unnecessary traffic in the WCJ to reduce the risk \nof  exposure  to  staff, inmates, and  the  general public  while  still  maintaining  access \nrequirements for attorneys and healthy business flow of operations. [See Exh. A-7.] \n24. Also on March 13, 2020, along with making efforts to source PPE on its own \nprior to and including March 13, 2020, the WCSO contacted WCOEM to request fifty (50) \nPPE masks for use in potential quarantine units within the WCJ. [See Exh. A-8.] \n25. Also on March 13, 2020, in an effort to implement social distancing guidelines \nwell before the CDPHE or Governor Polis issued any guidance or directive on this topic, \nthe WCSO published an internal notice to its Detentions Division advising of its efforts to \nprepare for any spread of COVID-19, including: a request to local law enforcement within \nWeld County to limit the number of arrestees for the foreseeable future and, if at all and \nas much as possible, issue a summons and release if the offense is not one for which \nWCJ confinement would be mandated by state statute; communication of the suspension \ndecisions as to religious volunteer activity and other-than-professional visits; leaving \nofficial uniforms at the WCJ to minimize contaminant exchange between home and the \nWCJ; recommending a pattern and practice of social distancing for all Detentions Division \npersonnel; and listing common symptoms of COVID-19 which may appear 2-14 days after \nexposure, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. [See Exh. A-9, Exh. A-10.] \n26. Also on March 13, 2020, the WCSO received a response from WCOEM as to \nits request for guidance on precautions for WCSO Patrol Division and Detentions Division \npersonnel  to  take  for  safety  of  arrestees,  inmates,,  among  others.  WCOEM \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 28\n \nrecommended: each WCSO Patrol Division vehicle be equipped with disposable gloves, \na disposable isolation gown, a NIOSH-approved particulate respirator (N-95 or higher-\nlevel respirator), and eye protection (goggles or disposable face shield fully covering front \nand sides of face); and Patrol Division and Inmate Transport vehicles be equipped with \nextra  masks  for  arrestees,  inmates,  to  use  while  in  the  vehicles,  along  with \ndecontamination of the vehicle after each such use using an EPA-approved cleaner. The \nWCSO began to implement these recommendations later that day. [See Exh. A-11.] \n27. Also on March 13, 2020, the WCSO generated a video briefing for Detentions \nDivision personnel who may not have read the internal notice published earlier in the day \nyet, to provide an advisement about the contents of said notice. [See Exh. A-12.] \n28. On March 14, 2020, WCSO ranking officers created a COVID-19-specific \nworking binder to ensure consistency of protocols and procedures between shifts. \n29. Also on March 14, 2020, the WCSO determined almost none of its personnel \nmet requirements for telework due to the need to maintain adequate staff for effective \nservice to inmates at the WCJ. \n30. On March 16, 2020, well before the WCSO had record of any staff, inmate, in \nthe WCJ either showing outward symptoms of or testing positive for COVID-19, the \nWCSO set aside portions of its facilities at the WCJ for “screening pods,” or transfer units \ninto which new arrestees would be housed for several days for observational purposes \nbefore being released to be housed in the WCJ general population. \n31. Also on March 16, 2020, to protect the health and safety of inmates in the \nWCJ,  the  WCSO  directed  the  substantial  limiting  of  Detentions  Division  personnel \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 28\n \nmovement within the WCJ by assigning such personnel to a single specific unit for a much \nlonger period of time. \n32. Also on March 16, 2020, in cooperation with the Weld County Public Defender \nOffice (“Weld PD”), the WCSO implemented the use of court phones for public defenders. \n33. Also on March 16, 2020, the WCSO issued an internal directive to all WCSO \npersonnel reiterating the need to practice social distancing, frequent handwashing, and \nimmediate contact of primary care provider if fever and cough existed. [See Exh. A-13.] \n34. Also  on  March  16,  2020,  the  WCSO  disseminated  a  Pandemic  Health \nEmergency and Public Health Order which issued from the WCDPHE Executive Director \nearlier on this day, which also included a supplemental transmission later on this day on \na ban of gatherings of more than 10 individuals, along with employee self-certification \nforms for all WCSO personnel to use relating to COVID-19 symptoms. [See Exh. A-14.] \n35. Also on March 16, 2020, the WCSO made plans to implement new printed \nCOVID-19-specific directives to inmates who were released from the WCJ in light of the \nWeld County Justice Services Department closing its lobbies. \n36. Also on March 16, 2020, the WCSO published an internal notice to all WCSO \npersonnel advising: modifications in communicating of shift briefings to ensure quicker \ntransmission of such information; reminding about Detentions Division personnel now \nbeing assigned to the same housing unit as much as reasonably possible until further \nnotice; taking steps to remain at the WCJ to eat meals during shifts. [See Exh. A-15.] \n37. On March 17, 2020, the WCSO published a notice to all inmates advising them \nthe WCJ facility limitations associated with COVID-19 would be deemed unable to be \ngrieved to ensure inmate health and safety. [See Exh. A-16.] \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 28\n \n38. Also on March 17, 2020, the WCSO received and implemented additional \nguidance from TKHC concerning more complete list of potential COVID-19 symptoms to \nobserve in inmates, and to contact medical staff immediately if any of the symptoms were \nobserved so WCJ medical professionals could make a medical judgment about whether \nthe inmate needed to be transported to the hospital to be evaluated and screened for their \nfitness to be in the WCJ population, including if an inmate registered a positive response \nto even one of several substantive screening questions, said inmate was to be given a \nmask immediately and immediately transported to an isolation cell. [See Exh. A-17.] \n39. Also on March 17, 2020, the WCSO issued a substantive explanation to the \nWeld PD explaining the reasons why an accusation the WCSO allegedly denied the Weld \nPD access to one of the Weld PD’s inmate clients was materially untruthful. \n40. Also on March 17, 2020, the WCSO issued an internal directive to all WCSO \nDetentions Division personnel reiterating the need to cooperate with counsel of record for \nWCJ  inmates,  whether  public  defenders  or  other  legal  representation,  and  issuing \nmultiple directives to WCSO staff to ensure such cooperation occurred. \n41. On March 18, 2020, the WCSO made the difficult decision to suspend its Jail \nBased Behavioral Services program until further notice due to sudden and extreme \nlimitations on community resources and cascading business closures. \n42. On March 19, 2020, the WCSO received communication from TKHC indicating \nTKHC was hiring “float nurses” for PRN purposes had a stockpile of face masks and latex \ngloves, and was constantly monitoring and following public health and safety guidelines. \n43. Also on March 19, 2020, the WCSO published an internal notice of its isolation \nand testing of its 1st suspected case of COVID-19 among WCJ inmates; the person had \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 28\n \na low-grade fever, non-productive cough, and several comorbidities; and the person’s \nentire housing unit was screened, person by person. [See Exh. A-18.] \n44. Also on March 19, 2020, the WCSO issued a supplemental social distancing \nand related restrictions directive to all WCSO personnel, including: limited interaction and \nalternating schedule from command staff, maintaining 6-foot distance from each other at \nall times and as much as reasonably possible; required washing of hands when entering \nand exiting units for any reason; restricting inmate movement between units as much as \nreasonably possible for purposes of inmate health and safety; forbidding inmate unit \nmixing during internal and medical transports; forbidding the use of gyms by inmates until \nfurther notice to limit the prospect of cross-contamination; requiring “hour outs” to be in \ngroups per booking date; and cleaning and sanitizing the “hour out” area after each group \nleaves and before the next group enters. [See Exh. A-19.] I personally also sent a notice \nto all chiefs of police within Weld County requesting, although Governor Polis’ order \nclosing bars and restaurants technically permitted arresting business owners or patrons \nwho did not comply with the order, that only summonses be issued as the WCSO wanted \nto conserve bed space for those truly in need of confinement. [See Exh. A-20.] \n45. On March 20, 2020, the WCSO learned multiple front range county detention \nfacilities, including Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Clear Creek, Douglas, El Paso, Fremont, \nGilpin, Jefferson, Kit Carson, Lincoln, Morgan, and Yuma Counties, would no longer be \naccepting transfer writs. \n46. Also on March 20, 2020, the WCSO published an internal notice of its isolation \nand testing of its 2nd and 3rd suspected case of COVID-19 among WCJ inmates; the 2nd \nperson  only  had  a  mid-range  fever  but  was  also  complaining  of  chest  pain  and \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 28\n \ntachycardia; the 3rd person had a non-productive cough, a fever, and body aches; both \npersons tested negative for the flu; and the entire housing units from which both of these \npersons came were screened, person by person. [See Exh. A-21.] And on March 20, \n2020, almost a week before Governor Polis issued the Stay At Home Order, I personally \nsent a notice to all chiefs of police within Weld County predicting the possibility of such \nan Order and requesting, though such an Order may technically permit arresting persons \nwho did not comply with it, that only summonses be issued as the WCSO wanted to \nconserve bed space for those truly in need of confinement. [See Exh. A-22.] \n47. On March 21, 2020, the WCSO published another internal directive on new \nguidelines for mental health services to inmates, including: assigning counselors to \nspecific units for general counseling and giving inmates self-help materials; suspending \nindividual counseling except where determined necessary by a Clinical Supervisor from \nmedical staff, and directing inmates to submit an Inmate Request Form if an urgent need \nexisted; providing a self-report questionnaire for inmates to complete and return in the \nevent a medication review was warranted to minimize face-to-face contact; and assigning \ndaily routine welfare checks to a specific non-designated counselor. [See Exh. A-23.] \n48. Also on March 21, 2020, the WCSO was notified of a possible COVID-19 \nexposure point in the POST certification academy, which suspended operations on March \n17, 2020, and advising all personnel must be vigilant to notice symptoms such as fever, \ncough, and shortness of breath, of which WCSO personnel were told. [See Exh. A-24.] \n49. On March 23, 2020, the WCSO issued another supplemental social distancing \nand related restrictions directive to all WCSO personnel, including: ensuring broadly to \nhouse inmates in a safe, humane, and wholesome environment; continuing to maintain a \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 28\n \n6-foot  distance  from  each  other  at  all  times  and  as  much  as  reasonably  possible; \nrescheduling  all  WCSO  personnel  meetings  to  be  done  via  Skype  call  or  video \nconference;  doing  everything  they  can  to  keep  the  inmate  population  healthy;  and \nadvising WCSO personnel would be subject to random interrogation to make sure they \nwere following social distancing guidelines. [See Exh. A-25.] \n50. Also on March 23, 2020, the WCSO ordered 500 surgical-quality masks from \nTKHC for persons who even potentially were exposed to COVID-19. [See Exh. A-26.] \n51. On March 24, 2020, the WCSO issued an internal directive about new COVID-\n19 guidelines for Inmate Classification Specialists, including sanitizing visiting kiosks after \neach inmate leaves and before the next one enters; and strategic selection of visiting \nkiosk to balance privacy concerns and social distancing guidelines. [See Exh. A-27.] \n52. On March 24, 2020, the WCSO received notification from the Chief Judge for \nthe 19th Judicial District of temporarily suspending execution on all writs issued to the \nWCSO by a 19th JD judicial officer to transport defendants and witnesses in all criminal, \ncivil, misdemeanor, and traffic cases between March 24, 2020, and May 15, 2020. \n53. On March 25, 2020, the WCSO issued another supplemental social distancing \nand related restrictions directive to all WCSO personnel. [See Exh. A-28.] \n54. On March 25, 2020, the WCSO received reports of three male inmates and \ntwo female inmates, recently booked into the WCJ, potentially being exposed to COVID-\n19 during a facility transfer unrelated to the WCSO. These five inmates were assessed \nby  medical  staff  immediately  and  were  observed  by  medical  staff  not  to  have  any \nsymptoms of COVID-19, be it fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Medical staff cleared \nall such inmates to remain in their living units. \n14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 28\n \n55. Also on March 25, 2020, the WCSO received a report of a WCSO deputy \ntesting positive for COVID-19, the first such instance within the WCSO. The WCSO \nimmediately issued an internal directive to all WCSO personnel advising of the positive \ntest,  reiterating  the  extreme  importance  of  maintaining  social  distancing  guidelines, \nproviding an official CDC link for staff to review to remind themselves of the possible \nsymptoms already communicated to them multiple times previously, and asking each \nWCSO employee to take their temperature before coming into work. [See Exh. A-29.] \n56. On March 26, 2020, the WCSO implemented a COVID-19-related procedure \nfor  the  use  and  sterilization  of  library  books  borrowed  by  WCJ  inmates,  including \nsanitizing books in a secure area in the WCJ after each book was returned as finished by \ninmates and before each book was returned to the WCJ library. [See Exh. A-30.] \n57. Also on March 27, 2020, TKHC advised the WCSO its prior order for 500 \nsurgical masks, which the WCSO made back on March 23, 2020, out of an abundance of \ncaution and out of concern for the health and safety of persons within the WCJ, had been \nseized by the government of China, which is where the masks were manufactured. THKC \nfurther advised it already was exploring alternative means of acquiring the masks and \nshipping them to the WCSO, and the WCSO also continued to explore ways to acquire \nthe masks in the event the alternative means did not result in a shipment. \n58. Also on March 27, 2020, the WCSO implemented a protocol to gather more \ninformation from personnel who called in sick, both to check on their welfare and to ensure \nadequate staff at the WCJ to maintain effective service to inmates. [See Exh. A-31.] \n59. Also on March 27, 2020, the WCSO learned of another inmate showing early \nsymptoms of possible COVID-19 infection, the WCSO immediately took the inmate to the \n15 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 28\n \nhospital, the entire pod was sanitized during night shift, and WCSO staff supervising this \nparticular pod were issued masks because they were a likely cross-contamination source \ndue to their ability to more freely travel between pods and common areas. \n60. On March 28, 2020, the WCSO learned of the first positive case of COVID-19 \nat the Weld County branch of Intervention Community Corrections Services. \n61. On March 29, 2020, the WCSO notified all its personnel of COVID-19 testing \nfacilities for symptomatic law enforcement of which it learned this day. \n62. On March 30, 2020, the WCSO received verbal notification from Aramark, in \nfollow-up concerning a request which the WCSO made on March 11, 2020, the WCSO \nverbally directed Aramark to put its “emergency menu” food safety plan to go into effect \nin the event sufficient inmate trustees were not available to assist in food preparation. \n63. Also on March 30, 2020, a male entered the WCSO public lobby and advised \nhe tested positive for COVID-19 but 19th Judicial still ordered him to report to the WCJ \nfor booking so he was coming to the WCJ to turn himself in. The WCSO immediately \ncontacted 19th Judicial and was able to obtain a personal recognizance bond for this \nmale so he could return to his home and self-quarantine like he was supposed to do. The \nmale never made it past the lobby, and the WCSO sanitized the lobby after he left. \n64. Also on March 30, 2020, revised and updated County staff isolation guidelines \nwere published, which the WCSO ensured all staff received. [See Exh. A-32.] \n65. On March 31, 2020, in response to a request from the Chief Judge for the 19th \nJudicial District for judicial sentence review, the WCSO sent to said Chief Judge a list of \nall inmates then in custody within the WCJ. \n16 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 28\n \n66. Also on March 31, 2020, the WCSO suspended all use and functions of WCSO \nParole staff within the WCJ in an effort to further reduce movement and interaction. \n67. Also on March 31, 2020, the WCSO released an inmate who the day prior had \nregressed from work release back to his home to self-quarantine, because the inmate \nhad  been  on  furlough  from  work  release  due  to  a  presumptive  positive  COVID-19 \ndiagnosis yet admitted himself to WCJ’s Medical Observation Unit with a mid-grade fever. \nOn March 31, 2020, medical staff determined this inmate should be self-quarantining at \nhome and so he was released to self-quarantine at home. \n68. Also on March 31, 2020, the WCSO received notice of the first confirmed case \nof COVID-19 in the WCJ inmate population.2 As a result, the WCSO immediately placed \nall inmate members of this confirmed-case inmate’s small pod into quarantine, as follows: \na.  all inmates in the quarantined pod were to be kept separate from all \nothers in the WCJ whenever possible; \nb.  all inmates in the quarantined pod were to be kept separate from each \nother, within reason, while in the quarantined pod; \nc.  all inmates of the quarantined pod were to be subject to lockdown, 23 \nhours in and 1 hour out, with same-cell occupants out only with each other daily; \n                                            \n2 This is the inmate alleged to have been “coughing up blood” and “not treated.” \nHowever, such allegations are untrue. This inmate was the one who was first isolated and \ntested on  March 27, 2020; he  was  transported  to  the hospital for other  underlying \ncomorbidities; while there he was treated for those conditions; he was given a COVID-19 \ntest out of an abundance of caution; he was returned to the WCJ because he had not yet \ntested positive and the hospital would not keep him under observation at such time; only \na few days after returning to the WCJ were the positive test results revealed; and he was \ntransported back to the hospital immediately, where he is believed to currently reside as \nof the date of this Declaration. \n17 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of 28\n \nd.  no inmate in the quarantined pod was permitted to leave the pod unless \nit was for release from custody, to attend court, or to see medical staff; \ne.  no new inmates were to be introduced into the quarantined pod; \nf.  all inmates coming out of intake were to be diverted to other pods; \ng.  staff were directed to limit their exposure to the quarantined pod; \nh.  all meals served to the quarantined pod would be on Styrofoam trays \nwhich would be disposed of in trash bags after use and without reuse; \ni.  all inmates in the quarantined pod were required to clean and sanitize \nall areas and equipment used during their “hour out”; and \nj.  all staff who either heard of or witnessed an inmate experience illness \nsymptoms in either the quarantined pod or any other pod was directed to contact \nmedical staff ASAP so appropriate screenings could commence. [See Exh. A-33.] \n69. On April 1, 2020, the entirety of the WCJ went on lockdown protocol (23 hours \nin, 1 hour out, etc.) to reduce any possible spread of COVID-19 within the WCJ. \n70. Also on April 1, 2020, to reduce movement and interaction and do as much as \npossible to ensure inmate health and safety, WCJ medical staff were directed to perform \nonly essential clinic visits and to perform such visits only in the pods unless deemed \nmedically necessary to be done in the WCJ medical clinic. \n71. Also on April 1, 2020, the WCSO implemented protocols to divert all inmates \nto new transfer units to increase observation time of incoming inmates, eliminate entrance \nof new inmates to all other units to increase observation of all units, and otherwise do as \nmuch as possible to ensure inmate health and safety. \n18 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of 28\n \n72. Also on April 1, 2020, the WCSO suspended reclassification between pods to \nprevent inmate movement throughout the WCJ for inmate health and safety. \n73. Also on April 1, 2020, the WCSO began tracking all sick call personnel and all \nsick inmates in the entirety of the WCJ, including detailing with whom they were in contact \nand with whom they were working with prior to their diagnosis, and with whom they have \nbeen in contact with since they have been out sick (personnel) or sick (inmates). \n74. Also on April 1, 2020, the WCSO learned all new municipal warrants issued \nby the Greeley Police Department would now be converted automatically into personal \nrecognizance bond for a return date at least two months in the future. \n75. On April 2, 2020, the WCSO generated and published to all inmates a video \nfrom its Jail Captain for COVID-19 information-sharing purposes. [See Exh. A-34.] \n76. Also on April 2, 2020, the WCSO suspended the introduction of new inmate \ntrustees into pods and made each inmate trustee the designated in-pod inmate cleaner \nand sanitizer for their individual pod, in an effort to reduce inmate interaction. \n77. Also on April 2, 2020, a day before Governor Polis recommended all citizens \nto wear at least cloth masks in public, the WCSO provided all WCSO personnel with \nsingle-use N-95 masks and encouraged the use of cloth masks to conserve supplies. \n78. Also on April 2, 2020, the WCSO was advised Weld County Building and \nGrounds staff would need to limit their work within the WCJ to essential services due to \na desire to ensure public health and safety and to defer all other maintenance. \n79. On April 3, 2020, the WCSO implemented further reduced reclassification \nprotocols between pods to further prevent inmate movement in the WCJ for inmate health \nand safety, reiterating the previously-deemed-mandatory social distancing protocols. \n19 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of 28\n \n80. On April 4, 2020, the WCSO set up staff decontamination stations outside \nquarantine units which staff were required to use prior to entry, including sanitization of \nall medical and food service carts, sanitizing bottom of shoes, stepping and not wiping \nshoes on towel to remove excess spray, sanitizing hands with hand sanitizer, walking \nslowly and carefully and washing hands. [See Exh. A-35.] \n81. On April 6, 2020, the WCSO implemented a protocol requiring inmate trustees, \nnone of whom were as yet even mildly symptomatic for a symptom of COVID-19 (except \ntwo of them who had immediately been removed from the trustee program upon exhibiting \nquite mild symptoms), to have their body temperature taken before beginning work and \nto wear masks which the inmate trustees were required to wear at all times while working. \n82. On April 7, 2020, the WCSO implemented a protocol requiring all WCSO staff \nto have their body temperature taken before beginning work and mandating if they were \nrunning even a low-grade fever, they must seek outside medical attention immediately. \n83. On April 8, 2020, the WCSO finally received its shipment of 500 masks which \nit ordered from TKHC back on March 23, 2020. WCSO personnel immediately distributed \na mask to each inmate and communicated expectations to inmates on how the masks \nwere supposed to be used properly. \n84. On April 9, 2020, signs were posted in English and Spanish in all housing units \nabout COVID-19, and signs were hung for all WCSO personnel reminding them of the \nCOVID-19-related information they previously were given. [See Exh. A-36, Exh. A-37.] \n85. On April 10, 2020, all WCSO deputies were issued reusable goggles which \nwere to be worn when interacting with inmates or when in isolation or medical units. \n20 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of 28\n \n86. Also on April 10, 2020, Daniel Williams (counsel for Plaintiffs), Dr. Carlos \nFranco-Paredes (Plaintiffs’ expert witness), Dr. Valerie Smith (WCHD), and someone \nfrom the Weld County Attorney’s Office were given a tour of the WCJ for approximately 3 \nhours and 15 minutes including donning and doffing of personal protective equipment, \nduring which time all participants were escorted by two WCSO personnel for their safety \nand security, were permitted to view whatever areas they desired of WCJ operations, and \nwere permitted to ask all questions they desired on the WCSO response to COVID-19. \n87. Also on April 10, 2020, all WCJ inmates were each given their own flyer stating \nCDC-recommended mask use and COVID-19 precautions, and still further signs were \nposted within the WCJ with additional information on COVID-19, and these efforts were \nintended to increase inmate awareness of disease prevention methods. [See Exh. A-38.] \n88. Also on April 10, 2020, WCSO personnel attended a COVID-19 webinar from \nTKHC with recommendations confirming the efficacy of WCSO’s actions. [Exh. A-39.] \nADDITIONAL ASPECTS OF THE WCSO’S MEASURED RESPONSE TO COVID-19 \n89. The WCSO intends to keep refining procedures at the WCJ, within supply-\nchain and state-law limitations, to continue to ensure the high levels of inmate health and \nsafety which already exist, both for the duration of this pandemic and on into the future. \n90. As of well before this pandemic and continuing into the foreseeable future, \ninmates were, are, and will be given opportunity to wash their hands several times daily. \n91. Sanitation supplies (hand soap, soap dispensers, and hospital-grade cleaner) \nalready have been free of cost, are free of cost, and will continue to be free of cost to \ninmates. Sanitation supplies are also provided on demand to every inmate within WCJ \nsecurity measures and allowing for the inertia which being on lockdown necessitates. \n21 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 22 of 28\n \n92. With  respect  to  hand  sanitizer,  however,  not  only  has  it  been  almost \nimpossible to find, but also it is not able to be distributed to inmates due to its high ethanol \ncontent — i.e, there is a substantial risk inmates could attempt to get drunk or high on it \nor actually get drunk or high on it. \n93. Sinks, toilets, drinking fountains, tables, and other potential common exposure \nareas inmates routinely use in the WCJ are sanitized multiple times a day. \n94. Inmates have been directed, when they make use of the toilet in common \nareas, to use bottles of hospital-grade cleaner stationed near the toilet for this purpose to \nclean the toilet both before they use the toilet and after they use the toilet. \n95. This mandate on inmates applies to all toilets in all inmate common areas. \n96. Inmate mattresses are cleaned routinely with the same type of hospital-grade \ncleaner as the cleaner used on toilets. Inmate mattresses can be cleaned as frequently \nas the inmate chooses (within reason) are always decontaminated after use, and are \ncleaned by inmate trustee workers or by Detentions Division staff. \n97. One minimum security housing unit in particular holds 60 inmates, all of whom \nhave been directed to follow this toilet-sanitizing procedure. \n98. Laundry-cleaning measures within the WCJ also have been stepped up since \nApril 1, 2020, such that laundry items are laundered inside the pod first and then at the \ngeneral WCJ laundry facilities second, meaning laundry items are in effect laundered \ntwice; and laundry items from the quarantine units and the MedObs units are aired for 72 \nhours prior to being subject to this laundering protocol. \n22 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 23 of 28\n \n99. WCJ medical staff and nurses are going door-to-door for med rounds and \nmaking personal contact with each inmate, so inmates have a prime opportunity to \naddress with medical professionals any possible symptom they experience. \n100.  Due to the present scarcity of COVID-19 tests, the WCSO is having to triage \nwho to test (as evidenced by the screening question protocols set forth above and \nattached), and the WCSO has placed multiple requests to TKHC and to the Weld County \nHealth Department for additional tests but has received no additional tests. \n101.  Moreover, inmates over the age of 55, inmates with comorbidities including \nbut not limited to heart issues, lung issues, and smokers, and inmates who are pregnant \nalready receive an increased amount of medical attention in the WCJ from the date they \narrive at the WCJ, so they are being more closely monitored. This monitoring includes all \nPlaintiffs who would fall within any such category. The protocols of WCJ medical staff in \nrelation to inmates with such medical conditions would be consistent with their need for \ntreatment. If an inmate is in a risk category and the inmate make such fact known to \nmedical upon screening and routine visits, then the inmate would receive the necessary \nmedical supervision for the inmate’s condition. \n102.  Although all symptomatic inmates are being housed together in the same \nquarantine unit without any non-symptomatic inmates (per the above-stated protocol), it \nis not outside the realm of possibility for inmates to hide their symptoms and to decline to \ntell the truth about their health when asked about it directly by WCJ medical personnel. \n103.  Further,  the  media  consumption  of  WCJ  inmates  continues  unabated. \nInmates are still furnished with all regular newspapers they were otherwise provided prior \nto the start of the COVID-19 pandemic; their TVs are available and used and they are \n23 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 24 of 28\n \nable to get news from the outside world as to the pandemic; and video updates from the \nWCSO periodically are published to inmates to update them on the situation generally. \n104.  And WCSO Detentions Division personnel are doing their part to conserve \nmasks for the inmate population by wearing their own cloth masks within the WCJ. \nBIG DECLINE IN WCJ INMATE POPULATION GIVEN LEGAL RESTRICTIONS \n105.  As of 8:00 AM April 13, 2020, the WCJ is down to 513 inmates, a 35% \nreduction in population since March 1, 2020, and that may decrease by end of day today. \n106.  A total of 68 inmates currently housed in the WCJ have been sentenced to \nserve  their  period  of  incarceration  within  the  Colorado  Department  of  Corrections \n(“CDOC”), but the CDOC has implemented a temporary yet mandatory moratorium on \naccepting new intakes from county jails, meaning these inmates must stay put at WCJ. \n107.  A total of 408 inmates currently housed in the WCJ are pretrial detainees, \nmeaning their criminal trials have yet to be held and are not likely to be held in the near \nfuture given the Chief Judge of the 19th Judicial District vacated all trials through and \nincluding May 15, 2020, meaning these inmates must stay put at WCJ. As Sheriff, I do \nnot possess any legal authority to modify or revoke these pretrial detainees’ bonds which \nare set by the state court judge. Nor do I as Sheriff possess any legal authority to permit \nany of these inmates to serve their pretrial period at home or any other detention facility \nother than the WCJ. Any such decision would have to be made by the state court judge. \n108.  This leaves a total of 37 inmates currently housed within the WCJ who have \nbeen sentenced to serve their period of incarceration at the WCJ. It is most, but not all, \nof these inmates who make up the above-referenced “inmate trustee” population who \nwork at WCJ in food services and are given a small degree of janitorial duties. \n24 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 25 of 28\n \n109.  However, the WCSO employs its own staff of janitors assigned to the WCJ \nwho handle the vast majority of janitorial and sanitizing duties within the WCJ. \n110.  Regardless, it is only these 37 inmates who have even a slight probability \nof early release from the WCJ, but almost all of them either pleaded guilty to or were \nconvicted after a trial of offenses which counsel strongly against early release given the \nWCSO’s concurrent need to protect a community which is on lockdown, such as assaults, \ndomestic violence crimes, drug offenses, DUIs, and failures to comply with court orders. \n111.  These 42 inmates are being released as they complete their sentences and \neach inmate is receiving the maximum amount of good time available to them based on \ntheir crime and classification status, but I have no authority to reduce their sentences \nunilaterally; statute requires them to move the state court judge for a sentence reduction. \n112.  The WCJ currently could house 1177 inmates. However, with regard to \nwhether the physical plant of the WCJ could accommodate giving six feet of space at all \ntimes to all inmates by housing inmates either single-celled in housing units with double \noccupancy cells or by housing inmates two to a cell for each housing unit with four-person \nor six-person cells, the WCJ would have room to house only 350 inmates in this manner. \nThus, it is impossible within the laws of mathematics and of physics to maintain six feet \nof distance between all inmates at all times within the WCJ given the number of inmates \nwhich my office is statutorily and judicially required to continue housing there. \n113.  Also, the WCJ’s year-to-date net operating cost is $77,470 daily through \nFebruary 29, 2020, which does not account for certain utilities-type expenses like electric, \nwater, trash, insurance, etc. This is the most current figure I can offer the Court at present \nbecause, although a March 2020 daily average will give the Court a more accurate sense \n25 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 26 of 28\n \nof the WCJ’s reduction in operational costs due to significant attrition in inmate population \nsince March 1, 2020, I simply do not have those figures to give the Court at this time. \n114.  Further, on February 1, 2020, the WCJ housed 796 inmates. From February \n1, 2020 to April 11, 2020, WCJ daily bookings totaled 1765 additional inmates for a \ncumulative total of 2561 inmates who have been in the custody of the WCJ at some point \nin that time. Of those 2561 inmates, ten (10) total have tested positive for COVID-19, an \noverall infection rate of 0.39% of all persons in the custody of the WCJ at some point \nsince February 1, 2020, and twenty-five (25) total have been quarantined (some of whom \nhave tested negative and others who are awaiting test results) an overall quarantine rate \nof 0.98% of all persons in the custody of the WCJ at some point since February 1, 2020.  \nIMPORTANT, PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON INMATE PLAINTIFFS \n115.  It seems vital to provide the Court with publicly available information on the \nPlaintiffs for the Court generally, and to evaluate the significant public safety issues at \nstake specifically. What is included in my Declaration is limited to information otherwise \navailable to a member of the public not employed with law enforcement or the judiciary. \n116.  Inmate Plaintiff Thomas Carranza has a lengthy arrest record, which is \nattached to this Declaration as Exhibit A-40. Carranza currently is housed in the WCJ on \nThird Degree Assault charges, his next scheduled court date is not until May 4, 2020, and \nhe filed two motions for personal recognizance bond, both of which were denied. \n117.  Inmate  Plaintiff  Jesus  Martinez  has  a  lengthy  arrest  record,  which  is \nattached to this Declaration as Exhibit A-41. Martinez currently is housed in the WCJ on \nEscape, Controlled Substance, and Vehicular Eluding charges, including a Parole hold \nwithout bond, and his next scheduled court date is not until June 22, 2020. \n26 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 27 of 28\n \n118.  Inmate  Plaintiff  Richard  Barnum  has  a  lengthy  arrest  record,  which  is \nattached to this Declaration as Exhibit A-42. Barnum currently is housed in the WCJ on \ncharges of First Degree Assault with Deadly Weapon; Second Degree Assault with \nDeadly Weapon, Felony Menacing (two counts), and First Degree Trespass of Auto with \nIntent to Commit Crime, and his next scheduled court date is April 15, 2020. \n119.  Inmate Plaintiff Thomas Lewis has a lengthy arrest record, which is attached \nto this Declaration as Exhibit A-43. Lewis currently is housed in the WCJ on charges of \nDriving  Under  the  Influence  with  Three  or  More  Priors,  Possession  of  Controlled \nSubstance, Obstructing a Peace Officer, Driving After Revocation Prohibited, Possession \nof Drug Paraphernalia, and Failure to Comply with Probation, and his next scheduled \ncourt date is May 18, 2020. \n120.  Inmate Plaintiff Michael Ward was released from the WCJ on April 9, 2020. \nHis arrest record and current charges are attached to this Declaration as Exhibit A-44. \nHis next scheduled court date for charges of First Degree Trespass to Auto is April 14, \n2020, and his next scheduled court date for charges of Failure to Comply with Probation \nfor Third Degree Assault is May 6, 2020. \n121.  Inmate Plaintiff Colby Propes was released from the WCJ on April 7, 2020. \nHis lengthy arrest record is attached to this Declaration as Exhibit A-45. His next court \ndate is May 18, 2020, on charges of Driving Under Revocation (4), Interlock Violation (2), \nCareless Driving, Blocking Railroad Crossing, Identity Theft, Theft, Criminal Possession \nof Financial Device, Criminal Possession of Identification Documents, Unauthorized Use \nof  Financial  Transaction  Device,  First  Degree  Aggravated  Motor  Vehicle  Theft, \n27 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 28 of 28\n \nObstructing a Police Officer, Possession of a Controlled Substance, Possession of Drug \nParaphernalia, Failure to Display Proof of Insurance, and Lane Violation. \n122.  Inmate Plaintiff Chad Hunter has a lengthy arrest record, which is attached \nto this Declaration as Exhibit A-46. Hunter currently is housed in the WCJ on charges of \nDriving Under Revocation, Driving Without Insurance, and Defective Headlights, for which \nhis next scheduled court date is July 31, 2020; and Failure to Comply with Warrant for: \nDisplaying Unlawful License Plate, Driving Without Insurance, Driving Under Revocation, \nPossession  of  Weapon  by  Previous  Offender;  Possession  of  Drug  Paraphernalia, \nPossession of Controlled Substance, and Possession of Forged Instrument, for which his \nnext scheduled court date is April 14, 2020. \n123.

Classification staff will coordinate with one another on when they will be doing interviews as \nthere are a limited number of visiting kiosks in the pods (most have 2 kiosks). \n3.  An email will be sent to the Pod Deputy and to BookingStaff@co.weld.co.us to include the list of \nindividuals and what time they will begin.   \n4.  Classifications will contact the Pod to ensure the Deputy received the list.   \n5.  The Pod Deputy will be responsible for getting the Inmates to the visiting kiosk and ensuring the \narea is cleaned every time a new Inmate utilizes it.   \n6.  The Classifications Specialist will check in with the front desk to coordinate the following: \na.   Determine the best visiting kiosk to utilize in the lobby.  This should include the \nfollowing considerations: \ni.  Strategically choose one that will provide for privacy. \nii.  Maintain appropriate distance between one another at the kiosks.  \nb.  The approximate length of time needed as this time can be set.  \nc.  Work with the front desk as to when you need to switch pods. \nd.  Inform the front desk when finished.     \n7.  Prior to starting, the Classification Specialist will clean the kiosk they are using to complete the \ninterviews and will clean it once completed.   \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-7

A-28\nSorry for the long email but this needs to get reinforced….  We are in weird times and I know you probably don’t want \nto read anything more about Corona Virus/COVID‐19/social distancing/grocery stores being out of toilet paper/favorite \nrestaurants being shutdown/etc. BUT… \n \nYou are required to lead and do your part to keep yourself healthy, your peers healthy, and your staff healthy. Our \noperational objective is to “provide effective law enforcement services with honor and integrity”.  We cannot be \neffective if we are sick and out of action.  As leaders, we must ensure our environment is as safe and wholesome as \npossible.  \n \nSo with that, I need you all to distance yourself as much as possible from your peers while at work – physically. During \nthis time, we must consider the necessity of being in each other’s offices to do our daily business. I know how social we \nall are and what great ideas, solutions and plans come from office conversations – but we must be smart about this. If \nyou as a Sergeant group get wiped out from this on a shift or a side of the week, the void left will be challenging to fill. \nWe already have staff that are affected by this and we must think of the need to be around each other in every \ninteraction we want to have right now. I hope this virus doesn’t get worse, but it probably will before things get \nbetter.   We are responsible to do what we can to not get it or spread it to others.    \n \nYour Lieutenants and I have personally worked on this. We have started using Skype for Business to minimize face to \nface interactions.   All employees have access to Skype. I encourage you when time allows to find a training video online \nand then use it to develop proficiency. Encourage your deputies to do the same.  Some computers don’t have video, but \nthe IM and audio are still available, and it’s easier than email.   This is useful when a group meeting is needed.  Skype is \neven available on your iPhone. If Skype is easier for you to communicate with me or your Lieutenants – the IM \ncomponent is great and easier than email – we are happy to do this (my skype is currently active on my desktop). To \naccess Skype, go to the start menu of your computer, find Skype for Business, sign in with your email address that ends \nin .co.weld.co.us and you’re in. Find contacts, add them to your favorites or other contact list by right clicking on the \nname when you search for it and you can begin to message effortlessly. \n \nWe need your help to stay healthy. Keep your distance from your peers, use phone, use email, use Skype when you can, \nshout between offices, sit in doorways, separate yourself from your peer in the same office for the time being, clean \nyour work area, clean someone else’s work area if you work there, do everything you can to stay healthy, to keep your \nfamily healthy, to keep your peers healthy, and to keep your staff healthy. \n \nI trust that you all will come up with individual plans to make this happen, but know that I will question you, if necessary, \nabout the necessity of face to face meetings or being in close proximity to each other in order to do my part in keeping \nus healthy.   I expect you to do the same with your deputies and all employees.  \n \nI understand that our job requires us and our deputies to have contact with inmates and the public – I understand, but \nlet’s be smart about it. Are we keeping safe distances?  Do we really need to talk to this person inside a cell, can they be \nasked to come out to the GP area? \n \nWe need all of you in the roles you have been selected for during these tough times and your staff need you as well. \nMake good choices, please. And let me know if I can help or if you have ideas to help distance ourselves and still get the \njob done.  \n \nThis threat is not over – we are in the middle of the battle right now and we need to make sure that we are not \ngetting complacent. \n \nYou have all done so well, and reacted amazingly to this threat and we are able to say that there is no outbreak in our \nfacility.  If we get complacent, this will change quickly. \n \n2\n\nCase

Preventing the spread of Coronavirus \nDisease 2019 (COVID-19) in homes, residential communities and workplaces is the goal of self-isolation.  \nSelf-isolation can be done as a result of experiencing symptoms or as a result of being a caregiver to \nsomeone experiencing symptoms of COVID-19.  The following guidelines will aid in a commonsense \napproach if you need to self-isolate. \n \nSELF-ISOLATION – WHEN? \n \nIn order to stop other people from getting COVID-19 (called Community Spread), each of the following \nshould perform self-isolation: \n \n•  If you are well, but you have been in close contact with a case of COVID-19  \n \n•  If you have symptoms (fever, cough and shortness of breath) \n \nIf these conditions exist, complete the Weld County Employee Self-Certification Form for COVID-19 \nSymptoms. \n \nRESTRICT MOVEMENTS – HOW? \n \nSelf-Isolation involves restricting of movements described below: \n•  Restricted movements mean avoiding contact with other people as much as possible by staying \nat home \n \n•  You can still go outside for walks, runs or cycles on your own.  But you should not spend time in \nclose contact with other people. Close contact is within 6 feet of other people.  \n \n•  Do not go to work or school \n \n•  Do not use public transportation \n \n•  Do not go to meetings, social gatherings, group events or crowded places \n \n•  Do not have visitors at your home \n \n•  Do not go shopping - where possible, order your groceries online or have some family or friends \ndrop them off (outside your home) \n \n•  If you must shop for items of sustenance and are not symptomatic, go during off-hours where \nthere are fewer crowds   \n \n•  If having food or goods delivered to your house, pay for them electronically so that no money \n(cash) exchanges hands \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-8   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 14\nEXHIBIT A-32\n•  Keep away from older people or anyone with long-term medical conditions  \n \n•  Do not travel outside the Country or areas considered to be high risk \n \n•  Limit contact as much as possible. This also means limiting contact with persons living in your \nresidence. Stay 6 feet away from other individuals at all times \n \n•  Cover coughs and sneezes with your upper sleeve or a tissue, and then discard the tissue \nimmediately in a trash basket. Never cough in the direction of someone else \n \n•  Wash your hands with soap and water, or use alcohol-based hand rubs after coughing or \nsneezing or throwing a used tissue in the garbage \n \n•  Avoid sharing household items. Do not share drinking glasses, towels, eating utensils, bedding, \nor any other items until you are no longer asked to self-isolate \n \n•  Keep your surroundings clean. While the virus is not spread very well from contact with soiled \nhousehold surfaces, try to clean surfaces that you share with others, such as door knobs, \ntelephones, and bathroom surfaces (or any other object that you sneeze or cough on), with a \nstandard household disinfectant such as disinfectant wipes. Wash your hands after cleaning the \narea. \n \n•  Visit loved ones by electronic devices instead of in person  \n \n•  Cancel or postpone conferences and large meetings \n \nENDING SELF-ISOLATION \n \nSelf-Isolation and restricted movement generally end when the following conditions are met: \n \n•  This restriction of movement should last 14 days upon potential exposure through contact with \na person demonstrating COVID-19 symptoms or;  \n \n•  If self-isolation was due to your symptoms, you shall ensure at least 3 days (72 hours) have \npassed since recovery.  Recovery is defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-\nreducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of \nbreath). Your health care provider or a public health order may advise or require a longer period \nof isolation or conditions for return to work (e.g., wearing a mask at work until all symptoms are \nfully resolved) or; \n \n•  Medical testing results in an alternate diagnosis (e.g., tested positive for influenza).  The criteria \nfor return to work should be based on that diagnosis in consultation with the health care \nprovider who made that diagnosis since COVID-19 has been shown to co-exist with other \ninfections in some people. \n \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-8   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 14\nEXHIBIT A-32\nILLNESS IN HOME – NOW WHAT? \nHousehold members, intimate partners, and caregivers in a non-healthcare setting may have close \ncontact with a person with symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or a person under \ninvestigation. Close contacts should monitor their health; they should call their healthcare provider right \naway if they develop symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath)   \nClose contacts should follow these recommendations: \n•  Make sure that you understand and can help the patient follow their healthcare provider’s \ninstructions for medication(s) and care. You should help the patient with basic needs in the \nhome and provide support for getting groceries, prescriptions, and other personal needs. \n \n•  Monitor the patient’s symptoms. If the patient is getting sicker, call his or her healthcare \nprovider.  If the patient has a medical emergency and you need to call 911, notify the dispatch \npersonnel that the patient has, or is being evaluated for COVID-19. \n \n•  Household members should stay in another room or be separated from the patient as much as \npossible. Household members should use a separate bedroom and bathroom, if available. \n \n•  Prohibit visitors who do not have an essential need to be in the home. \n \n•  Household members should care for any pets in the home. If possible, do not handle pets or \nother animals while sick.  Wash your hands well after caring for any pets. \n \n•  Make sure that shared spaces in the home have good air flow, such as by an air conditioner or \nan opened window, weather permitting. \n \n•  Perform hand hygiene frequently. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 \nseconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all \nsurfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry. Soap and water should be \nused preferentially if hands are visibly dirty. \n \n•  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. \n \n•  The patient should wear a facemask when you are around other people. If the patient is not able \nto wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), you, as the caregiver, \nshould wear a mask when you are in the same room as the patient. \n \n•  Wear a disposable facemask and gloves when you touch or have contact with the patient’s \nblood, stool, or body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, vomit, urine.  \n \n•  Throw out disposable facemasks and gloves after using them. Do not reuse. \n \n•  When removing personal protective equipment, first remove and dispose of gloves. Then, \nimmediately clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Next, \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-8   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 14\nEXHIBIT A-32\nremove and dispose of facemask, and immediately clean your hands again with soap and water \nor alcohol-based hand sanitizer. \n \n•  Avoid sharing household items with the patient. You should not share dishes, drinking glasses, \ncups, eating utensils, towels, bedding, or other items. After the patient uses these items, you \nshould wash them thoroughly \n \n•  Clean all “high-touch” surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, \ntoilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables, every day. Also, clean any surfaces that \nmay have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.  \n \n•  Use a household cleaning spray or wipe, according to the label instructions. Labels contain \ninstructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product including precautions you should \ntake when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good \nventilation during use of the product. \n \n•  Wash laundry thoroughly.  \n \n•  Immediately remove and wash clothes or bedding that have blood, stool, or body fluids on \nthem. \n \n•  Wear disposable gloves while handling soiled items and keep soiled items away from your body. \nClean your hands (with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer) immediately after \nremoving your gloves. \n \n•  Read and follow directions on labels of laundry or clothing items and detergent. In general, \nusing a normal laundry detergent according to washing machine instructions and dry thoroughly \nusing the warmest temperatures recommended on the clothing label. \n \n•  Place all used disposable gloves, facemasks, and other contaminated items in a lined container \nbefore disposing of them with another household waste. Clean your hands (with soap and water \nor an alcohol-based hand sanitizer) immediately after handling these items. Soap and water \nshould be used preferentially if hands are visibly dirty. \n \n•  As a caregiver, monitor yourself for signs of possible infection, including fever (100.4 degrees F \nor 38.0 degrees C or higher, measured twice a day), cough or difficulty breathing. \n \n   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-8   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 14\nEXHIBIT A-32\nSTRESS AND COPING \n \nThe outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be stressful for people. Fear and anxiety \nabout a disease can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions in adults and children. Coping with \nstress will make you, the people you care about, and your community stronger. \nEveryone reacts differently to stressful situations.  How you respond to the outbreak can depend on \nyour background, the things that make you different from other people, and the community you live in. \n \nPeople who may respond more strongly to the stress of a crisis include \n \n•  Older people and people with chronic diseases who are at higher risk for COVID-19 \n•  Children and teens \n•  People who are helping with the response to COVID-19, like doctors and other health care \nproviders, or first responders \n•  People who have mental health conditions including problems with substance use \n \nStress during an infectious disease outbreak can include \n \n•  Fear and worry about your own health and the health of your loved ones \n•  Changes in sleep or eating patterns \n•  Difficulty sleeping or concentrating \n•  Worsening of chronic health problems \n•  Increased use of alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs \n \nPeople with preexisting mental health conditions should continue with their treatment and be aware of \nnew or worsening symptoms. Additional information can be found at the Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Services Administration website at: https://www.samhsa.gov/disaster-preparedness \n \nTaking care of yourself, your friends, and your family can help you cope with stress. Helping others cope \nwith their stress can also make your community stronger. \n \nTHINGS YOU CAN DO TO SUPPORT YOURSELF \n \n•  Take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories, including social media. Hearing \nabout the pandemic repeatedly can be upsetting. \n•  Take care of your body. Take deep breaths and stretch. Try to eat healthy, well-balanced meals, \nexercise regularly, get plenty of sleep, and avoid alcohol and drugs. \n•  Make time to unwind. Try to do some other activities you enjoy. \n•  Connect with others. Talk with people you trust about your concerns and how you are feeling. \n \nREDUCE STRESS IN YOURSELF AND OTHERS \n \nSharing the facts about COVID-19 and understanding the actual risk to yourself and people you care \nabout can make an outbreak less stressful. \nWhen you share accurate information about COVID-19 you can help make people feel less stressed and \nallow you to connect with them. \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-8   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 14\nEXHIBIT A-32\nFOR PARENTS \n \nChildren and teens react, in part, on what they see from the adults around them. When parents and \ncaregivers deal with the COVID-19 calmly and confidently, they can provide the best support for their \nchildren. Parents can be more reassuring to others around them, especially children, if they are better \nprepared. \nNot all children and teens respond to stress in the same way. Some common changes to watch for \ninclude  \n \n•  Excessive crying or irritation in younger children \n•  Returning to behaviors they have outgrown (for example, toileting accidents or bedwetting) \n•  Excessive worry or sadness \n•  Unhealthy eating or sleeping habits \n•  Irritability and “acting out” behaviors in teens \n•  Poor school performance or avoiding school \n•  Difficulty with attention and concentration \n•  Avoidance of activities enjoyed in the past \n•  Unexplained headaches or body pain \n•  Use of alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs \n \nThere are many things you can do to support your child  \n \n•  Take time to talk with your child or teen about the COVID-19 outbreak. Answer questions and \nshare facts about COVID-19 in a way that your child or teen can understand. \n•  Reassure your child or teen that they are safe. Let them know it is ok if they feel upset. Share \nwith them how you deal with your own stress so that they can learn how to cope from you. \n•  Limit your family’s exposure to news coverage of the event, including social media. Children may \nmisinterpret what they hear and can be frightened about something they do not understand. \n•  Try to keep up with regular routines. If schools are closed, create a schedule for learning \nactivities and relaxing or fun activities. \n•  Be a role model.  Take breaks, get plenty of sleep, exercise, and eat well. Connect with your \nfriends and family members. \n \nFOR RESPONDERS \n \nResponding to COVID-19 can take an emotional toll on you. There are things you can do to reduce \nsecondary traumatic stress (STS) reactions: \n \n•  Acknowledge that STS can impact anyone helping families after a traumatic event. \n•  Learn the symptoms including physical (fatigue, illness) and mental (fear, withdrawal, guilt). \n•  Allow time for you and your family to recover from responding to the pandemic. \n•  Create a menu of personal self-care activities that you enjoy, such as spending time with friends \nand family, exercising, or reading a book. \n•  Take a break from media coverage of COVID-19. \n•  Ask for help if you feel overwhelmed or concerned that COVID-19 is affecting your ability to care \nfor your family and patients as you did before the outbreak. \n \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-8   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 14\nEXHIBIT A-32\nFOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN RELEASED FROM QUARANTINE \n \nBeing separated from others if a healthcare provider thinks you may have been exposed to COVID-19 \ncan be stressful, even if you do not get sick. Everyone feels differently after coming out of quarantine. \nSome feelings include: \n \n•  Mixed emotions, including relief after quarantine \n•  Fear and worry about your own health and the health of your loved ones \n•  Stress from the experience of monitoring yourself or being monitored by others for signs and \nsymptoms of COVID-19 \n•  Sadness, anger, or frustration because friends or loved ones have unfounded fears of \ncontracting the disease from contact with you, even though you have been determined not to \nbe contagious \n•  Guilt about not being able to perform normal work or parenting duties during quarantine \n•  Other emotional or mental health changes \n \nChildren may also feel upset or have other strong emotions if they, or someone they know, has been \nreleased from quarantine. You can help your child cope. \n  \nCall your healthcare provider if stress gets in the way of your daily activities for several days in a row. \n \n \nThis guidance does not constitute, substitute for, or supersede medical advice from a health care \nprovider or a public health isolation or quarantine order from the jurisdiction in which you reside.  \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-8   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 14\nEXHIBIT A-33\n \n \nFrom: Matthew Elbe <melbe@weldgov.com>  \nSent: Tuesday, March 31, 2020 4:01 PM \nTo: DD Supervisors <DDSupervisors@co.weld.co.us>; DD Deputies <DDDeputies@co.weld.co.us>; DD Inmate Services \n<DDinmateservices@co.weld.co.us>; DD Court Services <DDCourtServices@co.weld.co.us>; DD Control \n<DDControl@co.weld.co.us> \nSubject: COVID‐19 Confirmation \nImportance: High \n \nFearless Staff, \n \nWe have just received confirmation of the first confirmed COVID‐19 case of an inmate in our facility. As concerning as \nthis is, I cannot overlook the measures you all have taken to only have this be the first. \n \nPlease know that the belief is that this is still very much in its infancy in our community and certainly in our jail – we are \nvery much on the upside of the hill right now. This point needs to be emphasized to all of us so that we continue to take \nthe necessary precautions to prevent the spread of this amongst each other, within our families and within the inmate \npopulation. We all have to be on our game with this and if you have not been taking precautions as you should, please \nstart now. \n \nThe inmate came out of unit [REDACTED] and as a result the following actions are being taken effective immediately… \n \nUnit [REDACTED] \n‐  Unit [REDACTED] is now on “quarantine” until further notice. Quarantine means that the inmates in that area \nare to be kept separate from all others in the jail whenever possible and should be kept separate from each \nother, within reason, while in the pod. No new inmates are to be introduced into the quarantined unit.  \n‐  Inmates in [REDACTED] must be locked down in their cells with HOUTs provided to two cells at a time once \nevery 24 hours. The same two cells must be the same two cells out together every day for their HOUT.  \n‐  No inmates will be transferred into [REDACTED] until further notice. \n‐  Inmates currently housed in [REDACTED] should not leave the housing unit unless it is for release from custody, \nto attend court, or to see medical. If you believe an inmate needs to leave the unit otherwise, please staff the \nreason with your sergeant (KSEP issues and other anomalies will be dealt with on an individual basis). There \nshould be no inmate transferred from unit [REDACTED] to another unit for general housing!! \n‐  All inmates coming out of Intake who are classified as HMED or MAXM cannot go into [REDACTED] and must be \ndiverted to [REDACTED], [REDACTED] or [REDACTED]. \n‐  Limit all exposure to [REDACTED] unless you are assigned there or approved to give breaks in there.  \n‐  All meals being served to [REDACTED] will be served on Styrofoam trays. These trays are to be disposed of in \ntrash bags in the pod and thrown out with the trash. \n1\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-8   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 14\n‐  Prior to inmates going back to their cells after their HOUT, have them clean the areas they used, tables, phones, \netc. appropriately. \nEXHIBIT A-33\n‐  If you hear of or believe that an inmate in [REDACTED] is ill, or any unit for that matter, please let medical now \nASAP so appropriate screenings can commence. \n \nPlease review these actions again and ask questions if you have them. Again, I cannot thank you enough for all the \nflexibility you all have had and the willingness to complete our necessary tasks during this time. Although this may not \nbe over for us, I know that we have the resolve to see this through. We need to make good choices – please do your \npart. \n \nThanks everyone!! \n \n \nLieutenant Matt Elbe \nDetentions Division \nWeld County Sheriff’s Office \n2110 O Street Greeley, CO 80634 \n970‐400‐3817 \nmelbe@weldgov.com  \n \n \n2\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-8   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 14\nEXHIBIT A-34\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT A-34 CONSISTS OF A SINGLE VIDEO FILE \n \nGENERATED BY THE WCSO ON OR ABOUT APRIL 2, 2020 \n \nBEING PROVIDED TO THE COURT UNDER SEPARATE COVER \n \nWITH A COPY BEING SENT TO ALL COUNSEL OF RECORD \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-8   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 14\nEXHIBIT A-35\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 26-8   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 14\nHousing Unit deputies ‐ Please enforce this process with people leaving your housing unit. \nEXHIBIT A-35\nThis is yet another way we are working as a team to “Stop the Spread.” \nThank you! \nMichael S.

Brimmer\nCivil Case No. 20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC\nJESUS MARTINEZ, and\nCHAD HUNTER,\nPlaintiffs, on their own and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons,\nv.\nSTEVEN REAMS, Sheriff of Weld County, Colorado, in his official capacity,\nDefendant.\nORDER\nThis matter is before the Court on the parties’ Joint Motion for Preliminary\nApproval of Class Action Settlement [Docket No. 96].  On April 7, 2020, plaintiffs\nbrought this case as a class action alleging that defendant Sheriff Steven Reams acted\nwith deliberate indifference to the health of medically vulnerable persons in custody at\nthe Weld County Jail (“WCJ”) by failing to take necessary measures to prevent the\nspread of COVID-19.  Docket Nos. 1, 7 at 25-27. \nI.  BACKGROUND\nOn April 7, 2020, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order,\npreliminary injunction, and expedited hearing.  Docket No. 1.  Plaintiffs later withdrew\nthe portion of their motion seeking a temporary restraining order.  Docket No. 29.  On\nApril 30, 2020, the Court conducted a hearing on plaintiff’s preliminary injunction\nmotion.  Docket No. 52.  On May 11, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 100   Filed 12/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 24\nthat identified actions defendant had to take to identify and protect medically vulnerable\ninmates at WCJ.  See generally Docket No. 55.  This preliminary injunction has been\nextended several times and is currently set to expire February 5, 2021.  Docket No. 99. \nThe parties have engaged in negotiations in order to reach a settlement, and on\nNovember 30, 2020, they filed a Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class Action\nSettlement, Certification of a Class and Appointment of Class Counsel, and Permission\nto Post Class Notice.  Docket No. 96.  \nII.  PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT \nApproval of a class action settlement under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 takes place in two\nstages.  In the first stage, the Court preliminarily certifies a settlement class,\npreliminarily approves the settlement agreement, and authorizes that notice be given to\nthe class so that interested class members may object to the fairness of the settlement. \nIn the second stage, after notice is given to the putative class, the Court holds a\nfairness hearing at which it will address (1) any timely objections to the treatment of this\nlitigation as a class action, and (2) any objections to the fairness, reasonableness, or\nadequacy of the settlement terms.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2); see, e.g., McReynolds v.\nRichards-Cantave, 588 F.3d 790, 803 (2d Cir. 2009).\n“Preliminary approval of a class action settlement, in contrast to final approval, is\nat most a determination that there is . . . ‘probable cause’ to submit the proposal to\nclass members and hold a full-scale hearing as to its fairness.”  In re Crocs, Inc. Sec.\nLitig., No. 07-cv-02351-PAB-KLM, 2013 WL 4547404, at *3 (D. Colo. Aug. 28, 2013)\n(quoting Davis v. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., 775 F. Supp. 2d 601, 607 (W.D.N.Y.\n2\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 100   Filed 12/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 24\n2011)).  If the parties meet the requirements for preliminary approval, the Court will\ndirect notice to all class members who would be bound by the proposal and hold a\nfairness hearing to determine if \nit is fair, reasonable, and adequate after considering whether: (A) the\nclass representatives and class counsel have adequately represented the\nclass; (B) the proposal was negotiated at arm’s length; (C) the relief\nprovided is for the class is adequate, taking into account (i) the costs,\nrisks, and delay of trial and appeal; (ii) the effectiveness of any proposed\nmethod of distributing relief to the class, including the method of\nprocessing class-member claims; (iii) the terms of any proposed award of\nattorney’s fees, including timing of payment; and (iv) any agreement\nrequired to be identified under Rule 23(e)(3); and (D) the proposal treats\nclass members equitably relative to each other.\n Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2).  Though the standards for preliminary approval are not as\nstringent as those for final approval, the final approval standards inform the Court’s\npreliminary inquiry and thus it is appropriate to review them. \nA court’s review for final approval is to “focus[] on whether ‘(1) the settlement\nwas fairly and honestly negotiated, (2) serious legal and factual questions placed the\nlitigation's outcome in doubt, (3) the immediate recovery was more valuable than the\nmere possibility of a more favorable outcome after further litigation, and (4) [the parties]\nbelieved the settlement was fair and reasonable.’”  Elna Sefcovic, LLC v.

Shook II, 543 F.3d at 604.  \nIII.  ANALYSIS OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT\nA. Overview of Proposed Settlement Agreement\nThe parties seek certification of a settlement class consisting of \nAll past, present, and future inmates housed within the Weld County Jail\nfrom April 7, 2020 through the “COVID-19 Emergency End Date” who are\n“medically vulnerable.”\nAn inmate is “medically vulnerable” if, pursuant to CDC guidelines for\ncorrectional facilities like the WCJ which exist as of the date this proposed\nConsent Decree and Final Judgment was submitted to the Court, the\ninmate has one or more of the following conditions: is 65 years and older;\nhas chronic lung disease including COPD; has moderate to severe\nasthma; has serious heart conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery\ndisease or cardiomyopathies; has sickle cell disease; is\nimmunocompromised; has severe obesity (e.g. BMI of 30 or higher); has\ndiabetes; has chronic kidney disease and is undergoing dialysis; has liver\ndisease; has cancer; is pregnant; or is a former or current cigarette\nsmoker.\nThe “COVID-19 Emergency End Date” is the date on which Executive\nOrder D 2020 205 issued by Colorado Governor Jared Polis, Declaring a\nDisaster Emergency Due to the Presence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in\nColorado, as subsequently amended or extended, expires and is not\nreplaced by a similar Executive Order in light of the ongoing COVID-19\npandemic.\nDocket No. 96 at 9.  There are no subclasses to the settlement agreement.  Key terms\nof the proposed settlement include that: (1) WCJ will identify medically vulnerable\ninmates during booking, protect them during the remainder of the intake process to the\nextent possible, and provide them with a document stating their status; (2) WCJ will\nattempt to single-cell medically vulnerable inmates in the intake/transition units and will\ncontinue to limit their exposure in the general jail population; (3) WCJ will medically\n5\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 100   Filed 12/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 24\nisolate COVID-19 positive inmates in a non-punitive environment; (4) WCJ will\ncontinue enhanced sanitation and will distribute masks to inmates; (5) healthcare\nprocessionals will monitor medically vulnerable inmates for COVID-19 symptoms and\nwill provide testing to inmates consistent with CDC guidelines; (6) defendant will\nmaintain modified arrest standards to reduce jail population and will advise Weld\nCounty police chiefs to be judicious with jail space on a regular basis; (7) every two\nweeks, WCJ will provide the Chief Judge for the Nineteenth Judicial District of\nColorado and the Colorado Division of Adult Parole a list of all inmates housed at\nWCJ, with a request to the Chief Judge for a docket review for potential judicial action;\n(8) defendant will comply with data reporting requirements and plaintiffs’ counsel will\nnot make additional requests; (9) plaintiffs and the class will release claims for\ninjunctive and declaratory relief arising from COVID-19 at the WCJ, but that does not\ninclude claims concerning conduct that occurs after the date the Consent Decree is\nentered, and it does not include any money damages claims; (10) defendant will pay\ncounsel for plaintiffs $122,387.60 in attorney’s fees and costs; and (11) there is no\nadmission of wrongdoing by defendant.  Docket No. 96 at 5-8.  \nThe parties propose to post notice of the proposed settlement in “portions of the\nWCJ that house medically vulnerable inmates where it is visible to them.”  Id. at 16. \nThe parties have attached their proposed class notice as Exhibit B to their motion. \nDocket No. 96-5.  The notice advises class members who wish to object to the\nsettlement to mail an objection to the Court.  Id. at 3-4.  The parties do not indicate\nhow this method of posting notice would supply notice to “past” or “future” inmates or\nto a medically vulnerable inmate who may not have been placed in the proper area.  \n6\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 100   Filed 12/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 24\nB.  Numerosity\nRule 23(a)(1) requires that the class membership be sufficiently large to warrant\na class action because the alternative of joinder is impracticable.  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(a)(1).  Some courts have held that numerosity may be presumed at a certain\nnumber; however, the Tenth Circuit has never adopted a minimum presumption. \nTrevizo v. Adams, 455 F.3d 1155, 162 (10th Cir. 2006) (upholding district court ruling\nthat a group of eighty-four class members was insufficient to warrant class\ncertification).  The parties estimate that 69% of WCJ’s current population of 500\ninmates is medically vulnerable under CDC guidance, which puts the proposed current\nmembers of the class at 345 persons.  See Docket No. 96 at 11.  Additionally, the\nproposed class includes past inmates and unknown future detainees who are\nmedically vulnerable.  Id.  The parties do not provide an estimate of past inmates who\nare part of the proposed class.  See id. at 10-11.  \nThe inclusion of past and future inmates raises issues.  The parties define the\nclass as “[a]ll past, present, and future inmates housed within the Weld County Jail\nfrom April 7, 2020 through the ‘COVID-19 Emergency End Date’ who are ‘medically\nvulnerable.’”  Id. at 9.  The parties do not define what they mean by “past” inmates.  If\n“past” inmates means inmates who have been released, the parties have not indicated\nhow past inmates will benefit from the requested injunctive relief or how they will\nreceive notice.  Even if the “past” inmates received notice, the parties do not explain\nwhat objections they might have or the risk of confusion they might experience. \nSimilarly, as to “future” inmates, the parties do not define the term or indicate how the\n7\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 100   Filed 12/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 24\nproposed notice posting would provide notice to future inmates.  Moreover, even if\n“future” inmates are included simply in anticipation of turnover among the jail\npopulation, it is unclear to the Court why the class definition requires the inclusion of\nfuture inmates when the proposed relief extends for a defined period of time and\ncovers all medically vulnerable inmates during that time. \nBecause the parties have not supplied information about the number of “past” or\n“future” inmates, the Court considers whether the numerosity requirement is met by the\nnumber of current inmates who are medically vulnerable.  “[W]hen injunctive relief is\nthe only relief requested, even speculative or conclusory representations regarding\nnumerosity will suffice to permit class certification.”  Goodnight v. Shalala, 837 F.\nSupp. 1564, 1582 (D. Utah 1993) (citing Horn v. Associated Wholesale Grocers, Inc.,\n555 F.2d 270, 275-76 (10th Cir. 1977)).  The Court agrees that joinder of\napproximately 345 current inmates would be impracticable and the Court finds that the\nnumerosity requirement is met.\nC.  Commonality\nRule 23(a) requires a district court to ensure that “there are questions of law or\nfact common to the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  Factual differences in the claims\nof the individual class members should not result in the denial of class certification\nwhere common questions of law exist.  Commonality requires that the plaintiff\ndemonstrate that the class members have “suffered the same injury” such that the\nclaims of the class are based on a common contention and that the determination of\nthe truth or falsity of this contention “will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of\n8\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 100   Filed 12/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 24\neach one of the claims in one stroke.”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350.  Even a single\ncommon question will satisfy commonality.  Id. at 359. \nThe parties argue that commonality is met here because the questions of\nwhether WCJ’s conduct has exposed the class to harm or to a substantial risk of harm\ndue to deliberate indifference are common the class.  Docket No. 96 at 12. \nAdditionally, the proposed consent decree represents a common answer.  Id. \n“What matters to class certification . . . is not the raising of common ‘questions'\n– even in droves – but rather, the capacity of a class-wide proceeding to generate\ncommon answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at\n350 (citation omitted).  The Court agrees that the proposed class meets this standard. \nPlaintiffs allege that defendant exhibited deliberate indifference to the risk of COVID-19\non medically vulnerable inmates.  In Shook v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm’rs of the Cnty. of El\nPaso, the district court denied certification for mentally ill inmates at the El Paso\nCounty Jail because “[e]valuation of the claims asserted on behalf of the class would\nrequire examination of the unique circumstances surrounding each incident alleged to\nconstitute a constitutional deprivation.”  No. 02-cv-00651-RPM, 2006 WL 1801379, at\n*9 (D. Colo. June 28, 2006), aff’d, Shook II, 543 F.3d at 600.  By contrast, the relief in\nthis case will not require an examination of unique circumstances – once an inmate is\ncategorized as medically vulnerable, the proposed relief would apply to that person. \nAccordingly, the Court finds that the proposed settlement class satisfies the\ncommonality requirement.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).\n9\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 100   Filed 12/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 24\nD.  Typicality\nRule 23(a)(3) requires that the “claims or defenses of the representative parties\nare typical of the claims or defenses of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  The\ntypicality requirement ensures that the absent class members are adequately\nrepresented by the lead plaintiff such that the interests of the class will be fairly and\nadequately protected in their absence.  Falcon, 457 U.S. at 157 n.13.  Typicality “is\nsatisfied when each class member’s claim arises from the same course of events, and\neach class member makes similar legal arguments to prove the defendant’s liability.”\nMarisol A. v. Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372, 376 (2d Cir. 1997).  “[I]t is well-established that a\nproposed class representative is not typical under Rule 23(a)(3) if the representative is\nsubject to a unique defense that is likely to become a major focus of the litigation.”\nMarcus v. BMW of N. Am., LLC, 687 F.3d 583, 599 (3d Cir. 2012) (internal quotations\nomitted). \nThe parties argue that typicality is met here for the same reason as\ncommonality and because plaintiffs are medically vulnerable and face the same\npotential harms of the proposed class.1  Docket No. 96 at 13.  The named plaintiffs,\n1 Plaintiffs brought their Eighth Amendment claim on behalf of “persons in\ncarceral custody,” while their Fourteenth Amendment claim was brought on behalf of\npretrial detainees.  See Docket No. 7 at 25-27.  While the Eighth Amendment claim has\nboth an objective component, “whether the alleged wrongdoing was objectively harmful\nenough,” and a subjective component, “whether the officials acted with a sufficiently\nculpable mind,” the Fourteenth Amendment claim requires only a showing of the\nobjective component.  Brown v. Flowers, 974 F.3d 1178, 1182 (10th Cir. 2020) (internal\nquotations omitted) (recognizing that Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 576 U.S. 389 (2015)\nabrogated prior Tenth Circuit caselaw that treated the Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendment analyses as identical).  In its order on plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary\ninjunction, the Court found that plaintiffs satisfied their burden under the Eighth\nAmendment standard.  Docket No. 55 at 18 n.9.  Therefore, the Court finds that these\n10\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 100   Filed 12/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 24\nJesus Martinez and Chad Hunter,2 fall within high-risk populations who are particularly\nvulnerable to COVID-19 and are currently being held at WCJ.  Docket No. 96 at 9.  Mr.\nMartinez is 33 years old and suffers from diabetes, asthma, high blood pressure, and\nis currently overweight.  Docket No. 7 at 8.  Mr. Hunter is 46 years old, is\nhypoglycemic, has a history as a smoker, and has a history of substance abuse\ndisorder.  Id. at 10.  Both of these plaintiffs meet the proposed definition of “medically\nvulnerable” inmates.  See Docket No. 96 at 9 (including persons who have diabetes\nand are former cigarette smokers in the definition of medically vulnerable).  Typicality\n“limit[s] the class claims to those fairly encompassed by the named plaintiff’s claims,” \nGen. Tel. Co. of the N.W., Inc. v. E.E.O.C., 446 U.S. 318, 330 (1980), which allows\nself-interested litigation by the named plaintiffs to necessarily advance the interests of\nthe class as a whole.  1 William B. Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions\n(“Newberg”), § 3:29.  The named plaintiffs face similar risks as other medically\nvulnerable inmates due to the contagious nature of COVID-19.  The named plaintiffs\nare not subject to any “unique defense[s],” see Marcus, 687 F.3d at 599, and the\npursuit of the requested relief for themselves will advance the interests of the class as\ntwo separate legal theories do not defeat typicality.\n2 Defendant’s response to plaintiffs’ motion for class certification states that Mr.\nHunter was released on April 15, 2020.  Docket No. 64 at 2.  However, the parties’ joint\nmotion for preliminary approval of the class action settlement, filed on November 30,\n2020, states that Mr. Hunter is currently being held at WCJ.  Docket No. 96 at 9.  While\nMr. Martinez is a pretrial detainee, Docket No. 64 at 2, the parties do not indicate if Mr.\nHunter is currently a pretrial detainee or is serving a sentence.  See Docket No. 96 at 9. \nHowever, because the proposed class definition makes no distinction between\nmedically vulnerable inmates in pretrial versus carceral custody, Docket No. 96-1 at 1-2, \nthis distinction is not material to class certification. \n11\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 100   Filed 12/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 24\na whole.  See Newberg, § 3:29.  Therefore, the Court agrees that the named plaintiffs\nbring claims that are typical of the proposed class – namely, that they are medically\nvulnerable and defendant has exhibited deliberate indifference to the harm that\nCOVID-19 could cause them. \nE.  Adequacy of Representation\nRule 23(a)(4) requires that the class representative “fairly and adequately\nprotect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  As the Supreme Court has\nnoted, the “adequacy-of-representation requirement tends to merge with the\ncommonality and typicality criteria of Rule 23(a), which serve as guideposts for\ndetermining whether maintenance of a class action is economical and whether the\nnamed plaintiff’s claim and the class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the\nclass members will be fairly and adequately protected in their absence.”  Amchem\nProds., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 626 n.20 (1997) (internal quotations omitted). \nAs such, the “inquiry under Rule 23(a)(4) serves to uncover conflicts of interest\nbetween named parties and the class they seek to represent.”  Id. at 625.  To be an\nadequate class representative, the “representative must be part of the class and\npossess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.”  Id. at\n625-26.  The Court has found that the named plaintiffs bring claims typical of the\nproposed class and face the same potential harms.  See Section III.D, supra. \nThe Tenth Circuit has identified two questions relevant to the adequacy of\nrepresentation inquiry: “(1) do the named plaintiffs and their counsel have any conflicts\nof interest with other class members and (2) will the named plaintiffs and their counsel\n12\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 100   Filed 12/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 24\nprosecute the action vigorously on behalf of the class?”  Rutter & Wilbanks Corp. v.\nShell Oil Co., 314 F.3d 1180, 1187-88 (10th Cir. 2002) (citation omitted).  Adequate\nrepresentation depends on, among other factors, an absence of antagonism between\nthe representatives and absentees, and a sharing of interest between representatives\nand absentees.  Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, 985 (9th Cir. 2011).  \nThe parties argue that there is adequate representation because there is no\nconflict between the named plaintiffs and the absent class members and because\nplaintiffs’ attorneys are well-qualified in class action and civil rights matters.  Docket\nNo. 96 at 13-14.  With regard to the first factor, the Court finds that the interests of the\nclass are fairly and adequately protected by the named plaintiffs.  There is nothing in\nthe record or proposed settlement agreement that raises obvious concerns regarding\ninterclass conflicts.  See Amchem, 521 U.S. at 611-12.  With regard to the second\nadequacy factor, plaintiffs’ attorneys are the ACLU of Colorado; Killmer, Lane and\nNewman, LLP; Hutchinson Black and Cook, LLC; Stimson Stancil Labranche Hubbard,\nLLC; and Maxted Law, LLC.  Docket No. 96 at 15.  They maintain that they are\nqualified to represent this action, and there appears to be no dispute as to their\nqualifications.  See id.  The Court finds that counsel and the named plaintiffs\nadequately represent the interests of the class of all current and future WCJ inmates\nwho are medically vulnerable\nF.  Rule 23(b)(2)\nRule 23(b)(2) certification imposes two independent but related requirements:\ndefendant’s actions or inaction must be based on grounds generally applicable to all\n13\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 100   Filed 12/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 24\nclass members and the injunctive relief must be appropriate for the class as a whole. \nShook II, 543 F.3d at 604.  “The rule therefore authorizes an inquiry into the\nrelationship between the class, its injuries, and the relief sought, and we have\ninterpreted the rule to require that a class must be ‘amenable to uniform group\nremedies.’”  Id. (quoting Shook I, 386 F.3d at 973).  Rule 23(b)(2) requires that a single\ninjunction provides relief to each member of the class.  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360. \nThe Tenth Circuit has described two requirements of Rule 23(b)(2):\n[T]he class must be sufficiently cohesive that any classwide injunctive\nrelief can satisfy the limitations of Federal Rule Civil Procedure 65(d) –\nnamely, the requirement that it state its terms specifically; and describe in\nreasonable detail the act or acts restrained or required . . . . Second, [a]\nclass action may not be certified under Rule 23(b)(2) if relief specifically\ntailored to each class member would be necessary to correct the allegedly\nwrongful conduct of the defendant. \n \nShook II, 543 F.3d at 604 (internal citations and quotations omitted). \nThe parties argue that certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate because\nplaintiffs seek uniform standardized procedures to protect inmates from COVID-19. \nDocket No. 96 at 14.  Defendant’s actions and inactions are based on grounds\ngenerally applicable to all class members.  See Shook II, 543 F.3d at 604.  Plaintiffs\nallege that defendant is exhibiting deliberate indifference to the impact of COVID-19 on\nall medically vulnerable inmates, Docket No. 96 at 1, making the ground generally\napplicable to the class.  The Court finds that a single injunction would provide relief to\nall class members and relief would not need to be specifically tailored to each class\nmember.  See Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360; Shook II, 543 F.3d at 604.  The proposed\nconsent decree is “sufficiently cohesive” to satisfy Rule 65(d) and does not avoid\n14\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 100   Filed 12/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 24\n“individual issues . . . by formulating an injunction at a stratospheric level of\nabstraction.”  Shook II, 543 F.3d at 604.  The Court finds that preliminary certification\nunder Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate. \nG.  Rule 23(e) Factors\nRule 23(e) provides that a proposed settlement may only be approved after a\n“finding that it is fair, reasonable, and adequate.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2).  In making\nthis determination, “trial judges bear the important responsibility of protecting absent\nclass members” and must be “assur[ed] that the settlement represents adequate\ncompensation for the release of the class claims.”  In re Pet Food Prods. Liab. Litig.,\n629 F.3d 333, 349 (3d Cir. 2010); see also Amchem, 521 U.S. at 623 (noting that the\nRule 23(e) inquiry “protects unnamed class members from unjust or unfair settlements\naffecting their rights when the representatives become fainthearted before the action is\nadjudicated or are able to secure satisfaction of their individual claims by a\ncompromise”) (citations omitted).\nTo determine whether a proposed settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate,\ncourts consider the following factors: (1) whether the proposed settlement was fairly\nand honestly negotiated; (2) whether serious questions of law and fact exist, placing\nthe ultimate outcome of the litigation in doubt; (3) whether the value of an immediate\nrecovery outweighs the mere possibility of future relief after protracted and expensive\nlitigation; and (4) the judgment of the parties that the settlement is fair and reasonable.\nRutter, 314 F.3d at 1188.  If the settling parties can establish these factors, courts\nusually presume that the proposed settlement is fair and reasonable.  In re Warfarin\n15\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 100   Filed 12/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 24\nSodium Antitrust Litig., 391 F.3d 516, 535 (3d Cir. 2004) (applying an “initial\npresumption of fairness” to a proposed settlement where: (1) it is the result of arm's\nlength negotiations; (2) it is based on sufficient discovery; (3) the proponents of the\nsettlement are experienced in similar litigation; and (4) only a small fraction of the class\nobjected).\nBased on the information available to the Court, the Court notes the following,\nwhich weighs in favor of preliminary approval.  The proposed consent decree was the\nproduct of months of arms-length negotiations between the parties.  Docket No. 96 at\n3.  These negotiations took place after the parties had vigorously litigated a motion for\npreliminary injunction, which the Court granted.  Docket No. 55 at 3 n.2 (“The parties\nalso submitted a volume of exhibits to the Court more typical of a four-day jury trial\nthan a preliminary injunction hearing.”).  The Court finds that the negotiations were\ndone fairly and honestly.\nPlaintiffs believe they would have prevailed at trial, but were uncertain what the\nscope of relief would be.  Docket No. 96 at 4.  Defendant maintains that he would have\nprevailed at trial.  Id.  While plaintiffs prevailed at the preliminary injunction phase, see\nDocket No. 55, plaintiffs must consider the likelihood of success of certifying a class,\nsurviving summary judgment, and succeeding at trial.  Additionally, as plaintiffs note,\nthe scope of relief in an action such as this one is uncertain, particularly given the\nrapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Accordingly, the Court finds that\nthis factor weighs in favor of the proposed settlement. \nNext, the Court must determine whether the value of immediate recovery\noutweighs the mere possibility of future relief.  This factor clearly weighs in favor of the\n16\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 100   Filed 12/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 24\nproposed settlement.  The country is still in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic.  This\nmakes implementation of the COVID-19 measures in the proposed settlement\nagreement much more valuable than waiting until a trial in mid-2021.  While the Court\nhas continued to extend the preliminary injunction, most recently until February 5,\n2021, Docket No. 99, the plaintiffs cannot rely on continued extensions until the trial\ndate.  This factor weighs strongly in favor of the proposed settlement. \nThe final factor the Court must consider is whether the proposed settlement is\nfair and reasonable.  The parties argue that it is because the parties started with the\nCourt’s preliminary injunction as a baseline, considered each parties’ requests for\nmodifications, and considered plaintiffs’ request for attorney’s fees.  Docket No. 96 at\n4-5.  The parties list some of the key aspects of the proposed settlement, which are\nstated in this order under Section III.A.  It is evident that the parties believe that the\nproposed settlement is fair and reasonable and was negotiated at arms-length by\nexperienced counsel.  Should a current inmate find the terms unfair, he or she may file\nan objection to the proposed settlement.  Cf. In re Crocs, Inc. Sec. Litig., 2013 WL\n4547404, at *12 (finding that party opposing settlement agreement could opt-out or file\nobjections).  The Court finds that the presumption of fairness is sufficient to preliminary\napprove the settlement agreement. \nIV.  NOTICE\nNotice is not required to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(2).  See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(c)(2)(A) (“For any class certified under Rule . . . [23](b)(2), the court may direct\nappropriate notice to the class.”) (emphasis added); Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 362 (“The\n17\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 100   Filed 12/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of 24\nRule provides no opportunity for (b)(1) or (b)(2) class members to opt out, and does\nnot even oblige the District Court to afford them notice of the action.”); Shook II, 543\nF.3d at 611 (“Rule 23(c)(2) makes notice . . . optional for (b)(2) classes.”).    \nDespite this, Rule 23(e) requires the Court to “direct notice in a reasonable\nmanner to all class members who would be bound by” a proposed settlement.  Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 23(e)(1)(B).  The parties propose to post notices in portions of WCJ that house\nmedically vulnerable inmates.  Docket No. 96 at 16.  The proposed notice describes\nthe background of the case, lists key terms of the proposed settlement, and states that\na current inmate may object to the proposed settlement by mailing an objection to the\nClerk of Court.  Docket No. 96-5.  The parties argue that posted notice is sufficient\nbecause (1) the Court has already made substantial factual findings about COVID-19\nand WCJ, so objections about the scope of the proposed consent decree will add little\nnew information; (2) the proposed consent decree shows the steps that defendant and\nWCJ will take to protect medically vulnerable inmates, and it would be a drain on staff\nresources to distribute and collect individual notices; and (3) inmates were adequately\nrepresented by class counsel.  Id. at 16-17. \n“[N]otice must be ‘reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise\ninterested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to\npresent their objections.’”  DeJulius v. New England Health Care Emps. Pension Fund,\n429 F.3d 935, 944 (10th Cir. 2005) (quoting Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Trust\nCo., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950)).  The standard under Rule 23(e)(1)(B) is a lower\nstandard than the “best notice practicable under the circumstances” required by a Rule\n18\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 100   Filed 12/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of 24\n23(a)(3) class, which itself does not require actual notice.  See DeJulius, 429 F.3d at\n943-44.  Instead, “[d]ue process does not require notice for absent class members in\nall actions under Rule 23(b)(2), as long as the class members were adequately\nrepresented.”  Pelt v. Utah, 539 F.3d 1271, 1289 (10th Cir. 2008). \nThe Court finds the parties’ first two justifications for posted notice – that the\nCourt has already held an evidentiary hearing so objections about the scope of the\nproposed settlement will add little, and that the proposed settlement shows the steps\ndefendant and WCJ will take to protect medically vulnerable inmates, Docket No. 96 at\n16 – are unrelated to the procedural issue of whether or not notice is reasonably\ncalculated to inform class members of the proposed settlement and the opportunity to\nobject.  The parties’ third justification, that it would be an unnecessary expenditure of\nresources to prepare and distribute individualized notices, is similarly unavailing\nbecause it is unrelated to whether posted notice will reach the desired class members. \nFinally, while adequate representation by class counsel is necessary for preliminary\ncertification, it is not sufficient to make any type of notice “reasonable.”  \nAdditionally, the proposed notice provided by the parties advises inmates to\nmail objections to the Clerk of Court.  Docket No. 96-5 at 4.  The parties have identified\nno authority for identifying the Court or the Clerk of Court as the recipient of class\naction objections.  To the contrary, the practice in this Court is for plaintiffs’ counsel or\na third party administrator to process the objections.  See, e.g., Menocal et al v. The\nGEO Group, Inc., No. 14-cv-02887-JLK-MEH, Docket No. 163 at 4 ¶ 7 (D. Colo. Jan.\n14, 2019) (approving notice procedure where class counsel selected third party\nadministrator). \n19\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 100   Filed 12/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of 24\nThe parties’ vague statement that WCJ will “post notice in portions of the WCJ\nthat house medically vulnerable inmates where it is visible to them” does not allow the\nCourt to determine whether such notice will reasonably appraise class members of the\nproposed settlement.  See Docket No. 96 at 16.  The parties do not indicate how this\nprocedure would provide notice to “past” or “future” class members or medically\nvulnerable inmates who are placed in the wrong area of the jail.  See id. at 16-17. \nMoreover, they do not discuss whether such notice will be provided in both English and\nSpanish.  See id.  If the parties revise the definition of class members, some of these\nissues may disappear.  And perhaps there is no reason to believe that medically\nvulnerable detainees will be inadvertently assigned to the wrong area.  However,\nbefore approving the proposed settlement, the Court needs more information on these\nissues.  Therefore, the Court finds that the proposed notice procedure is not\nreasonably calculated to apprise class members of the settlement. \nV.  CLASS COUNSEL\nWhen certifying a class, a Court “must appoint class counsel.”   Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(g).  In appointing class counsel, the Court must consider: \n(A)(i) the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential\nclaims in the action; (ii) counsel’s experience in handling class actions,\nother complex litigation, and the types of claims asserted in the action; (iii)\ncounsel’s knowledge of the applicable law; and (iv) the resources that\ncounsel will commit to representing the class; [and] (B) may consider any\nother matter pertinent to counsel’s ability to fairly and adequately\nrepresent the interests of the class[.]\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1).  Plaintiffs’ current attorneys – the ACLU of Colorado; Killmer,\nLane and Newman, LLP; Hutchinson Black and Cook, LLC; Stimson Stancil Labranche\n20\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 100   Filed 12/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of 24\nHubbard, LLC; and Maxted Law, LLC – request to be appointed class counsel.  Docket\nNo. 96 at 15.  Plaintiffs’ attorneys state that they are experienced civil rights lawyers\nwho have years of experience handling class actions in federal and state courts.  Id.  \nCounsel have sufficient experience in class actions and their knowledge of the\napplicable law, as exhibited in the case up to this point, weighs in favor of their\nappointment.  Similarly, counsel have demonstrated that they have the resources to\ncommit to the litigation.  It is unusual to appoint five law firms for a class of about 345\npeople.  However, in this case there is no common fund constituting the settlement, so\nattorneys’ fees will not diminish the fund to the detriment of the class.  Instead, the\nsettlement includes a set amount of fees.  Docket No. 96 at 8.  Importantly, the relief to\nthe class is injunctive, not monetary.  Id.  Therefore, the Court finds that it is appropriate\nto appoint plaintiffs’ counsel as class counsel.  Cf. Torres-Vallejo v. Creativexteriors,\nInc., 220 F. Supp. 3d. 1074, 1087 (D. Colo. 2016) (appointing one law firm lead counsel\nand three other law firms as additional class counsel). \nVI.  PRISON LITIGATION REFORM ACT (“PLRA”)\nThe PLRA3 requires that, before approving a class settlement in a prison\ncondition case, the Court must find that the relief is “narrowly drawn.”  18 U.S.C.\n§§ 3626(a)(1), (c)(1).  Under the PLRA, relief is narrowly drawn if it “extends no further\nthan necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive\n3 This statute extends to relief requested by pretrial detainees.  See 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3626(g)(3) (defining “prisoner” as, among other things, “any person subject to\nincarceration . . . who is accused of . . . violations of criminal law”).  The Weld\nCounty Jail is a “prison” within the meaning of the statute.  See id. § 3626(g)(5)\n(defining “prison” as, among other things, any “local facility that incarcerates or detains\n[individuals] accused of . . . violations of criminal law”).\n21\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 100   Filed 12/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 22 of 24\nmeans necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.”  Id. at § 3626(a)(1).  In\ndetermining whether the proposed relief is narrowly drawn, “[t]he court shall give\nsubstantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal\njustice system caused by the relief.”  Id.  However, “Congress did not intend the PLRA\nto alter class certification requirements under Rule 23.”  Shook I, 386 F. 3d at 971.  The\nCourt must determine whether class certification is appropriate before turning to the\nquestion of whether the proposed relief complies with the PLRA.  See id.  \nPart of the proposed settlement requires the WCJ to keep its population as low\nas possible, while protecting public safety.  Docket No. 96-1 at 3.  Currently, the WCJ\nwill accept detainees charged with class three felonies, felonies enhanced by\n“VRA/Domestic Violence,”4 misdemeanor charges enhanced by “VRA/Domestic\nViolence,” protection order violations, and probation and parole warrants.  Docket No.\n85-2 at 2.  WCJ does not currently accept detainees arrested on municipal warrants,\ncivil commitments, or detox refusals.  Id.  The proposed settlement requires WCJ to\nmaintain this standard until the COVID-19 Emergency End Date or until the WCJ\nhousing unit that is currently closed for construction is reopened.  Docket No. 96-1 at 6. \nIf the housing unit reopens before the COVID-19 Emergency End Date, then a different\nset of less stringent intake measures will apply to keep the WCJ population low while\nmaintaining public safety.  Id.  \nThe Court finds that the proposed relief is narrowly drawn and any impact on\npublic safety has been mitigated.  The Court finds that the proposed settlement\n4 The parties’ motion does not define “VRA,” but the Court presumes that if refers\nto the Colorado Victim Rights Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. § 24-4.1-301 et. seq. \n22\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 100   Filed 12/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 23 of 24\nagreement complies with the PLRA because the majority of its provisions are applicable\nonly to medically vulnerable inmates, but see Docket No. 96 at 6 (providing two cloth\nmasks per non-medically vulnerable inmates), and it remains in effect only during the\nlength of the pandemic.  Id. at 9 (setting the COVID-19 Emergency End Date to the\nexpiration of Executive Order D 2020 205 Declaring a Disaster Emergency Due to the\nPresence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Colorado).  Additionally, the policies\nrestricting the persons the WCJ will accept have been in place since September 2,\n2020, with no evidence of any adverse impact on public safety.  See Docket No. 85-2 at\n1. \nVII.  CONCLUSION\nThe Court will hold in abeyance a decision on the Joint Motion for Preliminary\nApproval of Class Action Settlement, Certification of a Class and Appointment of Class\nCounsel, and Permission to Post Class Notice [Docket No. 96] so that the parties can\nsupplement their motion.  The supplemental briefing shall discuss locations for posting\nnotice within the WCJ in English and Spanish, the location for sending objections that\ndoes not involve the Court, and inclusion of “past” and “future” inmates in the definition\nof the class.  \nWherefore, it is \n23\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 100   Filed 12/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 24 of 24\nORDERED that the parties shall file supplemental briefs on or before\nDecember 18, 2020. \nDATED December 11, 2020\nBY THE COURT:\n__________________________\nPHILIP A.

Peters, Esq., of Hall & Evans, \nL.L.C., respectfully submits his Answer, Defenses, and Affirmative Defenses to Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief [ECF 7] (“Complaint”), and in support \nthereof admits, denies, and avers as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \nSince the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Sheriff, the leadership team of \nthe Weld County Sheriff’s Office (“WCSO”), and all of its deputies have worked hard to \ndetermine an appropriate response sufficiently advancing the various applicable interests \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 65   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 24\n \ninvolved—the need to operate the Weld County Jail (“WCJ”); the need to protect the \nsafety and health of inmates, detainees, and staff; and the need to protect the public of \nWeld County and the State of Colorado. As set forth in all of the different submissions to \nthis Court by the Sheriff and his staff to date, and through the Sheriff’s testimony at the \nApril 30, 2020, hearing before this Court, the Sheriff and his staff have engaged and \ncontinue to engage in ongoing efforts to meet all these goals. Plaintiffs’ Complaint and \ntheir entire argument and evidentiary presentation throughout this matter focused only on \none of the applicable factors—the health of the Plaintiffs. Such a myopic focus is not and \ncannot be the only applicable consideration for the Sheriff, this Court, and the public. \nRESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS’ INTRODUCTION \n1.  Paragraph 1 of the Complaint is a purely prefatory statement containing a \nwide variety of legal conclusions and self-serving statements from Plaintiffs, to which no \nresponse is required. To the extent any allegations in Paragraph 1 are deemed factual in \nnature, the Sheriff denies them. \n2.  Paragraph 2 of the Complaint is a purely prefatory statement containing a \nwide variety of legal conclusions and self-serving statements from Plaintiffs, to which no \nresponse is required.1 To the extent any allegations in Paragraph 2 are deemed factual \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiffs’ Complaint contains 71 footnotes, the first appearing in Paragraph 2. \nThe footnotes generally contain references purportedly supporting the general assertions \nin Plaintiffs’ Complaint. To the extent Plaintiffs intend to incorporate the actual footnoted \nmaterial  as  allegations  in  the  Complaint,  the  Sheriff  objects  to  such  incorporation. \nMoreover, it would be unduly burdensome for the Sheriff and his counsel, or indeed this \nCourt, to review all of these sources to determine if they actually support the referenced \nallegations. The Sheriff states all such sources in their entirety speak for themselves. The \nSheriff denies all allegations in all footnotes inconsistent with the entirety of the referenced \nmaterials. The Sheriff also denies any subjective and selective characterization of the \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 65   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 24\n \nin nature, the Sheriff admits the entire world is in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe Sheriff denies any remaining allegations deemed factual. \n3.  Paragraph 3 of the Complaint is a purely prefatory statement containing a \nwide variety of legal conclusions and self-serving statements from Plaintiffs, to which no \nresponse is required. Further, the statements in this paragraph require expert opinions \nand are not factual allegations capable of being admitted or denied. Published guidance \nand public statements from public health authorities in their entirety speak for themselves \nand do not require a response. To the extent any allegations in Paragraph 3 are deemed \nfactual in nature, the Sheriff admits the entire world is in the midst of the COVID-19 \npandemic. The Sheriff denies any remaining allegations deemed factual in Paragraph 3. \n4.  Paragraph 4 of the Complaint is a purely prefatory statement containing a \nwide variety of legal conclusions and self-serving statements from Plaintiffs, to which no \nresponse is required. Further, the statements in this paragraph require expert opinions \nand are not factual allegations capable of being admitted or denied. Published guidance \nand public statements from public health authorities in their entirety speak for themselves \nand do not require a response. To the extent any allegations in Paragraph 4 are deemed \nfactual in nature, the Sheriff admits the entire world is in the midst of the COVID-19 \npandemic. The Sheriff denies any remaining allegations deemed factual in Paragraph 4. \n5.  Paragraph 5 of the Complaint is a purely prefatory statement containing a \nwide variety of legal conclusions and self-serving statements from Plaintiffs, to which no \n                                                 \nreferenced materials by Plaintiffs. Finally, if any of the footnotes are deemed to include \nallegations, the Sheriff denies all such allegations in all such footnotes. \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 65   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 24\n \nresponse is required. Further, the statements in this paragraph require expert opinions \nand are not factual allegations capable of being admitted or denied. Published guidance \nand public statements from public health authorities in their entirety speak for themselves \nand do not require a response. Likewise, public health data in its entirety speaks for itself \nand requires no response. To the extent any allegations in Paragraph 5 are deemed \nfactual in nature, the Sheriff denies them. \n6.  Paragraph 6 of the Complaint is a purely prefatory statement containing a \nwide variety of legal conclusions and self-serving statements from Plaintiffs, to which no \nresponse is required. Further, the statements in this paragraph require expert opinions \nand are not factual allegations capable of being admitted or denied. Published guidance \nand public statements from public health authorities in their entirety speak for themselves \nand do not require a response. To the extent any allegations in Paragraph 6 are deemed \nfactual in nature, the Sheriff admits that, as a general matter and prior to the onset of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, inmates in jails are often within a few feet of another, and that some \nColorado jails including the WCJ have decreased their jail population during the COVID-\n19 pandemic. The Sheriff denies any remaining allegations in Paragraph 6. \n7.  Paragraph 7 of the Complaint is a purely prefatory statement containing a \nwide variety of legal conclusions and self-serving statements from Plaintiffs, to which no \nresponse is required. To the extent any allegations in Paragraph 7 are deemed factual in \nnature, the Sheriff admits some inmates in the WCJ have been on 23-hour-per-day \nlockdowns  during  some  specific  periods  of  time.  The  Sheriff  denies  any  remaining \nallegations deemed factual in Paragraph 7. \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 65   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 24\n \n8.  Paragraph 8 of the Complaint is a purely prefatory statement containing a \nwide variety of legal conclusions and self-serving statements from Plaintiffs, to which no \nresponse is required. To the extent any allegations in Paragraph 8 are deemed factual in \nnature, the Sheriff denies them. \n9.  Paragraph 9 of the Complaint is a purely prefatory statement containing a \nwide variety of legal conclusions and self-serving statements from Plaintiffs, to which no \nresponse is required. To the extent any allegations in Paragraph 9 are deemed factual in \nnature, the Sheriff admits a small number of inmates and staff tested positive for COVID-\n19, but denies any outbreak of, or quick spread of, COVID-19 actually occurred at the \nWCJ. The Sheriff denies any remaining allegations deemed factual in Paragraph 9. \n10.  Paragraph 10 of the Complaint is a purely prefatory statement containing a \nwide variety of legal conclusions and self-serving statements from Plaintiffs, to which no \nresponse is required. Public health data in its entirety speaks for itself and requires no \nresponse. To the extent any allegations in Paragraph 10 are deemed factual in nature, \nthe Sheriff denies them. \n11.  Paragraph 11 of the Complaint is a purely prefatory statement containing a \nwide variety of legal conclusions and self-serving statements from Plaintiffs, to which no \nresponse is required. Further, the statements in this paragraph require expert opinions \nand are not factual allegations capable of being admitted or denied. Data regarding jail \npopulations in its entirety speaks for itself and requires no response. To the extent any \nallegations in Paragraph 11 are deemed factual in nature, the Sheriff denies them. \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 65   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 24\n \n12.  Paragraph 12 of the Complaint is a purely prefatory statement containing a \nwide variety of legal conclusions and self-serving statements from Plaintiffs, to which no \nresponse is required. To the extent any allegations in Paragraph 12 are deemed factual \nin nature, the Sheriff denies them. \n13.  Paragraph 13 of the Complaint is a purely prefatory statement containing a \nwide variety of legal conclusions and self-serving statements from Plaintiffs, to which no \nresponse is required. To the extent any allegations in Paragraph 13 are deemed factual \nin nature, the Sheriff denies them and further denies that Plaintiffs “represent” a class. \nRESPONSE TO “JURISDICTION AND VENUE” \n14.  Responsive to the allegations in Paragraph 14 of the Complaint, the Sheriff \nadmits Plaintiffs contend their constitutional rights allegedly were violated, but states \nPlaintiffs’ claims are without merit and Plaintiffs are not entitled to any of the relief sought \nin the Complaint to the extent alleged in Paragraph 14. The Sheriff denies 42 U.S.C. § \n1983 provides an independent basis for this Court’s jurisdiction, to the extent Plaintiff may \nassert such claims in proper fashion to the extent alleged in Paragraph 14. The Sheriff \ndenies this action is a “class action” as no class has been certified. The Sheriff denies all \nother allegations in Paragraph 14 while noting that federal rules and statutes in their \nentirety  speak  for  themselves,  and  specifically  denies  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  any \ndeclaratory relief, any injunctive relief, any class certification, or any other relief. \n15.  Responsive to the allegations in Paragraph 15 of the Complaint, the Sheriff \nadmits Plaintiffs contend their constitutional rights allegedly were violated, but states \nPlaintiffs’ claims are without merit and Plaintiffs are not entitled to any of the relief sought \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 65   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 24\n \nin the Complaint to the extent alleged in Paragraph 15. The Sheriff admits this Court has \nsubject matter jurisdiction over matters involving federal questions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1331. The Sheriff denies all other allegations in Paragraph 15 while noting federal rules \nand statutes in their entirety speak for themselves. Further the Sheriff denies the Court \nhas subject matter jurisdiction over any claims brought by Thomas Carranza, Thomas \nLewis, Michael Ward, or Chad Hunter, as they are no longer housed in the WCJ and their \nclaims  are  therefore  moot.  The  Sheriff  also  denies  the  Court  has  subject  matter \njurisdiction  over  any  class  because  no  class  certification  is  legally  and  factually \nappropriate and because the claims of the class representatives are moot. \n16.  Responsive to the allegations in Paragraph 16 of the Complaint, the Sheriff \ndoes not contest the propriety of venue in this case to the extent asserted in Paragraph \n16  of  the  Complaint,  but  states  Plaintiffs’  claims  are  without  merit.  The  remaining \nallegations set forth in Paragraph 16, if any, are denied. \nRESPONSE TO “PARTIES” \n17.  Responsive to the allegations in Paragraph 17 of the Complaint, the Sheriff \nadmits Thomas Carranza was 55 years old on the date the Complaint was filed. The \nSheriff denies Mr. Carranza is housed in the WCJ and denies Mr. Carranza did not receive \nappropriate medical care while housed in the WCJ. The Sheriff states all of Mr. Carranza’s \nmedical records in their entirety speak for themselves and denies all allegations in \nParagraph 17 inconsistent therewith. The Sheriff states the WCJ only possesses limited \nmedical records and medical information as to Mr. Carranza and all other inmates housed \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 65   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 24\n \nin the WCJ. The Sheriff lacks knowledge or information sufficient to admit or deny the \nremaining allegations in Paragraph 17, and hence denies them. \n18.  Responsive to the allegations in Paragraph 18 of the Complaint, the Sheriff \nadmits Jesus Martinez is housed in the WCJ; admits Mr. Martinez has a bond of $10,000 \nand a parole hold; and admits Mr. Martinez was 33 years old on the date the Complaint \nwas filed. The Sheriff states all of Mr. Martinez’s medical records in their entirety speak \nfor themselves and denies all the allegations in Paragraph 18 inconsistent therewith.  The \nSheriff states the WCJ only possesses limited medical records and medical information \nas to Mr. Martinez and all other inmates housed in the WCJ. The Sheriff lacks knowledge \nor information sufficient to admit or deny the remaining allegations in Paragraph 18, and \nhence denies them. \n19.  Responsive to the allegations in Paragraph 19 of the Complaint, the Sheriff \nadmits Richard Barnum was 54 years old on the date the Complaint was filed. The Sheriff \ndenies Mr. Barnum is housed in the WCJ.

In support of this motion, they state as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs brought this case as a class action, alleging Defendant Sheriff Reams \nacted with deliberate indifference to the lives and health of medically vulnerable persons \nin his custody in the Weld County Jail (“WCJ”) by failing to take necessary measures to \nprevent the spread of COVID-19 and to protect such medically vulnerable persons from \nCOVID-19.  Plaintiffs brought two claims for declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 19\nU.S.C.  §  1983,  alleging  violation  of  the  Due  Process  Clause under the  Fourteenth \nAmendment,  and  for  cruel  and  unusual  punishment  under  the  Eighth  Amendment.  \nDefendant Reams denied any wrongdoing and contended that he was taking appropriate \nmeasures to protect inmates at the WCJ. \nThis Court held a preliminary injunction hearing in this matter on April 30, 2020.  \nBy Order dated May 11, 2020, this Court entered a detailed preliminary injunction setting \nforth steps Defendant must take to identify and to protect medically vulnerable inmates at \nthe Weld County Jail. [Dkt. 55].  The preliminary injunction has been extended multiple \ntimes, most recently through December 9, 2020.  [Dkt. 93]. \nWith the benefit of this Court’s preliminary injunction ruling, the parties engaged in \na protracted, arms-length negotiation to attempt to resolve this dispute.  Those efforts \nhave proven successful.  The parties now bring this motion seeking preliminary approval \nof their class action settlement and approval of a settlement class, which if approved \nwould result in the entry of a detailed Consent Decree, in the form attached hereto as \nExhibit A, that ensures that measures remain in place to protect class members from \nCOVID-19 within the WCJ through the duration of this public health emergency. \nPreliminary Approval of the Parties’ Settlement \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) requires the “court’s approval” for any settlement that includes \ncertification of a class.  Before approving a class settlement, the Court must hold a hearing \nto determine whether the settlement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate,” after considering \nwhether:  (A) the class representatives and class counsel have adequately represented \nthe class; (B) the proposal was negotiated at arms-length; (C) the relief provided for the \nclass is adequate; and (D) the proposal treats class members equitably relative to each \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 19\nother.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2).  The Tenth Circuit has recently affirmed that the key \nquestions when undertaking this inquiry are whether:  (1) the settlement was fairly and \nhonestly negotiated, (2) serious legal and factual questions placed the litigation's outcome \nin doubt, (3) the immediate recovery was more valuable than the mere possibility of a \nmore  favorable  outcome  after  further  litigation,  and  (4)  [the  parties]  believed  the \nsettlement was fair and reasonable. See Elna Sefcovic, LLC v. TEP Rocky Mtn., LLC, \n807 F. App’x 752, 757 (10th Cir. 2020) (quoting Tennille v. W. Union Co., 785 F.3d 422, \n434 (10th Cir. 2015)). The settlement the parties seek to have approved by this Court \nmeets all of these criteria. \nA. The Settlement Was Fairly and Honestly Negotiated. \nThe proposed Consent Decree that the parties have placed before this Court was \nnegotiated at arms-length by attorneys with no conflicts of interest who vigorously \nadvocated for their respective clients’ positions.  The negotiations began in July 2020 \nwith telephone calls among counsel and exchanges of draft settlement papers.  When \nthe  negotiations  stalled,  a  breakthrough  was  achieved  through  direct  phone  calls \nbetween the Legal Director of the ACLU of Colorado and the County Attorney for Weld \nCounty.  Once back on track, multiple drafts of a proposed agreement were exchanged, \nwith compromises made by both sides.  That spirited, arms-length negotiation process \nultimately proved successful in allowing the parties to achieve a resolution that both sides \nagree will promote safety in the WCJ with respect to COVID-19, while allowing Sheriff \nReams to protect the public and operate the WCJ as required by law.  There has been \nno  suggestion  of  any  conflicts  of  interest  with  respect  to  the  negotiation  of  this \nagreement, and there were none. \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 19\nB. Serious Legal and Factual Questions Placed the Litigation’s Outcome in \nDoubt. \n \nWhile Plaintiffs’ counsel believe that Plaintiffs would have prevailed at trial, they \nhad no certainty as to what the scope of relief would be in an action such as this one.  \nGiven that COVID-19 is a new disease and the scope of knowledge about it is constantly \nevolving, there is inherent uncertainty as to what relief the Court would ultimately order \nif liability were found at trial.  For his part, Defendant Sheriff Reams has continued to \nmaintain that he did not act with deliberate indifference to the rights of Plaintiffs, and if \nthis case were to proceed to trial, Defendant believes this Court would have determined \nthe Sheriff has not been deliberately indifferent. In light of the foregoing, both sides \nperceived uncertainty as to the litigation’s outcome if the matter proceeded to trial. \nC. Immediate Recovery Is More Valuable Than Proceeding To Trial. \nBoth sides to this dispute have used settlement negotiation to achieve a creative \nresult which includes immediate protections that may not have been provided even if \nPlaintiffs prevailed at trial.  For example, the proposed Consent Decree contains modified \narrest standards for the WCJ that would be hard to have achieved through litigation, and \ndetailed information-sharing requirements and restrictions that similarly would have been \nhard to achieve through litigation.  Moreover, given the immediacy of the COVID-19 crisis, \nwaiting until after trial in mid-2021 to secure the relief agreed to in the proposed Consent \nDecree would have sacrificed much of the value of litigating in the first place. \nD. The Parties’ Settlement Is Fair and Reasonable. \nThe parties’ settlement negotiations began with an understanding to use the \nrequirements this Court imposed through its preliminary injunction as a baseline for the \nnegotiations, as those requirements already had the Court’s imprimatur of fairness.  The \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 19\nparties then considered each side’s requests for modifications to those procedures, as \nwell as Plaintiffs’ demand for attorney’s fees.  Key terms of the final agreements reached \nin the accompanying proposed Consent Decree are as follows: \n1)  For purposes of the proposed Consent Decree, the designation of who is \n“medically vulnerable” is defined in line with U.S. Centers for Disease \nControl  and  Prevention  (“CDC”)  guidance  current  as  of  the  date  the \nproposed Consent Decree and Final Judgment was submitted to the Court, \nyet subject to modification if the CDC’s guidance changes; \n2)  WCJ will identify medically vulnerable inmates during booking and intake, \nincluding screening for specific medical conditions set forth in the proposed \nConsent Decree, in English or Spanish at each inmate’s election.  Persons \nidentified as medically vulnerable will be protected from exposure to others \nduring the remainder of the intake process to the extent possible; \n3)  WCJ  will  attempt  to  single-cell  medically  vulnerable  inmates  in  the \nintake/transition units consistent with CDC guidelines, and the Consent \nDecree contains specific procedures to minimize exposure to others if single \ncells are not available based on the population size of WCJ; \n4)  WCJ will continue to limit exposure of medically vulnerable persons in the \ngeneral jail population, including with respect to cell assignments and with \nrespect to time spent outside of cells; \n5)  WCJ will permit the maximum amount of daily out-of-cell time for inmates \nconsistent with social distancing protocols and allowable cohorting; \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 19\n6)  WCJ will medically isolate COVID-19-positive inmates in an isolation unit \nconsistent  with  CDC  guidelines  and  ensure  that  medical  isolation  for \nCOVID-19 inmates is in a non-punitive environment, allowing access to \npersonal and recreational items which can be effectively sanitized; \n7)  WCJ will continue stringent enhanced sanitation procedures throughout the \njail to help control the spread of COVID-19; \n8)  WCJ will distribute masks, with the option to provide two cloth masks per \ninmate for non-medically vulnerable persons, and disposable masks for \nmedically vulnerable persons, with the disposable masks to be replaced at \nthe  frequency  consistent  with  CDC  guidelines  and  manufacturer \nrecommendations; \n9)  To help limit the spread of COVID-19 in the community outside of the jail, \ninmates will be given masks to take with them upon release from the WCJ; \n10)  Medically  vulnerable  inmates  will be  regularly  monitored  by  healthcare \nprofessionals for COVID-19 symptoms; \n11)  WCJ will provide testing for inmates for COVID-19 consistent with CDC \nguidelines; \n12)  Remote visitation opportunities will be continued; \n13)  Inmates will receive regular information and updates regarding COVID-19 \nprevention; \n14)  Persons identified as “medically vulnerable” at intake will be provided with \na document stating that they have been so designated; \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 19\n15)  Defendant  will  maintain  modified  arrest  standards,  varying  somewhat \ndepending on the status of an ongoing jail construction project, that will \nremain  in  place for the duration  of  the  COVID-19  emergency.  These \nmodified arrest standards, set forth as an attachment to the proposed \nConsent Decree, restrict who WCJ will accept, by category of offense; \n16)  On a regular basis, Defendant will advise chiefs of police in Weld County to \nbe judicious with jail space and to minimize the scope of arrestees in their \njurisdictions and maximize the number of persons subject to arrest who are \nissued summonses or personal recognizance bonds in their jurisdictions;    \n17)  Every two weeks, WCJ will provide the Chief Judge for the Nineteenth \nJudicial District of Colorado and the Colorado Division of Adult Parole a list \nof all inmates housed at WCJ, with a request to the Chief Judge for a docket \nreview for potential judicial action; \n18)  Defendant will comply with robust data reporting requirements to Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel, so as to allow class counsel to monitor the performance of WCJ \nunder the Consent Decree.  Plaintiffs, and Class counsel when acting on \nbehalf  of  class  members,  agree  not  to  circumvent  these  agreed  data \nreporting requirements by making additional requests under the Colorado \nOpen Records Act or Colorado Criminal Justice Records Act relating to \nWCJ’s COVID-19 response or population statistics; \n19)  Plaintiffs and the Class will release claims for injunctive and declaratory \nrelief  arising  from  COVID-19  at  the  WCJ,  and  associated  costs  and \nattorney’s fees, accruing through the date of the Consent Decree.  The \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 19\nrelease does not include claims concerning conduct that occurs after the \ndate the Consent Decree is entered, and it does not include any money \ndamages claims; \n20)  The duration of the Consent Decree is through the time that the Executive \nOrder of  the  Governor of  the  State of  Colorado  declaring  a  statewide \nemergency for COVID-19 expires and is not renewed or replaced with an \nequivalent declaration; \n21)  Defendant will pay counsel for Plaintiffs $122,387.60 for attorney’s fees and \ncosts; and \n22)  The parties agree that the Consent Decree is entered into for purposes of \nsettlement and should not be construed as an admission of wrongdoing. \nAll parties believe the foregoing terms are a fair and reasonable resolution to this \ndispute.  The resolution contains detailed, concrete steps that are consistent with CDC \nbest practices.  They reflect the strong desire of all parties to ensure that COVID-19 \nexposure at WCJ is minimized to the extent reasonably possible. \nFor the foregoing reasons, the parties request that the Court provide its preliminary \napproval of the proposed settlement embodied in the Consent Decree, and find that it \nsatisfies the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2). \nCertification of Settlement Class and Appointment of Class Counsel \nPlaintiffs and Defendant request that this Court certify a settlement class in this \naction pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), and that it appoint counsel for Plaintiffs as \nclass counsel.  The settlement class the parties seek to have certified is a class of the \nfollowing individuals: \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 19\nAll past, present, and future inmates housed within the Weld County Jail \nfrom April 7, 2020 through the “COVID-19 Emergency End Date” who are \n“medically vulnerable.”  \n \nAn  inmate  is “medically  vulnerable” if,  pursuant  to  CDC guidelines for \ncorrectional facilities like the WCJ which exist as of the date this proposed \nConsent Decree and Final Judgment was submitted to the Court, the inmate \nhas one or more of the following conditions: is 65 years and older; has \nchronic lung disease including COPD; has moderate to severe asthma; has \nserious heart conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease or \ncardiomyopathies; has sickle cell disease; is immunocompromised; has \nsevere obesity (e.g. BMI of 30 or higher); has diabetes; has chronic kidney \ndisease  and  is  undergoing  dialysis;  has  liver  disease;  has  cancer;  is \npregnant; or is a former or current cigarette smoker.   \n \nThe “COVID-19 Emergency End Date” is the date on which Executive Order \nD 2020 205 issued by Colorado Governor Jared Polis, Declaring a Disaster \nEmergency Due to the Presence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Colorado, \nas subsequently amended or extended, expires and is not replaced by a \nsimilar Executive Order in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. \n \nThis proposed settlement class fully satisfies all of the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, \nand specifically for certification of a class under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \nA. The Proposed Class Representatives  \n  The two proposed class representatives fall within the high-risk populations who \nare particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 and particularly likely to suffer severe illness, life-\naltering complications, or death as a result of exposure to the virus.1  The proposed class \nrepresentatives are  Plaintiff Jesus Martinez and Plaintiff Chad Hunter.  Both of the \nproposed class representatives are being held at WCJ. \n \n \n                                            \n1 Five of the original plaintiffs in this action voluntarily dismissed their claims \nbecause they have been released or are in the process of being released from WCJ. \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 19\nB. The Proposed Class Satisfies the Requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 232 \n  Class certification is proper under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) if: (1) the class is so \nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or \nfact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are \ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly \nand adequately protect the interests of the class.  In addition, the proposed class must be \ncertifiable under one of the three sub-provisions of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b). Here, Plaintiffs \nseek certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), because the party opposing the class \nhas acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making \nappropriate final injunctive relief with respect to the class as a whole. \n1.  The proposed class complies with Rule 23(a) \ni.  The  proposed  class  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  would  be \nimpracticable. \n \nA class must be sufficiently numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  The impracticability of the joinder requirement does not require \nthat joinder is impossible, but only that the plaintiffs “will suffer a strong litigational \nhardship or inconvenience if joinder is required.”  Cook v. Rockwell Intern. Corp., 151 \nF.R.D. 378, 384 (D. Colo. 1993).  “In determining whether a proposed class meets the \nnumerosity requirement, ‘the exact number of potential members need not be shown, \n‘and a court ‘may make common sense assumptions to support a finding that joinder \n                                            \n2 Defendant states he jointly moves for class certification for purposes of settlement \nonly. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) (allowing certification of “class proposed to be certified for \npurposes of settlement”). If the Court does not approve this settlement and enter the \nConsent Decree and Final Judgment, or if the settlement is otherwise not finalized, then \nDefendant reserves the right to contest class certification. \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 19\nwould be impracticable.’” In re Thornburh Mortgage, Inc. Sec. Litig., 912 F. Supp. 2d 1178, \n1221 (D.N.M. 2012) (internal quotation omitted). The parties estimate that 69% of the \nWCJ’s current population of 500 inmates is medically vulnerable according to CDC \nguidance current as of the date and time this Joint Motion was submitted.  The class also \nincludes a large number of unknown and unnamed future class members, who will be \ndetained in the Weld County Jail in the future and are medically vulnerable to COVID-19.  \nGiven these numbers, and the fact that the class also includes persons who will be \narrested and detained at the jail in the future, joinder is impracticable and numerosity is \nsatisfied.  See Helmer v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 2014 WL 1133299 at *3-4 (D. \nColo. Mar. 21, 2014); Newberg on Class Actions § 25:4 (4th ed. 2016) (“Even a small \nclass of fewer than 10 actual members may be upheld if an indeterminate number of \nindividuals are likely to become class members in the future or if the identity or location \nof many class members is unknown for good cause.”); Jack v. Am. Linen Supply Co., 498 \nF.2d 122, 124 (5th Cir. 1974) (numerosity requirement satisfied when class included \n“unknown, unnamed future” class members rendering joinder “certainly impracticable”). \nii.  The proposed class representatives present issues of fact and law \nin common with the class. \n  \nTo satisfy commonality, the “[p]laintiff must allege a ‘common contention of such a \nnature that it is capable of class-wide resolution – which means that determination of its \ntruth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims \nin one stroke.’” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011).  “What matters \nto class certification . . . is not the raising of common ‘questions’ – even in droves – but \nrather, the capacity of a class-wide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive \nthe resolution of the litigation.”  Id. (internal quotation omitted).  For the purposes of \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 19\ncommonality, “even a single common question will do.” Id. at 359. Courts have repeatedly \nfound commonality is met where the class’s claims arise from a common course of \nconduct  on  the  part  of  the  defendant.    See  Kerns  v.  Spectralink  Corp.,  2013  WL \n27380785, at *2 (D. Colo. July 1, 2003).  Likewise, in civil rights lawsuits challenging \nconditions of detention, commonality is satisfied where the lawsuit challenges “systemic \npolicies and practices that allegedly expose inmates to a substantial risk of harm,” even \nwhere there are “individual factual differences among class members.”  Parsons v. Ryan, \n754 F.3d 657, 681-82 (9th Cir. 2014) (collecting cases across the country). \nIn this case, there are multiple common questions of law and fact pertaining to the \nWCJ’s policies and practices regarding COVID-19.  These include questions of whether \nthe WCJ’s course of conduct has exposed the class to harm and/or a substantial risk of \nharm due to its deliberate indifference to the risks of COVID-19, and whether WCJ has \nfailed to take appropriate preventative measures on a system-wide basis. Even more \nimportantly, the answers to these questions drive the resolution of this litigation and have \nresulted in the proposed Consent Decree, which aims to protect medically vulnerable \ninmates from exposure to, and death or serious injury from, COVID-19 to the maximum \nextent possible while they are housed in the WCJ. \niii.  The proposed class representatives’ claims are typical of those of \nthe class. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) requires that the putative class representatives’ claims be \ntypical of those of the class.  “[A] named plaintiff’s claim is ‘typical’ when it arises out of \nthe same event, practice or course of conduct of the defendant, and is based on the same \nlegal theory on which the class claims are predicated.”  Murphy v. Lenderlive Network, \nInc., 2014 WL 5396165, at *4 (D. Colo. Oct. 22, 2014).  “Provided the claims of the Named \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 19\nPlaintiffs and class members are based on the same legal or remedial theory, differing \nfact situations of the class members do not defeat typicality.”  DG ex rel. Stricklin v. \nDevaugh, 594 F.3d 1188, 1198-99 (10th Cir. 2010).  For the same reason that there are \noverwhelmingly common issues of fact and law, the Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the \nclass.  See Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 349 n.5 (“The commonality and typicality requirements \nof Rule 23(a) tend to merge.”). \n  Here, the named Plaintiffs have the same claims and face the same potential \nharms as members of the proposed class.  Named Plaintiffs, similarly to members of the \nclass, are both medically vulnerable. \niv.  The  proposed  class  representatives  and  class  counsel  can \nadequately represent the case. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4) requires that “the representative parties will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the class.” The adequacy requirement ensures that \nthere are no potential “conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek \nto represent.”  Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 625 (1997).  “Resolution \nof two questions determines legal adequacy: (1) do the named plaintiffs and their counsel \nhave any conflicts of interest with other class members, and (2) with the named plaintiffs \nand their counsel prosecute the action vigorously on behalf of the class?”  Rutter & \nWilbanks Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., 314 F. 3d 1180, 1187-88 (10th Cir. 2002) (internal citation \nomitted).  Adequate representation is usually presumed absent contrary evidence.  See \n1 Newberg on Class Actions § 3:72 (5th Ed. 2019). \n  First, there is no conflict between the named Plaintiffs and the members of the \nclass. As described above, the named Plaintiffs and class members have the same injury \nand seek the same relief.  Likewise, Plaintiffs’ counsel, consisting of Hutchinson, Black \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 19\nand Cook, LLC in cooperation with the ACLU of Colorado and Killmer, Lane & Newman, \nLLP; Stimson Stancil LaBranche Hubbard LLC; and Maxted Law LLC, are well-qualified \nand highly experienced in class action and civil rights matters, and have done extensive \nwork investigating this action.  Counsel are exceptionally well versed in class actions and \nconstitutional law, with decades of experience litigating such cases, and have sufficient \nresources to vigorously prosecute this case. \n2.  The proposed class is appropriate under Rule 23(b)(2) \nCertification  under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(b)(2)  is  appropriate  where,  as  here, \ndefendants “acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class[.]”  A \ncourt may certify a Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) class where “a single injunction or declaratory \njudgment would provide relief to each member of the class.”  Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 \nS. Ct. 830, 851-52 (2018) (internal quotation marks omitted). The claims raised and the \nrelief sought by Plaintiffs in this action are precisely the sort that Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) \nwas designed to facilitate: “[c]ivil rights cases against parties charged with unlawful, class \nbased discrimination are prime examples” of proper (b)(2) actions.  Amchem Prods., 521 \nU.S. at 614.  Here, Plaintiffs seek uniform standardized practices and procedures to \nprotect inmates from exposure to COVID-19.  This system-wide, process-based relief is \nexactly the type of single injunction that would benefit all members of the proposed class \n– and falls squarely within the purview of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) as a result. In light of \nthe foregoing, the parties respectfully request a Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) class be certified. \n \n \n \n14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 19\nAPPOINTMENT OF CLASS COUNSEL \n  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1), at the time of class certification, the Court \n“must appoint class counsel.”  Undersigned counsel for Plaintiffs who brought this action \nrespectfully request to be appointed class counsel. \n  Undersigned counsel are a group of experienced civil rights lawyers from the \nACLU of Colorado, Killmer, Lane and Newman, LLP, Hutchinson Black and Cook, LLC,   \nStimson Stancil Labranche Hubbard, LLC, and Maxted Law LLC who quickly organized \nin the early days of the COVID-19 crisis to protect inmates in the WCJ. They have devoted \nsubstantial  resources  to  prosecute  this  case,  acting  on  short  notice  to  secure  a \npreliminary injunction, and have continued to advocate zealously for their clients. \n  Counsel have years of experience handling class actions in federal and state \ncourts in Colorado and elsewhere in the United States.  Their work on this matter to date \ndemonstrates their competence to be appointed as class counsel here. \nNOTICE TO THE CLASS \nNotice is not required to certify a Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) class, which is the Rule \n23 subsection under which the parties propose to certify a class. See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(c)(2)(A) (“For any class certified under Rule 23(b)(1) or (b)(2), the court may direct \nappropriate notice to the class.” (emphasis added)); see also Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 362 \n(“The Rule provides no opportunity for (b)(1) or (b)(2) class members to opt out, and does \nnot even oblige the District Court to afford them notice of the action.”); Skinner v. Uphoff, \n175  F.  App’x  255,  257-58  (10th  Cir.  2006)  (“Where,  as  here,  a  class  is  certified \nunder  Rule 23(b)(2), notice is discretionary.”) (affirming trial court’s decision not to \nprovide notice to inmate class members before granting summary judgment, in a civil \n15 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 19\nrights  case  seeking  only  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief  regarding  conditions  of \nconfinement); Pelt v. Utah, 539 F.3d 1271, 1289 (10th Cir. 2008) (“Due process does not \nrequire notice for absent class members in all actions under Rule 23(b)(2), as long as the \nclass members were adequately represented.”). Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(1) does require \nnotice to absent class members prior to settlement, however.  That notice must be \nprovided “in a reasonable manner.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(1)(B).   \nThough the Court has the discretion to select whatever manner of notice it believes \nappropriate, the parties suggest a “reasonable manner” to provide notice would be to post \nnotices in portions of the WCJ that house medically vulnerable inmates where it is visible \nto them.  The form of the notice proposed to be posted, to which the proposed Consent \nDecree attached hereto as Exhibit A would be appended, is attached hereto as Exhibit B.  \nIt is not necessary to give individual notices to all class members, for several reasons.  \nFirst, this Court has already held an evidentiary hearing and has already made substantial \nfactual findings about COVID-19 and the WCJ, so objections about the scope of the \nConsent Decree will likely add little new information. Second, the proposed Consent \nDecree shows the myriad agreed steps which Defendant and the WCJ will continue to \ntake to protect medically vulnerable inmates from COVID-19. While class members are \nentitled to submit objections, providing posted notice is a “reasonable manner” to inform \ninmates of this settlement and the inmates’ option to file an objection. It would also be a \nsignificant  and  unnecessary  expenditure  of  resources  for  WCJ  staff  to  prepare  to \ndistribute notices to individual inmates and then collect objections, when the staff’s time \nand resources should instead be devoted to protecting the health and safety of inmates. \n16 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 19\nAnd finally, posted notice is reasonable here because inmates “were adequately \nrepresented” by class counsel. Pelt, 539 F.3d at 1289. Plaintiffs’ counsel have thoroughly \ninvestigated and litigated this case. They have continued to monitor the situation in the \nWCJ, have continued to communicate with inmates, and have vigorously represented the \ninterests  of  all  class  members  throughout  this  litigation  and  the  negotiation  of  this \nproposed class settlement. In short, all class members were adequately represented. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the parties respectfully request that the Court:  (a) \npreliminarily approve the settlement embodied in the proposed Consent Decree attached \nas Exhibit A; (b) certify a class for purposes of settlement as described herein; (c) appoint \nthe counsel listed below for Plaintiffs as class counsel; (d) approve the form of notice \nattached hereto as Exhibit B and instruct Defendant to post one copy of it in each WCJ \nhousing unit which houses medically vulnerable inmates; and (e) set a date and time for \na fairness hearing approximately six weeks from the date the Court grants this motion. \n \nDated and jointly and respectfully submitted this 30th day of November, 2020. \ns/ Daniel David Williams        s/ Matthew J.

Plaintiffs further understand \nthat factual matters now unknown to them may have given or may hereinafter give rise \nto disputes that are currently unknown, unanticipated, and unsuspected. Plaintiffs, on \nbehalf of themselves and for and on behalf of the Class as is anticipated to be reflected \nin the aforementioned joint motion for conditional approval of the class settlement, \nacknowledge this Consent Decree is intended to and does release both known and \nunknown claims and causes of action for injunctive and declaratory relief, including \nthose which would seek by means of declaratory or injunctive relief to address subject \nmatters governed by this Order.  \n(2)  Restriction on CORA Requests.  Neither Plaintiffs, nor counsel when acting \non behalf of Plaintiffs or members of the Class, nor employees or agents of Plaintiffs, \nshall request or cause to be requested from Defendant or any employee of the Weld \nCounty Sheriff’s Office under the Colorado Open Records Act or the Colorado Criminal \nJustice Records Act the following: (a) any information or documents relating to \nDefendant’s response to COVID-19 at the WCJ; or (b) any information or data relating \nto average daily population or population statistics at the WCJ.  \nC. Covenant Not to Sue \nPlaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and for and on behalf of the Class as is \nanticipated to be reflected in the aforementioned joint motion for conditional approval of \nthe class settlement, agree not to sue Defendant or any employee of the Weld County \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96-1   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 17\nSheriff’s Office for injunctive or declaratory relief regarding or relating to COVID-19 for \nconduct that occurred prior to the date of this Consent Decree and Final Judgment.   \nD. Agreement Respecting Taxes \nPlaintiffs are responsible for any tax liability from any taxing authority with respect \nto the payment of Attorney Fees and Costs as specified below and Defendant shall \nhave no tax liability with respect thereto.   \nE.  Obligations of Defendant \nFrom the date of this Consent Decree and Final Judgment, until and including the \ndate on which Executive Order D 2020 205 issued by Colorado Governor Jared Polis, \nDeclaring a Disaster Emergency Due to the Presence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in \nColorado, as subsequently amended or extended, expires and is not replaced by a \nsimilar Executive Order in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (the “COVID-19 \nEmergency End Date”), Defendant shall: \n(1) Identify all medically vulnerable inmates during the booking and intake \nprocess and inform any medically vulnerable inmates that they have been so \ndesignated. The scope of what makes an inmate medically vulnerable shall be updated \nto conform with current CDC guidance in the event the CDC modifies the aforesaid \nguidelines, which update shall be self-executing upon counsel for Defendant providing \ncounsel for Plaintiffs and members of the Class either (a) an official order from the CDC \nwhich would be self-authenticating pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 902(1), or (b) an equivalent \nofficial publication from the CDC’s website which otherwise would be self-authenticating \npursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 902(5).  All inmates must be asked if they have any of the \nconditions that would classify them as “medically vulnerable” as defined herein at \nintake.  The descriptions for screening questions must, at a minimum, mirror the level of \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96-1   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 17\nspecificity in the definition of “medically vulnerable” set forth above, and must be given \nin Spanish for persons who indicate a preference for conditions to be listed in Spanish. \nThe descriptions must also provide a list of the most common conditions that meet the \ndefinitions of “immunocompromised,” and “liver disease.”  Self-reported conditions are \nto be accepted as true unless and until there is definitive medical evidence to the \ncontrary.  Until the process of determining whether inmates in intake have one or more \nof the aforesaid conditions which would cause them to be designated as medically \nvulnerable is completed, inmates should not be exposed to other inmates and should be \nexposed only to the smallest number of WCJ staff as possible.   \n(2) Take actions to keep the WCJ population as low as possible, while protecting \npublic safety, so as to maximize the number of medically vulnerable inmates who can \nbe housed in a single-cell, which shall consist of the following: \na.  Maintain the “Emergency Arrest Standards Due To COVID-19/Jail \nConstruction” included in ECF 85-2 filed with the Court in this Lawsuit \nuntil either the COVID-19 Emergency End Date or the date the WCJ \nhousing unit closed for construction as indicated to the Court in ECF \n85-2 is reopened, whichever is sooner. \nb.  Upon said housing unit being reopened, if sooner, subsequently \nmaintain “Modification to Arrest Standards Due To COVID-19” \nattached hereto as Exhibit A-1, until the COVID-19 Emergency End \nDate.1 \n                                            \n1 With respect to the offenses identified in Paragraph 4 under the heading “The \nWeld County Jail Will Accept” in Exhibit A-1, for anyone booked into the WCJ in the \nnarrow additional categories specified in said Paragraph 4, Defendant will give notice to \nthe Weld County Attorney, who will in turn notify counsel for the Class. \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96-1   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 17\nc.  Retain the right no longer than the COVID-19 Emergency End Date, in \nDefendant’s sole discretion, to reinstitute the “Emergency Arrest \nStandards Due To COVID-19/Jail Construction” included in ECF 85-2 \nfiled with the Court in this Lawsuit, or substantially similar arrest \nstandards if appropriate based on WCJ inmate population, per capita \nwhen considering all housing units then open and the housing units’ \nthen-current uses, increasing to a same or similar percentage level \nwhich motivated the filing of ECF 85-2 with the Court in this Lawsuit. If \nDefendant needs to reinstitute such Arrest Standards, Defendant by \nand through his counsel shall, contemporaneously with such \nreinstitution, notify Mark Silverstein at msilverstein@aclu-co.org and \nNicole Loy at nloy@aclu-co.org. \nd.  Disseminate regular advisements to the Weld Chiefs of Police to be \njudicious about minimizing the scope of arrestees in their jurisdictions \nand maximizing the scope of persons who are issued a summons or \ngiven a bond upon personal recognizance in their jurisdictions. \ne.   At least one time every fourteen days: \ni.  Provide a list of all inmates currently housed in the WCJ to the \nChief Judge of the District Court for Colorado’s 19th Judicial \nDistrict with a copy to Mark Silverstein at msilverstein@aclu-\nco.org and Nicole Loy at nloy@aclu-co.org, requesting a docket \nreview for potential judicial action;  \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96-1   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 17\nii.  Provide a list of all inmates subject to parole holds to the \nColorado Division of Adult Parole, requesting a review for \npotential parole action; and \niii.  Provide Mark Silverstein at msilverstein@aclu-co.org and \nnloy@aclu-co.org with an identification of which inmates in the \nWCJ are classified as “medically vulnerable” pursuant to this \nConsent Decree, for a lookback period of the prior fourteen days \ndefined as the two-weeks-previous Monday at 05:00:00 AM \nthrough the previous Sunday at 05:00:01 AM, thus resulting in \nfourteen (14) days of reported data, at 05:00:00 AM each day of \nsaid lookback period. Mr. Silverstein, for himself and on behalf \nof all counsel who entered an appearance for Plaintiffs or the \nClass or both in the Lawsuit, agrees such identification shall be \nused only by counsel acting on behalf of Plaintiffs or members \nof the Class and shall be used only for class counsel purposes. \nf.  With respect to each WCJ inmate classified as “medically vulnerable” \nas set forth herein and who is currently in WCJ general population or in \nthe intake/transition units, or who may subsequently booked into the \nWCJ through and including the COVID-19 Emergency End Date, \npromptly furnish to each such inmate a written notification that such \ninmate has been classified as “medically vulnerable” and is at a higher \nrisk for experiencing adverse health consequences from contracting \nCOVID-19, if contracted, based on the intake screening of such \ninmate. This form will contain such inmate’s name and date of birth, \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96-1   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 17\nthe date such inmate’s intake screening was conducted, and the initials \nand/or signature of the medical professional who conducted it. An \nexemplar of this form is attached hereto as Exhibit A-2. \ng.  If necessary to maintain low jail population within the WCJ, utilize \nstatutory authority contained in C.R.S. § 17-26-109 to grant time \ncredits to sentenced prisoners. \n(3) Ensure the following respecting intake/transition units within the WCJ: \nmedically vulnerable inmates admitted to WCJ’s intake/transition units are housed in a \ncell within such unit alone and away from other inmates; if it is not possible to house a \nmedically vulnerable inmate alone in a cell within an intake/transition unit due to the \nWCJ’s physical layout, population level, and classification needs, the inmate must be \nhoused in a cell within an intake/transition unit with no more than one other inmate, \nwhich inmate must also be a medically vulnerable inmate, in accordance with cohorting \npractices the Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) specifically outlines and endorses; \nand if despite this allowance, it still is not possible to house a medically vulnerable \ninmate either alone or with only one other medically vulnerable inmate in a cell within an \nintake/transition unit due to the WCJ’s then-existing physical layout, population level, \nand classification needs, and no other option is apparent, Detentions Division Deputies \nwill contact their Shift Sergeant for guidance immediately, and this existing policy will be \nmaintained subject to the WCSO’s maximum staffing ability. \n(4) Ensure the following for all inmates:  Continue the WCSO’s existing policy of \nensuring,  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  considering  the  WCJ’s  physical  layout, \npopulation level, and classification needs, the following respecting general population \nunits within the WCJ: medically vulnerable inmates are treated as a Special Management \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96-1   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of\n17\npopulation in the WCJ; upon completing the intake/ transition unit quarantine protocol and \ntransferring to WCJ general population, a medically vulnerable inmate is not housed in a \ncell with an inmate who is not medically vulnerable and an inmate who is not medically \nvulnerable is not housed in a cell with a medically vulnerable inmate; and medically \nvulnerable  inmates  remain  in  current  cohorted  “family  units”  to  the  extent  they  are \ncohorted only with one other medically vulnerable inmate in their cell. \n(5) Allow the maximum amount of daily out-of-cell time WCJ can provide inmates \nwhile following cohorting and social distancing protocols. \n(6) Require WCJ Detentions Division staff to ensure enhanced sanitation in the \nWCJ housing units; prior to medically vulnerable inmates entering any WCJ common \narea, which includes bathrooms, an EPA-approved disinfectant spray which combats \nCOVID-19 as certified by the EPA will be sprayed on all surfaces open for use by such \ninmates, allowing for recommended contact time for complete disinfection to occur \nbefore such inmates enter; medically vulnerable inmates will be encouraged to practice \nsocial distancing continuously (to supplement the existing placement of thick black \ngaffers tape throughout the WCJ for visual representation of six feet apart from person \nto person), to disinfect any commonly used equipment on their way out and their way in, \nand to increase their own cleaning practices to include frequent hand washing and \npersonal sanitation; medically vulnerable inmates who willfully refuse to adhere to \nrecommended practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19 despite such \nencouragements will be noted in the WCJ records management system; personal \nhygiene supplies and bottles of an EPA-approved disinfectant spray will remain \navailable to all inmates, inclusive of medically vulnerable inmates, without cost; in the \nevent the WCJ inmate population reaches a low enough threshold that “medically \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96-1   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of\n17\nvulnerable” inmates can be further distanced from non-“medically vulnerable” inmates, \nthen they shall be, while recognizing that limiting movement from one housing unit to \nanother to ensure prevention of cross-contamination from one population to another \npopulation is consistent with public health guidance in a correctional setting; WCJ will \nmaintain increased supplies of bottles of an EPA-approved disinfectant spray and \nmasks to ensure all inmates have access to both masks and such disinfecting spray at \nall times; when necessary and only in a medically-sound manner that does not \naerosolize droplets that may contain COVID-19 or otherwise lead to increased spread of \nCOVID-19, power washers may be used on water-resistant surfaces, when applicable, \nto enhance cleaning; when necessary, only Trustee inmates who are both properly \ntrained in biohazard cleanup and outfitted with proper personal protective equipment will \nbe utilized to clean up areas previously occupied by an inmate confirmed to have tested \npositive for COVID-19.  WCJ shall provide increased professional cleaning services to \naugment the enhanced sanitation efforts of Detentions Division staff if warranted by the \nsituation. \n(7) Ensure that all inmates shall have access to at least two cloth masks or at \nleast one disposable mask at all times. WCJ shall monitor mask usage by all inmates; \nall WCJ staff (and third-party contractors) shall be required to wear a face mask at all \ntimes when interacting in any manner with inmates, and WCJ shall monitor mask usage \nby such staff; WCJ shall provide reusable cloth masks to inmates who are not medically \nvulnerable and ensure such inmates are provided the opportunity to wash said cloth \nmasks every three days; WCJ shall provide disposable masks to medically vulnerable \ninmates and such masks will be replaced in accordance with CDC guidelines and \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96-1   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of\n17\nmanufacturer recommendations, or sooner if said masks become soiled or damaged. \nWCJ will continue to provide a mask to all inmates who are released from the WCJ. \n(8) Ensure medical monitoring for medically vulnerable inmates housed within the \nWCJ: qualified medical staff will perform four “daily checks” on medically vulnerable \ninmates consisting of temperature checks and full symptom screenings. \n(9) Ensure that symptom screening shall be dictated, at minimum, by then-\ncurrent CDC guidelines and will be according to the attached second updated screening \nprotocol (attached as Exhibit A-3 to this Consent Decree). \n(10)  Provide testing for all inmates according to then-current CDC guidelines \nas soon as possible following the report of one or more symptoms for COVID-19 \nconsistent with CDC screening questions, without imposing additional requirements \nbeyond the CDC screening questions, although Defendant may make testing more \nfrequently available. Testing shall be performed as soon as possible from the time of the \nreport.  When an inmate tests positive for COVID-19 or is designated by a health care \nprofessional as presumptive positive for COVID-19, the WCJ will follow current CDC \ncriteria for testing, quarantine, and isolation. These criteria have changed since CDC \nguidelines for correctional facilities were originally issued and may continue to change \nas new data points are made available to and accounted for by the CDC.  \n(11)  Continue implementation of the following protocol in both intake/transition \nunits and general population units: an inmate in the WCJ who is symptomatic for or \ntests positive for COVID-19 is isolated in a medical isolation unit in the WCJ per current \nCDC criteria. These criteria have changed since CDC guidelines for correctional \nfacilities were originally issued and may continue to change as new data points are \nmade available to and accounted for by the CDC. \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96-1   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of\n17\n(12)  Ensure that medical isolation is a non-punitive environment and inmates \nshall have access to personal items, such recreational materials which can be \neffectively sanitized, and time outside of their cell while in medical isolation;  \n(13) Continue to allow remote visitation for inmates with any visitor, including \npersonal, jail-based behavioral, legal, or others; however, nothing in this agreement \nprohibits or discourages allowing for in-person visitation in compliance with CDC \nguidelines. Video visitation from the WCJ’s front lobby shall remain a free service. \n(14) Provide informational updates to inmates housed within the WCJ, both via \npaper as appropriate and via video message, as to best practices on how to prevent the \nspread of COVID-19, which shall include, as part of the intake process, an initial viewing \nof a previously prepared video addressing best practices for preventing the spread of \nCOVID-19;  \n(15) Furnish to the ACLU of Colorado, via email to Mark Silverstein at \nmsilverstein@aclu-co.org and Nicole Loy at nloy@aclu-co.org, on or before 11:59:59 \nPM Mountain Time on Tuesday of every week, the following WCJ data for the lookback \nperiod which is defined as the previous Monday at 05:00:00 AM through Sunday at \n05:00:01 AM, thus resulting in seven (7) days of reported data, at 05:00:00 AM each \nday of said lookback period: \na.  Average daily inmate population as logged at 05:00:00 AM each day of \nthe lookback period; \nb.  Average daily population of medically vulnerable inmates as logged at \n05:00:00 AM each day of the lookback period; \nc.  Total number of medically vulnerable inmates identified during the \nintake screening process each day of the lookback period. \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96-1   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of\n17\nd.

Total number of inmates transferred to a hospital for care each day \nduring the lookback period due to COVID-19. \nThe procedures set forth above may be modified as necessary by further Order from the \nCourt. In addition, as set forth in Section III.E.2 above, Defendant by and through his \ncounsel shall furnish Mr. Silverstein with an identification of which inmates in the WCJ \nare classified as “medically vulnerable” pursuant to this Consent Decree, for a lookback \nperiod of the prior fourteen days defined as the two-weeks-previous Monday at 05:00:00 \nAM through the previous Sunday at 05:00:01 AM, thus resulting in fourteen (14) days of \nreported data, at 05:00:00 AM each day of said lookback period. Defendant shall furnish \nMr. Silverstein with such identification every fourteen days, that is, with every other \ntransmission of the data set forth in this paragraph which Defendant is furnishing to Mr. \nSilverstein on a weekly basis. Mr. Silverstein, for himself and on behalf of all counsel \nwho entered an appearance for Plaintiffs or the Class or both in the Lawsuit, agrees \nsuch identification shall be used only by counsel acting on behalf of Plaintiffs or \nmembers of the Class and shall be used only for class counsel purposes. \nF.

The federal \nDistrict Court for Colorado held a preliminary injunction hearing in this matter on April 30, 2020.  \nBy Order dated May 11, 2020, the court entered a detailed preliminary injunction setting forth \nsteps WCJ was required to take to identify and to protect medically vulnerable inmates at the Weld \nCounty Jail.  The preliminary injunction has been extended multiple times, most recently through \nDecember 9, 2020. \n \nCounsel for the proposed class and counsel for the Weld County Sheriff have spent several \nmonths attempting to reach an agreement to resolve this lawsuit.  They have reached a proposed \nsettlement agreement in the form of a proposed Consent Decree and Final Judgment, which is \ndescribed below.  The Court must decide whether to approve the Consent Decree.  Before doing \nso, you have the opportunity to submit any objection to the Court.  Please be advised that if you \nfail to strictly comply with the procedures and deadline for filing objections to the proposed \nsettlement, you will lose any opportunity to object to any aspect of the proposed Consent Decree. \n \nPROPOSED CONSENT DECREE \n \nTo resolve this dispute, the parties have agreed to request that the Court enter the attached \nproposed Consent Decree as an Order of the Federal District Court.  A summary of the key terms \nof the proposed Consent Decree is as follows: \n \n1)  For purposes of the proposed Consent Decree, the designation of who is “medically \nvulnerable” is defined in line with U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) \nguidance current as of the date the proposed Consent Decree and Final Judgment was \nsubmitted to the Court, yet subject to modification if the CDC’s guidance changes; \n2)  WCJ will identify medically vulnerable inmates during booking and intake, including \nscreening for specific medical conditions set forth in the proposed Consent Decree, in \nEnglish or Spanish at each Class member’s election.  Persons identified as medically \nvulnerable will be protected from exposure to others during the remainder of the intake \nprocess to the extent possible; \n3)  WCJ will attempt to single-cell medically vulnerable inmates in the intake/transition units \nconsistent with CDC guidelines, and the Consent Decree contains specific procedures to \nminimize exposure to others if single cells are not available based on the population size of \nWCJ; \n1  EXHIBIT B\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96-5   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 4\n4)  WCJ will continue to limit exposure of medically vulnerable persons in the general jail \npopulation, including with respect to cell assignments and with respect to time spent outside \nof cells; \n5)  WCJ will permit the maximum amount of daily out-of-cell time for inmates consistent with \nsocial distancing protocols and allowable cohorting; \n6)  WCJ will medically isolate COVID-19-positive inmates in an isolation unit consistent with \nCDC guidelines and ensure that medical isolation for COVID-19 inmates is in a non-\npunitive environment, allowing access to personal and recreational items which can be \neffectively sanitized; \n7)  WCJ will continue stringent enhanced sanitation procedures throughout the jail to help \ncontrol the spread of COVID-19; \n8)  WCJ will distribute masks, with the option to provide two cloth masks per inmate for non-\nmedically vulnerable persons, and disposable masks for medically vulnerable persons, with \nthe disposable masks to be replaced at the frequency consistent with CDC guidelines and \nmanufacturer recommendations; \n9)  To help limit the spread of COVID-19 in the community outside of the jail, inmates will be \ngiven masks to take with them upon release from the WCJ; \n10) Medically vulnerable inmates will be regularly monitored by healthcare professionals for \nCOVID-19 symptoms; \n11) WCJ will provide testing for inmates for COVID-19 consistent with CDC guidelines; \n12) Remote visitation opportunities will be continued; \n13) Inmates will receive regular information and updates regarding COVID-19 prevention; \n14) Persons identified as “medically vulnerable” at intake will be provided with a document \nstating that they have been so designated; \n15) Defendant will maintain modified arrest standards, varying somewhat depending on the \nstatus of an ongoing jail construction project, that will remain in place for the duration of \nthe  COVID-19  emergency.    These  modified  arrest  standards,  which  are  listed  as  an \nattachment to the proposed Consent Decree, restrict who WCJ will accept, by category of \noffense; \n16) On a regular basis, Defendant will advise chiefs of police in Weld County to be judicious \nwith jail space and to minimize the scope of arrestees in their jurisdictions and maximize \nthe number of persons subject to arrest who are issued summonses or personal recognizance \nbonds in their jurisdictions; \n  2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96-5   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 4\n17) Every two weeks, WCJ will provide the Chief Judge for the Nineteenth Judicial District of \nColorado and the Colorado Division of Adult Parole a list of all inmates housed at WCJ, \nwith a request to the Chief Judge for a docket review for potential judicial action; \n18) Defendant will comply with robust data reporting requirements to Plaintiffs’ counsel, so as \nto allow class counsel to monitor the performance of WCJ under the Consent Decree.  \nPlaintiffs,  and  Class  counsel  when  acting  on  behalf  of  class  members,  agree  not  to \ncircumvent these agreed data reporting requirements by making additional requests under \nthe Colorado Open Records Act or Colorado Criminal Justice Records Act relating to WCJ’s \nCOVID-19 response or population statistics; \n19) Plaintiffs and the Class will release claims for injunctive and declaratory relief arising from \nCOVID-19 at the WCJ, and associated costs and attorney’s fees, accruing through the date \nof the Consent Decree.  The release does not include claims concerning conduct that occurs \nafter the date the Consent Decree is entered, and it does not include any money damages \nclaims; \n20) The duration of the Consent Decree is through the time that the Executive Order of the \nGovernor of the State of Colorado declaring a statewide emergency for COVID-19 expires \nand is not renewed or replaced with an equivalent declaration; \n21) Defendant will pay counsel for Plaintiffs $122,387.60 for attorney’s fees and costs; and \n22) The parties agree that the Consent Decree is entered into for purposes of settlement, and \nshould not be construed as an admission of wrongdoing. \nREASONS FOR PROPOSING COURT APPROVAL OF THE CONSENT DECREE \n \nAll parties believe this proposed Consent Decree is fair and reasonable.  It is the result of \na lengthy negotiation between the two sides.  Particularly in light of the risks of prevailing if the \ncase had gone to trial, and the considerable discretion the Court would have had to decide what to \ninclude in any permanent injunction, Plaintiffs’ counsel believes the relief described above exceeds \nwhat they likely could have secured on behalf of the class had the case going to trial.    \n \nPROCEDURE AND DEADLINES TO OBJECT TO THE CONSENT DECREE \n \n  The Court has set a hearing to consider whether to approve the proposed Consent Decree.  \nThat hearing is set to occur on December ____, 2020 at ____ at the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Colorado. \n \nIf you agree with the proposed Consent Decree, or do not wish to object to it, you are not \nrequired to take any action at all.     \n \n  If you wish to object to the Consent Decree, you must do so in writing, with any written \nobjections submitted no later than ________________.   \n \nYour written objections should be addressed as follows: \n  3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 96-5   Filed 11/30/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 4\n \n    Clerk of the Court \n    RE:  Thomas Carranza, et al. v.

INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs seek to subject the Sheriff to several discovery requests—some of which \nthe Sheriff perceived as reasonable and expressed a willingness to comply subject to \ncertain equally reasonable conditions, and others of which he perceived as harassing and \noppressive.  However,  under  the  law  governing  early  discovery  requests  including \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 34   Filed 04/20/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 11\n \nFed.R.Civ.P. Rule 26(d)(1), Plaintiffs were required to present the Court with substantial \n“good cause” for the totality of their requests. Yet, they offer the Court argument devoid \nof evidentiary support. The Court should partially grant the Motion within the boundaries \nof the Sheriff’s previously-stated agreement below, and otherwise deny the Motion. \nII.  BACKGROUND \nInitially, the Sheriff denies Plaintiffs’ assertion any procedures, customs, policies, \nor practices at the Weld County Jail (“WCJ”) were a response to Plaintiffs’ lawsuit. The \nSheriff also denies Plaintiffs’ assertion any of the extremely small number of inmates \ntesting positive for COVID-19 at the WCJ were exposed due to the conduct of the Sheriff \nor the Weld County Sheriff’s Office (“WCSO”). Despite this disagreement, the Sheriff’s \ncounsel attempted to work with opposing counsel as to the parameters of what eventually \nbecame ECF 31, but negotiations broke down based on opposing counsel’s failure to \nengage the Sheriff’s legitimate requests.. For the Court’s edification, the relevant conferral \ncircumstances are attached as Exh. A. \n1.  As conclusively detailed in the Sheriff’s Declaration, but more importantly by \nthe significant evidentiary attachments submitted along with the Declaration, the Sheriff \nand the WCSO began taking substantial steps beginning on February 27, 2020—well \nbefore any outbreak of COVID-19 in Weld County proper or before the current minor \noutbreak within the WCJ—to combat the spread of COVID-19. [ECF 26-1 to 26-9.] \n2.  In fact, of the substantial steps taken beginning on February 27, 2020, virtually \nall of them were taken before 11:59 PM on April 6, 2020—the day before anyone \nattributable to the Sheriff, the WCSO, or the Sheriff’s counsel were even aware of the \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 34   Filed 04/20/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 11\n \nprospect of the above-captioned litigation being filed. [See generally ECF 26-1 to 26-9; \nsee also ECF 26-1 at 3-21.] \n3.  On April 7, 2020, the Sheriff, the WCSO, and the Sheriff’s counsel learned of \nthis litigation being filed. \n4.  On April 9, 2020, the Sheriff’s counsel conferred with Plaintiffs’ counsel on the \nparameters of a potential inspection of the WCJ and agreed on an inspection protocol, \nthe relevant portions of which are attached to this Response as Exh. B. \n5.  The inspection occurred on Friday, April 10, 2020. [ECF 26-1 at 21 ¶ 86.] During \nthe inspection, both sides’ expert were given a tour of the WCJ for approximately 3 hours \nand 15 minutes including donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (“PPE”), \nduring which time all participants were escorted by two WCSO personnel for their safety \nand security, viewed whatever areas they desired of WCJ operations, and were permitted \nto ask all questions they desired on the WCSO response to COVID-19. [Id.] Plaintiffs have \nnot challenged this description of the April 10, 2020, inspection despite it being on the \nCourt’s docket for more than seven days. \n6.  Thereafter, and even after filing an uninvited and non-conferred “Notice of \nSupplemental Evidence and Authority” in violation of PAB Civ. Prac. Std. III.B.2, Plaintiffs \nwithdrew their request for a TRO. [See ECF 29, ECF 30.]1 \n                                            \n1 In ECF 28, ECF 28-1, and ECF 31, Plaintiffs violated the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) by including the purported individually \nidentifiable health information of a person not yet dead 50 years.  See 45 C.F.R. § \n160.103, ¶ (2)(iv) in definition of “protected health information” under HIPAA. \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 34   Filed 04/20/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 11\n \n7.  After close of business April 15, 2020, Plaintiffs’ counsel emailed the Sheriff’s \ncounsel to obtain counsel’s position on Plaintiffs’ early-discovery request. [Exh. A at 4-5.] \n8.  More than two hours before response deadline, the Sheriff’s counsel set forth \nareas of agreement to Plaintiffs’ sought-after discovery with conditions on compliance \n(data), one area of partial agreement (WCSO policies and procedures relating to COVID-\n19 but only in the context of hearing exhibits), and one area of total disagreement (second \ninspection to which Plaintiffs asserted entitlement). [Exh. A at 1-2.] The Sheriff’s counsel \nrequested a substantive response from Plaintiffs to the concerns and issues raised. \n9.  Thereafter,  the  Sheriff’s  counsel  received  only  the  following  inaccurate \nstatement: \nWe have already provided you with a detailed description of our need for \nthe requested discovery – it is all narrowly tailored to give us what we need \nso as to present to the Court the current jail conditions at the time of the \npreliminary injunction hearing in light of the changes the WCJ has made in \nresponse to our lawsuit. This is critically important so that the Court can take \nappropriate action to protect the class of vulnerable people under your \nclient’s custody who are at grave risk of exposure to COVID-19, as well as \nthose who are already exposed as a result of your client’s conduct. \n \nAs for your proposal to give us information subject to the conditions you \nseek  to  impose,  we  cannot  agree  to  those  conditions.  We  will  note \nDefendant’s opposition to our motion, although we disagree that we are \nrequired to include your lengthy email in the text of our motion or as an \nattachment to it. \n \nThe Sheriff’s counsel requested the prior conferral string be attached to give the Court an \naccurate portrayal of the conferral, which request went unheeded. \n10. A re-inspection of the WCJ, for multiple reasons, would be unduly burdensome \nand substantially disruptive to the Sheriff and to WCJ operations. [See generally Exh. C, \nDecl. of Capt. Matthew Turner, Jail Captain of Weld County Jail, at 2-5.] \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 34   Filed 04/20/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 11\n \nIII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n A court order allowing expedited discovery under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(d)(1) can issue \nbut only upon a showing of good cause, where the plaintiff’s need for expedited discovery \noutweighs any possible prejudice or hardship to the defendant. See Qwest Comm’s Int’l, \nInc. v. Worldquest Networks, Inc., 213 F.R.D. 418, 419 (D. Colo. 2003); Pod-Ners, \nLLC v. N. Feed & Bean of Lucerne LLC, 204 F.R.D. 675, 676 (D. Colo. 2002). Good \ncause exists where the evidence sought “may be consumed or destroyed with the \npassage of time, thereby disadvantaging one or more parties to the litigation.” Qwest, \n213 F.R.D. at 419. That is, entry of such an order is not appropriate where it is less likely \nrelevant evidence may be destroyed or lost. Cases where plaintiffs may require expedited \ndiscovery to meet their burden of proof to obtain a preliminary injunction are “expected to \nbe rare”. Notaro v. Koch, 95 F.R.D. 403, 405 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. 1982). In Pod-Ners, for \nexample, expedited discovery occurred because the plants at issue were capable of \nspoiling or being consumed or destroyed over time. Pod-Ners, 204 F.R.D. at 676. \nExpedited discovery may be appropriate in some cases where a party seeks a \npreliminary injunction. Pod-Ners, 204 F.R.D. at 676. However, such expedited discovery \nmust be limited and narrowly tailored to seek only information necessary to support \nexpedited relief. See Qwest, 213 F.R.D. at 420 (denying request for expedited discovery \nas overly broad). For example, the use of a broad term such as “relate to” or “concerning” \nin an expedited discovery request provides no basis upon which a party can reasonably \ndetermine what documents may or may not be responsive. Qwest, 213 F.R.D. at 421. \nWhen expedited discovery is sought to prepare for a preliminary injunction hearing, the \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 34   Filed 04/20/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 11\n \ndiscovery  requests  are  examined  in  the  context  of  the  whole  record  and  their \nreasonableness in light of all circumstances. See Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith \nv. O’Connor, 194 F.R.D. 618, 624 (N.D. Ill. 2000). \nAnd concerning an early-discovery request to inspect premises, the Sheriff as the \nresponding party must be permitted, in the context of this written Response filed with the \nCourt pursuant to ECF 33, to “state with specificity the grounds for objecting to the \nrequest, including the reasons.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(b)(2)(B). \nIV.  ARGUMENT \nA. The Sheriff’s Agreement to and Conditions on Furnishing Data Are Reasonable \n \nIn the parties’ conferral on ECF 31, the Sheriff indicated he would be agreeable to \nthe following narrowly tailored furnishing of daily data: \n(1) Providing Plaintiffs with a daily report, served on counsel-of-\nrecord only by 6:00 PM each day and current as of 5:00 PM on said day, \nfrom 04/11 through the day before the preliminary injunction hearing, of the \ntotal inmate count in the isolation unit (only one such unit at present, but if \nadditional units come into such use the data will be furnished); \n \n(2) Providing Plaintiffs with a daily report, served on counsel-of-\nrecord only by 6:00 PM each day and current as of 5:00 PM on said day, \nfrom 04/11 through the day before the preliminary injunction hearing, of the \ntotal inmate count of persons currently housed within the Weld County Jail \nwho at some point since March 1, 2020 were diagnosed by a healthcare \nprofessional as having tested positive for COVID-19; \n \n(3) Providing Plaintiffs with a daily report, served on counsel-of-\nrecord only by 6:00 PM each day and current as of 5:00 PM on said day, \nfrom 04/11 through the day before the preliminary injunction hearing, of the \ntotal inmate count of persons currently housed within the Weld County Jail \nwho at some point since March 1, 2020 were designated by a healthcare \nprofessional as being treated as “presumptively positive” for COVID-19 but \nwho have not in fact tested positive (or did not in fact test positive) for \nCOVID-19; and \n \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 34   Filed 04/20/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 11\n \n(4) As for all data from April 11, 2020 to April 17, 2020, counsel-of-\nrecord for Plaintiffs could expect to receive it no earlier than 5:30 PM on \nApril 17, 2020; from April 18, 2020 to April 19, 2020, counsel-of-record for \nPlaintiffs could expect to receive it no earlier than 5:30 PM on April 20, 2020; \nand from April 25, 2020 to April 26, 2020, counsel-of-record for Plaintiffs \ncould expect to receive it no earlier than 5:30 PM on April 27, 2020.2 \n \n[Exh. A at 1.] The Sheriff made this offer (and the offer concerning the furnishing of \npolicies)  subject  to  the following  limited  conditions:  request a briefing  schedule, for \nPlaintiffs to respond and Defendant to reply with no sur-reply permitted, on the legal \nissues identified in ECF 27; have the preliminary injunction hearing no earlier than \n04/29/2020; and a stipulation as to authenticity of all defense hearing exhibits, whether \ndocuments or video. [See Exh. A at 2.] Plaintiffs offered no response to the Sheriff’s \ncounsel, and no complaint in ECF 31, as to why this proposed scope of data and these \nconditions would be unreasonable.3 \nB. The Sheriff’s Agreement to and Limits on Furnishing Policies Are Reasonable \nIn the parties’ conferral on ECF 31, the Sheriff indicated he was agreeable to the \nfollowing narrowly tailored furnishing of COVID-19-related policies [see Exh. A at 1-2]: \n(1) The Sheriff would furnish written policies and procedures from the \nWCSO and Weld County Health Department (to the extent given to the \nWCSO and applicable to WCJ operations) relating to COVID-19, including \npolicies or procedures to protect inmates from COVID-19, whether they \nhave been disseminated to the inmates or otherwise. However, the Sheriff \nwas willing to do so only in the form and context of PI hearing exhibits under \n                                            \n2 The Sheriff does not concede good cause exists for provision of any of these \ndata points but he is willing to provide them nonetheless. \n \n3  The Sheriff continues to believe the legal issues before this Court are paramount, \nand warrant further briefing and consideration by this Court. The Sheriff maintains the \nlegal barriers articulated by the Sheriff foreclose this Court awarding the relief Plaintiffs \ndemand regardless of the facts presented at any evidentiary hearing before this Court. \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 34   Filed 04/20/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 11\n \nwhatever PI hearing exhibit exchange schedule the Court in its discretion \nmight set. \n \n(2)  The  Sheriff’s  made  this  offer  subject  to  the  same  limited \nconditions as for data. \n \nC. Any WCJ Re-Inspection Will Be Unreasonable, Burdensome, and Disruptive \nIn contrast, Plaintiffs’ proposed re-inspection of the whole WCJ is unnecessary and \ndisproportionate to its heavy and undue burden, expense, and substantial disruption. \nIn the context of correctional facility inspections, “the search for the truth must be \nbalanced against the burdens and dangers created by the inspection.” United States v. \nTerritory of the V.I., 280 F.R.D. 232, 236-37 (D.V.I. 2012) (denying motion for inspection \nof correctional facility); Silverstein v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n47646, at *4 (D. Colo. May 20, 2009) (same). Plaintiffs must offer a “heightened showing” \nof relevance and necessity. De Abadia-Peixoto v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 2013 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 98578, at *7 (N.D. Cal. July 12, 2013). \nA claim to re-inspection of the WCJ required Plaintiffs to present the Court with \nsupporting evidence. Not data in the nature of which the Sheriff has agreed to provide, \nbut  specific  evidence  from  their  expert’s  first  inspection  indicative  of  deliberate \nindifference by the Sheriff. Notably absent from Plaintiffs’ presentation is any expert report \nor other articulation of any specific deficiencies in the operations, policies, or procedures \nof the WCJ. It is not enough for Plaintiffs to assert disagreement; they must present \nevidence, have entirely failed to do so, and cannot later attempt to sandbag the Sheriff. \nMoreover,  Plaintiffs  identify  the  wrong  merits  issue  (the  effectiveness  of  the \nprocedures implemented since April 10, 2020, in reducing transmission). The actual issue \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 34   Filed 04/20/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 11\n \nis whether the Sheriff has taken reasonable steps, both inside and outside the WCJ, to \nprotect inmate health and safety. Plaintiffs haven’t articulated what specifically they \nweren’t able to inspect previously or what they anticipate finding in a re-inspection on any \nspecific issue other than generalized and unsubstantiated rhetoric. Even if more WCJ \ninmates have tested positive for COVID-19 (which is not occurring as of this filing), that \nproves nothing other than the WCJ is subject to the same spread as the entire world. \nIn contrast, the Sheriff now offers the Court evidence of  undue burdens and \nsubstantial disruptions implicated by an unwarranted re-inspection, namely: scant PPE to \nspare; hours of cleaning necessitated after inspection concludes; prospect of inmates \nslowly beginning to have incrementally increasing time outside of cells in appropriately \nsixed groups; additional operational and staff burdens due to how much commotion the \nprior inspection created and associated prospect of creation of understaffed areas to \naccommodate inspection group; and the Sheriff and WCSO have no idea how well \nPlaintiffs’ counsel or their expert are doing at social distancing, hand washing, etc., yet \nthe WCJ is taking and continuing to take many steps to reduce who comes in and isolate \nnew arrivals, so allowing more people in the WCJ is itself a public health risk and weighs \nagainst re-inspection, all of which Plaintiffs apparently haven’t considered. [See Exh. C.] \nPhysical inspections assuredly are more burdensome and intrusive than written \ndiscovery. Here, the issue is whether Plaintiffs must be allowed a re-inspection. But \nPlaintiffs present no specific evidentiary basis for a re-inspection.  See Silverstein, 2009 \nU.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  47646,  at  *6  (“allowing  another  site  visit  for  [plaintiff’s  expert]  is \nduplicative of discovery already allowed”). A re-inspection must be denied because \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 34   Filed 04/20/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 11\n \nPlaintiffs haven’t established how the re-inspection is anything but an “ammo recon” \nmission which, like a hornbook fishing expedition, is “rarely appropriate and uniformly \ndiscouraged.” I’Mnaedaft, Ltd. v. Intelligent Office Sys., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50717, \nat *18 (D. Colo. May 29, 2009).4 \nV.  CONCLUSION \nApplicable federal authority reveals the requisite “good cause” standard for early \ndiscovery is in fact quite high. Plaintiffs fail to satisfy this standard. Accordingly, Defendant \nSheriff Steven Reams respectfully requests the Court enter an Order: authorizing the \nSheriff to comply with Plaintiffs’ claimed entitlement to early discovery only as agreed \nherein; denying ECF 31 to the extent inconsistent with the Sheriff’s expressed agreement \nherein; and granting all other and further relief deemed just and appropriate. \nRespectfully submitted this 20th day of April, 2020. \ns/ Matthew J.

Mar. 17, 2010), does \nnot assist Plaintiffs, because in that case no inspection of the correctional facility occurred \nyet, whereas here a quite detailed inspection already occurred and Plaintiffs haven’t given \nthe Court the requisite good cause for a second inspection.

6\n \nWe’re getting close to complete agreement. The one remaining point of disagreement that we appear to have revolves \naround Plaintiffs’ expert being able to choose the pod they inspect shortly before entering the area. It is Plaintiffs’ \ninspection, so it appropriate for Plaintiffs’ expert to retain the ability to choose which pods to visit. In addition, there’s \nno sense in hiding the ball: A major concern of ours, should Plaintiffs’ expert not be able to independently decide where \nto visit (within the physical parameters we’ve agreed upon) after arriving at the jail, is that jail officials may transfer \npeople out of a pod or otherwise alter the jail’s typical/actual response to COVID before the experts gain entry to the \narea. Defendant’s expert does not have the same arm’s length relationship with the jail that Plaintiffs’ expert has (I don’t \nmean to impugn Dr. Smith’s character; I am simply saying that Dr. Smith was handpicked by the Defendant in the case, \nand the Defendant is being sued for conditions in the jail). \n \nThe main point of the inspection, from our perspective, is for an independent infectious disease expert, who has no \nconnection to the jail, to meaningfully evaluate how the jail is addressing COVID. Of course, this requires accurate data \nthat is representative of what is happening on the ground. Thus, all we are requesting at this point, beyond what you \nhave committed to doing, is a process that is designed to preserve the integrity of the investigation and, by extension, \nintegrity of the results. I trust that this is important to Defendant’s medical expert as well. \n \nPlease let us know your thoughts on this one remaining issue. Thank you. \n \nMichael Fairhurst \nKillmer, Lane & Newman, LLP \n1543 Champa St,  Suite 400 \nDenver, CO  80202 \n303‐571‐1000 Phone \n303‐571‐1001 Fax \nwww.kln‐law.com \nmfairhurst@kln‐law.com  \n \nFrom: Hegarty, Matthew J. <hegartym@hallevans.com>  \nSent: Thursday, April 9, 2020 4:38 PM \nTo: Michael Fairhurst <mfairhurst@kln‐law.com>; Mark Silverstein <msilverstein@aclu‐co.org>; David Maxted \n<dave@maxtedlaw.com>; Rebecca Wallace <rtwallace@aclu‐co.org>; Lauren E. Groth <groth@hbcboulder.com>; Sara \nNeel <sneel@aclu‐co.org>; Daniel D. Williams <williams@hbcboulder.com>; David Lane <dlane@kln‐law.com>; Jamie \nHubbard <hubbard@sslhlaw.com>; Andrew McNulty <amcnulty@kln‐law.com>; Charlotte Scull <cscull@kln‐law.com> \nCc: Ringel, Andrew D. <ringela@hallevans.com>; Peters, John F. \"Jack\" <petersj@hallevans.com> \nSubject: RE: Weld County Jail Litigation \n \nMichael: \n \nThanks again for your patience. Defendant’s responses to the inquiries you raise below are in blue and underlined bold \nand appear after each of your responses in unbolded red to the extent a response is necessitated. \n \nHappily, it looks like we are just about 100% agreed. I anticipate this email string will be PDFed and printed out up to and \nincluding your “I think this covers everything” line in your email of 3:26 PM MDT today such that there is an absence of \nambiguity as to the parameters of the WCJ inspection protocol. Please reply back as soon as time allows and let us know \nif you agree with the points in this paragraph. Thanks! \n \nMatthew \n \n \nMatthew J. Hegarty | Member \nhegartym@hallevans.com \nEXHIBIT

B\n4\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 34-2   Filed 04/20/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 6\nFranco‐Paredes, another infectious disease specialist, is available. His CV is attached. (2) Daniel Williams, counsel for \nPlaintiffs, plans to accompany Dr. Franco‐Paredes, Dr. Smith, and a representative of the County Attorney’s office for the \nentire inspection tomorrow. \n \n(1) Dr. Krsak shall be accompanied, at all times and during the entirety of all conversations and interviews, by both \n(a) Defendant’s independent medical expert, Valerie Smith, PhD, MPH, Weld County Communicable Disease \nProgram Supervisor; and (b) a representative of the Weld County Attorney’s Office. That is fine. \na.  Each of these three individuals will have access to the same information through their eyes and ears. \nThat is the only way to ensure true independence. That is fine. \nb.  Each of these three individuals will be allowed a pen and notepad but will not be permitted any device \ncapable of making an audio recording or video recording, for security purposes. That is fine. \n(2) Each of these three individuals shall bring their own PPE, as much as they feel appropriate, so that the PPE \nsupplies at the Weld County Jail are not diminished by reason of this inspection. That is fine, with a small caveat: \nDr. Franco‐Paredes and Mr. Williams would like the ability to bring their own hand sanitizer with them during \nthe inspection. \na.  Defendant agrees to allow Dr. Franco‐Paredes and Mr. Williams to bring their own hand sanitizer so \nlong as it is secured on their person at all times and is for their personal use only. \n(3) Dr. Krsak’s conversations or interviews with current Weld County inmates—whether they be Inmate Plaintiffs, \npretrial detainees, inmates who must carry out their sentences at the Weld County Jail, or otherwise—will not \nbe confidential at all, and both Dr. Smith and the WCAO representative will be allowed to listen to all aspects of \nall such conversations or interviews. As you know, there is no federal physician‐patient privilege in federal court \nwhere (as here) purely federal claims have been advanced, nor would Dr. Krsak as an expert retained by Inmate \nPlaintiffs have any physician‐patient privilege with any such inmate under Colorado state law in any event. Thus, \nthere is no privacy interest which your clients or any other inmate can assert in any such conversation or \ninterview. This is fine, mostly. However, to ensure we are clear: It is important that inmates have the ability to \nconverse freely with the experts. Inmates should not be removed from the common areas, cells, etc. before the \nexperts arrive. If an expert wishes to ask an inmate who they randomly encounter questions, they should be \nable to do so without restriction. Some information is private in nature, like personal health information, and is \nprobably best discussed in the setting you described in the section that immediately follows. Other information, \nlike sleeping and eating arrangements, is not inherently private and can be discussed in an open and public \nsetting. \na.  As an accommodation to whomever of the current WCJ inmates or detainees wish to discuss their \nhealth information with these three individuals, the WCJ will provide a sanitized meeting room into \nwhich such inmates can be admitted one at a time along with these three individuals to ensure their \nhealth information is kept private from the rest of the jail during the discussions. Obviously, Defendant \nhas no ability to control what the inmates do or do not discuss with each other outside the confines of \nthis sanitized meeting room, but this seems the most reasonable approach under the circumstances. \nFine. \nb.  Defendant agrees to the following: inmates and detainees will not be moved from common areas \nbefore the experts arrive unless they were already in transit or already on their permitted break from \nthe current lockdown situation; the experts can freely ask questions of inmates and detainees apart \nfrom questions about personal health information (such as information about sleeping and eating \narrangements) so long as the questions are audible to all inspection attendees and posed in English \nwith responses requested in English; and if the inmates or detainees want to answer questions about \npersonal health information or provide information about personal health information voluntarily, \nthey will then be transitioned to the sanitized meeting room where they can speak with the experts \nabout such questions. \n(4) These three individuals, during the entirety of the inspection and to ensure their own safety and security, shall \nbe accompanied by a ranking officer of the WCSO Detentions Division. Fine. \na.  As an accommodation to your clients (to the extent they wish to be interviewed) and to whomever of \nthe other inmates or detainees wishes to be interviewed within the sanitized meeting room indicated \nabove, which shall have a window allowing those outside to look in and observe even while the door is \nEXHIBIT B\n5\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 34-2   Filed 04/20/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 6\nclosed, the lieutenant shall cuff or otherwise reasonably restrain the interviewee, the lieutenant shall \nexit the room and allow the three inspecting individuals to enter, and the lieutenant shall close the door, \nbut at all times the lieutenant shall be looking through the window to monitor the interview for the \nsafety and security of the inspectors.  Fine. \n(5) Dr. Krsak, Dr. Smith, and the WCAO rep—jointly and concurrently—shall be allowed to inspect the following \nareas of the Weld County Jail: intake/booking; inmate living areas (must inspect at least 2); medical observation \nunit (“MedObs”); all quarantine and med isolation units outside of MedObs; food prep area; inmate common \nareas (must inspect at least 2). Much of this is okay, but we do have a few caveats and questions. First, the \nexpert should have the ability to randomly choose which pods they’ll be visiting upon arrival, and should have \nthe ability to choose any of them. Second, do common areas include toilets, showers, phones, and water \nfountains? Third, what is the medical observation unit? Is there another medical area that you did not mention, \nlike an infirmary? \na.  Defendant agrees to the following: Inmate Plaintiffs’ expert will be able to randomly select pods for \ninspection (being sure that at least two pods are inspected), but if Defendant’s expert believes Inmate \nPlaintiffs’ expert to be cherry‐picking, Defendant’s expert retains the right to require the inspection of \npods include a third or fourth pod, to which Inmate Plaintiffs’ expert agrees in advance; the experts \nwill be able to inspect toilets, showers, phones, and water fountains; and the WCJ does have an actual \nmedical ward which is separate from the Medical Observation Unit which the inspecting group is free \nto tour together, but all members of the inspecting group should be aware this medical ward is limited \nin size so the WCSO did not utilize it long term for COVID‐19 issues. \n(6) Dr. Krsak, Dr. Smith, and the WCAO rep—jointly and concurrently—shall be allowed to shadow and speak with \ntwo medical staff of their joint agreement. Fine. \n(7) Dr. Krsak, Dr. Smith, and the WCAO rep—jointly and concurrently—shall be allowed to shadow and speak with \ntwo Detentions Division personnel of their joint agreement. Fine. \n(8) No time limit is set for the inspection, although Defendant would respectfully request it be conducted as \nexpeditiously as possible to minimize disruption of Jail operations. Fine. \n(9) The Sheriff, in his sole discretion, retains the ability to suspend the inspection, to alter the order of the \ninspection tour, or to rule certain areas off limits for inspection, but only where necessary to address any \nemergent security or safety issues within the Weld County Jail and where necessary to ensure the safety of \nthese three individuals who will be jointly and concurrently inspecting the Jail. Fine. \na.  Defendant is quite hopeful that due to the Jail currently being on lockdown, no such emergent security \nor safety issues will arise, but of course it is impossible to predict what inmates will do. \nb.  The Sheriff, upon reflection, has determined the size of the inspecting group necessitates the addition \nof a second WCSO Detentions Division officer for safety and security purposes. This should not pose \nan issue, and this second officer will abide by all protocols as the ranking officer will abide insofar as it \nconcerns the sanitized meeting room and the officer’s need to vacate the room before the interview \nstarts. \n \nI think this covers everything. Please let us know your response to the points above. Thank you. \n \nSincerely, \nMichael Fairhurst \nKillmer, Lane & Newman, LLP \n1543 Champa St,  Suite 400 \nDenver, CO  80202 \n303‐571‐1000 Phone \n303‐571‐1001 Fax \nwww.kln‐law.com \nmfairhurst@kln‐law.com  \nEXHIBIT B\n6\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 34-3   Filed 04/20/20   USDC Colorado   Page 1 of 6\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO \n \nCivil Action No. 1:20-cv-00977-PAB \n \nTHOMAS CARRANZA; \nJESUS MARTINEZ; \nRICHARD BARNUM; \nTHOMAS LEWIS; \nMICHAEL WARD; \nCOLBY PROPES; and \nCHAD HUNTER, \n \n  Plaintiffs, on their own and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons, \n \nv. \n \nSTEVEN REAMS, Sheriff of Weld County, Colorado, in his official capacity, \n \nDefendant. \n                           \n \nDECLARATION OF CAPTAIN MATTHEW TURNER \n                           \n \nI, Captain Matthew Turner, being of lawful age and duly sworn under penalty of \nperjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, hereby declare as follows: \n1.  I have personal knowledge of the matters set forth in this Declaration. \n2.  I currently serve as the Jail Captain for the Weld County Jail (“WCJ”) County of \nWeld, State of Colorado. I have served in this position for four months. \n3.  Before beginning my tenure as the WCSO Jail Captain on January 1, 2020, I \nwas employed with the Weld County Sheriff’s Office (“WCSO”) for eight (8) prior years \nand served in many positions: Corrections Officer (what is now called Detentions Deputy) \nand separately earned by Peace Officer Standards Training (“POST”) certification; Public \nInformation Officer Corporal; Detentions Division Shift Sergeant; Civil Unit Sergeant in \nEXHIBIT C\n1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 34-3   Filed 04/20/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 6\ncharge of civil service processors, animal control, and victim advocates; and Detentions \nDivision Lieutenant. \n4.  I also earned an Associate of Arts in education from Front Range Community \nCollege in 2011 with a future goal to attain a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice from \nthe University of Northern Colorado. \n5.  I am individually familiar with the protocols and processes the WCSO as a \nwhole generated, implemented, and refined in response to the global, national, and local \npublic  health  threat  posed  by  the  novel  coronavirus  (“COVID-19”),  because  I  was \npersonally involved in generating, implementing, refining, and approving such protocols \nand processes in consultation with a team of WCSO staff and local public health officials. \nUNDULY BURDENSOME NATURE OF SECOND INSPECTION OF WCJ \n6.  When COVID-19 first began emerging as a potential concern for Weld County \ngenerally and the WCJ specifically, yet well before any outbreak of COVID-19 in Weld \nCounty proper or before the current minor outbreak within the WCJ, the WCSO worked \nwith all Weld County local law enforcement entities and the 19th Judicial District judicial \nofficers to try and limit the foot traffic within the WCJ, as much as reasonably practicable \nand within the bounds of statutorily required arrests and detentions. \n7.  Since March 13, 2020, the WCSO has permitted only essential tasks to occur \nwithin the WCJ—official law enforcement business and criminal justice business which is \nabsolutely necessary to keep the wheels of criminal justice turning—encompassing of \nthose tasks which if not accomplished potentially could violate the scope of constitutional \ncriminal  rights  under  the  United  States  and  Colorado  Constitutions,  specifically  in \nconnection with a pretrial detainee’s criminal trial. \nEXHIBIT C\n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 34-3   Filed 04/20/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 6\n8.  The WCSO’s definition of “essential tasks” as articulated in the immediately \npreceding paragraph is even more restrictive than the definition of “critical business” in \nthe late March 2020 Order of Governor Jared Polis and associated Amended Public \nHealth Order of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. \n9.  Since March 16, 2020, the WCSO also reduced deputy traffic and movement \nthroughout the WCJ in an effort to diminish even the prospect of transmission of any \ncommunicable disease from one region of the WCJ’s physical plant to another. \n10. Since April 4, 2020, in the limited circumstances in which WCSO personnel \nhave to move between units, all such persons must follow decontamination protocols at \ndecontamination stations which are situated throughout the WCJ. \n11. After the April 10, 2020, inspection, WCJ inmates and staff participated in the \ncleaning and sanitizing of each part of the WCJ the inspection group entered and exited. \n12. Allowing a second inspection of the WCJ would be unduly burdensome to the \nWCSO given the substantial additional effort, cleaning and sanitizing, and staffing both \nbefore and after such an inspection, which such an inspection would necessitate. \n13. Allowing a second inspection of the WCJ would be unduly burdensome given \nthe fact it would take even further valuable personal protective equipment (“PPE”) and \nsanitization supplies away from WCJ inmates and WCSO staff. \n14. Allowing a second inspection of the WCJ would be unduly burdensome given \nthe fact multiple WCSO personnel will need to be pulled from responsibilities elsewhere \nin the WCJ to supervise the inspection and provide safety and security to the inspection \ngroup, which (for reasons articulated) will  necessitate even more WCSO personnel \nparticipating in the supervision, safety, and security of the inspection group. \nEXHIBIT C\n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 34-3   Filed 04/20/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 6\nSUBSTANTIALLY DISRUPTIVE NATURE OF SECOND INSPECTION OF WCJ \n15. In connection with the April 10, 2020, inspection of the WCJ and during its \nprogress, WCJ inmates and detainees were extremely curious as to what was going on \nvis-à-vis the inspection. Such inmates exited their cells in violation of the lockdown \nprotocol, violated social distancing guidelines which WCSO personnel repeatedly have \ntold them to observe, and did not listen to the pod deputies who issued contemporaneous \ndirectives to get back in their cells and observe social distancing. \n16. In particular, multiple inmates within one unit which the inspection group \nentered reportedly screamed and yelled at the inspection group their entire time there. \n17. During the April 10, 2020, inspection, the WCSO could only spare two (2) \nWCSO staff members to devote to the inspection, and even that was not enough because \nof the significant disruptions the inspection caused, a mere example of which is above. \n18. To even more carefully ensure the inmates adhere to such guidelines and \ndirectives, another inspection of the WCJ would necessitate a significant uptick in WCSO \nstaff being pulled away from their existing duties within the WCJ (particularly given the \ndecrease in foot traffic), which will further disrupt WCJ operations. \n19. Such inspections of the WCJ simply are not a normal task for the WCSO and \nits staff, necessitating multiple modifications to the WCJ in an effort to accommodate the \ninspection group while still attempting to ensure inmate health and safety. \n20. In addition, WCJ inmates who either previously tested positive for COVID-19 \nas determined by a medical professional, or were designated by a medical professional \nas being “presumptively positive” for COVID-19, all of whom have been in isolation, may \nbegin emerging from isolation protocols after navigating a further protocol for testing \nEXHIBIT C\n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 34-3   Filed 04/20/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 6\nnegative for COVID-19. This will mean inmates will be out of their cells but still in small \ngroups and still being directed to observe social distancing guidelines. \n21. Allowing a second inspection of the WCJ would be substantially disruptive also \ngiven the prospect of WCJ inmates slowly being allowed such limited increases in \nfreedom of movement, in groups of no more than nine (9) inmates, and potentially coming \ninto contact with additional persons from outside the WCJ who may or may not be \nobserving personal sanitation regimens and social distancing protocols themselves. \n22. The WCSO desires to be extremely sensitive to the number of COVID-19 \ntesting kits it has on hand and is continuing its already existing efforts to obtain more tests \n23. In addition, as a result of continued decline in inmate population, the WCSO \nis beginning to be able to single-cell more and more inmates within the confines of the \nWCJ when able given physical plant limitations. \n24. Allowing a second inspection of the WCJ would be substantially disruptive also \ngiven it is itself a public health risk due to the substantial steps which the WCSO has \ntaken to limit inmate exposure to COVID-19 and the lack of assurance the WCJ has that \nany outside visitor, regardless of affiliation, is observing personal sanitation regimens and \nsocial distancing protocols themselves. \n25. The last thing the WCSO wants to do is introduce an unknown element into \nthe WCJ which could completely undermine the effective steps the WCSO has taken to \nplan for, slow, stop, and further guard against the spread of COVID-19. \nI understand the statements written in this Declaration are given under penalty of perjury. \nAll of the foregoing statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

As \nset forth below, Plaintiffs have good cause for targeted discovery in support of the preliminary \ninjunction. See Advantage Sales & Mktg. LLC v. Gold, No. 18-CV-00312-RM, 2018 WL \n6252781, at *1 (D. Colo. Feb. 13, 2018) (granting narrowly tailored expedited discovery in \nsupport of preliminary injunction).  \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs seek an order requiring Defendant to produce or make available \nfor inspection the following narrowly tailored discovery in advance of the preliminary injunction \nhearing: \n1.

A daily report, from Saturday, April 11 through the date of the preliminary \ninjunction hearing, of the total count of individuals in any and all isolation and \nquarantine units in the jail; \n \n3.  A daily report, from Saturday, April 11 through the date of the preliminary \ninjunction hearing, of the total count of individuals at the jail who have tested \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 31   Filed 04/17/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 11\npositive for COVID-19, or who are being treated as presumptively positive \nbased on their symptoms; and \n \n4.  Copies of all policies and procedures issued by Defendant concerning COVID-\n19, including any policies or procedures to protect individuals in the jail from \nCOVID-19, with supplements to Plaintiffs as those policies are updated through \nthe date of the preliminary injunction hearing. \n \nCERTIFICATE OF CONFERRAL \n  Defendant objects to the relief requested. Defendant has indicated he would provide some \nbut not all of the requested discovery in exchange for a set of demands including demands \nunrelated to discovery and to which Plaintiffs would not agree. The parties conferred via email. \nCounsel for plaintiffs has requested multiple times to have a telephone call to confer about this \nand other issues, but counsel for Defendant refuses to engage in telephonic conferral. \nBACKGROUND \n1.  On April 7, 2020, Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, \nPreliminary Injunction, and Expedited Hearing, see Doc. 1, and Complaint for Injunctive and \nDeclaratory Relief, see Doc. 7. This is a putative class action. Plaintiffs have alleged, with \nsubstantial basis, a grave and urgent threat to the health and safety of vulnerable people detained \nin Weld County jail (“jail”) relating to an outbreak of COVID-19 in the facility, and the failure \nof Defendant Reams to reasonably protect those under his care. Plaintiffs are representative of \nthe class of persons highly vulnerable to serious illness or death from the virus, including those \nover 55 years of age, and people with pre-existing health conditions.  \n2.  On April 8, 2020, Plaintiffs’ counsel conferred with defense counsel to request \nthat Plaintiffs’ medical expert be permitted to inspect the jail. The parties conferred and reached \nan agreement that complied with Defendant’s security concerns and would not disrupt the jail’s \noperations. The inspection took place on April 10, 2020, and was conducted by University of \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 31   Filed 04/17/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 11\nColorado Associate Professor of Medicine Carlos Franco-Paredes, MD, MPH. Representatives \nof the County participated, as well as a member of Plaintiffs’ legal team. \n3.  Defendant submitted his Response to Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, \nPreliminary Injunction, and Expedited Hearing on April 13. Doc. 26. Defendant Reams claims, \nin short, to have appropriately responded to the COVID-19 epidemic. Needless to say, the parties \nvigorously dispute the facts.  \n4.  Plaintiffs have continued to investigate this matter and anticipate presenting \nevidence that, rather than ensure constitutional treatment of Plaintiffs and those under his care, \nDefendant Reams deliberately failed to take the COVID-19 crisis seriously, he cavalierly ignored \npublic health protocols, and he scoffed at guidance from Governor Polis and the experts. By the \ntime he did begin to take precautions, it was too late—an outbreak in his jail festered and spread, \nendangering Plaintiffs and the putative class. \n5.  Tragically, Plaintiffs have learned that a vulnerable detainee in Weld County jail, \nCharles Peterson, contracted the COVID-19 virus in the jail and died shortly after his early \nrelease from the jail. See Doc. 28. As of April 10, 2020, at least 14 inmates have been either \nconfirmed or presumed positive for COVID-19.  \n6.  Plaintiffs and their counsel acknowledge recent attempts by Defendant to improve \nhis failed response to the COVID-19 crisis. As a result, Plaintiffs voluntarily moved to withdraw \nthe motion for a temporary restraining order, Doc. 29, which the Court granted, Doc. 30. In its \nminute order, the Court noted the parties’ substantial progress toward resolving the dispute, and \nset the matter for a preliminary injunction hearing via video teleconference the week of April 27, \n2020. Doc. 30.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 31   Filed 04/17/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 11\n7.  Although the parties have made progress, significant factual disputes remain to be \nresolved at the hearing. Plaintiffs dispute that Defendant Reams implemented adequate \nprecautions consistent with the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs and the putative class they \nrepresent. Indeed, Plaintiffs have identified multiple individuals—named Plaintiffs and other \nwitnesses—who contradict the Defendant’s claims. See, e.g., Docs. 1-1 (Exhibits 1-4); Docs. 28-\n1 (Exhibits 1-8).  \n8.  Moreover, Defendant Reams’ dismal track record in responding to COVID-19, \nand his cavalier and dismissive statements regarding the deadly virus, place his credibility \nsquarely at issue in this litigation. Plaintiffs cannot take Defendant Reams’ declaration at face \nvalue and are entitled to seek limited discovery.  \n9.  The discovery sought is narrowly tailored to support the relief requested. First, \nPlaintiffs seek to re-inspect the jail to observe current conditions, to obtain evidence of any \nchanges since April 10, and to investigate whether the claims of Defendant Reams in his \ndeclaration are accurate.  \n10.  Second, Plaintiffs seek updated evidence of the number of individuals held in \nisolation or quarantine on a daily basis. This evidence is relevant to whether the measures in \nplace at the time of the April 10 inspection are succeeding in protecting the Plaintiffs and the \nputative class and in containing the spread of the virus within the jail.   \n11.  Third, Plaintiffs seek updated evidence of the number of people confirmed \npositive for COVID-19, or presumptively positive due to symptoms. Again, this information is \nhighly relevant to whether Defendant is adequately containing the outbreak of COVID-19 in the \njail, of critical importance to the safety of Plaintiffs and the class.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 31   Filed 04/17/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 11\n12.  Fourth, Plaintiffs seek relevant policies and procedures regarding Defendant’s \nresponse to the COVID-19 crisis. This information is of critical importance to the preliminary \nrelief requested because it will show Defendants action and inaction in response to the pandemic, \nthe timing of the issuance of these policies, and whether the policies are adequate to protect \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional rights.  \n13.  After repeatedly—and publicly—dismissing the dangers of COVID-19 and \nallowing the virus to run rampant in his facility, resulting in the death of at least one man and \nwidespread contagion, Defendant Reams now claims to be taking adequate precautions. That \nremains to be seen. Plaintiffs seek targeted, limited discovery to ascertain whether the \nconstitutional rights of Plaintiffs and the class are being protected. The Court should grant the \nmotion.  \nARGUMENT \n“Expedited discovery is permitted on a showing of good cause provided that the \ndiscovery is ‘narrowly tailored to seek information necessary to support expedited or preliminary \nrelief.’” Advantage Sales & Mktg. LLC v. Gold, No. 18-CV-00312-RM, 2018 WL 6252781, at \n*1 (D. Colo. Feb. 13, 2018) (internal cite omitted); see also Qwest Commc'ns Int'l, Inc. v. \nWorldQuest Networks, Inc., 213 F.R.D. 418, 419 (D. Colo. 2003) (noting “good cause standard \nmay be satisfied where a party seeks a preliminary injunction”). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n26(d)(1) permits early discovery when authorized “by court order,” and district courts issue such \norders when justified by “good cause.” Pod-Ners, LLC v. N. Feed & Bean of Lucerne Liab. Co., \n204 F.R.D. 675, 676 (D. Colo. 2002) (“Rule 26(d), Fed. R. Civ. P., allows me to order expedited \ndiscovery upon a showing of good cause.”).  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 31   Filed 04/17/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 11\nObtaining relevant evidence in possession of the Defendant for presentation at a hearing \non preliminary relief constitutes “good cause.” Advantage, 2018 WL 6252781 at *1. This \nconclusion is supported by Commentary to Rule 26(d), which states that discovery can begin \nearly, and that “[t]his will be appropriate in some cases, such as those involving requests for a \npreliminary injunction …..” See also Advantage, 2018 WL 6252781 at *1 (relying on \nCommentary). As reasoned by the Court in Advantage, when granting limited expedited \ndiscovery in this scenario, “[i]n order for all parties to be properly prepared for that [preliminary \ninjunction] hearing, in terms of the submission of evidence, some form of limited discovery will \nneed to take place beforehand.” Id.  \nCourts in other jurisdictions similarly conclude that early discovery is appropriate for \npresentation at a preliminary injunction hearing. See, e.g., Midwest Sign & Screen Printing \nSupply Co. v. Dalpe, 386 F. Supp. 3d 1037, 1057 (D. Minn. 2019) (\"The purpose of expedited \ndiscovery in the context of a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction is for further \ndevelopment of the record before the preliminary injunction hearing, which better enables the \ncourt to judge the parties' interests and respective chances for success on the merits.\"); Irish \nLesbian & Gay Org. v. Giuliani, 918 F. Supp. 728, 731 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (good cause to grant \ndiscovery related \"to the specific issues that will have to be determined at the preliminary \ninjunction hearing.\").  \nHere, the Court should grant Plaintiffs’ motion. Plaintiffs have made a small number of \nnarrowly tailored requests which are not unduly burdensome nor impracticable, and which seek \nrelevant evidence. Request (1), an inspection of the jail, is authorized by Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 34(a)(2), and an expert inspection of the facility close in time to the hearing will assist \nthe Court’s analysis. See, e.g., United States v. Erie Cty., NY, No. 09-CV-849S, 2010 WL \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 31   Filed 04/17/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 11\n986505, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 17, 2010) (unreported) (granting expedited motion to inspect \njail).  The parties have already agreed to security protocols for the inspection which were used on \nApril 10, and those same protocols should be used for the reinspection. \nFor instance, after inspection the expert may be able to opine as to whether Defendant \nReams’ attempted response to the COVID-19 outbreak is adequate, whether and which parts of \nthe facility still pose unacceptable risks to Plaintiffs, and whether additional precautions and \nactions must be taken by the Defendant, as well as myriad other relevant evidence. Although an \ninspection occurred by agreement on April 10, it is critical that Plaintiffs have the opportunity to \npresent evidence regarding the state of the facility as it is as of the time of the preliminary \ninjunction hearing, and to investigate whether the belated precautions implemented by Defendant \nReams as of April 10 have been kept in place, and whether they are succeeding in containing the \nspread of the virus. \nPlaintiffs’ other requests seek discovery relevant to whether they face irreparable harm in \nthe form of infection and possible death from COVID-19, and whether Defendant Reams’ \nactions are adequately protecting them. See, e.g., Jones’El v. Berge, 164 F. Supp. 2d 1096 (W.D. \nWisc. 2001) (“[P]ain, suffering and the risk of death constitute ‘irreparable harm’ sufficient to \nsupport a preliminary injunction in prison cases.”). Specifically, Requests (2) and (3) regard \nwhether the jail is adequately isolating individuals, and whether the COVID-19 outbreak in the \nfacility is worsening or not over time, all of which is highly relevant to the question of whether \nPlaintiffs are being adequately protected or not, and whether the outbreak in the facility is \nworsening.  \nFinally, Request (4), for Defendant’s policies and procedures regarding COVID-19, is \nnarrowly tailored to the relief sought, and highly relevant. Whether Defendant has implemented \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 31   Filed 04/17/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 11\nadequate policies and procedures in response to the COVID-19 crisis is obviously relevant to \nwhether Plaintiffs’ face irreparable harm. It is Defendant’s duty to take “reasonable measures to \nguarantee the safety” of Plaintiffs and the class, Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 833 (1994), \nand any policies and procedure regarding COVID-19 will reveal what measures he has in fact \ntaken, and whether he is complying with his own written policies. See, e.g., Hernandez v. Cty. of \nMonterey, 110 F. Supp. 3d 929, 943 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (policies and procedures fell below the \nstandard of care). \nThe Court should grant the motion because Plaintiffs seek “narrowly tailored” discovery \nto support their requested preliminary relief. Advantage, 2018 WL 6252781 at *1. Therefore, \n“good cause” is shown and the Court should issue an order pursuant to Rule 26(d)(1). \nCONCLUSION \n  Plaintiffs have demonstrated good cause for limited immediate discovery in support of \nthe preliminary relief requested. The Court should grant the motion and order Defendant Steve \nReams to produce the following discovery: \n1.  An inspection of the Weld County jail by an independent medical expert on \nFriday, April 24, 2020, using the same protocols as those used for the April 10, \n2020 inspection; \n \n2.  A daily report, from Saturday, April 11 through the date of the preliminary \ninjunction hearing, of the total count of individuals in any and all isolation and \nquarantine units in the jail; \n \n3.  A daily report, from Saturday, April 11 through the date of the preliminary \ninjunction hearing, of the total count of individuals at the jail who have tested \npositive for COVID-19, or who are being treated as presumptively positive \nbased on their symptoms; and \n \n4.  Copies of all policies and procedures issued by Defendant concerning COVID-\n19, including any policies or procedures to protect individuals in the jail from \nCOVID-19, with supplements to Plaintiffs as those policies are updated through \nthe date of the preliminary injunction hearing. \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 31   Filed 04/17/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 11\nDated: April 17, 2020       \n          Respectfully submitted, \n \ns/ Andy McNulty       \nAndy McNulty  \nMichael P.

In \naddition to washing our hands, reducing the amount of contact with others seems to be the most effective \nmethod in slowing the spread of this virus. With this understanding, steps will immediately be taken to \nimplement the following measures: \n  Counselors will be assigned specific units to complete Post SUW Contacts. As soon as possible, \nplease deliver all of the files for Post SUW Contact Follow-ups to our office. These will be separated per \nunit and assigned to a specific counselor on a non-designated day. The expectation will be that the \nassigned counselor will complete the welfare checks on the date they are assigned.  \n  As appropriate, Individual Counseling will be suspended. If you believe that such an action isn’t prudent \nat this time staff your concerns with your Clinical Supervisor who will assist you with developing a plan \nto meet the Inmate’s needs. Otherwise send the attached Inmate Request Form to inmates currently \nreceiving counseling services informing them that such services have been suspended and directing \nthem to submit an Inmate Request Form to Inmate Services if they were to present with an urgent \nneed.  \n  To meet basic counseling needs Counselors will provide Inmates with self-help materials via the \nexisting internal inmate mail system. Utilizing this internal mail system, Inmates may submit completed \nassignments to their Counselor who then can offer insight and provide feedback.  \n  The practice of assigning new Inmate Request Forms to counselors will continue. However, the \nassigned counselor will initially respond via the Inmate Request Form. The Inmate will be provided with \nself-help materials, encouraged to complete the exercises, and practice the skills; they will be directed \n1\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 43-1   Filed 04/24/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 2\nto submit an Inmate Request Form if the symptoms persist at which time the assigned counselor will \ncomplete a face-to-face assessment. \nEXHIBIT A-23\n  When a medication review is warranted, the Inmate will be provided with a self-report questionnaire that \nthey will be expected to complete and return (see attachment). Recognizing that face-to-face \nencounters will need to occur to obtain ROI, clarify self-reported information, etc, it is expected that the \nself-report questionnaire will significantly reduce the number of face-to-face encounters.  \n  When possible, please utilize Professional Visitor Rooms. \n  Counselors to evaluate all Special Need Inmates and determine if they are appropriate for a \n“maintenance case plan”.  \n  Unit S will be assigned to a single counselor. (caseload weight will be considered)  \n  Routine Welfare Checks will be assigned daily to a specific non-designated counselor.  \n  Groups are suspended. \nThis is our first draft and best effort to address this very dynamic situation. Your patience is appreciated as is \nyour feedback. If you have ideas on how we can modify our practices to better meet the needs of Inmates, \nplease share. As Brene’ reminds us, “clear is kind”. \nLea and Brandon \n2",

The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1331.\nI.    BACKGROUND\nA.     Procedural History\nOn April 7, 2020, plaintiffs initiated this lawsuit.  Docket No. 1.  Plaintiffs are\nseven individuals who, at the time the lawsuit was filed, were held in the Weld County\nJail in Weld County, Colorado, either as a pretrial detainee (Thomas Carranza, Michael\nWard, Jesus Martinez, Richard Barnum, and Thomas Lewis), post-conviction and\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 39\nawaiting sentencing (Colby Propes), or serving a carceral sentence (Chad Hunter). \nSee Docket No. 7 at 7-10, ¶¶ 17-24.  Plaintiffs bring two claims for unconstitutional\nconditions of confinement pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, one under the Eighth\nAmendment and one under the Fourteenth Amendment, against Steven Reams in his\nofficial capacity as the Weld County Sheriff.  See id. at 25-27, ¶¶ 68-74.  Both claims\nare brought as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, defined as the following\nclass of individuals:\nAll current and future persons held at the Weld County Jail who are at\nhigh risk of complications from COVID-19 because:\n(a) they are age 55 or older; or\n(b) they have the following chronic health conditions: cancer; autoimmune\ndisease (including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Sjogren’s,\nCrohn’s); chronic lung disease (including asthma, chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or other\nchronic conditions associated with impaired lung function); history of\ncardiovascular disease; chronic arthritis; chronic liver or kidney disease;\ndiabetes; hypertension; heart failure; HIV; on chronic steroids or other\nimmunosuppressant medications for chronic conditions;\n(c) they have history of smoking or other substance abuse disorders; or\n(d) they are pregnant.\nDocket No. 7 at 24-25, ¶ 65.  Plaintiffs also filed a motion for class certification.  Docket\nNo. 2.  \nOn April 7, 2020, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order,\npreliminary injunction, and expedited hearing.  Docket No. 1.  Plaintiffs ask that the\nCourt order defendant to “implement a plan that will . . . ensure that [p]laintiffs are\nprotected from the threat of COVID-19 exposure by compliance with public health\n2\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 39\nguidelines.”  Id. at 5-7.1  Defendant filed a response on April 13, 2020.  Docket No. 26. \nThe next day, plaintiffs withdrew the portion of their motion seeking a temporary\nrestraining order and asked to proceed to a hearing on the portion of their motion\nseeking a preliminary motion.  Docket No. 29.  Defendant filed a supplemental reply on\nApril 24, 2020, Docket No. 41, and plaintiffs filed a reply on April 28, 2020.  Docket No.\n49.  The Court also permitted limited expedited discovery.  Docket No. 36.\nOn April 30, 2020, the Court conducted a hearing on plaintiffs’ preliminary\ninjunction motion.  Docket No. 52.  The hearing was conducted remotely using video\nteleconference, with two witnesses without access to video teleconference links\ntestifying by telephone.  See Docket No. 39 at 2 (finding that, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 43(a), good cause and compelling circumstances existed for remote testimony).  The\nCourt heard testimony from Kevin Monteiro, plaintiff Richard Barnum, Dr. Carlos\nFranco-Paredes, and defendant Steven Reams.2\n1 Plaintiffs’ motion included an alternative request that the Court “order the\ntransfer of a sufficient number of inmates to electronic home monitoring to allow for\nappropriate physical distancing within the Weld County Jail.”  Docket No. 1 at 7.  At the\nhearing, plaintiffs’ counsel stated plaintiffs were no longer seeking such relief.  See\nalso Docket No. 49-2 (plaintiffs’ revised request for relief, which makes no mention of\ntransfer or release).  Accordingly, the Court deems this request withdrawn for purposes\nof this motion.\n2 The parties also submitted a volume of exhibits to the Court more typical of a\nfour-day jury trial than a preliminary injunction hearing.  As the Court indicated to the\nparties at the start of the hearing, in making these findings of fact the Court gives little\nweight to exhibits that, while introduced, were not discussed.\n3\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 39\nB.    Findings of Fact\n1.    The Weld County Jail\nThe Weld County Jail (the “Jail”) is located in Weld County, Colorado.  As the\nelected Sheriff of Weld County, defendant oversees and operates the Jail.  Defendant\nis the final decision maker and policy maker for both the Weld County Sheriff’s Office\nand the Jail.  \nThe Jail has a capacity of 1,170 inmates.  Docket No. 26-1 at 25, ¶ 112.  The\nJail is generally organized into “pods,” which are groups of cells surrounding common\nareas.  See Def’s Exh. A-91.  Pods have a variety of configurations.  Some pods have\ncells that are smaller and are designed for one or two inmates; other pods have larger\ncells that are designed for four or more inmates.  Some cells, known as “dry” cells, do\nnot have running water or toilets, while some cells do have toilets.\nAs of April 29, 2020, the Jail’s population had been reduced to 478 inmates due\nto various depopulation efforts by the Sheriff’s Office and other entities in Weld County\ndue to the pandemic.  It is the Sheriff’s statutory responsibility to hold inmates in the\nWeld County Jail; he has no authority to unilaterally modify the bonds of pretrial\ndetainees or to release inmates serving a carceral sentence.  Many inmates in the Jail\nhave had recent bond hearings, including plaintiff Richard Barnum.  The state court\njudge denied Barnum’s request to reduce his bond.\n2.    COVID-19 Mitigation at the Jail\nCOVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus.  See “Q&A on\ncoronaviruses (COVID-19),” World Health Organization, Apr. 17, 2020,\n4\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 39\nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses.  Since the COVID-19\npandemic reached Colorado earlier this year, at least 971 people have died from\nCOVID-19, and 19,703 people have tested positive for the virus.  See “Case data,”\nColorado Department of Public Health and Environment,\nhttps://covid19.colorado.gov/case-data (last accessed May 11, 2020).  Governor Jared\nPolis declared a state of emergency in Colorado on March 11, 2020.  Executive Order\nD 2020 003 (March 11, 2020).\nCOVID-19 spreads by respiratory droplets, by direct person-to-person\ntransmission, and by indirect surface-to-person transmission.  To prevent the\ntransmission of COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”)\nrecommends that people wear masks in public areas where social distancing is not\npossible, reduce contacts with other people, wash hands frequently, and regularly\nclean and disinfect high-contact surfaces.  Reducing contacts means both ceasing\nmass gatherings and practicing “social distancing” or “physical distancing” – staying six\nfeet away from people who are not a part of your household.  While COVID-19\npresents some level of risk to anyone who contracts it, certain individuals – “older\nadults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions” – are at\nan elevated risk of serious illness or death should they contract COVID-19.  See\n“People Who Are at Higher Risk for Severe Illness,” Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-\nat-higher-risk.html (last accessed May 8, 2020).  Specifically, the CDC has identified as\n“high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19” people who are 65 years and older, have\n5\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 39\nchronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma, have serious heart conditions, are\nimmunocompromised, have severe obesity, have diabetes, have chronic kidney\ndisease and undergoing dialysis, or have liver disease.  See id.  The Court uses the\nshorthand “medically vulnerable” to refer to persons who are in one or more of these\ncategories.\nThe first “suspected positive” diagnosis of COVID-19 in the Jail occurred on\nMarch 19, 2020.  Since that time, defendant has taken certain steps to reduce the\nspread of the virus within the Jail, including the following:\na.    Intake\nDuring the booking process, new inmates meet with the Jail’s medical staff, who\nare employed by contractor Turn Key Health Clinics, LLC.  The medical staff\nadministers a screening tool to identify whether a new inmate has symptoms of, or has\nbeen exposed to individuals with, COVID-19.  Def’s Exh. A-2.  The screening tool asks\nwhether the new inmate (1) has a fever, flu like symptoms, and a cough or shortness of\nbreath, (2) has traveled outside the United States in the last month, and (3) has been\nexposed to another individual diagnosed or suspected to have COVID-19.  Id. at 2.  If\nthe new inmate answers yes to any of these questions, medical staff conducts further\nscreening of the inmate.  The medical staff also gathers self-reported medical\ninformation from the inmate, but does not specifically screen for whether the inmate is\nmedically vulnerable to COVID-19 and does not test new inmates for COVID-19.  After\ninmates are booked into the Jail, the Jail places them into one housing unit (the\n“transition unit”) until the unit is full.  It is unclear how many inmates go into the\n6\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 39\ntransition unit before it is determined to be full.  Once full, the Jail starts a 14-day\nquarantine of the transition unit.  In the transition unit, there is no segregation of those\ndetainees who are medically vulnerable to COVID-19.  Medical staff check inmates in\nthe transition unit four times per day for COVID-19 symptoms.\nAlthough the Jail has tried to get COVID-19 test kits, it has had difficulty\nacquiring them due to the scarcity of test kits both nationwide and within Colorado. \nDocket No. 26-1 at 23, ¶ 100.  The Jail acquired 25 test kits at the end of March and\nanother 100 test kits two weeks later.\nb.    Pods\nOnce the inmates in the transition unit have completed the 14-day quarantine,\nthey are moved into pods.  The evidence is unclear whether the transition unit inmates\nare kept together as a group or whether the inmates are dispersed into other pods.\nThe Jail has been on a 23-hour lockdown since March 31, 2020.  During\nlockdown, inmates are confined to their cells for 23 hours per day, although individuals\nare let out in certain circumstances, such as if they are housed in a dry cell and need to\nuse the bathroom.  In “Pod C,” where Richard Barnum is housed, there are four\ninmates in his cell, which is approximately 15 feet by 12 feet.  In the “trustee pod,”\nwhere Kevin Monteiro is housed, there are approximately four to five inmates per cell in\neach of the pod’s four cells.  Within each cell, inmates sleep on bunk beds, with the top\nbunk approximately two feet away from the bottom bunk.  As a result, it is not possible\nfor either Barnum or Monteiro to maintain six feet of distance from his cellmates while in\nhis cell.\n7\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 39\nBecause defendant believes that optimal social distancing policies are not\nattainable given the space limitations of the Jail, his plan – based on advice from the\nWeld County Health Department – has been to treat portions of the Jail as a “family\nunit.”  This concept is based on the notion that individuals in households are not\nexpected to maintain social distancing from other members of the household.  It is\nunclear whether the Jail defines a “family unit” as a single cell, a group of cells, or an\nentire housing unit.  While the Jail has recommended that inmates practice social\ndistancing when out of their cells, it has not ordered them to do so.  Were defendant to\ninstead attempt to house inmates within the Jail so that each inmate could keep six feet\nof distance from any other inmate, the maximum capacity of the Jail, in a best-case\nscenario, would be 350 inmates.  Generally, the occupants of several cells are allowed\ninto the common area for an hour at the same time, so there are then as many as ten\npeople in the pod’s common area. \nThe Jail employs professional janitorial staff that does some cleaning in the Jail. \nAdditionally, certain trustee inmates are responsible for cleaning each pod’s common\narea during the day.  However, inmates are responsible for cleaning the communal\nbathrooms themselves.  Inmates are issued a spray called “HALT” to sanitize surfaces. \nBarnum and Monteiro testified that most inmates do not sanitize common areas before\nand after use. \nThe Sheriff’s Office has tried numerous avenues to acquire an adequate supply\nof masks for inmates.  However, due to the limited supply of masks available and the\ndemand for masks from other entities, defendant testified that the Jail has been unable\n8\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 39\nto procure the full amount of masks that it would like to have on hand.  On March 13,\nthe Jail placed an initial order for 50 masks for inmates who were suspected positive for\nCOVID-19.  Def’s Exh. A-8.  On March 23, the Jail placed an order for 500 disposable\nsurgical masks, intended for staff.  Def’s Exh. A-26.  Those surgical masks were\ndistributed to inmates on April 9.  Docket No. 41-1 at 2, ¶ 7.  Barnum and Monteiro\ntestified that the masks are flimsy and that, due to the general shortage of masks, they\nwere forced to wear their masks for at least eight to ten days.  Monteiro also testified\nthat inmates in his pod are not wearing masks because their masks broke and the Jail\nhas not been able to provide them with new ones.\nIn order to minimize the transmission of COVID-19, the Jail has changed policies\nand procedures for staff members.  Officers are now assigned to one unit rather than\nrotating between units.  Officers are required to check their temperature before coming\nto the Jail and also have their temperature checked when they report.  Officers are\ndirected to social distance as best they can from each other.  Officers have been\nissued some disposable masks; however, they are primarily encouraged to use\npersonal cloth masks while working in the Jail.\nc.    Response to Sickness\nThe Jail does not have any policy or procedure designed to minimize the risk to\nmedically vulnerable inmates from contracting COVID-19.  Defendant has not ordered\nthe Jail’s medical staff to develop criteria to identify inmates who are at high risk of\n9\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 39\ninjury or death if they contract COVID-19.3  Defendant also does not have information\nas to how many inmates in the Jail are medically vulnerable.  Defendant testified that\nhe is aware that certain individuals are at high risk of serious illness or death should\nthey contract COVID-19.  However, in his opinion, the expanding list of medical\nconditions that make people “high risk” means that almost all of the inmates in the Jail\nare medically vulnerable.\nIf the Jail’s medical staff believes an inmate to be symptomatic or if an inmate\ntests positive for COVID-19, he is isolated for 14 days.  Def’s Exh. A-92 at 3, ¶ 9(f).  Dr.\nFranco-Paredes testified that, during both of his inspections of the Jail, inmates in the\nisolation unit were not single-celled.  A person can come out of isolation once 14 days\nhas elapsed and he has tested negative for COVID-19 twice.  Accordingly, the Jail must\nhave a sufficient number of test kits both to initially confirm that a person is COVID-19\npositive and to confirm through two tests that he is COVID-19 negative.  Any inmate\nwho was in contact with an inmate placed in isolation is placed in quarantine.  Inmates\nplaced in quarantine are observed by the medical staff.  The Jail’s policy is to maintain\nthe quarantine for at least a 14-day period.  Within the isolation unit, defendant has\ninstituted “cohorting,” which is taking two people who have like health conditions and\nhousing them in the same cell.  According to the relevant CDC guidance, cohorting is\nappropriate in correctional facilities that “do not have enough individual cells” to\n3 An April 22, 2020 memo from Matthew Turner to defendant states that “[w]e are\nworking on identifying at risk inmates that should be celled alone or with minimal other\npeople in their cells,” Docket No. 41-20, but no evidence of the results of these efforts\nwas presented at the hearing.\n10\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 39\nindividually isolate laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and quarantine close\ncontacts, and should be practiced “if there are no other available options.”  See\ngenerally “Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nin Correctional and Detention Facilities” at 15, Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/guidance-\ncorrectional-detention.pdf (last accessed May 8, 2020) (hereinafter “CDC Interim\nGuidance for Correctional Facilities”).  The current policy of the Jail is to have people\nwho are cohorting leave their cell together for purposes such as waiting in line for\nmedication or meals. \nThe medical staff does not treat symptoms consistent with a common cold as\nbeing presumptively positive for COVID-19.  Monteiro testified that he got very sick in\nMarch and had symptoms that included chest tightness and shortness of breath.  Jail\nmedical staff told him he had the common cold, did not isolate him, and did not test him\nfor COVID-19.  There is evidence in the record that the Jail requires an individual to\ndisplay at least four symptoms of COVID-19 before he is removed from his pod.  See\nDocket No. 1-4 at 4, ¶ 13. \n3.    Plaintiff Background\nPlaintiffs allege that they are at high risk of suffering serious medical\ncomplications or death should they contract COVID-19 due to either age, serious\nunderlying health conditions, or both.  See Docket No. 7 at 7-10, ¶¶ 17-24.  Although\n11\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 39\nsome plaintiffs are no longer incarcerated in the Jail,4 plaintiff Richard Barnum has\nbeen incarcerated since October 2019.  Barnum has hypertension, high blood\npressure, stage three kidney disease, hepatitis C, PTSD, major depression, and liver\ndamage.  The Jail staff never asked him whether he was at a higher risk of harm should\nhe contract COVID-19.  Similarly, Jail staff never informed Barnum that he was at a\nhigher risk of harm should he contract COVID-19.  Barnum has not been offered a\nsingle cell due to his medical conditions.  \nKevin Monteiro is also an inmate at the Jail.  Monteiro has chronic asthma and\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  The Jail staff never asked him whether he was\nat a higher risk of harm should he contract COVID-19.  Similarly, Jail staff never\ninformed Monteiro that he was at a higher risk of harm should he contract COVID-19. \nMonteiro has not been offered a single cell due to his medical conditions.  \n4.    Expert Testimony\nDr. Franco-Paredes works in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University\nof Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and has more than 20 years of experience as\nan infectious disease clinician.  Dr. Franco-Paredes worked on the 2003 SARS\npandemic, the 2009 H5N1 influenza outbreak, the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, and\nthe current COVID-19 pandemic.5  Dr. Franco-Paredes does not have any background\n4 The record is not clear as to exactly which plaintiffs remain in Jail custody.  See\nDocket No. 26 at 38 (indicating that Michael Ward and Colby Propes had been\nreleased from the Jail); Docket No. 41 at 10 (indicating that only two plaintiffs remain in\ncustody as of April 24, 2020). \n5 Dr. Franco-Paredes offered expert opinions pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 702. \nDefendant stipulated to Dr. Franco-Paredes’ qualifications as an expert in medicine,\n12\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 39\nor experience in law enforcement, public safety, or the operation of a corrections\nfacility.\nDr. Franco-Paredes inspected the Weld County Jail on April 10 and April 24,\n2020.  Through these inspections, he determined there had been an outbreak of\nCOVID-19 at the Jail before April 10.  That outbreak led to the death of one inmate,\nCharles Peterson, who contracted COVID-19 in the Jail and died one day after he was\nreleased.  Dr. Franco-Paredes wrote in his report, Pl’s Exh. 17, that, between April 10\nand April 24, the leadership and staff of the Jail instituted a substantial number of\ninterventions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in the Jail.\nIn Dr. Franco-Paredes’ opinion, based on data from those countries that are\nexperiencing COVID-19 outbreaks, individuals who are over 55 or those who have\nunderlying medical conditions are at higher risk of serious illness or death from COVID-\n19.  In his opinion, both Richard Barnum and Kevin Monteiro are in that medically\nvulnerable group due to their underlying health conditions.  Dr. Franco-Paredes opined\nthat the housing conditions for Barnum and Monteiro are not safe and that a single cell\nwould be more appropriate for medically vulnerable individuals.  Dr. Franco-Paredes\ncriticized the surgical masks provided by the Jail, noting that although they were better\nthan nothing, they were not fit for long-term wear.  Dr. Franco-Paredes recommends\nthat the Jail (1) identify medically vulnerable inmates, (2) provide single cells for\nmedically vulnerable individuals during the transition period when they arrive at the\nJail, (3) take steps to allow medically vulnerable inmates to socially distance\npublic health, and infectious disease.  Docket No. 50.\n13\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 39\nthemselves within the Jail, (4) improve cleaning techniques within the Jail; and (5)\nreplace masks more frequently or provide cloth masks for inmates. \n5.     Data on the Outbreak in the Jail\nThe parties provided the Court with data regarding the scope of the COVID-19\noutbreak in Weld County Jail.  Pl’s Exh. 8.  As of April 29, 2020, 22 inmates had been\ntested for COVID-19, with ten inmates testing positive.  Id. at 1.  In addition, 17 Jail staff\nmembers had tested positive for COVID-19.  Id. at 2.  Between April 11 and 29, the\nnumber of inmates in isolation fluctuated between a high of 16 on April 16 and a low of\neight on April 28.  Id. at 1. On April 29, seven inmates who had tested positive for\nCOVID-19 were in isolation, along with two additional inmates designated “suspected\npositive.”  Id. \nII.    LEGAL ANALYSIS – PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, “the moving party must demonstrate four\nfactors: (1) a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a likelihood that the movant will\nsuffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of\nequities tips in the movant’s favor; and (4) that the injunction is in the public interest.” \nRoDa Drilling Co. v. Siegal, 552 F.3d 1203, 1208 (10th Cir. 2009).6  Plaintiffs must\nmake a “heightened showing of the four factors,” id., because they seek a disfavored\n6 The Court need not resolve plaintiffs’ class certification motion before issuing\npreliminary injunctive relief.  See Fish v. Kobach, 189 F. Supp. 3d 1107, 1148 (D. Kan.\n2016) (“[C]ase law supports this Court’s authority to issue classwide injunctive relief\nbased on its general equity powers before deciding the class certification motion.”); see\nalso Newberg on Class Actions § 4:30 (5th ed. Dec. 2019 update) (“[A] court may issue\na preliminary injunction in class suits prior to a ruling on the merits.”).\n14\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 39\nmandatory injunction – their requests for relief would “alter the status quo” by requiring\ndefendant to take affirmative actions.  Schrier v. Univ. of Colo., 427 F.3d 1253, 1260\n(10th Cir. 2005); see also Free the Nipple-Fort Collins v. City of Fort Collins, Colo., 916\nF.3d 792, 797 (10th Cir. 2019) (holding that plaintiff must make a “strong showing” in\norder to obtain an injunction that “mandates action”).  The Court addresses each factor\nin turn.\nA.    Likelihood of Success on the Merits\nAs noted earlier, plaintiffs bring two claims for unconstitutional conditions of\nconfinement against defendant under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, one under the Eighth\nAmendment and one under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Both claims are asserted\nagainst Sheriff Reams in his official capacity.7\n1.    Municipal Liability\nA suit against a government officer in his official capacity is a suit against the\nentity of which an officer is an agent.  See Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165-66\n(1985).  A local governing body may be sued under § 1983 only where “the action that\nis alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance,\nregulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body’s officers.” \n7 Defendant contends that plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claim is moot because\nboth plaintiffs bringing that claim have been released from the Jail.  See Docket No. 41\nat 10.  However, both of plaintiffs’ claims are brought on behalf of the same putative\nclass.  See Docket No. 7 at 24-25, ¶ 65 (seeking certification of a class of “[a]ll current\nand future persons held at the Weld County Jail who are at high risk of complications\nfrom COVID-19 . . .”).  There is no need to distinguish the two claims for the purpose of\ndetermining whether injunctive relief is warranted.  Because defendant does not argue\nthat plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment claim is moot, the Court need not resolve\nwhether their Eighth Amendment claim is moot.\n15\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 39\nMonell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690 (1978).  The three elements of a\nMonell claim are “(1) official policy or custom, (2) causation, and (3) state of mind.” \nSchneider v. City of Grand Junction Police Dep't, 717 F.3d 760, 769 (10th Cir. 2013).\nDefendant argues that Weld County cannot be subject to municipal liability for\nplaintiffs’ deliberate indifference claim.  Docket No. 26 at 23-27.  The argument is\nmisplaced.  First, regarding an official policy or custom, defendant ignores that an\nofficial’s actions can give rise to municipal liability “where the decisionmaker possesses\nfinal authority to establish municipal policy with respect to the action ordered.” \nPembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 482-83 (1986); see also Schneider, 717\nF.3d at 770 (noting that “a final decision by a municipal policy maker” may be “deemed\nan official policy or custom”).  Plaintiffs allege that defendant “is a final policymaker for\nWeld County with respect to the customs, policies, and practices of its jail.”  Docket No.\n7 at 10, ¶ 25.  Defendant agrees.  At the preliminary injunction hearing, defendant\ntestified that he is the final decision maker and policy maker for both the Weld County\nSheriff’s Office and the Jail.  See also Docket No. 26-1 at 2, ¶ 5 (defendant’s statement\nthat he was “personally involved in . . . approving” protocols and processes\nimplemented by the Weld County Sheriff’s Office).  Thus, defendant has final\npolicymaking authority with respect to the Jail such that his actions establish an “official\npolicy or custom” that plaintiffs may challenge.  Similarly, plaintiffs have adequately\nalleged that defendant’s challenged policies are “closely related to” the alleged\nviolation of plaintiffs’ Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  See Schneider, 767\nF.3d at 770; see also Docket No. 7 at 22-23, ¶ 59 (alleging that the Jail is “not taking\n16\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 39\nadequate precautions to protect vulnerable people or to quarantine people with\nsymptoms”).  Finally, the relevant state of mind for a municipal liability claim is\n“deliberate indifference” – “an objective standard which is satisfied if the risk is so\nobvious that the official should have known of it.”  See Barney v. Pulsipher, 143 F.3d\n1299, 1307 n.5 (10th Cir. 1998); Schneider, 717 F.3d at 771.8  Plaintiffs adequately\nallege that the transmission of COVID-19 and the heightened danger that such\ntransmission poses to the plaintiff class in the Weld County Jail is such a risk.  See,\ne.g., Docket No. 7 at 18, ¶ 43 (alleging that “public health guidance put all sheriffs on\nnotice of the dire risk of the spread of COVID-19 through jails without substantial\nchanges to the jail environment”).  At the hearing, defendant testified that he was aware\nthat COVID-19 presented both a general risk to all inmates in the Jail and a heightened\nrisk to members of the plaintiff class.  In fact, defendant does not contest, for the\npurposes of this motion, that COVID-19 satisfies the Eighth Amendment objective\nstandard for deliberate indifference.  See Docket No. 26 at 29.  Thus, the Court rejects\ndefendant’s argument that the complaint fails to establish a municipal liability claim\nagainst Weld County.\n2.    Eighth Amendment Claim\n“A prison official’s ‘deliberate indifference’ to a substantial risk of serious harm to\nan inmate violates the Eighth Amendment.”  See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 828\n8 This deliberate indifference standard, which applies to municipal liability, is\ndifferent from the deliberate indifference standard for an Eighth Amendment claim.  See\nBarney, 143 F.3d at 1307 n.5 (“Deliberate indifference . . . is defined differently for\nEighth Amendment and municipal liability purposes.”).\n17\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of 39\n(1994); see also Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993) (“The [Eighth]\nAmendment . . . requires that inmates be furnished with the basic human needs, one of\nwhich is ‘reasonable safety.’” (citing DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep’t of Social\nServs., 489 U.S. 189, 199 (1989))).9  “The analysis [of an Eighth Amendment claim]\nshould not be based on ‘a court’s idea of how best to operate a detention facility,’” but\nshould reflect “the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing\nsociety,” which the Tenth Circuit has characterized as a “lofty standard.”  DeSpain v.\nUphoff, 264 F.3d 965, 973-74 (10th Cir. 2001) (citing Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S.\n337, 351 (1981)).  To prevail on the claim that defendant violated the Eighth\nAmendment, plaintiffs must show that (1) objectively, the harm they complain of is\n9 Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claim is brought on behalf of “persons in carceral\ncustody,” while their Fourteenth Amendment claim is brought on behalf of pretrial\ndetainees.  See Docket No. 7 at 25-27.  Although pretrial detainees are protected\nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment rather than the Eighth\nAmendment, in the Tenth Circuit courts apply “an analysis identical to that applied in\nEighth Amendment cases” in determining whether a pretrial detainee’s rights were\nviolated at the time he was assaulted.  Lopez v. LeMaster, 172 F.3d 756, 759 n.2 (10th\nCir. 1999).  Plaintiffs contend that Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466 (2015),\nwhich held that “the appropriate standard for a pretrial detainee’s excessive force claim\nis solely an objective one,” changed the standard for pretrial detainees making\ndeliberate indifference claims.  Docket No. 1 at 32-33 n.62.  The circuit courts have\nsplit on the applicability of Kingsley to the medical-care context.  See Miranda v. Cty. of\nLake, 900 F.3d 335, 352 (7th Cir. 2018) (joining the Second and Ninth Circuits in\nconcluding that “medical-care claims brought by pretrial detainees under the\nFourteenth Amendment are subject only to the objective unreasonableness inquiry” but\nacknowledging that the Fifth, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits have confined Kingsley to\nthe excessive-force context).  The Tenth Circuit has declined to rule definitively on the\nissue.  See Burke v. Regalado, 935 F. 3d 960, 991 n.9 (10th Cir. 2019); Perry v.\nDurborow, 892 F.3d 1116, 1122 n.1 (10th Cir. 2018).  Because the Court finds that\nplaintiffs have satisfied their burden under the Eighth Amendment standard, which is\nmore favorable to defendant, the Court need not resolve this dispute.  See Burke, 935\nF.3d at 991 n.9 (noting that the Eighth Amendment standard is more favorable to a\ndefendant).  \n18\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of 39\nsufficiently “serious” to merit constitutional protection, and (2) defendant was\nsubjectively aware of a substantial risk to plaintiffs’ health or safety and acted in\npurposeful disregard of that risk.  Martinez v. Beggs, 563 F.3d 1082, 1088 (10th Cir.\n2009).\nIn evaluating the objective factor, courts “look to whether the harm suffered rises\nto a level ‘sufficiently serious’ to be cognizable under the Cruel and Unusual\nPunishment Clause.”  Mata v. Saiz, 427 F.3d 745 (10th Cir. 2005) (quoting Farmer, 511\nU.S. at 834).   COVID-19 is a potentially deadly disease that has led to unprecedented\nmeasures around the world to stop its spread.  While COVID-19 presents some risk of\nharm to all individuals, the record indicates that members of the plaintiff class face a\nelevated risk of illness or death should they contract it.  See Docket No. 1-1 at 6;\nDocket No. 1-2 at 3.  Defendant conceded that plaintiffs have satisfied the objective\nfactor of the deliberate indifference test.  See Docket No. 26 at 29.  Moreover, he\ntestified at the preliminary injunction hearing that he is aware of the heightened risk of\nharm that COVID-19 presents to members of the plaintiff class.  Thus, the Court finds\nthat the objective factor is satisfied and focuses its analysis on the subjective factor.\n“[P]rison officials who actually knew of a substantial risk to inmate health or\nsafety may be found free from liability if they respond[] reasonably to the risk.”  Farmer,\n511 U.S. at 844.  COVID-19 poses some risk of harm to any individual.  That risk can\nbe thought of as the probability that an individual will contract the virus multiplied by the\nprobability of experiencing serious illness or death from having contracted it.  The first\nvariable – the risk of contracting the virus – is within defendant’s capacity to control,\n19\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of 39\nwhile the second variable – the risk of serious illness or death from contracting the\nvirus – is largely not.  Rather, members of the plaintiff class have a higher risk of\nserious illness or death because they are over 55 years of age or have underlying\nhealth conditions.  \nAs noted earlier, by the time of the hearing, defendant had taken several steps\nto reduce the risk that inmates will contract COVID-19 in the Jail.  These include (1) an\nisolation and quarantine procedure for individuals who are presumed positive for\nCOVID-19 and for individuals who came in contact with presumptive positive inmates,\n(2) a procedure for quarantining new inmates as they enter the Jail, (3) keeping\ninmates in “family units” after being quarantined, and (4) locking down the Jail for 23\nhours at a time.  Defendant has also provided inmates with masks and cleaning\nsupplies, and there is some evidence that inmates are able to socially distance in the\nhour they spend out of their cell each day.  Plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Franco-Paredes, noted\nafter his second inspection of the Jail on April 24 that Jail leadership had instituted a\nsubstantial number of interventions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.  Indeed,\nplaintiffs withdrew their initial request for a temporary restraining order on the basis of\ninterventions made by defendant throughout the first two weeks of April.  As a result of\nthese interventions, the data before the Court is that, in the month of April, COVID-19\ntransmission within the Jail has trended downward, with nine inmates isolated as of\nApril 29.  See Pl’s Exh. 8.\nHowever, the record indicates that defendant has not instituted any specific\nprecautions to protect medically vulnerable inmates.  As discussed earlier, these\n20\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of 39\ninmates – older individuals and those with certain underlying health conditions – have\nan elevated risk of serious illness or death should they contract COVID-19.  Defendant\ntestified at the preliminary injunction hearing that he is aware that COVID-19 presents a\nhigher risk of harm to these individuals.  Despite knowing of that elevated risk,\ndefendant has not ordered the Jail’s medical staff to identify those inmates who are\nmedically vulnerable to COVID-19.  As a result, defendant is not aware of how many\ninmates within the Jail are medically vulnerable, and he does not know which inmates\nthose are. \nAlthough defendant has not made any effort to identify medically vulnerable\ninmates, he may still be “found free from liability if [he] responded reasonably to the\nrisk” presented to them.  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 844.  The reasonableness of the Jail’s\nresponse as to non-vulnerable inmates is not before the Court at this time, as they are\nexcluded from the plaintiff class.   Assuming arguendo that the Jail’s COVID-19\nmitigation efforts were reasonable as to the risk posed to non-vulnerable inmates, the\nCourt considers whether the mitigation efforts were reasonable with respect to\nmedically vulnerable inmates.\na.    Social Distancing\nA jail’s ability to facilitate proper social distancing is limited, both by the jail’s\npopulation and its physical layout.  Defendant testified that, in order to provide six feet\nof spacing with optimal use of cells, the Jail would have to reduce the inmate\npopulation to 350 inmates.  See also Docket No. 26-1 at 25, ¶ 112.  As defendant\ntestified, he does not have the authority to reduce the inmate population.  However,\n21\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 22 of 39\ndefendant has not tried to formulate a plan that would optimize social distancing for\nmedically vulnerable inmates.  As a result, medically vulnerable inmates like Monteiro\nand Barnum are confined in cells in which it is impossible for them to maintain six feet\nof distance from their cellmates.  Importantly, defendant has not identified any\nimpediment to formulating such a plan.  Rather, defendant testified that, as a general\nmatter, social distancing is not possible for medically vulnerable inmates while housed\nin the Jail.  Given that the ability to provide medically vulnerable inmates with the\nopportunity for social distancing is largely a function of how much cell space is\navailable to them, the Court is unsure how defendant could reach this conclusion\nwithout understanding how many inmates are in the medically vulnerable  group.  It is\nclear to the Court that defendant has the ability to determine a number of possible\napproaches to increase social distancing within cells and outside of them for the\nmedically vulnerable, just as he did when considering the application of a six-foot social\ndistancing requirement to all inmates.10  While the Court does not know whether, for a\nfact, it is possible to achieve substantially improved social distancing for plaintiffs while\nsimultaneously protecting other inmates, that information is uniquely in defendant’s\npossession.  See Docket No. 41 at 5 n.5 (providing the Court with “representative” pod\ndiagrams but stating that disclosure of “the overall floor plan or layout” of the Jail “could\n10 Defendant acknowledges that he has no impediment to formulating housing\nplans to better protect inmates from exposure to COVID-19: “The [Weld County\nSheriff’s Office] has also continually assessed how best to house inmates within the\nphysical limitations of the [Jail].”  Docket No. 41 at 5.\n22\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 23 of 39\ncreate a security risk”).11  Courts have ordered jails to enact social distancing measures\nduring this pandemic.  See, e.g., Jones v. Wolf, 2020 WL 1643857, at *14 (W.D.N.Y.\nApr. 2, 2020) (granting temporary restraining order where, because the detention\nfacility was at “roughly half of its capacity,” it “remain[ed] plausible that” defendants\ncould provide vulnerable individuals within the facility “with a living situation that\nfacilitates ‘social distancing’”).  The Court concludes that defendant’s social distancing\nefforts with respect to medically vulnerable inmates has not been reasonable.12 \nb.    Family Groups\nThe record before the Court does not indicate that the Jail’s policies with regard\nto family groups are clearly or consistently implemented.  It is unclear whether the Jail\n11 In his supplemental response, defendant states that “none of [the plaintiffs]\nwere included in [a] list of inmates [Jail] medical staff identified as high risk for dangers\nfrom COVID-19.”  See Docket No. 41 at 11.  The exhibits cited by defendant in support\nof this statement do not describe such a list of inmates or explain how such list was\ndeveloped.  See Def’s Exhs. B-22, B-25.  Moreover, this statement, if true, raises more\nquestions than it answers.  Plaintiff Richard Barnum testified that he has high blood\npressure, stage three kidney disease, hepatitis C, PTSD, major depression, and liver\ndamage.  Despite those medical conditions, Jail medical staff has apparently not\nidentified him as a medically vulnerable inmate.  The Court is thus not convinced, even\nif the Jail is taking some measures to identify medically vulnerable inmates, that those\nmeasures are accurate or adequate and that its criteria are based on acceptable public\nhealth agency guidelines.  See “People Who Are at Higher Risk for Severe Illness,”\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (medically vulnerable people include those\nwho are immunocompromised, with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis, and\nwith liver disease).\n12 The CDC offers a variety of strategies to provide social distancing in\ncorrectional facilities and gives guidance that jails should implement strategies “tailored\nto the individual space in the facility and the needs of the population and staff.”  See\nCDC Interim Guidance for Correctional Facilities at 11.  The evidence does not suggest\nthat defendant’s social distancing strategy in the Jail is tailored to the physical space\nand population of the Jail.\n23\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 24 of 39\ntreats a single cell, a group of cells, or an entire pod as a family group.  It is also\nunclear whether family groups are a mix of medically vulnerable and non-vulnerable\ninmates, a consequence of the Jail’s lack of data on its inmate population.  However, as\nDr. Franco-Paredes noted, even a biological family living in a house would take extra\nprecautions to protect an aged or infirm member of the household. \nWhile both the CDC and Dr. Franco-Paredes recommend social distancing first\nand foremost, where proper distance cannot be fully achieved the use of family groups\n– medically vulnerable inmates who have shown no signs of COVID-19 for 14 days and\nwho are kept together for the purposes of being cellmates and using common areas –\nmay be an appropriate supplemental strategy. \nc.    Sanitation\nThe Jail maintains that it is providing adequate sanitation and cleaning supplies\nto inmates.  Based on the somewhat vague testimony as to sanitation of pods offered at\nthe hearing, it appears that the Jail employs professional janitors to clean parts of the\nJail during the evening, has trustee cleaning of common areas in pods during the day,\nand gives inmates additional responsibility for cleaning common areas, such as toilets\nand showers, before and after use with HALT spray.  Defendant identifies no\nimpediment to providing heightened sanitation to the medically vulnerable.13  The Court\nfinds that implementing (1) cleaning of surfaces in the common area before medically\n13 The CDC recommends that frequently touched surfaces are cleaned and\ndisinfected several times per day, and that Jails should “[c]onsider increasing the\nnumber of staff and/or [inmates] trained and responsible for cleaning common areas to\nensure continual cleaning of these areas throughout the day.”  See CDC Interim\nGuidance for Correctional Facilities at 9.\n24\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 25 of 39\nvulnerable inmates or family groups are released to that area and (2) more frequent\nprofessional or trustee cleaning of toilets and sinks (in addition to the current practice\nof having cleaning supplies available in these areas) would help minimize medically\nvulnerable inmates’ risk of contracting the virus while being feasible and practical for\nthe Jail. \nd.    Monitoring\nDefendant has instituted monitoring practices in the transition and isolation\nunits.  Inmates in the transition unit are checked four times per day for COVID-19\nsymptoms.  Similarly, inmates in the isolation unit are regularly observed by the\nmedical staff.  There appear to be no impediments to extending some kind of enhanced\nmonitoring to medically vulnerable inmates who are not housed in either the transition\nor isolation unit.\ne.    Intake\nThe current intake process appears to present a danger to medically vulnerable\ninmates.  While new inmates provide a medical history and are screened for COVID-19\nsymptoms before being placed in the transition unit, the record indicates that medically\nvulnerable inmates are not single-celled or otherwise segregated in the transition unit\nas more inmates are placed in the unit.  As a result, defendant’s policy appears to\nexpose medically vulnerable inmates to an elevated risk of contracting COVID-19\nduring the intake process. \nBecause of these deficiencies in defendant’s response to COVID-19, the Court\nis persuaded on the record before it that plaintiffs have shown a substantial likelihood\n25\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 26 of 39\nof success of proving that defendant has acted in purposeful disregard of the elevated\nrisk of harm that COVID-19 presents to members of the plaintiff class.14\nB.    Irreparable Harm\n“[A] showing of probable irreparable harm is the single most important\nprerequisite for the issuance of a preliminary injunction.”  DTC Energy Group, Inc. v.\nHirschfeld, 912 F.3d 1263, 1270 (10th Cir. 2018) (quoting First W. Capital Mgmt. Co. v.\nMalamed, 874 F.3d 1136, 1141 (10th Cir. 2017)).  The moving party “must demonstrate\na significant risk that he or she will experience harm that cannot be compensated after\nthe fact by money damages.”  Fish v. Kobach, 840 F.3d 710, 751 (10th Cir. 2016).\nThe Court determines that plaintiffs have shown a significant risk of probable\nirreparable harm.  The fact that plaintiffs are exposed to some risk of contracting\nCOVID-19, however small, is probably not sufficient to prove irreparable harm, even\nthough they are more vulnerable.  For example, if plaintiffs were released, they would\nstill suffer some risk of exposure in the community.  However, the plaintiffs who are\n14 The cases cited by defendant in his most recent notice of supplemental\nauthority are not on point.  See Docket No. 54.  Broadly speaking, courts in these\ncases concluded that prison officials’ response to COVID-19 was not deliberately\nindifferent.  See Money v. Pritzker, 2020 WL 1820660, at *18 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 10, 2020)\n(no deliberate indifference where record indicated that defendants had not “turned . . .\n[a] blind eye and deaf ear to a known problem”); Mays v. Dart, 2020 WL 1987007, at\n*25, (N.D. Ill. Apr. 27, 2020) (granting preliminary injunction under Fourteenth\nAmendment standard but noting, in dicta, that the Sheriff had “been anything but\ndeliberately indifferent to the risk of harm” from COVID-19); Valentine v. Collier, _ F.3d\n__, 2020 WL 1934431, at *4 (5th Cir. Apr. 22, 2020) (staying injunction where the\ndistrict court applied the incorrect legal standard for deliberate indifference claims). \nDeliberate indifference claims, however, are “intensely fact-based.”  See Valentine,\n2020 WL 1934431, at *9 (Higginson, J., concurring in the judgment).  On these facts,\nthe Court is satisfied that plaintiffs have shown a substantial likelihood of success on\nthe merits of their deliberate indifference claim. \n26\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 27 of 39\nconfined are not only confined in close quarters, but some inmates in the Jail have\nalready contracted COVID-19.  See Docket No. 26-1 at 26, ¶ 114 (defendant’s\ndeclaration that at least ten inmates have tested positive for COVID-19).  Although\ndefendant argues that the decreasing number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Jail\nindicate that plaintiffs do not have a risk of irreparable harm, see Docket No. 41 at 11,\ndefendant does not deny that some inmates are still in isolation after contracting\nCOVID-19 in the Jail, and aysmptomatic staff and new inmates present an ongoing\npossibility of additional sources of infection.  The Jail is taking the preventative\nmeasures it is currently taking because of the real risk of COVID-19 exposure to\ninmates. \nC.    Balance of Equities \nThe Court finds that the balance of equities weighs in plaintiffs’ favor.  The\nrecord indicates that plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class face a high risk of\nserious illness or death if they contract COVID-19 while in the Weld County Jail.  This\noutweighs the harms identified by the defendant, which include “maintaining control\nover the [Jail] without Court supervision” and the costs of complying with plaintiffs’\nproposed preliminary injunction.  See Docket No. 26 at 33-35.  Although the Court\nacknowledges defendant’s interest in retaining discretion to administer the Jail,\n“[c]ourts may not allow constitutional violations to continue simply because a remedy\nwould involve intrusion into the realm of prison administration.”  Brown v. Plata, 563\nU.S. 493, 511 (2011). \n27\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 28 of 39\nD.    Public Interest\nThe Court finds that entering a preliminary injunction would further the public\ninterest in two ways.  First, “it is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of\na party’s constitutional rights,” as a preliminary injunction would do here.  See Awad v.\nZiriax, 670 F.3d 1111, 1132 (10th Cir. 2012).  Moreover, the Court agrees with plaintiffs\nthat minimizing the exposure of inmates with pre-existing vulnerabilities furthers public\nhealth, which is a matter of public interest.  See, e.g., Castillo v. Barr, 2020 WL\n1502864, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 27, 2020) (noting that “[t]he public has a critical interest\nin preventing the further spread of the coronavirus”); Banks v. Booth, 2020 WL\n1914896, at *12 (D.D.C. Apr. 19, 2020) (observing that “[n]o man’s health is an island”). \nDefendant argues that a preliminary injunction would unreasonably threaten public\nsafety, pointing at length to plaintiffs’ arrest records and raising the specter of the Court\n“overrid[ing] public safety decisions made by Colorado state court judges.”  See Docket\nNo. 26 at 35-39.  However, as mentioned earlier, plaintiffs have withdrawn any request\nfor an order that would release or transfer prisoners from the Jail.  Thus, this argument\nfails to show that a preliminary injunction would be adverse to the public interest. \nIn sum, the Court is satisfied that plaintiffs have made a heightened showing that\nthey are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, that they will suffer irreparable\nharm in the absence of a temporary restraining order, and that the balance of equities\nand public interest tips in their favor.  See RoDa Drilling, 552 F.3d at 1208.  Thus,\nplaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction.\n28\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 29 of 39\nIII.    INJUNCTION\nHaving determined that plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction, the\nCourt turns to the appropriate scope of the injunction.  \nRule 65(d)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires every order\ngranting an injunction or restraining order to “(A) state the reasons why it issued; (B)\nstate its terms specifically; and (C) describe in reasonable detail – and not by referring\nto the complaint or other document – the act or acts restrained or required.” \nAdditionally, because this is a civil action related to prison conditions, the Court must\nalso consider the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 3626, a portion of the Prison Litigation\nReform Act.15  Section 3626(a)(2) requires that preliminary injunctive relief be “narrowly\ndrawn, extend no further than necessary to correct the harm the court finds requires\npreliminary relief, and be the least intrusive means necessary to correct that harm.” \nFurther, the Court must “give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety\nor the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the preliminary relief.”  Id. \nFinally, any preliminary injunctive relief that “requires . . . a government official to\nexceed his or her authority under State or local law” may only be issued upon a finding\nthat “(i) Federal law requires such relief to be ordered in violation of State or local law;\n15 This statute extends to relief requested by pretrial detainees.  See 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3626(g)(3) (defining “prisoner” as, among other things, “any person subject to\nincarceration . . . who is accused of . . . violations of criminal law”).  Similarly, the Weld\nCounty Jail is a “prison” within the meaning of the statute.  See id. § 3626(g)(5)\n(defining “prison” as, among other things, any “local facility that incarcerates or detains\n[individuals] accused of . . . violations of criminal law”).\n29\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 30 of 39\n(ii) the relief is necessary to correct the violation of a Federal right; and (iii) no other\nrelief will correct the violation of the Federal right.”  Id. § 3626(a)(1)(B).\nThe Court evaluates plaintiffs’ requested injunction as set out in Docket No. 49-\n2.16\nA.    Social Distancing and Identification of Medically Vulnerable Inmates\nPlaintiffs request that the Court order defendant to “[p]hysically distance all\ninmates from one another and staff within the Weld County Jail.”  Docket No. 49-2 at 3,\n¶ 1.  Relatedly, plaintiffs request an order for defendant to “[i]dentify inmates at high-\nrisk . . . from COVID-19 . . . and physically distance these individuals particularly.”  Id.,\n¶ 2.  As discussed previously, the record indicates that defendant has taken no steps to\nidentify those inmates who are medically vulnerable and to prioritize them for single\ncells or other housing situations where they can properly socially distance themselves. \nAccordingly, the Court will order defendant to identify those individuals who are,\naccording to the CDC guidelines, at a high risk of serious illness or death from COVID-\n19.  See “People Who Are at Higher Risk for Severe Illness,” Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (identifying people as medically vulnerable who are 65 years\nand older, have chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma, have serious heart\nconditions, are immunocompromised, have severe obesity, have diabetes, have chronic\nkidney disease and are undergoing dialysis, or have liver disease).  \n16 While plaintiffs’ overarching goal for injunctive relief has been consistent –\n“ensur[ing] that [p]laintiffs are protected from the threat of COVID-19 exposure” while\nheld within Weld County Jail, see Docket No. 1 at 5-6 – the exact scope of plaintiffs’\nrequested relief has shifted over the course of this case.  Compare id. at 6-7 with\nDocket No. 49-2 at 3-4. \n30\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 31 of 39\nOnce these individuals have been identified, defendant is ordered to put in place\na plan to enhance the general steps already taken in the Jail in order to better protect\nthese medically vulnerable individuals.  The plan should include taking steps to socially\ndistance these individuals within the Jail, to the extent practicable given the Jail’s\nphysical layout and population level.  The Court recognizes that, due to the lack of data\nas to how many medically vulnerable inmates are in the Jail, it is currently unclear to\nwhat extent these inmates can be socially distanced.  However, the record indicates\nthat, while it is not possible for all inmates to socially distance according to CDC\nguidelines given the Jail’s current population level, the Jail is well below half of its\nmaximum capacity, indicating that there is space within the Jail to increase the amount\nof physical distancing for at least some inmates. \nDefendant is ordered to consider whether, as part of his plan to minimize the risk\nof transmission to medically vulnerable inmates, such inmates should be moved to one\nor more pods made up solely of medically vulnerable inmates.  As Monteiro testified,\nsome inmates are not taking precautions available to them, such as wearing masks or\ndisinfecting common areas.17  The Jail can consider, based on its own observations,\nwhether medically vulnerable inmates are more likely to take precautions for their own\n17 Defendant raised the absurd specter of having to Taser inmates to enforce\nsocial distancing.  See Docket No. 26 at 8.  While jails have limited means to make all\ninmates wear masks and follow social distancing directives, any plan must take into\naccount the risk to medically vulnerable inmates from non-compliant inmates, utilizing\ncommon sense (e.g. using family groupings or staggering release of individual cells) as\na touchstone.\n31\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 32 of 39\nsafety and are thus likely to be safer in an environment consisting only of medically\nvulnerable inmates. \nB.    Sanitation and Hygiene\nPlaintiffs request an order for defendant to “professionally disinfect and sanitize”\nthe Jail and to “[p]rovide hygiene supplies . . . to inmates at all times.”  Docket No. 49-2\nat 3, ¶¶ 3-4.  Plaintiffs concede in their reply that at least some of this relief has been\npartially implemented.  See Docket No. 49 at 5 (noting that “hygiene products have\nbeen provided to inmates”).  Further, defendant testified at the hearing about the steps\nthe Jail has taken to sanitize, which include making both cleaning supplies and\npersonal hygiene supplies available to inmates.  However, the record also indicates\nthat the current sanitation procedures are inadequate to protect medically vulnerable\ninmates, as inmates are not consistently sanitizing common areas and the Jail does not\nhave either janitorial staff or trustees cleaning common areas several times a day, as\nrecommended by CDC guidelines.  Accordingly, the Court will order the Jail to\nimplement a policy to improve sanitation for toilets, sinks, and common areas used by\nmedically vulnerable inmates, either by increasing the use of professional cleaning staff\nor by increasing the frequency with which pods are cleaned by trained trustees. \nC.    Personal Protective Equipment\nPlaintiffs request that the Court order defendant to “[p]rovide adequate personal\nprotection equipment . . . to all staff members and inmates.”  Docket No. 49-2 at 3, ¶ 5. \nPlaintiffs have not introduced evidence regarding personal protective equipment other\nthan masks, so that is what the Court will focus on.  The record regarding masks is\n32\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 33 of 39\nconcerning.  Both Monteiro and Barnum testified that they had been wearing Jail-\nprovided surgical face masks for far longer than the recommended three days.18  Dr.\nFranco-Paredes criticized the surgical masks given to inmates as unfit for long-term\nwear.  Defendant testified that, due to supply chain issues and competition with other\nentities in Weld County that need masks, the Jail has been unable to get the full\namount of masks that it needs.  However, the Jail’s efforts to obtain masks have\nfocused on staff, not inmates.  Thus, the defendant is ordered to formulate a plan to\nobtain a sufficient number or type of masks for inmates so that they may be used\nproperly.\nD.    Quarantine and Isolation Procedure\nPlaintiffs request that defendant be ordered to “[i]mplement a testing procedure\nto identify inmates who are possibly carrying COVID-19” and “a quarantine and\nisolation procedure that is in line with CDC guidelines for all individuals exposed to\nCOVID-19 and new intakes to the Weld County Jail.”  Docket No. 49-2 at 4, ¶ 6-7.  The\nCourt is not persuaded that the record supports such relief.  As for testing, it is not clear\nfrom the record that the Jail has the quantity of test kits necessary to implement a wide-\nranging testing procedure or that the Jail can acquire a sufficient number of test kits.  \nAs for the quarantine procedure, defendant testified that inmates in the Jail who are\nsymptomatic or test positive for COVID-19 are isolated for 14 days, and that such a\npractice is consistent with the CDC guidelines.  Plaintiffs argue in their reply that this\n18 Defendant has recognized the need for Jail staff to be able to rotate their\nmasks for decontamination purposes.  See Docket No. 41 at 4.\n33\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 34 of 39\npractice is unreasonable because it focuses only on symptomatic inmates.  Plaintiffs,\nhowever, do not explain how the current procedure is inconsistent with the CDC\nguidelines or otherwise unreasonable.  Plaintiffs have not demonstrated an entitlement\nto injunctive relief on this issue.\nNevertheless, the Court agrees with plaintiffs that injunctive relief is needed for\nnew intakes into the Jail.  Defendant testified that new inmates are placed into a\ndesignated housing unit until that unit is “full,” at which point the Jail starts a 14-day\nclock before those individuals are introduced to the general population.  The Jail\ncomplies with the CDC recommendation for new inmates generally.  See CDC Interim\nGuidance for Correctional Facilities at 14 (recommending that, if possible, jails\nquarantine all new inmates for 14 days).  However, the Jail places more than one\ninmate in a cell in the transition unit, and there is no evidence that new inmates are\ngiven a COVID-19 test.  See id. at 4 (noting that, ideally, “each quarantined individual\nwould be quarantined in a single cell”).  As a result, the intake procedure may expose\nmedical vulnerable inmates to other inmates in the transition unit who may be infected\nwith COVID-19.  There does not appear to be any impediment to coordinating\nincreased social distancing of medically vulnerable inmates in the transition unit with\nthe Jail’s plan to increase social distancing once an inmate leaves the transition unit.\nE.    Food Handling and Delivery\nPlaintiffs request that the Court order defendant to “[t]ake particularly heightened\nprecautions with respect to food handling and delivery.”  Docket No. 49-2 at 4, ¶ 8. \nHowever, plaintiffs offer no evidence that COVID-19 is transmissible via food or that the\n34\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 35 of 39\nJail’s current food handling and sanitation procedures are inadequate.  See “Food\nSafety,” https://www.usda.gov/coronavirus (last accessed May 7, 2020) (noting that the\nUSDA is “not aware of any reports at this time of human illnesses that suggest COVID-\n19 can be transmitted by food”).  \nF.    Educational and Informational Materials\nFinally, plaintiffs request that the Court order defendant to “[p]rovide accurate,\nup-to-date educational and informational materials” about COVID-19’s effect on the\nfacility.  Docket No. 49-2 at 4, ¶ 9.  However, there is evidence in the record that\ndefendant is providing some informational materials within the Jail.  See, e.g., Def’s\nExh. A-38; Docket No. 26-1 at 20-21, ¶¶ 84, 87.  Accordingly, interim injunctive relief in\nthis area does not appear necessary in order to mitigate the risk of harm to members of\nthe plaintiff class.\nG.    Security\nUnder Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c), “[t]he court may issue a preliminary injunction or a\ntemporary restraining order only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court\nconsiders proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have\nbeen wrongfully enjoined or restrained.”  A trial court has “wide discretion under Rule\n65(c) in determining whether to require security.”  Winnebago Tribe of Neb. v. Stovall,\n341 F.3d 1202, 1206 (10th Cir. 2003) (internal quotations omitted).  Plaintiffs argue that\nthe Court should waive the security requirement.  Docket No. 1 at 52.  Defendant\n35\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 36 of 39\nargues that the Court should order that plaintiffs post a security of $1,000,000.  Docket\nNo. 41 at 12-13.19\nThe Court agrees with plaintiffs.  First, plaintiffs represent that they are indigent. \nSee Docket No. 1 at 52.  The pretrial detainees are in the Jail because they are unable\nto post bond.  Indigent plaintiffs “ordinarily should not be required to post a bond under\nRule 65(c).”  See Bass v. Richardson, 338 F. Supp. 478, 490 (S.D.N.Y. 1971); see also\n11A Fed. Prac. & Proc. § 2954 (noting that Bass “seems correct and has been followed\nby other courts”).  Second, the Tenth Circuit has indicated that “a minimal bond amount\nshould be considered” in cases where a party is seeking to vindicate a public interest. \nSee Davis v. Mineta, 302 F.3d 1104, 1126 (10th Cir. 2002), abrogated on other\ngrounds by Dine Citizens Against Ruining Our Env't v. Jewell, 839 F.3d 1276 (10th Cir.\n2016).  Finally, the Court is not persuaded that compliance with this order will cause\nsignificant damages to defendant while this order is in effect.  There is no evidence in\nthe record indicating that cost is an obstacle to social distancing or instituting increased\nsanitation measures in the Jail.  Thus, the Court will waive the security requirement.\nIV.    CONCLUSION\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presents a nearly unprecedented challenge to every\nperson and institution in our society, and the Court acknowledges that defendant faces\n19 Defendant initially requested a security of $500,000, a figure obtained by\nmultiplying half of the daily net operating cost of the Jail by the 14 days that a\ntemporary restraining order would be in effect.  See Docket No. 26 at 39 n.13.  As\ndefendant conceded in his brief, the Court finds that ordering indigent plaintiffs to post\nsubstantial security based on the daily operating cost of the entire jail – not the cost of\ncomplying with any injunctive relief – would be “harsh.”  See id.\n36\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 37 of 39\ndifficult considerations in how best to respond.  However, “[p]rison walls do not form a\nbarrier separating prison inmates from the protections of the Constitution.”  Turner v.\nSafley, 483 U.S. 78, 84 (1987).  The record indicates that defendant has failed to take\nadequate measures to protect members of the plaintiff class from COVID-19 given that\nthey face a heightened risk of serious illness or death from the virus.  Accordingly,\nplaintiffs’ conditions of confinement violate the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution,\nand plaintiffs are entitled to a limited preliminary injunction to ameliorate those\nconditions.\nSuch an injunction has no adverse effect on public safety, does not have more\nthan a minimal adverse effect on the operation of the criminal justice system, is\nnarrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the harm the Court finds\nrequires preliminary relief, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct that\nharm.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2). \nTherefore, it is\nORDERED that the portion of plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order,\nPreliminary Injunction, and Expedited Hearing [Docket No. 1] seeking a preliminary\ninjunction is GRANTED IN PART.  It is further\nORDERED that, on or before May 18, 2020, at 5:00 p.m., defendant shall certify\nto the Court that he has compiled a list of those persons (“medically vulnerable\ninmates”) currently held at the Weld County Jail who have one or more of the following\nconditions: are 65 years and older, have chronic lung disease or moderate to severe\nasthma, have serious heart conditions, are immunocompromised, have severe obesity,\n37\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 38 of 39\nhave diabetes, have chronic kidney disease and undergoing dialysis, or have liver\ndisease.  Defendant shall provide to the Court and plaintiffs a list of medically\nvulnerable inmates by inmate number, identifying for each what risk categories the\ninmate has and explaining what process he used to identify medically vulnerable\ninmates.  It is further\nORDERED that, on or before May 21, 2020, at 5:00 p.m., defendant is ordered\nto institute the following policies or procedures in the Weld County Jail:\n(1) A policy ensuring that, to the maximum extent possible considering the Jail’s\nphysical layout, population level, and classification needs, medically vulnerable\ninmates are “socially distanced” from other inmates housed in the Jail.  If social\ndistancing is effectively impossible for some or all of the medically vulnerable inmates\nin the Jail, such policy may be supplemented by housing medically vulnerable inmates\ntogether in one or more pods.\n(2) A procedure, as part of the intake of new inmates into the Jail, for medically\nvulnerable inmates to be single-celled or otherwise socially distanced, to the maximum\nextent possible considering the Jail’s physical layout and classification needs, while\nhoused in the transition unit. \n(3) A policy of enhanced sanitation procedures in areas where medically\nvulnerable inmates are housed.  This may include expanded use of professional\ncleaning services of the Jail and/or increasing the frequency with which trustees clean\ncommon areas in non-trustee pods.  Such policy should be compliant with the CDC\nguidelines for cleaning and disinfecting practices. \n38\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH   Document 55   Filed 05/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 39 of 39\n(4) A plan to obtain a sufficient number or type of masks so that inmates do not\nneed to wear them for more than their intended duration or so that inmates may be able\nto clean them.\n(5) A policy providing for increased monitoring of medically vulnerable inmates\nfor symptoms of COVID-19.\nIt is further\nORDERED that, on or before May 21, 2020, at 5:00 p.m., defendant is ordered\nto file a report with the Court, identifying what new policies have been instituted in\naccordance with this order.  Defendant shall explain in such report what steps the Jail\nhas taken to acquire an adequate mask supply for inmates housed in the Jail.  It is\nfurther\nORDERED that this order will expire in 90 days unless extended by the Court.  It\nis further\nORDERED that, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c), plaintiffs will not be required\nto post a bond for the reasons discussed in this order.  It is further\nORDERED that plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction is otherwise denied. \nDATED May 11, 2020.\nBY THE COURT:\n                                                         \nPHILIP A.

You are likely reading this Complaint from self-isolation in your home. Now \nimagine if someone sick with COVID-19 came into that home and then sealed the doors and \nwindows behind them. That is what the Weld County Jail has just done to hundreds of human \nbeings currently detained there, where COVID-19 is confirmed, physical distancing is impossible, \nand yet no one detained can leave.  \n1\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 7   Filed 04/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 30\n2. We are in the midst of the most significant pandemic in generations.1 A highly \ncontagious and deadly virus called coronavirus has swept the globe. While no one is safe from \ntransmission of the virus, jails, by their very nature, are especially prone to being epicenters of \ndisease.  This is true not only because of crowded conditions in the jail and limited access to \nhygiene products and medical care, but also because jails disproportionately house people who are \nat high-risk of serious illness or death if they contract the virus.  This case seeks safety for high-\nrisk inmates housed in the Weld County Jail, a Colorado jail that has willfully disregarded public \nhealth guidelines and, in doing so, has put incarcerated people, correctional staff and the public at \ngrave risk.  COVID-19 is spreading like wildfire through the Weld County Jail, and it appears that \nonly immediate action by this Court will change the deadly course of events unfolding there. \n3. COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory disease that kills between 1 and 6% \nof those infected: at least ten times more than the common flu that kills thousands a year.2 The \nWorld Health Organization estimates that one in five people who become infected require \nhospitalization.3 As of March 26, 2020, the United States led the world in confirmed cases of \nCOVID-19.4 The virus is spreading exponentially: as of April 2, 2020, there are more than 210,000 \n1 John M.

There is no vaccine or cure for COVID-19.  According to public health experts, the \nonly course of action to slow and prevent transmission, primarily through a practice known as \n“social distancing,” which requires all people to stay at least six feet away from all other people.8\nIndeed, the only assured way to curb the pandemic is through dramatically reducing contact for \nall.9 Consequently, every American institution—from schools10 to places of worship,11 from \nbusinesses12 to legislatures13—has been exhorted to reduce the number of people in close quarters, \nif not empty entirely. These imperatives apply with special force to jails, where inmates and staff \n5 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Coronavirus Cases in the U.S.,available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html;see also Brittany\nShammas, et al., Trump says Quarantine for New York Area “Will not be Necessary;” U.S. \nCoronavirus-related Deaths Double in Two Days, Wash.

To comply with public health guidelines, jailers must ensure that inmates be \nallowed to eat, cook, sleep, use the toilet and socialize while maintaining 6 feet distance from all \nothers.  Failure to take these actions will have serious consequences. For example, at the peak of \nthe outbreak in Wuhan, China —the province where COVID-19 originated—over half of all \nreported COVID-19 cases were incarcerated people. On Rikers Island, the rate of infection among \nincarcerated people is over seven times the rate of infection in New York City generally, and 25 \ntimes higher than the rate in Wuhan, China.14\n6. Here in Colorado, prior to the pandemic, almost all jails housed incarcerated people \nin conditions that made physical distancing impossible, with prisoners eating, sleeping and using \nthe toilet within a few feet of one another.  However, based on guidance from the Centers for \nDisease Control (CDC), the Colorado Department of Public Health and Education (CDPHE), and \nGovernor Jared Polis, several Colorado jails have substantially decreased their jail population in \nan effort to make physical distancing possible and to protect high-risk inmates.15\n7. The Weld County Jail, however, is far behind other Colorado counties in efforts to \nsafely lower the jail population, and current conditions in the Weld County Jail pose a serious, \nobvious, and emergent health and safety risk to inmates, staff and the public.  Many inmates are \nhoused at least 3-4 to a small cell, with some cells housing as many as 9 inmates.  Until just days \nago, inmates ate and recreated shoulder-to-shoulder, with no efforts at physical distancing, even \nas several inmates showed symptoms consistent with COVID-19.  Now, with recently confirmed \n15 https://www.denverpost.com/2020/04/01/colorado-jails-inmate-release-coronavirus-covid/\n4\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 7   Filed 04/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 30\ncases, inmates are on lockdown 23 hours per day, with some non-symptomatic inmates locked in \ncells with sick inmates.  Only some (but not all) very sick patients are quarantined, and the rest are \nleft in packed cells to spread the virus to others. \n8. Rather than taking proactive measures at the start of this crisis to comply with \npublic health guidance, Weld County Sheriff Steven Reams has openly eschewed the seriousness \nof the pandemic and ignored the science and data underlying public health experts’ concerns \nregarding dangerous spread of the virus within overcrowded jails.  Not only has Sheriff Reams \nrefused to make any meaningful efforts to depopulate his jail to allow physical distancing, he also \ndiscouraged local district attorneys and judges from making efforts to decrease the Weld County \njail population, assuring them he has things under control in his jail and was ready to manage \nCOVID-19.\n9. Given Sheriff Reams’ deliberately indifferent approach to this crisis, it should come \nas no surprise that COVID-19 is quickly spreading within Weld County Jail.  The first confirmed \ncases occurred by around April 1 (and included a Weld County inmate and two Weld County \nsheriffs’ deputies), and there now at least four confirmed cases among sheriff’s deputies, multiple \nconfirmed inmate cases, and dozens more symptomatic inmates. \n10. Sheriff Reams’ failure to act to protect people who live and work in his jail is \nparticularly egregious given the current state of affairs in Weld County. Weld County is a hot spot \nfor the COVID-19 outbreak in Colorado, with the fourth highest number of COVID-19 infections \nin the state and the second highest number of deaths.16\n16 See https://covid19.colorado.gov/case-data.\n5\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 7   Filed 04/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 30\n11. Jails  are  not  hermetically  sealed—quite  the  opposite.    Jail  populations  shift \nsignificantly  each  day  as  people  are  arrested  and  released.    The  people  who  go  in—from \ncorrectional and medical staff, to those detained prior to trial, to those serving short sentences—\ntypically come out in very short order.  In Colorado, on average 586 people are released from jail \ncustody every day, and about 30 people are released from Weld County Jail every day.17  Failing \nto prevent and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 endangers not only those within the institution, \nbut the entire community. Hence, immediate and aggressive action to allow incarcerated persons \nand correctional staff to practice physical distancing is an essential mitigation effort that the Weld \nCounty Jail must undertake to comport with public health guidance and to prevent a catastrophic \noutbreak at the facility.\n12. Absent immediate intervention from this Court to align the operation of Weld \nCounty Jail with public health principles, devastating, and in many cases deadly, irreparable harm \nwill befall incarcerated persons, jail staff, and the community.18 The outbreaks in detention \nfacilities around the country, many with more resources, space, and sophisticated health delivery \nsystems than the Weld County Jail,19 prove the need for immediate and significant reductions in \npopulation. Case-by-case review is no match for exponential spread of the disease.

Accordingly, the named Plaintiffs—on their own behalf and for the class of high-\nrisk persons they represent who are incarcerated at the Weld County Jail—bring this action and \nrequest that the Weld County Jail immediately comply with public health principles designed to \nminimize the risk of COVID-19 becoming even more widespread at the jail. \nI. JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n14. Plaintiffs bring this class action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for relief from both \ndetention and conditions of confinement that violate their Eighth and/or Fourteenth Amendment \nrights under the United States Constitution. \n15. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over these claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1331.\n16. Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because the Defendant resides \nin this district and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims \noccurred in this district. \nII. PARTIES \n17. Plaintiff Thomas Carranza is detained pretrial in Weld County jail. He is held on a \n$1,000 bond and facing a misdemeanor charge. He is unable to pay a financial condition of bond. \nMr. Carranza is 55 years old, and he suffers from asthma. He has been hospitalized for acute \n20 See, e.g., Memorandum and Order, Thakker v.

In  the  past,  he  was  a  smoker,  making  his  respiratory  condition  more \nvulnerable. Mr. Carranza has been advised by medical providers that he has high blood pressure \nbut has not been properly diagnosed. Mr. Carranza is also currently suffering from an undiagnosed \nintestinal condition causing internal bleeding and blood in his stool. Medical staff in the jail have \nnot provided a diagnosis or treatment for this condition. As a result of his medical conditions, Mr. \nCarranza is particularly vulnerable to suffering severe effects from COVID. Physical distancing is \ncritical for him. Should Mr. Carranza be released from jail, he would practice physical distancing. \n18. Plaintiff Jesus Martinez is held pretrial in Weld county jail on a $10,000 bond and \na parole hold. Mr. Martinez is 33 years old and suffers from multiple chronic medical conditions. \nHe is diabetic, he has asthma and experiences shortness of breath, he has high blood pressure, and \nhe  is  overweight.  Mr.  Martinez  also  had  a  corneal  transplant  in  one  eye  and  is  currently \nexperiencing discomfort and potential complications relating to this condition. As a result of his \nmedical conditions, Mr. Martinez is particularly vulnerable to suffering severe effects from \nCOVID. Physical distancing is critical for him. Should Mr. Martinez be released from jail, he \nwould practice physical distancing. \n19. Plaintiff Richard Barnum is 54 years old and has been held pretrial at the Weld \nCounty Jail since October 2019.  Mr. Barnum intends to take his pending criminal case to trial but \ncannot afford the $25,000 bond to be released in the meantime.  Mr. Barnum is disabled, receives \nsocial security disability benefits, and is eligible for Medicare.  Mr. Barnum has untreated Hepatitis \nC. Prior to his arrest, Mr. Barnum was eligible for and working to obtain treatment for Hepatitis \nC.  If he is released, he would be able to continue with that process and obtain treatment through \nMedicare. About five years ago, Mr. Barnum suffered major kidney failure due to stage three \nkidney disease.  He spent one month in the hospital, which included dialysis treatment.  He \n8\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 7   Filed 04/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 30\ncontinues to regularly see a doctor in Loveland CO in order to monitor his kidney issues.  Mr. \nBarnum is a smoker who also has hypertension, PTSD and depression. As a result of his medical \nconditions, Mr. Barnum is particularly vulnerable to suffering severe effects from COVID. \nPhysical distancing is critical for him. Mr. Barnum has a place to stay and to practice physical \ndistancing if he is released from the jail. Mr. Barnum’s next court date is July 1, 2020.  If nothing \nchanges, he will remain in Weld County jail until at least that time.  \n20. Plaintiff Thomas Lewis is 60 years old and has been held at the Weld County jail \nsince January 3, 2020.  He was arrested on January 3, 2020 and his original bond was $8000.  That \nbond was recently reduced to $1500, which he also cannot afford to post.  Mr. Lewis’ next court \nappearance is May 20. Thus, with no intervention, he will be in the Weld County Jail until at least \nthat time.  Mr. Lewis suffers from vitiligo, which is an immune deficiency disease.  As a result of \nhis age and medical condition, Mr. Lewis is particularly vulnerable to suffering severe effects from \nCOVID.  Physical distancing is critical for him.  Should Mr. Lewis be released from jail, he would \npractice physical distancing. \n21. Plaintiff Michael Ward is 31 years old, and suffers from high blood pressure, \narthritis, fibromyalgia, and a compromised immune system from having previously contracted \nWest Nile virus. Mr. Ward is held pretrial at the Weld County Jail on a $10,000 bond for charges \nrelating to a felony motor vehicle theft and several other misdemeanor charges. Mr. Ward is \npresumed innocent and is not convicted of any crime. As a result of his medical conditions, Mr. \nWard is particularly vulnerable to suffering severe effects from COVID. Physical distancing is \ncritical for him. Should Mr. Ward be released from jail, he would practice physical distancing. \n9\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 7   Filed 04/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 30\n22. Because Plaintiffs Carranza, Martinez, Barnum, Lewis, and Ward are all being held \npretrial, they have not been convicted of the alleged offense(s) for which they are being detained \nin the jail and are presumed innocent. \n23. Plaintiff Colby Propes has pled guilty and is awaiting sentencing.  He is being held \non a $30,000 bond at the Weld County Jail and is unlikely to be released from the jail at any \nrelevant time. Mr. Propes is 44 years old and has a long history of smoking as well as substance \nabuse disorders. As a result of his medical conditions and history of smoking, Mr. Propes is \nparticularly vulnerable to suffering severe effects from COVID. Physical distancing is critical for \nhim. Should Mr. Ward be released from jail, he would practice physical distancing. \n24. Plaintiff Chad Hunter is 46 years old and serving a 90-day jail sentence in Weld \nCounty Jail, after which he will be released on two years of probation. Mr. Hunter expects to be \nreleased on April 26, 2020. Mr. Hunter is hypoglycemic, he has a long history as a smoker, and he \nhas a history of a substance abuse disorder. As a result of his medical conditions, Mr. Hunter is \nparticularly vulnerable to suffering severe effects from COVID. Physical distancing is critical for \nhim. Should Mr. Hunter be released from jail, he would practice physical distancing. \n25. Defendant Sheriff Steven Reams and his agents currently have immediate custody \nover the Plaintiffs and all other putative class members. Defendant Reams is a final policymaker \nfor Weld County with respect to the customs, policies, and practices of its jail. All of Defendant \nReams’ actions and inactions at issue herein occurred under color of state law. \nIII. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nCOVID-19 Poses a Significant Risk of Illness, Injury, or Death  \n10\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 7   Filed 04/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 30\n26. The novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has led to a global pandemic.21 As of \nApril 2, 2020, there were more than 210,000 confirmed cases in the United States alone and more \nthan 4,500 deaths.22 Projections indicate that as many as 240,000 people in the U.S. will die from \nCOVID-19, accounting for existing interventions.23\n27. The virus is known to spread from person to person through respiratory droplets, \nclose personal contact, fecal matter, and from contact with contaminated surfaces and objects.24\nThere is no vaccine against COVID-19, and there is no known medication to prevent or treat \ninfection.25 Physical distancing—deliberately keeping at least six feet of space between persons to \navoid spreading illness26—and a vigilant hygiene regimen, including washing hands frequently \nand thoroughly with soap and water, are the only known effective measures for protecting against \ntransmission of COVID-19.27  Because the coronavirus spreads among people who do not show \nsymptoms, staying away from people is the best way to prevent contraction.

Once contracted, COVID-19 can cause severe damage to lung tissue, including a \npermanent loss of respiratory capacity, and it can damage tissues in other vital organs, such as the \nheart and liver.28\n29. People over the age of fifty face a greater risk of serious illness or death from \nCOVID-19.29 In a February 29, 2020 preliminary report, individuals age 50-59 had an overall \nmortality rate of 1.3%; 60-69-year-olds had an overall 3.6% mortality rate, and those 70-79 years \nold had an 8% mortality rate.30\n30.

In many people, COVID-19 causes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. However, \nfor people over the age of fifty or with medical conditions that increase the risk of serious COVID-\n19 infection, shortness of breath can be severe.33 Most people in higher risk categories who develop \nserious illness will need advanced support. This requires highly specialized equipment like \nventilators that are in limited supply, and an entire team of care providers, including 1:1 or 1:2 \nnurse to patient ratios, respiratory therapists, and intensive care physicians.34\n32. In serious cases, COVID-19 causes acute respiratory disease syndrome, which is \nlife-threatening: those who receive ideal medical care with ARDS have a 30% mortality rate.35\nEven  in  non-ARDS  cases,  COVID-19  can  severely  damage  lung  tissue,  which  requires  an \nextensive period of rehabilitation, and in some cases, cause permanent loss of breathing capacity.36\nCOVID-19  may  also  target  the  heart,  causing  a  medical  condition  called  myocarditis,  or \ninflammation of the heart muscle. Myocarditis can reduce the heart’s ability to pump.37 This \nreduction can lead to rapid or abnormal heart rhythms in the short term, and long-term heart failure \nthat limits exercise tolerance and the ability to work. \n32 Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), World \nHealth Organization \n(Feb. 28, 2020), at 12, https://cutt.ly/xtEokCt (finding fatality rates for patients with COVID-19 \nand co-morbid conditions to be: “13.2% for those with cardiovascular disease, 9.2% for diabetes, \n8.4% for hypertension, 8.0% for chronic respiratory disease, and 7.6% for cancer”). \n33 Golob Dec, supra note 27 at ¶ 3; Zhao, supra note 29. \n34 Golob Dec., supra note 27 at ¶ 6. \n35 Letter from Faculty at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, School of Nursing, and Bloomberg \nSchool of Public Health to Hon.

COVID-19 can also trigger an over-response of the immune system and result in \nwidespread damage to other organs, including permanent injury to the kidneys and neurologic \ninjury.38\n34. These complications can manifest at an alarming pace. Patients can show the first \nsymptoms of infection in as little as two days after exposure, and their condition can seriously \ndeteriorate in as little as five days or sooner.39\n35. Even some younger and healthier people who contract COVID-19 may require \nsupportive care, which includes supplemental oxygen, positive pressure ventilation, and in extreme \ncases, extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation.40\n36. The need for care, including intensive care, and the likelihood of death, is much \nhigher from COVID-19 infection than from influenza.41 According to recent estimates, the fatality \nrate of people infected with COVID-19 is about ten times higher than a severe seasonal influenza, \neven in advanced countries with highly effective health care systems.42 For people in the highest \nrisk populations, the fatality rate of COVID-19 infection is about 15 percent.43\n37.

Beyond the general public health presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, persons \nincarcerated in jails face a particularly acute threat of illness, permanent injury, and death.  \nPersons Incarcerated in Jails Face Grave and Immediate Danger Due to COVID-19. \n37. People in congregate environments, which are places where people live, eat, and \nsleep in close proximity, face increased danger of contracting COVID-19, as already evidenced by \nthe rapid spread of the virus in cruise ships45 and nursing homes.46 It is virtually impossible for \npeople who are confined in prisons, jails, and detention centers to engage in the necessary physical \ndistancing and hygiene required to mitigate the risk of transmission. This is demonstrated by \ndramatic outbreaks in the Cook County Jail47 and Rikers Island in New York City, where the \ntransmission rate for COVID-19 is estimated to be the highest in the world.48\n38. Correctional settings further increase the risk of contracting COVID-19 due to the \nhigh numbers of people with chronic, often untreated, illnesses housed in a setting with minimal \nlevels of sanitation, limited access to personal hygiene, limited access to medical care, presence of \nmany high-contact non-porous surfaces, and no possibility of staying at a distance from others.49\n45 The CDC is currently recommending that travelers defer cruise ship travel worldwide. “Cruise \nship passengers are at increased risk of person-to-person spread of infectious diseases, including \nCOVID-19.” COVID-19 and Cruise Ship Travel, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nhttps://cutt.ly/7tEEQvT. \n46 The CDC notes that long-term care facilities and nursing homes pose a particular risk because \nof “their congregate nature” and the residents served.

Correctional facilities house large groups of people together, and move people in \ngroups to eat, recreate, and go to court.50 They frequently have insufficient medical care for the \npopulation even outside times of crisis.51 Hot water, soap, and paper towels are often in limited \nsupply. Incarcerated people, rather than professional cleaners, are responsible for cleaning the \nfacilities52 and often are not given appropriate supplies.\n40.

Because of the severity of the threat posed by COVID-19, and its potential to \nrapidly spread throughout a correctional setting, public health experts recommend the rapid release \nfrom custody of people most vulnerable to COVID-19.63 Release protects the people with the \ngreatest vulnerability to COVID-19 from transmission of the virus, and also allows for greater risk \nmitigation for people held or working in a jail and the broader community.64 Release also reduces \nthe  burden  on  the  region’s  health  care  infrastructure  by  reducing  the  likelihood  that  an \noverwhelming number of people will become seriously ill from COVID-19 at the same time.

Public health guidance put all sheriffs on notice of the dire risk of the spread of \nCOVID-19 through jails without substantial changes to the jail environment.  Additionally, on \nMarch  26,  2020,  Sheriff  Reams  received  a  letter  from  the  ACLU  providing  public  health \ninformation regarding the dangers of the spread of the virus in jails, as well as the societal and \nconstitutional obligation of jailers to allow prisoners, and particularly those in the high risk \npopulation, to practice physical distancing at all times in the jails.  Attached to the ACLU letter \nwas a letter from infectious disease expert at University of Colorado Anschutz which made clear \nthat, to protect inmates, they must be housed in a manner that allows them to sleep, socialize and \neat while maintain a six foot distance from others.  Dr. Franco-Paredes explained: \nTo contain the spread of the disease, infection prevention protocols must be \nmeticulously  followed.  These  infection  prevention  protocols  include  “social \ndistancing” measures, where individuals maintain a distance of at least six feet \nfrom each other and frequent hand-washing and other good hygiene practices. . . . \nIn a carceral setting, these protocols would require, for example, that individuals \nsleep one person per cell, rather than in bunk beds. \n44. Despite being aware of likely COVID-19 infection in the jail, Defendant Reams \nfailed to act promptly and took almost no precautionary measures for weeks after COVID-19 was \nspreading through Colorado. As a result of these failures, at least one inmate and f staff tested \npositive for Covid-19 by no later than April 1, 2020. The infected inmate had been at the jail for \nover a year; so, it is likely that there is internal spread within the jail.  More recent reports indicate \nthat multiple inmates and at least four deputies have tested positive with dozens more inmates \n65 Available athttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1q7wkqi-NeU5nmuFcBQwn-6CryTKdYJ5P/view\n(“Reducing the numbers of those arrested or incarcerated is vital to our efforts to limit and \nprevent the spread of COVID-19 in our communities, detention centers and prisons.”). \n18\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 7   Filed 04/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of 30\nshowing symptoms consistent with COVID-19.  The infection is now almost certainly widespread \nin the Weld County Jail.\n45. Weld County is the sixth most populous jail in Colorado. Of the ten most populous \nColorado jails, Weld County Jail stands out as having the lowest depopulation rate since the \nstart of the COVID-19 crisis and the highest jail occupancy rate.\n46. Unlike many other Colorado sheriffs, Defendant Sheriff Reams has refused to take \nthe public health risk or data seriously. \n47. Defendant  Reams  has  scoffed  at  Gubernatorial  guidance  and  actions  by  the \nDepartment of Corrections to decarcerate.66 He has even posted a “Get out of Jail Free Card” from \nthe child’s board game Monopoly to underscore his disagreement with actions to depopulate jails \nin order to allow physical distancing.67 Defendant Reams has further boasted that, despite all public \nhealth recommendations to the contrary, he can manage the virus without releasing inmates.68\n48. Defendant Reams’ deliberate indifference to the reality of this crisis is particularly \nalarming given the current state of affairs in Weld County. Weld County is a hot spot for the \nCOVID-19 outbreak in Colorado. As of April 6, 2020, it has the fourth highest number of \ninfections and the fifth highest concentration of infections by population compared to all other \n66 See, e.g., https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2020/03/weld-sheriff-id-rather-take-my-risk-with-\nthe-virus-than-socialism/22199/.\n67 Seehttps://www.facebook.com/SteveReamsForWeldCountySheriff/posts/1524469844396739\n68 Id. (“I haven’t closed the Weld County Jail nor have I started releasing prisoners because of \nthe Covid 19 virus; and I don’t intend to do so. The Weld County Jail has very competent and \neffective medical staff to handle this crisis and we will work closely with the Weld County \nHealth Department to get through these tough times if the need arises.”).\n19\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 7   Filed 04/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of 30\ncounties.69 With 24 COVID-19 related deaths as of April 6, Weld County has the second \nhighest number of deaths compared to any other county in the state, surpassing Denver.70\n49. The failure to act to substantially reduce the Weld County Jail inmate population is \nalarming given the county-wide infection rate and death rate. Weld County correctional staff work \nmostly in the Weld County, daily interacting with inmates in a crowded environment and then \nreturning home to their families. And, of course, Weld County inmates are commonly released to \nthe community, with an average of about 30 released inmates per day. There is no line, thin or \notherwise, between the health of Weld County inmates, the health of Weld County correctional \nstaff, and the health of Weld County as a whole. \n50. Defendant Reams has demonstrated throughout this crisis an unwillingness or \ninability to safely care for people in his custody. For weeks, Defendant Reams cavalierly refused \nto take any apparent precautions whatsoever within the facility. No testing for COVID-19 of \npeople suffering from apparent COVID-19 symptoms occurred, no physical distancing occurred, \nand inadequate sanitation was widespread.\n51. Recently, on or about April 1—and only after the outbreak of COVID-19 in the \nfacility evidenced by the positive tests—Defendant Reams suddenly implemented a 23-hour a day \nlockdown of detainees and inmates in their cells, with only 1 hour per day out. This Draconian \nmeasure not only comes too little too late, the crowded cells and shared spaces make it impossible \nto safely house people without spreading disease. \n52. Currently, people are still held in pods of 40 or more individuals, with at least 3-4 \npeople to a cell (and in some cases as many as 9 in a cell). Within each cell, the numerous people \n69 https://covid19.colorado.gov/case-data \n70 Id.\n20\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 7   Filed 04/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of 30\nhoused therein cannot maintain adequate physical distance and will inevitably infect each other \nwith COVID-19. Moreover, during the 1 hour per day they are permitted out, two cells are let out \nat a time, for up to 12 (sometimes more) people congregating in a common area. Adequate \ndistancing  and  sanitation  remain  impossible.  Additionally,  throughout  the  day,  even  those \nindividuals on lockdown are permitted to leave their cells to use the shared toilet, go to medical, \nuse the phones, and other limited purposes. Thus, at any given time in the common area 15 or more \npeople still congregate, stand and walk in close proximity, touch the same surfaces, and cannot \nmaintain adequate distance.  \n53. A typical pod shares about 4 toilets total, 2 on each floor of the pod. So, for a pod \nof 40-50 men, all 40-50 of them use 4 toilets to defecate, one after another throughout the day. \nThey use the same sink and bathroom area, touch the same surfaces, use the same hand railings, \nsit on the same toilets, touch the same dispensers, and pass each other in close proximity. Often, \nthey run out of soap and are unable even to wash their hands after using the toilet. Because COVID-\n19 spreads through fecal matter as well as saliva, these crowded conditions and shared spaces make \nit impossible for inmates to maintain safe sanitation or distancing.  The design and operation of \nthe jail do not allow for physical distancing and, in fact, fail to meet the public health guidelines \nset by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Colorado Department of Public Health and \nEducation (CDPHE).\n54. In pods of 40-60 individuals, as many as half are displaying potential COVID-19 \nsymptoms, yet very few have been tested for the virus. Meanwhile, multiple sick people have \ntested negative for the flu, even more strongly suggesting they may be infected with COVID-19.\n55. Alarmingly, jail officials are not removing sick people out of the communal pods \nunless they have at least 4 symptoms. In at least the A Pod, jail personnel wrote on a poster that \n21\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 7   Filed 04/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 22 of 30\nyou have to have coughing, fever, sore throat, etc. (at least 4 symptoms) to be pulled out of the \npod and presumably quarantined.\n56. Also alarming, in the kitchen, inmate workers have been displaying symptoms \nconsistent with COVID-19. Given that the jail feeds approximately 600 people held in custody, \nsick kitchen workers handling food and distributing trays means the entire facility may be exposed \nand infected. Yet, none of the inmates who work in the kitchen are even being provided masks.\n57. Inmates have requested masks but the jail has refused to provide them. Moreover, \nwhen some inmates have worn homemade masks or put towels around their face in an attempt to \nprotect themselves, jail staff have instructed them to stop and remove the masks. The jail is not \nonly failing to provide masks, it is actively preventing people from wearing them or taking other \nprecautions.  \n58. Furthermore, the jail is failing to adequately educate inmates or to provide access \nto up to date information about COVID-19, making precautions even more difficult to achieve. \nThe jail has failed to educate inmates on appropriate sanitation precautions, physical distancing, \nthe importance of wearing masks (which, as alleged above, it is in fact preventing inmates from \nwearing), how the virus spreads, how it affects the body, or other basic medical information that \nis necessary for the community within the jail to protect itself. The jail has also sought to cut off \ninmate access to public news reports about COVID-19. Inmates have been left effectively in the \ndark as Defendant Reams and the jail have failed to protect them.\n59. Additionally, the jail is not taking adequate precautions to protect vulnerable people \nor to quarantine people with symptoms. For instance, a detainee who was recently booked into the \njail has moderate to severe asthma, which places him at higher risk of fatality if he were to contract \nthe virus. This individual was held in Weld County Jail booking and not given his asthma \n22\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 7   Filed 04/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 23 of 30\nmedication. While held in booking without his medication, he suffered an asthma attack. His \ncellmates worked to try to keep him calm throughout this asthma attack as it took a very long time \nfor medical personnel to arrive. When they finally arrived, the detainee told them that in addition \nto his asthma attack he was also coughing. In response, the medical personnel in the Jail advised \nhim that he “probably just had a cold” and took no further steps to attempt to isolate him from the \ngeneral jail population or to determine if he might have the COVID-19 virus. \n60. The jail has failed to adequately protect any of the named Plaintiffs, including but \nfar from limited to physical distancing at all times. \n61. Therefore,  the  jail  is,  with  deliberate  indifference,  failing  to  take  adequate \nprecautions to avoid the spread of potential COVID-19 in the facility, and the operation of the jail. \nThe jail is instead deliberately indifferently facilitating the spread of the disease. In fact, it is hard \nto envision more ideal conditions for the spread of COVID-19. Of particular concern, some of the \nsick individuals, as well as other not yet visibly ill inmates, fall into the category of high-risk of \ncritical illness and mortality from COVID-19 according to CDC guidelines. \n62. The Weld County Jail must respond to and manage the continued risk of harm \nposed by the COVID-19 outbreak by following CDC71 and other public health guidelines. This \nrequires, among other things: (a) physically distancing all inmates from one another and staff \nwithin the Weld County Jail, which necessitates at least six feet of distance between individuals at \nall times; (b) on a daily basis, thoroughly and professionally disinfecting and sanitizing the Weld \nCounty Jail; (c) providing hygiene supplies, including supplies to wash hands and disinfect \n71 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus \nDisease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities,\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-\ncorrectional-detention.html.\n23\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 7   Filed 04/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 24 of 30\ncommon areas, to inmates at all times and free of charge; (d) providing personal protective \nequipment, including but not limited to masks, to all staff members and inmates; (e) taking \nparticularly heightened precautions with respect to food handling and delivery, such as ensuring \nthat people who come into contact with food are not displaying any potential symptoms of COVID-\n19, have not recently been in contact with people displaying potential symptoms of COVID-19, \nand people who come into contact with food wear appropriate personal protection at all times when \nin contact with food (including but not limited to appropriate masks and gloves); (f) implementing \nappropriate policies and protocols to identify inmates who are possibly carrying COVID-19 and \nquarantine  those  inmates  from  other  individuals;  and  (g)  providing  accurate,  up-to-date \neducational and informational materials regarding sanitation and prevention of COVID-19, the \nstatus of how COVID-19 is affecting the facility including the number of infected inmates and \nstaff, and daily access to news reports regarding COVID-19. \n63.

As explained more fully in Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, Plaintiffs seek \ncertification of the following class of individuals: \nAll current and future persons held at the Weld County Jail who are at high risk of \ncomplications from COVID-19 because:   \n(a) they are age 55 or older; or\n(b) they have the following chronic health conditions:  cancer; autoimmune \ndisease  (including  lupus,  rheumatoid  arthritis,  psoriasis,  Sjogren’s, \nCrohn’s);  chronic  lung  disease  (including  asthma,  chronic  obstructive \n24\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 7   Filed 04/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 25 of 30\npulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or other \nchronic  conditions  associated  with  impaired  lung  function);  history  of \ncardiovascular disease; chronic arthritis; chronic liver or kidney disease; \ndiabetes;  hypertension; heart failure; HIV; on chronic steroids or other \nimmunosuppressant medications for chronic conditions;  \n(c) they have history of smoking or other substance abuse disorders; or \n(d) they are pregnant. \n66. Class certification is proper under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) if: (1) the \nclass is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or \nfact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the \nclaims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of the class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). This is further explained in Plaintiffs’ motion for \nclass certification. \n67. In addition, the proposed class must be certifiable under one of the three sub-\nprovisions of Rule 23(b). Here, Plaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(2), because the party \nopposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby \nmaking appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the \nclass as a whole.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). This is further explained in Plaintiffs’ motion for class \ncertification. \nV. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nUnconstitutional Conditions of Confinement in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nPlaintiffs Carranza, Martinez, Barnum, Lewis, Ward and the Class They Represent \n68. Under the Fourteenth Amendment, corrections officials are required to provide for \nthe reasonable health and safety of persons in pretrial custody. Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, \n25\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 7   Filed 04/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 26 of 30\n315–16, 324 (1982) (the state has an “unquestioned duty to provide adequate . . . medical care” for \ndetained persons).\n69. As part of the right, the government must provide incarcerated persons with \nreasonable safety and address serious medical needs that arise in jail to at least the same degree of \npersons in custody subsequent to a conviction. Deliberate indifference to the serious risk COVID-\n19 poses to Plaintiffs and members of the Class violates this right. \n70. The Weld County Jail has unconstitutionally failed to comply with public health \nguidelines to prevent or manage an outbreak of COVID-19 and unconstitutionally failed to provide \nfor the safety of the individually named Plaintiffs and the Class. Defendant’s actions and inactions \nresult in the confinement of these Plaintiffs and Class members people in a jail where their rights \nto reasonably safe conditions of confinement and adequate medical care are being violated. \n71. Accordingly, Defendant Reams, as a supervisor, direct participant, and policy \nmaker for Weld County has violated the rights of Plaintiffs and the Class under the Fourteenth \nAmendment.\nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nUnconstitutional Conditions of Confinement in Violation of the Eighth Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution \n42 U.S.C. § 1983\nPlaintiffs Propes, Hunter, and the Class They Represent \n72. Under the Eighth Amendment, persons in carceral custody have a right to be free \nfrom cruel and unusual punishment. As part of the right, the government must provide incarcerated \npersons with reasonable safety and address serious medical needs that arise in jail. See, e.g., \nEstelle, 429 U.S. at 104; DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 200. Deliberate indifference to the serious risk \nCOVID-19 poses to Plaintiffs and the members of Class infringes on the protection from cruel and \n26\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 7   Filed 04/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 27 of 30\nunusual punishment. Defendant violates this right by subjecting members of the Class and \nPlaintiffs Propes and Hunter to conditions of confinement that do not ensure their safety and health. \n73. The Weld County Jail has unconstitutionally failed to comply with public health \nguidelines to prevent or manage an outbreak of COVID-19 and unconstitutionally failed to provide \nfor the safety of Plaintiff Propes, Hunter, and the Class. Defendant’s actions and inactions result \nin the confinement of these Plaintiffs and the Class in a jail where their rights to reasonably safe \nconditions of confinement and adequate medical care are being violated. \n74. Accordingly, Defendant Reams, as a supervisor, direct participant, and policy \nmaker for Weld County has violated the rights of Plaintiffs and the Class under the Eighth \nAmendment.\nVI. REQUEST FOR RELIEF \n75. Plaintiffs, for themselves and for the members of the proposed Class, respectfully \nrequest that the Court order the following: \n1. Certification of this action as a Class Action; \n2. A temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and/or permanent injunction \nrequiring Defendant to: \na. Physically distance all inmates from one another and staff within the Weld \nCounty Jail, which necessitates at least six feet of distance between individuals at \nall times;\nb. On a daily basis, thoroughly and professionally disinfect and sanitize the Weld \nCounty Jail; \nc. Provide hygiene supplies, including supplies to wash hands and disinfect common \nareas, to inmates at all times and free of charge; \n27\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 7   Filed 04/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 28 of 30\nd. Provide personal protective equipment, including but not limited to masks, to all \nstaff members and inmates; \ne. Take particularly heightened precautions with respect to food handling and \ndelivery, such as ensuring that people who come into contact with food are not \ndisplaying any potential symptoms of COVID-19, have not recently been in \ncontact with people displaying potential symptoms of COVID-19, and people \nwho come into contact with food wear appropriate personal protection at all times \nwhen in contact with food (including but not limited to appropriate masks and \ngloves);\nf. Implement appropriate policies and protocols to identify inmates who are possibly \ncarrying COVID-19 and quarantine those inmates from other individuals; and \ng. provide accurate, up-to-date educational and informational materials regarding \nsanitation and prevention of COVID-19, the status of how COVID-19 is affecting \nthe facility including the number of infected inmates and staff, and daily access to \nnews reports regarding COVID-19. \n3. A declaration that jail’s policies violate the Fourteenth Amendment rights to reasonable \nsafety and to be free from punishment prior to conviction; \n4. A declaration that jail’s policies violate the Eighth Amendment right against cruel and \nunusual punishment; \n5. An award of Plaintiffs’ attorney fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. sec. 1988 and other \napplicable law; and \n6. Any further relief this Court deems appropriate. \nDated: April 7, 2020        \n28\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 7   Filed 04/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 29 of 30\n          Respectfully submitted, \ns/ Andy McNulty     \nAndy McNulty\nMichael P.

CARLOS FRANCO-PAREDES \n \n \n  This declaration supplements my declaration of April 24, 2020.  I reviewed the following \nadditional case documents related to this declaration: Defendant’s Notice of Complete \nCompliance with the Court’s Preliminary Injunction Order and Exhibits F, F-1, F-2, F-3, F-4, F-\n5 and H.  Based on my review of these documents, together with the jail inspections and \ndocuments relied upon for my April 24 declaration, it is my opinion that certain aspects of the \ncompliance plan for Weld County Jail (WCJ) will place medically vulnerable inmates at a \nsubstantial risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19.  Of great concern, some of WCJ’s \nplan has the potential to increase the risk of infection by medically vulnerable inmates compared \nto the policies and procedures in place during my last inspection of the WCJ on April 24.   \nBackground Information \n1.  Widespread testing is now available in Colorado.  It is my opinion that if WCJ \nwished to perform universal testing given its current jail population of less than 500 inmates, it \ncould acquire those tests – likely free – by requesting them from the Colorado Department of \nPublic Health and Environment (CDPHE). I have contacted colleagues at CDPHE. Weld County \nPublic Health can request swabs and testing would be performed at the State PH Lab.  The \ncontact person is Matt Bauer who is the regional epidemiologist at Weld County Public Health \nDepartment and who can coordinate ordering supplies. \n \n2.  The reported numbers of individuals with the virus in the Weld County Jail \nis likely a substantial undercount.  As I noted in my April 24 declaration, the Weld County Jail \nappeared to be focusing its testing only on symptomatic inmates and the jail was not testing \nmildly symptomatic inmates, inmates who had been in contact with positive inmates or staff, or \nmedically vulnerable inmates.  Based on the recent data provided by WCJ, it appears that – \ndespite the availability of widespread testing in Colorado – WCJ’s testing procedures remain \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 63-1   Filed 05/27/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 6\nunchanged.  As of April 30, WCJ reported that it had tested 23 inmates for COVID-19, and that \n10 of those inmates (43% percent) had tested positive.  There were still seven inmates in custody \nat the time who had tested positive for the virus.  During my April 24 inspection, I spoke with \nseveral inmates who had symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but who had not been tested and \nwho were housed in small cells with other inmates where social distancing was not possible.  \nAccording to the WCJ’s recent filing, as of May 17, WCJ had only performed three additional \ntests, so that total inmates tested as of that date is 26.  With so little testing in the wake of the \noutbreak at WCJ, it is a very high probability that there are inmates who have COVID-19 in the \njail—both symptomatic and asymptomatic –housed in small cells with others and who remain \nunable to practice social distancing.   \n \n3.  The risk of new sources of infection coming into the Weld County Jail from \narrestees remains high given that Weld County is a hotspot for the virus in Colorado, with \nsome of the largest and deadliest outbreaks in the state occurring in Weld County.  Weld \nCounty has the fifth highest rate of COVID-19 infection in the state, surpassing Denver, \nArapahoe, Adams and Jefferson County.  Weld County also has the fourth highest death rate.  \nThese trends appear to be driven by community-based outbreaks, including at the JBS meat \npacking plant, where at least 366 employees have tested positive for COVID-19 and at least 8 \nhave died. The plant is currently open despite that many workers have not been tested.   Clearly \nthe outbreak is not under control in that plant, and it is highly probable that many of the untested \nemployees have COVID-19. Additionally, several Weld County nursing homes have seen \noutbreaks. Centennial Health Care Center in Greely has had at least 22 residents deaths out of the \n46 confirmed cases to date.  In the midst of these outbreaks, Weld County has substantially \nreopened its economy, which occurred despite opposition from the Weld County Health Director \nwho recently left his position.  Based on data and reports from other jurisdictions, it is my \nopinion that the relatively high infection rate in Weld County combined with the reopening of \nthe economy substantially increases the risk that some new arrestees booked into the Weld \nCounty Jail will have COVID-19, whether or not they are symptomatic for it.   \nWeld County Jail’s May 18, 2020 plan for increased protection of medically vulnerable \ninmates: \nWeld County Jail’s plan for increased protection of medically vulnerable inmates, as \ndocumented in the filing of May 18, reflects several substantial improvements, most notably \nWCJ’s plan to mandate employees to completely disinfect common spaces prior to use of those \nspaces by medically vulnerable inmates. Additionally, it is commendable that the jail has \nguaranteed the provision to inmates of either disposable masks, which will be replaced every \nthree days, or the use of face cloth masks which will be laundered regularly.   \nHowever, the following aspects of plan leave medically vulnerable inmates at grave risk of \nserious illness or death:   \n1.  The plan allows two untested medically vulnerable inmates to be housed together at \nintake.  This arrangement would pose a substantial risk of infection of a medically \nvulnerable inmates at any jail, but most particularly in Weld County given the breadth of \nthe community outbreak.   \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 63-1   Filed 05/27/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 6\n2.  Rather than prioritizing single cell housing in general population for the 89 identified \nmedically vulnerable inmates, the plan allows untested medically vulnerable inmates to \nbe housed in cells together.  Of greatest concern, the plan calls for untested medically \nvulnerable inmates to be transferred into the cell of another untested medically vulnerable \ninmate. The plan places no limit on the number of medically vulnerable inmates who can \nbe housed in a cell together. \n \n3.  Despite the availability of testing, the plan does not call for universal testing, prevalence \ntesting, testing of all new arrestees or even testing of medically vulnerable inmates. \n \n4.  The screening questions for medically vulnerable inmates are inadequate to ensure \nidentification of all medically vulnerable inmates.  Some questions, such as whether or \nnot a person is “immunocompromised,” are both medically technical and overly general \nto ensure that people with varying degrees of education and medical knowledge will be \nable to answer accurately.   \n \nMy most significant concerns with this plan relate to lack of social distancing for medically \nvulnerable inmates.  Without social distancing, medically vulnerable inmates face a substantial \nrisk of becoming unnecessarily infected with COVID-19 and becoming seriously ill and/or \ndying.  As I discussed in my April 24 declaration, medically vulnerable inmates are safest from \nCOVID-19 when not in custody, and should be released whenever possible.  If they must remain \nin custody, social distancing at all times – particularly when testing is not occurring – is \nessential.  During my April 24 inspection of the WCJ, I noted several empty cells in all units that \nI visited, while medically vulnerable inmates were in small cells with 1-3 other cellmates.  With \nonly 89 identified medically vulnerable inmates, it is my opinion that the jail will protect the \nmost lives by focusing on single celling all medically vulnerable inmates.   \nSheriff Reams asserts that single celling medically vulnerable inmates will negatively impact \nnon-medically vulnerable inmates who would presumably have more densely populated cells.   \nWhile densely populated cells certainly create a risk of spread in that cell – particularly without \nuniversal testing – it is my opinion that protecting medically vulnerable inmates by single celling \nthem is the most important way (short of reduced population) to avoid serious illness and death \nfrom COVID-19, even if that means housing more non-medically vulnerable inmates in a cell \ntogether.  Increasing the risk to younger, healthier inmates while decreasing the risk for \nmedically vulnerable inmates is an appropriate harm-reduction measure. \nOne important note is that I agree with Sheriff Reams’ assessment that the creation of a pod of \nmedically vulnerable inmates would pose an increased risk of harm to those inmates.  Medically \nvulnerable inmates become infected more easily, spread the virus more easily, and get seriously \nsick and die more easily. Thus, if COVID-19 were to find its way into a pod of all medically \nvulnerable inmates, the effects could be devastating.  For example, the experience in nursing \nhomes and skilled nursing facilities has demonstrated that transferring asymptomatic or \npresymptomatic persons to a new unit or pod without viral testing facilitated the spread to these \nnew units and ultimately spread the outbreak to new areas inside these facilities1. Particularly \n \n1 Gandhi M, Yokoe DS, Havlir DV. Asymptomatic transmission, the Achilles’ heel of current strategies to control \nCovid-19. N Engl J Med 2020. April 24. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMe2009758. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 63-1   Filed 05/27/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 6\ngiven that WCJ is not even testing medically vulnerable inmates, there is a substantial risk that \nany pod of medically vulnerable inmates will suffer from a COVID-19 infection. \n \nRecommendations \n1.  Substantially increase testing for COVID-19 in the Weld County Jail.  It is my \nopinion that WCJ could likely acquire sufficient tests to do universal testing, to \ncontinually test people upon intake, and to continually test anyone who shows any \nsymptoms of COVID-19.  WCJ should acquire tests to the greatest extent possible and \nprioritize use of the tests as follows: \na.  Test all new admission to the jail before they encounter other people. \nb.  Test all medically vulnerable inmates. \nc.  Test any inmate with one or more symptoms consistent with COVID-19. \nd.  Perform prevalence testing. \ne.  Perform universal testing. \nf.  For each person who tests negative, only presume the person is negative if the \nperson is tested again a week after the first test and is still negative.   \n \n2.  Improve screening tool to reasonably ensure identification of all medically \nvulnerable inmates. Rather than only generally asking inmates whether they have \n“chronic lung disease,” a “serious heart condition,” “liver disease,” or are \n“immunocompromised,” the screening questions should also list the most common \nconditions within these general categories.  For instance, as CDC’s website discusses, \ncancer, bone marrow transplant, and the use of certain medications are conditions that \nwould render someone “immunocompromised” and therefore medically vulnerable.2  \nCDC provides more detailed information about what kinds of common conditions place \npeople at high risk on their website.3  Conditions listed on the CDC website can provide \nguideposts to creating a more effective screening tool. Additionally, based on my \nexperience interviewing patients, including inmates, it is important to ask patients about \ntheir current medications and recent hospitalizations, which can reveal information about \nserious medical conditions (such as cancer) that render the person high risk.   \n \n3.  All medically vulnerable inmates should be single celled and tested through intake \nand transition. There is a substantial risk that housing medically vulnerable inmates \ntogether at intake and transition will lead to infecting some medically vulnerable inmates \nwith COVID-19.  Testing of all individuals, or at least medically vulnerable individuals, \nat intake will decrease this risk. However, we are seeing a 30% false negative rate in \nCOVID-19 testing.  If there is to be any housing of medically vulnerable inmates together \nat any time during intake or transition, it should only be after both inmates have tested \nnegative twice over a week’s time during which time each inmate has been single celled \nand able to practice social distancing.   \n \n \n2 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/immunocompromised.html \n3 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/groups-at-higher-risk.html#liver-disease \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 63-1   Filed 05/27/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 6\n4.  Medically vulnerable inmates should be prioritized for single cell in general \npopulation.  For the reasons discussed above, single celling medically vulnerable \ninmates throughout their incarceration should be prioritized even if that leads to some \npopulation density increase for non-medically vulnerable inmates.  To the extent that \nWCJ truly has no choice but to house medically vulnerable inmates together in a cell, it is \nimperative that each medically vulnerable inmate be cleared of COVID-19 through \ntesting at least twice over a week’s period4,5. \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the statements above are true and correct to the best of \nmy knowledge. \nDate: May 27, 2020 \n \n \n______________________________ \nCarlos Franco-Paredes, MD, MPH, DTMH (Gorgas) \nAssociate Professor of Medicine \n   \n \n \n \n4 Solis J, Franco-Paredes C, Henao-Martínez AF, Krsak M, Zimmer SM.

INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs ask this Court to certify a class of inmates to address alleged deficiencies \nin the handling of COVID-19 by the Weld County Jail even though this Court has rejected \nthe proposed class definition. The class also cannot readily be delineated, and injunctive \nrelief for the class would be unworkable and unmanageable. Plaintiff, put forth multiple \nparties for class representatives, most of whom are no longer housed within the Jail and \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 64   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 16\nthus no longer possess a stake in this case. Plaintiffs’ attempt at class certification does \nnot meet the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 23 and must, therefore, be denied. \nII.  RELEVANT FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs bring this lawsuit against the Sheriff in his official capacity and ask the \nCourt to grant injunctive and declaratory relief to address contended deficiencies in the \nWeld County Sheriff’s Office’s (“WCSO”) response to COVID-19 in the Weld County Jail \n(“WCJ”). [See ECF 7 at 27-28; ECF 2 at 10-11]. Plaintiffs ask the Court to certify a class \nof all “medically vulnerable” inmates, which Plaintiffs define broadly. [See ECF 2 at 3 \n(providing Plaintiffs’ proposed class definition)]. Notably, this Court adopted a separate, \nnarrower definition of “medically vulnerable” in its Order partially granting and otherwise \ndenying Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction. [See ECF 55 at 5-6, 30, 37-38]. \nPlaintiffs Carranza, Martinez, Barnum, Lewis, and Ward were all pretrial detainees \nwhen this case was filed. [See ECF 7 at 7-9]. Of those five, only Martinez remains a \npretrial detainee. Plaintiffs assert Plaintiff Propes pleaded guilty but was not sentenced. \n[ECF 7 at 10]. In fact, Mr. Propes was issued a court-ordered release on April 7, 2020, \nthe day before the Complaint was filed. [See ECF 26-10 at 7].1 Plaintiff Hunter was serving \na 90-day jail sentence when the Complaint was filed and Plaintiffs expected his release \non April 26, 2020; he was in fact released on April 15, 2020. [Compare ECF 7 at 10 with \nECF 26-10 at 9 and Third Suppl. Decl. of Matthew Turner, attached as Exh. A (release \ndate of April 15, 2020)]. Mr. Barnum was released on bond on May 20, 2020. [Exh. A]. \n                                                 \n1 Mr. Propes was arrested on June 5, 2020, after he failed to appear for a hearing \nin connection with the charges respecting which he was released on April 7, 2020. He is \ncurrently housed in the WCJ pending state court judicial proceedings. [See Exh. A]. \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 64   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 16\nIII.  ARGUMENT \n  For the below reasons, Plaintiffs failed to carry their burden under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23, \nand this Court should deny Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification [ECF 2]. \nA.  Standard of Review \n“Put  simply,  before  a  district  court  certifies  a  class  it  must  ensure  that  the \nrequirements of Rule 23 are met.” Vallario v. Vandehey, 554 F.3d 1259, 1266 (10th Cir. \n2009). Rule 23 allows for a civil action to be certified as a class action if, and only if, \nmultiple requirements are all satisfied concurrently. First,  \n(a) One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative \nparties on behalf of all members only if: (1) the class is so numerous that \njoinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact \ncommon to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties \nare typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative \nparties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \n \nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(a). Second, and in addition to the requirements of Rule 23(a), Plaintiffs \nmust also show the proposed class meets the requirements of one of the subsections of \nRule 23(b). Here, Plaintiffs are moving for class certification under Rule 23(b)(2), which \nrequires them to show the Sheriff as the party opposing the class “acted or refused to act \non grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2). \nThe parties seeking class certification bear “a strict burden of proof” to ensure each \nprerequisite is satisfied. Reed v. Bowen, 849 F.2d 1307, 1309 (10th Cir. 1988). This \ninvolves a “careful certification inquiry,” considering the facts of the particular matter at \nhand. Vallario, 554 F.3d at 1269 (citing Unger v. Amedisys Inc., 401 F.3d 316, 319 (5th \nCir. 2005), and Trevizo v. Adams, 455 F.3d 1155, 1163 (10th Cir. 2006)). “The district \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 64   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 16\ncourt must engage in its own ‘rigorous analysis’ of whether ‘the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) \nhave been satisfied.’” Shook v. El Paso Cnty., 386 F.3d 963, 968 (10th Cir. 2004) \n(“Shook I”) (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of the S.W. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982)). \nB.  Plaintiffs Fail to Meet the Requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a). \n1.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(1): Numerosity \nTo establish numerosity, Plaintiffs must show “the class is so numerous as to make \njoinder impracticable.” Peterson v. Okla. City Housing Auth., 545 F.2d 1270, 1273 (10th \nCir. 1976). Under Plaintiffs’ expansive proposed class which the Court rejected, 390 \ninmates, or 87%, of the WCJ population would be class members as of May 18, 2020. \n[See ECF 60 at 2-3 n.2]. In the interest of efficiency, the Sheriff acknowledges this number \nof potential class members. Regardless, Plaintiffs cannot shoulder the remainder of their \nburden to show any certification of Plaintiffs’ proposed class by the Court is appropriate. \n2.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(2): Commonality \nNext, Plaintiffs must demonstrate “there are questions of law or fact common to \nthe class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). “Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality requirement ‘is easy to \nmisread.’” Harrel’s LLC v. Chaparral Energy, LLC (Naylor Farms, Inc.), 923 F.3d 779, \n789 (10th Cir. 2019) (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 349 (2011)). \nA plaintiff cannot just point to “a common contention”; rather, the “common contention ... \nmust be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution—which means that \ndetermination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each \none of the claims in one stroke.” Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350 (concluding class certification \nshould be denied). “In other words, the focus of Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality requirement \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 64   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 16\nis not so much on whether there exist common questions, but rather on ‘the capacity of \na classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the \nlitigation.’” Harrel’s, 923 F.3d at 789 (quoting Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350). \nHowever, as discussed at greater length below in connection with Rule 23(b)(2), \nPlaintiffs’ requested injunctive relief is incapable of resolving their claims “in one stroke” \nas the United States Supreme Court requires. Plaintiffs ask for an injunction applicable to \nthe  whole proposed class,  comprising  almost  90% of  the WCJ  population.  But  the \nconstraints of housing assignments, classification, jail security, the WCJ’s physical plant, \nand other similar concerns, as this Court recognized in ECF 55, signal any injunctive relief \nmust inevitably be tailored to unique considerations of each inmate and will not provide a \nclasswide resolution. That is, Plaintiffs’ claims lack the “capacity ... to generate common \nanswers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.” Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350. \n3.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(3): Typicality \nPlaintiffs must also establish typicality—their claims or defenses must be “typical \nof the claims or defenses of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). “Provided the claims of \nNamed Plaintiffs and class members are based on the same legal or remedial theory, \ndiffering fact situations of the class members do not defeat typicality.” DG v. Devaughn, \n594 F.3d 1188, 1198-99 (10th Cir. 2010). But Plaintiffs’ own claims defeat typicality \nbecause they contend different legal theories apply within the proposed class. \nPlaintiffs’ argument against the Sheriff is divided into two separate legal standards, \none—Plaintiffs  assert—applicable  to  pretrial  detainees,  and  a  second  applicable  to \nconvicted inmates. [See ECF 1 at 32 n.62 (Plaintiffs’ argument); ECF 55 at 18 n.9 (Court’s \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 64   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 16\nOrder discussing the argument)]. While the Sheriff disagrees a separate standard exists \nfor  pretrial  detainees’  jail  condition  claims  [see  ECF  26  at  16-17],  Plaintiffs’  class \ncertification burden requires Plaintiffs to explain how their asserted claims are “typical” \nwhen Plaintiffs themselves contend their proposed class contains divergent claims. In \naddition, as further discussed below regarding the named Plaintiffs’ appropriateness (or \nlack thereof) as class representatives, most of the named Plaintiffs have been released \nfrom custody and their claims are therefore moot. A moot claim, being jurisdictionally \ninvalid, is inherently not “based on the same legal or remedial theory” as the live claim of \na potential class member. Plaintiffs cannot satisfy their burden for typicality. \n4.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(4): Class representatives and adequacy of representation \nPlaintiffs  must  also  meet  Rule  23(a)’s  final  requirement:  the  proposed  class \nrepresentatives must “fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(a)(4). The Sheriff has no reason to believe Plaintiffs’ class counsel are unable to \nprosecute this claim. Plaintiffs themselves, though, cannot serve as class representatives. \nEven if the first three requirements of Rule 23(a) were met (which they are not), \nPlaintiffs  are  not  the  proper  representatives  for  the  putative  class.  With  only  two \nexceptions, Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief are moot, as all named Plaintiffs except \nMartinez were released from the WCJ and Propes is back in.2 See Green v. Branson, \n                                                 \n2 In ECF 37, the parties agreed the Sheriff “will not argue any mootness issue,” in \nany Response to ECF 2, “that is brought about solely by a proposed class representative \nbeing released from custody on or after the current response due date (April 28, 2020) \nand on or before the date the Sheriff’s Response to ECF 2 is filed.” [ECF 37 at 2]. In \ncandor, the Sheriff does not contend this argument applies to Richard Barnum, but notes \nthe Court can consider sua sponte whether it has subject matter jurisdiction. \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 64   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 16\n108 F.3d 1296, 1299-1300 (10th Cir. 1997) (inmate’s injunctive relief claim moot once \ninmate released from subject facility); Clark v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 590 F.3d \n1134, 1138 (10th Cir. 2009) (in general, suit brought as class action “‘must be dismissed \nfor mootness when the personal claims of the named plaintiffs are satisfied and no class \nhas been properly certified.’” (quoting Reed v. Heckler, 756 F.2d 779, 785 (10th Cir. \n1985)); but cf. Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 110 n.11 (1975) (because pretrial custody \nlength “cannot be ascertained at the outset, and it may be ended at any time” for multiple \nreasons, existing pretrial detainees qualify as an exception to the mootness doctrine). \nMartinez and Propes are currently being held as pretrial detainees.3 No other \nnamed  Plaintiff  is now  in  the WCJ, and no  convicted  inmate  proposed  as  a  class \nrepresentative is within the WCJ as a convicted inmate. Plaintiffs’ claims as to convicted \ninmates are therefore moot and no class of such inmates can be certified. While Gerstein \ncarved out a narrow mootness exception for pretrial detainees, it did not for convicted \ninmates. This distinction is sensible, as pretrial detainees can be released at any time for \nseveral reasons, but convicted inmates have known sentencing and release dates. \nPlaintiffs here chose as their “convicted inmate” class representatives Mr. Propes, \nwho was in fact released the day before the Complaint was filed, and Mr. Hunter, whom \nthey expected would complete his sentence on April 26, 2020, before the Sheriff was \neven required to file a response to ECF 2. Having chosen inmates whose claims Plaintiffs \n                                                 \n3 Plaintiffs neither filed a Fourteenth Amendment claim on behalf of Mr. Propes nor \nlisted him as a representative for a putative class for any Fourteenth Amendment claim. \nSee Ellsworth v. People, 987 P.2d 264, 266 (Colo. 1999) (“This rule makes it clear that \nthe sentence is an essential component of a ‘judgment.’”).s \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 64   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 16\nknew would be moot, Plaintiffs cannot now ask the Court to resuscitate those claims via \na class action. Cf. Vallario, 554 F.3d at 1269-70 (cautioning district court against giving \nundue weight to claim plaintiffs cannot get judicial review of jail practices absent certifying \nrequested class and to view their “bald assertions in this regard with some skepticism”). \nPlaintiffs cannot meet the weighty requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(1)-(4), and \nthe Court should deny certification of Plaintiffs’ proposed class on this basis alone. \nC.  Plaintiffs Also Do Not Satisfy Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) \nPlaintiffs must also satisfy the standards of Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2), their chosen \nsection of Rule 23(b) [see ECF 2 at 2], but they do not. The Court should deny class \ncertification based on Rule 23(b)(2) for at least three reasons. First, Plaintiffs have made \nessentially no argument as to Rule 23(b)(2). [See generally ECF 2]. Second, “difficulties \nin identifying characteristics of the class [] prevent plaintiffs from carrying their burden of \nshowing that ‘final injunctive relief ... is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.’” \nShook v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm’rs, 543 F.3d 597, 612 (10th Cir. 2008) (“Shook II”) (quoting \nRule 23(b)(2)). And third, Plaintiffs’ requested classwide relief is totally unmanageable. \nRule 23(b)(2) allows for class certification where “the party opposing the class has \nacted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive \nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). In Shook II, the Tenth Circuit analyzed this rule in a case highly \nsimilar to this one, reviewing denial of class certification for inmates in a Colorado jail \nclaiming a Sheriff’s Office was deliberately indifferent and deprived the proposed class of \nadequate mental health treatment. 543 F.3d at 600-01. The appellate court explained \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 64   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 16\nRule 23(b)(2) creates two requirements. First, “the defendants’ actions or inactions must \nbe based on grounds generally applicable to all class members.” Id. at 604. Second, “the \nfinal injunctive relief must be appropriate for the class as a whole. The rule therefore \nauthorizes an inquiry into the relationship between the class, its injuries, and the relief \nsought, and we have interpreted the rule to require that a class must be ‘amenable to \nuniform group remedies.’” Id. (emphasis in original) (quoting Shook I, 386 F.3d at 973). \nRule  23(b)(2)  “demands  a  certain  cohesiveness  among  class  members  with \nrespect  to  their  injuries,  the  absence  of  which  can  preclude  certification.”  Id.  This \ncohesiveness “has at least two aspects.” Initially, the class must be cohesive enough for \na classwide injunction to “‘state its terms specifically; and describe in reasonable detail ... \nthe act or acts restrained or required.’” Id. (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(1). Moreover,  \n“[a] class action may not be certified under Rule 23(b)(2) if relief specifically \ntailored to each class member would be necessary to correct the allegedly \nwrongful conduct of the defendant.” So, if redressing the class members’ \ninjuries requires time-consuming inquiry into individual circumstances or \ncharacteristics of class members or groups of class members, “the suit \ncould become unmanageable and little value would be gained in proceeding \nas a class action.” ... In short, under Rule 23(b)(2) the class members’ \ninjuries must be sufficiently similar that they can be addressed in a single \ninjunction that need not differentiate between class members. \n \nId. (quoting 5 Moore’s Fed. Prac. § 23.43(2)(b) at 23-195 (3d. ed. 2000) and Barnes v. \nAm. Tobacco Co., 161 F.3d 127, 143 (3d Cir. 1998)). Applying these holdings here \nreveals the inadequacy of Plaintiffs’ arguments and of Plaintiffs’ proposed class. \nFirst,  Plaintiffs  make  virtually  no  argument  on  Rule  23(b)(2),  and  what  little \nargument they do make does not satisfy their burden. Plaintiffs assert: 23(b)(2) is meant \nfor civil  rights  cases;  and  the  single  injunction  they  seek  would  give  “system-wide, \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 64   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 16\nprocess-based relief…[and] would benefit all members of the proposed class – and falls \nsquarely within the purview of Rule 23(b)(2) as a result.” [ECF 2, pp. 10-11]. Plaintiffs \nprovide no further explanation for this conclusory argument. \nSimply putting to paper a civil rights claim does not talismanically satisfy Rule \n23(b)(3). As Shook II noted, “‘[t]he mere fact that a complaint alleges [violation of a civil \nright] does not in itself ensure’ that Rule 23’s requirements are satisfied.” Id. at 610 \n(quoting E. Tex. Motor Freight Sys. Inc. v. Rodriguez, 431 U.S. 395, 405 (1977)). The \nbare assertion Rule 23(b)(2) is meant for civil rights claims similarly is not enough here. \nNext, Plaintiffs offer only a cursory, conclusory argument about Rule 23(b)(2)’s two \nseparate requirements. Plaintiffs do not explain either how the Sheriff here “has acted or \nrefused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), or \nwhy relief to the “class as a whole” would be appropriate here. Id. Plaintiffs have given \nthis Court no guidance or support for how to make the “inquiry into the relationship \nbetween the class, its injuries, and the relief sought,” Shook II, 543 F.3d at 612, in order \nto determine whether the proposed class is “amenable to uniform group remedies.” \nShook I, 386 F.3d at 973. Plaintiffs have in no way carried their burden for Rule 23(b)(2). \nSecond, “difficulties in identifying characteristics of the class [] prevent plaintiffs \nfrom  carrying  their  burden  of  showing  that  ‘final  injunctive  relief  ...  is  appropriate \nrespecting the class as a whole.’” Shook II, 543 F.3d at 612 (quoting Rule 23(b)(2)). \nPlaintiffs already made this point better than the Sheriff ever could by means of their own \nfilings. Merely ten days after the Court issued its Order after the preliminary injunction \nhearing, Plaintiffs already commenced arguing the WCSO is not adequately identifying \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 64   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 16\nall inmates who are “medically vulnerable” as defined by the Court in ECF 55. [See ECF \n62 at 8-9].4 In the context of a jail, the only way to identify whether inmates qualify as \nmedically vulnerable is to ask them; the WCJ generally does not have pre-incarceration \nmedical records. [See Transcript, Apr. 30, 2020, at 116:17-117:7 & 185:7-186:25]. But \ngiven Plaintiffs revealed their belief additional inmates are “medically vulnerable” beyond \nthose  identified  by  the  WCSO  and,  in  fact,  beyond  those  identified  by  this  Court, \ndelineating the proposed class certainly will result in protracted litigation. Concerns with \nissues “associated with identifying characteristics of the class essential to determining \nwhether class-wide  relief  is appropriate”  constitute a  legitimate  basis to  deny  class \ncertification due to “concern with how the Jail, not the court, would be able to identify \nmembers of the class ... in a way that would allow the Jail to comply with any relief \nobtained or the court to monitor the Jail's compliance with such relief.” Shook II, 543 F.3d \nat 612 (emphasis in original). Plaintiffs already showed the same concerns apply here.5 \nFinally, the classwide relief Plaintiffs seek implicates classification and housing \ndeterminations within the WCJ, as well as security issues, movement of inmates, the \nlimitations of the WCJ’s physical plant, and various other considerations which “require[] \n                                                 \n4 It bears repeating: the Court’s definition of “medically vulnerable” substantially \ndiffers from Plaintiffs’ definition of the proposed class. [Compare ECF 2 at 3 with ECF 55 \nat 5-6, 30, 37-38]. In fact, Plaintiffs’ definition is much broader which means more disputes \nabout whether inmates were properly included in the class. See ECF 60-1 ¶ 20 (providing \ndata from WCJ medical screening, conducted in response to this Court’s May 11, 2020, \nOrder, as of May 13, 2020, 19% of WCJ population was medically vulnerable under this \nCourt’s definition while 83% was medically vulnerable under Plaintiffs’ broader definition)]. \n5 Given the clear applicability of Shook II to this case, any reliance by Plaintiffs on \nParsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657 (9th Cir. 2014), is quite misplaced. Likewise, Plaintiffs’ \nreliance on Kerns v. Spectralink Corp., 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11711 (D. Colo July 1, \n2003), is misplaced too because Kerns involved multiple defendants acting in common. \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 64   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 16\ntime-consuming inquiry into individual circumstances or characteristics of class members \nor groups of class members, [so] ‘the suit could become unmanageable and little value \nwould be gained in proceeding as a class action.’” Id. at 604 (quoting Barnes v. Am. \nTobacco Co., 161 F.3d 127, 143 (3d Cir. 1998)). The Court’s Order requires the WCSO \nto socially distance “medically vulnerable” inmates “to the maximum extent possible \nconsidering the Jail’s physical layout, population level, and classification needs.” [ECF 55 \nat 38]. The Order also requires the WCSO to single-cell or socially distance “medically \nvulnerable” inmates in the intake unit “to the maximum extent possible considering the \nJail’s  physical  layout  and  classification  needs.”  Id.  This  Order  applies  to  medically \nvulnerable inmates, who, as defined by the Court, comprise less than 20% of the WCJ \npopulation. [See ECF 60 at 3 (current on May 18, 2020); ECF 60-1 ¶ 24]. Applying this or \na similar order—as sought by Plaintiffs—to the proposed class would be unmanageable. \nThe proposed class, based on Plaintiffs’ definition of “medically vulnerable,” would \ninclude roughly 87% of the WCJ population, or 390 inmates. [See ECF 60 at 3-4 n.2 \n(current as of May 18, 2020); ECF 60-1 ¶ 25]. It will be effectively impossible to socially \ndistance almost 90% of the WCJ population, so there will be ongoing litigation about what \nfactors the WCSO considered in making individual housing decisions for inmates, relative \nto whether each such inmate was socially distanced “to the maximum extent possible”—\nan inherently fact-specific and individualized inquiry into the bases for a decision and \navailable alternatives. Rather than classwide injunctive relief, certifying the proposed \nclass will convert this Court effectively into a “super-warden” reviewer of all classification \nand  housing  assignment  decisions  at  the  WCJ.  See  Vallario,  554  F.3d  at  1268 \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 64   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 16\n(“Respondents cannot demonstrate, without more, that ‘injunctive relief—relative to the \nclass—is conceivable and manageable without embroiling’ the district court ‘in disputes \nover individualized situations and constantly shifting class contours.’” (quoting Shook II, \n543 F.3d at 608)); see also Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 548 (1979) (“[T]he operation \nof our correctional facilities is peculiarly the province of the Legislative and Executive \nBranches of our Government, not the Judicial.”); Peterson v. Shanks, 149 F.3d 1140, \n1144 (10th Cir. 1998) (“[I]t is not the role of the federal judiciary to scrutinize and interfere \nwith the daily operations of a state prison.”); Banning v. Looney, 213 F.2d 771, 771 (10th \nCir. 1954) (federal courts have no power “to supervise prison administration or to interfere \nwith the ordinary prison rules or regulations”). \nThe injunctive relief Plaintiffs seek—to socially distance nearly 90% of the WCJ—\nis totally unmanageable and completely inappropriate for classwide relief. Plaintiffs do \nnot, and cannot, carry their burden under Rule 23(b)(2). \nD.  In Any Event, This Court Already Repudiated Plaintiffs’ Proposed Class \nPlaintiffs’ proposed class still includes all “medically vulnerable” inmates under \nPlaintiffs’ expansive definition. [See ECF 2, p. 3]. This Court has already rejected this \ndefinition of “medically vulnerable” in its Order. [Compare ECF 2 at 3 (giving Plaintiffs’ \nproposed definition of “medically vulnerable, to define the proposed class), with ECF 55 \nat 5-6, 30, 37-38 (adopting a narrower definition of “medically vulnerable” than Plaintiffs \nproposed)]. Since the Court issued its Order on May 11, 2020, Plaintiffs have not sought \nleave to amend either their Complaint or their Motion for Class Certification to modify their \nproposed class to be coterminous with the Court’s adopted, narrow definition of “medically \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 64   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 16\nvulnerable.” Instead, Plaintiffs elected not to modify their request for the Court to certify \nthe proposed class of “medically vulnerable” inmates as understood from ECF 2.6 \nAbsolutely no reason exists for this Court to reverse course and adopt Plaintiffs’ \nproposed class definition. It would also be wholly improper for this Court to certify a class \nbased on this Court’s definition of “medically vulnerable” in ECF 55, relief for which \nPlaintiffs neither asked nor offered support and to which the Sheriff has had no opportunity \nto specifically respond. Plaintiffs simply cannot meet their “strict burden of proof” for their \nproposed class. Reed, 849 F.2d at 1309. What’s more, “the district court does not ‘bear \nthe  burden  of  constructing  subclasses.  That  burden  is  upon  the  [party  seeking \ncertification] and it is he who is required to submit proposals to the court.’” Shook II, 543 \nF.3d at 607 (quoting United States Parole Comm'n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 408 \n(1980)). Plaintiffs made no argument in support of subclasses, let alone met their burden. \nThis Court must hold Plaintiffs to their burden, a burden Plaintiffs cannot meet for \ntheir proposed class. The Court chose not to address the propriety of certifying Plaintiffs’ \nproposed class in its prior Order, [see ECF 55 at 14 n.5], leaving the issue for another \nday. That day has come and Plaintiffs have not met their burden. \n                                                 \n6 Further, the Court must disregard any argument or shift in strategy in Plaintiffs’ \nReply to this Response attempting to adopt the Court’s definition of “medically vulnerable” \nto define Plaintiffs’ proposed class or arguing for subclasses, unless the Court also \npermits the Sheriff a surreply. E.g., Menge v. AT&T, Inc., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20008, \nat *2 (D. Colo. Feb. 13, 2013) (Brimmer, C.J.) (“Granting leave to file a surreply is part of \nthe ‘supervision of litigation’ and thus falls within the discretion of the district court. \nHowever, the Court’s discretion is limited insofar as it may not deny the non-movant’s \nmotion to file a surreply unless it disregards any new arguments in the moving party’s \nreply.”). In addition, allowing Plaintiffs to again metastasize their requested relief on Reply \nwill represent yet another effort by Plaintiffs to “shift[] over the course of this case” the \nrelief they seek, which is improper. [See ECF 55 at 30 n.16]. \n14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 64   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 16\nIV.  CONCLUSION \nIn the final analysis, this Court should deny certification of Plaintiffs’ proposed class \nbecause the Court already rejected Plaintiffs’ definition of “medically vulnerable” and \nbecause Plaintiffs cannot carry their burden. They do not meet the strict requirements of \nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(a), and their argument regarding Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) also is deficient. \nOther legitimate concerns about class definition and manageability also weigh heavily \nagainst certifying this class under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2); the relief Plaintiffs seek is not \nworkable for the nearly 90% of the WCJ population to which they seek to apply it and will \nresult  in  ongoing  litigation  over  who  is  a  proper  class  member.  Granting  Plaintiffs’ \nproposed  class  would  also  embroil  this  Court  in  individual,  highly  fact-specific \nclassification and housing decisions as de facto supervisor of all such decisions at the \nWCJ, and otherwise render classwide relief unmanageable. As a result, Defendant Sheriff \nSteven Reams requests this Court enter an Order: denying Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class \nCertification in its entirety, with prejudice, and entering all other relief deemed just. \nDated and respectfully submitted this 8th day of June, 2020. \ns/ Matthew J.

I have personal knowledge of the matters in this Declaration. \n2.  I currently serve as the Jail Captain for the Weld County Jail (“WCJ”) in the \nCounty of Weld, State of Colorado. I have served in this position for six months. \n3.  Before beginning my tenure as the WCSO Jail Captain on January 1, 2020, I \nwas employed with the Weld County Sheriff’s Office (“WCSO”) for eight (8) prior years \nand served in many positions: Corrections Officer (what is now called Detentions Deputy) \nand separately earned my Peace Officer Standards Training (“POST”) certification; Public \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 64-1   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 3\nEXHIBIT A\nInformation Officer Corporal; Detentions Division Shift Sergeant; Civil Unit Sergeant in \ncharge of civil service processors, animal control, and victim advocates; and Detentions \nDivision Lieutenant.  Of my eight years working for the WCSO, I have spent a total of 5.5 \nyears working in the WCJ. \n4.  I also earned an Associate of Arts degree in education from Front Range \nCommunity College in 2011 with a future goal to attain a Bachelor of Science in Criminal \nJustice from the University of Northern Colorado. \n5.  In my role as Jail Captain, I am familiar with how to access and review records \nfrom the WCJ showing what inmates are detained currently and were detained at earlier \ndates, the reasons for detention, when inmates were released from detention, and the \nreason for the release. All of this information is maintained by the WCSO in the normal \ncourse of operating the WCJ. \n6.  Regarding  Plaintiffs  Chad  Hunter,  Colby  Propes,  and  Richard  Barnum,  I \npersonally reviewed WCSO records to determine whether they were released from the \nWCJ, when they were released, and the reasons for the release. After completing this \nreview, I located the following information: \na.  Chad Hunter was released from the WCJ on April 15, 2020 to serve the \nremainder of his court-imposed sentence on home detention. \nb.  Colby Propes was released on bond from the WCJ on April 7, 2020, \npending sentencing. He subsequently failed to appear for his sentencing \nhearing and was arrested on June 5, 2020, on warrants issued due to \nthat failure to appear. He is now housed in the WCJ pending sentencing. \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 64-1   Filed 06/08/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 3\nEXHIBIT A\nc.  Richard Barnum was released on bond from the WCJ on May 20, 2020. \n \nI understand the statements written in this Declaration are given under penalty of \nperjury. All of the foregoing statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge. \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746 I declare, under penalty of perjury under the laws of the \nUnited States of America, the foregoing is true and correct. \nFURTHER DECLARANT SAYETH NAUGHT. \nDated and executed this 8th day of June, 2020. \n \n \n              s/ Matthew Turner       \n              Matthew Turner, Jail Captain, \n              Weld County Sheriff’s Office \n3 ",

Supplemental Evidence \nOn the night of Tuesday April 7, 2020, Plaintiffs moved for an emergency order that the \nWeld County Jail (“WCJ”) must provide inmates who are at high-risk of serious illness or death \nfrom COVID-19 with constitutionally adequate protection from infection with the virus.  ECF \nDoc. 1.  New evidence pertinent to this Court’s consideration of Plaintiffs’ motion for injunctive \nrelief has come to light.  Most importantly, the number of positive cases of COVID-19 in the \nWeld County Jail has increased.  As of the day of the filing, the most recent news coverage \nreflected that WCJ had one inmate who had tested positive for COVID-19.1  By Friday, April 10, \n \n1 Reid, Trevor, Greeley Tribune, Weld County Jail inmate, 4 employees test positive for COVID-\n19, Apr. 1, 2020, available at https://www.greeleytribune.com/news/weld-county-jail-inmate-\nseveral-employees-test-positive-for-covid-19/ (last viewed April 13, 2020). \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 8\n2020, Plaintiffs’ counsel learned directly from WCJ staff that there were fourteen inmates who \nthey had identified as positive for  COVID-19, including six inmates with positive tests and eight  \ninmates who were presumed positive based on symptoms.  A fifteenth person had tested positive \nbut had been transferred to the hospital.   Additionally, in the six days since Plaintiffs filed their \nmotion, deaths in Weld County resulting from COVID-19 have continued to increase.  With 48 \ndeaths, Weld County now has the largest number of COVID-19 related deaths in the state, \nsurpassing Denver.2   \nSince last week’s filing, Plaintiffs’ counsel has learned that just two days after his release \nfrom the Weld County jail, an inmate died from COVID-19 complications.  Exhibit 1, Cheryl \nCook Declaration.  Charles Peterson, the inmate who died, was a 78-year-old man who had spent \nabout 20 days in WCJ on a parole hold before he was released gravely ill with COVID-19.  Ex. \n1, pp. 1-2.  WCJ released Mr. Peterson who had been exhibiting symptoms while in jail, without \ninforming the people who picked him up and shared a home with him that he was sick.  Ex. 1, \npp. 2-3.  Mr. Peterson barely made it to his home before an ambulance had to be called.  Ex. 1, p. \n2.  He died of complications from COVID-19 two days later.  Ex. 1, p. 2.  Mr. Peterson’s tragic \nstory underscores the unreasonable risk of serious harm that the medically vulnerable Plaintiffs \nclass face in the Weld County Jail. \nAlso since last week’s filing, numerous people incarcerated in the Weld County Jail have \nstepped forward to share the reality of the dire conditions within the jail that made WCJ ripe for \nthe current COVID-19 outbreak.  For instance, two recently released individuals who were \ntrustees describe openly sick inmates being required to work in the kitchen, widespread failures \n \n2  See COVID-19 Case Data, COLORADO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH & ENVIRONMENT, \nhttps://covid19.colorado.gov/case-data (last viewed April 13, 2020). \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 8\nto follow CDC guidelines, and failures to provide basic information to inmates about the virus \nand its spread within the jail.  Exhibit 2, Declaration of Christopher Vecchiarelli; Exhibit 3, \nDeclaration of Ralph Brewer.   \nWhile conditions in WCJ have improved recently, medically vulnerable inmates continue \nto be held in lockdown status in cells with other people who have likely been exposed to the \nvirus.  As new evidence shows, in these cells, where inmates spend 23 or more hours a day, \nphysical distancing is impossible even with the recent changes made by WCJ.  Exhibit 4, \nDeclaration of Thomas Lewis; Exhibit 5, Declaration of Helen Griffith.  Further, WCJ has not \nsought to interview inmates to identify who is medically vulnerable or to give those inmates \nsingle cells. Ex. 4, p. 2; Ex. 5, p. 3.  As a result, medically vulnerable inmates, including \nPlaintiffs, are not able to practice the physical distancing that has the greatest chance of \nprotecting them from infection and, ultimately, death.    \nII.  Supplemental Authority \nSince this case was filed, courts have continued to issue rulings that recognize the dire \nneed for emergency action by courts, including by releasing incarcerated people who face a \nheightened risk of serious illness or death if they become infected.  These courts openly \nrecognize that the judiciary must act now or people will die.   \n1.  Swain, et al. v. Junior, et al., Case No.  20-cv-21457, Doc. 25 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 5, \n2020).  – Exhibit 6. \nOn April 4, 2020, a group of inmates in the Miami-Dade Jail filed a class action lawsuit \nseeking the immediate release of all incarcerated people who, like the putative Plaintiffs’ class in \nthe instant case, face a heighted risk of serious illness or death if they contract COVID-19. \nSwain, et al. v. Junior, et al., Case No.  20-cv-21457 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 5, 2020).  Two days later, on \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 8\nApril 7, the court issued a temporary restraining order requiring the jail to produce a list to the \ncourt of all medically-vulnerable inmates and to take numerous actions within the jail to come \ninto compliance with public health recommendations, including social distancing.  Ex. 6¸ p. 2.  \nIn granting this temporary relief, the judge did not hold a hearing and instead “accepted the \nallegations in the Complaint and its attachments as true without briefing or evidentiary \nsubmissions by the Defendants,” and noted “this Order does not make a finding of wrongdoing \non the part of any defendant and no defendant has waived any defenses to this action.”  Id., at 5.  \nWith this temporary protection in place, the court set a briefing schedule for the preliminary \ninjunction hearing now set for April 21.  Id. \n2.  New York v. Brann, et al., Index No. 451078/2020 (Sup. Ct, N.Y. County Apr. 6, \n2020) – Exhibit 7 \nOn April 6, 2020, the Supreme Court of New York County issued an order releasing \neighteen medically vulnerable pretrial detainees held at Rikers Island, because their continued \nincarceration in the facility, which had a known COVID-19 outbreak, violated the Due Process \nClause.  Ex. 7.  The court explained: \nCovid-19 is at large at Rikers Island. The current epidemic poses a deadly threat \nto inmates, and its presence at the prison equates to an \"unsafe, life-threatening \ncondition\" endangering \"reasonable safety.\" See Helling v. McKinney, 509 US at \n33, supra. Given such circumstances and the absence of a viable alternative, a \ncourt has no choice but to order release. Brown v. Plata, 563 US at 511, supra.  \n \nId., at 4.  Several of the individuals had been accused of serious, violent crimes, and the \ncourt found such accusations could not justify placing these individuals at “substantial \nrisk of death or other serious physical injury.”  Id., at 9.  The court also noted that, “it is \ncritically important to remember that petitioners have been convicted of nothing. They \ninstead face contested charges.”  Id., at 6.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 8\nIn finding that the jail officials had failed to take “reasonable care” to mitigate the \nrisk posed by COVID-19 to these medically vulnerable inmates, the court underscored \nthat it “does not at all question the good faith of the Rikers officials.”  Id., at 7. Still, the \ncourt concluded that the magnitude of the risk required release: \nDue process does not excuse prison officials who mean well, but have no \neffective way to protect inmates from potentially fatal epidemics. Again, prison \nofficials are obliged to take “reasonable care” to mitigate the risk posed by Covid-\n19. That is so especially for prisoners who can fairly expect extremely serious \nconsequences if they contract the disease. “Reasonable care” and “mitigation” \nobligations are not satisfied by tossing a bucket of water on a four-alarm house \nfire, or by placing a band-Aid on a compound bone fracture. Reasonable care to \nmitigate must include an effort to employ an effective ameliorative measure. As \nwould be expected when the Department of Corrections' own doctors ask for \nrelease, the escalating numbers of the infected show that what Rikers has done is \nnot remotely effective. Prisoners with dangerous conditions are dramatically at \nrisk. For some of them, only release can offer protection. \n \nId., at 7-8. \nThe court took this emergency action without waiting for a comprehensive \nevidentiary hearing, recognizing that the current reality of the COVID-19 public health \ncrisis requires courts to take protective action immediately, before such action risks being \nmooted out by serious illness or death:   \nThese are not normal times. Courthouses are almost completely closed. Staffing is \nshort — judges, court officers, court reporters, clerks, and IT employees. The \nability of Rikers Island officials to arrange internet conferences with inmates is \nvery limited. Medical records are not available. Expert medical witnesses are, to \nsay the least, occupied. But the claims of these petitioners, and hundreds of other \ninmates who believe they are in immediate danger, deserve to be treated as \nemergency questions for courts and other officials who can grant release. Perhaps \ntwo months from now, when the disease has abated, the courtrooms will reopen, \nweeks can be spent marshaling evidence, and cross-examinations can be \nconducted. But there is no time to wait — the issues will be moot. The court's \nconclusions about inmate conditions had to be based on the records available to \nthe parties, the lawyers' phone calls to busy experts, work on the internet, and \nSkype conversations held in the absence of affected petitioners. \n \nId., at 8-9.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 8\n3.

I am the executive director of Rock Found, a re-entry center in Greeley, Colorado \nthat helps people coming out of prison find housing, jobs, and the community they need to build \na meaningful life after incarceration. \n2.  A little over four years ago, I began working with Charles Peterson, who we \ncalled Charlie.  He had spent almost twenty years in prison until he was granted parole and an \nopportunity to build a new life. \n3.  During the course of the past four years, Charlie took up residence and work at \nRock Fund, and he became an important part of the Rock Fund family.  I knew him personally \nand well, and I believe he was entirely committed to building and sustaining a worthwhile life \nafter prison. \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 4\n4.  I am beyond sad that Charlie died ofCOVID-19 on Wednesday April 1,just two \ndays after being released from the Weld County Jail. \n5.  Charlie had been in jail since March 11 on a parole hold.  It was his first time \nbehind bars in the 4 years since he'd been released.  We at the Rock Fund had been doing all we \ncould to get him out of jail and were preparing to testify on his behalf at his upcoming hearing on \nMay 24.  But on Friday March 27, I received a call saying that there was a plan to release Charlie \nifhe could continue to stay at Rock Fund. Of course I said yes.  On Monday May 30, we were \ntold Charlie was ready for pickup.  I asked his Rock Fund roommate to pick Charlie up at the \nWeld County Jail. \n6.  A little while later, I got a call from Charlie's roommate saying something was \nwrong with Charlie, that he could barely walk.  Another of Charlie's roommates called to tell me \nCharlie is very sick, that he was cold and shivering.  I called the paramedics and let them know \nthat Charlie needed medical attention and had just been released from the Weld County Jail.  I \nhonestly could not believe that not a single person from the Weld County Jail had told anyone at \nRock Fund that they were releasing a seriously sick person into our care, especially in the midst \nof the COVID-19 crisis. \n7.  Charlie was immediately admitted into the hospital.  The next morning, on \n. Tuesday March 31, the doctor called me and said that Charlie was gravely ill and wanted to \nknow his end oflife wishes.  The next day, at around 11:30 a.m., Charlie died in the hospital. \n8.  The doctor told me that they suspected Charlie had COVID-19 based on a lung \nscan, but that they did not yet have the results of the COVID-19 test.  On Friday April 3, the \ndoctor called me with the news that Mr. Peterson was positive for COVID-19.  Charlies' two \nroommates  at Rock Fundwere immediately put under a quarantine order by Weld County. \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-1   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 4\n9.  I contacted Parole and let them know about Charlie dying and having COVID-19. \nThey assured me they would contact the Weld County Jail.  The Coroner's staff also informed \nmy staff that the virus and death would be reported to Weld County Jail. \n10.  We at Rock Fund are mourning the loss of our friend, our family member, Charlie \nPeterson.  We await the end of the COVID-19 crisis so that we can have an end of life \ncelebration for a man that worked so hard to redeem himself and create a better life. \n11.  I am so angry that Mr. Peterson got COVID-19 in the jail and even angrier that he \nwas released when he was on his death bed, without any notice to us that he was even sick.  I \nread in April 1 Greeley Tribune that the first Weld County inmate tested positive for COVID-19. \nThat individual was reported to be in the jail since sometime in 2018. So, I know that wasn't \nCharlie.  There has been nothing else in the paper about any other inmates testing positive in the \njail.  How could Weld County Jail have failed to tell the public and inmates and judges about \nCharlie's positive test and his ultimate death by the virus?  I fear for the health of other inmates \nin the Weld County Jail and the community to whom many will be released. \nExecuted this 10th day of April, 2020. \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-2   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 1 of 5\n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT 2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-2   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 5\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO \n \nCivil Action No.: 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH \n \nTHOMAS CARRANZA, et al. \n \n  Plaintiffs, on their own and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons, \n \nv. \n \nSTEVEN REAMS, Sheriff of Weld County, Colorado, in his official capacity, \n \n  Defendant. \n \n \nDECLARATION OF CHRISTOPHER VECCHIARELLI \n \n \nI, Christoper Vecchiarelli, declare under penalty of perjury under the law of \nColorado that the following is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and \ninformation: \n1.  My name is Christoper Vecchiarelli. I am over the age of twenty-one and \nam otherwise competent to testify. I make the following statements based upon my \npersonal knowledge. \n2.  I was incarcerated in the Weld County Jail starting on February 20, 2020 \nand was released on April 7, 2020. I was charged with driving while intoxicated. I was \nscheduled to be transferred to the work release program in March of 2020. Because the \nwork release program was shut down, I was not transferred and continued to be \nincarcerated until a few days ago. \n3.  While I was in the Weld County Jail, I saw firsthand the lack of response \nto the corona virus outbreak. Until April, the Weld County Jail did absolutely nothing to \nprotect inmates from the spread of the corona virus. It was business as usual. \n\t 1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-2   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 5\n4.  I learned about the corona virus outbreak from my wife. Even when there \nwas reporting in the Greeley Tribune that there were cases of corona virus in the Weld \nCounty Jail, deputies denied that there were and told inmates that the corona virus was \nnot in the jail. \n5.  In April, Weld County Jail instituted a twenty-three hour a day lockdown. \nEven with this lockdown, all inmates in a pod still intermingled within feet of each other \nduring the one hour a day we were let out into the common areas of the pod. \nAdditionally, all inmates shared common toilets, sinks, and showers. \n6.  In my pod, there were forty-two inmates. In my cell, even after the \nlockdown, there were eight inmates total in a ten foot by fifteen foot cell. It was \nimpossible to maintain a distance of six feet from other inmates. \n7.  While in the Weld County Jail, I obtained trustee status. As a trustee, my \njob was to work in the kitchen. I helped prepare meals and distribute them to other \ninmates from 12 p.m. to 7 p.m. every day. \n8.  As a trustee, I observed the food “safety” practices in the Weld County \nJail. In the kitchen, we were provided one hundred gloves per shift (of seven hours) for \ntwenty inmates. That meant that each inmate received, essentially, two sets of gloves per \nshift. If we asked for more gloves, the guards would deny our request. This meant that, \nwhen we brought food from pod to pod, we had to use the same gloves. There were also \ntimes when I was preparing food that I was forced to expose my bare forearms to food. \nWhen I was tasked with mixing salad for all of the inmates, the guards provided me with \nan industrial sized bowl and no utensils to mix the salad. The guards told me to reach my \narm, up to my forearm, to mix the salad.  \n\t 2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-2   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 5\n9.  Additionally, while working in the kitchen, I saw one trustee become \nseverely ill and be forced to keep preparing food. That inmate had shortness of breath and \nvomiting for over a week, and he was forced to continue preparing food for all of the \ninmates in the jail. It was only after he passed out on the job on April 5, 2020, that he was \nallowed to stop working in the kitchen. \n10.  In fact, there were a number of inmates who were working in the kitchen \nwith me, up until I left in April, that were sick and actively displaying symptoms of \ncorona virus. They continued to prepare food. \n11.  As a trustee, I also observed the sanitation and hygiene practices in the \njail. I saw that the hygiene practices did not change from before the outbreak. The shared \ntoilets and sinks continued to be cleaned only once weekly, even in April after the \nlockdown. Even after the lockdown, inmates did not have access to hand sanitizes, lysoll \nwipes, or bleach. Trustees would use the same industrial cleaner that came out of the mop \ndispenser in the closet to clean other surfaces. Even after the lockdown, cells were not \ncleaned. \n12.  I also witnessed multiple guards tell anyone they saw with a mask to take \nit off. Masks were only provided to kitchen staff on April 6, 2020. Before that, inmates \nwere preparing food without masks on. \n13.  When I was in the jail I saw many inmates displaying symptoms of corona \nvirus. It seemed like a lot of inmates started getting sick in the beginning of March. \nDespite the fact that there were a large number of inmates who were sick, none of these \ninmates were quarantined. And, none of these inmates were tested for the virus. \n\t\n\t 3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-2   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 5\n14.  The only thing that guards asked inmates to ascertain whether they had \ncorona virus was whether they had hiccups. Multiple guards asked me this question every \nday and told me that hiccups were a telltale sign that someone had the corona virus. \n15.  1 also started having symptoms of corona virus and was not tested. This \nincluded shortness of breath and coughing. I continued working in the kitchen until the \nday I was released. I am a vulnerable person for corona virus as I have damage to my \nlungs from multiple pulmonary embolisms. I am currently seeking treatment for my \nsymptoms and testing for the virus. \nChristopher Vecchiarelli \n\t\n\t 4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-3   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 1 of 6\n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT 3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-3   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 6\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO \n \nCivil Action No.: 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH \n \nTHOMAS CARRANZA, et al. \n \n  Plaintiffs, on their own and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons, \n \nv. \n \nSTEVEN REAMS, Sheriff of Weld County, Colorado, in his official capacity, \n \n  Defendant. \n \n \nDECLARATION OF RALPH BREWER \n \n \nI, Ralph Brewer, declare under penalty of perjury under the law of Colorado that \nthe following is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and information: \n1.  My name is Ralph Brewer. I am over the age of twenty-one and am \notherwise competent to testify. I make the following statements based upon my personal \nknowledge. \n2.  I was incarcerated in the Weld County jail beginning on February 7, 2020 \nuntil I was released from my sentence ten days early, on April 3, 2020.  During that time, \nI was serving a 90-day sentence.   \n3.  At some point in early March, I was transferred to Larimer County jail for \na hearing on another case.  Upon return to Weld County jail, I was told by the guard in \nthe intake pod that I would need to be placed in quarantine for 14 days due to my \npotential exposure to the virus while outside of the Weld County jail.  The “quarantine” \npod was the intake pod, also called the M pod.   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-3   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 6\n4.  I was told that being in quarantine meant that I would be in the cell with \npeople who had come in on that same day or someone I had been housed with before.  In \nother words, I wound not be housed with new people.   \n5.  In fact, my “quarantine” only lasted 5 days and during that time I was \nmoved around to several different cells and housed with many people who I had never \nseen before, including, at one point, two guys who had come in straight from the street on \na different day than me.  \n6.  We had to do everything in our cells, including eat our meals.  There was \nno soap in our cell for at least the first 2-3 days. We had to continuously ask for more \nhygiene products, including soap.    \n7.  When my “quarantine” ended early, I was told it was because the intake \npod was full, and they needed the space for new people.  \n8.  I had previously applied to be a trustee so that I could earn “good time” \nand be released early.  I had been approved for trustee status, so around March 23, 2020, \nI was moved directly from the quarantine pod (9 days early) to the pod that housed all the \njail’s trustees, called the TM pod.   \n9.  In the TM pod, the inmates had to clean the bathrooms, including sinks, \nshowers and toilets, and all the surfaces in the shared day room.  The bathroom and the \nday room were used by approximately 35 inmates.  The only supplies we were given was \na broom, a mop, a mop bucket and some kind of spray.  When I asked for gloves to use \nwhile cleaning, I was told, “those are not available to the inmates.”   \n10.  Upon becoming a trustee, I was immediately assigned to work in the \nkitchen.  My shift was every day from 12:30-7:00.  I prepped food, prepared food trays, \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-3   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 6\nand washed dishes.  The only protection we were provided were gloves and a beard net.  I \nwas never given a mask.   \n11.  After about four or five days of working in the kitchen, I began to feel \nsick.  I was tired all the time and would only get out of bed to go to work in the kitchen.  I \nbegan to feel like I had bronchitis in my chest.    \n12.  I was so nauseous all the time that I stopped eating most of my meals and \nwould give my tray of food away to the other inmates.   \n13.  When the nurses came around to distribute medications, I explained my \nsymptoms and was given Tylenol twice a day and some cough medicine.  The medical \nstaff was always complaining about how many inmates were in the med line and how \nmuch work they had to do.   \n14.  I told one nurse that I wanted to have my lungs checked because I was \nfeeling so sick and I really did not think that I could go to work.  She said that she would \ncome back and check on me.  She never returned.   \n15.  I repeatedly told the guards that I did not think that I could go to work \nbecause I really needed to rest.  I was told by more than one guard that if I was not \nrunning a fever then I needed to be in the kitchen because they were short staffed.  \n16.  I submitted kites seeking medical attention and the response that I \nreceived was that I should, “drink more fluids.”   \n17.  That same week, while working in the kitchen, I told Jen, the Aramark \nemployee who runs the kitchen, that I was feeling very sick and nauseous.  She blew me \noff, saying, “well, if you throw up, just don’t flush the toilet so we can see it.” \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-3   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 6\n18.  During a walk-through, I told a guard that I really needed to see a nurse.  \nThe guard said that “if he had time” he would try to get a nurse to come check on me.  I \nsaw that guard later and complained again about not seeing a nurse.  The guard said that \nhe “forgot.”  \n19.  Finally, on April 3, 2020, I saw the same guard and complained again that \nI still had not seen a nurse.  I told him that I was really sick and upset and was going to \nfile a grievance against medical if I did not get some help.  The guard assured me that he \nwould get someone to come check on me.  \n20.  About two hours later, I was called out of the kitchen.  I thought that I was \nfinally going to see medical about my condition.  Instead, I was told that I was being \nreleased ten days early.   \n21.  My daughter picked me up from the jail and took me directly to urgent \ncare.  They told me that I have the symptoms of Covid-19 and prescribed me medication.  \nThey told me to quarantine myself for the next 14 days, which I am doing at my mother’s \nhouse in Fruita, Colorado.  \n22.  Despite my efforts, I have not been able to obtain a test for the \ncoronavirus.  \n            s/ Ralph Brewer  \n            ___________________________ \n            Ralph Brewer  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-3   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 6\n  I, Sara R.

My name is Thomas Lewis and I am a plaintiff in this case.  I am over the \nage of twenty-one and am otherwise competent to testify.  I make the following \nstatements based upon my personal knowledge. \n2.  I have been incarcerated in the Weld County jail since January 3, 2020.  I \ncannot afford to pay the bond that is set, so I will continue to be held in the Weld County \njail until at least my next court appearance in late May 2020.    \n3.  I am 60 years-old and have vitiligo, which is an immune deficiency \ndisease.  Both my age and my disease make me particularly vulnerable to suffering \nsevere effects from Covid-19.  I am very worried about contracting the disease in the jail \nbecause of the lack of precautions that have been taken by the jail and my inability to \nproperly physically distance myself from other inmates and guards.  \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-4   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 4\n4.  Since the beginning of my incarceration, I have been housed in cell \nnumber 11 inside Pod C.  My cell is approximately 8 feet by 10 feet.  I currently share \nmy cell with two other inmates.  One of the other inmates in my cell is Richard Barnum, \nanother plaintiff in this case, who has Hepatitis C and kidney disease. \n5.  Weld County put the inmates on 23- and 1-hour lockdown beginning on \nApril 1, 2020.  Based on the size of the cell and the configuration of the desks and bunk \nbeds, we cannot physically distance ourselves six feet away from each other while in the \ncell.  Therefore, for 23 hours per day, I am unable to practice the CDC recommended \nphysical distancing.  I am on the bottom bunk and at least one other another inmate is on \nthe bunk right above me, about 1-2 feet away.  \n6.  Medical staff comes around twice a day.  Each time I obtain Tylenol from \nthe medical staff for headaches.   \n7.  Neither Weld County jail staff nor medical staff has ever asked me about \nwhether I have underlying medical conditions that put me at a higher risk for serious \nillness for COVID-19.   \n8.  Despite being 60 years-old and of higher risk to the disease, the only time \nthat I have had my temperature taken is when I affirmatively requested it because I was \ndeveloping a cough and was scared I had contracted the virus.  The medical staff never \nfollowed up with me to see if I was ok or if my symptoms got any worse.  Medical staff \nhas only offered to take my temperature one other time, which was around approximately \nApril 1, 2020.  \n9.  Since the lockdown started on April 1, 2020, we have been required to eat \nall our meals in our cell.  At mealtime, two inmates sit at the desks in our cell and one sits \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-4   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 4\non their bunk.  The inmates who are sitting at the desks eating are essentially sitting \nshoulder to shoulder with the inmate on the bunk.  \n10.  In Pod C, where I am housed, we share the bathrooms with about 50 other \ninmates.   If I want to use cleaner when I go to the bathroom, I have to ask the deputy at \nthe desk for the bottle of cleaner and check it out by providing the deputy with my inmate \nID card which the deputy then returns to me when I bring back the bottle of cleaner.  \n11.  I have never been encouraged by any guards to wipe down or clean the \ntoilet or other bathroom surfaces before or after I use them.  I don’t see other inmates \nregularly wiping down surfaces in the bathrooms.  In fact, inmates from different cells are \noften in there for 5-10 minutes talking with each other in close proximity.   \n12.  When I use the phone in the day room, I almost never see other inmates \ncleaning it after they use it.  \n            s/ Thomas Lewis  \n            __________________________   \n            Thomas Lewis \n             \n  I, Sara R.

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO \n \nCivil Action No.: 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-MEH \n \nTHOMAS CARRANZA, et al. \n \n  Plaintiffs, on their own and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons, \n \nv. \n \nSTEVEN REAMS, Sheriff of Weld County, Colorado, in his official capacity, \n \n  Defendant. \n \n \nDECLARATION OF HELEN GRIFFITHS \n \n \nI, Helen Griffiths, declare under penalty of perjury under the law of Colorado that the following is \ntrue and correct to the best of my knowledge and information: \n1.  My name is Helen Griffiths.  I am over the age of twenty-one and am otherwise \ncompetent to testify.  I make the following statements based upon my personal knowledge. \n2.  I am employed as Public Policy Associate at the American Civil Liberties Union of \nColorado (ACLU).  As part of my job, I sometimes assist in case investigations for the ACLU’s legal \ndepartment under the supervision of an ACLU attorney.   \n3.  On April 10, 2020, I worked under the supervision of ACLU attorney, Sara Neel, to assist \nin investigating facts related to this litigation.  In that capacity, I conducted telephone interviews of six \ninmates incarcerated in the Weld County jail and asked them about conditions in the jail as of April 10.   \n4.  In the remainder of this declaration, unless I indicate otherwise, I summarize the portions \nof those six conversations that were consistent between three or more of the inmates with whom who I \ntalked.  \n5.  All interviewed inmates said adequate physical distancing in the current conditions of the \njail was impossible.  Several inmates stated that the only way for feasible physical distancing would \nrequire single occupancy cells.   \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-5   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 4\n \n6.  In the average cell, there are three to four inmates, and bunk beds are three beds high. \nThe beds are only a few feet from each other.  The Weld County jail currently does not assign inmates to \nsleep on the top bunk.  Inmates sleep on the bottom two bunks, only a few feet away from inmates \nsleeping on the bottom beds of a neighboring bunk.  Due to the 23-hour per day lockdown, the three to \nfour inmates in the cell live, sleep and eat within a few feet of each other. \n7.  In some cells, there are healthy people and sick people bunking right next to each other.  \n8.  New inmates are moving into general population after only a 5- to 8-day quarantine \nperiod.   \n9.  There is no room for social distancing in the bathrooms.  From one sink to another, there \nis less than a foot.  The urinals are right next to each other.  There are four toilets and four urinals for an \nentire pod of 40 or more people to use.  There are no accommodations made for physical distancing in the \nbathroom.    \n10.  Physical distancing is often not possible even when outside the cell.  That is the time \nwhen inmates can use the phone, which has them sitting shoulder-to-shoulder.  While out in the common \nspaces, inmates line up to receive meals and medication.  While in those lines, 8-12 inmates stand right \nnext to each other.  When serving themselves drinks, the inmates do not have gloves.  They all touch the \nsame juice container and pour it into the same cup to measure the amount of drink they are allowed.  \n11.  There is limited and irregular cleaning in the jail.  The toilets and sinks are generally not \ndisinfected between use.  Several inmates referenced objects such as the hot water dispenser button and \nkiosk that are regularly touched but rarely, if ever, cleaned between uses.  \n12.  The Weld County jail has made it difficult for inmates to practice proper hygiene.  In \norder to wash their hands, inmates must be allowed out of their cells to use the bathroom.  There are no \nhygiene options in many of the cells.  \n13.  While inmates did receive masks very recently, they were told the mask they were given \nis the only mask they are allowed.  They are only allowed to do laundry once a week.    \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-5   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 4\n14. The Weld County jail staff has not sought to determine whether inmates have underlying\nmedical conditions that make them a higher risk for serious illness or death for COVID-19.  The staff is \nnot interviewing inmates to determine who is high risk.  The staff are not taking any special precautions \nto protect people who are older or have underlying health conditions from getting the virus.  Medically \nvulnerable people are treated just the same as every other inmate. \n15. Some inmates are not having their temperature taken daily and are not being asked if they\nhave COVID-19 symptoms.  Instead, some guards ask inmates to come forward if they think they have \nsymptoms.  Inmates are told that if they feel sick, they should fill out a kite and wait for “med line” so \nthat a nurse can take their temperature.  \n16. Inmates have not been informed of the number of cases of COVID-19 there are in the\nWeld County jail.  Inmates are required to ask guards and to rely on second-hand information. \n17. Inmates are concerned that guards do not take the threat of COVID-19 seriously.  The\nguards often congregate to talk and do not practice proper physical distancing.  During cell inspections, \ninmates say only some guards wear gloves and they do not change gloves between rooms.  Guards spent \nweeks dismissing potential COVID-19 symptoms of guards and inmates, and claiming it was just a \ntypical cold circulating throughout the jail.  \n18. The conditions in the Weld County jail exacerbate the potential spread of COVID-19.  At\nleast three inmates expressed with utter certainty that, “If nothing is done, someone will die in here.” \nSigned this day April 13, 2020 \n___________________________________ \nHelen Griffiths \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-6   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 1 of 7\n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT 6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-6   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 7\nCase 1:20-cv-21457-KMW   Document 25   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/07/2020   Page 1 of 6\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA \nCase No.: 1:20-cv-21457-KMW \nANTHONY SWAIN, et al., \nPlaintiffs, \nv. \nDANIEL JUNIOR, et al., \n           Defendants. \n                                                     / \nORDER GRANTING IN PART PLAINTIFFS’ EMERGENCY MOTION FOR A \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n \n  THIS MATTER is before the Court on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining \nOrder (DE 3).

Each petitioner faces one or more charges in New York County. Many are also \nincarcerated pending hearings on alleged parole violations. Their complaint concerns the Covid-\n19 pandemic. Petitioners contend that they are particularly vulnerable to serious injury and death \nshould they contract the disease. And they assert that prisoners at Rikers are dangerously likely \nto contract it, to the point that continued confinement there violates their due process rights under \nthe federal and state constitutions. \nThe only relief sought is release. The court will grant release, sometimes with conditions, to \na fair number of petitioners. This opinion explains why. But this opinion will not do two other \nthings. It will not describe the nature of the Covid-19 pandemic, as it is far too [*2]familiar to \nNew Yorkers already. And it will deal with the circumstances of individual petitioners only \nbriefly, as examples to explain particular points. \nA \nThe health of prison inmates is the business of governments who incarcerate them. Indeed, \nit has long been settled that the United States Constitution requires the government to provide \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-7   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 11\neffective medical care for inmates. Brown v. Plata, 563 US 493, 508-09 (2011); Farmer v. \nBrennan, 511 US 825, 832-33 (1994); Estelle v. Gamble, 429 US 97 (1976). These decisions \ninvolved convicted prisoners, and were decided under the Eighth Amendment. But the Due \nProcess protections of the 5th and 14th Amendments and of the New York Constitution provide \ncomparable protection to pretrial inmates. See, e.g., Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 576 US ___ \n(2015); Cooper v. Marin, 49 NY2d 69 (1979). That makes sense, as it could not be thought that \npretrial detainees should enjoy less protection than convicted inmates. Contemporary law as to \nthe rights of all prisoners simply \"codif[ies] the commonlaw view that 'it is but just that the \npublic be required to care for the prisoner, who cannot by reason of the deprivation of his liberty, \ncare for himself.'\" Estelle v. Gamble, 429 US at 103-04, supra. \nTo invoke the federal due process clause successfully, a petitioner may establish that the \ngovernment's actions impose a serious, medically threatening condition on prisoners. \nAlternatively, and to the point here, the petitioner may show that the government failed to act \n\"with reasonable care\" to mitigate a risk created by a seriously threatening prison condition, even \nthough the responsible authorities knew or should have known that the condition posed an \nexcessive risk to the health or safety of the inmates. Helling v. McKinney, 509 US 25, 331-32 \n(1993). The cases differ on precisely how to interpret the mens rea requirement, and in particular \non whether the prison officials must be aware of the danger. Compare Darnell v Pineiro, 849 \nF3d 17 (2nd Cir 2017) with Caiozzo v. Koreman, 581 F3d 63 (2nd Cir 2009). But the issue is \nmoot here. There is no doubt that Rikers officials are aware of the Covid-19 threat. The New \nYork due process test is simpler. A court weighs the benefit sought by the government from a \ncondition against the harm that the condition imposes on inmates. Cooper v. Morin, 49 NY2d at \n79, supra. \nIf the government cannot satisfy the due process requirement, the court must accord a \nremedy — including, where appropriate, release from prison. Brown v. Plata, 563 US at \n511, supra. Courts \"must not shrink from their obligation to 'enforce the constitutional rights of \nall , including prisoners.' Courts may not allow constitutional violations to continue simply \nbecause a remedy would involve intrusion into the realm of prison administration.\" Id. (citation \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-7   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 11\nomitted). Notably, Brown itself approved an order requiring the release of numerous convicted \nCalifornia prisoners unless the state quickly relieved long-standing prison overcrowding \nthat, inter alia, threatened the health of the inmates. \nThere can be no doubt that the presence of a communicable disease in a prison can \nconstitute a serious, medically threatening condition. The point need not be belabored in this \ncase. Covid-19 is at large at Rikers Island. The current epidemic poses a deadly threat to inmates, \nand its presence at the prison equates to an \"unsafe, life-threatening condition\" endangering \n\"reasonable safety.\" See Helling v. McKinney, 509 US at 33, supra. Given such circumstances \nand the absence of a viable alternative, a court has no choice but to order release. Brown v. Plata, \n563 US at 511, supra. \nRespondents do not deny that much. They assert, however, that Corrections officials at \nRikers Island have not been \"deliberately indifferent\" to the danger. To the contrary, they \nmaintain, officials at Rikers have sought diligently to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 disease \namong the inmates. They assert that they have provided soap and cleaning supplies that allow \npetitioners and their fellow prisoners to protect themselves from the virus. They also urge the \ninmates to engage in \"social distancing,\" i.e., to maintain a distance of six feet between \nthemselves and other inmates. Some inmates have been released with the consent of the District \nAttorney. Thus, respondents assert, they have satisfied the constitutional mandate by taking \n\"reasonable care\" to mitigate the risk of the disease. It follows, they continue, that no due process \nviolation has occurred, and no remedy is due petitioners. \n \n \nB \nThis court disagrees. A look at the conditions at Rikers Island explains why. \nFirst, communicable diseases could not ask for a better breeding ground than a crowded \nprison. Rikers facilities are crowded. Prisoners eat in communal dining rooms. Cooking is done \nby inmates and the food is dished out by inmates. Entertainment is found in common rooms. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-7   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 11\nMany detainees reside in barracks-style dormitories. Many have a neighbor who sleeps less than \nsix feet to the side. The inmates share sinks, showers, and toilets. Much of the space is so \ncramped that the inmates are physically unable to stay far enough from their fellow prisoners to \nbe safe from the risk of contagion. Moreover, for many prisoners, a natural concomitant of \nconfinement is a desire to associate in groups with one another. They communicate face-to-face, \nwithout the luxury of Skype or twitter. And, as elsewhere, even individuals without apparent \nCovid-19 symptoms can spread disease in all these areas and situations. \nBeyond that, inmates in a local urban jail like Rikers are constantly exposed to additional \npotential sources of contagion. Arrests do not stop for a plague. New inmates arrive daily from \naround New York City. Every day, members of the prison staff commute to the prison from their \nhomes in the city and its nearby suburbs. Until the epidemic hit this city, on five days a week \ninmates were taken in crowded and unsanitary buses to crowded and unsanitary courthouse \nholding pens. \nSecond, these conditions have produced the results one might expect. Diagnoses of the \ndisease are \"spiking\" at Rikers — exponentially. As of March 20 it had reported that one case of \nthe disease had been diagnosed at the prison. On March 21, 21 inmates and 17 members of the \nstaff were reported ill from the virus, and one member of the staff was dead. By March 24, the \nday the petition was filed, there were a reported 39 cases. By April 1, 184 prisoners and 179 \nmembers of the staff were ill. As this opinion is being issued, the most recent report is that on \nApril 2 there were 231 sick prisoners, in addition to 223 sick staff members. The rate of increase \nis about 5 times higher than that of New York City in general — and the rate in New York City, \nthe national \"epicenter\" of Covid-19, has dramatically exceeded that of the rest of the country. \nThe New York City Board of Correction, established by the City Charter, is an independent \noversight board charged with regulating, monitoring, and inspecting the city's correctional \nfacilities. On March 21 the Board issued an advisory letter to judges and prosecutors calling for \nthe release of prisoners over 50 years old who have conditions placing [*3]them at high risk if \nthey contract Covid-19. Many of the petitioners are among those at risk. The Board's plea has \nsince been joined by Ross MacDonald, the Chief Medical Officer of the Correctional Health \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-7   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 11\nServices, and Rachel Bernard, a geriatrician at Rikers. For whatever it might be worth, the press \nreports that inmates feel helpless, with some suggesting that they are facing a \"death sentence.\" \nAnd it is critically important to remember that petitioners have been convicted of nothing. They \ninstead face contested charges. \nUnder the best of circumstances, there are far better places to be than Rikers Island. And \nthese are not the best of circumstances. \n \n \nC \nBefore the law is applied to the facts of this case, one final point should be made. The \nexperts agree on the best practices to avoid the Covid-19 virus — frequent hand-washing, \ncovering coughs and sneezes, social distancing, and so on. They also agree on this critical factor: \nthe individuals who catch the disease face differing consequences. It was originally thought that \nthe young rarely were in serious danger from the disease. That conclusion is now subject to \nserious doubt. But the experts agree that certain pre-existing conditions are aggravators. \nAge is among them. Different estimates are given — age 50, 60, 65, 70 — as to when the \ncalendar presents a special threat of harm from the virus. The current CDC number is 65. The \ndifferent estimates are natural enough. Unlike the law, nature and its diseases do not respect a \nbright line crossed on a particular birthday. But it is agreed that infected individuals of a \nrelatively advanced age are likely to suffer more than the young. \nAge is not often thought of as a disease. The other conditions classified as aggravators are. \nCovid-19 attacks the respiratory system. Accordingly, pre-existing respiratory inhibitors like \nserious asthma or chronic lung disease can complicate a patient's Covid-19 symptoms. \nCombating the virus is a task for the immune system, and those afflicted with HIV or another \ncondition that weakens the immune system can be at special risk. Covid-19 puts a strain on the \nheart, and therefore serious heart conditions can expose an individual to extra danger. Diabetics \nand those afflicted with some other diseases may have issues on more than one of these fronts. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-7   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 11\nPetitioners do not argue that it violates due process to hold at Rikers a young prisoner who \nhas no aggravating conditions. Instead, each contends that, while infection at Rikers is quite \nlikely for all inmates, for those with aggravators the danger after Covid-19 strikes is much \ngreater than the danger facing their fellows. Each petitioner claims to have one or more \naggravating conditions. And each concludes that holding him or her at Rikers, where the \nprospect of Covid-19 infection is so great, must be deemed a violation of his or her rights. \n \n \nD \nThe stage is set for consideration of how due process principles apply here. Respondents \nassert that they have taken \"reasonable care\" to mitigate the risk posed by Covid-19, and thus \nhave satisfied the due process mandate. This court disagrees. \nThis judge does not at all question the good faith of the Rikers officials. Certainly \nno [*4]American prison is equipped to deal with a health crisis of the severity of this one. Rikers \nhas medical facilities, but it is not a hospital — and this epidemic is a fierce challenge even for \nour hospitals. A crowded prison, for example, has no ability to quarantine the large number of \nprisoners exposed to inmates who eventually display symptoms. Indeed, in this case that would \nessentially mean a quarantine of everyone at the prison, inmates and staff. There certainly are not \nthe necessary kits to administer tests for the disease to all inmates, much less the repeated tests \nrequired to assess their condition at subsequent times. And the ability to allow adequate distance \nto be maintained among detainees and staff is decisively precluded by the nature of prison \nconstruction and operation — as noted, for example, barracks-like sleeping quarters and \ncommunal dining. Even hand sanitizer, now a staple tool for preventing spread of the disease, \ncannot be employed: its alcohol content makes it contraband, a danger to prisoners who might \ndrink it and to guards who, because the alcohol content is high, fear that it can we used as a \nweapon. \nDue process does not excuse prison officials who mean well, but have no effective way to \nprotect inmates from potentially fatal epidemics. Again, prison officials are obliged to take \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-7   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 11\n\"reasonable care\" to mitigate the risk posed by Covid-19. That is so especially for prisoners who \ncan fairly expect extremely serious consequences if they contract the disease. \"Reasonable care\" \nand \"mitigation\" obligations are not satisfied by tossing a bucket of water on a four-alarm house \nfire, or by placing a band-Aid on a compound bone fracture. Reasonable care to mitigate must \ninclude an effort to employ an effective ameliorative measure. As would be expected when the \nDepartment of Corrections' own doctors ask for release, the escalating numbers of the infected \nshow that what Rikers has done is not remotely effective. Prisoners with dangerous conditions \nare dramatically at risk. For some of them, only release can offer protection. \nAt this point, the court has ruled that 18 petitioners are in this category. (A few other \npetitioners have been released on consent or on bail). All 18 are afflicted with conditions \nacknowledged to endanger them: heart disease, serious respiratory conditions, cancer, diabetes, \nuncontrolled HIV, and so forth. For some of them, the condition or conditions are more \ndangerous because those prisoners are relatively old. Those 18 petitioners have been ordered \nreleased. \nFor others, the petition has been denied. Some of the inmates are between 50 and 60 years \nold, and have nothing beyond that to suggest that they are in more danger than the average \ninmate. This judge does not believe that to be sufficient to justify release. One petitioner also has \nglaucoma; that ocular condition is not reported to complicate Covid-19. One has HIV, but the \ncondition is well controlled. The petitioner's viral count is easily low enough, and the T-cell \ncount high enough, to take the condition out of the category of an enhanced threat. One petitioner \nwas convincingly shown by his medical history to be a malingerer, in no special danger at all. \nThese are not normal times. Courthouses are almost completely closed. Staffing is short — \njudges, court officers, court reporters, clerks, and IT employees. The ability of Rikers Island \nofficials to arrange internet conferences with inmates is very limited. Medical records are not \navailable. Expert medical witnesses are, to say the least, occupied. But the claims of these \npetitioners, and hundreds of other inmates who believe they are in immediate danger, deserve \nto [*5]be treated as emergency questions for courts and other officials who can grant release. \nPerhaps two months from now, when the disease has abated, the courtrooms will reopen, weeks \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-7   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 11\ncan be spent marshaling evidence, and cross-examinations can be conducted. But there is no time \nto wait — the issues will be moot. The court's conclusions about inmate conditions had to be \nbased on the records available to the parties, the lawyers' phone calls to busy experts, work on \nthe internet, and Skype conversations held in the absence of affected petitioners. \nThree final notes should be made. First, for a court to order a release of prisoners on \naccount of a due process violation is \"a matter of undoubted, grave concern.\" Brown v. Plata, \n563 US at 501, supra. Still, this judge does not believe that release can be denied even to those \ncharged with violent crimes if they are at substantial risk of death or other serious physical \ninjury. Such inmates have the same due process rights as others. They may be treated differently \nfrom others, even in a pretrial context. Some can be shackled. Some can be subjected to unusual \nintrusions on privacy. Some can be isolated from other inmates. Even under New York law, \nsome charges justify assessments of dangerousness that can lead to higher bail or remand. But \nthese prisoners cannot be punished with the unnecessary exposure to a highly communicable, \nand for them a potentially deadly, disease. Thus, one of the inmates ordered released is a man \nwho is over 60, suffers from very serious heart conditions, has a chronic obstructive pulmonary \ncondition as well as asthma, is diabetic — and is charged with a vicious murder. \nSecond, and relatedly, what has been ordered for petitioners is temporary release. No \ncharges are being dismissed. The inmates facing criminal charges will still face those charges. \nThe inmates on parole will remain on parole, and the relevant parole violation allegations can be \npursued. Moreover, the court has agreed with restrictions on release suggested by the \ngovernment. For example, for some petitioners home confinement except for visits to mental \nhealth services has been directed. The petitioners cannot legitimately complain; at least they will \nnot be confined on Rikers Island. \nFinally, the petition sought relief only on the ground that the petitioners are in special \ndanger if they become infected. Nothing in this opinion necessarily applies to how inmates \nwithout such conditions should be treated. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-7   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 11\n \n \nENTER: \n \n \nDated: New York, New York \n \nApril 6, 2020 \n \n________________________ \n \nMark Dwyer, J. \n \n \nAppearances of Counsel: \n \nReturn to Decision List  \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-8   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 1 of 12\n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT 8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-8   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 12\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF ALASKA \n \n   \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,  Case No. 3:94-cr-00036-TMB \n   \nPlaintiff,   \n   \nv.

INTRODUCTION  \nThe matter comes before the Court on Defendant Gerald Frank Plunk’s Motion for \nReduction of Sentence to Time Served and Compassionate Release from Prison Under 18 U.S.C. \n§ 3582(c)(1)(A)(i)(ii) (the “Motion”).1 The Government filed an Unopposed Motion for Stay in \nresponse and requested a telephonic status conference.2 The Motion for Stay was granted and a \ntelephonic status conference set for April 9, 2020.3 Before the status conference, the Government \nfiled a Response to Motion for Sentence Reduction-Conditional Non-Opposition (“Response”).4 \nNow, having held the status conference and lifted the stay, the Motion is ripe for resolution. For \nthe reasons discussed below, the Motion is GRANTED. \n \n1 Dkt. 711 (Motion). \n2 Dkt. 724 (Motion). \n3 Dkt. 726 (Text Order). \n4 Dkt. 727 (Response). \n1 \n \nCase 3:94-cr-00036-TMB   Document 733   Filed 04/09/20   Page 1 of 11\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-8   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 12\nII.  BACKGROUND \nDefendant has been in federal custody since his voluntary surrender on March 25, 1994.5 \nHe was tried and found guilty of one count of Conspiracy to Distribute Cocaine in violation of \n21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 846, four counts of Use of a Communications Facility in violation of \n21 U.S.C.§ 843(b), and one count of Possession of Cocaine with Intent to Distribute in violation \nof 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).6 On November 18, 1996, Judge John W. Sedwick sentenced Defendant \nto two concurrent life terms under the then-mandatory sentencing guidelines.7  \nOn September 4, 2019, Defendant filed “Defendant’s Pro Se Motion for Reduction of \nSentence and Release from Prison Under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A)(i)” (“Pro Se Motion”).8 \nDefendant signed the Pro Se Motion under “Pro Se Representation” and reaffirmed his alleged pro \nse status in the attached Certification of Service.9 On September 6, 2019, defense counsel filed \n“Counsel’s Notice of Joinder to Motion to Reduce Sentence (Dkt 703),” in which Attorney \nWeidner notifies the Court that he represents Defendant and joins in Defendant’s Motion for \nRelease.10  The  Court  explained  that  Defendant  cannot  file  on  his  own  behalf  while  he  is \nrepresented by counsel and denied the Pro Se Motion without prejudice.11 Defendant, through \ncounsel, did not refile any motion seeking to reduce his sentence until the present Motion. \n \n5 Id. at 9.  \n6 Id. at 9‒10. \n7 Id. at 10. \n8 Dkt. 703 (Motion). \n9 Id. at 9, 11. \n10 Dkt. 704 (Notice of Joinder). \n11 Dkt. 709 (Order). \n2 \n \nCase 3:94-cr-00036-TMB   Document 733   Filed 04/09/20   Page 2 of 11\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-8   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 12\nOn April 1 2020, Defendant filed the Motion requesting the Court reduce his sentence to \ntime served and granting compassionate release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A)(i) and (ii).12 \nDefendant argues for release based on both “extraordinary and compelling reasons” and “his age, \nmedical condition and length of incarceration . . . as well as the dangers he now faces as an inmate \n. . . due to the ongoing national COVID-19 Pandemic and [his] status as a ‘potential high risk \nvictim’ given his advanced age and medical condition.” \nThe Government initially responded by filing a Motion for Stay.13 The Motion for Stay \nexplains that the parties are “discussing the merits of the substantive motions and have been \nattempting to arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution.”14 The Government further represents \nthat “[t]his matter is currently before the Deputy Attorney General for consideration” and that \n“[w]ithin the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney, District of Alaska, does not have \nfinal  authority,  without  designation  or  authorization  to  settle  the  pending  matter.”15  The \nGovernment then filed the Response, which states that the Government has considered the merits \nof the Motion and concludes that it does not oppose Defendant’s release on certain conditions.16  \nOn April 9, 2020, at the joint request of the Parties, the Court held a telephonic status \nconference. During the conference, the Parties explained that they had reached an amicable \nresolution and jointly recommended release. Furthermore, the Court made oral rulings from the \nbench denying Defendant’s Request for Assignment to Judge John W. Sedwick and/or Voluntary \n \n12 Dkt. 711 at 1. \n13 Dkt. 724. \n14 Id. at 2. \n15 Id. \n16 Dkt. 727 at 3‒4. \n3 \n \nCase 3:94-cr-00036-TMB   Document 733   Filed 04/09/20   Page 3 of 11\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-8   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 12\nRecusal of Judge Timothy M. Burgess and lifting the stay that was previously granted on the \nGovernment’s Unopposed Motion for Stay.17 \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nThe First Step Act amended 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A) to allow a defendant to move the \ndistrict court for compassionate release after exhausting the Bureau of Prisons’ administrative \nprocess.18 Then, after considering the applicable factors set forth in § 3553(a), the court may grant \nthe motion if it finds that: \n(i) extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a reduction; or  \n \n(ii) the defendant is at least 70 years of age, has served at least 30 years in prison, \npursuant to a sentence imposed under section 3559(c), for the offense or offenses \nfor which the defendant is currently imprisoned, and a determination has been made \nby the Director of the Bureau of Prisons that the defendant is not a danger to the \nsafety of any other person or the community, as provided under section 3142(g);  \n \nand that such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by \nthe Sentencing Commission. \n \nIV.  ANALYSIS \nEven though Defendant moves for release under both prongs of 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), \nthe Court finds that the extraordinary and compelling reasons of the first prong suffice to grant \nDefendant’s Motion and so limits the following analysis solely to that basis.19 \n \n17 See Dkts. 715 (Request); 724; 726. \n18 See Pub. L. 115-391, 132 Stat. 5194, 5239 (2018);  \n19 Defendant has not actually served “at least 30 years in prison” to qualify for release under the \nsecond prong, § 3582(c)(1)(A)(ii). Nonetheless, Defendant does meet the age and custodial length \nconsidered to be extraordinary and compelling reasons for release under § 3582(c)(1)(A)(i) and \nU.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 1B1.13. \n4 \n \nCase 3:94-cr-00036-TMB   Document 733   Filed 04/09/20   Page 4 of 11\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-8   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 12\nA.  Exhaustion of the Bureau of Prisons’ Administrative Process \n  Section 3582(c)(1)(A) confers jurisdiction over compassionate release motions to the \ndistrict court after the defendant exhausts the BOP’s administrative process. “Exhaustion occurs \nwhen the BOP denies a defendant’s application or lets thirty days pass without responding to it.”20 \nHere, Defendant has previously submitted two written requests for compassionate release to his \nwardens.21 His most recent request was submitted to the warden on January 14, 2019.22 More than \n30 days have passed since receipt of that request and so this Court has jurisdiction to hear this \nMotion. \nB.  The 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) Factors \nThe sentencing factors listed under § 3553(a) help the court impose a sentence that is \n“sufficient, but not greater than necessary . . . (A) to reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the \noffense; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the \npublic from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with \nneeded educational or vocational training, medical care, and other correctional \ntreatment in the most effective manner.” \n \nIn this case, reducing Defendant’s sentence to time-served to effectuate an immediate \ncompassionate release fulfills the § 3553(a) considerations. Defendant has been in prison for over \n26 years. The Court recognizes the seriousness of his drug trafficking offenses and his history and \ncharacteristics at the time of sentencing. However, the nature and circumstances of the offenses \nwere non-violent and his criminal history was significantly less serious than the criminal history \n \n20 United States v. Mondaca, Case No.: 89-CR-0655 DMS, 2020 WL 1029024, at *2 (S.D. Cal. \nMar. 3, 2020) (internal quotations omitted). \n21 See Dkts. 711-1 (Request); 711-5 (Request).  \n22 Dkt. 711-1 at 3. \n5 \n \nCase 3:94-cr-00036-TMB   Document 733   Filed 04/09/20   Page 5 of 11\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-8   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 12\ncategory may have suggested.23 Furthermore, Defendant was sentenced by Judge Sedwick at a \ntime when the sentencing guidelines were mandatory. In 2015, when Defendant had served \napproximately 21 years of his sentence, Judge Sedwick wrote to President Obama to support \nDefendant’s  commutation  petition.24  Judge  Sedwick  explained  in  that  letter  that  he  lacked \ndiscretion in imposing a life sentence and that he doubted Defendant would receive “more time \nthan he has already served” if sentenced at the time of the letter.25 Nearly five years later, this \nCourt finds that the 26 year sentence Defendant has served to date is sufficient to address the \nseriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, deter Defendant and others, provide just \npunishment, and protect the public. Therefore, reducing Defendant’s sentence and granting the \nMotion is consistent with the factors set forth in § 3553(a).   \nC.  Extraordinary and Compelling Reasons \nThe applicable policy statement issued by the United States Sentencing Commission, \n§ 1B1.13  of  the  United  States  Sentencing  Guidelines  Manual  (“USSG”),  explains  that \nextraordinary and compelling reasons exist when the defendant is “(I) suffering from a serious \nphysical or medical condition” or “(III) experiencing deteriorating physical or mental health \nbecause of the aging process.”26 Extraordinary and compelling reasons also exist when the \n \n23 According to the Presentence Report (PSR), Defendant received two criminal history points for \ntwo prior alcohol-related driving offenses and an additional two points for being on probation for \nthose driving offenses when he committed the federal drug offenses. Hence, the four criminal \nhistory points placed Defendant in criminal history category III. However, in the Statement of \nReasons when adopting the PSR, Judge Sedwick found that the correct total of criminal history \npoints was only two and defendant’s criminal history most closely resembled a criminal history \ncategory I.

It is clear on the record that Defendant is not a danger to the community \nand the Motion should be granted. \n1.  Medical Condition of the Defendant \nUSSG  §  1B1.13  cmt.  n.1(A)(ii)  specifically  considers  the  medical  condition  of  the \ndefendant as a circumstance under which extraordinary and compelling reasons exist to warrant \nthe defendant’s compassionate release. Here, Defendant qualifies because he is “experiencing \ndeteriorating physical or mental health because of the aging process.”29 Defendant states that “[t]he \ncartilage around his knee, hip, and shoulder joints is severely worn-down causing bone on bone \ncontact and severe pain. He has lower back pain due to moderate to severe deterioration of his \nlumbar spinal discs. He also has arthritis in his wrists and hands, high blood pressure, a swollen \nprostate, age related eyesight and hearing loss, and suffers from post herpetic neuralgia (a \n \n27 Id. at cmt. n.1(B). \n28 Id. § 1B1.13(2). \n29 U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 1B1.13 cmt. n.1(A)(ii)(III). \n7 \n \nCase 3:94-cr-00036-TMB   Document 733   Filed 04/09/20   Page 7 of 11\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-8   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 12\ncomplication of the shingles virus for which there is no cure).”30 In addition, Defendant is over 70 \nyears old and thus within the age group that the Center for Disease Control recognizes as being at \nhigher risk for severe illness, such as COVID-19.31 The Court finds that COVID-19 presents a \nclear and present danger for individuals who are in custody.32 If COVID-19 reaches Defendant’s \ncustodial facility, his ability to follow recommended self-care and public health guidance is \nsubstantially  diminished  by  the  restrictions  inherent  to  his  environment.33  Notwithstanding, \nDefendant is not expected to recover from deteriorating health because of the aging process.34 \nTherefore, Defendant has presented extraordinary and compelling reasons based on medical \nconditions in support of his Motion. \n  2.  Age of the Defendant  \n  In addition to experiencing serious deterioration in physical or mental health because of \nthe aging process, USSG § 1B1.13 cmt. n.1(B) considers extraordinary and compelling reasons \nfor release exist when defendants are “at least 65 years old” and have “served 10 years or 75 \npercent of his or her term of imprisonment, whichever is less.” Here, Defendant falls squarely \nwithin these qualifications. He is over 70 years old and has served over 26 years in prison.

Therefore, Defendant has \nagain presented extraordinary and compelling reasons to support his Motion. \n  3.  Other Reasons \n  USSG  §  1B1.13  cmt.  n.1(D)  permits  the  consideration  of  other  extraordinary  and \ncompelling reasons “[a]s determined by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons.” Even without the \nprerequisite determination by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, several factors in Defendant’s \ncase warrant discussion here. First, Judge Sedwick, the sentencing judge, has written to support \nthe commutation of Defendant’s sentence.35 Second, two wardens and an assistant director of the \nDepartment of Justice Correctional Programs Division have also written to recommend Defendant \nfor sentence reduction.36 Each authority has recognized that Defendant meets the criteria for \nsentence reduction, is not a risk to the community, or a risk of reoffending.37 Third, Defendant has \nobtained significant education and vocational certifications while in custody and now even trains \nother inmates.38 The BOP staff at his current facility praised Defendant, stating “Plunk sets the \nexample in many ways and it is evident in the way he has embraced his current condition and \nencourages others to maintain a positive outlook on life. . . he has learned from his mistakes and \nwill be a great assets to others in and out of prison.”39 More recently, the staff noted, “Inmate Plunk \nhas  been  a  model  inmate  while  incarcerated  at  FCI  Jesup.”40  The  recommendation  letters, \n \n35 Dkt. 711-2. \n36 Dkts. 711-3 (Letter); 711-4 (Letter); 711-7 (Letter). \n37 Dkts. 711-2 at 2‒3; 711-3 at 2, 4; 711-4 at 2; 711-7 at 2. \n38 See 711-11 (Certifications); 711-12 (Summary Reentry Plan). \n39 Dkt. 711-12 at 5. \n40 Dkt. 711-13 at 5. \n9 \n \nCase 3:94-cr-00036-TMB   Document 733   Filed 04/09/20   Page 9 of 11\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-8   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 12\nachievement certifications, and staff evaluations clearly support that Defendant has taken his \nrehabilitation seriously and that presents other reasons worth consideration for release. \n  4.  Danger to Others or the Community \n  Finally, a court must consider the “nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or \nthe community” that the defendant’s release would pose.41 The Court finds that many of the \nforegoing  reasons  weigh  heavily  in  favor  of  Defendant.  His  age,  medical  conditions,  and \nrehabilitative achievements all demonstrate that Defendant would not be a danger to any person or \nthe community. Furthermore, Defendant as a verified release plan and proposes living with his \nsister in California. A U.S. Probation Officer has approved that residence and acknowledged, \n“considering his personal characteristics and criminal history, it does not appear that [Defendant] \nposes a third party risk to any specific individual/entity as a result of his residence.”42 Accordingly, \nthe Court finds that Defendant is not a danger to any person or community upon release. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n41 U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 1B1.13(2) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g)). \n42 Dkt. 711-15 at 2. \n10 \n \nCase 3:94-cr-00036-TMB   Document 733   Filed 04/09/20   Page 10 of 11\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 28-8   Filed 04/13/20   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 12\nV. CONCLUSION\nTherefore, the Court finds that the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) sentencing factors, extraordinary \nand compelling reasons under 18 U.S.C § 3582(c)(1)(A) and USSG § 1B1.13, and consideration \nof  the  applicable  U.S.  Sentencing  Commission  policies  warrant  Defendant’s  immediate \ncompassionate release. Furthermore, upon release, Defendant will not post a danger to any person \nor  the  community  under  18  U.S.C.  §  3142(g).  Accordingly,  the  Motion  at  Docket  711  is \nGRANTED. Defendant shall be released from BOP custody as soon as the release plan is \nimplemented,  and  travel  arrangements  made.  The  corresponding  Judgment  shall  be  issued \nforthwith.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated at Anchorage, Alaska, this 9th day of April, 2020. \n/s/ Timothy M. Burgess\nTIMOTHY M.

Brimmer\nCivil Case No. 20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC\nJESUS MARTINEZ, and\nCHAD HUNTER,\nPlaintiffs, on their own and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons,\nv.\nSTEVEN REAMS, Sheriff of Weld County, Colorado, in his official capacity,\nDefendant.\nORDER\nThis matter is before the Court on the parties’ Joint Supplement to Joint Motion\nfor Preliminary Approval of Class Action Settlement [Docket No. 101].  The Court\nordered the parties to supplement their Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class\nAction Settlement [Docket No. 96] in order to address whether past and future inmates\nof the Weld County Jail (“WCJ”) should be included in the class definition, the address\nwhere objections should be mailed, and the locations for posting notice of the proposed\nsettlement in the WCJ in English and Spanish.  Docket No. 100 at 23. \nI.  ANALYSIS\nA.  Definition of Class\nThe parties proposed class definition includes past and future inmates of the\nWCJ.  Docket No. 96 at 9.  The Court identified issues with how the proposed notice\nwould reach past inmates and how released inmates would benefit from the settlement\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 102   Filed 12/29/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 6\nagreement’s proposed injunctive relief.  Docket No. 100 at 7.  In the supplement, the\nparties agree that past inmates should be removed from the class definition.  Docket\nNo. 101 at 3.  The Court finds that withdrawing past inmates from the proposed class\ncures the issues identified. \nThe Court also identified issues with future inmates, noting that the parties did\nnot indicate how notice would reach future inmates and that “it is unclear to the Court\nwhy the class definition requires the inclusion of future inmates when the proposed\nrelief extends for a defined period of time and covers all medically vulnerable inmates\nduring that time.”  Docket No. 100 at 6, 8. \nThe Court finds that the parties’ supplement provides sufficient justification for\nthe inclusion of future inmates in the proposed class.  See Docket No. 101 at 3-5. \nRegarding the Court’s concern about how notice would reach future class members, the\nparties indicate that future members will be given notice of the consent decree within a\nreasonable time after being booked into the WCJ.  Id. at 5.  The parties also state that,\ndespite the temporally limited nature of the consent decree, the inclusion of future\ninmates is necessary because it provides defendant with a “critical safeguard” against\nclaims for injunctive relief by future inmates that differ from the relief set forth in the\nproposed consent decree.  Id.  The Court finds that the inclusion of future medically\nvulnerable inmates in the consent decree is appropriate. \nB.  Recipient of Objections\nThe Court ordered the parties to identify someone other than the Clerk of Court\nto receive any objections to the proposed settlement.  Docket No. 100 at 7-8.  The\n2\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 102   Filed 12/29/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 6\nparties have identified one of plaintiffs’ counsel, Daniel D. Williams, as that person. \nDocket Nos. 101 at 6; 101-1 at 4; 101-2 at 4.  The Court finds that Mr. Williams is an\nappropriate person to receive any objections. \nC.  Location of Notice Posting \nThe Court ordered the parties to provide greater detail about how notice would\nbe communicated to class members within the WCJ, including those who may have\nbeen inadvertently placed in the wrong area of the WCJ.  Docket No. 100 at 20.  The\nparties’ supplement states that the proposed notice will be uploaded to the WCJ’s jail-\nwide television system in both English and Spanish.  Docket No. 101 at 7.  Each page\nof the proposed notice will be shown in English and Spanish for two minutes every day\nduring the course of the daily inmate video briefing with a once-through repeat,\nmeaning that the proposed notice will be posted for 32 minutes each day during the\nnotice period.  Id.  The parties do not define the notice period, but the Court construes it\nto mean the period of time between the entry of this order and the date of the Fairness\nHearing.  \nThe video broadcast will inform inmates that a paper copy of the notice is\navailable for review upon request at the guard station in each housing unit, and each\nguard station will contain an English and Spanish version of the notice.  Id.  The parties\nstate that, once the consent decree is entered, the WCJ will modify this practice to have\nthe consent decree take the place of the notice found in the housing unit guard station\nand the morning briefing will inform inmates that the guard station has a copy of the\nconsent decree.  Id.  The Court determines that this method of proposed notice cures\n3\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 102   Filed 12/29/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 6\nthe earlier defects.  The Court finds that the notice procedures are designed to\nreasonably apprise class members of the proposed settlement.  See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(e)(1)(B). \nII.  CONCLUSION\nThe Court held in abeyance a decision on the motion for preliminary approval\n[Docket No. 96] to allow the parties to supplement their motion.  Docket No. 100 at 23. \nThe supplemental brief filed by the parties has cured the defects identified by the Court,\nas explained above.  Accordingly, it is\nORDERED that the Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class Action\nSettlement, Certification of a Class and Appointment of Class Counsel, and Permission\nto Post Class Notice [Docket No. 96] is GRANTED.  It is further\nORDERED that the Proposed Consent Decree and Final Judgment [Docket No.\n96-1] is PRELIMINARILY APPROVED with regard to present and future medically\nvulnerable inmates.  It is further\nORDERED that the proposed class of all present and future medically vulnerable\ninmates housed in the Weld County Jail from April 7, 2020 through the COVID-19\nEmergency End Date is PRELIMINARILY CERTIFIED for the purposes of settlement. \nIt is further \nORDERED that plaintiffs’ attorneys are appointed class counsel.  It is further\nORDERED that a Fairness Hearing is set for February 12, 2021 at 3:30 p.m. by\nVideo Teleconference (“VTC”) only.  It is further\n4\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 102   Filed 12/29/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 6\nORDERED that the parties shall update the proposed notice in English [Docket\nNo. 101-1] and Spanish [Docket No. 101-2] to reflect that the preliminary injunction is\ncurrently set to expire February 5, 2021, that the Fairness Hearing is set for February\n12, 2021 at 3:30 p.m. by VTC only, that class members must mail written objections by\nFebruary 5, 2021, and that there are procedures for an objector to connect to the\nFairness Hearing.  To connect to the Fairness Hearing, a class member should call 1-\n877-848-7030 and then enter 2001872#.  Calling this telephone number will allow class\nmembers to listen to the Fairness Hearing, and when it is the appropriate time to raise\nany objections, the Court will unmute the line and permit class members to state\nobjections.  When the objections are over, the Court will mute the line again, though\nclass members may continue to listen to the Fairness Hearing.  Any class member who\nhas submitted an objection in writing by the deadline set forth above may connect to the\nFairness Hearing and be heard as to why the proposed settlement agreement should\nnot be approved.  Any class members who fails to object will be deemed to have\nwaived the right to object to the proposed settlement agreement.  It is further\nORDERED that the parties update the Proposed Consent Decree and Final\nJudgment [Docket No. 96-1] to reflect that the proposed class does not include past\ninmates, to revise the case caption, to amend the definition of “plaintiffs.”  The parties\nshall then file the updated document with the Court.  It is further \n5\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 102   Filed 12/29/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 6\nORDERED that the parties shall post the updated notice in English [Docket No.\n101-1] and Spanish [Docket No. 101-2] in the WCJ in the matter described in the\nparties’ Joint Supplement [Docket No. 101]. \nDATED December 29, 2020\nBY THE COURT:\n__________________________\nPHILIP A.

Brimmer\nCivil Case No. 20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC\nJESUS MARTINEZ, and\nCHAD HUNTER,\nPlaintiffs, on their own and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons,\nv.\nSTEVEN REAMS, Sheriff of Weld County, Colorado, in his official capacity,\nDefendant.\nORDER\nThis matter is before the Court on the parties’ Joint Motion for Final Approval of\nClass Action Settlement and Final Certification of the Proposed Class [Docket No. 105]. \nOn April 7, 2020, plaintiffs brought this case as a class action alleging that defendant\nSheriff Steven Reams acted with deliberate indifference to the health of medically\nvulnerable persons in custody at the Weld County Jail (“WCJ”) by failing to take\nnecessary measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  Docket Nos. 1, 7 at 25-27. \nI.  BACKGROUND\nOn April 7, 2020, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.  Docket No.\n1.  On April 30, 2020, the Court conducted a hearing on plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction\nmotion.  Docket No. 52.  On May 11, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction\nthat identified actions defendant had to take to protect medically vulnerable inmates at\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 112   Filed 02/16/21   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 14\nthe WCJ.  See generally Docket No. 55.  This preliminary injunction was extended\nseveral times and expired on February 5, 2021.  See Docket No. 99. \nOn November 30, 2020, the parties filed a joint motion for preliminary approval of\nthe class action settlement, certification of a class and appointment of class counsel,\nand permission to post class notice.  Docket No. 96.  The Court ordered the parties to\nfile a supplemental brief on the issues of notice, the definition of the class, and where\nobjections to the settlement should be mailed.  Docket No. 100 at 23.  Upon review of\nthe parties’ supplement, the Court preliminarily approved the proposed consent decree\nand final judgment, preliminarily certified the proposed class, appointed plaintiffs’\nattorneys as class counsel, and set the case for a fairness hearing.  Docket No. 102 at\n4.  On February 11, 2021, the parties filed a joint motion for final approval of the class\naction settlement and certification of the proposed class.  Docket No. 105.  The Court\nheld a fairness hearing on February 12, 2021.  Docket No. 109.  At the fairness hearing,\nthe Court indicated that it would grant the motion for final approval and would sign the\nproposed consent decree and final judgment.  See id. \nII.  FINAL APPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION CERTIFICATION \nApproval of a class action settlement under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 takes place in two\nstages.  In the first stage, the Court preliminarily certifies a settlement class,\npreliminarily approves the settlement agreement, and authorizes that notice be given to\nthe class so that interested class members may object to the fairness of the settlement. \nIn the second stage, after notice is given to the putative class, the Court holds a\nfairness hearing at which it addresses (1) any timely objections to the treatment of this\n2\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 112   Filed 02/16/21   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 14\nlitigation as a class action, and (2) any objections to the fairness, reasonableness, or\nadequacy of the settlement terms.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2); see, e.g., McReynolds v.\nRichards-Cantave, 588 F.3d 790, 803 (2d Cir. 2009).\nDistrict courts have broad discretion in granting or denying class certification. \nShook v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm’rs of the Cnty. of El Paso (“Shook II”), 543 F.3d 597, 603\n(10th Cir. 2008).  “[C]ertification is proper only if ‘the trial court is satisfied, after a\nrigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been satisfied.’”  Wal-Mart\nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350-51 (2011) (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of the Sw. v.\nFalcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982)). \nA district court may certify a class action if the proposed class satisfies the\nprerequisites of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) as well as the requirements of one of the three\ntypes of classes identified in Rule 23(b).  Where the plaintiff applies for class\ncertification, plaintiff bears the burden of proving that Rule 23’s requirements are\nsatisfied.  DG ex rel. Stricklin v. Devaughn, 594 F.3d 1188, 1194 (10th Cir. 2010) (citing\nShook v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm’rs of the Cnty. of El Paso, 386 F.3d 963, 968 (10th Cir.\n2004)).  Here, the parties jointly moved for certification for the purposes of settlement\nonly.  See Docket No. 96 at 10 n.2 (defendant reserves the right to contest class\ncertification if the settlement is not approved).  \nA.  Rule 23(a)\nRule 23(a) requires that (1) the class be so numerous that joinder is\nimpracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims\nof the representative party are typical of those of the class; and (4) the representative\n3\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 112   Filed 02/16/21   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 14\nparties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \nThe Court found each of the requirements met in the order on the motion for\npreliminary approval, Docket No. 100 at 7-13, and incorporates those findings herein.1 \nAccordingly, the requirements of Rule 23(a) are met.  \nB.  Rule 23(b)(2)\nThe Court preliminarily certified the class under Rule 23(b)(2), Docket No. 102 at\n4, which states that a class action may be maintained if “the party opposing the class\nhas acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final\ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as\na whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  Rule 23(b)(2) certification imposes two independent\nbut related requirements: defendant’s actions or inaction must be based on grounds\ngenerally applicable to all class members and the injunctive relief must be appropriate\nfor the class as a whole.  Shook II, 543 F.3d at 604.  The Court previously found that\npreliminary certification under Rule 23(b)(2) was appropriate, Docket No. 100 at 15, and\nthe Court now finds that final certification is appropriate for the same reasons.\nIII.  FINAL APPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT\nA. Overview of the Consent Decree and Final Judgment\nThe class consists of \nAll present and future inmates housed within the Weld County Jail\nfrom April 7, 2020 through the “COVID-19 Emergency End Date” who are\n1 At the fairness hearing, counsel for defense stated that at least one of the\nnamed plaintiffs was still held at the WCJ.  The Court found in its order on the motion\nfor preliminary approval that both named plaintiffs brought claims that are typical of the\nproposed class.  Docket No. 100 at 11-12.  The fact that only one may remain at the jail\ndoes not defeat typicality. \n4\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 112   Filed 02/16/21   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 14\n“medically vulnerable.”\n“Medically vulnerable” means inmates who, pursuant to CDC guidelines\nfor correctional facilities like the WCJ which exist as of the date this\nproposed Consent Decree and Final Judgment was submitted to the\nCourt, have one or more of the following conditions: are 65 years and\nolder; have chronic lung disease including COPD; have moderate to\nsevere asthma; have serious heart conditions such as heart failure,\ncoronary artery disease or cardiomyopathies; have sickle cell disease; are\nimmunocompromised; have severe obesity (e.g. BMI of 30 or higher);\nhave diabetes; have chronic kidney disease and are undergoing dialysis;\nhave liver disease; have cancer; are pregnant; or are former or current\ncigarette smokers.\nThe “COVID-19 Emergency End Date” is the date on which Executive\nOrder D 2020 205 issued by Colorado Governor Jared Polis, Declaring a\nDisaster Emergency Due to the Presence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in\nColorado, as subsequently amended or extended, expires and is not\nreplaced by a similar Executive Order in light of the ongoing COVID-19\npandemic.\nDocket No. 110 at 2, 5.  There are no subclasses.  Key terms of the consent decree\ninclude that: (1) WCJ will identify medically vulnerable inmates during booking, protect\nthem during the remainder of the intake process to the extent possible, and provide\nthem with a document stating their status; (2) WCJ will attempt to single-cell medically\nvulnerable inmates in the intake/transition units and will continue to limit their exposure\nin the general jail population; (3) WCJ will medically isolate COVID-19 positive inmates\nin a non-punitive environment; (4) WCJ will continue enhanced sanitation and will\ndistribute masks to inmates; (5) healthcare processionals will monitor medically\nvulnerable inmates for COVID-19 symptoms and will provide testing to inmates\nconsistent with CDC guidelines; (6) defendant will maintain modified arrest standards\nto reduce jail population and will advise Weld County police chiefs to be judicious with\njail space on a regular basis; (7) every two weeks, WCJ will provide the Chief Judge for\n5\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 112   Filed 02/16/21   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 14\nthe Nineteenth Judicial District of Colorado and the Colorado Division of Adult Parole a\nlist of all inmates housed at WCJ, with a request to the Chief Judge for a docket review\nfor potential judicial action; (8) defendant will comply with data reporting requirements\nand plaintiffs’ counsel will not make additional requests; (9) plaintiffs and the class will\nrelease claims for injunctive and declaratory relief arising from COVID-19 at the WCJ,\nbut that does not include claims concerning conduct that occurs after the date the\nConsent Decree is entered, and it does not include any money damages claims; (10)\ndefendant will pay counsel for plaintiffs $122,387.60 in attorney’s fees and costs; and\n(11) there is no admission of wrongdoing by defendant.  Id. at 5-8.   \nB.  Notice to the Settlement Class\nRule 23(e) requires the Court to “direct notice in a reasonable manner to all\nclass members who would be bound by” a proposed settlement.  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(e)(1)(B).  “[N]otice must be ‘reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to\napprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity\nto present their objections.’”  DeJulius v. New England Health Care Emps. Pension\nFund, 429 F.3d 935, 944 (10th Cir. 2005) (quoting Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank &\nTrust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950)).  The Court found that the parties’ initial proposed\nnotice was inadequate and ordered the parties to file supplemental briefing on notice. \nDocket No. 100 at 20.  In the supplemental briefing, the parties stated that each page\nof the notice would be shown in English and Spanish for two minutes every day\nduring the course of the daily inmate video briefing with a once-through repeat,\nmeaning that the notice would be posted for 32 minutes each day during the\n6\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 112   Filed 02/16/21   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 14\nnotice period.  Docket No. 101 at 7.  Additionally, the video broadcast would inform\ninmates that a paper copy of the notice was available for review upon request at the\nguard station in each housing unit, and each guard station would contain an English\nand Spanish version of the notice.  Id.  The Court found that this proposed notice\nprocedure was designed to reasonably apprise class members of the proposed\nsettlement, and thus satisfied Rule 23(e)(1).  Docket No. 102 at 4.  The parties’ motion\nfor final approval states that notice was posted in this manner from January 1, 2021 to\nFebruary 5, 2021.  Docket No. 105 at 4.  At the fairness hearing, the Court found that\nthis notice procedure satisfied Rule 23(e)(1).  Docket No. 109.  \nC.  Objections\nThe Court received two objections to the consent decree.2  Docket No. 105 at 4-\n5.  Mr. Bret Brockel, who is a member of the class currently confined at the WCJ,\nobjected on the basis that he wishes to recover money damages from the jail.  Docket\nNo. 106.  Because the consent decree preserves the right of a class member to bring\na separate lawsuit seeking money damages, the Court overruled his objection at the\nfairness hearing.  Docket No. 109 at 1. \nAt the fairness hearing, Mr. Patrick D. Kane objected that certain deputies in\nWCJ were not wearing masks or practicing social distancing, surfaces were not\ncleaned regularly, hand sanitizer stations that the defendant claimed were in use were\n2 The motion for final approval states that Jesus Martinez, a named plaintiff,\nsubmitted a letter to class counsel in response to the proposed consent decree\nregarding his conditions of confinement.  Docket No. 105 at 5.  However, Mr. Martinez\nrequested that his letter not be submitted to the Court as an objection, and he did not\nappear at the fairness hearing to object.  See id. \n7\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 112   Filed 02/16/21   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 14\nin fact nonexistent, and the lockdowns in the jail were excessive.  Mr. Kane additionally\nnoted that he had filed five grievances with WCJ on these matters.  The Court found\nthat all of the issues raised by Mr. Kane are addressed in the consent decree.  See\nDocket No. 110 at 10-11 (WCJ must allow the maximum daily out-of-cell time it can\nprovide while adhering to cohorting and social distancing, WCJ must ensure enhanced\nsanitation in housing units, and all WCJ staff and third party contractors are required to\nwear a face mask at all times when interacting with inmates).  Additionally, the consent\ndecree requires WCJ to report to the ACLU of Colorado, inter alia, average daily\npopulations of medically vulnerable inmates and the number and results of COVID-19\ntests administered.  Id. at 14.  To the extent WCJ fails to abide by the terms of the\nconsent decree, plaintiffs’ counsel may informally resolve the issue or may seek to\nenforce the consent decree with the Court through contempt proceedings.  The Court\nalso noted at the fairness hearing that Mr. Kane has the remedy of filing grievances\navailable to him.  Accordingly, Mr. Kane’s objection is overruled. \nD.  Analysis of Rule 23(e) Factors\nRule 23(e) provides that a proposed settlement may only be approved after a\n“finding that it is fair, reasonable, and adequate.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2).  In making\nthis determination, “trial judges bear the important responsibility of protecting absent\nclass members” and must be “assur[ed] that the settlement represents adequate\ncompensation for the release of the class claims.”  In re Pet Food Prods. Liab. Litig.,\n629 F.3d 333, 349 (3d Cir. 2010); see also Amchem, 521 U.S. at 623 (noting that the\nRule 23(e) inquiry “protects unnamed class members from unjust or unfair settlements\n8\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 112   Filed 02/16/21   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 14\naffecting their rights when the representatives become fainthearted before the action is\nadjudicated or are able to secure satisfaction of their individual claims by a\ncompromise”) (citations omitted).\nTo determine whether a proposed settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate,\ncourts consider the following factors: (1) whether the proposed settlement was fairly\nand honestly negotiated; (2) whether serious questions of law and fact exist, placing\nthe ultimate outcome of the litigation in doubt; (3) whether the value of an immediate\nrecovery outweighs the mere possibility of future relief after protracted and expensive\nlitigation; and (4) the judgment of the parties that the settlement is fair and reasonable. \nRutter & Wilbanks Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., 314 F.3d 1180, 1188 (10th Cir. 2002).  If the\nsettling parties can establish these factors, courts usually presume that the proposed\nsettlement is fair and reasonable.  In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., 391 F.3d 516,\n535 (3d Cir. 2004) (applying an “initial presumption of fairness” to a proposed\nsettlement where: (1) it is the result of arm's length negotiations; (2) it is based on\nsufficient discovery; (3) the proponents of the settlement are experienced in similar\nlitigation; and (4) only a small fraction of the class objected).\nAt the fairness hearing, the Court found that the consent decree was fair,\nreasonable, and adequate because it met all of the factors outlined by Rutter.  See\nDocket No. 109.  The consent decree was the product of months of arms-length\nnegotiations between the parties.  Docket No. 105 at 3.  These negotiations took place\nafter the parties had vigorously litigated a motion for preliminary injunction.  See\nDocket No. 55 at 3 n.2 (“The parties also submitted a volume of exhibits to the Court\nmore typical of a four-day jury trial than a preliminary injunction hearing.”).  The Court\n9\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 112   Filed 02/16/21   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 14\nfinds that the negotiations were done fairly and honestly.  Serious questions exist\nregarding this complex litigation, especially given the ever-changing nature of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.  The value of immediate recovery clearly outweighs the mere\npossibility of future relief because implementation of the COVID-19 safety measures in\nthe consent decree are much more valuable now than in the future.  The parties\nbelieve that the consent decree is fair and reasonable and was negotiated at arms\nlength by experienced counsel.  Docket No. 96 at 8.  Accordingly, the Court finds that\nthe consent decree is fair, reasonable, and adequate.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2). \nIV.  ATTORNEY’S FEES AND COSTS\nThe consent decree includes a payment of $122,387.60 from defendant to\nplaintiffs’ counsel.  Docket No. 110 at 14.  In a certified class action, the court may\naward reasonable attorney’s fees that are authorized by the parties’ agreement\nprovided that (1) the claim for an award is made by motion under Rule 54(d)(2) and\nnotice of the motion is directed to class members; (2) a class member or party from\nwhom payment is sought may object; and (3) the Court finds facts and states its legal\nconclusions.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(h).  The parties included the attorney’s fees provision\nin their joint motion for preliminary approval and the notice provided to class members. \nDocket No. 96 at 8; Docket No. 101-1 at 3.  The parties submitted a breakdown of the\nattorney’s fees calculation applying the lodestar method, as informed by the rate caps\nand requirements of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”).  Docket No. 105 at 6-7. \nThe $122,387.60 fee represents a discount of approximately 55% off what plaintiffs’\ncounsel would typically have charged without the application of the PLRA.  Id. at 9. \nAdditionally, this amount does not account for approximately 81 hours of additional\n10\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 112   Filed 02/16/21   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 14\nwork done after July 2020.  Id.  The Court finds that the attorney’s fees award of\n$122,387.60 is reasonable and appropriate.3\nV.  CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, it is \nORDERED the parties’ Joint Motion for Final Approval of Class Action\nSettlement and Final Certification of the Proposed Class  [Docket No. 105] is\nGRANTED.  It is further\nORDERED that Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification [Docket No. 2] is\nDENIED AS MOOT.  It is further\nORDERED that pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, and for the purposes of settlement only, the class is certified as follows:\nAll present and future inmates housed within the Weld County Jail\nfrom April 7, 2020 through the “COVID-19 Emergency End Date”\nwho are “medically vulnerable.”\n“Medically vulnerable” means inmates who, pursuant to CDC\nguidelines for correctional facilities like the WCJ which exist as of\nthe date this proposed Consent Decree and Final Judgment was\nsubmitted to the Court, have one or more of the following\nconditions: are 65 years and older; have chronic lung disease\nincluding COPD; have moderate to severe asthma; have serious\nheart conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease or\ncardiomyopathies; have sickle cell disease; are\nimmunocompromised; have severe obesity (e.g. BMI of 30 or\nhigher); have diabetes; have chronic kidney disease and are\nundergoing dialysis; have liver disease; have cancer; are\npregnant; or are former or current cigarette smokers.\n3 The Court has previously found that the consent decree complies with the\nPLRA.  Docket No. 100 at 21-23.  The Court incorporates that finding herein.  \n11\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 112   Filed 02/16/21   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 14\nThe “COVID-19 Emergency End Date” is the date on which\nExecutive Order D 2020 205 issued by Colorado Governor Jared\nPolis, Declaring a Disaster Emergency Due to the Presence of\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 in Colorado, as subsequently amended\nor extended, expires and is not replaced by a similar Executive\nOrder in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nIt is further\nORDERED that the Court finds, solely for the purposes of this settlement, that\nthe prerequisites for a class action under Rules 23(a) and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules\nof Civil Procedure have been satisfied in that: (a) the members of the settlement class\nare so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (b) there are questions\nof law and fact common to the class; (c) the claims of the named plaintiffs are typical\nof the claims of the class; (d) the named plaintiffs and plaintiffs’ counsel have fairly and\nadequately represented and protected the interests of all of the class members; and\n(e) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply\ngenerally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is\nappropriate respecting the class as a whole.  It is further\nORDERED that the Court finds that the notice given to members of the class\nwas reasonably calculated under the circumstances to apprise such members of the\npendency of this action and to afford them an opportunity to object to.  Because the\nCourt has afforded a full opportunity to all class members to be heard, the Court\nfurther determines that all members of the class are bound by the Consent Decree and\nFinal Judgment.  It is further\nORDERED that, pursuant to Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\nthis Court finds that the Consent Decree and Final Judgment is fair, reasonable, and\n12\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 112   Filed 02/16/21   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 14\nadequate.  Accordingly, the Court gives final approval to the Consent Decree and Final\nJudgment in all respects and authorizes and directs the parties to consummate the\nConsent Decree and Final Judgment in accordance with its terms and provisions.  It is\nfurther\nORDERED that the parties and their counsel shall fulfill their obligations and\nduties under the Consent Decree and Final Judgment.  It is further\nORDERED that plaintiffs and all class members are permanently enjoined and\nbarred from asserting, initiating, prosecuting, or continuing any of the claims released\nby the Consent Decree and Final Judgment.  It is further\nORDERED that defendant shall pay plaintiffs’ counsel $122,387.60 in\naccordance with the procedures set forth in the Consent Decree and Final Judgment. \nIt is further \nORDERED that neither this Order nor the Consent Decree and Final Judgment\nis an admission or concession by defendant respecting any facts, liabilities, or\nwrongdoing.  It is further\nORDERED that, without affecting the finality of this Order, this Court retains\njurisdiction to consider all further matters arising out of or connected with the Consent\nDecree and Final Judgment, including its implementation and enforcement.

Indeed, as \ncurrently conceived, Defendant’s plans will increase the likelihood of infection for some medically \nvulnerable inmates. The risk to the Plaintiff class is real and extreme. Just yesterday, Anthony Griego, \na medically vulnerable inmate at WCJ, lost his battle with COVID-19 and died in his cell. Plaintiffs \n  1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 62   Filed 05/21/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 11\nask the Court to set a forthwith hearing on whether the changes implemented by WCJ comply with \nthis Court’s May 11, 2020 preliminary injunction and are sufficient to satisfy the Court that WCJ has \nmitigated the risk to medically vulnerable inmates.  \nProcedural History \n  Following a full-day evidentiary hearing, the Court entered a straightforward order granting \nPlaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction and requiring Defendant to institute specific policies \nor procedures at the Weld County Jail regarding the following: \n1.  A process to compile a list of all medically vulnerable inmates at the Weld County Jail;  \n2.  A policy ensuring social distancing of medically vulnerable inmates housed at the jail to the \n“maximum extent possible”;  \n3.  A  procedure  for  single-celling  or,  if  single-celling  is  not  possible,  otherwise  socially \ndistancing medically vulnerable inmates during the intake/transition process;  \n4.  Policies requiring enhanced sanitation procedures;  \n5.  A plan to obtain sufficient masks for inmates; and \n6.  A policy providing increased monitoring of medically vulnerable inmates. \nThe Court’s preliminary injunction remains in effect through at least August 9, 2020. (ECF No. 55 at \n39.)  \nOn May 18, 2020, Defendant filed his “Notice of Complete Compliance with This Court’s \nPreliminary Injunction Order” explaining the new policies and procedures implemented at the Weld \nCounty Jail. (ECF No. 60.) Plaintiffs acknowledge that Defendant’s policies and procedures regarding \nenhanced sanitation and masks for inmates comply with the standards set forth by the Court. However, \nDefendant’s actions fall short of full compliance with other provisions of the Court’s preliminary \n  2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 62   Filed 05/21/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 11\ninjunction. Defendant’s submission also fails to provide Plaintiffs and the Court with sufficient \ninformation to explain or justify Defendant’s refusal to single-cell medically vulnerable inmates in \nthe face of the Court’s order requiring Sheriff Reams to do so if possible. Accordingly, Plaintiffs \nrequest a forthwith hearing. \nLegal Standard \nIn granting the preliminary injunction, the Court found Plaintiffs demonstrated a substantial \nlikelihood of success on the merits of their claim and that they had shown a significant risk of probable \nirreparable harm. (ECF No. 55 at 25-26.) The Court ordered Defendant to implement specific policies \nand procedures and now has the inherent authority to ensure its order is being followed. See United \nStates v. United Mine Workers of Am., 330 U.S. 258, 293 (1947) (discussing court’s inherent authority \nto enforce duly entered injunction). Given the serious health risk faced by medically vulnerable \ninmates each moment that Defendant remains in non-compliance with the Court’s order, Plaintiffs \nseek a forthwith hearing regarding non-compliance.  \nAnalysis \n  Defendant’s response to the Court’s preliminary injunction order is deficient in at least three \nrespects: (1) conditions for medically vulnerable inmates in the housing pods; (2) how medically \nvulnerable inmates are housed in the intake/transition unit; and (3) the procedures utilized to identify \nmedically vulnerable inmates. Each of these deficiencies will be discussed in turn below.  \nA.  Housing Conditions for the Medically Vulnerable \nThe Court ordered Defendant to enact a policy “ensuring that, to the maximum extent possible \nconsidering the Jail’s physical layout, population level, and classification needs, medically vulnerable \ninmates are ‘socially distanced’ from other inmates housed in the Jail. If social distancing is \n  3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 62   Filed 05/21/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 11\neffectively impossible for some or all of the medically vulnerable inmates in the Jail, such policy may \nbe supplemented by housing medically vulnerable inmates together in one or more pods.” (ECF No. \n55.) \nAt the time the preliminary injunction was entered, the Court lacked the data necessary to \ndetermine to what degree medically vulnerable inmates could be single-celled or otherwise socially \ndistanced. That is, because Defendant had not identified how many medically vulnerable inmates \nwere at the WCJ, it was impossible to ascertain whether medically vulnerable inmates could be \nhoused in single cells. Even without this data, the Court noted the Jail was “well below half of its \nmaximum capacity, indicating that there is space within the Jail to increase the amount of physical \ndistancing for at least some inmates.” (ECF No. 55 at 31.)  \nPer Defendant’s Notice, WCJ’s screening process identified 89 inmates (less than 20% of the \nWCJ population) who qualify as medically vulnerable. (ECF No. 60 at 3.) Despite the limited number \nof medically vulnerable inmates, Defendant found it “very difficult” to create a policy that would \nsatisfy the Court’s preliminary injunction. (ECF No. 60-8 ¶ 16(g).) Defendant chose to ignore the \nCourt’s structure and instead prioritized what he apparently regarded as a need to reduce inmate \nmovement and realignment, and to avoid inconvenience to the WCJ staff. (Id. ¶ 16.)  \nThe Court entered a very specific order. Defendant was to adopt a policy that either: (1) \nallowed all medically vulnerable inmates the opportunity to socially distance from others; or (2) if \nsocial distancing from others was “effectively impossible,” Defendant was to adopt a policy that \nhoused medically vulnerable inmates in a pod with only other medically vulnerable inmates. (ECF \nNo. 55.) Defendant admits his chosen policy falls short of complying with this order. A forthwith \nhearing is necessary for Plaintiffs to challenge Sheriff Reams’s conclusion that his adopted policy \n  4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 62   Filed 05/21/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 11\nwas the “only option,” and that complying with the Court’s order would have been impossible. (ECF \nNo. 60-8 ¶ 16(i) (emphasis in original).)  \nOne point worth noting: Throughout these proceedings, Defendant has acknowledged the \navailability of unused cells at WCJ. Plaintiffs’ counsel and their expert observed multiple empty cells \nin each unit during their inspections of the facility and noted that medically vulnerable inmates were \nhoused with several cellmates in those same pods that had empty cells. Defendant claims it is \n“impossible” to fill all of the cells on the one hand, while on the other hand claims he would need 8-\n12 additional housing units and 48-72 additional deputies to house medically vulnerable inmates \nseparately  from  other  inmates.  (ECF  No.  60-8  ¶  16.)  Interestingly,  during  recent  conferral \nconversations, Defendant refused to provide Plaintiffs’ counsel with specific data regarding the \nnumber of unused cells and the units in which those empty cells are located. The Court should require \nDefendant to provide this information and explain why there are empty cells at WCJ while medically \nvulnerable inmates are housed in units with non-vulnerable inmates and not given adequate space to \nsocially distance from others. A forthwith hearing allows Plaintiffs to test Defendant’s conclusory \nassertions of impossibility.  \nShould Sheriff Reams convince the Court that it is “effectively impossible” to comply with \nthe Court’s order regarding social distancing, and that the jail may continue housing medically \nvulnerable people in the same cells together inside a pod with other non-medically vulnerable people, \nPlaintiffs expert will testify that – especially without testing medically vulnerable inmates – this plan \nis likely to increase the danger of infection for some medically vulnerable inmates. As Dr. Franco-\nParedes explained in his declaration and during testimony, a large number of people infected with \nCOVID-19 are asymptomatic. Without testing medically vulnerable people before moving them into \n  5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 62   Filed 05/21/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 11\na cell with other medically vulnerable people, Weld County Jail predictably risks spreading the virus \nbetween medically vulnerable people who face a substantial risk of serious illness or death by the \nvirus.   \nGiven changes that Dr. Franco-Peredes can testify to regarding test availability—a subject \nthat has also received widespread media attention this week—there is no longer any excuse for failure \nto test. While there may have been some doubt as to the availability of testing at the time of the \npreliminary injunction hearing, recent developments have made clear that testing is now widely \navailable. Whereas, at the time of the hearing, tests were in short supply and competition for tests was \nfierce, Colorado now has the supplies and capacity to test everyone who needs to get tested, and free \ntesting is currently available to all essential workers and any symptomatic Coloradoans.1 Dr. Franco-\nPeredes has confirmed and, if the Court should grant a hearing, would be available to testify, that \nWCJ could promptly obtain the supplies to test all inmates in the Jail if it desired.  Yet, Defendant \nhas only performed 26 COVID-19 tests to date2 and does not assert any intention to test medically \nvulnerable inmates before moving them into cells with other medically vulnerable inmates.  Failure \nto take this minimal protective action, particularly in light of Defendant’s failure to follow the Court’s \n \n1 See, e.g, FORT COLLINS COLORADOAN, “All symptomatic Coloradans, essential workers can get \ncoronavirus test as capacity ramps up,” May 18, 2020, available at  \nhttps://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/2020/05/18/coronavirus-colorado-state-covid-19-testing-\ncapacity-ramps-up-where-tested/5213901002/; COLORADO PUBLIC RADIO, “Polis: Any Coloradan \nwith  Coronavirus  Symptoms  Should  Get  Tested,”  May  18,  2020,  available  at \nhttps://www.cpr.org/2020/05/18/anyone-with-covid-19-symptoms-should-get-tested-polis-\nannounces/. \n2 As of the April 30, 2020 hearing, WCJ had tested 22 inmates for COVID-19. Pl.’s Ex. 8. Since then, \ndespite a sea change in the availability of tests, WCJ has conducted only 4 COVID-19 tests on \ninmates. The lack of testing calls into question the veracity of Defendant’s assertion that the COVID-\n19 outbreak inside WCJ has stabilized. \n  6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 62   Filed 05/21/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 11\ndirective on social distancing, poses a foreseeable and unreasonable risk of harm to medically \nvulnerable inmates. \nB.  Vulnerable Inmates in the Intake/Transition Unit \nThe Court’s preliminary injunction ordered Defendant to enact a procedure for medically \nvulnerable inmates to be “single-celled or otherwise socially distanced, to the maximum extent \npossible considering the Jail’s physical layout and classification needs, while housed in the transition \nunit.” (ECF No. 55 at 38.) The Court found this relief was necessary because “the Jail places more \nthan one inmate in a cell in the transition unit, and there is no evidence that new inmates are given a \nCOVID-19 test.” (Id. at 34.)  \nDefendant’s adopted policy specifically allows more than one medically vulnerable inmate to \nbe housed together in the intake unit, while still not requiring either of the inmates be tested for \nCOVID-19. (ECF No. 60 at 8.) This policy defies the letter and the spirit of the Court’s order. As \nnoted above, many individuals are asymptomatic for COVID-19; thus Defendant’s plan places \nmedically vulnerable inmates at grave risk of harm.  Particularly given that infection Dr. Franco-\nParedes will testify that only single-celling medically vulnerable inmates through intake and then \nensuring the inmate and any potential cellmates have twice tested negative for COVID-19, can \nreasonably mitigate the risk of infection to medically vulnerable inmates.  Based on information from \nWeld County, it appears that, on an average day, they see 10-20 bookings in to the jail and only about \n20% of those individuals – or 2 to 4 people – will qualify as medically vulnerable and require single-\ncelling for at least 14 days. Defendant’s submission to the Court does not explain why, given its \ncurrent jail capacity, single celling of these few inmates is not possible.   Further, to the extent this \nCourt  concludes  that  WCJ  may  house  medically  vulnerable  inmates  with  others  during \n  7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 62   Filed 05/21/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 11\nintake/transition, WCJ should be required to implement a policy that requires testing of medically \nvulnerable inmates before they are housed together in a cell during the intake/transition process. As \ndiscussed above, Dr. Franco-Paredes would testify to the availability of adequate testing supplies. \nDespite adopting a policy that falls short of the Court’s order, Defendant again claims his \nadopted policy was the “only option.” (ECF No. 60-8 ¶ 21 (emphasis in original).) Plaintiffs should \nbe afforded the opportunity to test this assertion at a compliance hearing.  \nC.  Deficiencies in Defendant’s Screening Protocol \nPlaintiffs and their counsel are concerned that Defendant’s adopted screening protocol is not \nproperly identifying all medically vulnerable inmates. As one example, Plaintiffs’ counsel has been \nin contact with an inmate who suffers from asthma and is dependent on an inhaler. Yet, he was not \nidentified as medically vulnerable based on Defendant’s screening criteria. \nAs Dr. Franco-Paredes will testify, the screening questions are inadequate to reasonably \nensure that the screener will uncover whether the inmate is medically vulnerable.  For instance, \ninmates are asked whether they are “immunocompromised” or have a “chronic lung disease” in the \nabsence of additional information explaining to them what types of diagnoses and medical conditions \nfall within these categories. Inmates have varying education levels and life experiences, and may not \nhave responded accurately to the questioning. Offering a non-exhaustive list of common conditions \nthat fall within chronic lung disease or serious heart conditions and questioning inmates about current \nmedications and recent hospitalizations would allow WCJ to identify and protect all inmates who are \nmedically vulnerable.   \nAs such, Plaintiffs ask the Court to hold a hearing during which they can explore whether \nDefendant’s  screening  tool  adequately  identifies  all  medically  vulnerable  inmates,  or  whether \n  8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 62   Filed 05/21/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 11\ndifferent language should be utilized during the screening process to ensure all inmate who are \nmedically vulnerable are identified as such.  \nConclusion \n  Plaintiffs and members of the Plaintiff class remain at risk of imminent harm in the WCJ. \nMedically vulnerable inmates continue to be held in conditions that do not allow for social distancing \nand in units with non-medically vulnerable inmates. Despite widespread availability of COVID-19 \ntests, WCJ is not testing medically vulnerable inmates before housing them in a cell with another \nperson (who also has not been tested).  \nFor  the  reasons  set  forth  above,  Plaintiffs  request  a  forthwith  hearing  on  Defendant’s \ncompliance with the Court’s preliminary injunction order, with Defendant required to provide \ndetailed information on the availability of empty cells in each unit housing medically vulnerable \nindividuals.  \nDated: May 21, 2020 \n              Respectfully submitted,  \n \n              s/Jamie Hughes Hubbard     \n              Jamie Hughes Hubbard \n              Stimson Stancil LaBranche Hubbard, LLC \n              1652 Downing Street \n              Denver, CO 80218 \n              Tel/Fax: 720-869-8909 \n              Email: hubbard@sslhlaw.com \n \n              and \n \n              Andy McNulty \n              Michael P.

Hegarty, Esq., Andrew D. Ringel, Esq., and John F. Peters, Esq., of Hall & Evans, \nL.L.C., hereby respectfully submits this Notice of Complete Compliance with this Court’s \nPreliminary Injunction Order [ECF 55], as follows: \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nOn May 11, 2020, this Court issued its Order granting in part and denying in part \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction. [ECF 55]. This Court granted Plaintiffs “a \nlimited preliminary injunction” focused on this Court’s definition of “medically vulnerable” \ninmates constituting some of the Plaintiffs. In its Order, this Court directed the Sheriff to \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 15\n \nimplement six policies at the WCJ by May 18, 2020, and May 21, 2020. This submission \nprovides this Court with the Sheriff’s complete compliance with this Court’s Order.1 \nII.  COMPLETE COMPLIANCE WITH ORDER OF MAY 11, 2020 \nA. Identification of “Medically Vulnerable” Inmates by Inmate Number: \nInitially, this Court “ORDERED that, on or before May 18, 2020, at 5:00 p.m., \ndefendant shall certify to the Court that he has compiled a list of those persons (“medically \nvulnerable inmates”) currently held at the Weld County Jail who have one or more of the \nfollowing conditions: are 65 years and older, have chronic lung disease or moderate to \nsevere asthma, have serious heart conditions, are immunocompromised, have severe \nobesity, have diabetes, have chronic kidney disease and undergoing dialysis, or have \nliver disease. Defendant shall provide to the Court and plaintiffs a list of medically \nvulnerable inmates by inmate number, identifying for each what risk categories the inmate \nhas and explaining what process he used to identify medically vulnerable inmates.” [See \nECF 55, at 37-38]. \nAs outlined in the attached Second Supplemental Declaration of Captain Matthew \nTurner and Declaration of Undersheriff Donald Patch, the Weld County Sheriff’s Office \n(“WCSO”) and the Weld County Jail (“WCJ”) in consultation with WCJ contracted medical \nprovider Turn Key Health Clinics, Inc. (“TKHC”) engaged in a comprehensive effort to \nidentify those “medically vulnerable” inmates in the WCJ pursuant to the criteria provided \nby this Court. [See Second Supplemental Decl. of Captain Matthew Turner (“Turner 2d \n                                                 \n1 The Sheriff’s Submission should not be construed as his agreement with this \nCourt’s Order or a waiver of his right to appeal the Order under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 15\n \nSupp. Decl.”), ¶¶ 8-24, Exh. F; Decl. of Undersheriff Donald Patch (“Patch Decl.”), ¶¶ 8-\n24, Exh. G]. All inmates housed within the WCJ on May 13, 2020, were interviewed by \nTKHC medical staff. Initially, the questioning of all inmates began with the following verbal \nstatement: “Hi, we are conducting a screening of all patients in the facility to determine if \nyou are considered medically vulnerable to COVID-19.” Next, all inmates were asked if \nthey are 65 years of age or older. Finally, all inmates were asked if they had any of the \nfollowing chronic health conditions: chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma; \nserious heart conditions; immunocompromised; severe obesity; diabetes; chronic kidney \ndisease and undergoing dialysis; or liver disease. [See Turner 2d Supp. Decl., Exh. F, ¶ \n19; Patch Decl.,  Exh. G, ¶ 17]. And any inmate arriving at the WCJ following the \ncompletion of this screening through 8:00 AM on May 18, 2020 (the latest time the report \ncould be run in time to meet this Court’s deadline of 5:00 PM today) was also asked the \nsame  questions  with  the  same  introduction  of  the  question  being  related  to  being \n“medically vulnerable” to COVID-19 as defined by the Court. [See Turner 2d Supp. Decl., \nExh. F, ¶ 22; Patch Decl., Exh. G, ¶ 20]. The responses were compiled and then provided \nto this Court along with this submission. The data reveals a total of 89 inmates presently \nin the WCJ who are “medically vulnerable inmates” based on the definition adopted by \nthis Court. These inmates represent less than 20% of the WCJ’s total inmate population \ncurrent as of 8:00 AM May 18, 2020.2 \n                                                 \n2  For purposes of comparison, the TKHC medical staff also asked every current \nand  incoming  inmate  through  8:00  AM  on  May  18,  2020,  screening  questions  to \ndetermine  whether  they  qualified  as  a  “medically  vulnerable  inmate”  based  on  the \ndefinition advocated by the Plaintiffs in this litigation. [See Turner 2d Supp. Decl., Exh. F, \n¶ 18; Patch Decl., Exh. G, ¶ 16]. Plaintiffs’ definition of “medically vulnerable” inmates \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 15\n \nAll “medically vulnerable” inmates as defined by this Court will continue to be \ntracked by the WCSO in the WCJ jail management system. [See Turner 2d Supp. Decl., \nExh. F, ¶¶ 11-12; Patch Decl., Exh. G, ¶¶ 10-11]. All new arrivals at the WCJ will be \nscreened during the book-in process under the same protocol to ascertain whether they \nare “medically vulnerable” inmates. [See Turner 2d Supp. Decl., Exh. F, ¶¶ 11-12; Patch \nDecl., Exh. G, ¶¶ 10-11]. \nB. Social Distancing of “Medically Vulnerable” Inmates: \nNext, this Court “Ordered that, on or before by May 21, 2020, at 5:00 p.m., \ndefendant is ordered to institute the following policies or procedures in the Weld County \nJail: (1) A policy ensuring that, to the maximum extent possible considering the Jail’s \nphysical layout, population level, and classification needs, medically vulnerable inmates \nare ‘socially distanced’ from other inmates housed in the Jail. If social distancing is \n                                                 \nwas considerably broader than the definition adopted by this Court and included all \ninmates 55 years of age or older and also included many more chronic health conditions. \n[See Turner 2d Supp. Decl., Exh. F, ¶¶ 18, 20; Patch Decl., Exh. G, ¶¶ 16, 18]. The \nresponses  were  compiled  and  have  been  provided  to  this  Court  along  with  this \nsubmission. The data reveals a total of 390 of 450 inmates presently in the WCJ who are \n“medically vulnerable” inmates based on the expansive definition advocated by Plaintiffs \nand rejected by this Court. [See Turner 2d Supp. Decl., Exh. F, ¶ X]. Plaintiffs’ “medically \nvulnerable” inmate definition represents approximately 87% of the total current inmate \npopulation at the WCJ, approximately 4.25 times greater than the “medically vulnerable” \ninmate definition adopted by this Court. [See Turner 2d Supp. Decl., Exh. F, ¶¶ 20, 24, \n25; Patch Decl., Exh. G, ¶ 18]. These findings are consistent with the WCJ’s prior analysis \nof the issue and conclusion that almost everyone then in custody of the WCJ fit Plaintiffs’ \nbroad definition of “medically vulnerable” inmates. [See Turner 2d Supp. Decl., Exh. F, ¶ \n20, 24, 25; Patch Decl., Exh. G, ¶ 18]. As articulated during the April 30, 2020, hearing \nbefore this Court, the Sheriff’s, the WCSO’s, and the WCJ’s efforts to address COVID-19 \nat the WCJ therefore necessarily focused on all the inmates rather than a subset of \n“medically  vulnerable”  inmates,  particularly  given  the  fluctuation  of  the  number  of \n“medically vulnerable” inmates based on entries and exits from the WCJ daily. \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 15\n \neffectively impossible for some or all of the medically vulnerable inmates in the Jail, such \npolicy may be supplemented by housing medically vulnerable inmates together in one or \nmore pods.” [ECF 55, at 38]. \nThe WCSO analyzed and assessed the issue of socially distancing “medically \nvulnerable inmates” and arrived at the following policy: \nIn  light  of  the  importance  the  Court  assigned  to  social  distancing  of \n“medically vulnerable” inmates as defined by the Court (the definition used \nin this paragraph and all subsequent paragraphs) from all inmates who did \nnot qualify as such, and considering the WCJ’s physical layout, population \nlevel, and classification needs:  the “medically vulnerable” inmates will \nremain in their current cohorted “family units” to the extent they are cohorted \nonly with other “medically vulnerable” inmates in those cells;  the WCJ will \ntreat “medically vulnerable” inmates as a Special Management population \nwith in the WCJ; all housing units presently containing “medical vulnerable” \ninmates will go on modified lockdown protocol; the WCJ will stagger period \nrelease of “medically vulnerable” inmates and cohorts for their “hour out” \nunder this modified lockdown protocol, so “medically vulnerable” inmates \nare not out at the same time as inmates who are not “medically vulnerable” \ninmates, and only in groups of no more than 10 total persons (exclusive of \njail staff, e.g., up to 9 inmates and 9 Detentions Division Deputy); and to the \nlimited extent inmates who are not “medically vulnerable” currently are in a \ncell with those who are “medically vulnerable,” the WCJ will move the \ninmates who are not “medically vulnerable” out of those cells and will \nreassign them as appropriate throughout the WCJ and in consideration of \nboth Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 factors which affect where inmates can be \nhoused in the WCJ to the maximum extent possible. \n \n[See Supplemental Decl. of Sheriff Steven Reams (“Sheriff Supp. Decl.”), ¶ 15, Exh. H]. \nAs outlined in detail in the Supplemental Declaration of Sheriff Steven Reams, in \narriving at this policy, the WCSO took into account all applicable factors with regard to \nhow the WCJ must make individual inmate housing decisions. Those factors include the \nCOVID-19-related factors as well as all non-COVID-19-related classification factors. [See \nSheriff Supp. Decl., Exh. H, ¶ 16]. Specifically, regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic, \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 15\n \nthe WCJ is required to make classification decisions for purposes of housing all inmates \nbased on all of the many individualized factors relevant and appropriate to such decisions. \n[See Sheriff Supp. Decl., Exh. H, ¶ 16]. General classification issues are required to be \nconsidered related to this issue. [See Sheriff Supp. Decl., Exh. H, ¶ 16]. Moreover, \nconsiderations of the physical space available to the WCJ to house “medically vulnerable” \ninmates provided a significant constraint on the ability to single-cell such inmates. [See \nSheriff Supp. Decl., Exh. H, ¶ 16]. Finally, the WCSO had significant concerns about \nmoving “medically vulnerable” inmates from current living arrangements because of the \npotential for spreading COVID-19 based on the movement of inmates alone. The Sheriff \ndescribes the decision-making of the WCSO in this regard, as follows: \n  e.    Presently  89  WCJ  inmates  are  “medically  vulnerable,”  but \nunfortunately they are completely spread out amongst almost every custody \nlevel in the WCJ, in both male and female populations, with a variety of \ncriminal charges, and both convicted individuals and pretrial detainees. \n \n  f.  Even in the event the WCJ inmate population reaches a low \nenough number to allow the WCJ to realign its inmate housing situation \nsuch that even half of the “medically vulnerable” inmates could be single-\ncelled, several points of consideration create grave concerns and counsel \nstrongly against doing so: \n \ni.  Single-celling all “medically vulnerable” inmates will negatively \nimpact  non-“medically  vulnerable”  inmates  exponentially  as  an \nincreased number of non-“medically vulnerable” inmates would have \nto be celled together, necessitating the “mixing” of inmates and the \ncreation of new “family units” which of course potentially increases \nthe risk of transmission of COVID-19. \n \nii.  Although the Court made allowance that, if social distancing is \neffectively impossible for some or all “medically vulnerable” inmates \nin the WCJ, such policy may be supplemented by housing “medically \nvulnerable” inmates together in one or more pods, we are concerned \nthis will not be workable either. Our concern is because of what I will \ncall  the  “nursing  home  effect”.  That  is,  should  a  “medically \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 15\n \nvulnerable”  inmate  contract  COVID-19  in  such  a  situation,  that \ninmate  would  be  in  close  proximity  to  all  “medically  vulnerable” \ninmates in the WCJ, thus undoing what the Court presumably was \ntrying to accomplish by means of this allowance, and the risk of \nspreading COVID-19 to other “medically vulnerable” inmates would \nbe much too great. I read news reports indicating that, in April 2020, \nin a residential, non-hospital care nursing home facility in Greeley, \n14 residents died due to an outbreak, and similar outbreaks were \nseen  in facilities  like these  across  Colorado  and  throughout the \nUnited States. \n \niii.  Moreover,  mass  movement,  reallocation,  and  dispersal  of \ninmates from their current locations within the WCJ to new locations \nwithin the WCJ would be extremely disruptive to the safety and \nsecurity of the WCJ, its inmates, and my Detentions Division staff.  \nThis  is  true  both  because  of  the  potential  increased  spread  of \nCOVID-19 from such movement and intermingling of prior “family \nunits,”  but  also  because  of  the  general  safety  and  security \nconsiderations involved in wholesale movement of inmates in a jail \nsetting. \n \n[See Sheriff Supp. Decl., Exh. H, ¶ 16]. \nThe new WCSO social distancing policy for “medically vulnerable” inmates is the \nmost efficacious policy tailored to the physical layout, population level, and classification \nneeds of the WCJ and an appropriate response to specific COVID-19 concerns of moving \ninmates to different cohorts and “family units” yet keeping social distancing for everyone \nas much as possible given such factors. [See Sheriff Supp. Decl., Exh. H, ¶¶ 16-17]. \nC. Intake of “Medically Vulnerable” Inmates: \nIn addition, this Court “Ordered that, on or before by May 21, 2020, at 5:00 p.m., \ndefendant is ordered to institute the following policies or procedures in the Weld County \nJail: ... “(2) A procedure, as part of the intake of new inmates into the Jail, for medically \nvulnerable inmates to be singled-celled or otherwise socially distanced, to the maximum \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 15\n \nextent possible considering the Jail’s physical layout and classification needs, while \nhoused in the transition unit.” [ECF 55, at 38]. \nThe WCSO  analyzed  the  issue  of addressing  “medically  vulnerable” inmates \narriving in booking and intake at the WCJ and determined the following policy was \nappropriate considering all relevant factors: \nTo the maximum extent possible considering the WCJ’s physical layout, \npopulation level, and classification needs, “medically vulnerable” inmates \nas defined by the Court who are admitted to WCJ’s intake/transition units \nmust be housed in a cell within such unit alone and away from other \ninmates. If it is not possible to house a “medically vulnerable” inmate alone \nin a cell within an intake/transition unit due to the WCJ’s physical layout, \npopulation level, and classification needs, that inmate must be housed in a \ncell within an intake/transition unit with no more than one other inmate, \nwhich  inmate  must  also  be  “medically  vulnerable,”  in  accordance  with \ncohorting practices the CDC specifically outlines and endorses. If, despite \nthis allowance, it still is not possible to house a “medically vulnerable” \ninmate either alone or with only one other “medically vulnerable” inmate in \na cell within an intake/transition unit due to the WCJ’s physical layout, \npopulation level, and classification needs, and no other option is apparent, \nDetentions Division Deputies must contact a Shift Sergeant for guidance \nimmediately. \n \n[See Sheriff Supp. Decl., Exh. H, ¶ 19]. The Sheriff explained the process by which the \nWCSO arrived at this policy in his Supplemental Declaration. [See Sheriff Supp. Decl., \nExh. H, ¶¶ 20-21]. \nD. Enhanced Sanitation Procedures for “Medically Vulnerable” Inmates: \nFurther, this Court “Ordered that, on or before by May 21, 2020, at 5:00 p.m., \ndefendant is ordered to institute the following policies or procedures in the Weld County \nJail:  ...  “(3)  A  policy  of  enhanced  sanitation  procedures  in  areas  where  medically \nvulnerable inmates are housed. This may include expanded use of professional cleaning \nservices of the Jail and/or increasing the frequency with which trustees clean common \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 15\n \nareas in non-trustee pods. Such policy should be compliant with CDC guidelines for \ncleaning and disinfecting practices.” [ECF 55, at 38]. \nFollowing  an  assessment  and  analysis  of  all  relevant  factors,  the  WCSO \ndetermined the following policy was necessary and appropriate: \nDetentions Division staff, and not existing professional cleaning staff or \ninmate Trustees, will conduct enhanced sanitation of housing units housing \n“medically vulnerable” inmates as defined by the Court. Prior to “medically \nvulnerable” inmates entering any common area, Detentions Division staff \nwill spray HALT disinfectant spray on all surfaces in the common area open \nfor use by “medically vulnerable” inmates allowing 10 minutes of contact \ntime  for  complete  disinfection  to  occur  before  “medically  vulnerable” \ninmates  enter.  Common  areas  will  be  limited  in  size  for  “medically \nvulnerable” inmates (to half the typical common area) to ensure complete \ncleaning of phones, tables, handrails, bathroom facilities, sinks, toilets, and \nother similar common-area equipment inmates use regularly. “Medically \nvulnerable”  inmates  will  be  encouraged  to  practice  social  distancing \ncontinuously, to disinfect any commonly used equipment on their way out \nand their way in, and to increase their own cleaning practices to include \nfrequent  hand  washing  and  personal  sanitation.  “Medically  vulnerable” \ninmates who willfully refuse to adhere to recommended practices to prevent \nthe spread of COVID-19 despite such encouragements will be noted in the \nWCJ  records  management  system.  Whenever  possible,  “medically \nvulnerable” inmates will be housed in cells giving them immediate access \nto bathroom facilities (wet cell) within limits of the WCJ’s physical layout, \npopulation  level,  and  objective  classification  requirements.  Personal \nhygiene supplies and HALT disinfectant spray bottles will continue to remain \navailable to all inmates, inclusive of “medically vulnerable” inmates, without \ncost.  In  the  event  the  WCJ  inmate  population  reaches  a  low  enough \nthreshold that “medically vulnerable” inmates can be further distanced from \nnon-“medically vulnerable” inmates, when considering the WCJ’s physical \nlayout,  population  level,  and  objective  classification  requirements,  then \nevery  effort  will  be  taken  to  do  so  while  maintaining  such  objective \nclassification. If it becomes possible or appropriate to do so, despite the \nconcerns outlined above, units housing only “medically vulnerable” inmates \nwill be attempted, with particular emphasis on ensuring that movement to \nthis type of housing authorization can be done on more than just a “short \nterm” basis. Limiting movement from one housing unit to another to ensure \nprevention  of  cross-contamination  from  one  population  to  another \npopulation is consistent with the WCJ’s strong desire to ensure the health \nand safety of all involved. Increased supplies of HALT disinfectant spray \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 15\n \nhave been obtained and increased mask orders have been placed, yet \nincreased professional cleaning services may be required to augment what \nDetentions Division staff will be doing if this COVID-19 pandemic continues \npast the next 90 days. \n \n[See Sheriff Supp. Decl., Exh. H, ¶ 23]. The Sheriff explained in detail why Detentions \nDivision Deputies will need to be utilized for this cleaning protocol because of the lack of \nthe availability of resources of either inmate Trustees or professional cleaning staff for \nthis purpose. [See Sheriff Supp. Decl., Exh. H, ¶¶ 24-25]. \nE.  Obtaining Additional Inmate Masks: \nMoreover, this Court “Ordered that, on or before by May 21, 2020, at 5:00 p.m., \ndefendant is ordered to institute the following policies or procedures in the Weld County \nJail: ... (4) A plan to obtain a sufficient number or type of masks so that inmates do not \nneed to wear them for more than their intended duration or so that inmates may be able \nto clean them. ... Defendant shall explain in such report what steps the Jail has taken to \nacquire an adequate mask supply for inmates housed in the Jail.” [ECF 55, at 39]. \nThe WCSO has already implemented the following plan for obtaining additional \nsurgical and cloth masks for all inmates in the WCJ: \nSURGICAL MASKS: On April 24, 2020, my Office placed an order via the \nWeld  County  Office  of  Emergency  Management  (“OEM”)  for  1,000 \nsurgical/procedure masks specifically for inmate use. Then, on April 28, \n2020, my Office received 750 surgical/procedure masks of the 1,000 it \nordered. On May 5, 2020, my Office placed a second order via OEM for an \nadditional 1,000 surgical/procedure masks, again specifically for inmate \nuse.  Then,  on  May  8,  2020,  my  Office  received  all  1,000  of  these \nsurgical/procedure masks it ordered. On May 12, 2020, my Office placed a \nthird “standing order” via OEM for 1,200 surgical/procedure masks, once \nagain specifically for inmate use, which assuming it can be satisfied will \nprovide a sufficient supply of such masks to reissue WCJ inmates new \nmasks every 72 hours. Since this is a “standing order,” the supply of 1,200 \nmasks will sustain for approximately one week, then be replenished as \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 15\n \nscheduled for resubmission on a weekly basis. This “standing order” via \nOEM will remain in place until an adequate supply of reusable cloth masks \ncan be obtained. \n \nCLOTH MASKS: In addition, after several days of searching, my Office \nidentified two vendors to obtain reusable cloth masks, both of which have \nan estimated turn‐around time of early June 2020 to deliver them. On May \n13, 2020, my Office placed an order with both vendors, for 3,400 masks \ntotal and specifically for inmate use, which will ensure a ready supply to \nprovide each inmate with two cloth masks and also will afford enough time \nto order a resupply if needed to ensure an available stock of masks. My \nOffice  also  obtained  information  from  the  Colorado  Department  of \nCorrections  (“CDOC”)  concerning  a  new  program  administered  by  the \nCDOC and the Office of Governor Jared Polis to provide reusable cloth \nmasks to county detention facilities like the WCJ. To my knowledge, my \nOffice was the first county detention facility in the State of Colorado to apply \nfor such masks under this program, and on May 14, 2020, we applied for \n1,600  reusable  cloth  masks,  once  again  specifically  for  inmate  use. \nHowever, we have not yet received any confirmation on whether or when \nthose particular reusable cloth masks will be delivered as of the time of the \ncompletion of this Declaration. \n \n[See Sheriff Supp. Decl., Exh. H, ¶ 27]. The Sheriff explained the process by which the \nWCSO arrived at this plan in his Supplemental Declaration. [See Sheriff Supp. Decl., Exh. \nH, ¶ 28]. \nF.  Increased Monitoring of Symptoms for “Medically Vulnerable” Inmates: \nFinally, this Court Ordered that, on or before by May 21, 2020, at 5:00 p.m., \ndefendant is ordered to institute the following policies or procedures in the Weld County \nJail: ... (5) A policy providing for increased monitoring of medically vulnerable inmates for \nsymptoms of Covid-19.” [ECF 55, at 39]. \nApplication of all relevant factors after analysis has led the WCSO to adopt the \nfollowing policy concerning increased monitoring of symptoms for “medically vulnerable” \ninmates: \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 15\n \nThe WCJ medical staff, who are TKHC personnel, will perform four “daily \nchecks” on inmates who are classified as “medically vulnerable” as defined \nby the Court These daily checks will consist of full symptom screenings \naccording  to  the attached  second  updated  screening  protocol [which  I \nunderstand also to be Exh. F-2 to Captain Turner’s Second Supplemental \nDeclaration, as may be further enhanced by TKHC in the future] combined \nwith temperature checks. These measures for the “medically vulnerable” \ninmates will be in addition to the daily checks and monitoring of non-\n“medically vulnerable” inmates which already were occurring well prior to \nApril 30, 2020. \n \n[See Sheriff Supp. Decl., Exh. H, ¶ 30]. In his Supplemental Declaration, the Sheriff \nexplained in detail how the WCSO arrived at this policy and the specific factors relevant \nto the policy including monitoring requirements mandated by the Colorado Department of \nCorrections, Community Corrections, and Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo. \n[See Sheriff Supp. Decl., Exh. H, ¶ 31]. \nIII.  ARGUMENT \nSince the date this Court issued its Order partially granting the Plaintiffs’ Motion \nfor Preliminary Injunction and otherwise denying that Motion, the WCSO has worked very \nhard to assess and implement this Court’s Order in the six areas outlined above. All \nconsiderations leading to the policies and plans adopted by the WCSO in compliance with \nthis Court’s Order are outlined in detail in the Declarations provided to this Court and their \nattachments. The Sheriff and the WCSO strongly believe they have done what is possible \nand achievable in adopting these policies based on all relevant and applicable factors, \nboth COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related, including the WCJ’s physical layout, \nits population level, and the classification needs of every single inmate in the WCJ. \nThe WCJ has done and continues to do what it is able to do to address all issues \nrelated to COVID-19 including inmate separation within the confines of the physical plant \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 15\n \nof the WCJ and considering the daily fluctuations in the WCJ’s inmate population level \nalong with all objective individual classification needs relating to all WCJ inmates. The \nWCSO continues to work on these issues every day seeking guidance from all available \nsources and continuing to refine all applicable policies and protocols based on any new \nguidance disseminated from any of the many sources relied upon by the WCSO. Every \nday during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Sheriff, his leadership team, and all WCSO \nemployees have worked extremely hard and to their best of their individual and collective \nabilities to ensure all WCJ inmates, all staff who work at the WCJ, and all individuals who \ninteract at the WCJ remain as safe and healthy as possible based on the information the \nWCSO knows and is continuing to gather at regular intervals about COVID-19 and its \ntransmission and spread. This has been the overarching mission of the WCJ since before \nany outbreak began within the WCJ and will continue to be its mission as long as the \npandemic continues. [See Sheriff Supp. Decl., Exh. H, ¶ X]. This will continue to be true \ndespite the significant financial costs to the WCJ (and thus Weld County taxpayers) of the \nWCJ’s substantial operational modifications and the WCSO’s implementation of robust \npolicies and procedures designed to combat COVID-19. [See Patch Decl., Exh. G, ¶¶ 25-\n28]. This will continue to be true also despite the leveling off of confirmed COVID-19 cases \nwithin the WCJ. [See Turner 2d Supp. Decl., Exh. F, ¶¶ 26-28]. \nBased on this Submission and its attachments, the Sheriff respectfully requests \nthis Court conclude the Sheriff, the WCSO, and the WCJ (who share a unity of interest \nwith the Sheriff due to the official-capacity-only nature of this lawsuit) have complied \ncompletely with the terms of this Court’s Order dated May 11, 2020. \n \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 15\n \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nIn conclusion, based on the foregoing explanation and on all attachments to this \nSubmission, Defendant Steven Reams, Sheriff of Weld County, Colorado, in his official \ncapacity, respectfully requests this Court enter an Order: concluding the Defendant, along \nwith the Weld County Sheriff’s Office and the Weld County Jail, have complied completely \nwith the terms of this Court’s Order dated May 11, 2020; and granting all other and further \nrelief as this Court deems just and appropriate. \nDated this 18th day of May, 2020.   \nRespectfully submitted, \n \ns/Matthew J.Hegarty       \nMatthew J.

I have personal knowledge of the matters in this Declaration. \n2.  I currently serve as the Jail Captain for the Weld County Jail (“WCJ”) in the \nCounty of Weld, State of Colorado. I have served in this position for five months. \n3.  Before beginning my tenure as the WCSO Jail Captain on January 1, 2020, I \nwas employed with the Weld County Sheriff’s Office (“WCSO”) for eight (8) prior years \nand served in many positions: Corrections Officer (what is now called Detentions Deputy) \nand separately earned my Peace Officer Standards Training (“POST”) certification; Public \n1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-1   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 10\nInformation Officer Corporal; Detentions Division Shift Sergeant; Civil Unit Sergeant in \ncharge of civil service processors, animal control, and victim advocates; and Detentions \nDivision Lieutenant.  Of my eight years working for the WCSO, I have spent a total of 5.5 \nyears working in the WCJ. \n4.  I also earned an Associate of Arts degree in education from Front Range \nCommunity College in 2011 with a future goal to attain a Bachelor of Science in Criminal \nJustice from the University of Northern Colorado. \n5.  I am individually familiar with the protocols and processes the WCSO as a \nwhole generated, implemented, and refined in response to the global, national, and local \npublic health threat posed by the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) from February 27, 2020, \nthrough today, because I was personally involved in generating, implementing, refining, \nand approving all protocols and processes in consultation with a team of WCSO staff and \nlocal public health officials. All protocols and processes outlined in Sheriff Steven Reams’ \nDeclaration dated April 13, 2020, remains in effect today. All protocols and processes \noutlined in my Supplemental Declaration dated April 24, 2020, also remain in effect today. \n6.  I am further individually familiar with the protocols and processes the WCSO \nas a whole has generated, implemented, and refined from April 24, 2020, to date in \ncontinued consultation with the WCJ’s medical services vendor Turn Key Health Clinics \n(“TKHC”), as well as the Weld County Health Department (“WCHD”), both of which the \nWCSO  has  consulted  extensively.  These  additional  protocols  and  processes  have \nincluded a first updated screening tool which was finalized and started to be implemented \nduring the book-in process on April 28, 2020 [Exh. F-1], which corresponded with the \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-1   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 10\nCDC’s change in the list of COVID-19 symptoms a person may exhibit and which included \nboth this updated screening form as augmented by WCJ medical and an update by the \nWCJ to the flyers posted in housing units. These additional protocols and processes also \nincluded  a  second  updated  screening  tool  which  was  finalized  and  started  to  be \nimplemented during the book-in process as well on May 13, 2020 [Exh. F-2]. \n7.  I am moreover individually familiar with the protocols and processes the WCSO \nas a whole has generated, implemented, and refined following the entry of the District \nCourt’s Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction [ECF 55] in the above-captioned case, which I have read in its entirety. \nSUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL STEPS WCSO TOOK TO COMBAT COVID-19, IN \nCONSULTATION WITH WCJ’S MEDICAL SERVICES PROVIDER, FROM MAY 11, \n2020, TO PRESENT \n \n8.  ECF 55 was entered in the afternoon hours of May 11, 2020. \n9.  On May 12, 2020, the WCSO consulted with TKHC, its medical services \nvendor, to plan to interview all inmates and pretrial detainees (collectively “inmates” \nherein) then in custody at the WCJ, whether in general population housing units or in the \nintake/transition housing units, to ascertain whether they were “medically vulnerable” \nregarding COVID-19 under the limited criteria set forth by this Court. \n10. In furtherance of making such an interview process functionally possible and \naccomplished as expeditiously as possible, the WCJ’s Health Services Administrator \narranged for approximately 35 nurses to be on station at the WCJ on May 13, 2020. This \nrepresented a significant increase in the typical number of nurses who are scheduled to \nwork based on the WCJ’s contract with TKHC, usually 10 nurses on any given day. \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-1   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 10\n11. Also in furtherance of making such an interview process functionally possible \nand accomplished in as expeditious a manner as possible, TKHC developed a third \nupdated screening tool to use specifically during this process [Exh. F-3]. \n12. As of May 13, 2020, this detailed screening tool will now be a standard part of \nthe booking process for new arrivals to the WCJ, along with the first updated screening \ntool, until the COVID-19 pandemic resolves at some unknown future date, subject to \nfurther refinement as needed and in consultation with TKHC [see Exh. F-1 and F-2]. \n13. It is important to understand prior to the implementation of this new standard, \nwhile the WCJ had not yet performed a simultaneous COVID-19-specific assessment of \nthe medical conditions of all WCJ inmates, the WCJ had performed a quite similar \nassessment of medical conditions of WCJ inmates as needed on an individualized basis, \nand  specifically  when  housing  units  were  combined  to  make  room  for  more \nintake/transition units so the WCSO could house, to the best of its ability, those inmates \nwho might be more susceptible to COVID-19 given the physical-plant limitations of the \nWCJ and also given classification criteria which needed to be taken into account. \n14. Just after 8:00 AM May 13, 2020, the WCJ and its augmented staff of nurses \nfrom TKHC began performing this facility-wide screening of WCJ inmates to ascertain \nwhether they were “medically vulnerable” regarding COVID-19 under the limited criteria \nset forth by this Court and this process continued until about 3:00 PM that day. \n15. All 462 inmates then in custody in the WCJ on May 13, 2020 were interviewed. \n16. During the interview process, WCJ medical staff asked all inmates a series of \nquestions preceded by a verbal statement, which for the sake of consistency was read \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-1   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 10\nword-for-word to all inmates before the questions began, and that verbal statement was: \n“Hi, we are conducting a screening of all patients in the facility to determine if you are \nconsidered medically vulnerable to COVID 19.” \n17. All inmates were asked two categories of questions. \n18. First, inmates were asked questions relating to the expansive definition of \n“medically vulnerable” as proposed by the Plaintiffs in this case, which the Court rejected. \nAn inmate who verbally answered “yes” to any of the following questions was marked as \nMV55 in the WCJ jail management system: \na.  Are you 55 years of age or older? \nb.  Do  you  have  any  of  the  following  chronic  health  conditions:  Cancer; \nAutoimmune  disease  (including  lupus,  rheumatoid  arthritis,  psoriasis, \nSjogren’s, or Crohn’s); Chronic lung disease (including asthma, chronic \nobstructive  pulmonary  disease,  bronchiectasis,  idiopathic  pulmonary \nfibrosis, or other chronic condition associated with impaired lung function); \nHistory of cardiovascular disease; Chronic arthritis; Chronic liver or kidney \ndisease; Diabetes; Hypertension; Heart failure; HIV; On chronic steroids or \nother immunosuppressant medications for chronic conditions; History of \nsmoking or substance abuse disorder; or Pregnancy? \n19. Second, all inmates also were asked questions relating to the more limited \ndefinition  of  “medically  vulnerable”  adopted  by  this  Court.  An  inmate  who  verbally \nanswered “yes” to any of the following questions was marked as MV65 in the WCJ jail \nmanagement system: \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-1   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 10\na.  Are you 65 years of age or older? \nb.  Do you have any of the following chronic health conditions: Chronic lung \ndisease  or  moderate  to  severe  asthma;  Serious  heart  conditions; \nimmunocompromised; Severe obesity; Diabetes; Chronic kidney disease \nand undergoing dialysis; or Liver disease? \n20. As of May 13, 2020, the number of inmates then within the WCJ verbally \nanswering “yes” to the set of questions derived from this Court’s definition of “medically \nvulnerable” (19% of the WCJ population) was approximately 4.25 times fewer than the \nnumber of inmates verbally answering “yes” to the set of questions derived from Plaintiffs’ \nexpansive definition of “medically vulnerable” (almost 83% of the WCJ population). These \nfindings are consistent with the WCJ’s prior analysis of the issue that almost everyone \nthen in the custody of the WCJ fit Plaintiffs’ definition of “medically vulnerable,” and the \nWCSO’s earlier decisionmaking processes thus revolved around treating essentially the \nentire WCJ inmate population as “medically vulnerable” under Plaintiffs’ definition. \n21. After this data was collected, each form was reviewed to ensure the inmates \nwho gave affirmative verbal responses to the various sets of questions was appropriately \nmarked in the WCJ jail management system, allowing the WCSO to print a roster by \ninmate number and risk category as now provided to this Court. [Exh. F-4]. \n22. All inmates who entered the custody of the WCJ from after 3:00 PM on May \n13, 2020, to 8:00 AM on May 18, 2020, were asked the same two sets of questions, \nconsistent with the WCJ’s adoption of these questions into its pre-booking screening \nprotocol. Their responses also are included in the information provided in Exh. F-4. \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-1   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 10\n23. To date, the information provided verbally by inmates on May 13, 2020, and \nfrom 3:00 PM on May 13, 2020, to 8:00 AM on May 18, 2020, has not been verified \nindependently by WCJ medical staff, as the time required to do this would exceed the \nMay 18, 2020, 5:00 PM MDT deadline to respond to the Court. However, this verification \nprocess will take place this next week, as it will be necessary to ensure WCJ compliance \nwith the additional directive of increased monitoring of medically vulnerable inmates. \n24. As of 8:00 AM this morning (the latest the report could be run in time to submit \neverything to the Court by its 5:00 PM deadline), under the Court’s limited definition of \n“medically vulnerable,” the WCJ housed 89 “medically vulnerable” inmates out of 450 total \ninmates then housed by the WCJ (less than 20% of Jail population), which (although the \nraw number is much the same as May 13, 2020) did encompass both slight decreases \ndue to a small number of inmates who left WCJ custody for a variety of reasons (including \nbut not limited to transfers to the Colorado Department of Corrections and short-term \ninmates housed at the WCJ only for a matter of days), as well as slight increases due to \na small number of new arrestees the WCJ received since 3:00 PM on May 13, 2020, all \nof whom currently are housed in the WCJ’s intake/transition units according to Policy #2 \nwhich I understand was submitted to the Court today in the Supplemental Declaration of \nSheriff Steven Reams. \n25. But under Plaintiffs’ expansive and judicially-rejected definition of “medically \nvulnerable”, as of 8:00 AM this morning there were 390 inmates out of 450 total inmates \nthen housed by the WCJ (86.67% of Jail population) who would have been treated as \n“medically vulnerable” under said definition, which (again) is consistent with the WCJ’s \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-1   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 10\nprior analysis of the issue that almost everyone then in the custody of the WCJ fit Plaintiffs’ \ndefinition of “medically vulnerable,” and the WCSO’s earlier decisionmaking processes \nthus revolved around treating essentially the entire WCJ inmate population as “medically \nvulnerable” under Plaintiffs’ definition. \nDAILY DATA RESPECTING VARIOUS COVID-19-RELATED STATUSES OF WCJ \nINMATES AND STAFF FROM MAY 1, 2020 TO MAY 18, 2020 \n \n26. Further, it is important to provide the Court with additional context to show the \nefficacy of the WCSO’s extensive and comprehensive measures at the WCJ to slow, stop, \ncombat, and further guard against any additional spread of COVID-19 in the WCJ. \n27. I believed it prudent to at least go back and pull information relating to the data \npoints previously presented at the preliminary injunction hearing yet attributable to April \n30, 2020 until May 17, 2020. I now furnish that information to the Court. [Exh. F-5]. \n28. Review of this information reveals despite the passage of almost three more \nweeks since the April 30, 2020, preliminary injunction hearing, the number of confirmed \nCOVID-19 cases in the WCJ has leveled off, and the plans implemented on April 1, 2020, \nstill are in effect today and still are capable of effectively reacting to COVID-19. \n29. I understand the Court already is aware of the Sheriff’s Declaration submitted \non April 13, 2020, in this case, which detailed for the Court the limits on the physical plant \nof the WCJ given the statutory and state court judicial requirements under which the \nSheriff and his command staff and deputies labor to do their best to keep inmates safe. \n30. I also understand the Court is aware of the Sheriff’s Declaration concerning \nthe fact the Sheriff does not possess any legal authority to modify or revoke these pretrial \ndetainees’ bonds which are set by the state court judge presiding over their individual \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-1   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 10\ncases, and the fact the Sheriff possesses no legal authority to permit any of these inmates \nto serve their pretrial period at home or any other detention facility other than the WCJ as \nany such decision would have to be made by the state court judge. \n31. Despite these limitations which are a necessary consequence of Colorado’s \nstate court judicial system and criminal justice statutory regime, the WCJ has continued \nto work to attempt to single-cell inmates wherever and whenever possible while still \nmaintaining best practices for anti-transmission of communicable disease and addressing \nall of the custody issues, classification issues, and other specific issues which must be \ntaken into consideration in any housing placement of all inmates in the WCJ. \n32. The situation as it existed on April 24, 2020, as detailed in my Supplemental \nDeclaration, is particularly relevant in light of the average housing unit space as detailed \nabove, which even given the passage of more than three more weeks still is not enough \nto maintain six feet of distance between all inmates at all times within the WCJ. \n33. As of today, the WCJ currently houses 450 inmates. As previously articulated, \nthe Sheriff lacks the legal authority to release any of the inmates currently detained. \n34. The WCSO and the WCJ have done and continue to do what we are able to \ndo to address all issues related to COVID-19 including inmate separation within the \nconfines of the physical plant of the WCJ and the number of inmates at the WCJ. The \nWCSO and the WCJ continue to work on these issues every day seeking guidance from \nall available sources and continuing to refine all applicable policies and protocols based \non any new guidance disseminated from any of the many sources relied upon. Every day \nduring this pandemic, I have worked extremely hard to ensure to the best of my ability all \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-1   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of\n 10\ninmates at the WCJ, all staff who work there, and all individuals who interact at the WCJ \nremain as safe as possible based on all the information I know about COVID-19 and its \ntransmission and spread. That has been the mission of the WCJ since the outbreak began \nand will continue to be as long as it continues. Finally, as before, the last thing the WCSO \ndesires is to be compelled to adopt measures which completely undermine the effective \nsteps the WCSO has taken to plan for, slow, stop, and further guard against the spread \nof COVID-19. \n \nI understand the statements written in this Declaration are given under penalty of \nperjury.

As before, this number does not include medical \nor mental health providers at WCJ or non-inmate food service workers because the \nWCSO  does  not  have  access  to  any  data  regarding  medical  or  mental  health \nprofessionals at WCJ or non-inmate food service workers at WCJ, as these individuals \nare under the auspices of their own employers which are not the WCSO. \n                                                 \n3 The inmates administered a COVID-19 test were given a test on the basis of \nbeing designated “suspected positive” as that term is been defined by the CDC in the \nspecific context of correctional medicine, and which designation was made by a medical \nprofessional based on CDC guidelines. This is only a 1.16% “suspected positive” rate. \n4 This number is the same as that provided to the Court on April 30, 2020. This is \nonly a 0.448% “actual positive” rate. \n5 Both inmates who fall into this category were given an opportunity to be tested \nas they left the WCJ, one due to the natural expiration of a sentence and the other by \nvirtue of bonding out, but they each refused the test.

And this number \nincludes those two inmates identified in footnotes 1 and 2 supra who were new arrestees \nwho showed symptoms of COVID-19 and were placed on the WCJ’s existing COVID-19 \nmedical isolation protocol immediately upon completion of intake process without awaiting \na 14-day quarantine in any intake-transition unit. \n7 The one additional inmate who was transferred to a hospital specifically related \nto COVID-19 concerns was so transported after a determination was made by a medical \nprofessional based on CDC guidelines that transport should occur. \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-7   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 1 of 12\nEXHIBIT G\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO \n \nCivil Action No. 20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC \n \nTHOMAS CARRANZA; \nJESUS MARTINEZ; \nRICHARD BARNUM; \nTHOMAS LEWIS; \nMICHAEL WARD; \nCOLBY PROPES; and \nCHAD HUNTER, \n \n  Plaintiffs, on their own and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons, \n \nv. \n \nSTEVEN REAMS, Sheriff of Weld County, Colorado, in his official capacity, \n \nDefendant. \n                           \n \nDECLARATION OF UNDERSHERIFF DONALD PATCH \n                           \n \nI, Undersheriff Donald Patch, being of lawful age and duly sworn under penalty of \nperjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, and for my Declaration in the above-captioned \ncase, hereby declare as follows: \n1.  I have personal knowledge of the matters in this Declaration. \n2.  I am the Undersheriff for the Weld County Sheriff’s Office (“WCSO”), County of \nWeld, State of Colorado. I am second in command over the WCSO and report only to the \nSheriff. I have served in this position for four (4) years. \n3.  Before beginning my tenure as the WCSO Undersheriff on February 13, 2016, \nI was employed with the WCSO for sixteen (16) prior years and served in many positions: \nMounted Posse member (volunteer position); Corrections Officer (what is now called \n1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-7   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 12\nDetentions  Deputy);  Animal  Control  Officer;  I  earned  my  Peace  Officer  Standards \nTraining  (“POST”)  certification;  Patrol  Deputy;  Traffic  Deputy;  Detective;  Deputy  III \n(equivalent to corporal); Investigations Commander (equivalent to sergeant); Lieutenant; \nCaptain; and Undersheriff. Of my 20 total years working for the WCSO, I have spent a \ntotal of one (1) year working in the WCJ and four (4) years of administrative oversight of \nWCJ operations. \n4.  I also earned a Bachelor’s degree in Criminal Justice Administration from the \nUniversity of Phoenix. \n5.  I am individually familiar with the protocols and processes the WCSO as a \nwhole generated, implemented, and refined in response to the global, national, and local \npublic health threat posed by the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) from February 27, 2020, \nto today, because I was personally involved in generating, implementing, refining, and \napproving such protocols and processes in consultation with the leadership team of the \nWCSO and local public health officials. All protocols and processes outlined in Sheriff \nSteven Reams’ Declaration dated April 13, 2020, remain in effect today. All protocols and \nprocesses outlined in the Supplemental Declaration of WCSO Jail Captain Matt Turner \n(“Captain Turner”) dated April 24, 2020, also remain in effect today. \n6.  I am further individually familiar with the protocols and processes the WCSO \nas a whole has generated, implemented, and refined from April 24, 2020, to date in \ncontinued consultation with the WCJ’s medical services provider Turn Key Health Clinics \n(“TKHC”), as well as the Weld County Health Department (“WCHD”), both of which the \nWCSO has consulted extensively. \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-7   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 12\n7.  I am moreover individually familiar with the protocols and processes the WCSO \nas a whole has generated, implemented, and refined following the entry of the District \nCourt’s Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction [ECF 55] in the above-captioned case, which I have read in its entirety. \nSUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL STEPS WCSO TOOK TO COMBAT \nCOVID-19, IN CONSULTATION WITH WCJ’S MEDICAL \nSERVICES PROVIDER, FROM MAY 11, 2020, TO PRESENT \n \n8.  ECF 55 was entered in the afternoon hours of May 11, 2020. \n9.  On May 12, 2020, the WCSO consulted with TKHC to plan to interview all \ninmates and pretrial detainees (collectively “inmates” herein) then in custody at the WCJ, \nwhether in general population housing units or in the intake/transition housing units, to \nascertain whether they were “medically vulnerable” regarding COVID-19 under the limited \ncriteria set forth by this Court. \n10. In furtherance of making such an interview process functionally possible and \naccomplished in as expeditious a manner as possible, TKHC developed a third updated \nscreening tool to use during this process. \n11. As of May 13, 2020, this detailed screening tool will now be a standard part of \nthe booking process for new arrivals to the WCJ until the COVID-19 pandemic resolves \nat some unknown future date, subject to further refinement as needed and in consultation \nwith TKHC. \n12. It is important to understand prior to the implementation of this new standard, \nwhile the WCJ had not yet performed a simultaneous COVID-19-specific assessment of \nthe medical conditions of all WCJ inmates, the WCJ had performed a quite similar \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-7   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 12\nassessment of medical conditions of WCJ inmates as needed on an individualized basis, \nand  specifically  when  housing  units  were  combined  to  make  room  for  more \nintake/transition units so the WCSO could house, to the best of its ability, those inmates \nwho might be more susceptible to COVID-19 given the physical-plant limitations of the \nWCJ and also given objective classification needs and other criteria which were required \nto be taken into account. \n13. All 462 inmates then in custody in the WCJ on May 13, 2020 were interviewed. \n14. During the interview process, WCJ medical staff asked all inmates a series of \nquestions preceded by a verbal statement, which for the sake of consistency was read \nword-for-word to all inmates before the questions began, and that verbal statement was: \n“Hi, we are conducting a screening of all patients in the facility to determine if you are \nconsidered medically vulnerable to COVID 19.” \n15. All inmates were asked two categories of questions. \n16. First, inmates were asked questions relating to the expansive definition of \n“medically vulnerable” as proposed by the Plaintiffs in this case, which the Court rejected. \nAn inmate who verbally answered “yes” to any of the following questions was marked as \nMV55 in the WCJ jail management system: \na.  Are you 55 years of age or older? \nb.  Do  you  have  any  of  the  following  chronic  health  conditions:  Cancer; \nAutoimmune disease (including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Sjogren’s, or \nCrohn’s); Chronic lung disease (including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease, bronchiectasis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or other chronic condition \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-7   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 12\nassociated with impaired lung function); History of cardiovascular disease; Chronic \narthritis; Chronic liver or kidney disease; Diabetes; Hypertension; Heart failure; \nHIV; On chronic steroids or other immunosuppressant medications for chronic \nconditions; History of smoking or substance abuse disorder; or are you Pregnant? \n17. Second, all inmates also were asked questions relating to the more limited \ndefinition  of  “medically  vulnerable”  adopted  by  this  Court.  An  inmate  who  verbally \nanswered “yes” to any of the following questions was marked as MV65 in the WCJ jail \nmanagement system: \na.  Are you 65 years of age or older? \nb.  Do you have any of the following chronic health conditions: Chronic lung \ndisease  or  moderate  to  severe  asthma;  Serious  heart  conditions; \nimmunocompromised;  Severe  obesity;  Diabetes;  Chronic  kidney  disease  and \nundergoing dialysis; or Liver disease? \n18. As of May 13, 2020, the number of inmates then within the WCJ who verbally \nanswered “yes” to the set of questions derived from this Court’s definition of “medically \nvulnerable” was approximately 4.25 times fewer than the number of inmates who verbally \nanswered “yes” to the set of questions derived from Plaintiffs’ expansive definition of \n“medically vulnerable.” These findings are consistent with the WCJ’s prior analysis of the \nissue that almost everyone then in the custody of the WCJ as of April 30, 2020, fit \nPlaintiffs’ definition of “medically vulnerable.” \n19. After this data was collected, each form was reviewed to ensure the inmates \nwho gave affirmative verbal responses to the various sets of questions was appropriately \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-7   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 12\ntracked in the WCJ Jail Management System, allowing the WCSO to print a roster by \ninmate number and risk category as now provided to this Court. I understand the Court \nreceived this roster with Captain Turner’s Second Supplemental Declaration [Exh. F-4]. \n20. All inmates who entered the custody of the WCJ from after 3:00 PM on May \n13, 2020, to 8:00 AM on May 18, 2020, were asked the same two sets of questions, \nconsistent  with  the WCJ’s  adoption  of  these  questions  into  its  intake/transition  unit \nprotocol. Their responses are included in the information provided in Exh. F-4. \n21. To date, the information provided verbally by the inmates on May 13, 2020, \nand from after 3:00 PM on May 13, 2020, to 8:00 AM on May 18, 2020, has not been \nindependently verified by WCJ medical staff, as the time required to do this would exceed \nthe May 18, 2020, 5:00 PM MDT deadline to respond to the Court. This data entry \nincluded designation of a code in the system to be able to efficiently identify “medically \nvulnerable” inmates as defined by the Court in the Jail Management System. \n22. The results of these interviews were entered into the WCSO Jail Management \nSystem at my direction by Detentions Deputy Isabelle Himmel and by Captain Turner, \nand I also participated in the data entry. \n23. I enlisted the Weld County Department of Information Technology to create a \nreport that captured the code and to generate a list of “medically vulnerable” inmates as \ndefined by the Court. \n24. I used this report to generate a spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel, which I then \nsorted  and  categorized,  and  I  used  said  report  to  produce  the  final  report  of  the \ninformation required by the Court to be disclosed and which Exh. F-4 represents. \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-7   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 12\nSUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL COSTS THE WCSO \nHAS INCURRED, IS INCURRING, AND WILL INCUR TO COMBAT COVID-19 \n \n25. While the WCSO was preparing this data to furnish to the Court, it seemed \nprudent to me to ascertain the increased financial and operational costs which the WCSO \nhas incurred, is incurring, and will incur in connection with efforts to combat COVID-19. \nAccordingly, I personally ran the numbers contained in this Declaration on May 15, 2020. \n26. Normally, and prior to February 27, 2020 (the date the WCSO began its \nresponse to COVID-19), the WCSO’s average cost per day to house an inmate in the \nWCJ is $103.37. But averaged out over February 27, 2020, to May 15, 2020, the WCSO’s \naverage cost per day to house an inmate in the WCJ has increased to $146.59. \n27. This more than 40% increase in the average cost per day to the WCSO to \nhouse an inmate in the WCJ incorporates the following specific expenditures which have \nbeen occasioned solely for the WCSO’s response to COVID-19 and for no other reason. \na.  $3,419.00 in additional per-day deputy costs, all of which were attributable \nto WCSO deputies in the Courts division being reassigned to the WCJ not only \nbecause limited in-person court proceedings were occurring, but also because all \nsuch deputies are now required at the WCJ due to a sharp increase in daily tasks \nassigned to deputies. These new tasks include, but are not limited to: maintaining \nevery housing unit as open, even with a reduced inmate population, to ensure \nsocial distancing generally; increased incidents of remote court hearings in multiple \nhousing units simultaneously; increased sanitization of housing unit space by \nDetentions Division deputies; increased frequency of issuing PPE to inmates; \nincreased demand to manage hour-out time for inmates; increased frequency and \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-7   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 12\nuse of laundry facilities; and increased efforts for social distancing when moving \ninmates within the WCJ. It is worth noting that in normal times with average daily \npopulation this low in the WCJ, the WCSO could have fewer deputies than normal \nin the WCJ, but now we have many more deputies than normal even though inmate \nnumbers are so low due to the aforementioned sharp increase in daily tasks. \nb.  $19,725 in additional food costs, including a significant increase in meal \ncosts due to the continued decline in the average daily population of the WCJ, a \nsignificant increase in modifying the menu to be more conducive to grab-and-go \ntype provisions, a significant increase in Styrofoam serving supplies because \nwashing dishes is no longer indicated due to COVID-19, and staff overtime related \nto food preparation and service. \nc.  $29,573 in additional total costs for personal protective equipment (“PPE”), \nrepresenting a wide variety of PPE which the WCSO has had to acquire for various \nuses, including obtaining cloth masks for inmates, obtaining surgical masks for \ninmates, securing PPE for Detentions Division staff, and getting nitrile gloves. \nd.  $106,500 in additional medical costs, including testing kits for COVID-19, \nan increase in pharmacy costs, a significant increase in PPE specifically for WCJ \nmedical staff, a substantial increase in WCJ medical staffing, and an equally \nsubstantial increase in offsite medical costs. \ne.  $1,032 in medical and data processing costs specifically incurred on May \n13, 2020, to conduct “medically vulnerable” interviews as defined by the Court. \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-7   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 12\nf.  For the 82 days (February 27, 2020, through May 15, 2020) the WCJ has \nengaged in increased operations related to COVID-19 described for this Court in \nthe various Declarations from the Sheriff, Captain Turner, and me, the increased \naverage daily increased expense for COVID-19-related operational changes and \nsupplies has been $1,912.56 per day. This amounts to an additional projected \nannual expenditure of $699,996.96 if these measures have to be taken until \nFebruary 27, 2021.  Because of the uncertainty as to how COVID-19 will continue \nto impact future WCJ operations, the increased expenditures for future COVID-19 \nrelated operations and supplies remain largely unknown and unknowable. \n28. If the average daily population of the WCJ decreases to 400 inmates, the \naverage cost per day to the WCSO to house an inmate in the WCJ will then increase \ncorrespondingly to $220.99, a 113.7% increase in the average cost per day from the pre-\nCOVID-19 cost. If the average daily population of the WCJ decreases to 300 inmates, the \naverage cost per day to the WCSO to house an inmate in the WCJ will rise to $294.95, a \n185% increase in the average cost per day from the pre-COVID-19 cost. The WCSO will \nhave little ability to reduce certain costs, despite lower inmate numbers, because many \nmeasures taken to combat COVID-19 in the WCJ require ongoing efforts totally unrelated \nto inmate population numbers and because the WCSO must maintain increased staffing \nthat would not normally be necessary with such a comparatively low inmate population. \n29. I understand the Court already is aware of the Sheriff’s Declaration submitted \non April 13, 2020, in this case, which detailed for the Court the limits on the physical plant \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-7   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of\n 12\nof the WCJ given the statutory and state court judicial requirements under which the \nSheriff and his command staff and deputies labor to do their best to keep inmates safe. \n30. I also understand the Court is aware of the Sheriff’s Declaration concerning \nthe fact the Sheriff does not possess any legal authority to modify the type of, monetary \nsecurity allowed by, or other conditions of pretrial detainees’ bonds or to reconsider or \nreduce inmates’ sentences, all of which are set by the state court judge presiding over \nthe individual cases of each inmate, and the fact the Sheriff possesses no legal authority \nto permit any of these inmates to serve their sentences or pretrial period at home or any \nother detention facility other than the WCJ as any such decision would have to be made \nby a state court judge. \n31. Despite these limitations which are a necessary consequence of Colorado’s \nstate court judicial system and criminal justice statutory regime, the WCJ has continued \nto work to single-cell inmates wherever and whenever possible while still maintaining best \npractices for anti-transmission of communicable disease and addressing all of the custody \nissues,  classification  issues,  and  other  specific  issues  which  must  be  taken  into \nconsideration in any housing placement of all inmates in the WCJ. \n32. The situation as it existed on April 24, 2020, as detailed in Captain Turner’s \nSupplemental Declaration which I understand was filed with the Court that date, is \nparticularly relevant in light of the average housing unit space as detailed above, which \neven given the passage of more than three more weeks still is not enough to maintain six \nfeet of distance between all inmates at all times within the WCJ. \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-7   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of\n 12\n33. As of 8:00 AM today, the WCJ currently houses 450 inmates. As previously \narticulated, the Sheriff lacks the legal authority to release any of the inmates currently \ndetained. The release of any inmate by the appropriate judicial authorities, in my view, \nmust  necessarily  take  into  the  consideration  the  issue  of  the  public  safety  of  the \ncommunity from the reintroduction of the inmates into the general public based on issues \nof recidivism and the resulting potential danger to the community. \n34. The WCSO and the WCJ have done and continue to do what we are able to \naddress all issues related to COVID-19 including inmate distancing within the confines of \nthe physical plant of the WCJ and the number of inmates at the WCJ. The WCSO and \nthe WCJ continue to work on these issues every day seeking guidance from all available \nsources and continuing to refine all applicable policies and protocols based on new \nguidance disseminated from any of the many sources relied upon. Every day during this \npandemic, I have worked extremely hard and to the best of my ability to ensure all WCJ \ninmates, all staff who work there, and all individuals who interact at the WCJ remain as \nsafe as possible based on all the information I know about COVID-19 and its transmission \nand spread. That has been the mission of the WCJ since the outbreak began and will \ncontinue to be as long as it continues. Finally, as before, the last thing the WCSO desires \nis to be forced to adopt measures which completely undermine the effective steps we \nhave taken to plan for, slow, stop, and further guard against the spread of COVID-19. \n \nI understand the statements written in this Declaration are given under penalty of \nperjury.

I have personal knowledge of the matters set forth in this Declaration. \n2.  I currently serve as the duly elected Sheriff for the County of Weld, State of \nColorado. I have served as Sheriff for a total of five (5) years. \n3.  Before beginning my tenure as Weld County Sheriff on January 25, 2015, I was \nemployed with the Weld County Sheriff’s Office (“WCSO”) for eighteen (18) prior years \nand served in many positions: master control operator, Detentions Division officer, patrol \ndeputy after earning Peace Officer Standards Training (“POST”) certification, detective, \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-8   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 22\ncommander, Detentions Division deputy bureau chief, Patrol Division deputy bureau \nchief, Public Safety bureau chief, and Detentions Division bureau chief. \n4.  I  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  criminal  justice  from  Colorado  Technical \nUniversity in 2007, and I also completed the FBI National Academy in 2007. \n5.  I am individually familiar with the protocols and processes the WCSO as a \nwhole generated, implemented, and refined in response to the global, national, and local \npublic health threat posed by the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) from February 27, 2020, \nthrough today, because I was personally involved in generating, implementing, refining, \nand approving all protocols and processes in consultation with a team of WCSO staff and \nlocal public health officials. All protocols and processes outlined in my Declaration dated \nApril 13, 2020, remains in effect today. All protocols and processes outlined in the \nSupplemental Declaration of WCSO Jail Captain Matt Turner (“Captain Turner”) dated \nApril 24, 2020, also remains in effect today. \n6.  All decisions I have made and the WCSO has adopted at the Weld County Jail \n(“WCJ”)  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  from  February  27,  2020,  through  and \nincluding today and anticipated to continue on into the future, have been made based on \nan assessment of the health and safety needs of the inmates and detainees (hereinafter \ncollectively “inmates”), WCSO employees, and the public. All decisions I have made and \nthe WCSO has adopted at the WCJ related to the COVID-19 pandemic have also been \nmade based on the distinct operational needs of the WCJ as a jail; the physical plant, \nstructure, and layout of WCJ; and the resources and supplies available to the WCSO. As \nthis Declaration establishes, I and the WCSO continue to evaluate and respond to \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-8   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 22\ndifferent events which have occurred since COVID-19 became an issue for the WCSO \ngenerally and at the WCJ specifically and we will continue to do so. \n7.  I am further individually familiar with the protocols and processes the WCSO \nas a whole has generated, implemented, and refined from April 24, 2020, to date in \ncontinued consultation with the WCJ’s medical services provider Turn Key Health Clinics \n(“TKHC”), as well as the Weld County Health Department (“WCHD”), both of which the \nWCSO has consulted extensively. \n8.  I am moreover individually familiar with the protocols and processes the WCSO \nas a whole has generated, implemented, and refined following the entry of the District \nCourt’s Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction [ECF 55] in the above-captioned case, which I have read in its entirety. \nSUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL STEPS WCSO TOOK TO COMBAT COVID-19, IN \nCONSULTATION WITH WCJ’S MEDICAL SERVICES PROVIDER, FROM MAY 11, \n2020, TO PRESENT, INCLUDING IMPLEMENTATION OF ECF 55 \n \n9.  ECF 55 was entered in the afternoon hours of May 11, 2020. \n10. On May 12, 2020, the WCSO consulted with TKHC, its medical services \nprovider, to plan to interview all inmates and pretrial detainees (collectively “inmates” \nherein) then in custody at the WCJ, whether in general population housing units or in the \nintake/transition housing units, to ascertain whether they were “medically vulnerable” \nregarding COVID-19 under the limited criteria delineated by this Court. \n11. On May 13, 2020, the WCJ and an augmented nursing staff from TKHC began \naround 8:00 AM to perform a facility-wide screening of WCJ inmates to ascertain whether \nthey were “medically vulnerable” regarding COVID-19 under this Court’s criteria and this \nprocess continued until about 3:00 PM that day. \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-8   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 22\n12. Separately, beginning the morning of May 12, 2020, my command staff and I \nreviewed ECF 55 and assessed the ability of my Office to comply with this Court’s \ndirectives on pages 38-39 in the context of: the WCJ’s physical plant, structure, and \nlayout; the WCJ’s population needs; the classification needs my Office must take into \naccount when housing inmates; and the resources and supplies available to my Office. \n13. In furtherance of the directives on pages 38-39 of this Court’s Order, the \nfollowing represents the best efforts of my Office to implement this Court’s Order based \non the above context. \n(1) POLICY WCSO DEVELOPED, IN CONNECTION WITH EFFORTS TO COMBAT \nCOVID-19, TO SOCIALLY DISTANCE “MEDICALLY VULNERABLE” INMATES IN \nTHE WCJ FROM ALL OTHER INMATES NOT MEETING THAT DESCRIPTION \n \n14. First, on page 38, the WCJ had to institute “[a] policy ensuring that, to the \nmaximum extent possible considering the Jail’s physical layout, population level, and \nclassification needs, medically vulnerable inmates are ‘socially distanced’ from other \ninmates housed in the Jail. If social distancing is effectively impossible for some or all of \nthe medically vulnerable inmates in the Jail, such policy may be supplemented by housing \nmedically vulnerable inmates together in one or more pods.” \n15. POLICY: My Office considered and analyzed this particular directive from \nevery possible angle, and came up with the following policy to comply. In light of the \nimportance the Court assigned to social distancing of “medically vulnerable” inmates as \ndefined by the Court (the definition used in this paragraph and all subsequent paragraphs) \nfrom all inmates who did not qualify as such, and considering the WCJ’s physical layout, \npopulation level, and classification needs: the “medically vulnerable” inmates will remain \nin their current cells and in current cohorted “family units” to the extent they are cohorted \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-8   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 22\nonly with other “medically vulnerable” inmates in those cells; the WCJ will treat “medically \nvulnerable” inmates as a Special Management population within the WCJ; all housing \nunits presently containing “medically vulnerable” inmates will go on modified lockdown \nprotocol; the WCJ will stagger periodic release of “medically vulnerable” inmates and \ncohorts  for  their  “hour  out”  under  this  modified  lockdown  protocol,  so  “medically \nvulnerable” inmates are not out at the same time as inmates who are not “medically \nvulnerable”; all “medically vulnerable” inmates will spend time out of their cells only in the \ncommon areas which allow for social distancing, only with other “medically vulnerable” \ninmates, and only in groups of no more than 10 total persons (inclusive of jail staff, e.g., \nup to 9 inmates and 1 Detentions Division Deputy); and to the limited extent inmates who \nare not “medically vulnerable” currently are in a cell with those who are “medically \nvulnerable,” the WCJ will move the inmates who are not “medically vulnerable” out of \nthose  cells  and  will  reassign  them  as  appropriate  throughout  the  WCJ  and  in \nconsideration of both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 factors which affect where inmates \ncan be housed in the WCJ to the maximum extent possible. \n16. PROCESS: I believe it is important for the Court to understand my and my \nOffice’s thought processes behind this policy, so I have set them forth below. \na.  The CDC states social distancing is a cornerstone of reducing transmission \nof respiratory diseases like COVID-19 in detention environments, yet it recognizes \nsocial distancing is quite challenging to practice in detention environments. \nb.  No two inmates are alike. Every person in custody has individual needs and \nconcerns potentially affecting custody status. The WCJ has an approximate total \nof 302 cells, but it is not possible to fill all of them, as filling all of them would mean \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-8   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 22\nmixing in the same housing unit populations which should not be housed together \nfrom a detention facility management perspective. \nc.  Well before COVID-19 was a concern in the WCJ, many factors affected \nwhere inmates could be housed in the WCJ: Gender; Security classification (e.g., \nmaximum, medium, minimum); Intake risk assessment; Suicide risk; Mental health \nconsiderations;  Medical  isolation  (not  related  to  COVID-19);  Special  needs \nconsiderations;  Special  security  housing  (protective  custody);  Court-imposed \nseparation;  Security-imposed  separation;  Serious  violence  threat;  Behavioral \nissues; Known management problems; Physical size; and Inmate worker (trusty). \nd.  The COVID-19 pandemic added several factors, further complicating where \ninmates can be housed within the WCJ: COVID-19 isolation; Quarantine (due to \npossible close contact with a COVID-19 case); 14-day observation quarantine; \nIntake/transition units; designation as “suspected positive” for COVID-19; and \n“medically vulnerable” inmates. \ne.  Presently 89 out of 450 WCJ inmates (as of 8:00 AM today) are “medically \nvulnerable,” but unfortunately they are completely spread out amongst almost \nevery custody level in the WCJ, in both male and female populations, with a variety \nof criminal charges, and both convicted individuals and pretrial detainees. \nf.  Even in the event the WCJ inmate population reaches a low enough number \nto allow the WCJ to realign its inmate housing situation such that even half of the \n“medically  vulnerable”  inmates  could  be  single-celled,  several  points  of \nconsideration create grave concerns and counsel strongly against doing so: \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-8   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 22\ni.  Single-celling all “medically vulnerable” inmates will negatively impact \nnon-“medically vulnerable” inmates exponentially as an increased number \nof non-“medically vulnerable” inmates would have to be celled together, \nnecessitating the “mixing” of inmates and the creation of new “family units” \nwhich of course potentially increases the risk of transmission of COVID-19. \nii.  Although  the  Court  made  allowance  that,  if  social  distancing  is \neffectively impossible for some or all “medically vulnerable” inmates in the \nWCJ, such policy may be supplemented by housing “medically vulnerable” \ninmates together in one or more pods, we are concerned this will not be \nworkable either. Our concern is because of what I will call the “nursing home \neffect”. That is, should a “medically vulnerable” inmate contract COVID-19 \nin such a situation, that inmate would be in close proximity to all “medically \nvulnerable” inmates in the WCJ, thus undoing what the Court presumably \nwas  trying  to  accomplish  by  means of  this  allowance,  and  the  risk  of \nspreading  COVID-19 to  other  “medically  vulnerable”  inmates  would be \nmuch too great. I read news reports indicating that, in April 2020, in a \nresidential, non-hospital care nursing home facility in Greeley, 14 residents \ndied due to an outbreak, and similar outbreaks were seen in facilities like \nthese across Colorado and throughout the United States. \niii.  Moreover, mass movement, reallocation, and dispersal of inmates \nfrom their current locations within the WCJ to new locations within the WCJ \nwould be extremely disruptive to the safety and security of the WCJ, its \ninmates, and my Detentions Division staff. This is true both because of the \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-8   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 22\npotential  increased  spread  of  COVID-19  from  such  movement  and \nintermingling of prior “family units,” but also because of the general safety \nand security considerations involved in wholesale movement of inmates in \na jail setting. \ng.  All these factors combined make it very difficult to create a policy allowing \nfor housing all WCJ inmates in a manner which guarantees social distancing for \n“medically vulnerable” inmates as defined by the Court. \nh.  On May 14, 2020, the WCSO team responsible for the operations of the \nWCJ tried to create a plan to enable the WCJ to create housing units specifically \ndesignated for inmates who were classified as “medically vulnerable” as defined \nby the Court. Staff members of all ranks participated in this meeting, generating \nmultiple ideas, yet still having to account for all factors and concerns set forth \nabove. Due to the limitations of the WCJ’s physical layout, it was effectively \nimpossible to create housing units solely for the purpose of housing “medically \nvulnerable” inmates. To accomplish this, while still accounting for all factors listed \nabove, the WCJ would need somewhere between 8 and 12 additional housing \nunits as well as anywhere from 48 to 72 additional Detentions Division deputies to \noversee them. No bed space in any other detention facility or correctional facility \nis available for purchase to secure such units for current WCJ inmates. \ni.  Thus, the only option for the WCJ was: to create a policy ensuring that, to \nthe maximum extent possible considering its physical layout, population level, and \nclassification needs, “medically vulnerable” inmates are “socially distanced” from \nother  inmates  while  in  the  WCJ,  essentially  through  modified  lockdown  and \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-8   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 22\nstaggered release, when considering the other allowance the Court made for the \nWCJ to account for the risk to “medically vulnerable” inmates from noncompliant \ninmates by using family groupings or stagger release of individual cells, and trying \nto single-cell or cohort “medically vulnerable” inmates within their current housing \nunits based on objective classification, as well as on WCJ physical plant limitations \nin conjunction with current population and classification needs. These factors \nsimply will not allow for all “medically vulnerable” inmates to be housed in a \ncommon unit or units, nor can all “medically vulnerable” inmates be single-celled. \nj.  This sole option also had to encompass the need to keep three full housing \nunits for use solely as intake/transition units and one full housing unit open as an \nisolation unit for inmates who may test positive for COVID-19 in the future. \nk.  At bottom, continuing to use objective classification criteria and housing \n“medically vulnerable” inmates in the typical units and cells in which they normally \nwould be assigned provides the best opportunity to treat their potential medical \nneeds yet not subjecting WCJ operations and its other inmates to undue hardship. \n17. As I endeavored to explain to the Court in my testimony on April 30, 2020, the \nsocial distancing strategy implemented by the WCSO within the WCJ is tailored to the \nphysical layout, population level, and classification needs of the WCJ. \n(2) POLICY WCSO DEVELOPED, IN CONNECTION WITH EFFORTS TO COMBAT \nCOVID-19, TO SINGLE-CELL OR OTHERWISE SOCIALLY DISTANCE “MEDICALLY \nVULNERABLE” INMATES WITHIN THE WCJ’S INTAKE/TRANSITION UNITS \n \n18. Second, on page 38, the WCSO had to institute “[a] procedure, as part of the \nintake of new inmates into the Jail, for “medically vulnerable” inmates to be single-celled \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-8   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of\n 22\nor otherwise socially distanced, to the maximum extent possible considering the Jail’s \nphysical layout and classification needs, while housed in the transition unit.” \n19. POLICY: My Office considered and analyzed this particular directive from \nevery possible angle, and came up with the following policy to comply. To the maximum \nextent possible considering the WCJ’s physical layout, population level, and classification \nneeds, “medically vulnerable” inmates as defined by the Court who are admitted to WCJ’s \nintake/transition units must be housed in a cell within such unit alone and away from other \ninmates. If it is not possible to house a “medically vulnerable” inmate alone in a cell within \nan  intake/transition  unit  due  to  the  WCJ’s  physical  layout,  population  level,  and \nclassification needs, that inmate must be housed in a cell within an intake/transition unit \nwith no more than one other inmate, which inmate must also be “medically vulnerable,” \nin accordance with cohorting practices the CDC specifically outlines and endorses. If, \ndespite this allowance, it still is not possible to house a “medically vulnerable” inmate \neither alone or with only one other “medically vulnerable” inmate in a cell within an \nintake/transition unit due to the WCJ’s physical layout, population level, and classification \nneeds, and no other option is apparent, Detentions Division Deputies must contact a Shift \nSergeant for guidance immediately. \n20. PROCESS: I believe it is important for the Court to understand our thought \nprocesses behind this policy, so I have set them forth below. \na.  As stated above, when considering the WCJ’s physical layout, population \nlevel, and classification needs, only three housing units within the WCJ are able to \nbe used as intake/transition units. \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-8   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of\n 22\nb.  All non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 housing factors (and concerns relating to \nthe WCJ’s physical layout, population level, and classification needs) recounted \nextensively above in ¶¶ 16(a)-(k) of this Declaration, which the WCJ considered in \ndeveloping a policy for socially distancing “medically vulnerable” inmates within the \nWCJ, also equally applied to the development of this policy. \nc.  These factors combined make it very difficult to create a policy allowing for \nhousing all “medically vulnerable” inmates in a manner which guarantees they will \nbe single-celled or otherwise socially distanced while in intake/transition units due \nto the physical limitation of available units and number of cells inside those units. \n21. Thus, the only option for the WCJ was to create and implement the policy I \noutlined above with respect to “medically vulnerable” inmates in intake/transition units. \n(3) POLICY WCSO DEVELOPED, IN CONNECTION WITH EFFORTS TO COMBAT \nCOVID-19, TO ENHANCE SANITATION PROCEDURES IN AREAS WHERE \n“MEDICALLY VULNERABLE” INMATES MAY BE HOUSED \n \n22. Third, on page 38, my Office had to institute “[a] policy of enhanced sanitation \nprocedures in areas where medically vulnerable inmates are housed. This may include \nexpanded  use  of  professional  cleaning  services  of  the  Jail  and/or  increasing  the \nfrequency with which trustees clean common areas in non-trustee pods. Such policy \nshould be compliant with the CDC guidelines for cleaning and disinfecting practices.” \n23. POLICY: My Office considered and analyzed this particular directive from \nevery possible angle, and came up with the following policy to comply. Detentions Division \nstaff,  and  not  existing  professional  cleaning  staff  or  inmate  Trustees,  will  conduct \nenhanced sanitation of housing units housing “medically vulnerable” inmates as defined \nby  the  Court.  Prior  to  “medically  vulnerable”  inmates  entering  any  common  area, \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-8   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of\n 22\nDetentions Division staff will spray HALT disinfectant spray on all surfaces in the common \narea open for use by “medically vulnerable” inmates allowing 10 minutes of contact time \nfor complete disinfection to occur before “medically vulnerable” inmates enter. Common \nareas will be limited in size for “medically vulnerable” inmates (to half the typical common \narea) to ensure complete cleaning of phones, tables, handrails, bathroom facilities, sinks, \ntoilets,  and other  similar  common-area equipment  inmates use  regularly.  “Medically \nvulnerable” inmates will be encouraged to practice social distancing continuously, to \ndisinfect any commonly used equipment on their way out and their way in, and to increase \ntheir own cleaning practices to include frequent hand washing and personal sanitation. \n“Medically vulnerable” inmates who willfully refuse to adhere to recommended practices \nto prevent the spread of COVID-19 despite such encouragements will be noted in the \nWCJ records management system. Whenever possible, “medically vulnerable” inmates \nwill be housed in cells giving them immediate access to bathroom facilities (wet cell) within \nlimits  of  the  WCJ’s  physical  layout,  population  level,  and  objective  classification \nrequirements.  Personal  hygiene  supplies  and  HALT  disinfectant  spray  bottles  will \ncontinue to remain available to all inmates, inclusive of “medically vulnerable” inmates, \nwithout cost. In the event the WCJ inmate population reaches a low enough threshold \nthat  “medically  vulnerable”  inmates  can  be  further  distanced  from  non-“medically \nvulnerable” inmates, when considering the WCJ’s physical layout, population level, and \nobjective  classification  requirements, then  every  effort  will  be  taken  to do  so  while \nmaintaining such objective classification. If it becomes possible or appropriate to do so, \ndespite the concerns outlined above, units housing only “medically vulnerable” inmates \nwill be attempted, with particular emphasis on ensuring that movement to this type of \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-8   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of\n 22\nhousing authorization can be done on more than just a “short term” basis. Limiting \nmovement from one housing unit to another to ensure prevention of cross-contamination \nfrom one population to another population is consistent with the WCJ’s strong desire to \nensure the health and safety of all involved. Increased supplies of HALT disinfectant spray \nhave  been  obtained  and  increased  mask  orders  have  been  placed,  yet  increased \nprofessional cleaning services may be required to augment what Detentions Division staff \nwill be doing if this COVID-19 pandemic continues past the next 90 days. \n24. PROCESS: I believe it is important for the Court to understand our thought \nprocesses behind this policy, so I have set them forth below. \na.  All non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 housing factors (and concerns relating to \nthe WCJ’s physical layout, population level, and classification needs) recounted \nextensively above in ¶¶ 16(a)-(k) of this Declaration, which the WCJ considered in \ndeveloping a policy for socially distancing “medically vulnerable” inmates within the \nWCJ, also apply to the development of this policy. \nb.  Also, with specific regard to inmate Trustees, which by way of reminder can \nconsist only of a small subset of inmates who are sentenced to the WCJ (distinct \nfrom inmates sentenced to the Colorado Department of Corrections and awaiting \ntransport), not enough Trustee inmates currently are available to be assigned to \nclean housing units on a more frequent basis due to the substantial decrease in \noverall jail population. There simply are not enough Trustee inmates to provide for \n“in pod” trusty cleaners. Currently, the WCJ has only 7 inmates who are classified \nas Trustee inmates. As of May 16, 2020, there are only 2 Trustee inmates working \nin the WCJ kitchen. There are 3 Trustee inmates in one intake/transition unit which \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-8   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of\n 22\nhas not yet finished its 14-day observation period, and another 4 Trustee inmates \nin a second intake/transition unit which has not reached the capacity for its 14-day \nobservation period to be started—3 of whom will be out of custody by the time their \n14-day  observation  period  ends. The WCJ  is  experiencing  a  Trustee  inmate \nshortage right now, and any efforts to increase use of Trustee inmates cannot be \nmet because the WCJ does not have enough of such inmates to do so. \nc.  Further, with specific regard to the existing WCJ professional cleaning staff, \nthey are employed to clean the commonly-used areas of the WCJ. There are not \nenough professional cleaning staff to allocate their time to individual housing units \nwhere “medically vulnerable” inmates may be present. Also, the WCJ professional \ncleaning staff work a limited schedule of hours to allow for cleaning of common \nareas in the WCJ—during the early morning hours when there is low foot traffic in \nthe  facility—and  they  are  not  staffed  to  provide  24-hours,  7-days-per-week \ncleaning  services.  Nor  do  we  have  the  budget  to  modify  their  hours  or  hire \nadditional such staff. \nd.  Finally, with specific regard to how inmates are informed of their obligation \nto increase their own personal cleaning and personal sanitation practices, my \nOffice  and  its  staff  cannot  “order”  inmates  to  engage  in  cleaning  (or  social \ndistancing or mask wearing for that matter), whether “medically vulnerable” or \notherwise, as characterizing the communication in that fashion will have a host of \ncollateral consequences under the Code of Penal Discipline (e.g., a charge for \nDisobeying a Lawful Order) and my staff have no desire to invoke that provision, \nas it seems to us quite counterproductive to the environment we are trying to foster \n14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-8   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of\n 22\nin the WCJ. Instead, all we can and should do is “encourage” all inmates to engage \nin appropriate personal cleaning and personal sanitation practices. \n25. Thus, the only option for the WCJ was to create and implement the policy I \noutlined above with respect to enhanced sanitation procedures in areas where “medically \nvulnerable” inmates are housed, taking into account CDC guidelines for the same, and \nwhile still upholding the purpose of this particular directive. \n(4) PLAN WCSO DEVELOPED, IN CONNECTION WITH EFFORTS TO COMBAT \nCOVID-19, TO AUGMENT ALREADY-EXISTING INMATE ACCESS TO MASKS AND \nENSURE SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF MASKS TO INMATES \n \n26. Fourth, on page 39, my Office had to institute “[a] plan to obtain a sufficient \nnumber or type of masks so that inmates do not need to wear them for more than their \nintended duration or so that inmates may be able to clean them,” which I and my Office \nunderstand to be inclusive of the Court’s additional statement also on page 39 that \n“Defendant shall explain in such report what steps the Jail has taken to acquire an \nadequate mask supply for inmates housed in the Jail.” \n27. PLAN: My Office considered and analyzed this particular directive from every \npossible angle, and came up with the following plan in compliance with it.  \na.  SURGICAL MASKS: On April 24, 2020, my Office placed an order via the \nWeld  County  Office  of  Emergency  Management  (“OEM”)  for  1,000 \nsurgical/procedure masks specifically for inmate use. Then, on April 28, 2020, my \nOffice received 750 surgical/procedure masks of the 1,000 it ordered. On May 5, \n2020,  my  Office  placed  a  second  order  via  OEM  for  an  additional  1,000 \nsurgical/procedure masks, again specifically for inmate use. Then, on May 8, 2020, \nmy Office received all 1,000 of these surgical/procedure masks it ordered. On May \n15 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-8   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of\n 22\n12,  2020,  my  Office  placed  a  third  “standing  order”  via  OEM  for  1,200 \nsurgical/procedure masks, once again specifically for inmate use, which assuming \nit can be satisfied will provide a sufficient supply of such masks to reissue WCJ \ninmates new masks every 72 hours. Since this is a “standing order,” the supply of \n1,200 masks will sustain for approximately one week, then be replenished as \nscheduled for resubmission on a weekly basis. This “standing order” via OEM will \nremain in place until an adequate supply of reusable cloth masks can be obtained. \nb.  CLOTH MASKS: In addition, after several days of searching, my Office \nidentified two vendors to obtain reusable cloth masks, both of which have an \nestimated turn around time of early June 2020 to deliver them. On May 13, 2020, \nmy Office place‐d an order with both vendors, for 3,400 masks total and specifically \nfor inmate use, which will ensure a ready supply to provide each inmate with two \ncloth masks and also will afford enough time to order a resupply if needed to \nensure an available stock of masks. My Office also obtained information from the \nColorado  Department  of  Corrections  (“CDOC”)  concerning  a  new  program \nadministered by the CDOC and the Office of Governor Jared Polis to provide \nreusable cloth masks to county detention facilities like the WCJ. To my knowledge, \nmy Office was the first county detention facility in the State of Colorado to apply \nfor such masks under this program, and on May 14, 2020, we applied for 1,600 \nreusable cloth masks, once again specifically for inmate use. However, we have \nnot yet received any confirmation on whether or when those particular reusable \ncloth masks will be delivered as of the time of the completion of this Declaration. \n16 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-8   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of\n 22\n28. PROCESS: I believe it is important for the Court to understand our thought \nprocesses behind this plan, so I have set them forth below. \na.  All non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 housing factors (and concerns relating to \nthe WCJ’s physical layout, population level, and classification needs) recounted \nextensively above in ¶¶ 16(a)-(k) of this Declaration, which the WCJ considered in \ndeveloping a policy for socially distancing “medically vulnerable” inmates within the \nWCJ, also applied to this plan. \nb.   The WCJ intends to keep ordering both disposable masks and reusable \ncloth masks, as some WCJ inmates are short-term only (book in and bond out \nshortly after). Cloth masks (if the WCJ can obtain them in accordance with the \nmultiple efforts set forth above) likely will be issued only to long-term inmates, but \nwith regard to “medically vulnerable” inmates, the WCJ intends to continue to issue \nsuch inmates N95 masks (for their increased protection), as long as they remain \navailable, along with reusable cloth masks if the WCJ can get them in accordance \nwith the multiple efforts set forth above. \n(5) POLICY WCSO DEVELOPED, IN CONNECTION WITH EFFORTS TO COMBAT \nCOVID-19, TO MONITOR “MEDICALLY VULNERABLE” INMATES WITH \nINCREASING FREQUENCY FOR SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 \n \n29. Fifth, on page 39, my Office had to institute “[a] policy providing for increased \nmonitoring of medically vulnerable inmates for symptoms of COVID-19.” \n30. POLICY: My Office considered and analyzed this particular directive from \nevery possible angle, and came up with the following policy to comply. The WCJ medical \nstaff, who are TKHC personnel, will perform four “daily checks” on inmates who are \nclassified as “medically vulnerable” as defined by the Court These daily checks will \n17 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-8   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of\n 22\nconsist of full symptom screenings according to screening protocols which I understand \nto be attached to Captain Turner’s Second Supplemental Declaration submitted to the \nCourt  today,  as  may  be  further  enhanced  by  TKHC  in  the  future]  combined  with \ntemperature checks. These measures for the “medically vulnerable” inmates will be in \naddition to the daily checks and monitoring of non-“medically vulnerable” inmates which \nalready were occurring well prior to April 30, 2020. \n31. PROCESS: I believe it is important for the Court to understand our thought \nprocesses behind this policy, so I have set them forth below. \na.  All non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 housing factors (and concerns relating to \nthe WCJ’s physical layout, population level, and classification needs) recounted \nextensively above in ¶¶ 16(a)-(k) of this Declaration, which the WCJ considered in \ndeveloping a policy for socially distancing “medically vulnerable” inmates within the \nWCJ, also were employed in developing this policy. \nb.  Since April 1, 2020, the WCJ has implemented a number of procedures for \nimplementation by TKHC. These tasks include: screening every new inmate during \nthe booking/intake process; assessing inmates who are in medical isolation every \n4 hours; assessing all inmates in quarantine units twice daily; performing increased \nassessment of inmates in transition units; and screening inmates before they are \nmoved between housing units when consolidation is necessary. \nc.  In addition, my Office and TKHC also are required to conduct monitoring of \ninmates awaiting transfer to CDOC, Community Corrections, and Colorado Mental \nHealth Institute at Pueblo (“CMHIP”). Though these inmates do not belong to the \nWCJ, the facilities to which they do belong will not accept them from WCJ without \n18 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-8   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of\n 22\nrequired medical information, and instead of taking responsibility to assess such \ninmates within their own facilities, they mandate the WCJ do that work for them. \ni.  CDOC requires daily monitoring checks for 14 days before transfer can \nbe requested; but most inmates stay in WCJ custody much longer than 14 \ndays, which means these daily monitoring checks must also continue for \nthe duration of their stay at WCJ. \nii.  Community Corrections requires a one-time check prior to transfer. \niii.  CMHIP also requires a one-time check prior to transfer. \nd.  TKHC staffs the WCJ based on an objective application process in which \nmy Office requests a number of medical personnel based on the number of \ninmates in custody combined with the number and type of tasks which need \ncompletion.  Because  the  workload  of  WCJ  medical  staff  has  increased \ndramatically, TKHC now requires additional personnel to complete daily tasks in \ncombination with the extra work that has presented itself from this pandemic. \ne.  To get all of the above-mentioned tasks done as well as normal daily \noperations, TKHC recommends the addition of 2.5 full time employees. Based on \nfinancial data gathered when TKHC became the WCJ medical vendor in January \n2020, this would require my Office to request approximately $352,000 in additional \nfunds to staff these positions on a 24-hours basis. This number is presented as an \napproximate dollar amount, as my Office has not been given the final estimate from \nTKHC as of May 18, 2020, the date of the submission of this Declaration. While \nthis monetary request will represent a significant financial impact to Weld County \ncitizens, my Office is willing to make this request. \n19 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-8   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of\n 22\nf.  The policy set forth in ¶ 30 above is based on the current needs of the WCJ. \nIf the population starts to rise, my Office anticipates the WCJ’s needs will quickly \noutpace current ability for nursing staff to keep up with demand. \n32.  All five of these policies and plans will be implemented before 5:00 PM on \nMay 21, 2020, pursuant to the Court’s Order. \nADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS RESPECTING CLASSIFICATIONS DECISIONS \nWHICH THE WCSO MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT, AND WHICH THE COURT MUST \nENDEAVOR TO UNDERSTAND, IN CONNECTION WITH THE WCSO’S EFFORTS \nTO COMBAT COVID-19  \n \n33.   The WCSO’s general inmate classification policy must still be applied to all \ninmates in the WCJ. To ensure the safety and security of the WCJ, inmate classification \nmust be accomplished for all inmates during intake and throughout their detention in the \nWCJ. WCSO Policy 509 outlines in detail all factors applicable to classification and the \nclassification plan adopted by the WCSO for the WCJ. [See WCSO Policy 509, attached \nas Exh. H-1]. The WCJ continues to apply this classification system to all inmates at the \nWCJ, and it represents the most salient non-COVID-19 factor for housing decisions. In \naddition, however, a variety of other WCSO policies are applicable to the many different \ndecisions the WCJ makes and must make concerning how inmates are housed in the \nWCJ. These include the following: Inmate Reception [WCSO Policy 502, Exh. H-2]; \nInmate Screening and Evaluations [WCSO Policy 701, Exh. H-3]; Special Management \nInmates [WCSO Policy 505, Exh. H-4]; Suicide Prevention and Intervention [WCSO \nPolicy 707, Exh. H-5]; and Special Care Inmates [WCSO Policy 703, [Exh. H-6]. As a \nreview of these different policies demonstrates, a whole host of different factors must be \nconsidered in how inmates are appropriately housed in the WCJ. The overlay of these \n20 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-8   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of\n 22\nnon-COVID-19 considerations must be understood and appreciated in assessing how the \nWCJ can address COVID-19 generally and “medical vulnerable” inmates specifically. \nTHE BOTTOM LINE \n34. As of 8:00 AM today, the WCJ currently houses 450 inmates. As previously \narticulated, I lack the legal authority to release any of the inmates currently detained. The \nrelease of any inmate by the appropriate judicial authorities, in my view and that of my \nOffice, must necessarily take into the consideration the issue of the public safety of the \ncommunity from the reintroduction of the inmates into the general public based on issues \nof recidivism and the resulting potential danger to the community. \n35. The WCJ has done and continues to do what we are able to do to address all \nissues related to COVID-19 including inmate separation within the confines of the physical \nplant of the WCJ and the number of inmates at the WCJ. The WCSO continues to work \non these issues every day seeking guidance from all available sources and continuing to \nrefine all applicable policies and protocols based on any new guidance disseminated from \nany of the many sources relied upon. Every day during this pandemic, I and my staff have \nworked extremely hard and to the best of our ability to ensure all WCJ inmates, all staff \nwho work there, and all individuals who interact at the WCJ remain as safe as possible \nbased on all the information we know about COVID-19 and its transmission and spread. \nThat has been the mission of the WCJ since the outbreak began and will continue to be \nas long as it continues. Finally, as before, the last thing the WCSO desires is to be forced \nto adopt measures which completely undermine the effective steps we have taken to plan \nfor, slow, stop, combat, and further guard against the spread of COVID-19. \n \n21 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 60-8   Filed 05/18/20   USDC Colorado   Page 22 of\n 22\nI understand the statements written in this Declaration are given under penalty of \nperjury.

Follow-up staffing decisions will be based upon\nthe totality of the circumstances.\nIf and when possible, inmates placed on suicide watch shall be housed in a cell that has been\ndesigned to be suicide resistant. Prior to placing a suicidal inmate in any cell, staff should carefully\ninspect the area for objects that may pose a threat to the inmate’s safety.\nPhysical restraints should only be used as a last resort. The decision to use or discontinue use of\nrestraints should be made in consultation with the [ShiftCommander].\nUntil the inmate is evaluated by a mental health professional or suicide staffing committee, the\ninmate shall be subject to frequent direct visual observation.\nAn inmate will be removed from suicide watch when a mental health professional determines the\ninmate no longer poses a threat to him/herself.

Defendant’s actions have not been sufficient to moot1 any of Plaintiffs’ requested relief.  \n \nDue process requires that detainees in a jail be protected from conditions that “pose an \nunreasonable risk of serious damage to . . . future health.” Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 35 \n(1993). Plaintiffs all face a heightened risk of serious illness or death if they contract COVID-19, \nwhich is the very definition of a “substantial” risk of “serious harm.”  \n[Defendant’s] arguments fail to address the stark reality of this particular global \npublic health crisis. In the face of a deadly pandemic with no vaccine, no cure, \nlimited testing capacity, and the ability to spread quickly through asymptomatic \nhuman vectors, a “generalized risk” is a “substantial risk” of catching the COVID-\n19 virus for any group of human beings in highly confined conditions[.]  \n \nMalam v. Adducci, No. 20-10829, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59407, at *26-28 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 5, \n2020). It is indisputable “that the most effective way of preventing [COVID-19] infection is \n \n1 Unlike plaintiffs in Nellson v. Barnhart, Plaintiffs’ requested relief would add “additional \nmeasures beyond defendants' current screening, testing, and isolation procedures.” No. 20-cv-\n00756-PAB, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66971, at *15 (D. Colo. Apr. 16, 2020).  Further, as \ndiscussed below, there is a demonstrably wide gulf between Defendant’s purported policies and \nDefendant’s actual practices related to mitigation of the spread of COVID-19 in the jails. \n  1\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 49   Filed 04/28/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 13\navoiding interaction with those who are infected—more specifically, not touching them or the \nthings they touch, and not breathing the air they breathe.” Essien v. Barr, Civil Action No. 20-cv-\n1034-WJM, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72422, at *14-15 (D. Colo. Apr. 24, 2020).2 As such, it \ncannot pass constitutional muster that Plaintiffs, who are medically vulnerable, continue to be \nforced to share facilities with others who may be infected with a deadly virus, and particularly be \nforced to do so without putting in place basic, evidence-based measures to keep them safe. Gates \nv. Collier, 501 F.2d 1291, 1300-1303 (5th Cir. 1994) (cited with approval in Helling, 509 U.S. at \n34).3 Defendants’ failure to take the below-outlined basic measures, all of which Plaintiffs’ expert \nsays are necessary to protect high risk inmates, unreasonably risks Plaintiffs’ lives. \nFirst, Defendant has failed to take the single most important measure to stop the spread of \nCOVID-19: physical distancing4 of all inmates from one another (and staff when not necessitated \nby facility security) within the Weld County Jail.5 Defendant has failed to take the following \nreasonable steps (relating to physical distancing) to protect Plaintiffs from COVID-19: \n \n2 The conditions in the Weld County Jail are worse than those described by the court in Essien, \nwhere the court held that detainees had demonstrated that it was likely that they would catch the \nvirus where they spent “sixteen hours a day in a 7 x 9 foot cell—usually two to a cell”; shared “a \ntoilet and a sink”; shared cells that were part of a “pod that currently houses 49 total detainees” \nwhere those in the pod shared space that is “only one half [the size] of a basketball court”; shared \n“seven shower stalls, which are cleaned once per day” with the other members of their pod; and \nreceived only one “paper facemask” with no certainty as to when it would “be replaced” they. \n2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72422, at *14-15. \n3 See also Forbes v. Edgar, 112 F.3d 262, 266 (7th Cir. 1997); Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, \n477 (2d Cir. 1996). \n4 The key feature of physical distancing is that individuals be able to keep at least 6 feet apart \nfrom other individuals. Exhibit 1, Expert Declaration Of Carlos Franco-Paredes, p. 10-11. \n5 Again, Plaintiffs request that, should Defendant not be able to ensure that Plaintiffs are protected \nfrom COVID-19 exposure through physical distancing, this Court order the transfer of a sufficient \nnumber inmates to electronic home monitoring to allow for appropriate physical distancing within \nthe Weld County Jail. This Court, sitting as a single judge, may order that Defendant transfer \nprisoners to a safe facility or form of custody of his choosing. An order that prisoners be \ntransferred to receive adequate medical care or to be removed from areas where they would be \nexposed to deadly diseases is not a “prisoner release order” within the meaning of the PLRA and, \n  2\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 49   Filed 04/28/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 13\n(1) Plaintiffs (individuals that are considered high-risk by accepted medical guidelines) have \nnot been meaningfully physically distanced from other inmates, some of whom are likely to \nbe infected with COVID-19. Ex. 1, pp. 1-3, 9-11.6 Currently, in different units, and \nparticularly in the B and C units and in one of the transition units, individuals with high-risk \ncomorbidities are housed in cells with one to three other cellmates. Id., p. 8.  \n(2) High-risk individuals are not being identified, prioritized for single-celled housing, or \nprovided additional protective measure to increase physical distancing. Id. Instead, the high-\nrisk individuals are housed and treated like the other inmates. Id.7 This was “confusing” to \nDr. Franco-Paredes given that, in most of the units, there are many empty cells that \nremained unused, while other cells hold two to four people. Id. \n \nSecond, Defendant has failed to implement appropriate policies and protocols to identify \ninmates who are possibly carrying COVID-19 and quarantine those inmates from other \nindividuals. Defendant’s isolation practices are focused singularly on highly symptomatic \ninmates, which is a patently unreasonable response in the face of research reflecting that at least \n40% of viral spread is caused by asymptomatic people.  This phenomenon is playing out in \nColorado’s prisons right now.8 And, as Plaintiffs’ expert explains, it is likely playing out in the \nWeld County Jail, where asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic inmates in general population \nare likely contagious and spreading the virus. Plaintiffs’ expert observed no practices that \n \ntherefore, may be issued by a single-judge court. Under the PLRA, a “prison” is a “Federal, State, \nor local facility that incarcerates or detains.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(5). Plaintiffs are not asking that \nthey be sent anywhere other than a safe facility that incarcerates them—that is a place that \n“confin[es]” them, see Black’s Law Dictionary, Incarceration (11th ed. 2019) —and, therefore, \nthey do not seek a “prisoner release order” under the PLRA. See Gray v. Cnty. of Riverside, No. \n13 C 0444, Dkt. 191, at pp. 4-5 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 14, 2020) (recognizing that an order directing a \nsheriff to transfer detainees to a safer location is not a “prisoner release order”). \n6 Coronel v. Decker, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53954, 2020 WL 1487274, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, \n2020) (finding that containment efforts were inadequate where it took no \"specific action to \nprevent the spread of COVID-19 to high-risk individuals,\" such as isolation or \"special safety or \nhygiene protocols\").   \n7 Defendant’s response admits that Plaintiffs (who are clearly vulnerable individuals) have not \nbeen identified by Defendant’s supposed protocol for identifying medical vulnerable individuals. \n[Doc. #41], p. 11. \n8 This is no more evident than in the Sterling Correctional Facility where “the Department of \nCorrections performed prevalence testing after only a few confirmed cases of COVID-19 and a \nminimal number of symptomatic inmates” and the result was that “138 out of 255 inmates tested \npositive for the virus.” Ex. 1, p. 9. \n  3\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 49   Filed 04/28/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 13\naddressed the likelihood of asymptomatic inmates or ensured immediate isolation and testing of \nindividuals who had one or more mild symptoms of COVID-19. Ex. 1, p. 8. Inmates who report \nfever and cough in the Weld County Jail still are provided with Tylenol, rather than COVID-19 \nscreening, preventative isolation, and testing. Id. Moreover, it is clear that some individuals who \nwere admitted to the medical isolation unit (Unit 11) of the Weld County Jail were released from \nmedical isolation in around a week’s time (less than the CDC-recommended quarantine period) \nand were placed in cells with other inmates who had not been in quarantine. Id.  \nThird, Defendant continues to fail to implement daily thorough and professional \ndisinfecting and sanitizing of the Weld County Jail. Defendant implicitly admits that he is not \nhaving the Jail professionally cleaned (and not on an adequately regular basis). [Doc. #34], p. 34. \nPlaintiffs’ expert learned as much during his visit to the Jail. Ex. 1, p. 9; Cristian A.R. v. Decker, \nCivil Action No. 20-3600, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66658, at *34-35 (D.N.J. Apr. 12, 2020) \n(noting failure to clean posed unreasonable risk to inmates of contracting COVID-19).9 \nFinally, while there has been incremental progress on some measures that Plaintiffs \nrequested when they filed this lawsuit, “as prisons and courts around the country are beginning to \n \n9 The Court in Cristian A.R. found unconstitutional conditions that are markedly better than those \nin the Weld County Jail: “Petitioners spend 23.5 hours a day in cramped cells that they have to \nshare with another person and the remaining thirty minutes out of their cells in common areas. It \nis during those thirty minutes that the detainees are at high risk for COVID-19 exposure and \ntransmission. That brief period is the only time they have each day to take showers, make \ntelephone calls to family members and attorneys, visit the commissary, and use recreation areas. \nComing into close contact with frequently used items and shared spaces is unavoidable. \nRespondents do not state the Facilities clean and sanitize the common areas and frequently-\ntouched common items in-between each period during which new detainees and inmates leave \ntheir cells. Instead, they provide that cleaning occurs at least three or four times per day. \nAccordingly, even crediting the Facilities’ increased efforts to clean and disinfect shared spaces, \nRespondents cannot dispute that many, if not all, detainees use the common areas and objects in-\nbetween cleanings and are being exposed to potentially contaminated surfaces.

The requested relief that has been partially implemented includes:  \n(1) Providing hygiene supplies, including supplies to wash hands and disinfect common areas, \nto inmates at all times and free of charge, \na.  While hygiene products have been provided to inmates, cleaning is left entirely to \ninmates and is voluntary; shared toilets and sinks are often not cleaned between uses; \nstaff do not clean nor do they mandate that inmates clean between uses, Ex. 1, p. 9; \n(2) Providing personal protection equipment, including but not limited to masks, to all staff \nmembers and inmates, \na.  While surgical masks have been provided to inmates, they have been forced to wear \nthe same mask for approximately 10-12 days, in contravention of public health \nguidelines Ex. 1, pp.. 9, 11;  \n(3) Taking particularly heightened precautions with respect to food handling and delivery, \na.  There is no evidence that the inmates who are handling food are exempt from the \nabove-outlined problems within the Weld County Jail, including lengthy use of the \nsame personal protective equipment and failure to appropriately socially distance \nwithin food preparation areas;  \n(4) Providing accurate, up-to-date educational and informational materials regarding sanitation \nand prevention of COVID-19, the status of how COVID-19 is affecting the facility \nincluding the number of infected inmates and staff, and daily access to news reports \nregarding COVID-19, \na.  While Defendant has provided a video with educational materials, it has not informed \ninmates about the status of how COVID-19 is affecting the facility. \n \n2. The constitutionally inadequate COVID-19 response at the Weld County Jail is fully \nattributable to the final policymaker for the Jail: Defendant Reams.10 \n \n  2.1 Defendant Reams is a final policymaker. \n \nDefendant “is a final policymaker with regard to [the Weld County] jail, such that his \nactions ‘may fairly be said to be those of the municipality.’” Lopez v. LeMaster, 172 F.3d 756, \n763 (10th Cir. 1999) (quoting Bd. of the Cty. Comm’rs v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 404 (1997)); see \n \n10 Contrary to Defendant’s arguments, Plaintiffs need not plead a separate claim to implicate \nDefendant under Monell. In fact, doing so is improper. Municipal liability is simply another \ntheory of liability for a particular constitutional claim, not a stand-alone legal claim. See, e.g., \nWhiting v. City of Cathedral City, No. EDCV 13-250-BRO(CW), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64002, \nat *12 n.2 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 23, 2014) (“Supervisor liability or municipal liability is not a separate \nclaim for relief or cause of action, but a theory on why a supervisor or municipal defendant is \nliable on a claim or cause of action.”); Romero v. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs, 202 F. Supp. 3d 1223, \n1267 (D.N.M. 2016) (Browning, J.).  \n  5\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 49   Filed 04/28/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 13\nalso Layton v. Bd. of Cty. Comm’rs, 512 F. App’x 861, 870-72 (10th Cir. 2013).  A decision by \nmunicipal policymakers on a single occasion could satisfy the “official policy” requirement \nof Monell. Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469 (1986). Where action is directed by a \n“final policymaker,” the municipality is equally responsible whether that action is taken only \nonce or repeatedly. Id. at 484-85.11 \nHere, Defendant possesses final policymaking authority in the operation of the Weld \nCounty Jail and his decisions regarding the Jail’s response to COVID-19, in and of themselves, \nare the decisions of Weld County. “[F]inal policymaking authority is a legal issue to be \ndetermined by the court based on local and state law.” Randle v. City of Aurora, 69 F.3d 441, 447 \n(10th Cir. 1995) Colorado law explicitly grants that Defendant, as the elected Sheriff of Weld \nCounty, “shall have charge and custody of the jails of the county, and of the prisoners in the jails, \nand shall supervise them himself or herself or through a deputy or jailer.” C.R.S. § 30-10-511. \nDefendant’s authority as to the operation of the Weld County Jail is unlimited and unchecked.12 \nIn accordance with the undeniable fact that Sheriffs have complete authority over the operation of \ntheir county jail, courts have consistently found that Colorado sheriffs are final policymakers \nwhen it comes to the operation of jails. E.g. Cortese v. Black, 838 F. Supp. 485, 495-96 (D. Colo. \n1993) (holding that Larimer County Sheriff was a “final policymaker”); Carrillo v. Suthers, 2014 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 184359, *32 (D. Colo. December 29, 2014) (noting that “a sheriff is typically \nthe final policymaker for matters concerning the operations of a county jail”). \nThe circumstances of Defendant’s authority make clear that he is a final policymaker for \nthe Weld County Jail’s response to COVID-19. Defendant is in charge of the day to day decisions \n \n11 See Jett v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., 491 U.S. 701, 736-38 (1989); City of St. Louis v. \nPraprotnik, 485 U.S. 112 (1988). \n12 See, e.g., C.R.S. §§ 30-10-503, 504, 506 and 522. \n  6\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 49   Filed 04/28/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 13\nat Weld County Jail -- i.e., Defendant is not “meaningfully constrained by policies not of that \nofficial’s own making,” Defendant’s decisions are “final -- i.e., are [not] subject to any \nmeaningful review,” and the decision in how to respond to COVID-19 is “within the realm of \n[his] grant of authority” at state law. Randle, 69 F.3d at 448. Defendant makes no argument that \nhe answers to anyone, let alone another governing body within Weld County, for his decisions \nwithin the Weld County Jail. In fact, Defendant voluminously outlines the unilateral actions he \nhas taken within the Jail within the last two months. See [Doc. #26]; [Doc. #41]. This is \nquintessential final policymaker behavior.  \n2.2 Defendant Reams has been, and continues to be, deliberately indifferent. \nThe deliberate indifference exhibited by Defendant prior to the filing of this lawsuit is \noutlined extensively in Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order. [Doc. #1], pp. 40-45. \nThen, Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit. If Defendant had any argument before that he was unaware of \nthe deficiencies in his response to COVID-19, the Complaint itself served to put him on notice. \nAnd, Defendant has received further notice from the supplemental filings (including \ndeclarations). Yet, in the ensuing weeks, Defendant has abjectly failed in a number of regards (as \noutlined, supra, Section 1). The failure to remedy ongoing constitutional violations is “evidence \nof deliberate indifference on the part of a municipality.” Layton, 512 F. App’x at 870-72.13 \nDefendant’s deliberate indifference has been clear. And, as a final policymaker, Defendant’s \nconscious disregard, alone, of the risks presented by COVID-19 is enough to support municipal \nliability. Id. at 872. \n2.3 Defendant’s inaction continues to unreasonably risk the spread of COVID-19. \n \n13 See also Brown, 520 U.S. at 407 (“[A finalpolicymaker’s] continued adherence to an approach \nthat they know or should know has failed to prevent tortious conduct by employees may establish \nthe conscious disregard for the consequences of their action—the ‘deliberate indifference’—\nnecessary to trigger municipal liability.” (quoting City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 390 n.10)). \n  7\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 49   Filed 04/28/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 13\n \nDefendant Reams’ inaction, in the face of mounting evidence that a serious outbreak was \nlikely to transmit COVID-19 to Plaintiffs, is the “moving force” behind the violation of Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional rights. Brown, 520 U.S. at 404. Defendant’s continuing failure to take the above-\noutlined appropriate action demonstrates a “direct causal link,” see Brown, 520 U.S. at 404, \nbetween Defendant’s (in)action and Plaintiffs’ risk of catching COVID-19 and suffering serious \nillness or death. Layton, 512 F. App’x at 870-72 (finding deliberate indifference where sheriff \nknew of problems with the jail’s medical care, could have “taken any number of possible \nremedial actions”, but chose not to act). Therefore, if this Court finds that Plaintiffs have \ndemonstrated that they are exposed to an unreasonable and unconstitutional risk of harm from \nCOVID-19 by the Weld County Jail’s lack of response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Defendant is \nliable as the final policymaker for the Jail.14  \n3. Plaintiffs’ requested relief complies with the PLRA’s requirements. \nContrary to Defendant’s assertions, an injunction ordering Plaintiffs’ requested relief \nmeets the criteria required by the PLRA. The PLRA’s guidance “must be undertaken in light of \nboth the magnitude of existing constitutional violations and the available alternative remedies.” \nMorales Feliciano v. Rullan, 378 F.3d 42, 54 (1st Cir. 2004). Plaintiffs ask that this Court “do no \nmore than to order [correctional] officials to [comply with the constitution] in general terms and \nto verify that the plan they submit satisfies the relevant constitutional standards[.]” Westefer v. \nNeal, 682 F.3d 679, 686 (7th Cir. 2012). It is not this Court’s duty to micromanage Defendant’s \nimplementation of Plaintiffs’ requested relief (and, Defendant himself asks this Court not to do so \nin accordance with principles of federalism and comity, [Doc. #26]. p. 39). Plaintiffs have not \n \n14 See Layton, 512 F. App’x at 870-72 (holding that a sheriff’s “willingness—demonstrated by \ninaction—to permit seriously ill inmates to remain unmonitored in their cells evinces deliberate \nindifference for purposes of establishing municipal liability”). \n  8\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 49   Filed 04/28/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 13\noutlined hyper-specific relief but rather have asked the Court to order “defendant to draft and \npromulgate a plan, which leaves to the defendant discretion to determine the details of how to \ndeliver the relief ordered.” Pierce v. County of Orange, 761 F. Supp. 2d 915, 947-48 (C.D. Cal. \n2011).  \nFurther, with respect to the weight this Court must give to any adverse impact on public \nsafety or the operation of a criminal justice system, 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1), public safety is \nserved by the requested relief because “[c]learly the public has an interest in preventing the \nfurther spread of COVID-19.” Rafael L.O., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62389, 2020 WL 1808843, at \n*9.15 And, as noted above, Plaintiffs requested relief provides Defendant with flexibility to ensure \nefficiency. \n4. Irreparable Harm,16 Balance of Equities, and the Public Interest.17 \n \n15 See\talso\tBent v. Barr, No. 19-cv-06123-DMR, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62792, at *22-24 (N.D. \nCal. Apr. 9, 2020) (“Given that additional burdens on the health system in this crisis may lead to a \ngreater number of deaths among the public, public health considerations cannot be ignored in \nassessing… risk to the community.”). \n16 As the Supreme Court observed in Helling, “it would be odd to deny an injunction to inmates \nwho plainly proved an unsafe, life-threatening condition in their prison on the ground that nothing \nyet had happened to them.” 509 U.S. at 33.Plaintiffs “who all suffer from underlying medical \nconditions, may have a 20% chance of death if they contract COVID-19 (according to \npreliminary data from China), and they are detained in facilities where the virus is still \nspreading.” Cristian A.R. v. Decker, Civil Action No. 20-3600, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66658, at \n*38-39 (D.N.J. Apr. 12, 2020). They “cannot practically adhere to social distancing guidelines or \nthe adequate level of personal hygiene, that have been touted as the most effective means to \nthwart the spread of the virus.” See Rafael L.O., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62389, 2020 WL \n1808843, at *8. Certainly the threat of death qualifies as irreparable harm. \n17 Defendant spends a majority of his briefing on these subjects, leading the court on a wild goose \nchase. (Plaintiff does not request the release of inmates but, as a last resort, Plaintiff asks this \nCourt to transfer inmates to home confinement, which is dramatically different than release). \nWith that being said, Plaintiffs acknowledge that Defendant and the public have an interest in \nensuring Plaintiffs’ appearance at future court proceedings as well as preventing danger to the \ncommunity should they be transferred to home confinement. However, numerous courts “have \nrecognized the shifting nature of these interests in light of the COVID-19 pandemic” and held that \neven release serves the public interest. Bent, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62792, at *22-24 (collecting \ncases). \n  9\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 49   Filed 04/28/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 13\nPlaintiffs acknowledge that Defendant and the public have an interest in institutional \nsecurity, community safety, and the efficient use of government resources. However, Plaintiffs \nrequests will not affect these interests because Defendant has full authority as to how to \nimplement them. And, a chorus of courts now recognized that a risk to public safety “requires \nconsidering all factors,” including the “substantial medical and security challenges [that] would \nalmost certainly arise” in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak in a prison or detention \nfacility. Bent, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62792, at *22-24 (collecting cases). Simply put, preventing \nthe spread of COVID-19 in the Weld County Jail is in line with the interests that Defendant \nraises: it will benefit public safety, reduce use of government resources (preventative medicine is \nalways cheaper than more intensive procedures), and increase institutional security (should the \noutbreak escalate a shortage of healthy deputies will almost certainly occur). \n5. This Court should not require bond in this case.18 \n \nDefendant cites to no authority in his request for $1,000,000 bond. There is precedent, \nhowever, supporting Plaintiffs request that no bond be required in this case. 11A Charles Alan \nWright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 2954 n.29 (3d ed., Apr. 2016 update) (citing civil \nrights cases where the bond was excused or significantly reduced).  \n6. Conclusion and Requested Relief. \n  Plaintiffs have attached an amended order, outlining only the relief that is essential (and \nnarrowly tailored) to ensuring that Plaintiffs are not exposed to an unreasonable risk of \ncontracting COVID-19. See Exhibit 2. \nDated: April 28, 2020       \n          Respectfully submitted, \n \n \n18 Plaintiffs are inmates who are being held in jail because they cannot afford bond, and they do \nnot seek damages in this lawsuit. \n  10\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 49   Filed 04/28/20   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 13\ns/ Andy McNulty       \nAndy McNulty  \nMichael P.

Globally, as of today, there are \n2,790,936 confirmed cases and 195,920 deaths.  In the U.S., there are an increasing number of \nCOVID-19 cases and deaths. Since March 16, 2020, the epidemiologic curve demonstrates a \nlogarithmic increase in the number of cases with many major epicenters of transmission as it has \noccurred in the Pacific Northwest, New York, New Jersey, Florida, California, and Louisiana. \nEvery U.S. state is dealing with COVID-19 cases and the number of deaths continue to pile up. \nAs of today, there are approximately 890,524 cases and 51,017 deaths demonstrating that \ncommunity-based transmission clearly continues to occur. \n \nB) Medically vulnerable populations \n \nThere is growing number of confirmed cases in the U.S., increasing number of \nhospitalizations and admissions to intensive care units, and many deaths. In this wave of the \npandemic or in subsequent ones, it is likely the number of infected individuals may continue to \noccur.  \n \nAccording to the CDC, there are groups of individuals deemed at high risk to developing \nsevere disease and dying from this infection including those above 50 years of age and those \nwith underlying medical conditions (regardless of their age) (See Table).  These cases are also \namplifiers or hyper-spreaders of the infection since they tend to have high viral concentrations in \ntheir respiratory secretions.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 49-1   Filed 04/28/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 39\nThe clinical experience in China, South Korea, Italy, France, and Spain has shown that \n80% of confirmed cases tend to occur in persons 30-69 years of age regardless of having any \nunderlying medical conditions.  Of these, 20% develop severe clinical manifestations or become \ncritically ill. Among those with severe clinical manifestations regardless of their age or \nunderlying medical conditions, progress to respiratory failure, septic shock, and multiorgan \ndysfunction requiring intensive care support including the use of mechanical ventilator support. \nThe overall case fatality rate is 10-14% of those who develop severe disease. In China, 80% of \ndeaths occurred among adults > 60 years. \nAs of March 16, 2020, cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. reported by the CDC shows that \n31% of COVID-19 cases, 45% of hospitalizations, and 80% of deaths occurred among adults \naged > 65 years of age. Case-fatality in persons aged >85 ranging from 10-27%, followed by 3-\n11% among persons aged 65-84 years, 1% among persons aged 55-64 and <1% among persons \naged 20-54 years of age.  \n \n \n \n \nTable 1.

Case fatality for patients who developed \nrespiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction was 49%. \nFor people with these risk factors, COVID-19 can severely damage lung tissue, which requires \nan extensive period of rehabilitation, and in some cases, can cause a permanent loss of \nrespiratory capacity.  \nThere is preliminary evidence that persons with COVID-19 and recovering from severe disease \nand progress to extensive pulmonary disease including Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome \n(ARDS).  Long term sequelae of those with sepsis, ARDS and respiratory failure identified in the \nliterature include long-term cognitive impairment, psychological morbidities, neuromuscular \nweakness, pulmonary dysfunction, and ongoing healthcare utilization with reduced quality of life \nand need for rehabilitation services. \nCOVID-19 may also target the heart muscle, causing a medical condition called myocarditis, or \ninflammation of the heart muscle. Myocarditis can affect the heart muscle and electrical system, \nreducing the heart’s ability to pump. This reduction can lead to rapid or abnormal heart rhythms \nin the short term, and long-term heart failure that limits exercise tolerance and the ability to \nwork.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 49-1   Filed 04/28/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 39\nThe full description of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 requires to be completely elucidated. \nHowever, there is clinical evidence that in addition to the severe lung injury associated to this \nviral infection, some persons may also develop myocardial involvement that appears to be the \nresult of either direct viral infection or micro-thrombosis of the myocardial vasculature. From the \npublished case reports, myocarditis caused by this viral pathogen is associated with congestive \nheart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and deathj.  Similar to other viral myocarditis, most patients \nmay develop long-term myocardial damagek.  \nAmong persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 and developing COVID-19 severe disease systemic \ninflammation is associated with adverse outcomes. However, there is evidence that the use of \ncorticosteroids have not shown benefit and they might be more likely to harm when administered \nin persons with ARDS caused by COVID-19. Similar to influenza infection, acute lung injury \nand acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by the respiratory epithelial membrane \ndysfunction leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome.  Preliminary evidence from case \nreports and small cases series from China and South Korea confirm that there is minimal \ninflammation and evidence of cell necrosis in the form of apoptosis of the respiratory epithelium. \nThe resultant tissue hypoxia is responsible and potential concomitant bacterial sepsis contribute \nto multiorgan dysfunction and death. If a patient with COVID-19 develops myocarditis, \ncardiogenic shock caused by fulminant myocarditis may also contribute to the overall occurrence \nof multiple organ failure.  \nPatients can show the first symptoms of infection in as little as two days after exposure, and their \ncondition can seriously deteriorate in as little as five days or sooner \nThere is evidence of substantial undocumented infection facilitating the rapid dissemination of \nnovel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 which is responsible for 79% of documented cases of CoVID-\n19 in China.  Once an individual is exposed to this virus from either a symptomatic individual \n(21% of cases) or from asymptomatic individuals (79% of cases), the shortest incubation period \nis 3 days with a median incubation period of 5.1 (95% CI 4.5 to 5.8 days). Overall, 97.5% of \npersons who develop symptoms, do so within 11.5 days of the initial exposure.  \nMost persons with COVID-19 who develop severe disease do so immediately after admission or \nwithin 3-5 days from their initial presentation and representing 53% of those requiring intensive \ncare unit admissions and advanced supportive care.  \nThere is sufficient evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has an overwhelming impact in \nhealthcare utilization in all settings (China, South Korea, Italy, France, Germany, and others).  In \nthe U.S., current evidence demonstrates that COVID-19 can result in severe disease, including \nhospitalization (31%) and admission to an intensive care unit (53% of ICU admissions). To \nrespond to this overwhelming demand in ICU admissions, there is a need for a multidisciplinary \napproach that is time-consuming and requires highly-trained personnel including pulmonary and \ncritical care physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, phlebotomists, social workers, case \nmanagers. The care of this group of patients also requires subspecialists including nephrologists, \ninfectious disease physicians, hematologists, hospitalists, and others. Patients on mechanical \nventilation or requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation require additional staff including \nperfusionists and 1:1 dedicated nursing care.   Currently, many medical centers in urban and \nrural settings in the U.S. are functioning at full capacity.  It is therefore important to note that in \nthe potential outbreak occurring within an immigration detention center, the number of detainees \nthat will require transfer outside the facility for specialized care may exceed the capacity of local \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 49-1   Filed 04/28/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 39\nhealthcare systems.   This is particularly important in rural and semirural settings where many \nimmigration detention centers are located, and where they may have contact with a limited \nnumber of local medical centers.   \n \nNumerous organizations and research studies have used the age of 55 to define the lower limit of \nolder detainees at risk of developing severe COVID-19 disease. This consensus is based on the \nfact that detained people have consistently been identified as having higher levels of health \nproblems that reflect 10-15 years more progressed than chronological age. \n \nC) Jails and prisons in the U.S. are increasingly becoming epicenters of COVID-19 \ntransmission \nOver my 20 years of experience as an infectious disease clinician, I have provided care at \noutpatient clinics and during inpatient consultation services in infectious diseases to a large \nnumber of patients residing in jail and prison populations. A copy of my CV is presented in \nExhibit A.  \nAs an infectious disease clinician with a public health degree in the dynamics of \ninfectious disease epidemics and pandemics, I am concerned about the inevitable spread of \nCOVID-19 in jails, prisons, community corrections facilities, and juvenile detention centers. The \nconditions in these facilities do not allow for appropriate infection control protocols and will \nmake the current COVID-19 pandemic worse. Incarcerated populations have higher rates of \nunderlying illness and, by extension, will have a higher case fatality rate. It is now clear that \nasymptomatic individuals can spread this infection. With staff traveling between their homes and \nthe facilities, and newly arrested individuals brought in as others are released, containment of the \nvirus is not possible. Prisons and jails are becoming the epicenter of COVID-19 transmission in \nthe U.S. I can also certify that incarcerated individuals have a higher prevalence of chronic \nmedical conditions that place them at high risk of developing severe coronavirus disease and \npotentially dying from this infection. Some of these medical conditions include HIV/AIDS, \nuncontrolled diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other conditions. \nLike other viral pathogens, SARS-CoV-2 is closely dependent on the complexity of \nhuman behavior and human interactions. There are many documented outbreaks of respiratory \npathogens in jails and prisons in many countries. Custodial institutions have been the epicenter \nof outbreaks of infections amongst prisoners amplifying infections at rates far exceeding those in \nnon-incarcerated communities. Highly transmissible viral infections such as measles, mumps, \nand the novel coronavirus disseminates rapidly among inmates and staff and potentially into the \nlarger community.  Overcrowding, insufficient sanitation, poor ventilation, and inadequate \nhealthcare in prisons contribute to enabling these institutions as breeding grounds of infectious \ndisease outbreaks. Detention and incarceration involves large groups of people living in cohorts \nin confined spaces creating many challenges for curbing the spread of COVID-19. The number \nof single rooms in jails or prisons are insufficient to adhere to the recommended isolation and \nquarantine guidelines and limits the ability to implement stringent infection prevention practices.   \nThe SARS-CoV-2 ability to survive for prolonged periods on highly prevalent materials \nin custodial settings including non-porous surfaces and metallic surfaces complicates disinfection \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 49-1   Filed 04/28/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 39\npractices. It is exceedingly difficult to comply with established infection prevention protocols \nrecommending repeated disinfection and decontamination of all surfaces in jails and prisons \nresulting from the large number of inmates and complex human patterns of interactions between \ninmates and with the staff. A recent natural experiment inside a cruise ship demonstrated the \nrapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 among large crowds inside a closed environment. A total of \n696 cumulative cases of COVID-19 and 9 deaths occurred among the 3711 passengers inside the \nPrincess Diamond Cruise berthed at the port of Yokohama, Japan from February 03 to March 1, \n2020.   The most recent estimates demonstrate that the basic reproduction number of the SARS-\nCoV-2 is higher than previously estimated (R = 5.6) and higher than the influenza virus A/H N\n0 1 1 \nthat caused the 1918-1919 pandemic. In contrast to influenza viruses, transmission of this \ncoronavirus occurs by those with undetected infection having mild symptoms or asymptomatic \ninfection in up to 20% of cases. Thus, transmission of this viral pathogen in closed spaces with a \nlarge presence of individuals increases the frequency of exposure and infection. Without \ncomplete social distancing in imprisonment settings, our ability to reduce the transmission \ndynamics to achieve a R less than one is limited. \n0 \nThe current outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-Co-2) in different county jails and \nprisons in the U.S. highlights the ease of transmission of COVID-19 behind walls of jails and \nprisons. There is sufficient experience with this pandemic demonstrating that congested living \nconditions facilitate the spread of this infection.  Jails and prisons are epicenters for infectious \ndiseases because of the unavoidable close contact in often overcrowded, poorly ventilated, and \nunsanitary conditions. On April 14 the Bureau of Federal Prisons reported 446 cases among \ninmates and 248 cases among employees in 42 facilities and 11 Residential Reentry Centers \n(RRCs). However, by April 19, there were 495 cases among inmates, 309 cases among staff, and \n22 deaths distributed in 45 facilities and 19 RRCs. There are at least 1,300 confirmed cases of \nCOVID-19 tied to prisons and jails with at least 34 deaths when combining prisons and jails \nnationwide as per different reports. The revolving door of jails have fueled an increasing number \nof documented outbreaks in custodial institutions.  \n \nIt is a major challenge for security staff to practice hospital-level infection control \nmeasures to protect them from becoming infected with the novel coronavirus. In a hospital or \nnursing home, staff may move up and down a single hallway over their shift, and they may \ninteract with one patient at a time. In detention settings, officers move great distances, are asked \nto shout or yell commands to large numbers of people, routinely apply handcuffs and operate \nheavy doors/gates, operate large correctional keys and are trained in the use of force.  These \nbasic duties cause the personal protective equipment they are given to quickly break and become \nuseless, and even when in good working order, may impede their ability talk and be understood, \nin the case of masks. For officers working in or around patients at risk or with symptoms, there \nmay be an effort to have them wear protective gowns, as one would in any other setting with \nsimilar clinical risks. These gowns cover their radios, cut down tools and other equipment \nlocated on their belts and in my experience working with correctional staff, are basically \nimpossible to use as a correctional officer. \nAn additional concern for transmission in carceral settings is the fact that COVID-19 may be \npotentially transmitted through aerosolized fecal contact or contact with infected feces when \nusing an infected toilet. This is relevant because the plume of aerosolized fecal material that \noccurs when a toilet is flushed is not addressable by closing the lid of ICE detainee toilets, which \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 49-1   Filed 04/28/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 39\nlack a lid. This mode of transmission would pose a threat to anyone sharing a cell with a person \nwho has COVID-19 and could occur before a person becomes symptomatic. This mode of \ntransmission could also extend beyond cellmates, especially in circumstances where common \nbathrooms exist or where open communication between cells exists.  \nD) Situational analysis of the State of Colorado and Weld County \nThe State of Colorado has 10,447 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 486 deaths.  After Denver \nCounty and Arapahoe County, Weld County is the third county with the highest number of cases \n(1353) and the third with the highest number of deaths (84).  \nE) Weld County Jail \nInformational Sources related to the Weld County Jail. \nIn preparing the portion of this declaration related to conditions of the Weld County Jail, I have \nreviewed all of Plaintiffs’ declarations in this case, as well as Sheriff Reams’ declaration and the \ndeclarations attached to Defendant’s Supplemental Response [ECF 39].  I also performed two \njail inspections that lasted approximately three hours each, once on April 10 and once on April \n24.  Between those two inspections, I spoke with 13 incarcerated persons about conditions in the \njail and I spoke with several correctional staff and medical staff.  I found the Weld County \ncorrectional staff to be forthright and welcoming, and they were open to questions and gave me \nample opportunity to speak openly with inmates who chose to converse with me.  Likewise, I \nfound the inmates with whom I spoke to be open and forthright, and their accounts were largely \nconsistent with one another of the relevant conditions in the jail related to COVID-19. \nApril 10 Inspection \nI had the opportunity to tour the Weld County Jail and interview some members of the medical \nstaff and inmates on April 10.   \nAs of April 10, Weld County staff reported to me that Weld County Jail had 14 COVID-19 \ncases, including 6 with positive tests and 8 presumptive cases.  On April 10, they had isolated \nthese 13 people in Unit 11 (Medical Isolation Unit).  At least one of the inmates with COVID \nhoused in the jail was receiving supplemental oxygen.  A fifteenth person was COVID-19 \npositive at the jail, but so sick as to need hospital transfer.  I learned from staff and through an in-\nperson interview that, in mid-March, that Mr. Anthony Griego was the 14th case that was \ntransferred to a local hospital due to the severity of his illness.  He then returned to the jail but \nwas then transferred back to the hospital on April 23 or 24 because of worsening symptoms.  \nSince the April 10 tour, I have learned that another Weld County inmate, Charles Peterson, was \nreportedly released from the Weld County Jail very sick Monday March 30. According to his \ndeath certificate, Mr. Peterson was 78 years old and, thus, high risk for serious illness or death \nunder CDC guidelines.  His death certificate also indicates congestive heart failure and diabetes \nmellitus as underlying conditions, both of which would put Mr. Peterson in a high risk category \neven absent his advanced age.  He had reportedly been in the jail since March 11.  Upon his \nrelease, he was reportedly taken almost immediately to the hospital. He died there two days later \non April 1, 2020.  His death certificate  lists “COVID-19 infection” as a cause of death, along \nwith acute respiratory failure and viral pneumonia, which are commonly caused by COVID-19 \ninfection.    \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 49-1   Filed 04/28/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 39\nBased on my conversations with staff and inmates on April 10, as well as inmate accounts \nconveyed in declarations filed in this case, it appears that before April 7 or April 8, Weld County \nJail was not adhering to CDC guidance recommendations in a meaningful manner.   \nMr. Peterson and Mr. Griego were likely what has been defined as ‘superpreaders’ of the \ninfection. Theywere reportedly sick and kept in general population without social distancing, and \nthey likely acted as the epicenter of the outbreak in the Weld County Jail.  Because of age and \nunderlying illness, they both developed severe disease.  \nThere were two jail units under quarantine.  \nDuring my inspection, I observed and received information from correctional officers and \ninmates that Weld County Jail was implementing some mitigating interventions according to \nCDC guidelines including reducing the jail population and spreading inmates out to decrease the \nnumbers within cells; staggering pod time and limiting the number of people on the pod at any \ngiven time; providing inmates with masks, isolating sick inmates; performing limited testing of \nsick inmates; making cleaning supplies more readily available, and providing some education \nregarding COVID-19 to inmates.  I saw evidence of these changes, but noted several substantial \ndeficiencies which remained in the April 24 inspection, and which I describe further below. \nApril 24 Inspection \nDuring the first inspection, there were 13 inmates in the medical unit with a combination of \nprobable and confirmed COVID-19 cases. After today’s inspection, there were only 7 COVID-\n19 cases in the male medical unit.  I observed that four of them were receiving supplemental \noxygen and several of them were bunked two to a cell.  There are currently no units on \nquarantine.  \nIn different units, particularly in the B unit and in one of the transition units, I observed that \nindividuals with high-risk comorbidities were housed in cells with between one and three other \ncellmates where social distancing is not possible. I did not see evidence that high risk individuals \nwere being identified for single-celled housing or increased social distancing.  The high risk \nindividuals I interviewed were housed and treated like the other inmates. \nThis was a bit confusing given that in most of the units I visited, there were many empty cells \nthat remained unused, while the occupied cells held 2 to 4 people. \nI learned that some individuals that were admitted to the medical isolation unit (Unit 11) stayed \nless than the recommended quarantine period as per CDC guidelines, and were released from \nmedical isolation in around a week’s time.  They were then placed in cells with other inmates \nwho had not been in quarantine. \nI also spoke to several inmates who had experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19, \nincluding cough or fever.  These inmates had not been tested for COVID-19 and remained \nhoused with other cell mates with whom they could not practice social distancing. \nI saw no practices to address the likelihood of asymptomatic inmates.  I saw no practices that \nreflected immediate isolation and testing of individuals who had one or more mild symptoms of \nCOVID-19.  Inmates consistently reported that fever and cough resulted in the provision of \nTylenol, rather than COVID-19 screening, preventative isolation, and testing. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 49-1   Filed 04/28/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 39\nAll inmates, except those in medical isolation, reported that they rarely if ever have their \ntemperature checked and they are not asked by staff about symptoms of COVID-19. \nMost inmates reported that cleaning is left entirely to inmates and is voluntary; that shared toilets \nand sinks are often not cleaned between uses, that staff do not clean nor do they mandate that \ninmates clean between uses. \nMost inmates are housed in dry cells, locked down 22 ½ hours a day without access to supplies \nto clean their hands unless they are let out of their cell to use the common bathroom. \nWhile all inmates had a disposable mask, they also all reported that they had only had two masks \nin the last 14 days.  As a result, they had the to wear one disposable mask for between 10-12 \ndays before they got a new one. \nOne major concern observed today is that Unit A, which during the initial inspection was a \nquarantined unit - where it is likely the place where COVID-19 outbreak initiated - is now used \nas an intake unit.  Inmates that were housed in unit A were transferred a few days ago to units B \nand C.  Without testing those inmates in unit A prior to their transfer for the presence of \nasymptomatic coronavirus infection, they could introduce the infection to these two other units.  \nIn fact, this is likely given the fact that asymptomatic infection may be responsible for 44% of \ncoronavirus transmission.  \n \nOPINION \nThe leadership and the staff at the Weld County Jail have instituted a substantial number of \ninterventions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and improve the safety of the inmate \npopulation. Additionally, I would like to note that the Deputy Officers and other staff who \nparticipated during these two inspections were extremely collaborative during the two \ninspections conducted at Weld County Jail (April 10 and April 24). It is also my opinion that \nthere is the willingness and the openness to listen to potential recommendations that may \nstrengthen existing efforts to improve the safety of the inmates and the staff.  \nAs recent evidence indicates from other jails in other States and more recently from Sterling \nprison in Colorado, the presence of even a small outbreak of cases of COVID-19 only indicates \nthe tip of the iceberg of a larger number of undetected cases in those with no symptoms or mild \nsymptoms, which constitutes approximately 80% of cases.  In Sterling Correctional Facility, \nwhere the Department of Corrections performed prevalence testing after only a few confirmed \ncases of COVID-19 and a minimal number of symptomatic inmates, 138 out of 255 inmates \ntested positive for the virus.  There is evidence that during an outbreak 20% or more persons \nhave no symptoms and temperature screens are not helpful. This 20% may be responsible for \n44% of the transmission of the novel coronavirus. As Mr. Dean Williams, Director of the \nColorado Department of Corrections stated today in a new release:  “Given the insidious nature \nof this virus we had suspected that despite seeing a relatively low number of inmates with \nsymptoms, the number of positives was potentially much higher” \nIt is my opinion that when reviewing Weld County Jail data received April 24, it is unclear why despite \nhaving only 9 individuals in isolation with 8 COVID-19 positive tests, there are no inmates in quarantine.  \nSince Weld County Jail had 14 COVID-19 cases combining confirmed and probable cases only two weeks \nago, at  a time when some meaningful social distancing had only just begun, it is likely that if testing to \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 49-1   Filed 04/28/20   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 39\nconfirm evidence of infection is done, it may probably reveal many  asymptomatically infected inmates \npotentially spreading the infection. This scenario is what is currently seen at Sterling Prison in Colorado and \nin Ohio.   It is my opinion that without substantial testing of previously quarantined individuals and \nincreased single-celling, that the virus is likely to continue to spread in the jail, putting high risk inmates at a \nsubstantial risk of serious illness or death. \nAfter conducting these two inspections of the Weld County Jail, where I had the opportunity to \nspeak with inmates and staff and observed the dynamics of the different units, it is my opinion \nthat additional interventions are necessary to protect inmate, staff and ultimately community \nsafety.     Herein, is a summary of these recommendations: \n•  This unprecedented pandemic calls for unprecedented measures in every setting but \nparticularly in congregate settings.   \no  No one inside Weld County Jail or outside living in the larger community is safe \nuntil there is interruption of coronavirus transmission.  \n \n•  Implementing CDC protocols to mitigate Covid-19 transmission in Weld County \nJail is not sufficient unless social distancing is meaningfully implemented.   \no  Reducing the inmate population to allow for social distancing is the cornerstone \nof reducing the impact of this highly transmissible viral pathogen.  \no  Social distancing requires inmates maintaining a distance of at least six feet from \neach other, disinfection of key areas (telephones and toilets), mask use, and \nregular handwashing must be meticulously followed. These protocols are \nnecessary to prevent spread of COVID-19 among otherwise healthy people. \nHowever, these protocols are imperative for high-risk individuals.  Without these \nprotocols, high-risk individuals face a substantial risk of serios illness or death \nfrom the virus. \no  Reduction of population should occur to allow the maximum amount of social \ndistancing possible, with a guarantee of social distancing for high risk inmates, \ndiscussed further below. \n \n•  Prevention of exposure to the novel coronavirus  \no  Institute directives for all inmates in all units to use disinfectant and clean \ntelephones after each use.  \no  Institute directives for all inmates in all units to use disinfectant prior to the use \nand after using toilettes. \no  Enforce guidance on bed positions:  \n▪  For single beds positioned next to each other (side-to side): At least 6 feet \napart and inmate’s laying position is head to toe  \n▪  For bunkbeds that are positioned next to each other or across from one \nanother: Position beds at least 6 feet apart. Ensure the inmate’s laying \nposition is head to toe on each separate bunk bed, so positioning allows for \nthe least transmission risk as possible. This includes laying position that is \nhead to toe with adjacent bunks. \no  Enforce social distancing practices of all inmates in all units during med-line or \nmeal-line \no  Sick inmates should not be required to clean their own cell and no inmate should \nclean up after other inmates. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 49-1   Filed 04/28/20   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 39\no  Professional janitorial services should be brought in to disinfect the male medical \nisolation unit or any unit, which may become quarantined in the near future. \no  Professional janitorial services or trained staff should thoroughly clean each unit \nevery night. \n \n•  Inmates at high-risk of severe disease and dying from COVID-19 infection need to \nbe identified, and then either released or provided 24-7 social distancing. \no  Medically vulnerable inmates are at a substantial risk of contracting, spreading \nand becoming seriously ill or dying from COVID-19 in any carceral setting, \nparticularly in a place like Weld County Jail that is experiencing an outbreak.  To \nthe greatest extent possible, medically vulnerable inmates should be released. \no  To the extent that inmates at risk of severe disease or death cannot be released, \nmedically vulnerable individuals should be housed in single-person cells to \nmitigate the risk of serious illness or death to this population. For example, from \ntoday’s inspection, I would consider that Mr. Richard Barnum and Mr. Jesus \nMartinez should not be placed in a cell other 3 inmates.  Mr. Barnum has chronic \nkidney disease and chronic liver disease (see above table for medically vulnerable \npopulations).  Mr. Jesus Martinez has a history of asthma and hypertension, which \nplaces him at-risk of severe disease and should therefore be housed preferentially \nin a solo cell.   \no  During the intake, it is imperative to enhance efforts to identify inmates at high-\nrisk of COVID-19 complications to guide enforcement of social distancing \ninterventions such as placement in a single cell.   \no  All current inmates should be immediately screened to determine if they meet the \ncriteria for high risk noted in Table 1.   \n \n \n•  Personal Protective Equipment \no  There is a need to replace with more regularity disposable surgical masks that \ninmates are currently wearing. While there are no specific guidelines stating how \nlong a surgical mask should be replaced in carceral settings, I do recommend to \nexchange masks at least every third day but definitely no longer than five days \nsince it will lose its barrier function.  The initial set of masks were only replaced \napproximately 14 days after.  \no  The use of washable cloth masks may be an alternative and a cost-effective \nalternative.   \n \n•  Expanding testing capabilities for COVID-19 at Weld County Jail to ensure \ninterruption of transmission and to guide isolation and quarantine interventions.  \no  There is increasing evidence and recent publications to suggest that expanding \ntesting capabilities will improve isolation and quarantine strategies in congregate \nsettings. \no  Given the rapid spread of COVID-19 across the U.S. and the globe based on the \nclear evidence of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 transmission from \nasymptomatic persons broadened SARS-CoV-2 testing to include asymptomatic \npersons in prioritized settings such as jails.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 49-1   Filed 04/28/20   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 39\no  There is evidence from jails and prisons in other settings that despite having \nexcellent infection control practices, suggested social distancing interventions, \nkeeping the door open for new introductions may only flatten the epidemiologic \ncurve of cases.  However, it will not definitively halt the occurrence of new cases \nin settings where there is ongoing sustained community transmission as it has \noccurred in the larger community in Weld County. \no  As shown in custodial settings in Ohio, the rate of asymptomatic and symptomatic \ninfection in an enclosed jail environment could reach up to 70% (with more than \n20% asymptomatic infection).A similar ration of symptomatic to asymptomatic \nratio was identified and reported today at Sterling Prison in Colorado.  \no  Priorities for testing: \n▪  Test newly admitted for novel coronavirus infection even if asymptomatic \nto reduce the risk of new introductions into Weld County Jail. There is no \nother way to effective screen asymptomatic people at intake. \n▪  Any inmate at Weld County Jail with one or more symptoms consistent \nwith COVID-19 should undergo a clinical assessment including testing for \nthe presence of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharynx.   \n▪  All inmates recently released from Unit A should be tested. For those who \nare positive, any of their new cellmates should be tested. During an \noutbreak, testing asymptomatic exposed will reduce the chances of spread \nto other units. For example, there may be individuals that were transferred \nfrom Unit A where the outbreak may have initiated and who completed an \nappropriate quarantine period in the A unit. However, they may have \nasymptomatic infection despite having normal temperature and normal \nscreening for symptoms and now that they were transferred to unit B may \nactually be silent spreaders.  Within unit B, it his individual with \nasymptomatic infection is housed in a cell with an at-risk individual, this \npractice may cause this cellmate to become severely ill and in turn, \ndisseminate the infection to others. Those with severe symptoms have \nhigh concentrations of coronavirus in their respiratory secretions.     \n▪  Ideally, all Weld County inmates and staff should be tested, but \nprevalence testing is a reasonable alternative. \n  \no  Intake Unit. At intake, there is no way to protect high risk individuals from \npotential exposure other than a single-cell environment.   Under no circumstances \nshould high-risk individuals be placed in a cell with any other person prior to the \n14 day quarantine.   \n \n•  Adhering to CDC quarantine and isolation guidelines.  \no  A14-day quarantine should be used for: a) asymptomatic individuals exposed to a \ncase; and, b) new arrestees and bookings (unless specific testing for coronavirus is \nperformed as suggested above).   \no  Medical isolation practices should be implemented for those with symptoms \nconsistent with COVID-19 regardless of having any underlying comorbidity to \ndevelop severe disease.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 49-1   Filed 04/28/20   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 39\no  Inmate with a positive COVID-19 test should be placed in isolation (as should \npersons with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 pending test results).  Those \nwith a negative test should be placed in quarantine with close clinical monitoring \nand if indicated repeat testing.   \no  Transferring those exposed to a case may spread further this infection, if testing \nfor COVID-19 is not conducted among asymptomatic individuals, even if the \nquarantine period was completed according to guidelines.  Screening for \nsymptoms and temperature is insufficient to stop the spread of this highly \ntransmissible virus given the high risk of transmitting the infection by \nasymptomatic individuals.  \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the statements above are true and correct to the best of \nmy knowledge. \nDate: April 24, 2020 \n \n \n______________________________ \nCarlos Franco-Paredes, MD, MPH, DTMH (Gorgas) \nAssociate Professor of Medicine \n \n \n \nScientific References: \n1.

Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). Plaintiffs have \ndemonstrated that they are being held under unconstitutional conditions of confinement at \nthe Weld County Jail in violation of their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. See \nHelling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25 (1993). The conditions of confinement Plaintiffs are \ncurrently being held under are likely to cause them to suffer irreparable harm absent \ninterim injunctive relief. Prairie Band of Potawatomi Indians v. Pierce, 253 F.3d 1234, \n  1\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 49-2   Filed 04/28/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 4\n \n1250 (10th Cir. 2001). The balance of harms weighs in favor of granting interim \ninjunctive relief because Plaintiffs’ situation is life and death. Edmisten v. Werholtz, 287 \nF. App’x 728, 732-35 (10th Cir. 2008); see also Thakker, et al. v. Doll, et al., No. 20 C \n0480, Dkt. 47, at 24 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 31, 2020). Finally, the public interest favors stopping \nthe spread of COVID-19, Bent v. Barr, No. 19-cv-06123-DMR, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n62792, at *22-24 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 9, 2020) (collecting cases), and protecting Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional rights. Kikumura v. Hurley, 242 F.3d 950, 963 (10th Cir. 2001). \n  Accordingly, this Court issues the following injunctive relief requiring that \nDefendant: \n1.  Physically distance all inmates from one another and staff within the Weld County \nJail, which necessitates at least six feet of distance between individuals at all times; \n2.  Identify inmates at high-risk of severe disease and dying from COVID-19, in \naccordance with guidelines from the CDC and CDPHE, and physically distance these \nindividuals particularly (including, but not limited to, housing these individuals in \nsingle-cells);  \n3.  On a daily basis, thoroughly and professionally disinfect and sanitize the Weld \nCounty Jail;  \n4.  Provide hygiene supplies, including supplies to wash hands and disinfect common \nareas, to inmates at all times and free of charge and implement policies and \nprocedures requiring that common areas be disinfected between uses by inmates; \n5.  Provide adequate personal protection equipment, including but not limited to masks, \nto all staff members and inmates (and ensure that these materials are replaced at least \nevery third day); \n  2\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 49-2   Filed 04/28/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 4\n \n6.  Implement a testing procedure to identify inmates who are possibly carrying COVID-\n19, including testing to identify asymptomatic carriers and those with one or more \nsymptom of COVID-19; \n7.  Implement a quarantine and isolation procedure that is in line with CDC guidelines \nfor all individuals exposed to COVID-19 and new intakes to the Weld County Jail; \n8.  Take particularly heightened precautions with respect to food handling and delivery, \nsuch as ensuring that people who come into contact with food are not displaying any \npotential symptoms of COVID-19, have not recently been in contact with people \ndisplaying potential symptoms of COVID-19, and people who come into contact with \nfood wear appropriate personal protective equipment at all times when in contact with \nfood (including but not limited to appropriate masks and gloves); and \n9.  Provide accurate, up-to-date educational and informational materials regarding the \nstatus of how COVID-19 is affecting the facility, including the number of infected \ninmates and staff. \nFurther, this Court holds that, in accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(c), bond is \nwaived in this matter because the above-outlined interim relief is in the public interest. \nSee Davis v. Mineta, 302 F.3d 1104, 1126 (10th Cir. 2002). \n \nSO ORDERED, this ___ day of ________ 2020, at Denver, Colorado \n  \n  \n  \n                                                            \nUnited States District Judge \n \n \n  3",

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY \nPlaintiffs did not meet the applicable heightened standard for disfavored injunctive \nrelief when their Motion was filed and Plaintiffs’ ability to meet that standard has only \nweakened, and considerably so, due to the ongoing efforts of the Weld County Sheriff’s \nOffice  (“WCSO”)  to  keep  staff,  inmates,  and  the  community  safe.  The  Sheriff  has \npreviously provided this Court with a thorough discussion of the legal deficiencies in ECF \n1, see ECF 26, and the Sheriff directs the Court to that pleading for a full treatment of \nthose issues. Put simply, the WCSO has worked tirelessly to maintain inmate safety and \nPlaintiffs’ arguments are completely without merit. \nPlaintiffs are thus unable to satisfy the heightened burden necessary to attain a \npreliminary injunction. Plaintiffs’ Motion must be entirely denied. \nII.  FACTUAL DEVELOPMENTS SINCE APRIL 10, 2020 \nThe Supplemental Declaration of Captain Matthew Turner of the WCSO Detention \nDivision responsible for the Weld County Jail (“WCJ”) is filed with this Response. [See \nTurner Dec. , Exh. B].2 Cpt. Turner’s Declaration, along with its extensive attachments \ncomprising emails, protocols, and other documents substantiating its contents, further \nsupports the comprehensive and sustained effort the WCSO, initially outlined in the \nSheriff’s Declaration, see Exh. A to ECF 26, to address COVID-19 at the WCJ. \nSince April 10, 2020, the Sheriff and the WCSO have continually refined and \nreassessed the policies and protocols of the WCSO to address COVID-19. Cpt. Turner’s \n                                            \n2 Exh. A, Decl. of Sheriff Steven Reams, was attached to ECF 26. [See ECF 26-1 \nto 26-47.] For clarity, the Sheriff will continue that sequence of exhibits. \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 41   Filed 04/24/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 14\nDeclaration, and the myriad supporting documents, contain a more complete description \nof the steps taken, but in compliance with the Court’s order in ECF 39, the Sheriff \nsummarizes several factual developments since April 10, 2020: \n•  Masks were issued to all inmates on April 9, 2020. [Exh. B-1]. \n•  On April 13, 2020, the medical unit at the jail, managed by Turn Key Health \nClinic (“TKHC”), received COVID-19 test kits, which TKHC had requested on April 3, \n2020.  [See Exh. B-6; Declaration of Dustin Owens, ¶ 9(m), Exh. C]. \n \n•  State District Court Judge Thomas Quammen ordered the WCSO to provide \ninformation on the WCJ’s medical capabilities, to consider in connection with a COVID-\n19-positive inmate’s motion to reduce bond. [See Exh. B-6]. Dustin Owens, the WCJ \nHealth Services Administrator, employed by TKHC, provided a description of WCJ’s \nmedical capabilities. [See Exh. B-6]. That inmate remains in the WCJ. \n \n•  WCSO command staff has continued to stress the importance of making \ninmates maintain proper sanitation, including cleaning sinks, toilets, and common areas \nafter each use. [See Exh. B-5, B-9]. \n \n•  Two pregnant inmates were released, on April 14, 2020, based on advice \nfrom the Weld County Department of Public Health and Environment (“WCDPHE”) that \nCOVID-19 posed a risk to their fetuses. [See Exh. B, ¶ 21]. \n \n•  Inmates  in  isolation,  i.e.  inmates  suspected,  presumed,  or  confirmed \npositive for COVID-19, were tested for COVID-19 on April 14, 2020. [See Exh. B, ¶ 22]. \n \n•  On April 14, WCSO staff wrote “10 minutes of surface contact time” on every \nbottle of cleaning spray in the WCJ, on the advice of the WCDPHE. [See Exh. B-11]. \n \n•   On April 16, 2020, Colorado Supreme Court Chief Justice Nathan Coats \ncontinued a prior Chief Justice Directive barring all jury calls in Colorado state courts \nthrough June 1, 2020. [See Exh. B-15]. Similarly, on April 16, 2020, Chief Judge James \nHartmann, Jr. of the 19th Judicial District of Colorado, vacated all court dates through 8 \na.m. on June 1, 2020, excepting court dates necessary for public safety (including setting \nbonds), and certain court dates for in-custody criminal defendants. [See Exh. B-15]. \n \n•  On April 17, 2020, WCSO command staff created a video based on a \nCenters for Disease Control (“CDC”) video now played daily in each jail unit giving \nguidance on how to prevent COVID-19 spread to all WCJ inmates. [See Exh. B-16]. \n \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 41   Filed 04/24/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 14\n•  WCJ refused to accept someone who violated a work release sentence, \npursuant to a protocol requiring all other sentence options to be exhausted before the \nWCJ will accept convicts who violate alternative sentences, to reduce new arrivals in the \nWCJ. [See Exh. B-18]. \n \n•  District Judges have ordered furloughs of convicts sentenced to the WCJ, \nordering releases and returns to serve their remaining sentences later. [E.g., Exh. B-20].3 \n \n•  On April 20, 2020, Mr. Owens revised the criteria for moving patients out of \nisolation, per updated CDC guidance. [See Exh. B-21; Owens Dec., ¶ 9(r), Exh. C]. \n \n•  On April 23, 2020, the WCSO took multiple steps to combat COVID-19, \nincluding: \n \n  implementing an order of the Colorado Department of Public Health \no\nand Environment (“CDPHE”), by requiring all WCSO deputies, both in the WCJ \nand in all other capacities, to wear masks whenever they cannot socially distance, \nwear  gloves  when  appropriate,  and  maintain  a  six-foot  distance  from  others \nwhenever feasible [see Exh. B-26, B-28]; \n \n  issuing five masks to each deputy staffing the WCJ to allow rotating \no\nof masks daily and to permit the other masks four days to decontaminate per CDC \nguidance [see Exh. B-26, B-28]; \n \n  issuing all inmates new masks, and WCSO requested additional \no\nmasks so each inmate can have two [see Exh. B-29]; \n \n  asking Colorado Department of Corrections (“CDOC”) to transport \no\n27 inmates from the WCJ to CDOC, as the WCJ had completed the “DOC COVID-\n19 Screening Tool” for them [see Exh. B-29; see also Exh. B-14 (protocol)].4 \n \n \n \n                                            \n3  These judicial decisions are important because of the Sheriff’s lack of authority \nto modify any sentence or bond for anyone at the WCJ. [See ECF 26, at 21-23]. \n \n4  However, the CDOC has determined not to accept any inmates from any \nColorado jails including WCJ. [See Exh. B-14]. \n \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 41   Filed 04/24/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 14\nThe WCSO has also continually assessed how best to house inmates within the \nphysical limitations of the WCJ.5 Efforts to most safely house inmates include: \n•  Unit movements for “high risk inmates,” i.e., inmates a TKHC medical \nprofessional determined are at particularly high health risk from COVID-19, so these \ninmates can be housed in a cell by themselves to keep them as safe as possible. (Notably, \nthis list does not include any of the named Plaintiffs.) [See Exh. B-22, B-25]. \n \n•  The WCJ has continued to use its system, established before April 10, \n2020, of placing units on quarantine status after an inmate in the unit tests positive for \nCOVID-19; this quarantine remains for 14 days. After 14 days, the unit is sanitized and \nmoves to a modified general population unit, in which 9 inmates are allowed out of their \ncells at a time with one deputy, to adhere to the State’s 10-person limit on gatherings. \n[See Exh. B-23]. \n \n•  The WCJ continues to have an isolation unit housing inmates suspected, \npresumptive, or confirmed positive for COVID-19. [See id.]. \n \n•  As units come out of quarantine, the WCSO continues to assess how best \nto  house  inmates,  considering  inmate  health,  safety,  security,  and  other  necessary \nconsiderations. Multiple units have now gone through a full 14-day quarantine period with \nno inmates showing COVID-19 symptoms. [See generally Exh. B, Exh. B-1 to B-31]. \n \nFinally, TKHC continues to monitor guidance from the CDC, the World Health \nOrganization, the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, and state and local \ngovernments, agencies, and health departments, to implement recommendations and \nrequirements for the WCJ and other jails to remain in compliance with this guidance, as \n                                            \n5 In compliance with ECF 39, the Sheriff has attached as Exh. B-32 floor plans and \npod diagrams of the WCJ for WCJ’s three most common housing unit types. There are a \nlimited number of pod designs in the jail, each of which is used for multiple pods; the \ndifferent designs in Exh. B-32 are representative of these three types. Due to the obvious \nsecurity concerns from divulging this information publicly, the exhibits show generic pod \nlayouts and floor plans but do not identify particular pods, the overall floor plan or layout \nof the WCJ, or other sensitive information that could create a security risk. Moreover, the \nother WCJ types of housing units are nonstandard and, due to their unique layout and the \nsafety and security concerns which would result from their public disclosure, are unable \nto be provided to the Court apart from its in camera review. [see Exh. B at 12, ¶ 45(d).] \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 41   Filed 04/24/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 14\nmuch as practicable. [See Exh. C, Owens Decl., ¶¶ 9(q)-(r); Exh. D, Cooper Decl., ¶ 10]. \nAs these TKHC Declarations show, TKHC has put in place numerous procedures and \nprotocols—almost all of which were in place before this lawsuit was filed—to provide \ninmates with the appropriate level of health care at the WCJ. Moreover, if TKHC medical \nstaff determine they cannot provide level of care necessary to ensure the inmate’s health \nand safety in the WCJ they are transported to an outside facility. \nThe steps the WCSO has taken, and continues to take, in collaboration with TKHC, \npublic health officials, and other appropriate experts, show the WCSO has remained \nvigilant and proactive in protecting the health and safety of inmates and staff in the WCJ, \nand the community at large. \nIII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nAs the Sheriff has previously argued [ECF 26, at 5-8], Plaintiffs provide an incorrect \nstandard  for  a  preliminary  injunction.6  Plaintiffs  must  establish:  (1)  they  will  suffer \nirreparable injury unless the relief issues; (2) the threatened injury outweighs whatever \ndamages the relief might cause the Sheriff’s ability to operate the WCJ; (3) such injunctive \nrelief will not be adverse to the public interest; and (4) Plaintiffs have a substantial \nlikelihood of succeeding on the merits of their case. Schrier v. Univ. of Colo., 427 F.3d \n1253, 1258 (10th Cir. 2005). Injunctive relief is “extraordinary” and should not issue unless \n                                            \n6 This Court applies the same standard in ruling on a preliminary injunction as on \na temporary restraining order (“TRO”), so all the arguments in ECF 26 are equally \napplicable to this Response. See Tooele Cnty. v. United States, 820 F.3d 1183, 1187 \n(10th Cir. 2016) (footnote omitted) (citation omitted) (“[TROs] and preliminary injunctions \ndiffer in how long they can last. Temporary restraining orders can last no more than \nfourteen days; preliminary injunctions can last longer.”) \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 41   Filed 04/24/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 14\nthe right to relief is “clear and unequivocal.” Kikumura v. Hurley, 242 F.3d 950, 955 (10th \nCir. 2001). But here Plaintiffs must also meet the “heightened burden” for injunctive relief \nwhere the sought-after relief: (1) disturbs the status quo; (2) is mandatory instead of \nprohibitory; or (3) affords the movant substantially all the relief it may recover after a full \nmerits trial. SCFC ILC, Inc. v. VISA USA, Inc., 936 F.2d 1096, 1098-99 (10th Cir. 1991); \naccord O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 973, \n975 (10th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (“O Centro”), aff’d on other grounds sub nom., Gonzales \nv. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418 (2006); see also In \nre HomeAdvisor, Inc. Litig., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141984, at *11-14 (D. Colo. Aug. 20, \n2019) (Brimmer, C.J.) (discussing whether injunction disturbs status quo or is mandatory). \nPlaintiffs “must make a strong showing both with regard to the likelihood of success on \nthe merits and with regard to the balance of harms, and may not rely on our modified \nlikelihood-of-success-on-the-merits standard.” O Centro, 389 F.3d at 976. As set forth in \nECF 26, all three bases for this heightened burden apply here. See ECF 26, pp. 7-8. \nIn  addition  to  this  heightened  burden,  Plaintiffs  must,  but  cannot,  meet  the \nadditional  limitations  and  requirements  of  the  Prison  Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995 \n(“PLRA”)  applicable  to  injunctive  relief here.  [See  ECF  26, at 9-14].  Moreover,  the \nimportant legal principles previously articulated by the Sheriff continue to apply. Namely, \nthis Court must show appropriate deference to the expertise and judgment of jail officials. \n[ECF 26, at 14-16]. Plaintiffs have misinterpreted applicable conditions of confinement \nlaw.  [ECF 26, at 16-18]. Both this Court and the Sheriff lack the authority to modify state \ncourt sentences and bonds. [ECF 26, at 18-22]. Plaintiffs are required to establish a \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 41   Filed 04/24/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 14\ncustom, policy, or practice of the Sheriff violated their constitutional rights, including \nmeeting the applicable causation and state of mind requirements, under Monell v. Dep’t \nof Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978). [ECF 26, at 23-26]. And any purported violation \nof CDC guidelines is not the equivalent of a constitutional violation. [ECF 26, at 27-28]. \nIV.  ARGUMENT \nPlaintiffs have not satisfied and cannot satisfy any of the four elements necessary \nto grant a preliminary injunction. Importantly, the Court must assess Plaintiffs’ claimed \nentitlement to a preliminary injunction in light of the state of the facts as of April 28, 2020, \nnot as of April 7, 2020. This Court should deny Plaintiffs’ Motion and deny the requested \npreliminary injunction as a matter of law. \n1.  Plaintiffs have no likelihood of success on the merits whatsoever. \nPlaintiffs have entirely failed to address how they succeed on a claim of municipal \nliability, Plaintiffs’ only claim. [ECF 26, at 23-27 (providing the requirements for a Plaintiff \nto prove a claim pursuant to Monell, 436 U.S. 658); id. at 32-33 (discussing Plaintiffs’ \ncomplete failure to argue municipal liability in ECF 1)]; see also Waller v. City & Cnty. of \nDenver, 932 F.3d 1277 (10th Cir. 2019) (analyzing at length the Tenth Circuit municipal \nliability standard). But Plaintiffs cannot even reach this issue, as they have no likelihood \nof success on the merits of an underlying Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment claim for \ndeliberate indifference to jail conditions. [ECF 26, at 16-18 (single applicable standard for \nEighth and Fourteenth Amendment jail conditions claims); id. at 29-32 (outlining many of \nproactive steps taken well before or on April 10, 2020, to combat COVID-19 in the WCJ \nand explaining these steps prove Sheriff and WCSO were not deliberately indifferent)].  \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 41   Filed 04/24/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 14\nIn light of the additional steps the Sheriff and the WCSO have taken since April 10, \n2020, as outlined above and in the attachments to this Response, Plaintiffs now have \neven less of a prospect of success on the merits. The WCSO continues to proactively \nprotect inmate health and safety and has made well more than the “reasonable efforts” \nnecessary to defeat a jail conditions claim. See Despain v. Uphoff, 264 F.3d 965, 975 \n(10th Cir. 2001) (“If an official is aware of the potential for harm but takes reasonable \nefforts to avoid or alleviate that harm, he bears no liability under this standard.”). \nThis conclusion is borne out by the reducing numbers of inmates in isolation and \n“suspected positive” for COVID-19 in the WCJ. Data compiled by the Sheriff—and sent \ndaily to Plaintiffs’ counsel—in compliance with the Court’s Order Granting In Part and \nDenying in Part Plaintiffs’ requested expedited discovery, [ECF 36] shows on April 11, \n2020, 14 inmates were in isolation in the WCJ, 6 tested positive for COVID-19 as \ndiagnosed by a health care professional, and 9 were designated “suspected positive” by \na health care professional. After hovering around similar numbers for several days, as of \nApril 23, 2020, 9 inmates were in isolation in the WCJ, 8 tested positive for COVID-19 as \ndiagnosed by a health care professional, and 1 was designated “suspected positive” by \na health care professional.7 While there has been a slight increase in the number of \npositive cases, this is an understandable consequence of tests confirming some of the \nmedical professionals’ suspected diagnoses. The far more important data point is the \nnumber of “suspected positive” cases which dropped dramatically, from 9 to only 1. Fewer \n                                            \n7 Plaintiffs’ counsel possess this data as it was transmitted to them on April 23, \n2020, and the email transmission can be provided to the Court upon its request. \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 41   Filed 04/24/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 14\nsuspected positive inmates will by definition lead to fewer future confirmed positive \ninmates. Simply, the Sheriff’s and WCSO’s efforts to reduce COVID-19 transmission in \nWCJ have proved successful. \nSimilarly, several WCJ units which went on 14-day quarantines after having an \ninmate confirmed positive for COVID-19 have either now completed the 14-day period or \nare close to doing so. [See generally Exh. B, Exh. B-1 to B-31].8 \nFinally,  as  of  April  24,  2020,  only  two  of  the  Plaintiffs  for  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment claim remain in WCJ custody, and neither Plaintiff for the Eighth Amendment \nclaim remains in custody. Longstanding Tenth Circuit precedent this Court must follow \ndictates the released Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief (the only type of relief sought in \nECF 1) are moot. E.g., Green v. Branson, 108 F.3d 1296, 1300 (10th Cir. 1997). And \neven were this Court to consider the interests of the putative class to avoid a mootness \ndetermination, Plaintiffs’ injunctive relief claim still fails on its merits. \nPlaintiffs have no likelihood of success on the merits and certainly cannot make \nthe “strong showing” required for this Court to grant disfavored injunctive relief. But even \nif Plaintiffs had some minimal likelihood of proving their claims, they have neither argued \nnor have any likelihood of success on their municipal liability claims which, it bears \nrepeating, are the only types of claims they advance in this litigation. See generally \nMonell, 436 U.S. 658, and its progeny, including Waller, 932 F.3d 1277. \n                                            \n8 In this context, the Sheriff notes it cannot be the constitutional standard for the \nSheriff to have to prevent all inmates from getting COVID-19 in the WCJ or any spread \nof the disease in the WCJ population. A comparison of the Sheriff’s efforts to the ongoing \npublic spread of COVID-19 in various locations publicly reported demonstrates the overall \nefficacy of the WCJ’s efforts. [See Exh. E, Greeley Tribune Story about JBS]. \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 41   Filed 04/24/20   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 14\n2.  Decreasing numbers of COVID-19 cases in the WCJ show Plaintiffs do not face \nirreparable harm \n \nThe Sheriff acknowledges falling ill with COVID-19 poses real and serious health \nrisks to many people worldwide, including Plaintiffs. To the Sheriff’s knowledge, however, \nnone of the Plaintiffs is sick with COVID-19. Further, contrary to Plaintiffs’ claim they face \nuniquely high health risks from their co-morbidities, none of them were included in the list \nof inmates WCJ medical staff identified as high risk for dangers from COVID-19. [See \ngenerally Exh. B-22, B-25]. And those Plaintiffs no longer in the WCJ face no risk of \ncontracting COVID-19 from the WCJ, let alone irreparable harm from such a risk. Further, \nas the objective medical data outlined above shows, the WCJ has successfully reduced \nthe risk of inmates contracting COVID-19. Considering the heightened showing needed \nfor  this  disfavored  injunctive  relief,  Plaintiffs  cannot  demonstrate  the  current  WCJ \nconditions create any greater risk of irreparable harm than exists in Colorado generally.  \n3.  The threatened injury does not outweigh potential harm to WCJ and WCSO. \nAs previously argued [ECF 26, at 33-35], Plaintiffs entirely fail to acknowledge the \nmany identifiable harms to the WCJ from Plaintiffs’ requested injunctive relief. These \nmultiple  potential  harms  weigh  even  more  heavily  against  a  preliminary  injunction. \nExpenses  to  taxpayers  could  be  nearly  uncapped;  the  Court  would  be  required  to \nintervene  in  the  minutiae  of  jail  management  continuously  to  address  changing \ncircumstances and updated public health recommendations; and the Sheriff’s legal right \nto maintain control over the WCJ would be severely compromised, to list just a few \npotential harms. Plaintiffs cannot make the “strong showing” required for the Court to \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 41   Filed 04/24/20   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 14\ngrant this disfavored injunctive relief. The Court must conclude Plaintiffs have not met \ntheir burden on this “balance of harms” factor. \n4.  Plaintiffs’ requested injunctive relief would be adverse to the public interest \nbecause it unreasonably threatens public safety. \n \nThe PLRA requires this Court “give substantial weight to any adverse impact on \npublic safety” in considering injunctive relief that would release prisoners. 18 U.S.C. § \n3626(a)(2); [ECF 26 at 9-14]. Plaintiffs disregarded this requirement and do not discuss \npublic safety or acknowledge public safety risks at any point. As the floor plans and pod \ndiagrams in Exh. B-32 show, it is neither possible nor advisable for the WCSO to patrol \nthe WCJ to ensure all inmates are at least six feet from all other people at all times. \nPlaintiffs ask, in the alternative, this Court order prisoners released from the WCJ. [ECF \n1, at 7]. Beyond the multiple legal impediments to such an order [ECF 26, at 9-14, 18-23], \nreleasing inmates would create an unjustifiable public safety risk. Decisions about the \ntotal number of inmates remaining in the WCJ are therefore better left to the state judges \nwho have been carefully examining inmates’ requests for release. [See Exh. B-6, B-20]. \nThis Court should be mindful of comity and federalism in this context. \n5.  If the Court orders injunctive relief, significant security should be required. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 65(c) allows the Court to order a security as a condition of any \ninjunctive relief “to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been \nwrongfully enjoined or restrained.” The Sheriff asserts any preliminary injunction is likely \nto cause the taxpayers of Weld County to bear significant costs. Thus, to compensate \nthose taxpayers for what could be months of potentially improvident relief, the Court \nshould order posting of a security interest of at least $1,000,000, which is less than two \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 41   Filed 04/24/20   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 14\nweeks’ cost of running the WCJ. [ECF 26 at 39 n. 13]. The basis for a security is further \nelaborated in the Sheriff’s prior submission. [ECF 26 at 39-40]. \nV.  CONCLUSION \nIn conclusion, for the foregoing reasons, as well as based on all the previously \narticulated arguments, authorities, and evidence in ECF 26, Defendant Sheriff Steven \nReams, the elected Sheriff for  the  County  of Weld,  State  of  Colorado,  respectfully \nrequests  this  Court  enter  an  Order:  denying  Plaintiffs’  application  for  a  preliminary \ninjunction in this matter; and granting all other relief deemed just and proper. \nRespectfully submitted this 24th day of April, 2020. \ns/ Matthew J.

Defendant Reams opposes this Motion.  \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs  have  moved  for  interim  relief  to  prevent  catastrophic  harm  to  medically \nvulnerable individuals incarcerated in the Weld County Jail as a result of the Weld County Jail’s \nfailure to take adequate preventative measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic.  Pursuant to \nF.R.C.P. 23(b)(2), this motion seeks certification of a class of incarcerated persons who are in \ndesperate need of that interim relief before they suffer substantial – and potentially fatal – harm.  \nAs described in detail in Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary \nInjunction and Expedited Hearing, people over the age of fifty-five, as well as those with certain \nunderlying conditions, face far greater chances of serious illness or death from COVID-19. The \noverwhelming consensus of public health authorities and experts is that incarcerated individuals \nare particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 because of the close spaces in which individuals are \nconfined, the shared use of facilities with lack of adequate hygiene, and facilities such as the Weld \nCounty Jail lacking the medical care infrastructure necessary to address the spread of COVID-19 \nor to treat high-risk individuals in its custody. As a result, experts have warned that “widespread \ncommunity transmission of COVID-19 within a correctional institution is likely to result in a \ndisproportionately high COVID-19 mortality rate.”2  While several counties in Colorado have \nundertaken measures to reduce their jail populations in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19, \nWeld County has thus far refused to take meaningful action to address the risks posed by COVID-\n \n2 “COVID-19 in Correctional Settings: Unique Challenges and Proposed Responses” (March 23, \n2020),  https://amend.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID-in-Corrections-Challenges-and-\nSolutions1.pdf;  see  also  “Correctional  Facilities  In  The  Shadow  Of  COVID-19:  Unique \nChallenges  And  Proposed  Solutions,”  Health  Affairs  Blog,  March  26,  2020,  available  at \nhttps://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200324.784502/full/ (last visited Apr. 3, 2020). \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 2   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 13\n19  and  has  failed  to  implement  adequate,  system-wide  measures  to  protect  incarcerated \nindividuals. This puts the Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent in mortal jeopardy, and \nalso endangers the larger community in light of the daily movement of both prisoners and staff in \nand out of the Weld County Jail. \n  Plaintiffs seek certification of the following class of individuals: \nAll current and future persons held at the Weld County Jail who are at high risk of \ncomplications from COVID-19 because:   \n(a) they are age 55 or older; or  \n(b) they have the following chronic health conditions:  cancer; autoimmune \ndisease (including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Sjogren’s, Crohn’s); \nchronic lung disease (including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, \nbronchiectasis,  idiopathic  pulmonary  fibrosis  or  other  chronic  conditions \nassociated with impaired lung function); history of cardiovascular disease; \nchronic arthritis; chronic liver or kidney disease; diabetes;  hypertension; heart \nfailure; HIV; on chronic steroids or other immunosuppressant medications for \nchronic conditions;  \n(c) they have history of smoking or other substance abuse disorders; or \n(d) they are pregnant.  \n  This class easily satisfies the requirements of Rule 23. Indeed, the record evidence, along \nwith Weld County Jail’s own policies and practices, demonstrate common COVID-19 policy and \nplanning failures that impact hundreds of members of the proposed class in exactly the same way \n– all are at risk of serious illness or death due to Weld County Jail’s lack of preventative measures.  \nSee Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary Injunction and Expedited \nHearing at p.12-25.  To address these common failures, the Court need not make any determination \nregarding the individual circumstances of any class member; rather, it must determine whether the \nWeld County Jail’s actions (or inactions) are of sufficient severity to warrant interim relief. Class \ncertification is therefore the most appropriate vehicle for the Court to remediate these systemic \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 2   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 13\ndefects that subject Plaintiffs and the class to a substantial – and intolerable – risk of serious harm \nif left unaddressed.  \nII.  THE PROPOSED CLASS REPRESENTATIVES \n  The seven proposed class representatives all fall within the high risk populations who are \nparticularly vulnerable to COVID-19 and particularly likely to suffer severe illness, life-altering \ncomplications, or death as a result of exposure to the virus.   \n  The proposed class representatives are  (1) Thomas Carranza, who is 55 years old,  suffers \nfrom asthma, high blood pressure and an undiagnosed intestinal condition, and has previously been \nhospitalized for acute asthmatic bronchitis; (2) Jesus Martinez, who is 33 years old, overweight, \nand suffers from multiple chronic medical conditions including diabetes, asthma, shortness of \nbreath, and high blood pressure; (3) Richard Barnum, who is 54 years old, previously suffered \nkidney failure, and currently has Hepatitis C, stage two kidney disease, and high blood pressure; \n(4) Thomas Lew, is who is 60 years old and suffers from vitiligo, an immune deficiency disease; \n(5) Michael Ward, who is 31 years old and suffers from high blood pressure and arthritis; (6) Colby \nPropes, who is 44 years old and has a history of smoking as well as diagnosed substance abuse \ndisorders.; and (7) Chad Hunter, who is 46 years old, has a history of smoking and a substance \nabuse disorder, and is hypoglycemic. \nAll seven of the proposed class representatives are currently imprisoned at the Weld County \nJail  and  their  experiences  with  the  Weld  County  Jail’s  policy  response  to  COVID-19  are \nremarkably similar.  None has been provided masks, none has been afforded the benefit of sanitary \nsupplies needed to prevent spread of the disease; none has been given access to food prepared in a \nhygienic manner consistent with preventing the spread of COVID-19; none has been provided use \nof lavatory facilities and other common spaces that are maintained with the needed hygiene to \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 2   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 13\nprevent the spread of COVID-19; and none has been afforded the required six-foot radius to ensure \nproper physical distancing. Thus, similar to members of the proposed class, each of the proposed \nClass Representatives remains at high risk of serious illness, complications, and death due to the \nlack of adequate system-wide preventative measures at the Weld County Jail.  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CLASS COMPLIES WITH RULE 23 \n  Class certification is proper under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) if: (1) the class is \nso numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact \ncommon to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the \nclaims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of the class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).   \n  In addition, the proposed class must be certifiable under one of the three sub-provisions of \nRule 23(b). Here, Plaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(2), because the party opposing the \nclass has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making \nappropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a \nwhole.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) \nA.  The proposed class complies with Rule 23(a) \ni.  The proposed class is so numerous that joinder would be impracticable.  \nA class must be sufficiently numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  The impracticability of the joinder requirement does not require that joinder \nis impossible, but only that the plaintiffs “will suffer a strong litigational hardship or inconvenience \nif joinder is required.”  Cook v. Rockwell Intern. Corp., 151 F.R.D. 378, 384 (D. Colo. 1993).  “In \ndetermining whether a proposed class meets the numerosity requirement, ‘the exact number of \npotential members need not be shown, ‘and a court ‘may make common sense assumptions to \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 2   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 13\nsupport a finding that joinder would be impracticable.’” In re Thornburh Mortgage, Inc. Sec. Litig., \n812 F. Supp. 2d 1178, 1221 (D. N. M. 2012) (internal quotation omitted).  \nThe proposed class easily satisfies the numerosity requirement.  Weld County Jail has a \ncurrent population of approximately 575 inmates and is the sixth most populous jail in Colorado.  \nAlthough the exact number of people at the Weld County Jail who fall within the high risk \npopulations groups is unknown, that number can be reasonably approximated.  Based on recent \njail rosters, approximately 44 of Weld County Jail’s current inmates are over age 55 and older. \nAdditionally, approximately 35 percent of Colorado’s prison population have moderate to severe \nmedical issues.3  Even assuming significant overlap between these two population groups, upwards \nof 150 individuals fall within the proposed Class.  Given these numbers, joinder is impracticable \nand numerosity is satisfied.  See Helmer v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 2014 WL 1133299 at *3 \n(D. Colo. Mar. 21, 2014). (finding numerosity was met where class consisted of 132 members).  \nJoinder is also impracticable here due to the population at issue and the extraordinary \ncurrent circumstances. The members of the class include both individuals currently incarcerated \nand those individuals who may be incarcerated in the coming weeks and months as COVID-19 \ncontinues to spread.  Because the class includes individuals who will suffer the same injury in the \nfuture, traditional joinder is particularly difficult.  See Newberg on Class Actions § 25:4 (4th ed. \n2016) (“Even a small class of fewer than 10 actual members may be upheld if an indeterminate \nnumber of individuals are likely to become class members in the future or if the identity or location \nof many class members is unknown for good cause.”); Jack v. Am. Linen Supply Co., 498 F.2d \n \n3  Departmental  Reports  and  Statistics,  Colorado  Department  of \nCorrections, www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdoc/departmental-reports-and-statistics;  Statistical  Report  FY \n2018,  Colorado  Department  of  Corrections,  drive.google.com/file/d/1Sbiu6bl7NVZ7BL-\nij3u_TyrmbUOAoWKS/view. \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 2   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 13\n122, 124 (5th Cir. 1974) (finding numerosity requirement satisfied when class included “unknown, \nunnamed  future”  class  members  rendering  joinder  “certainly  impracticable”).  Moreover, \nincarcerated individuals at Weld County Jail are, by definition, held in custody with limited access \nto information at the best of times.  Under the extreme and unique circumstances of COVID-19, \nthese individuals are also currently unable to meet with anyone outside the facility except for \nattorneys in very narrow situations and are limited in their ability to bring individual lawsuits due \nto court closures in Weld County and throughout Colorado more generally.  \nii.  The proposed class representatives present issues of fact and law in \ncommon with the class. \n  \nTo satisfy commonality, the “[p]laintiff must allege a ‘common contention of such a nature \nthat it is capable of class-wide resolution – which means that determination of its truth or falsity \nwill resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.’” Wal-\nMart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011).  “What matters to class certification . . . is \nnot the raising of common ‘questions’ – even in droves – but rather, the capacity of a class-wide \nproceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.”  Id. (internal \nquotation omitted).  For the purposes of commonality, “even a single common question will do.”  \nId.  at 359. Courts have repeatedly found commonality is met where the class’s claims arise from \na uniform course of conduct on the part of the defendant.  See Kerns v. Spectralink Corp., 2013 \nWL 27380785 at *2 (D. Colo. July 1, 2003).  And in civil rights lawsuits challenging conditions \nof  detention,  commonality  is  satisfied  where  the  lawsuit  challenges  “systemic  policies  and \npractices that allegedly expose inmates to a substantial risk of harm,” even where there are \n“individual factual differences among class members.”  Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 681-681 \n(9th Cir. 2014) (collecting cases across the country).  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 2   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 13\nIn this case, there are multiple common questions of law and fact pertaining to the Weld \nCounty Jail’s policies and practices regarding COVID-19.  These include questions of whether the \nWeld County Jail’s course of conduct has exposed the class to harm and/or a substantial risk of \nharm due to its deliberate indifference to the risks of COVID-19, and whether the Weld County \njail has failed to take appropriate preventative measures on a system-wide basis. All members of \nthe class are subject to the same action (or inaction) by the Weld County Jail, and all have a right \nto receive adequate COVID-19 prevention, testing and treatment.  Because proper preventative \nmeasures have not been taken, all members of the class face potential imminent harm and are \nvulnerable to severe illness or death if exposed to COVID-19.  \niii.  The proposed class representatives’ claims are typical of those of the \nclass.  \n \nRule 23(a)(3) requires that the putative class representatives’ claims are typical of those of \nthe class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  “A named plaintiff’s claim is ‘typical’ when it arises out of the \nsame event, practice or course of conduct of the defendant, and is based on the same legal theory \non which the class claims are predicated.”  Murphy v. Lenderlive Network, Inc., 2014 WL 5396165 \nat *4 (D. Colo. Oct. 22, 2014).  “Provided the claims of the Named Plaintiffs and class members \nare based on the same legal or remedial theory, differing fact situations of the class members do \nnot defeat typicality.”  DG ex rel. Stricklin v. Devaugh, 594 F.3d 1188, 1198-99 (10th Cir. 2010).  \nFor the same reason that there are overwhelmingly common issues of fact and law, the Plaintiffs’ \nclaims are typical of the class.  See Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 349 n.5 (“The commonality and \ntypicality requirements of Rule 23(a) tend to merge.”).  \n  Here, the named Plaintiffs have the same claims and face the same harms as members of \nthe proposed class.  Named Plaintiffs, similar to members of the class, all fall within the high risk \npopulation that places them in danger of severe illness or death if they are exposed to COVID-19.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 2   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 13\nAll challenge Weld County Jail’s failure to take adequate preventative measures – a failure that \nplaces them in substantial risk of serious harm. Named Plaintiffs’ claims are therefore sufficiently \ncoextensive with those of the class to satisfy typicality.  \niv.  The proposed class representatives and class counsel can adequately \nrepresent the case. \n \nRule 23(a)(4) requires that “the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  The adequacy requirement ensures that there are \nno potential “conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek to represent.”  \nAmchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 625 (1997).  “Resolution of two questions \ndetermines legal adequacy: (1) do the named plaintiffs and their counsel have any conflicts of \ninterest with other class members, and (2) with the named plaintiffs and their counsel prosecute \nthe action vigorously on behalf of the class?”  Rutter & Wilbanks Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., 314 F. 3d \n1180, 1187-88 (10th Cir. 2002) (internal citation omitted).  Adequate representation is usually \npresumed absent contrary evidence.  See 1 Newberg on Class Actions § 3:72 (5th Ed. 2019).   \n  First, there is no conflict between the named Plaintiffs and the members of the class. As \ndescribed above, the named Plaintiffs and class members have the same injury and seek the same \nrelief.    Likewise,  Plaintiff’s  counsel,  consisting  of  Hutchinson,  Black  and  Cook,  LLC  in \ncooperation with the ACLU of Colorado and Kilmer, Lane & Newman, LLP, are well-qualified \nand highly experienced in class action and civil rights matters, and have done extensive work \ninvestigating this action.  Counsel are exceptionally well versed in class actions and constitutional \nlaw, with decades of experience litigating such cases, and have sufficient resources to vigorously \nprosecute this case.  \nB.  The proposed class is appropriate under Rule 23(b)(2) \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 2   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 13\nCertification under Rule 23(b0(2) is appropriate where, as here, defendants “acted or \nrefused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class. . . ..” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  A court \nmay certify a Rule 23(b)(2) class where “a single injunction or declaratory judgment would \nprovide relief to each member of the class.”  Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830, 851-52 (2018) \n(internal citation and quotation omitted).  \n  The claims raised and the relief sought by Plaintiffs in this action are precisely the sort that \nRule 23(b)(2) was designed to facilitate: “[c]ivil rights cases against parties charged with unlawful, \nclass based discrimination are prime examples,” of proper (b)(2) actions.  Amchem Prods., 521 \nU.S. at 614.    In their motion for an interim injunction, Plaintiffs seek a Court order implementing \na single, system wide process to rectify the violation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights and protect \nthem from the threat of COVID-19 exposure, including: \n(1) Physically distancing all inmates from one another and staff within the Weld County \nJail, which necessitates at least six feed of distances between individuals at all times;  \n(2) Thoroughly and professionally disinfecting and sanitizing the Weld County Jail on a \ndaily basis;   \n(3) Providing hygiene supplies, including supplies to wash hands and disinfect common \nareas, to inmates at all times and free of charge; \n(4) Providing personal protective equipment including, but not limited to masks, to all staff \nmembers and inmates;  \n(5) Taking particularly heightened precautions with respect to food handling and delivery, \nsuch as ensuring that people who come into contact with food are not displaying any \npotential symptoms of COVID-19, have not recently been in contact with people \ndisplaying potential symptoms of COVID-19, and wear appropriate personal protection \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 2   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 13\nat all times when in contact with food (including but not limited to appropriate masks \nand gloves); \n(6) Implementing appropriate policies and protocols to identify inmates who are possibly \ncarrying COVID-19 and quarantine those inmates from other individuals; and \n(7) Providing  accurate  up-to-date  educational  and  informational  materials  regarding \nsanitation and prevention of COVID-19, the status of how COVID-19 is affecting the \nfacility including the number of infected inmates and staff, and daily access to news \nreports regarding COVID-19.  \n  This system-wide, process-based relief is exactly the type of single injunction that would \nbenefit all members of the proposed class – and falls squarely within the purview of Rule 23(b)(2) \nas a result.   \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n  Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court grant class certification, at a minimum on a \nprovisional basis, contemporaneously with providing interim relief pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65 \nas set forth in Plaintiffs’ motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.   \nDated: April 7, 2020        \n          Respectfully submitted, \n \ns/ Andy McNulty       \nAndy McNulty  \nMichael P.

The scope of what makes an inmate medically vulnerable shall be updated \nto conform with current CDC guidance in the event the CDC modifies the aforesaid \nguidelines, which update shall be self-executing upon counsel for Defendant providing \ncounsel for Plaintiffs and members of the Class either (a) an official order from the CDC \nwhich would be self-authenticating pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 902(1), or (b) an equivalent \nofficial publication from the CDC’s website which otherwise would be self-authenticating \npursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 902(5).

The descriptions for screening questions must, at a minimum, mirror the level of \nspecificity in the definition of “medically vulnerable” set forth above, and must be given \nin Spanish for persons who indicate a preference for conditions to be listed in Spanish. \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 110   Filed 02/16/21   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 17\nThe descriptions must also provide a list of the most common conditions that meet the \ndefinitions of “immunocompromised,” and “liver disease.”  Self-reported conditions are \nto be accepted as true unless and until there is definitive medical evidence to the \ncontrary.  Until the process of determining whether inmates in intake have one or more \nof the aforesaid conditions which would cause them to be designated as medically \nvulnerable is completed, inmates should not be exposed to other inmates and should be \nexposed only to the smallest number of WCJ staff as possible.   \n(2) Take actions to keep the WCJ population as low as possible, while protecting \npublic safety, so as to maximize the number of medically vulnerable inmates who can \nbe housed in a single-cell, which shall consist of the following: \na.  Maintain the “Emergency Arrest Standards Due To COVID-19/Jail \nConstruction” included in ECF 85-2 filed with the Court in this Lawsuit \nuntil either the COVID-19 Emergency End Date or the date the WCJ \nhousing unit closed for construction as indicated to the Court in ECF \n85-2 is reopened, whichever is sooner. \nb.  Upon said housing unit being reopened, if sooner, subsequently \nmaintain “Modification to Arrest Standards Due To COVID-19” \nattached hereto as Exhibit A-1, until the COVID-19 Emergency End \nDate.1 \nP0F\nc.  Retain the right no longer than the COVID-19 Emergency End Date, in \nDefendant’s sole discretion, to reinstitute the “Emergency Arrest \n \n1 With respect to the offenses identified in Paragraph 4 under the heading “The \nWeld County Jail Will Accept” in Exhibit A-1, for anyone booked into the WCJ in the \nnarrow additional categories specified in said Paragraph 4, Defendant will give notice to \nthe Weld County Attorney, who will in turn notify counsel for the Class. \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 110   Filed 02/16/21   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 17\nStandards Due To COVID-19/Jail Construction” included in ECF 85-2 \nfiled with the Court in this Lawsuit, or substantially similar arrest \nstandards if appropriate based on WCJ inmate population, per capita \nwhen considering all housing units then open and the housing units’ \nthen-current uses, increasing to a same or similar percentage level \nwhich motivated the filing of ECF 85-2 with the Court in this Lawsuit. If \nDefendant needs to reinstitute such Arrest Standards, Defendant by \nand through his counsel shall, contemporaneously with such \nreinstitution, notify Mark Silverstein at msilverstein@aclu-co.org and \nNicole Loy at nloy@aclu-co.org. \nd.  Disseminate regular advisements to the Weld Chiefs of Police to be \njudicious about minimizing the scope of arrestees in their jurisdictions \nand maximizing the scope of persons who are issued a summons or \ngiven a bond upon personal recognizance in their jurisdictions. \ne.   At least one time every fourteen days: \ni.  Provide a list of all inmates currently housed in the WCJ to the \nChief Judge of the District Court for Colorado’s 19th Judicial \nDistrict with a copy to Mark Silverstein at msilverstein@aclu-\nco.org and Nicole Loy at nloy@aclu-co.org, requesting a docket \nreview for potential judicial action;  \nii.

Provide Mark Silverstein at msilverstein@aclu-co.org and \nnloy@aclu-co.org with an identification of which inmates in the \nWCJ are classified as “medically vulnerable” pursuant to this \nConsent Decree, for a lookback period of the prior fourteen days \ndefined as the two-weeks-previous Monday at 05:00:00 AM \nthrough the previous Sunday at 05:00:01 AM, thus resulting in \nfourteen (14) days of reported data, at 05:00:00 AM each day of \nsaid lookback period. Mr. Silverstein, for himself and on behalf \nof all counsel who entered an appearance for Plaintiffs or the \nClass or both in the Lawsuit, agrees such identification shall be \nused only by counsel acting on behalf of Plaintiffs or members \nof the Class and shall be used only for class counsel purposes. \nf.  With respect to each WCJ inmate classified as “medically vulnerable” \nas set forth herein and who is currently in WCJ general population or in \nthe intake/transition units, or who may subsequently booked into the \nWCJ through and including the COVID-19 Emergency End Date, \npromptly furnish to each such inmate a written notification that such \ninmate has been classified as “medically vulnerable” and is at a higher \nrisk for experiencing adverse health consequences from contracting \nCOVID-19, if contracted, based on the intake screening of such \ninmate. This form will contain such inmate’s name and date of birth, \nthe date such inmate’s intake screening was conducted, and the initials \nand/or signature of the medical professional who conducted it. An \nexemplar of this form is attached hereto as Exhibit A-2. \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 110   Filed 02/16/21   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 17\ng.  If necessary to maintain low jail population within the WCJ, utilize \nstatutory authority contained in C.R.S. § 17-26-109 to grant time \ncredits to sentenced prisoners. \n(3) Ensure the following respecting intake/transition units within the WCJ: \nmedically vulnerable inmates admitted to WCJ’s intake/transition units are housed in a \ncell within such unit alone and away from other inmates; if it is not possible to house a \nmedically vulnerable inmate alone in a cell within an intake/transition unit due to the \nWCJ’s physical layout, population level, and classification needs, the inmate must be \nhoused in a cell within an intake/transition unit with no more than one other inmate, \nwhich inmate must also be a medically vulnerable inmate, in accordance with cohorting \npractices the Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) specifically outlines and endorses; \nand if despite this allowance, it still is not possible to house a medically vulnerable \ninmate either alone or with only one other medically vulnerable inmate in a cell within an \nintake/transition unit due to the WCJ’s then-existing physical layout, population level, \nand classification needs, and no other option is apparent, Detentions Division Deputies \nwill contact their Shift Sergeant for guidance immediately, and this existing policy will be \nmaintained subject to the WCSO’s maximum staffing ability. \n(4) Ensure the following for all inmates:  Continue the WCSO’s existing policy of \nensuring,  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  considering  the  WCJ’s  physical  layout, \npopulation level, and classification needs, the following respecting general population \nunits within the WCJ: medically vulnerable inmates are treated as a Special Management \npopulation in the WCJ; upon completing the intake/ transition unit quarantine protocol and \ntransferring to WCJ general population, a medically vulnerable inmate is not housed in a \ncell with an inmate who is not medically vulnerable and an inmate who is not medically \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 110   Filed 02/16/21   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 17\nvulnerable is not housed in a cell with a medically vulnerable inmate; and medically \nvulnerable  inmates  remain  in  current  cohorted  “family  units”  to  the  extent  they  are \ncohorted only with one other medically vulnerable inmate in their cell. \n(5) Allow the maximum amount of daily out-of-cell time WCJ can provide inmates \nwhile following cohorting and social distancing protocols. \n(6) Require WCJ Detentions Division staff to ensure enhanced sanitation in the \nWCJ housing units; prior to medically vulnerable inmates entering any WCJ common \narea, which includes bathrooms, an EPA-approved disinfectant spray which combats \nCOVID-19 as certified by the EPA will be sprayed on all surfaces open for use by such \ninmates, allowing for recommended contact time for complete disinfection to occur \nbefore such inmates enter; medically vulnerable inmates will be encouraged to practice \nsocial distancing continuously (to supplement the existing placement of thick black \ngaffers tape throughout the WCJ for visual representation of six feet apart from person \nto person), to disinfect any commonly used equipment on their way out and their way in, \nand to increase their own cleaning practices to include frequent hand washing and \npersonal sanitation; medically vulnerable inmates who willfully refuse to adhere to \nrecommended practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19 despite such \nencouragements will be noted in the WCJ records management system; personal \nhygiene supplies and bottles of an EPA-approved disinfectant spray will remain \navailable to all inmates, inclusive of medically vulnerable inmates, without cost; in the \nevent the WCJ inmate population reaches a low enough threshold that “medically \nvulnerable” inmates can be further distanced from non-“medically vulnerable” inmates, \nthen they shall be, while recognizing that limiting movement from one housing unit to \nanother to ensure prevention of cross-contamination from one population to another \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 110   Filed 02/16/21   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 17\npopulation is consistent with public health guidance in a correctional setting; WCJ will \nmaintain increased supplies of bottles of an EPA-approved disinfectant spray and \nmasks to ensure all inmates have access to both masks and such disinfecting spray at \nall times; when necessary and only in a medically-sound manner that does not \naerosolize droplets that may contain COVID-19 or otherwise lead to increased spread of \nCOVID-19, power washers may be used on water-resistant surfaces, when applicable, \nto enhance cleaning; when necessary, only Trustee inmates who are both properly \ntrained in biohazard cleanup and outfitted with proper personal protective equipment will \nbe utilized to clean up areas previously occupied by an inmate confirmed to have tested \npositive for COVID-19.  WCJ shall provide increased professional cleaning services to \naugment the enhanced sanitation efforts of Detentions Division staff if warranted by the \nsituation. \n(7) Ensure that all inmates shall have access to at least two cloth masks or at \nleast one disposable mask at all times. WCJ shall monitor mask usage by all inmates; \nall WCJ staff (and third-party contractors) shall be required to wear a face mask at all \ntimes when interacting in any manner with inmates, and WCJ shall monitor mask usage \nby such staff; WCJ shall provide reusable cloth masks to inmates who are not medically \nvulnerable and ensure such inmates are provided the opportunity to wash said cloth \nmasks every three days; WCJ shall provide disposable masks to medically vulnerable \ninmates and such masks will be replaced in accordance with CDC guidelines and \nmanufacturer recommendations, or sooner if said masks become soiled or damaged. \nWCJ will continue to provide a mask to all inmates who are released from the WCJ. \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 110   Filed 02/16/21   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 17\n(8) Ensure medical monitoring for medically vulnerable inmates housed within the \nWCJ: qualified medical staff will perform four “daily checks” on medically vulnerable \ninmates consisting of temperature checks and full symptom screenings. \n(9) Ensure that symptom screening shall be dictated, at minimum, by then-\ncurrent CDC guidelines and will be according to the attached second updated screening \nprotocol (attached as Exhibit A-3 to this Consent Decree). \n(10)  Provide testing for all inmates according to then-current CDC guidelines \nas soon as possible following the report of one or more symptoms for COVID-19 \nconsistent with CDC screening questions, without imposing additional requirements \nbeyond the CDC screening questions, although Defendant may make testing more \nfrequently available. Testing shall be performed as soon as possible from the time of the \nreport.  When an inmate tests positive for COVID-19 or is designated by a health care \nprofessional as presumptive positive for COVID-19, the WCJ will follow current CDC \ncriteria for testing, quarantine, and isolation. These criteria have changed since CDC \nguidelines for correctional facilities were originally issued and may continue to change \nas new data points are made available to and accounted for by the CDC.  \n(11)  Continue implementation of the following protocol in both intake/transition \nunits and general population units: an inmate in the WCJ who is symptomatic for or \ntests positive for COVID-19 is isolated in a medical isolation unit in the WCJ per current \nCDC criteria. These criteria have changed since CDC guidelines for correctional \nfacilities were originally issued and may continue to change as new data points are \nmade available to and accounted for by the CDC. \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 110   Filed 02/16/21   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 17\n(12)  Ensure that medical isolation is a non-punitive environment and inmates \nshall have access to personal items, such recreational materials which can be \neffectively sanitized, and time outside of their cell while in medical isolation;  \n(13) Continue to allow remote visitation for inmates with any visitor, including \npersonal, jail-based behavioral, legal, or others; however, nothing in this agreement \nprohibits or discourages allowing for in-person visitation in compliance with CDC \nguidelines. Video visitation from the WCJ’s front lobby shall remain a free service. \n(14) Provide informational updates to inmates housed within the WCJ, both via \npaper as appropriate and via video message, as to best practices on how to prevent the \nspread of COVID-19, which shall include, as part of the intake process, an initial viewing \nof a previously prepared video addressing best practices for preventing the spread of \nCOVID-19;  \n(15) Furnish to the ACLU of Colorado, via email to Mark Silverstein at \nmsilverstein@aclu-co.org and Nicole Loy at nloy@aclu-co.org, on or before 11:59:59 \nPM Mountain Time on Tuesday of every week, the following WCJ data for the lookback \nperiod which is defined as the previous Monday at 05:00:00 AM through Sunday at \n05:00:01 AM, thus resulting in seven (7) days of reported data, at 05:00:00 AM each \nday of said lookback period: \na.  Average daily inmate population as logged at 05:00:00 AM each day of \nthe lookback period; \nb.  Average daily population of medically vulnerable inmates as logged at \n05:00:00 AM each day of the lookback period; \nc.  Total number of medically vulnerable inmates identified during the \nintake screening process each day of the lookback period. \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 110   Filed 02/16/21   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 17\nd.

Total number of COVID-19 tests administered to inmates each day \nduring the lookback period and results of those tests (positive, negative, \ninconclusive); and \nf.  Total number of inmates transferred to a hospital for care each day \nduring the lookback period due to COVID-19. \nThe procedures set forth above may be modified as necessary by further Order from the \nCourt. In addition, as set forth in Section III.E.2 above, Defendant by and through his \ncounsel shall furnish Mr. Silverstein with an identification of which inmates in the WCJ \nare classified as “medically vulnerable” pursuant to this Consent Decree, for a lookback \nperiod of the prior fourteen days defined as the two-weeks-previous Monday at 05:00:00 \nAM through the previous Sunday at 05:00:01 AM, thus resulting in fourteen (14) days of \nreported data, at 05:00:00 AM each day of said lookback period. Defendant shall furnish \nMr. Silverstein with such identification every fourteen days, that is, with every other \ntransmission of the data set forth in this paragraph which Defendant is furnishing to Mr. \nSilverstein on a weekly basis. Mr. Silverstein, for himself and on behalf of all counsel \nwho entered an appearance for Plaintiffs or the Class or both in the Lawsuit, agrees \nsuch identification shall be used only by counsel acting on behalf of Plaintiffs or \nmembers of the Class and shall be used only for class counsel purposes. \nF.  Payment of Certain Attorney Fees and Costs Attributable to Counsel for \nU\nPlaintiffs and the Class from Defendant By and Through the Weld County \nBoard of County Commissioners \n \nWithin twenty-one (21) days from the date the Court enters this Order in its final \nform, Defendant shall cause to be paid $122,387.60 as reimbursement for Attorney \n14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 110   Filed 02/16/21   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 17\nFees and Costs.

      "text": "Case 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 71   Filed 06/29/20   USDC Colorado   Page 1 of 11\n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO \n \nCivil Action No.: 20-cv-977-PAB-SKC \n \nTHOMAS CARRANZA, et al., \n  Plaintiffs, on their own and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons, \nv. \nSTEVEN REAMS, Sheriff of Weld County, Colorado, in his official capacity, \n  Defendant. \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n \n \nI.  INTRODUCTION  \nPlaintiffs seek relief on behalf of all medically vulnerable individuals incarcerated in the \nWeld County Jail and at risk of serious, possibly fatal, harm from COVID-19. Given the large \nnumber of inmates at risk within the Weld County Jail who are in need of protection and would \nbenefit from injunctive relief, because Plaintiffs meet the requirements under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) \nand 23(b), and because the arguments raised by Defendants go primarily to the merits of Plaintiffs’ \nclaims rather than the question of certification, class certification is appropriate in this case.  \nII.  PLAINTIFFS HAVE MET THEIR BURDEN WITH RESPECT TO RULE 23(a). \nA.  Defendant Reams concedes the numerosity of Plaintiff’s proposed Class. \nIn  his  Response,  Defendant  Reams  “acknowledges  [the]  number  of  potential  class \nmembers.”  [Dkt. 64 at 4].  This is likely because the proposed Class encompasses a significant \nproportion of the inmates at the Weld County Jail and, given the varying lengths of sentences and \nunpredictable  nature  of  COVID-19,  that  number  may  change  and  make  traditional  joinder \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 71   Filed 06/29/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 11\n \nimpractical, if not impossible.  See [Dkt. 2 at 6].  Accordingly, the proposed Class satisfies the \nRule 23(a)(1) numerosity requirement.  \nB.  Plaintiffs’ claims present sufficient issues of fact and law in common with the \nproposed class. \nPlaintiffs  have  also  satisfied  the  commonality  inquiry.    To  meet  the  commonality \nrequirement of Rule 23(a)(2), a proposed class’s “claims must depend upon a common contention. \n. . [and] determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of \neach one of the claims in one stroke.”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350.   “A finding of commonality \nrequires only a single question of law or fact common to the entire class.”  D.G. ex rel. Stricklin v. \nDevaughn, 594 F.3d 1188, 1195 (10th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted).  While “mere allegations of \nsystemic violations of the law” do not satisfy the commonality requirement, “every member of the \nclass need not be in a situation identical to that of the named plaintiff,” so long as a common \n“discrete legal or factual question” exists.  Id.  \nIn his Response, Defendant asserts that Plaintiffs cannot meet their burden with respect to \nthe commonality requirement because “any injunctive relief must inevitably be tailored to unique \nconsiderations of each inmate. . . .”  [Dkt. 64 at 5].  In addition to being an incorrect statement \nabout  the  relief  requested  by  Plaintiffs,  this  assertion  also  misapprehends  the  commonality \nanalysis.  As stated in Plaintiffs’ Motion, there are multiple questions of law and fact pertaining to \nthe Weld County Jail’s policies and practices regarding COVID-19, including whether the Weld \nCounty Jail’s course of conduct has exposed the class to harm and/or a substantial risk of harm.  \nAlthough the specific medical circumstances of individual class members may vary—as would be \nthe case with almost any health-related class—the question of whether Defendant’s failures to take \nappropriate preventative measures exposed the proposed Class members to a substantial risk of \nharm can be answered the same for the class as a whole, such that “an issue that is central to the \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 71   Filed 06/29/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 11\n \nvalidity of each one of the claims” can be resolved in “one stroke.”  See Wal-Mart, 564 U.S at 350.  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs have satisfied the commonality requirement. \nC.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of those of the proposed class. \nPlaintiffs have similarly met their burden to establish typicality.  “Typicality measures \nwhether a sufficient nexus exists between the claims of the named representatives and those of the \nclass at large.”  Thompson v. Jiffy Lube Int’l, Inc., 250 F.R.D. 607, 622 (D. Kan. 2008).  In contrast \nto what Defendant Reams contends, see [Dkt. 64 at 5-6], “[t]ypicality does not require that the \nclaims of the class members be identical to the claims of the class plaintiffs,” for “[n]o action could \nproceed as a class action if each named plaintiff had to uniformly assert the same legal claims or \nhad to have suffered the same injuries as all class members.”  Id.  (citation omitted).  Indeed, \n“differing fact situations of class members do not defeat typicality . . . so long as the claims of the \nclass representatives and class members are based on the same legal or remedial theory.”  Id. \n(quoting Adamson v. Bowen, 855 F.2d 668, 675 (10th Cir. 1988)).      \nRegardless of the constitutional amendment under which a particular plaintiff’s claims \narise,  the  typicality  analysis  is  the  same  for  both.  As  stated  above,  see  Part  III.B,  supra, \nnotwithstanding the various individual characteristics of the named Plaintiffs and proposed Class, \na common inquiry guides the resolution of this case; specifically, whether Defendant Reams’s \nconduct has created a substantial risk of harm and/or death.  Furthermore, if the Court should later \ndetermine that utilizing different legal standards is necessary for resolving claims brought under \nthe Eighth Amendment versus the Fourteenth Amendment, see [Dkt. 55 at 18 n.9], it can amend \nthe order certifying the class to include subclasses at that time.  See F.R.C.P. 23(c)(1)(C), 23(c)(5).   \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 71   Filed 06/29/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 11\n \nD.  Given the transitory nature of county jail detention, Plaintiffs can adequately \nrepresent the proposed Class. \nDefendant Reams also incorrectly claims that “Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief are \nmoot,” because the named Plaintiffs have been released from the Weld County Jail.  [Dkt. 64 at \n6].  However, in cases such as the one at bar where the claim is “capable of repetition, yet evading \nreview,” the termination of a class representative’s claim does not moot the claims of the class as \na whole.  Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 110 n.11 (1975).  The United States Supreme Court \naddressed the issue of a proposed class representative’s release from pretrial detention in Gerstein \nv. Pugh.  In determining that the termination of the named class representative’s individual claim \ndid not moot the claims of the unnamed members of the class, the Court noted: \nPretrial detention is by nature temporary, and it is most unlikely that any given \nindividual could have his constitutional claim decided on appeal before he is either \nreleased  or  convicted.    The  individual  could  nonetheless  suffer  repeated \ndeprivations, and it is certain that other persons similarly situated will be detained \nunder the allegedly unconstitutional procedures.  The claim, in short, is one that is \ndistinctly ‘capable of repetition, yet evading review.’ \n \nId.  Likewise, in U.S. Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388 (1980), the Court held that “an \naction brought on behalf of a class does not become moot upon expiration of the named plaintiff’s \nsubstantive claim . . . .”  445 U.S. at 404. \n  In keeping with Gerstein and Geraghty, the Tenth Circuit has determined that “a nascent \ninterest attaches to the proposed class upon the filing of a class complaint” such that termination \nof the named class representative’s claim does not moot the action as a whole.   Lucero v. Bureau \nof Collection Recovery, Inc., 639 F.3d 1239, 1249 (10th Cir. 2011). \n  The cases cited by Defendant Reams do not warrant a departure from the precedent set \nforth above.  For example, Green v. Branson, 108 F.3d 1296 (10th Cir. 1997), cited by Defendant \nfor the proposition that an inmate’s claim for injunctive relief is moot upon release from the subject \nfacility, [Dkt. 64 at 4], involved a single plaintiff.  The reasoning set forth in Gerstein and Geraghty \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 71   Filed 06/29/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 11\n \nobviously does not apply in cases in which there is a single plaintiff.  Clark v. State Farm Mut. \nAuto. Ins. Co., 590 F.3d 1134 (10th Cir. 2009) is likewise inapposite, for that case concerned a \nplaintiff who sought class certification more than two years after judgment on the merits entered \nin his favor.  Id. at 1136.  Indeed, Clark specifically noted that the United States Supreme Court \nhas suggested two situations in which a class may be certified despite the mooting \nof  the  named  plaintiff’s  claim  prior  to  the  district  court’s  class  certification \ndecision: (1) when the plaintiff’s claim is ‘capable of repetition, yet evading \nreview,’ and (2) when the plaintiff’s claim is ‘inherently transitory [such] that the \ntrial court will not have even enough time to rule on a motion for class certification \nbefore the proposed representative’s individual interest expires.   \n \nId. at 1139 (quoting Geraghty, 445 U.S. at 398-400) (emphasis in original). \n  Plaintiffs’ claims on behalf of both pretrial detainees and convicted inmates fall within both \nexceptions laid out by the Supreme Court.  Until Defendant Reams and officials of the Weld \nCounty Jail change the policies and procedures surrounding COVID-19 and medically-vulnerable \ninmates, current and new inmates will continue to be at risk of harm.  Furthermore, inmates at the \nWeld County Jail, whether awaiting trial or serving a sentence pursuant to a criminal conviction, \nusually spend no more than a year in the facility, at most, since it is solely a county jail.  Any one \ninmate’s time in the Jail is necessarily transitory and will likely end before any federal litigation \nwould.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ release from the Weld County Jail does not moot the motion for \nclass certification, and, for the reasons set forth in Plaintiff’s Motion, Plaintiffs can adequately \nserve as class representatives.   \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS HAVE ALSO MET THEIR BURDEN UNDER RULE 23(b)(2). \nCertification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) is proper if the movant shows “that the party \nopposing class certification ‘acted or refused to act’ on grounds generally applicable to the class, \nsuch that final or declaratory relief is appropriate as to ‘the class as a whole.’”  Vallario v. \nVandehey, 554 F.3d 1259, 1267 (10th Cir. 2009).  The injuries sustained by the proposed class \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 71   Filed 06/29/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 11\n \nmembers must be “sufficiently similar that they can be addressed in a single injunction that need \nnot differentiate between class members,” id. at 1268 (quotation omitted); however, “[t]hat the \nclaims of individual class members may differ factually should not preclude certification under \nRule 23(b)(2) of a claim seeking the application of a common policy.”  J.B. ex rel. Hart v. Valdez, \n186 F.3d 1280, 1288 (10th Cir. 1999). \nFurthermore, though the determination whether class certification is appropriate “entail[s] \nsome overlap with the merits of the plaintiff’s underlying claim,” id. at 350-51, “Rule 23 grants \ncourt no license to engage in free-ranging merits inquiries at the certification stage.”  Amgen Inc. \nv. Conn. Ret. Plans & Tr. Funds, 568 U.S. 455, 466 (2013).  That is, merits questions may be \nconsidered only to the extent “that they are relevant to determining whether Rule 23 prerequisites \nfor class certification are satisfied.”  Id.   \nA.  Defendant’s reliance on Shook II is misplaced. \nDefendant cites Shook v. Bd. of Cty. Commr’s, 543 F.3d 597 (10th Cir. 2008) (“Shook II”) \nin arguing that Plaintiffs cannot meet their burden under Rule 23(b)(2).  However, Shook II is \ndistinguishable from this case. \nAs set forth more fully in Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification, Plaintiffs have met \ntheir burden under Rule 23(b)(2).  Through this action, Plaintiffs seek a Court order implementing \na single, system-wide process to rectify the violation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights and to \nprotect them from the threat of COVID-19 exposure by way of, inter alia, physical distancing \nrequirements, increased cleaning protocols, and provision of personal protective equipment.  This \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 71   Filed 06/29/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 11\n \nsingular injunctive relief to remedy classwide civil-rights violations is precisely the sort of relief \nRule 23(b)(2) was designed to facilitate.1   \nShook II is distinguishable in this regard.  In that case, plaintiffs sought to certify a class of \ninmates suffering from a variety of mental illnesses, all of which put the inmates at varying levels \nof risk and types of harm at the hands of prison officials.  Id. at 605-06.  By contrast, the proposed \nClass members here, whether suffering from COPD, over the age of 55, or having a history of \nsmoking or other substance abuse disorders, all face the same risk as a result of Defendant Reams’s \ninaction: increased complications from COVID-19, including an increased risk of mortality.  \nLikewise, Shook II noted that the “chief difficulty” with respect to plaintiffs’ proposed certification \nwas that “much of the relief plaintiffs seek would require the district court to craft an injunction \nthat distinguishes—based on individual characteristics and circumstances—between how prison \nofficials may treat class members, rather than prescribing a standard of conduct applicable to all \nclass members.”  Id. at 605.  The same cannot be said here.  Again, irrespective of the proposed \nClass members’ varying conditions that make them medically-vulnerable to COVID-19, the relief \nPlaintiffs seek—six feet of separation between inmates and staff, single-cell housing, provision of \npersonal  protective  equipment  including  masks,  thorough  cleaning  protocols,  and  related \nmeasures—are common practices that apply to all proposed Class members to decrease the risk of \n \n1 Indeed, Plaintiffs’ proposed Class is similar to certified classes around the country seeking \nadequate protection of their civil rights and from the particular dangers COVID-19 presents to \nincarcerated individuals.  E.g., Valentine v. Collier, No. 4:20-CV-1115, 2020 WL 3491999 (June \n27, 2020) (certifying class of current and future inmates detained within a unit for elderly inmates \nand inmates with health problems); Ahlman v. Barnes, No. SACV 20-835 JGB (SHKx), 2020 WL \n2754938 (C.D. Cal. May 26, 2020) (certifying classes of all current and future pre-trial detainees \nand post-conviction prisoners incarcerated in the Orange County Jail); Cameron v. Bouchard, No. \n20-10949, 2020 WL 2569868 (E.D. Mich. May 21, 2020) (certifying subclass of medically-\nvulnerable inmates).  See also Fraihat v. United States Immigration & Customs Enf’t, 2020 WL \n1932570, -- F. Supp. 3d -- (C.D. Cal Apr. 20, 2020) (certifying class of medically-vulnerable \ndetainees at ICE facilities). \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 71   Filed 06/29/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 11\n \nCOVID-19 spreading among the population at the Weld County Jail, without differentiation for \nvarying medical conditions.  Shook II does not warrant denying class certification in this case. \nB.  Defendant’s additional arguments with respect to Rule 23(b)(2) are similarly \nunavailing. \nDefendant Reams further alleges two purported deficiencies in Plaintiffs’ showing under \nRule 23(b)(2).  [Dkt. 64 at 10].  Neither provides an adequate basis to deny class certification. \nWith respect to a purported lack of allegations regarding “how the Sheriff here has acted \nor refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,” [Dkt. 64 at 10], there is ample \nevidence in the record regarding Defendant’s and the Weld County Jail’s deficient response to \nCOVID-19.  See, e.g., [Dkt. 1] (Plaintiff’s Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary \nInjunction, and Expedited Hearing with exhibits), [Dkt. 62 at 3-9] (Plaintiffs’ Motion for Forthwith \nHearing Regarding Defendant’s Non-Compliance with the Court’s Preliminary Injunction).  The \nCourt has already determined that there are sufficient allegations regarding Defendant’s failures \nwith respect to the proposed Class such that a preliminary injunction is warranted.  Given that \nPlaintiffs have established a “likelihood of success on the merits” regarding Defendant’s inaction, \nit is clear that Plaintiffs have demonstrated that the Sheriff here has acted or refused to act on \ngrounds that apply generally to the class. \n  Defendant’s second argument against class certification appears to rest largely on his \ncontention that the requested classwide relief is “totally unmanageable.”  [Dkt. 64 at 8].  As an \ninitial matter, the fact that preliminary classwide injunctive relief has already been granted in this \ncase illustrates that classwide relief is feasible and possible.  See [Dkt. 55] (granting in part \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction). \n  Furthermore, the scope of the requested classwide relief is a merits determination, and thus \nnot eligible for review upon a motion for class certification.  See Amgen, 568 U.S. at 466; United \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 71   Filed 06/29/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 11\n \nStates v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Co-op., 532 U.S. 483, 496 (2001) (courts enjoy broad \ndiscretion in fashioning injunctive relief).  Should the Court determine that Defendant Reams’s \ncontentions regarding the feasibility of Plaintiffs’ requested injunctive relief are meritorious, it can \naddress those contentions in fashioning the final remedy in this case.  However, such a possibility \ndoes not warrant denying class certification.     \nIV.  THE COURT DID NOT REPUDIATE THE PROPOSED CLASS. \nLastly, Defendant Reams’s contention that the Court rejected Plaintiff’s proposed Class in \nits May 11, 2020 Order is incorrect.  Notably, in granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction, the Court did not rule on Plaintiffs’ proposed class definition.  See [Dkt. 55 at 37-38].  \nThe Court’s choosing a different definition of persons to be protected for the purposes of granting \npreliminary injunctive relief is not equivalent to a determination regarding class certification—it \ninstead reflects the Court’s determination of the breadth of its Order under the standards and \nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 65. \nFurthermore, if the Court were to find Plaintiffs’ proposed class definition too broad when \napplying the relevant Rule 23 standards, it is within the Court’s discretion to modify it, rather than \nrejecting class certification outright.  E.g., Colo. Cross-Disability Coal. v. Taco Bell Corp., 184 \nF.R.D. 354, 357 (D. Colo. 1999) (court has “discretion to alter, expand, subdivide or modify the \nclass definition”) (citing Vaszlavik v. Storage Tech., Corp., 175 F.R.D. 672, 683 (D. Colo. 1997); \nWest v. Capitol Fed. Savings & Loan Ass’n, 558 F.2d 977, 982 (10th Cir. 1977)).  Defendant’s \ncontention that certification should be denied based on the Court’s prior Order should be rejected.   \nV.  CONCLUSION \nDefendant’s Response is largely premised on his assertion that, given the constraints of the \nWeld County Jail, any sort of classwide relief is “totally unmanageable.”  Plaintiffs have no doubt \nthat managing an unprecedented crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic is a difficult and at times \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 71   Filed 06/29/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 11\n \noverwhelming task.  However, this does not justify a denial of class certification; indeed, without \nthe ability to bring claims as a class, current and future inmates of the Weld County Jail will \ncontinue to face a substantial risk of harm.  Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above and in \nPlaintiffs’ Motion, the proposed Class should be certified. \n  Dated: June 29, 2020 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \ns/ Daniel D.

INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs’  Motion  for  Forthwith  Hearing  (“Motion”)  begins  with  the  factually \nunsupported speculation that Anthony Griego, formerly an inmate at the Weld County Jail \n(“WCJ”), died of COVID-19. In fact, no determination has yet been made about Mr. \nGriego’s cause of death by the Weld County Coroner or anyone else. Plaintiffs’ Motion \nthen offers even more factually unsupported speculation the Sheriff and Weld County \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 16\n \nSheriff’s Office (“WCSO”) are engaging in willful noncompliance with this Court’s narrow \nOrder Granting in Part and Otherwise Denying Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction \n[ECF 55]. Tellingly, nowhere in the Motion (or in any filing by Plaintiffs to date) have \nPlaintiffs acknowledged this Court’s definition of “medically vulnerable” is much narrower \nthan the one Plaintiffs proposed.  In addition, neither at the hearing before this Court, nor \nin Plaintiffs’ Motion, nor at any other time during the course of this litigation have Plaintiffs \noffer any evidence whatsoever to contradict the Sheriff’s and the WCSO’s judgment \nconcerning jail operations and consideration of all the different factors beyond only inmate \nhealth which this Court recognized the Sheriff and the WCSO must consider in making \ninmate housing assignments and otherwise implementing this Court’s Order. For the \nreasons set forth below, Plaintiffs are incorrect, no forthwith hearing is required, the \nSheriff is in full compliance with this Court’s Order, and Plaintiffs’ Motion must be denied. \nII.  RELEVANT BACKGROUND \n1.  On May 11, 2020, the Court entered the narrow Order [ECF 55], requiring the \nSheriff accomplish the following: \na.  A certification to the Court of identification of a list of persons identified as \n“medically vulnerable” according to the Court’s narrow definition of that term, along \nwith providing the list to the Court and Plaintiffs and explaining its compilation; \nb.  “A policy ensuring that, to the maximum extent possible considering the \nJail’s  physical  layout,  population  level,  and  classification  needs,  medically \nvulnerable inmates are ‘socially distanced’ from other inmates housed in the Jail”; \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 16\n \nc.  “A procedure, as part of the intake of new inmates into the Jail, for medically \nvulnerable inmates to be single-celled or otherwise socially distanced, to the \nmaximum extent possible considering the Jail’s physical layout and classification \nneeds, while housed in the transition unit”; \nd.  “A  policy  of enhanced  sanitation procedures  in  areas  where  medically \nvulnerable inmates are housed”; \ne.  “A plan to obtain a sufficient number or type of masks so that inmates do \nnot need to wear them for more than their intended duration or so that inmates \nmay be able to clean them”; and \nf.  “A policy providing for increased monitoring of medically vulnerable inmates \nfor symptoms of COVID-19”. \n[ECF 55 at 38-39]. By its terms this Court’s Order expires August 9, 2020. [ECF 55 at 39]. \n2.  On May 18, 2020, the Sheriff submitted his Notice of Complete Compliance \nwith this Court’s Order, setting forth (a) comprehensive explanations as to the endeavors \nof the Sheriff and the WCSO to analyze what the Court required from all applicable \nangles,  (b)  the  responsive  policies,  procedures,  and  plans  the  Sheriff  and  WCSO \ndeveloped, and (c) the increased financial and operational costs which the WCSO has \nincurred, is incurring, and will incur in connection with efforts to combat COVID-19 (and, \nby extension, in connection with compliance with ECF 55). [See ECF 60 to 60-14]. \n3.  The Motion expressly concedes the sufficiency of the Sheriff’s policies and \nprocedures respecting (d) enhanced sanitation for medically vulnerable inmates and \nrespecting (e) masks for inmates. [See ECF 62 at 2]. \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 16\n \n4.  The Motion, by omission, also concedes the sufficiency of the Sheriff’s policies \nand procedures respecting (f) enhanced medical monitoring for medically vulnerable \ninmates for symptoms of COVID-19. [See generally ECF 62]. \n5.  In contrast, the Motion claims (without attaching any evidentiary submission) \nthe Sheriff’s substantial compliance efforts are deficient in connection with three and only \nthree areas, namely (a) the procedures utilized to identify medically vulnerable inmates, \n(b) the policy for social distancing and housing of medically vulnerable inmates in general \npopulation units within the WCJ, and (c) the policy for social distancing and housing of \nmedically vulnerable inmates in intake units within the WCJ. [See generally ECF 62]. \n6.  Six days after the Motion was filed, Plaintiffs submitted a “Notice of Submission \nof Supplemental Support to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Forthwith Hearing” to which was attached \nthe First Supplemental Declaration of Carlos Franco-Paredes, Plaintiffs’ expert witness, \nin purported support of entitlement to a forthwith hearing. [See ECF 63 and ECF 63-1]. \n7.  The Sheriff provided a lengthy analysis and assessment as to the limits on his \nability to provide social distancing in housing medically vulnerable inmates in both general \npopulation and intake, and how he and the WCSO arrived at the policies presented to this \nCourt on these issues. [See ECF 60-8 ¶¶ 14-17 (general population), ¶¶ 18-21 (intake)]. \n8.  Plaintiffs’ Motion presents no evidence from any jail or correctional expert to \ncontradict or call into question the Sheriff’s and the WCSO’s perspective. [ECF 62]. \nIII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nNeither any Local Rule within this District, nor any Civil Practice Standard of this \nCourt, nor any Tenth Circuit opinion, governs requests for a forthwith hearing. And given \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 16\n \nthe broad scope of the Sheriff’s compliance efforts as detailed in ECF 60 and its exhibits, \nthe Sheriff disagrees the Motion properly invokes this Court’s inherent authority to effect \ncompliance with its Order, whether generally speaking or specifically in the context of \nUnited States v. United Mine Workers of Am., 330 U.S. 258 (1947) (plurality). United \nMine Workers does not apply here because the primary concern of the Supreme Court \nof the United States there was confirming the District Court could enforce willful violations \nof its own orders via the criminal contempt power, the use of which isn’t warranted here. \nThus, the Sheriff construes the Motion as seeking modification of this Court’s Order.1 \nCases are scant as to the applicable standard when a party seeks to modify a \npreliminary injunction (in contrast to a temporary restraining order, permanent injunction, \nor consent decree), but they appear to indicate the party seeking modification bears the \nburden at a minimum to show existence of changed circumstances, although it is unclear \nwhether this burden is sourced in Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), the Court’s inherent authority, or \nsome other principle. E.g., Verlo v. Martinez, 820 F.3d 1113, 1126 n.4 (10th Cir. 2016); \ncf. David C. v. Leavitt, 242 F.3d 1206, 1210-11 (10th Cir. 2001); Rossi Ventures, Inc. \nv. Pasquini, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 168925, at *17-18 (D. Colo. Nov. 28, 2012). \nIV.  ARGUMENT \nFor several reasons, Plaintiffs failed to carry their burden to show good cause for \nor changed circumstances requiring a hearing or any modification of this Court’s Order. \n                                                 \n1 But cf. MSK Civ. Prac. Std. 7.3(f). In addition, the Court’s lack of reaction to \nPlaintiffs’ Motion from its filing through the date of the Sheriff’s Response indicates the \nCourt does not concur with the notion that an expedited hearing is necessary or proper \nfrom the face of Plaintiffs’ filings. [Cf. ECF 23, ECF 27, ECF 33]. \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 16\n \nA. The Procedures Used to Identify Medically Vulnerable Inmates Are Compliant \nThis Court’s Order requiring the Sheriff to identify a list of “medically vulnerable” \ninmates per the Court’s narrow definition, along with providing the list to the Court and \nPlaintiffs and explaining its compilation, stated verbatim: \n[O]n or before May 18, 2020, at 5:00 p.m., defendant shall certify to the Court \nthat he has compiled a list of those persons (“medically vulnerable inmates”) \ncurrently held at the Weld County Jail who have one or more of the following \nconditions: are 65 years and older, have chronic lung disease or moderate \nto severe asthma, have serious heart conditions, are immunocompromised, \nhave  severe  obesity,  have  diabetes,  have  chronic  kidney  disease  and \nundergoing dialysis, or have liver disease. Defendant shall provide to the \nCourt and plaintiffs a list of medically vulnerable inmates by inmate number, \nidentifying for each what risk categories the inmate has and explaining what \nprocess he used to identify medically vulnerable inmates. [ECF 55 at 37-38]. \n \nAs part of his Notice of Complete Compliance, the Sheriff disclosed to the Court \nthe screening tool WCJ medical staff and augmented nursing staff used on May 13, 2020, \nto perform a facility-wide screening of inmates to ascertain whether they were “medically \nvulnerable” under this Court’s limited criteria. [See ECF 60-4; see also ECF 60-1 ¶¶ 11-\n14]. This screening tool tracks this Court’s indicated risk category criteria for medically \nvulnerable inmates, using the criteria in the Order. [Compare ECF 55 at 37-38 with ECF \n60-4]. What’s more, the roster by inmate number and risk category the Sheriff provided \nto this Court also tracks the Court’s criteria. [Compare ECF 55 at 37-38 with ECF 60-5]. \nAnd further, the Sheriff’s evidence indicated this tool would be in use with respect to new \narrestees admitted to the intake units on a going-forward basis. [ECF 60-1 ¶ 12]. \nDespite the Sheriff carrying out this Court’s expectation thoroughly, Plaintiffs assert \nhis efforts are lacking and fewer than all “medically vulnerable” inmates, as defined by the \nCourt, are being identified. But Plaintiffs provided the Court no evidence this is occurring \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 16\n \napart from speculation. Instead, it turns out rather than having a problem with the Sheriff’s \ncompliance efforts, what Plaintiffs really take issue with is the scope of the Court’s Order \nnarrowly defining “medically vulnerable.” It is notable Plaintiffs’ stated concern with the \nSheriff’s screening tool [see ECF 62 at 8] appears to be the Sheriff did not ask about \nspecific medical conditions, which Plaintiffs proposed yet this Court specifically rejected \nin narrowly defining “medically vulnerable.” [Compare ECF 1 at 26 (Plaintiffs’ proposed \ndefinition of “medically vulnerable,” including several specific medical conditions), with \nECF 55 at 30 (this Court’s narrower definition of “medically vulnerable”)]. Plaintiffs had an \nopportunity to convince this Court a broader definition was appropriate, but the Court did \nnot agree and adopted a narrower definition. Also, the context of the medical screening \nof all WCJ inmates clearly concerned medical vulnerability to COVID-19 and all inmates \nunquestionably would have known this reality. [See ECF 60-1 ¶ 18]. Plaintiffs haven’t \npresented the Court with any quantum of changed circumstances sufficing to show the \nOrder should be modified as to identifying the “medically vulnerable” inmate population \nwithin the WCJ or that any hearing concerning this issue before this Court is necessary. \nB. The Policy Concerning Social Distancing and Housing of Medically Vulnerable \nInmates in General Population Units Within the WCJ Is Compliant \n \nThis Court’s Order requiring the Sheriff to adopt a policy for social distancing and \nhousing medically vulnerable inmates in WCJ general population units stated verbatim: \nA policy ensuring that, to the maximum extent possible considering the Jail’s \nphysical  layout,  population  level,  and  classification  needs,  medically \nvulnerable inmates are “socially distanced” from other inmates housed in the \nJail.  If  social  distancing  is effectively  impossible for some  or all  of  the \nmedically vulnerable inmates in the Jail, such policy may be supplemented \nby housing medically vulnerable inmates together in one or more pods. [ECF \n55 at 38]. \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 16\n \n \nThe Court’s Order also credited, positively, the practice of “cohorting” and the use of \n“family groupings or staggering release of individual cells”. [ECF 55 at 10-11, 24, 31 n.17]. \nWith his Notice of Complete Compliance, the Sheriff provided a comprehensive \nplan to ensure social distancing of medically vulnerable inmates to the maximum extent \npossible in general population given all other factors the Court expressly authorized the \nSheriff to consider. The Sheriff did not state, without more, it was effectively impossible \nto ensure social distancing of all medically vulnerable inmates (nor did the Sheriff cite \ninconvenience to WCSO staff), but listed many specific and concrete reasons why this \npolicy offered the maximum social distancing feasible. [See ECF 60-8 at 4-9.] The Sheriff \nalso gave information, which Plaintiffs haven’t challenged and so presumably won’t, as to \nthe precautionary need to keep a number of housing units unencumbered for intake units \nfor new arrestees and for isolation units. [See ECF 60-8 ¶ 16(j)]. Further, the Sheriff’s \ndecision not to house medically vulnerable inmates in a unit consisting only of medically \nvulnerable inmates is supported by Carlos Franco-Paredes, who agrees this could be \ncounterproductive. [ECF 63-1 at 3-4]. And as for the mere existence of unused cells in \nthe WCJ, the Sheriff testified at the April 30, 2020, hearing as to common-sense reasons \nbehind this, having nothing to do with deliberate indifference to those the Court considers \nmedically vulnerable—but to account for the WCJ’s physical layout, the WCJ’s population \nlevel, and all of the WCJ’s various classification factors. [See ECF 60-8 ¶ 16(c).] \nOnce again, rather than having a problem with the Sheriff’s compliance efforts, \nwhat Plaintiffs really fault is the Court and the scope of its Order allowing the Sheriff to \naccount for many other important factors affecting the WCJ’s physical layout, population \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 16\n \nlevel, and its various classification needs, while still trying to prioritize social distancing of \nmedically vulnerable inmates “to the maximum extent possible” in general population, i.e., \ngiven all other factors the Court believed important enough to permit in its Order. Notably, \nthe Court declined to require in its Order any testing protocol. [See ECF 55 at 33]. Simply, \nPlaintiffs haven’t presented evidence of changed circumstances to show the Order should \nbe modified as to efforts to socially distance “medically vulnerable” inmates in general \npopulation  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  considering  the  WCJ’s  physical  layout, \npopulation level, and classification needs or that any hearing on this issue is necessary. \nC. The  Procedure  Concerning  Social  Distancing  and  Housing  of  Medically \nVulnerable Inmates in Intake Units Within the WCJ Is Compliant \n \nThis Court’s Order requiring the Sheriff to adopt a policy for social distancing and \nhousing of medically vulnerable inmates in intake units within the WCJ, stated verbatim: \nA procedure, as part of the intake of new inmates into the Jail, for medically \nvulnerable inmates to be single-celled or otherwise socially distanced, to the \nmaximum  extent  possible  considering  the  Jail’s  physical  layout  and \nclassification needs, while housed in the transition unit. [ECF 55 at 38]. \n \nWith his Notice of Complete Compliance, the Sheriff provided a comprehensive \nplan to ensure social distancing of medically vulnerable inmates to the maximum extent \npossible in intake/transition units, given the other factors the Court expressly authorized \nthe Sheriff to consider. [ECF 60-8 at 10-11]. In particular, the procedure specifically \nprioritizes housing “medically vulnerable” inmates admitted to WCJ’s intake/transition \nunits in a cell by themselves, alone, and away from other inmates, so Plaintiffs’ conclusory \nassertion the policy does not do so is incorrect. [ECF 60-8 ¶ 19]. The sole exception to \nthis approach is only if it is “not possible” and only “due to the WCJ’s physical layout, \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 16\n \npopulation level, and classification needs”—straight from this Court’s Order—and even \nthen, no more than two “medically vulnerable” inmates can be in the same cell together \nin intake, which still helps ensure social distancing in the intake cells given what the Sheriff \ntestified were the intake unit cell dimensions. [See ECF 60-8 ¶ 19]. And the need to set \naside three housing units for intake units, to ensure enough general population housing \nfor new arrestees who come out of intake units, is due to the flow rate of new inmates into \nthe WCJ which the Sheriff cannot control. WCJ population growth since April 30, 2020, \nproves the Sheriff was right. [See Turner 4th Suppl. Decl., attached as Exh. I, ¶¶ 42-44]. \nAs before, rather than take issue with the Sheriff’s compliance efforts, particularly \non terms the Sheriff articulated in a framework expressly approved by this Court’s Order, \nPlaintiffs really take issue with the scope of the Court’s Order allowing the Sheriff to plan \nfor many other important factors including the WCJ’s physical layout, population level, \nand its various classification needs, while still attempting to prioritize social distancing of \nmedically vulnerable inmates “to the maximum extent possible” in intake units. The Court, \nhowever, believed these other factors important enough to make allowance for them in \nits Order and again declined to include in its Order any testing protocol. [See ECF 55 at \n33-34]. Plaintiffs haven’t presented evidence of changed circumstances to show the \nOrder should be modified as to efforts to socially distance “medically vulnerable” inmates \nin intake units to the maximum extent possible considering the WCJ’s physical layout, \npopulation level, and classification needs or that any hearing on this issue is necessary. \nD. Dr. Franco-Paredes’ First Supplemental Declaration Does Not Change Any of \nthe Above Conclusions, and the Sheriff, His Office, and the WCJ Have Gone \nAbove and Beyond What Is Required of Them \n \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 16\n \nNo other putative factual support for the Motion was offered besides the Franco-\nParedes First Supplemental Declaration, ECF 63-1.2 In any event, the new Declaration is \ninsufficient to prevail upon the Court to hold a forthwith hearing, for several reasons. \nFirst, as previously indicated, given the Court pointedly declined to order any \nCOVID-19 testing protocol as a component of its Order or what it required the Sheriff to \ndo, all purported statements within ECF 63-1 concerning recommendations as to testing \ncan be disregarded as being well outside the narrow scope of what the Court ordered. \nSecond, the Declaration is factually incorrect as to the status of Weld County within \nColorado’s COVID-19 infection continuum, as it relies on outdated information concerning \nthe rate of infection of all persons then residing within a given county such that Weld \nCounty no longer can be considered a hotspot.3 \nThird, Dr. Franco-Paredes disregards the CDC’s own protocol which allows for \ncohorting and imposes upon the Sheriff not only a standard well in excess of what the \nUnited States Constitution requires, but also in excess of what the CDC recommends.4 \n                                                 \n2 Further, the Court must disregard any argument or shift in strategy in Plaintiffs’ \nReply to this Response presenting such factual information for the first time, unless the \nCourt also permits the Sheriff a surreply. E.g., Menge v. AT&T, Inc., 2013 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 20008, at *2 (D. Colo. Feb. 13, 2013) (Brimmer, C.J.) (“Granting leave to file a \nsurreply is part of the ‘supervision of litigation’ and thus falls within the discretion of the \ndistrict court. However, the Court’s discretion is limited insofar as it may not deny the non-\nmovant’s motion to file a surreply unless it disregards any new arguments in the moving \nparty’s reply.”). In addition, allowing Plaintiffs to again metastasize their requested relief \non Reply will represent yet another effort by Plaintiffs to “shift[] over the course of this \ncase” the relief they seek, which is improper. [See ECF 55 at 30 n.16]. \n3 See, e.g., https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/08/denver-coronavirus-deaths-\ninfection-rates/ (last visited June 10, 2020). \n4 The Sheriff continues to maintain CDC guidance is neither binding nor controlling \nin this case. [See ECF 26 at 27-28]. \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 16\n \nFourth, Dr. Franco-Paredes’ musings about screening tools to identify “medically \nvulnerable” inmates must be disregarded because they well exceed the narrow scope of \nwhat the Court ordered as to the Sheriff’s efforts to identify medically vulnerable inmates. \nFifth, with all respect to Dr. Franco-Paredes, he has no knowledge or experience \nrelevant to operating a jail or other correctional facility as he admitted during the hearing \non April 30, 2020, so his opinion about single-celling “medically vulnerable” inmates in \nintake with no exception must be tempered by other legitimate jail-management concerns, \nof  which  the  Court expressly  authorized  consideration.  Further,  the WCSO  already \nprioritizes single-celling “medically vulnerable” inmates in intake. Dr. Franco-Paredes’s \nopinion thus exceeds the narrow scope of what the Court ordered and fails to account for \noutside pressures on the Sheriff and the WCJ in terms of an increase in WCJ population \nwhich the Sheriff cannot control despite pleas to local law enforcement to limit arrests, \nalong with the range of classification factors the Court ordered the Sheriff could consider \nbut which apparently were lost on Dr. Franco-Paredes. Fundamentally, both Plaintiffs and \nDr. Franco-Parades analyze this Court’s Order and the Sheriff’s compliance only through \nlenses of medicine and public health. The lens this Court’s Order actually used, though, \nwas broader and included the Sheriff’s need to operate the WCJ and all considerations \nrelevant to its operation. Plaintiffs never even attempted to offer anyone with any jail or \ncorrectional management experience to provide evidence to this Court contradicting the \nSheriff’s  well-informed  and  well-supported  approach.  The  Sheriff’s  jail  management \nperspective presented in this case, including in his most recent Declaration establishing \nhis compliance with this Court’s Order, remains entirely uncontested by Plaintiffs. \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 16\n \nSixth, and with due respect to Dr. Franco-Paredes, who has not run a jail, his \nrecommendation to single-cell “medically vulnerable” inmates in general population and \nnot allow double-celling, unless they were cleared through testing at least twice in a week, \nlikewise well exceed this Court’s narrow Order and fail to account for outside pressures \non the Sheriff and the WCJ, for the range of classification factors the Court ordered the \nSheriff could consider  which apparently were discounted or ignored by Dr. Franco-\nParedes. [See ECF 60-8 at 4-9; see also Exh. I ¶ 20]. \nIn the interest of transparency, the Sheriff now informs the Court of the result of \nhis Office’s efforts to exceed the scope of the Court’s Order. Although this Court’s Order \nrequired no testing protocol be adopted or any testing conducted, the WCSO believed it \nprudent to make as many efforts as possible to get as many COVID-19 testing kits as \npossible to deliver as rapid of results as possible. Such efforts included several contacts \nwith TKHC, WCHD, CDOC, and CDPHE in April 2020 and May 2020 to attempt to obtain \ntests. However, the WCSO had to conserve testing supplies for inmates in intake, and for \nreasons beyond the WCSO’s control as to which the WCSO won’t speculate, rapid-result \nCOVID-19 testing kits were not available to the WCSO until early June 2020. The WCJ \nfinally obtained, in the first week of June 2020, a batch of testing kits in a number sufficient \nto test every inmate then housed in the WCJ. From June 3-4, 2020, the WCJ administered \na COVID-19 test to 392 of 396 inmates then housed in WCJ general population housing \nunits (four inmates willfully refused the test), with plans to wait to test the inmates then \nwithin intake/transition units until they had been in intake for the prescribed amount of \ntime (on advice of WCHD). [See Exh. I ¶¶ 31-36]. \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 16\n \nTest results were returned on Monday, June 8, 2020, revealing: more than 94% of \nWCJ general population inmates tested negative for COVID-19, including Plaintiff Jesus \nMartinez (the only Plaintiff housed in the WCJ at testing time); both inmates already on \nCOVID-19 isolation protocol tested positive, meaning they remained on medical isolation; \n22 other current inmates tested positive, all of whom were male; four of these inmates \nwere part of the “medically vulnerable” inmate population; these inmates were spread out \namongst almost all general population housing units, which essentially maintained their \n“family unit” status since early April 2020 with its associated limit on inmate movement; \nthese inmates were spread out amongst all classification levels in the WCJ; and all 23 \n“other inmates” who tested positive were asymptomatic. [See Exh. I ¶ 37]. \nOn learning this, the WCSO swiftly took several precautions that day: re-instituting \ntotal lockdown for the WCJ pending results of another testing round, as the total lockdown \nin place the entire month of April 2020 was slightly lifted; removing positive inmates from \ngeneral population and placing them in medical isolation units, per previously identified \nprotocols [see ECF 26-1, ECF 60-8]; quarantining all housing units from which positive \ninmates were taken, per previously identified protocols [see ECF 26-1, ECF 60-8]; began \ndeveloping plans for more WCJ food services staff to assume duties relating to food \nservice, and for female inmates and deputies to assume laundry duties; and calendaring \nJune 22, 2020, as the next date to test every single inmate in WCJ general population \ngiven both the renewed lockdown and the quarantine protocol for all units which had \ninmates test positive. [See Exh. I ¶ 38]. However, for several good reasons, the WCSO \ncannot test all WCJ inmates daily and is constantly reacting. [See id. ¶¶ 39-41]. \n14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 16\n \nFinally, the WCJ has implemented a number of additional measures since May 11, \n2020, which likewise well exceed the scope of the Court’s Order. [See generally Exh. I]. \nV.  CONCLUSION \nIn conclusion, Plaintiffs are trying to move the goalposts on the Sheriff and the \nWCSO, whose efforts at compliance cannot be described as anything less than robust, \nand the Court should not countenance Plaintiffs’ attempt.5 Thus, for all these reasons \nalong with the Notice of Complete Compliance with this Court’s Preliminary Injunction and \nits attachments [ECF 60], Defendant Sheriff Steven Reams requests this Court enter an \nOrder: denying Plaintiffs’ Motion for Forthwith Hearing; concluding the Sheriff along with \nthe WCSO and WCJ complied completely with the terms of this Court’s Order dated May \n11, 2020, and entering all other and further relief as this Court deems just and appropriate. \nDated and respectfully submitted this 11th day of June, 2020. \ns/ Matthew J.

I have personal knowledge of the matters in this Declaration. \n2.  I currently serve as the Jail Captain for the Weld County Jail (“WCJ”) in the \nCounty of Weld, State of Colorado. I have served in this position for six months. \n3.  Before beginning my tenure as the WCSO Jail Captain on January 1, 2020, I \nwas employed with the Weld County Sheriff’s Office (“WCSO”) for eight (8) prior years \nand served in many positions: Corrections Officer (what is now called Detentions Deputy) \nand separately earned my Peace Officer Standards Training (“POST”) certification; Public \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66-1   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 16\n \nInformation Officer Corporal; Detentions Division Shift Sergeant; Civil Unit Sergeant in \ncharge of civil service processors, animal control, and victim advocates; and Detentions \nDivision Lieutenant.  Of my eight years working for the WCSO, I have spent a total of 5.5 \nyears working in the WCJ. \n4.  I also earned an Associate of Arts degree in education from Front Range \nCommunity College in 2011 with a future goal to attain a Bachelor of Science in Criminal \nJustice from the University of Northern Colorado. \n5.  I am individually familiar with the protocols and processes the WCSO as a \nwhole generated, implemented, and refined in response to the global, national, and local \npublic health threat posed by the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) from February 27, 2020, \nthrough today, because I was personally involved in generating, implementing, refining, \nand approving all protocols and processes in consultation with a team of WCSO staff, \nlocal public health officials, and other relevant persons and entities. \n6.  All protocols and processes outlined in Sheriff Steven Reams’ Declaration \ndated April 13, 2020, remain in effect today. All protocols and processes outlined in my \nSupplemental Declaration dated April 24, 2020, also remain in effect today. All protocols \nand processes outlined in my Second Supplemental Declaration dated May 18, 2020, \nalso remain in effect today. All protocols and processes outlined in the Declaration of \nUndersheriff Donnie Patch dated May 18, 2020, also remain in effect today. All protocols \nand processes outlined in Sheriff Steven Reams’ Supplemental Declaration dated May \n18, 2020, also remain in effect today, specifically including but not limited to the enhanced \nmeasures relating to inmates identified as “medically vulnerable” as defined by the Court. \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66-1   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 16\n \nThroughout this Declaration, the term “medically vulnerable” refers only to the Court’s \nnarrower definition.  Based on the continuance of prior measures previously articulated \nto this Court, the information contained in this Fourth Supplemental Declaration must be \nunderstood and reviewed in the context of these other measures previously described \nand set forth in detail in the prior Declarations submitted to this Court. \n7.  I am further individually familiar with further protocols and processes the WCSO \nas  a  whole  generated,  implemented,  and  refined  from  March  1,  2020,  to  date—in \ncontinued consultation with WCJ’s medical services vendor Turn Key Health Clinics \n(“TKHC”), with WCJ’s food services vendor Aramark, and with various Weld County \ndepartments such as the Weld County Health Department (“WCHD”), all of which the \nWCSO has consulted extensively—but about which the Court has not yet been informed. \nThese further protocols and processes, set forth in more detail below, were implemented \nwith the express intent of the WCJ to ensure, to the maximum extent possible, the health \nand safety of each inmate and detainee (collectively “inmates”) housed in the WCJ. \nADDITIONAL STEPS WCSO TOOK TO COMBAT COVID-19 WITH RESPECT TO \nMEDICAL CARE AND MEDICAL MONITORING MEASURES WITHIN THE WCJ, IN \nCONSULTATION WITH TKHC, FROM MARCH 24, 2020, TO PRESENT \n \n8.  On March 24, 2020, more than a week before the WCJ went on lockdown, WCJ \nmedical staff, with the support and consultation of WCSO, began a Vitamin D supplement \nregimen for all inmates identified as “Chronic Care” per TKHC guidelines which indicated \na potential causal protective role for Vitamin D in decreasing respiratory disease risk. \n9.  This Vitamin D supplement regimen for “Chronic Care” inmates remains in \nplace today. \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66-1   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 16\n \n10. Almost all of the inmates which TKHC previously identified as “Chronic Care” \n(except, e.g., pregnant inmates) also ended up being identified as medically vulnerable. \n11. Also, the further screening tools developed to identify inmates as medically \nvulnerable (both in intake housing and in general population housing), as detailed in my \nMay 18, 2020, Second Supplemental Declaration, are still in use today and will be used \nfor the rest of the pandemic. [See ECF 60-1 at 2-3 ¶ 6, 4 ¶¶ 11-12]. \n12. In addition, on May 14, 2020, after meeting with WCSO staff to flesh out the \ncontours of our compliance efforts in connection with the Court’s May 11, 2020 Order, I \nbegan working with WCJ medical staff to ensure they checked medically vulnerable \ninmates four (4) times daily. [See Exh. I-1]. The medical monitoring protocol I understand \nto be set forth in the Sheriff’s Supplemental Declaration dated May 18, 2020, has been in \nplace on or before 5:00 PM May 21, 2020, remains in use today, and will be used for the \nrest of the pandemic. [See ECF 60-8 at 17-20 ¶¶ 30-31]. \n13. Further, Dustin Owens, WCJ’s Health Services Administrator, implemented \nseveral measures on May 19-20, 2020, related to medical monitoring including: an audit \nof all WCJ inmates identified as medically vulnerable per the above-referenced screening \ntools to confirm the claimed condition matched CDC guidelines and added them to the \nmedically vulnerable list to be checked four times daily; and an update to WCJ’s COVID-\n19 screening tool implemented as part of the booking process, including all CDC criteria, \nand if a patient (inmate) met the criteria, it was noted on the form and four-times-daily \nchecks scheduled, and if such patient subsequently went on quarantine or medical \nisolation, related tasks could be scheduled. [See Exh. I-2]. \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66-1   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 16\n \n14. Also, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, all TKHC personnel who \nwork at WCJ have been required to wear masks and submit to temperature screenings \nto the same extent as Detentions Division personnel. \nADDITIONAL STEPS WCSO TOOK TO COMBAT COVID-19 WITH RESPECT TO \nSOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES WITHIN THE WCJ, IN CONSULTATION WITH \nVARIOUS PUBLIC AGENCIES, FROM MAY 11, 2020, TO PRESENT \n \n15. On May 18, 2020, upon prior request of the WCSO, staff of the Weld County \nDepartment of Buildings & Grounds (“B+G”) came to the WCJ to assist with taping off \nspots in each housing unit to help inmates housed in the WCJ ascertain the appropriate \nsocial distance of six feet and make the best choices possible in maintaining the proper \nsocial distance when out of their cells, with enhanced consideration for inmates identified \nas medically vulnerable as defined by the Court. [See Exh. I-3]. \n16. That day, using a significant supply of thick black gaffers tape, B+G staff \nplaced “X” marks in the WCJ as follows: on the floor, every six feet where inmates would \nneed to stand for meals, medications, and other similar purposes; on phones which were \nsix feet from other phones (thus indicating phones which were not marked should not be \nused); and on seats which were six feet from other seats in each day area (thus indicating \nseats which were not marked should not be used). B+G accomplished this task in as \nmany housing units for which they brought tape, but exhausted their supply of tape and \nwere unable to accomplish this task in every single housing unit that day, although the \ntask was ultimately completed as stated in Paragraph 18 below. \n17. Also on May 18, 2020, Detentions Division personnel were instructed that, to \nthe extent any of them were working in a housing unit lacking tape markings, they should \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66-1   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 16\n \nassist inmates with the social distancing determination by approximating six-foot gaps \nbetween inmates using best judgment, directing inmates to social distance using these \ngaps, and strongly encouraging inmates to abide by such directives. [Exh. I-3]. \n18. On May 29, 2020, having obtained a new supply of the thick black gaffers tape \njust the previous day, B+G staff returned to the WCJ to complete the taping task, and \nwithin a few hours completed their taping task. [See Exh. I-4]. \n19. It is important to note that under normal circumstances, this measure of tape \nplacement would not be used due to safety and security concerns with inmates removing \nthe tape and using it for a variety of unauthorized purposes. [See Exh. I-3]. Despite this \nunderstandable limitation on using tape, the WCSO decided tape was the only available \noption to supplement the existing social distancing directives being given on a regular \nbasis to all inmates housed within the WCJ. [E.g., ECF 41-1 at 3 ¶ 10, 7-8 ¶ 29.] \n20. Also, the protocols implemented to ensure maximum social distancing for \nmedically vulnerable inmates, which I understand are stated in the Sheriff’s Supplemental \nDeclaration dated May 18, 2020, have been in place on or before 5:00 PM May 21, 2020, \ncontinue to be used today, and will be used for the rest of the pandemic. [See ECF 60-8 \nat 4-11 ¶¶ 15-17, 19-21]. To clarify, to the maximum extent possible given the physical \nlimitations of the WCJ and its physical layout, population level, and factors such as inmate \ngender and age, classification needs, and other classification-type special circumstances, \nDetentions Division deputies endeavor to house no more than two medically vulnerable \ninmates in a cell together unless no other alternative is available to them. \n \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66-1   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 16\n \nADDITIONAL STEPS WCSO TOOK TO COMBAT COVID-19 WITH \nRESPECT TO PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT MEASURES WITHIN \nTHE WCJ FROM MAY 11, 2020, TO PRESENT \n \n21. On May 19, 2020, after WCSO staff meetings the prior week to flesh out the \ncontours of our compliance efforts in connection with the Court’s May 11, 2020 Order, all \n“medically vulnerable” inmates were given two new N95 masks (per the WCJ’s standing \norder), all other inmates were given two cloth masks (as received from one of the two \nprivate vendors with which WCSO placed orders for them), and all other masks then in \nuse by inmates were confiscated for safety and security reasons. [See Exh. I-5]. \n22. The cloth masks are intended to be washed regularly, and the N95 masks are \nintended to be changed out every 72 hours. [See Exh. I-5]. \n23. All Detentions Division personnel were instructed to reiterate to all inmates \nthat they all must wear their masks at all times when out of their cells. [See Exh. I-5]. \n24. In addition, the protocols which the WCJ implemented to ensure a steady \nsupply of personal protective equipment for all inmates housed in the WCJ, which I \nunderstand to be set forth in the Sheriff’s Supplemental Declaration dated May 18, 2020, \nhave been in place on or before 5:00 PM May 21, 2020, continue to be utilized today, and \nwill be utilized for the rest of the pandemic. [See ECF 60-8 at 15-17 ¶¶ 27-28]. \nADDITIONAL STEPS WCSO TOOK TO COMBAT COVID-19 WITH \nRESPECT TO INMATE SANITATION MEASURES WITHIN THE WCJ \nFROM MAY 11, 2020, TO PRESENT \n \n25. On May 15, 2020, after WCSO staff meetings earlier in the week to flesh out \nthe contours of our compliance efforts in connection with the Court’s May 11, 2020 Order, \nB&G delivered fifty (50) additional spray bottles filled with HALT to the WCJ to supplement \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66-1   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 16\n \nthe HALT spray bottles already present in the housing units, with the intent to ensure four \n(4) bottles in each unit to increase inmates’ ability to clean common areas, toilets, sinks, \ndoor handles, and other commonly used areas in the WCJ. [See Exh. I-6]. \n26. On May 18, 2020, Detentions Division personnel were notified that enhanced \ncleaning was synonymous with the B&G taping project identified above, given parameters \nfor physical locations of medically vulnerable inmates when out of their cells are clearly \nmarked and the areas to sanitize consequently being better ascertained. [See Exh. I-3]. \n27. The inmates who “are unable to” sanitize “as a result of a medical or mental \nhealth condition” include inmates identified as medically vulnerable. If the inmates who \nare out refuse to sanitize as directed to by the Detentions Divisions deputy or are unable \nto do so as a result of a medical or mental health condition, the Detentions Divisions \ndeputy assumes this duty once the inmates are locked down to ensure sanitization \noccurs, by prior to “medically vulnerable” inmates entering any common area, spraying \nHALT disinfectant spray on all surfaces in the common area open for use by “medically \nvulnerable” inmates allowing 10 minutes of contact time for disinfection to occur before \n“medically vulnerable” inmates enter, and the deputy must pay special attention to areas \nto be used by medically vulnerable inmates. [See ECF 60-8 at 11-12 ¶ 23]. \n28. In addition, the other protocols which the WCJ implemented in connection with \nenhanced sanitation for medically vulnerable inmates, which I understand to be set forth \nin the Sheriff’s Supplemental Declaration dated May 18, 2020, have been in place on or \nbefore 5:00 PM May 21, 2020, continue to be utilized today, and will be utilized for the \nrest of the pandemic. [See ECF 60-8 at 11-15 ¶¶ 23-25]. \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66-1   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 16\n \nADDITIONAL STEPS WCSO TOOK TO COMBAT COVID-19 WITH RESPECT TO \nFOOD SERVICE MEASURES WITHIN THE WCJ FROM MAY 11, 2020, TO PRESENT \n \n29. On May 11, 2020, B&G increased the WCJ garbage schedule to twice weekly, \ndue to continued use of Styrofoam trays and not plastic trays. The disposal needs of the \nWCJ have increased 200% due to Aramark’s COVID-19 response. \n30. Also, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Aramark personnel who \nwork at WCJ have been required to wear masks and submit to temperature screenings \nto the same extent as Detentions Division personnel. \nRECENT TESTING DATA AS TO COVID-19-RELATED STATUS OF WCJ INMATES \n \n31. Further, it is important to provide the Court with additional context to show the \nefficacy of the WCSO’s extensive and comprehensive measures at the WCJ to slow, stop, \ncombat, and further guard against any additional spread of COVID-19 in the WCJ. \n32. On May 28, 2020, only four inmates were on COVID-19 medical isolation (two \nconfirmed positive and two suspected positive), and no housing units were on quarantine. \n33. Even so, the WCSO, apart from this lawsuit, believed it prudent to make as \nmany efforts as possible to get as many COVID-19 testing kits as possible which delivered \nas rapid of results as possible. Such efforts included several contacts with TKHC, WCHD, \nCDOC, and CDPHE in April 2020 and May 2020 to attempt to obtain tests. \n34. However, for reasons beyond the WCSO’s control as to which the WCSO \ndeclines to speculate, rapid-result COVID-19 testing kits were not available to the WCSO \nuntil the start of June 2020. Up until the start of June 2020, the WCSO was only able to \nobtain 130 COVID-19 testing kits which took several days to return results, so the WCSO \ncould not obtain the number of any type of test kit needed to test all inmates yet ensure \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66-1   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of\n 16\n \nongoing testing for new intakes. After analyzing the issue from all applicable angles, the \nWCSO determined, in consultation with appropriate medical and public health experts, \nthat prudence dictated the use of the testing kits which it was able to obtain only on \ninmates who were suspected positive for COVID-19 or confirmed positive for COVID-19 \nto conserve supplies, until rapid testing was more widely available. It was not until WCSO \ncommand staff learned testing of asymptomatic people in the community would occur that \nthe WCSO was able to request test kits directly from the state of Colorado. \n35. After more than two months of attempting to obtain a sufficient supply of testing \nkits for COVID-19, the WCJ finally obtained, during the first week of June 2020, a batch \nof testing kits in a number sufficient to test every inmate then housed within the WCJ and \nensure continued testing of new after more than fourteen consecutive days in intake. \n36. From June 3-4, 2020, the WCJ administered a COVID-19 testing kit to 392 of \n396 inmates then housed in WCJ general population housing units (four inmates willfully \nrefused the test due to what are believed to be mental health issues on the part of all \nfour), with plans to wait to test the inmates then within intake/transition units until they had \nbeen in intake for the prescribed amount of time (on advice of WCHD). \n37. The test results were returned to the WCJ on Monday, June 8, 2020. Those \nresults revealed: more than 94% of the inmates then housed in general population units \nwithin the WCJ tested negative for COVID-19, including Plaintiff Jesus Martinez (the only \nnamed Plaintiff housed in the WCJ at the time of the tests); both of the inmates already \non COVID-19 isolation protocol continued to test positive for COVID-19, meaning they \nhad to remain on medical isolation; 23 other inmates tested positive for COVID-19; these \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66-1   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of\n 16\n \ninmates were all male (technically, one was female, but she was released from custody \nbefore results came in); four of these inmates were part of the inmate population identified \nas “medically vulnerable”; these inmates were spread out amongst almost all general \npopulation housing units in the WCJ, which have essentially maintained their “family unit” \nstatus since early April 2020 with its accompanying limitation on inmate movement; these \ninmates were spread out amongst all classification levels in the WCJ; and all 23 “other \ninmates” who tested positive were asymptomatic. \n38.  On learning this information the WCSO swiftly took the following precautions, \nalso on Monday June 8, 2020: re-instituted total lockdown for the entire WCJ indefinitely, \npending another round of testing on June 22, as the total lockdown which was in place \nthe entire month of April 2020 had been slightly lifted; removed the inmates who tested \npositive from their general population units and placed them into medical isolation units, \npursuant to the existing protocols which have been identified for the Court previously [see \nECF 26-1, ECF 60-8]; placed on quarantine all housing units from which inmates who \ntested positive were taken, pursuant to the existing protocols which have been identified \nfor the Court previously [see ECF 26-1, ECF 60-8]; began developing plans to have \nadditional staff of the WCJ’s food services vendor assume more duties relating to food \nservice, and to have female inmates and deputies assume duties relating to laundry; and \ncalendared June 22, 2020, as the next date to test every single inmate in WCJ general \npopulation given both the existence of the renewed lockdown and the quarantine protocol \nfor all units which had inmates test positive. \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66-1   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of\n 16\n \n39. On advice from WCHD, the WCSO has developed the following plan to test \ninmates in the intake/transition units for COVID-19: (a) arrestees will be put into an intake \nunit when booked in as inmates; (b) when another empty unit is available after undergoing \nsanitization, such inmates will be moved from intake to a transition unit where they will be \nobserved for symptoms for fourteen days; (c) on the 12th day of observation, the inmates \nin the transition unit will be administered a COVID-19 test; (d) when the test comes back \non the 14th or 15th day, inmates who test negative will be housed in a general population \nunit, and inmates who test positive will be housed in a medical isolation unit. \n40. It is also important to note the following with respect to testing: (a) due to the \ninevitable time delay between administering the test and obtaining results, testing only \ngives the WCSO a snapshot in time of the WCJ, and because of this delay the WCSO \ncannot use it to manage WCJ population in real time but is constantly reacting; (b) there \nis no known way to identify asymptomatic individuals, and as such there was no feasible \nway the WCSO could have known these 23 inmates had COVID-19; and (c) because of \nsporadic presentation of positive test results throughout the WCJ, there is no way to track \nwho may have had contact with positive cases, necessitating the lockdown. \n41. Finally, it is very important to note the many specific and concrete reasons \nwhy testing every single inmate every single day cannot be accomplished and why the \nWCSO is doing its best: (a) testing the WCJ daily would require approximately 500 tests \neach day, or 15,000 tests for the month of June alone, and the WCSO is unable to acquire \nthis extreme volume of tests; (b) since test results are not instant and take two days or \nmore to yield results, we would still be reacting and there is no way to manage COVID-\n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66-1   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of\n 16\n \n19 in real time with any type of test; (c) on average, the WCJ experiences an estimated \n15-30 releases per day and an estimated 15-30 new bookings per day, yet in order for an \ninmate to be considered to have acquired COVID-19 at the WCJ, they must be physically \npresent within the WCJ for more than fourteen days, so the WCSO cannot obtain an \naccurate picture of the outbreak as it pertains to the WCJ; (d) some inmates reoffend and \nare re-booked in the WCJ multiple times in a short timeframe, and the WCSO could thus \nbe expending multiple tests on one person who is completely asymptomatic; (e) WCSO \npersonnel are trying to run a jail as safely and effectively as possible, they are not \nepidemiologists (and for that matter neither is Plaintiffs’ expert witness); (f) WCHD only \ncounseled WCSO to perform initial source testing and monitor for symptoms and to have \na plan to test new intakes, and daily or even weekly tests were not advised to occur by \nWCHD; (g) given it took two days to test the entirety of WCJ’s general population, WCSO \nsimply does not have the personnel to perform daily tests given its current staffing matrix; \nand (h) most importantly, to the knowledge of the Sheriff and all WCSO personnel, no \ncorrectional facility in Colorado is testing its whole population for COVID-19 daily, yet the \nWCJ is the only jail in Colorado in the knowledge of the Sheriff and the WCSO to test all \nof its general population inmates at one time during one continuous testing administration. \nADDITIONAL CHALLENGES WCSO FACES IN CONNECTION WITH COMBATING \nCOVID-19 WITH RESPECT TO INMATE POPULATION INCREASES OUTSIDE \nWCSO CONTROL WITHIN THE WCJ FROM MAY 18, 2020, TO PRESENT \n \n42. From May 18, 2020, to June 9, 2020, an average of 24 new arrestees were \nbooked into the WCJ daily without a correspondingly equal decrease in the number of \ninmates which were subject to release. \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66-1   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of\n 16\n \n43. On June 11, 2020, the WCJ reached a total of 507 inmates, 51 of which were \nbeing held for CDOC. \n44. As of June 11, 2020, all WCJ housing units are inmate-occupied, yet even \nthough WCJ inmate numbers are lower than at the start of the pandemic, the WCSO has \nmany more personnel working daily to staff units than the start of the pandemic. \n45. I understand the Court already is aware of the Sheriff’s Declaration submitted \non April 13, 2020, in this case, which detailed for the Court the limits on the physical plant \nof the WCJ given the statutory and state court judicial requirements under which the \nSheriff and his command staff and deputies labor to do their best to keep inmates safe. \n46. I also understand the Court is aware of the Sheriff’s Declaration concerning \nthe fact the Sheriff does not possess any legal authority to modify or revoke these pretrial \ndetainees’ bonds which are set by the state court judge presiding over their individual \ncases, and the fact the Sheriff possesses no legal authority to permit any of these inmates \nto serve their pretrial period at home or any other detention facility other than the WCJ as \nany such decision would have to be made by the state court judge. \n47. Despite these limitations which are a necessary consequence of Colorado’s \nstate court judicial system and criminal justice statutory regime, the WCJ has continued \nto work to attempt to single-cell inmates who are medically vulnerable as defined by the \nCourt (as well as other inmates if possible), wherever and whenever possible while still \nmaintaining best practices for anti-transmission of communicable disease and addressing \nall of the custody issues, classification issues, and other specific issues which must be \ntaken into consideration in any housing placement of all inmates in the WCJ. \n14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66-1   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of\n 16\n \n48. The situation as it existed on April 24, 2020, as detailed in my Supplemental \nDeclaration, is particularly relevant in light of the average housing unit space as detailed \nabove, which even given the passage of almost seven more weeks still is not enough to \nmaintain six feet of distance between all inmates at all times within the WCJ. \n49. As of June 11, 2020, the WCJ houses 507 inmates. As previously articulated, \nthe Sheriff lacks the legal authority to release any of the inmates currently detained. \n50. In addition, pursuant to state statute, the Sheriff must house certain classes of \ninmates who are arrested for certain offenses, resulting in the Sheriff having essentially \nno control over population increases in the WCJ and making it effectively impossible to \nsingle-cell most, if not all, of the inmates who are medically vulnerable as defined by the \nCourt (whether in the intake housing units or in general population) given all of the factors \nfor which the Sheriff must account and the Court allowed an accounting. \n51. The WCSO and the WCJ have done and continue to do what we are able to \ndo to address all issues related to COVID-19 including inmate separation within the \nconfines of the physical plant of the WCJ and the number of inmates at the WCJ. The \nWCSO and the WCJ continue to work on these issues every day seeking guidance from \nall available sources and continuing to refine all applicable policies and protocols based \non any new guidance disseminated from any of the many sources relied upon. Every day \nduring this pandemic, I have worked extremely hard to ensure to the best of my ability all \ninmates at the WCJ, all staff who work there, and all individuals who interact at the WCJ \nremain as safe as possible based on all the information I know about COVID-19 and its \ntransmission and spread. That has been the mission of the WCJ since the outbreak began \n15 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 66-1   Filed 06/11/20   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of\n 16\n \nand will continue to be as long as it continues. Finally, as before, the last thing the WCSO \ndesires is to be compelled to adopt measures which completely undermine the effective \nsteps the WCSO has taken to plan for, slow, and further guard against the spread of \nCOVID-19. \n \nI understand the statements written in this Declaration are given under penalty of \nperjury.

INTRODUCTION \n \n“These are extraordinary times.”1 COVID-19 poses an unprecedented threat to the \ncountry, our state, the Weld County community, and citizens housed in the Weld County \nJail. COVID-19 has been declared a national pandemic, President Trump has declared a \n \n1 This is how federal judges have described the current COVID-19 outbreak. See Matter \nof Extradition of Toledo Manrique, No. 19-MJ-71055 (TSH), 2020 WL 1307109, at *1 \n(N.D. Cal. Mar. 19, 2020). \n  1\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 54\n \nnational emergency, and the Governor has issued a proclamation declaring a disaster in \nthe State of Colorado. More than 823,000 people across the globe have been infected and \nthe disease has caused more than 40,500 deaths.  \nApproximately 575 people, at least forty-four of whom are over the age of fifty-\nfive, are incarcerated in Weld County living in close quarters where all aspects of daily \nlife, including healthcare and food service, take place in the same small space. \nCorrectional settings pose a particular risk of spreading the virus, with catastrophic \nconsequences not just to the detainees and staff, but also to their communities and the \nhospitals that serve them. Each day, dozens of staff must come and go from the Weld \nCounty Jail, potentially carrying with them the novel coronavirus for days, even weeks, \nwithout ever showing symptoms. There have already been at least eight confirmed cases \nof COVID-19 among inmates at the Weld County Jail and Weld County Jail staff. Those \nwho are incarcerated and displaying obvious symptoms of COVID-19 are not being \ntested. The risk of rapid and pervasive infection is high.2 And Plaintiffs, the men and \nwomen in Weld County Jail custody who have underlying serious medical conditions and \nindividuals over 55 years of age, face an even greater risk of severe illness and death \nfrom the ongoing outbreak.  \n \n2 The speed and breadth of this problem for incarcerated people is stark. At the peak of \nthe outbreak in Wuhan, China — the province where COVID-19 originated — over half \nof all reported COVID-19 cases were incarcerated people. On Rikers Island, the rate of \ninfection among incarcerated people is over seven times the rate of infection in New \nYork City generally, and 25 times higher than the rate in Wuhan, China. This crisis \nrecalls the 1918 flu pandemic, in which a cluster of infections at San Quentin Prison in \nCalifornia became “one of the primary foci” of a worldwide epidemic that killed between \n20 million and 100 million people. See Niyi Awofeso, Prisons Show Prophylaxis for \nClose Contacts May Indeed Help in Next Flu Pandemic, 329 BMJ 173, 173 (2004); Gina \nKolata, Flu: The Story Of The Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 And The Search For \nThe Virus That Caused It 5 (2011). \n  2\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 54\n \nDefendant Sheriff Steven Reams is the person with the constitutional \nresponsibility to ensure that inmates at the Weld County Jail are safe. But instead of \nproactively taking steps to prevent a crisis in his facility, Defendant has been a COVID-\n19-denier from the outset of the crisis in direct contravention of science, data, and \ncommon sense.3 Not only has Defendant refused to lead any efforts to ensure physical \ndistancing within the Weld County Jail, he also discouraged local district attorneys and \njudges from making efforts to decrease the Weld County jail population and assured them \nhe has things under control in his jail and was ready to manage COVID-19. Not only are \nthings not under control at the Weld County Jail, they are spiraling out of control. The \nnumber of infected inmates and staff is rising precipitously. There are reports that one \nrecently released inmate, who contracted COVID-19 in the facility, has died. The \nsituation is dire. \nThe Weld County Jail has been an outlier in its lax and inadequate response to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. While other jails throughout Colorado have depopulated their jails \nby 50% or more to allow for adequate physical distancing among inmates, Weld County \nis still housing inmates in cells with up to nine inmates within a few feet of one another. \nUntil just days ago, inmates ate and recreated shoulder-to-shoulder, with no efforts at \nphysical distancing, even as several inmates showed symptoms consistent with COVID-\n19.  Now, with confirmed cases, inmates are on lockdown twenty-three hours per day \nwith some non-symptomatic inmates locked in cells with sick inmates. Only those who \nare very sick are quarantined. The rest are left in packed cells to spread the virus amongst \n \n3 @SteveReamsForWeldCountySheriff, Facebook (Mar. 24, 2020 1:49 PM), \nhttps://www.facebook.com/SteveReamsForWeldCountySheriff/posts/1524469844396739\n?__tn__=-R \n  3\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 54\n \nthemselves and to others. Inmates still share common toilets and do not have regular \naccess to hand soap, which has allowed the disease to be pollinated from a single vector \nto every single cell in the jail (where, again, multiple individuals are confined for twenty-\nthree hours a day within feet of one another). Defendant has refused to provide basic \nhygiene products to inmates and has actively denied them from protecting themselves, \nand others, by wearing masks. \n“The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to [COVID-19].”4 The \nclear medical consensus is that to avoid exposure certain steps must be taken: physical \ndistancing, wearing a facemask, testing for the virus, and ensuring that surfaces are \nadequately sanitized. Defendant has the mechanisms available to ensure that inmates at \nthe Weld County Jail are not exposed to the virus. But he has instead chosen to actively \nreject the risk to inmates at the outset and has only recently taken mild action in response \nto a full-blown crisis. \nEvery day, more and more courts are holding that COVID-19 presents serious \nhealth risks to inmates, guards, and the community at large. See, e.g., Jimenez v. Wolf, \nNo. 18-10225-MLW (D. Mass.

This growing drumbeat in the federal courts makes clear that this pandemic \nis the paradigmatic situation in which decisive emergency relief from our third branch of \ngovernment is necessary and just. \nTo ensure that these vulnerable prisoners are not forced to die because of \nDefendant’s inaction, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court provisionally certify \nPlaintiffs’ proposed class, grant Plaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order, and \norder the below-outlined relief. The public interest in avoiding devastation in Weld \nCounty, along with the protections afforded to detainees by the United States \nConstitution, demands these actions be taken swiftly in these unprecedented times.  \n2. REQUEST FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiffs ask that this Court order Defendant to implement a plan that will rectify \nthe violation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights and save their lives. This plan must ensure \n  5\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 54\n \nthat Plaintiffs are protected from the threat of COVID-19 exposure by compliance with \npublic health guidelines. Important parts of this plan should include the following:  \n1.  Defendant should be required to physically distance all inmates from one another and \nstaff within the Weld County Jail, which necessitates at least six feet of distance \nbetween individuals at all times;  \n2.  Defendant should be required to, on a daily basis, thoroughly and professionally \ndisinfect and sanitize the Weld County Jail.  \n3.  Defendant must provide hygiene supplies, including supplies to wash hands and \ndisinfect common areas, to inmates at all times and free of charge; \n4.  Defendant must provide personal protection equipment, including but not limited to \nmasks, to all staff members and inmates; \n5.  Defendant must take particularly heightened precautions with respect to food \nhandling and delivery, such as ensuring that people who come into contact with food \nare not displaying any potential symptoms of COVID-19, have not recently been in \ncontact with people displaying potential symptoms of COVID-19, and people who \ncome into contact with food wear appropriate personal protective at all times when in \ncontact with food (including but not limited to appropriate masks and gloves); \n6.  Defendant must implement appropriate policies and protocols to identify inmates who \nare possibly carrying COVID-19 and quarantine those inmates from other individuals; \nand \n7.  Defendant must provide accurate, up-to-date educational and informational materials \nregarding sanitation and prevention of COVID-19, the status of how COVID-19 is \n  6\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 54\n \naffecting the facility including the number of infected inmates and staff, and daily \naccess to news reports regarding COVID-19. \nShould Defendant not be able to ensure that Plaintiffs are protected from COVID-\n19 exposure through physical distancing, Plaintiffs alternatively ask this Court to order \nthe transfer of a sufficient number of inmates to electronic home monitoring to allow for \nappropriate physical distancing within the Weld County Jail. \n3. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n \n3.1 The COVID-19 outbreak has created a global health emergency.  \n \nWe are living in the midst of an extreme worldwide health emergency caused by \nthe rapid spread of COVID-19. The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 \nto be a global pandemic.5 On March 10, 2020, Governor Jared Polis issued a \nproclamation declaring a disaster in the State of Colorado.6 On March 13, 2020, President \nTrump declared a national emergency.7 \nThe number of known COVID-19 infections is increasing daily. As of April 6, \n2020, there were more than 1,210,956 reported COVID-19 cases throughout the world \n \n5 Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) situation reports, World Health Organization, \nhttps://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports (last \nvisited Apr. 5, 2020). \n6 Executive Order Declaring Emergency Due to the Presence of Coronavirus Disease \n2019 in Colorado (March 10, 2020), available at \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1szJfU9WF36-lCVgRhXMAnJdlQyTSG83e/view. \n7 Proclamation on Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus \nDisease (COVID-19) Outbreak (Mar. 13, 2020), available at \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidentialactions/proclamation-declaring-national-\nemergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19- outbreak/ (last visited Apr. \n3, 2020). \n  7\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 54\n \nwith more than 67,500 deaths from the virus.8 In the United States alone, there are over \n186,000 confirmed cases and over 3,600 deaths.9  \nThe number of COVID-19 cases in the United States and Colorado is expected to \ncontinue its exponential growth. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n(“CDC”) projects that without swift and effective public health interventions, over 200 \nmillion people in the U.S. could be infected with COVID-19 over the course of the \nepidemic, with as many as 1.7 million deaths.10 \nColorado is considered a new hot spot for spread of the disease, with over 5,000 \nconfirmed cases in Colorado, nearly 1,000 hospitalizations and 150 confirmed deaths.11  \nAs of April 2, it was reported that Colorado’s COVID-19 death rate was rising faster than \nany other state.12 Governor Polis believes that the actual number of cases is likely four to \nten times higher than reported because of a lack of widespread testing.13 \n \n8 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report – 72, World Health \nOrganization (April 3, 2020), available at https://www.who.int/docs/default-\nsource/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200401-sitrep-72-covid-\n19.pdf?sfvrsn=3dd8971b_2 (last visited Apr. 3, 2020). \n9 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cases in U.S., Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-\ninus.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-\nncov%2Fcasesin-us.html (last visited Apr. 3, 2020). \n10 Sheri Fink, Worst-Case Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths, The New York Times, \n(Mar. 13, 2020), available at https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/coronavirus-\ndeaths-estimate.html (last visited Apr. 3, 2020). \n11 See COVID-19 Case Data, COLORADO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH & \nENVIRONMENT, https://covid19.colorado.gov/case-data (last visited Apr. 7, 2020). \n12 See Toby Keith, Governor says Colorado’s COVID-19 death rate is rising faster than \nany other state, asks for help from vice president, KKTV 11, \nhttps://www.kktv.com/content/news/Governor-says-Colorados--569337551.html.  \n13 Sam Tabachnik, Between 13,000 and 33,000 Coloradans could have coronavirus right \nnow, health officials estimate, DENVER POST, \nhttps://www.denverpost.com/2020/04/02/coronavirus-colorado-covid-cases-surge-polis/. \n  8\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 54\n \nCOVID-19 is a particularly contagious disease. A recent study showed that the \nvirus can survive for up to three hours in the air, four hours on a copper surface, up to \ntwenty-four hours on cardboard, and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless \nsteel.14 Indeed, a new study of an early cluster of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China \nrevealed the dangers of indirect transmission resulting from infected people \ncontaminating common surfaces—in the study, it was a communal mall bathroom.15 \nControlling the spread of COVID-19 is made even more difficult because of the \nprominence of asymptomatic transmission—people who are contagious but who exhibit \nno symptoms, rendering ineffective any screening tools dependent on identifying disease \nsymptoms.16 \nThere is no known vaccine or cure for COVID-19. No one is immune.

Medical providers and medical \nfacilities are in peril of becoming completely overwhelmed and beyond capacity to \nprovide this type of intensive care as COVID-19 continues to spread. \nEven for those who survive COVID-19, recent clinical evidence indicates that, in \npersons who suffer severe symptoms, the virus may also cause damage to organs such as \nthe heart, the liver, and the kidneys, as well as to organ systems such as the blood and the \nimmune system. This damage is so extensive and severe that it may be enduring. Among \nother things, patients who suffer severe symptoms from COVID-19 end up with damage \nto the walls and air sacs of their lungs, leaving debris in the lungs and causing the walls \nof lung capillaries to thicken so that they are less able to transfer oxygen going forward. \nIndeed studies of some recovered patients in China and Hong Kong indicate a declined \nlung function of 20% to 30% after recovery.27  \n3.2 Incarcerated individuals are particularly vulnerable to infection from \nCOVID-19. \n \n26 Sarah, Kliff, et al., There Aren’t Enough Ventilators to Cope With the Coronavirus, \nTHE NEW YORK TIMES (March 26, 2020), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/business/coronavirus-ventilator-shortage.html. \n27 Tianbing Wang, et al., Comorbidities and Multi-Organ Injuries in the Treatment of \nCOVID-19, 395 Lancet 10228 (2020), available at \nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140- 6736(20)30558-4/fulltext; \nGeorge Washington University Hospital, GW Hospital Uses Innovative VR Technology \nto Assess Its First COVID-19 Patient, \nhttps://www.gwhospital.com/resources/podcasts/covid19-vr-technology (last visited Apr. \n3, 2020). \n  12\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 54\n \n \n  The overwhelming consensus of public health authorities and experts—including \ndoctors contracted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security—is that inmates have a \nparticular vulnerability to COVID-19, and the same physical distancing being employed \nin the community is necessary to avert catastrophic consequences.28 And, this is evident \nfrom real world examples.

Id.; see also Exhibit 2, Expert Report of Carlos Franco-Paredes, \nM.D., M.P.H. \nPeople incarcerated in jails and prisons are more susceptible to acquiring and \nexperiencing complications from infectious diseases than the population in the \ncommunity.32 This is because people in jails are more likely than people in the \ncommunity to have chronic underlying health conditions, including diabetes, heart \ndisease, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, and lower immune systems from \nHIV.

Prison health units are not equipped with sufficient emergency medical \nequipment, such as oxygen tanks, nasal cannulae, and oxygen face masks, to respond to \nan outbreak of patients with respiratory distress. For these reasons, among others, experts \nhave warned that, “widespread community transmission of COVID-19 within a \ncorrectional institution is likely to result in a disproportionately high COVID-19 \nmortality rate.”34 Jails rely on outside community hospitals to provide more advanced and \nintensive medical care, and during an epidemic, this will not be possible, as those outside \nfacilities will likely be at or over capacity themselves. \nThe Weld County Jail is not a closed environment. By necessity, members of the \ncommunity, including correctional officers, medical personnel, and many others must \nenter and leave the Weld County Jail on a daily basis. Staff arrive and leave each facility \nthree times a day in large numbers.  As the COVID-19 virus spreads within the jail, staff \nas well as inmates are at heightened risk of contracting the virus and, in turn, spreading \nthe virus to others with whom they come in contact in their own homes and \nneighborhoods. \n3.3 Implementing physical distancing is the only meaningfully way to prevent \nthe harm caused by COVID-19 in the Weld County Jail and its \nsurrounding community. \n \n34 “COVID-19 in Correctional Settings: Unique Challenges and Proposed Responses” \n(March 23, 2020), https://amend.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID-in-Corrections-\nChallenges-and-Solutions1.pdf; see also “Correctional Facilities In The Shadow Of \nCOVID-19: Unique Challenges And Proposed Solutions,” Health Affairs Blog, March \n26, 2020, available at \nhttps://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200324.784502/full/ (last visited Apr. \n3, 2020). \n  15\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 54\n \n \nThe only way to prevent complications and the enormous risk of serious illness or \ndeath to medically vulnerable people is to prevent them from becoming infected. \nEveryone is at risk of transmission of COVID-19.

For weeks, Defendant cavalierly refused to take any \napparent precautions whatsoever within the facility. Defendant did not test for COVID-\n19, even after inmates began showing symptoms consistent with the virus. He \nimplemented no physical distancing. And inadequate sanitation was widespread in his \njail.

Of  the  ten  most \npopulous Colorado jails, Weld County Jail stands out as having the lowest depopulation \nrate since the start of the COVID-19 crisis and the highest jail occupancy rate.58 Unlike \nmany other Colorado sheriffs, Defendant has refused to take the public health risk or data \nseriously. \nAs a result of these failures, at least one inmate and two staff tested positive for \nCOVID-19 by no later than April 1, 2020. The infected inmate had been at the jail for \nover a year, so it is very likely that there is internal spread within the jail.

In accordance with D.C.COLO.LCivR 7.1, counsel for \nDefendant indicated that Defendant opposes the relief sought herein. \n5. ARGUMENT \n \n  28\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 29 of 54\n \nPlaintiffs are inmates in the custody of the Weld County Jail who are especially \nvulnerable to COVID-19 because of their advanced age or underlying medical conditions. \nAlthough the larger world has taken radical steps to contain this disease, Plaintiffs are \npowerless to adopt even simple protective measures. Under current conditions, it is \noverwhelmingly likely that hundreds of inmates will contract a lethal virus with no cure. \nWithout urgent action, countless inmates will become seriously ill or die within a matter \nof weeks or months. Plaintiffs are at high-risk for death should they contract COVID-19. \nPlaintiffs therefore request that the Court grant injunctive relief that will protect them \nfrom threatened exposure to COVID-19 and, consequently, a death sentence. \nCourts are empowered to grant temporary restraining orders and preliminary \ninjunctions in class actions, the same as in other actions. See William W. Schwarzer, A. \nWallace Tashima & James M. Wagstaffe, § 10:773 (nat’l ed. 2009); accord Price v. City \nof Stockton, 390 F.3d 1105, 1117-18 (9th Cir. 2004) (preliminary injunction may extend \nbeyond named plaintiffs). This is so regardless of whether the class has yet been certified. \nSimer v. Rios, 661 F2d 655, 658 (7th Cir. 1981) (granting temporary restraining order \nwithin days of action’s filing); see also Yue v. Conseco Life Ins. Co., 282 F.R.D. 469, 475 \n(C.D. Cal. 2012) (holding that, even if a party simultaneously moves for class \ncertification and preliminary injunction, there is no requirement to show irreparable \ninjury and success on merits to prevail on class certification). \nA plaintiff seeking interim injunctive relief “must establish that he is likely to \nsucceed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in \nthe public interest.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008); see also \n  29\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 30 of 54\n \nPlanned Parenthood Ass’n of Utah v. Herbert, 828 F.3d 1245, 1252 (10th Cir. 2016). \n“[W]here the moving party has established that the three ‘harm’ factors tip decidedly in \nits favor, the ‘probability of success’ requirement is relaxed[.]” Star Fuel Marts, LLC v. \nSam’s East, Inc., 362 F.3d 639, 652-53 (10th Cir. 2004). \nOnce a plaintiff demonstrates entitlement to interim relief, courts have broad \npower to fashion equitable remedies to address constitutional violations in prisons. Hutto \nv. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 687 n.9 (1978). And although courts must “be sensitive to the \nState’s interest[s]” in imprisonment, courts “must not shrink from their obligation to \nenforce the constitutional rights of all persons, including prisoners [and] . . . may not \nallow constitutional violations to continue simply because a remedy would involve \nintrusion into the realm of prison administration.” Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 511 \n(2011); Plata v. Brown, 2013 WL 3200587, *8 (N.D. Cal., June 24, 2013) (directing \nremoval of prisoners at risk of contracting Valley Fever from prisons where the risk of \ncontracting it was high). \nImmediate and unequivocal action by this Court is necessary. There is no vaccine \nor cure for COVID-19. Treatment of high-risk persons like the Plaintiffs is costly and \nresources are limited. Even those successfully treated have life-long damage to their \nlungs. As such, the only way to protect against the imminent risk of substantial harm and \npossible death of inmates who are most vulnerable to the virus—people with serious \nunderlying medical conditions, and people over the age of 55—is to immediately require \nphysical distancing of ALL inmates before they contract the virus.  \nInjunctive relief is necessary because the danger here, vulnerable people \ncondemned to prolonged illness and potential death, is the quintessential irreparable \n  30\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 31 of 54\n \nharm. Edmisten v. Werholtz, 287 F. App’x 728, 732-35 (10th Cir. 2008) (holding that \nevidence that health will “deteriorate irreparably” absent relief is sufficient to support \nissuance of injunctive relief); see also Jones’El v. Berge, 164 F. Supp. 2d 1096 (W.D. \nWisc. 2001) (“[P]ain, suffering and the risk of death constitute ‘irreparable harm’ \nsufficient to support a preliminary injunction in prison cases.”). There is also an \noverwhelming public interest in limiting the spread of COVID-19, both to minimize \nfurther infections and to reduce strain on overwhelmed health systems. And, in light of \nthe global COVID-19 pandemic, the balance of equities weighs heavily in favor of the \nvulnerable inmates, who must be allowed to physically distance, and against Defendant’s \ninterest in indefinitely confining the Plaintiffs in life-threatening conditions. This Court \nshould order that physical distancing be implemented at the Weld County Jail. \n5.1 Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits.  \n \nPlaintiffs are likely to establish that their conditions of confinement place them at \nsubstantial risk of harm from COVID-19, in violation of their Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendment rights, and that Defendant is being deliberately indifferent to their obvious \nand serious medical needs. \n5.1(a) Plaintiffs are being held under unconstitutional conditions of \nconfinement at the Weld County Jail. \n \nPlaintiffs are likely to establish that their conditions of confinement within the \nWeld County Jail custody render them at substantial risk of contracting COVID-19 and \nsuffering prolonged injury and possible death. The Supreme Court has long held that \nwhen state officials “strip [inmates] of virtually every means of self-protection and \nforeclose[] their access to outside aid, [they] are not free to let the state of nature take its \ncourse.” Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 833 (1994). State officials instead have a \n  31\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 32 of 54\n \nresponsibility under the Eighth Amendment62 to “take reasonable measures to guarantee \nthe safety of the inmates.” Id. at 832.  \n \n62 “[T]here does not exist a single ‘deliberate indifference’ standard applicable to all § \n1983 claims, whether pretrial detainees or convicted prisoners bring the claim.” Abila v. \nFunk, 220 F. Supp. 3d 1121, 1181 (D.N.M. 2016). Prior to Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 \nS.Ct. 2466 (2015), the Tenth Circuit held that, pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment’s \ndue process clause, pretrial detainees are entitled to the same degree of medical care as \nconvicted inmates are under the Eighth Amendment. Craig v. Eberly, 154 F.3d 490, 495 \n(10th Cir. 1998). Kingsley, however, abrogated the Tenth Circuit’s holding in Craig, \nconcluding that Eighth Amendment culpable state of mind rules arising out of the \nprohibition of “wanton” punishment cannot be extended to pretrial detainees, who have a \nFourteenth Amendment right to be free from all punishment. 135 S.Ct. at 2475. “The \nlanguage of the two Clauses differs,” the Court reasoned, “and the nature of the claims \noften differs. And, most importantly, pretrial detainees (unlike convicted prisoners) \ncannot be punished at all . . .” Id. Because there is no requirement that a pretrial detainee \ndemonstrate the wanton infliction of pain, “a pretrial detainee can prevail by providing \nonly objective evidence that the challenged governmental action is not rationally related \nto a legitimate governmental objective or that it is excessive in relation to that purpose.” \nId. at 2473-74 (emphasis added). Thus, “the appropriate standard for a pretrial detainee’s \nexcessive force claim is solely an objective one.” Id. at 2473.  \n \nThe implications of Kingsley are by no means limited to excessive force claims. See id. at \n2473 (“The Bell Court applied [an] objective standard to evaluate a variety of prison \nconditions . . . . In doing so, it did not consider the prison officials’ subjective beliefs \nabout the policy.”) (citing Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 541-43 (1977)); Id. at \n2478 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) (confirming the Bell v. Wolfish standard for pretrial \ndetainees making inhumane conditions of confinement claims). And the objective \ndeliberate indifference standard has repeatedly been applied to conditions of confinement \nand inadequate medical care claims. See Gordon v. Cnty. of Orange, 888 F.3d 1118, 1125 \n(9th Cir. 2018) (extending Kingsley to medical care claims); Miranda v. Cty. of Lake, 900 \nF.3d 335, 352 (7th Cir. 2018) (“We thus conclude, along with the Ninth and Second \nCircuits, that medical-care claims brought by pretrial detainees under the Fourteenth \nAmendment are subject only to the objective unreasonableness inquiry identified in \nKingsley”); Bruno v. City of Schenectady, 727 Fed. Appx. 717, 2018 WL 1357377, at *2-\n*3 (2d Cir. 2018) (unpublished) (expressly applying an objective standard to a claim of \ndeliberate indifference to a serious medical condition); Darnell v. Pineiro, 849 F.3d 17, \n35 (2d Cir. 2017) (extending Kingsley to conditions of confinement claims by pretrial \ndetainees pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment and overruling its previous decisions \napplying the subjective standard to an inadequate medical care claim by a pretrial \ndetainee); see also Richmond v. Huq, 885 F.3d 928, 938 n.3 (6th Cir. 2018) (not applying \nKingsley, which neither party raised, but recognizing the “shift in Fourteenth Amendment \ndeliberate indifference jurisprudence [that] calls into serious doubt whether [the plaintiff] \n \n  32\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 33 of 54\n \nIn Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25 (1993), the Supreme Court held that the \nEighth Amendment forbids deliberate indifference to conditions that “pose an \nunreasonable risk of serious damage to . . . future health.” Id. at 35. Helling addressed \nexposure to secondhand smoke, but in doing so recognized that “deliberate indifference \nto the exposure of inmates to a serious, communicable disease” would similarly violate \nthe Eighth Amendment, even if a prisoner currently shows no serious symptoms. Id. at \n33. To amount to the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment: (1) prison conditions \nmust pose “an unreasonable risk,” (2) the risk must be of serious harm, and (3) prison \nofficials must have acted with deliberate indifference to that risk of serious harm. Id. at \n33–35. Plaintiffs easily satisfy all prongs. \n5.1(a)(1) Plaintiffs have shown a significant likelihood that they \nwill suffer an unreasonable risk of harm from COVID-19 \nif their current conditions of confinement are not abated. \n \nPlaintiffs in this case are being detained in conditions that dramatically and \nunjustifiably increase the likelihood that they will contract COVID-19 and fall seriously \nill.  \nNotably, Plaintiffs do not need to show that they are currently infected or \nsuffering “serious health problems” to show that they face a “substantial risk” of harm. \nHelling, 509 U.S. at 34. The Supreme Court squarely rejected that proposition, \n \nneed even show that the individual defendant-officials were subjectively aware of her \nserious medical conditions and nonetheless wantonly disregarded them”); cf. Castro v. \nCnty. of L.A., 833 F.3d 1060, 1070 (9th Cir. 2016) (en banc) (extending Kingsley to \nfailure to protect claims by pretrial detainees pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment). In \nany event, as herein, pretrial Plaintiffs and proposed class members face no hurdle in \nestablishing that Defendant knew of the risk of COVID-19 and that he recklessly \ndisregarded that risk. By meeting their burden under the Eighth Amendment, pretrial \nPlaintiffs and proposed class members have, by definition, met their burden under the \nFourteenth Amendment, which governs their claims. \n  33\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 34 of 54\n \nconcluding that “[w]e have great difficulty agreeing that prison authorities may not be \ndeliberately indifferent to an inmate’s current health problems but may ignore a condition \nof confinement that is sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering \nthe next week or month or year.” Id. at 33. The Court went on: “Nor can we hold that \nprison officials may be deliberately indifferent to the exposure of inmates to a serious, \ncommunicable disease on the ground that the complaining inmate shows no serious \ncurrent symptoms.” Id. \nInmates simply cannot maintain proper physical distancing as they are currently \nconfined in the Weld County Jail, whether housed with large numbers of people, in a \nsmall cell with fewer people in close proximity, or even in a two-person cell. Malam v. \nAdducci, No. 20-10829, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59407, at *26 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 5, 2020) \n(“In the face of a deadly pandemic with no vaccine, no cure, limited testing capacity, and \nthe ability to spread quickly through asymptomatic human vectors, a ‘generalized \nrisk’ is a ‘substantial risk’ of catching the COVID-19 virus for any group of human \nbeings in highly confined conditions[.]”). Inmates share their dayrooms, showers, and \ntoilets, and must rely on multiple staff to prepare and deliver their meals and medications. \nComm. for Pub. Counsel Servs. v. Chief Justice of the Trial Court, No. SJC-12926, 2020 \nMass. LEXIS 191, at *19 (Apr. 3, 2020) (“The district attorneys of the northern, \nnorthwestern, Suffolk, and Berkshire districts agree with the petitioners that the risk of \nthis pandemic is an unprecedented, deadly threat to incarcerated individuals, correctional \nofficers, and civilian staff, and that extraordinary action is needed to address this rapidly-\ngrowing public health emergency expeditiously.”). Plaintiffs are at the mercy of security \n  34\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 35 of 54\n \nand medical staff, who may carry the virus without showing symptoms, and who often \nare not able to take even simple precautions like wearing disposable gloves. \nPlaintiffs are themselves at an especially high risk of harm from the virus due to \nthe high rates of chronic, and other, health conditions. Elderly inmates and those with \nunderlying medical conditions typically experience COVID-19 symptoms more severely \nand are far more likely to develop complications as a result of the virus. Inmates over the \nage of 55 without any underlying medical conditions face a 1.3–8% mortality rate. And \nas noted above, vulnerable inmates who suffer from cardiovascular disease face a 13.2% \nmortality rate, hypertensive inmates face an 8.4% mortality rate, and inmates with \nchronic respiratory disease face an 8.0% mortality rate. Additionally, individuals with \ncertain conditions, such as those that affect the immune system, are also more likely to \ncontract the disease and, also, more likely to die if exposed. And history teaches that \nwhen an epidemic occurs nationally, people in custody experience a disproportionately \nhigh number of cases. At least according to data from the BOP, history is repeating itself \n(or worse) with this virus. \nCOVID-19 is already in the Weld County Jail. Other district courts have granted \nTROs requiring the implementation of physical distancing requirements before positive \nCOVID-19 tests in the respective facilities. Central District of California Judge Hatter \ngranted a TRO on March 27, 2020, explaining that: \nAs the Court writes this order, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases \nin the United States has already exceeded the number of confirmed cases \nin every other country on this planet. Indeed, all of the experts and \npolitical leaders agree that the number of confirmed cases in the United \nStates will only increase in the days and weeks ahead. The number of \ncases in the United States has yet to peak. \n \n  35\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 36 of 54\n \nTemporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause at 10, Docket No. 32, Castillo v. \nBarr, No. 20-cv-605 (TJH) (C.D. Cal. March 27, 2020). Just a day earlier, on March 26, \n2020, Southern District of New York Judge Torres recognized that “[t]he spread of \nCOVID-19 is measured in a matter of a single day — not weeks, months, or years” and \ngranted a TRO requiring the immediate release of ten people to ensure that they could \nadequately physically distance. See Basank, 2020 WL 1481503, at *5; see also Order at \n1–2, United States v. Harris, Docket No. 35, No. 19-cr-356 (RDM) (D.D.C. March 26, \n2020) (granting motion for emergency release from custody in light of the risks of \nCOVID-19); Minute Order, United States v. Jaffee, 19-cr-88 (RDM) (D.D.C. March 26, \n2020) (same). On March 23, 2020, a panel of Ninth Circuit judges granted emergency \nrelief and ordered a detained person released “[i]n light of the rapidly escalating public \nhealth crisis.” Xochihua-Jaimes v. Barr, 18-71460, Doc. No. 53 (9th Cir. Mar. 23, 2020) \n(unpublished). \nSince these earlier63 cases, federal courts across the country have granted \ntemporary restraining orders brought on behalf of vulnerable individuals in custody. See, \ne.g., Thakker, No. 20 C 0480, Dkt. 47; Flores, et al. v. Barr, et al., No. 85 C 4544, Dkt. \n740 (Mar. 28, 2020); Coronel, No. 20 C 2472, Dkt. 26. In Thakker, the district court \nrecognized that “the status quo of a mere few weeks ago no longer applies. Our world has \nbeen altered with lightning speed, and the results are both unprecedented and ghastly . . . . \nThe choice we now make must reflect this new reality.” Thakker, No. 20 C 0480, Dkt. 47 \nat 24. The district court found that even though the conditions in the local federal \n \n63 In the context of the spread of COVID-19, “earlier” is mere days.

(“Our Constitution and laws apply equally \nto the most vulnerable among us, particularly when matters of public health are at \nissue.”). The district court accordingly granted a temporary restraining order that aimed at \nensuring appropriate physical distancing by requiring the immediate release of 11 \nprisoners in federal custody who suffer from chronic medical conditions and, therefore, \nface a serious threat of injury or death if exposed to COVID-19. Id. at 2, 24-25. \nIn sum, the record evidence shows that Plaintiffs and proposed class members \nface a “substantial risk” of contracting COVID-19. Plaintiffs need not show, or even \nallege, that “the likely harm would occur immediately” or that the possible infection \nwould “affect all of those exposed.” Helling, 509 U.S. at 33 (citing Hutto v. Finney, 437 \nU.S. 678, 682 (1978)). Plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits \nof showing their “substantial” or “significant” risk of contracting COVID-19. \n5.1(a)(2) Plaintiffs have demonstrated that the risk of harm \nto them is serious. \n \nPlaintiffs have also substantially demonstrated that the risk of harm to them is \nserious. Put differently, the Supreme Court explained, this Court should ask “whether \nsociety considers the risk that the prisoner complains of to be so grave that it violates \ncontemporary standards of decency to expose anyone unwillingly to such a risk.” Helling, \n509 U.S. at 36. \nTo conclude that COVID-19 poses a risk of serious harm, the Court need look no \nfurther than the drastic way society has been reshaped in a matter of months.

The declarations of \nemergency from nearly every level of government is strong evidence COVID-19 is a risk \nthat society considers to be grave. In declaring a national emergency on March 13, 2020, \nPresident Trump proclaimed that “[t]he spread of COVID-19 within our Nation’s \ncommunities threatens to strain our Nation’s healthcare systems.”65 Governor Polis \nissued an Executive Order stating in explicit terms the serious danger: “The potential \nspread of COVID-19 in facilities and prisons poses a significant threat to prisoners and \nstaff who work in facilities and prisons[.]”66  \nPlaintiffs are particularly vulnerable given their COVID-19 co-morbidities. \nCOVID-19 poses a significantly heightened risk of harm to those with underlying health \nconditions and those over 55 years old.

Garlock, No. 18-cr-418 (VC), 2020 WL 1439980, at *1 \n(N.D. Cal. Mar. 25, 2020)). The New Jersey Supreme Court, in approving an order \nresulting in the release of around 1,000 people from New Jersey jails to allow for proper \nphysical distancing within the facility, described “the profound risk posed to people in \ncorrectional facilities arising from the spread of COVID19.” In the Matter of the Request \nto Commute or Suspend County Jail Sentences, Case No. 84230 (N.J. March 22, 2020). \nFinally, this Court also need look no further than the consensus among federal \ncourts that exposure to tuberculosis — a less severe disease, at least in terms of mortality \nrate67 — is a “serious harm” for Eighth Amendment purposes. See, e.g., Jeffries v. Block, \n940 F. Supp. 1509, 1514 (C.D. Cal. 1996) (citing the determination of the California \nLegislature that “tuberculosis is a serious contagious disease, which presents a serious \nrisk to inmate health”); cf. Brown v. District of Columbia, 514 F.3d 1279, 1285 (D.C. Cir. \n \n67 Studies suggest “a TB-related mortality rate of 2.1% [in the United States], which was \ncomparable to studies in Canada.” Chou-Han Lin, Tuberculosis Mortality: Patient \nCharacteristics and Causes, 14 BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES (2014). \n  39\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 40 of 54\n \n2008) (concluding, under the slightly different deliberate indifference to “serious medical \nneeds” test, that gallstones were “easily” in the “category of serious medical needs,” a \npoint conceded by the District of Columbia). Taken together, the evidence in the record, \nand evidence of which the Court can and should take judicial notice, supports the \nconclusion that COVID-19 is a serious harm. \n5.1(a)(3) Defendant knows of, and has disregarded, a \nsignificant risk to Plaintiffs health and safety. \n \nTo succeed on the second prong of the Eighth Amendment test, Plaintiffs and \nproposed class members must show that Defendant acted with deliberate indifference to \nthe risk posed. See Helling, 509 U.S. at 33-35. Plaintiffs may do so by showing that the \nidentified risk was “longstanding, pervasive, well-documented, or expressly noted by \nprison officials in the past.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842. Plaintiffs must show both that (1) \nthe defendant “knows of” the identified risk, and (2) the defendant “disregards an \nexcessive risk to inmate health or safety.” Both prongs are satisfied here. \nThere is overwhelming evidence that Defendant “knew of a substantial risk” \nposed by COVID-19. Defendant has posted on social media that “it wasn’t a matter of ‘if’ \nmembers of the Sheriff’s Office would potentially contract the virus but instead, \n‘when.’”68 The ACLU of Colorado sent a letter to Defendant over a week ago \n \n68 @SteveReamsForWeldCountySheriff, Facebook (Apr. 1, 2020 1:49 PM), \nhttps://www.facebook.com/SteveReamsForWeldCountySheriff/photos/a.1624067639363\n94/1531739390336451/?type=3&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBZ4io1hdRZJoR8kRHrYm\n1gd48VFAE11q5vApXPwdEbwFJuO_Xnb3c6C0xf_K7l9-\nEtahdydbF0SDNsmquaCqmIx8X2VejTEk3vTgqxJiR3bbS6bXNYU2rq2lgQoL6stJqQ3F\nnMt46gehk67JDRU7FqiPQ8H3vAbofmwIURGyH_7cqbmlT6OcltdlluyJ8DrwA-\n8G4lMRRW7_fj2j6rJZSt5CjZw7S4rb8o_AIz-\n580nZbBsbgp3Q63WSQkOpqPUne2prkqWjepsWhp9a9K8UgK4BxhqYYJ3t78twjsXpd\nQsmGwEh0nFUrjLKu9zFQvZMuPlOqqot1Ly-6jhTZSc2nfHw&__tn__=-R \n  40\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 41 of 54\n \ndemonstrating the extreme risk that COVID-19 posed to the vulnerable inmates in his \njail.69  \nAdditionally, Governor Polis issued an Executive Order a week ago that put \nDefendant on notice of the risk posed: “The potential spread of COVID-19 in facilities \nand prisons poses a significant threat to prisoners and staff who work in facilities and \nprisons[.]”70 Defendant certainly read this order, as he posted about it on social media \n(while also stating that he had not “closed the Weld County Jail nor have I started \nreleasing prisoners because of the Covid 19 virus; and I don’t intend to do so”).71 \nDefendant can hardly make a credible claim that he is unaware of the risk posed by \nCOVID-19 to correctional facilities when the Governor of this state directly outlined it. \nMoreover, courts have held that medical guidelines, and specifically CDC72 \nguidance, are persuasive authority of deliberate indifference.

See Wright v. Hayden, No. 5:08CV-179-R, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26399, at \n*7 n.1 (W.D. Ky. Mar. 31, 2009) (taking judicial notice of the CDC guidelines for the \ntransmission of HIV); Seddens v. McGinnis, No. 91-1500, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 17945 \n(7th Cir. July 24, 1992) (taking judicial notice of \"recent federal publications stating that \nAIDS cannot be transmitted through non-sexual social contact\"). \n73 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation, \nCDC, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-\n \n  41\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 42 of 54\n \nexample, in Ferguson v. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs, the court relied on CDC information that \n“MRSA is contagious, spread by having contact with individuals or objects touched by \ninfected individuals, and is ‘most likely to be spread where people are in close contact \nwith others’” in holding that plaintiffs properly alleged claims for unconstitutional \nconditions of confinement when they stated they were held in a cell with high levels of \nMRSA. No. CV 11-1001 WPL/CG, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 202824, at *54 (D.N.M. Apr. \n2, 2013).74 And, the Tenth Circuit, Mata v. Saiz, held that “[w]hile published \nrequirements for health care do not create constitutional rights, such protocols certainly \nprovide circumstantial evidence that a prison health care [worker] knew of a substantial \nrisk of serious harm.” 427 F.3d 745, 757-59 (10th Cir. 2005) (citing Howell v. Evans, 922 \nF.2d 712, 719 (11th Cir. 1991 ) (stating that “contemporary standards and opinions of the \nmedical profession also are highly relevant in determining what constitutes deliberate \nindifference to medical care.”). The Tenth Circuit relied on established medical \nguidelines in holding that plaintiff had demonstrated evidence of deliberate indifference \nto his serious medical needs. Id. at 758-59.  \nMoreover, in Hernandez v. Cty. of Monterey, the Court relied on CDC guidelines \nin granting a preliminary injunction based on a jail’s failure to adequately stop the spread \nof tuberculosis in its facility. 110 F. Supp. 3d 929, 943 (N.D. Cal. 2015). In so holding, \nthe Court stated that “known noncompliance with generally accepted guidelines for \n \ndistancing.html (last visited Apr. 6, 2020) (stating that “[l]imiting face-to-face contact \nwith other is the best way to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-\n19)”). \n74 The court cited to: MRSA Infections: Causes of MRSA Infections, CENTERS FOR \nDISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (August 9, 2010), \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/mrsa/causes/index.html. \n  42\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 43 of 54\n \ninmate health” such as the CDC guidelines related to tuberculosis, “strongly indicates \ndeliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm” and, therefore, “[a]t least \nsince the CDC released its guidelines…. Defendants’ policies and practices fell below the \nconstitutional standard of care [because] Defendants have known about the risks of harm \nbut have not changed their practices.” Id.  \nFurther, the same acts underlying Defendant’s failure to act here have been found \nto constitute deliberate indifference in similar cases. Again, in Ferguson, the court held \nthat the plaintiffs properly alleged that the jail officials knew of the presence of MRSA \n(and plaintiffs complained about it) and the jail officials took no actions to limit the \nplaintiffs’ exposure, showing deliberate indifference to a serious medical need. 2013 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 202824, at *20-21. In doing so, the court concluded that “the right to be free \nfrom confinement in a cell with other inmates known to be carrying contagious, harmful \ndiseases” was clearly established. Id. at *54-55. Additionally, in Feliciano v. Gonzales, \n13 F. Supp. 2d 151 (D.P.R. 1998), the Court found that the defendant’s “inability . . . to \nproperly isolate cases of active tuberculosis,” the “insufficient medical dormitory beds,” \nthe failure to “fully screen incoming inmates,” and the failure to “provide for a sick call \nsystem that ensures access to care and that is capable of effectively handling \nemergencies” constituted deliberate indifference. Id. at 208–09. \nIn other cases, the defendant’s inability to “adequately quarantine or remove \ninmates and support staff known to have active tuberculosis” was found to constitute \ndeliberate indifference. See Shimon v. Dep’t of Corr. Servs. for N.Y., No. 93-cv-3144 \n(DC), 1996 WL 15688, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 17, 1996); see also Hernandez, 110 F. Supp. \n3d at 943. And in Joy v. Healthcare CMS, the Court found that the plaintiffs stated a \n  43\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 44 of 54\n \nclaim under the Eighth Amendment where the warden “was aware that inmates were not \nthoroughly screened for disease before going into general population and that \nCorrectional Medical Services does not have a policy in place to examine inmates before \nplacing them into general population.” 534 F. Supp. 2d 485 (D. Del. 2008). As discussed \nabove, the record is replete with Defendant’s deficient performance in all of these \ncategories, including a failed quarantine policy, rampant medical delays, and ineffective \nscreening procedures.  \nFurthermore, Defendant is not spared liability by claiming that he is not aware of \nthe risk of COVID-19 to specific individual residents. The Supreme Court held in \nFarmer, that it “does not matter,” under the deliberate indifference prong, “whether a \nprisoner faces an excessive risk of attack for reasons personal to him or because all \nprisoners in his situation face such a risk.” 511 U.S. at 843. For that proposition, the \nSupreme Court relied upon Helling’s observation “that the Eighth Amendment requires a \nremedy for exposure of inmates to ‘infectious maladies’ such as hepatitis and venereal \ndisease ‘even though the possible infection might not affect all of those exposed.’” Id. at \n844 (quoting Helling, 509 U.S. at 33). \nThe record evidence thus shows that Defendant knew, and knows, of the risk of \nCOVID19, but has recklessly disregarded that risk. He has have done so by failing to \nfollow established guidelines for preventing the spread and severity of COVID-19 and by \nadopting policies, and failing to adopt others, that would mitigate the risk and harm of the \nvirus.  \nUltimately, Plaintiffs are sitting in their crowded cells awaiting a death sentence. \nDefendant is aware of this fact, and he is also aware that the only way to protect the \n  44\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 45 of 54\n \nvulnerable inmates from serious harm is to require physical distancing be implemented in \nthe Weld County Jail. Such a failure to meaningfully act in the face of an unprecedented \npandemic that is killing thousands is clear indifference that leaves Plaintiffs—and \nparticularly the vulnerable Plaintiffs for whom emergency relief is sought—at imminent \nrisk of serious harm and death. \n5.1(b) The current conditions of the pretrial-detainee Plaintiffs’ \nconfinement amounts to punishment in violation of their \nFourteenth Amendment rights. \n \nPlaintiffs and class members who are detained pretrial have due process \nprotections against punishment under the Fourteenth Amendment. Pretrial detainees are \npresumed innocent, and they are thus “entitled to more considerate treatment and \nconditions of confinement than criminals whose conditions of confinement are designed \nto punish.” Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 322 (1982). “Due process requires that a \npretrial detainee not be punished.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 535 n.16. Therefore, \nthe Fourteenth Amendment requires the government to do more than provide the \n“minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities,” Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347 \n(1981), to non-convicted detainees. To assess the constitutionality of pretrial detention \nconditions that are not alleged to violate any express constitutional guarantee, a district \ncourt must determine whether those conditions amount to punishment of the \ndetainee. Bell, 441 U.S. at 535; Pierce, 526 F.3d at 1205; Demery, 378 F.3d at 1029. \n“[T]he determination of whether a particular condition or restriction imposes punishment \nin the constitutional sense will generally turn on whether an alternate purpose is \nreasonably assignable.” Pierce, 526 F.3d at 1205. If a restriction or condition is not \nreasonably related to a legitimate goal—if it is arbitrary or purposeless—a court \n  45\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 46 of 54\n \npermissibly may infer that the purpose of the governmental action is punishment that may \nnot constitutionally be inflicted upon detainees qua detainees. Bell, 441 U.S. at \n539 (quoting Kennedy v. Mendoza—Martinez, 372 U.S. 144 (1963)). \nPlaintiffs’ conditions of confinement are not reasonably related to a legitimate, \nnonpunitive governmental objective. Although ordinarily detention at the Weld County \nJail would be reasonably related to the government objective of ensuring their attendance \nat court dates, “the present conditions of confinement are markedly different. At this \npoint, Petitioners are confined in facilities where they are particularly vulnerable \nto COVID-19 because of the lack of ability to maintain distance from others[.]” Coreas v. \nBounds, Civil Action No. TDC-20-0780, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59211, at *42 (D. Md. \nApr. 3, 2020). “Such conditions imposing a palpable risk of death or serious harm inflict \nfar more serious consequences on them than are justified by the need to hold them[.]” Id. \nTherefore, this Court should hold, just as the Court in Coreas held, that “such conditions \nwould bear no reasonable relationship to the purpose for which persons are committed \nand [] violate due process.” Id. (citing Thakker, No. 20 C 0480, Dkt. 47). \n5.1(c) Plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm absent the \ntemporary restraining order.75 \n \n \n75 Plaintiffs do not make hay of the fact that “‘[w]hen an alleged constitutional right is \ninvolved, most courts hold that no further showing of irreparable injury is necessary,’” \nKikumura v. Hurley, 242 F.3d 950, 963 (10th Cir. 2001) (quoting 11A Charles Alan \nWright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 2948.1 (2d ed. 1995)), because that is \nsuch a well-established principle that it does not necessitate significant briefing. Elrod v. \nBurns, 427 U.S. 347); see also Awad v. Ziriax, 670 F.3d 1111, 1131 (10th Cir. 2012); see \nalso Preston v. Thompson, 589 F.2d 300, 303 n.3 (7th Cir. 1978) (holding that “[t]he \nexistence of a continuing constitutional violation constitutes proof of an irreparable \nharm” while affirming grant of preliminary injunction in prison conditions case). \n  46\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 47 of 54\n \nPlaintiffs have moved for emergency interim injunctive relief because they are the \nmost vulnerable inmates in the jail, for whom the difference of even just a few days is a \nmatter of life and death. Cases of COVID-19 have increased exponentially in a matter of \nweeks. And the virus has already spread to the Weld County Jail. Given the deadliness of \nthe disease and the state’s already over-taxed medical system, there is a substantial \npossibility that, absent immediate relief from the Court, vulnerable inmates within the \nWeld County Jail will be infected with COVID-19. And these vulnerable Plaintiffs are \nolder adults or people with pre-existing medical conditions that increase the likelihood of \nsevere illness or death if they contract COVID-19. For some of these vulnerable inmates, \nif they contract “coronavirus they have up to a 20 percent chance of death, greater than \nthe odds of losing a game of Russian roulette.” Coreas, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59211, at \n*42.  \nCourts have expressed no hesitation in finding that risk of contracting COVID-19 \nconstitutes irreparable harm where plaintiffs are housed in facilities with a confirmed \ncase of COVID-19. In Basank, 2020 WL 1481503, the Court observed that because \n“[e]ach of the jails where a Petitioner is being housed has reported confirmed cases of \nCOVID-19,” the “risk that Petitioners will face a severe, and quite possibly fatal, \ninfection if they remain in . . . detention constitutes irreparable harm warranting a TRO.” \nId. at *4. There are already multiple confirmed cases of COVID-19 among the population \nat the Weld County Jail, with more sure to come. The Tenth Circuit has held that theses \nthese life-and-death stakes (where injury is “both certain and great,” “serious or \nsubstantial[,]” of the sort that “cannot be adequately atoned for in money[,]” and one that \n“the district court cannot remedy following a final determination on the merits”) are \n  47\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 48 of 54\n \nsufficient to establish a likelihood of irreparable harm in support of injunctive relief. \nPrairie Band of Potawatomi Indians v. Pierce, 253 F.3d 1234, 1250 (10th Cir. \n2001) (quotations and alterations omitted); Greater Yellowstone Coal. v. Flowers, 321 \nF.3d 1250, 1258 (10th Cir. 2003) (holding that there is a showing of irreparable harm \nwhen the “harm cannot be compensated after the fact by monetary damages”); see also \nPadilla v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement, 387 F. Supp. 3d 1219, 1231 (W.D. \nWash. 2019) (recognizing that “substandard physical conditions, [and] low standards of \nmedical care” in immigration detention constitute irreparable harm justifying injunctive \nrelief); Indep. Living Cent. of S. California, Inc. v. Shewry, 543 F.3d 1047, 1050 (9th Cir. \n2008) (recognizing that Medi-Cal beneficiaries would suffer irreparable harm where new \npolicy would limit beneficiaries’ access to “much-needed pharmaceuticals”). \nMoreover, the Weld County Jail is abjectly failing to test inmates for COVID-19 \nthat present less than all four symptoms of the disease and even the failure to test for a \ndisease has been sufficient to support a finding of irreparable harm. See Boone v. Brown, \n2005 WL 2006997, at *14 (D.N.J. Aug. 22, 2005) (holding that allegation of refusal to \nprovide adequate testing for highly contagious infectious disease sufficient to \ndemonstrate irreparable harm); Austin v. Pa. Dep’t of Corr., 1992 WL 277511, at *7 \n(E.D. Pa. Sept. 29, 1992) (granting preliminary injunction for prison to develop testing \nand protocol for Tuberculosis); see also Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 477 (2d Cir. \n1996) (holding that state officials have an affirmative obligation to protect prisoners from \ninfectious disease). And, the risks here are even more extreme than testing. Weld \nCounty’s ongoing failure to provide conditions that allow people in its custody to \nperform the CDC-mandated protective measures, including physical distancing, not only \n  48\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 49 of 54\n \nrisks irreparable harm to Plaintiffs, but nearly guarantees it. Jones’El, 164 F. Supp. 2d at \n1123 (“[P]ain, suffering and the risk of death constitute irreparable harm sufficient to \nsupport a preliminary injunction in prison cases.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). \nEven for those who survive infection, there may be a prolonged recovery, including the \nneed for extensive rehabilitation, neurological damage, and the loss of respiratory \ncapacity. Cole v. Collier, No. 4:14-CV-1698, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112095, at *141-42 \n(S.D. Tex. July 19, 2017) (holding plaintiffs had demonstrated irreparable injury where \nthere was evidence that “[t]hose who experience heat stroke [from a lack of air \nconditioning in their prison cell] but do not die are at risk of being permanently \ndisabled”).  \nThe Constitution does not require that the vulnerable Plaintiffs wait until they \nhave contracted or been exposed to COVID-19 before obtaining injunctive relief. \nThakker, No. 20 C 0480, Dkt. 47, at 8 (“Petitioners face the inexorable progression of a \nglobal pandemic creeping across our nation—a pandemic to which they are particularly \nvulnerable to due to age and underlying medical conditions. At this point, it is not a \nmatter of if COVID-19 will enter Pennsylvania prisoners, but when it is finally detected \ntherein.”); Coronel, at *5 (“Due to their serious underlying medical conditions, all \nPetitioners face a risk of severe, irreparable harm if they contract COVID-19.”). Simply \nput, Plaintiffs’ lives are on the line and the harm they face is clearly irreparable. \n5.1(d) The balance of equities favors immediately stopping the spread \nof COVID-19 among Plaintiffs, and the community. \n \nThe balance of equities weighs in favor of ordering that all Weld County inmates \nbe physically distanced from one another, not just the members of the Plaintiff class, until \nthe pressing danger posted by this pandemic has passed. In evaluating this factor, the \n  49\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 50 of 54\n \nCourt must “balance the competing claims of injury, which involves considering the \neffect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested relief.” Shvartser v. \nLekser, 308 F. Supp. 3d 260, 267 (D.D.C. 2018). Here, a temporary restraining order and \npreliminary injunction will not “substantially injure other interested parties.” Chaplaincy \nof Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006). To the contrary, \ngiven the nature of COVID-19, not issuing preliminary relief in this case would cause \ninjury to parties beyond the plaintiffs, including Defendant, his staff, and the public at \nlarge. As the Central District of California explained in granting a TRO in a similar case: \nThe balance of the equities tip sharply in favor of the Petitioners. The \nPetitioners face[] irreparable harm to their constitutional rights and health. \nIndeed, there is no harm to the Government when a court prevents the \nGovernment from engaging in unlawful practices.  \n \nTemporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause at 10, Castillo, No. 20-cv-605. \nHere too, other than the relatively minimal administrative burden, there is no identifiable \n“harm” to Defendant. This burden is far outweighed by what is at stake to Plaintiffs and \nthe public if no TRO is issued. \nAs the district court in Thakker noted, “the status quo of a mere few weeks \nago no longer applies.” No. 20 C 0480, Dkt. 47, at 24. For the vulnerable inmates \nseeking relief—inmates with underlying medical conditions who face a particular \nrisk of severe illness and death from exposure to COVID-19, and those who are \nmedically vulnerable because of their age—Plaintiffs’ request is a matter of life \nand death. The balance of the equities in this case favors life. \n5.1(e) There is a strong public interest in stopping the spread of \nCOVID-19, both within the Weld County Jail and the \ncommunity. \n \n  50\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 51 of 54\n \nWhere, as here, Plaintiffs demonstrate that their constitutional rights have been \nviolated, it follows that granting injunctive relief is in the public interest. ““It is always in \nthe public interest to prevent the violation of a party’s constitutional rights.” Awad, 670 \nF.3d at 1131. That interest alone is sufficient to weigh in favor of injunctive relief.  \nHere, however, the public has an additional independent and overwhelming \ninterest in preliminary relief that would require Defendant to take action to minimize the \nspread of COVID19. It is well established that “public health” is a “significant public \ninterest.” See Grand River Enters. Six Nations, Ltd. v. Pryor, 425 F.3d 158, 169 (2d Cir. \n2005). The public interest in minimizing the spread of COVID-19 is overwhelming and \nnearly impossible to overstate. \nAs noted above, COVID-19 is highly contagious and has substantially higher \nmortality rates than any other disease with its rate of transmission. The disease has no \nvaccine or cure, meaning that each new infection may result in several more individuals \nbecoming infected. Public health experts have thus unanimously agreed that the most \ncritical actions that can be taken are preventive measures like self-isolating, maintaining a \ndistance of six feet from all other individuals, and frequent disinfection. See, e.g., Exs. 1 \n& 2.  \nInmates are thus destined to become vectors of disease, and will inevitably infect \nseveral other inmates, Weld County employees, medical staff, and eventually, healthcare \nworkers in the community when critically infected inmates are sent to nearby hospitals to \nbe treated. “The impact of [a temporary restraining order] reaches beyond the parties, \ncarrying with it a potential for public consequences.” Hernandez, 872 F.3d at 996 \n(quotations omitted). An outbreak of COVID-19 could put significant pressure on or \n  51\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 52 of 54\n \nexceed the capacity of local health infrastructure. Ex. 2. Ensuring that inmates in the \nWeld County Jail are physically distanced significantly reduces the health and economic \nburden on the local community and health infrastructure at large. Hernandez, 872 F.3d at \n996-97 (“[T]he general public’s interest in efficient allocation of the government’s fiscal \nresources favors granting [relief]”). Absent swift action by this Court, the results will be \ndevastating for Weld County. Physically distancing inmates within the Weld County Jail \nis essential to public safety. \n5.2 The Court should not require Plaintiffs to provide security prior to \nissuing a temporary restraining order.  \n \nUnder Rule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, district courts have \ndiscretion to determine the amount of the bond accompanying a preliminary injunction, \nand this includes the authority to set a nominal bond. In this case, the Court should waive \nbond because Plaintiffs are indigent, the requested interim relief is in the public interest, \nand the injunction is necessary to vindicate constitutional rights. See Davis v. Mineta, 302 \nF.3d 1104, 1126 (10th Cir. 2002) (“minimal bond amount should be considered” in \npublic interest case); Pocklington v. O’Leary, 1986 WL 5748, at *2 (N.D. Ill. May 6, \n1986) (“[B]ecause of [a prisoner’s] indigent status, no bond under Rule 65(c) is \nrequired.”); Complete Angler, L.L.C. v. City of Clearwater, 607 F.Supp.2d 1326, 1335 \n(M.D. Fla. 2009) (“Waiving the bond requirement is particularly appropriate where a \nplaintiff alleges the infringement of a fundamental constitutional right.”). \n6. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for emergency interim relief should \nbe granted in its entirety.  \nDated: April 7, 2020        \n  52\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 53 of 54\n \n          Respectfully submitted, \n \ns/ Andy McNulty       \nAndy McNulty  \nMichael P.

Background and Qualifications \n \n1.  I am Dr. Jaimie Meyer, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Yale School of Medicine \nand Assistant Clinical Professor of Nursing at Yale School of Nursing in New Haven, \nConnecticut. I am board certified in Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases and Addiction \nMedicine.  I completed my residency in Internal Medicine at NY Presbyterian Hospital at \nColumbia, New York, in 2008. I completed a fellowship in clinical Infectious Diseases at \nYale School of Medicine in 2011 and a fellowship in Interdisciplinary HIV Prevention at \nthe Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS in 2012. I hold a Master of Science in \nBiostatistics and Epidemiology from Yale School of Public Health. \n2.  I have worked for over a decade on infectious diseases in the context of jails and prisons. \nFrom 2008-2016, I served as the Infectious Disease physician for York Correctional \nInstitution in Niantic, Connecticut, which is the only state jail and prison for women in \nConnecticut.  In that capacity, I was responsible for the management of HIV, Hepatitis C, \ntuberculosis, and other infectious diseases in the facility.  Since then, I have maintained a \ndedicated HIV clinic in the community for patients returning home from prison and jail.  \nFor over a decade, I have been continuously funded by the NIH, industry, and \nfoundations for clinical research on HIV prevention and treatment for people involved in \nthe criminal justice system, including those incarcerated in closed settings (jails and \nprisons) and in the community under supervision (probation and parole).  I have served as \nan expert consultant on infectious diseases and women’s health in jails and prisons for the \nUN Office on Drugs and Crimes, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and others.  I also served \nas an expert health witness for the US Commission on Civil Rights Special Briefing on \nWomen in Prison.      \n3.  I have written and published extensively on the topics of infectious diseases among \npeople involved in the criminal justice system including book chapters and articles in \nleading peer-reviewed journals (including Lancet HIV, JAMA Internal Medicine, \nAmerican Journal of Public Health, International Journal of Drug Policy) on issues of \nprevention, diagnosis, and management of HIV, Hepatitis C, and other infectious diseases \namong people involved in the criminal justice system.  In making the following \nstatements, I am not commenting on the particular issues posed this case. Rather, I am \nmaking general statements about the realities of persons in detention facilities, jails and \nprisons. \n4.  My C.V. includes a full list of my honors, experience, and publications, and it is attached \nas Exhibit A.  \n5.  I was paid $1,000 for my time drafting an earlier version of this report filed in another \ncase. I subsequently prepared this version of the report without receiving payment for my \nservices. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1-1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 8\n \n6.  I have not testified as an expert at trial or by deposition in the past four years.  \nII.  Heightened Risk of Epidemics in Jails and Prisons \n \n7.  The risk posed by infectious diseases in jails and prisons is significantly higher than in \nthe community, both in terms of risk of transmission, exposure, and harm to individuals \nwho become infected. There are several reasons this is the case, as delineated further \nbelow.    \n8.  Globally, outbreaks of contagious diseases are all too common in closed detention \nsettings and are more common than in the community at large.  Prisons and jails are not \nisolated from communities.  Staff, visitors, contractors, and vendors pass between \ncommunities and facilities and can bring infectious diseases into facilities.  Moreover, \nrapid turnover of jail and prison populations means that people often cycle between \nfacilities and communities.  People often need to be transported to and from facilities to \nattend court and move between facilities.  Prison health is public health. \n9.  Reduced prevention opportunities: Congregate settings such as jails and prisons allow for \nrapid spread of infectious diseases that are transmitted person to person, especially those \npassed by droplets through coughing and sneezing. When people must share dining halls, \nbathrooms, showers, and other common areas, the opportunities for transmission are \ngreater. When infectious diseases are transmitted from person to person by droplets, the \nbest initial strategy is to practice social distancing.  When jailed or imprisoned, people \nhave much less of an opportunity to protect themselves by social distancing than they \nwould in the community. Spaces within jails and prisons are often also poorly ventilated, \nwhich promotes highly efficient spread of diseases through droplets. Placing someone in \nsuch a setting therefore dramatically reduces their ability to protect themselves from \nbeing exposed to and acquiring infectious diseases.  \n10. Disciplinary segregation or solitary confinement is not an effective disease containment \nstrategy.  Beyond the known detrimental mental health effects of solitary confinement, \nisolation of people who are ill in solitary confinement results in decreased medical \nattention and increased risk of death.  Isolation of people who are ill using solitary \nconfinement also is an ineffective way to prevent transmission of the virus through \ndroplets to others because, except in specialized negative pressure rooms (rarely in \nmedical units if available at all), air continues to flow outward from rooms to the rest of \nthe facility.  Risk of exposure is thus increased to other people in prison and staff.  \n11. Reduced prevention opportunities: During an infectious disease outbreak, people can \nprotect themselves by washing hands.  Jails and prisons do not provide adequate \nopportunities to exercise necessary hygiene measures, such as frequent handwashing or \nuse of alcohol-based sanitizers when handwashing is unavailable.  Jails and prisons are \noften under-resourced and ill-equipped with sufficient hand soap and alcohol-based \nsanitizers for people detained in and working in these settings.  High-touch surfaces \n(doorknobs, light switches, etc.) should also be cleaned and disinfected regularly with \nbleach to prevent virus spread, but this is often not done in jails and prisons because of a \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1-1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 8\n \nlack of cleaning supplies and lack of people available to perform necessary cleaning \nprocedures.  \n12. Reduced prevention opportunities: During an infectious disease outbreak, a containment \nstrategy requires people who are ill with symptoms to be isolated and that caregivers have \naccess to personal protective equipment, including gloves, masks, gowns, and eye \nshields.  Jails and prisons are often under-resourced and ill-equipped to provide sufficient \npersonal protective equipment for people who are incarcerated and caregiving staff, \nincreasing the risk for everyone in the facility of a widespread outbreak.  \n13. Increased susceptibility: People incarcerated in jails and prisons are more susceptible to \nacquiring and experiencing complications from infectious diseases than the population in \nthe community.1 This is because people in jails and prisons are more likely than people in \nthe community to have chronic underlying health conditions, including diabetes, heart \ndisease, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, and lower immune systems from \nHIV. \n14. Jails and prisons are often poorly equipped to diagnose and manage infectious disease \noutbreaks.  Some jails and prisons lack onsite medical facilities or 24-hour medical care.  \nThe medical facilities at jails and prisons are almost never sufficiently equipped to handle \nlarge outbreaks of infectious diseases. To prevent transmission of droplet-borne \ninfectious diseases, people who are infected and ill need to be isolated in specialized \nairborne negative pressure rooms.  Most jails and prisons have few negative pressure \nrooms if any, and these may be already in use by people with other conditions (including \ntuberculosis or influenza).  Resources will become exhausted rapidly and any beds \navailable will soon be at capacity. This makes both containing the illness and caring for \nthose who have become infected much more difficult. \n15. Jails and prisons lack access to vital community resources to diagnose and manage \ninfectious diseases. Jails and prisons do not have access to community health resources \nthat can be crucial in identifying and managing widespread outbreaks of infectious \ndiseases.  This includes access to testing equipment, laboratories, and medications. \n16. Jails and prisons often need to rely on outside facilities (hospitals, emergency \ndepartments) to provide intensive medical care given that the level of care they can \nprovide in the facility itself is typically relatively limited. During an epidemic, this will \nnot be possible, as those outside facilities will likely be at or over capacity themselves.   \n17. Health safety: As an outbreak spreads through jails, prisons, and communities, medical \npersonnel become sick and do not show up to work. Absenteeism means that facilities \ncan become dangerously understaffed with healthcare providers. This increases a number \nof risks and can dramatically reduce the level of care provided.  As health systems inside \nfacilities are taxed, people with chronic underlying physical and mental health conditions \nand serious medical needs may not be able to receive the care they need for these \n                                                 \n1 Active case finding for communicable diseases in prisons, 391 The Lancet 2186 (2018), \nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31251-0/fulltext. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1-1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 8\n \nconditions.  As supply chains become disrupted during a global pandemic, the availability \nof medicines and food may be limited. \n18. Safety and security: As an outbreak spreads through jails, prisons, and communities, \ncorrectional officers and other security personnel become sick and do not show up to \nwork.  Absenteeism poses substantial safety and security risk to both the people inside \nthe facilities and the public.   \n19. These risks have all been borne out during past epidemics of influenza in jails and \nprisons. For example, in 2012, the CDC reported an outbreak of influenza in 2 facilities \nin Maine, resulting in two inmate deaths.2  Subsequent CDC investigation of 995 inmates \nand 235 staff members across the 2 facilities discovered insufficient supplies of influenza \nvaccine and antiviral drugs for treatment of people who were ill and prophylaxis for \npeople who were exposed.  During the H1N1-strain flu outbreak in 2009 (known as the \n“swine flu”), jails and prisons experienced a disproportionately high number of cases.3  \nEven facilities on “quarantine” continued to accept new intakes, rendering the quarantine \nincomplete. These scenarios occurred in the “best case” of influenza, a viral infection for \nwhich there was an effective and available vaccine and antiviral medications, unlike \nCOVID-19, for which there is currently neither. \nIII.  Profile of COVID-19 as an Infectious Disease4 \n \n20.  The novel coronavirus, officially known as SARS-CoV-2, causes a disease known as \nCOVID-19.  The virus is thought to pass from person to person primarily through \nrespiratory droplets (by coughing or sneezing) but may also survive on inanimate \nsurfaces.  People seem to be most able to transmit the virus to others when they are \nsickest but it is possible that people can transmit the virus before they start to show \nsymptoms or for weeks after their symptoms resolve.  In China, where COVID-19 \noriginated, the average infected person passed the virus on to 2-3 other people; \ntransmission occurred at a distance of 3-6 feet.  Not only is the virus very efficient at \nbeing transmitted through droplets, everyone is at risk of infection because our immune \nsystems have never been exposed to or developed protective responses against this virus. \nA vaccine is currently in development but will likely not be able for another year to the \n                                                 \n2 Influenza Outbreaks at Two Correctional Facilities — Maine, March 2011, Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention (2012), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6113a3.htm. \n3 David M.

Antiviral medications are currently in testing but not yet FDA-approved, \nso only available for compassionate use from the manufacturer.  People in prison and jail \nwill likely have even less access to these novel health strategies as they become available. \n21. Most people (80%) who become infected with COVID-19 will develop a mild upper \nrespiratory infection but emerging data from China suggests serious illness occurs in up \nto 16% of cases, including death.5  Serious illness and death is most common among \npeople with underlying chronic health conditions, like heart disease, lung disease, liver \ndisease, and diabetes, and older age.6  Death in COVID-19 infection is usually due to \npneumonia and sepsis.  The emergence of COVID-19 during influenza season means that \npeople are also at risk from serious illness and death due to influenza, especially when \nthey have not received the influenza vaccine or the pneumonia vaccine. \n22. The care of people who are infected with COVID-19 depends on how seriously they are \nill.7  People with mild symptoms may not require hospitalization but may continue to be \nclosely monitored at home.  People with moderate symptoms may require hospitalization \nfor supportive care, including intravenous fluids and supplemental oxygen.  People with \nsevere symptoms may require ventilation and intravenous antibiotics. Public health \nofficials anticipate that hospital settings will likely be overwhelmed and beyond capacity \nto provide this type of intensive care as COVID-19 becomes more widespread in \ncommunities. \n23. COVID-19 prevention strategies include containment and mitigation.  Containment \nrequires intensive hand washing practices, decontamination and aggressive cleaning of \nsurfaces, and identifying and isolating people who are ill or who have had contact with \npeople who are ill, including the use of personal protective equipment.  Jails and prisons \nare totally under-resourced to meet the demand for any of these strategies.  As infectious \ndiseases spread in the community, public health demands mitigation strategies, which \ninvolves social distancing and closing other communal spaces (schools, workplaces, etc.) \nto protect those most vulnerable to disease.  Jails and prisons are unable to adequately \nprovide social distancing or meet mitigation recommendations as described above. \n24. The time to act is now.  Data from other settings demonstrate what happens when jails \nand prisons are unprepared for COVID-19.  News outlets reported that Iran temporarily \n                                                 \n5 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Situation Summary, Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (March 14, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary.html. \n6 Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, \nChina: a retrospective cohort study.

It may be impossible to adequately respond to the COVID-19 \npandemic, while also respecting the rights and dignity of people who are incarcerated.    \nIV.  Possible Risks of COVID-19 in ICE Detention Facilities \n \n25. Based on my experience working on public health in jails and prisons, I can make the \nfollowing general statements about how the COVID-19 outbreak will interact with and \nexacerbate conditions that may exist in some detention centers. \n26. Any delays in access to care that already exist in normal circumstances will only become \nworse during an outbreak, making it especially difficult for the facilities to contain any \ninfections and to treat those who are infected. \n27. Failure to provide individuals with continuation of the treatment they were receiving in \nthe community, or even just interruption of treatment, for chronic underlying health \nconditions will result in increased risk of morbidity and mortality related to these chronic \nconditions.  \n28. Failure to provide individuals adequate medical care for their underlying chronic health \nconditions results in increased risk of COVID-19 infection and increased risk of \ninfection-related morbidity and mortality if they do become infected. \n29. People with underlying chronic mental health conditions need adequate access to \ntreatment for these conditions throughout their period of detention.  Failure to provide \nadequate mental health care, as may happen when health systems in jails and prisons are \ntaxed by COVID-19 outbreaks, may result in poor health outcomes.  Moreover, mental \nhealth conditions may be exacerbated by the stress of incarceration during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including isolation and lack of visitation.  \n30. Failure to keep accurate and sufficient medical records will make it more difficult for \nfacilities to identify vulnerable individuals in order to both monitor their health and \nprotect them from infection.  Inadequate screening and testing procedures in facilities \nincrease the widespread COVID-19 transmission.  \n31. Language barriers will similarly prevent the effective identification of individuals who \nare particularly vulnerable or may have symptoms of COVID-19. Similarly, the failure to \n                                                 \n8 Iran temporarily releases 70,000 prisoners as coronavirus cases surge, Reuters (March 9, \n2020), https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-iran/iran-temporarily-releases-\n70000-prisoners-as-coronavirus-cases-surge-idUSKBN20W1E5. \n9 Luke Barr & Christina Carrega, State prisons prepare for coronavirus but federal prisons not \nproviding significant guidance, sources say, ABC News (March 11, 2020), \nhttps://abcnews.go.com/US/state-prisons-prepare-coronavirus-federal-prisons-providing-\nsignificant/story?id=69433690. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1-1   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 8\n \nprovide necessary aids to individuals who have auditory or visual disabilities could also \nlimit the ability to identify and monitor symptoms of COVID-19.   \n32. Facilities with a track record of neglecting individuals with acute pain and serious health \nneeds under ordinary circumstances are more likely to be ill-equipped to identify, \nmonitor, and treat a COVID-19 epidemic. \n33. Similarly, facilities with a track record of failing to adequately manage single individuals \nin need of emergency care are more likely to be seriously ill-equipped and under-\nprepared when a number of people will need urgent care simultaneously, as would occur \nduring a COVID-19 epidemic.  \n34. For individuals in facilities that have experienced these problems in the past, the \nexperience of an epidemic and the lack of care while effectively trapped can itself be \ntraumatizing, compounding the trauma of incarceration.  \nV.  Conclusion and Recommendations \n \n35. Reducing the size of the population in jails and prisons can be crucially important to \nreducing the level of risk both for those within those facilities and for the community at \nlarge. As such, from a public health perspective, it is my recommendation that individuals \nwho can safely and appropriately remain in the community not be placed in ICE \ndetention facilities at this time. I also recommend that individuals who are already in \nthese facilities should be evaluated for release. \n36. This is more important still for individuals with preexisting conditions (e.g., heart \ndisease, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, suppressed immune system, diabetes) \nor who are over the age of 65.  \n37. Health in jails and prisons is community health. Protecting the health of individuals who \nare detained in and work in these facilities is vital to protecting the health of the wider \ncommunity.  \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \n \n \nMarch 2_3_, 2020            _______________________ \nNew Haven, Connecticut           Dr. Jaimie Meyer \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1-2   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 1 of 8\n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT 2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1-2   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 8\nCarlos Franco-Paredes, MD, MPH \nDivision of Infectious Diseases \nDepartment of Medicine \nDirector, Infectious Diseases Fellowship \nTraining Program  \n \nMail Stop B168 \nResearch Complex 2 \n12700 E. 19th Avenue | Aurora, Colorado 80045 \no 303-724-4443  |  f 7208480192  |  \n \ncarlos.franco-paredes@cuanschutz.edu \n    \n \nApril 7, 2020 \n \n \nTo Judicial Officer overseeing COVID-19 Litigation against Weld County: \n \nThe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly emerging \nzoonotic agent initially identified in December 2019 that causes the Coronavirus Disease \n2019 (COVID-19), formerly known as the 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019nCoV). Infection with \nCOVID-19 is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially in patients with \nchronic medical conditions and those 55 years of age and older. Based on a recently \npublished systematic review of the literature, of which I am a co-author, at least one-fifth of \ninfected cases required supportive care in medical intensive care units. Equally concerning \nis the fact that despite the implementation of optimal supportive interventions, case fatality \nrate among hospitalized patients is higher than 10 percent. \n \nAs an infectious disease clinician with a public health degree in the dynamics of infectious \ndisease epidemics and pandemics, I am concerned about the inevitable spread of COVID-\n19 in jails, prisons, community corrections facilities, and juvenile detention centers. The \nconditions in these facilities do not allow for appropriate infection control protocols and \nwill make the current COVID-19 pandemic worse. Incarcerated populations have higher \nrates of underlying illness and, by extension, will have a higher case fatality rate. It is now \nclear that asymptomatic individuals can spread this infection. With staff traveling \nbetween their homes and the facilities, and newly arrested individuals brought in as \nothers are released, containment of the virus is not possible. This epidemic has the \npotential to become the Coming Prison Plague.  \nExperience  \n \nOver my 20 years of experience as an infectious disease clinician, I have provided care at \noutpatient clinics and during inpatient consultation services in infectious diseases to a large \nnumber of patients residing in jail and prison populations. I have witnessed firsthand the \nimpact of COVID-19 at my institution providing direct care to at least 40 patients with this \ninfection, with many requiring intensive care management and often developing respiratory \nfailure necessitating mechanical ventilator support.  \n \nBased on my conversations with patients, my own observations, and information that exists \nregarding the resources available within jail, prison, community corrections, and juvenile \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1-2   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 8\ndetention facilities, it is my professional opinion that the medical care available cannot \nproperly accommodate the needs of patients should there be an outbreak of COVID-19 in \nthese facilities.  \n \nPeople who are considered at high risk of severe illness and death should they be infected \nwith the coronavirus include the following: \n \n•  People age 55 or older \n•  Anyone diagnosed with cancer, autoimmune disease (including lupus, rheumatoid \narthritis, psoriasis, Sjogren’s, Crohn’s), chronic lung disease (including asthma, COPD, \nbronchiectasis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), history of cardiovascular disease (MI), \nchronic arthritis (rheumatoid, psoriatic), chronic liver or kidney disease, diabetes, \nhypertension, heart failure, HIV, on chronic steroids or other immunosuppressant \nmedications for chronic conditions \n•  People with a history of smoking or other substance use disorders \n•  Pregnant women  \nI can also certify that incarcerated individuals have a higher prevalence of chronic medical \nconditions that place them at high risk of developing severe coronavirus disease and \npotentially dying from this infection. Some of these medical conditions include HIV/AIDS, \nuncontrolled diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other \nconditions.  \n \nIncreasing Number of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in the U.S.  \n \nEvery U.S. state is dealing with COVID-19 cases and the number of deaths continue to pile \nup. Since March 16, 2020, the epidemiologic curve demonstrates a logarithmic increase in \nthe number of cases with many major epicenters of transmission as it has occurred in the \nPacific Northwest, New York, New Jersey, Florida, California, and Louisiana. As of today, \nthere are approximately 170,000 cases and 3,200 deaths demonstrating that community-\nbased transmission clearly continues to occuri. \n \nFalse Negative Rate in COVID-19 Testing \n \nThere is currently an enormous emphasis on testing symptomatic individuals for COVID-19 \n(despite knowing that most transmission during this pandemic occurs among undetected \ninfection including many infected and shedding the virus but not having any symptoms). \nThis is appropriate, but there is a lack of attention to the sensitivity and specificity of these \ntests, which is variable based on the type of test itself (private lab, university, WHO, etc.). \nSensitivity of the RT-PCR tests is estimated to be anywhere from ~70-85% ii . As an example, \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1-2   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 8\nthis means that out of 100 people who do have COVID-19, anywhere from 15 to 30 people \nwill have a negative (or normal) test. Reliance on the testing results alone will therefore \nmiss many infected and contagious patients.  \n \n \n \nR  is higher in Colorado than the National Rate \n0\n \nNational data suggests the R  (“R-naught”), or number of people each infected person will \n0\nalso infect, of COVID-19 to be 2.3. Data from Colorado shows the state R0 to be higher, at 3-\n4iii. This means that for every individual in the state that is infected with COVID-19, they will \ninfect 3-4 other people. This R  is responsible for the exponential rise of infection both in \n0\nColorado and nationally.  \n \nThere is reason to believe that the R0 within a jail, prison, community corrections, or \njuvenile detention center will be higher than in the general community given the \ncongregate nature of these facilities and inability to maintain social distancing and hygiene \nprotocols. A recent study of COVID-19 on a cruise ship (which provided private rooms and \nbathrooms, delivered meals, and less congregation than a carceral setting) modeled an R0 \nof 14.8, without isolation and quarantine measures.iv \n \nYounger People Seriously Affected by COVID-19 \n \nCDPHE data through March 29, 2020, indicates that over one-third of cases are people \nunder the age of 40 and over one-half of cases are people under the age of 50v. According \nto the CDC, in the United States, about 38% of coronavirus patients sick enough to be \nhospitalized were ages 20 to 54vi. As of March 30, 2020, UCHealth reported that many of \nthe people in its ICU are in their 40s and 50s, and the youngest is 19 years old. Many of \nthese patients have no serious underlying health conditionsvii. On March 30, 2020, Colorado \nreported its first two (2) deaths of people in their 40s from COVID-19viii. \n \nOngoing Concerns Regarding Hospital Capacity  \n \nThere are ongoing concerns about the medical system’s ability to manage the expected \nsurge of COVID-19 patients in the general community. As of March 27, 2020, Denver Health \nhad 54 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, with the capacity to expand to over 150 ICU beds. It is \nreported that Denver Health already has over 50 patients with COVID-19 in its acute care \nward and it’s ICU, with about a dozen individuals already on ventilatorsix. As of March 30, \n2020, the UCHealth ICU at the Anschutz campus has 72 patients with COVID-19, 37 of whom \nare critically ill and 33 of whom are on ventilators. This is more than double the number of \npatients typically in UCHeath’s ICUx. An outbreak of COVID-19 in a jail, prison, community \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1-2   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 8\ncorrections, or juvenile detention facility would be catastrophic and further burden \nhospitals already likely to be overwhelmed and under-resourced.  \nTherefore, a large outbreak in a jail or prison facility would put a tremendous strain on the \nmedical system in Colorado to the detriment of patients across the region. It is reasonable \nto anticipate that there will be the loss of additional lives that could have otherwise been \nsaved.  \nRisk Factors Present in Jails, Prisons, and Juvenile Detention Centers  \nDetention and incarceration of any kind requires large groups of people to be held together \nin a confined space and creates the worst type of setting for curbing the spread of a highly \ncontagious infection such as COVID-19. To contain the spread of the disease, infection \nprevention protocols must be meticulously followed. These infection prevention protocols \ninclude “social distancing” measures, where individuals maintain a distance of at least six \nfeet from each other, and frequent hand-washing and other good hygiene practices. These \nprotocols apply to both incarcerated and non-incarcerated individuals. In a carceral setting, \nthese protocols would require, for example, that individuals sleep one person per cell, \nrather than in bunk beds. These protocols are necessary to prevent spread of COVID-19 \namong otherwise healthy people, and are imperative for high-risk individuals. \nThe number of private rooms in a typical jail, prison, or juvenile detention facility is \ninsufficient to comply with the recommended airborne/droplet isolation guidelines.  \nAnother important consideration that complicates disinfection and decontamination \npractices is the ability of this novel coronavirus to survive for extended periods of time on \nmaterials that are highly prevalent in secure settings, such as metals and other non-porous \nsurfaces. Current outbreak protocols require frequent disinfection and decontamination of \nall surfaces of the facility, which is exceedingly difficult given the large number of \nincarcerated individuals, frequent interactions between incarcerated individuals and staff, \nand regularity with which staff move in and out of each facility. Again, it is critical to \nunderstand that even asymptomatic individuals can spread virus to others. Therefore, \nmerely screening those with symptoms is inadequate to keep COVID-19 out of jail and \nprison facilities. \nResponding to this outbreak calls for highly trained staff to correctly institute and enforce \nisolation and quarantine procedures and have training on the appropriate utilization of \npersonal protective equipment. It is essential that nursing and medical staff be trained in \ninfection control practices, implementing triage protocols, and the medical management of \nsuspected, probable and confirmed cases of coronavirus infection. These same personnel \nwould have to initiate the management of those with severe disease. Since these are closed \nfacilities, the number of exposed, infected, and ill individuals may rapidly overwhelm staff \nand resources. As a result, many patients would need transfer to hospitals near these \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1-2   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 8\nfacilities, likely overwhelming the surrounding healthcare systems, which are already \nfunctioning at full capacity caring for the general non-incarcerated community.    \nLikely Outcome if COVID-19 Spreads in Jails, Prisons, and Juvenile Detention \nGiven the high population density of jails, prisons, and juvenile detention centers, and the \nease of transmission of this viral pathogen, the infection rate will be exponential if even a \nsingle person, with or without symptoms, that is shedding the virus enters a facility. For \nevery person with the virus, they will infect more than 2 other people – whether they be \nincarcerated individuals or staff. Of those infected, one-fifth will get so ill that they require \nhospital admission, and about 10% will develop severe disease requiring treatment only \navailable in the intensive care unit. To illustrate the magnitude of this threat, a jail or prison \nthat holds 1500 individuals can anticipate that 500-650 individuals may acquire the \ninfection. Of these, 100 to 150 individuals may develop severe disease requiring admission \nto the hospital, potentially to an intensive care unit. Of these, 10-15 individuals may die \nfrom respiratory failure. The cost of care in the intensive care unit is on the order of $5,000 \nto $8,000 dollars per day, and often more for those requiring mechanical ventilation.    \n \nThe current outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-Co-2) at Cook County jail highlights the \nease of transmission of COVID-19 behind walls of prisons, jails, and juvenile detention \ncenters. There is sufficient experience with this pandemic demonstrating that congested \nliving conditions facilitate the spread of this infection.   \nRisk Minimization through Release from Jails, Prisons, and Juvenile Detention  \nReducing the number of incarcerated individuals is necessary for effective infection control \nand sanitization practices that could dramatically reduce the burden COVID-19 will \ninevitably place on our health system. Urgent action is needed given the predicted shortage \nof medical supplies such as personal protective equipment, shortage of staff as medical \npersonnel become ill themselves, and limited life-saving resources such as ventilators.  \n \nAs COVID-19 spreads, it cannot be assumed that it would be a better public health strategy \nto keep individuals in jail rather than release them to home confinement because are likely \nalready infected. First, for the reasons previously discussed, COVID-19 will spread faster in a \ncarceral facility than if individuals were able to isolate or recuperate in a more private or \nresidential setting. Second, any increase in incarcerated individuals with COVID-19 also \nincreases the concern that a large number of staff will become infected. A study of COVID-\n19 healthcare workers in Italy found that 20% of responding healthcare workers became \ninfectedxi. During the SARS outbreak, 21% of worldwide cases were among healthcare \nworkersxii. Third, attempts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in a jail or prison setting \nthrough “lockdowns”, or extreme isolation of all incarcerated individuals, raises other public \nhealth concerns, including exacerbation of mental illness. Restrictions on movement or a \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1-2   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 8\nreduction in opportunities for interaction with visitors or recreation, for example, can be \nexpected to have a deleterious effect on individuals’ mental and physical well-being. \nAdditionally, incarcerated individuals may fail to report COVID-19 symptoms for fear of \nbeing further isolated or confined.  \nConclusion \nI have been informed that the Weld County jail has at least four detention employees and \none inmate with confirmed positive tests for COVID-19, as well as a number of other \ninmates quarantined with symptoms. Correctional facilities and detention centers are not \ndesigned to contain the spread of a highly contagious disease or to treat those with \nsignificant illness. It is likely that there will be high numbers of ill incarcerated individuals, as \nwell as the staff critical to these facilities. The broader health system does not have the \ncapacity to handle a wave of critically ill patients coming from jails and prisons in addition to \nthe expected community outbreak. \nOutbreaks of highly transmissible pathogens thrive in large crowds. The prompt transfer \nof individuals with medical conditions at risk of severe disease and death due to \ncoronavirus infection, and prompt reduction in incarcerated populations overall, is \nnecessary to reduce the impact of this outbreak. \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCarlos Franco-Paredes, MD, MPH, DTMH (Gorgas) \nAssociate Professor of Medicine \nDivision of Infectious Diseases \nDepartment of Medicine \nDivision of infectious Diseases \nProgram Director Infectious Disease Fellowship  \nTraining Program, University of Colorado \n \ni\n https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html [accessed March 31, 2020] \nii\n https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2020/03/26/negative-coronavirus-test-result-doesnt-\nalways-mean-you-arent-infected/ \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1-2   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 8\n \niii\n https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HyMnIikxmjoR8mpCD7OwXMMVwYUSuzxp/view [accessed March \n30, 2020] \nJournal of Travel Medicine \niv\n J.

My name is Thomas Carranza and I am currently incarcerated in Weld County \njail. I am held pretrial on a $1,000 bond I am unable to afford. I am 55 years old and suffer from \nasthma and have been hospitalized for acute asthmatic bronchitis. I have an undiagnosed \ncondition that is causing internal bleeding in my stool. I have been informed that I have high \nblood pressure but still need to be diagnosed. I have a long history as a smoker. \n2.  I am incarcerated in a pod with at least 40-50 other people. There are up to 6 \npeople per cell. I usually have been in a cell with 6 people total. Recently, several people were \nreleased and I now have one other cellmate. There are a number of cells in my pod that still have \n6 other people in them. More inmates could be placed in my cell at any time. Each pod has 4 \ntoilets, and for males 4 urinals, shared by all of us in the pod. The toilets and urinals are located \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1-3   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 4\nin common spaces. The cells in the jail are “dry” and have no toilets or urinals. To use the \nbathroom, we have to leave our cell and go to the toilets.  \n3.  In the cells, we share a small space and sleep on triple bunk beds. For cells \nhousing 6 inmates, three inmates will share a bunk with three beds stacked on top of each other, \nwhile the other three share the same. Three bunked inmates sleep within 2-4 feet of each other. \nIts impossible for us to stay 6 feet away from each other inside the cells. The cells are about 12 \nby 10 feet. Even when only one other person is in the cell, if we move at all it is still impossible \nto stay 6 feet away from each other. The other person in my cell right now sleeps in the same \nbunk as I do, so we are just a few feet apart.   \n4.  Many people in my pod are sick or have been sick. People have symptoms like \ncoughing, fevers, being tired and achy, sore throat, and shortness of breath. Most of the people \nsick haven’t been tested for the coronavirus.  \n5.  Some people don’t have symptoms and aren’t sick, but everyone is housed \ntogether in the same pods and cells. Sick people are housed in the same pod, sharing the same \ncommon spaces, toilets, urinals, and other facilities, as those who do not have symptoms.  \n6.  Several days ago, the jail started a 23-hour lockdown in our cells, so we get only 1 \nhour of time outside the cells. In my pod, they open two cells for an hour at a time, so about 12-\n18 of us are out at any given time. Guards also let people on lockdown come and go to use the \ntoilet because the cells are dry, or for other reasons like to use the phone, so sometime its more \nlike 20 people out in the common area.  \n7.  Even after the lockdown, all of us on the pod still share common spaces, use the \nsame toilets, urinals, and restroom facilities, touch the same surfaces, use the same chairs and \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1-3   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 4\ntables in the common areas, use the same phones, and come into contact with one another when \nwe leave our cells. We also exchange food and can go from room to room.  \n8.  Even after the lockdown, we are still housed in groups with as many as 6 per cell \nin my pod. I know that there are as many as 9 per cell in A pod. It is still impossible to stay 6 feet \naway from others.  \n9.  The jail isn’t removing sick inmates out of the pods unless they have at least four \nsymptoms of COVID-19. In my pod, jail personnel wrote on a poster that you must have at least \nfour symptoms to be pulled out of the pod and quarantined.  \n10.  According to trustees working in the kitchen, people have been sick who work in \nthe kitchen and handle food and may be spreading the virus to the rest of us in the jail.   \n11.  The jail does not sanitize or disinfect the common areas in between usages, \nincluding the toilet, restroom, and other common areas.  \n12.  The guards are now wearing masks as of a couple days ago. However, the jail \nrefuses to provide masks to us. I have asked for a mask and been denied. I made a mask using a \ntowel I wrapped around my face, and jail guards ordered me to remove it. Guards told me that I \nwas inciting other inmates by wearing a mask. Another guy also tried to wear a homemade mask \nand they told him not to.  \nExecuted this 7th day of April, 2020.  \n                s/ Thomas Carranza \n                __________________________ \nThomas Carranza, by and through \ncounsel David G.

My name is Michael Ward and I am currently incarcerated in Weld County jail. I \nam held pretrial on a $10,000 bond I am unable to afford. I am 31 years old and suffer from high \nblood pressure and arthritis. I have a weakened immunize system from getting sick from West \nNile virus. As a result of this diminished immunity, I have also contracted shingles. I have a \nhistory as a smoker for about a decade.  \n2.  I am in a pod with at least 40-60 other people. There are up to 9 people per cell. I \nusually have been in a cell with 3-6 people. Since the COVID-19 epidemic, I’ve shared a cell \nwith 6 people, then it went down to 3, and then up to 6 total again. I currently have 2 cellmates, 3 \nof us total.  \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1-4   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 5\n3.  Each pod has 4 toilets, and for males 4 urinals, shared by all of us in the pod. The \ntoilets and urinals are located in common spaces. The cells in the jail are “dry” and have no \ntoilets or urinals. To use the bathroom, we have to leave our cell and go to the toilets.  \n4.  There is no drinking water in the cells either, and we all share two water \nfountains. We have to ask the deputy to leave our cell to go fill up our drinking up at the water \nfountains.   \n5.  In the cells, we share a small space and sleep on triple bunk beds. People sleep \nright on top of each other, within a couple feet. The cells are small and its impossible to stay 6 \nfeet away from other people within our cells.  \n6.  My most recent bunkmate got quarantined for potential COVID-19. He had those \nsame symptoms for a solid two weeks in my cell. He tested negative for flu and strep throat, but \nthey still failed to test him for COVID-19 or remove him for about a week or so.  \n7.  Many people in my pod are sick or have been sick. About a third or more of the \npeople on my pod are sick. People have symptoms like coughing, fevers, being tired and achy, \nsore throat, and shortness of breath. Most of the people sick haven’t been tested for the \ncoronavirus. The jail has told us multiple people within the facility have tested positive for the \ncoronavirus, both staff and inmates. But on my pod I don’t think a single person here has been \ntested for COVID-19 even though many of us are sick. \n8.  Some people don’t have symptoms and aren’t sick, but everyone is housed \ntogether in the same pods and cells. Sick people share the same common spaces, toilets, urinals, \nand other facilities, as those who do not have symptoms. \n9.  Several days ago, the jail started a 23-hour lockdown in our cells, so we get only 1 \nhour of time outside the cells. In my pod, they open two cells for an hour at a time, so as many as \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1-4   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 5\n10 or more of us are out at any given time, sometimes more for the cells that are full of 9 people. \nGuards also let people on lockdown come and go to use the toilet, or for other reasons like to use \nthe phone, so sometime its more like 15-20 people out in the common area.  \n10.  Even after the lockdown, all of us on the pod still share common spaces, use the \nsame toilets, urinals, and restroom facilities, touch the same surfaces, use the same chairs and \ntables in the common areas, use the same phones, and come into contact with one another when \nwe leave our cells.  \n11.  One guy in a cell near me urinated in his drinking cup because they wouldn’t let \nhim out of his cell to use the toilet during a lockdown period.  \n12.  Even after the lockdown, we are still housed in groups with as many as 9 per cell \nwhere staying 6 feet apart is impossible.  \n13.  The jail isn’t removing sick inmates out of the pods unless they have at least four \nsymptoms of COVID-19. Jail staff wrote on a poster that you must have at least four symptoms \nto be pulled out of the pod and quarantined.  \n14.  The jail does not sanitize or disinfect the common areas in between usages, \nincluding the toilet, restroom, and other common areas. Occasionally they will sanitize certain \nareas or a trustee will do a quick wipe-down, but not completely and they do not sanitize or clean \nall areas. Many areas, including the water fountain, toilet stall areas, railings, shower areas, and \nother surfaces almost never get wiped down or sanitized, definitely not in between every usage.  \n15.  The guards are now wearing masks as of a couple days ago. However, the jail \nrefuses to provide masks to us for general use in the pods. They give us masks when an inmate \nleaves the pod, but when we return to the pod they throw it away. We have no masks within the \npod.   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1-4   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 5\n16.

I was told I could not exhaust my administrative remedies any further, and not to file \nany other grievances or to pursue additional steps regarding this grievance.  \nExecuted this 7th day of April, 2020.  \n                s/ Michael Ward \n                __________________________ \nMichael Ward, by and through \ncounsel David G.

See \nHelling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25 (1993). The conditions of confinement Plaintiffs are \ncurrently being held under are likely to cause them to suffer irreparable harm absent \ninterim injunctive relief. Prairie Band of Potawatomi Indians v. Pierce, 253 F.3d 1234, \n  1\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1-5   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 3\n \n1250 (10th Cir. 2001). The balance of harms weighs in favor of granting interim \ninjunctive relief because Plaintiffs’ situation is life and death. Edmisten v. Werholtz, 287 \nF. App’x 728, 732-35 (10th Cir. 2008); see also Thakker, et al. v. Doll, et al., No. 20 C \n0480, Dkt. 47, at 24 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 31, 2020). Finally, the public interest favors stopping \nthe spread of COVID-19, Grand River Enters. Six Nations, Ltd. v. Pryor, 425 F.3d 158, \n169 (2d Cir. 2005), and protecting Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. Kikumura v. Hurley, \n242 F.3d 950, 963 (10th Cir. 2001). \n  Accordingly, this Court issues the following injunctive relief requiring that \nDefendant: \n1.  Physically distance all inmates from one another and staff within the Weld County \nJail, which necessitates at least six feet of distance between individuals at all times;  \n2.  On a daily basis, thoroughly and professionally disinfect and sanitize the Weld \nCounty Jail.  \n3.  Provide hygiene supplies, including supplies to wash hands and disinfect common \nareas, to inmates at all times and free of charge; \n4.  Provide personal protection equipment, including but not limited to masks, to all staff \nmembers and inmates; \n5.  Take particularly heightened precautions with respect to food handling and delivery, \nsuch as ensuring that people who come into contact with food are not displaying any \npotential symptoms of COVID-19, have not recently been in contact with people \ndisplaying potential symptoms of COVID-19, and people who come into contact with \nfood wear appropriate personal protective at all times when in contact with food \n(including but not limited to appropriate masks and gloves); \n  2\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB   Document 1-5   Filed 04/07/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 3\n \n6.  Implement appropriate policies and protocols to identify inmates who are possibly \ncarrying COVID-19 and quarantine those inmates from other individuals; and \n7.  Provide accurate, up-to-date educational and informational materials regarding \nsanitation and prevention of COVID-19, the status of how COVID-19 is affecting the \nfacility including the number of infected inmates and staff, and daily access to news \nreports regarding COVID-19. \nFurther, this Court holds that, in accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(c), bond is \nwaived in this matter because the above-outlined interim relief is in the public interest. \nSee Davis v. Mineta, 302 F.3d 1104, 1126 (10th Cir. 2002). \n \nSO ORDERED, this ___ day of ________ 2020, at Denver, Colorado \n  \n  \n  \n                                                            \nUnited States District Judge \n \n \n  3",

Brimmer\nCivil Case No. 20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC\nTHOMAS CARRANZA,\nJESUS MARTINEZ,\nRICHARD BARNUM,\nTHOMAS LEWIS,\nMICHAEL WARD,\nCOLBY PROPES, and\nCHAD HUNTER,\nPlaintiffs, on their own and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons,\nv.\nSTEVEN REAMS, Sheriff of Weld County, Colorado, in his official capacity,\nDefendant.\n_____________________________________________________________________\nORDER\n_____________________________________________________________________\nThis matter is before the Court on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Forthwith Hearing\nRegarding Defendant’s Non-Compliance with the Court’s Preliminary Injunction [Docket\nNo. 62].\nThis case concerns the Weld County Jail’s housing of medically vulnerable\ninmates1 during the COVID-19 pandemic.  On May 11, 2020, the Court entered a\n1 The Court’s preliminary injunction order defined “medically vulnerable” people\nas “people who are 65 years and older, have chronic lung disease or moderate to\nsevere asthma, have serious heart conditions, are immunocompromised, have severe\nobesity, have diabetes, have chronic kidney disease and undergoing dialysis, or have\nliver disease.”  Docket No. 55 at 5-6 (citing  “People Who Are at Higher Risk for Severe\nIllness,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-\nrisk.html (last accessed May 8, 2020)).\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 78   Filed 07/02/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 4\npreliminary injunction against defendant in his official capacity as Sheriff of Weld\nCounty, Colorado.  Docket No. 55.  The preliminary injunction first required defendant\nto compile a list of medically vulnerable inmates held at the Weld County Jail (the\n“screening procedure”).  Id. at 37-38.  The preliminary injunction also required\ndefendant to institute five policies and procedures in the Jail.  Id. at 38-39.  As relevant\nhere, those requirements included “[a] policy ensuring that, to the maximum extent\npossible considering the Jail’s physical layout, population level, and classification\nneeds, medically vulnerable inmates are ‘socially distanced’ from other inmates housed\nin the Jail” (the “social distancing policy”) and “[a] procedure, as part of the intake of\nnew inmates into the Jail, for medically vulnerable inmates to be single-celled or\notherwise socially distanced, to the maximum extent possible considering the Jail’s\nphysical layout and classification needs, while housed in the transition unit” (the “intake\nprocedure”).  Id. at 38.  Defendant filed a report detailing his compliance with the\npreliminary injunction on May 18, 2020.  Docket No. 60.\nOn May 21, 2020, plaintiffs filed the instant motion, requesting that the Court\nhold a hearing on what they claim is defendant’s non-compliance with the preliminary\ninjunction.  Docket No. 62 at 1.  Specifically, plaintiffs seek a hearing to challenge\ndefendant’s compliance with the preliminary injunction’s screening procedure, social\ndistancing policy, and intake procedure requirements.  Id. at 3.  Defendant opposes the\nmotion.  See Docket No. 66.\nThe Court will deny the motion.  A district court has the authority to conduct\nevidentiary compliance hearings to determine if a party is in compliance with the court’s\n2\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 78   Filed 07/02/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 4\norders.  Cf. Battle v. Anderson, 594 F.2d 786, 789 (10th Cir. 1979) (discussing a district\ncourt’s compliance hearings related to overcrowded penal institutions).  However, the\npurpose of such a hearing in this case is unclear to the Court.  Plaintiffs do not ask that\ndefendant be held in civil contempt for violating the preliminary injunction order.  See\nDocket No. 62; cf. Jeff D. v. Otter, 643 F.3d 278, 285-86 (9th Cir. 2011) (discussing\nwhere a compliance hearing may use the burdens of proof and standard for civil\ncontempt).  And plaintiffs explicitly state that they are not asking the Court to modify the\npreliminary injunction order.  See Docket No. 72 at 1 (“Plaintiffs do not seek to modify\nor expand the Court’s order.”).2  Rather, plaintiffs’ reply clarifies that they seek a\nhearing because of an “imbalance in access to relevant information.”  See id. at 1-2\n(arguing that defendant, who controls the Jail, has “refused to provide” information\nrelevant to determining compliance).  However, plaintiffs fail to explain why this\n2 Despite this representation, it appears to the Court that the impetus for\nplaintiffs’ motion is the perceived inadequacy of the preliminary injunction order, not\ndefendant’s compliance with the order.  For example, plaintiffs contend that the\nscreening questions used by defendant do not “reasonably ensure that the screener\nwill uncover whether the inmate is medically vulnerable.”  Docket No. 62 at 8.  But\ndefendant’s screening questions track the language of the preliminary injunction,\ncompare Docket No. 55 at 37-38 with Docket No. 60 at 2-3, and thus are not evidence\nof defendant’s non-compliance with the preliminary injunction.  Rather, plaintiffs are\narguing that the language of the Court’s preliminary injunction should be modified to, in\ntheir view, more accurately identify medically vulnerable inmates.  Similarly, plaintiffs’\narguments as to defendant’s social distancing policy rely in part on the assertion that\nCOVID-19 testing is now widely available and should be used in the Jail.  Docket No.\n62 at 5-7.  The Court found in the preliminary injunction order that “it [was] not clear\nfrom the record that the Jail has the quantity of test kits necessary to implement a wide-\nranging testing procedure or that the Jail can acquire a sufficient number of test kits.” \nDocket No. 55 at 33.  The Court now requiring the Jail to implement a testing protocol\nwould be a modification of the preliminary injunction order, not an evaluation of\ndefendant’s compliance with the order as it exists. \n3\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00977-PAB-SKC   Document 78   Filed 07/02/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 4\ninformation must be probed at a hearing rather than through the discovery process. \nThus, the Court concludes that a compliance hearing is not necessary at this time.3\nAccordingly, it is\nORDERED that Plaintiffs’ Motion for Forthwith Hearing Regarding Defendant’s\nNon-Compliance with the Court’s Preliminary Injunction [Docket No. 62] is DENIED,\nDATED July 2, 2020.\nBY THE COURT:\n                                                         \nPHILIP A. BRIMMER\nChief United States District Judge\n3 Nothing in this order should be construed as relieving defendant’s obligation to\ncomply with the Court’s preliminary injunction order. \n4",
