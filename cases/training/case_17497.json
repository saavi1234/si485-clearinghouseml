    "summary": "<p>The Committee for the Illinois Democracy Amendment (a ballot initiative organization) and several of its members filed this case under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and state law in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on April 7, 2020. The complaint alleged that requiring the collection of in-person signatures to authorize ballot referenda during the COVID-19 public health emergency violated the plaintiffs' First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. They sought declaratory judgment as well as temporary and permanent injunctive relief. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sued a group of state and local officials and members of the Illinois Board of Elections. The case was assigned to Judge Charles Norgle, Sr.</p>\r\n<p>Two days after filing the complaint, on April 9, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs requested an injunction requiring defendants to create an online forum for signing ballot referenda petitions so Illinois voters can participate in the democratic process while taking public health precautions. They also requested that the number of signatures required for the addition of ballot referenda under Article XIV and Article VII of the Illinois Constitution be reduced by 50%.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants filed a response to the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction on April 15, 2020. Around that time, several individual defendants filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim, lack of standing, and lack of jurisdiction. After a status hearing on April 17, the court denied the plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on April 27, 2020, adding a claim that contended that the Illinois state Constitution required uniform application of ballot access. The plaintiffs also filed a motion for reconsideration, but the court denied the motion shortly thereafter. 2020 WL 2526484. In an opinion written by Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer, the court expressed doubt about the plaintiffs' standing given that they had not demonstrated that their injury is traceable to any of the challenged actions by the defendant. Even if the plaintiffs had standing, Judge Pallmeyer thought it was unlikely that they would succeed on the merits given that the plaintiffs had sixteen months to circulate their petitions for signatures, extending well before the COVID pandemic began.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs appealed the decision to the Seventh Circuit, but on July 8 the Seventh Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision. 964 F.3d 649. In a per curiam opinion, the Seventh Circuit also noted that the plaintiff failed to indicate interest in gathering signatures until a few weeks after the Governor of Illinois issued social-distancing orders. As such, the preliminary injunction was denied.</p>\r\n<p>On August 11, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims. The case is now closed.</p>",

Scholz, and William McGuffage (collectively “State \nBoard of Elections” or “Board”) submit the following memorandum in response to Plaintiffs’ \nEmergency Motion for a Preliminary or Permanent Injunction and Declaration as a Matter of \nLaw. (Dkt. 6.) \nINTRODUCTION \nThough  not  required  to  do  so  by  federal  law,  Illinois  allows  citizens  to  propose \namendments to Article IV of the Illinois Constitution by “a petition signed by a number of \nelectors equal in number to at least eight percent of the total votes cast for candidates for \nGovernor in the preceding gubernatorial election.”  Ill. Const., Art. XIV, § 3.1  Electors are \nprovided an 18-month period in which to gather signatures for their proposed constitutional \n \n1 Plaintiffs’ Complaint contains allegations pertaining to a proposed Evanston local initiative.  These \nallegations are not directed at the State Board of Elections and the Board accordingly takes no position on \na grant of relief as to that petition. \n1 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 21 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 2 of 14 PageID #:137\n \n \namendment to appear on the general election ballot.  Id. (“A petition… shall have been signed by \nthe petitioning electors not more than twenty-four months preceding that general election and \nshall be filed with the Secretary of State at least six months before that general election.”).  \nDespite the generous timeline to collect signatures for ballot initiatives seeking to amend Article \nIV of the Illinois Constitution, Plaintiffs, proponents of the “Illinois Democracy Amendment,” \nhave filed suit on the eve of the May 3, 2020 filing deadline complaining of Illinois’ initiative \nreferendum procedures.  Further, they expect the State, at their behest, to hastily create a new \nonline system to enable them to gather as many as 363,813 “electronic” petition signatures for \nsubmission. \nPlaintiffs  are  not  entitled  to  their  requested  relief  for  a  number  of  reasons.    First, \nPlaintiffs are not entitled to the requested injunctive relief because they are unlikely to succeed \non the merits of their claims: Plaintiffs have no federal right to secure a place on the ballot for \ntheir proposed amendment.  The vast majority of restrictions that Plaintiffs complain of—the \nhandwritten signature requirement, the applicable filing deadline, and number of signatures \nrequired—do not state a First Amendment claim since they pertain only to the state-created right \nof ballot referenda.  Second, given Plaintiffs’ broad and administratively burdensome requests \nfor relief, the hardship to the Board far outweighs the harm to Plaintiffs should no injunction \nissue.  Third, the public interest is not furthered by Plaintiffs’ requested relief; rather, granting \nPlaintiffs’ request could jeopardize citizens’ right to challenge petition signatures—a process \nused to ensure the integrity of Illinois elections for the voters—and upend many important \naspects of Illinois’ election procedures. \nFor these reasons, the court should deny Plaintiffs’ request for the entry of a preliminary \ninjunctive relief. \n2 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 21 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 3 of 14 PageID #:138\n \n \nBACKGROUND \n  Since approximately December 2019, the world has been coping with the outbreak of the \nrespiratory disease COVID-19. (Dkt. 1, ¶¶ 22 – 23.)  In response to this respiratory disease, the \nCenters  for  Disease  Control  issued  guidelines  on  February  27,  2020,  including  the \nrecommendation that people practice social distancing.  (Id. at ¶ 24.)  Weeks later, the Governor \nof Illinois proclaimed the entire state a disaster area and banned gatherings of 1,000 people or \nmore and closed all schools, restaurants, and bars.  (Id. at ¶ 25.)  Shortly thereafter, the President \nof the United States declared a national emergency.  (Id. at ¶ 27.) \n  Since March 20, 2020, the State of Illinois has been subject to orders that residents, with \nsome exceptions, stay at home and maintain a distance of six feet from one another.  (Id. at ¶ 29.)  \nThe order is to remain in effect until April 30, 2020.  (Id. at ¶ 31.)  Plaintiffs allege that \ncirculating initiative petitions is not listed as an essential activity under the Governor’s order and \nthat they are effectively barred from gathering signatures for their proposed ballot initiative, the \nIllinois Democracy Amendment.  (Dkt. 1, ¶¶ 3 – 9, 32.)   \n  According to the Complaint, Plaintiffs must submit 363,813 intiative petition signatures \nto the Illinois Secretary of State by May 3, 2020.  (Id. at ¶ 34.)  Yet the Complaint is noticeably \ndevoid of any allegations discussing Plaintiffs’ progress in the petition circulation process and \ngathering signatures—a process which Plaintiffs were able to begin in November 2018, twenty-\nfour months prior to the upcoming general election, and more than sixteen months prior to the \nGovernor’s “stay at home” order. \n  Though the offending circumstances have existed only a relatively short time during the \nsignature collection period, Plaintiffs nevertheless claim that their rights to petition and political \nspeech are severely burdened in light of the current public health emergency, and request that the \n3 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 21 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 4 of 14 PageID #:139\n \n \nCourt issue a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction not only enjoining or \nmodifying enforcement of Illinois’ petition collection requirements for initiative referenda,2 but \nalso significantly modifying two ballot access provisions and requiring the State to develop and \nimplement an entirely new program for petitions to be submitted electronically on the eve of the \nMay 3 filing deadline.  While Plaintiffs’ Complaint also alleges that Illinois’ petition collection \nrequirements unduly burden and violate their rights under the Equal Protection Clause, they do \nnot address this claim in their motion for preliminary or permanent injunction and declaration as \na matter of law. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nA preliminary injunction is “an extraordinary and drastic remedy, one that should not be \ngranted unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.” Mazurek v. \nArmstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997) (emphasis in original); see also Boucher v. Sch. Bd. of Sch. \nDist. of Greenfield, 134 F.3d 821, 823 (7th Cir. 1998) (same); Roland Mach. Co. v. Dresser \nIndus., 749 F.2d 380, 389 (7th Cir. 1984). For such drastic relief to be granted, “a plaintiff must \nshow three things: (1) without such relief, he will suffer irreparable harm before his claim is \nfinally resolved; (2) he has no adequate remedy at law; and (3) he has some likelihood of success \non the merits.”  Harlan v. Scholz, 866 F.3d 754, 758 (7th Cir. 2017).  If plaintiff can make this \nminimum showing, the court must still “weigh the harm the plaintiff will suffer without an \n \n2 Plaintiffs do not specify the exact “petition collection requirements” they seek to enjoin or modify, but \ncomplain only of the notarized affidavit of the petition circulator that he personally witnessed the \nsignatures of all signers and notary attesting he witnessed the signature of the circulator, the requirement \nthat initiative petition signatures must be handwritten on a paper petition, and that the paper initiative \npetitions pages must be bound and filed in one book with the appropriate officer.  (Dkt. 1, at ¶ 38.)  In \naddition, Plaintiffs seek modifications to their time to file the ballot initiative and to the number of \nsignatures required for ballot access in their requested relief. \n4 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 21 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 5 of 14 PageID #:140\n \n \ninjunction against the harm the defendant will suffer with one.”  Id.  The court must also \nconsider whether granting a preliminary injunction is in the public interest. Id.   \nThe court “must balance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on \neach party of granting or withholding the requested relief,” paying “particular regard for the \npublic consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction.” Winter v. Natural \nRes. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008). \nHere,  Plaintiffs’  burden  is  even  greater  than  usual  because,  rather  than  seeking  to \npreserve  the  status  quo,  they  seek  mandatory  interim  relief  directing  Defendants  to  accept \npetitions to be submitted electronically via names of qualified electors collected by an online \nform created by the Secretary of State, extend the May 3, 2020 deadline for an Article XIV, \nSection 3 referendum to August 3, 2020, and reduce by 50% the number of signatures required to \nqualify Article XIV statewide and Article VII local government initiative referenda for the \ngeneral election ballot or reduce by some percentage necessary to demonstrate substantial public \nsupport.  (Dkt. 6, at 10.)  Plaintiffs also seek a declaratory judgment and permanent injunction.  \n(Id.)  Because a mandatory injunction requires the court to command the defendant to take a \nparticular action, it is “cautiously viewed and sparingly issued.” Knox v. Shearing, 637 F. App’x \n226, 228 (7th Cir. 2016) (quoting Graham v. Med. Mut. of Ohio, 130 F.3d 293, 295 (7th Cir. \n1997)). Mandatory injunctions are “rarely issued,” interlocutory mandatory injunctions are “even \nmore rarely issued,” and neither should be issued “except upon the clearest equitable grounds.” \nW.A. Mack, Inc. v. Gen. Motors Corp., 260 F.2d 886, 890 (7th Cir. 1958). \nPlaintiffs’ burden is also greater here because the interim injunction they request in their \npresent motion would give them substantially all the relief they seek through this lawsuit. See, \ne.g., Boucher, 134 F.3d at 827 n.6 (“A preliminary injunction that would give  the movant \n5 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 21 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 6 of 14 PageID #:141\n \n \nsubstantially all the relief he seeks is disfavored, and courts have imposed a higher burden on a \nmovant in such cases.”); W.A. Mack, Inc., 260 F.2d at 890 (“A preliminary injunction does not \nissue which gives to a plaintiff the actual advantage which would be obtained in a final decree.”). \nIn a ballot access case, the court observed that this factor counted against the plaintiffs because \n“a victory at [the preliminary injunction] stage would effectively win the case for the [plaintiff] \nby putting its candidates on the November ballot regardless of the eventual outcome.” Tripp v. \nSmart, No. 14-CV-0890, 2014 WL 4457200, at *6 (S.D. Ill. Sept. 10, 2014). “A plaintiff should \nnot gain, via preliminary injunction, the actual advantage which would be obtained in a final \ndecree.” Id.  \nARGUMENT  \nI.  Plaintiffs Are Unlikely to Succeed on Their First Amendment Claim. \n \nNowhere does the federal constitution guarantee private citizens “a right to propose \nreferenda or initiatives for any ballot, federal or state.”  Jones v. Markiewicz-Qualkinbush, 892 \nF.3d 935, 937 (7th Cir. 2018).  As the Supreme Court has held, “[b]allots serve primarily to elect \ncandidates, not as forums for political expression.”  Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 \nU.S. 351, 363 (1997).  Procedures to gain ballot access for initatives—a wholly state-created \nright—are subject only to rational basis review so long as the challenged regulations do not \n“distinguish by viewpoint or content.”  Jones, 892 F.3d at 938.  In the absence of any federal \nprotection for citizens to practice direct democracy, “[s]tates allowing ballot initiatives have \nconsiderable leeway to protect the integrity and reliability of the initiative, as they have with \nrespect to election processes generally.”  Buckley v. Am. Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc., \n525 U.S. 182, 191 (1999).   \n6 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 21 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 7 of 14 PageID #:142\n \n \nHowever, where the State chooses to allow a means for direct democracy through ballot \ninitiative, it cannot place “undue hindrances to political conversations and the exchange of ideas” \non those advocating ballot initiatives.  Id. at 192.  But it is only where ballot access provisions \nbecome “invalid interactive speech restrictions” that the First Amendment is transgressed by a \nstate’s measures to ensure the integrity of its ballot.  Id.; see also Semple v. Griswold, 934 F.3d \n1134, 1142 (10th Cir. 2019) (recognizing distinction between laws regulating or restricting \ncommunicative conduct versus laws that govern the process by which legislation is enacted).  \nWhere the state does not restrict the means of communication regarding a ballot proposal, the \nstate “may constitutionally place nondiscriminatory, content-neutral limitations on the plaintiffs’ \nability to initiate legislation.”  Taxpayers United for Assessment Cuts v. Austin, 994 F.2d 291, \n297 (6th Cir. 1993).  But even some burdens on First Amendment rights are acceptable in this \ncontext: a state can enforce measures that do not severely burden First Amendment rights to \nprotect its “substantial interests in regulating the ballot-initiative process.”  Meyer v. Grant, 486 \nU.S. 414, 428 (1988); see also Buckley, 525 U.S. at 204–05. \nAlthough the State’s in-person signature and notarization requirements do not pose an \nundue hindrance to Plaintiffs’ First Amendment right to engage in political conversations and the \nexchange of ideas even in this circumstance, the Board is willing to agree to enjoin these \nrequirements in light of the ongoing public health emergency, so long as copies of handwritten \nsignatures, along with the signer’s printed name and home address, are submitted with Plaintiffs’ \npetition should one ultimately be filed.3  See Tripp v. Scholz, 872 F.3d 857, 869 (7th Cir. 2017) \n \n3 Specifically, the Board is willing to agree to the entry of an order enjoining the requirements in § 5/28-3 \nthat the bottom of each sheet of a petition contains a circulator’s statement “certifying that the signatures \non that sheet of the petition were signed in his or her presence and are genuine,” and that the circulator’s \n7 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 21 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 8 of 14 PageID #:143\n \n \n(upholding Illinois’ per page notarization requirement in context of candidates’ ballot access).  \nBut, despite its willingness to agree to enjoin these provisions of 10 ILCS 5/28-3, the Board \nopposes Plaintiffs’ requested relief to the extent Plaintiffs seek to collect electronic signatures or \nextend the filing deadline set by the Illinois Constitution for their ballot initiative, as both would \ncreate insurmountable obstacles to the State’s mandate to certify any constitutional amendments \nfor the November ballot on August 21, 2020.4  See Ill. Cost. Art. XIV, § 3 (requiring that petition \n“shall be filed with the Secretary of State at least six months before that general election”; 10 \nILCS 5/28-5 (requiring certification of proposed constitutional amendment 74 days before the \ngeneral election).  The Board also opposes Plaintiffs’ request to reduce the number of signatures \nneeded to qualify for the general election ballot, especially in light of Plaintiffs’ own dilatory \naction. \nA.  Since  Ballot  Access  for  Referenda  Is  a  State-Created  Right,  Illinois’ \nHandwritten  Signature  Requirement,  Number  of  Signatures  Required,  and \nFiling Deadline Are Reasonable Regulations that Survive Rational Basis Review. \nUnlike the witnessing requirement, which necessitates in-person communication and thus \narguably restricts methods of communication in the midst of a public health crisis, Illinois’ \nrequirements as to handwritten signatures, the number of signatures required for ballot access, \nand the filing deadline for submission of an initiative are indisputably “a step removed from the \ncommunicative aspect of petitioning.” See Kendall v. Balcerzak, 650 F.3d 515, 525 (4th Cir. \n \nstatement “shall be sworn to before some officer authorized to administer oaths in this State” for the \nNovember 2020 election only, in light of the current public health emergency.   \n \n4  And,  to  the  extent  Plaintiffs  challenge  the  requirement  that  “submission  of  public  questions  to \nreferendum must be filed with the appropriate officer or board” in 10 ILCS 5/28-2, nothing in that statute \ndemands that petitions be filed in-person, and Plaintiffs have made no effort to explain how they are \naggrieved by this provision.  A petition must be filed to be considered and this provision is therefore both \nreasonable and necessary. \n \n8 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 21 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 9 of 14 PageID #:144\n \n \n2011) (internal citations omitted).  Since Illinois’ law requiring a certain number of handwritten \nsignatures for ballot access and the State’s statutory filing deadline in no way touch upon who \ncan engage in political speech or how they may do so, these limitations are subject only to \nrational  basis review under applicable law in  this circuit.   See Jones, 892 F.3d at  937–38 \n(recognizing that since there is no constitutional right to place referenda on ballot, ballot access \nrules for referenda that do not distinguish by viewpoint or content are analyzed under the rational \nbasis standard of review).  \nThe number of signatures required, the handwritten signature requirement, and the filing \ndeadline  are  nondiscriminatory, content-neutral  restrictions that  are rationally related to  the \nState’s interest in validly limiting the number of initiatives that appear on the ballot, which in \nturn improves the chance that each initiative “will receive enough attention, from enough voters, \nto  promote  a  well-considered  outcome.”    Jones,  892  F.3d  at  938.    Amending  the  Illinois \nConstitution effects a virtually permanent change to Illinois’ state government: the signature \nrequirement ensures such changes are properly reserved for amendments with sufficient public \nsupport.  Likewise, the filing deadline ensures that sufficient time is allotted to citizens who wish \nto  challenge  the  procedures  used  to  seek  ballot  access,  including  the  validity  of  petition \nsignatures, before a proposed constitutional amendment appears on the  ballot.  \nThe handwritten nature of the signature in particular plays a crucial role in combatting \nfraud by petition circulators and unknown signers.  See Tripp, 872 F.3d at 869–70.  As federal \ncourts have noted, Illinois is a state “notorious for election fraud.”  Id. at 869 (citations omitted).  \nIllinois’ handwritten signature requirement furthers the State’s interests in avoiding election \nfraud and protecting the political process.  Id.  The handwritten signature requirement (and \nnumber of signatures required) also ensures the State is not “forced to undertake the substantial \n9 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 21 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 10 of 14 PageID #:145\n \n \npreparation and expense of conducting a referendum unless the requisite number of qualified \nvoters have actually signed the petitions and done so only after exercising due deliberation.”  \nKendall, 650 F.3d at 526 (citing Howlette v. City of Richmond, Va., 580 F.2d 704 (4th Cir. \n1978)).  Moreover, handwritten signatures are required for the State Board of Elections to satisfy \nits statutory duty to validate signatures to determine that a sufficient amount of support exists.  \nSee 10 ILCS 5/28-11. The handwritten signature requirement is easily justifiable under the \nrational basis test, especially considering the substantial period of time Plaintiffs had to obtain \nthose signatures.  See Tripp, 872 F.3d at 871 (candidates could reasonably notarize each sheet of \npetition within confines of petitioning window).  Without handwritten signatures, the Board \nwould have no mechanism to guard the ballot intiative against fraudulent signatures or ensure \nthat the Plaintiffs’ proposed initiative did in fact have sufficient public support to appear on the \nballot.  See 10 ILCS 5/28-11 (Board to compare petition signatures with signatures on signers’ \nregistration record cards to determine validity). \nTo the extent Plaintiffs seek to collect electronic signatures for their ballot initative, their \nrequest would leave the State’s ballot initiative procedures in a tumult—especially in conjunction \nwith Plaintiffs’ request to extend the applicable filing deadline.   \nPlaintiffs have no constitutional right for their initative to appear on the November 3, \n2020 general election ballot.  Accordingly, they have no constitutional right to these requested \naccommodations, which unjustifiably sacrifice election integrity and an orderly election process.  \nThat Plaintiffs have provided no evidence that they have collected even a single signature or \nmade any effort to comply with the State’s ballot access procedures prior to this lawsuit merely \ncompounds this conclusion.   \n10 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 21 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 11 of 14 PageID #:146\n \n \nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claims and are \nnot  entitled  to  a  preliminary  injunction  extending  the  May  3,  2020  deadline  for  initiative \npetitions or reducing the number of handwritten signatures needed to qualify for the ballot.  \nII.  Plaintiffs Have Not Demonstrated They Are Likely to Suffer Irreparable \nHarm without Preliminary Relief. \n \nTo the extent Plaintiffs contend they are irreparably harmed by the difficulty they may \nface securing a place on the ballot for their initiative, this provides no grounds for preliminary \ninjunctive  relief:  Plaintiffs  have  no  constitutional  right  to  ballot  access  for  their  proposed \nconstitutional amendment in the first place. And even if one could establish irreparable harm by \nshowing an inability to secure a place on the ballot, Plaintiffs have utterly failed to do so in this \ncase.   \nPlaintiffs’  paltry  allegations  contain  no  assertion  that  the  “Illinois  Democracy \nAmendment” was likely to qualify for the November 3, 2020, general election ballot absent the \ncurrent public health emergency or even that is likely to qualify if Plaintiffs’ requested relief is \ngranted.  Tellingly, only William Morgan is alleged to have begun an initiative petition drive for \na constitutional amendment referendum; all other named Plaintiffs simply “wish” to circulate an \ninitative petition.  (Dkt. 1, at ¶¶ 3 – 7.)  As discussed above, allegations regarding Plaintiffs’ \nefforts and opportunities to circulate petitions in the preceding sixteen months are conspicuously \nabsent. \nGiven Plaintiffs’ ample opportunity to petition and engage in political speech prior to a \npublic health emergency, they have failed to establish that they are likely to suffer irreparable \nharm without preliminary injunctive relief.  It bears noting that there is nothing preventing \nPlaintiffs from attempting to qualify their initiative for the ballot in a future general election. \n11 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 21 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 12 of 14 PageID #:147\n \n \nIII.  The Harm to Defendants and the Public If an Injunction Issues Outweighs \nthe Harm to Plaintiffs Absent an Injunction. \n \nIn  addition  to  Plaintiffs’  own  delays  in  initiating  and  promoting  their  proposed \nconstitutional  amendment,  Plaintiffs’  requested  relief  does  not  account  for  the  substantial \nburdens to the State attendant with their desired modifications.  For instance, although Plaintiffs \nmay believe the May 3, 2020 deadline they seek to change is of little import, any extension of \nsuch could seriously jeopardize the State’s compliance with other applicable election deadlines.   \nThe current May 3, 2020 deadline provides the State Board of Elections with sufficient \ntime to perform its substantial statutory duties following the filing of a proposed constitutional \namendment; thus, extending the filing deadline out would impose a serious burden on the State’s \nresources.  See generally 10 ILCS 5/28; 10 ILCS 5/28-4 (allowing for objections to proposed \nconstitutional amendments within 42 business days after petition is filed and requiring electoral \nboard to hear and pass upon objections); 10 ILCS 5/28-5 (State Board of Elections shall certify \nany proposed constitutional amendment 74 days before the general election); 10 ILCS 5/28-11, \n12  (Board  shall  design  an  alternative  signature  verification  for  proposed  constitutional \namendments  and  determine  if  signatures  are  valid).    Illinois  is  also  bound  by  the  federal \nUniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act to ensure military ballots are timely sent \nto troops overseas.  See 42 U.S.C. 1973-ff-1 et seq.  Granting Plaintiffs’ requested relief imposes \na severe burden on the Board’s ability to satisfy its legal duties and responsibilities.   \nAfter failing to diligently advocate for their initiative, Plaintiffs now attempt to foist a \nmassive administrative burden upon various state agencies to accommodate their own delay.  \nIndeed, it appears that Plaintiffs desire Illinois’ entire procedure to be upset on the eve of an \n12 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 21 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 13 of 14 PageID #:148\n \n \nimportant filing deadline while the general election quickly approaches in order to accommodate \ntheir own delay or inability to garner the requisite public support for their referendum.   \nIn addition to the serious concerns about the constitutionality of ordering the state to \nundertake “open-ended and potentially burdensome obligations,” see Pennhurst State School and \nHosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 29 (1981), ordering the State to wholly redesign its election \nprocesses so near to an election presents the distinct likelihood of confusion, among the state \nagencies responsible for overseeing these processes, voters, and initative proponents alike.  See \nRNC v. DNC, --- S.Ct. ---, 2020 WL 1672702, *1 (U.S. April 6, 2020) (federal courts should \nordinarily not alter election rules on the eve of an election). \nAdditionally, granting an injunction in this scenario would not serve the public interest.  \nAs stated by the Supreme Court, a “[s]tate indisputably has a compelling interest in preserving \nthe integrity of its election process.”  Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 4 (2006).  This interest, \nhowever, is not a uniquely governmental interest: the fairness of the election process is important \nto  voter  confidence,  which  is  in  turn  “essential  to  the  functioning  of  our  participatory \ndemocracy.”  Id.   \nAs explained above, the ballot access procedures that Plaintiffs challenge are safeguards \nagainst voter fraud and overly crowded ballots.  These safeguards not only serve the State’s \ninterest, but also the voting public’s interest.  Tied in with these procedural safeguards, the \nElection Code expressly allows individuals to file objections to petitions proposing constitutional \namendments within 42 business days after the petition is filed.  10 ILCS 5/28-4.  Plaintiffs’ \nrequested relief to modify the filing deadline for their proposed constitutional amendment would \nessentially strip the public of its statutory right to file objections by depriving the Board of the \ntime required to oversee such a process.   \n13 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 21 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 14 of 14 PageID #:149\n \n \nMoreover,  granting  Plaintiffs’  requested  preliminary  relief  could  invite  a  flood  of \nsimilarly  dilatory  initiative  proponents  seeking  to  take  advantage  of  substantially  reduced \nrequirements to qualify various initiatives for the general election.  (See, e.g., Committee for the \nIllinois Democracy Amendment, Statement of Organization, Filed April 9, 2020, attached hereto \nand incorporated as Exhibit A, showing committee creation date of April 1, 2020.) 5   \nGranting  the  drastic  relief  of  enjoining  the  State  from  performing  its  numerous,  \nimportant duties on such sparse evidence does not serve the public interest.  For these reasons, \nPlaintiffs have not met their burden and are not entitled to their requested injunctive relief. \n  CONCLUSION \nWHEREFORE,  the  State  Board  of  Elections  Defendants  respectfully  pray  that  this \nHonorable  Court  enter  an  order  denying  Plaintiffs’  motion  for  a  preliminary  or  permanent \ninjunction and declaration as a matter of law.  \n           \nKWAME RAOUL          BY:  /s/ Erin Walsh          \nIllinois Attorney General         \n              ERIN WALSH \n              Assistant Attorney General \n              General Law Bureau \n              100 West Randolph Street, 13th Floor \n              Chicago, Illinois 60601 \n              (312) 814-6122 \n              ewalsh@atg.state.il.us        \n \n \n5 A court may take judicial notice of “a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it: (1) is \ngenerally known within the trial court’s territorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be accurately and readily \ndetermined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.” Fed.

Yarbrough, Cook County Clerk, in her official capacity, by and \nthrough her counsel, Kimberly M. Foxx, State’s Attorney of Cook County, through her assistant, \nJessica M. Scheller, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) and (b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \nrespectfully  moves  this  Honorable  Court  to  dismiss  Plaintiff’s  Verified  Complaint  for \nEmergency Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (“Complaint”) and in support of her Motion to \nDismiss, states: \nINTRODUCTION \n \nPlaintiffs’ claims against the County Clerk concerning the mechanics of certifying Article \nVII referenda must and should fail, as the Plaintiffs’ concede the County Clerk’s sole role in the \nArticle VII referendum process is to place any Article VII initiative referendum questions on the \nballot after certification.  (Dkt. 1, ¶ 12).  As Plaintiffs acknowledge in their Complaint, certification \nis completed by the clerks of the county municipalities.  Id. Plaintiffs do not allege that the County \nClerk has failed or refused to place a certified (or uncertified) Article VII initiative referendum on \nthe ballot.  Id.  Their active grievances or claims relate exclusively to the certification process;  \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 18 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 2 of 4 PageID #:109\n(Dkt. 1, generally), a process in which the County Clerk has no part.  Id.  For the foregoing reasons, \nas well as those set forth in the concurrently filed Memorandum of Law filed in support of this \nMotion, the County Clerk asks this Court to find that she has neither a role in the certification \nprocess or in this lawsuit and grant relief pursuant to Fed. R. Civ P. 12.  \nBACKGROUND FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n \nPlaintiffs, a group of Illinois registered voters, seek to circulate an initiative petition for \na constitutional amendment to the Illinois Democracy Amendment pursuant to Article XIV, \nSection 3 of the Illinois Constitution. On April 7, 2020, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint [Docket \nNo. 1] against Cook County Clerk Karen A. Yarbrough (“County Clerk”), Secretary of State \nJesse White, Evanston City Clerk Devon Reid, as well as the individual Board Members of the \nIllinois State Board of Elections. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Governor’s \nshelter-in-place  orders,  Plaintiffs  seek  to  enjoin  or  modify  the  Illinois  petition  collection \nrequirements for initiative referendums to be placed on the November 3, 2020 general election \nballot. However, the County Clerk plays no role in the referendum process and Plaintiffs \nconcede that the County Clerk’s sole role in this process is merely to place any Article VII \ninitiative referendum questions certified by the clerks of suburban Cook County municipalities \non the ballot.  (Dkt. 1, ¶ 12). \nPlaintiffs seek an order, among other things, requiring Defendants to allow for petitions \nto be submitted electronically via an online form, that the May 3 deadline be extended to August \n3, 2020, and that the signature requirement be reduced by 50%. (Dkt. 1 at ¶ B, Prayer for Relief). \nPlaintiffs also seek costs and attorneys’ fees against Defendants.  (Id. at ¶E). \nNevertheless, Plaintiffs fail to state a claim against the County Clerk because the Clerk \nhas no role in the referendum process and cannot provide the relief Plaintiffs seek.  Accordingly, \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 18 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 3 of 4 PageID #:110\nbecause no justiciable controversy exists as to the County Clerk, this Court lacks subject matter \njurisdiction and should dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) and also because \nit fails to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).  \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, no justiciable controversy exists between the Plaintiffs and the \nCounty Clerk. Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, to the extent they exist, have not been constrained \nin any way as the Illinois petition requirements have not yet been enforced. Additionally, Cook \nCounty  Clerk  Karen  Yarbrough  was  named  in  the  Complaint  but  clearly  committed  no \nwrongdoing, is not involved in the petition process, and has cannot effectuate the relief Plaintiffs \nseek. As such, Plaintiffs’ Complaint should be dismissed in its entirety. \nWHEREFORE Respondent Karen A. Yarbrough, Cook County Clerk, in her official \ncapacity, respectfully requests that this Court dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint against her, with \nprejudice, pursuant to FED R. CIV.

Compl. [26] ¶¶ 3–8.)1  Plaintiffs wish to qualify these referenda for placement on the \nNovember 3, 2020 general election ballot.  To do so, they must satisfy certain petition collection \nrequirements set forth in the Illinois Constitution and the Illinois Election Code.  On April 7, 2020, \n \n1   Plaintiffs also include the Committee for the Illinois Democracy Amendment, “an \nunincorporated political association registered as a ballot initiative committee with the Illinois State \nBoard of Elections.”  (Id. ¶ 9.)  \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 50 Filed: 05/18/20 Page 2 of 15 PageID #:443\nPlaintiffs filed this lawsuit “to enjoin or modify Illinois petition collection requirements for initiative \nreferendums to be placed on the November 3, 2020 general election ballot . . . in light of the \ncurrent public health emergency caused by the novel coronavirus” and Governor J.B. Pritzker’s \nstay-at-home orders. (Id. ¶ 1.)  Defendants are the Illinois Secretary of State (Jesse White); the \nEvanston City Clerk (Devon Reid); the Cook County Clerk (Karen A. Yarbrough); and members \nof the Illinois State Board of Elections. \n  On April 9, 2020, Plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a preliminary or permanent \ninjunction [4] seeking to modify certain petition collection requirements, extend the deadline for \nsubmitting the initiative petition under Article XIV, Section 3 of the Illinois Constitution, and reduce \nthe  number  of  signatures  required  to  qualify  both  initiative  petitions  for  placement  on  the \nNovember 3, 2020 general election ballot.2  The court held a hearing by telephone on April 17, \n2020 and denied the motion.  Plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for reconsideration “in light of \nnew developments and to correct the record” on April 28, 2020 [29].  The court denied that motion, \nas well, after a further telephone hearing on May 7, 2020.  This order briefly memorializes the \nreasons for that ruling.    \nBACKGROUND \n \nA.  Illinois Election Laws \n  Plaintiffs  seek  to  propose  an  amendment  to  the  Illinois  Constitution,  pursuant  to  a \nprocedure established in Article XIV, Section 3 of the Illinois Constitution.  That Article provides: \nAmendments to Article IV of this Constitution may be proposed by a petition signed \nby a number of electors equal in number to at least eight percent of the total votes \ncast for candidates for Governor in the preceding gubernatorial election. . . . A \npetition shall contain the text of the proposed amendment and the date of the \ngeneral election at which the proposed amendment is to be submitted, shall have \nbeen  signed  by  the  petitioning  electors  not  more  than  twenty-four  months \npreceding that general election and shall be filed with the Secretary of State at \nleast six months before that general election. The procedure for determining the \nvalidity and sufficiency of a petition shall be provided by law. \n \n2   This matter is assigned to the Honorable Charles R. Norgle, Sr.  Judge Pallmeyer \nis addressing this matter as emergency judge, for purposes of this motion only, pursuant to \nparagraph 7 of Third Amended General Order 20-0012. \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 50 Filed: 05/18/20 Page 3 of 15 PageID #:444\n \nILL. CONST. art. XIV, § 3; see also 10 ILCS 5/28-9.  Thus, for their proposed amendment to qualify \nfor placement on the November 3, 2020 general election ballot, Plaintiffs were required to submit \n363,813 initiative petition signatures to the Illinois Secretary of State by May 3, 2020.  (Am. Compl. \n¶ 37.)  Because the petition must be signed by electors “not more than twenty-four months \npreceding [the] general election” and “filed with the Secretary of State at least six months before” \nthat election, the 18-month window in which Plaintiffs were to gather signatures was set to close \nless than four weeks after Plaintiffs initiated this action.   \n  Article VII, Section 11 of the Illinois Constitution authorizes a process for citizens who wish \nto circulate an initiative petition for a local government referendum, as well.  It provides: \n(a) Proposals for actions which are authorized by this Article or by law and which \nrequire approval by referendum may be initiated and submitted to the electors by \nresolution of the governing board of a unit of local government or by petition of \nelectors in the manner provided by law. \n \n(b) Referenda required by this Article shall be held at general elections, except as \notherwise provided by law. Questions submitted to referendum shall be adopted if \napproved  by  a  majority  of  those  voting  on  the  question  unless  a  different \nrequirement is specified in this Article. \n \nILL. CONST. art. VII, § 11; see also 10 ILCS 5/28-7.  For the Evanston local government referendum \nto qualify for placement on the November 3, 2020 general election ballot, Plaintiffs must submit \n2,800 signatures to the Evanston City Clerk by August 3, 2020.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 38.)3 \n  The Illinois Election Code also imposes signature collection requirements.  The Code \nstates that at the bottom of each sheet of an initiative petition, the circulator must add a sworn \nstatement “certifying that the signatures on that sheet . . . were signed in his or her presence.”  10 \nILCS 5/28-3.  It also requires that the original petition sheets, rather than photocopies or \nduplicates, be filed with the appropriate election authorities.  Id.; see also 10 ILCS 5/28-9.  These \nare among the requirements Plaintiffs seek to enjoin.  (See, e.g., Am. Compl., Prayer for Relief.) \n \n3   The parties do not explain how they arrived at this number, but both sides agree \nthat Plaintiffs need 2,800 signatures by August 3, 2020.   \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 50 Filed: 05/18/20 Page 4 of 15 PageID #:445\nB.  Defendants \n  According to Plaintiffs’ allegations, the members of the Illinois State Board of Elections are \nthe only Defendants “empowered to enforce and administer Illinois election laws.”  (Am. Compl. \n¶ 13.)  Plaintiffs allege that the Evanston City Clerk “is authorized to accept filings of local \ngovernment initiative referendums for Evanston pursuant [to] Article VII, Section 11 of [the] Illinois \nConstitution and to certify those referendums to the Cook County Clerk for ballot placement,” and \nthat the Cook County Clerk’s office “is responsible for placing on the election ballot any Article VII \ninitiative referendum questions certified by the clerks of suburban Cook County municipalities, \nincluding the Evanston City Clerk.”  (Id. ¶¶ 11–12.)  Finally, Plaintiffs allege that the Illinois \nSecretary of State “is constitutionally authorized to accept filings of petitions for constitutional \namendments pursuant to Article XIV, Section 3 of the Illinois Constitution.”  (Id. ¶ 10.)   \n  The Illinois Secretary of State, for his part, has explained that he “does not enforce the \npetition collection requirements at issue here.”  (Def. White Resp. (“White Resp.”) [20] at 1.)  \nRather, once proposed constitutional amendments are filed with the Secretary of State, he \n“deliver[s] such petition[s] to the State Board of Elections” within one business day.  (Id. (quoting \n10 ILCS 5/28-9).)  After the State Board of Elections resolves any objections to the petitions (White \nResp.  at  1  (citing  10  ILCS  5/28-4)),  the  Secretary  of  State  “ensures  that  any  proposed \namendments are published in newspapers throughout the State (in multiple languages) and that \npamphlets describing the amendments are mailed to every mailing address in the State (again, \nin multiple languages).”  (White Resp. at 1.)  The Secretary of State’s deadline for publishing the \nproposed amendments in newspapers and mailing the related pamphlets is “at least one month \nbefore the election (October 3, 2020).”  (Decl. of Amy Williams in Supp. of White Resp. (“Williams \nDecl.” [20-1] ¶¶ 3, 8.)  To meet the October 3, 2020 deadline, the Secretary of State must “start[] \nworking in early May, shortly after the petition filing deadline.”  (Id. ¶ 4.) \n   \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 50 Filed: 05/18/20 Page 5 of 15 PageID #:446\n \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Petition Circulation Efforts \n  Of the seven Plaintiffs, just one—William Morgan—claims to have “begun an initiative \npetition drive” before filing this lawsuit.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 3.)  The remaining Plaintiffs allege that \nthey “wish[ ] to circulate” petitions.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 3–8.)  And although Plaintiff Morgan alleges \nthat he has begun the process, he offered no evidence showing when he began those efforts or \nhow many signatures he has collected.  (See id.; see generally Morgan Decl., Ex. 1 to Compl. [1-\n2], Ex. 1 to Am. Compl. [26-1].)  The court notes that Morgan’s ballot initiative committee was \ncreated on April 1, 2020, eight days before he filed this suit.  (See Ex. A to Def. Bd. of Elections \nResp.  [21-1].)    The  remaining  Plaintiffs  also  offer  no  evidence  concerning  the  number  of \nsignatures, if any, they have collected to date for the relevant initiative petitions.  (See generally \nExs. 2–6 to Compl. [1-3–1-7]; Exs. 2–6 to Am. Compl. [26-2–26-6].) \n  Plaintiffs contend that they could not have started collecting signatures for the Illinois \nDemocracy Amendment before March 31, 2020.  (See Plaintiffs’ Reply in Supp. of Emergency \nMot. for Reconsideration (“Reply”) [36] ¶ 11.)4  That was the deadline for the Illinois Joint \nCommission on Lobbying and Ethics Reform—which the Illinois General Assembly created in \nNovember  2019—to  “examin[e]  current  Illinois  legislation  regarding  ethics  reform,  solicit[] \nfeedback from experts and the general public, and release[] a final report with its review and \nrecommendations.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 21.)  According to Plaintiffs, the Commission determined that \n“due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” it could not meet its deadline and “would therefore make no \nrecommendations on lobbying and ethics reform.”  (Id. ¶ 30.)  This announcement, Plaintiffs \nargue, was the “impetus” for the initiative petition concerning the Illinois Democracy Amendment.  \n(Reply ¶ 11; Apr. 17, 2020 Hrg. Tr. at 7:15–19.) \n   \n \n4   Plaintiffs  do  not  advance  this  argument  for  the  Evanston  local  government \nreferendum. \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 50 Filed: 05/18/20 Page 6 of 15 PageID #:447\nDISCUSSION \nA.  Standing \n  “[A] plaintiff seeking relief in federal court must first demonstrate that he has standing to \ndo so.”  Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1923 (2018).  To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff \nmust show (1) an “injury in fact”; (2) a sufficient “causal connection between the injury and the \nconduct complained of”’ and (3) a “likel[ihood]” that the injury will be “redressed by a favorable \ndecision.”  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992).  The court assumes that  \nPlaintiffs have sufficiently alleged an injury in fact:  when they filed this suit on April 8, the \nconditions created by the Governor’s stay-at-home order largely defeated any chance they might \notherwise have had to collect, by May 3, 2020, the signatures needed to put their constitutional \namendment referendum on the general election ballot.  Indeed, Plaintiffs have now missed that \ndeadline.  At the outset of this lawsuit, there was also a risk that the stay-at-home order could be \nextended beyond May 30, 2020 and eliminate any chance Plaintiffs might otherwise have had to \ncollect enough signatures for the Evanston local government referendum by August 3, 2020—\nthough there is a strong case to be made that this risk is too minimal or speculative to confer \nstanding.  The court gives Plaintiffs the benefit of the doubt on the injury-in-fact requirement.  \nPlaintiffs fall short on the other requirements for standing, however.  \n  First, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that their injury is traceable to the challenged \nactions of any of the Defendants.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  Plaintiffs had 18 months to collect \nsignatures for both referendums, but, other than Morgan, none took any action for the first 16 \nmonths.  And although Morgan alleges that he began collecting signatures before March 31, 2020, \nhe does not state when he began or how many signatures he has collected.  Regarding the Illinois \nDemocracy  Amendment,  Plaintiffs  blame  their  delay  on  the  Commission’s  failure  to  make \nrecommendations on lobbying and ethics reform by March 31, 2020.  (See Reply ¶ 11; Apr. 17, \n2020 Hrg. Tr. at 7:15–19.)  But even if the Commission’s failure to make recommendations came \nas  a  surprise,  Plaintiffs  could  have  recognized  the  possibility  that  the  Commission’s \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 50 Filed: 05/18/20 Page 7 of 15 PageID #:448\nrecommendations would not be adopted, or would not align perfectly with reforms proposed in \nthe Illinois Democracy Amendment.  Plaintiffs could have begun the petition process months ago \nbut most chose not to do so, and Morgan’s efforts appear to be thin.   \n  Plaintiffs attempt to excuse their inaction by observing that in a handful of past election \ncycles,  petition  circulators  collected  all  required  signatures  in  the  two  months  before  the \ndeadline—the approximate amount of time that remained to qualify the Illinois Democracy \nAmendment for the general election ballot before the stay-at-home order commenced.  (See, e.g., \nMay 7, 2020 Hrg. Tr. [39], at 11:15–21 (citing Vaught Decl., Ex. 3 to Am. Compl. [26-3] ¶ 5).)   But \nthe Governor did not issue his stay-at-home order until mid-March, well less than two months \nbefore the May 3, 2020 deadline.  Nothing in the record supports an inference that, absent that \norder, Plaintiffs would have been able to collect necessary signatures in the weeks between the \nissuance of the order and May 3.  Morgan, the only Plaintiff who had begun the process at all, \noffered no evidence that he had collected a single signature before this suit was filed in early April.   \n  Plaintiffs have further undermined any argument that the Defendants’ actions are causally \nconnected to their injuries by repeatedly contending that the stay-at-home order is the “state \naction” that itself violated the Constitution in that the order “basically clipped off two” of the 18 \nmonths allotted for signature collection.  (May 7, 2020 Hrg. Tr. at 7:11–16; 13:20–14:2.)  But it \nwas Governor Pritzker, not the Illinois Board of Election Commissioners, who imposed the stay-\nat-home order, and Plaintiffs have not named the Governor as a Defendant.  Plaintiffs’ claims \nagainst the remaining Defendants are infirm for other reasons, as well:  Neither the Evanston City \nClerk, the Cook County Clerk, nor the Illinois Secretary of State is authorized to administer or \nenforce Illinois election laws.  As the Evanston City Clerk points out, the law allows it to perform \nonly one function in the referendum process:  “allow the petitions to be filed.”  (Def. Reid Resp. \n[14] at 6.)  The Evanston City Clerk has never argued that it “will not accept petitions signed by a \nnumber of qualified electors.”  (Id.)  Similarly, the Cook County Clerk states that it “has no role in \nthe  referendum  process.”    (Def.  Yarbrough  Resp.  [17]  at  2–3.)    It  merely  places  certified \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 50 Filed: 05/18/20 Page 8 of 15 PageID #:449\nreferendum questions on the ballot.  (See Am Compl. ¶ 12; Def. Yarbrough Mot. to Dismiss [19] \nat 6 (stating that the County Clerk “is not authorized to accept filings of initiative referendums,” \n“certify such referendums,” or “enforce and administer Illinois election laws with respect to the \nfiling of referendums”).)  And the Secretary of State is responsible only for delivering petitions to \nthe Board, publishing proposed amendments in newspapers, and mailing pamphlets describing \nthose amendments.   \n  The court thus has grave doubts concerning Plaintiffs’ standing to sue any of the named \nDefendants.  For the sake of completeness, however, the court addresses the merits of Plaintiffs’ \nrequest for injunctive relief, as well. \nB.  Preliminary Injunction \n  Temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions are extraordinary and drastic \nremedies that “should not be granted unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden \nof persuasion.”  Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997) (quotation omitted).  A party \nseeking such relief must “establish that it has some likelihood of success on the merits; that it has \nno adequate remedy at law; [and] that without relief it will suffer irreparable harm.”  Planned \nParenthood of Ind. & Ky., Inc. v. Comm’r of Ind. State Dep’t of Health, 896 F.3d 809, 816 (7th Cir. \n2018).  If the moving party meets this burden, the court must then “weigh the harm that the plaintiff \nwill suffer absent an injunction against the harm to the defendant from an injunction.”  Id.  Courts \nin the Seventh Circuit use a “sliding scale approach”—the less likely the plaintiff is to win, the \nmore that the “balance of harms [must] weigh in his favor.”  Valencia v. City of Springfield, 883 \nF.3d 959, 966 (7th Cir. 2018).  The court must finally consider whether a preliminary injunction or \ntemporary restraining order “is in the public interest, which entails taking into account any effects \non non-parties.”  Courthouse News Serv. v. Brown, 908 F.3d 1063, 1068 (7th Cir. 2018).  In this \ncase, some of Plaintiffs’ requests for injunctive relief would require Defendants to act affirmatively.  \nSuch “mandatory” injunctions are “cautiously viewed and sparingly issued.”  Graham v. Med. Mut. \nof Ohio, 130 F.3d 293, 295 (7th Cir. 1997). \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 50 Filed: 05/18/20 Page 9 of 15 PageID #:450\n  1.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits / Irreparable Harm \n  Plaintiffs challenge the Illinois requirements for circulating and qualifying initiative petitions \nfor the November 3, 2020 ballot as a violation of their First Amendment rights to petition and \nspeech.5  Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that, because circulating initiative petitions is not an \nessential activity under the Governor’s stay-at-home order, the combination of the COVID-19 \npandemic and the Governor’s order make it impossible for initiative petition circulators to gather \nand personally witness handwritten signatures.  (Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj. [6] at 5.)  Therefore, \nPlaintiffs  argue,  certain  Illinois  petition  requirements—including  handwritten  signatures,  a \nnotarized  affidavit  from  the  petition  circulator  confirming  that  he  personally  witnessed  the \nsignatures (“witness requirement”), the May 3, 2020 filing deadline, the need to obtain 363,813 \nsignatures, and the need to bind and file all petition pages in one book (“binding requirement”)—\nseverely limit their ability to exercise their First Amendment rights under the circumstances.  (Id. \nat 6.)   \n  There is no federal constitutional right to place referenda on the ballot.6  Jones v. \nMarkiewicz-Qualkinbush, 892 F.3d 935, 937 (7th Cir. 2018); see also Protect Marriage Ill. v. Orr, \n463 F.3d 604, 606 (7th Cir. 2006) (“The ballot is not a traditional public forum for the expression \nof ideas and opinions.”).  If a state chooses, however, to open its ballots to referenda or initiatives \nproposed by its citizens, it may not impose unconstitutional conditions on that state-created right.  \n \n5   Plaintiffs’  Complaint  [1]  challenges  the  Illinois  petition  requirements  on  First \nAmendment and equal protection grounds, and their Amended Complaint [26] added a claim \nunder the Illinois Constitution.  Their motion for a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining \norder raises only the issue that these state laws violate their First Amendment rights under the \ncircumstances.  \n \n6   For this reason, among others, Plaintiffs’ case is distinguishable from Libertarian \nParty of Ill. v. Pritzker, No. 20 C 2112, 2020 WL 1951687 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 23, 2020), involving state \nrestrictions on candidate access to the ballot.  See Stone v. Bd. of Election Comm’rs for City of \nChicago, 750 F.3d 678, 681 (7th Cir. 2014) (quoting Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 786 \n(1983))  (“‘[T]he  impact  of  candidate  eligibility  requirements  on  voters  implicates  basic \nconstitutional rights,’ to associate politically with like-minded voters and to cast a meaningful \nvote.”). \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 50 Filed: 05/18/20 Page 10 of 15 PageID #:451\nJones, 892 F.3d at 937 (citing Meyer v. Grant, 486 U.S. 414, 424 (1988)).  In this context, the \nSupreme Court distinguishes between “valid ballot-access provisions” and “invalid interactive \nspeech restrictions” that “unjustifiably inhibit the circulation of ballot-initiative provisions.”  Buckley \nv. Am. Constitutional Law Found., Inc., 525 U.S. 182, 192, 205 (1999).  The circulation of a petition \nto place a referendum on the ballot “involves the type of interactive communication concerning \npolitical change that is appropriately described as ‘core political speech.’”  Meyer, 489 U.S. at \n421–22.  When a state’s restriction on a citizen’s ability to circulate a petition “significantly inhibit[s] \ncommunication with voters about proposed political change,” it must, like all “severe burdens” on \nspeech, “be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.”  Buckley, 525 U.S. at 192 n. \n12.  On the other hand, there must “be a substantial regulation of elections if they are to be fair \nand honest and if some sort of order, rather than chaos, is to accompany the democratic \nprocesses.”  Id. at 187 (quoting Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 730 (1974)).  Accordingly, “[s]tates \nallowing ballot initiatives have considerable leeway to protect the integrity and reliability of the \ninitiative process.”  Id. at 191.  Unless a procedure designed to control access to the ballot \ndistinguishes by viewpoint or content, a court’s review of a ballot-access restriction is limited to \ndetermining whether the rule has a rational basis.  Jones, 892 F.3d at 938.   \n  In current circumstances (of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Governor’s order requiring \nsocial distancing), the combination of the handwritten signature, number of signatures, and \nwitness requirements arguably inhibit communicative conduct—specifically, Plaintiffs’ ability to \ncirculate petitions.  The filing deadline and binding requirements, in contrast, do not inhibit \nPlaintiffs’ ability to circulate petitions even under the current circumstances, nor do they affect \nwho may engage in political speech.  Instead, these provisions establish procedures that limit \nPlaintiffs’ access to the ballot and are therefore subject to the reasoning laid out by the Seventh \nCircuit  in  Jones.    See  McIntyre  v.  Ohio  Elections  Comm’n,  514  U.S.  334,  345  (1995) \n(distinguishing between statutory provisions that “control the mechanics of the electoral process” \nand “regulation[s] of pure speech”).  Because Plaintiffs do not argue that these restrictions \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 50 Filed: 05/18/20 Page 11 of 15 PageID #:452\ndistinguish by viewpoint or content, the filing deadline and binding requirements are subject to \nrational basis review.  See Jones, 892 F.3d at 938.  Defendants Board of Elections and White \narticulate numerous legitimate state objectives that justify these restrictions.  (See Def. Board of \nElections Resp. (“Board Resp.”) [21] at 9–10; White Resp. at 1.)  Plaintiffs have not explained \nhow  these  two  restrictions—designed  to  ensure  sufficient  public  support  for  a  potentially \npermanent change to the Illinois Constitution, to prevent fraud, and to ensure that the state can \nefficiently administer the election—have somehow become irrational in light of the COVID-19 \npandemic.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits of \ntheir challenge to the filing deadline and binding requirements.  \nPlaintiffs’ challenge to the handwritten signature, number of signatures, and witness \nrequirements is more weighty because, under the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, the \ncombined effect of these requirements arguably limit Plaintiffs’ ability to circulate petitions—a type \nof core political speech.  See Meyer, 489 U.S. at 422.  The Court in Meyer explained two ways in \nwhich a state law governing initiative petition circulation may restrict political expression.  “First, it \nlimits the number of voices who will convey [a] message,” therefore limiting “the size of the \naudience they can reach.”  Id. at 422–23.  In ordinary circumstances, the handwritten signature, \nnumber of signature, and witness requirements do not limit the number of persons who may \ncirculate a petition, and may in fact increase the amount of one-on-one communication between \npetition circulators and voters.  But during the COVID-19 pandemic, petition circulators will \nunderstandably be unwilling to seek out signatures, and potential supporters will be unwilling to \nventure out to sign them.   These circumstances are caused by the virus itself, however, not by \nstate law.  It is only when state law prevents certain individuals from circulating petitions that First \nAmendment harms are implicated.  See, e.g., id. at 428 (invalidating a state prohibition against \npaying circulators of initiative petitions).   \nThe second type of harm discussed in Meyer occurs when a law “makes it less likely that \n[petition circulators] will garner the number of signatures necessary to place the matter on the \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 50 Filed: 05/18/20 Page 12 of 15 PageID #:453\nballot, thus limiting their ability to make the matter the focus of statewide discussion.”  Id. at 423.  \nPlaintiffs contend that they have been unable to collect any signatures since the Governor’s stay-\nat-home order took effect on March 20, 2020 and therefore that the witness and handwritten \nsignature requirements inhibit their ability to obtain the necessary 363,813 signatures.  (Pls.’ Mot. \nfor Prelim. Inj. at 5–6.)  For reasons described earlier, however, the court is unable to conclude \nthat it is state action that has precluded Plaintiffs’ efforts.  They have been free to circulate and \ngather signatures since November 2018, yet of the seven Plaintiffs, just one had even begun the \neffort prior to the Governor’s order, and that single Plaintiff (Morgan) offered no evidence that he \nhad collected any signatures prior to the issuance of that Order.  Morgan’s own ballot initiative \ncommittee was not created until April 1, 2020.  (See Ex. A to Board Resp. [21-1].)   \nPlaintiffs have not established that it is state law, rather than their own 16-month delay, \nthat imposes a severe burden on their First Amendment rights, even in the context of the COVID-\n19 pandemic.  Cf. Stone, 750 F.3d at 682 (“What is ultimately important is . . . whether a \nreasonably diligent candidate could be expected to be able to meet the requirements and gain a \nplace on the ballot.”).  Indeed, with respect to the City of Evanston, Plaintiffs have presented no \nevidence of any severe burden; the deadline for gathering signatures there does not expire until \nAugust 3.  The court concludes Plaintiffs have not established a likelihood of success on their \nclaims or that the balance of hardships, discussed below, favors this motion.   \n  2.  Balance of Harm and Public Interest \n  Even if putting a constitutional amendment to the voters is not a First Amendment right, \nsee Jones, 892 F.3d at 937, the court acknowledges that Plaintiffs have an interest in seeing their \nreferenda on the ballot in November.   As previously discussed, however, the harm they have \nalleged appears speculative in light of the absence of evidence that they have collected any \nsignatures or made even negligible progress toward qualifying for the ballot prior to entry of the \nGovernor’s order. That is, it is not apparent that Plaintiffs had any realistic chance of complying \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 50 Filed: 05/18/20 Page 13 of 15 PageID #:454\nwith all of the ballot initiative requirements even before the Governor’s COVID-19-related orders \nor that issuing the injunction they request will actually enable them to achieve their goal. \n  And despite Plaintiffs’ contention to the contrary, the relief they request may appears likely \nto result in concrete harm to Defendants.  In a similar case in the Central District of Illinois, the \ncourt noted that “[t]he Illinois constitution and state and federal law set out duties that must be \nperformed by the ISBE Defendants and the Secretary of State.”  Bambenek v. White, No. 20 C \n3107, 2020 WL 2123951, at *5 (C.D. Ill. May 1, 2020) (citing 42 U.S.C. 1973-ff-1 et seq.; ILL. \nCONST. art. XIV, § 3; 10 ILCS 5/28-5).  Plaintiffs’ requested extension “would make it extremely \ndifficult, if not impossible, for those defendants to fulfill their constitutionally and statutorily \nmandated obligations.”  Id.  As Defendants have explained, much time is needed to verify \nsignatures and ensure that objections to them can be filed and reviewed.  See 10 ILCS 5/28-4 \n(rules regarding objections to proposed constitutional amendments).  Additional statutory duties \ninclude publishing the proposed amendment in newspapers statewide at least one month before \nthe election and creating a pamphlet, which explains the proposed amendment and includes \narguments for and against it, that is mailed to every address in the state at least one month before \nthe election.  (Williams Decl. ¶¶ 3–12.)  The newspaper publication and pamphlets must be \ntranslated into many different languages, the process for which is supposed to begin in mid-May.  \n(Id.)  Delays may also jeopardize the state’s ability to comply with the Uniformed and Overseas \nCitizens Absentee Voting Act, which requires that military ballots be mailed to troops forty-five \ndays prior to the election.  42 U.S.C. § 1973-ff-1 et seq. \nPreventing Defendants from being able to fulfill these statutory duties not only imposes \nharm on them but also appears contrary to the public interest.  See Planned Parenthood of Ind., \n699 F.3d at 972 (district courts should “also evaluate[ ] the effect of an injunction on the public \ninterest”).  Plaintiffs contend that their requested relief is in the public interest because “injunctions \nprotecting First Amendment freedoms are always in the public interest.”  Am. Civil Liberties Union \nof Ill. v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583, 590 (7th Cir. 2012) (quoting Christian Legal Soc'y v. Walker, 453 \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 50 Filed: 05/18/20 Page 14 of 15 PageID #:455\nF.3d 853, 859 (7th Cir. 2006)).  But as discussed above, Plaintiffs have no First Amendment right \nfor their amendment to appear on the ballot.  And verifying the integrity of potential constitutional \namendments submitted to the voters, sending Illinoisans serving in the military overseas their \nballots on time,  and ensuring that voters can review the proposed amendment before the election \nin newspapers and pamphlets—all time-consuming and onerous processes for the state—are \nalso in the public interest.  Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 4 (2006) (“Confidence in the integrity \nof our electoral processes is essential to the functioning of our participatory democracy.”).   \n  Plaintiffs are correct that this court and those in other jurisdictions have granted relief, \nsimilar in part to what Plaintiffs request here, in other election law challenges generated by state \nstay-at-home orders.  See, e.g., Libertarian Party of Ill. v. Pritzker, No. 20 C 2112, 2020 WL \n1951687  (N.D.  Ill.  April  23,  2020)  (easing  ballot  access  requirements  for  new  party  and \nindependent candidates). Significantly, however, for new party and independent candidates in \nIllinois, “the ‘window’ for gathering such signatures opened at nearly the same time that Governor \nPritzker first imposed restrictions.”  Id. at *4.  In contrast, Plaintiffs here were free to begin \ncollecting signatures  for  their  referenda  in  November  2018—more  than  a  year before  any \ncoronavirus-related disruptions had begun.  See 10 ILCS 5/28-9 (emphasis added) (“Such petition \n[for proposed amendments] shall have been signed by the petitioning electors not more than 24 \nmonths preceding the general election . . . .”).  Moreover, constitutional amendments are subject \nto several requirements—such as the preparation of explanatory pamphlets, translation into \nseveral languages, see Williams Decl., and publication in newspapers statewide one month \nbefore the election, 5 ILCS 20/2—that do not apply to new party or independent candidates.  \n  Plaintiff Morgan here began the referendum process at the eleventh hour, and the other \nPlaintiffs have not effectively begun it at all.  They have not made a compelling showing that the \ncourt should require public officials to upend the statutory and constitutional timetable for that \nprocess.  In sum, neither the balance of harms nor the public interest favors granting Plaintiffs’ \nrequested injunction. \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 50 Filed: 05/18/20 Page 15 of 15 PageID #:456\nCONCLUSION \n  For  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  court  denies  Plaintiffs’  Emergency  Motion  for \nReconsideration in Light of New Developments and to Correct the Record [29]. \n \n              ENTER: \n \nDate:  May 18, 2020         ____________________________ \n              REBECCA R.

Under current circumstances, the Plaintiffs and Illinois voters are forced to \nchoose  between  their  health  and  their  rights  to  petition  and  vote.  Reforms  and \nmodifications  to  Illinois’  initiative  referendum  election  procedures  in  light  of  the \nCOVID-19 pandemic are appropriate. The key facts in support of this action are set \nforth in Plaintiffs’ Verified Complaint. Dkt. 001.  \nPRELIMINARY EQUITABLE RELIEF STANDARD \n  To determine whether a preliminary injunction should be granted, the Court must \nweigh the following four factors: (1) the likelihood the Plaintiffs will succeed on the \nmerits; (2) the potential for irreparable harm to the Plaintiffs if the injunction is denied; \n(3) the balance of relevant impositions — the hardship to the Defendants if enjoined as \ncontrasted with the hardship to the Plaintiffs if no injunction issues; and (4) the effect of \nthe Court's ruling on the public interest. Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. \n7, 20 (2008). \n \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 6 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 5 of 12 PageID #:49\nARGUMENT \nAll four factors necessary for a preliminary injunction weigh in favor of this Court \nentering an immediate order in favor of the Plaintiffs as set forth below in the prayer for \nrelief. \nI.  The Plaintiffs are Likely to Succeed on the Merits. \n \nThe United States Supreme Court has held that “Petition circulation . . . ‘is core \npolitical speech,’ because it involves ‘interactive communication concerning political \nchange.’”  Buckley  v.  American  Constitutional  Law  Foundation,  Inc.,  525  U.S.  182,  186 \n(1999).  “First Amendment protection for such interaction,” therefore, is at its “zenith.” \nId. The right to petition is further enshrined in the Illinois Constitution. Article XIV, \nSection 3 of the Illinois Constitution provides that \nAmendments to Article IV of this Constitution may be proposed by a petition \nsigned by a number of electors equal in number to at least eight percent of the \ntotal votes cast for candidates for Governor in the preceding gubernatorial \nelection. Amendments shall be limited to structural and procedural subjects \ncontained  in  Article  IV.  A  petition  shall  contain  the  text  of  the  proposed \namendment  and  the  date  of  the  general  election  at  which  the  proposed \namendment  is  to  be  submitted,  shall  have  been  signed  by  the  petitioning \nelectors not more than twenty-four months preceding that general election and \nshall be filed with the Secretary of State at least six months before that general \nelection.  The  procedure  for  determining  the  validity  and  sufficiency  of  a \npetition shall be provided by law. If the petition is valid and sufficient, the \nproposed amendment shall be submitted to the electors at that general election \nand shall become effective if approved by either three-fifths of those voting on \nthe amendment or a majority of those voting in the election. \n \nMoreover, Article VII, Section 11 of the Illinois Constitution provides that  \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 6 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 6 of 12 PageID #:50\n(a)  Proposals for actions which are authorized by this Article or by law and \nwhich require approval by referendum may be initiated and submitted to the \nelectors by resolution of the governing board of a unit of local government or \nby petition of electors in the manner provided by law. \n (b)  Referenda required by this Article shall be held at general elections, except \nas otherwise provided by law. Questions submitted to referendum shall be \nadopted if approved by a majority of those voting on the question unless a \ndifferent requirement is specified in this Article. \n \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional rights to petition and political speech are well established. \nIn 1980, the Illinois Supreme Court declared that “clearly, the rights of those who seek \nto exercise their constitutional privilege to initiate an amendment to that constitution \nare intertwined with the rights of those who vote thereon.” Coalition for Political Honesty v \nState Board of Elections II, 83 Ill. 2d 230, 248 (1980). The Court further stated that strict \nscrutiny  is  appropriate  regarding  Illinois’  legislative  restrictions  on  the  Article  XIV \nimitative right. Furthermore, the free and equal elections clause of Article III, Section 3 \nof  the  Illinois  Constitution  gives  constitutional  priority  to  Illinois’  public  policy  of \nencouraging the full and effective participation of the entire electorate. Any plan or \ndesign whose result might impede or frustrate full participation in the electoral process \ncannot endure. See Orr v. Edgar, 283 Ill. App3d. 1088, 1097 (1st Dist. 1996).   \nThe current health crisis and the Governor’s executive orders to shelter in-place and \nto social distance, however, make it impossible for Plaintiffs and others to comply with \nthe requirements and procedures necessary to exercise their right to petition. Because \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 6 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 7 of 12 PageID #:51\nthe State currently prohibits everyone from gathering in public, Plaintiffs simply have \nno way to gather the 363,813 signatures they need before the May 3, 2020 deadline.1  \nThe  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  injunctive  relief  because  there  is  no  legal  option \navailable  to  them  by  which  they  could  exercise  their  constitutional  rights  without \nendangering their lives or the lives of others. The State has refused or neglected to make \nany  modification  to  the  current  petition  collection  requirements  thereby  effectively \nstripping the Plaintiffs of their rights, along with the rights of innumerable Illinois \nvoters who would be deprived of the opportunity to vote on important referendums.  \nSimply put, the State is constitutionally required to provide an alternate procedure by \nwhich its citizens can place initiative referendums on the general election ballot and it \nhas failed to do so here.  \nBecause the Plaintiffs have no possible way to exercise their constitutional rights, the \nburdens imposed by the State can only be described as severe. As stated by the Seventh \nCircuit, “the severity of the burden imposed is what determines whether strict scrutiny \nor a less demanding level of review applies.” Stone v. Board of Election Com’rs for City of \nChicago, 750 F.3d 678, 681 (7th Cir. 2014). “Restrictions that ‘severely’ burden the exercise \nof  constitutional  rights  must  be  ‘narrowly  drawn  to  advance  a  state  interest  of \ncompelling importance.’” Lee v. Keith, 463 F.3d 763, 768 (7th Cir. 2006). Although the \nState  may  have  a  compelling  interest  to  justify  its  executive  orders,  the  complete \n                                                           \n1 Copies of the petitions the Plaintiffs wish to circulate are attached hereto as Exhibit A.  \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 6 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 8 of 12 PageID #:52\nprohibition on in-person petitioning, and therefore the complete exclusion of initiative \nreferendums from the general election ballot, is not narrowly tailored.  \nThat the State’s current procedures are not narrowly tailored is most evident when \ncontrasted with the voluntary actions of other states during this pandemic. For instance, \non  March  19,  2020,  the  Governor  of  New  Jersey  issued  an  executive  order  to  the \nSecretary of State to implement online petitioning and signature collection.2 On April 2, \n2020, Florida’s Secretary of State signed an emergency order allowing for the collection \nof petition signatures online.3 Moreover, the Arizona Secretary of State has provided an \nonline petitioning mechanism for candidates since 2015 and has recently stated she \n“wouldn’t oppose” use of that system for ballot measures during the pandemic as a \n“reasonable  option  for  protecting  public  health  and  supporting  continuity  in  our \ndemocratic  processes.”4  On  March  14,  2020,  the  Governor  of  New  York  issued  an \nexecutive order reducing the required number of petition signatures for all petitions for \nballot  access  to  30%  of  the  state  threshold.5  It  is  evident,  therefore,  that  narrowly \ntailored options which protect both the health of the general public as well as their \nconstitutional rights are readily available and have been voluntarily implemented by \nother states. Thus far, Illinois has failed to follow suit which this Court can, and should, \nremedy with injunctive and declaratory relief.  \n                                                           \n2 https://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/assets/pdf/candidate/EO-105.pdf \n3 https://dos.myflorida.com/media/702874/1ser20-2.pdf \n4 https://thefulcrum.us/voting/coronavirus-ballot-initiatives \n5 https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-signs-executive-order-\ntemporarily-modifying-election \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 6 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 9 of 12 PageID #:53\nII.  The Plaintiffs are Suffering, and Will Continue to Suffer, Irreparable Harm if the \nInjunction is Denied. \n \nUnder the current circumstances, the Plaintiffs are prohibited from approaching \nvoters for the purposes of collecting their signatures. The inability to collect signatures \nto place important  referendums on the general election ballot no  doubt constitutes \nirreparable harm. It is well settled that “the loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even \nminimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.” Elrod v. Burns, \n427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976); Murphy v. Zoning Comm’n of the Village of New Milford, 148 \nF.Supp.2d 173, 180-81 (D.Conn. 2001). Prevented by the COVID-19 pandemic and the \nGovernor’s  executive  orders  from  gathering  signatures,  the  Plaintiffs  are  suffering \nirreparable damage to the very core of their constitutional rights to petition and engage \nin political speech each day. Moreover, the State of Illinois has thus far refused or \nneglected to take any action with respect to protecting the rights of petition passers and \nIllinois voters who wish to vote on referendums in the general election. With the May 3, \n2020 deadline quickly approaching, the Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy but to seek \nthe requested injunctive and declaratory relief from this Court.  \nIII. The Balance of The Harms Favors The Plaintiffs. \nAny speculative harm to the Defendants from the requested relief would be far \noutweighed by the actual harm that the Plaintiffs would suffer by being deprived of \ntheir constitutional freedoms to petition and speak. Injunctive and declaratory relief \nhere would merely require the Defendants to make reasonable modifications to their \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 6 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 10 of 12 PageID #:54\nelection procedures in light of the current pandemic as a number of states have already \nvoluntarily done.  \nAs  demonstrated  by  other  states,  discussed  above,  there  is  minimal  burden \nassociated with protecting the rights of petition and speech in this case. In fact, the tools \nnecessary to implement Plaintiffs’ requested relief are already available to the State. \nOther states have paved the way and are available to offer assistance if needed. The \nState  may  choose  to  avail  itself  of  those  resources  if  it  chooses.  Nevertheless,  the \nPlaintiffs’ requested relief is reasonable in light of the impossibility of gathering any \nsignatures and the balance of the harms favors the Plaintiffs.  \nIV. Granting the Requested Relief Will Serve the Public Interest.   \n        \n“Vindicating First Amendment freedoms is clearly in the public interest.” Pacific \nFrontier v. Pleasant Grove City, 414 F.3d 1221, 1237 (10th Cir. 2005). See also, ACLU of \nGeorgia v. Miller, 977 F.Supp. 1228, 1235 (N.D. Ga. 1997) (“No long string of citations is \nnecessary to find that the public interest weighs in favor of having access to a free flow \nof constitutionally protected speech.”) (quotation and citation omitted). The requested \nrelief is in the public interest because it will give the Plaintiffs and Illinois voters an \nopportunity  to  vote  on  important  matters  of  public  policy.  As  one  court  stated, \n“injunctions protecting First Amendment freedoms are always in the public interest.” \nAm. Civil Liberties Union of Illinois v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583, 590 (7th Cir. 2012)(quoting \nChristian Legal Soc’y v. Walker, 453 F.3d 853, 859 (7th Cir. 2006).  \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 6 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 11 of 12 PageID #:55\nCONCLUSION \nFor all the reasons set forth above, the Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \nA. Assume original jurisdiction over this matter; \nB.  Issue a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction (i) enjoining or \nmodifying enforcement of Illinois' petition collection requirements for initiative \nreferendums for Illinois' November 3, 2020 general election; and (ii) enabling and \nrequiring the Defendants to allow for petitions to be submitted electronically via \nnames of qualified electors collected by an online form to be created by the \nSecretary of State; extend the May 3, 2020 deadline for an Article XIV, Section 3 \nreferendum to August 3, 2020; and reduce by 50% the number of signatures \nrequired  to  qualify  Article  XIV  statewide  and  Article  VII  local  government \ninitiative  referendums  for  the  general  election  ballot  or  reduce  by  some \npercentage of required signatures necessary to demonstrate substantial public \nsupport;  \nC.  Issue a declaratory judgment stating that, in light of the current public health \nemergency caused by the novel coronavirus and executive orders requiring that \nIllinois citizens stay at home and shelter in place, Illinois' petition collection \nrequirements  for  qualifying  Article  XIV  and  Article  VII  referendums  for  the \ngeneral election ballot cannot be constitutionally enforced; \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 6 Filed: 04/09/20 Page 12 of 12 PageID #:56\nD. Issue  a  permanent  injunction  prohibiting  enforcement  of  Illinois'  petition \ncollection  requirements  for  Article  XIV  and  Article  VII  referendums  for  the \nNovember 3, 2020 general election; \nE.  Order Defendants to pay to Plaintiffs their costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b); \nF.  Grant such other relief as this Court deems appropriate.  \nRespectfully submitted this 9th day of April, 2020. \n            /s/ WILLIAM MORGAN, ET AL., \n \n John Mauck  \nSorin A.

In  support  of  this  Motion,  the  Plaintiffs  state  as  follows:\nraat re Cp  rat J  isd \n1.  On  April  7,  2020,  the  Plaintiffs  filed  this  present  suit  seeking  “to  enjoin  or  modify \nIllinois  petition  collection  requirements  for  initiative  referendums  to  be  placed  on  the \nNovember  3,  2020  general  election  ballot  ..  .  in  light  of the  current  public  health  emergency \ncaused  by  the  novel  coronavirus  and  the  Governor’s  shelter-in-place  emergency  orders.”  Dkt. \n001.  )(emphasis  added). \n2.  On  April  9,  2020,  Plaintiffs  filed  an  emergency  motion  for  preliminary  injunction \nwhich  was  heard  before  Judge  Pallmeyer  on  April  17,  2020. \n3.  On  April  17,  2020,  Judge  Pallmeyer  held  a  telephonic  hearing  during  which  she \ndenied  Plaintiffs’  motion  for  preliminary  injunction  largely  on  the  basis  of  a \nmisunderstanding  concerning  the  argument  Plaintiffs  were  making,  discussed  further \nbelow. \n4,  Subsequent  to  the  Court’s  ruling,  the  Plaintiffs  and  the  State  Defendants  engaged \nin  multiple  rounds  of  settlement  negotiations  which  ultimately  failed  to  resolve  this \nmatter. \n5.  The  State  still  continues  to  require  the  Plaintiffs  to  physically  deliver  their \npetition  in  paper  form,  has  refused  to  extend  the  May  3,  2020  deadline,  and  has  further \nrefused  to  agree  to  any  signature  reduction. \n6.  The  State’s  requirements  are  impossible  to  comply  with,  and  more  so  now  that \nthe  Governor  has  extended  the  stay-at-home  orders  to  May  30,  2020.  Indeed,  the \nSecretary  of  State’s  office,  to  which  hundreds  of  thousands  of  pages  must  be  delivered,\nraat aan o  rat J  as \nis  not  even  open  to  the  public  during  the  pendency  of  the  stay-at-home  order.  And  even \nif  the  office  were  open,  the  Plaintiffs  would  be  required  to  violate  the  stay-at-home  and \nsocial  distancing  rules  in  order  to  show  up  to  the  office  with  hundreds  of  thousands  of \npaper  pages  and  put  State  personnel  at  risk  from  physical  contact  and  from  handling \nhundreds  of  thousands  of  paper  pages. \n7.  The  Governor's  extension  of  the  stay-at-home  order  through  May  30,  2020  is  a \nnew  and  relevant  factual  development  that  requires  this  Court’s  immediate  attention  as \nPlaintiffs  have  no  means  to  comply  with  the  State’s  election  requirements. \n8.  Moreover,  the  only  relief  Plaintiffs  seek  simply  mirrors  the  relief  recently  granted \nto  candidates  in  Libertarian  Party  of  Illinois  et.  al.,  v.  Pritzker  et.  al.,  Case  No  2-cv-2112. \nIndeed,  the  traditional  procedure  in  existing  Illinois  election  law  for  collecting  initiative \npetition  signatures  is  identical  to,  and  indistinguishable  from,  the  traditional  procedure \nfor  collecting  candidate  petition  signatures  which  was  modified  in  the  Libertarian  Party \ncase. \n9.  In  addition,  Plaintiffs  need  to  correct  the  record  concerning  the  April  17,  2020 \nhearing.  The  Plaintiffs’  argument  is,  and  always  has  been,  that  the  election  laws  they  are \nseeking  to  modify  are  unconstitutional  only  under  the  present  circumstances.  This  is  clear \nfrom  page  one  of  the  Plaintiffs’  Verified  Complaint  and  throughout  their  subsequent \nbriefings.  Plaintiffs  do  not,  and  have  not,  challenged  the  constitutionality  of  the  State’s \nelections  laws  on  their  face,  or  as  they  existed  before  the  pandemic.\nnataratit a mm  my  P+_ tiP:iP o  Ofy aeeA K PR Oeweyt ’  \n10.  During  the  April  17,  2020,  Judge  Pallmeyer  and  attorney  John  Mauck  discussed \nthe  constitutionality  of  the  challenged  restrictions  and  whether  they  were  also \nunconstitutional  one  year  ago.  Attorney  Mauck  misunderstood  the  line  of  questioning \nand  misspoke  concerning  the  Plaintiffs’  position  in  this  case.  Nothing  submitted  to  the \ncourt  has  argued  that  the  challenged  election  restrictions  were  illegal  one  year  ago. \n11.  This  confusion  is  apparent  in  the  transcript  of  the  proceedings.  Attorney  Mauck, \nfor  instance,  began  his  comments  by  noting  that  the  election  requirements  were \nunconstitutional  “as  applied.”  Exhibit  A,  Transcript  at  p.  16.  Likewise,  the  Court \ncorrectly  recognized  that  the  argument  that  Governor  Pat  Quinn  was  making  was  that \nthe  Plaintiffs  were  challenging  the  election  requirements  only  in  light  of  the  pandemic. \nId.  at  p.  18.  Attorney  Mauck  can  clarify  his  comments  should  the  Court  desire. \n12.  Plaintiffs  here  should  not  be  denied  their  constitutional  rights  on  the  basis  of  a \nmisunderstanding  during  a  telephonic  hearing. \n13.  In  light  of  new  developments  such  as  the  extension  of  the  Governor's  executive \norder  through  May  30,  2020  and  the  misunderstanding  during  the  April  17,  2020 \nhearing,  the  Plaintiffs  respectfully  request  that  the  Court  reconsider  its  ruling  denying \nPlaintiffs’  motion  for  preliminary  injunction. \nWHEREFORE,  the  Plaintiffs  respectfully  request  relief  as  set  forth  in  Exhibit  B \nattached  to  this  motion. \nDated:  April  28,  2020\nCase:  1:20-cv-02189  Document  #:  29  Filed:  04/28/20  Page  5  of  5  PagelD  #:240 \nRespectfully  submitted, \n/s/ WILLIAM  MORGAN,  ET  AL., \nJohn  Mauck \nSorin  A.

The \n15  relationship  between  this  case  and  the  one  that  was  just \n16  discussed  obviously  relates  to  the  signature  requirement.  In \n17  this  case,  we're  talking  about  ballot  access  for  referendum \n18  which  is,  as  I  understand  it,  a  state-created  right  and, \n19  therefore,  it's  generally  --  the  test  for  getting  --  for \n20  proceedings  are  usually  a  rational  basis  test  that  has  been \n21  applied. \n22  Have  you  been  able  to  talk  about  whether  there's  a \n23  resolution  for  the  proposed  --  the  concerns  that  plaintiffs \n24  have  raised  here? \n25  MR.  MAUCK:  Your  Honor,  this  is  John  Mauck.  We  did \nCase:  |L:20-cv-02189  Document  #:  29-1  Filed:  04/28/20  Page  6  of  22  PagelD  #:246 \n5 \nhave  a  good  hour  and  a  half  conference  on  Monday  with  about  13 \ncounsel.  And  there  have  been  a  number  of  subsequent \nND \n  conversations  of  different  parties.  So  there's  been  a  lot  of \nW\nconferring. \nFR \nThere  was  some  movement  we  saw  yesterday  with  the \noa \nOo  filing  by  the  State  defendants  and  a  concession  that  some \nmodifications  would  be  appropriate  but  they're  not  --  they're \nnot  sufficient  to  meet  our  needs.  So  that's  where  we  stand  at \nthis  point. \nTHE  COURT:  When  was  that  last  proposal  made?  Just \n11  yesterday? \n12  MR.  MAUCK:  Well,  the  proposal  was  made  in  the  reply \n13  motions,  the  response  to  our  motions. \n \n  \n14  THE  COURT:  Correct. \n15  MR.  MAUCK:  The  Secretary  of  State  suggested  the  -- \n16  that  a  two-week  delay  might  be  appropriate  and  the  signature \n17  requirements  could  be,  as  long  as  they  were  wet  signatures, \n18  what  they  call  hard  copy  --  we  call  hard  copy  signatures,  that \n19  they  could  be  submitted  separately  and  not  notarized,  and  some \n20  of  the  procedures  were  not  required.  And  the  Board  of \n21  Elections  had  allowed  similar  modifications. \n22  But  the  central  issue  is,  we  believe  that  electronic \n23  signatures  and  registration  is  a  simple  and  fair  solution  and \n24  workable  solution.  And  that's  where  we  stand.  That's  -- \n25  that's  the  main  difference  and  the  main  issue  to  be  discussed, \nCase:  |L:20-cv-02189  Document  #:  29-1  Filed:  04/28/20  Page  7  of  22  PagelD  #:247 \n1  |  I  think. \n2  THE  COURT:  And  what  is  the  State's  --  I  know  that \n3  |  there  are  a  number  of  defendants  here,  and  many  of  them  have \n4 |  arguments  that  they  really  don't  belong  in  the  case  for \n5  |  various  reasons. \n6  What  would  be  --  what's  the  State's  major  concern \n7  |  about  accepting  electronic  signatures  in  support  of  these \n8 |  petitions  or  referenda  proposals? \n9  MS.  WALSH:  Your  Honor,  this  is  Erin  Walsh  on  behalf \n10  |  of  the  State  Board. \n11  I  think  there  are  many  concerns  with  accepting \n12  | electronic  signatures.  First  of  all,  there's  no  indication  of \n13  | what  that  actually  means.  And  if  you  look  at  the  State \n \n  \n14  |  Board's  election  code  procedures  for  ensuring  that  there \n15 |  aren't  fraudulent  --  there  aren't  fraudulent  signatures,  that \n16  |  these  initiatives  actually  have  the  requisite  amount  of \n17 |  support.  The  State  Board  actually  compares  signatures  in  its \n18 |  verification  process  in  order  to  determine  that  these  are \n19  | valid.  So  this  poses  a  huge  risk  and  leaves  the  whole \n20  |  operation  open  to  fraud. \n21  In  addition,  it's  just  not  workable  because  we  do  not \n22  |  currently  have  something  set  up  and  cannot  create  and \n23  |  implement  something  like  this  on  such  short  notice.  We're \n24  |  talking  about  a  filing  deadline,  a  constitutionally  --  an \n25  |  Illinois  Constitution  set  this  filing  deadline  of  May  3rd. \nCase:  |L:20-cv-02189  Document  #:  29-1  Filed:  04/28/20  Page  8  of  22  PagelD  #:248 \nAnd  now  plaintiffs  are  coming  into  court  attempting  to  get \nvarious  state  agencies  to  completely  rework  their  system  for \nND \n  ballot  access  or  the  state-created  right  at  the  last  minute. \nW\nThis  could  completely  --  this  could  completely  throw \nFR \nthe  entire  system  into  chaos,  leave  everything  open  to  fraud. \noa \nOo  And  it  just  poses  great  risk  to  election  integrity  in  the \nstate. \nTHE  COURT:  Right  now  as  I  understand  it,  the  only \nplaintiff  who's  actually  begun  an  initiative  petition  drive  is \nMr.  Morgan;  is  that  correct? \n11  MR.  MAUCK:  This  is  John  --  go  ahead,  Governor. \n12  MR.  QUINN:  This  is  Pat  Quinn  on  behalf  of  the \n13  plaintiffs. \n \n  \n14  Mr.  Morgan  has  commenced  petition  passing  as  have  all \n15  the  other  plaintiffs  in  the  past  several  weeks.  They \n16  essentially  began  their  petition  drive  after  the  Illinois \n17  General  Assembly  announced  they  were  not  going  to  make  any \n18  recommendations  pursuant  to  a  legislative  commission  on  ethics \n19  and  lobbying  reform  that  was  set  up  last  fall. \n20  The  Secretary  of  State,  the  Attorney  General,  the \n21  governor,  and  legislators  appointed  a  number  of  people  to  make \n22  recommendations  to  deal  with  I1llinois'  serious  corruption, \n23  political  corruption  problems  at  both  state  level  and  local \n24  level.  This  was  done  with  great  fanfare.  The  governor \n25  brought  it  up  in  his  state  of  the  State  address  in  January. \nCase:  |L:20-cv-02189  Document  #:  29-1  Filed:  04/28/20  Page  9  of  22  PagelD  #:249 \nThen  the  commission,  which  had  a  deadline  for \nrecommendations  of  March  31st,  announced  that  they  would  not \nND \n  complete  their  job  at  all  and  make  no  recommendations.  And \nW\nshortly  before  that,  the  plaintiffs  began  to  organize  a \nFR \npetition  drive  under  the  constitution  of  Illinois  for  voters \noa \nOo  to  have  a  say  in  the  matter. \nAnd  they  have  and  are  collecting  signatures,  but  they \ncannot  do  it  in  a  safe  way  in  public  where  they  would  go  to \ngatherings  which  are  not  permitted  anyhow.  And  they're \nfollowing  the  rules  of  stay-at-home  and  also  making  sure  they \n11  keep  socially  distant  from  someone  who  might  be  a  petition \n12  signer  six  feet  away. \n13  So  the  whole  normal  process  of  collecting  signatures \n \n  \n14  is  not  possible.  However,  what  we  just  heard  from  the \n15  attorney  for  the  defendants  regarding  chaos,  their  proposal  to \n16  the  plaintiffs  is  --  would  be  one  of  chaos.  It  is  not \n17  workable  as  we  heard  in  the  previous  case.  It's  just  not \n18  safe,  let  alone  the  technology  required  for  the  collection  of \n19  363,000  signatures  in  a  month  is  not  possible. \n20  Now,  the  plaintiffs  have  one  person  who  has  organized \n21  four  --  his  name  is  David  Vaught,  V-a-u-g-h-t.  He  has \n22  organized  four  different  statewide  petition  drives  that \n23  gathered  more  than  enough  signatures  on  four  different \n24  occasions:  1976,  1980,  1982,  and  1994.  And  signatures  came \n25  in  in  those  drives,  the  bulk  of  them,  in  the  last  seven  weeks. \nCase:  1  :20-cv-02189  Document  #:  29-1  Filed:  04/28/20  Page  10  of  22  PagelD  #:250 \n9 \nSo  it  is  feasible  to  gather  this  number  of  signatures  in  light \nof  the  legislature's  refusal  to  do  anything  significant  on \nND \n  political  ethics  reform,  which  is  the  goal  of  the  plaintiffs. \nW\nAnd  our  proposal,  your  Honor,  is  one  that  I  signed \nFR \ninto  law  in  2013.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  people  in  my  office, \noa \nOo  the  Central  Management  Services  and  our  chief  information \nofficer,  worked  directly  with  defendants  the  State  Board  of \nElections  and  the  Secretary  of  State  to  set  up  an  online  voter \nregistration  system  that  actually  uses  in  the  statute  that  I \nsigned  into  law  the  words  \"electronic  signatures.\" \n11  This  was  set  up  to  allow  people  to  register  to  vote \n12  or  to  change  their  address  if  they  are  already  registered  to \n13  vote  and  to  do  it  in  an  online  way  by  submitting  their  name \n    \n14  and  address,  their  driver's  license  number,  as  well  as  the \n15  date  of  birth  and  I  believe  also  the  last  four  digits  of  their \n16  Social  Security  number. \n17  This  system,  which  began  in  2014,  has  been  in  place \n18  for  the  past  half  dozen  or  more  years.  Indeed,  two  of  our \n19  plaintiffs  used  the  system  to  change  their  address.  They  were \n20  already  registered  to  vote,  but  they  used  I]linois'  online \n21  voter  registration  system  which  allows  for  electronic \n22  signatures,  not  the  so-called  handwritten  wet  signatures. \n23  The  system  was  set  up.  It  could  be  easily  modified \n24  to  accommodate  electronic  registrations  of  support  for  an \n25  initiative.  And  listening  to  the  previous  case,  it  could  be \nCase:  1  :20-cv-02189  Document  #:  29-1  Filed:  04/28/20  Page  11  of  22  PagelD  #:251 \n10 \nalso  adapted  for  those  who  would  seek  to  put  a  candidate  on \nthe  ballot.  The  defendants  -- \nND \n  THE  COURT:  You  know,  let  me  interrupt.  I  need  to \nW\ninterrupt  for  a  moment,  Mr.  Quinn.  I'm  sorry.  You  Know, \nFR \nwhatever  my  views  might  be  on  the  propriety  of  this  electronic \noa \nOo  concept,  I'm  not  sure  I  have  jurisdiction  to  order  that.  What \nI  would  --  what  I  am  hoping  that  you'll  be  able  to  do  is  find \nsome  common  ground. \nI'm  not  sure  that  I  have  jurisdiction  to  order  a \nmandatory  injunction  of  the  kind  you're  proposing  because  that \n11  really  would  ordinarily  require  legislative  action.  I  can't \n12  on  my  own  order  a  different  mechanism  for  the  voting  process \n13  in  Illinois. \n    \n14  What  I  can  do  is,  what  I'm  trying  to  do  right  now  is \n15  determine  what  --  if  this  initiative  is  reform  initiative, \n16  we're  talking  about,  you  mentioned  several  people  working  on \n17  it.  Do  we  have  more  than  one  petition  I  need  to  worry  about? \n18  Is  there  one  petition  that  Mr.  Morgan  and  others  want  to  get \n19  on  the  ballot  right  now  and  they  feel  they've  got  adequate \n20  support  for  and,  if  so,  how  many  signatures  have  been  gathered \n21  already  for  that  petition  prior  to  --  prior  to  when  the  whole \n22  shutdown  happened? \n23  MR.  QUINN:  Well,  there  is  more  --  this  is  Pat  Quinn. \n24  There  is  more  than  one  petition.  There's  a  petition \n25  at  the  statewide  level.  That  is  Mr.  Morgan's  petition  for \nCase:  1  :20-cv-02189  Document  #:  29-1  Filed:  04/28/20  Page  12  of  22  PagelD  #:252 \n11 \nreform  of  the  Illinois  political  ethics.  There's  also  a \npetition  at  the  municipal  level  in  Evanston.  That  1s  a \nND \n  petition  of  plaintiff  Jackson  Paller.  And  that  deadline  is \nW\nlater.  The  local  referendum  is  --  has  a  deadline  of  August \nFR \n3rd.  The  statewide  referendum  has  a  deadline  of  May  3rd  of \noa \nOo  this  year. \nBoth  petitions  have  commenced  and  have  gathered \nsignatures.  The  number  of  signatures  needed  statewide  is  over \n363,000.  At  the  municipal  level  in  Evanston,  the  number  of \nsignatures  required  is  2,800  by  August  3rd.  So  both  are \n11  proceeding.  When  you  do  a  petition  drive,  it's  impossible  to \n12  know  exactly  how  many  signatures  you  have  until  they're \n13  collected.  And  most  people  go  right  to  the  deadline  before \n    \n14  they  turn  in  their  petitions. \n15  THE  COURT:  Well,  right.  And  I  guess  I'm  not  so \n16  concerned  about  August  3rd.  You  know,  there's  no  reason  to \n17  believe  we're  not  going  to  be  at  least  in  some  more  active \n18  situation  by  then. \n19  With  respect  to  the  363,000,  how  close  are  you  to \n20  that  goal? \n21  MR.  QUINN:  Well  -- \n22  THE  COURT:  Things  come  in  at  the  last  minute.  I  get \n23  that. \n24  MR.  QUINN:  Yes.  Well,  they're  not  close  in  terms \n25  of,  they're  near  the  achievement  of  363,000.  They  have  begun. \nCase:  1  :20-cv-02189  Document  #:  29-1  Filed:  04/28/20  Page  13  of  22  PagelD  #:253 \n12 \nI  --  frankly,  and  I  don't  think  anyone  knows  exactly  how  many \npeople  have  signed  the  petition  until  they  actually  turn  in \nND \n  petitions  in  one  way  or  another. \nW\nBut  just  to  put  it  in  perspective,  your  Honor,  in  the \nFR \nstate  of  Wisconsin,  they  have  an  online  system  where  people \noa \nOo  can  request  absentee  ballots.  Historically,  that  wasn't  used \nvery  often  at  all.  About  200,000  people  in  Wisconsin  voted \nabsentee.  But  in  the  recent  election,  in  just  the  last  ten \ndays,  the  Wisconsin  election  commission  went  from  554,000 \nrequests  for  absentee  ballots  to  almost  1.3  million,  a  growth \n11  of  about  --  three-quarters  of  a  million  people  in  the  last  ten \n12  days  went  online,  many  of  them,  to  request  an  absentee  ballot. \n13  So  the  technology  of  using  an  electronic \n    \n14  communication  to  register  your  support  is  available  in \n15  Tllinois.  In  order  to  actually  participate  in  an  election, \n16  you  have  to  be  registered.  And  right  now,  our  state  for  some \n17  years  has  recognized  that  in  order  to  be  registered,  you  can \n18  use  an  electronic  signature  and  there  --  and  that  is  a  safer \n19  system. \n20  When  I  signed  that  law,  it  is  safer  than  the \n21  traditional  handwriting  system  because  you  have  all  these \n22  indices  of  identity.  You  have  the  signer's  IP  address,  when \n23  it  was  signed,  when  it  was  submitted.  You  have  their  date  of \n24  birth.  And  the  person  has  to  put  in  their  driver's  license \n25  number. \nCase:  1  :20-cv-02189  Document  #:  29-1  Filed:  04/28/20  Page  14  of  22  PagelD  #:254 \n13 \nSo  the  notion  that  we  hear  from  the  other  side  that \nthere's  chaos  and  there  will  be  fraud,  the  fraud  exists  where \nND \n  people  use  handwriting  to  fraudulently  write  somebody's  name \nW\non  a  petition.  That's  the  current  system,  the  so-called  wet \nFR \nsystem.  Our  proposal  is  one  that  is  fighting  against  fraud \noa \nOo  and  is  the  best  way  to  identify  the  petitioners  who  want  to \nregister  their  support. \nMS.  WALSH:  Your  Honor,  may  I  address  a  couple  points \nthat  Mr.  Quinn  has  raised? \nTHE  COURT:  Sure. \n11  MS.  WALSH:  This  is  Erin  Walsh  for  the  State  Board  of \n12  Elections. \n13  And,  first  of  all,  I  just  want  to  address  this  point. \n    \n14  It  seems  that  plaintiffs  keep  complaining  about  the  difficulty \n15  that  this  situation  poses  for  them  to  get  on  the  ballot,  but \n16  this  isn't  a  case  of  ballot  access  that  said  --  that  indicates \n17  voting  rights.  This  is  simply  a  state-created  right  for  a \n18  proposed  constitutional  amendment  to  be  submitted  as  a \n19  referendum.  The  plaintiffs  do  not  have  a  federal  right  that \n20  that  shows  up  on  the  general  election  ballot. \n21  Secondly,  whether  other  states  have  some  sort  of \n22  mechanism  to  submit  signatures  electronic  in  different \n23  situations,  Illinois  does  not  have  that  set  up  in  this \n24  context.  They're  trying  to  foist  this  untested  program  on  the \n25  State  of  Illinois  at  the  last  minute,  and  it's  upending  years \nCase:  1  :20-cv-02189  Document  #:  29-1  Filed:  04/28/20  Page  15  of  22  PagelD  #:255 \n14 \nof  how  we  have  done  the  election  process  in  this  state. \nAlso,  they  have  not  made  any  showing  that  they've \nND \n  attempted  to  even  try  to  comply  with  the  previous  procedures. \nW\nWe  have  no  evidence  that  they've  --  how  many  signatures  that \nFR \nthey've  collected,  that  they  made  an  effort  prior  to  March \noa \n2020.  The  filings  that  were  submitted  to  the  State  Board  of \nOo \nElections  indicates  that  this  committee  was  created  on  April \n1st,  2020,  and  that  the  paperwork  was  filed  on  April  9th, \n2020. \nSo  and  one  last  point.  You  still  need  a  handwritten \n11  signature  of  some  kind  for  voter  applications  when  you  go \n12  through  the  State  Board  of  Elections'  website  to  do  the  online \n13  registration  to  vote. \n    \n14  MR.  QUINN:  Your  Honor,  may  I  respond  to  that?  You \n15  do  not  need  a  handwritten  signature.  It  is  sufficient  to \n16  recite  your  name,  your  address,  your  date  of  birth,  your \n17  driver's  license  number,  the  last  four  digits  of  your  Social \n18  Security  number.  That's  called  an  electronic  signature. \n19  With  respect  to  the  committee  that  was  formed,  you  do \n20  not  need  to  have  a  committee  unless  you  raise  $5,000.  You  can \n21  commence  petition  passing  prior  to  the  formation  of  the \n22  committee,  and  that's  exactly  what  happened  here.  We  are  not \n23  upending  years  of  prior  behavior  because  this  system  is \n24  digital.  Electronic  system  for  registering  yourself  to  be  a \n25  voter  has  been  in  place  in  I1linois. \nCase:  1  :20-cv-02189  Document  #:  29-1  Filed:  04/28/20  Page  16  of  22  PagelD  #:256 \n15 \nI  Know  exactly  what  --  how  to  do  it  because  I  was  the \none  who  suggested  it  in  my  state  of  the  State  address  in \nND \n  January  of  2013.  And  within  a  few  short  months,  the  law  was \nW\npassed.  I  signed  it  into  law.  It  was  implemented  with  the \nFR \nassistance  of  people  who  worked  for  me  and  with  the  two \noa \ndefendants. \nOo \nThe  two  defendants  are  claiming  that  this  is  a \ndifficult  thing  to  do.  It's  the  exact  opposite.  Any \nreasonable  operation  could  easily  adjust  the  current  voter \nregistration  system  that's  done  online  to  include  registering \n11  your  support  for  an  initiative  proposition.  And  indeed,  that \n12  1s  something  that  Illinois  should  consider  because  it  is  the \n13  most  safe,  most  secure,  the  best  system  to  prevent  voter \n    \n14  fraud.  Now  -- \n15  THE  COURT:  Mr.  Quinn  -- \n16  MR.  QUINN:  --  understanding  -- \n17  THE  COURT:  Mr.  Quinn,  I'm  sorry  to  interrupt.  This \n18  1s  not  about  what  is  a  good  proposal  or  makes  sense  or  ought \n19  to  be  done  or  is  a  matter  of  good  public  policy.  This  is \n20  about  whether  I  have  the  constitutional  authority  to  order \n21  Illinois  to  adopt  this  proposal  for  its  initiative  at  this \n22  moment,  and  I  just  --  I'm  really  uncertain  about  that.  I \n23  don't  think  that  the  case  has  been  made. \n24  I  need  to  look  at  the  case  law  more  carefully  and \n25  determine  whether  I  even  have  jurisdiction  to  enter  such  an \nCase:  1  :20-cv-02189  Document  #:  29-1  Filed:  04/28/20  Page  17  of  22  PagelD  #:257 \n16 \norder,  but  I  would  suggest  that  you  work  with  the  defendants \nat  this  time  to  see  if  there's  some  somewhat  ameliorating \nND \n  mechanism  for  getting  a  well-supported  initiative  on  the \nW\nballot,  not  upend  the  entire  process  in  a  way  that  would  be \nFR \nideal.  That's  not  what  I'm  able  to  do  here. \noa \nOo  MR.  QUINN:  Well,  your  Honor  -- \nMR.  MAUCK:  This  is  John  Mauck.  With  regard  to  the \njurisdiction,  it  is  a  state-created  right,  the  right  to  -- \nTHE  COURT:  Correct. \nMR.  MAUCK:  --  put  in  these  referendums,  initiatives, \n11  but  the  Seventh  Circuit  has  said  that  the  state  that  opens  the \n12  ballot  cannot  impose  unconstitutional  restrictions. \n13  THE  COURT:  Correct. \n    \n14  MR.  MAUCK:  And  our  contention  is  that  these \n15  restrictions  that  they're  enforcing  requiring  wet  signatures \n16  1s  unconstitutional  as  applied  because  they  --  they're \n17  irrational.  And  we  think  they  have  no  compelling  interest  in \n18  them.  And  we  think  there  are  compelling  interest  tests \n19  involved,  not  a  rational  basis,  but  in  either  case  when \n20  there's  an  easier,  cleaner  -- \n21  THE  COURT:  Okay.  Hold  on.  Hold  on.  I've  got  to \n22  interrupt.  If  you're  saying  there's  no  rational  basis  for \n23  this,  then  the  public  health  emergency  has  nothing  to  do  with \n24  it;  is  that  right?  You  would  be  bringing  this  --  you  would  be \n25  bringing  this  lawsuit  even  absent  COVID-19? \nCase:  1  :20-cv-02189  Document  #:  29-1  Filed:  04/28/20  Page  18  of  22  PagelD  #:258 \n17 \nMR.  MAUCK:  Well,  we  -- \nTHE  COURT:  You're  saying  there's  no  rational  basis \nND \nfor  the  way  the  State  is  doing  things  right  now. \n \nW\nMR.  MAUCK:  It's  questionable.  I  don't  Know  the \nFR \nanswer  to  that,  but  there's  certainly  no  compelling  reason  and \noa \nOo  certainly  not  narrowly  tailored.  That's  what  we've  contested. \nTHE  COURT:  That's  --  it's  not  narrowly  tailored,  and \nit  wasn't  narrowly  tailored  a  year  ago;  is  that  right? \nMR.  MAUCK:  That's  right. \nTHE  COURT:  In  that  case,  I'm  not  prepared  to  enter  a \n11  preliminary  injunction.  There's  nothing  unusual  about  the \n12  circumstances  that  maps  under  your  argument. \n13  MR.  MAUCK:  Well,  the  narrow  tailoring  -- \n    \n14  THE  COURT:  In  other  words,  the  argument  right  now \n15  that  there  is  an  urgent  need  for  change  in  the  current  system \n16  because  --  because  it's  not  rationally  based  and  it's  not \n17  narrowly  tailored,  it's  something  that  could  have  been  brought \n18  at  any  point.  And  the  fact  that  we're  in  a  public  health \n19  emergency  does  not  change  that. \n20  This  law  was  unconstitutional,  in  your  view,  a  year \n21  ago,  and  that's  when  the  lawsuit  should  have  been  filed.  It's \n22  too  late  now  with  a  deadline  of  May  3  for  the  Court  to  upend \n23  the  process.  If  I  believed  that  instead  what  you're  talking \n24  about  1s  something  that's  unique  to  the  current  situation,  I \n25  would  be  considering  this,  but  that's  not  the  argument  you're \nCase:  1  :20-cv-02189  Document  #:  29-1  Filed:  04/28/20  Page  19  of  22  PagelD  #:259 \n18 \nmaking.  That's  not  the  argument  that  Mr.  Quinn  has  made. \nI'd  just  note,  Mr.  Quinn  has  not  filed  an  appearance, \nND \n  so  if  you're  going  to  do  that,  you  need  to  do  so,  sir. \nW\nMR.  MAUCK:  There's  a  motion  pending  for  Governor \nFR \nQuinn  pro  hac  vice  -- \noa \nTHE  COURT:  I  didn't  see  that. \nOo \nMR.  MAUCK:  --  pending  before  the  Court. \nTHE  COURT:  I'm  sorry.  I  didn't  see  that. \nMR.  MAUCK:  Yes.  We've  asked  the  Court  to  grant \nthat. \n11  MR.  QUINN:  Your  Honor,  this  is  Pat  Quinn.  Your \n12  Honor,  with  respect  to  the  issue,  the  federal  court  in  1982 \n13  with  one  of  our  plaintiffs  did  indeed  look  at  the  provisions \n    \n14  of  Section  28-3  of  the  Illinois  Election  Code  regarding  a \n15  previous  statewide  initiative,  and  the  federal  court  held  that \n16  strict  scrutiny  was  the  standard  with  respect  -- \n17  THE  COURT:  I  have  to  interrupt.  I  have  to  interrupt \n18  again.  I  don't  see  a  motion  for  leave  to  proceed  pro  hac  vice \n19  on  the  file.  Can  you  identify  that  for  me,  where  in  the \n20  record  that  is?  I'm  sorry. \n21  MR.  QUINN:  It  was  --  your  Honor,  it  was  filed  by \n22  Mr.  Mauck's  firm  on  my  behalf. \n23  THE  COURT:  Got  it.  Okay.  Got  it. \n24  MR.  QUINN:  A111  right. \n25  THE  COURT:  But  again,  Mr.  Quinn,  you're  making  an \nCase:  1  :20-cv-02189  Document  #:  29-1  Filed:  04/28/20  Page  20  of  22  PagelD  #:260 \n19 \nargument  about  something  that  was  true  ten  years  ago  or  five \nyears  ago.  That's  not  a  basis  for  a  preliminary  injunction. \nND \n  MR.  QUINN:  Well,  we  do  feel  that  the  current  public \nW\nhealth  emergency  makes  it  impossible  to  conduct  any  kind  of \nFR \npetition  passing  that  would  allow  us  to  gather  the  appropriate \noa \nOo  number  of  signatures,  not  only  statewide  but  also  with  respect \nto  the  Evanston  petition  which  is  due  on  August  3rd. \nClearly,  those  men  and  women  in  Evanston  who  want  to \nput  a  question  on  the  ballot  are  --  with  respect  to  this \npublic  health  emergency,  they  have  a  choice  either  to  obey  the \n11  law  or  to  try  to  follow  petition  passing.  So  they're  obeying \n12  the  law  and  so  -- \n13  THE  COURT:  But  the  law  -- \n    \n14  MR.  QUINN:  --  they  need  guidance  from  this  court  -- \n15  THE  COURT:  The  law  does  not  -- \n16  MR.  QUINN:  --  on  how  to  carry  out  their  opportunity \n17  to  petition  their  government. \n18  THE  COURT:  I'm  so  sorry,  but  the  law  does  not \n19  prohibit  them  from  movement  until  August  3rd.  It  may  at  some \n20  point  but  right  now,  that's  not  the  law. \n21  The  motion  for  preliminary  injunction  to  alter  the \n22  state  deadlines  is  denied.  I'l]  --  the  case  will  be  entered \n23  and  continued  with  respect  to  Evanston.  And  I'm  confident \n24  that  Judge  Norgle,  to  whom  the  case  is  assigned,  will  take  it \n25  up. \nCase:  1  :20-cv-02189  Document  #:  29-1  Filed:  04/28/20  Page  21  of  22  PagelD  #:261 \n20 \nMS.  SCHELLER:  Your  Honor,  this  is  the  Assistant \nState's  Attorney  on  behalf  of  the  Clerk,  Karen  Yarbrough. \nND \nTHE  COURT:  Yes. \n \nW\nMS.  SCHELLER:  You  may  recall  that  we  filed  a \nFR \nresponse  suggesting  that  the  clerk  is  not  in  a  position  to \noa \ngrant  or  deny  any  relief  to  the  plaintiffs.  And  we  also  do \nOo \nnot  believe  there's  an  Article  III  justiciable  dispute.  We \nwould  ask  that  the  Court  deny  the  motion  as  directed  against \nthe  clerk  as  well  today. \nTHE  COURT:  So  ordered. \n11  MS.  GANDURSKI:  And,  your  Honor,  this  is  Kelley \n12  Gandurski  on  behalf  of  Evanston.  We  would  also  make  the  same \n13  request.  We  filed  a  motion  to  dismiss  in  this  case,  and  we \n    \n14  are  --  our  argument  is  that  we  are  not  a  proper  party  at  this \n15  time  as  Evanston  follows  the  state  law. \n16  THE  COURT:  Well,  that  motion  is  pending,  and  I'm \n17  confident  that  counsel  will  respond  to  it.  I'm  not  entering  a \n18  preliminary  injunction  at  this  time.

In support of this Motion, the Plaintiffs state as follows: \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 29 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 2 of 5 PageID #:237\n1.  On April 7, 2020, the Plaintiffs filed this present suit seeking “to enjoin or modify \nIllinois petition collection requirements for initiative referendums to be placed on the \nNovember 3, 2020 general election ballot . . . in light of the current public health emergency \ncaused by the novel coronavirus and the Governor’s shelter-in-place emergency orders.” Dkt. \n001. )(emphasis added). \n2.  On April 9, 2020, Plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for preliminary injunction \nwhich was heard before Judge Pallmeyer on April 17, 2020.  \n3.  On April 17, 2020, Judge Pallmeyer held a telephonic hearing during which she \ndenied  Plaintiffs’  motion  for  preliminary  injunction  largely  on  the  basis  of  a \nmisunderstanding concerning the argument Plaintiffs were making, discussed further \nbelow. \n4.  Subsequent to the Court’s ruling, the Plaintiffs and the State Defendants engaged \nin multiple rounds of settlement negotiations which ultimately failed to resolve this \nmatter.   \n5.  The  State  still  continues  to  require  the  Plaintiffs  to  physically  deliver  their \npetition in paper form, has refused to extend the May 3, 2020 deadline, and has further \nrefused to agree to any signature reduction.  \n6.  The State’s requirements are impossible to comply with, and more so now that \nthe  Governor  has  extended  the  stay-at-home  orders  to  May  30,  2020.  Indeed,  the \nSecretary of State’s office, to which hundreds of thousands of pages must be delivered, \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 29 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 3 of 5 PageID #:238\nis not even open to the public during the pendency of the stay-at-home order. And even \nif the office were open, the Plaintiffs would be required to violate the stay-at-home and \nsocial distancing rules in order to show up to the office with hundreds of thousands of \npaper pages and put State personnel at risk from physical contact and from handling \nhundreds of thousands of paper pages.  \n7.  The Governor’s extension of the stay-at-home order through May 30, 2020 is a \nnew and relevant factual development that requires this Court’s immediate attention as \nPlaintiffs have no means to comply with the State’s election requirements.  \n8.  Moreover, the only relief Plaintiffs seek simply mirrors the relief recently granted \nto candidates in Libertarian Party of Illinois et. al., v. Pritzker et. al., Case No 2-cv-2112. \nIndeed, the traditional procedure in existing Illinois election law for collecting initiative \npetition signatures is identical to, and indistinguishable from, the traditional procedure \nfor collecting candidate petition signatures which was modified in the Libertarian Party \ncase. \n9.  In addition, Plaintiffs need to correct the record concerning the April 17, 2020 \nhearing. The Plaintiffs’ argument is, and always has been, that the election laws they are \nseeking to modify are unconstitutional only under the present circumstances. This is clear \nfrom page one of the Plaintiffs’ Verified Complaint and throughout their subsequent \nbriefings. Plaintiffs do not, and have not, challenged the constitutionality of the State’s \nelections laws on their face, or as they existed before the pandemic.  \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 29 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 4 of 5 PageID #:239\n10. During the April 17, 2020, Judge Pallmeyer and attorney John Mauck discussed \nthe  constitutionality  of  the  challenged  restrictions  and  whether  they  were  also \nunconstitutional one year ago. Attorney Mauck misunderstood the line of questioning \nand misspoke concerning the Plaintiffs’ position in this case. Nothing submitted to the \ncourt has argued that the challenged election restrictions were illegal one year ago.  \n11. This confusion is apparent in the transcript of the proceedings. Attorney Mauck, \nfor  instance,  began  his  comments  by  noting  that  the  election  requirements  were \nunconstitutional  “as  applied.”  Exhibit  A,  Transcript  at  p.  16.  Likewise,  the  Court \ncorrectly recognized that the argument that Governor Pat Quinn was making was that \nthe Plaintiffs were challenging the election requirements only in light of the pandemic. \nId. at p. 18. Attorney Mauck can clarify his comments should the Court desire.  \n12.  Plaintiffs here should not be denied their constitutional rights on the basis of a \nmisunderstanding during a telephonic hearing.  \n13. In light of new developments such as the extension of the Governor’s executive \norder  through  May  30,  2020  and  the  misunderstanding  during  the  April  17,  2020 \nhearing, the Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court reconsider its ruling denying \nPlaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction.  \nWHEREFORE,  the  Plaintiffs  respectfully  request  relief  as  set  forth  in  Exhibit  B \nattached to this motion.  \nDated: April 28, 2020   \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 29 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 5 of 5 PageID #:240\n              Respectfully submitted, \n/s/ WILLIAM MORGAN, ET AL., \n \nJohn Mauck  \nSorin A.

Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(e) and 1402(a) and 5 \nU.S.C. § 703. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND   \n \n16. Article XIV, Section 3 of the Illinois Constitution provides that \nAmendments to Article IV of this Constitution may be proposed by a petition \nsigned by a number of electors equal in number to at least eight percent of the \ntotal votes cast for candidates for Governor in the preceding gubernatorial \nelection. Amendments shall be limited to structural and procedural subjects \ncontained  in  Article  IV.  A  petition  shall  contain  the  text  of  the  proposed \namendment  and  the  date  of  the  general  election  at  which  the  proposed \namendment  is  to  be  submitted,  shall  have  been  signed  by  the  petitioning \nelectors not more than twenty-four months preceding that general election and \nshall be filed with the Secretary of State at least six months before that general \nelection.  The  procedure  for  determining  the  validity  and  sufficiency  of  a \npetition shall be provided by law. If the petition is valid and sufficient, the \nproposed amendment shall be submitted to the electors at that general election \nand shall become effective if approved by either three-fifths of those voting on \nthe amendment or a majority of those voting in the election. \n \n17.  Article VII, Section 11 of the Illinois Constitution provides that  \n(a)  Proposals for actions which are authorized by this Article or by law and \nwhich require approval by referendum may be initiated and submitted to the \nelectors by resolution of the governing board of a unit of local government or \nby petition of electors in the manner provided by law. \n (b)  Referenda required by this Article shall be held at general elections, except \nas otherwise provided by law. Questions submitted to referendum shall be \nadopted if approved by a majority of those voting on the question unless a \ndifferent requirement is specified in this Article. \n \n \n5 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 6 of 13 PageID #:6\n18. Article III, Section 3 of the Illinois Constitution provides that “[a]ll elections shall \nbe free and equal.”  \n19. On May 27, 2019, both houses of the Illinois General Assembly adopted Senate \nJoint  Resolution  Constitutional  Amendment  1,  which  placed  a  Constitutional \nAmendment referendum for an amendment known as the “Fair Tax Amendment,” on \nthe ballot for the November 3, 2020 general election, pursuant to Article XIV, Section 2 \nof the Illinois Constitution.  \n20. The  deadline  for  the  Illinois  General  Assembly  to  place  a  Constitutional \nAmendment referendum on the ballot, pursuant to Article XIV, Section 2, is May 3, \n2020.   \n21. On  November  14,  2019,  the  Illinois  General  Assembly  adopted  a  resolution \ncreating the Illinois Joint Commission on Lobbying and Ethics Reform. This body was \ncharged with examining current Illinois legislation regarding ethics, soliciting feedback \nfrom experts and the general public, and releasing a final report with its review and \nrecommendations by no later than March 31, 2020.  \n22. Sometime around December 2019, an outbreak of respiratory disease now known \nas COVID-19, or coronavirus, emerged in Wuhan, China.  \n23. Since then, the outbreak has spread to the majority of the world, with the United \nStates reporting the most cases.  \n \n6 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 7 of 13 PageID #:7\n24. On  February  27,  2020,  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  issued  guidance  in \nresponse to COVID-19 which recommended, among other things, the practice of social \ndistancing.  \n25. On March 9, 2020, the Governor of Illinois proclaimed the entire state a disaster \narea1  and  later  banned  gatherings  of  1,000  people  or  more  and  closed  all  schools, \nrestaurants, and bars.2 \n26. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a \nglobal pandemic.  \n27. On  March  13,  2020,  the  President  of  the  United  States  declared  a  national \nemergency. \n28.  On March 15, 2020, the Illinois General Assembly suspended session indefinitely \ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic.   \n29. On March 20, 2020, the Governor of Illinois ordered everyone to shelter at home \nwith  the  exception  of  “essential”  activities  and  services,  and  to  maintain  six  foot \ndistance from others.3 \n30.  On March 31, 2020, the co-chairs of the Commission on Lobbying and Ethics \nReform stated that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the commission would be unable to \nreach the March 31, 2020 deadline and would need more time.   \n                                                            \n1 https://www2.illinois.gov/sites/gov/Documents/APPROVED%20- \n%20Coronavirus%20Disaster%20Proc%20WORD.pdf. \n2 https://www2.illinois.gov/Pages/Executive-Orders/ExecutiveOrder2020-04.aspx. \n3 https://www2.illinois.gov/Pages/Executive-Orders/ExecutiveOrder2020-10.aspx. \n \n7 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 8 of 13 PageID #:8\n31. The Governor’s shelter at home and social distancing order is in effect until at \nleast April 30, 2020.4 Because of the uncertainty of this health crisis, it is unknown when \nthe order will be lifted or when petition passing may resume.  \n32. Circulating initiative petitions is not listed as an “essential” activity under the \nGovernor’s  order.  The  health  crisis  coupled  with  the  Governor’s  orders  makes  it \nimpossible to gather signatures in Illinois. In addition, gathering signatures during the \nhealth crisis would endanger the health of the circulators and that of the public at large.  \n33. A  number  of  states  have  taken  action  to  protect  the  constitutional  right  to \npetition and vote in the midst of this health crisis.

I am a 72 year old Illinois registered voter currently residing at 1135 Gateshead Drive, \nNaperville, IL 60564.  \n2.  I intend to vote at the November 3, 2020, general election which includes a constitutional \namendment referendum on the Fair Tax Amendment proposed by the Illinois General \nAssembly pursuant to Article XIV, Section 2 of the Illinois Constitution.  \n3. I wish to circulate an initiative petition for a constitutional amendment referendum on the \nIllinois Democracy Amendment pursuant to Article XIV, Section 3 of the Illinois Constitution.  \n4.  However, I am concerned about the ongoing COVID-19 health crisis and I intend to abide \nby the State’s current shelter at home and social distancing orders. If given the opportunity to \ncirculate petitions online I would do so. \n5. In 1976, 1980, 1982, and 1994, I collected initiative petition signatures and coordinated the \npetition drives for statewide constitutional amendment referendums pursuant to Article XIV, \nSection 3. Each of the four statewide petition drives exceeded the minimum signature \nrequirement for an Article XIV referendum in Section 28-9 of the Illinois Election Code. Each of \nthe four statewide petition drives obtained the bulk of their signatures in the last seven weeks \nof the petition drive before the deadline.  \n  Under penalties as provided by law, the undersigned certifies that the statements set forth in \nthis instrument are true and correct, except as to matters therein stated to be on information and \nbelief and as to such matters the undersigned certifies as aforesaid that he verily believes the \nsame to be true. \nDate: April 7, 2020 \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 1-4 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 4 of 4 PageID #:25\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 1-5 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 1 of 3 PageID #:26\n \n \nEXHIBIT 4 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 1-5 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 2 of 3 PageID #:27\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 1-5 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 3 of 3 PageID #:28\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 1-6 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 1 of 4 PageID #:29\n \n \nEXHIBIT 5 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 1-6 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 2 of 4 PageID #:30\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 1-6 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 3 of 4 PageID #:31\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 1-6 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 4 of 4 PageID #:32\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 1-7 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 1 of 4 PageID #:33\n \n \nEXHIBIT 6 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 1-7 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 2 of 4 PageID #:34\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 1-7 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 3 of 4 PageID #:35\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 1-7 Filed: 04/07/20 Page 4 of 4 PageID #:36",

Ruggie, Assistant City \nAttorney, moves this Honorable Court to dismiss the Plaintiffs’ Complaint against Defendant \nReid pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  In support thereof, Reid states as follows: \n \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 15 Filed: 04/15/20 Page 2 of 11 PageID #:83\nINTRODUCTION \n  On April 7, 2020, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint.  Dkt. 1.  Plaintiffs sued a variety of \nentities,  including  the  Evanston  City  Clerk,  Devon  Reid  (hereafter  “Reid”),  in  his  official \ncapacity.  Notably, Reid is the only municipal clerk named in Plaintiffs’ lawsuit, even though \nPlaintiffs allege that this is an issue that will affect the entire State of Illinois.  Plaintiffs allege \nviolations of their First Amendment rights and request that Reid accept electronic signatures for a \nreferendum petition.  Plaintiffs’ request is misplaced.  Reid is entitled to qualified immunity.  \nAdditionally, the Illinois Constitution and the Illinois Election Code control Reid’s ability to \nallow  for  electronic  signatures  and  therefore,  Plaintiffs’  lack  standing  regarding  their  claim \nagainst Reid.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint also fails to state a cause of action against Reid.  Plaintiffs \nallege that their First Amendment Rights were violated when the Illinois Governor entered an \nexecutive order to shelter in-place.  Dkt. 1.  Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that they are unable to \ncollect signatures for a ballot referendum because of the Governor’s executive order.  Looking at \nthe totality of Plaintiffs’ Complaint, it is completely devoid of any allegations that Reid violated \ntheir rights and should therefore be dismissed.  Lastly, Plaintiffs’ Complaint should be dismissed \nbecause Reid is sued in his official capacity, yet Plaintiffs fail to allege a Monell claim that the \nCity of Evanston has a policy or custom or violating Plaintiffs’ rights.       \n  Plaintiffs’ complaint against Reid should be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) because:  \n1)  Reid is entitled to qualified immunity; 2) Plaintiffs’ claim is not ripe;  3) Plaintiffs fail to state \na cause of action against Reid, and 4) Plaintiffs do not bring a Monell claim against the City, even \nthough they named the Evanston City Clerk in his official capacity. \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 15 Filed: 04/15/20 Page 3 of 11 PageID #:84\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n  In reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint, a district court must accept all well-plead \nfacts as true and draw all permissible inferences in favor of the plaintiff.  Agnew v. Nat’l \nCollegiate Athletic Ass’n, 683 F.3d 328, 334 (7th Cir. 2012) (emphasis added).  The Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure require a complaint provide the defendant with “fair notice of what \nthe…claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.”  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007) \n(quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  The Supreme Court has \ndescribed this standard as requiring a complaint to “contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as \ntrue, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570).  A complaint falls short of the plausibility standard \nwhere  plaintiff  “pleads  facts  that  are  'merely  consistent  with'  a  defendant's  liability  .  .  .” \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 557. A plaintiff is not required to make “detailed factual allegations,” but \nthere  must  be  more  than  “an  unadorned,  the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me  accusation.” \nIqbal,  556  U.S.  at  678  (citations  omitted).    However,  “legal  conclusions  and  conclusory \nallegations merely reciting the elements of the claim are not entitled to this presumption of \ntruth,” McCauley v. City of Chicago, 671 F.3d 611, 616 (7th Cir. 2011) (citing Iqbal, 556 U.S. at \n678), nor should a court “strain to find inferences favorable to plaintiffs” or accept unreasonable \ninferences. Caldwell v. City of Elwood, Ind., 959 F.2d 670, 673 (7th Cir. 1992). \nQualified  immunity  is  properly  raised  in  a  Rule  12(b)(6)  motion  because  qualified \nimmunity should be resolved as soon as possible, which is sometimes at the pleadings stage. \nSerrano v. Guevara, 315 F. Supp. 3d 1026, 1034 (N.D. Ill. 2018) (citing Doe v. Vill. of Arlington \nHeights, 782 F.3d 911, 915–16 (7th Cir. 2015)). The entitlement to qualified immunity “is an \nimmunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability,” and, as such, should be decided at the \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 15 Filed: 04/15/20 Page 4 of 11 PageID #:85\nearliest possible stage in the litigation. Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227, 112 S. Ct. 534, 536 \n(1991) (quoting Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S. Ct. 2806 (1985)); see also \nPearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231, 129 S. Ct. 808, 815 (2009).  \nARGUMENT \nI.  REID IS ENTITLED TO QUALIFIED IMMUNITY. \n \nPlaintiffs allege that Reid must accept election petitions electronically otherwise  their \nrights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution will be violated.  Dkt. 1. This acceptance of an \nelectronic petition serves as the basis for most, if not all, of Plaintiffs’ claims against Reid. Reid, \nhowever, is entitled to qualified immunity because Reid cannot act contrary to clearly established \nlaw based on the specific facts confronting him and the information he currently possesses.  \nThe  doctrine  of  qualified  immunity  protects  government  officials  performing \ndiscretionary functions from liability to the extent that their conduct “could reasonably have been \nthought consistent with the rights they are alleged to have violated.” Anderson v. Creighton, 483 \nU.S. 635, 638-39, 107 S. Ct. 3034 (1987); see also McAllister v. Price, 615 F.3d 877, 881 (7th \nCir. 2010) (citing Pearson, 555 U.S. at 231, 129 S. Ct. at 815). Essentially, qualified immunity \nprotects “all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.” Malley v. \nBriggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S. Ct. 1092, 1098 (1986); see also Hughes v. Meyer, 880 F.2d \n967, 970 (7th Cir. 1989).  “In determining qualified immunity, a court asks two questions: (1) \nwhether the facts, taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, make out a violation of a \nconstitutional right and (2) whether that constitutional right was clearly established at the time of \nthe alleged violation.” Hernandez v. Sheahan, 711 F.3d 816, 817 (7th Cir. 2013) (citing Pearson, \n555 U.S. at 232). Courts may exercise discretion in deciding which question to address first. Id. \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 15 Filed: 04/15/20 Page 5 of 11 PageID #:86\nWhether an [employee] has qualified immunity is a question of law for the judge to decide. See \nWhitt v. Smith, 832 F.2d 451, 453 (7th Cir. 1987).  \nPlaintiffs invoke their constitutional rights to the First Amendment freedom to petition \nand freedom of speech. Plaintiffs, however, “may not escape the doctrine of qualified immunity \nby alleging a violation of a clearly established, but very broad constitutional right.” Bakalis v. \nGolembeski, 35 F.3d 318, 323 (7th Cir. 1994). Instead, in determining whether a constitutional \nright was clearly established, the analysis “must be undertaken in light of the specific context of \nthe case, not as a broad general proposition.” Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S. Ct. \n2151, 2156 (2001); see also Alicea v. Thomas, 815 F.3d 283, 291 (7th Cir. 2016) (The “clearly \nestablished” inquiry requires examining the right “in a particularized sense, rather than at a high \nlevel of generality.”). “‘[T]he crucial question [is] whether the official acted reasonably in the \nparticular circumstances that he or she faced.” Reed v. Palmer, 906 F.3d 540, 547 (7th Cir. \n2018) (quoting Kemp v. Liebel, 877 F.3d 346, 351 (alterations in original) (emphasis added) \n(quoting Plumhoff v. Rickard, 572 U.S. 765, 134 S. Ct. 2012, 2023 (2014)). “‘To be clearly \nestablished at the time of the challenged conduct, the right’s contours must be sufficiently clear \nthat every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right....’” \nReed, 906 F.3d at 547 (quoting Kemp, 877 F.3d at 351 (alteration in original) (quoting Gustafson \nv. Adkins, 803 F.3d 883, 891 (7th Cir. 2015)). In other words, it must be clear to a reasonable \n[employee] that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted. Purtell v. Mason, 527 \nF.3d  615,  621  (7th  Cir.  2008).  This  determination  requires  the  Court  to  “consider  the \n[employee]’s actions in light of all the particular circumstances the [employee] faced at the time \nand then compare them with the then-existing law.” Ulichny v. Merton Cmty. Sch. Dist., 249 \nF.3d 686, 701 (7th Cir. 2001). “Ultimately, the question for qualified immunity ‘is whether the \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 15 Filed: 04/15/20 Page 6 of 11 PageID #:87\nstate of the law at the time that [the Defendant] acted gave [him] reasonable notice that [his] \nactions violated the Constitution.” Roe v. Elyea, 631 F.3d 843, 858 (7th Cir. 2011). “As long as \nan employee ‘of reasonable competence could disagree on [the] issue, immunity should be \nrecognized.’” Purtell, 527 F.3d at 621. Plaintiffs bear the burden demonstrating the violation of a \nclearly established right.” Purtell, 527 F.3d at 621.   The only act that Reid is allowed to perform \nunder the Illinois Election Code is to accept petitions.  Reid has no discretion in how petitions \nare  circulated,  nor  does  the  Illinois  Election  Code  allow  Reid  to  mandate  such  electronic \ncirculation.  In addition, until the Illinois State Election Code or the provisions of the Illinois \nConstitution that require the petition ballots be accompanied by an affidavit and be filed in \nperson, are found to be unconstitutional or are amended, Reid cannot accept the petition ballots \nelectronically.  Reid has no choice but to continue to follow the Illinois Election Code and \nIllinois Constitution until one or both are found to be unconstitutional or are amended.  At that \ntime  and  only  at  that  time,  if  Reid  then  refused  to  accept  the  electronic  petitions,  would \nPlaintiffs’ rights be violated.  As the law stands now however, Reid is entitled to qualified \nimmunity and Plaintiffs’ complaint should be dismissed. \nII.  PLAINTIFFS  DO  NOT  HAVE  STANDING  AS  THIS  ACTION  IS  NOT  RIPE \nAGAINST REID. \n \nThe Complaint does not allege that a single plaintiff has, in fact, suffered any actual \ninjury as it pertains to Reid. “[A] plaintiff seeking relief in federal court must first demonstrate \nthat he has standing to do so, including that he has ‘a personal stake in the outcome,’ distinct \nfrom a ‘generally available grievance about government.” Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1923 \n(2018). In order to have standing, “[t]he plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that \nis fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed \nby a favorable judicial decision.” Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016). “The \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 15 Filed: 04/15/20 Page 7 of 11 PageID #:88\nplaintiff,  as  the  party  invoking  federal  jurisdiction,  bears  the  burden  of  establishing  these \nelements. Where, as here, a case is at the pleading stage, the plaintiff must ‘clearly…allege facts \ndemonstrating’ each element.” Id. (citation omitted).   \na.  Plaintiffs’ fail to allege an injury in fact as it pertains to Reid. \nPlaintiffs’  claims  against  Reid  “are  too  speculative  to  create  a  concrete  dispute.”  \nConstruction and General Laborer’s Union No. 330 v. Town of Grand Chute, 915 F.3d 1120, \n1127 (7th Cir. 2019).  Plaintiffs assert Illinois statutory and constitutional requirements stifle their \nFirst Amendment right to petition by requiring physical signatures and an affidavit.  Dkt 1.  \nPlaintiffs’ entire Complaint is devoid of any allegations specifically pertaining to Reid, other than \nParagraph 35 where Plaintiffs express their desire to file a petition with Reid.  Id.  Paragraph 35 \ndoes not allege any action or inaction by Reid.  Id.   Instead it is merely a recitation of Plaintiffs’ \nfailure to have obtained the necessary signatures in a timely fashion and speculation that now they \nwill be unable to do so. \nIn General Laborer’s Union, the municipality passed an ordinance banning signs located \nin the public right of way.  General Laborer’s Union, 915 F. 3d at 1126.  The Union sued, \nalleging the ordinance would restrict their First Amendment rights in the event they protested in \nthe future and wanted to use an inflatable rat.  Id.  The court held their claim regarding the \npossible protests was too speculative and while the potential to utilize an inflatable rat was \ninteresting, the situation had yet to present itself and was therefore not ripe before the court.  Id. at \n1127.   \nHere,  as  in  General  Laborer’s  Union,  Plaintiffs’  allegations  about  petitions  are  too \nspeculative.  First and foremost, only Plaintiff Paller speculates that he wishes to submit a petition \nin the City of Evanston.  Dkt. 1, ¶ 35.  Plaintiff Paller, however, does not allege that he has been \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 15 Filed: 04/15/20 Page 8 of 11 PageID #:89\nunable to do so or that he has even tried.  Dkt. 1.  In fact, Plaintiff Paller alleges that he is not \nrequired to submit the signatures to the City Clerk until August 3, 2020.  Dkt. 1, ¶ 35.  The \nGovernor’s “shelter-in-place” Order is set to expire on April 30, 2020, leaving Plaintiffs with \nseveral  months  to  collect  signatures.    Plaintiffs,  therefore,  cannot  and  have  not  alleged  an \nimminent threat or injury as it pertains to Reid.   \nb.  No Injury is Traceable to Reid. \nPlaintiffs  purported  injury  is  an  inability  to  file  petitions  with  signatures  obtained \nelectronically. Plaintiffs cite to Section 28 of the Illinois Election Code, which requires that \npetition sheets include a sworn and notarized affidavit of the petition circulator that he personally \nwitnessed the signatures of all signers of the petition.  Additionally, Plaintiffs cite the Illinois \nConstitution, which requires that the paper initiative petition pages must be bound and filed in \none book with the appropriate officer.  See Article VII or Article XIV of the Illinois Constitution.  \nIrrespective  of  these  allegations,  Plaintiffs  filed  this  suit  against  Reid,  who  does  not  have \nauthority to unilaterally decide to accept electronic ballot petitions, in violation of established \nState law.  It is therefore entirely unknown how any purported violation of the Plaintiffs rights \ncould be attributed to Reid.           \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS FAIL TO STATE A CLAIM AGAINST REID. \n \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint makes plain, the action allegedly infringing their rights is the Executive \nOrder of the state’s governor.  Dkt. 1, ¶¶ 31-32.  Interestingly, Plaintiffs cite “the health crisis” as a \nfactor making it impossible to collect signatures.  Id.  There are no facts alleged in Plaintiffs’ Complaint \nshowing any action by Reid limiting Plaintiffs’ Constitutional Rights.  Reid is not the state actor \nenacting the challenged legislation and is only responsible for following it.  In this case, the two \nregulations cited by Plaintiffs are the Illinois Election Code requiring petitions—if used—to be filed \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 15 Filed: 04/15/20 Page 9 of 11 PageID #:90\nwith the City Clerk, 10 ILCS 5/28-7, and the Governor’s Executive Order.  Dkt. 1, ¶¶ 34-35.  Reid is not \nresponsible for either regulation.   \nPlaintiffs only mention of Reid or the City of Evanston is in Paragraph 35, noting that \n“[f]or the Evanston local initiative referendum to qualify, Plaintiff Paller must submit 2,800 \nsignatures to the Evanston City Clerk by August 3, 2020.”  Id. at ¶ 35.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint \nleaves Reid in the dark regarding what claim is against him and the foundation for said claim \nresulting in pleading deficient in facts sufficient to place Reid on notice.   \nPlaintiffs allege that they are unable to file petitions, but Reid has no authority or role \nunder state law with respect to the collection of signatures, and Plaintiffs do not allege as such.  \nThere is no evidence Plaintiffs have (or can) put forth showing Reid is preventing Plaintiffs from \ncollecting petitions signed by a number of qualified electors pursuant to the Illinois Election Code.  The \nonly role Reid as City Clerk of the City of Evanston plays in the process pursuant to Illinois Election \nlaw, the Illinois Municipal Code and the Evanston City Code is to allow the petitions to be filed.  See 10 \nILCS 5/28-7; 65 ILCS 5/3.1-35-90; and Evanston City Code § 1-7-2.  Plaintiffs do not argue—nor can \nthey demonstrate— that Reid’s office will not accept petitions signed by a number of qualified electors. \nIV.  REID IS NOT A PROPER DEFENDANT BECAUSE PLAINTIFFS DO NOT PROPERLY \nALLEGE AN OFFICIAL CAPACITY CLAIM. \n \nIncluded among the defendants in Plaintiff’s Complaint is Devon Reid, Evanston City \nClerk, who Plaintiffs purport to sue in his official capacity. Dkt. 1, ¶ 11. A lawsuit against an \nindividual in their official capacity is not a lawsuit against the individual, but rather is a lawsuit \nagainst the governmental entity of which the individual is an agent. Schlicher v. Bd. of Fire & \nPolice Comm’rs of Vill. of Westmont, 363 Ill. App. 3d 869, 883, 845 N.E.2d 55, 67 (2d Dist. \n2006) (citing Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 167, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 3106 (1985)); see also \nOffice of Lake Cty. State’s Attorney v. Human Rights Comm’n, 235 Ill. App. 3d 1036, 1042, 601 \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 15 Filed: 04/15/20 Page 10 of 11 PageID #:91\nN.E.2d 1294, 1298 (2d Dist. 1992). In other words, an official capacity lawsuit is to be treated as \na lawsuit against the governmental entity. Graham, 473 U.S. at 165–66, 105 S. Ct. at 3105; see \nalso Lake Cty. State’s Attorney, 235 Ill. App. 3d at 1042, 601 N.E.2d at 1298 (official capacity \nlawsuit is no different from a lawsuit against the governmental entity itself).  However, Plaintiffs \nfail to allege that the City of Evanston or Reid, in his official capacity, have a policy which \nviolates their rights.  The City of Evanston can only be held liable under Section 1983 when it is \nalleged that the government’s policy or custom inflicts a constitutional injury to Plaintiffs.  \nMonell v.

GANDURSKI,  Corporation  Counsel,  and  through,  Nicholas  E. \nCummings, Deputy City Attorney, and one of her assistants, Alexandra B. Ruggie, Assistant City \nAttorney,  moves  this  Honorable  Court  to  dismiss  the  Plaintiffs’  Amended  Verified  Complaint \nagainst Defendant Reid pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  In support thereof, Reid states as follows: \n \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 40 Filed: 05/11/20 Page 2 of 11 PageID #:388\nINTRODUCTION \n  On April 7, 2020, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint.  Dkt. 1.  Plaintiffs’ filed their Amended \nVerified Complaint on April 27, 2020.  Dkt. 26.  Plaintiffs sued a variety of entities, including the \nEvanston City Clerk, Devon Reid (hereafter “Reid”), in his official capacity.  Notably, Reid is the \nonly  municipal  clerk  named  in  Plaintiffs’  lawsuit,  even  though  Plaintiffs  allege  that  this  is  an \nissue  that  will  affect  the  entire  State  of  Illinois.    Plaintiffs  allege  violations  of  their  First \nAmendment rights and request that Reid accept electronic signatures for a referendum petition.  \nPlaintiffs’ request is misplaced.  Reid is entitled to qualified immunity.  Additionally, the Illinois \nConstitution and the Illinois Election Code control Reid’s ability to allow for electronic signatures \nand therefore, Plaintiffs’ lack standing regarding their claim against Reid.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint \nalso  fails to state a cause of action against Reid.  Plaintiffs allege that their First Amendment \nRights  were violated when the Illinois Governor entered an executive order to shelter in-place.  \nDkt.  26.    Specifically,  Plaintiffs  allege  that  they  are  unable  to  collect  signatures  for  a  ballot \nreferendum  because  of  the  Governor’s  executive  order.    Looking  at  the  totality  of  Plaintiffs’ \nAmended Complaint, it is completely devoid of any allegations that Reid violated their rights and \nshould  therefore  be  dismissed.    Lastly,  Plaintiffs’  Amended  Complaint  should  be  dismissed \nbecause Reid is sued in his official capacity, yet Plaintiffs fail to allege a Monell claim that the \nCity of Evanston has a policy or custom or violating  Plaintiffs’ rights.       \n  Plaintiffs’  Amended  Complaint  against  Reid  should  be  dismissed  pursuant  to  Rule \n12(b)(6) because:  1)  Reid is entitled to qualified immunity; 2) Plaintiffs’ claim is not ripe;  3) \nPlaintiffs fail to state a cause of action against Reid, and 4) Plaintiffs do not bring a Monell claim \nagainst the City, even though they named the Evanston City Clerk in his official capacity. \n \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 40 Filed: 05/11/20 Page 3 of 11 PageID #:389\n \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n  In reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint, a district court must accept all well-plead \nfacts  as  true  and  draw  all  permissible  inferences  in  favor  of the plaintiff.  Agnew v. Nat’l \nCollegiate Athletic Ass’n, 683 F.3d 328, 334 (7th Cir. 2012) (emphasis added).  The Federal \nRules  of  Civil  Procedure  require  a complaint provide the defendant with “fair notice of what \nthe…claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.”  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007) \n(quoting  Bell  Atl.  Corp.  v.  Twombly,  550  U.S.  544,  570  (2007)).    The  Supreme  Court  has \ndescribed this standard as requiring a complaint to “contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as \ntrue, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570).  A complaint falls short of the plausibility standard \nwhere  plaintiff  “pleads  facts  that  are  'merely  consistent  with'  a  defendant's  liability  .  .  .” \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 557. A plaintiff is not required to make “detailed factual allegations,” but \nthere  must  be  more  than  “an  unadorned,  the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me  accusation.” \nIqbal,  556  U.S.  at  678  (citations  omitted).    However,  “legal  conclusions  and  conclusory \nallegations  merely  reciting  the  elements  of  the  claim  are  not  entitled  to  this  presumption  of \ntruth,” McCauley v. City of Chicago, 671 F.3d 611, 616 (7th Cir. 2011) (citing Iqbal, 556 U.S. at \n678),  nor  should  a  court  “strain  to  find  inferences  favorable  to  plaintiffs”  or  accept \nunreasonable inferences. Caldwell v. City of Elwood, Ind., 959 F.2d 670, 673 (7th Cir. 1992). \nQualified  immunity  is  properly  raised  in  a  Rule  12(b)(6)  motion  because  qualified \nimmunity  should  be  resolved  as  soon  as  possible,  which is sometimes at the pleadings stage. \nSerrano v. Guevara, 315 F. Supp. 3d 1026, 1034 (N.D. Ill. 2018) (citing Doe v. Vill. of Arlington \nHeights,  782  F.3d  911,  915–16  (7th  Cir. 2015)). The entitlement to qualified immunity “is an \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 40 Filed: 05/11/20 Page 4 of 11 PageID #:390\nimmunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability,” and, as such, should be decided at the \nearliest possible stage in the litigation. Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227, 112 S. Ct. 534, 536 \n(1991)  (quoting  Mitchell  v.  Forsyth,  472  U.S.  511,  526,  105  S.  Ct.  2806  (1985));  see also \nPearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231, 129 S. Ct. 808, 815 (2009).  \nARGUMENT \nI.  REID IS ENTITLED TO QUALIFIED IMMUNITY. \n \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  Reid  must  accept  election  petitions  electronically  otherwise  their \nrights  guaranteed  by  the  U.S.  Constitution  will  be  violated.    Dkt. 26. This acceptance of an \nelectronic petition serves as the basis for most, if not all, of Plaintiffs’ claims against Reid. Reid, \nhowever, is entitled to qualified immunity because Reid cannot act contrary to clearly established \nlaw based on the specific facts confronting him and the information  he currently possesses.  \nThe  doctrine  of  qualified  immunity  protects  government  officials  performing \ndiscretionary functions from liability to the extent that their conduct “could reasonably have been \nthought consistent with the rights they are alleged to have violated.” Anderson v. Creighton, 483 \nU.S. 635, 638-39, 107 S. Ct. 3034 (1987); see also McAllister v. Price, 615 F.3d 877, 881 (7th \nCir. 2010) (citing Pearson, 555 U.S. at 231, 129 S. Ct. at 815). Essentially, qualified immunity \nprotects  “all  but  the  plainly  incompetent  or  those  who knowingly violate the law.”  Malley v. \nBriggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S. Ct. 1092, 1098 (1986); see also Hughes v. Meyer, 880 F.2d \n967,  970  (7th  Cir. 1989).  “In determining qualified immunity, a court asks two questions: (1) \nwhether  the facts, taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, make out a violation of a \nconstitutional right and (2) whether that constitutional right was clearly established at the time of \nthe alleged violation.” Hernandez v. Sheahan, 711 F.3d 816, 817 (7th Cir. 2013) (citing Pearson, \n555 U.S. at 232). Courts may exercise discretion in deciding which question to address first. Id. \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 40 Filed: 05/11/20 Page 5 of 11 PageID #:391\nWhether an [employee] has qualified immunity is a question of law for the judge to decide. See \nWhitt v. Smith, 832 F.2d 451, 453 (7th Cir. 1987).  \nPlaintiffs  invoke  their  constitutional  rights  to  the  First  Amendment  freedom  to petition \nand freedom of speech. Plaintiffs, however, “may not escape the doctrine of qualified immunity \nby  alleging a violation of a clearly established, but very broad constitutional right.”  Bakalis v. \nGolembeski, 35 F.3d 318, 323 (7th Cir. 1994). Instead, in determining whether a constitutional \nright was clearly established, the analysis “must be undertaken in light of the specific context of \nthe case, not as a broad general proposition.”  Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S. Ct. \n2151, 2156 (2001); see also Alicea v. Thomas, 815 F.3d 283, 291 (7th Cir. 2016) (The “clearly \nestablished” inquiry requires examining the right “in a particularized sense, rather than at a high \nlevel of generality.”). “‘[T]he crucial question [is] whether the official acted reasonably in the \nparticular circumstances that he or she faced.” Reed v. Palmer, 906 F.3d 540, 547 (7th Cir. \n2018)  (quoting  Kemp  v.  Liebel,  877  F.3d  346,  351  (alterations  in  original)  (emphasis  added) \n(quoting  Plumhoff  v.  Rickard, 572 U.S. 765, 134 S. Ct. 2012, 2023 (2014)). “‘To be clearly \nestablished at the time of the challenged conduct, the right’s contours must be sufficiently clear \nthat every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right....’” \nReed, 906 F.3d at 547 (quoting Kemp, 877 F.3d at 351 (alteration in original) (quoting Gustafson \nv. Adkins, 803 F.3d 883, 891 (7th Cir. 2015)). In other words, it must be clear to a reasonable \n[employee] that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted. Purtell v. Mason, 527 \nF.3d  615,  621  (7th  Cir.  2008).  This  determination  requires  the  Court  to  “consider  the \n[employee]’s actions in light of all the particular circumstances the [employee] faced at the time \nand then compare them with the then-existing law.” Ulichny v. Merton Cmty. Sch. Dist., 249 \nF.3d 686, 701 (7th Cir. 2001). “Ultimately, the question for qualified immunity ‘is whether the \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 40 Filed: 05/11/20 Page 6 of 11 PageID #:392\nstate of the law at the time that [the Defendant] acted gave [him] reasonable notice that [his] \nactions violated the Constitution.” Roe v. Elyea, 631 F.3d 843, 858 (7th Cir. 2011). “As long as \nan  employee  ‘of  reasonable  competence  could  disagree  on  [the]  issue,  immunity  should  be \nrecognized.’” Purtell, 527 F.3d at 621. Plaintiffs bear the burden demonstrating the violation of a \nclearly established right.” Purtell, 527 F.3d at 621.   The only act that Reid is allowed to perform \nunder the Illinois Election Code is to accept petitions.  Reid has no discretion in how petitions \nare  circulated,  nor  does  the  Illinois  Election  Code  allow  Reid  to  mandate  such  electronic \ncirculation.    In  addition,  until  the  Illinois  State  Election  Code  or  the  provisions  of  the Illinois \nConstitution  that  require  the  petition  ballots  be  accompanied  by  an  affidavit  and  be  filed  in \nperson, are found to be unconstitutional or are amended, Reid cannot accept the petition ballots \nelectronically.    Reid  has  no  choice  but  to  continue  to  follow  the  Illinois  Election  Code  and \nIllinois Constitution until one or both are found to be unconstitutional or are amended.  At that \ntime  and  only  at  that  time,  if  Reid  then  refused  to  accept  the  electronic  petitions,  would \nPlaintiffs’  rights  be  violated.    As  the  law  stands  now  however,  Reid  is  entitled  to  qualified \nimmunity  and Plaintiffs’ complaint  should be dismissed. \nII.  PLAINTIFFS  DO  NOT  HAVE  STANDING  AS  THIS  ACTION  IS  NOT  RIPE \nAGAINST REID. \n \nThe Amended Complaint does not allege that a single plaintiff has, in fact, suffered any \nactual  injury  as  it  pertains  to  Reid.  “[A]  plaintiff  seeking  relief  in  federal  court  must  first \ndemonstrate  that  he  has  standing  to  do  so,  including  that  he  has  ‘a  personal  stake  in  the \noutcome,’ distinct  from  a  ‘generally  available  grievance  about  government.” Gill v. Whitford, \n138 S. Ct. 1916, 1923 (2018). In order to have standing, “[t]he plaintiff must have (1) suffered an \ninjury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that \nis likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 40 Filed: 05/11/20 Page 7 of 11 PageID #:393\n1540, 1547 (2016). “The plaintiff, as the party invoking federal jurisdiction, bears the burden of \nestablishing these elements. Where, as here, a case is at the pleading stage, the plaintiff must \n‘clearly…allege facts demonstrating’ each element.” Id. (citation omitted).   \na.  Plaintiffs’ fail to allege an injury in fact as it pertains to Reid. \nPlaintiffs’  claims  against  Reid  “are  too  speculative  to  create  a  concrete  dispute.”  \nConstruction and General Laborer’s Union No. 330 v. Town of Grand Chute, 915 F.3d 1120, \n1127 (7th Cir. 2019).  Plaintiffs assert Illinois statutory and constitutional requirements stifle their \nFirst  Amendment  right  to  petition  by  requiring  physical  signatures  and  an  affidavit.    Dkt  26.  \nPlaintiffs’ entire Complaint is devoid of any allegations specifically pertaining to Reid, other than \nParagraph 38 where Plaintiffs express their desire to file a petition with Reid.  Id.  Paragraph 38 \ndoes not allege any action or inaction by Reid.  Id.   Instead it is merely a recitation of Plaintiffs’ \nfailure to have obtained the necessary signatures in a timely fashion and speculation that now they \nwill be unable to do so. \nIn General Laborer’s Union, the municipality passed an ordinance banning signs located \nin  the  public  right of way.  General Laborer’s Union, 915 F. 3d at 1126.  The Union sued, \nalleging the ordinance would restrict their First Amendment rights in the event they protested in \nthe  future  and  wanted  to  use  an inflatable rat.   Id.  The court held their claim regarding the \npossible  protests  was  too  speculative  and  while  the  potential  to  utilize  an  inflatable  rat  was \ninteresting, the situation had yet to present itself and was therefore not ripe before the court.  Id. at \n1127.   \nHere,  as  in  General  Laborer’s  Union,  Plaintiffs’  allegations  about  petitions  are  too \nspeculative.  First and foremost, only Plaintiff Paller speculates that he wishes to submit a petition \nin the City of Evanston.  Dkt. 1, ¶ 38.  Plaintiff Paller, however, does not allege that he has been \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 40 Filed: 05/11/20 Page 8 of 11 PageID #:394\nunable to do so or that he has even tried.  Dkt. 26.  In fact, Plaintiff Paller alleges that he is not \nrequired to submit the signatures to the City Clerk until August 3, 2020.  Dkt. 26, ¶ 38.  The \nGovernor’s  “shelter-in-place”  Order  is  set  to  expire  on  May  30,  2020,  leaving  Plaintiffs  with \nseveral  months  to  collect  signatures.    Plaintiffs,  therefore,  cannot  and  have  not  alleged  an \nimminent  threat or injury  as it pertains to Reid.   \nb.  No Injury is Traceable to Reid. \nPlaintiffs  purported  injury  is  an  inability  to  file  petitions  with  signatures  obtained \nelectronically.  Plaintiffs  cite  to  Section  28  of  the  Illinois  Election  Code,  which  requires  that \npetition sheets include a sworn and notarized affidavit of the petition circulator that he personally \nwitnessed  the  signatures  of  all  signers  of  the  petition.    Additionally, Plaintiffs cite the Illinois \nConstitution,  which  requires  that the paper initiative petition pages must be bound and filed in \none book with the appropriate officer.  See Article VII or Article XIV of the Illinois Constitution.  \nIrrespective  of  these  allegations,  Plaintiffs  filed  this  suit  against  Reid,  who  does  not  have \nauthority  to  unilaterally  decide  to  accept  electronic  ballot  petitions,  in  violation  of  established \nState law.  It is therefore entirely unknown how any purported violation of the Plaintiffs rights \ncould be attributed to Reid.           \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS FAIL TO STATE A CLAIM AGAINST REID. \n \nPlaintiffs’ Amended Complaint makes plain, the action allegedly infringing their rights is the \nExecutive Order of the state’s governor.  Dkt. 26, ¶¶ 29-31.  Interestingly, Plaintiffs cite “the health \ncrisis” as a factor making it impossible to collect signatures.  Id.  There are no facts alleged in Plaintiffs’ \nAmended Complaint showing any action by Reid limiting Plaintiffs’ Constitutional Rights.  Reid is not \nthe state actor enacting the challenged legislation and is only responsible for following it.  In this case, \nthe two regulations cited by Plaintiffs are the Illinois Election Code requiring petitions—if used—to be \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 40 Filed: 05/11/20 Page 9 of 11 PageID #:395\nfiled with the City Clerk, 10 ILCS 5/28-7, and the Governor’s Executive Order.  Dkt. 1, ¶¶ 34-35.  Reid \nis not responsible for either regulation.   \nPlaintiffs  only  mention  of  Reid  or  the City of Evanston is in  Paragraph 38, noting that \n“[f]or  the  Evanston  local  initiative  referendum  to  qualify,  Plaintiff  Paller  must  submit  2,800 \nsignatures to the Evanston City Clerk by August 3, 2020.”  Dkt. 26, ¶ 38.  Plaintiffs’ Amended \nComplaint leaves Reid in the dark regarding what claim is against him and the foundation for said \nclaim resulting in pleading deficient in facts sufficient to place Reid on notice.   \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  they  are  unable  to  file petitions, but Reid has no authority or role \nunder state law with respect to the collection of signatures, and Plaintiffs do not allege as such.  \nThere is no evidence Plaintiffs have (or can) put forth showing Reid is preventing Plaintiffs from \ncollecting petitions signed by a number of qualified electors pursuant to the Illinois Election Code.  The \nonly role Reid as City Clerk of the City of Evanston plays in the process pursuant to Illinois Election \nlaw, the Illinois Municipal Code and the Evanston City Code is to allow the petitions to be filed.  See 10 \nILCS 5/28-7; 65 ILCS 5/3.1-35-90; and Evanston City Code § 1-7-2.  Plaintiffs do not argue—nor can \nthey demonstrate— that Reid’s office will not accept petitions signed by a number of qualified electors. \nIV.  REID IS NOT A PROPER DEFENDANT BECAUSE PLAINTIFFS DO NOT PROPERLY \nALLEGE AN OFFICIAL CAPACITY CLAIM. \n \nIncluded  among  the  defendants  in  Plaintiff’s  Amended  Complaint  is  Devon  Reid, \nEvanston  City  Clerk,  who  Plaintiffs  purport  to  sue  in  his  official  capacity.  Dkt. 26, ¶ 11. A \nlawsuit against an individual in their official capacity is not a lawsuit against the individual, but \nrather is a lawsuit against the governmental entity of which the individual is an agent. Schlicher \nv. Bd. of Fire & Police Comm’rs of Vill. of Westmont, 363 Ill. App. 3d 869, 883, 845 N.E.2d 55, \n67 (2d Dist. 2006) (citing Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 167, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 3106 (1985)); \nsee also Office of Lake Cty. State’s Attorney v. Human Rights Comm’n, 235 Ill. App. 3d 1036, \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 40 Filed: 05/11/20 Page 10 of 11 PageID #:396\n1042, 601 N.E.2d 1294, 1298 (2d Dist. 1992). In other words, an official capacity lawsuit is to be \ntreated as a lawsuit against the governmental entity. Graham, 473 U.S. at 165–66, 105 S. Ct. at \n3105; see also Lake Cty. State’s Attorney, 235 Ill. App. 3d at 1042, 601 N.E.2d at 1298 (official \ncapacity lawsuit is no different from a lawsuit against the governmental entity itself).  However, \nPlaintiffs fail to allege that the City of Evanston or Reid, in his official capacity, have a policy \nwhich  violates  their rights.  The City of Evanston can only be held liable under Section 1983 \nwhen  it  is  alleged  that  the  government’s  policy  or  custom  inflicts  a  constitutional  injury  to \nPlaintiffs.  Monell v. Department of Social Services of City of New York, 436 U.S. 658, 694 \n(1978).  Plaintiffs have made no such claim here and therefore made no valid claim against either \nthe City of Evanston or Reid, in his official capacity.    \nCONCLUSION \nDefendant, DEVON REID, in his official capacity as Clerk of the City of Evanston, for \nall  of  the  foregoing  reasons,  respectfully  requests  this  Honorable  Court  dismiss  Plaintiffs’ \nAmended Verified Complaint  with prejudice and any other relief this Court deems appropriate. \n              Respectfully submitted, \n              KELLEY A.

This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action by virtue of \nU.S.C.  § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction), this being a case arising under the United \nStates Constitution and  42 U.S.C. § 1983; 28 U.S.C. § 2201 (authorizing declaratory \n \n4 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 26 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 5 of 18 PageID #:184\nrelief);  28  U.S.C.  §  2202  (authorizing  injunctive  relief);  and  28  U.S.C.  §  1367 \n(supplemental jurisdiction).  \n15. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(e) and 1402(a) and 5 \nU.S.C. § 703. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND   \n \n16. Article XIV, Section 3 of the Illinois Constitution provides that \nAmendments to Article IV of this Constitution may be proposed by a petition \nsigned by a number of electors equal in number to at least eight percent of the \ntotal votes cast for candidates for Governor in the preceding gubernatorial \nelection. Amendments shall be limited to structural and procedural subjects \ncontained  in  Article  IV.  A  petition  shall  contain  the  text  of  the  proposed \namendment  and  the  date  of  the  general  election  at  which  the  proposed \namendment  is  to  be  submitted,  shall  have  been  signed  by  the  petitioning \nelectors not more than twenty-four months preceding that general election and \nshall be filed with the Secretary of State at least six months before that general \nelection.  The  procedure  for  determining  the  validity  and  sufficiency  of  a \npetition shall be provided by law. If the petition is valid and sufficient, the \nproposed amendment shall be submitted to the electors at that general election \nand shall become effective if approved by either three-fifths of those voting on \nthe amendment or a majority of those voting in the election. \n \n17.  Article VII, Section 11 of the Illinois Constitution provides that  \n(a)  Proposals for actions which are authorized by this Article or by law and \nwhich require approval by referendum may be initiated and submitted to the \nelectors by resolution of the governing board of a unit of local government or \nby petition of electors in the manner provided by law. \n (b)  Referenda required by this Article shall be held at general elections, except \nas otherwise provided by law. Questions submitted to referendum shall be \nadopted if approved by a majority of those voting on the question unless a \ndifferent requirement is specified in this Article. \n \n \n5 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 26 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 6 of 18 PageID #:185\n18. Article III, Section 3 of the Illinois Constitution provides that “[a]ll elections shall \nbe free and equal.”  \n19. On May 27, 2019, both houses of the Illinois General Assembly adopted Senate \nJoint Resolution Constitutional Amendment 1 which, pursuant to Article XIV, Section 2 \nof the Illinois Constitution, placed a constitutional amendment referendum known as \nthe “Fair Tax Amendment” on the ballot for the November 3, 2020 general election.  \n20. The General Assembly has not officially approved a brief explanation in favor of \nthe  Fair  Tax  Amendment  or  a  brief  explanation  opposed  to  such  amendment  as \nrequired  by  the  Illinois  Constitutional  Amendment  Act  (5  ICLS  20/2).    Thus,  the \ntranslation, publication, and other deadlines to prepare the ballot pamphlet regarding \nthe Amendment, which must be mailed by the Secretary of State to every mailing \naddress in the state, are delayed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 virus. \n21. On  November  14,  2019,  the  Illinois  General  Assembly  adopted  a  resolution \ncreating the Illinois Joint Commission on Lobbying and Ethics Reform. This body was \ncharged with examining current Illinois legislation regarding ethics reform, soliciting \nfeedback from experts and the general public, and releasing a final report with its \nreview and recommendations by no later than March 31, 2020.  \n22. Sometime around December 2019, an outbreak of respiratory disease now known \nas COVID-19, or coronavirus, emerged in Wuhan, China.  \n \n6 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 26 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 7 of 18 PageID #:186\n23. Since then, the outbreak has spread to the majority of the world, with the United \nStates reporting the most cases.  \n24. On  February  27,  2020,  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  issued  guidance  in \nresponse to COVID-19 which recommended, among other things, the practice of social \ndistancing.  \n25. On March 9, 2020, the Governor of Illinois proclaimed the entire state a disaster \narea1  and  later  banned  gatherings  of  1,000  people  or  more  and  closed  all  schools, \nrestaurants, and bars.2 \n26. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a \nglobal pandemic.  \n27. On  March  13,  2020,  the  President  of  the  United  States  declared  a  national \nemergency. \n28.  On March 15, 2020, the Illinois General Assembly suspended session indefinitely \ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic.   \n29. On March 20, 2020, the Governor of Illinois ordered everyone to shelter at home \nwith  the  exception  of  “essential”  activities  and  services,  and  to  maintain  six  foot \ndistance from others.3 \n                                                           \n1 https://www2.illinois.gov/sites/gov/Documents/APPROVED%20- \n%20Coronavirus%20Disaster%20Proc%20WORD.pdf. \n2 https://www2.illinois.gov/Pages/Executive-Orders/ExecutiveOrder2020-04.aspx. \n3 https://www2.illinois.gov/Pages/Executive-Orders/ExecutiveOrder2020-10.aspx. \n \n7 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 26 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 8 of 18 PageID #:187\n30.  On March 31, 2020, the co-chairs of the commission on Lobbying and Ethics \nReform stated that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the commission would be unable to \nreach the March 31, 2020 deadline and would therefore make no recommendations on \nlobbying and ethics reform.   \n31. On April 23, 2020, the Governor extended his March 20, 2020 executive order to \nMay 30, 2020.4 Pursuant to the executive order the office of the Secretary of State is \nclosed to the public.  \n32. Because of the uncertainty of this health crisis, it is unknown when the order will \nbe lifted or when traditional initiative petition passing may resume.  \n33. Circulating initiative petitions is not listed as an “essential” activity under the \nGovernor’s  order.  The  health  crisis  coupled  with  the  Governor’s  orders  makes  it \neffectively impossible to gather signatures in Illinois. In addition, gathering signatures \nduring the health crisis would endanger the health of the circulators and that of the \npublic at large.  \n34. A  number  of  states  have  taken  action  to  protect  the  constitutional  right  to \npetition and vote in the midst of this health crisis. For example, on March 19, 2020, the \nGovernor  of  New  Jersey  issued  an  executive  order  to  the  Secretary  of  State  to \nimplement  online  petitioning  and  signature  collection.5  On  April  2,  2020,  Florida’s \n                                                           \n4 https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/coronavirus/pritzker-expected-to-extend-illinois-stay-at-home-order-\nthursday-sources/2260588/ \n5 https://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/assets/pdf/candidate/EO-105.pdf \n \n8 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 26 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 9 of 18 PageID #:188\nSecretary of State signed an emergency order allowing for the collection of petition \nsignatures online.6 Moreover, the Arizona Secretary of State has provided an online \npetitioning mechanism for candidates since 2015 and has recently stated she “wouldn’t \noppose” use of that system for ballot measures during the pandemic as a “reasonable \noption for protecting and supporting continuity in our democratic process”.7 On March \n14, 2020, the Governor of New York issued an executive order reducing the required \nnumber of petition signatures for all petitions for ballot access to 30% of  the state \nthreshold.8 Moreover, the Oklahoma Secretary of State issued an order on March 18, \n2020 tolling the 90-day period for circulating initiative petitions. \n35. On April 17, 2020, the Massachusetts Supreme Court extended petition filing \ndeadlines, reduced petition signature requirements, and provided for online petition \nsignature collection.9 \n36. On April 20, 2020, a federal district court in Michigan also extended petition \nfiling  deadlines,  reduced  petition  signature  requirements,  and  ordered  an  online \npetition signature election method to be established.10 \n37. In order for Plaintiffs’ constitutional amendment referendum to qualify for the \nNovember  3,,  2020  general  election,  they  must  submit  363,813  initiative  petition \n                                                           \n6 https://dos.myflorida.com/media/702874/1ser20-2.pdf \n7 https://apps.azsos.gov/equal/ \n8 https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-signs-executive-order-\ntemporarily-modifying-election \n9 https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2020/04/17/12931.pdf \n10 https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/judge-extends-filing-deadline-michigan-candidates-citing-\ncoronavirus \n \n9 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 26 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 10 of 18 PageID #:189\nsignatures to the Illinois Secretary of State by May 3, 2020. See Article XIV, Section 3 of \nthe Illinois Constitution and Section 28-9 of the Illinois Election Code. The Plaintiffs \nmust physically deliver the hand written signature on paper petitions securely bound to \nthe official office of the Secretary of State.  \n38. For  the  Evanston  local  initiative  referendum  to  qualify,  Plaintiff  Paller  must \nsubmit 2,800 signatures to the Evanston City Clerk by August 3,, 2020. See Article VII, \nSection 11 of the Illinois Constitution and Section 28-7 of the Illinois Election Code.  \n39. Because of the current health crisis, on April 23, 2020, Judge Pallmeyer issued a \npreliminary  injunction  on  behalf  of  various  candidates  enjoining  various  election \nrequirements,  decreasing  the  amount  of  required  signatures  for  some  candidates, \nextending the deadlines for candidates to qualify for the general election ballot on \nNovember 3, 2020, and provided for an online petition collection procedure. Exhibit 7, \nPallmeyer Order. \n40.  Subsequent  to  Judge  Pallmeyer’s  order,  Defendant  State  Board  of  Elections \nstated that its directors “think the order serves the best interests of all parties involved.”  \nLikewise, a spokesperson for the Governor publicly stated that “[i]n light of the fact that \nthe period for these candidates to gather signatures is occurring during the COVID-19 \npandemic,  the  governor  supports  the  court’s  order  allowing  candidates  additional \n \n10 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 26 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 11 of 18 PageID #:190\nmeans to obtain actual signatures for their ballot petitions, such as through email, and \nadditional time in which to submit those petitions.”11 \n41. The traditional procedure in existing Illinois law for collecting initiative petitions \nis  identical  to  and  indistinguishable  from  the  traditional  procedure  for  collecting \npetition signatures for candidates.  \n42. Apart from judicial relief, the Plaintiffs have no way to exercise their right to \npetition and speech without jeopardizing their health and the health of the general \npublic.  \nCOUNT I \nRIGHT TO PETITION AND SPEECH \n \n43. The allegations contained in all preceding paragraphs are incorporated here by \nreference. \n44. Plaintiffs’ rights to petition and speech are protected by the First Amendment to \nthe United States Constitution in conjunction with Article XIV, Section 3; Article VII, \nSection 11; and Article III, Section 3 of the Illinois Constitution. Section 28 of the Illinois \nElection Code also requires statewide and local initiative referendum petition sheets to \ncontain a sworn and notarized affidavit of the petition circulator that he personally \nwitnessed the signatures of all signers of the petition and the notary attesting that he \nwitnessed the signature of the circulator. In addition, initiative petition signatures must \nbe handwritten by the signer on a paper petition. Finally, the paper initiative petition \n                                                           \n11 https://capitolnewsillinois.com/NEWS/third-party-candidates-ballot-access-rules-officially-loosened \n \n11 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 26 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 12 of 18 PageID #:191\npages must be bound and filed in one book with the appropriate officer as designated \nby Article VII or Article XIV of the Illinois Constitution.  \n45. Under  the  circumstances,  the  Illinois  petition  collection  requirements  unduly \nburden and violate Plaintiffs’ rights to petition and speech.  \n46. A real and actual controversy exists between the parties.  \n47.  Plaintiffs have no actual remedy at law other than this action. \n48. Plaintiffs are suffering, and will continue to suffer, irreparable harm until they \nobtain relief from this Court.  \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the relief set forth \nin the prayer for relief below. \nCOUNT II \nRIGHT TO EQUAL PROTECTION AND DUE PROCESS \n \n49.  The allegations contained in all preceding paragraphs are incorporated here \nby reference. \n50.  Under  the  present  circumstances,  Illinois’  petition  collection  requirements \nunduly burden and violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution as well as Article I, Section 2; \nArticle  III,  Section  3;  Article  VII,  Section  11;  and  Article  XIV,  Section  3  of  Illinois \nConstitution. \n51.       A real and actual controversy exists between the parties.  \n \n12 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 26 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 13 of 18 PageID #:192\n52.

Plaintiffs are suffering, and will continue to suffer, irreparable harm until \nthey obtain relief from this Court.  \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the relief set forth in \nthe prayer for relief. \nCOUNT III \nILLINOIS CONSTITUTION \n \n54.         The allegations and facts in all preceding paragraphs are incorporated here \nby reference. \n55.          Plaintiffs’ right to ballot access is protected by the Illinois Constitution in \nArticle XIV, Section 3; Article VII, Section 11; and Article III, Section 3 (the “Free and \nEqual Elections” clause). Uniform application of ballot access requirements is required \nunder Article I, Section 2 of the Equal Protection Clause of the Illinois Constitution. \n56.          The right to vote is a fundamental right in Illinois. Orr v Edgar, 283 Ill. App. \n3d 1088, 1100 (1st Dist. 1996). A two-tiered voter registration has been found to violate \nconstitutional rights. Id. at 1090. In a case dealing with directly with article XIV section \n3,  the  Illinois  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  the  right  of  initiative  petition  is \n“intertwined” with the right to vote. Coalition for Political Honesty v. State Bd. of Elections \nII, 83 Ill. 2d 236, 248 (1980). Strict scrutiny is proper regarding restrictions on the right to \npetition  for  initiatives.  Id.  A  federal  court,  using  strict  scrutiny,  struck  down  a \ngeographic limitation on petitioning for Article XIV, Section 3 for ballot initiatives as it \n \n13 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 26 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 14 of 18 PageID #:193\nwas not the “least onerous” method for the State to achieve its articulated purpose. \nCoalition for Political Honesty v. Illinois State Bd. of Elections, No. 81 C 2718, 1982 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 12411 at *7 (N.D. Ill, Apr. 23, 1982). Plaintiffs are unable to collect initiative \npetition signatures while complying with the relevant provisions of the Illinois Election \nCode and with the stay-at-home and social distancing orders mandated by the Illinois \nGovernor. State action has truncated the petition period available to the Plaintiffs by a \nsignificant number of days before the filing deadline and has prevented Plaintiffs from \npetitioning.  Jones v. McGuffage, 921 F.Supp2d 888 (N.D. Ill. 2013).  \n57.            A limitation on right to access the ballot is unconstitutional if it unduly \nrestricts the rights of groups to gain access to the ballot, or if it dilutes or debases the \nright to vote. Illinois State Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173, 185 \n(1979).  \n 58.  The Court may, and should, extend the May 3, 2020 filing deadline for the \nPlaintiffs’ initiative petition as was done for third party and independent candidates in \nthe case of Libertarian Party of Illinois et. al., v. Pritzker et. al., Case No 2-cv-2112. See \nExhibit 7.  \n59.             A  50%  signature  reduction  to  accommodate  Michigan’s  stay-at-home \norder was recently granted to all duly established candidates by the Eastern District of \nMichigan. See Esshaki v. Whitmer, 2:20-cv-10831-TGB-EAS ECF No. 23. Thus, this Court \nmay, and should, order a lowered signature requirement for the Plaintiffs initiative \n \n14 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 26 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 15 of 18 PageID #:194\npetition as was done for third party and independent candidates in the Libertarian Party \ncase. \n60.          Specific requirements for ballot access must be examined in full. A loss of \nany authorized petition time which is not sufficiently remedied is an injury which must \nbe recognized as a violation of the Fair and Equal Elections and Equal Protection clauses \nof the Illinois Constitution. Such loss also unduly burdens rights under Article XIV, \nSection 3 and Article VII, Section 11 of the Illinois Constitution. A truncated petitioning \nperiod must be addressed by appropriate relief. \n61.          Under  the  circumstances,  the  petition  requirements  unduly  burden  the \nPlaintiffs’ right to petition as protected by the above sections of the Illinois Constitution.  \n62.          A real and actual controversy exists between the parties. \n63.          Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law other than this action. \n64.          Plaintiffs are suffering, and will continue to suffer, irreparable harm unless \nthey obtain relief from this court.  \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the relief set forth \nin the prayer for relief. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court:  \nA.  Assume original jurisdiction over this matter; \n \n15 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 26 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 16 of 18 PageID #:195\nB.   Issue a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction: (i) enjoining \nor  modifying  enforcement  of  Illinois  Election  Code’s  petition  collection \nrequirements for initiative referendums for Illinois' November 3, 2020 general \nelection;  (ii)  enabling  and  requiring  the  Defendants  to  allow  for  initiative \npetitions to be collected in the same manner as ordered by Judge Pallmeyer in \nLibertarian Party of Illinois et. al., v. Pritzker et. al., Case No 2-cv-2112, to wit: \na.   enjoining the circulator’s statement requirement  and notarization \nrequirement in 10 ILCS 5/28-3; \nb.  enjoining the requirement in 10 ICLS 5/28-3 that the petition sheets \nfiled with the Secretary of Stare be originals; and \nc.  allowing petition signers to electronically sigh their signatures; \n(iii) extending the May 3, 2020 deadline for an Article XIV, Section 3 referendum \nto August 3, 2020 or, in the alternative, granting Plaintiffs an additional 55 days \nwhich  they  lost  when  the  petition  period  was  truncated  as  a  result  of  the \nGovernor’s executive orders; and reducing by 50% the number of signatures \nrequired to qualify statewide and Evanston initiative referendums for the general \nelection  ballot  or  some  percentage  of  required  signatures  necessary  to \ndemonstrate substantial public support.  \nC.  Issue a declaratory judgment stating that, in light of the current public health \nemergency caused by the novel coronavirus and executive orders requiring that \n \n16 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 26 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 17 of 18 PageID #:196\nIllinois citizens stay at home  and shelter in place, Illinois' petition collection \nrequirements  for  qualifying  Article  XIV  and  Article  VII  referendums  for  the \ngeneral election cannot be constitutionally enforced; \nD. Issue  a  permanent  injunction  prohibiting  enforcement  of  Illinois'  initiative \npetition  collection  requirements  for  qualifying  Article  XIV  and  Article  VII \nreferendums for the November 3, 2020 general election; \nE.  Order Defendants to pay to Plaintiffs their costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b); \nF.

I am an Illinois registered voter over the age of 18 currently residing at 25904 Derby \nDrive, Monee, IL 60449.  \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 26-1 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 3 of 4 PageID #:200\n2.  I intend to vote at the November 3, 2020, general election which includes a constitutional \namendment  referendum  on  the  Fair  Tax  Amendment  proposed  by  the  Illinois  General \nAssembly pursuant to Article XIV, Section 2 of the Illinois Constitution.  \n3.  I am the Chairman of the Committee for the Illinois Democracy Amendment.  \n4.  The Committee for the Illinois Democracy Amendment is an unincorporated political \nassociation which is registered as a statewide ballot initiative committee with the Illinois State \nBoard of Elections.  \n5.  The Committee is seeking to qualify a constitutional amendment referendum for the \nNovember 3, 2020 general election ballot pursuant to Article XIV, Section 3 of the Illinois \nConstitution. Under Section 28-9 of the Illinois Election Code, the Committee must file at least \n363,813 initiative petition signatures to the Illinois Secretary of State by May 3, 2020, in order to \nqualify the constitutional amendment referendum for the November 3, 2020 ballot. \n6.  I have begun an initiative petition drive for a constitutional amendment referendum on \nthe  Illinois  Democracy  Amendment  pursuant  to  Article  XIV,  Section  3  of  the  Illinois \nConstitution.  \n7.  However, I am concerned about the ongoing COVID-19 health crisis and I intend to \nabide  by  the  State’s  current  shelter  at  home  and  social  distancing  orders.  If  given  the \nopportunity to circulate petitions online I would do so.  \n8.  In 2018, I collected more than 1,000 initiative petition signatures for a local government \nreferendum in Chicago pursuant to Article VII, Section 11 of the Illinois Constitution. The \nChicago petition drive exceeded the minimum signature requirement in Section 28-7 of the \nIllinois Election Code for an Article VII referendum. \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 26-1 Filed: 04/27/20 Page 4 of 4 PageID #:201\n9.

R. CIV. P. 12(b)(1) AND 12(b)(6) MOTION TO DISMISS THE \nCOMPLAINT FILED BY DEFENDANT COOK COUNTY CLERK \n \nDefendant Karen A. Yarbrough, Cook County Clerk, in her official capacity, by and \nthrough her counsel, Kimberly M. Foxx, State’s Attorney of Cook County, through her assistant, \nJessica M. Scheller, hereby submits the following Memorandum of Law filed in support of her \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and (b)(6) Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ Verified Complaint for \nEmergency Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (“Complaint”): \nINTRODUCTION \n \nPlaintiffs’ claims against the County Clerk must and should fail, as the Plaintiffs’ filings \nconcede the County Clerk’s sole role in the Article VII referendum process is to place any Article \nVII initiative referendum questions on the ballot after certification.  (Dkt. 1, ¶ 12).  As Plaintiffs \nacknowledge  in  their  Complaint,  certification  is  completed  by  the  clerks  of  the  county \nmunicipalities.  Id. Plaintiffs do not allege that the County Clerk has failed or refused to place a \ncertified (or uncertified) Article VII initiative referendum on the ballot. Id. Their active grievances \nor claims relate exclusively to the certification process; (Dkt. 1, generally), a process in which the \nCounty Clerk has no part.  Id. Therefore the County Clerk asks this Court to find that she has \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 19 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 2 of 8 PageID #:113\nneither a role in the certification process or in this lawsuit.   \nBACKGROUND FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n \nPlaintiffs, a group of Illinois registered voters, seek to circulate an initiative petition for a \nconstitutional amendment to the Illinois Democracy Amendment pursuant to Article XIV, \nSection 3 of the Illinois Constitution. On April 7, 2020, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint [Docket \nNo. 1] against Cook County Clerk Karen A. Yarbrough (“County Clerk”), Secretary of State \nJesse White, Evanston City Clerk Devon Reid, as well as the individual Board Members of the \nIllinois State Board of Elections. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Governor’s \nshelter-in-place  orders,  Plaintiffs  seek  to  enjoin  or  modify  the  Illinois  petition  collection \nrequirements for initiative referendums to be placed on the November 3, 2020 general election \nballot. However, the County Clerk plays no role in the referendum process and Plaintiffs concede \nthat the County Clerk’s sole role in this process is merely to place any Article VII initiative \nreferendum questions certified by the clerks of suburban Cook County municipalities on the \nballot.  (Dkt. 1, ¶ 12). \nPlaintiffs seek an order, among other things, requiring Defendants to allow for petitions \nto be submitted electronically via an online form, that the May 3 deadline be extended to August \n3, 2020, and that the signature requirement be reduced by 50%. (Dkt. 1 at ¶ B, Prayer for Relief). \nPlaintiffs also seek costs and attorneys’ fees against Defendants.  (Id. at ¶E). \nNevertheless, Plaintiffs fail to state a claim against the County Clerk because the Clerk \nhas no role in the referendum process and cannot provide the relief Plaintiffs seek.  Accordingly, \nbecause no justiciable controversy exists as to the County Clerk, this Court lacks subject matter \njurisdiction and should dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) and also because \nit fails to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).  \n \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 19 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 3 of 8 PageID #:114\nARGUMENT \n \nI.  Legal Standard. \n \nDefendant brings this motion to dismiss under Federal Rule 12(b)(1) and (b)(6). “Rule \n12(b)(1) requires dismissal of claims over which the federal court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction. \nJurisdiction is the ‘power to decide’ and must be conferred upon the federal courts.” United States \nex rel. Sheet Metal Workers Int'l Ass'n, Local Union No. 20 v. Horning Invs., LLC, No. 12 CV 830, \n2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141449, *6 (S. Dist. Ind. October 1, 2013), citing In re Chicago, R.I. & \nP.R. Co., 794 F.2d 1182, 1188 (7th Cir. 1986). The burden is on the plaintiff to prove, by a \npreponderance of the evidence, that subject-matter jurisdiction exists for his or her claims. Lee v. \nCity of Chicago, 330 F.3d 456, 468 (7th Cir. 2003). \nThe purpose of a 12(b)(6) motion is to test the legal sufficiency of a pleading by accepting \nall the complaint's factual allegations as true. Szabo v. Bridgeport Machines, Inc., 249 F.3d 672, \n675 (7th Cir. 2001).  Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is proper where the petitioner can prove no set \nof facts that would entitle him to relief. Marshall-Mosby v. Corporate Receivables, Inc., 205 F.3d \n323, 326 (7th Cir. 2000). When considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, courts construe the \nallegations in plaintiff’s complaint “in the light most favorable to [the plaintiff], accepting all well-\npleaded facts as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of [the plaintiff].” Mann v. \nVogel, 707 F.3d 872, 877 (7th Cir. 2013), citing Citadel Group Ltd. v. Washington Regional \nMedical Ctr., 692 F.3d 580, 591 (7th Cir. 2012). \nFinally, dismissal is proper “if the complaint fails to set forth sufficient factual matter, \naccepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. \nCt. 1937, 1949 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic v. Twombley, 550 U. S. 544, 555 (2007)). “The \nplausibility standard is not akin to a ‘probability requirement,’ but it asks for more than a sheer \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 19 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 4 of 8 PageID #:115\npossibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.” Id. “[W]here the well-pleaded facts do not \npermit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged \n– but has not ‘show[n]’ – ‘that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Id. at 1950. Furthermore, although \ncomplaints need not allege factual details or legal arguments, “litigants may plead themselves out \nof court by alleging facts that defeat recovery” or by “alleging facts showing there is no viable \nclaim.” Doe v. Smith, 429 F.3d 706, 708 (7th Cir. 2005). \nII.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint Presents No Justiciable Controversy. \n \nPlaintiffs ask this Court to prematurely enjoin and modify the Illinois petition requirements \nfor initiative referendums, before the filing deadline for any such petitions. Further, Plaintiffs do \nnot allege that they were blocked from filing petitions electronically or from obtaining signatures \nelectronically. Thus, Plaintiffs’ demand for declaratory and injunctive relief is simply not ripe for \nadjudication and does not present a justiciable controversy. \nIt is the “obligat[ion] [of this Court] to consider [its] jurisdiction at any stage of the \nproceedings,” Wisconsin v. Ho–Chunk Nation, 512 F.3d 921, 935 (7th Cir. 2008) (quoting Enahoro \nv. Abubakar, 408 F.3d 877, 883 (7th Cir. 2005)), and “ripeness, when it implicates the possibility \nof this Court issuing an advisory opinion, is a question of subject matter jurisdiction under the \ncase-or-controversy requirement.” Wisconsin Cent., Ltd. v. Shannon, 539 F.3d 751, 759 (7th Cir. \n2008); see also Meridian Sec. Ins. Co. v. Sadowski, 441 F.3d 536, 538 (7th Cir. 2006).  \nRipeness is predicated on the “central perception ... that courts should not render decisions \nabsent a genuine need to resolve a real dispute,” Lehn v. Holmes, 364 F.3d 862, 867 (7th Cir. 2004) \n(quoting 13A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice & \nProcedure § 3532.1, at 114 (2d ed.1984)), and “[c]ases are unripe when the parties point only to \nhypothetical, speculative, or illusory disputes as opposed to actual, concrete conflicts.” Id. (quoting \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 19 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 5 of 8 PageID #:116\nHinrichs v. Whitburn, 975 F.2d 1329, 1333 (7th Cir.1992)). “Basically, the question in each case \nis  whether  the  facts  alleged,  under  all  the  circumstances,  show  that  there  is  a  substantial \ncontroversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to \nwarrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.” Wisconsin Cent., Ltd. v. Shannon, 539 F.3d 751, \n759 (7th Cir. 2008) (emphasis added) (quotations omitted); MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., \n127 S.Ct. 764, 771 (2007). \nFurther, injunctive and declaratory judgment remedies are discretionary. Nat'l Health \nFed'n v. Weinberger, 518 F.2d 711, 712 (7th Cir. 1975) (citing Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, \n387 U.S. 136, 148, 87 S. Ct. 1507, 18 L. Ed. 2d 681 (1967)). Premature adjudication caused by \nmeddling in abstract disagreements or interfering in agency decision-making should be avoided, \nas it wastes judicial resources. Abbott, 387 U.S. at 148-49. Courts grant such remedies only when \nthe controversy is ripe for judicial resolution. Alcan Aluminium Ltd. v. Dep't of Revenue of State \nof Or., 724 F.2d 1294, 1299 (7th Cir. 1984) (citing Abbott, 387 U.S. at 148). \nHere, there is no actual conflict or dispute between the parties, including the County Clerk, \nas Plaintiffs’ rights have not been constrained in any way. Further, Plaintiffs’ First Amendment, \nEqual Protection, and Due Process rights have not been violated because there is no allegation that \nDefendants, including the County Clerk, have enforced the Illinois petition requirements against \nPlaintiffs. As it stands, Plaintiffs allege that if the petition requirements as they exist now were to \nbe enforced as written, they would allegedly burden and violate Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. \nClearly, this claim is not currently ripe for adjudication.  \nFurther, there is no federal constitutional mandate on a state to permit referendums on its \nballot. See Protect Marriage Illinois, et al. v. Orr, et al., 463 F.3d 604, 606 (7th Cir. 2006). In \nProtect Marriage, Plaintiffs claimed the requirements for getting an advisory question on the \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 19 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 6 of 8 PageID #:117\nIllinois ballot were so onerous that they violated freedom of speech, equal protection, and due \nprocess. While Protect Marriage dealt with advisory questions and not referendums, the Seventh \nCircuit’s findings are instructive in this case. Specifically, the Court held that the ballot is not a \ntraditional public forum for the expression of ideas and opinions to which reasonable access must \nbe given to people who want to engage in political and other protected expression. Id. And the \nCourt recognized that a state has the right to impose requirements and limit the content on the \nballot. Id. As in Protect Marriage, Plaintiffs in the instant case have no federal constitutional right \nto a referendum and Illinois has the right to regulate and limit referendums. Thus, Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint is ripe for dismissal. \nIII.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint Fails to State a Cause of Action Against the County Clerk.   \nThe  Complaint  against  the  County  Clerk  should  be  dismissed  because  there  is  no \nmisconduct or wrongdoing alleged against the County Clerk and the Clerk does not have the \nauthority to effectuate any of the relief sought by Plaintiffs. In fact, Plaintiffs concede that the \nCounty Clerk does not certify referendums but rather, only place referendums on the ballot that \nhave been certified by the clerks of suburban municipalities. (Dkt. 1, ¶12). Clearly, by Plaintiffs’ \nown admission, the County Clerk has no role in this referendum process. The County Clerk is not \nauthorized to accept filings of petitions for constitutional amendments. See Article XIV, Section 3 \nof 1970 Illinois Constitution. It is not authorized to accept filings of initiative referendums or to \ncertify such referendums. See Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS 5/1 – 1 – 1; Illinois Election Code, \n10 LCS 5/28 – 1 et seq. Nor is it empowered to enforce and administer Illinois election laws with \nrespect to the filing of referendums. Plaintiffs have failed to allege any wrongdoing or misconduct \nby the County Clerk. In addition, the County Clerk cannot offer any of the relief contained in \nPlaintiffs’ Prayer for Relief. The County Clerk does not enforce Illinois petition collection \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 19 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 7 of 8 PageID #:118\nrequirements therefore it cannot be enjoined from enforcing such requirements. If this Court were \nto order that petitions may be submitted electronically, those petitions would not be submitted to \nthe County Clerk. Finally, the County Clerk does not have the power or authority to move the \ndeadline by which petitions must be filed or to reduce the number of signatures required. Since \nclearly no misconduct or wrongdoing is alleged against the County Clerk and the Clerk does not \nhave the authority to effectuate any of the relief sought by Plaintiffs, the Complaint against the \nCounty Clerk should be dismissed.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ claims are not ripe and no justiciable controversy \nexists. Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, to the extent they exist, have not been constrained in any \nway as the Illinois petition requirements have not yet been enforced. Additionally, Cook County \nClerk Karen Yarbrough was named in the Complaint but clearly committed no wrongdoing, is not \ninvolved in the petition process, and cannot effectuate the relief Plaintiffs seek. As such, Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint should be dismissed in its entirety. \nWHEREFORE Respondent Karen A. Yarbrough, Cook County Clerk, in her official \ncapacity, respectfully requests that this Court dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint against her, with \nprejudice, pursuant to FED R. CIV. P. 12 (b)(1) and (b)(6). \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n            KIMBERLY M. FOXX \n            State’s Attorney of Cook County   \n \n/s/ Jessica M. Scheller \n  Jessica M.

Scheller, Silvia M. Masters, Attorneys, Office of the Cook County State's Attorney, \nChicago, IL, for Defendant-Appellee Karen A. Yarbrough. \nBefore EASTERBROOK, KANNE, and HAMILTON, Circuit Judges. \n650*650 PER CURIAM. \nIllinois permits voters to place initiatives and referenda on both local and statewide ballots, but it also \nrequires proponents to collect enough signatures to show that each proposal is likely to have a \ndecent amount of support. The state allows 18 months for proponents to collect signatures. This \nyear that period ended for the State of Illinois on May 3, 2020, and will end for the City of Evanston \non August 3. \nSeven plaintiffs filed this suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 contending that the state's requirements are \ntoo onerous, and hence unconstitutional, given the social-distancing requirements adopted by the \nGovernor of Illinois in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A district judge expressed skepticism that \nany of the plaintiffs has standing but found it unnecessary to resolve that question because she \ndenied relief on other grounds. 2020 WL 2526484, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86618 (N.D. Ill. May 18, \n2020). Plaintiffs have appealed. We expedited the briefing, and all litigants have agreed to waive oral \nargument to facilitate a faster decision. \n\nThe district court's approach, sometimes called hypothetical standing, was disapproved by the \nSupreme Court in Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 \nL.Ed.2d 210 (1998). But because at least one plaintiff, William Morgan, has standing, the district \ncourt had jurisdiction. Morgan began his petition campaign (he seeks to amend the state's \nconstitution) before filing suit. Relief such as reducing the number of signatures required, permitting \nelectronic rather than physical signatures, and extending deadlines would materially improve his \nchances. Other plaintiffs also want to amend the state's constitution, and one proposes a change \nthat would affect Evanston alone. Federal judges routinely adjudicate suits filed by persons who \nhave encountered difficulty obtaining the signatures required to put candidates' names or \nsubstantive proposals on the ballot. \nThis is as far as plaintiffs get, however. District judges have discretion when weighing the \nconsiderations relevant to requests for preliminary relief. See, e.g., Winter v. Natural Resources \nDefense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 129 S.Ct. 365, 172 L.Ed.2d 249 (2008). One important question, \nwhen a plaintiff seeks emergency relief, is whether the plaintiff has brought the emergency on \nhimself. The district judge concluded that Morgan had done so. During most of the time available to \nseek signatures, Morgan did absolutely nothing. He did not evince any interest in the subject until \nearly April 2020, several weeks after the Governor began to issue orders requiring social distancing. \nThe other 652*652 plaintiffs did not do anything of substance until the suit was on file. Plaintiffs had \nplenty of time to gather signatures before the pandemic began. That's a good reason to conclude \nthat they are not entitled to emergency relief. \nWe add that plaintiffs also have not established that the Governor's orders limit their speech. The \norders concern conduct (social distancing), not what anyone may write or say. Orders regulating \nconduct often have incidental effects on speech, but this does not require courts to treat them as if \nthey were regulations of speech. See, e.g., Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. \n288, 104 S.Ct. 3065, 82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984). Plaintiffs do not question the propriety of those orders. \nCf. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 25 S.Ct. 358, 49 L.Ed. 643 (1905); Elim Romanian \nPentecostal Church v. Pritzker, 962 F.3d341 (7th Cir. 2020). Although the orders surely make it hard \nto round up signatures, so would the reluctance of many people to approach strangers during a \npandemic. \nOne more consideration bears emphasis. The federal Constitution does not require any state or local \ngovernment to put referenda or initiatives on the ballot. That is wholly a matter of state law. See, \ne.g., Jones v. Markiewicz-Qualkinbush, 892 F.3d 935 (7th Cir. 2018). If we understand the \nGovernor's orders, coupled with the signature requirements, as equivalent to a decision to skip all \nreferenda for the 2020 election cycle, there is no federal problem. Illinois may decide for itself \nwhether a pandemic is a good time to be soliciting signatures on the streets in order to add \nreferenda to a ballot. \nThe order denying the motion for a preliminary injunction is affirmed. The plaintiffs remain free to \ncontend to the district court that a permanent injunction would be justified if social-distancing rules \nare indefinitely extended, but that long-term question does not require immediate resolution. \n ",

Dkt. 1, 4, \n6.  Plaintiffs sued a variety of entities, including the Evanston City Clerk in his official capacity.  \nDkt.  1.  Glaringly  absent  from  the  Plaintiffs’  Complaint  are  any  other  similarly  situated \nmunicipalities in the State of Illinois named as defendants.  Notwithstanding Plaintiffs’ failure to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted against Reid1, Plaintiffs ask this Court to enjoin \nReid and the other Defendants, by requiring them to implement measures to facilitate the means \nto gather signatures for petitions.  Dkt. 6.  Plaintiffs’ Motion should be denied for the following \nreasons: \n  First, Plaintiffs’ lack standing to bring a claim against Reid.  Plaintiffs’ desired outcome—\nthat Reid accept petitions electronically—is not ripe before this court.  Plaintiffs do not allege, nor \ncan they, that Reid would not and has not accepted verified petitions in accordance with Illinois \nState law.  Assuming Plaintiffs are successful in forcing a change in the law such that they can \nobtain and submit electronic signatures, it follows Reid would be obligated to accept them.  The \nidea that Reid might not accept them is too speculative to create a concrete dispute before the \ncourt, and Plaintiffs can cite no past practice whereby Reid has failed to accept petitions. \nAdditionally, an injunction against Reid would be improper because Plaintiffs cannot \nshow irreparable harm.  There are no allegations and no evidence Reid, by following current state \nelection law, is denying Plaintiffs from filing petitions.   Plaintiffs primary complaint appears to \nbe the inability to collect signatures; Reid has no authority or role under state law with respect to \n                                                 \n1   Reid separately filed a Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  This \nresponse was filed in the event that motion is denied. \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 14 Filed: 04/15/20 Page 3 of 11 PageID #:70\nthe collection of signatures.  Furthermore, the Illinois Constitutional provisions cited by Plaintiffs \nallows but not mandates petitions as a method to amend the State Constitution or otherwise pass \nlaw.  Plaintiffs will not suffer irreparable harm as there remains other means to achieve their goal.  \nPlaintiffs may submit by resolution their proposal for action to Evanston City Council pursuant to \nthe Illinois Constitution.  In the face of the current pandemic, Evanston continues to hold online \nCity Council meetings, whereby the public has remote access. \n  Secondly, Plaintiffs will not likely succeed on the merits against Reid.  According to \nPlaintiffs’ Motion, it is the action of the State, not Reid, infringing their Constitutional rights.  But \nfor the current pandemic, Plaintiffs cannot show state law is facially unconstitutional.  Moreover, \nthe law Plaintiffs’ attempt to challenge regulates the mechanics of the process rather than the \ncontent; accordingly, the City’s interest in securing the health of citizens—including Plaintiffs—\nis compelling enough to limit the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs.  Finally, Plaintiffs cannot \nshow it is clearly established that Reid’s refusal to accept petitions would violate Plaintiffs \nconstitutional rights. \nSTANDARD FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nIn Roland Machinery Co. v. Dresser Industries, Inc., the Seventh Circuit spelled out an \n“analytical procedure for deciding whether to grant or deny a motion for preliminary injunction” \nfor this jurisdiction.  749 F.2d 380, 389 (7th Cir. 1984).  The procedure outlined by the court \n“constitutes a true legal standard…[that] does not call for a discretionary—in the sense of \nstandardless or intuitive—judgment, or for a consideration of numerous factors none enjoying \nany particular weight, or for an evaluation of factors inaccessible to a reviewing court.”  Id.  \n“The factors to be considered are few and definite.”  Id.  “[T]hey are to be compared in a \nparticular sequence and in accordance with a specific formula which requires first deciding \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 14 Filed: 04/15/20 Page 4 of 11 PageID #:71\nwhether the plaintiff has crossed the specified thresholds and then weighting the parities’ likely \nharms from the grant and denial of the preliminary injunction, respectively, by the strength of the \nplaintiff’s case.”  Id.  “The granting of a preliminary injunction is an exercise of a very far-\nreaching power, never to be indulged in except in a case clearly demanding it.”  Id. (internal \ncitations omitted). \n  To cross “the specified thresholds” of injunctive relief a plaintiff “must show that he has \nno  adequate  remedy  at  law,  and…that  he  will  suffer  irreparable  harm  if  the  preliminary \ninjunction is not granted.”  Id. at 386 (internal citation and quotes omitted).  “Only if [plaintiff] \nwill suffer irreparable harm in the interim—that is, harm that cannot be prevented or fully \nrectified by the final judgment after trial—can he get a preliminary injunction.”  Id. \nOnce the court determines a plaintiff has met this threshold, the court must then consider \n“an irreparable harm that the defendant might suffer from the injunction—harm that would not \nbe either  cured by the  defendant’s ultimately prevailing  in  the trial on the merits or fully \ncompensated by the injunction bond that Rule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures \nrequires the district court to make the plaintiff post.”  Id. at 387.  Additionally, the plaintiff must \ncross another threshold: “that of showing some likelihood of succeeding on the merits.”  Id.  The \nplaintiff’s chances must be better than negligible.  Id.  The greater the chance a plaintiff has at \nsucceeding on the merits, “the less heavily need the balance of harms weigh in his favor; the less \nlikely he is to win, the more need it weight in his favor.”  Id.  Finally, the court should consider \nwhether  granting  or  denying  a  preliminary  injunction  will  have  consequences  beyond  the \nimmediate parties.  Id. at 388.  This is the proper standard the court should use in evaluating the \nvalidity of Plaintiffs’ Motion. \n   \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 14 Filed: 04/15/20 Page 5 of 11 PageID #:72\nARGUMENT \nI.  PLAINTIFFS’ ARGUMENT IS NOT RIPE FOR ADJUDICATION. \n \nPlaintiffs’  claims  against  Reid  “are  too  speculative  to  create  a  concrete  dispute.”  \nConstruction and General Laborer’s Union No. 330 v. Town of Grand Chute, 915 F.3d 1120, \n1127 (7th Cir. 2019).  Plaintiffs assert Illinois statutory and constitutional requirements stifle their \nFirst Amendment right to petition by requiring physical signatures and an affidavit.  Dkt. 1; Dkt. \n6.  It can be inferred (although not explicitly stated) Plaintiffs anticipate Reid will not accept \npetitions that are not generated according to state constitutional and statutory law.  Yet Plaintiff \nalleges no facts  and can put  forth  no evidence  showing Reid  will reject  Plaintiffs’ verified \npetitions. \nIn General Laborer’s Union, the municipality passed an ordinance banning signs located \nin the public right of way.  Id. at 1126.  The Union sued, alleging the ordinance would restrict \ntheir First Amendment rights in the event the protested in the future and wanted to use an \ninflatable rat.  Id.  The court held their claim regarding the possible protests was too speculative.  \nId. at 1127.  There were too many unanswered questions on how the protest would unfold to \nallow the court to act.  Id. \nHere,  as  in  General  Laborer’s  Union,  Plaintiffs’  allegations  about  petitions  are  too \nspeculative.  Reid may not accept Plaintiffs’ petitions for a myriad of reasons beyond the fact they \nwere submitted electronically.  Perhaps the petitions contained fraudulent signatures or signatures \nof someone who is not a resident of Evanston.  Not only have no petitions been submitted and \nsubsequently rejected, there is no way of determining for what reason, if at all, Reid would reject \nPlaintiffs’ petitions.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs claims are not  ripe, and their motion should be \ndenied.   \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 14 Filed: 04/15/20 Page 6 of 11 PageID #:73\n \nII.  PLAINTIFFS  CANNOT  SHOW  IRREPARABLE  HARM  IF  THE  STATUS \nQUO REMAINS. \n \nThere is no evidence Plaintiffs have (or can) put forth showing Reid is preventing Plaintiffs from \ncollecting petitions signed by a number of qualified electors pursuant to the Illinois Election Code.  The \nonly role Reid as City Clerk of the City of Evanston plays in the process pursuant to Illinois Election \nlaw, the Illinois Municipal Code and the Evanston City Code is to allow the petitions to be filed.  See 10 \nILCS 5/28-7; 65 ILCS 5/3.1-35-90; and Evanston City Code § 1-7-2.  Plaintiffs do not argue—nor can \nthey demonstrate—the City Clerk’s office will not accept petitions signed by a number of qualified \nelectors.  While City facilities remained closed to the public through April 30th2, the deadline for \nsubmission to the Evanston City Clerk is more than three months away, August 3, 2020.  Dkt 1, ¶ 35.  \nNevertheless, there is no evidence Plaintiff can put forth showing Reid would not or cannot accept \nverified petitions, even in person.  Residents are free to call the Clerk’s Office to conduct official \nbusiness and arrange for petitions to be dropped off3.   \n“In every case in which the plaintiff ants a preliminary injunction he must show that he has ‘no \nadequate remedy at law,’ and that he will suffer ‘irreparable harm’ if the preliminary injunction is not \ngranted.”  Id. at 386.  “Only if he will suffer irreparable harm in the interim—that is, harm that cannot be \nprevented or fully rectified by the final judgment after trial—and he get a preliminary injunction.”  Id.   \nIn this case, Plaintiffs cannot show harm cannot be prevented or fully rectified by a final \njudgment after trial against Reid.  Indeed, Reid is not the proper party to enjoin.  Illinois Election Code \nstates in relevant part: \n                                                 \n2   The City was served notice of this action at the City Clerk’s office, as the Clerk’s office \nremains staffed. \n \n3   https://www.cityofevanston.org/Home/Components/News/News/3744/17 \n \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 14 Filed: 04/15/20 Page 7 of 11 PageID #:74\nAny  such  public  question  may  be  initiated  by  the  governing  body  of  the  unit  of  local \ngovernment by resolution or by the filing with the clerk or secretary of the governmental unit of \na petition signed by a number of qualified electors equal to or greater than at least 8% of the total \nvotes cast for candidates for Governor in the preceding gubernatorial election, requesting the \nsubmission of the proposal for such action to the voters of the governmental unit at a regular \nelection.  \n \nIf the action to be taken requires a referendum involving 2 or more units of local government, \nthe proposal shall be submitted to the voters of such governmental units by the election \nauthorities  with  jurisdiction  over  the  territory  of  the  governmental  units.  Such  multi-unit \nproposals may be initiated by appropriate resolutions by the respective governing bodies or by \npetitions of the voters of the several governmental units filed with the respective clerks or \nsecretaries. \n \n10 ILCS 5/28-7 (emphasis added).   \n  Moreover, the portion of the Illinois Constitution upon which Plaintiffs rely does not mandate \npetitions as the only means to initiate action.  Section 11 of Article VII states: “Proposals for actions \nwhich are authorized by this Article or by law and which require approval by referendum may be \ninitiated and submitted to the electors by resolution of the governing board of a unit of local government \nor by petition of electors in the manner provided by law.”  Ill Const. Art. VII § 11 (emphasis added).  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs inability to gather signatures, while stifled by a global pandemic, does not \nforeclose them from initiating change.  The harm suffered by Plaintiffs is a lack of choice authorized by \nthe Illinois Constitution, not an irreparable one violative of their Constitutional rights.  Plaintiffs’ Motion \nshould be denied. \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS  ARE  UNLIKELY  TO  SUCCEED  ON  THE  MERITS  AGAINST \nREID \n \nAssuming arguendo Plaintiffs can demonstrate they have no adequate remedy at law and will \nsuffer irreparable harm, the court must also consider “any irreparable harm that the defendant might \nsuffer from the injunction—harm that would not be either cured by the defendant’s ultimately prevailing \nin the trial on the merits or fully compensated by the injunction bond that Rule 65(c) of the Federal \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 14 Filed: 04/15/20 Page 8 of 11 PageID #:75\nRules of Civil Procedure requires the district court to make the plaintiff post.”  Roland Machinery Co., \n749 F.3d at 387.  In this case, Reid is likely to succeed on the merits at trial. \na.  Plaintiffs Cannot Produce Evidence of Reid Limiting Plaintiffs’ Rights. \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint makes plain, and Plaintiffs’ Motion argues the action allegedly infringing \ntheir rights is the Executive Order of the state’s governor.  Dkt. 1, ¶¶ 31-32.  Interestingly, Plaintiffs cite \n“the health crisis” as a factor making it impossible to collect signatures.  Id.  The City of Evanston’s \nClerk has not created, or contributed, to either the health crisis or the subsequent state actions. There are \nno facts alleged in either Plaintiffs’ Complaint or Motion showing any action by Reid limiting Plaintiffs’ \nConstitutional Rights.  Nevertheless, even if Reid’s actions or policies served to restrict Plaintiffs’ ability \nto exercise their rights, Plaintiffs would be hard pressed to overcome even strict scrutiny during a global \npandemic. \n“When a State’s election law directly regulates core political speech, we have always subjected \nthe challenged restriction to strict scrutiny and required that the legislation be narrowly tailored to serve \na compelling governmental interest.”  Buckley v. American Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc., 525 \nU.S. 182, 207 (1999) (THOMAS, J. concurring) (citing Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191, 198 (1992)).  \nHowever, “lessor burdens trigger less exacting review, and a State’s important regulatory interests are \ntypically enough to justify reasonable restrictions.”  Id. at 206 (citing Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New \nParty, 520 U.S. 351, 358-59 (1997)).  The difference lies on whether the challenged regulation controls \nthe mechanics of the electoral process or is regulation of pure speech.  McIntyre v. Ohio Elections \nCommission, 514 U.S. 334, 345 (1995).   \nSetting aside the fact the City Clerk is not the state actor enacting the challenged legislation and \nis only responsible for following it, the regulation at issue does not regulate pure speech.  In McIntyre, \nthe State of Ohio regulated handbills and their distribution.  Id. at 340.  The Supreme Court overturned \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 14 Filed: 04/15/20 Page 9 of 11 PageID #:76\nthe Ohio Supreme Court’s decision, holding the Ohio Supreme Court used the wrong test in determining \nwhether  Ohio’s  law  was  constitutional.    Id.  at  347.    The  Supreme  Court  distinguished  between \nregulations of the mechanics of the electoral process and regulation of pure speech holding the Ohio law \nwas a regulation of speech.  Id. at 345. \nIn this case, the two regulations cited by Plaintiffs are the Illinois Election Code requiring \npetitions—if used—to be filed with the City Clerk, 10 ILCS 5/28-7, and the Governor’s Executive \nOrder.  Dkt. 1, pg. 8.  Evanston’s City Clerk is not responsible for either regulation.  Nonetheless, \nsection 28-7 clearly regulates the mechanics of the electoral process rather than pure speech.  McIntyre, \n514 U.S. at 345.  Accordingly, the only question properly before this Court should be to determine if \nReid’s actions (if any) justify Plaintiffs’ inability to collect signatures.  Any restrictions by the City Clerk \nto protect the health and welfare of city residents and staff in the face of a global pandemic are \nreasonably justified.  Buckley, 525 U.S. at 207 (THOMAS, J concurring). \nb.  Plaintiffs Have an Alternative Method to Initiate Proposals for Action. \nFurthermore, as argued supra, the Illinois Constitution allows for Plaintiffs to petition the \nEvanston City Council directly.  (“Proposals for actions which are authorized by this Article or by law \nand which require approval by referendum may be initiated and submitted to the lectors by resolution of \nthe governing board of a unit of local government…”) Ill. Const. Art. VII § 11(a).  Petitions are a means \nto achieve this goal but not mandated.  Id.  Thus, any restriction(s) by the City Clerk is/are justified in \nthe face of a global pandemic threatening the health and welfare of city residents. \nEven if this court determines a higher level of scrutiny was required, Plaintiffs cannot succeed.  \nThere can be no doubt the City’s interests in maintaining the health and welfare of employees and \nresidents and preventing the spread of a potentially life-threatening virus is a compelling interest.  \nAlthough Plaintiffs do not cite any action taken by the City or Reid—at all—any burden on Plaintiffs’ \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 14 Filed: 04/15/20 Page 10 of 11 PageID #:77\nspeech by the City’s action is minimal in comparison of the importance of the lives of Evanston’s \nemployees and residents.  There is simply no evidence Plaintiffs can put forward showing the City will \nnot accept valid petitions in the wake of COVID-19, the Governor’s Executive Order, or any supposed \naction Reid took to stifle Plaintiffs’ Constitutional rights.  Consequently, they are unlikely to succeed at \ntrial and their motion must be denied. \nc.  Reid is Entitled to Qualified Immunity. \n“[G]overnment officials performing discretionary functions, generally are shielded from liability \nfor civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional \nrights of which a reasonable person would have known.”  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 \n(1982).  “[A]n allegation of malice is not sufficient to defeat immunity if the defendant acted in an \nobjectively reasonable manner.”  Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986).  “For a constitutional right \nto be  clearly  established, its  contours must be sufficiently  clear that  a  reasonable official would \nunderstand that what he is doing violates that right; in other words, in the light of preexisting law the \nunlawfulness must be apparent.”  Shipman v. Hamilton, 520 F.3d 775, 778 (7th Cir. 2008)(internal \ncitation and quotations omitted).  In this case, Reid “could not reasonably be expected to anticipate \nsubsequent legal developments, nor could [they] fairly be said to ‘know’ that the law forbade conduct \nnot previously identified as lawful.”  Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818. \nBut for the global pandemic, the regulations Plaintiffs seek to challenge are facially valid.  \nPlaintiffs can provide no preexisting law making sufficiently clear that Reid’s refusal to accept petitions \nin compliance with state law would violate Plaintiffs’ Constitutional rights.

Yarbrough, Cook County Clerk, in her official capacity, by and \nthrough  her  counsel,  Kimberly  M.  Foxx,  State’s  Attorney  of  Cook  County,  through  her \nassistant, Silvia Mercado Masters, hereby submits the following Memorandum of Law filed in \nsupport of her Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and (b)(6) Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ Amended \nVerified  Complaint  for  Emergency  Declaratory  and  Injunctive  Relief  (“Amended \nComplaint”): \nINTRODUCTION \n \n“Civilization begins with order, grows with liberty, and dies with chaos.”1  Plaintiffs seek \nto secure and maintain liberties guaranteed by the First Amendment and Due Process and Equal \nProtection  Clauses.  They  do  so,  however,  by  ignoring  order  as  established  by  Article  III; \nintroducing chaos into the process with their claims against County Clerk – a party against whom \nthey allege no justiciable controversy. (Dkt. 26, generally). Plaintiffs’ claims against the County \n                                                           \n1 Will Durant \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 43 Filed: 05/11/20 Page 2 of 10 PageID #:406\nClerk must and should fail, as the Plaintiffs’ filings concede the County Clerk’s sole role in the \nArticle VII referendum process is to place any Article VII initiative referendum questions on the \nballot after certification. (Dkt. 26, ¶ 12). As Plaintiffs acknowledge in their Amended Complaint, \ncertification is completed by the clerks of the county municipalities. Id. Plaintiffs do not allege \nthat the County Clerk has failed or refused to place a certified (or uncertified) Article VII \ninitiative referendum on the ballot. Id. Their active grievances or claims relate exclusively to the \ncertification process; (Dkt. 26, generally), a process in which the County Clerk has no part.  Id. \nTherefore the County Clerk asks this Court to find that she has neither a role in the certification \nprocess or in this lawsuit.   \nBACKGROUND FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n \nPlaintiffs, a group of Illinois registered voters, seek to circulate an initiative petition for \na constitutional amendment to the Illinois Democracy Amendment pursuant to Article XIV, \nSection 3 of the Illinois Constitution. On April 7, 2020, Plaintiffs filed their initial Complaint \n[Docket No. 1] against Cook County Clerk Karen A. Yarbrough (“County Clerk”), Secretary of \nState Jesse White, Evanston City Clerk Devon Reid, as well as the individual Board Members \nof  the  Illinois State Board of Elections.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the \nGovernor’s shelter-in-place orders, Plaintiffs seek to enjoin or modify the Illinois petition \ncollection  requirements  for  initiative  referendums  to  be  placed  on  the  November  3,  2020 \ngeneral election ballot. Plaintiffs’ emergency motion for preliminary injunction (Dkt. 6) was \nheard by Judge Pallmeyer and denied on April 17, 2020. Plaintiffs’ emergency motion to \nreconsider the ruling was denied by Judge Pallmeyer on May 7, 2020. Plaintiffs filed their \nAmended Complaint on April 27, 2020. Notwithstanding, the County Clerk plays no role in the \nreferendum process and Plaintiffs concede that the County Clerk’s sole role in this process is \nmerely  to place any  Article VII initiative referendum questions certified by the clerks of \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 43 Filed: 05/11/20 Page 3 of 10 PageID #:407\nsuburban Cook County municipalities on the ballot.  (Dkt. 26, ¶ 12). \nPlaintiffs seek an order, among other things, requiring Defendants to allow for petitions \nto be collected and submitted electronically without the circulator’s statement and notarization \nrequirement, that the May 3 deadline be extended to August 3, 2020, and that the signature \nrequirement be reduced by 50%. (Dkt. 26 at ¶ B, Prayer for Relief). Plaintiffs also seek costs \nand attorneys’ fees against Defendants.  (Id. at ¶E). \nNevertheless, Plaintiffs fail to state a claim against the County Clerk because the Clerk \nhas  no  role  in  the  referendum  process  and  cannot  provide  the  relief  Plaintiffs  seek.  \nAccordingly, because no justiciable controversy exists as to the County Clerk, this Court lacks \nsubject matter jurisdiction and should dismiss Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint pursuant to Rule \n12(b)(1) and also because it fails to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).  \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  Legal Standard. \n \nDefendant brings this motion to dismiss under Federal Rule 12(b)(1) and (b)(6). “Rule \n12(b)(1)  requires  dismissal  of  claims  over  which  the  federal  court  lacks  subject-matter \njurisdiction. Jurisdiction is the ‘power to decide’ and must be conferred upon the federal courts.” \nUnited States ex rel. Sheet Metal Workers Int'l Ass'n, Local Union No. 20 v. Horning Invs., LLC, \nNo. 12 CV 830, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141449, *6 (S. Dist. Ind. October 1, 2013), citing In re \nChicago, R.I. & P.R. Co., 794 F.2d 1182, 1188 (7th Cir. 1986). The burden is on the plaintiff to \nprove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that subject-matter jurisdiction exists for his or her \nclaims. Lee v. City of Chicago, 330 F.3d 456, 468 (7th Cir. 2003). \nThe  purpose  of  a 12(b)(6) motion  is  to  test  the legal  sufficiency of  a  pleading  by \naccepting  all  the  complaint's  factual  allegations  as  true. Szabo  v.  Bridgeport  Machines, \nInc., 249 F.3d 672, 675 (7th Cir. 2001).  Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is proper where the \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 43 Filed: 05/11/20 Page 4 of 10 PageID #:408\npetitioner can prove no set of facts that would entitle him to relief. Marshall-Mosby v. Corporate \nReceivables, Inc., 205 F.3d 323, 326 (7th Cir. 2000). When considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion \nto dismiss, courts construe the allegations in plaintiff’s complaint “in the light most favorable to \n[the plaintiff], accepting all well-pleaded facts as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in \nfavor of [the plaintiff].” Mann v. Vogel, 707 F.3d 872, 877 (7th Cir. 2013), citing Citadel Group \nLtd. v. Washington Regional Medical Ctr., 692 F.3d 580, 591 (7th Cir. 2012). \nFinally, dismissal is proper “if the complaint fails to set forth sufficient factual matter, \naccepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 \nS. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic v. Twombley, 550 U. S. 544, 555 (2007)). “The \nplausibility standard is not akin to a ‘probability requirement,’ but it asks for more than a sheer \npossibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.” Id. “[W]here the well-pleaded facts do not \npermit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has \nalleged  –  but  has  not  ‘show[n]’  –  ‘that  the  pleader  is  entitled  to  relief.”  Id.  at  1950. \nFurthermore, although complaints need not allege factual details or legal arguments, “litigants \nmay plead themselves out of court by alleging facts that defeat recovery” or by “alleging facts \nshowing there is no viable claim.” Doe v. Smith, 429 F.3d 706, 708 (7th Cir. 2005). \nII.  Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint Presents No Justiciable Controversy. \n \nPlaintiffs  ask  this  Court  to  prematurely  enjoin  and  modify  the  Illinois  petition \nrequirements for initiative referendums, well before the filing deadline for Evanston petitions \nand where Plaintiffs had not begun to circulate petitions prior to the Governor’s stay-at-home \norder. Further, Plaintiffs do not allege that they were blocked from filing petitions electronically \nor  from  obtaining  signatures  electronically.  Thus,  Plaintiffs’  demand  for  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief is simply not ripe for adjudication and does not present a justiciable controversy. \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 43 Filed: 05/11/20 Page 5 of 10 PageID #:409\nIt is the “obligat[ion] [of this Court] to consider [its] jurisdiction at any stage of the \nproceedings,”  Wisconsin v. Ho–Chunk Nation, 512 F.3d 921, 935 (7th Cir. 2008) (quoting \nEnahoro v. Abubakar, 408 F.3d 877, 883 (7th Cir. 2005)), and “ripeness, when it implicates the \npossibility of this Court issuing an advisory opinion, is a question of subject matter jurisdiction \nunder the case-or-controversy requirement.” Wisconsin Cent., Ltd. v. Shannon, 539 F.3d 751, \n759 (7th Cir. 2008); see also Meridian Sec. Ins. Co. v. Sadowski, 441 F.3d 536, 538 (7th Cir. \n2006).  \nRipeness  is  predicated  on  the  “central  perception  ...  that  courts  should  not  render \ndecisions absent a genuine need to resolve a real dispute,” Lehn v. Holmes, 364 F.3d 862, 867 \n(7th Cir. 2004) (quoting 13A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & Edward H. Cooper, \nFederal Practice & Procedure § 3532.1, at 114 (2d ed.1984)), and “[c]ases are unripe when the \nparties point only to hypothetical, speculative, or illusory disputes as opposed to actual, concrete \nconflicts.” Id. (quoting Hinrichs v. Whitburn, 975 F.2d 1329, 1333 (7th Cir.1992)). “Basically, \nthe question in each case is whether the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that \nthere is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient \nimmediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.” Wisconsin Cent., Ltd. \nv.  Shannon,  539  F.3d  751,  759  (7th  Cir.  2008)  (emphasis  added)  (quotations  omitted); \nMedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 127 S.Ct. 764, 771 (2007). \nFurther, injunctive and declaratory judgment remedies are discretionary. Nat'l Health \nFed'n v. Weinberger, 518 F.2d 711, 712 (7th Cir. 1975) (citing Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, \n387 U.S. 136, 148, 87 S. Ct. 1507, 18 L. Ed. 2d 681 (1967)). Premature adjudication caused by \nmeddling in abstract disagreements or interfering in agency decision-making should be avoided, \nas it wastes judicial resources. Abbott, 387 U.S. at 148-49. Courts grant such remedies only when \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 43 Filed: 05/11/20 Page 6 of 10 PageID #:410\nthe controversy is ripe for judicial resolution. Alcan Aluminium Ltd. v. Dep't of Revenue of State \nof Or., 724 F.2d 1294, 1299 (7th Cir. 1984) (citing Abbott, 387 U.S. at 148). \nHere, there is no actual conflict or dispute between the parties, including the County \nClerk,  as  Plaintiffs’  rights  have  not  been  constrained  in  any  way.  Further,  Plaintiffs’  First \nAmendment, Equal Protection, and Due Process rights have not been violated because there is no \nallegation  that  Defendants,  including  the  County  Clerk,  have  enforced  the  Illinois  petition \nrequirements against Plaintiffs. As it stands, Plaintiffs allege that if the petition requirements as \nthey exist now were to be enforced as written, they would allegedly burden and violate Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional rights. Clearly, this claim is not currently ripe for adjudication.  \nFurther, there is no federal constitutional mandate on a state to permit referendums on its \nballot. See Protect Marriage Illinois, et al. v. Orr, et al., 463 F.3d 604, 606 (7th Cir. 2006). In \nProtect Marriage, Plaintiffs claimed the requirements for getting an advisory question on the \nIllinois ballot were so onerous that they violated freedom of speech, equal protection, and due \nprocess. While Protect Marriage dealt with advisory questions and not referendums, the Seventh \nCircuit’s findings are instructive in this case. Specifically, the Court held that the ballot is not a \ntraditional public forum for the expression of ideas and opinions to which reasonable access must \nbe given to people who want to engage in political and other protected expression. Id. And the \nCourt recognized that a state has the right to impose requirements and limit the content on the \nballot. Id. As in Protect Marriage, Plaintiffs in the instant case have no federal constitutional \nright  to  a  referendum  and  Illinois  has  the  right  to  regulate  and  limit  referendums.  Thus, \nPlaintiffs’ Amended Complaint is ripe for dismissal. \nNor  are  Plaintiffs’  claims  saved  by  the  addition  of  an  Illinois  Constitution  claim. \nPlaintiffs claim their right to ballot access is protected by the Illinois Constitution likening the \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 43 Filed: 05/11/20 Page 7 of 10 PageID #:411\ninitiative petition to voting. Dkt. 26, ¶ 56. As Plaintiffs’ federal claims should be dismissed for \nfailure to state a justiciable controversy, this Court should decline to exercise supplemental \njurisdiction over the Illinois Constitutional claim. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3); and see Wright v. \nAssociated Insurance Cos., Inc., 29 F.3d 1244, 1250-1251 (7th Cir. 1994) (The general rule is \nthat, when all federal claims are dismissed before trial, the district court should relinquish \njurisdiction over pendent state-law claims rather than resolving them on the merits.). Here, \nbecause this Court lacks jurisdiction over the federal claims it should likewise dismiss Plaintiffs’ \nState law claim.   \nSetting aside the supplemental jurisdiction issue, Plaintiffs’ Illinois Constitution claim \nfails as they raise no allegations of wrongdoing against the County Clerk and fail to demonstrate \nhow the Clerk’s limited role in the petition process violates their purported rights. Indeed, as the \npetition requirements have not been enforced against Plaintiffs, their claims under the Illinois \nConstitution are likewise premature. Plaintiffs’ added Count III raises no controversy with the \nCounty Clerk thus their Amended Complaint should be dismissed. \nIII.  Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint Fails to State a Cause of Action Against the County \nClerk.   \n \nThe Amended Complaint against the County Clerk should be dismissed because there is \nno misconduct or wrongdoing alleged against the County Clerk and the Clerk does not have the \nauthority to effectuate any of the relief sought by Plaintiffs. In fact, Plaintiffs concede that the \nCounty Clerk does not certify referendums but rather, only places referendums on the ballot that \nhave  been  certified  by  the  clerks  of  suburban  municipalities.  (Dkt.  26,  ¶12).  Clearly,  by \nPlaintiffs’ own admission, the County Clerk has no role in this referendum process. The County \nClerk is not authorized to accept filings of petitions for constitutional amendments. See Article \nXIV, Section 3 of 1970 Illinois Constitution. It is not authorized to accept filings of initiative \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 43 Filed: 05/11/20 Page 8 of 10 PageID #:412\nreferendums or to certify such referendums. See Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS 5/1 – 1 – 1; \nIllinois Election Code, 10 LCS 5/28 – 1 et seq. Nor is it empowered to enforce and administer \nIllinois election laws with respect to the filing of referendums. Plaintiffs have failed to allege any \nwrongdoing or misconduct by the County Clerk. In addition, the County Clerk cannot offer any \nof the relief contained in Plaintiffs’ Prayer for Relief. The County Clerk does not enforce Illinois \npetition  collection  requirements  therefore  it  cannot  be  enjoined  from  enforcing  such \nrequirements. If this Court were to order that petitions may be submitted electronically, those \npetitions would not be submitted to the County Clerk. Finally, the County Clerk does not have \nthe power or authority to move the deadline by which petitions must be filed or to reduce the \nnumber of signatures required. Since clearly no misconduct or wrongdoing is alleged against the \nCounty Clerk and the Clerk does not have the authority to effectuate any of the relief sought by \nPlaintiffs, the Amended Complaint against the County Clerk should be dismissed.  \nConclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ claims are not ripe and no justiciable controversy \nexists. Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, to the extent they exist, have not been constrained in any \nway as the Illinois petition requirements have not yet been enforced. Additionally, Cook County \nClerk  Karen  Yarbrough  was  named  in  the  Amended  Complaint  but  clearly  committed  no \nwrongdoing, is not involved in the petition process, and cannot effectuate the relief Plaintiffs \nseek. As such, Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint should be dismissed in its entirety. \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 43 Filed: 05/11/20 Page 9 of 10 PageID #:413\nWHEREFORE Respondent Karen A.

Charles R. Norgle, Sr. \n            ) \nJESSE WHITE, et al.       ) \n            ) \n      Defendants.    ) \n             \nDEFENDANT JESSE WHITE’S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS’ EMERGENCY \nMOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY OR PERMANENT INJUNCTION AND \nDECLARATION AS A MATTER OF LAW \n \nINTRODUCTION \n  Plaintiffs wish to circulate a petition for a constitutional amendment referendum to be \nplaced on the November 3, 2020 general election ballot.  They allege that due to the COVID-19 \ncrisis and the Governor’s resulting Executive Order, they are unable to collect signatures in \nperson, as required by the Illinois Election Code.  In addition to the members of the Illinois State \nBoard of Elections and several local defendants, they have sued Secretary of State Jesse White in \nhis official capacity for declaratory and injunctive relief.  But the Secretary of State does not \nenforce  the  petition  collection  requirements  at  issue here.    His  role  is  initially  ministerial:  \nproposed constitutional amendments are filed with the Secretary of State, who then “deliver[s] \nsuch petition[s] to the State Board of Elections” within one business day.  10 ILCS 5/28-9.  Once \nthe State Board of Elections hears and passes on any objections, id. at 5/28-4, the Secretary of \nState ensures that any proposed amendments are published in newspapers throughout the State \n(in multiple languages) and that pamphlets describing the amendments are mailed to every \nmailing address in the State (again, in multiple languages). \n1 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 20 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 2 of 9 PageID #:121\n  The Secretary of State takes no position regarding plaintiffs’ challenge to provisions of \nthe Election Code that he does not administer or enforce.  However, as set forth below, he \nobjects strongly to two components of plaintiffs’ requested relief.  First, he opposes plaintiffs’ \nrequest that this Court extend the deadline for them to file their proposed referendum by three \nmonths, from May 3, 2020 to August 3, 2020.  Such an extension would make it impossible for \nthe  Secretary  of  State  to  fulfill  his  obligations  relating  to  the  publication  of  proposed \namendments and the distribution of pamphlets in time for the November 3, 2020 election.  \nSecond, to the extent that plaintiffs seek an order compelling the Secretary of State to develop \nand implement an online petitioning and signature collection system (their request is not clear), \nhe opposes such relief.  Any such request should not be directed at the Secretary of State, who \ndoes not administer or enforce the Election Code’s petition collection requirements.  Moreover, \nit is not feasible to develop such a system (again, if that is what plaintiffs are requesting) under \nthe tight time frames at issue here. \nARGUMENT \nPlaintiffs seek multiple forms of relief:  (1) a declaration that the Election Code’s petition \ncollection  requirements  (mandating  that  signatures  be  collected  in-person)  cannot  be \nconstitutionally enforced under the current circumstances, and corresponding injunctive relief; \n(2) an order reducing by 50% the number of signatures required for a constitutional amendment \nreferendum; (3) an order extending by three months the constitutional and statutory May 3, 2020 \ndeadline for plaintiffs to collect signatures and file their proposed constitutional amendment \nreferendum;  and  (4)  an  order  requiring  defendants  to  “allow  for  petitions  to  be  submitted \nelectronically via names of qualified electors collected by an online form to be created by the \nSecretary of State.”  (Dkt. No. 6 at 10-11)    \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 20 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 3 of 9 PageID #:122\n1.  In-Person Signature and Notarization Requirements \nThe Election Code requires that referendum petition sheets must include a sworn and \nnotarized statement by the petition circulator that “the signatures on that sheet of the petition \nwere signed in his or her presence and are genuine.”  10 ILCS 5/28-3; Dkt. No. 1 at 38.  The \nSecretary of State does not administer or enforce this requirement, see 10 ILCS 5/28-4, and takes \nno  position  with  respect  to  plaintiffs’  request  to  enjoin  its  enforcement  in  the  present \ncircumstances. \n2.  Number of Signatures Required \nBoth  the  Illinois  Constitution  and  the  Election  Code  require  that  petitions  for \nconstitutional amendments be signed by “a number of electors equal in number to at least eight \npercent  of  the  total  votes  cast  for  candidates  for  Governor  in  the  preceding  gubernatorial \nelection.”  Ill. Const. Art. XIV, § 3; 10 ILCS 5/28-9.   The Secretary of State does not administer \nor enforce this requirement, see 10 ILCS 5/28-4, and takes no position with respect to plaintiffs’ \nrequest for a reduction in the number of required signatures. \n3.  Deadline to Collect Signatures and File Petition \n  Under the Illinois Constitution and the Election Code, the deadline for plaintiffs to collect \nsignatures and file their petition with the Secretary of State is May 3, 2020.  Ill. Const. Art. XIV, \n§ 3 (requiring petition for constitutional amendment to be filed “at least six months” before the \ngeneral election); 10 ILCS 5/28-9 (same).  Plaintiffs seek a court-ordered three-month extension \nof this deadline.  The Secretary of State opposes this request.  Such an extension—or, for that \nmatter, any extension of the deadline by more than about two weeks—would make it essentially \nimpossible  for  the  Secretary  of  State  to  fulfill  his  publication  and  pamphlet  distribution \nobligations for the November 2020 general election. \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 20 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 4 of 9 PageID #:123\nThe  existing  timeframes  are already  tight.    By  statute,  if  a petition  for a  proposed \nconstitutional amendment survives any challenges before the State Board of Elections and in \ncourt, the Secretary of State must publish the amendment at least one month before the election \n(October 3, 2020) “in at least one secular newspaper of general circulation in every county in this \nState in which a newspaper is published.”  5 ILCS 20/2 (emphasis added).  In counties in which \ntwo or more newspapers are published, he must publish in two newspapers.  Id.  In counties with \nmore than 500,000 people, he must publish in no less than six newspapers of general circulation.  \nId.    After  the  first  publication,  the  publication  must  be  repeated  once  each  week  for  two \nconsecutive weeks.  Id.    \n  To meet the October 3, 2020 publication deadline, the Secretary of State starts working in \nearly May, shortly after the petition filing deadline.  (Ex. 1 (Williams Dec.) at ¶4)  The National \nVoting Rights Act requires that the proposed amendments be translated into multiple languages \nprior to publication.  See 52 U.S.C. § 10503.  Thus, the Secretary of State must go through a \nprocurement process for translation services, with informal bids for translators starting in mid-\nMay and contracts awarded by around June 8.  (Id. at ¶5)  The Secretary of State must also \nprocure newspaper publishing; a bid is posted by about May 20 to secure a publishing contract \nby the end of June.  (Id. at ¶6)  Final drafts of proposed amendments, in all languages, should be \ncompleted by early August, and all work on newspaper publication must be complete by about \nSeptember 9 to ensure timely publication.  (Id. at ¶7) \nThe Secretary of State must also ensure that proposed amendments are published in a \npamphlet mailed to every address in the State at least one month prior to the election.  (Id. at ¶8; \n5 ILCS 20/2)  The pamphlet must include not only the text of the amendment, but also an \nexplanation  of  the  amendment,  the  arguments  for  it  (provided  by  its  proponent),  and  the \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 20 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 5 of 9 PageID #:124\narguments against it (provided by the General Assembly or Attorney General).  (Id.)  Once the \nSecretary of State receives the arguments, the pamphlet must be proofed, translated into multiple \nlanguages in accordance with the National Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10503, sent to a \nprinter, printed, delivered from the printer to a mailing service, delivered from the mailing \nservice to the post office, and shipped.  (Id. at ¶9) \nThe existing timelines again have little margin for adjustment.  The Secretary of State \nposts a bid for printing and mailing services by around May 18 in order to award a contract by \nthe end of June.  (Id. at ¶10)  The pamphlet is developed and then translated into multiple \nlanguages by around mid-July.  (Id. at ¶11)  The final pamphlet proof must be sent to the printer \nin all languages by August 11.  (Id.)  The pamphlets are printed and delivered to a mailing \nservice by September 1, with shipments to the post office until the end of September, so that the \npamphlets can be in the mail by the October 3 statutory deadline.  (Id.)   \n  Plaintiffs’ request for a court order extending the deadlines to submit a petition fails on \nthe merits for the reasons stated in the State Board of Elections’ opposition, which the Secretary \nof State adopts and incorporates by reference with respect to this point.  Moreover, balance of \nharm  considerations  warrant  denial  of  plaintiffs’  request.    As  set  forth  above,  plaintiffs’ \nrequested three-month extension would make it essentially impossible for the Secretary of State \nto  comply  with  the  publication  and  pamphlet  deadlines  for  the  November 3  election,  thus \njeopardizing the validity of any proposed constitutional amendments.  Plaintiffs’ requested three-\nmonth extension of the filing deadline should be denied.   \n4.  Electronic Submission of Petitions and Online Form \nFinally, plaintiffs seek injunctive relief requiring defendants to “allow for petitions to be \nsubmitted electronically via names of qualified electors collected by an online form to be created \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 20 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 6 of 9 PageID #:125\nby the Secretary of State.”  (Dkt. No. 6 at 10-11)  It is unclear exactly what plaintiffs are \nrequesting, or why they have directed this request to the Secretary of State.  As explained above, \naside from his obligations relating to the publication of proposed amendments in newspapers and \nthe distribution of pamphlets, the Secretary of State’s role is purely ministerial.  “Upon receipt of \na petition for a proposed Constitutional amendment, the Secretary of State shall, as soon as is \npracticable, but no later than the close of the next business day, deliver such petition to the Board \nof Elections.”  10 ILCS 5/28-9.   \nThe Secretary of State understands that the State Board of Elections is willing to agree to \nenjoin the State’s in-person signature and notarization requirements set forth in 10 ILCS 5/28-3, \ngiven  the  ongoing  COVID-19  public  health  crisis.    Should  the  Court  enjoin  the in-person \nsignature requirement (again, the Secretary of State takes no position on this issue), plaintiffs \ncould circulate petition forms via their websites, by email, by mail, and petition signers could \nreturn signed1 petitions via email, mail, other electronic means, or any other means.  In these \ncircumstances, the Secretary of State would not object to accepting the petition filing for a \nconstitutional amendment (due May 3, 20200) in electronic form rather than hard copy, in order \nto transmit the filing to the State Board of Elections pursuant to Section 28-9 of the Election \nCode.  10 ILCS 5/28-9. \nThis should address plaintiff’s concerns.  But if plaintiffs nevertheless seek a court order \ncompelling the Secretary  of State to develop and implement  a system allowing persons to \nelectronically-sign their petitions (again, the nature of their request is unclear), the Secretary of \nState would strongly oppose such relief.  The Secretary of State does not administer or enforce \nthe  Election  Code’s  petition  collection  requirements,  including  the  in-person  signature \n                                                      \n1 A physical “wet” signature would still be required on the petition. \n \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 20 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 7 of 9 PageID #:126\nrequirement at issue here.  The Secretary of State is not responsible for vetting or verifying \nsignatures; he receives petitions for constitutional amendments and promptly transmits them to \nthe State Board of Elections.  10 ILCS 5/28-9.  To the extent that plaintiffs are requesting the \nSecretary of State to develop an electronic signature system, their request is misdirected and \nshould be denied. \nFurther, plaintiffs cannot satisfy the legal requirements for the issuance of a TRO or \npreliminary injunction compelling the Secretary of State to immediately implement an electronic \nsignature  platform  for  proposed  constitutional  amendments.    Injunctive  relief  is  “an \nextraordinary and drastic remedy, one that should not be granted unless the movant, by a clear \nshowing, carries the burden of persuasion.” Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997) \n(emphasis  in  original).    To  obtain  a  temporary  restraining  order  or preliminary  injunction, \nplaintiffs must make a clear showing that: (1) they are likely to succeed on the merits; (2) they \nare likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) the balance of \nequities tips in their favor; and (4) that the injunction is in the public interest. Winter v. Natural \nRes. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  The court “must balance the competing claims of \ninjury and must consider the effect on each party of granting or withholding the requested relief,” \npaying “particular regard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of \ninjunction.”  Id. at 24.  \nPlaintiffs’ burden in this case is even greater than usual because, rather than seeking to \npreserve the status quo, they seek mandatory relief requiring the development of a new system.  \nMandatory injunctions are “rarely issued,” interlocutory mandatory injunctions are “even more \nrarely issued,” and neither should be issued “except upon the clearest equitable grounds.” W.A. \nMack, Inc. v. Gen. Motors Corp., 260 F.2d 886, 890 (7th Cir. 1958); see also Graham v. Med. \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 20 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 8 of 9 PageID #:127\nMut. of Ohio, 130 F.2d 293, 295 (7th Cir. 1997) (stating that “mandatory preliminary writs are \nordinarily cautiously viewed and sparingly issued”).  Moreover, “[a] preliminary injunction that \nwould give the movant substantially all the relief he seeks is disfavored, and courts have imposed \na higher burden on a movant in such cases.”  Boucher v. Sch. Bd. of Sch. Dist. of Greenfield, 134 \nF.3d 821, 827 n.6 (7th Cir. 1998); W.A. Mack, 260 F.2d at 890 (“A preliminary injunction does \nnot issue which gives to a plaintiff the actual advantage which would be obtained in a final \ndecree.”). \nHere, plaintiffs cannot meet their high burden.  Plaintiffs have made no showing at all \nthat implementation of an electronic signature system is necessary to prevent irreparable harm, \nespecially if the State Board of Elections will to agree to enjoin the State’s in-person signature \nand notarization requirements set forth in 10 ILCS 5/28-3.  Balance of harm and public interest \nconsiderations also weigh strongly against a court order compelling the immediate development \nand implementation of an e-signature platform.   Unlike some other states, Illinois does not \ncurrently utilize an e-signature platform, and it is simply not possible for the Secretary of State to \ndevelop from scratch (or procure) such a system and implement it statewide for immediate use \nunder the timeframes at issue here, given that the deadline to submit petitions for constitutional \namendments is May 3, 2020, just a few weeks away. \nTrying to implement a new e-signature system on a fire-drill basis—if that were even \npossible, which it is not—could likely lead to all kinds of problems and unanticipated issues, \nincluding an increased risk of fraud, which the signature requirement is intended to prevent.  See, \ne.g., John Doe No. 1 v. Reed, 561 U.S. 186, 197 (2010) (“The State’s interest in preserving the \nintegrity  of  the  electoral  process  is  undoubtedly  important.”).    The  Supreme  Court  has \n“repeatedly emphasized that lower federal courts should ordinarily not alter the election rules on \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 20 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 9 of 9 PageID #:128\nthe eve of the election.”  Republican Nat’l Comm. v. Democratic Nat’l Comm., NA 19A1016, \n2020 WL 1672702, at *1 (U.S. Apr. 6, 2020).  See also Buckley v. Am. Constitutional Law \nFound., 525 U.S. 182, 191 (1999) (“States allowing ballot initiatives have considerable leeway to \nprotect the integrity and reliability of the initiative process.”). \nIn sum, this Court should reject any request by plaintiffs for a mandatory injunction \nrequiring the State to adopt and implement a new e-filing system for constitutional amendment \npetitions for the November 3, 2020 general election.  This is not possible under the time frames \nat issue here, plaintiffs have made no showing that such a system is necessary to prevent \nirreparable harm, and balance of harm and public interest considerations strongly weigh against \nsuch extreme relief.  \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, this Court should deny plaintiffs’ motion with respect to \ncertain requests for relief as detailed above. \n \nDated:  April 16, 2020   \n \n            Respectfully submitted,   \nKWAME RAOUL       \nAttorney General of Illinois      /s/ Michael T.

My  name  is  Amy  Williams.  I  am  an  attorney  at  the  Office  of the  Illinois \nSecretary of State.  In my role, I am familiar with and have knowledge regarding the process and \ntimelines  for  the  Secretary of State  to  publish  and  distribute  pamphlets  regarding  proposed \nconstitutional amendments. \n2.  Exhibit A hereto is the internal working timeline that the Secretary of State uses \nto  meet  the  deadlines  for  newspaper  publication  and  pamphlet  distribution.  The  attached \ntimeline is specific to 2020; however, the Secretary of State has used the same timeline, making \nadjustments for the date of the general election but keeping the timeframes consistent, for at least \nthe past seven years of elections. \n3.  By statute, if a  petition for a  proposed constitutional  amendment survives any \nchallenges before the State Board of Elections and in court, the Secretary of State must publish \nthe  amendment  at  least  one  month  before  the  election  (October  3,  2020)  in  newspapers \nthroughout Illinois. \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02189 Document #: 20-1 Filed: 04/16/20 Page 3 of 7 PageID #:131\n4.  To meet the October 3, 2020 publication deadline, the Secretary of State starts \nworking in early May, shortly after the petition filing deadline. \n5.  The  National  Voting  Rights  Act  requires  that  the  proposed  amendments  be \ntranslated into multiple languages prior to publication.  Thus, the Secretary of State must go \nthrough a procurement process for translation services, with informal bids for translators starting \nin mid-May and contracts awarded by around June 8. \n6.  The Secretary of State must also procure newspaper publishing; a bid is posted by \nabout May 20 to secure a publishing contract by the end of June. \n7.  Final drafts of proposed amendments, in all  languages, should be completed  by \nearly August, and all work on newspaper publication must be complete by about September 9 to \nensure timely publication. \n8.
