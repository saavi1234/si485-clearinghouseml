    "summary": "<p>On April 14, 2020, the Center for Juvenile Law and Policy (CJLP) and the Independent Juvenile Defender Program (IJDP), on behalf of all youth detained in Los Angeles County, filed a petition against the Los Angeles Juvenile Superior requesting the release of youth detainees. Originally filed in the Supreme Court of California, the case was kicked down to the Court of Appeals, with directions to issue an order to show cause. The case was returned before the Los Angeles County Superior Court and assigned to Judge Brett Bianco.</p>\r\n<p>On March 31, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors adopted a motion requiring the Probation Department and other county agencies to reduce and safeguard juvenile camp populations. On March 24, the LA Superior Court announced an expedited court process to release an extensive list of adult individuals held pretrial in county jails, which waived the need for a court hearing, immediately effective upon the court&rsquo;s ex parte review. The plaintiffs alleged that youth release, unlike adult release, still mandated the defendant&rsquo;s original procedure to conduct an individualized review of each youth&rsquo;s circumstances. Further, the plaintiffs noted that <a href=\"https://chronicleofsocialchange.org/justice/juvenile-justice-2/advocates-ask-california-supreme-court-to-release-l-a-youth-from-juvenile-jails/42451\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">only 66 youths were released from youth camps by mid-April</a>, with no additional strategy for mass release.</p>\r\n<p>This petition was filed after a probation officer at Barry J. Nirdoff Juvenile Hall (Juvenile Hall) tested positive for COVID-19 early April, which led to the spread of the virus to six probation officers and cohorts of youth into quarantine by April 13. Additionally, the plaintiffs alleged that youths detained at the Juvenile Hall did not have access to hand sanitizer and masks and that the facility did not adequately implement social distancing. The plaintiffs alleged that the failure to protect youth in confinement constituted a violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the California Constitution.</p>\r\n<p>Filed in the Supreme Court of California on April 15, the plaintiffs sought a writ of mandamus to immediately reduce youth populations in juvenile halls, conduct an expedited review of eligible LA County detainees, aged 12 to 23, suspend new admissions, and prohibit transfers into juvenile facilities. Additionally, the plaintiffs sought health and safety measures consistent with recommendations issued by the Center on Disease Control. The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel.</p>\r\n<p>On April 17, the defendants filed an informal response and denied that efforts to release youth from detention were inadequate.</p>\r\n<p>On April 22, the case was transferred to the Court of Appeals (Second Appellate District) with directions to issue an order to show cause returnable before the Los Angeles County Superior Court. Following the transfer, the case was deemed filed at the Superior Court of the State of California, and assigned to Judge Brett Bianco.</p>\r\n<p>On May 7, the petitioners filed a response asserting that the Probation Department adequately implemented CDC guidelines. On the same day, the LA County Probation Departed reported <a href=\"https://witnessla.com/two-kids-in-la-countys-juvenile-halls-test-positive-for-covid-19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">two confirmed cases</a></p>\r\n<p>of COVID-19 among youth, one held at Barry J, the other held at Central Juvenile Hall. By May 14, three youths held at Central Juvenile Hall, one youth at Barry J, and another youth at an unnamed facility tested positive for COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>On May 12, County Superior Court Judge Brett Bianco denied the petition, finding that the petition did not demonstrate sufficient evidence that the County had failed to act reasonably to protect detained youth, or that the youth were held in unconstitutional conditions.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Ultimately, the failure to protect \nyouth in confinement from a likely outbreak of COVID-19 constitutes a \nviolation of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and the \nCalifornia Constitution, as well as a violation of the very purpose of and \nduties of the juvenile court system. Under usual circumstances, the \nstatutory scheme for youth justice “is focused on the rehabilitation of \nthe child and thus makes detention of a child the exceptional practice, \nrather than the rule.” 2  In these unusual circumstances, Judicial \nCouncil reminded juvenile courts that they retain “broad discretion \nunder current law to release detained juveniles to protect the health of \nthose juveniles and the health and safety of the others in detention \nduring the current state of emergency related to the COVID-19 \n \n \n2 Emergency Rule 7, Advisory Committee Comment, Judicial Council \n(Apr. 6. 2020). \n7 \n \n\npandemic.” 3 This writ requests mandamus to issue to immediately and \nsubstantially reduce and safeguard youth populations in juvenile halls \nand camps through: immediate release of certain categories of youth in \nconfinement; expedited review and presumptive release of all other \nyouth; a presumptive prohibition on all new admissions into juvenile \nhalls; a prohibition on transfers into all juvenile camps and county \njails; and safety and health precautions consistent with protocols issued \nby the Center on Disease Control to prevent and contain COVID-19 \ninfection.   \n   \n \n \n3 Id. \n8 \n \n\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA \n   \nCenter for Juvenile Law and Policy, and   \nIndependent Juvenile Defender Program    \n   \nOn behalf of    \n   \nALL YOUTH DETAINED IN JUVENILE  No. \nHALLS AND CAMPS IN LOS ANGELES   \nCOUNTY4  PETITION FOR \n   WRIT OF MANDATE \n     Petitioners,   \n   \n     v.   \n \n \nLOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT \n \n(JUVENILE) \n \n     \n   \nRespondents. \n \n   \nPETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE \n \nTO THE HONORABLE CHIEF JUSTICE AND JUSTICES OF THE \nSUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA: \n \n  Petitioners, Center for Juvenile Law and Policy (“CJLP”) and \nIndependent Juvenile Defender Program (“IJDP”), hereby petition this \nHonorable Court for a writ of mandate directed to Respondent Superior \nCourt to immediately and substantially reduce and safeguard youth \npopulations in juvenile halls and camps through: immediate release of \n \n \n4 The Petition excludes any individual youth for whom, after \nconsultation with counsel and based on the likelihood of negative \nconsequences, a decision is made not be included. \n9 \n \n\ncertain categories of youth in confinement; expedited review and \npresumptive release of all other youth; a presumptive prohibition on all \nnew admissions into juvenile halls; a prohibition on transfers into all \njuvenile camps and county jails; and safety and health precautions \nconsistent with protocols issued by the Center on Disease Control to \nprevent and contain COVID-19 infection.   \n  This writ should issue to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 into \nand beyond Los Angeles County’s juvenile halls and camps, saving lives \nand preventing devastating harm to young people in custody and their \nsurrounding communities.  This Court has proper jurisdiction to issue \nmandamus as an extraordinary remedy under extraordinary \ncircumstances. (Cal.

Matosantos (2011) 53 Cal. 4th 231, 253 (state \nSupreme Court has original jurisdiction over matters “of sufficiently \ngreat importance and require immediate resolution.”).)   \nBy this verified petition, Petitioners represent that:  \n* \nNo other petition for writ for mandate, or for any other \nextraordinary relief has been made by or on behalf of petitioners \nrelating to this matter. \n* \nPetitioner CJLP is a public-interest law clinic at Loyola Law \nSchool that trains certified law students to holistically represent at-risk \nyouth in delinquency proceedings, transfer hearings, educational \nhearings, and post-conviction proceedings throughout Los Angeles \nCounty.  CJLP employs a team-representation model, in which every \nclient facing prosecution in the juvenile justice system receives a \n10 \n \n\ndelinquency lawyer, a social worker, and an educational lawyer, as well \nas certified law students to support them throughout their case and \nduring any subsequent period of supervision.  Many clients of CJLP are \ndetained in juvenile halls and camps throughout Los Angeles County.  \nPetitioner IJDP, which is housed at the Los Angeles County Bar \nAssociation, provides free legal services to indigent youth in the county \nwho are facing criminal charges in juvenile court through a panel of 50 \nindependent attorneys.  IJDP panel attorneys are vetted by IJDP, \ntrained and supported by IJDP resources, and supervised by IJDP to \nensure that youths receive competent representation, consistent with \nbest practices for juvenile delinquency practice.  In addition, IJDP \nprovides direct representation in matters involving pre-trial writs, \nresource advocacy, investigations and forensic social work where called \nupon by members of the IJDP panel.  \n* \nRespondent is the Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles.  \n* \nSUMMARY OF FACTS \n \nA. The Covid-19 Global Pandemic Is a Continuous Threat to \nLos Angeles County. \n \nThe COVID-19 is a global pandemic, ravaging communities and \ncausing massive upheaval.  In just over three months, COVID-19 has \nspread across the world exponentially.  There is no vaccine to protect \nagainst COVID-19, nor are there any known effective treatments for \nthose who contact the disease. (Haney Decl.; Barnert Decl.)  The virus \nspreads incredibly efficiently. Because humans have never been \n11 \n \n\nexposed to the virus, no one is immune, or spared from its lethal effects. \n(Barnert Decl.)  Therefore, according to its most aggressive projections, \nthe Center for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) estimates that \nCOVID-19 could infect more than 200 million people in the United \nStates and 1.7 million individuals could die, if effective public health \nmeasures are not taken.5  As of April 13, 2020, over 1.7 million people \naround the world have received confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19,6 \nincluding 554,849 people in the United States.7  At least 111,828 people \nhave died globally as a result of COVID-19,8 including 21,942 in the \nUnited States.9 \nCalifornia is no exception to the crisis.  The first California case \nof COVID-19 was confirmed in Orange County in late January.10  Since \nthen, the virus has spread throughout the state.

Protecting youth from COVID-19 is crucial to protecting \nthe general public.  \n \n   Though older populations are at the greatest risk of serious \nillness or death from COVID-19, the virus still poses grave dangers to \nyouth.29  The disease has killed children across the United States, \nincluding in Los Angeles County,30 and available data shows constant \ngrowth in the number of individuals admitted into pediatric intensive \ncare units across the country.31  According to the largest study of \npediatric COVID-19 cases to date, approximately six percent of infected \nchildren and 11 percent of infected infants have had severe or critical \ncases.32  Crucially, even when young people do not develop any \nsymptoms, they become vectors who can unwittingly transmit the virus \nto more vulnerable populations.33  (Barnert Decl.)   \n \n \n29 Stephanie Nebehay, WHO Message To Youth on Coronavirus: ‘You \nAre Not Invincible’ (Mar. 20, 2020), https://reut.rs/343yLvg. \n30 Taryn Luna et al., L.A.

In a recent lawsuit filed in Washington on behalf of \ndetained immigrants, noted University of Michigan Medical School \nProfessor Dr. Jonathan Louis Golub provided a declaration stating: \n“Even in younger and healthier people, infection of this virus requires \nsupportive care, which includes supplemental oxygen, positive pressure \nventilation, and in extreme cases, extracorporeal mechanical \noxygenation.”34 \n \nC. Carceral Settings Pose Dire Health Risks During the \nCOVID-19 Pandemic. \n \nA number of factors—the spatial constraints of personal and \ncommunal spaces, the underlying health conditions of many inmates, \npoor infection control, lack of soap and other hygiene essentials—\nconspire to make prisons, jails, and juvenile detention facilities \npotential hotbeds of contagion during the pandemic.35 (Barnert Decl; \nHaney Decl.)  The CDC has explained that correctional facilities \n“present unique challenges for control of COVID-19 transmission \namong incarcerated/detained persons, [detention center] staff, and \n \n \n34 Declaration of Dr. Jonathan Louis Golub (dated Mar. 13, 2020), filed \nin Dawson v. Asher, W.D. Washington, Case no. 2:20-cv-409 (Motion for \nTemporary Restraining Order.) \n35 See, e.g., Joseph A. Bick, Infection Control in Jails and Prisons, 45 \nClinical Infectious Diseases 1047, 1047 (Oct. 2007) (in jails “[t]he \nprobability of transmission of potentially pathogenic organisms is \nincreased by crowding, delays in medical evaluation and treatment, \nrationed access to soap, water, and clean laundry, [and] insufficient \ninfection-control expertise”). \n18 \n \n\nvisitors.”36 Social distancing is, in the CDC’s own words, “challenging to \npractice in correctional and detention environments,”37 as with all \ncongregate settings.  In light of this reality, the Chief Justice of the \nCalifornia Supreme Court issued an advisory, urging court officials \nthroughout the state to take actions to reduce prison and jail \npopulations and has suspended superior court jury trials across the \nstate.38  Taking heed, Los Angeles County has made swift efforts to \nreduce jail populations by granting early releases to approximately \n3,500 adults as of April 7, 2020.39 \n   The speed at which the virus has raced through other \njurisdiction’s carceral infrastructure is a forecast of what could \ninevitably happen in Los Angeles County without more sweeping \nintervention.

Though physical \ndistancing is the best tool for combating coronavirus, implementing \nsuch practice is challenged if not nearly impossible in juvenile facilities. \n(Barnert Decl.; Haney Decl.)  Indeed, as the facilities scramble to \nprevent or contain viral outbreaks, residents will be and have already \nbeen placed in isolation.  At Sylmar Juvenile Hall, for example, \nprobation officials placed 21 youths in quarantine after a first probation \nofficer at the facility tested positive for COVID-19, and another 22 \nyouths after a second officer was confirmed with the virus.46  Such \nsocial isolation can exacerbate underlying trauma disorders and lead to \nanxiety, depression, self-harm, psychosis, and even suicide.47  In \ndetention settings, isolation may also resemble solitary confinement, \nwhich can cause, sometimes irreversibly, mental and physical harm to \nany person, but even more so youth.

The WHO has warned that \nchildren and teens are uniquely susceptible to the stress induced by the \npandemic and has encouraged parents to reassure their children, \nmaintain routines, and facilitate connections with friends and family. \nBut children detained in juvenile facilities, especially those placed in \nisolation, are left to face the uncertainty of the pandemic alone.  (Haney \nDecl.; Barnert Decl.) \n \n2.  Youth in confinement have higher incidences of underlying \nphysical and mental health issues that increases their \nvulnerability to the pandemic. \n \nYouth in detention are medically vulnerable because of their \ndocumented higher incidence of underlying health conditions, \nincreasing both their susceptibility to contracting the virus and related \ncomplications. (Hardy Decl.; Barnert Decl.)  One study found that 46 \n \n \n48 Office of the Inspector General, Report Response in the OIG \nInvestigation & Improving Mental Health Treatment & Safety in the \nJuvenile Facilities (Apr. 26, 2019). \n23 \n \n\npercent of youths entering correctional facilities had medical \nproblems.49  Pediatric medicine is typically preventative, but youth \ninvolved in the juvenile justice system access more emergency care and \nless preventative care as compared to their peers.50  As a consequence, \njustice-involved youth typically experience disproportionate negative \nhealth outcomes.51  In the context of COVID-19, the population is thus \nmore vulnerable, as the virus has been shown to be especially \ndamaging and more deadly to individuals with underlying medical \nconditions, regardless of age.  (Graves Decl.)  Indeed, roughly two-\nthirds of all pediatric patients committed to the ICU with coronavirus \nin the United States have presented with some comorbidities.52 \n \nE. Attempts to release and safeguard youth in juvenile halls \nand camps in Los Angeles County have fallen short of \nadequate standards of care. \n \nThe coronavirus pandemic has emerged with such speed that like \ntoo many jurisdictions, Los Angeles County has necessarily scrambled \n \n \n49 Karen Hein et al., Juvenile Detention: Another Boundary Issue for \nPhysicians, 66 vol. 2 PEDIATRICS 239, 239 (1980), \nhttps://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/66/2/239.full.pd\nf.  \n50 Nicole Westman, To Reduce Long-Term Health Gaps, a Push for \nEarly Intervention in Juvenile Detention, Juvenile Justice Information \nExchange (July 30, 2018), https://jjie.org/2018/07/30/to-reduce-long-\nterm-health-gaps-a-push-for-early-intervention-in-juvenile-detention/ \n51 Id.

For detained or incarcerated \nindividuals, state and local leaders have taken some action to reduce, \nas well as protect, their populations in recognition of the threat of \nCOVID-19 in institutional settings.  Among the actions taken as the \npandemic and information about it evolved was the issuance of \nemergency rules by the Judicial Council of California on April 7 – one \nof which regarded delinquency proceedings to “ensure that detention \nhearings for juveniles in delinquency court must be held in a timely \nmanner to ensure that no child is detained who does not need to be \ndetained to protect the child or the community.”  In its comment on the \nrule, the Council emphasized that the statutory scheme for youth “is \nfocused on the rehabilitation of the child and thus makes detention of a \nchild the exceptional practice, rather than the rule,” and reminded \njuvenile courts that they retain “broad discretion under current law to \nrelease detained juveniles to protect the health of those juveniles and \nthe health and safety of the others in detention during the current state \nof emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic.”53 \nStill, efforts in Los Angeles County to review the basis of \ndetention and incarceration, and release every youth possible under \nthese exigent circumstances have been slowed by a severely reduced \ncapacity and changed operation of juvenile courts, and an adherence to \ncase-by-case individualized review. (Yamashiro Decl.)  Not surprisingly, \nand consistent with research and expert observations, implementation \nof COVID-19 safeguards within juvenile halls and camps has also been \n \n \n53 Emergency Rule 7, Advisory Committee Comment, Judicial Council \n(Apr. 6. 2020). \n25 \n \n\nchallenged in the meantime. (Id.; Kennedy Decl.; Gunsberg Decl.; \nHeimov Decl.)   \n \n1.  Juvenile courts have failed to swiftly review and release every \nyouth in confinement possible in Los Angeles.  \n \nSome progress has been made to reduce the population of \njuvenile halls and camps during the pandemic – for instance, over one \nweek between April 6 and April 13, camp populations decreased by 25 \n(from 252 to 227) and hall populations by 24 (from 401 to 377).54  While \npositive, such incremental progress to release youth is incongruent \nwith the current state of emergency, and with the need, more than \never, to advance the rehabilitative mission of the juvenile justice \nsystem and the notion that detention is an “exceptional practice.” 55  \nIn contrast and in spite of scaled-down operations and \ncontinuances of certain proceedings in all 38 courthouses across Los \nAngeles County (Yamashiro Decl.), efforts to reduce jail populations \nhave taken a systematic, sweeping approach.  On March 23, the Los \nAngeles County Board of Supervisors issued an executive order \ndirecting collaboration and action by the Sheriff’s Department and \nother relevant stakeholders to reduce and protect jail populations from \nthe spread of coronavirus.56  On March 24, Presiding Judge Kevin C. \n \n \n54  Population Statistics, Juvenile Institutions, Los Angeles County \nDepartment of Probation (April 6-13, 2020). \n55 Alene Tchekmedyian, A member of the nursing staff at L.A.

On March 31, 2020, the Board of Supervisors ratified \nits executive order from the week prior.58 On April 13, the Superior \nCourt announced it would continue to work with justice partners on jail \nrelease of adults in response to the pandemic. (Yamashiro Decl.)   \nWith respect to youth in confinement, the Board also adopted a \nmotion on the same date, requiring updates from the Probation \nDepartment and other county agencies on their efforts to reduce and \nsafeguard juvenile hall and camp populations.59  More than two weeks \n \n \nHealth Emergency Regarding Novel Coronavirus, Los Angeles County \nBoard of Supervisors (Mar. 23, 2020),  https://covid19.lacounty.gov/wp-\ncontent/uploads/23032020HP_MFP_M577141222-1.pdf.  \n57 Presiding Judge Kevin C.

Board of Supervisors (Mar. 31, \n2020). \n27 \n \n\nlater after, continuous efforts to ensure greater, transparency, \naccountability and bold action by the Probation Department and \nJuvenile Court to reduce youth populations in halls and camps remain \nhampered.  No global approach as has happened with adults to \nexpedite reviewing cases of and release youth en masse has been \naccepted. (Yamashiro Decl.)  Quite the opposite, the Juvenile Court has \nmaintained that the original presiding court must conduct an \nindividualized review of each youth’s circumstances, even if, for \ninstance, the defense, prosecution and Probation are aligned in their \nrecommendations for release. (Id.; Kennedy Decl.; Gunsberg Decl.)   \nYet, the juvenile court system in Los Angeles is now operating at \nless than 50 percent capacity to conduct such individualized reviews.  \nOn April 10, 2020, the Presiding Judge of the Superior Court’s Juvenile \nDivision delivered notification that the limited operations would \nremain in place until June 22, 2020. (Yamashiro Decl.)  Currently, only \nnine or fewer of the 18 juvenile bench officers are regularly presiding \nover cases since the onset of the crisis. (Yamashiro Decl.; Kennedy \nDecl.; Gunsberg Decl.)  The current delinquency bench appears to work \non a rotation, but no formal notification has issued as to that rotation. \n(Yamashiro Decl.)  Five bench officers seem to keep erratic schedules \nthat differ from day-to-day.  One bench officer hears cases in a \ncourthouse different than the one he is normally assigned.  Only four \nbench officers are hearing their regular calendars in their regular \ncourtrooms.  So far, no clear directives have issued from any of the \njuvenile courts “as to how or where defense counsel should file motions \nor how to direct these to the appropriate bench officer when a \ncourtroom is closed.” (Kennedy Decl.; Gunsberg Decl.)  As the courts \n28 \n \n\nand its administrative office decline to employ any electronic means of \ncommunication with attorneys, the prosecution and defense bar have \ndiscovered they must submit motions to a “drop box” outside \ncourthouses that is dangerously exposed to persons as they enter and \nexit one of the busiest juvenile court systems in the United States. \n(Yamashiro Decl.) \nIn spite of the altered and reduced operations of the juvenile \ncourts, probation alongside legal offices have submitted routine motions \nand arguments for youths’ release. (Yamashiro Decl.; Kennedy Decl.; \nGunsberg Decl.)  In an effort by Probation to move for the release of \nover 40 youth, notice of the motions was not provided to attorneys, and \nin several cases, the Juvenile Court denied release without permitting \nthe youth to be heard, providing the probation reports supporting the \ndecision, and without entering the decision into the minutes. \n(Yamashiro Decl.)  In one case, IJDP counsel was permitted to appear \nand argue for his client, though he was not provided with the \nunderlying probation report ostensibly supporting the Juvenile Court’s \ndenial, and was initially refused an expedited transcript for appellate \nreview. (Id.) For another IJDP attorney, the adjusted and reduced court \ncapacity has meant that all seven of his clients who are confined in the \nhalls and camps are navigating courts that have been altered in their \nschedule and capacity. (Gunsberg Decl.)  While successfully filing and \nappearing on motions for release on behalf of three clients, CJLP has \nbeen delayed on two other motions; in one case, defense counsel is still \nawaiting a hearing date on a motion she delivered in person on April 8 \nto a box at the juvenile court, and in another, counsel was rerouted to a \ndifferent courtroom, was advised that a hearing would take place in \n29 \n \n\napproximately two weeks, and only after persistent follow-up \ncommunication, succeeded in advancing the hearing date. (Kennedy \nDecl.) \nAs review of youths’ requests for release happen on a case-by-case \nbasis, defender officers and advocates alike have called for broader, \nswifter measures to reduce hall and camp populations since at least \nmid-March.60  Concern about an outbreak in Los Angeles County’s \njuvenile facilities is not just a remote possibility.  Six probation officers \nat juvenile facilities have already tested positive,61 the virus has is \nspreading in the county’s adult detention centers,62 and there have \nbeen reports of symptomatic individuals in juvenile detention centers.63  \nLast week on April 7, one county agency weighed in publicly on the \nurgency of population reduction: the Los Angeles County Board of \nEducation passed an emergency resolution to “protect the educational \nfuture of students in probation camps and halls” through advocating for \n \n \n60 See, e.g., Tyler Kingkade, Coronavirus in juvenile detention is a \n'nightmare scenario,' doctors and advocates say, CBS News (Mar. 27, \n2020); Dr. Robert K.

Youth in juvenile halls and camps in Los Angeles are not \nadequately safeguarded from coronavirus, nor provided \nmeaningful rehabilitative value.  \n \nDespite worldwide and nationwide measures to safeguard \npopulations against COVID-19, youth in confinement continue to report \nlack of measures to implement any such protections inside juvenile \nhalls and camps.  Social distancing, the “cornerstone of reducing \ntransmission of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19,”66 is reported \nto be non-existent at juvenile facilities; in some instances, youth have \nnot been instructed on the need to social distance at all, and in other \ninstances, youth have received guidance, but probation staff have failed \nto implement the practice.

(Ibid.)  At both juvenile halls, youth were \nplaying contact sports. (Kennedy Decl.; Gunsberg Decl.)  This was \nconfirmed personally by the Chief Probation Officer. (Yamashiro Decl.). \nAt the camps, youth report that they continue to sleep in open \ndormitory settings, with some 10 or more other youth.  Meanwhile, \nmost youth interviewed reported that no hygiene essentials, like soap, \nhand sanitizer or face masks, have been supplied to them. (Yamshiro \nDecl.; Kennedy Decl.; Gunsberg Decl.; Heimov Decl.)  Some youth \nreport having inconsistent access to hand sanitizer, gloves or masks, \nincluding based on favoritism.  At one juvenile hall at least, staff are \ninconsistently or not using masks and gloves at all. (Heimov Decl.)   \nAs juvenile facilities in Los Angeles struggle to implement social \ndistancing, the practice has resulted in isolation and lack of crucial \nrehabilitative programming. (Yamashiro Decl.; Kennedy Decl.; \nGunsberg Decl.; Heimov Decl.)  At all facilities, school, programs and \nfamily visitation have all halted upon the Probation Department’s \nrequest to and approval by the Board of State and Community \nCorrections on March 27, 2020 to suspend its compliance with title XV \nstate regulations through April 11; on April 8, those suspensions were \nextended through the end of April. (See BSCC Suspension.)  In place of \nschool instruction, youth receive packets to complete independently, \nwith no opportunity for feedback or guidance from teachers.  So far, \nthere has been no access to laptops or other technology to assist with \nlearning. (Kennedy Decl.)  All youth clients report being cut off from \nmental health services, including any telephonic counseling since the \nbeginning or middle of March. (Yamashiro Decl.; Kennedy Decl.; \nGunsberg Decl.; Heimov Decl.)  Several youth represented by CJLP \n32 \n \n\ndescribe suffering symptoms of illness but being unable to seek timely \nmedical treatment. (Kennedy Decl.)  At a time when familial support is \nmore crucial than ever for a youth’s mental well-being under WHO and \nCDC guidelines (Barnert Decl.; Harvey Decl.), family visitation has \nceased since March 13, and the ability to make once-a-week, short \nphone calls as a substitute has been provided, as well as withheld, as \nan incentive for good behavior. (Kennedy Decl.; Gunsberg Decl.)  For \nnon-verbal youth who have disabilities and cannot make phone calls, \nany form of contact with outside support has effectively ceased. \n(Gunsberg Decl.)  Youth have also reported being unable to access the \nsecure, confidential phone calls that are entitled to with their \nattorneys. (Kennedy Decl.)   \n More than a month into the crisis, Chief Ray Leyva explained on \nApril 13 that the department is now contemplating measures to \naddress the challenges in lack of productive activity and visitation, like \nextending the brief phone calls permitted for youth to connect with \ntheir families.67 \n* \nThe following documents are lodged herewith and incorporated \nby reference: \nExhibit A: Declaration of Dr. Elizabeth Barnert, MD, MPH, MS \nExhibit B: Declaration of Dr. Craig Haney, PhD \nExhibit C: Declaration of Cyn Yamashiro, Independent Juvenile \nDefender Program  \n \n \n67 Supra, note 60. \n33 \n \n\nExhibit D: Declaration of Sean Kennedy, Executive Director, \nCenter for Juvenile Law and Policy \nExhibit E: Declaration of Jerod Gunsberg, Esq. \nExhibit F: Declaration of Leslie Heimov, Executive Director, \nChildren’s Law Center \nExhibit G: Email Communications about BSCC Suspension  \n* \n  Petitioners have no other plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at \nlaw other than the relief sought in this petition.

My business address is: 634 South Spring Street, Suite \n500C, Los Angeles, CA 90014. \n  In that capacity I am the attorney of record for petitioner in the \nforegoing petition for writ of mandate and I make this verification on \nhis behalf for the reason that the facts alleged therein are more within \nmy knowledge than his. \n  I have read the foregoing petition and the exhibits attached \nthereto or lodged with this court, and I know the contents thereof to be \ntrue as based upon my representation of the petitioner in respondent \nsuperior court. \n  I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the state of \nCalifornia that the foregoing is true and correct. \n  Executed on this 14th day of April 2020, at Los Angeles, \nCalifornia. \n  ____________________ \nPATRICIA SOUNG \n              Counsel for Petitioners. \n   \n39 \n \n\nARGUMENT, POINTS AND AUTHORITIES \n \nI.  THIS COURT HAS PROPER JURISDICTION TO GRANT AN \nEXTRAORDINARY WRIT UNDER THE EXTRAORDINARY \nCIRCUMSTANCES FOR THE REQUESTED RELIEF. \n \nMandamus is an extraordinary remedy issuing to compel an \ninferior tribunal, body, or person to perform an act which the law \nspecially enjoins as a duty resulting from an office. (Code Civ. Proc., § \n1085; Harris Transportation Co. v. Air Resources Board (1995) 32 \nCal.App.4th 1472, 1481.)  A writ of mandate must be issued where \nthere is no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course \nof law. (Ibid.)  Ultimately, a decision to grant mandamus should \npromote justice. (Betty v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1941) \n18 Cal 2d 619, 622.)  The California Supreme Court has original \njurisdiction over extraordinary writs like mandamus (Cal. Const. art \nVI, §10; CCP § 1086.), but generally declines to exercise its discretion \nover a petition that was not filed initially in the superior court, unless \n“the matters to be decided are of sufficiently great importance and \nrequire immediate resolution.” (California Redevelopment Assn. v. \nMatosantos (2011) 53 Cal. 4th 231, 253.)  Certainly, the novel \ncoronavirus pandemic that has spread the world over, poses particular \nrisks to institutional settings and youth in confinement, and has \nalready infected six juvenile hall probation staff and resulted in the \nquarantine of at least 43 youth in those facilities in Los Angeles \nCounty, rise to this level of importance and urgency.  \nTo obtain mandamus,  petitioners must show: (1) “that the \nrespondent has failed to perform an act despite a clear, present and \nministerial duty to do so,” (2) “that the petitioner has a clear, present \n40 \n \n\nand beneficial right to that performance,” and (3) “that there is no other \nplain, speedy and adequate remedy.” (Riverside Sheriff’s Ass’n v. Cty. of \nRiverside (2003) 106 Cal. App. 4th 1285, 1289.)  In addition to enforcing \n“ministerial” duties, mandamus may be an appropriate vehicle to \ncorrect constitutional violations. (Edward W. v. Lamkins (2002) 99 Cal. \nApp. 4th 516, 529.)  Thus, the duty that mandamus seeks to enforce \nmay arise under statutory law, regulations, or the state or federal \nConstitution.  Here, petitioners seek mandamus to enforce the Los \nAngeles Superior Court’s duty to care for youth in confinement under \nthe federal and state constitution, as well as California statutes. \nCalifornia courts have long authorized “public interest standing” \nin mandamus.  As a general rule, a party must also be “beneficially \ninterested” to seek a writ of mandate. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1086; Save the \nPlastic Bag Coalition v. City v. Manhattan Beach (2011) 52 Cal.4th 155, \n166.)  Importantly, however, the beneficial interest requirement is \nrelaxed in cases that seek to enforce a “public right.”  “Where the \nquestion is one of public right and the object of the mandamus is to \nprocure enforcement of a public duty, the relator need not show that he \nhas any legal or special interest in the result, since it is sufficient that \nhe is interested as a citizen in having the laws executed and the duty in \nquestion enforced.” (Bd. of Social Welfare v. Los Angeles Cty. (1945) 27 \nCal. 2d 98, 100-01.)  “This ‘public right/public duty’ exception to the \nrequirement of beneficial interest for a writ of mandate promotes the \npolicy of guaranteeing citizens the opportunity to ensure that no \ngovernmental body impairs or defeats the purpose of legislation \nestablishing a public right . . . . We refer to this variety of standing as \n‘public interest standing.’” (Save the Plastic Bag, 52 Cal. 4th at 166.).  \n41 \n \n\nThe courts scrutinize claims of public interest standing brought \nby entities more closely than claims brought by individual citizens. (Id. \nat 170, n.5.)  “When a nonhuman entity claims the right to pursue a \ncitizen suit, the issue must be resolved in light of the particular \ncircumstances presented, including the strength of the nexus between \nthe artificial entity and human beings and the context in which the \ndispute arises.” (Id. at 167.)  This Court has directed courts confronted \nwith public interest standing to consider:  \nwhether the corporation has shown a continuous interest in or \ncommitment to the public right being asserted; whether it \nrepresents individuals who would be beneficially interested in the \naction; whether individuals who are beneficially interested would \nfind it difficult or impossible to seek vindication of their own \nrights; and whether prosecution of the action as a citizen suit by \na corporation would conflict with other legislative bodies. \n(Ibid.)  Where the mandamus petitioner is a “nonprofit public benefit \ncorporation,” a claim of public interest standing is stronger than one by \na commercial enterprise. (See Rialto Citizens for Responsible Growth v. \nCity of Rialto (2012) 208 Cal. App. 4th 899, 915.)  \nBecause CJLP and IJDP attorneys represent youth in \ndelinquency proceedings and are deeply involved in all aspects of \njuvenile justice, the nonprofit entities have a continuous interest in and \ncommitment to upholding the constitutional and statutory rights \nasserted on behalf of their clients and similarly situated youth in \njuvenile halls and camps in Los Angeles.  The entities’ status as \nnonprofits further buttress their claim of public interest standing.  \nFinally, the ability of each youth in confinement to seek vindication of \ntheir own rights is challenged by the fact of their detention and the \ncompromised capacity of and access to courts during the pandemic. \n(Yamshiro Decl.; Kennedy Decl.; Gunsberg Decl.)  \n42 \n \n\nIf the subject matter of the mandamus action is important to \npublic policy or the community at large, the claim of public interest \nstanding will be better received than if the subject matter is more \nlimited. (See McDonald v. Stockton Met. Transit Dist. (1973) 36 Cal. \nApp. 3d 436, 440 (“When the duty is sharp and the public need weighty, \nthe court will grand a mandamus at the behest of an applicant who \nshows no greater personal interest than that of a citizen who wants the \nlaw enforced.  When the public need is less pointed, the courts hold the \npetitioner to a sharper showing of personal need.”).)  Several cases have \nused this rationale to authorize public interest standing for an \nindividual or nonprofit seeking to protect a class of disadvantaged \npeople from lack of government action or improper government actions. \n(See, e.g., Brown v. Crandall (2011) 198 Cal.App. 4th 1, 13-14 (plaintiff \n“seeking to enforce a public duty to provide a safety net health care to \nindigents” qualified for public interest standing); Common Cause v. Bd. \nof Supervisors (1989) 49 Cal. 3d 432, 439-40 (individual and nonprofits \nconcerned with voting rights qualified for public interest standing to \nprosecute mandamus action forcing county to institute taxpayer \noutreach program for low-income residents); Green v. Obledo (1981) 29 \nCal. 3d 126, 144-45 (individual qualified for public interest standing to \nprosecute mandamus action forcing county to properly calculate welfare \nbenefits for poor families).) In Wells v. Municipal Court (1981) 126 \nCal.App.3d 808, however, the appellate court precluded the Sacramento \nCounty Public Defender from filing a challenge to sentencing guidelines \nissued by the county for use in prosecution and drunk driving cases. \nThere, the court objected to the petition being filed on behalf of all \npotential defendants (id., at p. 811), and the questioned practice not \n43 \n \n\nrising to the level of a violation of a constitutional or statutory right. \n(Id., at p. 812.) \nThe mandamus action here concerns the alleged failure of the \ndelinquency courts to attend to the safety of youth in custody during a \npandemic through more swiftly and substantially depopulating juvenile \ninstitutions, ensuring adequate access to justice and implementing \ncritical public health measures – a failure that certainly rises to the \nlevel of a “weighty” public concern.  Unlike in Wells, the challenge here \nalleges violations of both constitutional and statutory rights; moreover \nthe petition is brought on behalf of actual youth in custody, not \npotential individuals. \nGiven the magnitude of this crisis and the lack of more sweeping, \nsufficient protections of youth in custody in Los Angeles, petitioners \nhave no other timely and adequate remedy other than mandamus.  \nThus, the Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to prevent \nunjust, irreparable harm to youth whose constitutional and statutory \nrights, and ultimately their very safety and health, petitioners are \nfirmly committed to upholding.  Mandamus is the proper vehicle here \nto “ultimately promote justice.” (Betty, Cal 2d at p. 622.) \n \nII.  THIS COURT SHOULD EXERCISE ITS PLENARY AND \nSUPERVISORY JURISDICTION TO EXPEDITIOUSLY \nGRANT RELIEF TO RELEASE AND SAFEGUARD EVERY \nYOUTH POSSIBLE IN JUVENILE HALLS AND CAMPS. \n \nYouth are entitled to special care and greater leniency under \nconstitutional and state laws, and such is true when considering the \nexceptional practice of removing them from their homes, and all the \ntruer in today’s state of emergency.  Ultimately, the failure to protect \n44 \n \n\nchildren in confinement from a likely outbreak of COVID-19 constitutes \na violation of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and the \nCalifornia Constitution (Art. I, § 7 subd. (a)), as well as a violation of \nthe very purpose of and duties of the juvenile court system. \n \nA. The Juvenile Justice System Must Treat Children in its \nCustody with Special Care and Greater Leniency, Because \nChildren are Developmentally and Constitutionally \nDifferent. \n \nThroughout United States Supreme Court jurisprudence, it is \nfirmly established that children are developmentally different and \n“have a very special place in life which law should reflect.” (May v. \nAnderson (1953) 345 U.S. 528, 536 (Frankfurter, J., concurring); see \nalso J.D.B. v. North Carolina (2011) 564 U.S. 261, 274 (“‘[O]ur history \nis replete with laws and judicial recognition’ that children cannot be \nviewed simply as miniature adults.”) (quoting Eddings v. Oklahoma \n(1982) 455 U.S. 104, 115-16); Miller v. Alabama (2012) 132 S. Ct. 2455, \n2464 [citing Roper v. Simmons (2005) 543 U.S. 551, 569]; see also \nGraham v. Florida (2010) 130 S. Ct. 2011, 2026.) A child’s age is far \n“more than a chronological fact.” (See Roper, 543 U.S. at p. 569; \nEddings, 455 U.S. at p. 115.)  It is a fact that “generates commonsense \nconclusions about behavior and perception.” (Yarborough v. Alvarado \n(2004) 541 U.S. 652, 674 (BREYER, J., dissenting).)  Given the \nhallmark features of youthfulness, our courts and laws have thus \nreflected a long-standing commitment to considering the status of \nchildren when construing their rights under the Constitution. (Miller, \nsupra, 132 S. Ct. at p. 2464.)  \n45 \n \n\nIndeed, the very premise of and treatment of children in the \njuvenile justice system is that they are categorically less mature and \nresponsible than adults, and should be treated with special care and \ngreater leniency. (Eddings, 455 U.S. at pp. 115-116.)  For children in \nstate custody, this principle takes on heightened importance. Our laws \ndo not consider children to have been “convicted” of crimes, and the \npurpose for institutional confinement of children emphasizes \nrehabilitation rather than punishment, in contrast to the incarceration \nof adults. (See Alexander S. v. Boyd (D.S.C. 1995) 876 F. Supp. 773, \n782, aff’d in part and rev’d in part on other grounds, 113 F.3d 1373 (4th \nCir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 880 (1998).  Where children are \ninvoluntarily removed from the custody of their parents and frequently \npresent complex histories and needs, the State assumes a duty to \nprovide for their care, safety and well-being. (See Youngberg v. Romeo \n(1982) 457 U.S. 307, 317 (“When a person is institutionalized—and \nwholly dependent on the State[,]…a duty to provide certain services \nand care does exist.”).) \nB. A Failure to Protect Children From a Likely Outbreak of \nCOVID-19 In Confinement Constitutes a Violation of Due \nProcess Under The Fourteenth Amendment and the \nCalifornia Constitution (Art. I, § 7 Subd. (a)). \n \n  Conditions of confinement that pose an unreasonable risk of \nfuture harm to adult prisoners violate the constitutional \nprotections of the Eighth Amendment. (See Helling v. McKinney \n(1993) 509 U.S. 25, 33 (“That the Eighth Amendment protects \nagainst future harm to inmates is not a novel proposition”) In \nHelling, a plaintiff alleged that he was assigned to a cell with \n46 \n \n\nanother inmate who smoked five packs of cigarettes per day. (Id. \nat p. 28.) Even though the plaintiff had not yet suffered harm, the \nSupreme Court found that the plaintiff stated “a cause of action \nunder the Eighth Amendment by alleging that petitioners have, \nwith deliberate indifference, exposed him to levels of \n[environmental tobacco smoke] that pose an unreasonable risk of \nserious damage to his future health.” (Id. at p. 35.) \n  The Eighth Amendment requires that “inmates be furnished \nwith the basic human needs, one of which is ‘reasonable safety.’” \n(Helling, 509 U.S. at p. 33.)  It requires that “inmates be furnished \nwith . . . reasonable safety,” and the Supreme Court has explicitly \nrecognized that the risk of contracting “serious contagious \ndiseases” may constitute such an “unsafe, life-threatening \ncondition” that it threatens “reasonable safety.” (Id., at pp. 33-34 \n(internal quotations omitted); see also Hutto v. Finney (1978) 437 \nU.S. 678, 682-685 (recognizing the need for a remedy where \nprisoners were crowded into cells and some had infectious \ndiseases).  Any suggestion that future harm—harm that has yet to \nhappen—is not cognizable under the Eighth Amendment has been \ndisavowed: where unsafe, life-threatening conditions exist, the \nSupreme Court has been clear that it will not wait for serious \nmedical problems or symptoms to arrive before it intervenes. \n(Helling, 509 U.S. at p. 33 (“We have great difficulty agreeing that \nprison authorities…may ignore a condition of confinement that is \nsure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering \n47 \n \n\nthe next week or month or year.”); Hutto, 437 U.S. at 682 (Finding \nan Eighth Amendment violation despite the fact that likely \ninfection may not occur immediately and may not affect all of \nthose exposed did not matter); Parsons v. Ryan (9th Cir. 2014) 754 \nF.3d 657, 678 (“[A]lthough a presently existing risk may \nultimately result in different future harm for different inmates—\nranging from no harm at all to death—every inmate suffers \nexactly the same constitutional injury when he is exposed to a… \npolicy or practice that creates a substantial risk of serious \nharm.”).) \n  Courts have found claims of future harms cognizable under \nthe Eighth Amendment that involved risks posed by contaminated \nwater (Carroll v. DeTella (7th Cir. 2001) 255 F.3d 470, 472), use of \nchemical toilets (Masonoff v. DuBois (D. Mass. 1995) 899 F. Supp. \n782, 797), paint toxins (Crawford v. Coughlin (W.D.N.Y. 1999) 43 \nF. Supp. 2d 319, 325), asbestos (Wallis v. Baldwin (9th Cir. 1995) \n70 F.3d 1074, 1076-77), and substandard fire prevention. \n(Hoptowit v. Spellman (9th Cir. 1985) 753, F.2d 779.)  In cases like \nthat of petitioners, courts have also found valid Eighth \nAmendment claims involving contagious disease in carceral \nenvironments.  Relying on Helling, courts recognized as valid \nclaims based on relatively high risk of contracting Valley Fever in \nCalifornia prisons. (Allen v. Kramer (E.D. Cal., 2016) 2016 WL \n4613360, at *1, 11.)   \n48 \n \n\nAs discussed below, if risks posed by secondhand smoke, \ncontaminated water, use of chemical toilets, paint toxins, or Valley \nFever constitute an “unsafe, life-threatening condition” that \nthreatens “reasonable safety” of adults in a carceral setting, \nyouth’s continued confinement in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, \nwhich poses dire health risks and has killed thousands of people \nin this country and around the world, would certainly constitute \nan unreasonable risk of future harm violating the constitutional \nprotections of the Eighth Amendment and the California \nConstitution.  Under no uncertain terms, history and the present-\nday crisis have underscored that institutional settings are at \nparticular risk of exposure and spread of contagion; already, one-\nquarter of individuals who have died in Los Angeles County to \ncoronavirus lived in institutional settings. \n  Though the Eighth Amendment sets the standard for adult \nprisoners, the majority of courts have determined that the \nstandard to which conditions of youth confinement are subject \nimplicates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \ninstead.68  (Gary H. v. Hegstrom (9th Cir. 1987) 831 F.2d 1430, \n1432; H.C. ex rel. Hewett v. Jarard (11th Cir. 1986) 786 F.2d 1080, \n1084-1085; Milonas v. Williams (10th Cir. 1982) 691 F.2d 931, \n \n \n68   The Supreme Court has not announced the appropriate federal \nstandards by which to judge state juvenile detention facility conditions. \n(See Ingraham v. Wright (1977) 430 U.S. 651, 669 n. 37 (expressly \nreserving the question whether the cruel and unusual punishments \nclause applies to juvenile institutions). \n49 \n \n\n942; Alexander S., 876 F. Supp. at p. 773; Santana v. Collazo (1st \nCir. 1983) 714 F.2d 1172, 1179.)  This is so because children are \nnot subject to “punishment,” as the word is used in the Eighth \nAmendment.  The due process clause implicitly incorporates the \ncruel and unusual punishments clause standards as a \nconstitutional minimum.  (Gary H., supra, 831 F.2d at p. 1432.)  \nWhether confined pre- or post-adjudication, children thus have a \nright to care and treatment under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n(Youngberg, 457 U.S. at p. 317 (“When a person is \ninstitutionalized—and wholly dependent on the State[,] . . . a duty \nto provide certain services and care does exist.”).   \n  It is beyond dispute that the State has a heightened duty to \nany pre-trial detainee, child or adult. In Bell v. Wolfish (1979) 441 \nU.S. 520, the U.S. Supreme Court held that because they have not \nbeen “convicted of any crimes,” pre-trial detainees cannot be \nsubjected to conditions that “amount to punishment.” (Id., at p. \n541, see also Kingsley v. Hendrickson (2015) 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2473-\n2474 (clarifying that the Fourteenth Amendment excessive force \nstandard applicable to pre-trial detainees is more protective than \nthe Eighth Amendment standard); Youngberg, supra, 457 U.S. at \npp. 321–322 (clarifying that involuntarily committed individuals \n“are entitled to more considerate treatment and conditions of \nconfinement” than individuals post-conviction whose conditions of \nconfinement are “designed to punish”).  “[A]s a general matter, the \ndue process standard applied to juvenile pretrial detainees should \n50 \n \n\nbe more liberally construed than that applied to adult detainees.”  \n(A.J. ex rel. L.B. v. Kierst (8th Cir. 1995) 56 F.3d 849, 854.) \n  Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s reasoning in Youngberg \nand Bell, courts throughout the nation have concluded that the \nFourteenth Amendment also provides heightened protections to \nyouth held post-adjudication.  Like pre-trial detainees and \ninvoluntarily committed patients, youth in state custody due to a \ndelinquency adjudication are not confined for punitive purposes. \n(See, e.g., Vann v. Scott (7th Cir. 1972) 467 F.2d 1235, 1239 \n(applying the Fourteenth Amendment because the purpose of the \n“delinquent” classification is “to afford the State an adequate \nopportunity to rehabilitate and safeguard delinquent minors \nrather than to punish them”); see also A.J., supra, 56 F.3d at p. \n854; Gary H., supra, 831 F.2d at pp. 1431–1432; H.C. ex rel. \nHewett, 786 F.2d at pp. 1084–85; Alexander S., 876 F. Supp. at pp. \n795–796.)  Accordingly, confinement of children, whether pre- or \npost-adjudication, in conditions that “amount to punishment” \n(Bell, 441 U.S. at p. 535), or in conditions that represent a \nsubstantial departure from accepted professional judgment violate \nthe Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause. (Youngberg, 457 \nU.S. at pp. 321-322.) Conditions or restrictions of children in \nconfinement that are not reasonably related to a legitimate \ngovernmental objective amount to punishment. (Bell, 441 U.S. at \npp. 538-539.)   \n51 \n \n\n  In sum, under the Fourteenth Amendment, all youth in \ncustody must be protected from punishment and known risks of \nharm.  (See, e.g., Natale v. Camden Cty. Corr. Facility (3d Cir. \n2003) 318 F.3d 575, 581 (“the Fourteenth Amendment affords \npretrial detainees protections ‘at least as great as the Eighth \nAmendment protections available to a convicted prisoner’”) \n(quoting City of Revere v. Mass. Gen. Hosp. (1983) 463 U.S. 239, \n244; Helling, supra, 509 U.S. at p. 33 (the State violates the \nEighth Amendment when it crowds prisoners into cells with \nothers who have “infectious maladies”) (citing Hutto, supra, 437 \nU.S. at p. 682.)  Among the additional guarantees to children \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment is a right to treatment and \nrehabilitation. (See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at pp. 321–322; Nelson v. \nHeyne (7th Cir. 1974) 491 F.2d 352, 360 (children have a right to \n“rehabilitative treatment” because the State has assumed the role \nof the parent and such treatment must be “what proper parental \ncare would provide”); see also C.P.X. v. Garcia, No. 4:17-cv-00417 \n(S.D. Iowa Mar. 30, 2020), Trial Order (holding that juvenile \nfacility’s failure to provide appropriate mental health care violates \nchildren’s substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth \nAmendment).   \n  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, the failure to protect \nyouth from a likely outbreak of COVID-19 in confinement \ncertainly constitutes a violation of due process.  On one hand, the \nlack of sufficient and speedy compliance in Los Angeles with CDC \n52 \n \n\nprotocols on COVID-19 flouts constitutional protections by \nexposing youth to serious risk of known harms. (Yamashiro Decl.; \nKennedy Decl.; Gunsberg Decl.; Heimov Decl.).  On the other, \nsome measure of compliance has resulted in depriving youth of \neducation, programming, visitation and mental health counseling \n(ibid.), as well as forms of isolation known to cause long-term \npsychological harm. (Barnert Decl.; Haney Decl.)  In the current \natmosphere of anxiety and harms related to COVID-19, the \nabsence of robust and productive activity for youth, or adequate \nconnection to their families, negates any, already dubious \nrehabilitative value of juvenile halls and camps; their continued \ndetention under the circumstances thus amounts to punishment \nin violation of the federal and state constitutions.    \n \nC. A Failure to Protect Children From A Likely Outbreak Of \nCOVID-19 In Confinement Also Violates The Very Purpose \nof and Duties under Juvenile Court Law \n \nUnder California law, Welfare and Institutions Code § 202 \nbroadly sets forth the general purposes of juvenile law to serve the \nyouth’s best interests by providing care, treatment and guidance to \nrehabilitate, as well as to guard the public’s safety. (In re Michael R. \n(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 327, 333-334.)  Juvenile Court Law is designed to \nrehabilitate and treat, not punish. (Ibid.)  Thus, state statutes and \nregulations governing juvenile delinquency proceedings as well as \nfacility conditions are replete with additional protections ensuring \nyouth’s right to adequate treatment and rehabilitation.  One \nfundamental protection is the strong presumption against and sparing \n53 \n \n\nuse of detention and incarceration. (See, e.g., WIC § 202(a) (“removing \nthe minor from the custody of his or her parents only when necessary \nfor his or her welfare or for the safety and protection of the public”; \nWIC § 626 (“In determining which disposition of the minor to make, the \nofficer shall prefer the alternative which least restricts the minor's \nfreedom of movement…”); WIC § 636 (Upon detaining a youth, the \ncourt shall order the probation officer to “provide services as soon as \npossible to enable the minor’s parent or legal guardian to obtain any \nassistance as may be needed to enable the parent or guardian to \neffectively provide the care and control necessary for the minor to \nreturn to the home.”).) \nWhere a youth is removed from home, state law requires that \ncustodial settings resemble as closely as possible a homelike \nenvironment, in keeping with the primary rehabilitative aim of the \njuvenile justice system. (See WIC § 202(a) (“If the minor is removed \nfrom his or her own family, it is the purpose of this chapter to secure \nfor the minor custody, care, and discipline as nearly as possible \nequivalent to that which should have been given by his or her \nparents.”); WIC § 851 (Juvenile hall…shall not be deemed to be, nor be \ntreated as, a penal institution. It shall be a safe and supportive \nhomelike environment.”).)  To further ensure that conditions and \ntreatment within confinement facilitate rehabilitation, California \nstatutes assign responsibility of oversight to various local and state \nbodies. (See WIC § 210 (requiring the Board of State and Community \nCorrections to adopt minimum standards for juvenile facilities); WIC § \n209 (a)(1) (“The judge of the juvenile court of a county, or, if there is \nmore than one judge, any of the judges of the juvenile court shall, at \n54 \n \n\nleast annually, inspect any jail, juvenile hall, or special purpose \njuvenile hall.”); WIC § 229 (requiring juvenile justice commissions “to \ninquire into the administration of the juvenile court law in the county \nor region in which the commission serves” and granting such \ncommissions to have access to and inspect all publicly administered \ninstitutions at least once a year). \n  Under ordinary circumstances, Judicial Council reminded courts \nof these statutory obligations – that detention and incarceration in \njuvenile halls and camps should be “an exceptional practice, rather \nthan the rule” in a rehabilitation-focused system.69  Even as the court \nsystem across Los Angeles County has scaled down immensely, swifter, \nsweeping efforts to reduce jail populations by nearly four thousand70 \nstand in sharp contrast to the lack of due speed and global approaches \non the juvenile side.  Instead, the Juvenile Court has continued to \nadhere strictly to case-by-case review through challenged operations, \nincluding lack of notice, lack of hearings, delays and confusion. \n(Yamshiro Decl.; Kennedy Decl.; Gunsberg Decl.)  In sum, efforts in Los \nAngeles County to release and safeguard every youth possible in \njuvenile halls and camps in the face of the pandemic have been \nincongruent with constitutionally adequate standards of care, the \n \n \n69 Emergency Rule 7, Advisory Committee Comment, Judicial Council \n(Apr. 6. 2020). \n70 Alene Tchekmedyian, A member of the nursing staff at L.A.

ELIZABETH S. BARNERT, MD, MPH, MS \nI, Elizabeth S. Barnert, declare as follows: \n1. I am a pediatrician and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at David Geffen\nSchool of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where\nI engage in research on the link between juvenile justice and health. I am\na part of the UC Criminal Justice & Health Consortium – a collaborative\neffort of researchers, experts and advocates from across the University of\nCalifornia system working to bring evidence-based health and healthcare\nsolutions to criminal justice reform in California and nationwide.\n2. I also have served as a consultant to numerous governmental and non-\ngovernmental organizations on issues related to juvenile justice. My\nresearch examining youth justice and health, funded by the National\nInstitutes of Health, has been published in top tier academic journals. I\nhave advised the United States Congress, the California legislature, the\nCalifornia Governor’s office, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors,\nand the Los Angeles Mayor’s Office on juvenile justice policy. I am a\nmember of the Juvenile Health Committee of the National Commission of\nCorrectional Health Care. I am also a practicing pediatrician and provide\nclinical care in a Los Angeles County juvenile hall setting. My research,\nwriting, and testimony have been referenced by the California Legislature\nand the California Governor’s Office.\n1\n3. COVID-19 is a serious, highly contagious disease and pandemic.  Under\n2\ncertain, extreme conditions, a single person can infect hundreds or\nthousands of community members.  Thus, time is of the essence to contain\n3\nthe spread of this infection. Across the world and country, COVID-19 has\nquickly and exponentially caused harm and death. Over 1.14 million\npeople around the world have received confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19\n For example, see  Barnert et al.

At \n4 5\nleast 85,586 people have died globally as a result of COVID-19 as of April \n9, 2020,  including 12,754 in the United States.  These numbers have \n6 7\nrapidly increased exponentially and are predicted by health officials to \ncontinue to increase. The CDC has estimated that as many as 214 million \npeople may eventually be infected in the United States, and that as many \nas 21 million could require hospitalization.  \n8\n4. The COVID-19 Pandemic poses such a threat to public health and safety,\nthat President Trump declared a national state of emergency on March\n13.  On March 4, 2020, Governor Gavin Newsom declared a statewide\n9\nState of Emergency, and on March 19, 2020, he ordered all California\nresidents to stay home or at their place of residence except to facilitate\ncertain authorized necessary activities.  His office estimated that, in the\n10\nabsence of taking appropriate steps to mitigate the spread of the virus, as\nmany as 56 percent of all Californians will contract it.\n11\n5. The outbreak of COVID-19 has already reached incarcerated populations.\nIn New York City’s Rikers Island jail complex, at least 19 incarcerated\npeople and 12 staff members had contracted COVID-19 as of March 22.12\nJust eight days later by March 31, the jail’s chief physician reported\nnearly 200 confirmed cases of coronavirus and described the spread as a\n“public health disaster unfolding before our eyes.”\n13\n https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 \n4\n https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html \n5\n https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 \n6\n https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html \n7\n https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/coronavirus-deaths-estimate.html \n8\n https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/donald-trump-emergency/index.html \n9\n https://covid19.ca.gov/img/Executive-Order-N-33-20.pdf \n10\n Office of the Governor, “Letter to President Donald Trump” (March 18, 2020), \n11\navailable at https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.18.20-Letter-\nUSNS-Mercy-Hospital-Ship.pdf. \n https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/488855-top-official-says-new-york-city-\n12\ncoronavirus-jail-outbreak-is-a-crisis \n https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/rikers-island-jail-coronavirus-\n13\npublic-health-disaster \n2 \n60\n\n6. On March 22, a Los Angeles County facility reported the first identified\ncase of an incarcerated person testing positive for COVID-19 in\nCalifornia.  Two days later, neighboring Orange County reported its first\n14\nconfirmed case of an incarcerated person contracting COVID-19 in Men’s\nCentral Jail in Santa Ana.  On April 1, Los Angeles County reported its\n15\nfirst positive case of coronavirus of a probation officer who works at\nSylmar juvenile hall,   and the quarantine of 21 youth at that facility,\n16\nand April 6, it reported the second positive case of an officer at the same\nfacility.\n17\n7. Children and adolescents are at risk of severe disease and death. They are\nno less immune to COVID-19. Indeed, the first fatality of a person under\n18 in the U.S. from COVID-19 occurred in Los Angeles County on March\n24.  Additionally, young people with underlying medical conditions have\n18\na higher susceptibility to COVID-19, of particular concern because youth\nin the juvenile justice system are known to have disproportionate medical\nmorbidity compared to same-age peers.\n19\n8. COVID-19 is a novel virus. There is no vaccine available for COVID-19,\nand there is no cure for COVID-19. Except for the individuals fortunate to\nhave survived COVID-19, no one has immunity, making the population\nvulnerable to ongoing outbreak. Currently, the most effective ways to\ncontrol the virus are to use preventive strategies, including social\ndistancing, and to dedicate our healthcare capacity for a manageable\n https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/22/coronavirus-california-state-prison-\n14\ninmate-positive-for-covid-19/  \n https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-24/orange-county-jail-inmate-\n15\ntests-positive-for-the-coronavirus  \n https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-01/l-a-county-juvenile-hall-\n16\nemployee-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-21-juveniles-now-on-quarantine.  \n Los Angeles County Probation Officer, Electronic Public Announcement, “Second \n17\nLos Angeles County Probation Employee Tests Positive for COVID-19 at Barry J. \nNidorf” (April 6, 2020). \n https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-24/los-angeles-young-person-\n18\ncoronavirus-death  \n American Academy of Pediatrics.

Otherwise overwhelming the supply of healthcare will \ncertainly continue to exacerbate the pandemic. \n9. Although juvenile justice facilities are a contained space, physical and\nlogistical challenge create significant barriers to carrying out infection\ncontrol processes necessary to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. In\naddition, arrival of new youth detainees, essential movement of residents,\nand the daily ingress and egress of the correctional workforce create\nportals for infection entry – as well as exit to the community. Thus, penal\ninstitutions are at high risk of COVID-19 outbreaks and of creating\nspread to the community.\n20\n10. Furthermore, juvenile facilities lack the operational capacity to address\nthe needs of youth in custody in this magnitude of crisis. They are ill-\nequipped to provide youth with ready access to cleaning and sanitation\nsupplies, or to assure that staff sanitize all surfaces during the day. Most\nlack the capacity to provide anything more than bare bones emergency\nmental or physical health care, and the demand for such services in this\ncrisis will grow. In addition, juvenile facilities typically have very limited\nprovisions for providing telephonic or other forms of remote visiting to\nyouth – measures that are critically important to their health and\nrehabilitation if contact visiting is limited. The curtailing of education to\nhomework packets in place of in-person or virtual instruction further\ncompromises the ability to sustain or promote the well-being of children in\nconfinement.\n11. Moreover, juvenile detention facilities are already extremely stressful\nenvironments for children confined to them.  They can be psychologically\nand medically harmful in their own right, leaving formerly incarcerated\npersons with higher rates of certain kinds of psychiatric and medical\nproblems.  Incarceration leads to higher rates of morbidity (illness rates)\nand mortality (i.e., it lowers the age at which people die).\n12. Penal settings also have limited options to implement the social distance\nthat is now required in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is very\nlikely that many of them will resort to the use of solitary confinement.\nAdolescents may have difficulty complying and because of fear of being\nplaced in solitary confinement if ill or suspected to be ill, they may under-\nreport symptoms. Further, solitary confinement subjects adults and\n https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200324.784502/full/ \n20\n4 \n62\n\nchildren alike to serious mental and physical harm,  so that professional \n21\nmental and physical health-related, legal, human rights, and even \ncorrectional organizations have called for severe limitations on the degree \nto which solitary confinement is employed.  \n22\n13. In addition to the traumatic effects of incarceration itself for children,\n23\nand the added trauma produced by harsh conditions of juvenile\nconfinement (such as solitary confinement), it is important to recognize\nthat most incarcerated children have already experienced numerous\nchildhood traumas, “risk factors,” or what have been called “adverse\nchildhood experiences.”  Thus, juvenile incarceration represents a form of\n24\n“retraumatization” for many of them, one that can be exacerbated by\nplacement in solitary confinement. It is hard to imagine a more vulnerable\npopulation whose very significant needs should be treated with the utmost\nsensitivity in the face of this Pandemic.\n14. In addition to the threats that the COVID-19 Pandemic presents to the\nphysical health of all individuals, the United States Center for Disease\n These many studies have been carefully reviewed in a number of publications. \n21\nFor example, see: K.

To mitigate the \n25\nstressors created by the COVID-19 Pandemic, both agencies recommend \npractices by parents and other caregivers to support the mental health of \ntheir children, all of which are currently challenged or made impossible in \njuvenile detention facilities.   \n 26\n \n15.  In summary, COVID-19 has reached crisis proportions around the globe. \nOn an individual level, it is itself a traumatic event, especially for \nchildren, trying to comprehend its magnitude and implications, and to feel \nsafe in an otherwise suddenly unsafe-feeling world.  \n \n16.  I submit this declaration to explain how the continued confinement of \nchildren during the COVID-19 outbreak poses a grave threat to their \nphysical and mental health, as well as a threat to juvenile justice systems \nstaff, the healthcare system’s capacity and thus the overall community. In \nlight of the above, it is my professional opinion that releasing as many \nincarcerated children as possible – and as quickly and safely as possible – \nto their families, where they can receive the support that the CDC and \nWHO recommend, is the best possible course of action for children, their \nfamilies and the broader community in response to the COVID-19 \npandemic. This is a time-sensitive matter. As described above, multiple \ncorrectional settings around the country are experiencing COVID-19 \noutbreaks and deaths.  \n27\n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \nExecuted on April 9, 2020 at Los Angeles, California.  \n            \n          DR.

(“IJDP”). \n3)(cid:1) IJDP was established and funded by the Los Angeles County Board of \nSupervisors (the “Board”) to oversee and administer a panel of independent \ncontractors to represent indigent minors (“Minors’) against whom a petition \npursuant to Welfare & Institutions Code, § 602 is filed, when both the Public \nDefender (“PD”) and the Alternate Public Defender (“APD”) are unavailable.    \nIJDP panel attorneys are vetted by IJDP, trained and supported by IJDP \nresources, and supervised by IJDP to ensure that Minors are receiving \ncompetent representation, consistent with best practices for juvenile delinquency \npractice.  In addition, IJDP provides direct representation in matters involving \npre-trial writs, resource advocacy, investigations and forensic social work where \ncalled upon by members of the IJDP panel. This declaration is provided \npursuant Welfare and Institutions Code section 634.3(a)(3) and California Rules \nof Court 5.663(c) mandating post-disposition representation and advocacy. \n4)(cid:1) As of April 14, 2020, IJDP attorneys represent multiple youth serving sentences \nin the Los Angeles County Probation Camp Community Placements and youth \nawaiting trial, disposition or placement in the Los Angeles County Probation \nJuvenile Halls.  \n5)(cid:1) On March 17, 2020 in my capacity as directing attorney for IJDP, I requested a \nmeeting with the supervising judge of the Los Angeles County juvenile \ndelinquency court, the District Attorney, the Public Defender and Alternate \nPublic Defender and Probation Department in order to implement a systematic \nreview of youth in custody in order to facilitate release, where appropriate, \nconsistent with the basic model utilized by the Sheriff for adult defendants in \nthe Los Angeles County Jail. At that meeting and every subsequent meeting, the \ncourt has refused to take a global review of the youth in custody and instead, has \n77\n\ninsisted all court partners to engage in a case by case, individualized review \nadhering to the same analytical framework employed prior to the COVID-19 \noutbreak.  \n6)(cid:1) In my capacity as directing attorney for IJDP, I have learned the following facts \nregarding the manner in which the Los Angeles County Superior Court and the \nLos Angeles County Probation Department have reacted to the outbreak of the \nCOVID-19 virus in Los Angeles County.  \na)(cid:1) Court Actions: \ni)(cid:1) On March 17, 2020, Presiding Judge Kevin Brazile declared a court \nholiday, closing all courts, including the Juvenile Court for March 17th, \n18th, 19th, in response to the Corvid-19 pandemic (“Pandemic”).  Juvenile \nCourts re-opened at a greatly reduced capacity on March 20, 2020. \nii)(cid:1) On March 13, 2020, in response to the Covid-19 Pandemic, Presiding \nJudge Kevin Brazile of the Los Angeles Superior Court announced \nrecommendations to all judges and commissioners of the Superior Court, \neffective March 16, 2020, that (1) All new civil jury trials should be \ncontinued for at least 30 days and all preference jury trials should be \ncontinued for at least 15 days; (2) All criminal jury trials, where statutory \ntime had been waived should be continued for at least 30 days; and (3) \nLimit new jury panels  within the next 30 days due to concerns about \njuror availability.  The same day, Presiding Judge Brazile made a request \nthe Chief Justice for an emergency order permitting closure of the courts.   \niii)(cid:1)On March 15, 2020, Presiding Judge Brazile announced in a news release \nthat, “the Court will begin scaling down operations tomorrow to achieve \nsocial distancing in all 38 courthouses.  Additional public protection \nmeasures will be evaluated and announced tomorrow of Tuesday.”     \niv)(cid:1)On March 16, 2020, after receiving authorization from the Supreme Court \nto do so, Presiding Brazile declared a court holiday, closing all courts, \nincluding the Juvenile Court for March 17th, 18th, 19th, in response to the \nCorvid-19 pandemic.   \n78\n\nv)(cid:1) On March17, 2020, Presiding Judge Brazile issued an implementation \norder to continue all non-emergency matters for 30 days.   \nvi)(cid:1)On March 18, 2020, Presiding Judge Brazile ordered the continuance of \nall traffic infractions and non-traffic infraction trials and arraignments for \nat least 30 days.   \nvii)On March 19, 2020, Presiding Judge Brazile ordered the courts to re-open \nfor essential and emergency functions.   \nviii)(cid:1) On March 20, 2020, the Superior Court announced that all clerk’s \noffices would be closed to the public, as the clerk’s office transitioned to \ntelephonic and remote solutions.   \nix)(cid:1)On March 22, 2020, Presiding Judge Brazile ordered the closure of the \nSylmar courthouse for three days after positive Covid-19 exposure.  \nx)(cid:1) On March 23, 2020, Presiding Judge Brazile issued an order that only \nauthorized persons may enter the courthouse.   \nxi)(cid:1)On March 23, 2020, the Superior Court announced that a dependency \njudge was under a 14-day quarantine.   \nxii)On March 24, 2020, the Superior Court ordered release of some adult \ncounty jail inmates awaiting trial, after reaching agreement with justice \npartners.   \nxiii)(cid:1) On April 2, 2020, Presiding Judge Brazile ordered deadlines extended \nfor arraignments, preliminary hearings and trials.   \nxiv)(cid:1) On April 9, 2020, Presiding Judge Brazile announced that all essential \ndependency hearings would be held remotely.   \nxv)(cid:1)On April 10, 2020, Presiding Judge Brazile announced immediate \ntemporary relief for all traffic and non-traffic infraction defendants for 90 \ndays.     \nxvi)(cid:1) On April 10, 2020, the Honorable Victor H. Greenburg, Presiding \nJudge of the Juvenile Division, notified the juvenile delinquency bar, by \nemail, that, “[l]imited operations policies presently in place for the Superior \nCourt have been extended until June 22, 2020.  The court plans to reopen on \n79\n\nJune 22.  Cases classified as Non-Essential which are calendared prior to June \n22 will be continued until after our reopening.  Due to social distancing \nrequirements, as well as the backlog of cases, we will not be able to hear \nall juvenile case immediately following that date.”   \nxvii)(cid:1) On April 13, 2020, the Superior Court announced it was continuing to \nwork with justice partners on jail release of adults in response to the \npandemic. \nb)(cid:1) Conditions of confinement: \ni)(cid:1) Multiple Los Angeles County Probation Department employees who work \nwith youth in the Juvenile Halls have tested positive for COVID-19 and \nmultiple youth have been quarantined as a result of the exposure. \nii)(cid:1) Throughout the viral outbreak we have received reports that conditions in \nthe Juvenile Halls (JH) and Camp Community Placements (CCP) are \ninconsistent with CDC, State or County guidance around safety measures \nto prevent the spread of the virus: \n(1)(cid:1)Social Distancing \n(a)(cid:1)Many clients report the only “social distancing” taking place is \nbetween staff and the youth, but youth are otherwise allowed to \nfreely congregate in numbers and distances inconsistent with CDC \nguidance. \n(b)(cid:1)The Los Angeles County Probation Chief personally reported that \nhe observed youth playing sports such as 5 on 5 basketball and \nsoccer after the emergency declaration was imposed.   \n(c)(cid:1)Youth continue to shower and eat in groups larger than 10.  \n(2)(cid:1)Sanitation \n(a)(cid:1)Youth report a lack of hand sanitizer, gloves, cleaning solutions, or \nface masks.   \n(3)(cid:1)Rehabilitative Services \n(a)(cid:1)Education: Youth report educational instruction has all but ceased \nand that they are provided “packets” of materials that are \n80\n\ndistributed and picked up once a week.  There is no accompanying \nexplanation, instructions, corrections or the ability to ask questions \nof an instructor.  \n(b)(cid:1)Mental Health: Youth report Los Angeles County Department of \nMental Health (DMH) staff are no longer on cite.  For a time, some \ncounselors were reportedly handling counseling sessions via phone \nor video conferencing, but those were either terminated or limited \ndue to the demands of the court video conferencing and attorney \nmeetings now taking place over the phone.  \n(c)(cid:1)Vocational training: Youth report vocational training has been \nsuspended. \n7)(cid:1) In light of the aforementioned facts surrounding the conditions of confinement, \nIJDP attorneys have submitted multiple motions under Welfare and Institutions \nCode Section 778 for a change of plan, seeking their client’s release from \nProbation CCPs.  IJDP attorneys have encountered unprecedented ministerial \nand procedural difficulties in moving for release and litigating other critical \nmatters due to drastically reduced juvenile court capacity following the \ndeclaration of the judicial emergency.  The reduced court capacity and systems \nimplemented to limit courtroom activity has systematically deprived youth of \nnotice and a right to be heard.  These include the following:  \na)(cid:1) According to IJDP attorneys, following the judicial emergency order, the \nnumber of active juvenile delinquency courts was reduced from 18 to fewer \nthan 9.  The current active juvenile delinquency bench appears to work on a \nrotation, but I have not received any formal notification of the rotation.  This \ndirectly impacts the ability of attorneys to direct their motions to the Judge \nwho imposed the disposition they seek to change.   \nb)(cid:1) The courts and the administrative office of the courts have refused to employ \nany means for attorneys to file motions or receive necessary court documents \nelectronically and have relegated the Prosecution and the Defense bar to \nsubmitting motions via a physical “drop box” outside the courthouse.  At least \n81\n\none of these “drop boxes” has been placed next to the entrance of the court, \nexposed to hundreds of youth and their families as they enter and exit one of \nthe busiest juvenile courthouses in the United States.  At least one motion \nplaced in the drop box may be lost.   \nc)(cid:1) I am informed and believe that the Probation Department has moved the \nDelinquency Court to issue “change of plans” under Welfare & Institutions \nCode section 778 in order to release over 40 youth.  Notice of these motions \nwas not provided to their attorneys nor were they afforded an opportunity to \nbe heard on the merits of the motion.  In several cases, despite a probation \nrecommendation for release, the petitions were denied by the Juvenile Court \nwithout permitting the Minor to be heard, providing the Minor and his or her \ncounsel with the probation reports supporting the decision, and without \nentering the decision upon the minutes, permitting appellate review.  \nMoreover, in one case, even when IJDP counsel was permitted to appear and \nargue for the Minor, he was not provided with the underlying probation \nreport ostensibly supporting the Juvenile Court’s decision.  When he sought \nan expedited transcript for appellate review, that request was initially \ndenied.  \nd)(cid:1) I am informed and believe that certain Juvenile Courts have taken the \nposition that motions seeking a change of plan under WIC section 778 are not \nconsidered “essential” items and as such will be heard once the judicial \nemergency has ended or after June 22, 2020.   \n \nI declare, on information and belief, the forgoing facts are true and correct under \npenalty of perjury.  \nExecuted the 14th day of April, 2020 \n \n_______________________________________________________ \nCyynn  YYaammaasshhiirroo \nDirecting Attorney \nIndependent Juvenile Defender Program \n82\n\nEXHIBIT D \nDeclaration of Sean Kennedy\nExecutive Director, Center for Juvenile Law and Policy\n83\n\nDECLARATION RE CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT \nI, Sean Kennedy, declare as follows: \n1. I am an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California, State Bar no. 145632.\n2. I am Kaplan and Feldman Executive Director and Associate Professor of the Center for\nJuvenile Law and Policy at Loyola Law School, Los Angeles. As part of our mission at\nthe Center for Juvenile Law and Policy, we provide holistic defense to young people in\nLos Angeles juvenile delinquency courts, with a focus on dual-jurisdiction youth.\n3. Our office represents 6 youth who are currently detained in juvenile hall, 1 youth in\nsecure camp and 1 youth in secure suitable placement.\n4. In our communications with several clients, conducted between April 2 and April 9,\n2020, I have learned the following information about conditions at Central Juvenile Hall,\nBarry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall and Campus Kirkpatrick.\na.Social Distancing:\ni.There have been no reported practices of social distancing at any of the facilities\nwhere our clients are detained. A client detained at Barry J. Nidorf did not know\nabout social distancing until speaking with his attorney. No probation staff had\nexplained or enforced the practice of social distancing. Probation staff have told\nyouth at Campus Kilpatrick to social distance, but do not implement social\ndistancing.\nii.Young people at Central and Barry J. Nidorf sleep alone in single cells, as was\nthe practice before the pandemic. Our client at Campus Kilpatrick sleeps in an\nopen dormitory with 10 other youth.\niii.Youth interviewed at Central Juvenile Hall and Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall\nreport eating meals daily with other children in their unit at the same table,\nplaying board games, watching television and taking communal showers with the\nother youth. The youth at Campus Kilpatrick also reports living communally in an\nopen dormitory setting.\niv.The youth interviewed and detained at Central Juvenile Hall and Barry J.\nNidorf report that they are still having recreational time outside, and are allowed\nto play contact sports. The youth detained at Campus Kilpatrick reports that all\nrecreational activities have been restricted and he remains inside the dormitory all\nday with the other youth in his cottage.\nb.Access to necessary hygiene products\ni.All interviewed youth report that they are responsible for cleaning their cells\ndaily, but have not been given disinfectant or other cleaning supplies. Youth at\n84\n\nboth juvenile halls report that there has been no increase in cleaning supplies, and \nthat while probation is now helping them to clean the unit, there has been no \nintroduction or increase in professional cleaning staff since COVID-19 began. \nYouth report that they have access to soap and water in order to wash their hands. \nTheir clothes are changed and washed once a week, and their bedclothes are \nchanged every couple of weeks, depending on availability of fresh sheets and/or \naccess to laundry.  \nii.No youth interviewed reported having access to hand sanitizer.\niii.No youth interviewed reported having access to a facial mask.\niv.No youth interviewed reported having access to gloves.\niv.The youth interviewed at Central and Barry J. Nidorf report having no access\nto cleaning wipes or disinfectant.\nd.Medical Symptoms and Response\ni.A youth at Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall reports that they were ill with a sore\nthroat and stuffy nose over two weeks ago, and stayed in his room. This youth\nreports that it takes over an hour to see a nurse, and that there aren’t enough staff\nto transport youth to the nurses office. This youth also reports that on their\nparticular unit, over 3 separate probation staff were sent home for displaying\nCOVID like symptoms in the last few days.\nAnother youth at Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall lives in the unit where a probation \nstaff have tested positive for COVID-19.  \nDuring the week of March 16, 2020, a youth at Central Juvenile Hall reported not \nfeeling well, with a cough and runny nose. This youth has pre-existing medical \nconditions. He was initially told to drink hot water, but was never provided hot \nwater. He also reported that the heat in his unit was broken, and that he was \nconstantly cold. He finally saw a nurse, after repeatedly asking probation officers \non his unit for medical care.  \nc.Education\ni.All youth interviewed, across facilities, have reported that educational\ninstruction has completely ceased. All youth have Individualized Education Plans,\nthe provisions of which are not being implemented. At Campus Kilpatrick, a\nteacher comes once a week to pick up and drop off new packets for youth to work\non, but are not available to answer questions. The packets are not individualized\nto a student’s learning needs or grade level. The student reports feeling like he has\n“no choice” over his education.\n85\n\nOne youth at Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall reports that since mid-March, 2020, he \nand all of the other youth on his unit have completed one page of math work. \nMath sheets were left in a box in the youth’s unit, but staff did not report to the \nyouth that the sheet was available. The youth were not given any instructions on \nhow to do the assignment, and did not have anyone available to ask questions \nabout the assignment.  \nA youth at Central Juvenile Hall reports that he has not been provided any special \neducation services, and as of the first week of April had not been given a new \npacket of work for over a week and a half. This child reports that he has not been \nable to ask any questions about the assignments, when packets are provided. [ \nAll students interviewed report that there is no access to laptop or other \ntechnology to assist with learning.  \nd.Programming\ni.All youth interviewed report that there has been zero programming, including\nmental health services from DMH for the last few weeks. No youth interviewed\nhas been able to access DMH counseling since mid-March, including telephonic\ncalls. Groups such as Inside Out Writers, ARC, and any other rehabilitative group\nclasses or therapy have completely ceased.\nYouth across facilities, with the exception of Campus Kilpatrick, report that “rec \ntime” is the only activity they are engaged in. Otherwise, they are in their rooms \nor the day room. At Campus Kilpatrick, the youth reports that outdoor rec time \nhas been completely restricted and that he is in the common area of his dorm for \nthe majority of the day.  \ne. Visits\ni.Since family visits were restricted on March 13, 2020, one month ago, no youth\ninterviewed has been able to have a video phone call with their family. With the\nexception of Campus Kilpatrick, access to phone calls in the juvenile halls and\nhas been restricted to once a week, and further limiting access to phone calls is\nused as a disciplinary measure. Youth and their families are still paying for these\ncalls using Global TeleLink.\nAt Barry J. Nidorf, starting the week of March 16, each child has been given one \nten-minute phone call every Thursday to speak to his family. One client uses five \nminutes to call his dad, and five minutes to call his grandmother. The staff told \nhim that they are supposed to get another ten minute phone call on Sundays, but \nthat has not happened. Each Thursday, before getting a phone call, our client is \ngiven a sheet of paper to sign to verify that he has satisfied all of the disciplinary \nrequirements to be able to receive his phone call, and that he was given his phone \ncall. If a child does not meet all of the behavior requirements, they are not given a \nphone call that week.  Our client reports that they are always told that their \n86\n\nThursday phone call is a privilege that has to be earned and can be taken away if \nthey do not behave. There has been no attempt to use video conferencing to call \nhis family. A client at Central Juvenile Hall similarly reports that Probation uses \nphone calls as discipline. Staff advise him to behave or he won’t be able to make \nphone calls, even to his attorney. This youth has not been allowed to make any \nvideo calls. This youth reports feeling sadness, distress and anxiety without \nhaving access to his mom or legal team.  \nAnother client reports that without visits, he is very angry and upset. \nOur clients have been unable to access secure, confidential phone calls with their \nlegal team. Multiple times a week, a client at Barry J. Nidorf asks the staff on \nduty if he can call his attorney, but almost every time he is told that there is no \ntime or that there is not enough staff to let him call his attorney. A client at \nCentral Juvenile Hall, who per a court order is entitled to “reasonable, free access \nto counsel,” is required to use the pay phones, using Global TeleLink, to make \nrecorded calls to his legal team at a cost. Our client has told this to probation staff, \nwho do not provide reasonable, free access to counsel.  \n5. Given this information, we have been attempting to bring selected cases before the court\nto either seek the release or otherwise seek remedy to the issues addressed in this\ndeclaration. I have encountered the following difficulties:\ni. To address many of these issues outlined in this declaration, it is my\nunderstanding from the public statements of the Los Angeles Superior Court that\njuvenile cases should be heard by the bench officer assigned to a particular case\nfor the duration of the pandemic emergency.\nii. Until the pandemic emergency, the Los Angeles County Juvenile Delinquency\nCourt there were 18 juvenile delinquency courtrooms across seven courthouses.\nOf the 18 bench officers in the Los Angeles County Juvenile Delinquency Court,\nonly nine of those bench officers have regularly been on the bench since the onset\nof the crisis. Five of the nine keep erratic schedules that differ from day to day.\nOne bench officer hears cases in a different courthouse than the one to which he is\nassigned. Only four bench officers are hearing their regular calendars in their\nregular courtrooms.\niii. No directives have issued from any of the juvenile courts as to how or where\ndefense counsel should file motions or how to direct these to the appropriate\nbench officer when a courtroom is closed.\niv. Our office has attempted to file WIC 775/778 motions for several clients. We\nhave been able to file these motions and hold hearings in 3 instances. In another\ninstance, we were instructed to drop the motion in a box inside the Eastlake\nJuvenile Courthouse, and are awaiting word on whether the motion will be heard.\n87\n\nIn another instance, we emailed the Judicial Assistant in the particular \ndepartment, as well as the two assigned Deputy District Attorneys in that \ncourtroom. We were directed to send the motion to the judicial assistant in \nanother department in that particular courthouse. We were then informed we \ncould calendar in the motion in approximately two weeks. After several follow-up \nphone calls, we were able to advance the hearing date to within a week of filing.  \nI declare, based on information and belief, under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is \ntrue and correct. \nExecuted on April 14, 2020 at Los Angeles, California. \n_________________________________ \nSEAN KENNEDY \nDeclarant \n88\n\nEXHIBIT E \nDeclaration of Jerod Gunsberg, Esq.\n89\n\n90\n\n91\n\n92\n\n93\n\n94\n\nEXHIBIT F \nDeclaration of Leslie Heimov, Executive Director, Children’s Law Center\n95\n\nDECLARATION OF LESLIE HEIMOV \n \n \nI, LESLIE HEIMOV, declare as follows:  \n \n1.

Within the last week, CLC attorneys have spoken directly to at least 17 \nof our clients who are currently detained in Central Juvenile Hall, \nBarry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall, Dorothy Kirby Center or Camp Glenn \nRocky. \n \n6.  We are concerned about the increased risk of COVID-19 faced by our \nclients due to the congregate living setting, the staff coming and going \nfrom the facilities daily, and the lack of COVID-19 safety precautions \nbeing taken to protect our clients.  \n \n7.  At Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall in Sylmar, CA, at least 2 staff \nmembers have reportedly tested positive for COVID-19. Our clients \ndetained at Barry J. Nidorj Juvenile Hall do not have access to hand \nsanitizer and masks. There is inconsistent use of gloves and masks by \nstaff, with some staff wearing neither gloves nor a mask. The youth \nspend most of their day in the “day room,” where they are not provided \nspace to be 6 feet apart from each other.  \n \n96\n\n8. Our clients detained at Central Juvenile Hall, Dorothy Kirby Center or\nCamp Glenn Rocky also report inconsistent access to hand sanitizer,\ngloves and masks for the youth. One client detained at Central Juvenile\nHall reported that only “favorites” are provided with masks.\n9. We are concerned about the lack of access to services and support for\nour clients detained at Central Juvenile Hall, Dorothy Kirby Center or\nCamp Glenn Rocky. None of them are receiving in-person schooling or\nin-person therapeutic services while detained.\nI declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California \nthat the foregoing is true and correct.  \nExecuted this 13th day of April 2020, at Los Angeles, California. \n_______________________ \nLESLIE HEIMOV\n97\n\nEXHIBIT G \nEmail Communications about BSCC Suspension \n98\n\n99\n\n100\n\n101\n\n102\n\n103\n\nDECLARATION OF SERVICE \n \n  I, the undersigned, say that I am over eighteen years of age and \nnot a party to the above action.

JW2020-01 \n   \n \nALL YOUTH DETAINED IN JUVENILE   \n \nHALLS AND CAMPS IN LOS ANGELES   \n \nCOUNTY  ORDER DENYING PETITION  \nFOR WRIT OF MANDATE \n                              Petitioners, \n                    vs. \nSUPERIOR COURT OF LOS ANGELES \nCOUNTY \n                              Respondent, \nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF \nCALIFORNIA; THE COUNTY OF LOS \nANGELES \n                              Real Parties in Interest.                  \n       \n \n \nCOVID-19 \nThe World Health Organization has declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) \noutbreak a global pandemic.  The President and the California governor have declared a state of \nemergency.   \nCOVID-19 spreads easily from person to person and from contact with contaminated \nsurfaces.  People who have serious underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe \nillness from COVID-19.  There is currently no vaccine.  To control the virus, the Centers for \n\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people practice “social distancing,” \nstay at home, wash their hands often, disinfect surfaces, and cover their mouths and nose with a \nface cover when around others. \nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nOn April 15, 2020, petitioners Center for Juvenile Law and Policy (CJLP), a public \ninterest law school clinic at Loyola Law School, and Independent Juvenile Defender Program \n(IJDP), a panel of attorneys who provide free legal services to indigent youth, filed on behalf of \nall detained juveniles in the County of Los Angeles a petition for writ of mandate with the \nCalifornia Supreme Court.   \nThe petition stated that confined youth are in grave danger of contracting COVID-19, and \nthat a reduction in their population in detention facilities was imperative.  The petition asserted \nthe existing method of reviewing cases on an individualized basis was inadequate, and that the \nLos Angeles Superior Court should be directed to implement different criteria in order to release \nas many youths as possible, as quickly as possible.  The prayer sought the immediate release of \ncertain categories of youth in confinement, the suspension of all new admissions into detention \nfacilities, and the expedited review of all other youths by the juvenile courts, as well as requiring \nthe facilities to comply with CDC regulations, the provision of additional services, and the \nappointment of a special master. \nOn April 22, 2020, the Supreme Court transferred the petition to the Court of Appeal, \nSecond Appellate District, with directions to issue an order to show cause returnable before the \nLos Angeles Superior Court, addressing “whether juveniles detained in Los Angeles County \njuvenile facilities are being denied due process under the Fourteenth Amendment by being held \nin conditions that could subject them to contracting the COVID-19 virus and, if so, what \nremedies can be lawfully ordered.”   \nFollowing transfer, the petition was deemed filed in this Court.  On May 5, 2020, the \nPeople and the County filed their returns.   \nThe County denied that conditions in the juvenile halls and camps were unsafe.  The \nCounty detailed Probation’s COVID-19 Operations Plan that was implemented in order to reduce \nthe risk to detained youth and submitted declarations from the Probation’s Bureau Chief and \n\nother experts who attested to Probation’s implementation of safety protocols in compliance with \nCDC and Department of Public Health (DPH) guidelines and the continued provision of care to \ndetained youth. \nThe People denied that efforts to release juveniles from detention were inadequate, \nstating that the District Attorney’s Office was proactively and systematically reviewing cases and \nworking with justice partners to identify youths for release, and that collaborative efforts had \nresulted in a significant reduction in the detained population.  \nPetitioners filed a reply on May 7, 2020, denying that the Probation Department has \nadequately implemented CDC and DPH guidelines.  They maintained that while improvements \nhad been made, the implementation and compliance with public health guidelines and protocols \nremain challenged and inconsistent. \nDISCUSSION \nPetition for Writ of Mandate \nWrit relief is available to compel public agencies to perform acts required by law.  (Code \nCiv. Proc., § 1085.)  “To obtain relief, a petitioner must demonstrate (1) no ‘plain, speedy, and \nadequate’ alternative remedy exists [citation]; (2) ‘a clear, present, . . . ministerial duty on the \npart of the respondent’; and (3) a correlative ‘clear, present, and beneficial right in the petitioner \nto the performance of that duty.’  [Citations.]  A ministerial duty is an obligation to perform a \nspecific act in a manner prescribed by law whenever a given state of facts exists, without regard \nto any personal judgment as to the propriety of the act.  [Citation.]”  (People v. Picklesimer \n(2010) 48 Cal.4th 330, 340.)   \nPetitioners contend there is no adequate remedy at law to address the exposure to \nCOVID-19 in juvenile facilities, and that mandamus is necessary to correct the constitutional \nviolation presented in this case.  (Save the Plastic Bag Coalition v. City of Manhattan Beach \n(2011) 52 Cal.4th 155, 166 [public interest standing “where the question is one of public right \nand the object of the mandamus is to procure the enforcement of a public duty”]; Edward W. v. \nLamkins (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 516, 529 [if “respondent’s practices violate the constitutional \nguarantees of due process and/or equal protection of the laws, relief by means of writ of mandate \nwould be appropriate”].) \n\nFourteenth Amendment Due Process \nThe Supreme Court’s direction to the Court of Appeal to issue an order to show cause \nsignifies its preliminary determination that petitioners have made a prima facie statement of \nspecific facts which, if established, entitle them to relief.  (See In re Serrano (1995) 10 Cal.4th \n447, 454-455.)  The claims to be decided are limited to those alleged in the petition that form the \nbasis of the Court’s order to show cause.  (In re Lugo (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1542.)  The \nSupreme Court and Court of Appeal directed the parties to address a narrow issue: whether \nFourth Amendment due process has been denied to detained juveniles because the conditions of \ntheir confinement subject them to contracting the COVID-19 virus.   \nJuvenile detainees are afforded more protection than criminal defendants.  While the \nEighth Amendment protects criminal defendants from cruel and unusual punishment, by \ncontrast, the more protective Fourteenth Amendment standard applies to conditions of \nconfinement for detainees, such as juveniles, who are not technically convicted of crimes.  (Gary \nH. v. Hegstrom (9th Cir.1987) 831 F.2d 1430, 1432, citing Youngberg v. Romeo (1982) 457 U.S. \n307, 315 [civilly committed individuals] and Bell v. Wolfish (1979) 441 U.S. 520, 535, fn. 16 \n[pretrial detainees].)   \nWhen the government takes a person into custody and detains him, the Constitution \nimposes a duty to assume responsibility for the detainee’s reasonable safety.  (See Helling v. \nMcKinney (1993) 509 U.S. 25, 32; Estelle v. Gamble (1976) 429 U.S. 97, 103.)  “The affirmative \nduty to protect arises . . . from the limitation which it has imposed on his freedom to act on his \nown behalf.  [Citation.]”  (DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Services (1989) 489 \nU.S. 189, 200.)   \nFor individuals who have been convicted of a crime, this duty arises under the Eighth \nAmendment and is violated upon a showing of “deliberate indifference.” (Estelle v. Gamble, \nsupra, 429 U.S. at pp. 103-04.)  By contrast, juvenile detention is a form of civil confinement, \nand the government’s duty to oversee the welfare of civil detainees arises under the due process \nclause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  (Youngberg v. Romeo (1982) 457 U.S. 307, 315-316.)  “In \nthe substantive due process analysis, it is the State’s affirmative act of restraining the \nindividual’s freedom to act on his own behalf—through incarceration, institutionalization, or \nother similar restraint of personal liberty—which is the ‘deprivation of liberty’ triggering the \n\nprotections of the Due Process Clause . . . .”  (DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social \nServices, supra, 489 U.S. at p. 200, fn. omitted.)  “The State also has the unquestioned duty to \nprovide reasonable safety for all residents and personnel within the institution.”  (Youngberg v. \nRomeo, supra, 457 U.S. at p. 324.)  “[A] remedy for unsafe conditions need not await a tragic \nevent.”  (Helling v. McKinney, supra, 509 U.S. at p. 33.)   \nAccordingly, juvenile detainees have constitutionally protected interests in conditions of \nreasonable care and safety.  Juvenile detainees cannot be subjected to conditions that amount to \npunishment and are afforded more considerate treatment and conditions of confinement than \ncriminals whose conditions of confinement are designed to punish.  To show a violation of \nFourteenth Amendment due process rights in this context, a detainee must show the state’s \nconduct was “such a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice, or \nstandards in the care and treatment [of detainees] as to demonstrate that the person responsible \nactually did not base the decision on such a judgment.”  (Youngberg v. Romeo, supra, 457 U.S. \nat p. 323.)  “In determining whether the State has met its duty in this respect, decisions made by \nthe appropriate professional are entitled to a presumption of correctness.  Such a presumption is \nnecessary to enable institutions of this type—often, unfortunately, overcrowded and \nunderstaffed—to continue to function.  A single professional may have to make decisions with \nrespect to a number of residents with widely varying needs and problems in the course of a \nnormal day.”  (Id. at p. 324.) \nThe COVID-19 global pandemic presents a unique challenge for governmental agencies, \nin that – as the County has pointed out – scientific data is yet uncertain and continually evolving \nregarding the optimal conditions relating to the coronavirus’s infection and spread.  Over the last \nfew weeks, CDC guidelines have continued to evolve based on new scientific understanding of \nthe novel coronavirus, as well as changing conditions regarding the availability of protective \nequipment and the feasibility of safety protocols.  Business and institutions appear to be \nstruggling to meet the demand for protective equipment and implementation of safety and \ndistancing protocols.  According to the parties’ submissions, this appears to include the County’s \njuvenile halls and camps.   \nAs a general matter, the scientific consensus appears to be that any condition that \npromotes sustained physical contact, including close confinement in juvenile facilities, could \n\nsubject individuals to contracting the COVID-19 virus.  (CDC, Interim Guidance on \nManagement of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities \n<https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-\ncorrectional-detention.html> [as of May 12, 2020].)   \nAt the hearing, petitioners argued that no safety measures undertaken by the County \nwould be sufficient to survive a constitutional due process challenge because of the inherently \nunsafe conditions of detention and confinement.  At the same time, petitioners acknowledged \nthat every juvenile detainee could not, as a practical matter, be released from such facilities, and \nthey do not pray for such relief.  The incoherence of petitioners’ position highlights the \ndifficulties facing all parties involved in maintaining the juvenile justice system and safeguarding \njuveniles detained in the County’s halls and camps against COVID-19 infection.      \nIn addition, the Court notes that it is unclear – and factually unexplored by the parties – \nwhether release of juveniles would result in a reduced health risk due to COVID-19, particularly \nconsidering the high and rapidly increasing infection rates throughout the population of Los \nAngeles County, the unknown, diverse and, in many cases, unstable circumstances to which \njuveniles would likely be released and the effects of those circumstances on the health and safety \nof juveniles, and the improving safety protocols and availability of health care services within \njuvenile facilities.  While petitioners argue that the Court need not take into consideration these \nfactors, the Court sees no practical alternative to doing so.  The Fourteenth Amendment cannot \nrequire the County to release juveniles within their care into circumstances of potentially greater \ndanger, simply because conditions everywhere are such that absolute safety may be out of reach \nfor all.   \nThe primary question before this Court is the extent to which the parties have \ndemonstrated whether the present conditions of the County’s juvenile facilities have exacerbated \nor heightened the likelihood that detained juveniles will contract the COVID-19 virus, whether \nthe County has undertaken reasonable measures to safeguard juvenile detainees against infection, \nand whether failures to do so rise to the level of a Fourteenth Amendment due process violation.  \n \n \n\nConditions of Facilities \nThe rapidly changing conditions, the lack of clear scientific understanding of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, and the broad scope of this petition – relating generally to all County \njuvenile facilities and detained juveniles – has presented the parties with difficulties in presenting \nspecific facts, as well as competent evidence to demonstrate such facts.  The facts and evidence \npresented offer neither a complete picture of current conditions in juvenile detention facilities \nnor a clear benchmark or criteria for safe conditions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nAs the County has pointed out, clear, concrete requirements for safe conditions in the \nCounty’s juvenile detention facilities may not presently exist given the novel nature of COVID-\n19.  Instead, the CDC has provided only guiding principles for administrators of correctional and \ndetention facilities to assist in preparing for potential introduction, spread, and mitigation of \nCOVID-19 in their facilities.  For example, the CDC website states that ideally six feet between \nall individuals is the recommended practice.  But the website also acknowledges that detained \nindividuals live, work, eat, study, and recreate in congregate environments that make social \ndistancing challenging and therefore “[s]trategies will need to be tailored to the individual space \nin the facility and the needs of the population and staff.  Not all strategies will be feasible in all \nfacilities.”  (CDC, Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) \nin Correctional and Detention Facilities <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html#prevention> [as of \nMay 12, 2020].)  This deference called for in the CDC guidelines mirrors the presumption of \ncorrectness of professional judgment discussed by the Supreme Court in Youngberg, where the \nSupreme Court acknowledged that administrators require significant discretion to make daily \ndecisions regarding diverse populations of detainees based on specific and variable \ncircumstances.  (Youngberg v. Romeo, supra, 457 U.S. at p. 323.)  \nIn its return, the County generally described the measures it has taken to prevent the \nspread of COVID-19 in detention facilities by adopting new protocols and practices.  Notably \nmissing were substantive representations regarding the degree of implementation and \nenforcement for each facility.   \nThe County submitted the declaration of Jennifer Kaufman, the Bureau Chief of the \nResidential Treatment Services Bureau.  The Bureau is charged with providing juvenile \n\nprobationers with intervention services in a residential treatment setting, and, as the Bureau \nChief, Kaufman oversees the implementation of new services and programs.   \nKaufman noted that as of the date of her declaration there were no detained youth in any \nfacility operated by Probation who had tested positive for COVID-19.1  She noted 19 staff \nmembers tested positive for COVID-19 and that they were currently on medical leave.  Two \nyouths who were exposed were placed under quarantine, getting regular care and presenting no \nsymptoms.  Kaufman also reported that since March 1 there had been a 35 percent reduction in \nthe population of juvenile halls and camps.   \nKaufman stated that on March 12, Probation activated the COVID-19 Operations Plan \nthat set guidelines directed at reducing the risk of spreading COVID-19.  Under the Plan, \nfacilities were provided enhanced inventory of sanitation and protective supplies, a new \nadmission screening process was implemented, and movement between facilities and camps was \nsuspended.     \nKaufman further testified to CDC and DPH recommended practices adopted by \nProbation, such as limiting group sizes to no more than six youth, staggering meals and indoor \nactivities, limiting group exercise to six, practicing sanitation and hygiene after recreation, and \neducating about proper social distancing and hand washing.  She stated Probation modified \nsleeping arrangements so that youths in camps sleep head to toe and at least four feet apart.  She \nstated that all facilities installed hand sanitizer stations and distributed masks to youth, and high-\ncontact areas were being sanitized at least twice daily, and common areas were being cleaned \nmore frequently.  The staff were now required to wear masks, and youths were also being given \ncloth masks that could be washed regularly.   \n                                                 \n1Since the filing of the briefs, the Court notes that the L.A. Times reported two newly \nbooked detained youth have tested positive for novel coronavirus and have been isolated from \nthe general population.  (Queally, L.A. Times, First Youths Test Positive for Coronavirus in L.A. \nCounty Juvenile Halls (May 7, 2020) <https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-07/ \nfirst-youths-test-positive-for-coronavirus-in-l-a-county-juvenile-halls> [May 7, 2020].)  The \nCourt disclosed its awareness of this report at the hearing, to which the parties made no \nobjection.  The information illustrates both the seriousness of this rapidly changing environment \nand the effectiveness of new testing measures undertaken by the County to reduce the spread of \nthe virus. \n\nThe County also submitted a declaration by Dr. Lello Tesema, the DPH’s COVID-19 \nliaison for Corrections.  He maintained that “CDC and DPH guidelines are recommendations, \nwhich juvenile facilities should adopt their operations to meet,” and concluded that the County \nhad adequately implemented social distancing protocols and access to supplies used for the \nprevention of infection.  \nIn his supporting declaration, Dr. David Oh, the Medical Director for Juvenile Court \nHealth Services, stated there had been no meaningful reduction in the provision of medical care \nto detained youth at county facilities during the pandemic.  He further stated that as of May 4, \n2020, the youth admitted to a juvenile hall would be screened for COVID-19 and quarantined \nuntil results were returned.  Those testing positive would be placed in isolation and provided \nmedical treatment.  Dr. Christopher Thompson, the Director of Forensic Psychiatry at the \nDepartment of Mental Health, testified to in-person, telephonic, and videoconference services \nbeing provided to youths in need of psychiatric care.   \nIn their traverse, petitioners maintained the County’s response had been deficient and that \na serious risk of unreasonable harm to youth in juvenile halls and camps persisted.  Petitioners \ncited to the declarations of Cyn Yamashiro, Directing Attorney of IJDP, and Sean Kennedy, \nExecutive Director for CJLP, in support of their claim.  Neither Yamashiro nor Kennedy offer \nfirst-hand observations or knowledge regarding the conditions and protocols employed at the \nfacilities.   \nRegarding CDC compliance and sanitation protocols at the facilities, Yamashiro’s \ndeclaration consisted of incompetent hearsay.  In his April 14 declaration submitted in support of \nthe petition, Yamashiro stated his agency had received reports from clients that they were being \nallowed to “congregate in numbers and distances inconsistent with CDC guidance,” that an \nunnamed Probation Chief “reported that he observed youth playing sports” after a state of \nemergency had been declared, and there were reports of youth continuing to shower and eat in \ngroups larger than 10, as well as a lack of protective supplies.  He did not identify the youths \nwho had made these alleged reports, did not describe the facilities where the failures occurred, \ndid not provide the dates on which such observations occurred, and failed to provide details \nregarding circumstances surrounding the reported events.  The same generalized statements were \noffered in Yamashiro’s May 5 declaration submitted in support of the traverse. \n\nKennedy’s declarations were similarly deficient.  In his April 14 declaration, Kennedy \nstated he represented eight clients who were being detained at Central Juvenile Hall, Barry J. \nNidorf Juvenile Hall, and Campus Kirkpatrick.  Between April 2 and April 9, Kennedy was told \nby a client at Barry J. Nidorf that he did not know about social distancing.  A client at Campus \nKilpatrick told Kennedy that the staff “told youth to social distance, but [did] not implement \nsocial distancing.”  It was also reported that meals, showers, and recreation were occurring \ncommunally, and that a client was sleeping in a dormitory with 10 other youth.   \nIt was also reported to Kennedy that youths were not given disinfectant or other cleaning \nsupplies, but that Probation was “now helping them to clean” their units.   Kennedy stated that \n“[n]o youth interviewed reported” having access to hand sanitizer, face masks, or gloves,” and \nthat his clients in the juvenile halls reported a lack of wipes and disinfectant. \nBy the time of the traverse, Kennedy only had six clients in detention.  In his May 6 \ndeclaration, he reiterated the lack of “reported” social distancing and the communal living at \nthese facilities.  He noted some improvements.   \nThere were only six other youth with his client in the dormitory at Campus Kilpatrick.  \nRegarding supplies, he maintained “[n]o youth at either juvenile hall reported having access to \nhand sanitizer, while youth at Dorothy Kirby Center now report having access to hand sanitizer.”  \nHe stated “[t]wo youth reported having access to face masks since or around late April, 2020,” \none reported using the same mask “over and over,” another youth reported being giving masks \ndaily, and the youth interviewed at the juvenile halls continued to report having no access to \ncleaning wipes or disinfectant.”   \nIt is not clear how many of Kennedy’s eight clients actually reported deficiencies.  No \ndeclarations based on personal knowledge were submitted.  The statements regarding problems \nwith the County’s response to COVID-19 offered no contextual information such as specific \ndates, the number and composition of the population at each offending facility, or a description \nof any of the facilities. \nPrivate attorney Jerod Gunsberg submitted a declaration in support of the petition \noffering similar anecdotal testimony.  On April 9, 2020, he had four clients detained in juvenile \nhall and three in probation camps.  Through his communications with them he learned of similar \n\nviolations in the facilities.  By the time of the filing of the traverse, Gunsberg had only five \ndetained clients, and his May 5 declaration did not further discuss problems with social \ndistancing or access to hygiene products.2 \nThe issuance of an order to show cause afforded petitioners the opportunity to present \nadditional evidence in support of the truth of the allegations in the petition.  (In re Serrano, \nsupra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 456.)  Rather than present specific facts and competent evidence in \nsupport of their allegations that conditions and enforcement were deficient, petitioners largely \ncontinued to rely on the general, hearsay statements offered in the Yamashiro and Kennedy \ndeclarations.  As noted, their statements provided insufficient details surrounding clients who felt \nat risk or the circumstances of any particular facility’s failures.   \n  While the Court is troubled by the accounts raised by petitioners regarding the failure of \nCounty facilities to provide protective equipment and implement physical distancing protocols \nduring the pendency of this petition, petitioners have not presented facts or evidence establishing \na failure to act that rises to the level of a constitutional violation as to any individual juvenile, or \nas to the entire population of juveniles, detained in County facilities.  This Court cannot assign \nsignificant weight to Yamashiro, Kennedy, or Gunsberg’s declarations which not only fail to \nprovide competent evidence, but also fail to present basic facts regarding the Probation \nDepartment’s deficiency in safeguarding detainees against the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nSpecifically, petitioners have not made a sufficient showing to demonstrate that the \nCounty’s conduct has been “such a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, \npractice, or standards in the care and treatment of [detainees] as to demonstrate that the [the \nCounty] did not base their conduct on a professional judgment.”  (Youngberg v. Romeo, supra, \n457 U.S. at p. 323.)  Indeed, petitioners have not identified objective criteria for determining \n                                                 \n2The Alternate Public Defender (APD) also filed a brief in support of the petition.  The \nAPD stated that since March 31, 2020, a team comprised of three deputy alternate public \ndefenders and three psychiatric social workers has maintained weekly contact with detained \nclients regarding the impact of the pandemic on the conditions of confinement and conducted \nover 250 interviews with a total of 124 clients.  Based on these interviews, the APD offered \nreports of the conditions.  He stated that “many . . . hall units and camp dorms house more than \nthe recommended maximum of six youth,” social distancing is not enforced, contact sports are \nallowed, and meals are not staggered.  Beyond these broad assertions, no specific facilities, dates \nof violations, or any other details were offered.   \n\nwhat safeguards the County could put in place in detention facilities that would satisfy the \nrequirements of Fourteenth Amendment due process.  Even if the Court were to assume that \nimmediate compliance with the CDC’s current interim guidelines would be required, the \nguidelines provide for considerable discretion on the part of government agencies to implement \nprotocols under the specific circumstances of facilities and individuals in detainment.3 \nThe Court is sensitive to the vulnerability of detained youth in the County’s juvenile \ndetention centers in the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic and concerned with the speed \nand comprehensiveness in which Probation is implementing appropriate safety protocols.  But to \ndemonstrate a constitutional due process violation, Petitioner must do more than to assert that the \nCOVID-19 pandemic makes juvenile detention facilities per se unsafe and to point to anecdotal, \nanonymous accounts of non-compliance with CDC guidelines.    \nAfter consideration of the parties’ arguments and the state of evidence presented, the \nCourt finds that petitioners failed to carry their burden of proving facts entitling them to relief by \na preponderance of the evidence.  (In re Sassounian (1995) 9 Cal.4th 535, 546; In re Alvarez \n(2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 1064, 1076; In re Rhoades (2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 896, 907-908.) \nCONCLUSION \nAll parties agree this pandemic is unprecedented, the virus poses a deadly global threat, \nthat juveniles in detained settings are particularly vulnerable, and action is needed to address this \npublic health emergency.  Petitioners assert that the best approach to dealing with the COVID-19 \n                                                 \n  3The County argues that this petition should be denied, because although the County and \nthe People have been added as real parties in interest, the petition seeks a writ of mandamus \nagainst the Superior Court for various forms of relief.  A writ of mandamus is available if the \nparty who applies for it is entitled to the performance of a clear legal duty by the party against \nwhom the writ is sought.  If a clear legal duty exists, a court must grant the writ if there is no \nspeedy and adequate remedy available in the ordinary course of law.  The clear legal duty must \ninvolve a ministerial, not a discretionary, act.  A clear legal duty exists only when the law defines \nthe duty with such precision and certainty as to leave nothing to the exercise of discretion and \njudgment.  (People v. Picklesimer, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 340.)  Were the Court to construe this \npetition as requesting a writ of mandate against the County to perform its duty to safeguard \njuvenile detainees against infection with the COVID-19 virus by complying with CDC \nguidelines, it is unclear what ministerial duty it has failed to perform, where the CDC guidelines \nacknowledge the necessity for significant discretion. \n\npandemic is to release as many juvenile detainees as possible, and remarkably, real parties in \ninterest agree.   \nIt is undisputed that the continued cooperation of all parties and justice partners has \nresulted in a dramatic reduction in the detained youth population in the County of Los Angeles.  \nAccording to Head Deputy District Attorney of the Juvenile Division, Shawn N. Randolph, \njustice partners continue to identify those youths who can be safely released.   \n  Since March 18, 2020, the District Attorney’s Office reviewed all pending cases and \nagreed to the release of 99 minors.  On March 16, there were 536 youths in the juvenile halls, \nand by April 16, that number had been reduced to 371.  On March 16, 2020, there were 286 \nyouths detained in community camp programs, and by May 1, 2020, 119 of the 286 had been \nreleased.   \nThe Probation Department reviewed post-adjudication cases where minors were detained \nin camps or Dorothy Kirby and initially filed 56 petitions and later 37 petitions under Welfare \nand Institutions Code section 778.  According to the District Attorney, the court has ordered the \nrelease of 25 minors pursuant to such a motion, and 37 without such a motion.   \nThe Court notes that detained youths have avenues to present requests for release through \nstatutory mechanisms based on their individual situation, and the court understands that all the \nrelevant parties are working together to expedite release where appropriate.  Nothing prevents \nattorneys from filing appropriate motions with the juvenile court (Welf. & Inst. Code, §§ 635, \n636, 778) or, if the court denies relief, from seeking appellate relief. \nThe Court understands that justice partners participate in informal weekly meetings with \nthe delinquency court.  The People state that justice partners have communicated to the \nSupervising Judge the need to create an expedited process for hearing detention matters, \nincluding section 778 motions, and the Supervising Judge has been receptive to the issues \nbrought to his attention.  All parties will continue to work with the court so that judicial and \ncourt resources are dedicated to processing releases as expeditiously as possible.  At the hearing, \npetitioners asserted a greater need for transparency on the part of Probation regarding its efforts \nto protect juveniles from COVID-19 viral infection.  The Court notes that, on this petition, the \nCounty’s factual submissions regarding evidence of CDC compliance fall short.  If the parties \n\nare to continue to cooperate effectively, it appears there will be a greater need for information \nexchange.          \nDuring this time of global pandemic, the delinquency court will undoubtedly recalibrate \nthe need for detention and adjust the manner in which it assesses public/community safety.  \nRequests to release juveniles from detention must be based on an individualized and fact-based \nshowing of whether release would be appropriate based on the totality of the circumstances, \nincluding the risk of exposure to COVID-19 while in custody; whether the minor has a \npreexisting medical condition that makes him or her particularly vulnerable to COVID-19; \nwhether the minor would pose a safety risk if released; the seriousness of the offense and history \nof criminal activity; and the minor’s release plan or family circumstances. \nConsidering the facts and evidence presented to the Court on this petition, Petitioners \nhave not demonstrated that the County has failed to act reasonably to protect detained youth, or \nthat youth are being held in conditions that could subject them to contracting the COVID-19 \nvirus in a manner that rises to the level of a constitutional due process violation.   \nThe petition is therefore denied without prejudice.   \n \n \nDate:  5/12/2020        ______________________________ \nD.
