The movant-intervenor is not incarcerated at Danbury FCI, is not a member of the provisionally certified class, and has no interest in a settlement between the Warden at FCI Danbury and a class of inmates at that facility. Further, as the Court has previously informed the movant-intervenor, it would not have jurisdiction over a 2241 petition filed by her or other inmates housed at BOP facilities not located within the District of Connecticut. For the same reasons, Rule 71 cannot apply to the movant-intervenor, because the Court cannot enter an \"order grant[ing] relief for a nonparty...\" over whom it does not have jurisdiction. Fed. R.

Within 6 days of the Plaintiffs' filing of proof of such service, the Respondents shall file a response to this order showing cause why the writ should not be granted, the Court finding good cause to allow time beyond the three days specified in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2243, due to the size and complexity of the plaintiffs' filings. The Court will promptly schedule an initial telephonic status conference with the parties once the Respondents have filed their response; the purpose of the conference, which the Court will endeavor to hold within 36 hours of the filing of the response, will be to discuss the nature and timing of the hearing the Court should hold to adjudicate the petition and any other issues raised in the parties' papers, including but not limited to whether the Court should require Respondents promptly to identify members of the Subclass defined in the Petition, as requested in the Motion for Order to Show Cause. To the extent the Notice of Related Case should be construed as a request to transfer this case to Judge Bolden, it is DENIED. The undersigned, too, has been assigned habeas petitions arising under Section 2241 and brought by inmates at FCI Danbury (see, e.g., Serfass v. Warden, 20cv513), and other judges in this district apart from the undersigned and Judge Bolden likely have been as well. Further, the Foreman case raises several issues not raised in this case, and this case, a putative class action, raises many issues not raised in that case. Signed by Judge Michael P. Shea on 4/29/2020. (Karpman, Michael) (Entered: 04/29/2020)"

          "description": "ORDER. For the reasons discussed during today's call, the Court hereby amends the Temporary Restraining Order entered on May 12, 2020, see ECF No. 30 at 68-73, as follows:(1) Paragraph 1f is amended to read as follows: \"Respondent shall provide the list to Petitioners' counsel, and the list shall be marked 'Confidential Attorneys' Eyes Only' and be treated accordingly under the Protective Order entered in this case, ECF No. 9, except that Petitioners' counsel may also disclose information on the list pertaining to a particular inmate to (a) that inmate and/or (b) that inmate's representative (either the inmate's family member or his/her attorney). To be clear, Petitioners counsel may not disclose information pertaining to one inmate to another inmate or another inmate's representative.\" (2) The Court nunc pro tunc amends the Temporary Restraining Order and Ruling (ECF No. 30) to indicate that it has considered whether to require the Petitioners to give security under Rule 65(c) and has concluded that, because they are indigent and because of the nature of the case, the amount of security is set at $0.With regard to the discussion on the call concerning the Connecticut Supreme Court's decision in Byrne v. Avery Center for Obstetrics and Gynecology, P.C., 327 Conn. 540 (2018), the Court does not find that that decision, or the Connecticut statute or HIPAA regulations cited therein, is an obstacle to amending the Temporary Restraining Order further to require that the list of inmates in the Medically Vulnerable Subclass include ICD codes. The Byrne decision suggests, and the statute and HIPAA regulations make clear, that a disclosure made in response to a court order, as opposed to a subpoena issued by a litigant, would not expose the person subject to the court order to liability. Nonetheless, as Respondents asked to file a proposed order on this point, the Court will await making further amendments to the temporary restraining order until the Respondents file the proposed language, provided they do so promptly.As discussed, by close of business on Tuesday, May 19, 2020, the parties are directed to submit a joint proposal regarding the format and logistics of the preliminary injunction hearing, including whether any part of the proceeding should be conducted in the courtroom. The Court will issue a further order regarding the hearing after it receives this input from the parties. Signed by Judge Michael P. Shea on 5/14/2020. (Karpman, Michael) (Entered: 05/14/2020)"

          "description": "ORDER. The Court held a telephonic status conference today to discuss issues related to the Respondent's compliance with the Court's TRO, ECF No. 30. During the call, the Petitioners indicated that they knew of multiple individuals who qualified as medically vulnerable under Paragraph 1 of the TRO (which references CDC criteria), but who were not included on the list of medically vulnerable inmates that Respondent used to select inmates for prioritized review for home confinement, as required by the TRO. Petitioners indicate that they believe that additional searches are necessary to identify additional medically vulnerable inmates they believe to be present at FCI Danbury who are not on the current list. The Respondent indicated a willingness to conduct a further search to identify additional medically vulnerable inmates, although the Respondent took the position that the Petitioners' proposed search parameters were overbroad. Given that additional searches are likely necessary to identify all of the medically vulnerable inmates at FCI Danbury for prioritized home confinement review (as required by Paragraphs 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the TRO), that further additional time will be necessary to review those inmates for home confinement, and that further inquiry is necessary to determine whether the Respondent has otherwise fully complied with the TRO, the Court finds that there is good cause under Rule 65(b)(2) to extend the temporary restraining order by 14 days, through June 9, 2020.As discussed during today's call, the parties shall meet and confer regarding the most effective and efficient process for identifying as many of the remaining medically vulnerable inmates at FCI Danbury as possible. The parties should also discuss whether and how a person with medical expertise should be involved in the home confinement review process, in light of the requirement under the TRO that the Respondent assign substantial weight to an inmate's COVID-19 risk factors in the review process. The parties shall file a status report regarding their discussions by close of business on May 27. The Court will hold a telephonic status conference on May 28, 2020 at 11:00 a.m. to discuss these issues.As further discussed, the Respondent shall also file a notice by close of business on May 27, under seal, indicating the release status of each of the 26 inmates that have been approved for home confinement.

          "description": "ORDER. For the reasons discussed on the call (and the Court may issue a short, further explanatory ruling in the future), the parties are ordered to meet and confer to develop a form of release that would allow inmates identified in the sample group to choose whether or not to disclose their presentence reports to Petitioners' counsel in this action. Under the Supreme Court's decision in U.S. Dept. of Justice v. Julian, 486 U.S. 1 (1988), it is clear that an inmate has the right under the FOIA to obtain his or her own presentence report, and thus also to authorize its disclosure to Petitioners' counsel--who seek to represent a class of inmates including the inmates in the sample--so that Petitioners' counsel can pursue the inmate's interests in this case. In light of the important private and public interests at issue in this case, and the apparent role of these presentence reports in the Respondent's decisionmaking process, Petitioners' have made a compelling demonstration that disclosure, in the manner described above, is necessary to meet the ends of justice. The release form should indicate that any presentence reports disclosed to Petitioners' counsel under these authorizations will be treated with strict confidentiality, and, more specifically, will be disclosed only to Petitioners' counsel, Petitioners' counsel's expert witness, Respondent's counsel, Respondent's counsel's expert witness, and the Court. Should inmates in the sample authorize such disclosure, the Respondents shall produce the presentence reports of such inmates to Petitioners' counsel. Petitioners' request to obtain inmates' Statements of Reasons is denied for the reasons discussed on the call. In addition, for the reasons discussed on the call, the Respondent shall produce to Petitioners' counsel the names of the inmates who were in the group of an estimated 159 inmates (referred to in the Warden's declaration, ECF No. 24-2 at 23) who were reviewed for home confinement between March 26 and May 5, 2020. Further, as discussed, Petitioners shall file a Rule 21 motion to add parties by June 9, 2020. Signed by Judge Michael P. Shea on 6/5/2020. (Karpman, Michael) (Entered: 06/05/2020)"

The Court has received letters, sent directly to chambers, from a number of inmates at FCI Danbury regarding their individual case for home confinement or other individual circumstances. These letters do not appear to be objections to the proposed settlement, and so the Court will not consider, respond to, or docket them. The Court will also not serve as a conduit between inmates at FCI Danbury and Petitioner's counsel, and will therefore not forward any such letters received to Petitioner's counsel. Potential or actual class members are advised to follow the instructions provided in the approved notice (ECF Nos. 141-1, 141-2), and shall not send letters directly to chambers. The Court will not respond to or take action on such correspondence. See ECF No. 141 at para. 12 (\"Objectors should not send materials to the undersigned's chambers.\") (emphasis in original).

While counsel for both sides should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the settlement agreement and all issues raised in the objections, the Court asks that the parties be prepared, in particular, to address the following: (1) The manner in which the home confinement review process has been functioning since the settlement agreement was signed; (2) the extent to which the Respondent is currently following each of the practices mentioned in the Side Letter; (3) how age, and especially inmates who are over 65 (or turn 65) but are not on List One or List Two (e.g., because they are recent arrivals or turned 65 after the lists were created), will be handled as a risk factor in the home confinement review contemplated by the settlement; (4) what the parties have in mind by \"compel specific performance of this Agreement\" (Settlement Agreement, parag. 23f.), given that, under the Agreement, the Court will prohibited from relying on its powers of contempt; (5) whether the Agreement would allow for reevaluation of an inmate previously denied home confinement should there be a change in the CDC's guidance concerning risk factors suggesting that the inmate's vulnerability is greater than previously understood; and (6) the objection filed by counsel for Joshua Lenchick -- see ECF No. 174 and see in particular paras. 3 & 4. The Court will allow Mr. Lenchick's counsel to participate in the hearing as to topic #6. The parties should not interpret these topics as the Court's expression of a view about the fairness, reasonableness, or adequacy of the settlement. Signed by Judge Michael P. Shea on 9/16/2020.

          "description": "ORDER: On September 18, 2020, the Court approved the class settlement following a fairness hearing. (ECF No. 221.) In light of the Court's approval of the settlement and its findings at the hearing, it disposes of the remaining pending motions in this case as follows: The motion for preliminary injunction (ECF No. 14) and motion for sanctions (ECF No. 83) are DENIED in light of the settlement and releases and the Court's findings at the fairness hearing. The emergency motion to intervene (and for other relief) by Andrew Mackey (ECF No. 114) is DENIED, because, to the extent Mr. Mackey is or will in the future become a member of the class, the Court already considered his interests at the fairness hearing, and to the extent he is not, he is not so situated that disposing of the action in his absence will impair or impede his ability to protect his interests; he also does not sufficiently share a common question of law or fact with the class members given that the Court made no determination in this case (even a preliminary determination by way of temporary restraining order) regarding the claims of non-class members. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 24, to the extent it applies in a habeas proceeding. The interest of judicial economy would not be furthered by adjudicating his claims as part of this case. Mr. Mackey is free, of course, to bring his own independent action seeking whatever relief he deems appropriate. (Forms for self-represented parties are available on the Court's website.) The emergency motion to intervene and motion to amend emergency motion to intervene by Bernice Mackey (ECF Nos. 146 & 159) is DENIED for the same reasons, and because she likely lacks standing to join this habeas proceeding. The motion to intervene by Deric Twitty (ECF No. 203) is DENIED for the same reasons as those recited in the denial of Mr. Mackey's motion; as for Mr. Twitty's objection to the settlement, the Court considered it and similar objections before approving the settlement at the fairness hearing. The motion to amend the complaint (ECF No. 208) is DENIED because it was not filed by class counsel, who are the only authorized representatives of the class, the only recognized plaintiffs in this action. Further, to the extent Mr. Wallace is making objections to the settlement, the Court considered those and similar objections before approving the settlement at the fairness hearing; and to the extent he is not a member of the class, he remains free to bring his own action. The motions to intervene by Mr. Jackson (ECF Nos. 209 & 210) are DENIED for similar reasons, i.e., to the extent he is a member of the class, the Court considered his interests at the fairness hearing; to the extent he is not, he is free to bring his own action and he does not satisfy Rule 24 for the reasons set forth above with respect to Mr. Mackey; and to the extent he is stating objections to the settlement, the Court considered those and other similar objections before approving the settlement at the fairness hearing. The motions for a copy of the settlement agreement (ECF Nos. 213 & 215) are DENIED, as the Court was advised at the fairness hearing by both the defendant and class counsel that the settlement agreement had been made available to all inmates in accordance with this Court's previous orders. To the extent the motions also stated objections to the settlement, the Court considered them and others like them before approving the settlement at the fairness hearing. Finally, Mr. Mackey's emergency motion for bail (ECF No. 225) is DENIED for the reasons set forth above with respect to Mr. Mackey; again, Mr. Mackey is free to bring his own action at any time.Signed by Judge Michael P. Shea on 9/30/2020. (Super, John) (Entered: 09/30/2020)"

P. 11(a) (\"Every pleading, written motion, and other paper must be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney's name--or by a party personally if the party is unrepresented.\"). It is not clear whether or not Mr. Mackey is a member of the class -- in which case he would not have standing to file this motion; but even if he is, the motion must be filed by class counsel. In any case, Mr. Mackey's motion does not comply with the settlement agreement's dispute resolution provision, which provides a multi-tiered approach to resolving any dispute prior to seeking judicial review.

          "description": "ORDER: The Court has been advised that there has been a complication regarding the release of Ms. Hechtman, one of the 17 inmates who was previously approved by the BOP for home confinement and was the subject of the Courts December 11, 2020 order. Specifically, the Court was advised by Respondent's counsel that one of the persons at whose home Ms. Hechtman was proposing to stay has refused to host her. During a conference call with counsel today, Petitioner's counsel represented that, in light of the apparently increasing spread of COVID-19 at FCI Danbury, she would be willing to host Ms. Hechtman in a safe space at her home in the New Haven area on a furlough (see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3622) while another home confinement or other appropriate release plan is vetted and approved by the BOP. Accordingly, consistent with its December 11, 2020 order, to provide for specific performance of the Settlement Agreement, and for reasons that will be more fully explained in a forthcoming opinion, the Court hereby orders the Respondent to release Ms. Hechtman to the care of Attorney Sarah Russell, as a 30-day furlough, beginning as soon as Attorney Russell or Sean McElligott arrives at FCI Danbury to pick up Ms. Hechtman. During the 30-day furlough, the Respondent shall make it a top priority to vet and approve an appropriate home or community confinement plan for Ms. Hechtman. In the event that Respondent is unable to do so, however, Ms. Hechtman shall return to FCI Danbury no later than the 30th day following her release. At all times, Ms. Hechtman's sentence will remain intact and she will remain subject to the authority of the Bureau of Prisons. Signed by Judge Michael P. Shea on 12/14/2020.

Mr. Milchin's 306 motion is hereby DENIED because all such filings on behalf of petitioner or the class must be made by class counsel. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(a) (\"Every pleading, written motion, and other paper must be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney's name--or by a party personally if the party is unrepresented.\"). Thus, if Mr. Milchin is a member of the class, as he asserts, the motion must be filed by class counsel; if he is not a member of the class, then he would not have standing to file this motion. Mr. Milchin's motion also does not comply with the settlement agreement's dispute resolution provision, which provides a multi-tiered approach to resolving any dispute prior to seeking judicial review. (See ECF No. 238-1 at 16-17).Signed by Judge Michael P. Shea on 1/4/2021. (Super, John) (Entered: 01/04/2021)"

Banks is currently an inmate at FCI Oakdale and previously filed a pro se motion to extend certain orders from Whitted v. Easter (3:20-cv-569-MPS) to the inmates at FCI Oakdale, located in Louisiana. I returned Banks' submission to him with an order that provided as follows: \"Generally, under § 2241, a prisoner challenging his confinement must file his petition in his district of confinement. Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. 426, 443 (2004). Likewise, under the statute's jurisdiction of confinement rule, district courts may only grant habeas relief against custodians 'within their respective jurisdictions.' 28 U.S.C § 2241(a). Because FCI Oakdale is not within the District of Connecticut, I do not have jurisdiction to grant habeas relief to you or other inmates housed at FCI Oakdale under section 2241.\" Banks' reliance, for jurisdictional purposes, on the transfer of former FCI Danbury inmates to FCI Oakdale is misplaced. Banks does not indicate that he was ever confined at FCI Danbury, and he provides no basis for the Court to exercise jurisdiction over his motion to join Whitted v. Easter, a case that has settled and was closed as of October 20, 2020.Signed by Judge Michael P. Shea on 2/11/2021. (Super, John) (Entered: 02/11/2021)"

The 370 motion to seal, filed in error, is DENIED as moot.The 360 motion for law student appearance is hereby GRANTED.The pro se motions filed by Robert Armstrong (ECF No. 346) and Savino Braxton (ECF Nos. 361, 368) are DENIED because all such filings on behalf of petitioner or the class must be made by class counsel. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(a) (\"Every pleading, written motion, and other paper must be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney's name--or by a party personally if the party is unrepresented.\"). Thus, if Armstrong and Braxton are members of the class, the motion must be filed by class counsel; if they are not members of the class, then they would not have standing to file this motion. Armstrong and Braxton's motions also do not comply with the settlement agreement's dispute resolution provision, which provides a multi-tiered approach to resolving any dispute prior to seeking judicial review.

In light of the Government's status reports filed on April 16, 2021, (ECF Nos. 379, 380), the Court finds that the equitable relief requested in ECF No. 350 (i.e., an order compelling the BOP to re-review 5 specific inmates for home confinement) is not warranted at this time. In so finding, the Court relies on the Government's representations that: (1) M.S. does not have a recognized medical counterindication to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and therefore may receive that vaccine; and (2) the 5 inmates (including M.S.) discussed during the April 9, 2021 hearing -- who previously declined the COVID-19 vaccine but are now willing to receive it when offered -- will be offered the opportunity to receive a COVID-19 vaccine this week. In addition, based on the Government's representations made during the April 9, 2021 hearing, the Court understands that the Government will view these 5 inmates as eligible for home confinement review to the same extent as any other class member under the Settlement Agreement who has received the first dose and is not yet fully vaccinated so long as each of the 5 inmates are offered, and accept, the COVID-19 vaccine.Defendant shall file an additional status report on the docket no later than April 23, 2021 at noon. The status report shall include: (1) whether FCI Danbury received the expected shipment of COVID-19 vaccines this week; (2) whether the 5 individuals discussed during the April 9, 2021 hearing were offered, and if offered whether they accepted, a COVID-19 vaccine this week; and (3) an update as to FCI Danbury's progress in vaccinating its general inmate population.

The undersigned was made aware while the Court still had jurisdiction of the fact and content of these motions, as well as other filings, such as the Petitioner's Objection to Magistrate Judge Farrish's Recommended Ruling, and chose not to accord them priority among all the work assigned to him, because, in his view, none of these motions or other filings presented situations that were as urgent, meritorious, or otherwise worthy of his time and attention as other matters he was dealing with at the time. In other words, the undersigned did not ignore these filings and had he concluded that any of these motions or other filings presented a situation warranting the Courts full attention before the agreement expired, he would have adjudicated them prior to that time. The motion to seal (ECF No. 421) is GRANTED because it contains private medical information of individuals. The Clerk is directed to terminate the motion symbol next to ECF No. 408 because it is not a motion.Signed by Judge Michael P. Shea on 11/16/2021. (Wong, Qing Wai) (Entered: 11/16/2021)"

          "description": "ORDER: Nothing in this order should be taken as any indication about how the Court will rule on the petition or motion for temporary restraining order/preliminary injunction. The Government must file its responses to the order to show cause and the motion for temporary restraining order/preliminary injunction by 6pm on May 5, 2020. (The time was inadvertently omitted from the Court's previous order.) The parties shall be prepared to argue the motion for temporary restraining order/preliminary injunction at the telephonic hearing scheduled for 1pm on May 6. To facilitate preparation for that argument, and to facilitate any relief the Court might order after the argument and/or after further proceedings, the parties shall be prepared to discuss the following legal and factual issues. To the extent these questions can only be answered by the Government, Government counsel shall make diligent efforts before the call to obtain answers: 1. Do the provisions of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3626 apply to this case, i.e., is this a \"civil action with respect to prison conditions\"? Relatedly, is the relief petitioners are seeking a \"prisoner release order\"? See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3626(g)(2),(4).2. Although the Second Circuit has \"conclude[d] that the class action device should not be imported into collateral actions, as least in its full vigor as contemplated by Rule 23,\" it has recognized \"the power of the judiciary... to fashion for habeas actions appropriate modes of procedure, by analogy to existing rules or otherwise in conformity with judicial usage.\" U.S. ex rel. Sero v. Preiser, 506 F.2d 1115, 1125 (2d Cir. 1974). In Preiser, the court allowed \"a multi-party proceeding similar to the class action\" on behalf of young adults serving misdemeanor sentences, because \"many of those serving reformatory sentences are likely to be illiterate or poorly educated,\" \"most would not have the benefit of counsel to prepare habeas corpus petitions,\" and \"considerable expenditure of judicial time and energy in hearing and deciding numerous individual petitions presenting the identical issue is thereby avoided.\" Id. at 1126; see also id. at 1127 (\"And although we believe that more stringent standards may be appropriate in deciding whether a habeas action presents substantial and common questions of law or fact, it is apparent that the complaint of the representative parties in this suit states a clear and unitary allegation on behalf of all young adult misdemeanants.\"). To what extent does this habeas petition satisfy these criteria for \"a multi-party proceeding similar to the class action,\" given that the requested relief includes \"bail,\" \"enlargement,\" or \"release\" and that such relief ordinarily requires the assessment of the individual circumstances of the applicant, cf. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3142(g)(3) (directing the court to consider, among other things, \"the history and characteristics of the person\" when making release determinations)?3. What is the current population and capacity of each of the three facilities at FCI Danbury?4. What is the availability of extra space that might be outfitted for living or quarantine space at each of the three facilities? 5. For each of the three facilities at Danbury FCI, how many written requests based on the circumstances presented by COVID-19 have been made for temporary release, home confinement, or compassionate release (under 18 U.S.C. Secs. 3622, 3624, 3582(c)(1)(A), the CARES Act, or any other authority)? And for each facility, (1) how many such requests have been granted either by the BOP or by the Court, and (2) how many inmates have actually been released - whether it be to home confinement, a half-way house, or otherwise? 6. Which of the named petitioners have sought the relief in paragraph 5, what types of relief have been sought, and what is the status of any requests/motions? (The Court will ask this question first of Petitioners' counsel.)7. How long would it take the Warden to respond to a court order requiring the production of a list of all inmates at each of the three facilities falling within the subclass defined by the petitioners or an alternative subclass based on the CDC's guidance as to vulnerable persons, see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html? This is not a comprehensive list of the questions the Court will ask. Counsel should be prepared on all issues raised in their papers. Signed by Judge Michael P. Shea on 5/3/2020.

    "summary": "<p>On April 27, 2020, four individuals held at the Federal Correctional Center (FCI) in Danbury, Connecticut filed this putative class action at the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut. Represented by the Legal Clinic of the Quinnipiac University School of Law, Yale Law School's Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization, and private attorneys, they brought the lawsuit against FCI Danbury and the Federal Bureau of Prisons as a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2241, as an injunctive action, and as a declaratory action under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2201-02. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants failed to take appropriate measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, resulting in confinement conditions that violated their Eighth Amendment rights.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs proposed a class of all detainees held or to be held in the custody of FCI Danbury. They also proposed a subclass of detainees aged 50 and over, or those medically vulnerable. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and/or a writ of habeas mandating the release or immediate home confinement of medically vulnerable detainees, and the implementation of safety measures against the risk of disease and death posed by COVID-19. Pending the habeas actions, the petitioners sought an \"enlargement\" of custody for detainees to home confinement as a provisional remedy. The case was assigned to Judge Micheal P Shea.</p>\r\n<p>The four plaintiffs were at higher risk of serious harm due to underlying medical conditions such as lupus, asthma, and hypertension. On April 30, 2020, the petitioners requested an emergency temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to implement measures to reduce the density of the population and maximize social distancing. They also sought preliminary certification of the proposed class for that order. On May 5, the respondents filed for a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, arguing that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust available administrative remedies.</p>\r\n<p>On May 12, 2020, the court denied the defendant's motion to dismiss. 2020 WL 2405350. It found that neither the PLRA (Prison Litigation Reform Act) or res judicata precluded the relief sought, and excused the plaintiffs from the exhaustion of administrative remedies, finding that they had shown that they would likely suffer irreparable harm if they were required to exhaust the administrative remedy process before seeking relief in court.</p>\r\n<p>In the same opinion, the court also granted in part and denied in part the motion for a temporary restraining order. The court ordered a filing of a list of &ldquo;medically vulnerable inmates at Danbury FCI,&rdquo; defined as individuals in custody aged over 65 and/or who have underlying medical conditions specifically identified by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control as a higher risk for COVID-19, and ordered the implementation of home confinement process for those individuals within three days. The court also ordered a timely process of evaluating compassionate release based on COVID-19 within seven days. Finally, the court ordered an individualized explanation for each denial of home confinement and a status report to be submitted to the court within thirteen days.</p>\r\n<p>During a telephonic status conference held on May 26, 2020, the plaintiffs indicated that they knew of multiple individuals who qualified as medically vulnerable but who were not included on the list of medically vulnerable inmates that the defendants listed for home confinement, as required by the TRO. The defendants indicated a willingness to conduct a further search to identify additional medically vulnerable inmates. Therefore, the court ordered an extension of the deadline for compliance with the temporary restraining order by fourteen days, through June 9.</p>\r\n<p>Another status conference was held on May 28, 2020, and the parties agreed to confer on a possible agreement on matters including home confinement review by a medical clinician, usage of a medical record code that allows automatic qualification for the medically vulnerable subclass, and a means of identifying inmates who should be included in the subclass but are not captured by the code. The court ordered the parties to submit a notice that would describe any agreements on these matters and indicate whether court intervention is needed by June 2.</p>\r\n<p>The court also found that while more than two weeks had passed since the May 12 temporary restraining order, there has not been a single release to home confinement. Therefore, it ordered defendants to either release to home confinement all those listed as eligible for home confinement or provide a safety reason against home confinement by June 4 to ensure full compliance with the order. Additionally, the court discussed with both parties its need to better understand the home confinement review process under the temporary restraining order and ordered submission of any agreement about a process to generate a random sample of the records by June 4, 2020. Finally, the court agreed with the plaintiffs that mistakes may have caused the denial of home confinement for certain individuals and ordered re-review for home confinement by June 9.</p>\r\n<p>On May 29, 2020, the court addressed the plaintiff&rsquo;s request to take similar action with respect to those inmates already determined to be appropriate for placement in a Residential Reentry Center (RRC). 2020 WL 2813072. Recognizing that the schedule for such placement is unclear and that social distancing may still be inadequate at a communal half-way house, the court granted the plaintiff&rsquo;s request in part. The defendants were ordered to release to home confinement those who were approved for community placement at an RRC, as long as they did not have a violent offense of conviction, a sexually-related offense of conviction, or a high-risk assessment score, or provide a safety reason against home confinement by June 9.</p>\r\n<p>On June 8, 2020, the plaintiffs moved for sanctions against the defendant, seeking an order that would preclude the defendants from disputing that FCI Danbury&rsquo;s system for responding to sick call requests was inadequate and untimely.</p>\r\n<p>Late in June, the named plaintiffs filed a voluntary dismissal and on June 15 the court dismissed their claims. On June 16, the plaintiffs filed an amended habeas petition with new named plaintiffs. The case was then referred to Judge Thomas O. Farrish for settlement purposes. Two plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims on July 29.</p>\r\n<p>On July 27, 2020, the parties reported that they had come to a settlement agreement and that they planned to file a joint motion to certify the settlement class by August 3. Under the agreement, once identified as medically vulnerable, the defendant would consider the individual's suitability for home confinement. A medical clinician either employed or appointed by the BOP would verify that all medical conditions are identified for the home confinement review, and the review process would follow the standards previously outlined in the temporary restraining order, including speedy consideration for release to home confinement and substantial weight provided to each individual&rsquo;s COVID risk factors. The agreement was tentatively scheduled to terminate on October 31, 2021. The plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class for settlement purposes on August 3, which was granted on August 11. 2020 WL 4605224.</p>\r\n<p>On August 25, 2020, an individual filed a motion to intervene, which was denied by the court three days later because the individual was not incarcerated at Danbury FCI, was not a member of the provisionally certified class, had no interest in a settlement between the Warden at FCI Danbury and a class of inmates at that facility, and a habeas relief was not available to those housed at BOP facilities not located within the District of Connecticut.</p>\r\n<p>Between the end of August and beginning of September, 2020, multiple putative class members filed objections to the settlement.</p>\r\n<p>On September 11, 2020, the plaintiffs submitted a motion for final approval of the class action settlement. After a fairness hearing, the court approved the class action settlement agreement on September 18.</p>\r\n<p>In light of the Court's approval of the settlement and its findings at the hearing, it dismissed the remaining pending motions, including the motion for preliminary injunction and the motion for sanctions. The court also denied multiple emergency motions to intervene, amend the complaint, or for bail because the filers either were or would become members of the class and if not, disposing of the action in their absences would not impair or impede their ability to protect their interests.</p>\r\n<p>On October 12, 2020, pursuant to the settlement agreement, the parties jointly filed a motion to dismiss the case. The court retained jurisdiction over the settlement to the extent necessary to enforce its terms.</p>\r\n<p>On December 6, 2020, the plaintiffs moved to enforce the settlement agreement and require the defendants to immediately release medically vulnerable class members who were approved for home confinement. The court granted the motion on December 11, finding that the defendants breached the agreement. 2020 WL 7297016. The court stated that the defendants were barred from delaying the transfer of any class member beyond fourteen days without communicating with the plaintiffs' counsel within 5 days of the fourteen-day period.</p>\r\n<p>On December 17, 2020, the plaintiffs moved again to enforce the settlement agreement; the court granted this motion in part and denied it in part on January 19, 2021. 2021 WL 165015. The court ordered that the parties meet and identify specific class members whose cases warranted re-review and ordered that the defendants re-review the identified inmates for home confinement within fourteen days.</p>\r\n<p>On April 19, 2021, the court denied the plaintiffs' request that BOP be ordered to re-review 5 class members for home confinement. The court requested that the defendant file another status report within four days.</p>\r\n<p>On October 31, 2021, the settlement agreement expired, per the terms of the agreement. When the government subsequently moved to terminate the settlement agreement, the court denied the motion on the grounds that the agreement had already expired, ending the court&rsquo;s jurisdiction. (For the same reason, the court later denied an inmate's motion for a status conference.</p>\r\n<p>This case is now closed.</p>",

That city, within the New York City \nmetropolitan area, is part of the epicenter of our nation’s struggle with the novel COVID-19 \nvirus and resulting coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”). \nAs COVID-19 ravages the New York Metropolitan area, the risks posed by COVID-19 to \npeople confined in prisons, working in prison, and their communities are stark and alarming. For \nreasons beyond their control, people in jails and prisons cannot practice social distancing, control \ntheir exposure to large groups, practice increased hygiene, wear protective clothing, obtain \nspecific products for cleaning or laundry, avoid high-touch surfaces, or sanitize their own \nenvironment. And those problems are no more evident than at FCI Danbury, a prison consisting \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 2 of 69\n \nof a men’s low security complex, a women’s low-security satellite facility, and a women’s \nminimum security satellite facility, which has been one of the hardest hit prisons run by the \nFederal Bureau of Prisons nationwide. \nPetitioners bring this action against the Warden of FCI Danbury and the Director of the \nFederal Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) on behalf of themselves and the class of prisoners held at \nFCI Danbury who are at imminent risk of contracting COVID-19, which feeds on precisely the \nunsafe, congregate conditions in which they are held. Respondents are aware of the grave \ndangers posed by COVID-19 and have failed to implement measures to comply with their \nconstitutional obligations to those in their custody. Because of their unlawful and \nunconstitutional confinement, Petitioners seek emergency orders requiring a two-part response, \nthe immediate transfer of the most medically vulnerable individuals to home confinement or \nother appropriate settings and immediate implementation for those who remain of the social \ndistancing and hygiene measures essential to lowering the risk of the disease and of death.  \nPARTIES  \n1.  Petitioner Jackie Madore, BOP Register Number 08721-036, is a 50 year-old \nwoman who, at all times relevant herein, has been in the custody of the BOP at FCI Danbury, \nand is currently housed in the low security satellite facility (“FSL”). She transferred to that \nbuilding to participate in the Residential Drug Abuse Program (RDAP), which is currently \nsuspended. Ms. Madore is at heightened risk of mortality from COVID-19 due to hypertension. \nShe also suffers from hypothyroidism, and hepatitis C. \n2.  Petitioner Amanda Cooper, BOP Register Number 76357-067, is a 42 year-old \nwoman who, at all times relevant herein, has been in the custody of the BOP at FCI Danbury, \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 3 of 69\n \nand is currently housed in FCI Danbury’s women’s minimum security camp.  Ms. Cooper has \nType II diabetes with diabetic neuropathy.  She also has multiple pulmonary embolisms, deep \nvein thromboses requiring lifelong anti-coagulation, NASH liver disease, Stage II, and a history \nof seizures and strokes.  She is also morbidly obese.  She also has a medical restriction limiting \nher to the first floor of the institution, but that limitation cannot be accommodated because \nprisoners are in below grade dorms.  Each of these conditions places Ms. Cooper at dramatically \nheightened risk of death from COVID-19; the combination of all these conditions creates \nexponential danger. \n3.  Petitioner James Whitted, BOP Register Number 83830-054, is a 41 year-old man \nwho, at all times relevant herein, has been in the custody of the BOP at FCI Danbury and is \ncurrently housed in the men’s facility in the main prison.  Mr. Whitted suffers from asthma for \nwhich he currently uses two medicated inhalers.  He is also morbidly obese.  In 2018, Mr. \nWhitted suffered a fall which resulted in head trauma, spinal damage, and permanent injury to \nhis left leg for which he requires a custom brace.  As a result of his injury he is required to use a \nwalker and a cane to ambulate.  He is in need of physical therapy to maintain leg function but has \nnot received any such therapy since the onset of the COVID-19 lockdown at FCI Danbury. \n4.  Respondent Diane Easter is the Warden at FCI Danbury and has oversight \nresponsibility for all three units in the facility. As Warden of FCI Danbury, Respondent Easter is \nresponsible for and oversees all day-to-day activity at FCI Danbury, and all aspects of the \noperation and of the functioning of FCI Danbury. Her responsibilities include ensuring the safety \nof all in the institution and ensuring the orderly running of the institution. Respondent Easter is \naware of the harms of COVID-19, but she has adopted and enforced a policy that leaves \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 4 of 69\n \nPetitioners and all those similarly situated exposed to infection, severe illness, and death due to \nCOVID-19. Respondent Easter is the immediate physical custodian responsible for the detention \nof the Petitioners at FCI Danbury. She is sued in her official capacity. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 because \nPetitioners seek relief from being held in custody in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution. \n6.  In addition, the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this Petition pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question) in that the Petitioners’ claims arise under the federal statute \nproviding for habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. § 2241, and under Article I, § 9, cl. 2 of the U.S. \nConstitution (Suspension Clause), as Petitioners are held in violation of the Eighth Amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution.   \n7.  Venue is proper in the District of Connecticut pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) \nbecause a substantial part of the events and omissions giving rise to these claims occurred and \ncontinue to occur in this district. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n8.  Petitioners bring this representative habeas action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 \nand as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on their own \nbehalf and on behalf of all persons similarly situated. \n9.  Petitioners seek to represent a class consisting of all individuals currently in \ncustody at FCI Danbury or who will become in custody at FCI Danbury during the course of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic (the “Class”). \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 5 of 69\n \n10.  Petitioners also seek to represent a subclass (the “Subclass”) consisting of all \nindividuals in custody at FCI Danbury or who will become in custody at FCI Danbury during the \ncourse of the COVID-19 pandemic who are aged 50 or over and/or who have serious underlying \nmedical conditions that put them at particular risk of serious harm or death from COVID-19, \nincluding but not limited to people with respiratory conditions such as chronic lung disease or \nasthma; people with heart disease or other heart conditions; people who are \nimmunocompromised as a result of cancer, HIV/AIDS, or for any other reason; people with \nchronic liver or kidney disease, or renal failure (including hepatitis and dialysis patients); people \nwith diabetes, epilepsy, hypertension, blood disorders (including sickle cell disease), or an \ninherited metabolic disorder; people who have had or are at risk of stroke; and people with any \ncondition specifically identified by CDC, currently or in the future, as increasing their risk of \ncontracting, having severe illness, and/or dying from COVID-19. \n11.  The members of the Class and Subclass are too numerous to be joined in one \naction, and their joinder is impracticable. Upon information and belief, the class exceeds 1,000 \nindividuals. \n12.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all Class and Subclass members and \npredominate over questions that affect only the individual members. These common questions of \nfact and law include but are not limited to: (1) whether the conditions of confinement described \nin this Petition amount to Constitutional violations; (2) what measures Respondents took in \nresponse to the COVID-19 crisis; (3) whether Respondents implemented an adequate emergency \nplan during the COVID-19 crisis; (4) whether Respondents’ practices during the COVID-19 \ncrisis exposed people at FCI Danbury to a substantial risk of serious harm; (5) whether the \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 6 of 69\n \nRespondents knew of and disregarded a substantial risk of serious harm to the safety and health \nof the Class; and (6) what relief should be awarded to redress the harms threatened to members \nof the Class as a result of the conditions. \n13.  Absent class certification, individuals detained at FCI Danbury during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic would face a series of barriers in accessing the relief sought. FCI Danbury \nhas suspended visitation and FCI Danbury prisoners have limited access to communication with \nthe outside world, impeding their ability to obtain legal representation and to pursue remedies, \nincluding through litigation. A large portion of the Class and Subclass has limited educational \nbackgrounds. And a significant percent of them suffer from physical or mental impairments. For \nsome, English is not their first language. \n14.  Respondents’ practices and the claims alleged in this Petition are common to all \nmembers of the Class and Subclass. \n15.  The claims of Petitioners are typical of those of the Class and Subclass. \nPetitioners are threatened with imminent inhumane conditions of confinement at FCI Danbury. \n16.  The legal claims of Petitioners are the same or similar to those of all Class and \nSubclass members, and the harms suffered by them are typical of those suffered by all the other \nClass members. \n17.  Petitioners will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class and \nSubclass. The interests of Petitioners as class representatives are consistent with those of the \nClass and Subclass members. In addition, counsel for Petitioners are experienced in class action \nand civil rights litigation. \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 7 of 69\n \n18.  Counsel for Petitioners know of no conflicts of interest among Class or Subclass \nmembers or between the attorneys and Class members that would affect this litigation. \n19.  Prosecuting separate actions by individual class members would create a risk of \ninconsistent or varying adjudications that could establish incompatible standards of conduct for \nthe party opposing the Class.  \n20.  The party opposing the Class has acted and refused to act on grounds generally \napplication to the Class, such that final injunctive and declaratory relief is appropriate as to the \nClass as a whole. \n21.  Use of the class action mechanism is superior to other available methods for the \nfair and efficient adjudication of the claims and will prevent the imposition of undue financial, \nadministrative, and procedural burdens on the parties and on this Court, which individual \nlitigation of these claims would impose. \n22.  This class action is superior to any other method for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this legal dispute, as joinder of all Class and Subclass members is impracticable. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nI.  Petitioners Are Members of the Population Particularly Vulnerable to COVID-19 \n \n23.  Petitioners, current detained at FCI Danbury, are individuals who are particularly \nvulnerable to serious illness or death if infected by COVID-19. \n24.  Petitioner Jackie Madore is a 50-year-old female who suffers from hypertension, \nhypothyroidism, and Hepatitis C. As a result of her hypertension alone, without consideration of \nthe complicating effects of her other conditions, she has a substantially elevated risk of severe \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 8 of 69\n \nillness or mortality in the event she contracts COVID-19 while confined at FCI Danbury.1 As a \nresult of her medical condition, Ms. Madore has effectively been condemned to serve her \nsentence at substantial risk of serious illness or death. The Judgment in her criminal case only \nsentences Ms. Madore to an additional 20 months in prison. As a result of his medical condition, \nthere is a grave risk that he will not make it out of FCI Danbury alive or will become terribly ill.  \n25.  Petitioner Amanda Cooper is a 42 year-old woman with a significant number of \nrisk factors putting her at high risk of severe illness or death in the event she contracts COVID-\n19.  Ms. Cooper has significant cardiovascular issues, including deep vein thromboses requiring \nlifelong anti-coagulation, hypertension, and multiple pulmonary embolisms, which also impact \nher respiratory function.  She also has Type II diabetes with diabetic neuropathy.  She suffers \nfrom Stage II NASH liver disease.  She has a history of seizures and strokes.  She is also \nmorbidly obese.  She is on multiple medications for these conditions.  Ms. Cooper is disabled as \na result of her medical conditions and requires accommodation on the first floor where she does \nnot have to use stairs.  But FCI Danbury currently cannot accommodate her disabilities because \nprisoners in the FSL where she resides are housed in below grade dorms due to COVID-19.   \n26.  As a result of her medical condition, Ms. Cooper has effectively been condemned \nto serve her sentence at substantial risk of serious illness or death. Pursuant to the above-cited \nWHO-China Joint Mission Report, each of these conditions puts Ms. Cooper at significantly \nelevated risk of mortality in the event she should contract COVID-19: The mortality rate for \nhypertension is 8.4%; the mortality rate for chronic respiratory disease is 8.0%, the mortality rate \nfor cardiovascular disease is 13.2%.2 Moreover, a recent study found that obesity was the single \n                                                 \n1 See id.    \n2 See id, \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 9 of 69\n \nbiggest chronic risk factor for hospitalization for COVID-19.3 COVID-19 infection in a patient \npresenting with all four medical conditions will undoubtedly be deadly.4  As a result of her \nmedical condition, there is a grave risk that Ms. Cooper will not make it out of FCI Danbury \nalive or will become terribly ill. \n27.  Petitioner James Whitted is a 41 year-old man with a significant number of risk \nfactors putting her at high risk of severe illness or death in the event he contracts COVID-19.   \nMr. Whitted suffers from asthma for which he currently uses two medicated inhalers.  He is also \nmorbidly obese.  As a result of a fall that caused spinal damage and permanent injury to his left \nleg, he requires a custom brace and must use a walker and a cane to ambulate.  He is in chornic \npain that has not been managed since he has been in the custody of the BOP.  He is in need of \nphysical therapy to maintain leg function but has not received any such therapy since the onset of \nthe COVID-19 lockdown at FCI Danbury and is at risk of significant loss of mobility.  As a \nresult of his medical condition, there is a grave risk that he will not make it out of FCI Danbury \nalive or will become terribly ill. \nII.

As of April 23, 2020, the BOP reports that 1,046 people were held at FCI \nDanbury. They were divided among the units as follows: 165 women are incarcerated at the \nsatellite prison, 153 women are incarcerated at the camp, and 728 men are incarcerated at the \nmen’s prison.5 \n1.  Women’s FSL \n29.  The women in the satellite facility (“FSL”) are housed in a single dormitory-style \nroom that accommodates approximately 160-170 beds. [Declaration of Christina Korbe, \nsubmitted herewith as Exhibit E (“Korbe Decl.”) ¶ 8]. The room is divided into cubicles, each \ncontaining two bunk beds, separated by approximately four feet. [Declaration of Marius (Marie) \nMason, submitted herewith as Exhibit F (“Mason Decl.”) ¶ 7; Declaration of Kimberly \nHoisington, submitted herewith as Exhibit G (“Hoisington Decl.”) ¶ 4]. Beds in each cubicle are \nimmediately adjacent to the cubicle wall, which does not reach to the ceiling. In some instances \nthe wall does not even reach the top of the bunk bed, so women on the top bunk sleep right next \nto the woman on the top bunk in the adjacent cubicle. [Mason Decl. ¶ 7; Korbe Decl. ¶ 10]. \na.  All of the women in the FSL share the same three bathrooms, each of which \nincludes between 4-8 toilets, sinks, and showers. [Mason Decl. ¶ 10; Korbe Decl. \n¶ 8].  \nb.  The FSL also includes a common area where the women have access to 6-12 \nshared phones (not all of which are working) and 6 shared computers (only 4 of \nwhich are working), which are located in close proximity to one another. [Korbe \nDecl. ¶ 11; Mason Decl. ¶8]. \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 11 of 69\n \nc.  The women in the FSL eat meals together in the dormitory. Meals are brought to \nall of the prisoners in the dormitory at the same time.  \nd.  On April 25, around 40 women were moved from the dorm area to sleep in the \ndining hall/kitchen area.  \ne.  On information and belief, there is no medical staff permanently assigned to the \nFSL or available 24 hours a day. A doctor and a physician’s assistant rotate \nbetween the three FCI Danbury facilities and are there during limited hours on \nweekdays. In order to request medical care, a requester must go to “pill call” in \nthe morning, where a pharmacy technician dispenses medications, and fill out a \nsick call slip. The requester must then wait until she is called in to be seen, which \ncan take weeks. Emergencies require a call from a correctional officer for a \nmedical professional to come to the FSL. Prior to the pandemic, there were two \npsychologists who were at the FSL on a daily basis, but they have rarely been \npresent since the pandemic (as psychology programming has been canceled).    \n \n2.  Women’s Camp \n30.  The women at the camp occupy a single building divided into four dormitories, \neach containing 25 cubicles with bunk beds sleeping two each, and nine rooms that can each \nhold 4 to 5 women. Prior to the lockdown of the facility on April 15, there were approximately \n43 women housed in the nine rooms. After the lockdown, those women were moved to the \n                                                                                                                                                             \n5  See BOP, “Population Statistics” (last updated Apr. 23, 2020), \nhttps://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/population_statistics.jsp  \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 12 of 69\n \ndormitories. [Declaration of Dianthe Martinez-Brooks (“Martinez-Brooks Decl.”), submitted \nherewith as Exhibit C ¶¶ 4-5]. \na.  The cubicles in the dormitories—which currently house all of the women in the \ncamp—have no doors and their dividing walls do not extend to the ceilings. In \nmany cubicles, the beds are positioned perpendicular to the partitions and extend \nthe full width of the cubicle. In this configuration, the partition is the only \nseparation between the beds. Even where beds are placed parallel to the partition, \nthere is not six feet of separation between them. [Id. ¶ 7]. \nb.  As of April 21, 2020, A and B dorms each house 48 women; C dorm houses 47 \nwomen and D Dorm houses 7. Each dorm has a common area containing toilets, \nsinks and showers. A dorm has 4 showers and three toilets. B dorm has 5 working \ntoilets and 6 showers; C dorm has 5 toilets and 5 showers. D Dorm has 3 toilets \nand three showers.  [Id. ¶¶ 6-7]. \nc.  There are four phones, 7 computers for email, and 3 working video-visiting \nmachines, clustered together in a single common area shared by the entire \npopulation of the camp. The common area also contains hot water taps and sinks \nfor washing dishes. [Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 9]. \na.  The camp is currently on lockdown. Pursuant to the lockdown, the women in each \ndorm unit are permitted to leave the dorm for 45 minutes in the morning and one \nhour later in the day, at different times. They can use the facilities in the common \nroom during these times. Within these short time periods, the 47-48 woman \ncensus of A, B, and C dorm must each negotiate the sharing of the four common \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 13 of 69\n \nphones, the 7 computers and 3 video chat machines. [Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ \n11]. \nb.  Recently, women who are out of their dorm during their designated recreation \ntime have been going to visit friends in other dorms. [Martinez-Brooks Decl., ¶ \n15]. \nd.  There is no actual medical clinic in the camp and there is no medical staff \npermanently assigned to the camp or available 24 hours a day. Rather, there are a \nseries of offices: two are used by medical staff, one by dental staff, and one by \npsychology. During this lockdown, a sick call request is made to physician’s \nassistants when they come to the unit in the morning to dispense medications and \nthe requester must wait until she is called in—often days later.  Emergencies \nrequire a call from a correctional officer for a medical professional to come to the \ncamp.  [Id. ¶ 21]. \n3.  Men’s Prison \n31.  The men’s facility contains 13 units, comprised of 10 units designed for \ndormitory-style housing and three units of individual cells. There is also a Special Housing Unit \nfor solitary confinement.  \na.  The dormitory units (designated C through L Units) consist of rows of bunk beds \nlined in two rows three to four feet apart across a middle aisle, with no barriers \nbetween the beds.  [Declaration of Kenneth Cassidy (“Cassidy Decl.”), submitted \nherewith as Exhibit D ¶ 32]. A man in that unit would, therefore, sleep within 3-4 \nfeet of five other men. [Id.]. The average dorm unit would also contain a \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 14 of 69\n \nbathroom with 5 stalls and a urinal, 5-6 sinks (generally consisting of five cold-\nwater wash sinks and a single hot-water slop sink for washing eating utensils) and \na shower area approximately two feet across a hall from the toilets with three to \nfour showers. [Id. ¶ 33]. The sinks are located approximately four inches apart \nand people occasionally have to share the same sink.  [Id.]. \nb.  The dorms also contain 2 television rooms, approximately 10 x 12 feet that can \naccommodate approximately 20 prisoners each and typically hold 15-20 people at \na time.  [Id. ¶ 35]. There is also a small telephone room, approximately 3 x 8 feet, \ncontaining two telephones. The telephones, which are about eight inches apart, are \nalmost always in use. When two prisoners are using the telephones, they have to \nstand within two feet of each other. Typically, there are two prisoners on the \nphones, and the rest wait in a line in the hallway, standing right next to each other, \nclose enough to touch each other. [Id. ¶ 36]. \nc.  There is also a small computer room in each dorm measuring approximately 8 x \n10 feet containing three computers, an eating table and an ice dispenser. There are \nno barriers between the computers and, at any given time, there will be three \npeople in the room using the computers, three people standing behind them in the \nroom waiting to use the computers, and several more lined up shoulder to \nshoulder outside the room. [Id. ¶ 37]. \nd.  The three units of individual cells (A, B and M Units) consist of two floors of \ncells measuring 8 x 4 feet, containing a bunk bed for two men with a toilet/sink.  \n[Declaration of Rafael Almonte, submitted herewith as Exhibit H (“Almonte \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 15 of 69\n \nDecl.”), ¶ 6]. Prior to the emergence of COVID-19 in the facility, only one of the \ncell block units (M Unit) was in use and housed primarily military veterans, older \nmen and those with serious medical conditions. A second cellblock (A Unit) has \nsince been devoted to prisoners who are positive for coronavirus.  [Almonte Decl. \n¶ 17]. The facility has also activated one of the dorms (K Unit)—which had \npreviously been emptied because of the need for asbestos remediation—to serve \nas an isolation unit at the prison. [Id. ¶ 4; Cassidy Decl. ¶ 42]. B Unit has since \nbeen converted to serve as a quarantine unit for individuals being released or sent \nto home confinement. \ne.  The cellblock units also contain a TV room that can accommodate 30 men who sit \nclose together and a computer room containing 3 stations right next to one \nanother. There are also two small rooms containing one phone each. [Almonte \nDecl. ¶ 8]. \nf.  There is a single medical clinic for men at FCI Danbury. Before the outbreak, it \nwas typically staffed by one physician and two physician assistants. The physician \nfrom the women’s facilities would occasionally come to the men’s prison to see \npatients. [Almonte Decl. ¶ 11]. Since the lockdown, a social worker is coming \ninto the units to conduct sick call triage of men exhibiting symptoms. [Cassidy \nDecl.  ¶ 18]. At times she brings along the prison’s dental hygienist. [Id.] The \nclinic is not staffed by medical staff 24 hours a day.  \ng.  There is also a dining hall in the men’s prison that serves all of the units in the \nprison. The men’s prison also includes an outdoor space for recreation (“rec \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 16 of 69\n \nyard”).  The space is accessed through a single 4 foot wide door and men entering \nand exiting the rec yard must line up in close proximity to file through the door.  \nDuring recreation, prisoners stand right next to one another and are unable to \nobserve social distancing.  [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 29]. \nB.  COVID-19 Outbreak at FCI Danbury  \n32.  FCI Danbury is in the center of the global COVID-19 storm. The United States \ncurrently has the greatest number of infections of any country in the world. As of April 27, 2020, \nthere were approximately 966,000 reported COVID-19 cases and more than 55,000 deaths in the \nUnited States.6 And, the New York City metropolitan area, in which FCI Danbury is located, is \ncurrently at the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in this country. As of April 27, 2020, there \nare over 422,000 positive cases of COVID-19 in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey. As of \nthat date, there have been 30,000 deaths in those three states, representing 55% of the total \nconfirmed deaths from COVID-19 reported nationwide.7 In New York City and the seven \ncounties most proximate to FCI Danbury (Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess and Nassau counties \nin New York and Fairfield, Litchfield and New Haven counties, Connecticut), there were an \naggregate of 242,000 cases of COVID-19 and 21,000 deaths. Id. In Connecticut alone, the \nConnecticut Department of Public Health (\"DPH\") has reported that, as of April 27, 2020, in \nConnecticut, there were 25,269 confirmed cases and 1,924 deaths attributed to COVID-19.  \nFairfield County, where FCI- Danbury is located has the highest number of confirmed cases of \n                                                 \n6  COVID-19 Dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns \nHopkins University (JHU), https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html. \n7  Id. \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 17 of 69\n \nCOVID-19 and deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the state: as of April 27, 2020, there were \n10,529 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 707 COVID-19 associated deaths.8  \n33.  FCI Danbury is the site of one of the worst COVID-19 outbreaks at BOP facilities \nnationwide. As of April 15, at least 44 prisoners and 39 staff members have or had tested \npositive for COVID-19.9 One person incarcerated at FCI Danbury has died of COVID-19. On \nApril 24-26, 2020, at least two women from the FSL were brought to the hospital because of \nsevere COVID-19 symptoms. On information and belief, at least ten more women in the FSL \ntested positive during those same days.  \n34.  The incidence rate at Danbury exceeds 2.8% of the total prisoner population at the \nfacility—among the highest concentrations of positive tests per capita of any facility in the \nBureau of Prisons network.   \n35.  The incidence of staff COVID-19 infections at FCI Danbury is likewise, among \nthe highest incidence per capita of staff infections in the BOP system.    \n36.  The BOP reports the number of positive cases for inmates and staff at each \nfacility on its website. But the BOP’s numbers do not include people who previously tested \npositive for COVID-19 and have since been deemed recovered by BOP.10 The BOP provides no \nexplanation as to what qualifies as “recovery.” \n37.  BOP’s data does not state where the incarcerated people who tested positive have \nbeen housed, and who may have been exposed to staff members who have tested positive.   \n                                                 \n8  See https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Coronavirus/CTDPHCOVID19summary4232020.pdf?la=en  \n9 See Laura Cassels, COVID-19 deaths in federal prisons rise to 15; about 700 staff and inmates \nsick, Phoenix, April 15, 2020, https://www.floridaphoenix.com/2020/04/15/covid-19-deaths-in-federal-\nprisons-rise-to-15-about-700-staff-and-inmates-sick/     \n10 Federal Bureau of Prisons, https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/  \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 18 of 69\n \n38.  As set forth in detail below, see paragraphs 131-141, there is ample evidence to \nindicate that FCI Danbury appears to be avoiding testing prisoners who present with symptoms \nof COVID-19 infection. \n39.  COVID-19 is at Danbury and individuals are infected. What cannot be known is \nhow many currently have the infection or exposure. In the absence of any information from the \nBOP about the number of tests actually administered at FCI Danbury and the criteria employed \nat that institution to determine whether and when to perform COVID-19 testing, no reliable \ninformation is public about the degree to which the infection has spread at FCI Danbury. \n40.  Respondents have failed to prioritize medically vulnerable prisoners for release to \nhome confinement or to other destinations appropriate to reduce population density at FCI \nDanbury and enhance opportunities for social distancing.   \n41.  On information and belief, Respondents have also reversed prior determinations \nto release medically vulnerable individuals pursuant to de-densification efforts and have advised \nmedically-vulnerable individuals who had previously been notified that they were to be released \nto home confinement that they are no longer eligible for such release because they had not \ncompleted one-half of their sentences.  \n42.  Further, on information and belief, FCI Danbury has indefinitely suspended the \nadministrative remedy process; staff informed prisoners that, due to the state of emergency under \nwhich the facility is operating, staff are unavailable to review, investigate and respond to \ngrievances. [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 25]. \n43.  FCI Danbury is grossly ill-equipped to identify, monitor, and treat a COVID-19 \nepidemic. The combination of an epidemic striking a facility that houses over 1,000 people and \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 19 of 69\n \nFCI Danbury’s inability to provide appropriate medical care under normal circumstances is \nlikely to result in serious illness and death, if people remain confined there at current population \nlevels and under current conditions. \n44.  At current facility population levels, prisoners at FCI Danbury cannot comply \nwith the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) guidelines for physical distancing, \na “cornerstone” of risk reduction in prisons.11 \n45.  As long as prisoners are unable to practice physical distancing, any other \nmitigating steps will fail to decrease meaningfully the risk of COVID-19 infections at FCI \nDanbury. \n46.  The failure to implement appropriate social distancing measures has led to the \ncreation of crisis conditions at FCI Danbury. \n47.  On April 24-26, 2020, several prisoners at the FSL have shared an account of a 43 \nyear-old woman housed at the satellite facility whose serious symptoms, including profuse \nvomiting and dry heaving, over several hours, were disregarded by correctional staff before she \nwas finally taken to the hospital. [See Korbe Decl. ¶¶ 16-17; Hoisington Decl. ¶¶ 16-17].  \na.  The woman at issue had been sick for a couple of weeks with a sore throat and \nbody aches. \n                                                 \n11  See CDC, Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- \n19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities (Mar. 23, 2020), at 4 (“CDC Interim Correctional Facility \nGuidance”) (“Although social distancing is challenging to practice in correctional and detention \nenvironments, it is a cornerstone of reducing transmission of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19”); \nid. (“Social distancing is the practice of increasing the space between individuals and decreasing the \nfrequency of contact to reduce the risk of spreading a disease (ideally to maintain at least 6 feet between \nall individuals, even those who are asymptomatic.”), available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 20 of 69\n \nb.  On April 24, she said that she couldn’t breathe and that her lungs felt like they \nwere filling with fluid. She began vomiting, and was vomiting, dry heaving, and \nviolently struggling for air for hours. At one point she had to be wheeled in a \nwheelchair by a correctional officer from the bathroom because she couldn’t \nwalk. \nc.  Other prisoners tried to advocate for her to receive medical treatment and were \ntold that the hospital can’t take her unless she’s dying, and that the prisoners \nwould get disciplinary reports and get locked down if they continued advocating \non her behalf. The prisoners were told that they were not doctors and were \ninstigating the sick woman’s behavior. \nd.  By late at night on April 24 or early morning on April 25, the sick woman had \nbeen taken to the hospital. At the hospital, she tested positive for COVID-19. \ne.  The next day on April 25, roughly 40 inmates who were determined to have had \nrecent contact with the sick prisoner were moved out of the dormitory into a \nseparate area of the facility and were tested for COVID-19. \nf.  On information and belief, at least ten of those inmates tested positive for \nCOVID-19. \ng.  Thereafter, all of the prisoners who had been removed from the dormitory \nreturned for some time to gather their personal property, use phones and \ncomputers, use bathrooms, and take showers. On information and belief, even \nafter they were removed to isolation, several of these women were able to return \nto the dormitory to gather snacks and other belongings.  \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 21 of 69\n \nh.  The phones, computers, and bathrooms were not sanitized immediately \nafterwards. \ni.  The other inmates in the dormitory are using these same phone, computers, and \nbathrooms. \nj.  Some inmates who had contact with the sick woman were not among those \nremoved from the dormitory and are still living there. \nk.  As a result of failure to implement social distancing and to plan for contagion \nwithin the facility, FCI Danbury had no appropriate location to isolate the women \nwho newly-tested positive for COVID-19 and was required to take those women \nto sleep in the dining hall/kitchen. \nl.  Prisoners have been warned that they will get disciplinary reports if they tell \nanyone about what is going on in the facility. A prisoner who relayed information \nabout the sick woman to her attorney via phone was given a disciplinary report for \nsharing information about another prisoner. \n48.  FCI Danbury is undergoing a serious outbreak and worse will likely follow with \ndevastating consequences for Petitioners and other vulnerable prisoners, correctional staff, local \nhealth care workers, their families, and the broader community. \nIII.  Prisons Are Especially Susceptible to COVID-19 Contagion \n49.  The COVID-19 virus is highly infectious and can be spread “easily and \nsustainably” from person-to-person.12 The virus can live on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 72 \n                                                 \n12 See Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, How COVID-19 Spreads (accessed Apr. 3, \n2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/transmission.html.  \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 22 of 69\n \nhours, and, powered by a single cough or sneeze, can be propelled in a gas cloud that extends up \nto 27 feet in length.13 \n50.  To date, the virus is known to spread from person to person through respiratory \ndroplets, close personal contact, and from contact with contaminated surfaces and objects, where \nthe virus can survive for up to three days. Critically, people who are asymptomatic or pre-\nsymptomatic can unknowingly transmit the virus, making it particularly difficult to slow its \nspread.  [Declaration of Jaimie Meyer, M.D. submitted herewith as Exhibit A (“Meyer Decl.”) ¶ \n20]. \n51.  There is no vaccine against COVID-19 and there is no known medication to \nprevent or treat infection from COVID-19. Social distancing, or remaining physically separated \nfrom known or potentially infected individuals, and vigilant hygiene, including washing hands \nwith soap and water, are the only known effective measures for protecting vulnerable people \nfrom COVID-19.   \n52.  As a result, the only assured way to curb the pandemic is through dramatically \nreducing contact for all. Consequently, every American institution—from schools to places of \nworship, from businesses to legislatures—has been exhorted or ordered to reduce the number of \npeople in close quarters, if not to empty entirely.14 People also have been told to undertake \n                                                 \n13  Neeltje van Doremalen et al., Aerosol and Surface Stability of SARS-CoV-2 as Compared with \nSARS-CoV-1, NEW ENG.

In light of this public health crisis, in late March 2020, the Governors of New \nYork and Connecticut took the strictest measure yet to fight the virus’s spread. In recognition \nthat the most effective way to reduce the spread of the virus, they issued “stay at home” \nexecutive orders for all residents and banned all non-essential public gatherings.16 \n54.  People in congregate environments, where people live, eat, and sleep in close \nproximity, face increased danger of contracting COVID-19, as evidenced by the rapid spread of \nthe virus in cruise ships and nursing homes.   \n55.  Indeed, the CDC has identified prisons, along with nursing homes, long-term care \nfacilities, group homes, and cruise ships, as environments that are especially susceptible to rapid \noutbreaks of infection due to close person-to-person contact among large, confined \npopulations.17 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), https://cutt.ly/KtRPk1k; Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers to Plan and Respond to Coronavirus Disease \n2019 (COVID-19), https://cutt.ly/stRPvg4; Nat’l Conf. of State Legislatures, Coronavirus and State \nLegislatures in the News, https://cutt.ly/4tRPQne.

Spaces within jails and prisons are often poorly ventilated; the lack of ventilation \npromotes highly efficient spread of diseases through droplets. [Meyer Decl. ¶ 9]. \n57.  Prisoners and staff interact in close proximity under cramped conditions that are \ndesigned to confine people rather than distance them; as a result, correctional facilities are highly \nsusceptible to rapid transmission of the virus through contact, including asymptomatic carriers \nwho show no signs of illness, and common surfaces. \n58.  Absent significant de-densifying, people who are confined in prisons, jails, and \ndetention centers, as well as staff, will find it impossible to engage in the necessary social \ndistancing and hygiene required to mitigate the risk of transmission. [Meyer Decl. ¶¶ 9, 11]. \n59.  As one court, quoting another, recently summarized the problem: “Prisons are \n‘powder kegs for infection’ and have allowed ‘the COVID-19 virus [to] spread[] with \nuncommon and frightening speed,’” United States v. Salvagno, 5:02cr00051-LEK (N.D.N.Y. \nApr. 23, 2020) (Doc. 1166 at 8) (quoting United States v. Skelos, No. 15-CR-317, 2020WL \n1847558, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 12, 2020)).18  \n60.  Correctional settings also increase the risk of contracting and spreading an \ninfectious disease, like COVID-19 because they typically house high numbers of people with \nchronic, often untreated underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, chronic \nlung and liver diseases, asthma, and lower immune systems from HIV. This chronic underlying \n                                                 \n18 Editorial, No One Deserves To Die of COVID-19 in Jail:  But More Than 100 Inmates Already \nHave, N.Y.

Indeed, outbreaks of the flu regularly occur in prisons, and during the H1N1 \nepidemic in 2009, many jails and prisons dealt with high numbers of cases.20 \n62.  Prisons are not isolated from communities, and infections in prisons give rise to \nthe risk of “community spread.” Even when prison visitors are reduced, staff, contractors and \nvendors go from prisons to communities and can bring infectious diseases into facilities and then \ninto communities. The turnover of prison populations means that people cycle in and out, as well \nas transfer from one facility to another.     \n63.  Such movement creates an ever-present risk that persons, including asymptomatic \ncarriers, will carry the virus into and out of those facilities, spread infection, and trigger \noutbreaks inside and in communities. Prison health is an issue of public health as what happens \nin prison has widespread ramifications beyond the walls of the prison.

Evidence of the degree of risk in prisons is mounting. The estimate is that recent \noutbreaks in the Cook County Jail in Chicago and at the Rikers Island Jail in New York are the \nhighest transmission rates for COVID-19 in the world.22 As of April 20, 2020, eight hundred \nNew York City correctional employees had tested positive and eight had died. Including \nprisoners, there have been 10 deaths and more than 1,200 confirmed cases in New York City’s \njails.23 \n65.  In Arkansas, 38% of the positive COVID-19 cases in the state are concentrated in \none prison, which has 850 confirmed cases.24 \n66.  As of April 26, 2020, at least 12,613 people in jails and prisons had tested positive \nfor the illness.25 The number of new cases among prisoners is more than doubling each week.  \nThe “curve,” which may be flattening due to social distancing in some localities, is not flattening \nin prison; to the contrary, the virus is soaring in prisons.26 \n67.  Sixteen prison systems—including the Federal Bureau of Prisons which has \nalready experienced major outbreaks throughout its network—are not releasing information \n                                                                                                                                                             \nbroader community, our jails will act as vectors for the COVID-19 pandemic in our communities.”). \n22 See Alleen Brown, Inside Rikers: An Account of the Virus-Stricken Jail from a Man Who \nManaged to Get Out, Intercept, April 21 2020, https://theintercept.com/2020/04/21/coronavirus-rikers-\nisland-jail-nyc/; Timothy Williams & Danielle Ivory, Chicago’s Jail Is Top U.S. Hot Spot as Virus \nSpreads Behind Bars, N.Y.

Therefore, the data of more than 12,000 people in prison and jails testing positive \nis most likely a significant undercount.  \n69.  In Ohio, mass testing of everyone at the Marion Correctional Institution revealed \n1,828 confirmed cases among prisoners, which represents 73% of the population. One hundred \nand nine staff members at the facility were also positive.29   \nIV.  COVID-19 Infection in the Prison Demographic Is Deadly \n70.  Many incarcerated individuals are at heightened risk of serious illness and death \nfrom COVID-19 because their demographic profile and histories make them part of a cohort that \nis especially vulnerable. People over the age of fifty face greater chances of serious illness or \ndeath from COVID-19. In a February 28, 2020, WHO-China Joint Mission Report, the \npreliminary mortality rate analyses showed that individuals age 60-69 had an overall 3.6% \nmortality rate and those 70-79 years old had an 8% mortality rate. For individuals 50-59, the \nmortality rate was 1.3%. For individuals age 40-49, the mortality rate was 0.4%, and for \nindividuals 40 years and younger, the mortality rate was 0.2%.30 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n26 See Error!

People of any age who suffer from certain underlying medical conditions, \nincluding lung disease, heart disease, chronic liver or kidney disease (including hepatitis and \ndialysis patients), diabetes, epilepsy, hypertension, compromised immune systems (such as from \ncancer, HIV, or autoimmune disease), blood disorders (including sickle cell disease), inherited \nmetabolic disorders, stroke, developmental delay, and asthma, are at elevated risk as well.31  \n72.  The WHO-China Joint Mission Report provides that the mortality rate for those \nwith cardiovascular disease was 13.2%, 9.2% for diabetes, 8.4% for hypertension, 8.0% for \nchronic respiratory disease, and 7.6% for cancer.32 \n73.  In many people, COVID-19 causes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. But for \npeople over the age of fifty or with medical conditions that increase the risk of serious COVID-\n19 infection, shortness of breath can be severe.  \n74.  Most people in higher risk categories who develop serious illness will need \nadvanced medical help and support. This level of supportive care requires highly specialized \nequipment that is in limited supply, and an entire team of care providers, including 1:1 or 1:2 \nnurse to patient ratios, respiratory therapists, and intensive care physicians.33 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nCritically-Ill-With-Covid-19 (in study of 6,750 patients admitted to critical care, finding that majority of \npatients over 60 died in critical care).  \n31  Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) advice for the public: Myth busters, World Health \nOrganization, https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-\nbusters (“Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart \ndisease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.”). \n32 WHO-China Joint Report at 12, https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-\nchina-joint-mission-on-covid-19- final-report.pdf (finding fatality rates for patients with COVID-19 and \nco-morbid conditions to be: “13.2% for those with cardiovascular disease, 9.2% for diabetes, 8.4% for \nhypertension, 8.0% for chronic respiratory disease, and 7.6% for cancer”). \n33  Kevin McCoy and Katie Wedell, ‘On-the-job emergency training’: Hospitals may run low on \nstaff to run ventilators for coronavirus patients, USA TODAY (Mar. 27, 2020), available at \nhttps://bit.ly/2V7rLsS. \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 29 of 69\n \n75.  COVID-19 can severely damage lung tissue, which requires an extensive period \nof rehabilitation, and in some cases, can cause a permanent loss of respiratory capacity. COVID-\n19 may also target the heart muscle, causing a medical condition called myocarditis, or \ninflammation of the heart muscle. Myocarditis can affect the heart muscle and electrical system, \nreducing the heart’s ability to pump. This reduction can lead to rapid or abnormal heart rhythms \nin the short term, and long-term heart failure that limits exercise tolerance and the ability to \nwork. \n76.  Emerging evidence also suggests that COVID-19 can trigger an over-response of \nthe immune system, further damaging tissues in a cytokine release syndrome that can result in \nwidespread damage to other organs, including permanent injury to the kidneys and neurologic \ninjury. These complications can manifest at an alarming pace. Patients can show the first \nsymptoms of infection in as little as two days after exposure, and their condition can seriously \ndeteriorate in as little as five days or sooner. \n77.  Even some younger and healthier people who contract COVID-19 are susceptible \nto severe strokes and may require supportive care, which includes supplemental oxygen, positive \npressure ventilation, and in extreme cases, extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation.34 \n78.  The need for care, including intensive care, and the likelihood of death, is much \nhigher from COVID-19 infection than from influenza. According to recent estimates, the fatality \nrate of people infected with COVID-19 is about ten times higher than a severe seasonal \n                                                 \n34 See Young and middle-aged people, barely sick with covid-19, are dying of strokes, WASH \nPOST.

Most people in high-risk categories who develop serious illness require advanced \nmedical support, including specialized equipment, such as ventilators, and large teams of highly \ntrained care providers, such as ICU doctors, nurses, and respiratory therapists. [Meyer Decl. ¶ \n22]. The artificial ventilation process is itself invasive and dangerous, and some patients must be \nplaced in medically induced comas for such treatment.  \n80.  Given the need for advanced and urgent intervention, often in an ICU \nenvironment, people with severe cases of COVID-19 cannot be shackled or otherwise restrained, \nnor can they be subjected to constant, close supervision by correctional staff, as they would be in \na typical correctional setting.  \n81.  FCI Danbury is not equipped to provide advanced support in an ICU setting with \nventilators, certainly not for a substantial group of seriously ill prisoners who may require such \nspecialized care. \n82.  Patients who do not die from serious cases of COVID-19 may face prolonged \nrecovery periods, including extensive rehabilitation from neurologic damage, amputation due to \nclotting and reduced blood flow, loss of respiratory capacity, and tissue damage in other vital \norgans, including the heart and liver.36   \n                                                 \n35  Betsy McKay, Coronavirus vs. Flu Which Virus is Deadlier, WALL ST.

In sum, to buffer against the outbreak of a highly infectious, deadly virus in a \nclosed detention setting requires urgent and decisive action to protect the health of those \nconfined in the prison, those who work there, and the medical professionals who will treat those \nwho become infected. \nV.  Spread of Disease in BOP Facilities Requires De-Densifying and Providing Social \nDistancing for Those Who Remain  \n \n84.  Available statistics reveal a public health disaster erupting across BOP facilities \nthat worsens with each passing day.  \n85.  From March 20 to April 25, confirmed COVID-19 cases among BOP prisoners \nand staff rose from 2 to 1047 across 42 facilities nationwide. \n86.  Severe outbreaks at FCI Oakdale in Louisiana, FCI Elkton in Ohio, and FCI \nButner in North Carolina, already have resulted in dozens of confirmed COVID-19 infections \namong prisoners and staff, many more suspected but unconfirmed cases, and 22 prisoner deaths \nthroughout the system.37 \n87.  That surge of COVID-19 cases inside the federal prison system has dwarfed the \nnational percentage increase in confirmed cases over the same time period.38 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nPatients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), https://cutt.ly/etRPVRl; Melissa Healy, \nCoronavirus infection may cause lasting damage throughout the body, doctors fear, LA TIMES (Apr. 10, \n2020), available at https://cutt.ly/htNrJ77; see also Di Wu et al., Plasma Metabolomic and Lipidomic \nAlterations Associated with COVID-19, MEDRXIV 2020.04.05.20053819 (2020); Declaration of Dr. \nJonathan Golob, Dawson v.

Wash., Mar. 16, 2020), \navailable at https://cutt.ly/AtNrFOl. \n37  Current information about the census of COVID-19 positive prisoners and staff in the Bureau \nof Prisons system is maintained on a COVID-19 resource page on the Federal Bureau of Prisons website \navailable at https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus.  Historical statistics have been compiled and updated daily \nby the Federal Defenders of New York, Inc. and are available at https://federaldefendersny.org/. \n38  Comparisons of the respective increases in confirmed cases of COVID-19 over the last several \nweeks in the general and prison populations have likewise been compiled by the Federal Defenders of \nNew York, Inc. and are available at https://federaldefendersny.org/. \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 32 of 69\n \n88.  According to CDC guidelines, only two measures are known to be effective in \nreducing the spread of this disease: (1) diligent “social or physical distancing,” which involves \nkeeping at least six feet of space between people to avoid transmission of the virus, and (2) \nvigilant hygiene practices, including frequently washing hands and regularly disinfecting \nsurfaces. Physical distancing is a necessary predicate for hygiene practices to have any \nmeaningful impact.39   \n89.  Because asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people can transmit the virus to \nothers, it is critical to follow CDC guidelines, including social distancing, even among people \nwho show no signs of COVID-19 and appear to be healthy. \n90.  The only effective way to minimize the potential devastation from COVID-19 in \nBOP facilities generally and at FCI Danbury in particular is to downsize immediately the \nincarcerated population and, for the prisoners who remain at the institution, to undertake \naggressively the detection, prevention, and treatment measures that public health and medical \nexperts have recommended, including effective social distancing. \n91.  These measures are not possible in prisons, like FCI Danbury, without substantial \nreductions in the prisoner population. \n92.  What some officials call “modified lockdowns” are not what self-quarantining \nand social distancing entails. Prisoners and staff interact in many ways, and when facilities have \ndorm-like arrangements, prisoners sleep, eat, congregate, recreate, and receive medical treatment \nin close proximity. \n                                                 \n39  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html  \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 33 of 69\n \n93.  Implementation of necessary hygiene practices is also impossible, particularly \nwhen adequate supplies of free soap, sanitizers, disinfectants, and paper towels are not readily \navailable in prisons. [Meyer Decl. ¶¶ 9, 11, 39]. \n94.  Correctional public health experts have recommended the release from custody of \npeople most vulnerable to COVID-19 so as to protect them and permit risk mitigation for all \npeople held or working in facilities. Release of the most vulnerable people from custody also \nreduces the burden on the region’s health care infrastructure by reducing the likelihood that an \noverwhelming number of people will become seriously ill from COVID-19 at the same time. \n95.  Calling for immediate and extensive “efforts to decarcerate” to protect both \nprisoners and the general public, the New England Journal of Medicine explained: \nThe boundaries between communities and correctional institutions are porous, as \nare the borders between countries in the age of mass human travel. Despite \nsecurity at nearly every nation’s border, Covid-19 has appeared in practically all \ncountries. We can’t expect to find sturdier barriers between correctional \ninstitutions and their surrounding communities in any affected country. . . .To \npromote public health, we believe that efforts to decarcerate, which are already \nunder way in some jurisdictions, need to be scaled up; and associated reductions \nof incarcerated populations should be sustained. The interrelation of correctional-\nsystem health and public health is a reality not only in the United States but \naround the world.40 \n \n96.  Consistent with these public health recommendations, many jurisdictions have \nalready taken steps to protect those in custody from the impending spread of COVID-19 by \nreleasing people in an effort to reduce populations.41   \n                                                 \n40  Matthew J.

In New York City, public officials, the jail oversight board, and doctors working \nat Rikers Island have acknowledged that the City’s jails are unsafe and that releasing people is \nthe medically appropriate and humane option.42 See Statement of New York City Board of \nCorrection, March 17, 2020 (calling on the City to release people from criminal custody, \nprioritizing people over 50, those with underlying health conditions, detained for administrative \nreasons, and those who have been convicted and sentenced to one year or less).43   \n98.  On March 20, 2020, Dr. Robert Cohen, a member of New York City’s Board of \nCorrection, said, “The most important thing we can do right now is discharge all of the people \nwho are old and have serious medical issues — those people are likely to die from a coronavirus \ninfection.”44  \n                                                                                                                                                             \nto release 743 others who are within 6 months of completing their sentences; the governor of Oklahoma \nhas commuted the sentences of more than 450 people; the number of people being paroled from state \nprisons in Michigan has reportedly increased by about 1,000 people per month to reduce prison density \nduring the pandemic; and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation announced on \nMarch 31 that it would expedite the transition to parole for 3,500 nonviolent offenders with 60 days or \nless left on their sentences.   See Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, Prison Policy Initiative (Apr. 24, \n2020), https://www.prisonpolicy.org/virus/virusresponse.html. Numerous cities and counties have also \ntaken steps to reduce jail populations, including: from March 18 to April 15, 2020, the Washington, D.C., \njail population decreased by more than 21%; the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office in California has \nreleased 382 people from their two county jails, including those who are 65 and older; after an April 3, \n2020, ruling from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, almost 300 people were released from jails \nacross the state.

Several doctors working in New York City’s jails have echoed the calls to release \nvulnerable people. Dr. Rachael Bedard, senior director of the geriatrics and complex care service \nat Rikers Island, has described depopulation as “[t] he only meaningful public health \nintervention.”45 In correctional facilities, “if you think about how many excess human contacts \n[there are], even compared to something like a shelter setting, you can imagine why viral spread \nin this environment is extra dangerous.”   \n100.  Ross McDonald, the Chief Medical Officer for Correctional Health Services, \nwhich provides healthcare to New York City’s Department of Corrections, said Rikers was a \n“public health disaster unfolding before our eyes.” He stressed: “This is not a generational public \nhealth crisis, rather it is a crisis of a magnitude no generation living today has ever seen.” He also \nwarned that it was “unlikely” they will be able to stop the growth in the jail, and predicted that \n20% of those infected would need hospital treatment and 5% would need ventilators. He called \nfor the release of “as many vulnerable people as possible”46 \n101.  Members of Congress have, likewise, recognized the urgency of reducing prison \npopulations as a means of achieving social distancing in those institutions. On March 23, 2020, a \nbipartisan group of fourteen U.S. Senators sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Barr and BOP \nDirector Carvajal to express their “serious concern for the health and wellbeing of federal prison \nstaff and prisoners . . . especially those who are most vulnerable to infection.” The Senators \nwrote that they reviewed the BOP’s COVID-19 Action Plan and noted that it did not include any \n                                                 \n45  Jennifer Gonnerman, A Rikers Island Doctor Speaks Out to Save Her Elderly Patients From \nthe Coronavirus, New Yorker (Mar. 20, 2020), https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-rikers-\nisland-doctor-speaks-out-tosave-her-elderly-patients-from-the-coronavirus.  \n46 Miranda Bryant, Coronavirus spread at Rikers is a 'public health disaster', says jail's top doctor, \nTHE GUARDIAN (Apr. 1, 2020 10:36 am), Available at https://www.theguardian.com/us-\nnews/2020/apr/01/rikers-island-jail-coronavirus-public-health-disaster  \n35 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 36 of 69\n \nmeasures to protect the most vulnerable staff and prisoners. The Senators urged DOJ and BOP to \nrelease to home confinement certain individuals who were elderly, ill, or incarcerated for non-\nviolent offenses and are near release. \n102.  Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, founding Chairman and current member of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law (subsequently \nrenamed the Subcommittee on Constitution, Civil Rights, and Human Rights) and current \nranking member on the Subcommittee on Immigration has called on the federal government to \ntake action to protect staff and people detained in federal prisons. “Federal prisons will \ninevitably be a hotspot for the spread of coronavirus, especially among vulnerable staff and \nprisoners,” Durbin said. “It is imperative for BOP to take immediate action to protect staff and \nprisoners at federal prisons throughout the country and ensure that facilities are prepared to \naddress this threat.”47 \n103.  On March 27, 2020, Congress enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic \nSecurity Act (CARES Act, P.L. 116-136), which authorizes the BOP Director to lengthen the \nmaximum amount of time for which a prisoner may be placed on home confinement “as the \nDirector determines appropriate” when the Attorney General “finds that emergency conditions \nwill materially affect the functioning” of BOP. \n                                                 \n47  Durbin Discusses Coronavirus Threat At Federal Prisons With Council Of Prison Locals, \nDick Durbin United States Senator Illinois (Mar. 24, 2020), \nhttps://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-discussescoronavirus-threat-at-federal-\nprisons-with-council-of-prison-locals; Letter, \nhttps://www.durbin.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Letter.%20to%20DOJ%20and%20BOP%20on%20COVI\nD-19%20and%20FSA%20provisions%20-\n%20final%20bipartisan%20text%20with%20signature%20blocks.pdf \n36 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 37 of 69\n \n104.  The authority is limited to “the covered emergency period,” which is defined as \nthe period spanning from the President’s declaration of a national emergency with respect to \nCOVID-19 to the date that is 30 days after the date on which the declaration terminates.  \n105.  The United States Department of Justice has also called for urgent action to \nreduce prison populations in the BOP to achieve necessary social distancing. On March 26, \n2020, Attorney General William Barr sent a memo to the Director of BOP “directing [him] to \nprioritize the use of [his] various statutory authorities to grant home confinement for prisoners \nseeking transfer in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic” because “for some eligible \nprisoners, home confinement might be more effective in protecting their health.”48 \n106.  The Attorney General specifically recognized that “there are some at-risk \nprisoners who are non-violent and pose minimal likelihood of recidivism and who might be safer \nserving their sentences in home confinement rather than BOP facilities.”49   \n107.  Attorney General Barr further identified “[t]he age and vulnerability of the \nprisoner to COVID-19, in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n(CDC) guidelines,” and “the security level of the facility,” with “priority given” to prisoners \nincarcerated “in low and medium security facilities,” as two of the critical, discretionary factors \nfor consideration.

Attorney General Barr stated: “As you know, we are experiencing significant \nlevels of infection at several of our facilities, including FCI Oakdale, FCI Danbury, and FCI \nElkton. We have to move with dispatch in using home confinement, where appropriate, to move \nvulnerable inmates out of these institutions. I would like you to give priority to these institutions, \nand others similarly affected, as you continue to process the remaining inmates who are eligible \nfor home confinement under pre-CARES Act standards. In addition, the CARES Act now \nauthorizes me to expand the cohort of inmates who can be considered for home release upon my \nfinding that emergency conditions are materially affecting the functioning of the Bureau of \nPrisons. I hereby make that finding and direct that, as detailed below, you give priority in \nimplementing these new standards to the most vulnerable inmates at the most affected facilities, \nconsistent with the guidance below.”  \n110.  Attorney General Barr further recognized that, despite “extensive precautions to \nprevent COVID-19 from entering [BOP] facilities and infecting our prisoners,” those measures \n“have not been perfectly effective.” Accordingly, he ordered the BOP to take more aggressive \nsteps, immediately, to transfer prisoners to home confinement, even if electronic monitoring will \nnot be available. \n111.  Echoing the warnings of public health experts, Attorney General Barr stated: \n“Given the speed with which this disease has spread through the general public, it is clear that \ntime is of the essence.”  Id.   \n                                                 \n50  Memo from Attorney General to Director of Bureau of Prisons, April 3, 2020, \nhttps://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/docs/bop_memo_home_confinement_april3.pdf \n38 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 39 of 69\n \nVI.  Respondents Have Failed to Proceed as Promptly as Required in this Crisis to De-\nDensify and to Implement the Necessary Social Distancing at BOP Facilities and at \nFCI Danbury in Particular  \n \n112.  Notwithstanding Attorney General Barr’s statements, the recommendations of \npublic health officials and the efforts of multiple state jurisdictions to decarcerate their prison \npopulations, Respondents have failed to use the BOP’s available statutory authority to reduce the \npopulation of FCI Danbury to mitigate the severe risk posed by COVID-19. Instead, the facility \nhas reversed course, refusing to follow through with transfers to home confinement for \nindividuals previously identified for such home confinement based on their medical \nvulnerability, and failing to timely respond to requests for emergency compassionate relief or to \ntake other measures appropriate for a public health crisis. \n113.  According to the BOP’s website, from March 26 (the date of Attorney General \nBarr’s first memo) through April 25, the agency placed 1576 prisoners nationwide into home \nconfinement—which would constitute only 0.9 percent of the approximately 171,000 prisoners \ncurrently held in BOP custody.  However, the real number of those released to home \nconfinement may well be less. As the Wall Street Journal reported on April 23: “The bureau said \nit has started placing at least 1,440 of the roughly 175,000 prisoners it holds into home \nconfinement, but didn’t say how many of those people have actually been released.” Sadie \nGurman & Rebecca Davis O’Brien, Confusion Hampers Coronavirus-Driven Inmate Releases, \nWall Street Journal, April 23, 2020;51 see also Joseph Neff & Keri Blakinger, Few Federal \nPrisoners Released Under COVID-19 Emergency Policies: A Federal Judge Called the Bureau \nof Prisons Release Process “Kafkaesque”, The Marshall Project, Apr. 25, 2020 (only 1,027 \n                                                 \n51 Available at https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-clarifies-coronavirus-driven-\ninmate-releases-11587594242. \n39 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 40 of 69\n \nmore prisoners allowed to serve the rest of their sentence in home confinement since Attorney \nGeneral Barr’s April 3 urgent memo, “about half of 1 percent of the more than 174,000 people in \nthe bureau’s custody”).52 \n114.  The BOP has not disclosed the number of prisoners it typically released per day \nprior to Attorney General Barr’s memos, nor has it disclosed how many new prisoners have \nentered BOP custody during the same time period. In short, data from the BOP demonstrate that \nit is not releasing enough prisoners to protect federal prisons from COVID-19. \n115.  Indeed, despite concerns by government officials and public health experts, the \nBOP continues to transfer people from facility to facility. Those transfers increase the likelihood \nthat the virus will be transmitted within the incarcerated population.53 \n116.  On information and belief, the first person at FCI Danbury (then housed in the M \nUnit of the men’s prison) tested positive for COVID-19 on or about March 28, 2020.  [Almonte \nDecl. ¶ 12].  \n117.  Prior to testing positive for COVID-19, the individual was in contact with many \nprisoners and staff, necessitating a proper public health response to contain the infection, \nincluding the immediate introduction of social distancing and enhanced hygiene measures.  \n118.  However, as set forth above, the very configuration of the confined prison space \nwith sleeping quarters and all ancillary facilities in close physical proximity and multiple \nprisoners in the same physical space and requiring simultaneous access to the limited available \nresources, precludes the requisite social distancing without dramatic de-densification.  Under \n                                                 \n52 Available at https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/04/25/few-federal-prisoners-released-\nunder-covid-19-emergency-policies.  \n40 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 41 of 69\n \nexisting conditions, neither class members nor staff in any of the three units at FCI Danbury can \nstay at least six feet away from other people and, therefore, engage in effective social distancing, \nas called for by the CDC. \n119.  Moreover, FCI Danbury has failed to take appropriate action as set forth in the \nrelevant CDC Guidance in response to those tests confirming the existence of the virus within its \npopulation but rather, persisted in practices and policies which are contrary to social distancing \ndirectives and are inconsistent with the needs for enhanced hygiene.  \n120.  Respondents’ failures to adopt and implement adequate policies and procedures to \nprevent and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 fall into several broad categories which are \ndiscussed below. \nA.  Failures to Triage Cases, Diagnose and Isolate Disease   \n121.  If an incarcerated person exhibits symptoms of COVID-19, the CDC Guidance \ncalls for the individual to be immediately given a face mask, paced in isolation, provided a \nmedical evaluation and treatment, and evaluated for possible testing.  By contrast, FCI Danbury \nhas deliberately not sought out potential cases of coronavirus and has not implemented the \nmeasures called for by the CDC Guidance. By failing meaningfully to isolate prisoners and staff \nwho are positive for coronavirus, or who exhibit symptoms highly indicative of coronavirus and \npresent a substantial risk of infecting other prisoners and staff in the unit, the Respondents have \nbeen deliberately indifferent to the known serious medical needs of the Petitioner class.  \n                                                                                                                                                             \n53  Luke Barr, Despite Coronavirus Warnings, Federal Bureau of Prisons Still Transferring \nPrisoners: Sources, ABC News (Mar. 23, 2020, 1:22PM), https://abcnews.go.com/Health/warnings-\nbureau-prisons-transporting-inmates-sources/story?id=69747416    \n41 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 42 of 69\n \n122.  Since the lockdown began, sick call triage in the men’s facility is conducted by a \nsocial worker without medical training, and who is openly contemptuous of the men’s needs.  \n[Cassidy Decl. ¶ 18]54 \n123.  At men’s and women’s facilities, prisoners who present for sick call who do not \nexhibit fever are denied access to any further medical follow-up. [Id.; Korbe Decl. ¶¶ 4-6, \nHoisington Decl. ¶ 6].  \n124.  Prisoners who complain to staff of symptoms consistent with COVID-19—\nincluding coughing, congestion and shortness of breath—are routinely unable to obtain \nimmediate medical examination, are not tested for COVID-19, and are returned to the general \npopulation until their symptoms worsen. [Hoisington Decl. ¶¶ 5-7, 14-15; Korbe Decl. ¶¶ 7, 12; \nMason Decl. ¶ 19; Almonte Decl. ¶ 20].55 \n                                                 \n54   As Mr. Cassidy states: \nThe social worker, Ms. Adamson, has told us “you are all fucking children with nothing \nmore than a flu so stop your shit you’re not going home early.”  She has said, “if you did \nthe crime stop crying and do the time.”  She has said, “I don’t need medical training to \ntell you you’re not sick so go lay the fuck down.”  [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 18]. \n55  As Ms. Hoisington – who was subsequently hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection \nand a temperature of 102 degrees on admission [Hoisington Decl. ¶ 5, 8] – recounts:  \nI had been feeling sick for a couple weeks before I went to the hospital. I had put \nin a request to see medical, and had been given two different “idles” to miss \nprograms because I was sick. On March 26 I reported to staff that I wasn’t \nfeeling well ... I went to the medical clinic, but after waiting there for 45 minutes \nwithout being seen, I returned to my bunk.  A few hours later, I reported to staff \non duty that I was feeling worse.  I was told to lie back down.  By early in the \nmorning of March 27th, around 1 or 2am, I had such bad chest pain that I could \nnot sleep. I told the officer on duty, who called the command center, and then \ncalled an ambulance. [Id. ¶ 5-7] \n  Similarly, Ms. Korbe – who has been complaining of a headache, cough and lost sense of smell \nfor over a week, has not been screened for COVID-19 and has been maintained in general population \nthroughout. [Korbe Decl. ¶ 4].  Indeed, Ms. Korbe’s cough was so extreme that one of the psychologist \nupon hearing the cough told Ms. Korbe that she should be tested because she could be infecting others.  \nNotwithstanding that Ms. Korbe asked the one of the psychologists to assist her to obtain appropriate \ntesting, she has not, to date, been tested for COVID-19. [Id. ¶ 6].   \n42 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 43 of 69\n \n125.  FCI Danbury has further willfully refused to take temperatures or test for fever in \norder to avoid identifying cases of possible COVID infection.  [Almonte Decl. ¶ 15] \n126.  When prisoners have presented with likely fever, Respondents have on occasion \nfalsely discounted the readings of elevated temperatures in order to avoid taking appropriate \nfollow-up action, including, in particular, isolating the prisoner from the general population and \ntesting to confirm a coronavirus diagnosis.   \n127.  Methods employed by respondents to avoid appropriate follow-up in cases of \nlikely fever include, (1) falsely attributing the reading to equipment error; (2) falsely attributing \nthe reading to operator error; (3) falsely recording identical temperatures for every person tested \non a given unit; (4) “resetting” the thermometer while pretending to take another reading; and (5) \ntaking repeat temperature readings after first requiring the prisoner to drink a glass of ice water. \n[Cassidy Decl. ¶ 14; Mason Decl. ¶¶ 20, 21 (recorded temperatures are artificially low at \nbetween 96-97°F because temperature is taken with a remote scanner that is placed too remote \nfrom the body; prisoners made to drink cold water after registering elevated temperatures); \nKorbe Decl. ¶ 5; see also Hoisington Decl. ¶ 8 (reporting that she was transported to the hospital \non an emergency basis after persistent symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and that she had a \ntemperature of 102°F on admission after having been told by FCI Danbury staff that a \ntemperature taken within an hour prior to her leaving in the ambulance had purportedly \nregistered a reading of 97°F)].56 \n                                                 \n56  As Ms. Hoisington states, on April 17, after previously having tested positive for COVID-19, \nshe started to get symptoms again, including weakness, fever, terrible body pains, sweating and dry \nheaving.  She was taken to the medical clinic where her temperature was recorded at 98 degrees (which \nshe believed to be incorrect but which was not re-taken despite her presenting symptoms).  \nNotwithstanding that her oxygenation only registered at 96 and her blood pressure was so high that the \n43 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 44 of 69\n \n128.  Even where prisoners have presented with confirmed fever, respondents have \nfailed to isolate the prisoner from the general population. Rather, in many instances, respondents \nhave returned the prisoner to his or her unit with instruction to take two to three Tylenol and will \nonly proceed to isolate the prisoner if his or her fever does not respond after that time. [Cassidy \nDecl. ¶ 12; Mason Decl. ¶ 20]. \n129.  When temperatures are taken, they are often not being recorded in the medical \nrecords.  [Mason Decl. ¶ 21]. \n130.  Prison staff have further denigrated or dismissed prisoners exhibiting clear \nsymptoms of coronavirus, telling prisoners with headache, body ache, shortness of breath or even \nchest pains that there is nothing that they can do, that the prisoner merely suffers from \n“overblown flu,” that the prisoner “did the crime” and should “do the time,” and/or that the \ncoronavirus epidemic is not “going to get you out of prison.” [Cassidy Decl. ¶¶ 9, 18; Korbe \n                                                                                                                                                             \nnurse took it three times, the nurse instructed her to take Tylenol and return to her unit. [Hoisington Decl. \n¶ 15]. \nAs Mr. Cassidy recounts:  “For the last couple weeks, prisoners with a fever are taken to medical.  \nSometimes, however, a prisoner has a fever and the associate warden attributes the temperature reading to \nequipment error.  When the temperature wand comes up with a low-grade fever, the associate warden will \n‘reset’ it and pretend to take another reading.  He will announce another number, but he won’t even aim \nthe wand at the prisoner’s forehead.  The associate warden does not show the prisoners the LCD screen \non the wand that displays the temperature, so we have to go by whatever they tell us. … If the associate \nwarden acknowledges that a prisoner has a temperature, then he will escort the prisoner to medical.  At \nmedical, the prisoner is given two or three Tylenol and told that the device is not working properly and \nthat they do not have a fever.  This has happened to more than 20 prisoners in my unit.  One of the \nprisoners has been vomiting blood all week.  When his temperature was taken in the unit, he was told he \nhas a 101.2 degree fever.  When he got to medical, he was given Tylenol, told that his temperature is 98.7 \ndegrees, and sent back to the unit.  When he got back to the unit, he told us that they never took his \ntemperature in medical.  His forehead was hot.  [Cassidy Decl. ¶¶ 13-14]. \nAccording to Ms. Korbe, staff members have been taking all of the inmates’ temperatures every \nday: “They have us line up in rows to do this.  I have noticed that everyone in the same row is told that \nthey have the exact same temperature.”  [Korbe Decl. ¶ 14]. \n \n44 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 45 of 69\n \nDecl. ¶ 16 (staff criticized prisoners’ concern about medical emergency in FSL, telling women to \n“stay in our lane” because they weren’t doctors)].  \n131.  Respondents’ failure to de-densify the population at FCI Danbury and their \ninadequate manner of responding to suspected COVID-19 cases places the putative class at an \nunreasonable risk of contracting COVID-19. \nB.  Failure to Respond Adequately to Cases of Close Contact or Observe \nAppropriate Quarantine/Isolation \n \n132.  CDC Guidance directs prisons to implement 14-day quarantines/isolation of \nprisoners or staff who have had contact with people known to have tested positive for COVID-\n19, to monitor such Close Contact Cases for COVID-19 symptoms, and to keep staff members \nout of the facility unless they are asymptomatic 14 days after their exposure to COVID-19.  \nContrary to this Guidance, Respondents routinely fail to test or isolate prisoners with known \nclose contact with individuals subsequently diagnosed with coronavirus. [Cassidy Decl. ¶¶  31, \n41; Hoisington Decl. ¶¶ 14, 17 (recounting failure to test prisoners in close contact with prisoner \nhospitalized with COVID-19 infection)].   \n133.  Prisoners who test positive for COVID-19 are frequently returned to the general \npopulation far earlier than appropriate pursuant to CDC Guidance.57 [Declaration of Tamika \nSomerville, submitted herewith as Exhibit I (“Sommerville Decl.”) ¶ 13 (women testing positive \nfor COVID-19 on Tuesday returned to the unit that same Friday); Madore Decl. ¶ 12; Cassidy \nDecl. ¶ 15 (reporting that two individuals returned to the unit within 5-6 days after testing \n                                                 \n57  As set forth in the Declaration of Tamika Somerville, who is housed in the FSL, a woman in \nher unit who tested positive for COVID-19 on a Tuesday was returned to the general population on \nFriday, three days later. [Somerville Decl., ¶ 13]. \n45 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 46 of 69\n \npositive for COVID-19, resulting in a substantial outbreak on the unit); Almonte Decl. ¶ 17; \nMason Decl. ¶ 18]. \n134.  Due to staff shortages, prisoners are often required to respond to a medical \nemergency such as another prisoner collapsing on the unit. Notwithstanding that the collapse of a \ngrown man in the context of a pervasive outbreak is highly suggestive of a COVID-19 infection, \nprisoners who respond in this fashion are not thereafter followed for possible infection or \notherwise isolated from the rest of the population.  [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 31; Hoisington Decl. ¶ 13 \n(women had to bang front door to facility to get attention of someone in parking lot when there \nwas no available officer to attend to women who was unconscious after hitting her head on \nconcrete floor)].58 \n135.  Contrary to CDC Guidance, prison staff, including those working in food \nservices, have not been allowed to call in and explain that they are sick or have returned to work \nat times when medical professionals advised that they were still potential carriers. [Martinez \nBrooks Decl. ¶ 20; Mason Decl. ¶ 15 (“Officers have returned to work after being unable to get \ntheir FMLA papers signed, but remain symptomatic. One officer stated that they still feel ill and \ndo not want to be at work, but were told to return.”)].   \n136.  Working correctional officers who are sick or who were previously diagnosed as \npositive for COVID-19 have advised prisoners to keep their distance since they do not know \nwhether they are sufficiently recovered to no longer present a risk of infection to people with \nwhom they come in contact. [Mason Decl. ¶ 15].   \n                                                 \n58  Mr. Cassidy has observed at least three prisoner medical emergencies that were addressed only \nby other prisoners. \n46 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 47 of 69\n \n137.  FCI Danbury has failed to observe appropriate isolation for new prisoners, and \nprisoners have been permitted into the facility without observance of proper quarantine pursuant \nto CDC Guidance.  [Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 12]. \n138.  Respondents’ failure to implement appropriate isolation procedures is reckless \nand places the putative class at an unreasonable risk of contracting COVID-19. \nC.  Failure to Remediate Adequately Spaces with Known Coronavirus Contact  \n  and to Inform Prisoners of the Extent of Infection                    \n \n139.  In the event a prisoner or staff member tests positive for COVID-19, CDC \nGuidance calls for the facility to close off the areas used by that person.  These areas are to be \nwell ventilated for at least 24 hours before they are disinfected by people equipped with proper \npersonal protective equipment (“PPE”).  Respondents have failed to implement any of these \nmeasures. \n140.  In addition, FCI Danbury has departed from CDC Guidance by not informing \nincarcerated prisoners that someone in their unit has tested positive for COVID-19, thereby \ndepriving petitioners and the class members of the opportunity to exercise more vigilance in their \nhygiene and cleaning habits when extra vigilance is needed most. Petitioners and the putative \nclass members have not been informed of the extent of the outbreak at FCI Danbury. [Mason \nDecl. ¶ 16 (FSL prisoners learned about COVID-19 outbreak in the facility because it was \nreported on the news)]; Declaration of Theresa Foreman, submitted herewith as Exhibit J \n(“Foreman Decl.”) ¶ 19 (the Assistant Warden informed the women that they wouldn’t be told if \nthey were exposed to COVID-19)]. \n141.  Respondents know that these failures to adequately remediate spaces with known \ncoronavirus contact or to advise petitioners and the putative class members of the extent of the \n47 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 48 of 69\n \noutbreak at the facility unnecessarily heightens the risk that petitioners and the putative class \nmembers will contract COVID-19. \nD.  Failure to Implement Adequately Social Distancing Measures \n142.  As set forth above, the very configuration of FCI Danbury precludes meaningful \nsocial distancing. The overwhelming majority of the facility’s prisoners in each of the three \nfacilities are housed dormitory-style and all prisoners in these configurations sleep within 3 to 4 \nfeet of between 3 and 5 other prisoners. [Mason Decl. ¶ 7; Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 7; Cassidy \nDecl. ¶ 31; Declaration of Ronald Harper, submitted herewith as Exhibit N (Harper Decl.) ¶ 4]. \nPrisoners use the same bathrooms and share a limited number of toilets, sinks and showers. \n[Mason Decl. ¶ 10; Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶¶ 6, 10; Cassidy Decl. ¶ 32; Harper Decl. ¶ \n4]. Prisoners further must share a limited number of telephones and computers which are located \nclose together in a common area [Mason Decl. ¶ 8; Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 9; Cassidy Decl. ¶¶ \n35-36] and which are rarely cleaned or disinfected (and are not disinfected after each use). \n[Korbe Decl. ¶ 11; Cassidy Decl. ¶¶ 35-36].  \n143.  FCI Danbury has failed to implement adequate social distancing measures in \nother aspects of prison life.  For example, prisoners are regularly unnecessarily made to line up \nin close proximity to one another to receive their meals and when medications are dispensed. \n[Almonte Decl. ¶ 13; Cassidy Decl. ¶ 39 (“Staff give out medication twice a day. They shout \n‘medication’ and stand outside the door. Prisoners form a pill line, standing right next to each \nother. If you don’t hear ‘medication’ you don’t get your medication for the day, so everyone \ncomes up at the same time and crowds each other.”)].   \n48 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 49 of 69\n \n144.  Prisoners likewise mass together for commissary which, in the dorms in the men’s \nunits, is brought into the central dormitory hallway in a laundry bin. The men on the dorm then \nstand in the narrow hallway in close proximity to one another while waiting for their names to be \ncalled. [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 37]. \n145.  Prisoners further congregate in close proximity in unacceptably large numbers in \nrecreation areas and in common areas to watch television, to use the telephones and computers, \nand for meals. [Declaration of Antrum Coston, submitted herewith as Exhibit K (“Coston Decl.”) \n¶ 4; Almonte Decl. ¶ 8; Mason Decl. ¶¶ 8-9].  \n146.  Staff move regularly between units, in contravention of proper social distancing \npractices, thereby exacerbating the spread of undiagnosed disease from one part of the facility to \nanother. [Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 19 (staff move between all four dorms in the camp for count, \nfood delivery and commissary and staff at camp also work at the other two facilities at FCI \nDanbury)]. \n147.  Respondents have inappropriately moved prisoners from rooms where greater \nseparation was possible into dorms in the women’s camp, pushing the populations of A, B and C \ndorms to almost full capacity, thereby dramatically reducing the ability of occupants of those \ndorms to practice any form of social distancing. [Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 5]. Despite the \nlockdown at the camp, women from one dorm out for recreation have been visiting friends in \nother dorms. [Id. ¶ 15]. \n148.  Respondents have further isolated prisoners nearing the end of their sentences and \npreparing for halfway house or other release, but subsequently rendered such isolation \n49 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 50 of 69\n \nineffective by moving other prisoners with unknown COVID-19 exposures onto those previously \nisolated units. [Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 13]. \n149.  Respondents further initially isolated medically-vulnerable prisoners who were \nnotified that they were going to be transferred to home confinement but, after reversing policy \nand putting such transfers on hold, have rendered those isolations ineffective—and have put \nmedically-vulnerable prisoners at undue risk—by moving other prisoners with unknown \nCOVID-19 exposures onto those previously isolated units. [Id.].  \n150.  Respondents’ failure to implement adequate social distancing measures places \npetitioners and the putative class members at unnecessarily heightened risk of contracting \nCOVID-19. \n  E.  Failure to Implement Necessary Hygiene Measures \n151.  CDC Guidance requires heightened hygienic, cleaning and disinfecting practices \nin order to prevent and mitigate COVID-19 infection. FCI Danbury has failed adequately to \nimplement these heightened hygienic and cleaning practices. Petitioners do not have access to \nthe cleaning supplies necessary to sanitize themselves, their personal items, or their living areas. \n152.  Prisoners at FCI Danbury are responsible for cleaning their own cubicles or \ndormitory spaces. Prisoners do not have adequate cleaning supplies, shared living spaces \nthroughout the facility are not regularly or properly disinfected to prevent the spread of COVID-\n19. [Madore Decl. ¶ 6]. \n153.  Common spaces are cleaned by prisoners who are assigned jobs as cleaners, but \nmany women have quit their jobs and cleaning has been sporadic. [Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 9; \n50 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 51 of 69\n \nAlmonte Decl. ¶ 22]. The common toilets, sinks and showers are not regularly or properly \ndisinfected to prevent the spread of COVID-19. \n154.  Telephones, computers and video calling equipment and televisions shared by \nhundreds of prisoners are not cleaned or disinfected between uses and the common areas in \nwhich that equipment is located is not regularly or properly disinfected to prevent the spread of \nCOVID-19. [Cassidy Decl. ¶¶ 36-37]. \n155.  No professional or staff cleaners have sanitized the units where prisoners who \ntested positive have been housed, but instead those units are being cleaned by prisoner orderlies \nwith the same cleaning supplies they regularly use and without provision of sufficient gloves and \nmasks. [Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 8; Mason Decl. ¶ 8; Almonte Decl. ¶ 22; Declaration of \nShannon Benson, submitted herewith as Exhibit L (Benson Decl.”) ¶ 8; Cassidy Decl. ¶ 33; \nCoston Decl. ¶¶ 7, 15).  \n156.  FCI Danbury has provided inadequate access to soap and sanitizers.  The prison \nhas not created any hand-washing stations or provided prisoners with hand sanitizer. [Coston \nDecl. ¶ 15; Somerville Decl. ¶ 10; Mason Decl. ¶ 12].  Nor has hand sanitizer been available in \nthe commissary for the duration of the current COVID-19 crisis. [Coston Decl. ¶ 15].  Liquid \nsoap dispensers have only recently been installed in the men’s prison, but they are not regularly \nrestocked and the prisoners have to wait a day or two to get it refilled.  [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 34 \n(men’s unit)].   \n157.  There are no paper towels or hand towels, so prisoners have to use toilet paper or \ntheir clothing to dry their hands.  [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 34; Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 8]. \n51 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 52 of 69\n \n158.   Soap must be purchased from the commissary and is unavailable to indigent \nprisoners. Prisoners are not provided with cleaning supplies either.59 [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 34]. \n159.  The prison does not distribute shampoo, toothpaste or mouthwash which must be \npurchased from the commissary and are, therefore, unavailable to indigent prisoners. [Id.]. \n160.  Since the epidemic, laundry is done once a week (depending on the availability of \nhot water or staff to perform the function), leaving used clothing and bedding exposed to the \nvirus. [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 20].   \n161.  Prisoners in the facility have further been assigned to handle laundry, mattresses \nand bedding of individuals isolated for COVID, exposing those prisoners in turn to possible \ninfection.    \n162.  Isolation facilities are further inadequate and unhygienic. The isolation room at \nthe FSL is cold and small, with just enough room for a bed and a toilet.  The bed has a one-inch \nthick mattress and no pillow.  The toilet’s flush is controlled by the corrections officer and is \nonly flushed a few times a day. [Hoisington Decl. ¶ 11].   \n163.  FSL subsequently required overflow isolation for individuals returning from \nhospital or with confirmed diagnosis positive for COVID-19 and was required to convert the \nvisiting room at the facility. Four women were housed in the visiting room and were required to \nuse the visiting room bathrooms and had to shower in a temporary stand-up stall built in the \nbathroom to enable them to bathe.  [Id. ¶ 13].  \n164.  Some prisoners who are in quarantine are held in a room with no running water. \n                                                 \n59  During the early weeks of the crisis, respondents actively confiscated spray bottles that \nprisoners used for cleaning.  Those spray bottles are now only available to prisoners in the counselor’s \noffice.  [Almonte Decl. ¶ 21].  \n52 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 53 of 69\n \n165.  Men have been isolated in an observation cell where they do not have consistent \naccess to meals and showers and often experience medication delays. Men isolated in \nobservation cells were further unable to communicate with their families or other prisoners in the \nfacility. [Declaration of Richard Johnson, submitted herewith as Exhibit M, ¶¶ 7-8].   \n166.  More than 40 women in the FSL are currently quarantined in the facility’s dining \nhall/kitchen. [Hoisington Decl. ¶ 17]. \n167.  The FSL frequently has issues with water which is often shut off for a few hours \nor for as long as a day at a time, during which time nobody in FSL is able to wash their hands or \nflush the toilet. [Mason Decl. ¶ 11].   \n168.  Cleaning is now sporadic in many areas of the camp since prisoners who were \npreviously assigned to clean different areas of the facility have either quit their jobs or have been \nisolated in different dorms from their assigned cleaning area. [Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 8]. \n169.  These unsanitary conditions and inadequate levels of cleaning and disinfecting, \nwhich are in contravention of the CDC Guidance, place petitioners and the putative class \nmembers at an inexcusably higher risk of contracting COVID-19. \n  F.  Failure to Plan Adequately to Prevent or Mitigate the Spread of COVID-19 \nInfection                                                                                                  \n \n170.  CDC Guidance recommends that correctional facilities should develop \ncontingency plans for reduced workforces due to staff absences. That Guidance also calls for the \nprovision of PPE and contingency planning for shortages of PPE. FCI Danbury has failed to \nadequately plan for either inevitable staff shortages or the need for PPE, placing petitioners and \nthe putative class members at heightened risk. \n53 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 54 of 69\n \n171.  As set forth above, respondents have required correctional staff who were ill—\nincluding correctional staff in close contact with individuals exposed to COVID-19 and \ncorrectional staff who were confirmed positive for COVID-19—to return to work before they \nwere symptom-free and earlier than appropriate pursuant to applicable CDC Guidance. [Mason \nDecl., ¶ 15].  \n172.  Prisoners at FCI Danbury were not provided with fabric masks until in or about \nmid-April. [Mason Decl. ¶ 13]. Prior to that time, prisoners were dependent on paper masks or \nhad to fashion their own masks. [Id.]. However, in many parts of the facility, FCI Danbury only \nprovides one mask per prisoner and, therefore, prisoners have no protection when their masks are \nbeing washed. [Somerville Decl. ¶ 11]. Several prisoners in the men’s prison are dependent on \npaper disposable hospital masks that fall apart when they come in contact with water.  [Cassidy \nDecl. ¶ 40].  \n173.  Prisoners—including prisoners on cleaning duty—are not provided with gloves to \nprotect their hands from exposed surfaces. [Id.; Foreman Decl. ¶ 16]. \n174.  Correctional officers and staff, likewise were not provided with fabric masks until \napproximately mid-April. [Mason Decl. ¶ 14]. \n175.  Moreover, usage of PPE is inconsistent and correctional staff does not enforce \nmask usage on prisoners who refuse to cover their faces, [Cassidy Decl. ¶40], nor does \ncorrectional staff consistently wear masks or gloves when they are on the units. [Martinez-\nBrooks Decl. ¶ 16; Cassidy Decl. ¶ 41].     \nG.  Failure to Implement the Training and Interventions Necessary to Prevent \n   the Spread of COVID-19 \n \n54 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 55 of 69\n \n176.  CDC Guidance states that correctional staff and incarcerated people should be \ntrained on donning, doffing and disposing of PPE. CDC Guidance further recommends that \ncorrectional facilities post signage informing staff and incarcerated people how to report \nCOVID-19 symptoms and advising staff to stay at home when sick.  FCI Danbury has failed \nadequately to implement either of these training and educational interventions. [See, e.g., \nCassidy Decl. ¶ 42 (staff go into quarantine units and then return to units that are purportedly \nCOVID-free without changing gloves and masks or will remove gloves without washing hands)].  \nFCI Danbury has further failed to provide prisoners or staff with clear guidance on what to do to \nprotect themselves and prisoners are often reluctant to report symptoms because they have no \nexpectation that they will receive effective treatment and fear being isolated away from their \nfriends and property in quarantine units that are often insufficiently hygienic. [Mason Decl. ¶ \n22].      \n  H.  Respondents’ Failures to Respond to the COVID-19 Epidemic Have Further \nPut Petitioners and Putative Class Members at Unacceptably Heightened \nRisk of Injury and Illness Unrelated to COVID-19                 \n \n177.  Respondents’ failure to prepare adequately for the COVID-19 epidemic has also \nput petitioners and the putative class members at heightened risk of other injury and illness.   \n178.  FCI Danbury is experiencing significant staff shortages.  Many correctional \nofficers are absent and those who are working are putting in significant overtime.   \n179.  The performance of the duties of correctional officers is being augmented by non-\ncorrectional staff (such as medical or educational staff) who cover units when there are \ninsufficient correctional staff.  [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 30]. \n55 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 56 of 69\n \n180.   As a result of staff shortages, correctional officers and other staff are often only \navailable on the units for limited amounts of time, generally for count, resulting in significantly \nextended response times in the event of emergencies on the units. On at least one occasion, when \na prisoner experienced chest pains on a unit in which no correctional officer was present, other \nprisoners on the unit were required to yell out the window in the hopes that a staff member could \nhear them and could respond to the medical emergency. [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 31; Hoisington Decl. ¶ \n13 (on one occasion in isolation unit in FSL visiting room, one of the quarantined prisoners fell \nin the bathroom and hit her head on the concrete floor, rendering her unconscious. There was no \nnearby guard and the prisoners were required to bang on the locked front door to the facility; \nhelp only arrived because someone in the parking lot heard the prisoners and called control)].  \n181.  As a result of the increased attention to the COVID epidemic, non-virus medical \nneeds have gone unattended.  The regular prison physicians have been absent or are no longer \navailable to prisoners on the unit, prisoners who do not present with fever during sick call cannot \nbe referred to a physician, and sick call requests for other than virus symptoms go unanswered \nfor prolonged periods of time. [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 17; Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 23].60   \n182.  Recently, the prison pharmacy has been closed. Medications must be shipped \nfrom another facility (USP Allenwood in Pennsylvania) resulting in delays in their delivery and \ndisruption of medication regimens. [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 7 (two week delay in receipt of correct \ndosage of medication); Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 23 (8 day delay in refill of hypertension \nmedication)]. \n                                                 \n60  Mr. Cassidy suffers from intestinal disease, including diverticulitis.  [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 5].  He \nhas recently developed an abnormal growth in the rectum which has resulted on occasion in dark black \nblood in feces and obstruction of his bowel.  Although he has made at least three requests for a medical \n56 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 57 of 69\n \n183.  Special medical diets are not available to prisoners at FCI Danbury. As a result, \non repeated occasions, special-diet prisoners have received meals containing ingredients \ndangerously harmful to their health, including, for example, delivery of meals containing peanut \nproducts to allergic patients at risk of anaphylaxis, or delivery of meals containing rice and beans \nto prisoners with diverticulosis. [Cassidy Decl. ¶¶ 20, 22; Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 22 (peanut \nbutter was served multiple times in a dorm housing a woman with severe peanut allergy)]. \n184.  As a result of the epidemic, food service has been reduced below BOP guidelines \nfor caloric intake and nutritional value; food reductions put petitioners and putative class \nmembers at heightened risk of adverse health effects. [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 21].61 \n185.  Respondents’ failures to respond appropriately to the coronavirus outbreak in FCI \nDanbury has, likewise, endangered prison staff.  In an “Imminent Danger Report” filed with the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) on March 31, 2020, the President of \nthe union that represents many BOP staff reported health and safety hazards across many BOP \nfacilities – including FCI Danbury – related to COVID-19, including: \na.  Contrary to CDC guidelines, officials have directed staff throughout the BOP who \nhave come into contact with, or been in close proximity to, individuals who show \nor have shown symptoms of COVID-19, to report to work and not self-quarantine \nfor 14 days; \n                                                                                                                                                             \nvisit to assess and diagnose his condition, he has been advised that his condition is not an emergency and \nthat the medical team is currently unavailable to evaluate him. [Id. ¶ 17].   \n61 The COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in worrisome curtailment of prisoners’ legal rights.  \nThe prison law library has been closed and locked and the administrative remedy process has been \nsuspended indefinitely.  Legal mail is being delayed and at times not picked up due to staff shortages.  \nLegal calls are being denied  and legal requests from attorneys are often going unanswered, including for \nopen and pending cases that require access to attorneys such as the development of pleadings in \nconnection with motions for compassionate release. [Cassidy Decl. ¶¶ 25-27]. \n57 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 58 of 69\n \nb.  The BOP has violated CDC Guidelines by continuously moving prisoners by bus \nand/or airlift to various prison sites across the nation, including infected prisoners, \nprisoners suspected of being infected, and prisoners who have been in close \ncontact with, or proximity to, infected prisoners; \nc.  The BOP has failed to introduce workplace controls to mitigate exposure or \nfurther exposure to the virus, such as high efficiency air filters to minimize the \nairborne nature of the virus or otherwise improve ventilation; \nd.  The BOP has failed to minimize contact within recreation areas, education areas, \ncounseling/treatment rooms, resulting in prisoners and staff coming in \ndangerously close contact with each other; and \ne.  The BOP has failed to comply with OSHA Personal Protective Equipment \nStandards.62 \nVII.   FCI Danbury Is Not Prepared to Treat Individuals Who Contract Coronavirus  \n \n186.  Prisoners who do contract COVID-19 are at higher risk for developing acute \nsymptoms than if they were in the community, because FCI Danbury lacks the medical resources \nto care for symptomatic prisoners, creating a continuing unacceptable danger to petitioners and \nputative class members.   \n187.  Now that COVID-19 is inside the facility, FCI Danbury will be unable to stop the \nspread of the virus throughout the facility given long-documented inadequacies in BOP’s \nmedical care and in light of how these facilities function. \n                                                 \n62  Available at https://www.afge.org/globalassets/documents/generalreports/coronavirus/4/osha-\n7-form-national-complaint.pdf . \n58 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 59 of 69\n \n188.  There is no separate medical unit or facility for ill prisoners at the men’s facility \nor either facility for women. Unlike many Federal Correctional Institutions, FCI Danbury has no \nphysical space in which an ill prisoner can convalesce that is separate from other prisoners, \nwarm, clean and has access to fresh water and regular hand-washing. \n189.  On information and belief, FCI Danbury has woefully inadequate numbers of \nnasal swab COVID-19 test kits, requiring correctional staff to ration those few available kits and \nto refuse testing to prisoners clearly exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 infection. As a result of \nthe lack of testing and confirmation of actual infections in the facility, FCI Danbury is failing to \nimplement appropriate isolation practices thus accelerating the spread of the infection within the \ninstitution.63 \n190.  FCI Danbury currently has no ventilators and cannot intubate prisoners on-site.  \nFCI Danbury does not have any specialized equipment or medical providers. \n191.  On information and belief there are only 2 (and possibly fewer) doctors available \nat FCI Danbury to care for all 1,046 prisoners. Even this highly limited number is likely to \ndecrease as doctors themselves go into quarantine. None of these doctors specializes in infectious \ndiseases. \n                                                 \n63  Earlier in April 2020  the warden at Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, a BOP \nfacility, advised in a letter to United States District Judge Paul Engelmayer that MCC could not test a \ndefendant in a matter pending before that court exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms because “MCC New \nYork does not have COVID-19 tests.”  See No COVID-19 tests available for prisoners at center of New \nYork outbreak, court documents show, ABCNews (April 4, 2020, 6:00 am), available at \nhttps://abcnews.go.com/Health/covid-19-tests-prisoners-center-york-outbreak-court/story?id=69969077.  \nAt the same time, Bureau of Prisons officials confirmed to ABC news that FCI Oakdale prisoners \nshowing symptoms in the middle of an outbreak at that facility wouldn’t be tested because tests were too \nscarce.  Id.  At the same time, another federal facility in New York, the Metropolitan Detention Center in \nBrooklyn, court filings before U.S. District Judge Rachel Kovner revealed that only seven of 1,700 \nprisoners in that facility had been tested.  Id. \n59 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 60 of 69\n \n192.  People who contract COVID-19 can deteriorate rapidly, even before a test result \ncan be received. They need constant monitoring. Most people in the higher risk categories will \nrequire more advanced support: positive pressure ventilation, and in extreme cases, \nextracorporeal mechanical oxygenation. Such care requires specialized equipment in limited \nsupply as well as an entire team of specialized care providers. FCI Danbury does not have that \nspecialized equipment or specialized providers. \n193.  FCI Danbury is short-staffed. As of April 25, 2020, 38 staff members have tested \npositive and several more are symptomatic; correctional officers are understandably hesitant to \ncome to work. This staffing shortage will only increase as employees need to stay home to care \nfor children whose schools are closed, elderly family members, and other personal health \nsituations. With fewer staff, correctional officers are less able to monitor prisoners’ health. \nVIII.  The Situation at FCI Danbury Imposes Undue Risks on the Surrounding \nCommunity that result in further harm to the Petitioner Class  \n \n194.  FCI Danbury is located in Fairfield County, Connecticut—the hardest hit area of \nthe State with over 10,500 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection and 707 deaths as of April \n27, 2020.64  \n195.  Diseases in prison put staff and surrounding community at risk. When the \nCOVID-19 virus is introduced to a prison, all persons within the facility – whether they are staff \nor incarcerated people – are at heightened risk of contracting the virus and, in turn, spreading the \nvirus to others with whom they live or come into contact with in their own homes and \nneighborhoods.65  The harm caused by a COVID-19 outbreak in a correctional facility, therefore, \n                                                 \n64  COVID-19 Dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns \nHopkins University (JHU), https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html  \n65  Peter Wagner & Emily Widra, No need to wait for pandemics: The public health case \n60 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 61 of 69\n \nis not confined to those who are incarcerated or work in that facility. Instead, this harm poses a \nserious health risk to the surrounding community on which Petitioner class needs to rely for \nhealth care as well as for general services through staffing of FCI. \n196.  For example, scarce community health resources like emergency departments, \nhospital beds, and ventilators would inevitably become more scarce in the event of a COVID-19 \noutbreak in a detention facility, because incarcerated people are more likely to have underlying \nmedical conditions that carry a significantly increased risk of severe complications from \nCOVID-19. \n197.  A COVID-19 outbreak would exceed the capacity of the local health \ninfrastructure because treatment for serious cases requires significant medical intervention, \nincluding ventilator assistance and intensive care support.  If the need for ICU beds and life-\nsaving medical equipment exceeds supply, the death rate will increase for the entire population \nof Connecticut. \nCLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(Declaratory and Injunctive Relief for \nViolation of the Eighth Amendments) \n \n198.  Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein \n199.  Respondents are holding Petitioners and all putative class members in violation of \nthe Constitution by detaining them in the face of significant threats to their health and safety \nwithout taking sufficient steps to prevent that harm. \n                                                                                                                                                             \nfor criminal justice reform, Prison Policy Initiative (Mar. 6, 2020), \nhttps://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2020/03/06/pandemic/  \n61 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 62 of 69\n \n200.  Respondents’ failure to provide adequate medical care in response to a \nwidespread outbreak of a contagious disease constitutes deliberate indifference to the serious, \nknown medical needs of detainees, thereby establishing a violation of the Eighth Amendment of \nthe United States Constitution. \n201.  Because of the conditions at FCI Danbury, Petitioners are not able to take steps to \nprotect themselves—such as social distancing, using hand sanitizer, washing their hands \nregularly, and disinfecting their surroundings—and the government has not provided adequate \nprotections. As COVID-19 rapidly spreads at FCI Danbury in a matter of days, as experts \npredict, the already deplorable conditions at FCI Danbury will be exacerbated, and the ability to \nprotect oneself will become even more impossible. \n202.  Respondents’ failure adequately to protect Petitioners from these punitive \nconditions, or release them from the conditions altogether, constitutes deliberate indifference to \nthe serious known medical needs of Petitioners, and all members of the Class, thereby \nestablishing a violation of the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution. \n203.  Respondents were aware of the medical needs of the population and the \npervasiveness of prisoners and staff exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms throughout the prison.    \n204.  Respondents knew of and disregarded an excessive risk to health and safety. \n205.  Respondents failed to act with reasonable care to mitigate these risks. \n206.  Because Respondents failed to act to remedy Petitioners’ and the Class’s \ndegrading and inhuman conditions of confinement in violation of their Eighth Amendment \nrights, Petitioners seek relief under this Writ of Habeas Corpus. \n62 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 63 of 69\n \n207.  Because of the unlawful conduct of Respondents, Petitioners and the Class are \nthreatened with imminent physical injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, humiliation, \nand death. \n208.  Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law and will suffer irreparable harm \nunless the court acts immediately to grant the relief requested herein. \nTHE NEED FOR ENLARGEMENT AS A PROVISIONAL REMEDY \n209.  Federal district courts have authority, when habeas actions are pending, to \n“enlarge” the custody of petitioners. Enlargement is not release. Rather, it is a provisional \nremedy that modifies custody by expanding the site at which it takes place, upon order of the \ncourt, from a particular prison to another setting; as requested here, to home confinement. See \nExhibit B, Declaration of Professor Judith Resnik Regarding Enlargement and the Use of \nProvisional Remedies for Detained Individuals ¶¶ 28-29. The enlargement power stems from \nCongress’s authorization of federal judges under the habeas statutes to “summarily hear and \ndetermine the facts, and dispose of the matter as law and justice require” as well as the courts’ \ninherent powers. See 28 U.S.C. § 2243.  \n210.  To qualify for the enlargement remedy, an individual must show “extraordinary \ncircumstances” and that the underlying claim raises “substantial claims.” Mapp v. Reno, 241 \nF.3d 221, 226 (2d Cir. 2001).  \n211.  Petitioners and the putative Subclass members meet these requirements because \nof the extreme risk that COVID-19 poses, especially in light of their ages and medical \nconditions, and because of the particular conditions of confinement at FCI Danbury. If \npetitioners and putative Subclass members remain incarcerated, there is a high risk that they will \n63 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 64 of 69\n \ncontract COVID-19 and, as a result, suffer severe illness or death. Immediate release to permit \npetitioners and putative Subclass members to serve their sentences on home confinement during \nthe pendency of this action is thus the only way to effectuate the eventual habeas remedy.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Petitioners and proposed class members respectfully request that this Court: \na.  Certify the proposed Class and Subclass pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23(B)(1) \nand (B)(2); \nb.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2243 and this Court’s inherent powers, enlarge petitioners \nand Subclass members pending disposition of the underlying petition; \nc.  Issue a Writ of Habeas Corpus and/or pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 65, enter a \ntemporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction \nrequiring Respondents to release from custody or to home confinement members \nof the Subclass and requiring Respondents to provide medically adequate social \ndistancing and health care and sanitation for members of the Class who remain; \nd.  Enter an order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201-2202, declaring that Respondents' \npolicies and practices regarding COVID-19 violate the Eighth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution; \ne.  Appoint a special master pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 63 or an expert under \nFederal Rule of Evidence 706 to make recommendations to the Court regarding \nthe number of incarcerated people that FCI Danbury can house consistent with \nCDC Guidance on best social distancing and hygiene practices to prevent the \nspread of COVID-19. \n64 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111   Filed 06/16/20   Page 65 of 69\n \nf.

Background and Qualifications \n \n1.  I am Dr. Jaimie Meyer, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Yale School of Medicine \nand Assistant Clinical Professor of Nursing at Yale School of Nursing in New Haven, \nConnecticut. I am board certified in Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases and Addiction \nMedicine.  I completed my residency in Internal Medicine at NY Presbyterian Hospital at \nColumbia, New York, in 2008. I completed a fellowship in clinical Infectious Diseases at \nYale School of Medicine in 2011 and a fellowship in Interdisciplinary HIV Prevention at \nthe Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS in 2012. I hold a Master of Science in \nBiostatistics and Epidemiology from Yale School of Public Health. \n2.  I have worked for over a decade on infectious diseases in the context of jails and prisons. \nFrom 2008-2016, I served as the Infectious Disease physician for York Correctional \nInstitution in Niantic, Connecticut, which is the only state jail and prison for women in \nConnecticut.  In that capacity, I was responsible for the management of HIV, Hepatitis C, \ntuberculosis, and other infectious diseases in the facility.  Since then, I have maintained a \ndedicated HIV clinic in the community for patients returning home from prison and jail.  \nFor over a decade, I have been continuously funded by the NIH, industry, and \nfoundations for clinical research on HIV prevention and treatment for people involved in \nthe criminal justice system, including those incarcerated in closed settings (jails and \nprisons) and in the community under supervision (probation and parole).  I have served as \nan expert consultant on infectious diseases and women’s health in jails and prisons for the \nUN Office on Drugs and Crimes, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and others.  I also served \nas an expert health witness for the US Commission on Civil Rights Special Briefing on \nWomen in Prison.      \n3.  I have written and published extensively on the topics of infectious diseases among \npeople involved in the criminal justice system including book chapters and articles in \nleading peer-reviewed journals (including Lancet HIV, JAMA Internal Medicine, \nAmerican Journal of Public Health, International Journal of Drug Policy) on issues of \nprevention, diagnosis, and management of HIV, Hepatitis C, and other infectious diseases \namong people involved in the criminal justice system.  In making the following \nstatements, I am not commenting on the particular issues posed this case. Rather, I am \nmaking general statements about the realities of persons in detention facilities, jails and \nprisons. \n4.  My C.V. includes a full list of my honors, experience, and publications, and it is attached \nas Exhibit A.  \n5.  I was paid $1,000 for my time drafting an earlier version of this report filed in another \ncase. I subsequently prepared this version of the report without receiving payment for my \nservices. \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-1   Filed 06/16/20   Page 3 of 9\n \n6.  I testified as an expert at a single trial or by deposition in the past four years: State v. \nFrank Sanville, Docket No. 263-3-18 Wrcr (Vermont) on April 21, 2020. \nII.  Heightened Risk of Epidemics in Jails and Prisons \n \n7.  The risk posed by infectious diseases in jails and prisons is significantly higher than in \nthe community, both in terms of risk of transmission, exposure, and harm to individuals \nwho become infected. There are several reasons this is the case, as delineated further \nbelow.    \n8.  Globally, outbreaks of contagious diseases are all too common in closed detention \nsettings and are more common than in the community at large.  Prisons and jails are not \nisolated from communities.  Staff, visitors, contractors, and vendors pass between \ncommunities and facilities and can bring infectious diseases into facilities.  Moreover, \nrapid turnover of jail and prison populations means that people often cycle between \nfacilities and communities.  People often need to be transported to and from facilities to \nattend court and move between facilities.  Prison health is public health. \n9.  Reduced prevention opportunities: Congregate settings such as jails and prisons allow for \nrapid spread of infectious diseases that are transmitted person to person, especially those \npassed by droplets through coughing and sneezing. When people must share dining halls, \nbathrooms, showers, and other common areas, the opportunities for transmission are \ngreater. When infectious diseases are transmitted from person to person by droplets, the \nbest initial strategy is to practice social distancing.  When jailed or imprisoned, people \nhave much less of an opportunity to protect themselves by social distancing than they \nwould in the community. Spaces within jails and prisons are often also poorly ventilated, \nwhich promotes highly efficient spread of diseases through droplets. Placing someone in \nsuch a setting therefore dramatically reduces their ability to protect themselves from \nbeing exposed to and acquiring infectious diseases.  \n10. Disciplinary segregation or solitary confinement is not an effective disease containment \nstrategy.  Beyond the known detrimental mental health effects of solitary confinement, \nisolation of people who are ill in solitary confinement results in decreased medical \nattention and increased risk of death.  Isolation of people who are ill using solitary \nconfinement also is an ineffective way to prevent transmission of the virus through \ndroplets to others because, except in specialized negative pressure rooms (rarely in \nmedical units if available at all), air continues to flow outward from rooms to the rest of \nthe facility.  Risk of exposure is thus increased to other people in prison and staff.  \n11. Reduced prevention opportunities: During an infectious disease outbreak, people can \nprotect themselves by washing hands.  Jails and prisons do not provide adequate \nopportunities to exercise necessary hygiene measures, such as frequent handwashing or \nuse of alcohol-based sanitizers when handwashing is unavailable.  Jails and prisons are \noften under-resourced and ill-equipped with sufficient hand soap and alcohol-based \nsanitizers for people detained in and working in these settings.  High-touch surfaces \n(doorknobs, light switches, etc.) should also be cleaned and disinfected regularly with \nbleach to prevent virus spread, but this is often not done in jails and prisons because of a \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-1   Filed 06/16/20   Page 4 of 9\n \nlack of cleaning supplies and lack of people available to perform necessary cleaning \nprocedures.  \n12. Reduced prevention opportunities: During an infectious disease outbreak, a containment \nstrategy requires people who are ill with symptoms to be isolated and that caregivers have \naccess to personal protective equipment, including gloves, masks, gowns, and eye \nshields.  Jails and prisons are often under-resourced and ill-equipped to provide sufficient \npersonal protective equipment for people who are incarcerated and caregiving staff, \nincreasing the risk for everyone in the facility of a widespread outbreak.  \n13. Increased susceptibility: People incarcerated in jails and prisons are more susceptible to \nacquiring and experiencing complications from infectious diseases than the population in \nthe community.1 This is because people in jails and prisons are more likely than people in \nthe community to have chronic underlying health conditions, including diabetes, heart \ndisease, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, and lower immune systems from \nHIV. \n14. Jails and prisons are often poorly equipped to diagnose and manage infectious disease \noutbreaks.  Some jails and prisons lack onsite medical facilities or 24-hour medical care.  \nThe medical facilities at jails and prisons are almost never sufficiently equipped to handle \nlarge outbreaks of infectious diseases. To prevent transmission of droplet-borne \ninfectious diseases, people who are infected and ill need to be isolated in specialized \nairborne negative pressure rooms.  Most jails and prisons have few negative pressure \nrooms if any, and these may be already in use by people with other conditions (including \ntuberculosis or influenza).  Resources will become exhausted rapidly and any beds \navailable will soon be at capacity. This makes both containing the illness and caring for \nthose who have become infected much more difficult. \n15. Jails and prisons lack access to vital community resources to diagnose and manage \ninfectious diseases. Jails and prisons do not have access to community health resources \nthat can be crucial in identifying and managing widespread outbreaks of infectious \ndiseases.  This includes access to testing equipment, laboratories, and medications. \n16. Jails and prisons often need to rely on outside facilities (hospitals, emergency \ndepartments) to provide intensive medical care given that the level of care they can \nprovide in the facility itself is typically relatively limited. During an epidemic, this will \nnot be possible, as those outside facilities will likely be at or over capacity themselves.   \n17. Health safety: As an outbreak spreads through jails, prisons, and communities, medical \npersonnel become sick and do not show up to work. Absenteeism means that facilities \ncan become dangerously understaffed with healthcare providers. This increases a number \nof risks and can dramatically reduce the level of care provided.  As health systems inside \nfacilities are taxed, people with chronic underlying physical and mental health conditions \nand serious medical needs may not be able to receive the care they need for these \n                                                 \n1 Active case finding for communicable diseases in prisons, 391 The Lancet 2186 (2018), \nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31251-0/fulltext. \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-1   Filed 06/16/20   Page 5 of 9\n \nconditions.  As supply chains become disrupted during a global pandemic, the availability \nof medicines and food may be limited. \n18. Safety and security: As an outbreak spreads through jails, prisons, and communities, \ncorrectional officers and other security personnel become sick and do not show up to \nwork.  Absenteeism poses substantial safety and security risk to both the people inside \nthe facilities and the public.   \n19. These risks have all been borne out during past epidemics of influenza in jails and \nprisons. For example, in 2012, the CDC reported an outbreak of influenza in 2 facilities \nin Maine, resulting in two inmate deaths.2  Subsequent CDC investigation of 995 inmates \nand 235 staff members across the 2 facilities discovered insufficient supplies of influenza \nvaccine and antiviral drugs for treatment of people who were ill and prophylaxis for \npeople who were exposed.  During the H1N1-strain flu outbreak in 2009 (known as the \n“swine flu”), jails and prisons experienced a disproportionately high number of cases.3  \nEven facilities on “quarantine” continued to accept new intakes, rendering the quarantine \nincomplete. These scenarios occurred in the “best case” of influenza, a viral infection for \nwhich there was an effective and available vaccine and antiviral medications, unlike \nCOVID-19, for which there is currently neither. \nIII.  Profile of COVID-19 as an Infectious Disease4 \n \n20.  The novel coronavirus, officially known as SARS-CoV-2, causes a disease known as \nCOVID-19.  The virus is thought to pass from person to person primarily through \nrespiratory droplets (by coughing or sneezing) but may also survive on inanimate \nsurfaces.  People seem to be most able to transmit the virus to others when they are \nsickest but it is possible that people can transmit the virus before they start to show \nsymptoms or for weeks after their symptoms resolve.  In China, where COVID-19 \noriginated, the average infected person passed the virus on to 2-3 other people; \ntransmission occurred at a distance of 3-6 feet.  Not only is the virus very efficient at \nbeing transmitted through droplets, everyone is at risk of infection because our immune \nsystems have never been exposed to or developed protective responses against this virus. \nA vaccine is currently in development but will likely not be able for another year to the \n                                                 \n2 Influenza Outbreaks at Two Correctional Facilities — Maine, March 2011, Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention (2012), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6113a3.htm. \n3 David M.

Antiviral medications are currently in testing but not yet FDA-approved, \nso only available for compassionate use from the manufacturer.  People in prison and jail \nwill likely have even less access to these novel health strategies as they become available. \n21. Most people (80%) who become infected with COVID-19 will develop a mild upper \nrespiratory infection but emerging data from China suggests serious illness occurs in up \nto 16% of cases, including death.5  Serious illness and death is most common among \npeople with underlying chronic health conditions, like heart disease, lung disease, liver \ndisease, and diabetes, and older age.6  Death in COVID-19 infection is usually due to \npneumonia and sepsis.  The emergence of COVID-19 during influenza season means that \npeople are also at risk from serious illness and death due to influenza, especially when \nthey have not received the influenza vaccine or the pneumonia vaccine. \n22. The care of people who are infected with COVID-19 depends on how seriously they are \nill.7  People with mild symptoms may not require hospitalization but may continue to be \nclosely monitored at home.  People with moderate symptoms may require hospitalization \nfor supportive care, including intravenous fluids and supplemental oxygen.  People with \nsevere symptoms may require ventilation and intravenous antibiotics. Public health \nofficials anticipate that hospital settings will likely be overwhelmed and beyond capacity \nto provide this type of intensive care as COVID-19 becomes more widespread in \ncommunities. \n23. COVID-19 prevention strategies include containment and mitigation.  Containment \nrequires intensive hand washing practices, decontamination and aggressive cleaning of \nsurfaces, and identifying and isolating people who are ill or who have had contact with \npeople who are ill, including the use of personal protective equipment.  Jails and prisons \nare totally under-resourced to meet the demand for any of these strategies.  As infectious \ndiseases spread in the community, public health demands mitigation strategies, which \ninvolves social distancing and closing other communal spaces (schools, workplaces, etc.) \nto protect those most vulnerable to disease.  Jails and prisons are unable to adequately \nprovide social distancing or meet mitigation recommendations as described above. \n24. The time to act is now. Data from other settings demonstrate what happens when jails \nand prisons are unprepared for COVID-19. To date, few  state or federal prison systems \nhave adequate (or any) pandemic preparedness plans in place. Systems are just \nbeginning to screen and isolate people on entry and perhaps place visitor restrictions, \nbut this is wholly inadequate when staff and vendors can still come to work sick and \n                                                 \n5 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Situation Summary, Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (March 14, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary.html. \n6 Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, \nChina: a retrospective cohort study.

Systems are challenged to respond to COVID-19 guidelines that are modified on a near-\ndaily basis. It may be impossible to adequately respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, \nwhile also respecting the rights and dignity of people who are incarcerated.    \nIV.  Possible Risks of COVID-19 in Federal Bureau of Prisons Facilities in Danbury, \nConnecticut \n \n26. From approximately 2017-2018, I volunteered to provide AIDS Awareness Programming \nfor all women housed at the Camp and the Satellite Low (FSL) facilities at FCI Danbury.  \nIn doing so, I interacted with the resident inmates in common meetings areas on a \nmonthly basis in groups as small as 10 and as large as 100.  I have additionally toured all \nareas of the FSL facility in January 2018 with leadership from the National Association \nof Women Judges.  I last entered the facilities in approximately Summer 2018. \n27. The FSL facility is comprised of a single large dormitory style room, in which all of the \nwomen sleep on bunks.  There is also a library, a laundry room, a group meeting area, \nand a space for exercise.  In the adjoining building, there are multiple classrooms and \nmeeting spaces.  There was an infirmary staffed intermittently by a physician or nurse \npractitioner, who was available for sick call.  For other medical needs, women were \nbrought into the men’s facility to see the healthcare provider by appointment.  All serious \nmedical needs and specialty visits were referred to the nearby Danbury Hospital.  Per the \nBOP webpage, as of April 23, 2020, there were 165 women housed at FSL.  The layout \nof the space would make it impossible for these women to practice social distancing. \n28. When I last visited the Camp, it was comprised of a single floor of cells, each of which \nheld 2-3 women.  I understand that the building has since been reconfigured and the \nwomen are now housed in large dormitory style rooms. Per the BOP webpage, as of April \n23, 2020, there were 153 women housed at the Camp.  Dormitory style housing makes it \nimpossible for prisoners to practice social distancing. \n29.  Per BOP reports, as of April 23, 2020, there are 15 inmates with confirmed COVID-19 \ninfection, 32 staff members, and 1 death.  These numbers do not include the number of \ninmates and staff who previously tested positive and have since recovered.  For example, \non April 15, a news article said that BOP reported 44 inmates and 39 staff infected at FCI \nDanbury. It is unclear in which compound the COVID+ inmates resided on the Danbury \nBOP campus.  Given that all spaces in both women’s facilities on the Danbury BOP \ncampus are communal, there is high likelihood that if a single case entered the facility, \nmany more will follow in what some have called a “tinderbox scenario.” The large \nnumber of cases in FCI Danbury to date reflects widespread disease in the surrounding \ncommunity and is evidence that FCI Danbury is unable to mitigate or contain the spread \nof disease.  \n \n30. During my visit to FSL in January 2018, I had the opportunity to meet with many of the \nwomen to discuss their experiences of confinement without any correctional officers \npresent.  The women I met with had significant medical issues, including serious \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-1   Filed 06/16/20   Page 8 of 9\n \ncardiovascular, neurologic, and psychiatric conditions.  They described significant delays \nin receiving medical attention for issues both large and small.  Any delays in access to \ncare that already exist in normal circumstances will only become worse during an \noutbreak, making it especially difficult for the facilities to contain any infections and to \ntreat those who are infected. \n31. Failure to provide individuals with continuation of the treatment they were receiving in \nthe community, or even just interruption of treatment, for chronic underlying health \nconditions will result in increased risk of morbidity and mortality related to these chronic \nconditions.  \n32. Failure to provide individuals adequate medical care for their underlying chronic health \nconditions results in increased risk of COVID-19 infection and increased risk of \ninfection-related morbidity and mortality if they do become infected. \n33. People with underlying chronic mental health conditions need adequate access to \ntreatment for these conditions throughout their period of detention.  Failure to provide \nadequate mental health care, as may happen when health systems in jails and prisons are \ntaxed by COVID-19 outbreaks, may result in poor health outcomes.  Moreover, mental \nhealth conditions may be exacerbated by the stress of incarceration during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including isolation and lack of visitation.  \n34. Failure to keep accurate and sufficient medical records will make it more difficult for \nfacilities to identify vulnerable individuals in order to both monitor their health and \nprotect them from infection.  Inadequate screening and testing procedures in facilities \nincrease the widespread COVID-19 transmission.  \n35. Many women at FSL spoke only Spanish and reported significant challenges \nparticipating in groups and classes, which were at the time only offered in English.  \nLanguage barriers will similarly prevent the effective identification of individuals who \nare particularly vulnerable or may have symptoms of COVID-19. Similarly, the failure to \nprovide necessary aids to individuals who have auditory or visual disabilities could also \nlimit the ability to identify and monitor symptoms of COVID-19.   \n36. Facilities with a track record of neglecting individuals with acute pain and serious health \nneeds under ordinary circumstances are more likely to be ill-equipped to identify, \nmonitor, and treat a COVID-19 epidemic. \n37. Similarly, facilities with a track record of failing to adequately manage single individuals \nin need of emergency care are more likely to be seriously ill-equipped and under-\nprepared when a number of people will need urgent care simultaneously, as would occur \nduring a COVID-19 epidemic.  \n38. For individuals in facilities that have experienced these problems in the past, the \nexperience of an epidemic and the lack of care while effectively trapped can itself be \ntraumatizing, compounding the trauma of incarceration.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-1   Filed 06/16/20   Page 9 of 9\n \nV.  Conclusion and Recommendations \n \n39. Reducing the size of the population in jails and prisons is crucial to reducing the level of \nrisk both for those within those facilities and for the community at large. As such, from a \npublic health perspective, it is my recommendation that individuals who can safely and \nappropriately remain in the community not be placed in BOP facilities at this time. I also \nrecommend that individuals who are already in these facilities should be evaluated for \nrelease. \n40. This is more important still for individuals with preexisting conditions (e.g., heart disease \nand hypertension, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, suppressed immune system, \nmorbid obesity, diabetes) or who are over the age of 65.  \n41. Health in jails and prisons is community health. Protecting the health of individuals who \nare detained in and work in these facilities is vital to protecting the health of the wider \ncommunity.  \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \n \n \nApril 2__4, 2020           _______________________ \nWilton, Connecticut           Dr. Jaimie Meyer \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-2   Filed 06/16/20   Page 1 of 14\nEXHIBIT \nB\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-2   Filed 06/16/20   Page 2 of 14\n1 \n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDECLARATION OF PROFESSOR JUDITH RESNIK REGARDING  \nENLARGEMENT AND THE USE OF PROVISIONAL REMEDIES FOR DETAINED \nINDIVIDUALS \n \n \nI have been asked to make this declaration to explain my \nunderstanding  of  the  remedies, both  provisional  and  permanent, \nthat federal judges can provide to people who are incarcerated and \nfacing the threat of COVID-19. Because I have practiced in the \nDistrict  of  Connecticut  for  decades  and  represented  prisoners \nbefore the federal court here, I have had personal experience with \nthe use of enlargement in habeas corpus cases. Given that this \nprovisional  remedy  is  not  regularly  discussed  in  reported \ndecisions or in academic analyses, I believe that my experiences \nand knowledge can be useful to the Court. This opinion is mine and \nis not that of the institutions with which I am affiliated. I \ndeclare that the following is a true and accurate account of my \nown  work  as  a  lawyer,  of  the  pertinent  legal  principles  as  I \nunderstand  them,  and  of  how  these  precepts  can  apply  in  this \nunprecedented context. \n \n \nMy Background \n \n     \n1.  I have worked on occasion as a lawyer, including in the \nclinical programs at Yale Law School and at U.S.C. I have appeared \nbefore the United States Supreme Court and in federal district and \nappellate courts. I have also been appointed by federal judges to \nassist  in  issues  arising  in  large-scale  litigation.  Below,  I \nprovide a few aspects of my work particularly relevant to this \ndeclaration. I attach my resume as Exhibit A to this Declaration. \n \n2.  From 1977 until 1980, I was a supervising attorney at \nYale  Law  School’s  clinical  program,  which  then  provided  legal \nservices to federal prisoners housed at F.C.I. Danbury. \n \n3.  I am now the Arthur Liman Professor of Law at Yale Law \nSchool  where  I  teach  courses,  including  on  federal  and  state \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-2   Filed 06/16/20   Page 3 of 14\n2 \n \ncourts;  procedure;  large-scale  litigation;  federalism;  and \nincarceration.  \n \n4.  I have taught law for decades. Much of my focus has been \non  the  role  and  function  of  courts,  and  the  relationship  of \ngovernments  to  their  populations.  I  regularly  teach  the  class \nentitled Federal and State Courts in the Federal System. Readings \nfor students include materials on habeas corpus and on civil rights \nlitigation. \n \n5.  In 2018, I was awarded an Andrew Carnegie Fellowship to \nwork on a book, tentatively entitled Impermissible Punishments, \nwhich explores the impact of the 1960s civil rights revolution on \nthe kinds of punishments that governments can impose on people \nconvicted of crimes. Central to this book is the role that access \nto courts played for people held in detention.  \n \n6.  I am the Founding Director of the Arthur Liman Center \nfor Public Interest Law. The Liman Center teaches classes yearly, \nconvenes colloquia, does research projects, supports graduates of \nYale  Law  School  to  work  for  one  year  in  public  interest \norganizations, and is an umbrella for undergraduate fellowships at \neight institutions of higher education. \n \n7.  I  write  about  the  federal  courts;  adjudication  and \nalternatives such as arbitration; habeas corpus and incarceration; \nclass actions and multi-district litigation; the judicial role and \ncourts’  remedies;  gender  and  equality;  and  about  transnational \naspects of these issues. In recent years, I have spent a good deal \nof time doing research related to prisons. I have helped to develop \na series of reports that provide information nation-wide on the \nuse of solitary confinement. \n \n8.  In  February  of  2019,  I  testified  before  the  U.S. \nCommission on Civil Rights at its hearing on women in prison and \nco-authored a statement related to the isolation of many facilities \nfor women, their needs for education and work training, and the \ndiscipline to which they are subjected. See Statement submitted \nfor  the  record,  Women  in  Prison:  Seeking  Justice  Behind  Bars, \nbefore the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, March 22, 2019. The \nreport, published a few months ago, reference this testimony. See \nU.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Women in Prison: Seeking Justice \nBehind  Bars  (February  2020),  available  at \nhttps://www.usccr.gov/pubs/2020/02-26-Women-in-Prison.pdf. \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-2   Filed 06/16/20   Page 4 of 14\n3 \n \nRemedies Available in the Federal Courts: \nHabeas Corpus, Civil Rights Litigation, and Enlargement \n \n9.  In light of my knowledge of the federal law of habeas \ncorpus,  state  and  federal  court  relations,  procedure,  and \nremedies,  I  have  been  asked  by  counsel  for  the \npetitioners/plaintiffs to address the range of responses available \nto judges presiding in cases that raise claims related to COVID-\n19. \n \n10.  As I understand from public materials on the health risks \nof this disease, COVID-19 poses a deadly threat to the well-being \nand lives of people who contract this disease. To reduce the risk \nand spread of this disease, our governments have instructed us to \nstay  distant  from  others  and  to  take  measures  that  are \nextraordinary departures from our daily lives and routines. \n \n11.  Applying  these  urgent  medical  directives  to  prisons \nposes challenges in every jurisdiction. Governing legal principles \nabout prisoners’ access to courts were not framed to address COVID-\n19’s reality: that being inside prisons that are densely populated \ncan put large numbers of people (prisoners and staff) at risk of \nimmediate serious illness and potential death. \n \n12.  These unprecedented risks from and harms of COVID-19 in \nprison raise a new legal question: whether COVID-19 has turned \nsentences  which,  when  imposed,  were  (or  may  have  been) \nconstitutional into unconstitutional sentences during the pendency \nof this crisis.   \n \n13.  When  sentencing  people  to  a  term  of  years  of \nincarceration, judges had no authority to impose putting a person \nat  grave  risk  of  serious  illness  and  death  as  part  of  the \npunishment for the offense. Now, such grave risks and harms can \narise from the fact of incarceration. \n \n14.  A recent Supreme Court case, Montgomery v. Louisiana, \n136  S.Ct.  718  (2016),  provides  an  analogous  situation  -  a \nconstitutional-when-sentenced but unconstitutional-now sentence. \nThe Court determined that, in light of new understandings of the \nlimits of brain development in juveniles, sentences of life without \nparole (LWOP) imposed on individuals who had committed crimes when \nunder  the  age  of  eighteen  were  lawful  when  issued  but  became \nunconstitutional. As a consequence, parole boards or courts had to \nreconsider whether LWOP remained appropriate. COVID-19 raises a \nparallel  question,  as  it  requires  courts  to  address  whether \nsentences lawful at imposition can (at least temporarily) no longer \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-2   Filed 06/16/20   Page 5 of 14\n4 \n \nbe served in prisons because otherwise, the sentence would become \nan unconstitutional form of punishment. In normal times, using \nMontgomery v. Louisiana as a guide, federal judges could remit \neligible individuals to state courts and parole boards. But in \nthese abnormal times, the speed at which decisions are made is \ncritical.  Therefore,  as  I  discuss  below,  provisional  remedies \n(enabling enlargement and release for some individuals and de-\ndensifying for others) are necessary.  \n \n15.  The  classic  and  longstanding  remedy  for  relief  from \nunconstitutional detention, conviction, and sentences is habeas \ncorpus. The Constitution enshrined the remedy of habeas corpus, \nwhich has a substantial common law history and is codified in \nfederal statutes. See generally Paul D. Halliday, Habeas Corpus \n(Harvard U. Press, 2012); Amanda L. Tyler, Habeas Corpus in Wartime \n(Oxford U. Press, 2017); Randy Hertz and James Liebman, Federal \nHabeas Corpus Practice and Procedure (2 volumes, 2019); Hart & \nWechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System, Chapter X1, \n1193-1164  (Richard  H.  Fallon,  Jr,  John  F.  Manning,  Daniel  J. \nMeltzer & David Shapiro, 7th ed., 2015). These citations are the \ntip of a vast and substantial literature that aims to understand \nthe history and law of habeas corpus. \n \n \nThe Legal Thicket \n \n16.  As is familiar, in federal courts, federal petitioners \nfile under 28 U.S.C. §2255 (post-conviction motions) and under \n§2241  (the  general  habeas  statute),  both  of  which  are  civil \nactions.  \n \n17.  For example, when I worked at Yale Law School in its \nclinical program in the late 1970s, we filed lawsuits for federal \nprisoners predicated on 28 U.S.C. §2241 as well as (in appropriate \nsituations) on 28 U.S.C. §1331 (general question jurisdiction) and \n28 U.S.C. §1361 (mandamus), and in several instances, we filed \ncases  as  class  actions.  In  the  mid-1970s,  the  Supreme  Court \nprovided rules and forms for §2254 and §2255 filings. The Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure supplement those rules.  \n \n18.  Congress  has  recognized  that  federal  judges  are \nauthorized  under  the  habeas  statutes  to  “summarily  hear  and \ndetermine the facts, and dispose of the matter as law and justice \nrequire.”  See  28  U.S.C.  §2243.  In  addition  to  this  statutory \nauthority,  federal  judicial  power  is  predicated  on  the \nconstitutional protection of the writ and on the common law. \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-2   Filed 06/16/20   Page 6 of 14\n5 \n \n19.  Congress has channeled and circumscribed some of federal \njudicial authority through the Antiterrorism and Effective Death \nPenalty  Act  of  1996  (AEDPA)  and,  relatedly,  under  the  Prison \nLitigation Reform Act (PLRA) of 1996. Moreover, the Supreme Court \nhas issued many decisions interpreting the prior habeas statutes, \nthe 1996 revisions in AEDPA, and the intersection of habeas and \ncivil rights claims brought under 42 U.S.C. §1983. The result is \na  dense  arena  of  law  and  doctrine  that  can  be  daunting  for \nlitigants and jurists alike. \n \n20.  Some Supreme Court decisions, written to address claims \nby state prisoners, have delineated litigation focused on the fact \nor duration of confinement, for which release is the remedy and \nhabeas is the preferred route, from challenges to conditions of \nconfinement, for which the Court has required use of 42 U.S.C. \n§1983. See, e.g., Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475 (1978); Heck \nv. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994).  Yet that distinction is hard to \napply,  and  many  opinions  have  identified  that  the  overlap,  as \nexemplified by Mohammad v. Close, 540 U.S. 744 (2004), Wilkinson \nv. Dotson, 544 U.S. 74 (2005), and by other Supreme Court and lower \ncourt decisions. \n \n21.  COVID-19 poses a new and painful context in which to \nundertake that analysis. Some reported decisions addressing the \nconstitutional  right  of  prisoners  that  officials  not  be \n“deliberately indifferent to serious medical needs” consider those \nEighth Amendment claims to be appropriate for §1983 because they \nrelate  to  conditions.  But  this  deadly  disease  turns  ordinary \nconditions into potentially lethal threats of illness for which \nthe  remedy  to  consider  is  release  of  at  least  some  prisoners \nbecause density puts people at medical risk.  \n \n22.  Because COVID-19 can end people’s lives unexpectedly and \nabruptly, COVID-19 claims turn the condition of being incarcerated \ninto a practice that affects the fact or duration of confinement. \nIn my view, COVID-19 claims, therefore, collapse the utility and \npurpose  of  drawing  distinctions  between  what  once  could  more \ncoherently be distinguished.  \n \n23.  Courts need also to consider how COVID-19 fits (or not) \nwith provisions of AEDPA and the parameters of the PLRA. Again, \nnew problems have emerged. For example, in some contexts for state \nand federal prisoners, a question of exhaustion of remedies arises. \nOften one issue is the ability of the executive branch to respond \nquickly. In the COVID context, day by day, the risk of illness \nincreases  for  prisoners  and  staff,  which  endanger  health  care \nresources.  Exhaustion  would  be  “futile”  if  other  branches  of \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-2   Filed 06/16/20   Page 7 of 14\n6 \n \ngovernment are not prompt in response and if people become sick, \nrisks skyrocket, and deaths occur.  \n \n24.  “Futility” thus needs to be analyzed in terms not only \nof the capacity of institutions but in terms of the likelihood \nthat the people seeking relief will be well enough to have the \ncapacity to do so, and that the remedy provided will be effective \ngiven the alleged harm. \n  \n25.  Other  legal  issues  include  when  class  actions  are \nappropriate and the criteria of Rule 23 are met; the merits of \narguments about unconstitutional sentences and conditions; and the \nrange of remedies.  \n \n \nThe Availability of Provisional Remedies \n \n26.  The  reason  to  flag  some  of  the  many  issues  that \nlitigation of both habeas petitions and civil rights cases entail \nis  to  underscore  the  importance  of  considering  provisional \nremedies when cases are pending. In general, time is required for \nlawyers to brief and for judges to interpret and apply the law. \nBut waiting days in a world of COVID infections can result in the \nloss of life. \n \n27.  While courts have not faced COVID before, they have faced \nurgent situations, which is why provisional legal remedies exist. \nCourts have two ways to preserve the status quo – which here means \nprotecting to the extent possible the health of prisoners, staff, \nand  providers  of  medical  services.  One  route  is  the  use  of \ntemporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions. These \nremedies  require  no  explanation  because  they  are  familiar \nprocedures. See Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 65. \n \n28.  Another option is an aspect of federal judicial power \nthat is less well known. District courts have authority when habeas \npetitions are pending to “enlarge” the custody of petitioners. \n“Enlargement” is a term that, as far as I am aware, is used only \nin the context of habeas. (More familiar terms for individuals \npermitted to leave detention are “release” and “bail,” and some \ndecision that “enlarge” petitioners use those words rather than \nenlargement). \n \n29.  The distinction is that enlargement is not release. The \nperson remains in custody - even as the place of custody is changed \nand thus “enlarged” from a particular prison to a hospital, half-\nway house, a person’s home, or other setting. Enlargement is a \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-2   Filed 06/16/20   Page 8 of 14\n7 \n \nprovisional remedy that modifies custody by expanding the site in \nwhich it takes place. In some ways, enlargement resembles a prison \nfurlough. \n \n30.  Enlargement  has  special  relevance  when  the  PLRA  has \napplication. As I understand the PLRA’s rules on the “release” of \nprisoners, enlargement would not apply, as enlargement is not a \nrelease order. And, of course, interpreting the many directives of \nthe  PLRA  in  light  of  COVID  entails  more  elaboration  that  my \ncomments here. \n \n31.   The need to work through that statute and case law is \nanother reason why the availability of provisional remedies is so \nimportant. Enlargement provides an opportunity for increasing the \nsafety of prisoners, staff, and their communities while judges \nconsider a myriad of complex legal questions. \n \n32.  I  first  encountered  the  provisional  remedy  of \nenlargement in the 1970s, when I represented a prisoner – Robert \nDrayton – who was confined at F.C.I. Danbury and who filed a habeas \npetition  alleging  that  the  U.S.  Parole  Commission  had \nunconstitutionally rescinded his parole.  \n \n33.  The Honorable T.F. Gilroy Daly, a federal judge sitting \nin the District of Connecticut, granted Mr. Drayton’s request for \nenlargement  while  the  decision  on  the  merits  was  pending.  Mr. \nDrayton returned to his home in Philadelphia and came back to \nConnecticut for the merits hearing. Judge Daly thereafter ruled in \nhis favor; that decision was upheld in part and reversed in part. \nSee Drayton v. U.S. Parole Commission, 445 F. Supp. 305 (D. Conn. \n1978), affirmed in part, Drayton v. McCall, 584 F.2d 1208 (2d Cir. \n1978). \n \n34.  Judge  Daly  did  not  write  a  decision  explaining  the \nenlargement.  Given that I knew that the use of enlargement was \nnot always recorded in published decisions and that enlargement \nhad special relevance here, I decided I should learn more about \nother courts’ discussion of this provisional remedy.  \n \n35.  The provisional district court remedy of enlargement is \nnot mentioned directly in in federal rules governing the lower \nfederal courts. In contrast, at the appellate level, Federal Rule \nof Appellate Procedure (FRAP) 23 provides in part that: \n \nWhile a decision not to release a prisoner is under review, \nthe court or judge rendering the decision, or the court of \nappeals,  or  the  Supreme  Court,  or  a  judge  or  justice  of \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-2   Filed 06/16/20   Page 9 of 14\n8 \n \neither court, may order that the prisoner be: (1) detained \nin the custody from which release is sought; (2) detained in \nother  appropriate  custody;  or  (3)  released  on  personal \nrecognizance,  with  or  without  surety.  While  a  decision \nordering  the  release  of  a  prisoner  is  under  review,  the \nprisoner  must  –  unless  the  court  or  judge  rendering  the \ndecision, or the court of appeals, or the Supreme Court, or \na judge or justice of either court orders otherwise – be \nreleased on personal recognizance, with or without surety. \n \nAs that excerpt reflects, the Rule uses language familiar in the \ncontext  of  bail  and  provides  that  appellate  courts  may  also \ndetermine  that  a  petitioner  be  detained  in  “other  appropriate \ncustody.” \n \n36.  Federal courts at all level are authorized by Congress \nto decide habeas cases “as law and justice requires.” 28 U.S.C. \n§2243. The case law also references that, at the district court \nlevel,  the  authority  to  release  a  habeas  petitioner  pending  a \nruling on the merits stems from courts’ inherent powers. See, e.g., \nMapp v. Reno, 241 F.3d 221, 226 (2d Cir. 2001). And, as I noted, \nin these reported decisions, the terms “bail” or “release” are \nsometimes used instead of or in addition to “enlargement.” \n \n37.  In  the  last  weeks,  the  saliency  of  enlargement  has \nprompted me to review more of the law surrounding it. To gather \nmaterials and opinions on enlargement, I asked two law students, \nKelsey Stimson of Yale Law School and Ally Daniels of Stanford Law \nSchool, to help me research what judges have said about enlargement \nand what others have written. Below I detail some of the governing \ncase law. The Hertz & Liebman Treatise on Habeas also has a section \n(§14.2) devoted to this issue. \n \n38.  Some of the decisions involve requests for release when \nhabeas petitions were pending from state prisoners, and others \nfrom federal prisoners, or from people in immigration detention. \nFurther, several appellate cases address the issue of whether a \ndistrict court order on enlargement was appealable as of right or \nsubject to mandamus. \n \n39.  My central point is that, amidst these various debates \nabout  appealability  and  the  test  for  enlargement/release,  most \ncircuits have recognized that district courts have the authority \nto order release. See e.g., Woodcock v. Donnelly, 470 F.2d 93, 43 \n(1st Cir. 1972); Mapp v. Reno, 241 F.3d 221, 226 (2d Cir. 2001); \nLandano v. Rafferty, 970 F.2d 1230, 1239 (3d Cir. 1992); Calley v. \nCallaway, 496 F.2d 701, 702 (5th Cir. 1974); Dotson v. Clark, 900 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-2   Filed 06/16/20   Page 10 of 14\n9 \n \nF.2d 77, 79 (6th Cir. 1990); Cherek v. United States, 767 F.2d \n335, 337 (7th Cir. 1985); Martin v. Solem, 801 F.2d 324, 329 (8th \nCir. 1986); Pfaff v. Wells, 648 F.2d 689, 693 (10th Cir. 1981): \nBaker v. Sard, 420 F.2d 1342, 1342-44 (D.C. Cir. 1969). \n \n40.  The  Fourth  and Eleventh  Circuits  appear,  albeit  less \ndirectly, to recognize enlargement authority. See Gomez v. United \nStates, 899 F.2d 1124, 1125 (11th Cir. 1990); United States v. \nPerkins, 53 F. App’x 667, 669 (4th Cir. 2002). A Ninth Circuit \nopinion  from  1989  likewise  appears  to  recognize  the  power  of \ndistrict courts to grant release pending a habeas decision where \nthere are “special circumstances or a high probability of success.” \nSee  Land  v.  Deeds,  878  F.2d  318  (9th  Cir.  1989).  Thereafter, \nanother decision, In re Roe, described the Circuit as not having \nruled on the issue in terms of state prisoners. See 257 F.3d 1077 \n(9th Cir. 2001).1 \n \n41.  A  discrete  question  is  the  standard  for  enlarging \npetitioners. To obtain an order for release pending the merits of \nhabeas decision, the petitioner must demonstrate “extraordinary \ncircumstances” and that the underlying claim raises “substantial \nclaims.” See e.g. Mapp v. Reno, 241 F.3d 221, 226 (2d Cir. 2001). \nCourts  have  also  discussed  that  release  is  appropriate  when \n“necessary to make the habeas remedy effective.” Mapp, 241 F.3d at \n226; see also Landano v. Rafferty, 970 F.2d 1230, 1239 (3d Cir. \n1992).  As  that  Third  Circuit  decision  explained,  release  was \n“available  ‘only  when  the  petitioner  has  raised  substantial \nconstitutional  claims  upon  which  he  has  a  high  probability  of \nsuccess, and also when extraordinary or exceptional circumstances \nexist which make the grant of bail necessary to make the habeas \nremedy effective.’” \n \n42.  Some judges have interpreted the “substantial questions” \nprong to require the underlying claim to have a “high probability \nof success.” See Hall v. San Francisco Superior Court, No. C 09-\n5299 PJH, 2010 WL 890044, *1 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 8, 2010); In re \nSouels, 688 F. App'x 134, 135 (3d Cir. 2017). That test resembles \nstandards for preliminary injunctive relief and for stays, which \n                                                 \n1 Subsequent lower court cases debated whether district courts do possess such \nauthority. See, e.g., Hall v. San Francisco Sup. Ct., 2010 WL 890044, at *2 \n(N.D. Cal. Mar. 8, 2010) (“Based on the overwhelming authority [of other circuit \ncourts] in support, the court concludes for purposes of the instant motion that \nit has the authority to release Hall pending a decision on the merits.”); United \nStates v. Carreira, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31210, at *4, (D. Haw. Mar. 10, 2016) \n(“[T]his Court declines to address the merits of Petitioner’s bail requests in \nthe absence of definitive guidance from the Ninth Circuit regarding the scope \nof this Court’s bail authority.”). \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-2   Filed 06/16/20   Page 11 of 14\n10 \n \ninclude an assessment of the likelihood of success on the merits \nand of whether the balance of hardships tips in favor of altering \nthe status quo. (And, of course, more can be said about the nuances \nof these bodies of law as well.) \n \n43.  A  few  cases  focus  on  the  health  of  a  petitioner  as \ncentral  to  the  conclusion  that  “extraordinary  circumstances” \nexist. For example, in Johnston v. Marsh, the petitioner, Alfred \nAckerman, brought a habeas claim alleging that he was convicted in \nPennsylvania through a trial that lacked “due process.” 227 F.2d \n528 (3d Cir. 1955). Ackerman asked for release pending a decision \non  the  merits  of  his  habeas  petition;  he  argued  that  he  had \nadvanced  diabetes  and  was  “rapidly  progressing  towards  total \nblindness.” Id. at 529. The district court authorized Ackerman to \nbe  released  to  a  private  hospital.  The  prison  warden  (Frank \nJohnston) went to the Third Circuit invoking sought   writs of \nprohibition and mandamus to order the district court (Judge Marsh) \nto change his ruling. Rejecting the petitions, the Third Circuit \naffirmed that district courts possessed the  authority to order \nrelocation while the habeas petition was pending. Johnson v. Marsh \nhas been cited in more recent cases to illustrate that findings of \nextraordinary  circumstances  may  “be  limited  to  situations \ninvolving poor health or the impending completion of the prisoner’s \nsentence.” Landano, 970 F.2d at 1239. \n \n44.  The  court  in  In  re  Souels  addressed  what  showing  of \nhealth problems constituted extraordinary circumstances. See 688 \nF. App’x at 135-36. Sean Souels, who was serving a 46-month federal \nprison sentence, petitioned for a writ of mandamus directing the \ncourt to rule on his writ of habeas corpus and sought release \npending the decision. Id. at 134. The court denied Souels bail \nbecause “he [did] not describe his medical conditions in any detail \nor explain how he cannot manage his health issues while he is in \nprison.” Id. \n \n45.  Health is not the only extraordinary circumstance that \nhas been the basis for enlargement. For example, in United States \nv. Josiah, William Josiah brought a writ of habeas corpus after \nthe Supreme Court invalidated the residual clause of the Armed \nCareer Criminal Act (ACCA) and altered the method for determining \nwhether prior convictions qualify as violent felonies under the \nACCA. 2016 WL 1328101, at *2 (D. Haw. Apr. 5, 2016). Josiah, who \nwas  serving  a  federal  prison  sentence  argued  that  his  prior \nconvictions did not qualify as violent felonies and that he should \nnot be subject to the fifteen-year mandatory minimum. The district \ncourt concluded that because the issue of retroactivity was pending \nbefore the Supreme Court and Josiah would have served his full \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-2   Filed 06/16/20   Page 12 of 14\n11 \n \nsentence if the Court held its prior ruling retroactive, release \npending the higher court’s ruling was appropriate. Id. at *4-6. \n \n46.  In  circumstances  similar  to  Josiah,  a  district  judge \nsitting in the Central District of Illinois issued three orders \ngranting release, termed bail, to petitioners pending resolution \nof their habeas claims. See Zollicoffer v. United States, No. 15-\n03337, 2017 WL 79636 (C.D. Ill. Jan. 9, 2017); United States v. \nJordan, No. 04-20008, 2016 WL 6634852 (C.D. Ill. Nov. 9, 2016); \nSwanson v. United States, No. 15-03262, 2016 WL 5422048 (C.D. Ill. \nSept. 28, 2016). \n \n47.  Another case involved enlargement in the context of the \nmilitary. See Gengler v. U.S. through its Dep't of Def. & Navy, \n2006 WL 3210020, at *6 (E.D. Cal. Nov. 3, 2006). As that court \nexplained, a “district court has the inherent power to enlarge a \npetitioner on bond pending hearing and decision on his petition \nfor writ of habeas corpus.” Id. at *5. The judge also noted that \na “greater showing must be made by a petitioner seeking bail in a \ncriminal conviction habeas ‘than would be required in a case where \napplicant  had  sought  to  attack  by  writ  of  habeas  corpus  an \nincarceration  not  resulting  from  a  judicial  determination  of \nguilt.’” The court used the test of “exceptional circumstances \nand, at a minimum, substantial questions as to the merits.” Id. at \n13. The court found exceptional circumstances” based on the fact \nthat the petitioner had been admitted to business school, had been \ngranted permission by his commanding officer to attend, and would \nbe forced to drop out if his custody were not enlarged. The court \nalso ruled that “substantial questions as to the merits” existed \nbecause  of  alleged  government’s  errors  in  drafting  the \npetitioner’s service agreement. Id. at *6. \n \n48.  As of this writing, I have located three reported cases \non COVID. (Given the pace of litigation, I assume that more may \nhave been filed and some decided.)  \n \n49.  On April 7, the Honorable Jesse Furman, sitting in the \nSouthern District of New York, granted on consent a motion styled \n“for bail” (the term used in the Second Circuit Mapp decision). \nJudge Furman ordered immediate release under specified conditions, \npending the adjudication of the Section 2255 Motion. See United \nStates v. Nkanga, No. 18-CR-00730 (S.D.N.Y., Apr. 7, 2020). \n \n50.  A second case involves a class action filed by Craig \nWilson and others. See Wilson v. Williams, No. 4:20-cv-00794-JG, \n2020  WL  1940882,  at  *1  (N.D.  Ohio  Apr.  22,  2020).  Seeking  to \nrepresent a class of all current and future prisoners of the Elkton \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-2   Filed 06/16/20   Page 13 of 14\n12 \n \nFederal  Correctional  Institution  (FCI)  and  a  subclass  of  the \nmedically vulnerable population, they sought relief because their \ncontinued incarceration subjected all FCI prisoners to substantial \nrisk of harm in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  \n \n51.  On April 22, 2020, the federal district court granted in \npart the request by the Wilson class for emergency relief, which \nincluded enlargement of a subclass of prisoners challenging the \nmanner in which the sentence was served and hence cognizable as a \nhabeas  petition.  See  Wilson  v. Williams,  No.  4:20-cv-00794-JG, \n2020  WL  1940882  (N.D.  Ohio  Apr.  22,  2020) \n \n52.  The third case has less relevance as it was brought by \nan unrepresented litigant, Richard Peterson, who had originally \nsought habeas corpus relief on a claim about education credits and \nthen filed an emergency request for release from a California state \nprison due to COVID-19. No. 2:19-CV-01480, 2020 WL 1640008, at *1 \n(E.D. Cal. Apr. 2, 2020). The district court noted that a class \naction raising COVID claims was pending in another federal court \nin  California  and  that,  while  the  court  had  the  authority  to \nrelease a person while a habeas petition was pending, Mr. Peterson \nhad not provided evidence sufficient to meet the test to do so. \n \nConclusion \n \n53.  In sum, COVID-19 is an unprecedented event that, in my \nview,  raises  the  legal  question  of  whether,  in  light  of  the \ngovernment  mandates  for  social distancing,  sentences  (that  had \nbeen lawful when they were imposed) cannot lawfully be served when \nthe setting puts an individual in a position of untenable risk. \nThus, habeas corpus – which addresses the constitutionality of \nsentences and offers the possibility of release and enlargement – \nproperly provides a jurisdictional basis and remedies for this \nsituation.  \n \n54.  I need also to note that, in recent years, the Supreme \nCourt has raised questions in many contexts about the remedial \npowers  of  federal  judges.  Whether  the  topic  is  nationwide \ninjunctions or commercial contracts, debates have occurred within \nthe Court about the authority of federal judges.  \n \n55.  Those cases do not address the extraordinary and painful \nmoment in which we are all living. Ordinary life has been up-ended \nin an effort to keep as many people as possible alive and not \ndebilitated by serious illness. Moreover, Supreme Court opinions \nhave  not  focused  on  the  relevance  of  remedial  debates  to  the \nsituation  were  confinement  can  put  entire  staffs  and  detained \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-2   Filed 06/16/20   Page 14 of 14\n13 \n \npopulations at mortal risk. Therefore, judges have the obligation \nand the authority to interpret statutes and the Constitution to \npreserve the lives of people living in and working in prisons. It \nis my hope that this account of earlier uses of enlargement in \nthis District and the dense account of case law and doctrine will \nbe of service to this Court and to the parties in understanding \nthe meaning and import of American law.  \n \n \n \nDated:  April 23, 2020 \n \n \n \n          __________________________ \nJudith Resnik \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-3   Filed 06/16/20   Page 1 of 4\nEXHIBIT \nC\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-3   Filed 06/16/20   Page 2 of 4\nDeclaration of Dianthe Martinez-Brooks \n \n \n1.  I am currently in custody at Danbury FCI in the minimum security women’s camp (the \n“Camp.” My Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) Register Number is 71331-050. \n \n2.  I am 50 years old. I have asthma, hypertension, arthritis, and systemic lupus \nerythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease. I take Atenolol for hypertension. For my \nasthma, I have a Proventil emergency inhaler and use an Asmanex Twisthaler \n(mometasone furoate inhalation powder, 220mg). Since my incarceration began, I have \nbeen prescribed steroids once for the joint and muscle inflammation associated with my \nlupus. \n \n3.  I am serving a sentence of 48 months for wire fraud. My release date is 6/25/2022.  \n \n4.  At the Camp, there are rooms and dorms containing bunk beds. There are 9 rooms, each \nthat can hold 4 to 5 women. There are four dorms: Dorms A, B, C, and D.  \n \n5.  Before the lockdown on April 15, there were approximately 43 women in the 9 small \nrooms. On April 15, these women from the rooms were moved to the dorms.  \n \n6.  I am currently housed in Dorm A. Dorm A has 48 women in it right now, who share 4 \nshowers and 3 toilets. Dorm B has 48 women sharing 5 toilets and 6 showers. In Dorm C, \n46 women share 5 toilets and 5 showers. In Dorm D, 7 women are currently sharing 3 \nshowers and 3 toilets.   \n \n7.  In the dorms, women sleep on bunk beds, with 2 women per bunk bed. The bunk beds are \nin cubicles. In many of the cubicles, the beds are positioned so they reach from one end \nof the cubicle to the other—so the only separation between the bed in one cubicle and the \nbed in the next is the wall of the cubicle, which does not reach to the ceiling. Beds \npositioned parallel to the wall of the cubicle are also not six feet away from beds in the \nnext cubicle.   \n \n8.  All cleaning in the Camp is done by prisoners, and cleaning has been sporadic. Many \nwomen have quit their jobs. Women are responsible for cleaning their own cubicles. \n \n9.  There is a common area in the Camp containing phones, computers, video chat machines, \nsinks for dishwashing, and hot water taps. There are also common recreation rooms \ncontaining tables, chairs, cards, and games. Women also share ice machines where they \nscoop out ice.   \n \n10. There are open bathrooms that can be used by all on the upper level and in the old \nvisiting room.  \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-3   Filed 06/16/20   Page 3 of 4\n11. We are currently on a lockdown at the Camp.  Each dorm has 45 minutes of recreation in \nthe morning and 1 hour of recreation later in the day. These are the only times of day that \nwe can access the common areas in the Camp with the phones, recreation rooms, etc. \n \n12. I know of two women who self-surrendered to the Camp at the end of March. One came \nstraight into the Camp and the other was quarantined first.  \n \n13. Some women have been told that they are on a list for home confinement and would be \nquarantined before released. On April 6, 23 women were put in Dorm C for quarantine. \nOn April 7, 5 more women were put in Dorm C. On April 10, they moved some women \nfrom Dorm C into Dorm D and then added an additional 28 women to both Dorm C and \nDorm D.  On April 15, they took all the women who were housed in the rooms and added \nthem to Dorms A, B, and C. At that time, the Camp went into lockdown. \n \n14. Of the approximately 56 women placed in quarantine in the first 2 weeks of April, I am \naware of only 4 that have left from Dorm D and one that has left from Dorm C. One of \nthese women was granted compassionate release by the court. I understand that 2 of the \nother releases were COVID-19 related. The others were at or near the end of their \nsentences.  \n \n15. Even though there is a lockdown, women from different dorms are continuing to \ncomingle. During recreation, women are visiting friends who live in different dorms.  \n \n16. Not all staff are regularly wearing masks and gloves. \n \n17. There is no hand sanitizer for use by prisoners or staff.  \n \n18. Staff are serving meals. Prisoners are used to assist in food preparation, cooking, and \ncleaning the kitchen.   \n \n19. Each day, staff move between all four dorms in the Camp for count, food delivery, and \ncommissary. We have staff in the Camp that have been at the other two facilities at FCI \nDanbury. Medical staff see prisoners at all three facilities.  \n \n20. Three correctional officers who have been at the Camp have said that they had COVID-\n19, including one who works in food service.   \n \n21. There is no actual medical clinic in the Camp. Instead, there are a series of offices: two \nare used by medical staff, one by dental staff, and one by psychology. RNs come for pill \nline in the morning and in the late afternoon. If you are sick, you must go to morning pill \nline and fill out a sick call request. You then must wait to be called in and it can take \ndays. If there is an emergency, a correctional officer must call for a medical professional \nto come to the Camp because there is not a medical professional at the Camp 24 hours a \nday.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-3   Filed 06/16/20   Page 4 of 4\n \n22. I have a severe peanut allergy. I had a reaction on April 15 when peanut butter was \nserved for dinner and I had to leave the dorm. To date, peanut butter has been served in \nthe dorm 7 times. Medical staff have told me that I should leave for at least an hour to \nallow the dorm to air out. I have expressed my concerns about this to staff repeatedly.  \n \n23. Since I have been incarcerated at FCI Danbury, I have had multiple problems accessing \nbasic medical care. In October 2019, I had difficulty being seen for an upper respiratory \ninfection and my daughter had to contact the facility. It took 8 days for me to be seen and \n11 days to get the medication that I needed. In February 2020, I was left without my \nasthma medication for more than 4 weeks when my prescription ran out. My daughter \nagain needed to contact the facility. My blood pressure medicine ran out on April 2 and \nmy prescription did not reach me until April 10.  \n \n24. Since my incarceration, I have only been prescribed steroids once for the joint and \nmuscle inflammation associated with my lupus and have not been brought to see a \nrheumatologist. I also suffer from migraines and TMJ and have not received treatment for \nthose conditions in BOP custody.  \n \n25. On March 26, 2020, I asked the warden for compassionate release.  \n \n26. I was given paperwork to sign on April 19 relating to home confinement and/or a halfway \nhouse. Then a new memo came out on 4/21/20 saying that if you haven’t completed 50% \nof your sentence you are ineligible. Another memo came out on 4/23/20 saying you must \nhave completed 25% of your time and have 18 months or less remaining on your \nsentence.  \n \n27. There has been no access to the law library for women working on current legal cases and \nno copy cards available to purchase.  \n \n28. I declare under the penalty of perjury that the contents of this declaration are true and \ncorrect to the best of my knowledge. I will sign a hard copy of this declaration at my \nearliest opportunity. \n \n \n______/s/_______________ \nDianthe Martinez-Brooks \n \nApril 26, 2020 \n \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-4   Filed 06/16/20   Page 1 of 12\nEXHIBIT \nD\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-4   Filed 06/16/20   Page 2 of 12\nDeclaration of Kenneth Cassidy \nI, Kenneth Cassidy, am over the age of 18 and fully competent to make the following \ndeclaration: \n1.  I am currently incarcerated at FCI Danbury.  My Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) \nRegister Number is 48169-054.  I arrived at FCI Danbury on January 21, 2020, my 54th \nbirthday. \n2.  I am assigned to D Unit.  D Unit is a dorm unit, can accommodate up to 80 \nprisoners, and currently houses approximately 66 prisoners. \n3.  I am serving a sentence of 5 years arising from a conviction for conspiracy to \ncommit wire fraud and willful failure to file an income tax return.  I have no violent offenses on \nmy record.  The BOP calculates my release date to be March 31, 2021.  My projected home \nconfinement release date is October 1, 2020.  At sentencing, the Court recommended to the BOP \nthat I serve the final year of my sentence at a halfway house. \n4.  While in the BOP, I have completed the 40-hour non-residential drug treatment \nprogram and taken courses on diabetes and personal finance.  I am on waiting lists to take \ncourses to become an OSHA-certified laborer and legal assistant.  I have never had an incident \nreport while in BOP. \n5.  I have had three heart attacks.  I have had pneumonia in my right lung more than \n20 times, and have been told that I have the lungs of a 70-year-old.  I suffer from many serious \nchronic medical conditions including asthma, coronary artery disease, hypertension, Prinzmetal \nangina, cervical disc disease, lumbar disc disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), \nBarrett’s esophagus, and diverticulitis resulting in a hernia in the colon wall.  I have a soft tissue \nmass on my upper cervical spine resulting in partial paralysis that requires immediate surgery \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-4   Filed 06/16/20   Page 3 of 12\nupon my release.  I cannot digest rice, beans or greens.  I am severely allergic to ragweed, \nshellfish, trees and chlorophyll (including in green vegetables).  I am morbidly obese. \n6.  My current medications include an albuterol inhaler, Lisinprol, Metropolol, \nAtorvastatin, Nitroglycerin, Docusate and Lasix, as well as breathing treatments and oxygen \ntreatments in the medical department as needed. \n7.  Our pharmacy is currently closed because the pharmacist is out.  Our medication \nis being shipped in from FCC Allenwood with several days’ delay.  As a result, I did not receive \nthe correct dose of my medication for two weeks in April. \n8.  The COVID-19 virus has ravaged FCI Danbury.  Approximately 80% of prisoners \nin my unit show flu-like symptoms including fever, coughing, body aches, shortness of breath, \nchest pressure, and headaches. \n9.  The prison staff’s response has been disrespectful, degrading, dehumanizing and \nthreatening.  Social worker Adamson has said to me, “It’s not that big.  Don’t worry about it.  \nWe got it under control,” “This is nothing more than an overblown flu.  You guys are all \nbecoming hypochondriacs.  You’re paranoid after watching too much television.  Stop watching \nthe TV.  Stop watching the news because it’s only going to make you guys paranoid over \nnothing,”   “Stop being a hypochondriac, it’s not going to get you out of prison,” and “Lay down, \ntake a Tylenol, there’s nothing we can do.” \n10.  Warden Easter and Associate Warden Comstock told us, in effect, we know it’s \ndifficult for you guys to social distance, so just try your best to do what you can.  That is the only \ninstruction we have received on social distancing. \n11.  For the last couple of weeks, an associate warden has come through the unit daily \nto take prisoners’ temperatures.  He approaches prisoners one at a time and aims a temperature \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-4   Filed 06/16/20   Page 4 of 12\nwand at our foreheads.  He stands so close to you that you could kiss him.  When a prisoner’s \ntemperature is taken, and there is no fever, he states the number loudly so that others are at ease.  \nWhen a prisoner has a fever, he states the number softly so that only the prisoner can hear, if he \nstates it at all. \n12.  Just because you have a fever doesn’t mean you are taken off the unit.  In the \nbeginning, there was such chaos that the staff couldn’t handle the influx and even if you had a \nfever, you stayed in the unit.  Until recently, a prisoner with a low-grade fever of 100 or 101 \ndegrees would be given Tylenol for 2 or 3 days to see if the Tylenol can break the fever. \n13.  For the last couple weeks, prisoners with a fever have been taken to medical.  \nSometimes, however, a prisoner has a fever and the associate warden attributes the temperature \nreading to equipment error.  When the temperature wand comes up with a low-grade fever, the \nassociate warden will “reset” it and pretend to take another reading.  He will announce another \nnumber, but he won’t even aim the wand at the prisoner’s forehead.  The associate warden does \nnot show the prisoners the LCD screen on the wand that displays the temperature, so we have to \ngo by whatever he tells us. \n14.  If the associate warden acknowledges that a prisoner has a temperature, then he \nwill escort the prisoner to medical.  Prisoners who have gone to medical have told me what \nhappens there.  At medical, the prisoner is given two or three Tylenol and told that the wand is \nnot working properly and that they do not have a fever, and then sent right back to the unit.  \nOne of the prisoners who went to medical and came right back has been vomiting blood all \nweek.  When his temperature was taken in the unit, he was told that he has a 101.2 degree fever.  \nWhen he got to medical, he was given Tylenol, told that his temperature is 98.7 degrees, and sent \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-4   Filed 06/16/20   Page 5 of 12\nback to the unit.  They never took his temperature in medical.  When he got back to the unit and \ntold us all this, his forehead was hot. \n15.  Although most of us are sick, only three prisoners with a fever have been taken \nout of the unit and quarantined.  These prisoners were taken to A Unit, a cell-based isolation unit.    \nTwo of these three prisoners returned to our unit about 8-10 days after testing positive for \nCOVID-19.  One was taken out on March 27 and the other was taken out on March 29.   \nI understand that when they were in the isolation unit, they were given two Tylenol per day.  \nOtherwise, they did not receive any medical treatment.  Shortly after they both returned to my \nunit on April 6, the unit became deathly sick.  Prisoners were up in the middle of the night \ncoughing and gasping for air.  It was at its worst from approximately April 7 to April 12.  \nThe third prisoner remains in isolation. \n16.  The prison recently opened another isolation unit, K Unit, which was condemned \nlast winter for asbestos.  Even though the BOP was supposed to renovate this unit and remove \nthe asbestos, and has not done so, the prison is justifying its use as a temporary. \n17.  The COVID-19 virus has decimated the medical department.  I was told by the \nassistant health administrator, Mr. Dakote, and a physician assistant, Mr. Quest, that our regular \nphysicians have been out for weeks.  Sick call requests have been going unanswered for weeks.  \nIn the last month, I have made three requests regarding an abnormal tumor near my rectum, and \nwas told “that’s not an emergency” even though there is dark black blood in my bowels on \noccasion.  The tumor has grown in the past month, obstructing my bowels, and medical has still \nnot evaluated me.  If you don’t have a fever, you have no access to a physician. \n18.  All sick call triage for our unit is being handled by a social worker who has no \nformal medical training.  The social worker, Ms. Adamson, has told us “you are all fucking \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-4   Filed 06/16/20   Page 6 of 12\nchildren with nothing more than a flu so stop your shit you’re not going home early.”  She has \nsaid, “if you did the crime stop crying and do the time.”  She has said, “I don’t need medical \ntraining to tell you you’re not sick so go lay the fuck down.”  Prisoners who present for sick call \ntriage who do not have a fever are denied access to any further medical treatment.  Sometimes \nMs. Adamson brings along the dental hygienist from the facility to help with the triage. \n19.  Ms. Adamson is also the staff member handling all CARES Act and \ncompassionate release requests. \n20.  Before the pandemic, we ate in the mess hall with several other units.  From \napproximately March 29 until April 5, we ate in the mess hall with another unit.  From \napproximately April 6 until April 10, our unit ate in the mess hall by itself.  Since then, we have \nbeen eating all meals in our unit. \n21.  Food service is closed.  The COs are preparing our food.  Food is delivered on a \nbread rack and is placed in your unit directly on your chair or on your bed.  We only have \nlaundry once a week at the most, and only if there is hot water and a staff member available.  \nAs a result, we cannot clean the stains on our bedding and clothes from when staff drop the trays \non our chairs and beds. \n22.  Our meals are smaller.  The portions were cut in half and we are not meeting the \nnutritional guidance of 2,000 calories per day.  Breakfast will be one sour milk with one small \npiece of half-cooked cake batter.  Lunch will be some type of hot food with a green vegetable or \nhalf-cooked rice as filler.  Lunch the other day was four ounces of some type of cream salad with \ngreen peas.  For dinner we are given a hamburger bun and a piece of meat, or four ounces of tuna \nwith one piece of bread. \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-4   Filed 06/16/20   Page 7 of 12\n23.  All special medical diets are suspended indefinitely.  I was prescribed a special \nmedical diet by Dr. Greene and Dr. Febregas-Schindler on January 21, which was updated and \nmodified by Dr. Febregas-Schindler on March 11.  I am on a special medical diet of no green \nvegetables or plants due to my allergy to chlorophyll, and no rice and beans due to my \ndiverticulosis.  Despite this I have been given food with greens, rice and beans.  I informed \nMs. Adamson about my special medical diet not being met, and she responded, “Mr. Cassidy, \nI have other more important things to address with this virus being widespread than worry about \nwhat you can or cannot eat.” \n24.  My chronic medical conditions have deteriorated as a result of not being given my \nspecial medical diet. \n25.  The prison closed and locked the law library indefinitely, and has suspended the \nadministrative remedy process indefinitely.  The staff has stated that they are short-handed to \nreview, investigate and respond to every grievance under the state of emergency the facility is \noperating in.  This resulted in me being unable to access administrative remedy and \ncompassionate release procedures. \n26.  Legal mail is being delayed and at times not picked up due to staff shortages.  \nAccording to the local post office this has been an ongoing issue with several bins being left \nbehind by prison staff.  I know this because we have a prisoner in my unit who gets mail from \nEngland, and he hasn’t been getting his magazines for the last month and a half.  His family \ncalled the local postmaster in Danbury, and the postmaster informed his family that this has been \nan ongoing problem with Danbury for 37 years but that it has gotten worse in the last month and \na half.  The postmaster informed his family that prison staff leave behind a couple of bins, say \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-4   Filed 06/16/20   Page 8 of 12\nthey’re going to come back, and never come back, so they’re always a couple days behind on the \nbins. \n27.  Legal calls are being denied for open and pending cases that require access to \nattorneys.  I filed a written request to call my attorney and was told that a compassionate release \nmotion is not a legal matter that is recognized.  The case manager informed me that in her view \nthe matter did not meet the criteria she was told by the unit manger to be considered a legal \nmatter.  Legal requests from attorneys are going unanswered because, per the staff, they “don't \nhave time to handle these nonsense calls with all they are dealing with all the futile \ncompassionate release requests.” \n28.  Until approximately March 29, our unit took rec with the rest of the prison, and \nwe had access to both an indoor rec area and the outside rec yard.  After around April 6, we were \nno longer allowed to use the indoor rec area.  Instead, we used the outside rec yard with two \nother units, E Unit and F Unit.  That lasted for about a week.  For the last two weeks, our unit has \ngone to the outside rec yard by ourselves.   When we go out to the rec yard, prisoners move out \nat the same time, standing next to each other, through the same 4’ wide door.  During rec, \nprisoners stand right next to each other.  There is no social distancing. \n29.  We are experiencing serious staff shortages and they keep getting worse and \nworse.  There are way fewer COs than normal.  95% of the time, there is no officer in the unit.  \nSometimes we only see staff on the unit during count.  You see the same guys working 80-100 \nhour weeks.  I estimate that there are only about 40 COs on the entire compound.  The COs are \nbeing “augmented,” meaning that a random staff member from medical, education, etc. has to \ncover units when COs are short-handed.     \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-4   Filed 06/16/20   Page 9 of 12\n30.  If there is a medical emergency, and we cannot find a CO, the prisoners respond \nand help the prisoner.  When prisoners collapse, it is the other prisoners who carry the prisoner to \nhis bed.  In order to get a CO, we have to yell out the window hoping that somebody hears us.  \nI have witnessed at least three prisoner medical emergencies that were addressed only by other \nprisoners.   \n31.  Social distancing is impossible in here.  All 66 prisoners in my unit sleep in the \nsame room in bunk beds.  When I am sleeping, I am within one foot of the prisoner sleeping \nabove me, and only about three or four feet away from the four prisoners in the two bunks on \neither side of me.  There are no barriers between the beds. \n32.  In my unit there are five toilets, one urinal, three showers, and six sinks, including \nfive cold-water wash sinks and one hot-water slop sink for washing eating utensils.  The slop \nsink is right next to the other sinks.  The sinks are about four inches apart.  Sometimes two \npeople have to share the same sink.  The showers are two feet across the hall from the toilets.  \nThe tiles in the showers are corroded and filthy with mold.  There are holes in the rotted woods \nin the ceiling above the showers, exposing rusted pipes, and when the prisoners above us in Unit \nC use their showers, water leaks down on us. \n33.  There is one liquid soap dispenser that was just put up last week.  When we run \nout of liquid soap, we have to wait a day or two for it to get refilled.  There are no paper towels \nor hand towels.  We use toilet paper to dry our hands.  There is no communal bar soap in the \nbathroom.  You have to buy your own bar of soap from commissary.  Indigent prisoners do \nwhatever they have to do to get themselves a bar of soap.  The prison does not give out shampoo, \ntoothpaste, or mouthwash to indigent prisoners, either.  We are also not provided with any \ncleaning supplies. \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-4   Filed 06/16/20   Page 10 of 12\n34.  There are two television rooms in the unit.  Each room is about 10’ by 12’ with \ntwo televisions.  The rooms can hold about 20 people and there are typically about 15-20 people \nin each of them.  There is no ventilation in the television rooms. \n35.  There is a small telephone room, approximately 3’ by 8’, containing two \ntelephones.  The telephones are about eight inches apart.  Both telephones are almost always in \nuse.  When two prisoners are using the telephones, they have to stand within two feet of each \nother.  Typically, there are two prisoners on the phones, and the rest wait in a line in the hallway, \nstanding right next to each other, close enough to touch each other.  Since they started giving us \nfree calls two weeks ago, there is always a line to use the telephones.  The telephones are not \ncleaned between use.  \n36.  There is also a small computer room, approximately 8’ by 10’, containing three \ncomputers, an eating table, and an ice dispenser.  The amount of mold that is built up in the ice \ndispenser is incredible.  The computers are in constant use.  There are no barriers between the \ncomputers.  At any given time, there will be three people in the room using the computers, three \npeople standing behind them in the room waiting to use the computers, and several more people \nlining up shoulder-to-shoulder outside the room, right next to each other.  The computers are not \ncleaned between use. \n37.  The commissary is open, but they are out of 50% of the items and a lot of the \nitems are past their due date.  They bring the commissary into a hallway in a laundry bin, and \nthen the entire unit stands in the hallway and we wait for our names to be called.  The hallway is \nnarrow and no more than 20 feet long.  We stand right on top of each other.  If you miss your \nname then you have to wait until the end of commissary, so everyone comes out into the hallway \nat the same time. \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-4   Filed 06/16/20   Page 11 of 12\n38.  Staff give out medication twice a day.  They shout “medication” and stand outside \nthe door.  Prisoners form a pill line, standing right next to each other.  If you don’t hear \n“medication” you don’t get your medication for the day, so everyone comes up at the same time \nand crowds each other. \n39.  On April 9, staff gave the prisoners in my unit one mask each.  A week later, they \ngave us a second mask.  We haven’t received a mask in the last week.  These masks are thin, \npapery disposable hospital masks that you cannot clean.  They fall apart if you wet them.  There \nis one prisoner with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a beard who does not \nwear a mask.  He is not being made to wear a mask. \n40.  Staff have not provided us with gloves.  Staff do not wear gloves regularly.   \n41.  Staff wear masks in our unit.  But we see them take them off when they leave the \nunit and put them back on when they come back into the unit.  Staff will go into the A Unit or K \nUnit, the two units with people who are positive with the virus, and come back into our unit \nwithout changing their gloves, or they’ll take off their gloves outside the unit but won’t wash \ntheir hands and won’t change their masks. The entrances to A Unit and K unit are both on the \nfirst floor, so my whole unit can see staff going in and out of those units. \n42.  On March 13, I submitted a request to the Warden through Unit Manager Moore \nfor compassionate release.  Around March 20, I learned that that she had tested positive for \nCOVID-19.  She is still not back in the facility. On April 1, I asked for an administrative remedy \nand was told that the administrative remedy process was suspended.  On April 24, I received a \ndenial of my compassionate release request from the warden. \n43.  I have a secure and stable home environment that I can go to immediately if I am \nreleased.  I would be confined to my family residence of the last 16 years in Brooklyn, New \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-4   Filed 06/16/20   Page 12 of 12\nYork with my brother, Donald Cassidy.

I am currently in custody at Danbury FCI in the low security satellite prison (“FSL”). My \nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) Register Number is 30233-068. \n \n2.  I have been incarcerated in the BOP for almost 12 years. My release date is set for May \n18, 2022. \n \n3.  I am 51 years old. I have been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease and post-\ntraumatic stress disorder. \n \n4.  In early April, I began experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19. My symptoms \nincluded a severe headache, body aches, fever, shortness of breath, and a terrible cough. I \nalso lost my appetite and my sense of smell. The cough was the worst cough I have ever \nhad. At one point, I coughed so hard that I was afraid I had fractured a rib.  \n \n5.  I spoke to the medical department multiple times about my symptoms. When I coughed \nso hard that I feared I had fractured a rib, I submitted a request for an x-ray. In response, I \nwas called to medical, but I was not given an x-ray. Medical told me that my vitals were \ngood and that I was “healthy,” and that I probably just pulled a muscle rather than \nfractured a rib. I was given no treatment. I bought Tylenol from the commissary for my \npain. \n \n6.  My symptoms lasted for approximately three weeks. Upon hearing how hard I was \ncoughing, one of the psychologists commented that I should be tested because I could be \ninfecting other people. I responded, “Could you please make that happen?”  \n \n7.  I was never offered a test for COVID-19.  \n \n8.  I was also never quarantined in response to my symptoms. Instead, I was kept in general \npopulation.  \n \n9.  At the FSL, all of us live in one dormitory-style room, which is like a big “warehouse,” \nwith about 160 to 170 inmates total. The dormitory is divided up into cubicles with two \nbunkbeds in each. The dormitory also contains our common area with televisions, hair \ncare, laundry, phones, and computers, as well as our bathrooms and showers.  \n \n10. There are currently three people, including me, living in my cubicle. Many of the \ncubicles have four people. My cubicle is approximately 10 feet by 10 feet. Within the \ncubicle, the two bunkbeds are approximately 6 feet apart. Most of the cubicles are \nseparated by a partition about an inch thick; however, some of the partitions do not reach \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-5   Filed 06/16/20   Page 3 of 4\nall the way up to the top bunk, so in some cases, two people on top bunks in separate \ncubicles are sleeping right next to one another. \n \n11. In the common area, there are 12 phones, but not all of them are working. There are 6 \ncomputers, but only 4 of them are working. These are shared among the 160 to 170 \nwomen who live here. The phones and computers are not being cleaned in between each \nuse; rather, they are being cleaned at most three times per day, and sometimes less \nfrequently. \n \n12. There are 24 showers for all of us, but not all of them are working. The showers are \ncleaned once per day. \n \n13. FSL has canceled all classes and programming, as well as indoor recreation, and we are \nbeing called to meals in waves. However, this has not made much of a difference in our \ndaily contact with one another, because we are still living side by side in the crowded \ndormitories, and standing side by side in line for meals. We share countless items that we \nall touch many times per day, including, for example, the phones, computers, laundry, ice \nmachine, door handles, and a hot water spigot that we use to make coffee and food. \n \n14. Staff members here have been taking the inmates’ temperature every day. They go down \nour rows of cubicles to do this, but on quite a few occasions, I have noticed that everyone \nin the same row is told that they have the exact same temperature. Sometimes, I and other \nwomen have not gotten out of bed to have our temperature taken, and no one seems to \nnotice or care. \n \n15. Before April 24, 2020, I was aware of only four women in the FSL who had been tested \nfor COVID-19, at least two of whom tested positive. But many more people were sick. I \nhave personally observed many other prisoners with symptoms similar to mine. Many \nstaff members have been absent. Although a few women were placed into quarantine, the \nmajority of women with symptoms were not. \n \n16. On April 24, 2020, a woman in the FSL became extremely sick. She was vomiting and \nstruggling for air. Other inmates were around her, trying to help her, without wearing any \ngloves or masks. She was sick for hours, and throughout the night. We did not understand \nwhy staff did not take her to the hospital. In response to concern among the inmates, a \ncorrectional officer (a lieutenant) came into the dormitory and announced that anyone \nwho used the phone to contact people on the outside about this incident would get a \ndisciplinary violation. He said that he would be listening to our phone calls, and that we \nneeded to “stay in our lane,” because we “are not doctors.” The woman who was sick was \neventually taken to the hospital on April 25.  \n \n17. On April 25, many of the women who had been in contact with the woman who was \ntaken to the hospital were tested for COVID-19. At least ten of them have tested positive, \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-5   Filed 06/16/20   Page 4 of 4\nand all of them have been quarantined. That night, the women who were being placed in \nquarantine were allowed to come into the dormitory to get their personal belongings and \ntake showers.  \n \n18. As of April 26, 2020, I still have a cough and a headache. I am terrified for my health and \nsafety. \n \n19. I declare under the penalty of perjury that the contents of this declaration are true and \ncorrect to the best of my knowledge. I will sign a hard copy of this declaration at my \nearliest opportunity. \n \n/s/ Christina Korbe \n \nApril 26, 2020 \n \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-6   Filed 06/16/20   Page 1 of 4\nEXHIBIT \nF\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-6   Filed 06/16/20   Page 2 of 4\nDeclaration of Marius (Marie) Mason \n \n1.  I am currently in custody at Danbury FCI in the low security satellite prison (“FSL”). My \nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) Register Number is 04672-061. \n \n2.  I am 58 years old.  \n \n3.  I am serving a sentence of 21 years and 10 months for conspiracy and arson. My release \ndate is set for May 4, 2027. \n \n4.  On Tuesday I submitted a request to the Warden for compassionate release. I also asked \nto be considered for home confinement. I was approached by a staff member and \ninformed that if I persisted in my request for compassionate release I might be moved to a \nmedical facility. This would seem to me to confirm that I am in fact a candidate for \ncompassionate release.  \n \n5.  I have a history of breast and uterine cancer, as well as an enlarged heart, hypertension, \nand borderline diabetes.  \n \n6.  At FSL it is not possible for me to maintain distance from other prisoners. I am housed in \na large dormitory style room with approximately 168 other women.  \n \n7.  The dormitory in which I am housed is divided into cubicles. Each cubicle holds two \nbunk beds, with up to four prisoners per cubicle. Each bunk bed is about two to four feet \nfrom the bed in the same cubicle. Each bed is about two to four inches from the bunk bed \non the other side of the cubicle wall. The cubicle wall does not reach the top of the bunk \nbeds, so a prisoner on the top bunk is right next to the prisoner on the top bunk on the \nother side of the cubicle wall. \n \n8.  All of the prisoners at FSL must share 6 or 7 working phones and 4 working computers. \nThey are not cleaned between uses. The phones and computers are located close together \nin a common area. \n \n9.  Prisoners in my housing unit eat meals together in the unit. About 10-20 people are \nseated at each table. Five tables are filled at a time for meals.  \n \n10. All of the prisoners in the FSL use three bathrooms, which each include 5 toilets, 5 sinks, \nand 4 showers.  \n \n11. There are frequently issues with the water in the FSL, and water will be shut off for a few \nhours or more than a day at a time. In early April, the water was shut off for about \nseventeen hours. During this time no one was able to wash their hands or flush the toilet. \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-6   Filed 06/16/20   Page 3 of 4\n12. Prisoners are not given hand sanitizer. \n \n13. Prisoners were given paper masks a few weeks ago. Before then we were not given \nmasks. In mid-April, we were given fabric masks. \n \n14. Staff began wearing masks and gloves around mid-April. Before that time they weren’t \nwearing protective equipment.   \n \n15. Some staff have been out sick. More than one correctional officer tested positive for \nCOVID-19, was out of work for a week, and then came back to work. One of our cooks \nis still out. Officers have returned to work after being unable to get their FMLA papers \nsigned, but remain symptomatic. One officer stated that they still feel ill and do not want \nto be at work, but were told to return. \n \n16. On March 30, 2020, inmates in FSL found out about the first COVID-19 case in our \nfacility because it was reported on the news. A women from our facility was taken to the \nhospital and tested positive.  \n \n17. In total, I am aware of three people from FSL who have tested positive for COVID-19. \nOne of those individuals couldn’t breathe and passed out. One had asthma. One had a \npersistent fever that wouldn’t go down. They were all taken to the hospital, where they \nwere tested and found to be positive. \n \n18. Those inmates that tested positive for COVID-19 have returned to the facility. One was \naway from the unit for about two weeks, and others were out for only about 7 days. \n \n19. Inmates who are coughing, congested, or short of breath are not being tested for COVID-\n19. They are not being separated from other inmates. I am not aware of any prisoner in \nthe FSL being tested for COVID-19 except those who were tested at the hospital.  \n \n20. Staff are checking temperatures but inmates who have had high temperatures have not \nbeing separated from the rest of the population. Recently, however, nobody has had a \nnormal temperature, because they take our temperatures with a remote scanner, a plastic \nwand with a digital readout. It does not touch on our body and people’s temperatures read \nartificially low: as low as 96, but often around 97. \n \n21. Previously, they used an oral mercury thermometer. When a person’s temperature was \nelevated, staff would retake the temperature several times. A number of people had \nhighly elevated temperatures, ranging from 103 and above. Staff told those individuals to \ndrink cold water and then immediately retook their temperatures, at which point the \ntemperature would appear to have dropped, although it was still above normal. Nothing \nwas done after that as a result of the temperatures. Our temperatures were not and are not \nbeing recorded.  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-6   Filed 06/16/20   Page 4 of 4\n \n22. While we are supposed to report symptoms, we are all aware that if we complain of \nsymptoms we are unlikely to get effective treatment, and that we may be isolated away \nfrom our friends and our belongings, in cells that do not have ready bathroom access. \nNeither prisoners nor staff have any clear guidance on what to do to protect ourselves or \nwhat should be done if we are ill. \n \n23. I have reviewed the information contained in this declaration by telephone with my \nlawyer, Moira Meltzer-Cohen.

I am currently in custody at Danbury FCI in the low security satellite prison (“FSL”). My \nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) Register Number is 11764-082. \n \n2.  I am serving a sentence of 85 months for conspiracy to distribute cocaine. My release \ndate is set for November 1, 2021. \n \n3.  I am 61 years old. I have chronic asthma, which requires the use of two prescribed \ninhalers. \n \n4.  At FSL I am housed in a dormitory style room at with about 150 other prisoners. The \nroom is divided into cubicles with two bunkbeds each. I am in a cubicle with three other \nprisoners. Our beds are at most four and a half feet apart, and the top bunks are closer \ntogether, at most two feet, to the top bunks on the other side of the cubicle wall. \n \n5.  On March 27th I was hospitalized with COVID-19. I had been feeling sick for a couple \nweeks before I went to the hospital. I had put in a request to see medical, and had been \ngiven two different “idles” to miss programs because I was sick. \n \n6.  On March 26th I reported to staff that I wasn’t feeling well, and asked to be excused from \nparticipating in programs that day. I went to the medical clinic, but after waiting there for \n45 minutes without being seen, I returned to my bunk. A few hours later, I reported to \nstaff on duty that I was feeling worse. I was told to lie back down.  \n \n7.  By early in the morning of March 27th, around 1 or 2am, I had such bad chest pain that I \ncould not sleep. I told the officer on duty, who called command center, and then called an \nambulance. \n \n8.  Upon arrival at the hospital, my temperature was taken and registered at 102 degrees. My \ntemperature had been taken at the facility within an hour earlier. I was told it had \nregistered 97.  \n \n9.  At the hospital I was tested for COVID-19 and tested positive. I believe I was released \nfrom the hospital on April 1st. It was a Wednesday. I was told that I would have to test \nnegative twice before they would release me. I was tested most recently the Tuesday \nbefore I was released from the hospital. I got the results on Wednesday: I was positive for \nCOVID-19. I was released that afternoon. \n \n10. FSL has two isolation rooms. After I returned from the hospital, I was placed in one of \nthe isolation rooms. Another prisoner who I was told had tested positive for COVID-19 \nwas in the other isolation room. I remained in that room for 24 hours.  \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-7   Filed 06/16/20   Page 3 of 3\n11. The isolation room was cold and small, with just enough room for my bed and a toilet. \nThe bed had a one-inch thick mattress and no pillow. The toilet’s flush was controlled by \nthe corrections officer from outside the room and was only flushed a few times a day.  \n \n12. After 24 hours, I was placed in the facility’s visiting room for five days. There were four \nof us in the visiting room. While we were there, we used the visiting room bathrooms. \nEach woman had her own toilet stall, but we shared the same shower, a temporary stand-\nup stall built in order for us to be able to bathe.  \n \n13. At one point when we were in the visiting room, one of the other women fell when she \nwas in the bathroom and hit her head on the concrete floor. She was unconscious, and we \ntried to get help for her. There was no guard outside the door. We tried to yell for help, \nbut nobody came. We went to the locked front door and started beating on the door and \nyelling to try to get someone’s attention. Someone who was in the parking lot heard us \nand told control. A Commander came into the visiting room and we told him what had \nhappened and that the woman who fell needed medical attention.   \n \n14. I returned to the general population housing unit on April 7.  \n \n15. I have continued to feel unwell since I returned to the unit. On April 17th I felt weak, had \na fever and terrible body pains, and was sweating and dry heaving. That weekend I \ncontinued to feel terribly sick. I had a stomach ache that lasted at least 8 hours, horrible \nbody aches, and my eyes burned. I was scared. I notified correctional officers, and I was \ntaken to the medical clinic. My temperature was taken and registered 98 degrees, but I \nbelieve this was incorrect. My oxygenation was 96 and my blood pressure was so high \nthat the nurse took it three times. The nurse instructed me to take Tylenol and return to \nmy room. \n \n16. Another prisoner in the unit was very sick and was taken to the hospital last night. She \ncouldn’t stop dry heaving for three or four hours before she was sent to the hospital. \n \n17. Today maybe 40 people were taken from the unit into the Rec room. I was told they were \nbeing tested for COVID-19. Some people who had been in contact with the prisoner who \nwent to the hospital were still in the unit and not among the people in the Rec room. \n \n18.

In early April I submitted a request to the Warden for compassionate release, and I \nsubmitted through my Federal Public Defender a request for home confinement.  \n \n6.  At FSL it is not possible for me to social distance. I can try to keep to myself, but I am \nhoused in a dorm style unit with 198 beds. The unit is divided into cubes like office \ncubicles with four people to a cube. The walls of the cubicles are about 4-5 feet high and \ndo not reach the ceiling. The beds are not six feet apart. \n \n7.  Our unit has 3 bathrooms for all of the prisoners in our dormitory. Each bathroom has 6-8 \ntoilet stalls and 6-8 showers. Not all of the showers are functional.  \n \n8.  Meals are brought to all the prisoners in the unit at the same time; meal times are not \nstaggered. They are brought on Styrofoam trays. There are not enough places for \neveryone to sit to eat.   \n \n9.  The counselor’s office has hand sanitizer that I can use when I make a legal call. Hand \nsanitizer is not available in the units.  \n \n10. The prisoners have one fabric washable mask each. There are washing machines \navailable to us to clean the masks. We do not have another mask to wear while our mask \nis being cleaned.  \n \n11. A woman in my unit was removed for fever. She reported that she tested positive for \nCOVID-19 on a Tuesday. She was returned to our unit that same Friday. She sleeps in a \ncubicle that touches mine on the top bunk. I sleep on the bottom bunk. After she returned \nfrom the hospital, I slept with my head away from the wall to try to protect myself. \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-9   Filed 06/16/20   Page 3 of 3\n12.

I am currently in custody at Danbury FCI in the minimum-security women’s satellite \ncamp (“Camp”).  My Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) Register Number is 26224-014. \n \n2.  I am 58 years old and African American. I am 5 feet 7 inches tall and I weigh \napproximately 240 pounds.  \n \n3.  I have a medical history of hypertension, for which I am currently taking \nHydrochlorothiazide and Aspirin.   \n \n4.  I am serving a sentence of imprisonment of a year and a day for tax evasion—my first \nand only criminal conviction—and the BOP calculates my release date to be January 4, \n2021, but I have been advised that I may be eligible for release to home confinement on \nNovember 30, 2020.    \n \n5.  I self-surrendered to FCI Danbury on February 28, 2020. \n \n6.  On April 17, 2020, I submitted a request by U.S. Mail to Warden Easter for \ncompassionate release, or, in the alternative, immediate transfer to home confinement.  \nAs of today, I have not received a response.  \n \n7.  At the Camp, it is not possible for me to maintain physical distance from other women. I \ncan try to keep to myself, but I am housed in a dorm style unit with about 47 other \nwomen.  We sleep in a common space that is divided into open cubicles, each with a \nbunk bed that sleeps two women. The walls of the cubicles are about 4-5 feet high and do \nnot reach the ceiling. The bunk beds are close enough that if I reached out my hand, I \ncould touch the hand of the person in the bed next to me. \n \n8.  Camp prisoners are responsible for cleaning our own cubicles.  Our shared living spaces \nin our dorm are not regularly disinfected.   \n \n9.  Our unit has 5 toilets, 6 sinks and 6 showers that are currently shared by approximately \n48 women.  Our common toilets, sinks, and showers are not regularly cleaned or \ndisinfected.     \n \n10. There are four dorms at Camp: A, B, C, and D.  I am in Dorm B.  Currently, I believe that \nthe A, B and C dorms each house approximately 47-50 people.  I believe that the D dorm \nhouses 12 people.   \n \n11. Staff move throughout the day between all four of the dorms, including for count, food \ndelivery, and commissary.  Staff also rotate between the men’s prison, the FSL, and \nCamp, interacting with prisoners at each location.   \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-10   Filed 06/16/20   Page 3 of 4\n \n12. Among other duties, staff serve us our meals in our cubicles three times per day.   \n \n13. Several staff members that typically have shifts at the Camp have been out sick.  Two \nstaff members in particular have been out for several weeks, and their offices, which are \nusually cleaned by inmates, have been thoroughly disinfected, floors mopped, and \nfurniture cleaned—I haven’t seen this type of cleaning before, and it goes far beyond the \nsanitation and cleaning practices throughout the rest of the Camp facility.   \n \n14. Cleaning throughout the rest of the Camp has been sporadic lately, as some prisoners \nhave quit their jobs and some are quarantined in different dorms from their assigned \ncleaning areas.  We do not have adequate cleaning supplies.  I am not aware of any part \nof the Camp being sanitized or disinfected other than the two staff offices.    \n \n15. The Camp contains one common area with telephones, computers, and “video-visiting” \nmachines.  These items are shared by women housed in all four dorms; for the entire \nCamp, there are a total of 4 phones, 7 computers, and 3 video machines currently \noperational.  The common area also includes hot water taps and sinks for dishwashing.  \nThe phones, computers, and video machines are clustered close together in the shared \ncommon space.  They are not cleaned or disinfected between uses.  There is cleaning \nsolution available in the phone area, but not in the computer room.  When we have access \nto the common area to make phone calls or use the computers, we often have to wait in \nline because they are in high demand.  While we wait, we are not able to social distance \nfrom each other. \n \n16. Prisoners have been given 2 surgical masks and 3 material masks in the last two weeks.  \nWe have not been given gloves. \n \n17. Since April 15, the Camp has been on lockdown.  Under this lockdown, the women in \neach dorm are let out of the dorm for one hour a day at different times of day.  This is our \nonly time for recreation and access to the common area.  During the time we are confined \nto our dorm, we are instructed to remain in our cubicles.  Since the walls between the \ncubicles are only 4 to 5 feet tall, we are still able to speak to other prisoners in our dorm \nover the wall.  \n \n18. There are a limited number of prisoners doing jobs, and those prisoners continue to move \naround the facility and between the dorms.  Three times a week, my entire unit (all 48 of \nus) will move through the facility to the laundry room and deliver our laundry to \nprisoners who will do the laundry.  We wait in line to drop it off, and we are not able to \nsocial distance while we wait in line. \n \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-10   Filed 06/16/20   Page 4 of 4\n19. On April 16, the Assistant Warden visited the Camp and was asked if we would be \ninformed if we were exposed to COVID-19.  She said that we would not be told if we \nwere exposed.   \n \n20. Every day, the lieutenant comes by and takes our temperature using a sensor \nthermometer, but since staff tries to get it as close to our heads as possible, it sometimes \ntouches our head.  The same thermometer is used for each inmate, and I do not see it \nbeing disinfected between uses.  There is no screening for other symptoms such as \ncoughing.   \n \n21. Although some women at the Camp have been told that they are on a “list” for home \nconfinement, these women have not been released.  I only know of two releases resulting \nfrom COVID-19 from Camp: a pregnant woman and a woman with Parkinson’s disease.  \n \n22. I have not been told that I am on the list for home confinement.   \n \n23. I declare under the penalty of perjury that the contents of this declaration are true and \ncorrect to the best of my knowledge. I will sign a hard copy of this declaration at my \nearliest opportunity. \n \n \n___/s/___________________________ \nTheresa Foreman \nApril 26, 2020 \n \n  3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-11   Filed 06/16/20   Page 1 of 3\nEXHIBIT \nK\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-11   Filed 06/16/20   Page 2 of 3\nDeclaration of Antrum Coston \nI, Antrum Coston, am over the age of 18 and fully competent to make the following \ndeclaration: \n1.  I was incarcerated at FCI Danbury from April 2019 until April 17, 2020, when the \nCourt granted my motion to reduce my sentence.  I served a little more than two years for federal \ndrug and gun convictions.  My BOP Register Number was 15278-014. \n2.  I was housed in H Unit, a congested, second-floor dorm-style unit which houses \nabout 75 prisoners. \n3.  All prisoners in H Unit sleep in bunk-beds in the same room.  The bunk-beds are \nin rows, both side-by-side and front-to-back.  Side-by-side, there is a distance of approximately \n3’ between beds.  I could stretch out my arms and touch the bunk next to me.  Front-to-back, \nthere is a distance of approximately 6’ between beds. \n4.  All 75 men in the unit share the same bathroom, which has one urinal, four or five \ntoilets, five or six sinks, and a shower area with four showers.  The unit also has two television \nrooms, a computer room with three computers, and a telephone room with two telephones.  \nThe television rooms can accommodate approximately 20 prisoners and it is not unusual for 15 \nor more prisoners to be in the same television room at the same time.  The two phones in the \ntelephone room are next to each other and if two prisoners are using the phones they have to \nstand right next to each other. \n5.  Most units in FCI Danbury are dorm-style.  There are three cell units.  One of the \ncell units is for the drug program, one is for mainly ex-military prisoners, and one (A Unit) was \nrecently emptied and converted into a quarantine unit.  Each cell has a bunk-bed for two \nprisoners, a sink and a toilet. \n6.  In February, many prisoners in my unit got very sick.  Staff explained the \noutbreak as chicken pox, pneumonia, or shingles.  The prison temporarily closed the gym in \nresponse to the outbreak.  The gym was reopened in March.  When the gym reopened, it was \npacked because prisoners had gone so long without working out. \n7.  In the beginning of March, prison staff took away prisoners’ spray bottles, which \nuntil then had been allowed.  We were told that we could get spray bottles from a CO, but the \nCO was never on the block.  In early April, we got our spray bottles back. \n8.  In mid-March, the prison cancelled all visits and split the jail in half.  Although \nbefore then the entire prison would have rec at the same time, after mid-March half the prison \nwould have rec at one time, and the other half would have rec at a different time.  \n9.  Before mid-March the entire prison would eat around the same time, on staggered \nshifts.  There would be about four units in the chow hall at any given time.  After mid-March, \nonly one unit would go to the chow hall at a time. \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-11   Filed 06/16/20   Page 3 of 3\n10.  In early April, the prison closed the gym and the law library and my unit was \nlocked down.  It was still locked down when I was released.  My unit was allowed out of the \ndorm for one hour per day for rec.  Some time after that, my unit started going to rec by itself, \nwith no other units.  People did not observe social distancing in the rec yard.  \n11.  In early April, prison staff started allowing prisoners to wear mask.  They did this \nbecause we were making our own masks.  In the two weeks before I was released, the prison \nstaff started providing prisoners with masks. \n12.  In mid-April, my unit stopped going to the chow hall entirely.  All meals were \nbrought to the unit.  The prison switched from hot meals to bagged meals. \n13.  On approximately April 13, the prison started mandatory temperature-taking for \nprisoners.  Before then, prison staff would come through the dorm and asked if anyone wanted to \nget their temperature checked.  Having a high temperature would not necessarily result in any \nfurther action being taken.  There were prisoners with 103-degree temperatures who were not \ntaken out of the unit.  Generally, if prisoners in the unit get sick, they just get sick.  A couple \nextremely sick prisoners were taken out of the unit and transferred to A Unit.  But you had to be \nfalling down to get any help. \n14.  Medical has been no help.  Before the crisis, prisoners could go to sick call in the \nmorning, fill out a slip, and, depending on the severity of their condition, could expect to see a \ndoctor a day or two later.  For the last month, prisoners have been filling out slips but have not \nbeen hearing back from medical or getting appointments.   I put in a slip approximately one \nmonth before I was released, and never heard back from medical. \n15.  The prison put up a few signs reminding people to wash their hands.  They did not \ncreate any hand-washing stations or provide any prisoners with hand sanitizer or soap.  There is \nno hand sanitizer available in the commissary.  They used to have it, but they weren’t selling it to \nus for the last two months. \n16.  When I was released on April 17, there was no social distancing at the prison.  \nPrisoners frequently stood directly next to each other when waiting in crowded, congested lines, \nincluding to receive medications, to use the commissary, and to get meals.  At this time, some \nguards wore masks and some guards did not. \n \nI declare under the penalty of perjury that the contents of this declaration are true and correct to \nthe best of my knowledge. \n/s/ Antrum Coston (by consent) \nAntrum Coston \nApril 26, 2020 \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-12   Filed 06/16/20   Page 1 of 2\nEXHIBIT \nL\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 111-12   Filed 06/16/20   Page 2 of 2\nDeclaration of Shannon Benson \n \n1.

I suffer from Graves’ disease and Hashimoto's disease.  \n \n3.  I am in G Unit at FCI Danbury. The unit is full of bunk beds. Each bed is about 3 feet \naway from the next bed. All the men in the unit share a bathroom that has one urinal and \n5 individual stalls. We all share 2 phones and 3 computers.  \n \n4.  Last week, a man passed away from COVID-19 who had been housed in my unit. \n \n5.  People with symptoms including coughing, chest restriction, headaches, and loss of taste \nand smell are not being taken up to medical or tested for the virus. You have to have a \nhigh temperature to be seen by medical. There are people in my unit right now who have \nserious symptoms and haven’t been seen by medical or removed from the unit. \n \n6.  I experienced loss of taste and smell, and had profuse cold sweats. I had headaches for 4 \nto 5 days. I was not tested for the virus. I was told that if you didn’t have an elevated \ntemperature then it may have been a common cold or flu I was experiencing. \n \n7.  Around March 13, 2020, I was scheduled to go to a specialist due to my T4 levels being \nelevated to the point of danger. Due to COVID-19, I was unable to be seen by the \nspecialist. I did not receive any blood work here at the institution until April 24 to see if \nin fact my thyroid condition had leveled out. I am concerned my medication is not \nperforming correctly because of my elevated levels.  \n \n8.  They didn’t start passing out masks or install a soap dispenser until about 2 weeks ago.  \nWe only recently got regular access to cleaning supplies. Our shower area is heavily \ncoated with fungus and mildew, there are several significant leaks. FCI Danbury has had \na history of asbestos.  \n \n9.

On March 27, 2020, I pushed my way to \nmedical and demanded to be seen.   \n \n6.  When I was seen at medical, they had just received 22 COVID-19 tests and I was \nimmediately given one.   \n \n7.  I was then locked up in an observation cell. There were long periods of time that no one \ncame to see me. I even missed meals.  \n \n8.  I was later moved to a celled unit. For a period of 6 days, I was not given a shower or my \nmedications. I was also not allowed to communicate with my family during that period of \ntime.  \n \n9.  After 12 days of isolation, I was released from quarantine back to the M Unit. When I \nreturned to my unit, many men were ill.   \n \n10.

EASTER & MICHAEL CARVAJAL, \n  \nDefendants. \n \nRULING ON MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND MOTION \nTO DISMISS \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nOn March 27, 2020, Congress gave federal prison officials an extraordinary tool to \nconfront the extraordinary threat posed by the novel coronavirus within prison walls: the \nauthority to transfer any federal inmate from prison to confinement in his or her home.  A week \nlater, the Attorney General of the United States urged the Director of the Bureau of Prisons \n(“BOP”) to “maximize” the use of that tool as soon as possible, stating in an April 3 \nmemorandum that “[g]iven the speed with which this disease has spread through the general \npublic,” and the Bureau’s “profound obligation to protect the health and safety of all inmates,” \n“it is clear that time is of the essence.”  ECF No. 24-2 at 48-49.  The Attorney General’s memo \nwas triggered by an outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, at the \nDanbury Federal Correctional Institution (“FCI Danbury”), a low security prison in Danbury, \nConnecticut, and two other federal prisons; the memo directed the BOP to “immediately review \nall inmates who have COVID-19 risk factors” for  potential placement in home confinement, \n“starting with inmates incarcerated at … FCI Danbury” and the other two facilities.    Id. at 49.  \nThis case – brought by four inmates at FCI Danbury – involves an apparent failure of the \nWarden and staff at FCI Danbury to take these exhortations seriously.  The four inmates, all of \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 2 of 74\nwhom have COVID-19 risk factors, have made a preliminary showing that officials at FCI \nDanbury are making only limited use of their home confinement authority, as well as other tools \nat their disposal to protect inmates during the outbreak, and that these failures amount to \ndeliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to inmates in violation of the Eighth \nAmendment.  Accordingly, I grant in part the inmates’ motion for a temporary restraining order \nand issue an order that requires the Warden at FCI Danbury to adopt a process for evaluating \ninmates with COVID-19 risk factors for home confinement and other forms of release that is \nboth far more accelerated and more clearly focused on the critical issues of inmate and public \nsafety than the current process.  Factual disputes as to other issues the inmates raise preclude me \nfrom granting further relief at this time, but I also order an expedited period of discovery and \nschedule a hearing for June 11, 2020, to adjudicate the inmates’ motion for preliminary \ninjunction. \nII.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nOn April 27, the inmates (the “Petitioners”) filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2241 against the Warden of FCI Danbury and the Director of the Bureau of \nPrisons (the “Respondents”).  They sought to represent a class consisting of all inmates in the \nmen’s prison and the two women’s prisons making up FCI Danbury, as well as a “medically \nvulnerable” subclass consisting of those inmates with COVID-19 risk factors.  They alleged that \n“[t]he only effective way to minimize the potential devastation from COVID-19 in BOP facilities \ngenerally and FCI Danbury in particular is to downsize immediately the incarcerated population \nand, for the prisoners who remain at the institution, to undertake aggressively the detection, \nprevention, and treatment measures that public health and medical experts have recommended, \nincluding effective social distancing.”  ECF No. 1 at 34.  They further alleged that Respondents \nwere violating the Eighth Amendment by “fail[ing] to use the BOP’s available statutory \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 3 of 74\nauthority to reduce the population of FCI Danbury to mitigate the severe risk posed by COVID-\n19,” ECF No. 1 at 41, and by failing to take adequate safety measures—including distancing, \nhygiene, testing, and medical treatment—to protect inmates during the outbreak.   \nThe Petition seeks a wide range of relief, including an order “requiring Respondents to \nrelease from custody or to home confinement members of the [medically vulnerable] Subclass \nand requiring Respondents to provide medically adequate social distancing and health care and \nsanitation for members of the Class who remain.”  ECF No. 1 at 66. \nOn April 30, the Petitioners filed an “emergency motion for temporary restraining order \nand preliminary injunction,” seeking an order requiring Respondents to “enlarge [i.e., transfer] to \nhome confinement all women currently housed in the satellite camp at FCI Danbury,” “enlarge \nto home confinement all members of the medically vulnerable Subclass,”1 and “implement \nappropriate measures to maximize social distancing and improve hygiene” for the remaining \ninmates or transfer them to safer BOP facilities.  ECF No. 14 at 1.  Together with their Petition \nand motion, Petitioners filed declarations from inmates housed at each of the three prisons within \nFCI Danbury, as well as declarations from experts and other evidence.   \nOn May 5, the Respondents filed a joint motion to dismiss the habeas petition under Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) and an opposition to the motion for temporary restraining order \nand preliminary injunction.  The Respondents argued that the Court lacked jurisdiction over the \nhabeas petition, that it failed state a claim, and that the Petitioners’ motion should be denied.  \nWith regard to jurisdiction, the Respondents argued, among other things, that the Court was \n \n1 During oral argument on the motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, Petitioners’ \ncounsel stated that, by asking for an order of “enlarge[ment],” Petitioners were not seeking the immediate, \nindiscriminate release of inmates, but instead asking for a process by which inmates would be evaluated promptly \nfor transfer to home confinement, with the urgency reflected in the Attorney General’s April 3 memo.  The order I \nissue today requires the implementation of such a process. \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 4 of 74\nprohibited from entertaining the Petitioners’ requests for “enlargement”, because doing so would \nexceed the limited authority of district courts to modify sentences once they are imposed; that the \nPrison Litigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3626, foreclosed such relief; and that the Petitioners \nhad failed to exhaust administrative remedies.  The Respondents also submitted a lengthy \ndeclaration by the Warden and defended her efforts to combat the COVID-19 crisis on the \nmerits, detailing safety measures the Warden had imposed at FCI Danbury, including enhanced \nsanitation, quarantine of inmates, isolation of groups of inmates, the provision of masks and \nother protective equipment to inmates and staff, and delivery of food and programming directly \nto the living units.  Finally, the Respondents argued that this habeas petition cannot be \nmaintained as a class action. \nI held oral argument on May 6, 2020, and now issue this ruling. \nIII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nThe factual background is taken from the Petition, the declarations submitted by \nPetitioners, and the Warden’s declaration.    \nA.  The Petitioners \nPetitioners are four inmates currently serving terms of imprisonment at FCI Danbury.  \nPetitioners suffer from medical conditions that place them at higher risk for serious illness or \ndeath from the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (“COVID-19”).  They bring this habeas \npetition on behalf of themselves and a putative class of all inmates currently in custody at FCI \nDanbury, or who will be in custody at FCI Danbury during the course of the COVID-19 \npandemic (“the Class”), as well as a subclass consisting of all such individuals who are also at \nheightened risk for serious illness or death from COVID-19 (“the Medically Vulnerable \nSubclass”).  \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 5 of 74\nPetitioner Dianthe Martinez-Brooks is a 50-year-old woman currently housed in FCI \nDanbury’s women’s minimum-security camp.

Petition ¶ 3.  She suffers from hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hepatitis C.  \nId. \nB.  The COVID-19 Pandemic \nThe COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing, once-in-a-century public health crisis to which \nno reader will need much introduction.  As of May 11, 2020, there have been a whopping 1.3 \nmillion confirmed cases and roughly 80,000 deaths from COVID-19 in the United States alone.  \nCases in the U.S., CDC.gov (last updated May 11, 2020).3  Shops, restaurants, and offices \nremain shuttered in many states, and unemployment has reached levels unseen since the Great \nDepression. \nNot all Americans, however, are equally at risk.  It is well established that the elderly and \nthose suffering from certain preexisting medical conditions are at significantly higher risk of \nserious illness or death from COVID-19.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (“CDC”), those at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19 include people who \nare 65 years and older, have chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma, have serious \nheart conditions, are immunocompromised, are severely obese, have diabetes, have chronic \nkidney disease and are undergoing dialysis, or have liver disease.4  High-risk individuals face \nsignificantly higher mortality rates should they contract COVID-19 than the general population.  \nAccording to one report, for example, the mortality rate from COVID-19 is 8.4% for individuals \nwith hypertension, 8.0% for individuals with chronic respiratory disease, 7.6% for individuals \nwith cancer, and 13.2% for individuals with cardiovascular disease.  ECF No. 1 at 9-11 (citing \n \n3 URL: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html. \n4 People Who Are at Higher Risk for Severe Illness, CDC (Apr. 15, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/ \n2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html. \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 7 of 74\nReport of WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), World Health \nOrganization (Feb. 28, 2020), at 12, https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-\nchina-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf (last visited May 7, 2020)). \nPetitioners’ medical conditions place them in this high-risk group.  And Petitioners face \nan additional risk that even most of those in the high-risk group do not:  They are incarcerated.  \nAccording to Petitioners’ expert, “[t]he risk posed by infectious diseases in jails and prisons is \nsignificantly higher than in the community, both in terms of risk of transmission, exposure, and \nharm to individuals who become infected.”  ECF No. 1-1 at 3.  And it is not difficult to imagine \nwhy.  The vast majority of the inmates at FCI Danbury live in large dormitory halls lined with \nbunk beds, each housing roughly 50 or more inmates, with shared bathrooms and common \nspaces.   This arrangement makes effective social distancing virtually impossible. \nThus, not surprisingly, numerous federal and state prisons are contending with significant \nCOVID-19 outbreaks, and FCI Danbury is no exception.  Since the pandemic began, sixty-nine \ninmates at FCI Danbury have tested positive, out of an inmate population of approximately \n1,000.  ECF No. 24-2 at 25.  But this figure may well understate the true number of COVID-19 \ncases at FCI Danbury, in light of the limited testing that has been conducted.  One inmate has \ndied since the crisis began.  In fact, FCI Danbury was one of only three federal prisons \nspecifically identified by Attorney General William Barr in an April 3, 2020 memo to the \nDirector of the Bureau Prisons ordering immediate action to place vulnerable inmates on home \nconfinement.  ECF No. 24-2 at 48.  In the memo, Attorney General Barr noted the “significant \nlevels of infection” at FCI Danbury, along with FCI Oakdale and FCI Elkton.  Id. \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 8 of 74\nC.  The Warden’s Efforts To Contain the Outbreak \nThe extent to which the Warden has implemented adequate measures to control the \nCOVID-19 outbreak at FCI Danbury and protect inmates is hotly disputed in this case.  The \nWarden’s efforts and the Petitioners’ allegations regarding their insufficiency are described in \nthe sections that follow. \n1.  Social Distancing \nAccording to the CDC, social distancing is “the best way to reduce the spread of \ncoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).”  Social Distancing, CDC (May 6, 2020), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html.  \nPracticing social distancing requires individuals to stay at least 6 feet from other people, to avoid \ngathering in large groups, and to stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.  Id.  \nThese measures are virtually impossible to observe in a prison setting, particularly at facilities \nlike FCI Danbury.  FCI Danbury consists of three facilities—a low-security men’s prison, a \nminimum-security women’s camp, and a low-security women’s satellite prison.  ECF No. 24-2 at \n4-5.   \nIn the men’s prison, there are seven units of open, dorm-style housing, two smaller rooms \nthat can house ten to twelve inmates each, and three units of individual cells.  ECF No. 24-2 at 4.  \nThus, the majority of the inmates at the men’s prison live in large, open dormitories, with shared \ncommon spaces and bathrooms.  For example, Petitioner Kenneth Cassidy sleeps in a room with \n65 other prisoners.  ECF No. 1-4 at 9.  He sleeps within one foot of the prisoner on the bunk \nabove him, and within three to four feet of the four prisoners in the two bunks on either side of \nhim.  Id.  There are no barriers between the beds.  Id.  As of May 4, 2020, the men’s prison \nhoused 719 inmates.  ECF No. 24-2 at 4. \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 9 of 74\nIn the women’s satellite prison, all of the women are housed in a single dormitory-style \nroom that accommodates approximately 160-170 beds.  Petition ¶ 36.  The room is divided into \ncubicles, each containing two bunk beds, separated by approximately four feet.  Id.  Beds in each \ncubicle are immediately adjacent to the cubicle wall, which does not reach to the ceiling.  Id.  In \nsome instances the wall does not even reach the top of the bunk bed, and the woman on the top \nbunk sleeps right next to the woman on the top bunk in the adjacent cubicle.  Id.  The women in \nthe satellite prison share three bathrooms, each of which includes between 4-8 toilets, sinks, and \nshowers.  Id.  As of May 4, 2020, the women’s satellite prison housed 131 inmates.  ECF No. 24-\n2 at 5. \nThe women’s prison camp is a large building divided into four dormitories, each \nconsisting of cubicles and bunk beds.  Id. at 4.  The cubicles have no doors and their dividing \nwalls do not extend to the ceilings.  Petition ¶ 37.  The bunk beds are less than six feet apart.  Id.  \nEach of the four dormitories has a common shower and bathroom area.  Id.   Three of the dorms \nhouse 47 women each, and the fourth houses 7.  Id.  As of May 4, 2020, the women’s camp \nhoused 134 inmates.  ECF No. 24-2 at 4.5 \nThe Petitioners complain that social distancing—arguably the most effective measure for \npreventing the spread of COVID-19—is impossible at FCI Danbury.  Most of the inmates at FCI \nDanbury live in large, open dormitories with 50 or more other inmates, where they sleep within 3 \nto 4 feet of between 3 and 5 other prisoners.  Petition ¶ 149.   Prisoners use the same bathrooms \nand share a limited number of toilets, sinks, and showers, as well as a limited number of \ntelephones and computers, which are located close together in common areas.  Id.  Moreover, \n \n5 As these two sentences show, the figures estimated by Petitioners differ somewhat, but not materially, from those \nestimated by Respondents; these differences may be a function of the different times at which they filed their \nsubmissions. \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 10 of 74\naccording to Petitioners, prisoners are unnecessarily made to line up in close proximity to one \nanother to receive their meals and medications.  Id. ¶ 150. \nThe Warden contends that she has taken substantial steps toward implementing social \ndistancing.  In general, smaller inmate groups at FCI Danbury have been formed by separating \ninmates by housing unit so they can “shelter in place” with the fewest number of fellow inmates.  \nECF No. 24-2 at 9.  These groups are rotated through the recreation facility by themselves, and \nthe facility is disinfected between groups.  Id.  Programs, including “Education, Psychology, and \nReligious Services” are delivered in each unit, and meals are delivered directly to the units by \nstaff (rather than inmate food service workers) in order to maintain the integrity of the inmate \ngroup quarantine.  Id.  While the Respondents compare this arrangement to “family units in the \ngeneral population,” and note that an inability to full socially distance is typical of many, if not \nall, correctional institutions, ECF No. 24-1 at 73, the fact remains that true social distancing \nappears to be unachievable at FCI Danbury, creating an environment where the risk of \ntransmission is significantly heightened. \n2.  Screening and Testing \nPetitioners contend that the Warden has failed to adequately screen inmates for COVID-\n19 symptoms and test and isolate inmates exhibiting symptoms.  According to Petitioners, \ninmates who complain to staff of symptoms consistent with COVID-19—including coughing, \ncongestion, and shortness of breath—are routinely unable to obtain immediate medical \nexamination, are not tested for COVID-19, and are returned to the general population until their \nsymptoms worsen.  Petition ¶ 131.  For example, Kimberly Hoisington, an inmate at the satellite \nprison, indicates that on March 26, she reported being ill to staff on two separate occasions, but \nwas told to lie down.  ECF No. 1-7 at 2.  By early morning on March 27, she developed severe \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 11 of 74\nchest pain and was eventually taken to the hospital, where she tested positive for COVID-19.  Id.  \nSimilarly, Christina Korbe, an inmate at the satellite prison, submitted testimony indicating that, \nin early April, she began experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, including a severe \nheadache, body aches, fever, shortness of breath, and “a terrible cough”—the “worst cough I \nhave ever had.”  ECF No. 1-5 at 2.  She spoke to the medical department multiple times about \nher symptoms but was never offered a test for COVID-19.  Id.  Despite her symptoms, she was \nnot quarantined but was instead kept with the general population.  Id.  She further claims that she \nhas personally observed many other prisoners with symptoms similar to hers, but that the \nmajority of these women were not placed into quarantine.  Id. at 3.  Petitioner Cassidy, an inmate \nat the men’s prison, indicates that “[a]pproximately 80% of prisoners in my unit show flu-like \nsymptoms, including fever, coughing, body aches, shortness of breath, chest pressure, and \nheadaches.”  ECF No. 1-4 at 3. \nInmate Christina Korbe also relates that, on April 24, a woman at the satellite prison \nbecame extremely sick, vomiting and struggling for air.  ECF No. 1-5 at 3.  Other inmates were \naround her, trying to help her, without wearing any gloves or masks.  Id.  She was sick for hours \nand throughout the night, and the inmates did not understand why the staff did not take her to the \nhospital.  Id.  In response to concern among the inmates, a correctional officer (a lieutenant) \ncame into the dormitory and announced that anyone who used the phone to contact people on the \noutside about the incident would get a disciplinary violation, and that the inmates needed to “stay \nin [their] lane” because they “are not doctors.”  Id.  The sick woman was eventually taken to the \nhospital early on April 25.  Id.  At oral argument, the Respondents indicated that she was taken \nto the hospital because she was aspirating—choking on her own vomit—and that she was \nintubated for this reason, although she also tested positive for COVID-19.  The Respondents \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 12 of 74\nfurther indicated that she was taken off the ventilator the very next day and sent back to FCI \nDanbury after only two nights in the hospital.  According to Christina Korbe, many of the \nwomen who had been in contact with the woman who was taken to the hospital were tested for \nCOVID-19, and at least ten of them tested positive.  These women have been quarantined, but \nwere first allowed to come back to the dormitory to get their personal belongings and take \nshowers.  Id. at 3-4. \nThe Warden contends that inmates are screened daily for COVID-19 symptoms.  For \nexample, beginning on April 9, 2020, the Lieutenants at FCI Danbury began visiting each \nhousing unit daily to take the temperature of all inmates assigned to that unit.  ECF No. 24-2 at \n24.  Any inmate found to have a temperature of 99 degrees or higher is sent to Health Services \nfor a follow-up assessment by a licensed health care provider.  Id.  Petitioners contend, however, \nthat these readings are sometimes manipulated to avoid appropriate follow-up by requiring \nprisoners to drink a glass of cold water, attributing high readings to equipment error, or holding \nthe temperature wand too far from inmates’ foreheads.  Petition ¶ 134.  According to inmate \nKimberly Hoisington, for example, when she was taken to the hospital, her temperature was 102 \ndegrees upon arrival, while an hour earlier, FCI Danbury staff had told her that her temperature \nwas 97 degrees.  ECF No. 1-7 at 2. \nIn general, the Warden claims that any inmate at FCI Danbury presenting with symptoms \nconsistent with COVID-19 is immediately evaluated by a medical provider to determine whether \ntesting and/or isolation is appropriate, whether contact tracing might be necessary, and whether \ninmates with whom the symptomatic inmate had contact might need to be quarantined.  ECF No. \n24-2 at 24.  The decision whether to test an inmate for COVID-19 is made by BOP medical \nproviders based on a number of criteria, including but not limited to: (1) the nature and severity \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 13 of 74\nof the symptoms; (2) the inmate’s potential exposure to COVID-19; and (3) whether the inmate \nis considered “high-risk.”  Id.  On April 14, 2020, FCI Danbury received an Abbott “ID NOW” \nmachine that can deliver test results within approximately 15 minutes.  Id. at 24-25.  As of May \n4, 2020, FCI Danbury had 150 COVID-19 testing kits in stock, and the facility has the ability to \norder and quickly receive additional kits from a designated vendor if needed.  Id. at 25.  Since \nthe advent of the emergency, 205 inmates have been tested for COVID-19; sixty-nine inmates \nand fifty-six staff have tested positive.  Id.  This includes testing of every woman at the satellite \nprison, performed at the behest of U.S. Senator Christopher Murphy between May 2nd and 3rd, \nduring which 20 of 143 women tested positive.  Id. \n3.  Isolation and Quarantine \nThe Petitioners claim that the Warden has further failed to adequately isolate individuals \ntesting positive for COVID-19 and to quarantine individuals who have had contact with inmates \ninfected with COVID-19.  According to the CDC’s “Interim Guidance on Management of \n[COVID-19] in Correction and Detention Facilities,” “as soon as an individual develops \nsymptoms of COVID-19, . . . they . . . should be immediately placed under medical isolation in a \nseparate environment form other individuals,” and “persons who are close contacts of a \nconfirmed or suspected COVID-19 case . . . should be placed under quarantine for 14 days.”  \nCDC (May 7, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-\ndetention/guidance-correctional-detention.html [hereinafter CDC, Interim Guidance].  For \nmedically isolated individuals, the CDC provides the following criteria for how long an \nindividual testing positive must be isolated: \n•  For individuals who will be tested to determine if they are still \ncontagious: \n  The individual has been free from fever for at least 72 hours without \no\nthe use of fever-reducing medications AND \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 14 of 74\n  The individual’s other symptoms have improved (e.g., cough, \no\nshortness of breath) AND \n  The individual has tested negative in at least two consecutive \no\nrespiratory specimens collected at least 24 hours apart \n•  For individuals who will NOT be tested to determine if they are still \ncontagious: \n  The individual has been free from fever for at least 72 hours without \no\nthe use of fever-reducing medications AND \n  The individual’s other symptoms have improved (e.g., cough, \no\nshortness of breath) AND \n  At least 10 days have passed since the first symptoms appeared \no\n•  For individuals who had a confirmed positive COVID-19 test but never \nshowed symptoms: \n  At least 10 days have passed since the date of the individual’s first \no\npositive COVID-19 test AND \n  The individual has had no subsequent illness \no\nId. \n According to Petitioners, in spite of this guidance, prisoners who test positive for \nCOVID-19 are returned to the general population far earlier than appropriate.  Petition ¶ 140.  \nFor example, Tamika Somerville, an inmate at the satellite prison, indicates that a woman in her \nunit, who sleeps in the adjacent cubicle, was removed from the unit because she had a fever, \ntested positive for COVID-19 on a Tuesday, and was returned to the unit that same Friday.  ECF \nNo. 1-9 at 3.  The Petitioners also indicate that staff members who test positive for COVID-19 \nreturn to work while still symptomatic. For example, inmate Marius Mason indicates that one \nofficer told her she still felt ill and did not want to be at work, but was nonetheless told to return.  \nECF No. 1-6 at 3. \nThe Warden, on the other hand, indicates that separate housing spaces have been \nestablished for “isolation” (for inmates demonstrating symptoms) and “quarantine” (for \nasymptomatic inmates) in each of the three facilities, and each facility has the ability to create \nadditional isolation/quarantine space should the need arise.  ECF No. 24-2 at 10-11.  She \nindicates that all inmates who present with COVID-19 symptoms are isolated and tested the \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 15 of 74\nsame day, “provided testing supplies are available.”  Id. at 26.  According to the warden, under \nno circumstance are inmates who have been placed in isolation released to the general population \nprior to meeting the CDC’s symptom-based criteria.6  Id. at 27.  Staff are subjected to screening, \nincluding having their temperature taken, prior to the start of every shift.  Id. at 16.  If a staff \nmember reports symptoms consistent with COVID-19, he or she is sent home.  Id. at 17.  If a \nstaff member tests positive, his or her suitability for returning to work is evaluated under the \nCDC’s symptom-based criteria (as described in footnote 4).  Id. \n4.  Sanitation and Hygiene \nPetitioners claim that they do not have adequate cleaning supplies to clean their personal \nareas, and that shared living spaces throughout the facility are not regularly or properly \ndisinfected to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  Petition ¶ 159.  Telephones, computers and \nvideo calling equipment, and televisions shared by hundreds of prisoners are not cleaned or \ndisinfected between uses, and the common areas in which the equipment is located is not \nregularly or properly disinfected.  Id. ¶ 161.  CDC Guidance further recommends thoroughly \ncleaning and disinfecting all areas where confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases spent time.   \nCDC, Interim Guidance.  According to Petitioners, however, units where prisoners who test \npositive were housed are not being subjected to any heightened cleaning.  Petition ¶ 162.  \nPetitioners also indicate that prisoners have no access to hand sanitizer, which has been out of \nstock at the commissary for the duration of the present crisis, and that liquid soap dispensers \nwere only recently installed in the men’s prison but are not regularly restocked.  Id. ¶ 163.  \nAccording to the Petitioners, soap is unavailable to indigent prisoners.  Id. ¶ 165. \n \n6 The Warden describes these criteria as follows: “(1) being fever-free for greater or equal to 72 hours without the \nuse of fever-reducing medication, and (2) respiratory symptoms have improved, and (3) at least 7 days have passed \nsince the first symptoms appeared.”  ECF No. 24-2 at 27. \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 16 of 74\nThe Warden, by contrast, indicates that cleaning supplies are distributed throughout the \nfacility on a daily basis, including a broad-spectrum disinfectant (“Virex II/256”), which was \nadded specifically to address the coronavirus threat.  ECF No. 24-2 at 12-13.  Once in the \nhousing units, cleaning supplies are maintained in small caddies or bins kept in staff offices or \ncloses, which inmates can then ask to bring back to their living areas.  Id. at 13.  Large area \ndisinfection is being performed at both the satellite prison and the men’s prison through the use \nof backpack cleaning chemical sprayers.  Id.  While the Warden indicates that recreational areas \nare disinfected between uses, she does not indicate whether items such as phones and computers \nare disinfected between uses.  As for soap and other personal hygiene products, the Warden \nmaintains that inmates at FCI Danbury are provided with basic soap and personal hygiene \nproducts by the institution, and that “there is never a reason an inmate should not have access to \nsoap at FCI Danbury.”  Id. at 14.  In addition, prisoners can purchase up to 13 different kinds of \nsoap, as well as other personal hygiene products, from the commissary.  Id.   The Warden does \nnot indicate whether inmates have access to hand sanitizer. \n5.  Personal Protective Equipment \nAccording to the Warden, staff at FCI Danbury have, and will continue to have, access to \nappropriate personal protective equipment (“PPE”).  ECF No. 24-2 at 15.  Upon reporting to \nwork each day, staff at FCI Danbury are provided with new surgical masks, which they are \nrequired to wear throughout their shift.  Id.  Additional PPE, including gowns, gloves, N-95 \nparticulate respirators, and face shields, are available for staff working in Health Services, \nReceiving & Discharge, and isolation housing units. Id.  Staff are instructed as to the proper use \nof PPE.  Id.  Inmates at FCI Danbury were initially provided with two of the same surgical masks \nprovided to staff.  Id. at 16.  Once FCI Danbury was able to procure cloth masks, two of these \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 17 of 74\nmasks were issued to every inmate.  Id.  Upon request, inmates are still provided with the same \nsurgical masks provided to staff.  Id.  Inmates are required to wear these masks at all times, \nexcept when they are eating or sleeping, and failure to do so can result in disciplinary action.  Id. \nPetitioners contend that the usage of PPE is inconsistent, and correctional staff do not \nenforce mask usage against prisoners who refuse to cover their faces, nor do correctional staff \nconsistently wear masks or gloves when they are in the units.  Petition ¶ 182.  Prisoners—\nincluding prisoners on cleaning duty—are not provided with gloves to protect their hands from \nexposed surfaces.  Id. ¶ 180.  And in many parts of the facility, FCI Danbury only provides one \nmask per prisoner and, therefore, prisoners have no protection when their masks are being \nwashed.  Id. ¶ 179. \n6.  Medical Treatment for Other Conditions \nPetitioners allege that, since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, non-virus medical needs \nhave sometimes gone unattended.  Petition ¶ 188.  Prisoners who do not present with a fever \nduring sick call cannot gain access to a physician, and sick call requests unrelated to the virus go \nunanswered for prolonged periods of time.  Id.  Petitioners indicate that medical triage in the \nmen’s prison is conducted by a social worker without medical training, who is openly \ncontemptuous of the men’s needs.  Petition ¶ 129.  Petitioner Cassidy represents, for example, \nthat the social worker told the men in his unit, “You are all fucking children with nothing more \nthan a flu so stop your shit you’re not going home early.”  ECF No. 1-4 at 5-6.  She has also told \nthe men, “I don’t need medical training to tell you you’re not sick so go lay the fuck down.”  Id. \nPetitioners further indicate the prison pharmacy has been closed, and medications must \nbe shipped from another facility, resulting in delays in their delivery and disruption of \nmedication regimens.  Id. ¶ 189.  Petitioner Cassidy, for example, indicates that he did not \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 18 of 74\nreceive the correct dose of his medication for two weeks in April, ECF No. 1-4 at 3, and \nPetitioner Martinez-Brooks indicates that her blood pressure medicine ran out on April 2 and \nadditional medicine did not reach her until April 10.  ECF No. 1-3 at 4.  Similarly, inmates with \nspecial medical diets or allergies have received meals containing ingredients harmful to their \nhealth.  Prisoners with peanut allergies have received meals containing peanut products, and \nPetitioner Cassidy, who suffers from diverticulosis, has received meals containing rice and \nbeans.  Petition ¶ 190.  Petitioners further indicate that, as a result of staff shortages, officers and \nstaff are sometimes not available to respond to medical emergencies.  Id. ¶ 187. \nThe Warden, while acknowledging that several medical staff are on leave, for reasons \nboth related and unrelated to COVID-19, indicates that a BOP Medical Asset Support Team, \nincluding an Associate Warden, two physician assistants, and one pharmacist, has been \ndispatched to FCI Danbury to assist with its COVID-19 response.  ECF No. 24-2 at 25-26.  The \nWarden maintains that inmates continue to have access to Health Services, but that, in order to \nmaintain the integrity of the group quarantines, Health Services staff (including the social worker \nand the dental hygienist) go to the individual housing units to pass out and collect “sick call \nforms,” which are written requests to Health Services.  Id. at 26.  These staff do not perform any \nassessments at that time.  Id.  The “sick call” forms are then triaged by a registered nurse or a \nphysician assistant for appropriate action.  Id.  If it is determined that inmates need to be seen in \nthe clinic, they are set for an appointment at a time they can move to the clinic with other \nmembers of their quarantine group or unit.  Id.  For emergent medical needs, an inmate can \nalways be specifically called up to the clinic outside the scheduled time for his or her unit.  Id.  \nThe Warden also indicates that the pharmacy at FCI Danbury has remained functioning \nthroughout the course of the current crisis, and that there are two scheduled times per day when \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 19 of 74\ninmates can, with their quarantine group, proceed to the clinic for “pill line” or for staff-assisted \nmedication administration.  Id. at 27. \nD.  Home Confinement and Compassionate Release \nBy contrast to the abundant factual disputes regarding the Warden’s implementation of \nsafety measures, the facts regarding the Warden’s use of home confinement and compassionate \nrelease are largely undisputed. \n1.  Home Confinement \nThe Bureau of Prisons has statutory authority to transfer prisoners to home confinement \nunder 18 U.S.C. § 3624(c)(2) and 34 U.S.C. § 60541.  ECF No. 24-2 at 18.  Under 18 U.S.C. \n§ 3624(c)(2), the Bureau of Prisons may “place a prisoner in home confinement for the shorter of \n10 percent of the term of imprisonment of that prisoner or 6 months.”   Under 34 U.S.C. § 60541, \nthe BOP may release some or all eligible elderly offenders7 and eligible terminally ill offenders8 \nfrom BOP facilities to home detention, upon written request from either BOP staff or an eligible \noffender. \n \n7 The statute defines “eligible elderly offender” to mean an offender in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons (i) “who \nis not less than 60 years of age”; (ii) “who is serving a term of imprisonment that is not life imprisonment based on \nconviction for an offense or offense that do not include any crime of violence . . . , sex offense . . . , or offense under \nchapter 37 of title 18, and has served 2/3 of the term of imprisonment to which the offender was sentenced”; (iii) \n“who has not been convicted in the past of any Federal or State crime of violence, sex offense, or other offense \ndescribed in clause (ii)”; (iv) “who has not been determined by the Bureau of Prisons, on the basis of information the \nBureau uses to make custody classifications, and in the sole discretion of the Bureau, to have a history of violence, \nor of engaging in conduct constituting a sex offense or other offense described in clause”; (v) “who has not escaped \nor attempted to escape”; (vi) whose release “will result in a substantial net reduction of costs to the Federal \nGovernment”; and (vii) “who has been determined by the Bureau of Prisons to be at no substantial risk of engaging \nin criminal conduct or of endangering any person or the public if released to home detention.”  34 U.S.C. § \n60541(g)(5)(A). \n8 The statute defines “eligible terminally ill offender” to mean an offender who (i) “is serving a term of \nimprisonment based on a conviction for an offense or offenses that do not include any crime of violence . . . , sex \noffense . . . , offense described in section 2332b(g)(5)(B) of title 18, or offense under chapter 37 of title 18”; (ii) \n“satisfied the criteria specified in clauses (ii) through (vii) of subparagraph (A) [defining eligible elderly offender]”; \nand (iii) “has been determined by a medical doctor approved b the Bureau of Prisons to be . . . (I) in need of care at a \nnursing home, intermediate care facility, or assisted living facility . . . or . . . (II) diagnosed with a terminal illness.”  \n34 U.S.C. § 60541(g)(5)(D). \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 20 of 74\nOn March 26, 2020, Attorney General Barr issued a memorandum to the Director of the \nBureau of Prisons, titled “Prioritization of Home Confinement As Appropriate in Response to \nCOVID-19 Pandemic.”  ECF No. 24-2 at 45.  In the memo, Attorney General Barr stated that \n“there are some at-risk inmates who are non-violent and pose minimal likelihood of recidivism \nand who might be safer serving their sentences in home confinement rather than in BOP \nFacilities.”  Id.  He directed the Bureau to “prioritize the use of your various statutory authorities \nto grant home confinement for inmates seeking transfer in connection with the ongoing COVID-\n19 pandemic.”  Id.  The memo provides a non-exhaustive list of discretionary factors for \nevaluating inmates for confinement.  First and foremost among these is the “age and \nvulnerability of the inmate to COVID-19, in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention (CDC) guidelines.”  Id.  The other factors in the memo include: \n•  The security level of the facility currently holding the inmate, with priority \ngiven to inmates residing in low and minimum security facilities; \n•  The inmate's conduct in prison, with inmates who have engaged in violent or \ngang-related activity in prison or who have incurred a BOP violation within \nthe last year not receiving priority treatment under this Memorandum; \n•  The inmate's score under PATTERN, with inmates who have anything above \na minimum score not receiving priority treatment under this Memorandum; \n•  Whether the inmate has a demonstrated and verifiable re-entry plan that will \nprevent recidivism and maximize public safety, including verification that the \nconditions under which the inmate would be confined upon release would \npresent a lower risk of contracting COVID-19 than the inmate would face in \nhis or her BOP facility; \n•  The inmate's crime of conviction, and assessment of the danger posed by the \ninmate to the community. Some offenses, such as sex offenses, will render an \ninmate ineligible for home detention. Other serious offenses should weigh \nmore heavily against consideration for home detention. \nId. at 46. \nOn March 27, 2020, Congress enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic \nSecurity Act (“CARES Act”), which authorized the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to lengthen \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 21 of 74\nthe amount of time prisoners can be placed on home confinement under Section 3624(c)(2)—\npreviously capped at the shorter of 10% of their sentence or 6 months—provided that the \nAttorney General makes a finding that “emergency conditions will materially affect the \nfunctioning of the Bureau.”9  CARES Act, Pub. L. No. 116-136, § 12003(b)(2) (2020). \nAttorney General Barr made quick use of his authority under the CARES Act, issuing a \nmemo on April 3, 2020, in which he made the requisite finding that “emergency conditions are \nmaterially affecting the functioning of the Bureau.”  ECF No. 24-1 at 48.  The memo indicated \nthat the Bureau of Prisons was “experiencing significant levels of infection at several of our \nfacilities, including FCI Oakdale, FCI Danbury, and FCI Elkton.”   Id.  Noting the Bureau’s \n“profound obligation to protect the health and safety of all inmates,” Attorney General Barr \ndirected the Bureau to “move with dispatch in using home confinement, where appropriate, to \nmove vulnerable inmates out of these institutions.”  Id.   \nReflecting the urgency of the situation, Attorney General Barr’s memo directed \nimmediate action.  He directed the Bureau to “immediately review all inmates who have \nCOVID-19 risk factors, as established by the CDC,” to “immediately maximize appropriate \ntransfers,” and to “begin implementing this directive immediately.”  Id. at 49.  He noted that, \n“[g]iven the speed with which this disease has spread through the general public, it is clear that \ntime is of the essence,” and directed the Bureau to “implement this Memorandum as quickly as \npossible . . . .”  Id. \n \n9 Section 12003(b)(2) provides that “[d]uring the covered emergency period, if the Attorney General finds that \nemergency conditions will materially affect the functioning of the Bureau, the Director of the Bureau may lengthen \nthe maximum amount of time for which the Director is authorized to place a prisoner in home confinement under the \nfirst sentence of section 3624(c)(2) of title 18, United States Code, as the Director determines appropriate.”  CARES \nAct, Pub. L. No. 116-136, § 12003(b)(2) (2020). \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 22 of 74\n Attorney General Barr’s memorandum specifically named FCI Danbury—out of over \none hundred BOP facilities--as one of three experiencing significant outbreaks and with respect \nto which the Bureau was to move “as quickly as possible.”  Id. 48-49.  Moreover, the Attorney \nGeneral made clear that the Bureau’s review was to include “all at-risk inmates—not only those \nwho were previously eligible for transfer” and “starting with the inmates incarcerated FCI \nOakdale, FCI Danbury, FCI Elkton, and similarly situated facilities where [the Director] \ndetermine[s] that COVID-19 is materially affecting operations.”  Id. at 49.  The Attorney \nGeneral went further, stating that although the BOP has limited resources to monitor inmates on \nhome confinement, he was authorizing it to transfer inmates to home confinement “even if \nelectronic monitoring is not available, so long as BOP determines in every such instance that \ndoing so is appropriate and consistent with our obligation to protect public safety.”  Id.  Noting, \nhowever, the Bureau’s responsibility to protect the public, Attorney General Barr directed the \nBureau to continue to make “individualized determinations” and cautioned against the \n“indiscriminate” release of prisoners.  Id. at 50. \nDespite the explicit statutory authority under the CARES Act to place any inmate on \nhome confinement, and despite Attorney General Barr’s urgent memorandum calling out FCI \nDanbury and directing immediate action, the Warden’s use of her home confinement authority \nhas been limited.  Since March 26, the Warden indicates that of the nearly 1,000 inmates at FCI \nDanbury, only 159 inmates have been reviewed for home confinement, and only 21 of these have \nbeen released to home confinement.  ECF No. 24-2 at 23.10   \n \n10 The Warden indicates that another 2 inmates have been released on furlough until the beginning of a previously \nestablished home confinement date.  ECF No. 24-2 at 23-24. \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 23 of 74\nIn her description of the Bureau’s—and FCI Danbury’s—implementation of Attorney \nGeneral Barr’s memoranda and the Bureau’s expanded home confinement authority under the \nCARES Act, the Warden indicates that BOP Case Management staff are reviewing inmates for \nsuitability for home confinement, and that inmates do not need to apply to be considered, \nalthough any inmate who believes he or she is eligible may submit a request.  Id. at 22.  The \nWarden indicates that BOP is currently assessing “a number of factors to ensure an inmate is \nsuitable for home confinement including, but not limited to, reviewing the inmate’s institutional \ndisciplinary history for the last twelve months; ensuring the inmate has a verifiable release plan; \nverifying the inmate’s primary offense is not violent, a sex offense, or terrorism related; and \nconfirming the inmate does not have a current detainer.”  Id. at 23.  In addition, the Warden \nindicates that, at this time, BOP is “prioritizing for consideration those inmates who either (1) \nhave served 50% or more of their sentence, or (2) have 18 months or less remaining in their \nsentence and have served 25% or more of their sentence.”  Id.  The Warden does not provide any \nindication regarding the extent to which inmates’ COVID-19 risk factors—such as their age and \npreexisting medical conditions—are weighed in evaluating inmates for home confinement. \nA Danbury Inmate Bulletin from the Warden dated April 16, 2020 and titled “Criteria for \nHome Confinement based on COVID-19 Guidelines,” apparently distributed to inmates, \nindicates that the criteria for home confinement include: “No incident reports in the past 12 \nmonths (regardless of severity level)”; “U.S. Citizen”; “PATTERN risk score is MINIMUM”; \nand “Mental Health Care Level is less than CARE-MH 4.”  ECF No. 15-7 at 2.  The April 16 \nBulletin further indicates that “Other considerations” include age, projected release date, \npercentage of time served, medical care level, issues related to victims, date of arrival to FCI \nDanbury, gang-related activity, health concerns of residents in the proposed release plan, and \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 24 of 74\nmedical needs/concerns in the community.  Id.  A more recent Danbury Inmate Bulletin, dated \nApril 21, 2020 and titled “Updated criteria for Home Confinement based on COVID-19 \nguidelines,” lists eight criteria that “must” be met to be eligible for home confinement: \n1.  Primary Offense is not violent; \n2.  Primary Offense is not sex offense; \n3.  Primary Offense is not terrorism; \n4.  No detainer; \n5.  Mental Health Care Level is less than IV; \n6.  PATTERN risk score is MIN; \n7.  No Incident Reports in the past 12 months; \n8.  Inmate must have served at least 50% of their sentence [bolded in original] \nECF No. 15-8 at 1.  The April 21 Bulletin gives no indication whether and how inmates’ \nCOVID-19 risk factors are factored into the analysis. \n2.  Compassionate Release \nUnder 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), a sentencing court may, upon motion of the Director of \nthe Bureau of Prisons or upon motion of the defendant, reduce a defendant’s term of \nimprisonment if it finds that “extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a reduction.”11  \nThis authority is often referred to as “compassionate release.”  Importantly, if the Bureau of \nPrisons does not bring a motion for compassionate release on behalf of a defendant, the \ndefendant may only bring a motion on his or her own behalf after either “fully exhaust[ing] all \nadministrative rights to appeal a failure of the Bureau of Prisons to bring a motion on the \ndefendant’s behalf” or “the lapse of 30 days from the receipt of such a request by the warden of \nthe defendant’s facility, whichever is earlier.”  18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A). \nSince the COVID-19 crisis began, it does not appear that the BOP has issued any updated \ninternal guidance as to the standards to be used in assessing whether there are “extraordinary and \n \n11 The statute further requires the sentencing court to consider the factors set forth in Section 3553(a) to the extent \nthat they are applicable.  18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A). \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 25 of 74\ncompelling reasons” warranting a reduction in a defendant’s term of imprisonment.  \nRespondents’ brief points to a BOP program statement that was last updated in January 2019.  \nECF No. 24-1 at 31 (citing Program Statement 5050.50, available at http://www.bop.gov/policy/ \nprogstat/5050_050_EN.pdf).  That document, of course, makes no mention of the current \npandemic; nor does it mention the risk of infection inside prisons in general.  Instead, it identifies \na few extreme situations that might make “compassionate release” appropriate.  These extreme \ncases include: “inmates who have been diagnosed with a terminal, incurable disease” or “an \nincurable, progressive illness” or “debilitating injury” that has left them “completely disabled” or \n“capable of only limited self care and . . . confined to a bed or chair more than 50% of waking \nhours”; inmates who are 65 or older, suffer from “chronic or serious medical conditions related \nto the aging process,” experience “deteriorating mental or physical health that substantially \ndiminishes their ability to function in a correctional facility,” have no prospect of “substantial \nimprovement” in their condition from “conventional treatment,” and have served at least half \ntheir sentence; inmates age 65 or older who have served the greater of 10 years or 75% of their \nsentence; and inmates whose minor children “are suddenly without a family member caregiver \ndue to that caregiver’s death or incapacitation.”  Id.  Even in these cases, “compassionate \nrelease” is far from guaranteed.  Instead, the inmate must satisfy a host of criteria, some of which \nare focused on public safety but others of which include the age at which the inmate committed \nthe offense, whether the inmate lived with the caregiver (in cases of deceased caregivers), and \nwhether the inmate received public funding or had a job prior to incarceration.  Id.   \nFor the Bureau of Prisons to bring a motion for compassionate release on behalf of a \ndefendant, a lengthy, multi-tiered administrative process must first play out.  First, the Warden \nmust determine that the request warrants approval.  Requests do not reach the Warden’s desk, \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 26 of 74\nhowever, until “various staff” at the prison have reviewed the request first.  ECF No. 24-2 at 27.  \nNext, even if the Warden approves the request, BOP regulations provide that the Director will \nmake a motion under Section 3582(c) only after further review by both the General Counsel and \neither the Medical Director or the Assistant Director, Correctional Programs Division.  28 C.F.R. \n§ 571.62.  Since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, however, the Warden has not approved a \nsingle request for compassionate release for referral to the General Counsel, and consequently no \ninmate at FCI Danbury has reached the latter stages of the Bureau’s administrative process.  See \nECF No. 24-2 at 27 (indicating that, from the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis through May 4, \n2020, prison officials have received 241 requests for compassionate release and that, of these, \n136 have been processed and denied, 18 have been returned to the inmate seeking further \ninformation, 70 are being reviewed by “various staff who need to review the application,” and 17 \nare awaiting the Warden’s review).   \nIn the event that the Warden denies a request, a defendant may bring a motion on his or \nher own behalf only after either “fully exhaust[ing] all administrative rights to appeal,” including \nappeals to the appropriate Regional Director and then to the General Counsel, or else waiting for \nthe 30-day statutory period to expire.  28 C.F.R. §. 571.63; 28 C.F.R. § 542.15. \nWhere inmates from across the country have managed to bring COVID-19 related \nmotions for compassionate release on their own behalf, they have enjoyed significant success \nbefore courts in this District.  See ECF No. 24-2 at 52-54 (indicating that approximately 25 out \nof 48 COVID-19 related motions for compassionate release have been granted in this District \nalone since the crisis began). \nIV.  DISCUSSION \nAs noted, Respondents have filed both a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) \nand 12(b)(6) and a response to the Petitioners motion for a temporary restraining order and \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 27 of 74\npreliminary injunction.  In the discussion below, I deny the Rule 12(b)(1) motion because I find \nthat the Warden’s jurisdictional challenges lack merit; I grant in part and deny in part the motion \nfor temporary restraining order and order expedited discovery and an evidentiary hearing to \nadjudicate the motion for preliminary injunction; and I deny the Rule 12(b)(6) motion because I \nfind that the Petition states a claim under 28 U.S.C. § 2241.   \nA.  The Warden’s Jurisdictional Arguments \n1.  Rule 12(b)(1) Standard \n“In resolving a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), the district court must take all \nuncontroverted facts in the complaint (or petition) as true, and draw all reasonable inferences in \nfavor of the party asserting jurisdiction.” Tandon v. Captain’s Cove Marina of Bridgeport, Inc., \n752 F.3d 239, 243 (2d Cir. 2014) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  “[W]here \njurisdictional facts are placed in dispute, the court has the power and obligation to decide issues \nof fact by reference to evidence outside the pleadings, such as affidavits.  In that case, the party \nasserting subject matter jurisdiction has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the \nevidence that it exists.”  Id. (citations, quotation marks, and alterations omitted).  “A case is \nproperly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) when the \ndistrict court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it.”  Gonzalez v. Option \nOne Mortgage Corp., 2014 WL 2475893, at *2 (D. Conn. June 3, 2014). \n2.  Sentencing Finality, the Court’s Authority under Section 2241, and the BOP’s \nStatutory Discretion \nRespondents argue that “[t]his Court lacks authority to divest the BOP and sentencing \ncourts of their jurisdiction to place inmates in home confinement or the sentencing judge’s \nauthority to amend a term of imprisonment.”  ECF No. 24-1.  This argument is not an obstacle to \nthe temporary restraining order I issue today, because the order does not divest the BOP of any \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 28 of 74\nauthority or infringe on the sentencing judge’s authority to amend a term of imprisonment.  It \nmerely directs the Respondents to exercise the authority already conferred on them to place \ninmates in home confinement and consider requests for compassionate release in a manner that \ndoes not violate the Eighth Amendment.   \nFirst, Respondents point to well-established law regarding the finality of sentences and \nthe limited, statutory authority of sentencing courts to modify them after they are imposed.  See, \ne.g., Dillon v. United States, 560 U.S. 817, 824 (2010) (“A judgment of conviction that includes \na sentence of imprisonment constitutes a final judgment and may not be modified by a district \ncourt except in limited circumstances.” (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)); 18 \nU.S.C. § 3582(c) (“The court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed \nexcept that … [listing specific exceptions for “compassionate release” and subsequent lowering \nof applicable Guideline ranges]”).  But it is clear from context that these restrictions apply to \nsentencing courts.  See 18 U.S.C. 3582(a) (referring to the factors that “[t]he court” must \nconsider “in determining whether to impose a term of imprisonment); id. 3582(c) (again referring \nto the “the court” when stating “[t]he court may not modify a term of imprisonment”); id. \n3582(c)(1)(B) (allowing “the court” to modify a term of imprisonment to the extent allowed by \nstatute or by Rule 35); Fed. R. Civ. Crim. P. 35(a) (“Within 14 days after sentencing, the court \nmay correct a sentence that resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear error.”).  It is less \nclear whether they apply to a judge presiding over a 2241 petition who did not sentence the \npetitioner—a common situation, because 2241 petitions must be filed in the jurisdiction of the \nplace of confinement rather than the jurisdiction of the sentencing court.  Rumsfeld v. Padilla, \n542 U.S. 426, 443 (2004) (“[T]he general rule [is] that for core habeas petitions challenging \npresent physical confinement, jurisdiction lies in only one district: the district of confinement.”)   \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 29 of 74\nI need not decide whether I have authority to modify the Petitioners’ sentences, however, \nbecause the order I impose today does not modify any sentences.  What it does do is ensure that \ninmates who face an imminent risk of serious illness or death from the rapid spread of the \ncoronavirus within the facility receive prompt review of either a request for compassionate \nrelease or consideration for home confinement, both of which are within the statutory authority \nof the BOP.   \nRespondents also argue that “release” is not an available remedy to a Section 2241 \npetitioner who challenges the conditions of his or her confinement, citing cases from courts \noutside the Second Circuit that have so held.   See, e.g., Glaus v. Anderson, 408 F.3d 382, 387 \n(7th Cir. 2005) (“Glaus’s [2241] habeas corpus petition would be proper if release were among \nthe possible remedies for an Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference claim.  Unfortunately for \nGlaus, it is not.  If an inmate established that his medical treatment amounts to cruel and unusual \npunishment, the appropriate remedy would be to call for proper treatment, or to award him \ndamages; release from custody is not an option.”).  But in their motion for a temporary \nrestraining order, Petitioners do not seek “release from custody.”  Instead, they seek (among \nother relief) “enlarge[ment] to home confinement,” ECF No. 14 at 112; in home confinement, \nthey would remain within the “custody” of the BOP.  See 18 U.S.C. 3624(c)(2) (authorizing the \nBOP to make home confinement placements under a subsection entitled “[p]release custody”); \nsee also United States v. Hope, 2018 WL 358490, at *4 (D. Mont. Jan. 10, 2018) (“When a \ndefendant is transferred pursuant to Section 3624(c), he remains under BOP custody until his \nprescribed term of imprisonment expires.”).  In any event, Respondents cite no Supreme Court or \n \n12 It is true that one of the forms of relief sought in the habeas petition itself is “release from custody.” ECF No. 1 at \n66 (praying for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus or injunctive relief “requiring Respondents to release from \ncustody or to home confinement members of the [medically vulnerable] Subclass ….”). \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 30 of 74\nSecond Circuit decision suggesting that release is categorically unavailable to a Section 2241 \npetitioner asserting an Eighth Amendment claim.  To the contrary, the Second Circuit affords \nhabeas petitioners bail, albeit “in unusual cases, or when extraordinary or exceptional \ncircumstances exist which make the grant of bail necessary to make the habeas remedy \neffective.”  Mapp v. Reno, 241 F.3d 221, 226 (2d Cir. 2001).   \nAlthough Mapp does not mention Section 2241, it involved a habeas petition brought on \nbehalf of immigration detainees, who commonly rely on Section 2241.  See, e.g., Basank v. \nDecker, 2020 WL 1953847 (S.D.N.Y Apr. 23, 2020) (2241 petition filed by ICE detainees \nseeking release because of the public health crisis posed by COVID-19); Ferreyra v. Decker, \n2020 WL 1989417 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 27, 2020) (same).  Further, the Mapp court’s statement of its \nholding makes clear that a federal court’s bail authority sweeps broadly across the habeas \nspectrum: “We hold that the federal courts have the same inherent authority to admit habeas \npetitioners to bail in the immigration context as they do in criminal habeas cases.”  Mapp, 241 \nF.3d at 223.  During the ongoing pandemic, district courts within the Circuit have relied on the \nauthority of Mapp to issue bail or temporary release orders to 2241 petitioners who have argued \nthat their conditions of confinement and medical histories make them especially vulnerable to \nserious illness from COVID-19.  See, e.g., Basank, 2020 WL 1953847, at *13 (“Even if [ICE \ndetainees petitioning under Section 2241] had not met the requirements for a preliminary \ninjunction, the Court would release them on bail pending final resolution of their habeas claims \nunder the Second Circuit’s decision in Mapp v. Reno, 241 F.3d 221, 226 (2d Cir. 2001).”); \nFerreyra, 2020 WL 1989417, at *12 (same); Coronel v. Decker, 2020 WL 1487274, at *8-9 \n(S.D.N.Y. March 27, 2020) (finding that “Petitioners have raised substantial claims” and that \n“[r]elease is . . . necessary to make the habeas remedy effective” because “[i]f Petitioners were to \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 31 of 74\nremain detained, they would face a significant risk that they would contract COVID-19—the \nvery outcome they seek to avoid.”).  \nRespondents also argue that “Petitioners . . . are seeking to divest the BOP of its statutory \nand regulatory discretion as to which inmates should be placed on home confinement.”  ECF No. \n24-1 at 47.  Here, Respondents invoke the language of Section 3621(b), which states, in part, that \n“[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, a designation of a place of imprisonment under \nthis subsection is not reviewable by any court.”  18 U.S.C. § 3621(b).   But this provision is not \nan obstacle to the order I impose today either, for several reasons.  First, Petitioners’ argument \nthat Respondents are not adequately exercising their authority under Section 3624, as expanded \nby the CARES Act and the Attorney General’s memo, does not require the Court to “review[]” \n“a designation of a place of imprisonment under this subsection,” i.e., under subsection 3621(b).  \nPetitioners are not challenging their designation to FCI Danbury.  Rather, they are challenging \nRespondents’ failure adequately to exercise their separate, recently expanded statutory authority \nunder subsection 3624(c)(2) to place inmates on home confinement.  While subsection 3621(b) \ngives the BOP broad, general authority over designations of and transfers to “places of \nimprisonment,” a term that some courts have construed to cover halfway houses as well as \nprisons, see, e.g., Goldings v. Winn, 383 F.3d 17, 26 (1st Cir. 2004), subsection 3624(c)(2) \nprovides specific, independent authority to place inmates in home confinement.13  So in finding \npreliminarily that Respondents are not exercising their authority under subsection 3624(c)(2) in a \n \n13 To be sure, the two are not unrelated, and the Second Circuit has suggested, in dicta, that, while the broad \nauthority in subsection 3621(b) is discretionary, the “prerelease” provisions of Section 3624, which includes the \nhome confinement authority of subsection 3624(c)(2), “impose[] an affirmative, discretion less obligation on the \nBOP, where practicable, to send an offender to a less-restrictive facility during a transitional period prior to final \nrelease.” Levine v. Apker, 455 F.3d 71, 75 (2d Cir. 2006) (citing cases, including Goldings v. Winn, 383 F.3d 17 (1st \nCir. 2004) (noting the “shall” language in Section 3624(c)(1))). \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 32 of 74\nconstitutionally adequate manner, I am not “review[ing]” the BOP’s “designation of a place of \nimprisonment” under subsection 3621(b).14  Second, to the extent there is any ambiguity about \nwhether Section 3621(b) or any other statute bars judicial review of the Respondents’ failures to \nexercise their authority under Section 3624, I would construe it not to do so to avoid the \nconstitutional question that would arise from a wholesale bar on judicial review in the \ncircumstances of this case.  Triestman v. United States, 124 F.3d 361, 378 (2d Cir. 1997) (“[W]e \nmust construe a federal statute to avoid constitutional questions where such a construction is \nreasonably possible.  By construing the habeas-preserving paragraph of Section 2255 to provide \nthat habeas corpus remains available to federal prisoners when Section 2255 is not available and \nwhen the failure to allow for some form of collateral review would raise serious constitutional \nquestions, we do just that.”); see also Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 603 (1988) (“[W]here \nCongress intends to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims its intent to do so must be \nclear . . . .  We require this heightened showing in part to avoid the serious constitutional \nquestion that would arise if a federal statute were construed to deny any judicial forum for a \ncolorable constitutional claim.” (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)).15 \n \n14 18 U.S.C. § 3625, which makes the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act inapplicable to designation, \ntransfer, and placement decisions by the BOP, also is not a bar to Petitioners’ challenge, which is brought under the \nhabeas statute, 28 U.S.C. § 2241, not the Administrative Procedure Act. \n15 During oral argument, Respondents also cited two decisions by another judge on this court, Fournier v. \nZickefoose, 620 F. Supp.2d 313 (D. Conn. 2009) and United States v. Ford, 2009 WL 3059129 (D. Conn. Sept. 21, \n2009).  But neither decision suggests that the Court is foreclosed from reviewing whether Respondents are \nexercising their authority under Sections 3624(c)(2) or 3582(c)(1)(A) in conformity with the Eighth Amendment.  In \nFournier, the Court reviewed the petitioner’s Section 2241 claim regarding the BOP’s refusal to allow her to serve \nthe remainder of her sentence in a halfway house or home confinement but found that it failed on the merits.  \nFournier, 620 F. Supp. 2d at 317-18 (noting that “[t]he general rule is that the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process \nClause does not confer any right upon an inmate to any particular custody or security classification,” that the BOP \nhad acted “within its authority to place Fournier” in a halfway house for a shorter period than she desired, and that \nher Eighth Amendment claim failed because she “neither claims that she has been deprived of the minimal civilized \nmeasure of life’s necessities” nor asserts that the Warden acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind).  \nSimilarly, in Ford, the court found that the defendant’s challenge to his designation to FCI Fairton failed on the \nmerits, concluding that “the BOP [] act[ed] well within its authority under section 3621” in making the designation.  \n2009 WL 3059129, at * 1.   \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 33 of 74\n3.  The Prison Litigation Reform Act and Res Judicata \nRespondents also raise objections based on the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § \n3626 (the “PLRA”), and res judicata, or claim preclusion.  ECF No. 24-1 at 54-58.  For the \nreasons set forth below, I find that neither objection precludes the order I enter today.   \na.  The PLRA \nThe provisions of the PLRA set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3626 impose restrictions on the \ntypes of relief federal courts can award in “any civil action with respect to prison conditions.”  18 \nU.S.C. § 3626(a).  Among other things, the statute requires that prospective relief—the type \nPetitioners seek in this case—be “narrowly drawn, extend[] no further than necessary to correct \nthe violation of the Federal right, and [be] the least intrusive means necessary to correct the \nviolation of the Federal right.”  18 U.S.C. § 3626(a).  In addition, the statute imposes strict \nprerequisites before a federal court may issue a “prisoner release order,” which is broadly \ndefined as “any order, including a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunctive relief, \nthat has the purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison population, or that directs the \nrelease from or non-admission of prisoners to a prison.”  18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(4).  Those \nprerequisites include the failure of some other, earlier-imposed remedy to address the deprivation \nof the federal right and the convening of a three-judge court.  Id. § 3626(a)(3).  None of these \nprovisions apply, however, unless the proceeding is a “civil action with respect to prison \nconditions,” a term that “means any civil proceeding arising under Federal law with respect to \nthe conditions of confinement or the effects of actions by government officials on the lives of \npersons confined in prison, but does not include habeas corpus proceedings challenging the fact \nor duration of confinement in prison.”  Id. § 3626(g)(2) (emphasis added).  Whether the \nrequirements of Section 3626 apply here turns on whether the italicized language in the \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 34 of 74\npreceding sentence describes this case.  For the reasons set forth below, I find that it does, and \nthus that Section 3626 is inapplicable. \nThe Petitioners in this case are challenging the conditions of their confinement but they \nare also challenging the “fact . . . of confinement in prison.”  Specifically, they contend that their \nmedical histories and the outbreak at FCI Danbury combine to place them in grave danger from \nCOVID-19; that at current facility population levels, they and other FCI Danbury inmates cannot \ncomply with CDC guidelines for physical distancing; and that “[a]s long as prisoners are unable \nto practice physical distancing, any other mitigating steps will fail to decrease meaningfully the \nrisk of COVID-19 infections at FCI Danbury.”  ECF No. 1 at 21.  The Petition seeks an order \neither releasing them from custody altogether or releasing them to home confinement, id. at 66, \nbecause, “[a]bsent significant de-densifying, people who are confined in prisons, jails, and \ndetention centers, as well as staff, will find it impossible to engage in the necessary social \ndistancing and hygiene required to mitigate the risk of transmission.”  Id. at 26; see also id. at 34 \n(“The only effective way to minimize the potential devastation from COVID-19 in BOP facilities \ngenerally and at FCI Danbury in particular is to downsize immediately the incarcerated \npopulation….”).  In short, Petitioners contend that the fact of their confinement in prison itself \namounts to an Eighth Amendment violation under these circumstances, and nothing short of an \norder ending their confinement at FCI Danbury will alleviate that violation.16 \nThese allegations show that, under the plain language of the definition quoted above, this \nis a habeas proceeding challenging “the fact . . . of confinement in prison.”  A “fact,” when used \n \n16 This contention distinguishes this case from the situation in Alvarez v. Larose, 20cv782-DMS(AHG) (S.D. Cal. \nMay 9, 2020) (attached to Respondents’ Notice of Additional Authority, ECF No. 29 at 16), where the court recently \nreached a different conclusion about the applicability of Section 3626 based in part on the fact that “Plaintiffs fail to \nargue there are no set of conditions of confinement that would be constitutionally sufficient.”  ECF No. 29 at 16.  \nHere, Petitioners are making precisely that argument as to the medically vulnerable subclass. \n34 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 35 of 74\nwith “the”, refers to, among other things, the “actual occurrence of an event” or the “real \nexistence of a situation or state of affairs.” Oxford English Dictionary (3d ed., Sept. 2014), \nhttps://www.oed.com/view/Entry/67478 (emphasis original); see also Webster’s Third New \nInternational Dictionary (defining a “fact” as, among other things, “something that has actual \nexistence,” “an occurrence, quality, or relation the reality of which is manifest in experience or \nmay be inferred with certainty,” and “an actual happening in time and space.”).  “Confinement” \nin turn, is defined as “the act or state of being confined,” i.e., “imprison[ed,” Webster’s Third \nNew International Dictionary,—a status that plainly applies to each of the Petitioners and those \nthey seek to represent in this case.  “[T]he fact . . . of confinement,” then, refers generally to the \nexistence of the state of being imprisoned.  Because Petitioners contend that the Eighth \nAmendment violation inheres in their incarceration at Danbury FCI and cannot be remedied \nunless they are removed from that setting, Petitioners are challenging the fact—or “existence”—\nof their confinement.  See also Wilson v. Williams, 2020 WL 1940882, at *5, 10 (N.D. Ohio Apr. \n22, 2020) (concluding that a similar habeas petition brought by inmates at FCI Elkton \n“ultimately seek[s] to challenge the fact or duration of confinement,” as well as the conditions of \nconfinement, and that the petition is not subject to the PLRA, 18 U.S.C. § 3626); Wilson v. \nWilliams, 20-3447, ECF No. 23-1 (6th Cir. May 4, 2020) (denying the Government’s motion to \nstay, holding that, “[w]here a petitioner claims no set of conditions would be constitutionally \nsufficient, we construe the petitioner’s claim as challenging the fact of the confinement,” and \nconcluding that the PLRA does not apply.). \nThe above construction of the statutory language accords meaning to all parts of the \ndefinition of “civil action with respect to prison conditions”—following a well-established canon \nof statutory construction.  See, e.g., U.S. v. Bernier, 954 F.2d 818, 819-20 (2d Cir. 1992) \n35 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 36 of 74\n(“[C]ourts must give effect to every word of a statute where possible. . . .  The sole exception to \nthis rule of construction applies where the statute groups words together in a list, in which case \nthe words should be given a related meaning. . . .  No ‘list’ appears in section 924(c), which \ncontains only two words.  Accordingly, each word should be given separate effect according to \nits plain meaning.”).  Because the first part of the definition already limits its scope to \nproceedings “with respect to the conditions of confinement or the effects of actions by \ngovernment officials on the lives of persons confined in prison,” habeas petitions unrelated to \nconditions of confinement—such as challenges to the validity of a conviction or the length of the \nsentence imposed by the court—are already excluded from the scope of the PLRA.  Thus, to \ninterpret the habeas clause of the definition to refer only to these types of petitions would make \nthe clause superfluous.  By contrast, interpreting the clause to refer to a subset of habeas petitions \n“with respect to the conditions of confinement . . . ”—namely, those that challenge the “fact or \nduration of confinement” by claiming, for example, that no constitutional conditions of \nconfinement are possible under the circumstances—gives effect to all parts of the definition.  Put \ndifferently, read as a whole, see U.S. v. Lockhart, 749 F.3d 148, 154 (“[I]t is well established that \nstatutory phrase should not be construed in isolation; we read statutes as a whole.” (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted), the definition in subsection (g)(2) strongly suggests that \nthere are habeas proceedings that challenge both the conditions of confinement and the “fact or \nduration of confinement,” and that such petitions are exempt from the statute.  The present case \npresents just such a petition.17 \n \n17 To the extent that its meaning is unclear, there is little law that further illuminates the phrase “but does not include \nhabeas corpus proceedings challenging the fact or duration of confinement in prison.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(2).  I \ncould find no legislative history that shed real light on the phrase, nor any case law within the Second Circuit that \nexplicates it.  As Respondents note, the Second Circuit has suggested, in dicta, that the PLRA applies to at least \nsome habeas petitions challenging conditions of confinement.  Jones v. Smith, 720 F.3d 142, 145 n.3 (2d Cir. 2013) \n36 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 37 of 74\nb.  Res Judicata \nRespondents’ res judicata argument points out that two of the petitioners have filed \nmotions for “compassionate release” under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), and that one of those \nmotions—filed by Petitioner Cassidy—was denied without prejudice by the sentencing judge.  \n(The motion has since been renewed, reportedly following Mr. Cassidy’s efforts to exhaust his \nadministrative remedies under Section 3582(c)(1)(A), and is pending before that judge.)  \nRespondents assert that “Petitioner Cassidy does not simply get a ‘do-over’ in the District of \nConnecticut after his same claim was rejected by” his sentencing judge.  ECF No. 24-1 at 54-55.  \nDuring oral argument, Petitioners’ counsel argued that Section 3582(c)(1)(A) and the Eighth \nAmendment consist of different elements and apply different legal standards, and so there would \nbe no preclusive effect on this case from a ruling by a sentencing judge denying a Section 3582 \nmotion. \n \n(after noting that an earlier decision had held that a habeas petition was not a “civil action” for purposes of the fee \nrequirements of the PLRA, stating as follows: “We recognize that [the earlier decision] spoke in general terms to the \neffect that ‘habeas corpus petitions’ are not civil actions covered by the PLRA.  We nonetheless assume without \ndeciding that, in so saying, the court meant habeas corpus petitions that challenge criminal convictions and \nsentences, and not petitions, sometimes brought under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, that complain of conditions of \nconfinement, which are analogous to suits under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 complaining of conditions of confinement.  The \nlogic of our [earlier decision] was to distinguish between civil actions covered by the PLRA and others based on the \ntype of relief sought, rather than the statute under which relief was sought.”).  But, for one, neither Jones nor the \nearlier decision it cites interpreted Section 3626(g)(2), as Section 3626 was not at issue in those cases, and it is \nunclear whether its definition of “civil action with respect to prison conditions” applies to other provisions of the \nPLRA.  Moreover, given the state of the law in the Second Circuit, the Jones dicta does not clearly address whether \nthe PLRA applies to habeas petitions that challenge both conditions of confinement and the fact or duration of \nconfinement.   Before and after Jones, district courts within the Second Circuit have entertained cases that \nchallenged conditions but did not seek release from confinement.    See, e.g., Ilina v. Zickefoose, 591 F. Supp.2d \n145, 150 (D. Conn. 2008) (denying motion to dismiss 2241 petition challenging conditions of confinement where \nprisoner sought “restoration of needed medical care at FCI Danbury”); Anderson v. Williams, 2016 WL 7217588, at \n*2 (evaluating on the merits  Section 2241 petition challenging conditions of confinement and motion for \npreliminary injunction to ensure that petitioner received certain medical tests and treatment).   The Jones dicta is \nbest read to suggest that it is these types of petitions that fall within the ambit of the PLRA (though not necessarily \nSection 3626).  To the extent that Respondents read Jones to equate “habeas corpus petitions that challenge criminal \nconvictions and sentences” with the term “habeas corpus proceedings challenging the fact or duration of \nconfinement in prison” in subsection (g)(2)—a statutory  provision that, again, the Jones court did not address—\nsuch a reading is inconsistent with the plain language of subsection (g)(2) for the reasons set forth above.  \n37 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 38 of 74\nThis argument raises novel issues—including whether an inmate could raise an Eighth \nAmendment claim in a motion brought under Section 3582(c)(1)(A) and whether a ruling on the \nmerits of such a motion (as opposed to a mere denial without prejudice) should be treated as a \njudgment having claim preclusive effect.  See Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Empresa \nNaviera Santa S.A., 56 F.3d 359, 366 (2d Cir. 1995) (“The doctrine of res judicata, or claim \npreclusion, holds that following entry of a valid final judgment, the parties to the suit and their \nprivies are thereafter bound not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain \nor defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible matter which might have been \noffered for that purpose.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  For the moment, however, I need \nnot decide these issues, because Respondents have not suggested that there are inmates falling in \nthe medically vulnerable subclass whose Section 3582 motions have been denied on the merits \nby their sentencing judges.  Should there be, the Respondents may file a motion asking that those \npersons be excluded from the group being prioritized for home confinement review under the \norder I issue today, in which case I will likely need to decide the issues set forth above.  Any \nsuch motion should attach a copy of the judge’s ruling denying the Section 3582(c)(1)(A) \nmotion. \n4.  Exhaustion18 \nRespondents argue that the Petitioners have failed to exhaust administrative remedies.  \nECF No. 24-1 at 42-43, 58-65.  They make this argument with respect to both Petitioners’ \n \n18It is debatable whether the exhaustion requirement for a Section 2241 habeas petition should be treated as a \n“jurisdictional” issue rather than as an affirmative defense.  As discussed below, the requirement is judge-made, \nrather than statutory, and is subject to various exceptions.  Nonetheless, because Respondents classify it as a \n“jurisdictional” flaw and because some district courts within the Second Circuit have as well, see e.g., United States \nv. Grajales, 2019 WL 2617027, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. June 26, 2019); but see Oliva v. INS, 1999 WL 61918, at *3 \n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 10, 1999), I treat it under the heading of jurisdictional issues.  \n38 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 39 of 74\nrequests for release to home confinement and their requests for “additional ‘safety’ measures.”  \nId. at 43.  Here, I address the exhaustion issue only with respect to the Petitioners’ requests for \nrelease to home confinement, as I grant the TRO only so that the medically vulnerable class can \nbe properly considered for that type of relief and for compassionate release.  \nExhaustion in the context of Section 2241 habeas petitions is a judge-made rule subject to \njudge-made exceptions.  U.S. ex rel. Scranton v. State of New York, 532 F.2d 292, 294 (2d Cir. \n1976) (“While 28 U.S.C. [] Section 2241 does not by its own terms require the exhaustion of \nstate remedies as a prerequisite to the grant of federal habeas relief, decisional law has \nsuperimposed such a requirement in order to accommodate principles of federalism.”); Carmona \nv. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, 243 F.3d 629, 634 (2d Cir. 2001) (“[O]ur decision today [applying the \ncause and prejudice standard for a Section 2241 habeas petitioner who had defaulted on his \nadministrative remedies] rests solely on the requirement of administrative exhaustion as spelled \nout in our decisional law . . . .” (emphasis added)); McPherson v. Lamont, 2020 WL 2198279, at \n*6 (D. Conn.

McGriff, 468 F. \nSupp.2d 445, 447 (E.D.N.Y. 2007 )(“A habeas petition [brought under Section 2241] is not subject to the \nadministrative exhaustion requirement of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PLRA”), 42 U.S.C. § \n1997e(a); instead it is subject to the judicially-created requirement that federal prisoners must exhaust their \nadministrative remedies prior to filing a petition for habeas relief.” (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).  \n39 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 40 of 74\nunnecessary where the administrative process would be incapable of granting adequate relief”); \nand undue prejudice (“an unreasonable or indefinite timeframe for administrative action may \nsufficiently prejudice [petitioners] to justify a federal court in taking a case prior to the complete \nexhaustion of administrative remedies”).  Washington v. Barr, 925 F.3d 109, 118-19 (2d Cir. \n2019); see also Gonzalez v. Perrill, 919 F.2d 1, 2 (1990) (In Section 2241 case, noting that “[t]he \ncontrolling standard is unambiguous: an appellant must exhaust his administrative remedies \nbefore seeking federal review of his conviction unless administrative procedures are unavailable \nor are incompetent to provide adequate redress.”).  \nThe Petitioners have set forth sufficient facts to support a finding that at least the final \nexception—undue prejudice from delay—applies here.   As noted above, the Warden has \nconsidered only 159 inmates for home confinement20 to date and has not yet even addressed 44% \nof the compassionate release requests.  Further, even after the Warden makes a decision, the \nBOP’s administrative remedy process involves two additional layers of review (by the Regional \nDirector and General Counsel), and each layer involves a new form and a new mailing.   See 28 \nC.F.R. § 542.15.  Given the rapid spread of COVID-19 at FCI Danbury, as evidenced by the \nnumber of positive tests among inmates and staff to date, Petitioners have shown that that they \nwould likely suffer irreparable harm if they were required to exhaust the administrative remedy \nprocess before seeking relief in court.  Accordingly, I find that the Petitioners are excused from \nexhaustion with respect to their claims seeking release to home confinement.21 \n \n20 In her declaration, the Warden states that “[i]nmates do not need to apply to be considered for home \nconfinement,” although they may do so.  ECF No. 24-2 at 22. \n21 Respondents also assert that “[a]s release from custody or placement in home confinement is not a remedy \navailable under a 28 U.S.C. § 2241 conditions of confinement habeas, an exhaustion analysis is not essential with \nrespect to those claims.”  ECF No. 24-1 at 43.  They cite no authority for the notion that “release from custody or \nplacement in home confinement is not a remedy” for Section 2241 claims challenging conditions of confinement, \nhowever, and, as discussed above, several district courts within the Second Circuit have released Section 2241 \n40 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 41 of 74\nB.  The Petitioners’ Request for a Temporary Restraining Order22 \n1.  Legal Standard \n“It is well established that in this Circuit the standard for an entry of a TRO is the same as \nfor a preliminary injunction.” Andino v. Fischer, 555 F. Supp. 2d 418, 419 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) \n(collecting cases).  In general, a party seeking a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining \norder “must . . . show a likelihood of success on the merits, a likelihood of irreparable harm in \nthe absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in the party's favor, and that an \ninjunction is in the public interest.” American Civil Liberties Union v. Clapper, 804 F.3d 617,  \n622 (2d Cir. 2015) (citing Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)).   “A showing \nof irreparable harm is the single most important prerequisite for the issuance of a preliminary \ninjunction.”  Faiveley Transp. Malmo AB v. Wabtec Corp., 559 F.3d 110, 118 (2d Cir. 2009) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The burden on the moving party is higher \nwhere, as here, that party seeks a mandatory injunction—that is, an injunction commanding a \npositive act, as opposed to one that merely maintains the status quo.  The Second Circuit has \ninstructed that a mandatory injunction “should issue ‘only upon a clear showing that the moving \nparty is entitled to the relief requested, or where extreme or very serious damage will result from \na denial of preliminary relief.’”  Tom Doherty Assocs., Inc. v.

Coughlin, 754 F.2d 1015, 1025 (2d Cir. 1985)).  \n \npetitioners challenging their conditions of confinement in light of COVID-19, relying on the broad authority to grant \nbail in habeas cases set forth in Mapp v. Reno, 241 F.3d 221 (2d Cir. 2001).   \n22 The rules governing habeas proceedings allow for application of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including \nRule 65 governing temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions, “to the extent that they are not \ninconsistent with any statutory provisions or these rules.”  Rule 12 of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the \nUnited States District Court; see also Rule 1(b) (“The district court may apply any or all of these rules to a habeas \ncorpus petition not covered by [28 U.S.C. § 2254].”).  \n41 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 42 of 74\nThe Petitioners seek a temporary restraining order to vindicate two somewhat distinct \nconstitutional claims.  As to the subclass of medically vulnerable inmates at high risk of serious \nillness or death from COVID-19, the Petitioners’ chief complaint is the Warden’s failure to make \nprompt, meaningful use of her authority to place inmates on home confinement and to grant \ncompassionate release —the only measures they contend are capable of offering such inmates \nadequate protection from COVID-19.  With respect to the broader class consisting of all inmates \nat FCI Danbury, the Petitioners claim that the Warden has failed to implement adequate safety \nmeasures to contain the spread of the virus and mitigate the risks of infection, including adequate \nscreening, testing, isolation, quarantine, sanitation, hygiene, and personal protective equipment.  \nI address each of these claims in turn. \n2.  The Medically Vulnerable Subclass and the Warden’s Home Confinement and \nCompassionate Release Authority \na.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits – Eighth Amendment \nUnder the Eighth Amendment, prison officials must “ensure that inmates receive \nadequate food, clothing shelter, and medical care, and must take reasonable measure to guarantee \nthe safety of the inmates.”  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994).  Prisoners have a \nright, in other words, to “humane conditions of confinement.”  Id.  “[H]aving stripped \n[incarcerated persons] of virtually every means of self-protection and foreclosed their access to \noutside aid, the government and its officials are not free to let the state of nature take its course.”  \nId. at 833. \nPrison officials violate a prisoner’s Eighth Amendment right to humane conditions of \nconfinement when two conditions are met.  First, under the “objective” component of the \nanalysis, “the alleged deprivation must be, ‘objectively,’ sufficiently serious.”  Id. at 834.  \n42 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 43 of 74\nSecond, under the “subjective” component, prison officials must have acted with a “sufficiently \nculpable state of mind,” namely, “‘deliberate indifference’ to inmate health or safety.”  Id. \ni.  Objective Component \nTo satisfy the objective component, “the inmate must show that he is incarcerated under \nconditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm.”  Id.  Here, this requirement is easily \nsatisfied.  Courts have long recognized that prison officials have an Eighth Amendment duty to \nprotect inmates from exposure to communicable disease.  See, e.g., Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d \n468, 477 (2d Cir. 1996) (“[C]orrectional officials have an affirmative obligation to protect \ninmates from infectious disease.”); Lareau v. Manson, 651 F.2d 96, 109 (2d Cir. 1981) \n(“[F]ailure to adequately screen newly arrived inmates for communicable disease” represents an \n“(omission) sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs” \n(quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976))); id. (“[I]t is unnecessary to require \nevidence that an infectious disease has actually spread in an overcrowded jail before issuing a \nremedy.”). \nIt is undisputed that there is an active and serious outbreak of COVID-19 at FCI \nDanbury.  Attorney General Barr’s April 3rd memorandum specifically identifies FCI Danbury \nas one of three federal prisons experiencing “significant levels of infection.”  ECF No. 24-2 at \n48.  A recent test of the inmates at the satellite prison—conducted following the intervention of \nSenator Chris Murphy—revealed that 20 of the 143 women at the facility had active infections.  \nECF No. 24-2 at 25.  In addition, 62 other inmates have been tested for COVID-19, and 49 of \nthese have tested positive, for a total of 69 positive tests.  ECF No. 24-2 at 25.  The high rate of \npositive tests outside of the satellite prison, and significant questions raised by the Petitioners as \nto the adequacy of testing, suggest this number may underrepresent the true number of COVID-\n43 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 44 of 74\n19 infections at FCI Danbury.  But even if that were not the case, the undisputed evidence leaves \nno doubt that FCI Danbury is experiencing an active outbreak of COVID-19. \nFurther, the structure of the three facilities at FCI Danbury—even assuming that all \nreasonable precautions and safety measures are being fastidiously observed (which the \nPetitioners dispute)—heightens the risk of transmission.  The cornerstone of the public health \nresponse to COVID-19 is to practice “social distancing.”  In the State of Connecticut, for \nexample, social gatherings of more than 5 people continue to be prohibited, and members of the \npublic are directed to wear face coverings wherever a six-foot distance cannot be maintained.  \nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), CT.gov, https://portal.ct.gov/Coronavirus (last visited \nMay 7, 2020); see also Social Distancing, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (April 15, \n2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html \n(“Limiting face-to-face contact with others is the best way to reduce the spread of [COVID-19],” \nincluding staying at least 6 feet from other people and avoiding group gatherings.).  In the \nmeantime, the vast majority of the 140 inmates at the satellite prison live and sleep in a perpetual \nlarge gathering—a single dormitory hall with bunk beds separated by four feet or less, with \nshared common spaces such as bathrooms and showers.  See ECF No. 1 at 12-13.  The inmates at \nthe camp and the men’s prison fare little better in terms of social distancing.  Most of the inmates \nat the camp and the men’s prison live in dorms that house roughly 50 people each.  ECF No. 1 at \n14.  Put differently, at a time when public health officials are counseling strict adherence to \nsocial distancing practice, most inmates at FCI Danbury live in close contact with between 50 \nand 140 other inmates, in a facility with a serious, active COVID-19 outbreak.  \nIt is also undisputed—and, indeed, by now common knowledge—that COVID-19 is a \nhighly dangerous disease that poses a significant risk of severe illness and death, particularly for \n44 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 45 of 74\nmembers of the Medically Vulnerable Subclass.  See ECF No. 1-1 at 6 (“Serious illness and \ndeath is most common among people with underlying chronic health conditions, like heart \ndisease, lung disease, liver disease, and diabetes, and older age.”); see also Wilson v. Williams, \n2020 WL 1940882, at *8 (N.D. Ohio Apr. 22, 2020) (“For infected inmates, the virus can lead to \npneumonia.  In the wors[t] pneumonia cases, COVID-19 victims suffer diminishing oxygen \nabsorption, with resulting organ failure leading to death.”).  According to one report, the \nmortality rate from COVID-19 is 8.4% for individuals with hypertension, 8.0% for individuals \nwith chronic respiratory disease, 7.6% for individuals with cancer, and 13.2% for individuals \nwith cardiovascular disease.  ECF No. 1 at 9-11 (citing Report of WHO-China Joint Mission on \nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), World Health Organization at 12 (Feb. 28, 2020), \nhttps://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-\nfinal-report.pdf (last visited May 7, 2020)). \nIn short, with respect to Petitioners and other members of the Medically Vulnerable \nSubclass, Petitioners have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits on their claim that \nthey are “incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm.” \nii.  Subjective Component \nUnder the subjective prong, a prison official may be held liable for inhumane conditions \nof confinement “only if he knows that inmates face a substantial risk of serious harm and \ndisregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.”  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 847; \nsee also Brock v. Wright, 315 F.3d 158, 164 (2d Cir. 2003) (“In order to prove deliberate \nindifference in a challenge to [a] prison inmate’s conditions of confinement, the prisoner must \nshow that a particular defendant ‘knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or \nsafety.’” (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837)).  In the context of threats to an inmate’s health, a \n45 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 46 of 74\nplaintiff must show that the defendant “acted with deliberate indifference to [the plaintiff’s] \nmedical needs.”  Brock, 315 F.3d at 162 (citing Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104).  In other words, the \nPetitioners must show that “the prison official knew of and disregarded the plaintiff’s serious \nmedical needs.”  Harrison v. Barkley, 219 F.3d 132, 137 (2d Cir. 2000) (quoting Chance v. \nArmstrong, 143 F.3d 698, 703 (2d Cir. 1998)).  “Deliberate indifference requires more than \nnegligence, but less than conduct undertaken for the very purpose of causing harm.”  Hathaway \nv. Coughlin, 37 F.3d 63, 66 (2d Cir. 1994).   \nHere, it cannot be disputed that the Respondent Warden knew of the substantial risk of \nserious harm posed by the COVID-19 outbreak at FCI Danbury.  On April 3—more than one \nmonth ago—Attorney General Barr issued an urgent memo to the Bureau of Prisons regarding \nCOVID-19, noting the “significant levels of infection at several of our facilities, including . . . \nFCI Danbury.”  ECF No. 24-2 at 48.  The Warden and her staff at FCI Danbury understood the \nthreat posed by COVID-19 at least as early as March 19, 2020, when they began modifying the \noperations at all three FCI Danbury facilities in response.  ECF No. 24-2 at 9-11.  Further, given \nthe pervasive daily media coverage of the pandemic, the seriousness of the threat posed by \nCOVID-19—and the particular vulnerability of elderly individuals as well as those with certain \npreexisting medical conditions—are so well known that it would be implausible to suggest that \nprison officials are unaware of this risk.  See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842 (“[A] fact finder may \nconclude that a prison official knew of a substantial risk from the very fact that the risk was \nobvious.”). \nThe parties vigorously dispute, however, whether prison officials have acted with \ndeliberate indifference to the risk posed by COVID-19.  The Petitioners contend that the \nWarden’s failure to transfer medically vulnerable prisoners from FCI Danbury to home \n46 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 47 of 74\nconfinement “in any meaningful numbers” constitutes deliberate indifference.  ECF No. 15 at 39.  \nI find that they have shown a likelihood of success on the merits with respect to this contention.  \nI also find that Warden’s handling of “compassionate release” requests under Section \n3582(c)(1)(A) bolsters the finding of deliberate indifference. \nHome Confinement \nAs discussed above, the CARES Act has given the Bureau of Prisons explicit authority to \nplace any inmate on home confinement, and the Attorney General has made the emergency \nfindings triggering that authority.  He has also directed the Bureau of Prisons in urgent terms to \n“immediately review all inmates who have COVID-19 risk factors, as established by the CDC, \nstarting with the inmates incarcerated at FCI Oakdale, FCI Danbury, FCI Elkton, and similarly \nsituated facilities . . . .”  ECF No. 24-2 at 48-49 (emphases added).  His April 3, 2020 \nmemorandum could not have conveyed a greater sense of urgency, instructing the Bureau to \n“begin implementing this directive immediately at the facilities I have specifically identified,” \nnoting that “time is of the essence,” and asking for implementation “as quickly as possible.”  Id. \nat 49. \nIn spite of the explicit statutory authorization in the CARES Act to make widespread use \nof home confinement in response to the threat posed by COVID-19, and the exhortations of the \nhead of the government department in which the Bureau of Prison sits, the implementation of \nthis directive at FCI Danbury has been slow and inflexible.  The Warden indicates that only 159 \ninmates have been reviewed since March 26, and a mere 21 inmates have actually been placed \non home confinement, out of a population of roughly 1,000.  ECF No. 23-24.  Moreover, the \ncriteria apparently being used by the Respondents to evaluate inmates for home confinement \nevidence a disregard for the seriousness of the health risk faced by vulnerable inmates.  Indeed, \n47 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 48 of 74\nthe most recent inmate bulletin regarding home confinement criteria does not even expressly \nmention health risks or how they will be evaluated.  ECF No. 15-8 (noting “updated criteria for \nHome Confinement based on COVID-19 guidelines” but not specifying any guidelines and \nlisting only non-health-related criteria)).  And the Warden’s description of the home confinement \nreview process suggests that, rather than prioritizing review based on age, medical history, and \nCOVID-19 risk factors, FCI Danbury is focusing on those who have served the larger portions of \ntheir sentences.  ECF No. 24-2 at 23.) In fact, the inmate bulletins make clear that those who \nhave not served a specified percentage of their sentences are categorically disqualified: any \ninmate who has not served at least 50% of his or her sentence is deemed ineligible for home \nconfinement, irrespective of vulnerability to COVID-19.  ECF Nos. 15-7, 15-8.23  Other criteria \nin the inmate bulletins are similarly unrelated to medical vulnerability and, at best, only \ntangentially related to public safety.  For example, any inmate with an incident report in the past \n12 months—no matter the seriousness—is deemed ineligible for home confinement, regardless \nof any health condition he or she might have.  ECF Nos. 15-7, 15-8.   At oral argument, the \nGovernment suggested that such an inmate could seek compassionate release as an alternative.  \nBut that is a dead end at FCI Danbury: Of the 241 requests for compassionate release filed since \nthe COVID-19 crisis began, the Warden has signed off on exactly 0.24  ECF No. 24-2 at 28. \nEspecially in light of the Barr memos, it is unimaginable that the Respondents would not \nbe taking COVID-19 medical risk factors—some of which, by some estimates, give an inmate a \n \n23 The Warden’s declaration puts it slightly differently: “BOP is at this time prioritizing for consideration those \ninmates who either (1) have served 50% or more of their sentence, or (2) have 18 months or less remaining in their \nsentence and have served 25% or more of their sentence.”  ECF No. 24-2 at 23. \n24 This is particularly troubling in light of the fact that numerous judges, including the undersigned, have denied \nmotions for compassionate release because the inmate has not first waded through the statutorily mandated \nadministrative process for requesting compassionate release from the Warden—a process that now appears to be the \ndefinition of futile. \n48 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 49 of 74\nbetter than 10% chance of dying should the inmate contract COVID-19—into consideration in \nreviewing inmates for home confinement.  But, at the very least, the lack of any express mention \nof such factors in both the inmate bulletins and the Warden’s declaration suggests that prison \nofficials are not giving these risk factors the weight they plainly deserve. \nThe Warden argues that the measures taken at FCI Danbury to protect inmates from \nCOVID-19, including screening, testing, quarantining, isolation of COVID-19 positive inmates, \nenhanced sanitation, and widespread use of personal protective equipment, show that she has not \ndisregarded, or acted with deliberate indifference toward, the threat posed by COVID-19.  But \neven accepting the Warden’s account of the scope, consistency, and effectiveness of these \nmeasures—an account the Petitioners vigorously dispute—Petitioners have shown a likelihood \nof success on the merits of their claim that the Warden’s inadequate implementation of the home \nconfinement authority in the CARES Act constitutes “deliberate indifference” under the Eighth \nAmendment.  The Warden does not dispute the impossibility of instituting effective social \ndistancing measures in facilities, like FCI Danbury, where the vast majority of the population \nlives and sleeps in large dormitory halls lined with bunk beds, sharing bathroom and shower \nfacilities.  See ECF No. 24-1 at 73.  But without social distancing measures, reliable containment \nof a highly contagious disease is nearly impossible.  This makes transfer to home confinement \n(or compassionate release, discussed below) the only viable measure by which the safety of \nhighly vulnerable inmates can be reasonably assured.  While the Warden is free to exercise \ndiscretion in choosing among equally effective measures to protect inmates from serious risks, \nchoosing inevitably inadequate measures to the exclusion of a plainly superior one constitutes \ndeliberate indifference.  See, e.g., Chance v. Armstrong, 143 F.3d 698, 703 (2d Cir. 1998) \n(“[M]ere disagreement over the proper treatment . . . does not create a constitutional claim . . . \n49 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 50 of 74\n[s]o long as the treatment given is adequate.”); id. (“In certain instances, a physician may be \ndeliberately indifferent if he or she consciously chooses an easier and less efficacious treatment \nplan.” (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); see also Greene v. Bowles, 361 F.3d \n290, 294 (6th Cir. 2004) (reasonable jury could find that putting prisoner into protective custody \nbut failing to protect her from a risk that persisted even in protective custody was \nunconstitutional). \nPut somewhat differently, even with the measures that the Warden has put in place, due \nto the impossibility of adequate social distancing, confinement at FCI Danbury—due to the very \nstructure of the facility—continues to pose a grave risk to vulnerable inmates’ health.  For this \nreason, Congress has provided statutory authority for, and the Attorney General has directed the \nwarden to “immediately” implement, the broad use of home confinement for vulnerable inmates.  \nUnder the circumstances of the present crisis, the Warden’s failure to make prompter, broader \nuse of this authority to protect the lives of vulnerable inmates is likely to constitute deliberate \nindifference. \n  In short, by failing to make meaningful use of her home confinement authority, the \nWarden has failed to implement what appears to be the sole measure capable of adequately \nprotecting vulnerable inmates—a measure the Attorney General directed the BOP to implement \n“immediately” and with “dispatch”—in favor of measures that, even if they were fully and \npainstakingly implemented, would still leave vulnerable inmates subject to a grave risk to their \nhealth.  Petitioners have thus shown a likelihood of success on the merits on their claim that, \nwith respect to the Medically Vulnerable Subclass, the Warden has disregarded a “substantial \n50 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 51 of 74\nrisk of serious harm” by “failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.”  Farmer, 511 U.S. at \n847.25 \nCompassionate Release under Section 3582(c)(1)(A) \nThe Warden has another source of authority she may use to remove medically vulnerable \ninmates from the dangerous environment at FCI Danbury, and at the same time reduce the \ndensity within the prison for all inmates.  Unfortunately, the record in this case makes clear she \nis not making adequate use of that authority either.  Specifically, neither the Warden nor the BOP \nas a whole is implementing Section 3582(c)(1)(A) in the way Congress intended when it adopted \nthe First Step Act, and neither has made any noticeable effort to update the process for \nevaluating “compassionate release” requests to take account of the COVID-19 pandemic.  For \nthe medically vulnerable inmates at FCI Danbury, this failure bolsters my conclusion that \nPetitioners have shown a likelihood of success on the merits on their claim that the Respondents \nare displaying deliberate indifference in violation of the Eighth Amendment. \nFirst, some history is in order.  Before the First Step Act was enacted in 2018, only the \nDirector of the Bureau of Prisons could file a motion with the sentencing court seeking \n“compassionate release” under Section 3582(c)(1)(A).  “The BOP rarely did so . . . .  From 1984 \nto 2013, an average of only 24 inmates were released each year through BOP-filed motions.”  \n \n25Respondents do not argue that the Warden’s hands were tied by BOP policy set by the BOP Director in setting the \ncriteria for home confinement at FCI Danbury—an argument that would easily have been available in this case \ngiven that Petitioners have named both the Warden and the Director as Respondents.  In any event, such an \nargument would not be dispositive, as a prison official does not comply with the Eighth Amendment when he or she \nknows of a serious risk to inmate safety but fails to address it due to mechanical reliance on prison policy.  See \nJohnson v. Wright, 412 F.3d 398, 404 (2d Cir. 2005) (reasonable jury could find that “the defendants here acted with \na sufficiently culpable state of mind in mechanically following [hepatitis C Guideline regarding substance abuse] \nand refusing to prescribe him [hepatitis C drug]”; “[t]he operative question in this case is not whether the Guideline's \nsubstance abuse policy is generally justifiable, but whether a jury could find that the application of the policy in \nplaintiff's case could have amounted to deliberate indifference to plaintiff's medical needs”; “there is no evidence \nsuggesting that the defendants took any step whatsoever to investigate—let alone verify—whether it would be \nmedically appropriate to ignore the unanimous advice of [plaintiff’s] treating physicians . . . and apply the \nGuideline’s substance abuse policy in [plaintiff’s] case.”).    \n51 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 52 of 74\nUnited States v. Rodriguez, 2020 WL 1627331, at *2 (E.D. Pa. April 1, 2020).  According to a \n2013 report of the Department of Justice’s Inspector General, these low numbers stemmed in \npart from poor management, a lack of clear standards, and inconsistent implementation of the \ncompassionate release program.  Id.  “In an effort to improve and increase the use of the \ncompassionate-release process, the First Step Act amended § 3852(c)(1)(A) to allow prisoners to \ndirectly petition courts for compassionate release, removing the BOP's exclusive ‘gatekeeper’ \nrole.”  Id.  The current version of the statute allows defendants to bring motions for release \nthemselves at the earlier of two occurrences: (1) the defendant’s “fully exhaust[ing] all \nadministrative rights to appeal a failure of the Bureau of Prisons to bring a motion on the \ndefendant’s behalf or [2] the lapse of 30 days from the receipt of such a request by the warden of \nthe defendant’s facility.”  18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A).   \nThe First Step Act left the BOP an important role in the process, as the defendant must \nstill exhaust his administrative remedies with the BOP before filing a motion in court.26 And \ngiven the statute’s specification of the timing for exhaustion—either the time needed for full \nexhaustion or the lapse of 30 days from receipt of the request by the warden, whichever is \nearlier—it appears that Congress assumed that sometimes the BOP would act on the request \nwithin 30 days of the Warden’s receipt of the request, and sometimes it would not.  Further, one \n \n26 There is a split among district courts within the Second Circuit as to whether the statute’s exhaustion requirement \nis mandatory, or whether it can be “waived” or excused by the district judge for reasons such as futility, irreparable \nharm, and similar equitable doctrines.  Compare United States v. Roberts, 2020 WL 1700032, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. April \n8, 2020) (“[T]he Court must abide by Congress’s choice, given Section 3582(c)’s clear command that the Court \n“may not” grant compassionate release except under the conditions Congress prescribed.”) with United States v. \nColvin, 2020 WL 1613943, at *2 (D. Conn. April 2, 2020) (“[I]n light of the urgency of Defendant’s request, the \nlikelihood that she cannot exhaust her administrative appeals during her remaining eleven days of imprisonment, \nand the potential for serious health consequences, the Court waives the exhaustion requirement of Section \n3582(c)(1)(A).”).  I have adopted the former position, finding that a defendant may not file a motion with the \nsentencing court until either he or she has exhausted the available administrative remedies or 30 days have lapsed \nfrom receipt of the request by the warden.  United States v. Nathaniel Smith, 2020 WL 1903160 (D. Conn. April 17, \n2020).   \n52 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 53 of 74\nmight assume that, after the 2013 Inspector General’s report and Congress’s reaction to it, the \nBOP would have built a better system for processing compassionate release requests \nadministratively.  Finally, one might assume that the BOP would have modified its internal \n“compassionate release” guidance to take account of the serious risk of severe illness or death \nfaced by medically vulnerable inmates housed in prisons with COVID-19 outbreaks.  \nUnfortunately, the record in this case belies all of these assumptions.  According to the Warden’s \ndeclaration, “since this emergency began” through May 4, 2020—a period that spans more than \n6 weeks since the Warden placed the prison on “modified operations” on March 19, ECF No. 24-\n2 at 10—the Reduction in Sentence Coordinator at FCI Danbury has received 241 requests for \ncompassionate release; of these, 136 have been processed and denied, 18 have been returned to \nthe inmate seeking further information, 70 are being reviewed by staff, and 17 “are awaiting” the \nWarden’s review.  ECF No. 24-2 at 27. \nThese figures are striking for two reasons.  First, the figures make clear that the FCI \nDanbury staff has, to date, not granted a single request for compassionate release—a batting \naverage that is dramatically less favorable to inmates than the frequency with which courts in \nthis District are granting Section 3582 motions.  ECF No. 24-2 at 52-54 (Government’s listing of \nrulings by District of Connecticut judges on COVID-based Section 3582(c)(1)(A) motions \nshowing that approximately 25 out of 48 have been granted, some with the Government’s \nconsent).27  This suggests that the Warden is setting an impossible high bar for these requests.28  \n \n27 Out of the 48, 7 involved inmates at Wyatt, which is a detention facility, albeit one that also houses sentenced \nprisoners immediately after sentencing.  Only two of the Wyatt detainees were released, according to the \nGovernment’s spreadsheet. ECF 24-2 at 52-54. The Bail Reform Act, rather than Section 3582(c)(1)(A), governs \nrelease as to detainees. \n28 Apparently, she is not the only one.  Information Petitioners filed on the docket concerning the handling of \nSection 3582 requests at BOP Elkton—which is under a court injunction in light of a COVID-19 outbreak there, see \nWilson v. Williams, 2020 WL 1940882 (N.D. Ohio April 22, 2020)—only confirms what appears to be the near-\nimpossible standard the BOP is applying to these requests.  According to a filing by the Government in the Wilson \n53 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 54 of 74\nAlternatively, it suggest that the Warden has not set a new standard for compassionate release in \nlight of the pandemic, but is applying an obsolete one that takes no account of the risk of illness \nor death to medically vulnerable inmates from COVID-19: As discussed above, the BOP’s \nJanuary 2019 policy statement makes no mention of COVID-19 or the risk posed by infectious \ndiseases inside prisons in general, and restricts use of “compassionate release” authority to a few, \nextreme situations that have little to do with susceptibility to COVID-19.  Respondents have not \nsuggested they have made any attempt to adjust the January 2019 standards for compassionate \nrelease to account for new “extraordinary and compelling” circumstances presented by COVID-\n19 in the prison setting. \nSecond, the figures suggest that the Warden is processing request for compassionate \nrelease based on COVID-19 at a pace that disregards the seriousness of the risk faced by \nmedically vulnerable inmates.  The figures show that over more than six weeks, FCI Danbury \nhas not made even an initial response to some 44% of compassionate release requests, justifying \nthe Petitioners’ assertion that the staff at the facility are “failing to timely respond to requests for \nemergency compassionate relief.”  Petition ¶ 119.  Further, an initial response from the \nWarden—when it arrives—is only the first step in a multi-tiered administrative remedy process \nthe inmate must follow to “fully exhaust[]” administrative remedies.  That process requires each \ninmate to appeal the denial by the Warden to a BOP Regional Director, followed by an appeal to \nthe BOP General Counsel.  28 C.F.R. § 571.63; 28 C.F.R. § 542.15.  For each level of appeal, the \ninmate must use a different form and mail it to a different reviewing official.  Id.  Even if the \ninmate’s request to the Warden is approved—something that has not happened at Danbury since \n \ncase, of 243 medically vulnerable inmates who have submitted a request for compassionate release to the warden at \nFCI Elkton, “[o]nly one inmate . . . met the criteria for compassionate release.”  ECF No. 26-4 at 4. \n54 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 55 of 74\nthe outset of the pandemic—that approval must go through at least three more layers of review \ninvolving the BOP General Counsel, the Medical Director or an Assistant Director, and, finally, \nthe Director.  28 C.F.R.§ 571.62.  It does not appear that the BOP has updated these regulations \nsince the First Step Act was passed, let alone made any attempt to suspend them or otherwise \naccelerate the process during the pandemic.   \nFrom all this it should be obvious that the BOP, from the Warden at FCI Danbury up \nthrough the Director, is not allowing—and, indeed, under its current regulations cannot allow—a \ndefendant to “fully exhaust[] all administrative rights to appeal a failure of the Bureau of \nPrisons” to bring a motion for compassionate release before the expiration of the 30 days \nspecified in the statute.  18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A).  So, as far as the record at FCI Danbury \nshows, it is practically impossible for a defendant to “fully exhaust” a compassionate release \nrequest within the BOP before expiration of the 30-day period, despite Congress’s apparent \nintent.  Further, it is, at least during the COVID-19 crisis at FCI Danbury, impossible to find any \nsuccess within the existing administrative remedy process; the applicable standards appear to \nmake no allowance for the grave risks posed by COVID-19, even for members of the Medically \nVulnerable Subclass, and the Warden indicates she has not approved for referral a single request.  \nThe 30-day period under the statute is simply dead time during which there is no prospect the \nBOP will come to the defendant’s aid.     \nAll of these circumstances support the order I issue today, which requires the Warden to \nprocess Section 3582 requests more promptly and requires her to explain why, apparently, no \nconsideration is being given in this process to the serious risk of illness or death posed to the \nmedically vulnerable subclass.   \n55 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 56 of 74\nWhile these circumstances might also support broader relief against the Director, the \nDirector is not a proper party in this case because he is not the immediate custodian of the \nPetitioners.  Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. at 434-35 (“The federal habeas statute straightforwardly \nprovides that the proper respondent to a habeas petition is ‘the person who has custody over [the \npetitioner].’  28 U.S.C. § 2242 . . . .  The consistent use of the definite article in reference to the \ncustodian indicates that there is generally only one proper respondent to a given prisoner’s \nhabeas petition . . . .  In accord with the statutory language . . . , longstanding practice confirms \nthat in habeas challenges to present physical confinement—‘core challenges’—the default rule is \nthat the proper respondent is the warden of the facility where the prisoner is being held, not the \nAttorney General or some other remote supervisory official.” (alteration in original)).  Thus, \nunless the Petitioners can provide a reason not to do so within 7 days of this order, I will dismiss \nthe 2241 Petition against the Director. \n* * * \nTo be clear, I am not suggesting that the Eighth Amendment requires the Warden to place \non home confinement or recommend for compassionate release every inmate who has a COVID-\n19 risk factor.  In Farmer, the Supreme Court held that “a prison official may be held liable \nunder the Eighth Amendment for denying humane conditions of confinement only if he knows \nthat inmates face a substantial risk of serious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take \nreasonable measures to abate it.”  511 U.S. at 847 (emphasis added).  Whether it is a \n“reasonable measure” to place an inmate on home confinement or grant compassionate release in \na particular case will depend on the severity of the risk faced by the inmate from COVID-19 in \nlight of his or her age and medical history, the danger the inmate presents to the residents of the \nhome environment under consideration, and the danger to the public at large.  The determination \n56 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 57 of 74\nmust be individualized, as the Petitioners acknowledged at oral argument, ECF No. 28 at 9, and, \nin some cases, such as where the inmate has a recent record of violence, may properly result in \ndenying home confinement or compassionate release even to inmates whose age or medical \nhistories place them at risk of serious injury or death from COVID-19.  But difficult as this \ndetermination may be, Petitioners have made a preliminary showing that, in these circumstances, \nthe Eighth Amendment requires that it be made promptly and that it focus on the critical issues \nof inmate and public safety. \nb.  Irreparable Harm \n“A showing of irreparable harm is the single most important prerequisite” for the \nissuance of a temporary restraining order.  Faiveley Transport Malmo AB v. Wabtec Corp., 559 \nF.3d 110, 118 (2d Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  To satisfy the \nirreparable harm requirement, the Petitioners must demonstrate that, absent a temporary \nrestraining order, “they will suffer an injury that is neither remote nor speculative, but actual and \nimminent, and one that cannot be remedied if a court waits until the end of trial to resolve the \nharm.”  Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \nA substantial risk of serious illness or death has often been found to constitute irreparable \nharm.  See, e.g., Innovative Health Systems, Inc. v. City of White Plains, 117 F.3d 37, 43-44 (2d \nCir. 1997) (finding irreparable harm where the closure of a treatment program would pose \nserious risk of harm to plaintiffs, including “death, illness or disability”); Shapiro v. Cadman \nTowers, Inc., 51 F.3d 328, 332-33 (2d Cir. 1995) (upholding District Court’s irreparable harm \nfinding based on the “risk of injury, infection, and humiliation”).   \nMore specifically, Courts across the country have concluded that the risk of contracting \nCOVID-19 as a result of unsafe conditions of confinement constitutes irreparable harm.  See, \n57 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 58 of 74\ne.g., Wilson v. Williams, 2020 WL 1940882, at *9 (N.D. Ohio Apr. 22, 2020) (finding that the \nrisk of exposure to COVID-19 at FCI Elkton—one of two other facilities that, like FCI Danbury, \nwere specifically identified by Attorney General Barr’s April 3 memo as experiencing significant \noutbreaks—constituted irreparable harm); Mays v. Dart, 2020 WL 1812381, at *13 (N.D. Ill. \nApr. 9, 2020) (The risk of “severe health consequences, including death, if they contract \ncoronavirus disease” constituted “irreparable harm.”); Basank v. Decker, 2020 WL 1481503, at \n*4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2020) (“The risk that Petitioners will face a severe, and quite possibly \nfatal, infection if they remain in immigration detention constitutes irreparable harm warranting a \nTRO.”). \nFCI Danbury is experiencing an active COVID-19 outbreak—one of the worst in the \nfederal prison system.  One inmate at the prison has already died as a result of contracting the \nvirus, and it is undisputed that members of the vulnerable subclass face a serious risk of meeting \nthe same fate should they contract the virus.  In light of the impossibility of instituting effective \nsocial distancing in the setting of a prison, like FCI Danbury, where inmates live and sleep in \nlarge dormitories lined with bunk beds, the grave risk to Petitioners persists despite the measures \nprison officials have taken to combat the virus. \nIn addition to the imminent prospect of serious physical harm, medically vulnerable \ninmates have alleged a violation of an important constitutional right—the right to be free from \ncruel and unusual punishment.  “In the Second Circuit, it is well-settled that an alleged \nconstitutional violation constitutes irreparable harm.”  Basank v. Decker, 2020 WL 1481503, at \n*4 (citing cases); Connecticut Dep’t of Envtl. Prot. v. O.S.H.A., 356 F.3d 226, 231 (2d Cir. 2004) \n(“[W]e have held that the alleged violation of a constitutional right triggers a finding of \nirreparable injury.” (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d \n58 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 59 of 74\n468, 482 (2d Cir. 1996) (“[T]he alleged violation of a constitutional right . . . triggers a finding \nof irreparable harm.” (emphasis original)).  Thus, the alleged violation of subclass members’ \nconstitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment itself constitutes “irreparable \nharm.” \nIn short, Subclass Members easily satisfy the irreparable harm prerequisite for issuing a \ntemporary restraining order. \nc.  Balance of the Equities and the Public Interest \n“Where the Government is the opposing party, the final two factors in the temporary \nrestraining order analysis—the balance of the equities and the public interest—merge.”  Coronel \nv. Decker, 2020 WL 1487274, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2020) (citing Planned Parenthood of \nNew York City, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 337 F. Supp. 3d 308, 343 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2018)). \nAs an initial matter, “the public interest is best served by ensuring the constitutional \nrights of persons within the United States are upheld.”  Coronel, 2020 WL 1487274, at *7 \n(quoting Sajous v. Decker, 2018 WL 2357266, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. 2018)); see also Doe v. \nUniversity of Connecticut, 2020 WL 406356, at *6 (D. Conn. Jan. 23, 2020) (noting the “public \ninterest in avoiding violations of constitutional rights”); Barbecho v. Decker, 2020 WL 1876328, \nat *7 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 15, 2020); G & V Lounge, Inc. v. Michigan Liquor Control Com’n, 23 F.3d \n1071, 1079 (6th Cir. 1994) (“[I]t is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a \nparty’s constitutional rights.”). \n  Moreover, the Petitioners’ interest in avoiding serious illness or death must weigh heavily \non the scales.  While I am not unmindful of the unprecedented challenges faced by the Warden in \ncombatting the COVID-19 pandemic, not to mention the challenges of operating a prison—\n59 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 60 of 74\nincluding maintaining order and discipline, maintaining health and safety, and achieving the \nprison’s penological and rehabilitative objectives—under even the best of circumstances, and \nwhile I approach imposing additional duties on her at this time with great hesitation, the burdens \nfaced by the Warden must yield to medically vulnerable inmates’ interest in avoiding serious \nillness or death, as well as the public’s interest in seeing those inmates’ constitutional rights \nvindicated. \n  Respondents argue that an assessment of the public interest also requires individualized \nconsideration of an inmate’s suitability for release, taking into account the safety of the inmate, \nhis or her family, and the public.  I agree, and the order I issue today mandates such \nindividualized consideration, albeit on a basis more accelerated and more focused on the critical \nfactors of inmate and public safety than the current home confinement review process at FCI \nDanbury.   \n3.  Safety Measures \nWith respect to the broader putative class, the Petitioners argue that the Warden has \nfailed to institute the measures necessary to prevent the continued spread of COVID-19 at FCI \nDanbury and to protect inmates from infection.  Aside from the Warden’s use of home \nconfinement and compassionate release to protect medically vulnerable patients and reduce the \npopulation at FCI Danbury, which is addressed above, the Petitioners argue that the Warden has \nfurther failed to (1) adequately screen inmates for COVID-19 symptoms, (2) test symptomatic \ninmates, (3) isolate infected patients, (4) quarantine patients thought to have been exposed, (5) \nimplement adequate social distancing, (6) observe proper sanitation measures, (7) provide staff \nand inmates with adequate personal protective equipment, soap, and sanitizers, and (8) provide \nadequate medical care to inmates with COVID-19 as well as other medical conditions.  But while \n60 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 61 of 74\nthe salient facts regarding the Warden’s use of her home confinement and compassionate release \nauthority are generally undisputed, factual disputes abound with respect to the Petitioners’ other \nallegations.  For example, while Petitioners contend that prison officials “willfully refused to \ntake temperatures or test for fever in order to avoid identifying cases of possible COVID \ninfection,” ECF No. 1 ¶ 132, the Warden claims that “[t]his could not be further from the truth,” \nand that, since April 9, 2020, FCI Danbury has conducted daily temperature checks for all \ninmates.  ECF No. 24-2 at 24.  Similarly, while Petitioners contend that symptomatic patients are \nnot being tested appropriately, the Warden maintains that “[a]ny inmate at FCI Danbury \npresenting with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 is immediately evaluated by a medical \nprovider to determine whether testing and/or isolation is appropriate.”  ECF No. 24-2 at 2.  And \nwhile Petitioners claim that the use of personal protective equipment such as masks has been \ninconsistent and is not enforced, the Warden indicates that both staff and inmates are required to \nwear face masks and are provided with personal protective equipment as appropriate.  Id. at 15. \nThese factual disputes preclude me from concluding at this stage that the Warden’s \nimplementation of measures to protect against the spread of COVID-19 exhibits deliberate \nindifference to the serious risks posed by the virus, and thus that the Petitioners are likely to \nsucceed on the merits of this portion of their claim.  It is well established that “[t]he existence of \nfactual disputes necessitates an evidentiary hearing . . . before a motion for preliminary \ninjunction may be decided.” Kern v. Clark, 331 F.3d 9, 12 (2d Cir. 2003) (internal quotation \nmarks and citations omitted).  Perhaps recognizing the conflicting factual record on mitigation \nand safety measures, the Petitioners submitted a proposed order following oral argument, ECF \nNo. 26-1, that does not include an order directing the Warden to implement the various measures \nat issue (again, most of which the Warden contends she is already implementing).  I thus deny \n61 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 62 of 74\nthe Petitioner’s request for a temporary restraining order to the extent that it asks the Court to \ndirect the Warden to implement safety measures and report to the Court on the status of those \nmeasures. \nC.  The Propriety of Multi-Party Treatment \nAlthough the Second Circuit has “conclude[d] that the class action device should not be \nimported into collateral actions, at least in its full vigor as contemplated by Rule 23,” it has \nrecognized “the power of the judiciary . . . to fashion for habeas actions appropriate modes of \nprocedure, by analogy to existing rules or otherwise in conformity with judicial usage.”  U.S. ex \nrel. Sero v. Preiser, 506 F.2d 1115, 1125 (2d Cir. 1974).  In Preiser, the court allowed “a multi-\nparty proceeding similar to the class action” on behalf of young adults serving misdemeanor \nsentences, largely because the petitioners’ claims were “applicable on behalf of the entire class” \nand “uncluttered by subsidiary issues.”  Id. at 1126.  The Court noted several other “persuasive \njustifications” for affording class action treatment, including that “many of those serving \nreformatory sentences are likely to be illiterate or poorly educated,” “most would not have the \nbenefit of counsel to prepare habeas corpus petitions,” and “considerable expenditure of judicial \ntime and energy in hearing and deciding numerous individual petitions presenting the identical \nissue is thereby avoided.”  Id.  Noting that “the precise provisions of Rule 23 are not applicable \nto these proceedings,” the Court nonetheless found that consideration of the four Rule 23(a) \nprerequisites further bolstered its conclusion that class treatment was appropriate. Id.  The \napproach laid out by the Preiser court is, in short, both flexible and sensitive to the particular \ncircumstances of a given case.   \nIn any event, I need not make a formal determination as to class certification—or, more \nprecisely, as to whether a multi-party proceeding analogous to a class action is appropriate.  “It is \n62 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 63 of 74\nwell established that ‘[c]ertain circumstances give rise to the need for prompt injunctive relief for \na named plaintiff or on behalf of a class’  and that the ‘court may conditionally certify the class \nor otherwise award a broad preliminary injunction, without a formal class ruling, under its \ngeneral equity powers.’”  Strouchler v. Shah, 891 F. Supp. 2d 504, 517 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting \nAlba Conte & Herbert Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions § 9:45 (4th Ed.2002)).  Thus, in \nStrouchler, the court “[p]reliminarily examin[ed] plaintiffs’ entitlement to class status,” \nconcluded that “it is likely that plaintiffs will be able to meet the Rule 23 prerequisites of \nnumerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy” as well as the requirements of Rule \n23(b)(2), and granted in part plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction.  Id. at 518-19; see also \nLaForest v. Former Clean Air Holding Co., Inc., 376 F.3d 48, 58 (2d Cir. 2004) (finding that the \nDistrict Court did not abuse its discretion in issuing a preliminary injunction prior to class \ncertification and in reliance on representative evidence of irreparable harm).  By analogy to this \nestablished practice in the class action context, I need only determine at this stage whether multi-\nparty treatment is likely to be appropriate. \nMoreover, the scope of my inquiry as to multi-party treatment need not extend beyond \nthe scope of the claim addressed by this ruling and the temporary restraining order I issue.  I \nhave concluded above that the Petitioners, as medically vulnerable inmates, have shown that they \nare likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the Warden’s implementation of her home \nconfinement and compassionate release authority violates their constitutional rights.  I have \nfurther found that they face irreparable harm should preliminary relief not be granted, and that \nissuing a temporary restraining order is in the public interest.  The injunction I issue below \ndirects the Warden to make prompt, meaningful use of her home confinement and compassionate \nrelease authority; expeditiously to consider all medically vulnerable inmates for home \n63 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 64 of 74\nconfinement and compassionate release; and to discontinue the use of unduly burdensome \neligibility criteria that are divorced from the interests of vulnerable inmates as well as the public \nand that preclude otherwise eligible inmates from consideration.  At this stage, I need only \nconsider, on a provisional basis, whether multi-party treatment is likely appropriate as to this \nclaim and the associated relief.29  \nI find that, as in Preiser, the claim as to which I now grant preliminary relief—that the \nWarden’s implementation of her home confinement and compassionate release authority violates \nthe constitutional rights of medically vulnerable inmates—is plainly “applicable on behalf of the \nentire [subclass]” and “uncluttered by subsidiary issues.”  Id.  It is the Warden’s existing process \nas applied to medically vulnerable inmates that amounts to deliberate indifference—a process \nthat applies to the entire subclass, as evidenced, for example, by the single set of home \nconfinement criteria published by the Warden.  See ECF Nos. 15-7, 15-8.  I do not rule on the \npropriety of the Warden’s determination as to any particular inmate; thus, the fact that these \ndeterminations will likely require at least some degree of individualized inquiry does not destroy \nthe common questions inherent in the claims under consideration. \nOther considerations also counsel in favor of a multi-party proceeding at this stage.  As in \nPreiser, the majority of the vulnerable inmates would be unlikely to have the benefit of counsel \nin pursuing individual habeas petitions absent a multi-party proceeding.  Similarly, multi-party \ntreatment avoids the “considerable expenditure of judicial time and energy in hearing and \ndeciding numerous individual petitions presenting the identical issue,” Preiser, 506 F.2d at 1126.  \n \n29 Should I later find that other claims, issues, or forms of relief the Petitioners are pursuing are inappropriate for \nmulti-party, representative treatment, I see no reason why, for example, I could not employ an analogue to issue \ncertification under Rule 23(c)(4).  Thus, I need not determine whether all claims, issues, and forms of relief in this \ncase are appropriate for multi-party treatment in this ruling. \n64 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 65 of 74\nFurthermore, because the present ruling addresses the constitutionality of the processes \nemployed by the Warden—processes that, in the interest of fairness, efficiency, and accuracy, \nmust be uniform—individual adjudication, and the conflicting directives it would likely generate, \nwould unduly burden the Warden and interfere with the fair and efficient operation of the home \nconfinement and compassionate release programs, thus undermining the very constitutional \ninterests Petitioners seek to vindicate. \nConsideration of the Rule 23(a) prerequisites further bolsters my conclusion that multi-\nparty treatment is likely appropriate.  According to the Government, there are 984 inmates at FCI \nDanbury.  ECF No. 2401 at 14.  At FCI Elkton, a facility with 2,368 inmates,30 Petitioners \nindicate that the BOP identified 837 medically vulnerable prisoners.  ECF No. 26 at 3.  If a \nsimilar proportion of inmates at FCI Danbury are medically vulnerable, that would mean the \nputative Medically Vulnerable Subclass consists of roughly 350 inmates.  This would easily \nsatisfy Rule 23’s numerosity requirement.31  I also find that, even applying the “more stringent \nstandards” alluded to by the Preiser court, 506 F.2d at 1127, commonality is likewise satisfied.  \nFacts regarding the process employed by the Warden in considering inmates for home \nconfinement and compassionate release are common to the entire putative subclass, as are the \nlegal questions regarding whether the Warden’s handling of those processes in these \ncircumstances is constitutional.  And while members of the putative class may vary in terms of \nthe severity of their COVID-19 risk factors, all are recognized as falling in the high-risk group as \nto which heightened precautions are justified.32  Typicality is similarly satisfied; because the \n \n30 FCI Elkton, BOP.gov, https://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/elk (last visited May 10, 2020). \n31 See Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Town of Hyde Park, 47 F.3d 473, 483 (2d Cir.1995) (holding that “numerosity is \npresumed at a level of 40 members”) and Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 935 (2d Cir.1993) (courts do not require \n“evidence of exact class size or identity of class members to satisfy the numerosity requirement”). \n32 Petitioners and Respondents jointly propose that the Medically Vulnerable Subclass be defined as follows: \n65 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 66 of 74\nprocess at issue is applicable to all inmates, “each member’s claim arises from the same course \nof events,”—the establishment and operation of this process—\"and each class member makes \nsimilar legal arguments to prove the defendant’s liability.”  In re Flag Telecom Holdings, Ltd. \nSecurities Litigation, 574 F.3d 29, 35 (2d Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks and citations \nomitted); see also Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 937 (2d Cir. 1993) (“Evidence indicating \nthe employer discriminated in the same general fashion against the class representatives and \nagainst other members of the class was held sufficient to satisfy the typicality requirement.” \n(citing Rossini v. Ogilvy & Mather, Inc., 798 F.2d 590, 596-98 (2d Cir. 1986))).  Finally, \nPetitioners are represented by experienced and qualified counsel, and there is no reason to think \nthat the named petitioners are inadequate representatives of the class, thus satisfying the \nadequacy requirement.  \nIn short, I conclude that the Petitioners are likely to show that proceeding on a multi-\nparty basis with respect to the claim at issue is appropriate, and thus that injunctive relief as to \nthe medically vulnerable subclass is appropriate at this stage. \nD.  The Government’s Rule 12(b)(6) Motion \nIn deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court must determine whether \nthe plaintiff has alleged “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell \n \nAll individuals in custody at FCI Danbury, while the threat of COVID-19 at the facility remains, who are \naged 65 or over and/or who have any of the following conditions specifically identified by the United \nStates Centers for Disease Control as putting them at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19: (a) \nchronic lung disease including moderate to severe asthma, COPD, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, \nidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and/or cystic fibrosis; (b) immunocompromised status, including status as a \ntransplant recipient, on chemotherapy, HIV positive, prolonged use of corticosteroids, using \nimmunosuppressive medication, and/or having an immune deficiency; (c) severe obesity (BMI of 40 or \nhigher); (d) diabetes mellitus Type I or Type II, (e) gestational diabetes mellitus; (f) chronic kidney disease \non dialysis; (g) chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis; and/or serious heart conditions, including congestive heart \nfailure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, and/or pulmonary hypertension. \nECF No. 26 at 2. \n66 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 67 of 74\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  “A claim has facial plausibility when the \npleaded content allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for \nthe misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 566 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal quotation marks \nand citations omitted).  In considering such a motion, the court must construe the complaint \nliberally, “accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable \ninferences in the plaintiff’s favor.”  Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir. \n2002).  To survive a motion to dismiss, “[a]fter the court strips away conclusory allegations, \nthere must remain sufficient well-pleaded factual allegations to nudge plaintiff’s claims across \nthe line from conceivable to plausible.”  In re Fosamax Products Liab. Litig., 2010 WL 1654156, \nat *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 9, 2010).  “When a complaint is based solely on wholly conclusory \nallegations and provides no factual support for such claims, it is appropriate to grant \ndefendants[’] motion to dismiss.”  Scott v. Town of Monroe, 306 F. Supp. 2d 191, 198 (D. Conn. \n2004). \nWith respect to the Petitioners’ claim that the Warden’s failure to make prompt, \nmeaningful use of her home confinement and compassionate release authority constitutes \ndeliberate indifference under the Eighth Amendment, I have found that the Petitioners’ claim is \nnot only plausible, but is likely to succeed on the merits.   \nThe Petitioners have also plausibly alleged that the Warden has failed to implement \nadequate measures to prevent the continued spread of COVID-19 at the prison, in violation of the \nPetitioners’ Eighth Amendment rights.  The Petitioners have plausibly alleged that they face a \ngrave risk of serious illness or death due to COVID-19, see, e.g., Petition ¶¶ 25-34 (listing \nPetitioners’ medical conditions rendering them particularly vulnerable to COVID-19), ¶¶ 56-76 \n(describing why prisons are particularly susceptible to outbreaks of COVID-19), and thus that \n67 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 68 of 74\nthey are “incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm,” Farmer, 511 \nU.S. at 834, satisfying the objective component of the deliberate indifference analysis.  The \nprisoners have further plausibly alleged that prison officials “kn[ew] of and disregard[ed] an \nexcessive risk to inmate health or safety,” Brock, 315 F.3d at 164.  Petitioners have alleged, for \nexample, that instead of screening inmates for COVID-19 in good faith, so that symptomatic \npatients can be tested and, if necessary, isolated, prison officials have “falsely discounted the \nreadings of elevated temperatures in order to avoid taking appropriate follow-up action.”  \nPetition ¶ 132.  While the Warden contests this account, I must accept the Petitioners allegations \nas true for the purposes of this motion.  Similarly, Petitioners allege that on April 24, a woman at \nthe satellite prison exhibiting serious symptoms was ignored by correctional staff and left among \nthe general population for hours, despite the urgings of the other prisoners, before finally being \ntaken to the hospital where she tested positive for COVID-19.  Petition ¶ 54.  The Petitioners \nfurther allege that prison officials threatened retaliation against any inmate who told anyone on \nthe outside about this incident.  Id.  These and other allegations—which I must accept as true for \nthe purposes of this motion—satisfy the subjective component of the deliberate indifference \nstandard. \nFor the above reasons, the Government’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss is DENIED. \nV.  RELIEF \nFor the reasons discussed above, I grant in part and deny in part Petitioners’ motion for \ntemporary restraining order and issue the orders set forth below.  The temporary restraining order \nthat follows is aimed at accelerating the process for evaluating inmates for home confinement \nand compassionate release, and focusing that process on achieving a “reasonable” balance \nbetween the risks to inmate safety and the risks to public safety.  See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 847. \n   \n68 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 69 of 74\nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n1.  Within 3 days of this order, Respondent Warden (the “Respondent”) shall file on the \ndocket, under seal, a list of “medically vulnerable inmates at Danbury FCI,” consisting, \nmore specifically, of the following:   \nAll individuals in custody at FCI Danbury who are aged 65 or over and/or who \nhave any of the following conditions specifically identified by the United States \nCenters for Disease Control as putting them at higher risk for severe illness from \nCOVID-19: (a) chronic lung disease including moderate to severe asthma, COPD, \nemphysema, chronic bronchitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and/or cystic \nfibrosis; (b) immunocompromised status, including status as a transplant \nrecipient, on chemotherapy, HIV positive, prolonged use of corticosteroids, using \nimmunosuppressive medication, and/or having an immune deficiency; (c) severe \nobesity (BMI of 40 or higher); (d) diabetes mellitus Type I or Type II, (e) \ngestational diabetes mellitus; (f) chronic kidney disease on dialysis; (g) chronic \nliver diseases, cirrhosis; and/or (g) serious heart conditions, including congestive \nheart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, \nand/or pulmonary hypertension. \na.  Within 1 day of this order, counsel for petitioners and respondents shall confer \nwith each other (to the extent they have not already done so) about how to \nidentify promptly the inmates who fit the criteria listed above, including, if \nfeasible, through the use of ICD codes, as discussed during the recent \nteleconference; \n69 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 70 of 74\nb.  The list referred to in paragraph 1 shall include the identity of the inmate, the \ninmate’s sentencing court, and the case number of the inmate’s underlying \ncriminal conviction but shall not include information about the specific medical \ncondition suffered by each inmate;  \nc.  The list referred to in paragraph 1 shall be organized by facility within Danbury \nFCI (i.e., one list for the men’s facility, one list for the women’s satellite prison, \nand one list for the women’s camp) \nd.  The list shall indicate, as to each inmate, whether that inmate (a) has submitted a \nrequest for compassionate release under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), and (b) has \nbeen reviewed for home confinement since March 26, 2020, and if so, whether the \ninmate has been designated for home confinement. \ne.  If compiling the information described in paragraph  1d. will significantly delay \nthe creation and filing of a list setting forth just the information described in \nparagraphs 1, 1b., and 1c., then the Respondents may initially, within 3 days of \nthis order, file a list including only the information set forth in paragraphs 1, 1b., \nand 1c., and then, within 7 days of this order, file a second version of the list \nincluding all of the information described in paragraphs 1 and 1b.-1d.   \nf.  Respondent shall provide the list to Petitioners’ counsel, and the list shall be \nmarked “Confidential-Attorneys’ Eyes Only” and be treated accordingly under \nthe Protective Order entered in this case, ECF No. 9. \ng.  Respondent shall file on the docket with the list a declaration setting forth the \nprocess used to identify those persons described in paragraph 1, including a \ndescription of the databases searched. \n70 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 71 of 74\n2.  Within 3 days of this order, Respondent shall: \na.  Finalize and implement a process that makes full and speedy use of the home \nconfinement authority under 18 U.S.C. § 3624(b) and the CARES Act and, as \ndirected by the Attorney General’s April 3, 2020 Memorandum, “immediately \nmaximize[s] appropriate transfers to home confinement [for] all appropriate \ninmates held at . . . FCI Danbury,” in particular, by (a) prioritizing for review for \nhome confinement all inmates identified on the list described in paragraph 1, (b) \nassigning substantial weight in that review to the inmate’s risk factors for \nCOVID-19 based on CDC guidance, (c) eliminating all requirements that the \ninmate have served some portion of his or her sentence to be eligible for \nplacement on home confinement, (d) eliminating the requirement that a “primary \nor prior offense” not be a violent offense; (e) eliminating the requirement that the \ninmate be “without incident reports in the past 12 months (regardless of severity \nlevel)”; (f) modifying any requirement that a person approved for home \nconfinement be quarantined at the facility for 14 days to allow for immediate \nrelease to home confinement for those inmates as to whom Respondent verifies, \nafter reasonable inquiry, that the inmate is not showing symptoms and is able to \nself-isolate for the same period in the home confinement setting.33     \n \n33 By “eliminating” particular “requirements,” I do not mean to suggest that these considerations are irrelevant to the \nWarden’s assessment of the appropriateness of home confinement for a particular inmate.  To the contrary, a \nparticular inmate’s violent history, for example, is obviously relevant to the assessment of the danger his or her \nrelease might pose to the public and thus should be accorded weight in the determination.  The purpose of \neliminating these and other categorical exclusions is to make the process more individualized and more amenable to \na proper and reasonable balancing of inmate safety and public safety. \n71 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 30   Filed 05/12/20   Page 72 of 74\nb.

Publish to inmates the factors to be considered in the revised home confinement \nreview process developed by the Warden in accordance with this order. \n3.  Within 7 days of this order, Respondent shall: \na.  Provide written notice of either (a) a referral of the matter in writing with \nrecommendation of approval of the request, 28 C.F.R. § 571.62, or (b) a denial of \nthe request, together with the appropriate appeal form, 28 C.F.R. §§ 571.63, \n542.15, to each inmate described in paragraph 1 (or, if that is not administratively \nfeasible, to each inmate) who has made a written request for compassionate \nrelease based on COVID-19 under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A) but has not yet \nreceived a decision. \nb.  Finalize and implement a process whereby each inmate described in paragraph 1 \n(or, if that is not administratively feasible, each inmate) who makes a written \nrequest for compassionate release based on COVID-19 receives notice of either \nthe referral of their request, with a recommendation of approval, or its denial, with \nthe appropriate appeal form, within 7 days of the date the request is received by a \nmember of the Danbury FCI staff. \nc.

Within 13 days of this order, as to each person described in paragraph 1, the Respondent \nWarden shall complete the home confinement review process described in paragraph 2a. \nand shall either (a) approve such person for home confinement and (i) place him or her on  \nhome confinement or (ii) place him or her in quarantine within the facility for 14 days \nbefore placing him or her on  home confinement, or (b) deny such person home \nconfinement.  \n5.  Within 13 days of this order, the Respondent Warden shall provide to the Court (under \nseal) an individualized explanation for each denial of home confinement as to an inmate \ndescribed in paragraph 1, including at least a brief description of the factual basis for any \nfactors deemed to outweigh the danger to the inmate from COVID-19, and shall show \ncause why each such inmate should not be transferred to another facility within the BOP \nwhere adequate social distancing is possible. \n6.  Within 13 days of this order, Respondent shall file a status report describing her efforts to \ncomply with this order.   \n7.

The class of inmates \nrecently filed a motion to enforce this provision of the settlement agreement on behalf of 17 \ninmates who were approved by the BOP for release to home confinement more than 14 days \nbefore the filing of the motion—some as long as three months before.  ECF No. 263.  On \nDecember 11, 2020, after considering the submissions of the parties and hearing oral argument \nduring a telephonic status conference, I granted the motion, ordered that the 17 inmates be \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 2 of 26\nreleased by Saturday, December 12, 2020 at 5:00 p.m., and, going forward, limited the \npermissible reasons for which the Warden and the BOP could delay the release of inmates to \nhome confinement beyond 14 days from the date they are approved for home confinement.  ECF \nNo. 289.  On December 14, 2020, I also ordered that one of the 17 inmates whose proposed place \nof home confinement was no longer available be released under the BOP’s furlough authority to \nthe care of class counsel.  ECF No. 294.  I noted in my December 11 and 14 orders that I would \nlater issue an opinion to provide a more fulsome explanation of the reasons for those orders.  \nThis is that opinion.  In short, as explained below, the Warden and the BOP delayed transferring \nthe 17 inmates to home confinement for reasons that do not comport with their promise to \n“endeavor” to effectuate those transfers within 14 days, and the December 11 and 14 orders were \nnecessary to realize that promise.   \nI.  BACKGROUND \nI assume familiarity with the factual and procedural background of this case as set forth \nin the Ruling on Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 30, \nand with the parties’ submissions relating to the class’s motion to enforce the Settlement \nAgreement.  See ECF Nos. 263-74, 277-87.  I recount the background here only as necessary to \nexplain the December 11 and 14 orders. \nOn July 27, 2020, the parties entered into a Settlement Agreement resolving all claims \nbrought by Petitioner, James Whitted, individually and on behalf of members of a proposed \nclass, against the Respondent, Diane Easter, in her official capacity as the Warden of FCI \nDanbury and the BOP.  ECF No. 238-1 at 2.  On August 11, 2020, on motion of the parties, I \ncertified the following Settlement Class (“Medically Vulnerable Class” or “Settlement Class”): \nany person incarcerated at FCI Danbury anytime from the Effective Date of the parties’ \nSettlement Agreement, i.e., July 27, 2020, until the termination date of the Agreement, \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 3 of 26\ni.e., October 31, 2021, unless otherwise modified by the parties pursuant to the terms of \nthe Agreement, who either (a) is a List One Inmate or List Two Inmate (as those terms \nare defined in the Settlement Agreement, ECF No. [238-1] at 3-4), or (b) possesses one or \nmore underlying medical conditions which, according to current CDC guidance (i.e., the \nCDC guidance in effect at the time of the individual’s home confinement review), either \n(i) places that inmate at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 (“Tier 1 medical \nconditions”); or (ii) might place that inmate at an increased risk of severe illness from \nCOVID-19 (“Tier 2 medical conditions”). \n \nECF No. 141 at 2-3.  I ordered the distribution of notice to the settlement class and scheduled a \nfairness hearing for September 18, 2020 to consider final approval of the Settlement Agreement.  \nId. at 7-8.  At the September 18, 2020 fairness hearing, I approved the Settlement Agreement, \nECF No. 221; I later dismissed the case, expressly retaining jurisdiction to the full extent \nnecessary to enforce the terms of the Settlement Agreement , ECF No. 241.1 \n  As pertinent here, the Settlement Agreement sets forth standards and procedures for \nconducting home confinement reviews for members of the Settlement Class2 and a multi-tiered \ndispute resolution procedure that culminates in judicial intervention.  See ECF No. 238-1.  The \ndispute presented by the class’s motion to enforce arises from paragraph 11, which provides as \nfollows:  \nBOP will endeavor to release individuals approved for home confinement to home \nconfinement within 14 days of the approval decision unless public safety or the absence \nof any home in which to place the inmate would make it unsafe to move the inmate to \n \n1 I have ancillary jurisdiction over the Petitioner’s motion to enforce the settlement agreement because, upon \ndismissal, I \n \nreserve[d] and retain[ed] jurisdiction over the parties and this case to the full extent necessary to enforce the \nterms of the Settlement pursuant to the terms set forth therein (ECF No. 238-1).  See Kokkonen v. Guardian \nLife Insurance Co. of America, 511 U.S. 375, 381 (1994); In re American Express Financial Advisors \nSecurities Litigation, 672 F.3d 113, 134 (2d Cir. 2011).  The Settlement Agreement (ECF No. 238-1) is \nhereby incorporated in this order by reference. \n \nECF No. 241; see also Meetings & Expositions, Inc. v. Tandy Corp., 490 F.2d 714, 717 (2d Cir. 1974) (“A district \ncourt has the power to enforce summarily, on motion, a settlement agreement reached in a case that was pending \nbefore it.”).  \n \n2 These standards incorporated those set forth in the May 12, 2020 temporary restraining order.  See ECF No. 238-1 \n¶¶ 2, 3, 6, 10, 11; see also ECF No. 30 at 71.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 4 of 26\nhome confinement within that 14 day period.   \n \nId. at 11-12.  Where, as here, the parties are unable to resolve a dispute and seek judicial \nintervention, “the sole remedy shall be specific performance of th[e] Agreement.”  Id. at 16.   \n  In the motion to enforce, the class alleged that 17 inmates had been approved for home \nconfinement but that each of them was being held at FCI Danbury for more than 14 days without \na permissible reason under the Settlement Agreement, i.e., without a public safety reason or the \nlack of a home in which to place the inmate.  ECF No. 263 at 1.  At the time of filing, December \n6, 2020, these inmates had been waiting to be released on home confinement, after having been \napproved for such release, for between 273 and 104 days.  ECF Nos. 265, 282.  The class also \nfiled supporting declarations from four of these 17 inmates, all of whom expressed a fear of \ncontracting COVID-19 at FCI Danbury, as well as two other FCI Danbury inmates.  See ECF \nNos. 272, 273, 274, 284, 285, 279-3.  All six declarations observe a recent spike in COVID-19 \ncases at FCI Danbury.  See ECF No. 272 (observing at least five positive COVID-19 test results \nin the women’s camp, but none on her “quarantine floor”); ECF No. 273 (noting the recent \noutbreak at FCI Danbury); ECF No. 274 (noting the recent outbreak at FCI Danbury); ECF No. \n284 (noting at least four positive COVID-19 tests in the women’s camp on Monday, December \n7, 2020); ECF No. 285 (noting at least two positive COVID-19 tests, and one symptomatic \ninmate, in the FSL between December 6 and 7, 2020); ECF No. 279-3 (this inmate, who is seven \nmonths’ pregnant, noted at least five COVID-19 positive tests at the women’s camp in the past \n \n3 In the motion to enforce, class counsel identified one inmate, M.D., who had been waiting 16 days, but indicated \nthat this date was uncertain because it was only based on the date class counsel received the approval packet and \nwas not necessarily the actual date of approval.  ECF No. 265.  In the Warden’s declaration, she clarifies that this \ninmate was approved for home confinement on 11/9/2020, not on 11/20/2020—the date class counsel received \nM.D.’s home confinement approval packet.  ECF No. 281 at 7 ¶ 24.  As a result, M.D. had been waiting for 27 days \nas of December 6, 2020, not 16 days. \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 5 of 26\nweek, including one symptomatic inmate whose bed is three feet away from her own).4  Four of \nthe six declarations also observe a gap in BOP staff’s checking of inmates’ temperatures and \nCOVID-19 symptoms.  See ECF No. 273 (no temperature or symptom checks between before \nThanksgiving and December 7, 2020); ECF No. 284 (no temperature or symptom checks from \nNovember 23 to December 7, 2020); ECF No. 285 (noting that temperature and symptom checks \nwere conducted on December 7, 2020, and that everyone at the FSL was tested for COVID-19 on \nthe same day; this inmate recalls that temperature and symptom checks were conducted four \ntimes in the month prior to December 7); ECF No. 279-3 (noting a gap in temperature and \nsymptom checks, which started again on December 7, 2020 at the women’s camp).   \nEach of the four declarations from inmates approved for home confinement describes a \nprolonged waiting or quarantine period beyond fourteen days:   \n•  J.H., an inmate at the women’s camp, was approved for home confinement on \nSeptember 21, 2020.  She had been in quarantine for 20 days as of December 9, \n2020, was tested for COVID-19 three times, and—based on her projected release \ndate of December 17—would have been in quarantine for a full month prior to \nrelease.  J.H. is able to isolate at her place of home confinement, a friend’s home \nin Mississippi.  See ECF Nos. 272, 282 at 4.  \n•  M.R., an inmate at the women’s camp, was approved for home confinement on \nOctober 5, 2020.  She was scheduled to be released to home confinement on \nDecember 5, 2020 but was placed in quarantine on December 8, 2020, and her \nrelease was delayed until January 5, 2021.  ECF Nos. 273, 282 at 4-5.  \n \n4 As of December 21, 2020, the BOP’s COVID-19 webpage reported a total of 95 active infections among a \npopulation of 862 inmates.  https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/; https://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/dan/ \n(both last visited on December 21, 2020).  This is a sharp increase from the report of 30 active inmate infections on \nDecember 6, when the motion to enforce was filed. \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 6 of 26\n•   N.L., an inmate at the women’s camp, was approved for home confinement on \nOctober 5, 2020.  She was placed in quarantine on December 1, 2020 and was \ntested for COVID-19 on December 1 and 8.  N.L.’s scheduled release date was \nDecember 22, 2020.  ECF Nos. 274, 282 at 4.  \n•  W.H., an inmate at the women’s camp, was approved for home confinement on \nAugust 24, 2020.  She was scheduled to be released to home confinement on \nDecember 29, 2020, and was placed in quarantine on December 8.  W.H. received \na COVID-19 PCR test before entering quarantine and a rapid test after she entered \nquarantine.  ECF No. 282 at 4, 284.   \nThe class also provided a chart that includes the home confinement approval date, the number of \ndays waiting, and the expected home confinement release date of each of the 17 inmates.  ECF \nNo. 265; see also ECF No. 282 (an updated version of the same chart produced by the \nRespondent). \n  Before the filing of the motion to enforce, Warden Easter wrote a letter, ECF No. 267, to \nrespond to concerns about these delays being raised by class counsel.  The letter, dated \nDecember 1, 2020, was written in response to a letter from class counsel dated November 23, \n2020, and provides an explanation for the delay in releasing 12 inmates who had been approved \nfor home confinement.  ECF No. 267 at 2.  Warden Easter explains as follows: \nAs a general matter, several circumstances have converged to create challenges to \nredesignating inmates to HC within 14 days of being approved.  First, the BOP’s Health \nServices Division recently implemented several pre-release requirements to account for \nthe risk of an inmate on HC [home confinement] contracting COVID while in HC, all of \nwhich must be clearly documented in the inmate’s medical record (“BEMR”) and \nincluded with the paperwork necessary to transfer an inmate to HC.  These requirements \ninclude Health Services staff meeting with the inmate to discuss the specific type of \nrelease residence (house/apartment/group home, etc.) where the inmate will be living, \naccount for any health concerns from individuals in the residence, secure a contact phone \nnumber for the inmate, and arrange safe transportation from the institution to the \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 7 of 26\nresidence.  Health Services staff must also educate the inmate as [to] how to protect \nthemselves from COVID-19 transmission, including proper hand washing, social \ndistancing, wearing of facial coverings and how to conduct self-assessments for signs and \nsymptoms of COVID-19.  Health Services staff must also evaluate the release plan to \ndetermine if HC would be more effective in protecting the inmate’s health than continued \nconfinement at their present place of incarceration.  Finally, Health Services staff must \nmake a determination whether the inmate requires medical care while serving their \nsentence on HC.  If frequent and ongoing medical care is required, Health Services staff \ncoordinate with the BOP’s contracted community medical provider and the BOP’s \nCentral Office to determine if the inmate’s medical needs can be met in the community.  \nDocumentation that each of the aforementioned tasks [was] performed must be included \nin the paperwork necessary to transfer an inmate to HC, and due to the lack of \nstandardization of this documentation, most of the inmates referenced below needed to \nhave this information added to their HC referral.  However, BOP has recently \nstandardized the process of documenting the performance of these tasks, and delays due \nto missing/insufficient BEMR documentation should no longer be a problem for HC \nreferrals out of FCI Danbury. \n \nECF No. 267 at 2-3.  The Warden continues:  \nA second factor impacting BOP’s ability to place inmates into HC within 14 days of \napproval is the clinically informed and empirically sound requirement that inmates test \nnegative on a “PCR” or “swab” COVID-19 test prior to release to the community.  The \nprivate laboratory FCI Danbury relies upon to provide test results that meet current “best \npractice” testing standards has been unable to provide us with results quickly enough to \nalways allow a 14-day quarantine, although we have requested this laboratory place some \npriority on FCI Danbury tests.  While the contractor seems amenable to prioritizing tests \nout of FCI Danbury, as recently as November 25th they informed us that recent increases \nin community-based testing may cause further delay in providing test results.  However, \ngiven the AG’s direction that BOP not take “any” risk of transferring inmates to home \nconfinement that will contribute to the spread of COVID-19, we reiterate the belief that \nwe need to use the best-available means of testing inmates prior to redesignation even if \nit extends the quarantine period.  \n \nFinally, several other factors have arisen over the past few months impacting the ability \nto move inmates to HC as expeditiously as possible.  First, the resumption of inmate \nmovement throughout the agency has created a need to quarantine newly-arriving \ninmates at FCI Danbury before they can be placed into the general population.  While \nstrict adherence to this practice is responsible for the fact there have been no new cases of \nCOVID within the general population for several months,5 quarantine space at FCI \nDanbury is severely limited and the space occupied by incoming inmates is not available \nto outgoing inmates (such as those transferring to HC) as it was prior to the resumption of \ninmate movement.  Second, the female Special Housing Unit has been closed to facilitate \n \n5 While the reference to “no new cases of COVID within the general population for several months” may have been \naccurate at the time the Warden wrote her letter, it was obsolete by the time the class filed the motion to enforce on \nDecember 6.  See supra note 4. \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 8 of 26\nnecessary improvements, further reducing the quarantine space available for inmates \ntransferring to HC.  Third, a recent update and migration of the BOP’s email system \ncaused a number of HC referrals to be sent to the wrong location in the agency, impacting \nseveral inmates class counsel inquires about.  Finally, FCI Danbury has temporarily lost \nthree Case Managers due to unforeseeable personal circumstances; as Case Managers are \npivotal to marshaling HC referrals through the agency, their absence has adversely \naffected the speed of HC redesignations. \n \nId. at 3.  The Warden then provides specific explanations for the delays in releasing 12 inmates6 \napproved for home confinement, in which the general themes just described recur in individual \ncases.   \nFor example, the first inmate was approved for home confinement on September 16, \n2020, but her “referral was returned during the routing process due to new BOP guidelines \nrequiring certain language in BEMR regarding the risk of COVID-19 in the community.”  Id.  \nThe referral for home confinement was received as of November 4, 2020, by the pertinent \nResidential Reentry Manager’s Office (“RRM”), a separate BOP office located in various \nregions and charged with placing inmates into the community for service of the remainder of \ntheir sentences—usually in Residential Reentry Centers (“RRCs”), which are often called \n“halfway houses.” 7  ECF No. 278-2 at 2.  Because of “a potential electronic error due to recent \nupdates and migration of the email system[,]” however, the RRM did not provide a home \nconfinement release date—in this case, December 17, 2020—until November 30, 2020.  Id.  In \nanother case, an inmate was approved for home confinement on August 24, 2020.  Id. at 4.  This \ninmate’s release was delayed due to outstanding Canadian charges that the BOP confirmed were \n \n6 Of these 12 inmates, 11 overlap with the 17 inmates identified in ECF No. 282, whose individual cases are \ndiscussed in the Warden’s later-filed declaration.  ECF No. 281 at 5-9.  This is the same group of 17 inmates I \nordered released in the December 11 order.   \n7 “RRCs are not BOP facilities and do not employ BOP staff; rather, they are private corporations with whom BOP \ncontracts to provide structured assistance to federal inmates releasing to the community.”  ECF No. 278-2 at 3.  \nRRCs run halfway houses and also supervise inmates released on home confinement.  Id.  Contractual arrangements \nlimit the number of inmates a RRC can supervise at any given time.  Id.  Nearly all federal inmates who are released \nto home confinement—94 percent—are supervised by RRCs.  Id. \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 9 of 26\nresolved on October 23, 2020, and because of the requirement that certain language be in the \ninmate’s BEMR.  Id.  The referral process continued on October 27, 2020, but because the RRM \ndid not receive it, the RRM did not begin processing the referral until November 24, 2020.  Id.  \nOther reasons for delay in specific cases include security-related reviews; checks with law \nenforcement for outstanding warrants, detainers, or pending charges; denials of supervision by \nprobation; quarantine constraints at FCI Danbury; and, in one case, the need to send ink \nfingerprints to the FBI.  Id. at 4-6.   \nThe Warden’s declaration, written on December 8, 2020 in response to the class’s motion \nto enforce, elaborates on the explanation provided in the December 1 letter and addresses the \ndelays experienced by the 17 individuals the class contended were being held at FCI Danbury in \nviolation of the Settlement Agreement.  Specifically, the Warden explains:  \nAs a preliminary matter, several events have happened in the instance of nearly every \ninmate set forth in this motion.  First, most inmates had their home confinement referral \nreturned during the routing process due to new BOP guidelines requiring certain language \nin an inmate’s Bureau Electronic Medical Record (“BEMR”) regarding the risk of \nCOVID-19 in the community.  Second, with respect to a smaller number of inmates, \nreferrals were delayed due to an electronic error associated with recent updates and \nmigration of the BOP’s email system, causing their home confinement referrals to be sent \nto an unmonitored mailbox.  Lastly, the need to quarantine inmates for 14 days and have \nthem test “negative” on a polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) COVID-19 test prior to \nrelease affected the ability to place these inmates into home confinement within 14 days \nof approval. \n \nECF No. 281 at 3 (internal citations omitted).  With respect to delays resulting from the \nrequirement that the BEMR [i.e., the inmate’s medical record] contain certain language, the \nWarden explains that delays were initially caused by differences in interpretation among the \nBOP’s regional RRMs of Attorney General William Barr’s March 26, 2020 directive, which \nrequired the BOP, before releasing any inmate on home confinement, to “make an assessment of \nthe inmate’s risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness, risks of COVID-19 at the inmate’s prison \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 10 of 26\nfacility, as well as the risks of COVID-19 at the location in which the inmate seeks home \nconfinement [based on CDC guidance].”  Id. at 3 (quoting Attorney General William Barr, \nMemorandum for Director of Bureau Prisons (March 26, 2020), Ex. D to the Warden’s \ndeclaration).  On November 16, 2020, the BOP adopted a uniform approach, requiring that any \ninmate approved for home confinement “be educated as to the best practices they might employ \nto avoid COVID-19 infection and that this education be documented in the inmate’s BEMR.”  Id.  \nThe Warden further explains that because the issue has been clarified, “BEMR documentation \nshould no longer be an issue for home confinement referrals coming out of FCI Danbury.”  Id.  \nWith respect to delays caused by the agency’s migration to a new email system, which began in \nOctober 2020 and caused home confinement referrals to be sent to an unmonitored mailbox at a \nRRM’s Office,8 the Warden explains that she has “advised [her] staff of the need to ensure that \nreferral packets are going to the proper mailboxes to ensure they route expediently through the \nRRO’s.”  Id. at 4.   \nWith respect to delays due to quarantine constraints, the Warden explains that “[i]t is a \nmandated BOP policy, one which was specifically preserved in the settlement of this case, that \ninmates being placed into home confinement quarantine for 14 days and then test ‘negative’ on a \nPCR COVID-19 test prior to release.”  Id.9  Due to recent increases in community based testing, \nthe “current wait time for lab results is approximately 5 to 7 days[]” despite the BOP’s request \nthat tests from FCI Danbury receive priority.  Id.  The Warden continues as follows:  \nFrom the advent of this pandemic, the Attorney General explicitly directed BOP “to place \nany inmate to whom you grant home confinement in a mandatory 14-day quarantine \nperiod before that inmate is discharged from a BOP facility to home confinement,” and \n \n8 “To place an inmate into home confinement, once the referral paperwork is completed at FCI Danbury, it is \ntransmitted to the Residential Reentry Manager’s Office (‘RRO’) to approve the placement of the inmate into the \ncommunity.”  ECF No. 281 at 4. \n9 The statement that a 14-day quarantine was “specifically preserved in the settlement of this case” apparently refers \nto language in a Side Letter entered into in connection with the Settlement Agreement.  I address this point below. \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 11 of 26\nthis direction has not been rescinded.  Given the Attorney General’s directive that BOP \nnot take “any” risk of transferring inmates to home confinement that could contribute to \nthe spread of COVID-19, the BOP is steadfast in the need to use a 14-day quarantine, as \nwell as the best-available means of testing inmates, prior to release. These requirements \nmay extend the amount of time needed to allow for a full quarantine or await the return of \na negative PCR test result. \n \nId. (citing AG Barr’s March 26, 2020 memorandum).  Before discussing the individual cases of \nthe 17 inmates approved for home confinement,10 the Warden notes that “[a]lthough several of \nthe inmates listed below have been made eligible for furlough, the issuance of a furlough is a rare \nand exceptional event.”  Id. (explaining the process for placing an inmate on furlough); see also \n18 U.S.C. § 3622 (BOP’s statutory furlough authority); ECF No. 281 at 39 (Program Statement \n5280.09 Inmate Furloughs, Ex. E to the Warden’s declaration) (“A furlough is an authorized \nabsence from an institution by an inmate who is not under escort of a staff member, U.S. \nMarshal, or state or federal agents. . . .  A [‘transfer furlough’ is a] furlough for the purpose of \ntransferring an inmate from one Bureau facility to another, a non-federal facility, or community \nconfinement (including home confinement) . . . .”).  The Warden concludes the declaration as \nfollows: \nOur experience has been that placing inmates into home confinement within 14 days is \nnot always possible due to the complex situations that many inmates need to account for \nbefore they can be safely released to the community.  In nearly every case in which staff \nat FCI Danbury have sought to transfer an inmate to home confinement, complications \narising out of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have made it more difficult to coordinate \nthe redesignation.  Despite these complications, we have continued to endeavor to place \ninmates into home confinement within 14 days of approval, consistent with public health \nand the safety of the community. \n \n \n10 Because the individual explanations for delays in releasing each of the 17 inmates are consistent with the general \nthemes described in the Warden’s declaration, and are largely identical to those described in the Warden’s letter, I \ndo not detail these explanations here. \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 12 of 26\nECF No. 281 at 9.  In fact, however, neither party has identified any class member approved for home \nconfinement who was actually released to home confinement within 14 days of the approval for home \nconfinement. \nThe Respondent also provided a declaration from Erik Anderson, the Eastern Sector \nAdministrator of the Residential Reentry Management Branch at the BOP.  ECF No. 278-2.  Mr. \nAnderson’s declaration describes the process for placing an inmate into home confinement under \nthe supervision of a RRC or a local United States Probation Office (“USPO”).  Id. at 2.  In brief, \nonce an inmate is approved for home confinement, either by the Warden or by the Home \nConfinement Committee (“HCC”), the following steps occur before the inmate is released to \nhome confinement under the supervision of a RRC: (1) the BOP prepares a “home confinement \npacket” containing the necessary paperwork for an inmate to be transferred to community \ncustody, id. at 3; (2) the home confinement packet is sent via internal email to the RRO located \nwhere the inmate will be released, id.; (3) RRO staff reviews the packet for completeness \nincluding, for CARES Act placements,11 language in the inmate’s BEMR “accounting for the \ninmate’s risk of contracting COVID-19 in home confinement versus the risk if they were to \nremain in a BOP facility”, id.; (4) if the packet is incomplete, the RRO will return the packet to \nthe sending institution for corrections, id.; (5) once the RRO determines that the packet is \ncomplete, and includes a requested placement date, the RRO transmits the packet to the RRC, \nid.; (6) RRC contractors then verify the suitability of the home confinement location and respond \nwith an acceptance or denial of the packet; though the BOP’s pandemic response plan provides \nthat such a response is due within 3 days of the RRC receiving the packet, the RRC is allowed 30 \ndays to respond under its contract with the BOP, id.; and (7) the RRC (or the USPO, if it is \n \n11 The CARES Act, adopted in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, expanded the BOP’s authority \nto release inmates to home confinement. \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 13 of 26\nconducting the supervision) conducts a review and investigation to ensure that certain principles \nof public safety are accounted for, id. at 5.   \nShould a RRC be unavailable, either because it does not serve a particular geographic \narea or because it lacks any further supervision capacity or otherwise cannot accept the inmate \nfor placement, the USPO may be able to undertake the supervision under the “Federal Location \nMonitoring” program (“FLM”).  Id. at 4.  The FLM program is not offered in all districts and, \nwhere available, a particular inmate’s proposal for home confinement will be evaluated based on \ncertain contractually-specified criteria except where, as here, the supervision is sought pursuant \nto “[s]pecial circumstances under provisional authorities granted by emergency legislation or \notherwise authorized by act of Congress . . . .”  Id.; see supra note 11.  USPOs are provided 30 \ndays to respond to a given request for supervision, but many have required more than 30 days \nbecause of “the exponential increase in community placements due to COVID-19.”  Id. at 5.  An \ninmate’s request may also be denied if the USPO does not have sufficient resources to take on \nthe supervision, “for example where an inmate has too much time remaining on their sentence \nfor the USPO to agree to supervise them for the remainder of their term.”  Id.   \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nA.  Settlement Agreements \n“A settlement agreement is a contract that is interpreted according to general principles of \ncontract law.  Once entered into, the contract is binding and conclusive.”  Powell v. Omnicom, \n497 F.3d 124, 128 (2d Cir. 2007) (internal citation omitted).  “It is customary, where Congress \nhas not adopted a different standard, to apply to the construction of government contracts the \nprinciples of general contract law.”  Priebe & Sons v. United States, 332 U.S. 407, 411 (1947).  \n“[C]ontracts with the federal government are governed by federal common law, which \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 14 of 26\nincorporates the core principles of the common law of contract[s] that are in force in most \nstates.”  E.E.O.C. v. Fed. Express Corp., 268 F. Supp. 2d 192, 204 (E.D.N.Y. 2003) (citing Falls \nRiverway Realty, Inc. v. City of Niagara Falls, N.Y., 754 F.2d 49, 55 n.4 (2d Cir. 1985)) (internal \ncitations and quotations marks omitted) (brackets in original).  Because the Restatement \n(Second) of Contracts “represent[s] the ‘prevailing view’ among the states . . .”, the principles \ntherein provide a source from which to “fashion a federal common law rule . . . .”  Bowden v. \nUnited States, 106 F.3d 433, 439 (D.C. Cir. 1997). \nB.  Specific Performance \n  As noted, under the Settlement Agreement, “[i]f Petitioner [i.e., the class] prevails on any \nclaim alleging Respondent’s [i.e., the Warden’s] or BOP’s non-compliance with this Agreement, \nthe sole remedy shall be specific performance of this Agreement.”  ECF No. 238-1 at 16.  \n“Specific performance is by definition limited to the enforcement of contract duties.” \nRestatement (Second) of Contracts ch. 16, topic 3, intro. note (Am. Law Inst. 1981).  Where \ndamages are inadequate “to protect the expectation interest of the injured party”, id. § 359, and \n“the terms of the contract are sufficiently certain to provide a basis for an appropriate order”, id. \n§ 362, “specific performance of a contract duty will be granted in the discretion of the court \nagainst a party who has committed or is threatening to commit a breach of the duty[,]” id. § 357; \nsee also id. §§ 359-69 (discussing how certain factors affect the availability of specific \nperformance).  “An order of specific performance or an injunction will be so drawn as best to \neffectuate the purposes for which the contract was made and on such terms as justice requires.”  \nId. § 358(1).  The order “need not be absolute in form and the performance that it requires need \nnot be identical with that due under the contract.”  Id.  The commentary to the Restatement \nelaborates on the court’s flexibility in crafting an order of specific performance:  \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 15 of 26\nThe objective of the court in granting equitable relief is to do complete justice to the \nextent that this is feasible.  Under the rule stated in Subsection (1), the court has the \npower to mold its order to this end.  The form and terms of the order are to a considerable \nextent within the discretion of the court. . . .  It may command a performance by the party \nin breach that is not identical with the one that he promised to render.  It may indirectly \ninduce the party in breach to do an act by enjoining him from doing inconsistent acts.  \nSee § 357(2)(b). \n \nId. § 358 cmt. a.   \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nAs noted, in the Settlement Agreement, the BOP agreed to “endeavor to release \nindividuals approved for home confinement to home confinement within 14 days of the approval \ndecision unless public safety or the absence of any home in which to place the inmate would \nmake it unsafe to move the inmate to home confinement within that fourteen day period.”  ECF \nNo. 238-1 at 11-12.  None of the parties contend that this provision is ambiguous or invalid, none \ncontest the court’s jurisdiction to enforce the Agreement, and none dispute any facts material to \nthe disposition of the class’s motion.  Further, the parties agree that my authority to grant specific \nperformance of the Agreement entails the authority to order the Warden to release one or more of \nthe 17 inmates to home confinement by a particular date.12  Thus, as the Government notes, \n“[t]he issue before the Court is whether this [14-day] provision of the Settlement Agreement has \nbeen violated to warrant an order of specific performance.”  ECF No. 278 at 1.   \nThe class argues that the Warden and the BOP have not “endeavor[ed]” to release \ninmates on home confinement within 14 days of approval because the reasons for delay provided \nby the Warden are not permissible under the Settlement Agreement, i.e., they do not constitute a \n“public safety” concern or a lack of a home to go to warranting delay beyond 14 days.

By contrast, the Warden and the BOP’s position is that they have “endeavored to \n \n12 The parties confirmed this agreement at oral argument on the motion to enforce during the telephonic status \nconference of December 10, 2020.   \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 16 of 26\nmeet this 14-day target . . .” and that “pre-release quarantine requirements and supervision[-] \nrelated administrative requirements are legitimate public safety reasons that can permit release \ndelays beyond 14 days, consistent with Section 11 [of the Settlement Agreement].”  ECF No. \n278 at 1-2.  For the reasons that follow, I agree with the class and find that the Warden and the \nBOP have not “endeavor[ed]” to meet the Settlement Agreement’s 14-day release target, and that \ntheir pre-release quarantine requirements and supervision-related administrative requirements do \nnot constitute “public safety” concerns that would permit a delay beyond 14 days within the \nmeaning of the Settlement Agreement.13 \nBecause the parties’ dispute turns on the meaning of “endeavor” and “public safety”, I \nbegin with definitions.  To “endeavor” means to “try hard to do or achieve something.” \nEndeavor, New Oxford American Dictionary; see also Endeavor, Black’s Law Dictionary (11th \ned. 2019) (“[t]o exert physical or intellectual strength toward the attainment of an object or \ngoal.”); Endeavor, Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary (defining “endeavor” to mean “to \nattempt (something, such as the fulfillment of an obligation) by exertion of effort”), \nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/endeavor (last accessed December 17, 2020); \nEndeavor, Dictionary.Com (“to exert oneself to do or effect something; make an effort; strive.”), \nhttps://www.dictionary.com/browse/endeavor?s=t (last visited December 20, 2020).  “Public \nsafety” is defined to mean “[t]he welfare and protection of the general public, usu[ally] \nexpressed as a governmental responsibility . . . .”  Public Safety, Black’s Law Dictionary.   \nThe use of the verb “endeavor” does not create uncertainty as to the Warden’s and the \nBOP’s time of performance; the contract remains sufficiently certain “to provide the basis for \n \n13 The parties also disagree about the extent to which the May 12, 2020 TRO was incorporated into the Settlement \nAgreement.  Because I find that Respondent breached the plain terms of the Settlement Agreement, I need not, and \ndo not, decide this issue. \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 17 of 26\ngiving an appropriate remedy.”  Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 362 cmt. a.; see also id. § \n33(2) (“The terms of a contract are reasonably certain if they provide a basis for determining the \nexistence of a breach and for giving an appropriate remedy.”).  That is so because, here, the word \n“endeavor” is followed by a specific time limit—14 days—, as well as reasonably clear \nexceptions (public safety and the absence of a home), against which the “endeavor[ing]” can be \nmeasured.  This is a good deal more definite than many time-based performance standards found \nin other enforceable contracts.  See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 33 cmt d. (“Uncertain \ntime of performance. Valid contracts are often made which do not specify the time for \nperformance.); id. cmt. d., illus. 3 (“A and B promise that certain performances shall be mutually \nrendered by them ‘immediately’ or ‘at once,’ or ‘promptly,’ or ‘as soon as possible,’ or ‘in about \none month.’  All these promises are sufficiently definite to form contracts.”).   \nHere, the BOP agreed to “endeavor to release individuals approved for home \nconfinement to home confinement within 14 days of the approval decision . . . .”  ECF No. 238-1 \nat 11-12 (emphasis added).  The Respondent has a contractual obligation to perform that duty \n“unless public safety or the absence of any home in which to place the inmate would make it \nunsafe to move the inmate to home confinement within that 14 day period.”  Id. at 12 (emphasis \nadded).  It bears emphasizing that each of these exceptions—a “public safety” concern or the \n“absence of any home”—is a permissible reason to delay release only if either exception “would \nmake it unsafe to move the inmate to home confinement within that 14 day period.”  Id. \n(emphasis added).  So, for example, if an inmate approved for home confinement did not have a \nhome to go to on day 14, the Respondent may delay release until such a home is found.  But if a \nhome were found for this hypothetical inmate on day 15, the Respondent would be obligated to \n“endeavor” to release that inmate to home confinement immediately because the 14-day period \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 18 of 26\nhad expired (assuming no “public safety” concern existed).  The same would be true were any \ninmate’s release to home confinement delayed beyond 14 days based on a permissible “public \nsafety” concern: As soon as that concern was resolved, the Respondent would be obligated to \n“endeavor” to release that inmate to home confinement immediately. \nWhen the Warden’s letter and declaration are viewed in the light of these principles, it \nbecomes clear that she and the BOP have not been “try[ing] hard,” “exert[ing] physical or \nintellectual strength”, or “striv[ing]” to effectuate the releases of the 17 inmates that are the \nsubject of the class’s motion within 14 days of their approval for home confinement.  As \ndescribed above, the Warden provides various reasons for the delays—which, when the class \nfiled its motion to enforce, ranged from 27 days to 104 days after approval for home confinement \nby the BOP’s Home Confinement Committee.  See ECF Nos. 265, 281.  Most of the reasons \noffered by the Warden to justify delaying release over the past several months do not comport \nwith her and the BOP’s commitment to “endeavor” to release the inmates within 14 days; and by \nthe time I issued the December 11 specific performance order, no reason comporting with that \ncommitment remained to further delay the release of the 17 inmates.     \nIn most of the 17 cases, the Warden notes that, after approval by the Home Confinement \nCommittee, “the referral [for home confinement] was returned during the routing process due to \nnew BOP guidelines requiring certain language in the [the inmate’s medical record] regarding \nthe risk of COVID-19 in the community.”  ECF No. 281 at 3; see also ECF No. 267 at 2-3.  This \napparently refers to pre-release steps the BOP is now taking to account for the risk that the \ninmate will contract COVID-19 while on home confinement, all of which must be now be \ndocumented in the inmate’s medical record, and includes things like educating the inmate about \nhow to protect against infection by COVID-19.  Id.  While these steps are laudable, and while it \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 19 of 26\nis sensible to document them in the inmate’s medical record, they are not a basis to delay release \nto home confinement under the Agreement, because they do not concern “public safety” or the \nabsence of a home for the inmate, and treating them as a basis for such delay is inconsistent with \nthe BOP’s obligation to “endeavor to release” within 14 days of approval for home confinement.  \nIn general, inmates face a substantially greater risk of contracting COVID-19 while incarcerated \nthan they do while living at home.14  The inmates at FCI Danbury certainly do: the current \nnumber of infections among Danbury inmates suggests a substantially greater positivity rate than \namong the population of Fairfield County, where the prison is located.15  Under these \ncircumstances, it is perverse to delay the release of inmates until notations in their medical record \nhave been made about efforts to protect them when they leave prison.  And the need to make \nnotations in the inmate’s medical record has nothing to do with protecting the public or ensuring \nthat an inmate has a home to release to.  Likewise, the delays in processing a home confinement \npacket/referral after it is approved due to electronic or administrative errors that, in some cases, \nwent undetected for nearly a month, or delays due to making any kind of comparative risk \nassessment of an inmate’s chances of contracting COVID-19, are unrelated to public safety or a \nhome to go to and do not constitute permissible reasons to delay release under the Agreement.  \nAccordingly, in the December 11 order, I ordered that, going forward, the BOP and the Warden \ncould not delay releasing an inmate beyond 14 days after approval by the Home Confinement \n \n14 See Brendan Saloner et al., COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in Federal and State Prison, J. of the Am. Med. Ass’n \n(July 8, 2020), https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768249 (as of June 6, 2020, concluding that: (1) \nthe “COVID-19 case rate for prisoners was 5.5 times higher than the US population case rate . . .”; (2) the “crude \nCOVID-19 death rate in prisons was 39 deaths per 100 000 prisoners, which was higher than the US population rate \nof 29 deaths per 100 000”; and (3) the “mean daily case growth rate was 8.3% per day in prisons and 3.4% per day \nin the US population” between March 31, 2020, to June 6, 2020). \n15 Even if the current number of 95 active infections reflected testing of all 862 inmates at FCI Danbury—a generous \nassumption, as there is nothing in the record to suggest that all Danbury inmates have been tested recently—, the \npositivity rate would be about 11%—a good deal higher than the 7.8% positivity rate currently being reported for \nFairfield County.  See supra note 3; see also https://www.covidactnow.org/us/connecticut-ct?s=1460419 (last visited \non December 21, 2020).    \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 20 of 26\nCommittee on any of these grounds, and set deadlines aimed at minimizing delays caused by the \nneed for FCI Danbury to coordinate with RRMs.  See ECF No. 289 at 3.  \nThe Warden cites as another reason for delay the need to quarantine inmates and to test \nthem for COVID-19 before releasing them to home confinement, and the delays in getting test \nresults.  In support of its position that all inmates must quarantine for 14 days and then receive a \nnegative PCR COVID-19 test (which, given the 5-7 day wait for test results, see ECF No. 281 at \n4, extends any pre-release quarantine from 14 days to between 19 and 21 days), the Warden \nstates it is a “mandated BOP policy,” citing Attorney General Barr’s March 26, 2020 \nmemorandum, and one that was “specifically preserved in the settlement of this case.”  For the \nlatter statement, the Warden is apparently relying on the Side Letter, because the Settlement \nAgreement itself says nothing about preserving a mandatory 14-day quarantine period.  The Side \nLetter, which was entered into in conjunction with the Settlement Agreement, states that “it is \nBOP policy that all inmates who are approved for home confinement or residential reentry center \nplacement be quarantined for 14 days prior to release from FCI Danbury[.]”  But the same \nparagraph provides that inmates approved for home confinement “may seek a waiver of the 14-\nday quarantine requirement . . .”, indicating that the Warden has discretion to refrain from \nrequiring an inmate approved for home confinement to quarantine for 14 days before releasing \nthat inmate to home confinement.  ECF No. 138-1 at 3.  In any event, the Side Letter is a \nunilateral statement of intent by the BOP about hygiene and other safety-related measures it \nexpects to take while the Settlement Agreement remains in effect; the class is not a party to the \nSide Letter, and the Side Letter expressly states that it is not part of the Settlement Agreement.  \nId.  It thus cannot qualify the BOP’s and the Warden’s agreement to “endeavor” to release \ninmates within 14 days of approval of home confinement.  Finally, with regard to Attorney \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 21 of 26\nGeneral Barr’s March 26, 2020 memorandum, the Warden neglects to mention his subsequent  \nApril 3, 2020 memorandum, which directs the BOP, and FCI Danbury in particular, to \n“immediately process [all inmates approved for home confinement] for transfer and then \nimmediately transfer them following a 14-day quarantine period at an appropriate BOP facility, \nor, in appropriate cases subject to your case-by-case discretion, in the residence to which the \ninmate is being transferred.”16  \nFurther, although I agree that minimizing the risk that inmates being released on home \nconfinement are COVID-positive is consistent with protecting the public safety, it is far from \nclear that FCI Danbury’s requirement of quarantine plus testing for those approved for home \nconfinement is enhancing the public’s safety.  Current CDC guidance suggests that it would not \nbe necessary to test these inmates at all if they were placed in a proper quarantine—either at \nhome or while still incarcerated.17  It is unclear whether the BOP is making attempts—\nendeavoring—to determine whether inmates approved for home confinement can safely \nquarantine at home, an option expressly left open by the Attorney General’s April 3 memo and \none the TRO specifically required the BOP to explore.  See ECF No. 30 at 71.  The class has also \npresented some evidence suggesting that the quarantine arrangements at Danbury are not ideal, \nsee ECF No. 263 at 13-14; ECF No. 270 at 1-3; ECF No. 279 at 1; see also Federal Bureau of \nPrisons, COVID-19 Update, https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/index.jsp (last accessed \nDecember 18, 2020) (reporting 95 inmates infected with COVID-19, one inmate death from \n \n16 Federal Bureau of Prisons, Memorandum for Director of Bureau of Prisons from Attorney General William Barr: \nIncreasing Use of Home Confinement at Institutions Most Affected by COVID-19 (April 3, 2020) (emphasis added), \nhttps://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/docs/bop_memo_home_confinement_april3.pdf. \n17 See When to Quarantine, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html (stating that people who have been in \nclose contact with someone who has COVID-19 should quarantine at home “for 14 days after [the] last contact with \na person who has COVID-19 . . .”; and that one option to reduce quarantine time is to “stop[] quarantine . . . [a]fter \nday 10 without testing . . . .”) (last accessed December 18, 2020). \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 22 of 26\nCOVID-19, and 82 inmates and 69 staff recovered from COVID-19), and that some inmates \nhave become exposed to COVID while in quarantine.18  Others have been exposed while waiting \nto enter quarantine from the general population due to constraints on quarantine space that have \nno doubt been exacerbated by the practice of keeping inmates in quarantine far longer than \nrequired under CDC guidelines.19  All this defeats the purpose of the quarantine.  Further, while \nthe CDC has suggested that quarantine can be shortened when it is combined with testing, that \nwill work only if test results are obtained promptly, which is apparently not the case here given a \n5-7 day waiting period for test results.  If quarantine is ineffective, there is no point in delaying \nrelease due to quarantine, especially given the possibility of a home-based quarantine; and if \nquarantine is effective, then there is no point in extending it by 5 to 7 days of testing return time.  \nSimilarly, limitations on quarantine space for outgoing inmates should not be a basis for delaying \nrelease, at least not until other options, like quarantining at the place of home confinement, have \nbeen exhausted.  Thus, in the order of specific performance, I prohibited the BOP from delaying \nrelease to home confinement based on either (1) the need to quarantine an inmate at FCI \nDanbury unless the BOP found, for specific reasons, that the inmate could not safely quarantine \nat home, or (2) the need to await COVID-19 test results or to further quarantine an inmate if the \ninmate had quarantined for 14 days at FCI Danbury and was not showing symptoms of COVID-\n19.  ECF No. 289 at 3.  \n \n18 After the December 11 order was entered, the Government reported to chambers, via email, that two of the 17 \nclass members I ordered released had received positive COVID-19 tests after entering quarantine.  These individuals \nwere K.C., who entered quarantine on December 7, 2020, ECF No. 265 at 2, and R.G., who entered quarantine on \nDecember 1, 2020, id. at 3.  One of these had already been released, and I directed both sets of counsel to contact \nthis individual to ensure she understood she had tested positive.  The second had not been, and I allowed the Warden \nto delay release until the inmate tested negative. \n19 Some of the BOP’s constraints on quarantine space are understandable and do not, by themselves, provide \ngrounds for a finding that the Respondent breached the settlement agreement.  These include the efforts to \nquarantine incoming inmates, the closure of the women’s SHU due to construction or repair, and the temporary loss \nof Case Managers.  See ECF No. 281 at 3. \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 23 of 26\nBy the time the class filed its motion, the Warden was continuing to hold the 17 inmates \nonly because of the extended quarantine and testing requirements or, in a few cases, because the \nother types of delays described above had postponed the period of quarantine until at least \nseveral weeks after the approval for home confinement, with the BOP making no documented \neffort to determine if the inmate could quarantine safely in the home.  One of the 17, discussed \nbelow, was held for 104 days from the date of approval of her home confinement; another was \nheld for 88 days,20 two others were held for 83 days, and two others for 81 days.  ECF No. 282.  \nBecause the reasons for the delay in their release were not consistent with the BOP’s and the \nWarden’s promise to “endeavor” to effectuate release within 14 days of approval for home \nconfinement, I concluded that the Warden and the BOP had breached the Settlement Agreement \nand ordered these inmates to be released.  The December 11 order required Respondent to \nrelease each of the 17 inmates (identified in ECF Nos. 265 and 282) by 5:00 p.m. on Saturday \nDecember 12, 2020.  In addition, the order required the Warden and the BOP, going forward, to \nexplain to class counsel within 5 days of the expiration of the 14-day period any delays (and a \nplan to resolve them) beyond the 14 days.  Such explanations will help fulfill the purpose of the \nAgreement and realize the BOP’s and the Warden’s promise to “endeavor” to meet the 14-day \nrelease target.  It will also facilitate judicial review in the event of further disputes. \nFollowing the entry of the order of specific performance, I also ordered that one inmate \nbe released to the care of class counsel on furlough while the BOP works to approve a \ncommunity supervision plan for this inmate.  I did so for several reasons.  First, this inmate was \n \n20 This inmate, C.F., was listed in motion to enforce as having been approved for home confinement on 10/6/2020.  \nECF No. 265.  However, this date was based on the date class counsel received C.F.’s home confinement approval \npaperwork.  Id.  In the Warden’s declaration, she clarifies that C.F. was approved for home confinement on \n9/9/2020, and therefore had been waiting to be released on home confinement for 88 days as of December 6, 2020, \nnot 61 days.  See ECF No. 281 at 8 ¶ 25. \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 24 of 26\napproved for home confinement on August 24, 2020 and had been waiting 104 days to be \nreleased on home confinement as of December 6, 2020.  ECF No. 265 at 2.  For the reasons \ndescribed above, the Respondent provided no permissible reason under the Agreement to delay \nrelease of this inmate for that period, and plainly was not “endeavor[ing]” to release her within \n14 days.  In addition, this inmate’s proposed place of home confinement became unavailable \nafter I entered the order of specific performance, apparently through no fault of her own, and \nclass counsel offered reasonable grounds to find that a feasible supervision plan could be put in \nplace before the expiration of the 30-day furlough.  The BOP has the authority to grant an inmate \nfurlough for the purpose of transferring the inmate to home confinement and may do so without a \npre-approved supervision plan.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3622(a), (6) (authorizing the BOP to \ntemporarily release an inmate from the place of imprisonment, under certain conditions, to, inter \nalia, allow an inmate to “visit a designated place for a period not to exceed thirty days, and then \nreturn to the same or another facility, for the purpose of . . . engaging in any other significant \nactivity consistent with the public interest . . . .”); see also ECF No. 281 at 39 (Program \nStatement 5280.09 Inmate Furloughs, Ex. E to the Warden’s declaration) (“A furlough is an \nauthorized absence from an institution by an inmate who is not under escort of a staff member, \nU.S. Marshal, or state or federal agents. . . .  A [‘transfer furlough’ is a] furlough for the purpose \nof transferring an inmate from one Bureau facility to another, a non-federal facility, or \ncommunity confinement (including home confinement) . . . .”).  The purpose of the December 14 \nfurlough order is to transfer the inmate to home confinement and, in any case, I find that the \nfurlough itself is a “significant activity consistent with the public interest . . .”, 18 U.S.C. § \n3622(a)(6), namely to protect the health of a medically vulnerable inmate approved for home \nconfinement and who had already been put at undue risk of infection.     \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 25 of 26\nThe December 11 order of specific performance was written to “best [] effectuate the \npurposes for which the [Settlement Agreement] was made and on such terms as justice requires.”  \nRestatement (Second) of Contracts § 358(1).  In addition, though the performance mandated by \nthe order is not identical to the BOP’s and the Warden’s duties under the Settlement Agreement, \nultimately the order does no more than require the BOP and the Warden to refrain from acting \ninconsistently with their contractual obligations.  See id. § 358 cmt. a.  I also note that the finding \nsupporting the December 11 order of specific performance is narrow—I find only that the pre-\nrelease quarantine requirements and supervision-related administrative requirements described \nby the Warden do not constitute “public safety” concerns or the absence of a home to go to under \nthe Settlement Agreement, and that, based on the undisputed facts presented by the parties, the \nBOP has not “endeavor[ed]” to release inmates within 14 days after approval for home \nconfinement.  This opinion and the December 11 and 14 orders do not set forth any “bright-line” \nrule that any delay beyond 14 days, where no public safety or lack of a home would otherwise \npermit delay, constitutes a breach of the terms of the Settlement Agreement.  I need not decide \nthat question, i.e., the extent to which the term “endeavor” gives the BOP flexibility in its \ncontractual time of performance when it is sincerely undertaking exertions of effort to meet the \n14-day target.  I decide only that, given the undisputed facts before me, the Warden and the BOP \nbreached the Settlement Agreement and the specific performance I ordered on December 11 and \n14 is appropriate and warranted. \n \n \n \n \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 304   Filed 12/22/20   Page 26 of 26\nIV.

Under the settlement, the Warden of FCI Danbury \nand the U.S. Bureau of Prisons (the “BOP”) agree to review class members to determine whether \nto transfer them to home confinement due to the risks associated with COVID-19 using a process \noutlined in the Settlement Agreement.  The Settlement Agreement provides that I retain \njurisdiction to resolve disputes that arise between the parties by issuing orders of specific \nperformance.  This ruling resolves a series of disputes that have arisen concerning the standards \nthe BOP is using to review inmates for home confinement, the adequacy of the explanations it is \nproviding to support decisions to deny transfers to home confinement, and other matters.  In \nparticular, the class has filed a motion for enforcement of the settlement agreement that asks me, \namong other things, to bar the BOP from relying on certain factors that the class contends are not \nrelevant to the issues of inmate and public safety on which the BOP should be focusing in the \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 332   Filed 01/19/21   Page 2 of 23\nhome confinement review process mandated by the Settlement Agreement.  ECF No. 296.  These \nfactors include things like non-violent disciplinary infractions and the percentage of time an \ninmate has served.  After considering the parties’ memoranda and associated exhibits, and the \nJanuary 8 oral argument, I grant in part and deny in part the class’s motion for the reasons and to \nthe extent set forth below. \nI assume familiarity with the factual and procedural background of this case as set forth \nin the Ruling on Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 30, \nthe Settlement Agreement, ECF No. 238-1, the first Order of Specific Performance and \nassociated memorandum, ECF Nos. 289, 304, and the submissions relating to the class’s second \nmotion to enforce the Settlement Agreement, ECF Nos. 296-305, 307-08, 310-13, 319-23.  I also \nincorporate by reference the legal standards set forth in the memorandum supporting the first \nOrder of Specific Performance.  ECF No. 304 at 3 n.1 (jurisdiction); id. at 13-15 (settlement \nagreements, specific performance).  I address the specific issues raised in the class’s motion to \nenforce the Settlement Agreement below. \nI.  DISCUSSION \nA. The BOP’s Home Confinement Decisions Often Do Not Reflect Application of the \nCorrect Standard  \nThe class seeks a series of orders about the factors the BOP may rely on in making home \nconfinement decisions, among which are orders that would direct the BOP to “[c]onsider all \nCDC [r]isk factors as valid risk factors that render a home confinement applicant medically \nvulnerable . . . and [afford] all CDC [r]isk factors ‘substantial weight’ in any home confinement \ndecision”; “[e]xplicitly consider an individual’s age as a CDC risk factor”; “[n]ot rely in home \nconfinement decisions on a ‘Low’ PATTERN Score as a basis to deny home confinement to \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 332   Filed 01/19/21   Page 3 of 23\nclass members”1; “[n]ot rely in home confinement decisions on factors that are only tangentially \nrelated to public safety, including percentage of time served or recent disciplinary history that is \nboth non-violent and non-sexual”.  ECF No. 296 at 33-34.  More generally, the class argues that \nthe “statement of reasons on the BOP’s worksheets [generated during the home confinement \nreview process] often fail to evidence that the BOP has engaged in any balancing between public \nsafety and inmate safety . . . .”  Id. at 1.  The class has submitted a large volume of worksheets \nreflecting recent denials of home confinement and generated in the home confinement review \nprocess contemplated by the Settlement Agreement.  By contrast, the Warden and BOP \n(collectively, the “BOP”) assert that the Settlement Agreement does not limit the BOP’s \ndiscretion as to either its substantive judgment in individual home confinement decisions or its \njudgment as to which considerations bear on public safety or an inmate’s suitability for home \nconfinement.  ECF No. 310 at 1.  As to several of these issues, I agree with the class that the \nBOP’s decisions as reflected in the worksheets do not comply with the standards required by the \nSettlement Agreement.  I begin with a general discussion of the standards for the home \nconfinement review process required by the Settlement Agreement and my role in enforcing \nthose standards, and then proceed to the specific issues in dispute.   \n1.  Standards for Home Confinement Review and Judicial Enforcement Contemplated by \nthe Settlement Agreement  \n \nThe Settlement Agreement makes clear in several places that “the provisions of the May \n12, 2020 TRO” (“TRO”) govern the BOP’s home confinement reviews.  See ECF No. 238-1 ¶ 3 \n(requiring all List Two inmates to be reviewed for home confinement “pursuant to” the Attorney \nGeneral’s memoranda, current BOP guidance, “and the standards set forth in the May 12, 2020 \n \n1 As discussed below, PATTERN is a risk assessment tool used by the BOP to estimate the risk of \nrecidivism. \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 332   Filed 01/19/21   Page 4 of 23\nTRO”, but stating that “to the extent” the latter standards differ from the Attorney General’s \nmemos or the current BOP guidance, “the provisions of the May 12, 2020 TRO shall control”; \nand “BOP agrees to have [its Home Confinement Committee (“HCC”)]] make a home \nconfinement determination based upon the standards set forth in the May 12, 2020 TRO.”); id. ¶ \n6 (same for non-list inmates who are added to class).  The May 12, 2020 TRO was issued as \npreliminary relief in a habeas petition brought by the class claiming, among other things, that the \nWarden at FCI Danbury was failing to protect inmates from the risk of severe illness or death \nposed by COVID-19 in violation of the Eighth Amendment, in particular, by failing to use her \nexpanded authority under the March 2020 CARES Act to place inmates on home confinement.   \nThe TRO requires the Warden at FCI Danbury to “assign[] substantial weight in [the \nhome confinement review] to the inmate’s risk factors for COVD-19 based on CDC guidance”, \nand to eliminate “all requirements” that (1) “the inmate have served some portion of his or her \nsentence . . .”, (2) “a ‘primary or prior offense’ not be a violent offense . . .”, and (3) “the inmate \nbe ‘without incident reports in the past 12 months (regardless of severity level)’”.  ECF No. 30 at \n71.  A footnote elaborates on the elimination of these “requirements,” stating “I do not mean to \nsuggest that these considerations are irrelevant to the Warden’s assessment of the \nappropriateness of home confinement for a particular inmate[,]” and noting, as an example, that \nan inmate’s violent history “is obviously relevant to the assessment of the danger his or her \nrelease might pose to the public and thus should be accorded weight in the determination.”  Id. \nn.33.  The footnote then states: “The purpose of eliminating these and other categorical \nexclusions is to the make the process more individualized and more amenable to a proper and \nreasonable balancing of inmate safety and public safety.”  Id. (emphasis added). \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 332   Filed 01/19/21   Page 5 of 23\nThe concept of balancing public safety against inmate safety in the home confinement \nreview process is a recurring theme in the opinion accompanying the TRO.  The introduction to \nthe opinion states: “I grant in part the inmates’ motion for a temporary restraining order and issue \nan order that requires the Warden . . . to adopt a process that is . . . more clearly focused on the \ncritical issues of inmate and public safety than the current process.”  ECF No. 30 at 2; see also \nid. at 57 (“Petitioners have made a preliminary showing that, in these circumstances, the Eighth \nAmendment requires that the [home confinement determination] be made promptly and that it \nfocus on the critical issues of inmate and public safety.”); id. at 68 (“The temporary restraining \norder that follows is aimed at . . . focusing that process [for evaluating inmates for home \nconfinement] on achieving a ‘reasonable’ balance between the risks to inmate safety and the \nrisks to public safety.”).   \nIt is thus clear that, in adopting the standards of the May 12, 2020 TRO, the Settlement \nAgreement requires the BOP to balance inmate safety against public safety and, in that balancing \nprocess, to “assign substantial weight” to the inmate’s COVID-19 risk factors when making \ndecisions on whether to transfer an inmate to home confinement.  Contrary to the BOP’s \nargument, this requirement is not a mandate (or a license) for the BOP to consider the “totality of \nthe circumstances” – a term that appears nowhere in the TRO, the underlying opinion, or the \nSettlement Agreement.2  Instead, it directs the BOP to weigh certain factors – those related to \ninmate safety and public safety – and not others, and directs it to accord a specified albeit \n \n2  The term does appear in former Attorney General Barr’s March 26 memorandum.  See ECF No. 281 at 33 \n(directing that “home confinement [should be granted] only when BOP has determined—based on the totality of the \ncircumstances—that transfer to home confinement is likely not to increase the inmate’s risk of contracting COVID-\n19.”).  But as noted, the Settlement Agreement requires the BOP to follow the TRO’s standards to the extent there is \na conflict with the Attorney General’s March 26 memorandum.   \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 332   Filed 01/19/21   Page 6 of 23\nimprecise quantity of weight – “substantial weight” – to a set of inmate-safety-related factors, \ni.e., COVID-19 risk factors.   \nThe BOP argues that it has broad discretion to define what “public safety” means in this \ncontext and can thus rely on a wide range of considerations in making home confinement \ndecisions.  It points out that the Settlement Agreement provides that the BOP’s “substantive \ndetermination of whether to place any particular member of the Medically Vulnerable Class on \nhome confinement shall not be subject to judicial review, except that the Court may order the \nBOP to have [it] reconsider a home confinement denial that is based upon erroneous factual \nunderpinnings . . . or a failure to comply with the terms of the Agreement, and may compel \nspecific performance of the Agreement.”  ECF No. 134-1 at 17.  The Settlement Agreement’s \nassignment to the BOP of the task of reading the scale, however, is not a grant of authority to \ndetermine the ingredients of the items to be weighed.3  In other words, “public safety” does not \nmean whatever the BOP says it means.  To the contrary, as used in the TRO, the underlying \nopinion, the Settlement Agreement, and former Attorney General Barr’s memoranda, “public \nsafety” has a specific meaning, i.e., an immediate danger to the public from the release of an \ninmate into the community. \nThe term “public safety” appears in the TRO in the footnote quoted above.   See ECF No. \n30 at 71 n.33.  The example immediately preceding the sentence in which the term appears \ndiscusses an inmate with a “violent history[,]” id.—obviously, an inmate with an active \n \n3 Neither is 18 U.S.C. § 3624, the statute that governs the BOP’s exercise of its authority to transfer \ninmates to home confinement during the final portion of their sentence.  After the CARES Act expanded \nthat authority to allow the BOP to make such transfers during any portion of an inmate’s sentence, I \nfound, on a preliminary basis in the TRO ruling, that the BOP was not exercising that authority in \ncompliance with the Eighth Amendment.  Thereafter, the parties entered into the Settlement Agreement, \nwhich both released the BOP from my preliminary finding and bound it to new, more specific obligations \npertaining to home confinement transfers.  It is the Settlement Agreement, not Section 3624, that defines \nthe parameters of the home confinement review process for members of the class.    \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 332   Filed 01/19/21   Page 7 of 23\npropensity for violence presents an immediate danger to the public if he is released.4  The \nunderlying opinion confirms that “public safety” is focused on immediate danger to the public.  \nThe opinion describes the requirement of serving a specified percentage of a sentence and the \npresence of an incident report “no matter the seriousness” as “at best, only tangentially related to \npublic safety,” ECF No. 30 at 48, because neither of those circumstances presents an immediate \nthreat to the public.  The Settlement Agreement uses “public safety” in the same sense of \nimmediate danger: it requires the BOP to “endeavor” to transfer individuals approved for home \nconfinement to home confinement within 14 days of approval “unless public safety or the \nabsence of any home in which to place the inmate would make it unsafe to move the inmate to \nhome confinement within the 14 day period.”  ECF No. 238-1 ¶ 11.  “Public safety” in that \ncontext plainly is not referring to things like the portion of the sentence served or minor \ndisciplinary infractions.  Finally, the Attorney General’s April 3 memorandum uses “public \nsafety” to describe a danger that might be mitigated by the electronic monitoring of an inmate.  \nIn that document, the Attorney General authorized the BOP to transfer inmates to home \nconfinement “even if electronic monitoring is not available, so long as BOP determines in every \nsuch instances that doing so is appropriate and consistent with our obligation to protect public \nsafety.”5  The memorandum elaborates that protecting public safety means protecting against the \n“risk[] to the public from released prisoners engaging in additional criminal activity, potentially \n \n4 Other inmates whose profiles would present obvious risks to the public safety include those with recent \nconduct demonstrating an active propensity for distributing dangerous drugs, illegally possessing \nfirearms, or engaging in sex-related offenses.  Another obvious example would be the risk that an inmate \ninfected with COVID-19 might infect members of the public.  By listing these examples, I do not intend \nto be exclusive.  But the farther removed an inmate’s offense of conviction, criminal or disciplinary \nhistory, or other circumstances are from presenting an immediate danger to the public, the more the BOP \nwill need to explain its conclusion that those circumstances are related to public safety.    \n5 Federal Bureau of Prisons, Memorandum for Director of Bureau of Prisons from Attorney General \nWilliam Barr: Increasing Use of Home Confinement at Institutions Most Affected by COVID-19 (April 3, \n2020), https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/docs/bop_memo_home_confinement_april3.pdf.   \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 332   Filed 01/19/21   Page 8 of 23\nincluding violence or heinous sex offenses.”6  In short, the consistent use of the term “public \nsafety” in the Settlement Agreement, the TRO, and related documents shows that it has a fixed, \nclear meaning that is not amenable to expansion by the BOP. \nGiven all this, I conclude that the Settlement Agreement permits a finding by the Court \nthat the BOP is “fail[ing] to comply with the terms of the Agreement” in cases in which the \nworksheet documenting the home confinement review, when read as a whole,7 does not make \nclear that the BOP has made an effort to (1) balance the inmate’s safety against public safety, \nproperly understood as meaning immediate danger to the public from release of the inmate, and \n(2) assign “substantial weight” to the “inmate’s risk factors for COVD-19 based on CDC \nguidance”.  On the other hand, the Settlement Agreement does not permit such a finding when \nthe Court (or class counsel) disagrees with the product of the BOP’s effort, for example, because, \nin the Court’s or class counsel’s view, the BOP has struck the balance incorrectly or given too \nmuch weight to public-safety-related factors.   \n In its motion to enforce, the class seeks several specific orders from the Court.  See ECF \nNo. 296 at 33-35.  After oral argument and through the parties’ filings, it is apparent, based on \nagreements reached by the parties, that some of the issues raised are now moot.8  I address the \nremaining issues below. \n \n6 Id. \n7 I discuss in greater detail below the Settlement Agreement’s requirements regarding the length and \nquality of the explanation. \n8 Specifically, the parties agreed: (1) that the Warden and BOP are required to list and consider all of a \nclass member’s CDC risk factors on that individual’s home confinement review sheet; (2) that the \nSettlement Agreement requires a re-review for home confinement where an inmate’s worksheet does not \nlist one or more that individual’s Tier I or Tier II risk factors, except in limited circumstances (i.e., where \nan error or mistake of fact is not material, see ECF No. 134-1 at 12); (3) that the Warden and BOP are \nrequired to re-review inmates who were approved for placement in an RRC but were denied home \nconfinement without any explanation; and (4) to work collaboratively to identify the facts underlying \nindividual home confinement denials, where such facts are not apparent from the face of the worksheet \nand not otherwise obtainable from the individual or his or her criminal docket.  Thus, the requests for \nrelief in sections (a)(iii), (b)(i), and (c) are DENIED as moot.  See ECF No. 296 at 33-35.  In addition, the \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 332   Filed 01/19/21   Page 9 of 23\n2.  CDC Risk Factors \nThe parties disagree about whether the BOP is properly considering all CDC risk factors \nand giving “substantial weight” to these factors as required by the Settlement Agreement.  \nSpecifically, the class seeks an order directing the BOP to “[c]onsider all CDC Risk factors as \nvalid risk factors that render a home confinement applicant medically vulnerable, including Tier \nII conditions, and that all CDC Risk factors are to be afforded ‘substantial weight’ in any home \nconfinement decision”.  ECF No. 296 at 33 ¶ (a)(i).  “Tier II conditions,” or Tier II risk factors, \nrefer to medical conditions that, according to the CDC, might place a person at a higher risk of \ndeveloping severe illness from COVID-19.  By comparison, Tier I risk factors are conditions \nthat, according to the CDC, do place a person a higher risk of developing severe illness as a \nresult of COVID-19.9 \nThe core of this dispute is focused on the following language that appears on many of the \nworksheets in which the BOP has denied home confinement to an inmate – usually an inmate \nwho has only Tier II risk factors: the inmate “does not have any risk factors that would put \nhim/her at a higher risk of developing severe illness as a result of COVID-19 based on CDC \nguidelines.”10  On its face, this language appears to contradict other portions of the worksheet \nlisting the CDC risk factors.11  More generally, it is inconsistent with the idea that all members of \n \nGovernment agreed, “when producing worksheets to class counsel going forward, [that the \nGovernment’s] counsel will provide the date of the Home Confinement Committee’s decision.”  ECF No. \n324 at 2.  I therefore also deny as moot the request for relief in section (g) of the supplemental \nmemorandum.  See ECF No. 307 at 29. \n9 People with Certain Medical Conditions, CDC, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-\nprecautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html. \n10 See, e.g., ECF No. 298 at 60 (using this phrase to describe O.F., who has two Tier II conditions: 28 \npercent BMI and hypertension); id. at 64 (same for G.G., who has one potential Tier II condition: \nasthma); see also People with Certain Medical Conditions, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n(“CDC”) (last visited January 12, 2021), available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-\nextra-precautions/people-withmedical-conditions.html. \n11 Under the Settlement Agreement, each worksheet must list all an inmate’s risk factors, including both \nTier I and Tier II factors.  ECF No. 134-1 at 11. \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 332   Filed 01/19/21   Page 10 of 23\nthe class – and thus all those for whom such worksheets are being generated – are “medically \nvulnerable” on account of their having one or more CDC risk factors.  The BOP argues that, \nthough the above-quoted language is inartful, it is intended to capture the notion that an inmate \nwith only Tier II risk factors does not face a fully proven risk from COVID-19, because Tier II \n“conditions ‘might,’ but are not proven to, place an inmate at increased risk of severe COVID-\n19.”  ECF No. 310 at 8 (emphasis in original).  The BOP further asserts that Tier I and Tier II \nconditions present different risks according to the CDC and, therefore, should be afforded \ndifferent weights in individual home confinement decisions.  I agree with the BOP that the \nSettlement Agreement allows it to accord less weight to Tier II factors.  “Substantial weight” in \nthis context must be understood to define a spectrum,12 and Tier I factors, which are supported \nby more robust scientific evidence of an association with COVID-19, belong at the weightier end \nof that spectrum.  But I agree with the class that the BOP’s language stating that an inmate “does \nnot have any risk factors that would put him/her at a higher risk of developing severe illness as a \nresult of COVID-19” is, at best, ambiguous and fails to demonstrate that the BOP is complying \nwith its obligation to assign “substantial weight” to an inmate’s COVID-19 risk factors.   \nThe Settlement Agreement requires the BOP to “assign[] substantial weight” to the \ninmate’s COVID risk factors, but it qualifies this statement with the phrase “based on CDC \nguidance.”  ECF No. 30 at 71.  The CDC explains that the distinction between Tier I factors and \nTier II factors is based on the strength of the scientific evidence supporting the conclusion that \nthere is an association between each risk factor and severe illness.  Tier I conditions are \nsupported by the “strongest and most consistent evidence”, which is “[d]efined as consistent \n \n12 The TRO issued before the CDC revised its guidance to separate the conditions associated with severe \nillness due to Covid-19 into those that “do” create a higher risk of severe illness and those that “might” \ncreate such a risk.  When the TRO was drafted, all the conditions listed in the class definition were \ndeemed by the CDC to place the individual at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.   \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 332   Filed 01/19/21   Page 11 of 23\nevidence from multiple small studies or a strong association from a large study.”13  Tier II \nconditions are supported by either “mixed evidence”—“[d]efined as multiple studies that reached \ndifferent conclusions about risk associated with a condition”—or “limited evidence”—“[d]efined \nas consistent evidence from a small number of studies.”14  Given these gradations in the quality \nof the evidence supporting particular risk factors and given that the Settlement Agreement \nrequires the BOP to keep the “National Health Technology Administrator—or a substitute \nmedical clinician . . . [as] a member of the [HCC] to assist in the Committee’s home confinement \nreviews,” ECF No. 134-1 at 10-11, I find that the Settlement Agreement’s command to assign \n“substantial weight” to an inmate’s risk factors based on CDC guidance must be understood to \nleave some discretion to the BOP in determining each inmate’s risk profile.  The presence of a \nmedical professional on the HCC means that the BOP is in a better position than the class or the \nCourt to make that determination.  As a result, although the BOP must give “substantial weight” \nto each risk factor, the agency retains some discretion in the precise amount of weight to assign \nto each factor based on CDC guidance, a specific inmate’s medical history, and the input of the \nmedical professional on the HCC.  And this discretion may frequently, and properly, result in a \nfinding that an inmate’s Tier II conditions are outweighed by public safety considerations, even \nwhen the same public safety considerations would not outweigh Tier I medical conditions. \nThe above-quoted language the BOP is apparently using when an inmate has only Tier II \nrisk factors does not unambiguously show, however, that the BOP is properly acting within its \ndiscretion under the Settlement Agreement.  The BOP undoubtedly knows that all the inmates it \nis reviewing suffer from some condition that makes them “medically vulnerable” enough to be in \n \n13 Scientific Evidence for Conditions that Increase Risk of Severe Illness, Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (last visited January 12, 2021), available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-\nextra-precautions/evidence-table.html. \n14 Id. \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 332   Filed 01/19/21   Page 12 of 23\nthe class, and, as I explain below, the Settlement Agreement does not demand that the BOP \nexplain itself in detailed, precise terms.  Nonetheless, saying of every inmate with only Tier II \nconditions that he or she “does not have risk factors that would put [him or her] at higher risk of \ndeveloping severe illness as a result of COVID-19” leaves open the possibility that the BOP \nbelieves that an inmate with Tier II conditions faces zero increased risk of severe illness from \nCOVID-19 or that the BOP is simply overlooking the facts—the inmate’s Tier II conditions.  \nEither possibility would violate the requirement that the BOP assign “substantial weight” to the \ninmate’s COVID-19 risk factors.  As a result, because the BOP’s “does not have risk factors” \nlanguage makes it impossible to determine whether it is complying with the requirement to \naccord substantial weight to an inmate’s CDC risk factors, I find that the worksheets using that \nphrase fail to demonstrate that the BOP has complied with the Settlement Agreement.  \nOrdinarily, in this situation, I would require the BOP to re-review specific inmates for \nhome confinement, as the Settlement Agreement authorizes me to do.  See ECF No. 134-1 at 17.  \nBut a court’s authority to award specific performance is an equitable power, Restatement \n(Second) of Contracts, § 358 cmt. a., and I do not believe it would be equitable to issue such \nsweeping relief here.  The BOP has limited resources, and it should not be required to divert its \nstaff to filling out worksheets more carefully just to demonstrate compliance with the Settlement \nAgreement, even when the underlying litigation is prompted by a public health emergency.  It is \nnot at all clear that ordering re-reviews will make a difference for many inmates.  For example, \nfor inmates whose conditions barely qualify them for Tier II status (such as someone whose BMI \nbarely exceeds 25) or for inmates who, though they have serious co-morbidities, also have \ncriminal records, offenses of conviction, or disciplinary histories that raise serious public safety \nconcerns, there would be little point in requiring a re-review.  As noted, under the Settlement \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 332   Filed 01/19/21   Page 13 of 23\nAgreement, as long as it is weighing the correct considerations and assigning some level of \n“substantial weight” to COVID-19 risk factors, the BOP has plenary discretion to read the scale \nand determine whether a particular public safety consideration outweighs a particular COVID-19  \nrisk factor.  It thus would not be equitable to require a re-review in cases where the BOP violated \nthe “substantial weight” requirement by invoking the formula quoted above but other facts \napparent from the face of the worksheet make it likely the violation was harmless.15  As a result, \nthe parties shall meet and confer to identify specific inmates whose individual cases (1) contain \nthe “does not have risk factors” language, and (2) otherwise are strong candidates for re-review.  \nThen, after the parties have agreed upon a list of inmates whose cases contain this error and who \notherwise warrant re-review, the BOP shall re-review that list of inmates for home confinement \nin accordance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement.16 \n \n \n \n15 See, e.g., ECF No. 298 at 60 (O.F., who has two Tier II conditions (28 percent BMI and hypertension), \nwas denied home confinement in part because O.F. “does not have any risk factors that would put \n[him/her] at a higher risk of developing severe illness as a result of COVID-19 based on CDC \nguidelines.”  But O.F.’s worksheet also lists “Past Violence- Assault and Battery with a dangerous \nweapon, 5/23/00”, a “Medium Risk of Recidivism-based on Pattern Score”, and “no viable release plan . . \n. .”  Id.  It is not difficult to imagine that, even on re-review, the BOP would be well within its discretion \nto deny O.F. home confinement under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, assuming that the \nworksheet does not contain material factual errors or omissions.). \n16 The class also seeks an order directing the BOP to “[e]xplicitly consider an individual’s age as a CDC \nrisk factor to be afforded ‘substantial weight’ for any class member over the age of 50, in conjunction \nwith all other CDC medical risk factors . . . .”  ECF No. 296 at 33 ¶ (a)(ii).  But the class makes no \nallegation that the BOP fails to list an inmate’s age on the worksheet, or that the BOP has refused to re-\nreview an inmate for home confinement based on a factual error related to age.  Further, the class does not \nidentify anything in the Settlement Agreement, the TRO, the CDC guidelines or elsewhere that supports \nits cut-off at the age of 50.  The CDC views age as a sliding scale of increasing risk from COVID-19 as \none gets older, but it does not set clear age cut-offs.  Older Adults, Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html.  As a \nresult, I find that a worksheet is adequate under the Settlement Agreement as to an inmate’s age as long as \nit correctly lists the inmate’s age and otherwise appears to provide substantial weight to that inmate’s \nCDC risk factors.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 332   Filed 01/19/21   Page 14 of 23\n3.  Percentage of Time Served and Disciplinary History \nThe parties disagree as to whether the BOP may rely on certain factors, including \npercentage or amount of time served or an inmate’s disciplinary history that is both non-violent \nand non-sexual, in denying a class member home confinement.  Thus, the class seeks an order \ndirecting the BOP to “[n]ot rely in home confinement decisions on factors that are only \ntangentially related to public safety, including percentage or amount of time served or recent \ndisciplinary history that is both non-violent and non-sexual[.]”  ECF No. 296 at 34 ¶ (a)(vi).  I \nagree with the class that these factors bear no clear or necessary relationship to public safety.   \nThe percentage or amount of time an inmate has served bears no necessary relationship to \npublic safety, properly understood.  The BOP argues in its brief that the earlier in an inmate’s \nsentence he or she is released, the greater the “flight” risk he or she presents.  But this is \nspeculative; the BOP has presented no data suggesting that any inmates released to home \nconfinement have fled the jurisdiction to which they have been released.  In any event, the HCC \ndoes not invoke the “flight” argument in any of its references to percentage of time served in the \nworksheets, and thus the argument appears to be a post-hoc rationalization offered by counsel, \nrather than the HCC’s own rationale for denying transfer to home confinement.  Rather, it \nappears that when the HCC cites percentage or amount of time served in the worksheets, it does \nso as a measure of the degree to which the portion of the sentence served has reflected the \n“seriousness of the offense.”17  This is a relevant consideration under the statute governing \nfederal sentencing, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), but it is not under the Settlement Agreement, which \nfocuses on balancing public safety and inmate safety.  Thus, the BOP may not rely on this \nconsideration in denying transfers to home confinement or, if it does so, it must offer a more \n \n17 See, e.g., ECF No. 298 at 20 (M.B., who had served 12.0 percent of the statutory time, was denied home \nconfinement in part because the “current percentage of time served diminishes the seriousness of the offense.”). \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 332   Filed 01/19/21   Page 15 of 23\ndetailed explanation demonstrating a connection between percentage of time served and public \nsafety, properly understood.   \nDisciplinary incidents are more naturally relevant to public safety, especially when they \ninvolve violence, threats of violence (including making weapons), or sexual transgressions.  In \naddition, a pattern of breaking even minor or technical rules can demonstrate an inability to \nconform one’s conduct to the law that could pose a risk to the public safety.  But it is hard to see \nhow one or two minor and non-violent disciplinary infractions, or even a greater number of very \nold infractions, could establish such a pattern.18  So if the BOP is going to rely on disciplinary \nincidents, the worksheet must make clear why they are related to public safety.  In some cases—\nas when the worksheet indicates that the disciplinary incident involved an assault—this will be \nobvious.  But when it is not obvious, the BOP must provide more explanation to show that it has \nfulfilled its balancing duties under the Settlement Agreement. \nAs a result, I find that the BOP has violated the terms of the Settlement Agreement when \nit has relied on percentage or amount of time served or a disciplinary history that is non-violent, \nnon-sexual, and not part of a pattern of misconduct demonstrating an inability to follow the law.   \nAgain, although the Settlement Agreement authorizes me to order a comprehensive re-\nreview in these cases, I find that a more focused remedy would be more efficient and practical, \nand thus more equitable.  Thus, I again order the parties to meet and confer to identify specific \ninmates whose individual home confinement cases (1) were denied at least in part because of the \npercentage or amount of time served or because of a disciplinary history that is non-violent, non-\nsexual, and does not shown a clear pattern of misconduct suggesting an inability to follow the \n \n18 See, e.g., ECF No. 298 at 236-37 (B.W., whose worksheet provided a disciplinary history as follows: \n“Yes. 06-19-2020[;] Code 316 Being in Unauthorized Area[;] Code 332 Smoking in Unauthorized \nArea.”—absent a more detailed explanation, smoking and being in an unauthorized area once in the past \nyear is not a relevant public safety consideration under the Settlement Agreement). \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 332   Filed 01/19/21   Page 16 of 23\nlaw, and (2) who are otherwise strong candidates for re-review, i.e., those whose worksheets do \nnot otherwise raise significant concerns about public safety, properly understood.  Then, after the \nparties have agreed upon a list of inmates whose cases contain one or more of these errors and \notherwise merit re-review, the BOP shall re-review that list of inmates for home confinement in \naccordance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement.  It is my hope that the parties will focus \nthe re-review process on the inmates who face the greatest dangers from COVID-19 and are least \nlikely to present a danger to public safety. \n4.  Low PATTERN Scores \nThe parties also disagree as to the relevance to public safety of a “Low” score on the \nBOP’s “PATTERN” risk assessment tool, which is aimed at predicting whether an inmate will \nreoffend based on several characteristics or “risk factors”.  The tool assigns each inmate to one \nof four categories for risk of recidivism: minimum, low, medium, or high.  A “Low” PATTERN \nscore is supposed to indicate a higher risk of recidivism than a “minimum” score.  The class \nseeks an order directing the BOP to “[n]ot rely in home confinement decisions on a ‘Low’ \nPATTERN Score as a basis to deny home confinement to class members[.]”  ECF No. 296 at 34 \n¶ (a)(v).  As the Government points out, however, the risk of recidivism is plainly related to \npublic safety, and the BOP uses an inmate’s PATTERN score to estimate that risk.  The class has \ncriticized the reliability of the PATTERN tool, and others have done so as well.  See, e.g., \nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/bill-barr-promised-to-release-prisoners-threatened-by-\ncoronavirus-even-as-the-feds-secretly-made-it-harder-for-them-to-get-out.  But while the tool \nmay be imperfect, the BOP is using it to gauge a factor relevant to public safety, i.e., risk of \nrecidivism,19 and the Settlement Agreement leaves to the BOP the determination of how much \n \n19 As discussed above, not all types of recidivism pose identical risks to public safety, properly \nunderstood.  See note 4, supra. \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 332   Filed 01/19/21   Page 17 of 23\nweight to accord a particular PATTERN score, as this is part of the substantive determination of \nwhether it is appropriate to transfer an inmate to home confinement.  While the BOP may not \ncategorically deny inmates home confinement on the basis of a particular PATTERN score, \nbecause doing so would not reflect an individualized balancing of public safety against inmate \nsafety, it is free to rely on an inmate’s PATTERN score, including a “Low” score, in its weighing \nanalysis.  As a result, I deny the class’s request for an order prohibiting the BOP from relying in \npart on an inmate’s Low PATTERN score in denying a class member home confinement. \nThat said, there may be individual cases where the Settlement Agreement requires more \nexplanation when a denial rests primarily on a Low PATTERN score.  Again, the BOP’s task is \nto determine which weighs more heavily in a particular case – the risk to the inmate or the risk to \nthe public safety.  To show that it has performed this task, the BOP needs to make some showing \non the worksheet that it has decided that one risk outweighs the other.  Thus, for example, where \na “low PATTERN score” is the only factor being relied upon (or the only factor other than \npercentage of time served or some other non-public-safety-related consideration), and the inmate \nhas multiple Tier I risk factors, the BOP will likely need to provide more detail about why it has \nread the scale to tilt against transfer to home confinement.20  At the end of the day, it is within \nBOP’s discretion to make that determination, but, as discussed below, the Settlement Agreement \nrequires some explanation of the factual basis for its decisions.  So the higher the risk to the \n \n20 See https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0625-update-expands-covid-19.html (“The more \nunderlying medical conditions people have, the higher their risk.”); see also, e.g., ECF No. 298 at 47 \n(K.D., 37 years old, whose worksheet shows one Tier I risk factor (BMI of 44.8 percent) and two Tier II \nrisk factors (hypertension, asthma), no history of violence or sexual offenses, a minimum security level, \nno history of discipline or escape, and an apparently valid release plan, was denied home confinement \n“due to her low recidivism risk level, as well as the percentage of time served for the offense.”).  Based \non the worksheet, it is not obvious why these two factors present a danger to public safety that outweighs \nK.D.’s risk of severe illness from COVID-19, or that the BOP complied with its obligations under the \nSettlement Agreement to accord substantial weight to an inmate’s CDC risk factors and provide a factual \nbasis, relevant to public safety, that outweighs the risk to inmate safety. \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 332   Filed 01/19/21   Page 18 of 23\ninmate or the fewer (or lighter) the public safety considerations, the more the BOP will be \nrequired to explain why it denied the transfer to home confinement to demonstrate that it \ncomplied with its balancing obligation.21   \nB.  The Settlement Agreement Does Not Require Lengthy “Case Narratives” \n  The parties also disagree about the quality of the explanations the BOP has provided on \nthe worksheets when denying home confinement.  Specifically, the class seeks an order directing \nthe BOP to: (1) reflect its consideration of an inmate’s CDC risk factors “in the case narrative or \nreasons for denial provided by the BOP”; (2) reflect its consideration of an inmate’s age as a \nCDC risk factor “in the case narrative or reasons for denial provided by the BOP”; (3) “[r]eflect \nin any home confinement denial that ‘substantial weight’ was actually given to the individual’s \nCDC risk factors and include an explanation of why these risk factors are overcome by \nsubstantial evidence of countervailing public safety considerations;” (4) “provide an \nindividualized explanation of the reasons why the public safety concerns specific to the \nindividual class member’s circumstances are sufficient to overcome their serious medical \nvulnerability to COVID-19”; and (5) “[n]ot rely in home confinement decisions on any exclusion \npreviously lifted by this Court’s TRO as the sole basis for denying home confinement, such as \ndisciplinary history or offense of conviction, unless the BOP details the nature of the underlying \nfactual circumstances and why they raise substantial evidence of countervailing public safety \nconsiderations sufficient to overcome the individual’s serious medical vulnerability to COVID-\n19”.  See ECF No. 296 at 33-34 ¶¶ (a)(i)-(ii), (a)(iv), (a)(vii).  I find that the Settlement \n \n21 In its supplemental memorandum, the class also seeks relief limiting the BOP’s consideration of the \nlack of a viable release plan and certain supervision-related requirements.  ECF No. 307 at 29.  For the \nreasons set forth in the Government’s brief, ECF No. 324 at 2-7, I deny this request.  I encourage the \nparties to meet and confer to discuss any specific cases related to this request for relief the class believes \nwarrant a reexamination.   \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 332   Filed 01/19/21   Page 19 of 23\nAgreement does not, in general, require a lengthy explanation of a home confinement denial as \nlong as the worksheet, taken as a whole, presents a sufficient factual basis to infer that the BOP \ndetermined that public safety factors, properly understood and supported by the facts, \noutweighed the risk of severe illness to the inmate from COVID-19. \nThe Settlement Agreement states that if the HCC denies home confinement, “it will \ncomply with the May 12, 2020 TRO regarding a written explanation of the factual basis for any \nfactors relied upon for the denial.”  ECF No. 238-1 ¶ 11.  The only mention in the TRO of a \nwritten explanation states that the Warden must provide the Court with “an individualized \nexplanation for each denial of home confinement as to [a medically vulnerable inmate], \nincluding at least a brief description of the factual basis for any factors deemed to outweigh the \ndanger to the inmate from COVID 19.”  ECF No. 30 at 73; see also Settlement Agreement ¶ 10, \nECF No. 134-1 at 11 (“Respondent agrees that if she determines that [a class member] is not \neligible for home confinement, she will comply with the May 12, 2020 TRO and provide a \nwritten explanation of the factual basis for any factors relied upon for the denial.”).  The \nSettlement Agreement also states that the BOP will provide class counsel with “copies of the \ndocuments generated” in the home confinement review process, including the worksheets and \n“the reason for denial,” and that “the form of the documents produced under this Section will be \nconsistent with the worksheets that have been disclosed in this litigation (see, e.g., ECF 59).”  Id. \n¶ 11.  The worksheets “disclosed in this litigation” are one-page documents consisting primarily \nof a table listing the inmate’s COVID risk factors, age, current or past offenses, percentage of \ntime served, pending charges or detainers, security level, recent discipline, PATTERN score, and \nother related information.  Below the table there is a “case narrative,” a “home confinement \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 332   Filed 01/19/21   Page 20 of 23\ncommittee review,” or both, each consisting of two or three sentences indicating reasons the \nBOP deemed the individual appropriate or inappropriate for home confinement.  \nWhen the Settlement Agreement is read as a whole, I find that each worksheet generated \nby the BOP to document its decision must be sufficient to identify the facts supporting its \nconclusion that, in the case of a denial, public safety factors outweighed the danger to the inmate \nfrom COVID-19.  This is not an exacting standard.  It does not require the BOP to explain its \ndecision in anything approaching the level of detail one would expect from a legal opinion.  To \nthe contrary, the reference to the form of the documents being consistent with the worksheets \ndisclosed in the litigation makes clear that what is expected is, as described above, a table format \nlisting information in various categories and then an explanation of a couple of sentences at the \nbottom providing further explanation of the factors the HCC found most weighty.  I agree with \nthe Government that the proper way to evaluate whether these worksheets comply with the \nSettlement Agreement is to read them as a whole and not to interpret the explanation at the \nbottom as a comprehensive summary of the HCC’s reasons for denial.  At the same time, to be \ncompliant with the Agreement, there needs to be enough information in the table and the \nnarrative at the bottom, taken together, to enable the reader to glean the facts upon which the \nBOP relied in deciding that public safety factors outweighed the danger to the inmate.  Thus, \nneither the “case narrative” nor the “home confinement committee review” at the bottom of the \nworksheet need list every CDC risk factor or every public safety factor, invoke the words \n“substantial weight” or “outweighs,” or incant other similar formulas.  The critical point is that \neither the facts shown in the table or the narrative explanations below the table, or both, must \nidentify the facts weighed on each side of the scale.  Again, rather than order a re-review of all \nthe worksheets that do not satisfy this modest standard, I direct the parties to meet and confer and \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 332   Filed 01/19/21   Page 21 of 23\nidentify the non-compliant worksheets for the strongest candidates for home confinement, based \non the public safety/inmate safety standards discussed in this opinion, and arrange for a re-\nreview of the cases of those inmates.   \nC. The Settlement Agreement Requires the BOP to Review for Home Confinement \nClass Members Who Are Transferred to Other Prisons. \n \nLastly, the parties disagree as to whether inmates who qualify as class members but are \nsubsequently transferred to a facility other than FCI Danbury are eligible for home confinement \nreview under the Settlement Agreement.  As a result of this disagreement, the class seeks an \n“[o]rder [directing] the BOP to not refuse to conduct a home confinement review or a re-review \nfor any recognized class member it transfers out of FCI Danbury[.]”  ECF No. 296 at 35 ¶ (d).  \nThe Government opposes this order because, it contends, the intent of the Settlement Agreement \nwas to provide home confinement only to inmates currently at FCI Danbury.  I agree with the \nclass. \nThe Settlement Agreement defines the class as “consisting of any person incarcerated at \nFCI Danbury anytime from the Effective Date until the termination date of this Agreement, \nOctober 31, 2021 . . .” who is either a List 1 or List 2 inmate, or who possesses one or more Tier \n1 or Tier 2 COVID-19 risk factors as determined by the CDC.  ECF No. 134-1 at 5-6.  This \ndefinition plainly applies to any inmate who was at FCI Danbury and who otherwise qualified as \na class member, regardless of the length of time the inmate spent at FCI Danbury or whether the \ninmate remains at FCI Danbury.  No other provision in the Settlement Agreement addresses \ninmates transferred out of FCI Danbury to another prison.  As a result, the Settlement Agreement \nrequires the BOP to consider for home confinement inmates transferred out of FCI Danbury to \nanother prison, as long as such inmates otherwise qualified as class members at some point prior \nto the transfer.   \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 332   Filed 01/19/21   Page 22 of 23\nThe fact that the Warden of FCI Danbury no longer has authority over inmates \ntransferred to another facility does not change the analysis.  The BOP itself is a party to the \nSettlement Agreement and is bound by its terms.  It is not excused from complying with the \nAgreement simply because a class member has been transferred to a prison that was not the \nsubject of the underlying lawsuit and is outside the District of Connecticut, and the BOP has \npointed to nothing that would prevent it from effectuating the transfer to home confinement of \nsuch an inmate.  It is true, as the BOP noted at oral argument, that the inmate’s overall risk \nprofile may have changed due to, for example, a higher or lower infection rate of COVID-19 at \nthe inmate’s new facility; but I know of no reason the Home Confinement Committee should not \nbe able to take such changed circumstances into account in making its decisions.   \nII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons and to the extent stated above, the class’s motion to enforce the \nsettlement agreement (ECF No. 296) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART, as \nfollows: \n(1) Within 14 days of this Order, the parties shall meet and confer to identify specific \nclass members whose cases warrant re-review under the terms of this Order and the \nSettlement Agreement; and \n(2) Within 14 days of such identification, the BOP shall conduct a re-review of inmates \nidentified under paragraph (1) for home confinement under the terms of the \nSettlement Agreement, except that, if for some good reason the BOP cannot meet that \ndeadline, it shall inform class counsel of that good reason before expiration of the 14 \ndays.   \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 332   Filed 01/19/21   Page 23 of 23\n(3) To the extent the parties are unable to agree on the class members whose cases \nwarrant re-review under paragraph (1), they shall utilize the mechanisms specified in \nthe Settlement Agreement for resolving such disagreements. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \n \n    /s/   \n  Michael P.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE / HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDING \n  The original petitioners1 brought this action, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241, against the \nWarden of FCI Danbury,2 on behalf of the class of all prisoners held at FCI Danbury who are at \nimminent risk of contracting COVID-19, which feeds on the unsafe, congregate conditions in \nwhich they are held.  Petitioners also identified a subclass of prisoners who are particularly at \nrisk because they have medical conditions identified by the United States Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention which put them at heightened risk of serious illness or death if they \n                                                           \n1   This action was originally brought by four named petitioners: Dianthe Martinez-Brooks, \nRejeanne Collier, Jackie Madore and Kenneth Cassidy.  As required by this Court’s May 12, 2020 \nTemporary Restraining Order as well as subsequent Orders, the Bureau of Prisons began a process of \nidentifying prisoners eligible and appropriate for home confinement under the criteria set forth by the \nCourt in its Order and released a number of the prisoners so reviewed, including two of the original \nnamed petitioners in this action.  Mr. Cassidy was released via a compassionate release order on May 13, \n2020.  Dianthe Martinez-Brooks, and Rejeanne Collier were released in June 2020.  Counsel filed a \nvoluntary dismissal of Mr. Cassidy’s claims pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a) on June 4, 2020 [ECF No. \n76] and filed voluntary dismissals for Ms. Martinez-Brooks and Ms. Collier on June 12, 2020 [ECF Nos. \n105 and 106]. \nAt a telephonic status conference with the parties on June 5, 2020, the Court and the parties \nagreed that petitioners would file a Rule 21 motion to add parties to protect against a potential procedural \ndefault in the event that the final class representative was likewise released.  On June 15, 2020, \npetitioners’ Rule 21 Motion was granted by the Court [ECF No. 108], and on June 16, petitioners filed an \nAmended Petition [ECF No. 111] naming Amanda Cooper and James Whitted (along with original \npetitioner Jackie Madore) as named class representatives.   \nMs. Madore and Ms. Cooper have subsequently been released from FCI Danbury, see voluntary \ndismissals at ECF Nos. 130 and 130, leaving Mr. Whitted as the sole named class representative.   \nThis memorandum will use plural term “petitioners” in reference to allegations made or relief \nsought in prior pleadings filed when there were multiple named representatives. \n \n2   Michael Carvajal, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, was also originally named as a \nrespondent, but petitioners voluntarily dismissed their claims against Carvajal. [ECF No. 50]. \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134   Filed 08/03/20   Page 3 of 17\ncontract the disease.  Petitioners allege that the fact of their confinement in light of the dangers of \nCOVID-19 violates their Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment. \n  The petition and the subsequently filed Motion for Temporary Restraining Order sought a \ntwo-part response to the COVID dangers facing the class of all prisoners and the subclass of \nmedically vulnerable prisoners at FCI Danbury.   \n  First, petitioners contended that the Bureau of Prisons has failed to make full and \nsufficient use of the authority accorded it to transfer prisoners to home confinement to protect \nthem against COVID-19 at FCI Danbury despite explicit directives from the Attorney General of \nthe United States that it should make aggressive use of that authority to transfer appropriate \nprisoners to home confinement on an expedited basis.  To cure that failure, petitioners sought \norders requiring FCI Danbury to identify and undertake the immediate transfer of the most \nmedically vulnerable individuals to home confinement or other appropriate settings.   \n  Second, petitioners contended that FCI Danbury had failed to implement  measures \nnecessary to protect the prison population from COVID-19 infection.  Petitioners further \ncontended that FCI Danbury's failure to respond to the COVID-19 epidemic has further put \npetitioners and putative class members at unacceptably heightened risk of injury and illness \nunrelated to COVID-19. With respect to these failures, petitioners sought immediate \nimplementation for those who remain at FCI Danbury of the social distancing and hygiene \nmeasures essential to lowering the risk of the disease and of death and necessary improvements \nin the system of health care delivery at Danbury.   \n  On May 12, 2020, this Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order granting in part \npetitioners’ request for provisional remedies.  The Court found that the facts regarding the \nBureau of Prison’s use of its home confinement authority are largely undisputed and held that \nthose facts establish that officials at FCI Danbury have been making only limited use of their \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134   Filed 08/03/20   Page 4 of 17\nhome confinement authority, as well as other tools at their disposal to protect inmates during the \noutbreak.  \n  Accordingly, the Court entered an Order provisionally certifying the following class of \nindividuals who are medically vulnerable to COVID-19 in accordance with CDC guidelines: \nAll individuals in custody at FCI Danbury, while the threat of COVID-19 \nat the facility remains, who are aged 65 or over and/or who have any of \nthe following conditions specifically identified by the United States \nCenters for Disease Control as putting them at higher risk for severe \nillness from COVID-19: (a) chronic lung disease including moderate to \nsevere asthma, COPD, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, idiopathic \npulmonary fibrosis and/or cystic fibrosis; (b) immunocompromised status, \nincluding status as a transplant recipient, on chemotherapy, HIV positive, \nprolonged use of corticosteroids, using immunosuppressive medication, \nand/or having an immune deficiency; (c) severe obesity (BMI of 40 or \nhigher); (d) diabetes mellitus Type I or Type II, (e) gestational diabetes \nmellitus; (f) chronic kidney disease on dialysis; (g) chronic liver diseases, \ncirrhosis; and/or (h) serious heart conditions, including congestive heart \nfailure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, \nand/or pulmonary hypertension.\"   \n \nECF No. 30 at pp. 65-66 n.32.  The Court ordered expedited consideration of home confinement \nfor all such medically vulnerable class members, and set forth standards for determining their \nsuitability for home confinement release.  The Court subsequently entered additional Orders \npertaining to the home confinement review of the medically vulnerable class. [See, e.g., ECF \nNos. 68, 70].  The Court further scheduled an evidentiary hearing on petitioners’ Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction.3  \n  On May 15, 2020, as required by the TRO, respondent filed an initial list identifying 314 \ninmates who are potential members of the Medically Vulnerable Class. [ECF No. 41 (“List One \nInmates”)].4   Respondent identified the 314 List One Inmates by searching the BOP’s record \n                                                           \n3   That hearing, originally scheduled for June 11 and 12, was subsequently continued in light of the \nCourt’s referral of the parties to Magistrate Judge Thomas Farrish for settlement discussions. \n \n4   Under the parties’ Settlement Agreement, the 314 inmates identified as potential members of the \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134   Filed 08/03/20   Page 5 of 17\nsystems using a list of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes identified by petitioner’s counsel as representing \nconditions specifically identified by the CDC as putting a person at higher risk for severe illness \nfrom COVID-19. \n  As a result of further discussions among the parties concerning the identification of \nmedically vulnerable individuals missed in the initial search, respondent ran a second search of \nBOP’s record systems, again using a list of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes identified by petitioner’s \ncounsel as representing conditions specifically identified by the CDC as putting a person at \nhigher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, which resulted in a list of 111 additional inmates \nwho are also potential members of the Medically Vulnerable Class. Subsequently, at petitioner’s \ncounsel’s request, respondent agreed to add an additional 14 inmates to the second list of inmates \nwho are potential members of the Medically Vulnerable Class (“List Two Inmates”).5 \n  While the parties were engaged in settlement discussions with Magistrate Judge Farrish, \nthe CDC refined its guidance on medical conditions that increase an individual’s risk of severe \nillness from COVID-19.  Under its updated guidance, set forth at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-\nconditions.html, the CDC distinguishes between conditions that are scientifically established to \nincrease risk of severe illness from COVID-19 (designated as “Tier I medical conditions” in the \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nMedically Vulnerable Class are included as members of the proposed certified Settlement Class and are \ndesignated as “Medically Vulnerable Class List One Inmates” or “List One Inmates.  In accordance with \nthe terms of paragraph 4 of the Settlement Agreement, the parties’ proposed Settlement Class references \nthese individuals as “List One Inmates.” \n \n5   At the time it conducted this supplemental search, respondent did not concede that the individuals \nidentified by that second search were necessarily medically vulnerable consistent with CDC guidance.  \nUnder the parties’ Settlement Agreement, respondent has agreed to treat these individuals as medically \nvulnerable and the 125 inmates identified as potential members of the Medically Vulnerable Class are \nincluded as actual members of the proposed certified Settlement Class and are designated as “Medically \nVulnerable Class List Two Inmates” or “List Two Inmates.”  In accordance with the terms of paragraph 4 \nof the Settlement Agreement, the parties’ proposed certified Settlement Class references these individuals \nas “List Two Inmates.”  \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134   Filed 08/03/20   Page 6 of 17\nSettlement Agreement) and those for which there is still only limited data but which, on the basis \nof current available science, the CDC believes might put individuals at increased risk of severe \nillness from COVID-19 (designated as “Tier II medical conditions”).  Under the parties’ \nproposed settlement agreement, individuals with either Tier I or Tier II medical conditions who \nhave not yet been identified as List One or List Two Inmates – including, in particular, any \ninmates newly incarcerated at or transferred into FCI Danbury since the BOP’s ICD searches or \nthose with conditions that were not covered by the searches – are, likewise, included as members \nof the proposed certified Settlement Class. [A copy of the Settlement Agreement with redacted \nversions of the annexed exhibits  is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.]6  \n  Under the Settlement Agreement, members of the Medically Vulnerable Class will be \nentitled to home confinement review pursuant to the standards set forth in the Court’s May 12, \n2020 TRO [ECF. No. 30], including, inter alia, that (a) both Danbury and the Home \nConfinement Committee shall “assign substantial weight ... to the inmate’s risk factors for \nCOVID-19 based on CDC guidance,” that (b) a medical clinician shall participate in the home \nconfinement determination at the Home Confinement Committee, (c) that the factors considered \nin the home confinement determination will be set forth in Review Worksheets; and (d) that both \nFCI Danbury and the Home Confinement Committee will provide a written explanation of the \nfactual basis for any factors relied upon in a determination to deny home confinement.7\n                                                           \n6   The Settlement Agreement contains provisions for the identification and evaluation of potentially \nmedically vulnerable class members not previously included in List One or List Two (“Non-List \nInmates”). Except in extraordinary circumstances, individuals who have been in BOP custody for two \nyears or longer will be evaluated for qualifying conditions based exclusively on their BOP medical \nrecords; while individuals who have been incarcerated for less than two years may submit outside medical \nrecords.  The Settlement Agreement further provides a mechanism for newly admitted inmates to receive \nnotice of the settlement and the opportunity to execute authorizations to permit release of their medical \nrecords for consideration of their class eligibility. \n \n7   The Settlement Agreement also provides for reconsideration of home confinement denials shown \nto be based on a material error or mistake of fact or failure to otherwise follow the TRO standards as well \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134   Filed 08/03/20   Page 7 of 17\n  Petitioner now seeks an order pursuant to Fed. R. Civ P. 23(c)(1)(C)  certifying the \nproposed Class for settlement purposes. Respondent consents to the granting of plaintiffs’ \nMotion and to the certification of the proposed class for settlement purposes.    \nII.   ARGUMENT \n  As this Court has previously noted, although the class action device should not be \nimported into habeas corpus proceeding to the full limits contemplated by Rule 23, see ECF No. \n30 at 62, the Second Circuit has endorsed “the power of the judiciary ... to fashion for habeas \nactions appropriate modes of procedure, by analogy to existing rules,” including Rule 23. Id., \nquoting U.S. ex. Rel. Sero v. Preiser, 506 F.2d 1115, 1125 (2d Cir. 1974).  Thus, although the \nprecise provisions of Rule 23 are not specifically applicable to this habeas proceeding, \nconsideration of the Rule 23 factors may properly inform whether multi-party or “class” \ntreatment is appropriate in a habeas proceeding.  Id.   \n  A case may proceed as a multi-party or “class” action in this Court if all of the \nprerequisites of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and one or more of the subsections of Rule \n23(b) are satisfied: \nBefore approving a class settlement agreement, a district court must first \ndetermine whether the requirements for class certification in Rule 23(a) \nand (b) have been satisfied. See In re Pet Food Prods. Liab. Litig., 629 \nF.3d 333, 341 (3d Cir. 2010). Thus, the court must assess whether the \nproposed class satisfies Rule 23(a)'s four threshold requirements: (1) \nnumerosity (“the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable”), (2) commonality (“there are questions of law or fact \ncommon to the class”), (3) typicality (“the claims or defenses of the \nrepresentative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class”), \nand (4) adequacy of representation (“the representative parties will fairly \nand adequately protect the interests of the class”). Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  \n \nIn re American Intern. Group, Inc. Securities Litigation, 689 F.3d 229, 238 (2d Cir. 2012). \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nas reconsideration of denials where there has been a change in a circumstance which informed the prior \ndenial, i.e., a new suitable release plan not previously available or the resolution of an outstanding \ncriminal charge or detainer. \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134   Filed 08/03/20   Page 8 of 17\n  Both the United States Supreme Court and the Second Circuit have expressly approved \nthe propriety of certifying a class solely for purposes of a class action settlement. Amchem \nProds., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 618 (1997); American Intern. Group, 689 F.3d at 238-39; \nWeinberger v. Kendrick, 698 F.2d 61, 73 (2d Cir. 1982). See also In re Marsh & McLennan \nCos., Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 04 Civ. 8144 (CM), 2009 WL 5178546, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, \n2009); In re SCOR Holding (Switzerland) AG Litig., 537 F. Supp.2d 556 (S.D.N.Y. 2008). \nIndeed, certification of a settlement class “has been recognized throughout the country as the \nbest, most practical way to effectuate settlements involving large numbers of claims by relatively \nsmall claimants.” In re Prudential Sec. Inc., Ltd. P'ships Litig., 163 F.R.D. 200, 205 (S.D.N.Y. \n1995). “[S]ettlement classes are favored when there is little or no likelihood of abuse, and the \nsettlement is fair and reasonable and under the scrutiny of the trial judge.” Id. (quoting In re Beef \nIndus. Antitrust Litig., 607 F.2d 167, 174 (5th Cir. 1979)). \n  A district court “[c]onfronted with a request for settlement-only class certification ... need \nnot inquire whether the case, if tried, would present intractable management problems, for the \nproposal is that there be no trial.” American Intern. Group, 689 F.3d at 239, quoting Amchem, \n521 U.S. at 620.  However, in the settlement context “other specifications of [Rule 23]—those \ndesigned to protect absentees by blocking unwarranted or overbroad class definitions—demand \nundiluted, even heightened, attention.” Id. \n  It is well-settled that the relevant inquiry for class certification is not whether plaintiffs \nare likely to prevail on the merits of their claims, but rather, whether the requirements of Rule 23 \nare met. Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 178 (1974) (“In determining the propriety \nof a class action, the question is not whether the plaintiff or plaintiffs have stated a cause of \naction or will prevail on the merits, but rather whether the requirements of Rule 23 are met”); see \nalso In re Initial Public Offering Sec. Litig., 471 F .3d 24, 41 (2d Cir. 2006) (class certification \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134   Filed 08/03/20   Page 9 of 17\nmotion should not become pretext for partial trial of the merits). In applying Rule 23, courts are \nto use a liberal, not restrictive, construction. Marisol A. v. Guiliani, 126 F.3d 372, 377 (2d Cir. \n1997). \n  This case is appropriate for certification of a medically vulnerable class for settlement \npurposes, as it indisputably meets the four prerequisites of Rule 23(a), as well as all of the \nrequirements of Rule 23(b)(3). \n  A.   The Proposed Class \n  Petitioner seeks certification of the following proposed settlement class:   \n    any person incarcerated at FCI Danbury anytime from the Effective Date \n[of the parties’ Settlement Agreement (July 27, 2020)] until the \ntermination date of [the] Agreement, October 31, 2021, unless otherwise \nmodified by the parties pursuant to the terms of [the] Agreement who \neither (a) is a List One Inmate or List Two Inmate, or (b) possesses one or \nmore underlying medical conditions which, according to current CDC \nguidance (i.e., the CDC guidance in effect at the time of the individual's \nhome confinement review), either (i) places that inmate at increased risk \nof severe illness from COVID-19 (\"Tier 1 medical conditions\"); or (ii) \nmight place that inmate at an increased risk of severe illness from COVID-\n19 (\"Tier 2 medical conditions\").  \n \n  B.   The Proposed Class Satisfies the Four Prerequisites of Rule 23(a) \n \nRule 23(a) provides: \n \n(a) Prerequisites. One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as \nrepresentative parties on behalf of all members only if: \n \n(1)   the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable; \n \n    (2)   there are questions of law or fact common to the class; \n \n  (3)   the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the \nclaims or defenses of the class; and \n \n(4)   the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \nthe class. \n \n  Each of these prerequisites is fully satisfied in this case. \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134   Filed 08/03/20   Page 10 of 17\n1.   Numerosity \nThere is no mechanical test for determining whether in a particular case the class is so \nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  To meet the numerosity requirement, one \nneed only show that it is difficult or inconvenient to join all members of the class. Cent. States \nSE. & SW. Areas Health and Welfare Fund v. Merck-Medco Managed Care, L.L.C., 504 F.3d \n229, 244-45 (2d Cir. 2007). The issue is one for the court to be resolved in light of the facts and \ncircumstances of the case. Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 935 (2d Cir. 1993) (citing 1 \nHerbert B. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions: A Manual for Group Litigation at Federal and \nState Levels §3.05, at 141-42 (2d ed. 1985)). The “difficulty in joining as few as 40 class \nmembers should raise a presumption that joinder is impracticable.”  Id.; Consolidated Rail Corp. \nv. Town of Hyde Park, 47 F.3d 473, 483 (2d Cir. 1995) (holding that “numerosity is presumed at \na level of 40 members”); see also Marcera v. Chinlund, 595 F.2d 1231, 1238 (2d Cir.), judg. \nvacated on other grounds, 442 U.S. 915 (1979) (“[t]here is little doubt that the 42 sheriffs \nconstitute a group sufficiently large to meet the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a)(l)”); 3B \nJames W. Moore, et al., Moore’s Federal Practice if 23.05[1], at 139-45 (2d ed. 1987) (courts \ngenerally certify classes in excess of forty). As this Court noted earlier in this proceeding  \n  In this case at least 439 prisoners at FCI Danbury have already been identified as \nmembers of the proposed medically vulnerable class by virtue of their inclusion in List One and \nList Two based on respondent’s search of relevant ICD codes for CDC COVID-19 risk factors in \nthe BOP medical records database.  These 439 prisoners represent approximately 40 percent of \nthe pre-COVID census at the institution.  Extrapolating from this experience, it is reasonable to \nconclude that between 30 and 40 percent of new admissions to the institution between now and \nOctober 2021 will, likewise, be eligible for membership in the proposed medically vulnerable \nclass such that the final number of would be class members will almost certainly exceed 600.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134   Filed 08/03/20   Page 11 of 17\nThe size of the proposed class is plainly more than sufficient to meet the numerosity requirement \nof Rule 23(a). \n  In addition to class size, several other factors in this case suggest the impracticability of \njoinder and favor class certification. “Determination of practicability depends on all the \ncircumstances surrounding a case, not on mere numbers”\" Robidoux, 987 F.2d at 936.  \n  The considerations identified by the Second Circuit as relevant to determining the \npracticability of joinder include: \njudicial economy arising from the avoidance of a multiplicity of actions, \ngeographical dispersion of class members, financial resources of class \nmembers, the ability of claimants to institute individual suits, and requests \nfor prospective injunctive relief which would involve future class \nmembers. \n \nId.  These considerations also militate strongly in favor of a finding of numerosity here. \nConsolidation of these claims serves judicial economy because it obviates the need for hundreds \nof individual suits. See id. at 936 (judicial economy served by consolidating “what could be over \n100 individual suits”).  Joinder of the potential class members would also be impracticable \nbecause the members of the class are transient and subject to being dispersed throughout the \nBOP network of facilities.  See Westchester Independent Living Center, Inc. v. State University \nof New York, Purchase College, 331 F.R.D. 279, 291 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (“fluid composition” of \nSUNY's student body “weighs in favor of finding numerosity requirement satisfied”);  Clarkson \nv. Coughlin, 783 F. Supp. 789, 797 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) (“fluid composition” of prison population \nsupports certification).  The limited economic resources of the overwhelming majority of \nprisoners also militates strongly in favor of certification.  See Robidoux, 987 F.2d at 936 \n(“‘[w]here it is not economically feasible to obtain relief within the traditional framework of a \nmultiplicity of small individual suits for damages, aggrieved persons may be without any \neffective redress unless they may employ the class-action device’”) (quoting Deposit Guar. Nat'! \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134   Filed 08/03/20   Page 12 of 17\nBank v. Roper, 445 U.S. 326, 339 (1990)).  Finally, this action seeks prospective injunctive relief \nwhich would implicate the interests of future class members (who would also be at risk of \ninconsistent results from individual suits) – a consideration which weighs heavily in favor of \nclass certification.  Westchester Independent Living, 331 F.R.D. at 291.    \n2.   Common Questions of Law and Fact \nRule 23(a)(2) requires that the action contain questions of law or fact that are common to \nthe class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). “The commonality requirement [of Rule 23(a)(2)] is met if \nplaintiff's grievances share a common question of law or fact.” Robinson v. Metro-North \nCommuter R.R., 267 F.3d 147, 155 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting Marisol, 126 F.3d at ). This does not \nmean that all issues must be identical as to each class member. Rather, it requires plaintiffs \nsimply to “identify some unifying thread among the members’ claims that warrants class \ntreatment.” In re Flag Telecom Holdings, Ltd. Sec. Litig., 245 F.R.D. 147, 158 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) \n(quoting In re Vivendi, 242 F.R.D. at 84); In re NTL, Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 02 Civ. 3013 (LAK) \n(AJP), 2006 WL 330113, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 14, 2006).  The threshold for commonality is not \nhigh – it is only necessary to find at least one issue common to all class members. Marisol A., \n126 F.3d at 376 (“The commonality requirement is met if plaintiffs’ grievances share a common \nquestion of law or of fact”); see also Matyasovsky v. Housing Auth. of the City of Bridgeport, \n226 F.R.D. 35, 41 (D. Conn. 2005) (to establish commonality, “plaintiffs need not establish that \nall questions of law and fact among the putative class are identical”) (emphasis in original); In re \nPE Corp. Sec. Litig., 228 F.R.D. 102, I 08 (D. Conn. 2005) (test for commonality is “not \ndemanding”). \n  As this Court has previously noted, even applying the “more stringent standards” \nsuggested by the Second Circuit in Preiser, 506 F.2d at 1127, the medically vulnerable class \nproposed for settlement purposes satisfies the commonality requirement.  As the Court noted, all \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134   Filed 08/03/20   Page 13 of 17\nmembers of the class “are recognized as falling in the high-risk group as to which heightened \nprecautions are justified,” ECF No. 30 at 65, and the facts “regarding the process employed by \nthe Warden [and the BOP] in considering inmates for home confinement are common to the \nentire []class, as are the legal questions regarding whether the Warden [and the BOP]’s handling \nof those processes in these circumstances is constitutional.”  Id.; see, e.g, Karen L. v. Physicians \nHealth Serves., 202 F.R.D. 94, 100 (D. Conn. 2001) (“An alleged common course of conduct is \nsufficient to satisfy the common question requirement”) (citation omitted).  The relief sought is, \nlikewise, common throughout the class – i.e., expedited home confinement review pursuant to \nthe mandate of the Court’s May 12, 2020 TRO [ECF. No. 30], with due consideration (i.e., \n“substantial weight) assigned to each class member’s risk factors for COVID-19 based on CDC \nguidance, pursuant to procedures applied commonly to every home confinement review.  \n3.   Petitioner’s Claims are Typical of the Claims of the Class \n   Rule 23(a)(3) requires that “the claims or defenses of the representative parties [be] \ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). The requirement is \nsatisfied here because “each class member’s claim arises from the same course of events \n[application of respondent’s home confinement review process], and each class member makes \nsimilar legal arguments to prove the defendant’s liability.”  Cent. States SE. & SW. Areas Health \nand Welfare Fund, 504 F.3d at 245; accord Robidoux, 987 F.2d at 936-37 (“When it is alleged \nthat the same unlawful conduct was directed at or affected both the named plaintiff and the class \nsought to be represented, the typicality requirement is usually met irrespective of minor \nvariations in the fact patterns underlying individual claims.”).  \n4.   The Representative Plaintiffs and Their Counsel Will  \nFairly and Adequately Protect the Interests of the Class. \n \nThe final requirement of Rule 23(a) is that “the representative parties will fairly and \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134   Filed 08/03/20   Page 14 of 17\nadequately protect the interests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). In connection with Rule \n23(a)(4), courts in the Second Circuit consider whether the plaintiffs’ interests are antagonistic to \nthe class and whether class counsel is experienced and qualified.  Baffa v. Donaldson, Lufkin & \nJenrett Sec. Cmp., 222 F. 3d 52, 60 (2d Cir. 2000); In re Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, Inc., \n960 F.2d 285, 291 (2d Cir. 1992); see also Amchem Prods. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 624 \n( 1997) (inquiry “serves to uncover conflicts of interest between named plaintiffs and the class \nthey seek to represent”). \n  Mr. Whitted is an appropriate and adequate class representative for the proposed class of \nmedically vulnerable individuals who are or may be at increased risk of severe illness from \nCOVID-19.  Mr. Whitted suffers from asthma for which he currently uses two medicated \ninhalers.  He is also morbidly obese.  In 2018, Mr. Whitted suffered a fall which resulted in head \ntrauma, spinal damage, and permanent injury to his left leg for which he requires a custom brace.  \nAs a result of his injury he is required to use a walker and a cane to ambulate.  He is in need of \nphysical therapy to maintain leg function but has not received any such therapy since the onset of \nthe COVID-19 lockdown at FCI Danbury.   \n  Additionally, class counsel are “qualified, experienced and able to conduct the litigation” \nBaffa v.

The Proposed Settlement Class Satisfies the Requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) \n  The proposed settlement class also satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) in that \nrespondent “acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class” so that “a single \ninjunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class.” Wal-Mart \nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 360 (2011) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2))).  \n  Rule 23(b)(2) certification is generally appropriate for litigation seeking institutional \nreform through class-wide declaratory or injunctive relief. See A.R. v. Connecticut State Board of \nEducation, 3:16-cv-01197 (CSH), 2020 WL 2092650 at *12 (D. Conn. May 1, 2020), citing \nStinson v. City of New York, 282 F.R.D. 360, 379 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (internal citations omitted). \n“Certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate when a plaintiff seeks to enjoin a “systemic \nfailure” on the part of a governmental body or public entity to comply with statutory [or other] \nrequirements.  Id. (citing Westchester Indep. Living Ctr., 331 F.R.D. at 300 (certifying a Rule \n23(b)(2) class of individuals with mobility disabilities alleging that the state university failed to \ncomply with the requirements set forth in the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation \nAct); Brooklyn Ctr. for Indep. of the Disabled v. Bloomberg, 290 F.R.D. 409, 412, 420 (S.D.N.Y. \n2012) (certifying a Rule 23(b)(2) class of individuals with disabilities alleging that the City of \nNew York systemically failed to address the needs of disabled persons in the City’s emergency \nand disaster planning in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act). \n  As this Court has already noted, this case alleges that the Warden and the BOP’s existing \npre-suit home confinement policies, as applied to medically vulnerable prisoners, amount to \ndeliberate indifference.  ECF 30 at 64.  Those policies applied to the entire proposed medically \nvulnerable class.  The relief sought in the settlement – expedited home confinement review based \non the standards set forth in this Court’s TRO with additional procedural protections enumerated \nin the settlement agreement – is clearly susceptible of class-wide declaratory or injunctive relief.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134   Filed 08/03/20   Page 16 of 17\nThe relief sought in the proposed settlement agreement establishes procedural protections \ncommon to the class as a whole and does not require the Court to make individualized \ndeterminations with respect to particular prisoners or even to review the substantive correctness \nof a home confinement determination as to any particular prisoner.  The allegation of a policy \nfailure by the Warden and BOP to make appropriate use of their home confinement authority and \nrequest for expedited home confinement consideration for all class members based on uniform \nagreed policies and procedures are plainly susceptible to “a single injunction or declaratory \njudgment would provide relief to each member of the class,” and represent the paradigmatic \nexample of claims for which Rule 23(b)(2) certification was designed. \nIll.   CONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, petitioner’s Motion Certify Settlement Class should be \ngranted, the proposed settlement class should be certified, petitioner should be appointed as class \nrepresentative and petitioner’s counsel should be appointed as Counsel for the class. \nDated:  August 3, 2020    Respectfully Submitted, \n \n \n     /s/ Jonathan M.

Shea entered a \nTemporary Restraining Order in this Action (the “May 12, 2020 TRO” (ECF 30)) provisionally \ncertifying a putative subclass of medically vulnerable to COVID-19 FCI Danbury inmates and \nsetting forth standards for determining their suitability for home confinement release.1  \nWhereas, on May 15, 2020, Respondent filed an initial list identifying 314 inmates who \nare potential members of the Medically Vulnerable Class (the “Medically Vulnerable Class List \nOne Inmates” or “List One Inmates”).  Respondent identified the 314 List One Inmates by \nsearching the BOP’s record systems using a list of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes identified by \nPetitioner’s counsel as representing conditions specifically identified by the CDC as putting a \nperson at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19; \nWhereas Respondent ran a second search of BOP’s record systems, again using a list of \nICD-9 and ICD-10 codes identified by Petitioner’s counsel as representing conditions \nspecifically identified by the CDC as putting a person at higher risk for severe illness from \nCOVID-19, which resulted in a list of 111 additional inmates who are also potential members of \nthe Medically Vulnerable Class; and subsequently, at Petitioner’s counsel’s request, Respondent \nagreed to add an additional 14 inmates to be included into the second list of inmates who are \n                                                \n1 In the May 12, 2020 TRO, the medically vulnerable subclass was defined as: “All individuals \nin custody at FCI Danbury, while the threat of COVID-19 at the facility remains, who are aged \n65 or over and/or who have any of the following conditions specifically identified by the United \nStates Centers for Disease Control as putting them at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-\n19: (a) chronic lung disease including moderate to severe asthma, COPD, emphysema, chronic \nbronchitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and/or cystic fibrosis; (b) immunocompromised status, \nincluding status as a transplant recipient, on chemotherapy, HIV positive, prolonged use of \ncorticosteroids, using immunosuppressive medication, and/or having an immune deficiency; (c) \nsevere obesity (BMI of 40 or higher); (d) diabetes mellitus Type I or Type II, (e) gestational \ndiabetes mellitus; (f) chronic kidney disease on dialysis; (g) chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis; \nand/or (h) serious heart conditions, including congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, \ncongenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, and/or pulmonary hypertension.”  ECF 30 at pp. 65-66 \nn.32; see also ECF No. 26 at p. 2.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 4 of 34\npotential members of the Medically Vulnerable Class (collectively, these 125 inmates are the \n“Medically Vulnerable Class List Two Inmates” or “List Two Inmates”);   \nWhereas attached as Exhibit A is a list setting out the List One Inmates and the List Two \nInmates, respectively;  \nWhereas the parties recognize that there may be certain inmates, including future \ninmates, who are not List One Inmates or List Two Inmates but who nevertheless may already be \nor may in the future become members of the Medically Vulnerable Class (“Non-List Medically \nVulnerable Class Inmates” or “Non-List Inmates”);  \nWhereas the BOP has statutory authority to transfer prisoners to home confinement under \n18 U.S.C. § 3624(c)(2) and 34 U.S.C. § 60541; \nWhereas, on March 26, 2020, Attorney General William Barr issued a memorandum that \ndirected the BOP to “prioritize the use of your various statutory authorities to grant home \nconfinement for inmates seeking transfer in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” \nand provided a non-exhaustive list of discretionary factors for evaluating inmates for home \nconfinement;  \nWhereas, on March 27, 2020, Congress enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and \nEconomic Security Act (“CARES Act”), which authorized the Director of the BOP to lengthen \nthe amount of time prisoners can be placed on home confinement under Section 3624(c)(2)—\npreviously capped at the shorter of 10% of their sentence or 6 months—provided that the \nAttorney General makes a finding that “emergency conditions will materially affect the \nfunctioning of the Bureau”; \nWhereas, on April 3, 2020, Attorney General Barr issued a memorandum in which he \nfound that “emergency conditions are materially affecting the functioning of the Bureau” and \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 5 of 34\ndirected the Bureau to “move with dispatch in using home confinement, where appropriate, to \nmove vulnerable inmates out of these institutions” while cautioning that the BOP must continue \nto make “individualized [home confinement] determinations”; \nWhereas the BOP has established a multidisciplinary committee within its Central Office \nin Washington, D.C. (the “Home Confinement Committee” or “HCC”) to make home \nconfinement review determinations for inmates who are not eligible for home confinement under \nBOP’s current guidance but nevertheless could possibly be determined suitable for home \nconfinement as an exception case; \nWhereas the parties now desire to resolve the present litigation on the mutually \nacceptable terms set forth below, which they agree are a fair, reasonable and adequate resolution \nof this case; \nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises set forth herein, the parties agree \nand covenant as follows: \nSETTLEMENT TERMS \n  Settlement Class  \n1.  This Settlement Agreement is entered into on behalf of all members of the \nMedically Vulnerable Class, consisting of any person incarcerated at FCI Danbury anytime from \nthe Effective Date until the termination date of this Agreement, October 31, 2021, unless \notherwise modified by the parties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, who either: (a) is a \nList One Inmate or List Two Inmate, or (b) possesses one or more underlying medical conditions \nwhich, according to current CDC guidance (i.e., the CDC guidance in effect at the time of the \nindividual’s home confinement review), either (i) places that inmate at increased risk of severe \nillness from COVID-19 (“Tier 1 medical conditions”); or (ii) might place that inmate at an \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 6 of 34\nincreased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 (“Tier 2 medical conditions”). \nList One and List Two Inmate Home Confinement Reviews  \n2.  Respondent has already reviewed all List One Inmates for home confinement at \nthe institutional level and Respondent asserts that it has conducted these reviews pursuant to \nAttorney General Barr’s March 26 and April 3, 2020 memoranda, the current BOP guidance at \nthe time of each review, and the standards set forth in the May 12, 2020 TRO (see ECF 30).  The \nRespondent has already referred to the Home Confinement Committee all List One Inmates who \nwere not eligible for home confinement under the current BOP guidance at the time of each \nreview but whom the Respondent nevertheless believed could even possibly be eligible for home \nconfinement as an exception case based upon the standards set forth in the May 12, 2020 TRO \n(see ECF 30).  BOP asserts that the Home Confinement Committee has already made home \nconfinement determinations based upon the standards set forth in the May 12, 2020 TRO (see \nECF 30) for all List One Inmates referred to it.  The parties agree that Section 13 of this \nAgreement, infra, resolves any disputes or disagreements the parties may have, or have ever had, \nwith respect to the adequacy of the home confinement reviews performed under this Section. \n3.  To the extent she has not already done so, the Respondent agrees to have all List \nTwo Inmates reviewed for home confinement at the institutional level pursuant to Attorney \nGeneral Barr’s March 26 and April 3, 2020 memoranda, the current BOP guidance at the time of \neach review, and the standards set forth in the May 12, 2020 TRO (see ECF 30).  To the extent \nthat the standards set forth in the May 12, 2020 TRO differ from Attorney General Barr’s March \n26 and April 3, 2020 memoranda or the current BOP guidance at the time of each review, the \nprovisions of the May 12, 2020 TRO shall control.  Petitioner acknowledges that Respondent, at \nthe institutional level, may not be authorized to apply provisions of the May 12, 2020 TRO that \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 7 of 34\nconflict with current BOP guidance.  Respondent agrees to refer all List Two Inmates who are \nnot approved for home confinement at the institutional level to the Home Confinement \nCommittee.  BOP agrees to have the Home Confinement Committee make a home confinement \ndetermination for all such inmates based upon the standards set forth in the May 12, 2020 TRO \n(see ECF 30). \nIdentification of Medically Vulnerable Non-List Inmates \n4.  The parties agree that Non-List Inmates can become recognized as members of \nthe Medically Vulnerable Class, but only through the following process:  \na.  Petitioner’s counsel may propose any Non-List Inmate to become a recognized \nmember of the Medically Vulnerable Class, but only upon a good faith belief, \nsubstantiated by documentary evidence, that such individual falls within the \ndefinition of the Medically Vulnerable Class.   \nb.  Respondent and BOP agree to recognize as a member of the Medically \nVulnerable Class any inmate proposed under Section 4(a), unless within 7 days of \nsuch proposal the Respondent or BOP disagrees that the proposed inmate is a \nmember of the Medically Vulnerable Class.  \nc.  Any disagreements between counsel for Petitioner and Respondent or BOP over \nwhether a particular Non-List Inmate is a recognized member of the Medically \nVulnerable Class shall be finally resolved by a physician detailed to the BOP \nfrom the United States Public Health Service, Department of Health and Human \nServices, (the “PHS Physician”) within 7 days of such dispute being referred to \nhim or her. \nd.  Neither Respondent nor BOP nor the PHS Physician will consider whether an \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 8 of 34\ninmate has previously tested positive for COVID-19 in making a determination \nabout whether such individuals falls within the definition of the Medically \nVulnerable Class for purposes of this Section.  \ne.  Determinations about whether any Non-List Inmate is a recognized member of \nthe Medically Vulnerable Class will be based solely on BOP records, unless (1) \nthe inmate at issue has been in BOP custody for less than the two consecutive \nyears preceding the date of the inmate’s proposal under Section 4(a), or (2) \nPetitioner’s counsel makes a good faith representation that extraordinary and \ncompelling circumstances show the Non-List Inmate has a COVID-19 risk \nfactor(s) which warrant consideration of such outside medical records.  In either \nsuch instance, the inmate may submit outside medical records to be included in \nthe inmate’s BOP records, which—once submitted and made part of the inmate’s \nBOP records—will collectively be reviewed in determining whether an inmate is \na member of the Medically Vulnerable Class. \n5.  To help facilitate the identification of medically vulnerable Non-List Inmates, the \nparties agree to abide by the following timeline: \na.  Within 1 day of the Effective Date, Petitioner’s counsel agrees to provide \nRespondent medical release forms for certain inmates currently housed at FCI \nDanbury.   \nb.  Within 7 days of the Effective Date, Respondent or BOP will begin producing to \nPetitioner’s counsel the past two years of medical records for each inmate on \nbehalf of whom Petitioner’s counsel submits a medical release form pursuant to \nSection 5(a).  Respondent or BOP will finish producing all such records within 14 \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 9 of 34\ndays of the Effective Date.   \nc.  Respondent will continue to undertake efforts to identify medically vulnerable to \nCOVID-19 inmates who have arrived or will arrive at FCI Danbury after June 3, \n2020 pursuant to Attorney General Barr’s March 26 and April 3, 2020 \nmemoranda.  Respondent will ensure that each inmate admitted to FCI Danbury \nafter June 3, 2020 receives a copy of the attached notice and authorization to \nrelease medical records form, attached as Exhibit C to this Agreement (the \n“Authorization Form”).  For those inmates admitted after the Effective Date of \nthis Agreement, Respondent will provide each such inmate a copy of the \nAuthorization Form at the time of their admission.  Inmates will be responsible \nfor submitting signed Authorization Forms to Respondent.  Within 7 days of \nRespondent’s receipt of a signed Authorization Form, Respondent will provide a \ncopy of the signed form and the inmate’s past two years of BOP medical records \nto Petitioner’s counsel.  \nMedically Vulnerable Non-List Inmate Home Confinement Reviews  \n6.  Respondent agrees to have all Non-List Inmates who are recognized as members \nof the Medically Vulnerable Class pursuant to the process set forth in Section 4 of this \nAgreement reviewed for home confinement at the institutional level pursuant to Attorney \nGeneral Barr’s March 26 and April 3, 2020 memoranda, the current BOP guidance at the time of \neach review, and the standards set forth in the May 12, 2020 TRO (see ECF 30).  To the extent \nthat the provisions set forth in the March 12, 2020 TRO differ from Attorney General Barr’s \nMarch 26 and April 3, 2020 memoranda or the current BOP guidance at the time of each review, \nthe provisions of the May 12, 2020 TRO shall control.  Petitioner acknowledges that \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 10 of 34\nRespondent, at the institutional level, may not be authorized to apply provisions of the May 12, \n2020 TRO that conflict with current BOP guidance.  Respondent agrees to refer all such inmates \nwho are not approved for home confinement at the institutional level to the Home Confinement \nCommittee.  BOP agrees to have the Home Confinement Committee make a home confinement \ndetermination for all such inmates based upon the standards set forth in the May 12, 2020 TRO \n(see ECF 30).  After the List Two Inmates are reviewed for home confinement, with respect to \nanyone else subsequently recognized as a Medically Vulnerable Class member under Section 4 \nof this Agreement, Respondent and BOP shall complete their home confinement review within a \nreasonable time from recognition and shall endeavor to do so within fourteen days.  \nPrinciples Governing Home Confinement Assessments  \n7.  For each inmate reviewed for home confinement pursuant to Section(s) 3, 6, 13, \nand/or 14 of this Agreement, a medical clinician employed or appointed by Respondent or BOP \nwill verify that all Tier 1 medical conditions and Tier 2 medical conditions that each such inmate \nhas, based on qualifying medical records as set forth in Section 4(e) herein, are identified and \nlisted for consideration at both the institutional and Home Confinement Committee levels of \nreview.   \n8.  In making home confinement determinations under this Agreement pursuant to \nthe May 12, 2020 TRO, including in particular the May 12, 2020 TRO’s mandate to “assign \nsubstantial weight … to the inmate’s risk factors for COVID-19 based on CDC guidance,” \nRespondent and the BOP agree not to utilize the “high-average-no” risk methodology employed \nin ECF 92, or consider the fact that any particular inmate may have previously tested positive for \nCOVID-19.   \n9.  BOP’s National Health Technology Administrator—or a substitute medical \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 11 of 34\nclinician in the event the National Health Technology Administrator is unavailable—will remain \na member of the Home Confinement Committee to assist the Committee’s home confinement \nreviews. \n10.  The Respondent will create Review Worksheets for each person being reviewed \nthat include: (i) a list of the person’s CDC tier one and tier two COVID-19 risk factors; (ii) the \nperson’s age; (iii) the offense/s of conviction; (iv) the person’s projected release date (PRD); (v) \nthe percentage of statutory time served; (vi) a list of pending charges or detainers, if applicable; \n(vii) the person’s security level; (vii) the person’s PATTERN risk level; (viii) if the release plan \nhas been deemed unsuitable, the reasons for that conclusion; and (ix) the person’s DST, if he or \nshe has one.  The Home Confinement Committee will also use these Review Worksheets in \nmaking home confinement determinations.  Respondent agrees that if she determines that a \nMedically Vulnerable Class member is not eligible for home confinement, she will comply with \nthe May 12, 2020 TRO and provide a written explanation of the factual basis for any factors \nrelied upon for the denial.  \n11.  The BOP agrees that if the Home Confinement Committee denies home \nconfinement to a Medically Vulnerable Class member, it will comply with the May 12, 2020 \nTRO regarding a written explanation of the factual basis for any factors relied upon for the \ndenial.  Respondent and BOP agree to provide Petitioner’s counsel copies of the documents \ngenerated in the process of conducting home confinement reviews under this Agreement, \nincluding the Review Worksheets, the PATTERN Worksheets (i.e., worksheets containing the \nPATTERN score calculations) and the reason for denial (if the person is denied).  The parties \nagree that the form of the documents produced under this Section will be consistent with the \nworksheets that have been disclosed in this litigation (see, e.g., ECF 59).  BOP will endeavor to \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 12 of 34\nrelease individuals approved for home confinement to home confinement within 14 days of the \napproval decision unless public safety or the absence of any home in which to place the inmate \nwould make it unsafe to move the inmate to home confinement within that 14 day period. \nHome Confinement Reconsiderations  \n12.  Petitioner’s counsel may, based on a good faith belief, submit to Respondent and \nBOP for the Home Confinement Committee’s reconsideration any inmate who was denied home \nconfinement but whose Review Worksheets or PATTERN Worksheets produced to Petitioner’s \ncounsel under Section 11 contain an error or mistake of fact, including but not limited to a \nmistake in the description of an inmate’s PATTERN score or percentage of time served, or if the \nincorrect underlying medical condition(s) is listed on the worksheets for a particular inmate. \nRespondent and BOP may refuse to submit for reconsideration any such inmate to the extent \nthey disagree on a good faith basis with Petitioner’s counsel’s determination that an error or \nmistake of fact exists or that the error or mistake of fact is material, in which case the parties’ \ndispute will be subject to the Dispute Resolution Procedures in Section 23.   \n13.  Respondent and BOP agree to submit the 54 List One Inmates set out in the list \nattached to this Agreement as Exhibit B (“Exhibit B Inmates”) to the Home Confinement \nCommittee for it to reconsider their denials of home confinement.  The Home Confinement \nCommittee’s re-review for home confinement of the Exhibit B Inmates will comply with \nSections 7 through 11 of this Agreement, and is subject to enforcement under this Agreement.  \n14.  The BOP agrees that, if an inmate’s lack of a release plan is, or is among, the \nreason(s) for denial of home confinement, and a suitable release plan is subsequently presented, \neach such inmate will have the right to apply, on their own initiative, for a home confinement re-\nreview.  Such inmates shall be re-reviewed first by the institution, and, if denied again by the \ninstitution, then by the Home Confinement Committee.  Where a pending charge, detainer, or \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 13 of 34\nwarrant is, or is among, the reason(s) for denial of home confinement, and that pending charge, \ndetainer, or warrant has been resolved, each such inmate will have the right to apply, on their \nown initiative, for a home confinement review.  Such inmates shall be re-reviewed first by the \ninstitution, and, if denied again by the institution, then by the Home Confinement Committee. \nAll such home confinement re-reviews under this Section will comply with Sections 7 through \n11 of this Agreement, and are subject to enforcement under this Agreement.  This Section \napplies to all List Two Inmates and Non-List Inmates, as well as to List One Inmates previously \ndenied home confinement by the Home Confinement Committee. \nResolution and Release of Claims  \n15.  The parties agree that this Agreement resolves all claims in the above-captioned \ncase.  \n16.  The named Petitioner and all members of the Medically Vulnerable Class, as \ndefined in Section 1, individually and behalf of all their respective heirs, beneficiaries, \nsuccessors and assigns, in consideration of the benefits of this Agreement, release and forever \ndischarge the Respondent and BOP, and all their respective present and former officers, \nemployees, agents, heirs, successors and assigns, from all actions, causes of action, suits, claims, \nor controversies, for any and all forms of non-monetary relief arising from or based on either: (i) \nany denial of home confinement or exercise of the BOP’s statutory authority to transfer prisoners \nto home confinement which may be brought during the time this Agreement is in effect, except \nas otherwise provided under this Agreement, or (ii) any acts or omissions alleged or that could \nhave been alleged in the Action relating to the COVID-19 pandemic occurring prior to the \nEffective Date.  For the avoidance of doubt, this release applies to any and all Medically \nVulnerable Class members’ habeas corpus cases pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 seeking any relief \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 14 of 34\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Date.  The \naforementioned releases do not apply to sentence reduction/compassionate release motions filed \npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582.  \nDuration and Termination of Settlement \n17.  The parties intend that this Agreement will remain in place until October 31, \n2021, but upon the mutual consent of the parties, this date of termination may be modified, \nshortened or extended.  Additionally, the parties may make a motion to extend or motion to \nterminate this Agreement based on any substantial change in circumstances related to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic’s effect on FCI Danbury or other good faith basis.   \n18.  Upon termination, without the need for any further order of any state or federal \ncourt, all jurisdiction of any court to enforce this Agreement shall end.   \nCertification of the Settlement Class and Conditional Dismissal  \n19.  This Agreement is not a consent decree and shall not be incorporated into any \njudgment of the Court.  To the contrary, this is a settlement agreement which the parties agree is \na fair, reasonable and adequate resolution of this case.   \n20.  The Petitioner shall file a consent motion for certification of the Medically \nVulnerable Class within 5 days of the Effective Date.  The Medically Vulnerable Subclass shall \nbe defined, as in Section 1, as “any person incarcerated at FCI Danbury anytime from the \nEffective Date until the termination date of this Agreement, October 31, 2021, unless otherwise \nmodified by the parties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, who either: (a) is a List One \nInmate or List Two Inmate, or (b) possesses one or more underlying medical conditions which, \naccording to current CDC guidance (i.e., the CDC guidance in effect at the time of the \nindividual’s home confinement review), either (i) places that inmate at increased risk of severe \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 15 of 34\nillness from COVID-19; or (ii) might place that inmate at an increased risk of severe illness from \nCOVID-19.”  Within three days of the consent motion for class certification being granted, \nPetitioner and Respondent shall jointly move for an Order to Give Notice, and for a fairness \nhearing, analogous to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e).  \n21.  Subsequent to the fairness hearing referenced above, Petitioner and Respondent \nshall jointly move pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2) to approve this Agreement and to dismiss \nthe Petition subject to the parties’ compliance with the terms of the Agreement.  The dismissal \nshall be with prejudice and without costs as to all claims asserted in the Action by the Medically \nVulnerable Class pertaining to home confinement review and all other claims released under \nSection 16.  This dismissal will be without prejudice and without costs to all other claims \nbrought in the Action.  The parties agree that the Court shall retain jurisdiction over the parties \nand this case to the full extent necessary to enforce the terms of the Agreement.  \n22.  Throughout the duration of the Agreement, the parties agree to enforce the \nAgreement and resolve any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this \nAgreement, only pursuant to the procedures outlined in Section 23 of this Agreement (the \n“Dispute Resolution Procedures”).  The parties understand and agree that, if approved, and the \nCourt consents, the Court will maintain jurisdiction of this action throughout the duration of the \nAgreement to resolve any disputes which cannot be amicably resolved between the parties \npursuant to the Dispute Resolution Procedures set forth in Section 23.  If the parties are unable to \nresolve any such disputes with the assistance of the Settlement Judge, the Court shall retain \njurisdiction to enforce the provisions of the Agreement and the Petitioner may seek specific \nperformance of the Agreement.   \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 16 of 34\nDispute Resolution Procedures  \n23.  The following Dispute Resolution Procedures will govern any dispute, \ncontroversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or any breach or enforcement \nof this Agreement:  \na.  In the event of any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this \nAgreement, or any breach or enforcement of this Agreement, counsel for the \nparties shall meet and confer with each other before seeking intervention from the \nCourt.  The parties agree to meet and confer within 5 days of notice of a dispute.  \nb.  Either Party may request that the Honorable Thomas O. Farrish, United States \nMagistrate Judge or, if Judge Farrish is not available, another D. Conn. United \nStates Magistrate Judge (the “Settlement Judge”), participate in a meet and \nconfer, or in a meeting subsequent to a meet and confer, in order to facilitate \ninformal resolution of the issue. \nc.  If the parties are unable to resolve their dispute informally, they may seek \nintervention from the Court. \nd.  Petitioner agrees he shall not file a motion for contempt in connection with this \nAgreement.  The Court may not entertain a motion for contempt and the Court \nmay not grant any remedial relief in the nature of a contempt of court finding \nagainst Respondent or BOP.  If Petitioner prevails on any claim alleging \nRespondent’s or BOP’s non-compliance with this Agreement, the sole remedy \nshall be specific performance of this Agreement.   \ne.  The Petitioner agrees not to seek any attorneys’ fees and/or costs for any time \nspent in any portion of dispute resolution.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 17 of 34\nf.  The Home Confinement Committee’s substantive determination of whether to \nplace any particular member of the Medically Vulnerable Class on home \nconfinement shall not be subject to judicial review, except that the Court may \norder the BOP to have the Home Confinement Committee reconsider a home \nconfinement denial that is based upon erroneous factual underpinnings pursuant to \nSection 12 of this Agreement or a failure to comply with the terms of the \nAgreement, and may compel specific performance of this Agreement. \nOther Provisions  \n \n24.  This Agreement may be modified only by the mutual written agreement of all \nparties.  \n25.  This Agreement will not be interpreted against any party as the drafter, and it \nshall only ever be interpreted as if the organizational headings within the Settlement Terms do \nnot exist.   \n26.  The parties agree that this Agreement may be made public, and Petitioner \nexpressly consents to such release and disclosure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b). \n27.  This Agreement shall in no way be deemed an admission by any party of liability, \nfault, misconduct, or a violation of any policies, procedures, or federal, state, or local laws or \nregulations.  Neither this Agreement nor the fact of this settlement shall be construed to be, nor \nshall it be, admissible in any proceeding as evidence of an admission by any party of a violation \nof any policies, procedures, or federal, state, or local laws or regulations; nor shall this \nAgreement or the fact of settlement constitute evidence of any admission by any party as to any \nissue of law or fact.  This Agreement is entered into by all parties for the purpose of \ncompromising disputed claims and avoiding the expenses and risks of litigation.  This \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 18 of 34\nAgreement shall only ever be admissible in a proceeding to enforce its terms. \n28.  It is understood between the parties that certain presently unforeseeable events or \nconditions, including but not limited to changes in the established treatment practices or standard \nof care for treatment of COVID-19 infection or the prevalence or effect of COVID-19 in the state \nof Connecticut, may prevent or obviate the need for compliance with this Agreement.  If so, the \nparties agree to enter into good-faith discussions to attempt to resolve such issues or modify or \nterminate this Agreement as appropriate.  In the event the parties are unable to reach agreement, \nthe Dispute Resolution Procedures in Section 23 shall apply. \n29.  The provisions of this Agreement may be temporarily suspended or modified in \npart or in their entirety if the Respondent or her designees determine that a “genuine emergency” \nexists at FCI Danbury.  Genuine emergency means any special circumstances under which it is \nreasonable to conclude that there is any actual or potential threat to the security of FCI Danbury, \nor to the safety of the staff, prisoners or other persons within any one of the institution’s \nfacilities.  If a “genuine emergency” lasts longer than forty-eight hours, or occurs more than once \nin a one-week period, Respondent shall report to Petitioner’s counsel, within forty-eight hours \nexcept for good cause, the date of the emergency, the nature of the emergency, and which \nprovisions of this Agreement have been temporarily suspended.  For the avoidance of doubt, this \nSection is subject to the Dispute Resolution Procedures in Section 23. \n30.  Petitioner’s counsel agrees not to seek any attorneys’ fees, costs or expenses of \nany kind for their past or future work on this case.   \n \n \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 19 of 34\nPetitioner and Class Representative James Whitted: \nBy His Counsel \nJVbr  z \n1, \nZo}o \nDate  David S.

RUSSELL \n \nI, Sarah F. Russell, hereby declare pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746:  \n \n1.  I am a Professor of Law at Quinnipiac University School of Law and Director and \nSupervising Attorney in the School of Law’s Legal Clinic. I serve as counsel to the Petitioner in \nthis case.  \n2.  I make this declaration in support of Petitioner’s motion for class certification, consented \nto by Respondent’s counsel. This declaration is based on my personal knowledge.  \n3.   As Director of the Legal Clinic, I oversee the Clinic’s litigation and other projects.  My \npractice, and that of the Clinic’s law student interns, includes litigating prison conditions cases in \nfederal court and representing incarcerated clients on a range of other matters include \ncompassionate release motions in federal court, parole hearings, habeas petitions, and reentry \nplanning.   \n4.  Along with law student interns at Legal Clinic, I have litigated numerous cases involving \nprisoners in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut.  See, e.g., United States v. \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-2   Filed 08/03/20   Page 3 of 6\nAlmontes, No. 3:05-CR-58 (SRU), 2020 WL 1812713 (D. Conn. Apr. 9, 2020) (compassionate \nrelease motion granted on behalf of man at FCI Danbury based, inter alia, on BOP’s failure to \nprovide adequate medical care for his spinal cord injury); Bardo v. Wright, No. 3:17-CV-1430 \n(JBA), 2019 WL 5864820 (D. Conn. Nov. 8, 2019) (court denied summary judgment in case \nalleging deliberate indifference to client’s serious medical needs); Brodeur v. Champion, No. \n3:17 CV 1738 (RMS) (D. Conn.) (litigated through trial prisoner excessive force case); Milner v. \nBlack, 3:16-cv-1621 (SRU) (D. Conn.) & Milner v. Mulligan, 3:16-cv-1857 (D.

Corrections, et. al, 3:14-cv-00469-\nRNC (D. Conn.) (appointed guardian ad litem in case challenging transfer by the Department of \nChildren and Families of 16-year-old transgender girl to adult prison absent charges or \nconviction in adult court); Goode v. Blue, No. 3:10CV135-MRK (D. Conn.) (appointed pro bono \ncounsel for client alleging assault by a correctional officer at Connecticut’s supermax prison).  \n5.  Prior to joining Quinnipiac, I served as Director of the Liman Public Interest Program at \nYale Law School, where I led projects, research, and workshops relating to incarcerated people \nand litigated prison conditions cases with the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization’s \nPrison Legal Service Clinic and Complex Federal Litigation Clinic. See, e.g., Forde v. Baird, \n720 F. Supp. 2d 170 (D. Conn. 2010) (successfully challenged on religious freedom grounds the \nBOP’s policy of subjecting a Muslim woman to non-emergency pat searches by male \ncorrectional officers at FCI Danbury); Ilina v. Zickefoose, 591 F. Supp. 2d 145, 145 (D. Conn. \n2008) (habeas petition filed under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 on behalf of woman incarcerated at FCI \nDanbury alleging denial of adequate medical care).  I was previously an assistant federal \ndefender in the District of Connecticut, where I represented clients facing federal criminal \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-2   Filed 08/03/20   Page 4 of 6\ncharges from arraignment through appeal.  I also served as a law clerk in the U.S. District Court \nfor the Southern District of New York and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. \n6.  Tessa Bialek is the Senior Clinical Fellow and Staff Attorney at Quinnipiac’s Legal \nClinic, where she has worked since 2016.  In this role, she has worked on litigation involving \nstate and federal prisoners, including amicus briefs addressing issues related to long sentences \nfor juvenile offenders, juvenile parole hearings under Connecticut’s Public Act 15-84, and prison \nconditions cases, including claims of inadequate medical care, in federal court.  Prior to joining \nthe Legal Clinic, she clerked for federal judges on the U.S. District Court for the District of \nConnecticut and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and co-led the San Francisco \nAffirmative Litigation Project at Yale Law School, which partners with the San Francisco City \nAttorney’s Office to conceive, develop, and litigate consumer protection and other public \ninterest-focused lawsuits. \n7.  I have worked with Attorney Bialek and law student interns on all aspects of the current \nlitigation.  To investigate the claims underlying this litigation, we have communicated with \nhundreds of persons currently incarcerated at FCI Danbury, with several persons recently \nreleased from FCI Danbury, and with dozens of family members of people currently incarcerated \nat FCI Danbury.  We have also communicated with more than 100 attorneys representing \nindividuals currently incarcerated at FCI Danbury, including federal public defenders in \nConnecticut and in districts across the country.  Over the course of these communications, we \nhave received and reviewed dozens of compassionate release submissions and other court \ndocuments, as well as medical records, grievances, and other documents from individuals \ncurrently and recently incarcerated at FCI Danbury.      \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-2   Filed 08/03/20   Page 5 of 6\n8.  In developing legal claims and charting a course of action in this case, we have \ncollaborated with prison litigation experts nationwide, as well as with attorneys pursuing similar \nclass claims in federal courts across the country.  Informed by these resources and independent \nresearch, counsel identified Homer Venters, M.D., and Jaimie Meyer, M.D., M.S., F.A.C.P., to \nserve as experts in the case.  Dr. Venters conducted an inspection of FCI Danbury on May 27, \n2020, where he observed the conditions in medical, isolation, and housing facilities and spoke \nwith a number of staff members and incarcerated people at FCI Danbury.  He prepared an expert \nreport based on his observations.  Dr. Meyer has been involved in the process of identifying \nmedically vulnerable individuals (including developing relevant ICD-diagnostic code searches \nand prepared an expert report.  Both experts have advised the team on a range of COVID-19 \nissues in correctional settings. \n9.  In addition, we have reviewed voluminous discovery in this case, including more than \n20,000 pages of documents related to, inter alia: the home confinement review process at FCI \nDanbury and at the Home Confinement Committee; FCI Danbury’s policies and practices related \nto the provision of medical care generally and during the COVID-19 pandemic, including \nmedical records; pandemic response-related policies and practices, including those pertaining to \ntesting, sanitation, hygiene, protective equipment, physical distancing, quarantine, and isolation; \nand staffing, including medical staffing, at the institution.  Petitioner’s counsel deposed the two \ndefense experts, Asma Tekbali and Jeffery Beard, as well Warden Diane Easter, Health Services \nAdministrator Angela Dukate, Case Manager Coordinator Ashley Cocho, and FCI Danbury \nUnion President Drew Ueberroth.   \n \n   \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-2   Filed 08/03/20   Page 6 of 6\nI declare that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. \n \n______/s/__________ \nSarah F.

I am a Clinical Associate Professor of Law at Yale Law School and a Supervising \nAttorney at the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization (LSO). I serve as counsel to the \nPetitioner in this case.  \n2.  I make this declaration in support of Petitioner’s motion for class certification, consented \nto by Respondent’s counsel. This declaration is based on my personal knowledge.  \n3.   My practice, and that of law student interns of the LSO, includes complex habeas \nlitigation, complex civil rights litigation, and class actions, including specifically on behalf of \nincarcerated populations.  \n4.  One of the clinics at LSO that I co-direct is lead class counsel in a Rule 23(b)(2) class \naction brought on behalf of immigration detainees challenging prolonged no-bond detention. \nReid v. Donelan, CV 13-30125 PBS (D. Mass), 19-787, 19-1900 (1st Cir.). In addition, I have \npreviously been involved in Rule 23(b)(2) class actions involving the rights of incarcerated \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-3   Filed 08/03/20   Page 3 of 4\npopulations.

Baca, CV 12-00428 DDP \n(C.D. Cal) (class action challenging deputy-on-inmate violence at the Los Angeles County Jail).  \n5.  I and law student interns at LSO have also previously litigated numerous complex habeas \nchallenges, including recent challenges to incarceration based on COVID-19. See e.g., JSR v. \nSessions, CV 18-1110 VAB (D. Conn.) (habeas action on behalf of detained children challenging \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)’s family separation and detention practice); \nCampbell, et al v. Moniz, CV 20-10697 PBS (D. Mass) (multi-petitioner COVID-19 habeas on \nbehalf of immigration detainees); Terwilliger v. Cook, CV 20-540 SRU (D. Conn) (COVID-19 \nhabeas on behalf of state prisoner); Hurdle v. Cook, CV 20-605 KAD (D. Conn) (same); Diaz v. \nCook, CV 20-653 KAD (D. Conn) (same). In addition, I and law student interns at LSO also \nhave experience litigating complex civil rights actions. See, e.g., Thiersaint v. DHS, CV 18-\n12406 DJC (D. Mass) (Federal Tort Claims Act action seeking damages for torts committed \nwhile plaintiff was in ICE custody); Batalla-Vidal v. Wolf, CV 16-4756 NGG (E.D.N.Y), 18-845 \n(2d. Cir.), 18-889 (Sp Ct) (successful challenge to Trump Administration’s 2017 attempted \ntermination of the DACA program). Prior to becoming a clinical law professor, counsel served \nfor three and a half years as a Deputy Federal Public Defender in the Central District of \nCalifornia, where she defended complex federal prosecutions mostly for an incarcerated \npopulation. \n6.  Through the course of this litigation thus far, law student interns working under my \nsupervision have conducted legal research, reviewed discovery, investigated the claims asserted \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-3   Filed 08/03/20   Page 4 of 4\nby Petitioner, and drafted documents.

GOLUB \n \n  David S. Golub does declare, under penalty of perjury, as follows: \n \n  1.  I am a member of the law firm of Silver Golub & Teitell LLP, attorneys for \npetitioner Whitted and the proposed Settlement Class in this action.  I submit this Declaration in \nsupport of petitioner’s pending Motion for Certification of a Settlement Class in this action and \nto describe the qualifications and class action experience of my firm and the work we (and our \nco-counsel) have performed in this action. \nEfforts of Class Counsel and Resources Committed to the Class \n  2.  Commencing in April 2020, my firm – predominantly, my partner Jonathan M. \nLevine and I – undertook, in combination with co-counsel from the Quinnipiac and Yale legal \nclinics, to bring this proposed class action on behalf of individuals at FCI Danbury imperilled by \nthe COVID-19 pandemic.  In April 2020, FCI Danbury had been identified as one of the \ninstitutions in the federal Bureau of Prisons most severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-4   Filed 08/03/20   Page 3 of 9\nand the BOP had, at that point, made virtually no use of its home confinement authority to \nprotect prisoners at risk from COVID-19.   \n  3.  My firm agreed to participate in the litigation understanding that our participation \nwould entail a considerable investment of time and resources.  Petitioners’ claims in this matter \ninvolved significant legal complexity and difficulty and had to be litigated in an extremely \ntime-intensive fashion in light of the urgency of the risk faced by medically vulnerable prisoners \nfrom the presence of COVID-19 in FCI Danbury.1  Within approximately two weeks of forming \nthe legal team, counsel had made extensive contacts with a significant number of FCI Danbury \nprisoners through the Corrlinks system as well as communications with family and outside \ncounsel, had reviewed pleadings from similar cases being filed against other federal and state \nfacilities throughout the country, and had assembled and filed a 71-page Petition for Writ of \nHabeas Corpus accompanied by 14 declarations, compellingly detailing petitioners’ allegations \nconcerning the conditions at FCI Danbury and the dangers to medically vulnerable inmates in the \ninstitution.  Three days after the filing of the original Petition, the team filed an Emergency \nMotion for a Temporary Restraining Order supported by an extensive memorandum of law and \neight additional declarations.   \n  4.  On May 12, 2020, after a hearing on May 6, 2020, the Court entered a temporary \nrestraining order (“TRO”) providing procedures for the identification and consideration for home \nconfinement release of medically vulnerable Danbury inmates, and scheduled a hearing on \npetitioners’ motion for a preliminary injunction. \n                                                           \n1  In the three months that have elapsed since the initiation of this matter, the parties and the \nCourt have generated more than 130 entries on the Court docket. \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-4   Filed 08/03/20   Page 4 of 9\n  5.  Subsequent to the entry of the TRO, we undertook oversight of the BOP’s process \nfor identifying medically vulnerable individuals at Danbury as mandated by the TRO.  We also \nundertook extensive discovery in preparation for the preliminary injunction hearing, including \nserving and responding to written discovery; review of over 30,000 pages of discovery \nproduction; and multiple depositions of FCI Danbury staff responsible for both the \nadministration of the health care system at the facility and the process for home confinement \nreview.  We retained experts on both the public health and prison management issues arising \nfrom the presence of COVID-19 at FCI Danbury, undertook an inspection of the facility, and \ncompleted depositions of petitioners’ and respondent’s experts.  All of this – involving hundreds \nof hours of legal time – was accomplished by early June 2020.  Simultaneous with these efforts \nto litigate this case, the team maintained regular contact with prisoners at the facility, their \nfamilies, attorneys and other representatives, fielding and generating well over 2,000 \ncommunications on behalf of several hundred prisoners.   \n  6.  Attorney Levine and I have personally devoted several hundred hours of time to \nthis action; and, as the litigation intensified in preparation for the preliminary injunction hearing, \nfour associates at my firm also became significantly involved in the representation, and also \ndevoted substantial time to this action. \n  7.  After this matter was prepared for hearing on petitioners’ Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction, the parties agreed to enter into settlement discussions under the aegis of Magistrate \nJudge Thomas Farrish.  Those discussions proceeded over 9 separate sessions (encompassing \nmore than 38 hours), stretched over a calendar month, and ultimately resulted in an agreement in \nprinciple.  Subsequent to that agreement, reported to Judge Farrish on July 8, 2020, the parties \n  3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-4   Filed 08/03/20   Page 5 of 9\nengaged in extensive discussions among themselves to produce the written Settlement \nAgreement which was finalized on July 27, 2020 subject to the Court’s approval after a fairness \nhearing.  \n  8.  Attorney Levine and I, and all counsel for petitioner and the proposed Settlement \nClass, believe that the agreement we have reached provides significant benefit to the proposed \nclass of medically vulnerable prisoners at FCI Danbury.  The TRO entered by the Court in this \nmatter – which set standards and a process for identifying medically vulnerable inmates at FCI \nDanbury and evaluation medically vulnerable inmates for home confinement release, but \ncarefully did not supersede the BOP’s authority to make ultimate decisions about such release – \nwas, unlike other orders involving federal correctional institutions, not challenged on appeal by \nthe Bureau of Prisons and is one of fewer than a handful of emergency orders affecting federal \nand state facilities entered nationwide that have not been reversed or stayed on appeal.  As a \nresult of the continued vitality of the Court’s TRO, we were able to negotiate a Settlement \nAgreement that provides, in accordance with the standards set forth by the Court in the TRO, for \nidentification of medically vulnerable prisoners at FCI Danbury who meet criteria set forth in \nrelevant CDC guidance – importantly, including whether such prisoner’s medical conditions are \nscientifically established as or merely suspected of putting the individual at risk of severe illness \nfrom COVID-19.  Further, and, we believe, a unique result among any COVID-related prison \ncases in the country, the Settlement Agreement accords medically vulnerable individuals at FCI \nDanbury expedited home confinement consideration subject to the standards originally mandated \nby the Court in its May 12, 2020 TRO (including substantial weight accorded to the prisoners’ \n  4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-4   Filed 08/03/20   Page 6 of 9\nmedical conditions and a prohibition against the use of automatic disqualifiers), which the BOP \nhas agreed to adhere to in future FCI Danbury home confinement determinations. \n  9.  I have reviewed the Declaration of Professor Sarah Russell, co-counsel in this \nmatter, and concur in her description and analysis of the prosecution of this litigation by the team \nrepresenting the named petitioner(s) and the proposed class.   \n    The Experience of My Firm with Class and other Complex Litigation \n  10.

I am a graduate of Yale College (1970) and \nYale Law School (1973).  I helped found and have been a partner at Silver Golub & Teitell since \nit was formed in 1978.  Attorney Levine is a graduate of Harvard College (1986) and Yale Law \nSchool (1990).  He joined the firm in 1990 upon graduation from law school, and became a \npartner on January 1, 1999.  Both Attorney Levine’s and my practices have focused on trial and \nappellate litigation of complex matters, and he and I have litigated together the substantial \nmajority of the cases referred to above. \n  6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-4   Filed 08/03/20   Page 8 of 9\n  12.  My firm has, further, been previously involved in class action litigation involving \nprison conditions at FCI Danbury.  See Miles, et al v. Bell, Nos. B-79-137 (TFGD) & B-82-626 \n(TFGD) (D. Conn.), an action that resulted, mid-trial, in “voluntary” changes by the BOP in the \nconditions for pre-trial detainees at Danbury. \n  13.  My firm is, further, currently involved in a number of proposed class actions in \nthis District and other federal and state courts around the country.  See e.g., Curtis, et al v. Aetna \nLife Insurance Co., 3:19 cv 1579 (MPS) (D. Conn); Dill, et al v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., \n1:19 cv 10947 (KLF) (S.D.N.Y.); Hubbard, et al v. Google, LLC, et al, 5:19 cv 7016 (BLF) \n(N.D.

(SLC); Retirement \nPrograms of the Town of Fairfield, et al v. Allianz Global Investors US LLC, 1:20 cv 5817 \n(KLF) (S.D.N.Y.). \n  14.  My firm also has extensive experience in litigating other complex actions.  See, \ne.g., State of Connecticut v. Philip Morris, Inc., et al., CV 96 0072414 S (Conn. Super. CLD at \nWaterbury); United States ex rel. Douglas D. Keeth v. United Technologies Corporation, Civ. \nNo. H-89-323 (AHN) (D. Conn.).  In State of Connecticut v. Philip Morris, my firm served as \nprivate lead counsel for the State of Connecticut in the State’s sovereign enforcement action \nagainst the tobacco industry, a case involving substantial CUTPA claims for relief. An \nindependent panel of three former attorneys general concluded that the contribution of \nConnecticut's legal team to the national settlement was among the top five of the 57 states and \nother entities participating in the nation-wide settlement.  This determination resulted in an \nincrease in Connecticut’s share of the national settlement by over $350,000,000.  In United \n  7 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-4   Filed 08/03/20   Page 9 of 9\nStates ex rel. Keeth, my firm represented the relator in a complex False Claims Action brought \nagainst United Technologies Corporation, resulting in a settlement of $150,000,000 on behalf of \nthe United States Government, then the largest such recovery under the False Claims Act. \n  15.  Based on the foregoing, we respectfully submit that my firm has the qualifications \nand experience to serve as Class Counsel in this action.2 \n \n  I declare pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, under penalty of perjury, that the foregoing is true \nand correct. \n  Executed on August 3, 2020. \n \n              /s/   David S.

I am an Associate Professor of Law at the University at Buffalo School of Law and \nDirector of the Criminal Justice Advocacy Clinic. I serve as counsel to the Petitioner in this case.  \n2.  I make this declaration in support of Petitioner’s motion for class certification, consented \nto by Respondent’s counsel. This declaration is based on my personal knowledge.  \n3.   As Director of the Criminal Justice Advocacy Clinic, I will represent clients and \nsupervise students in their handling of criminal and post-conviction proceedings. \n4.  Prior to joining the University at Buffalo I was a Senior Liman Fellow in Residence at the \nLiman Center for Public Interest Law at Yale Law School.  \n5.  At the Liman Center I supervised law students working on criminal justice reform \nprojects. These projects included preparing testimony and recommendations for the U.S. \nCommission on Civil Rights at a briefing on Women in Prison, providing comments on proposed \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-5   Filed 08/03/20   Page 3 of 4\nNew York State regulations on the use of restrictive housing in prisons, and surveying the \nadministrators of U.S. prisons and compiling a report on the national use of solitary confinement.  \n6.  During my time at Yale Law School I also advised students working on resentencing \ncases, motions to correct an illegal sentence, sentence modifications, and parole hearings. I \ncontinued work started while a public defender on an appeal from the denial of a habeas corpus \npetition in a case involving a claim of actual innocence. I participated in the Criminal Justice \nClinic at Yale Law School; students in the clinic represent defendants in criminal cases in New \nHaven. I also supervised in the Media Freedom & Information Access Clinic law students \nworking on a project related to criminal system information access in Connecticut.  \n7.  From January 2020 to the present I served as a member of the Subcommittee on \nSuccessive Petitions as part of the Connecticut Legislature’s Habeas Corpus Matters Task Force. \n8.  Before joining Yale Law School I was a Deputy Assistant Public Defender in the \nConnecticut Division of Public Defender Services. I worked in the Innocence Project / Post-\nConviction Unit from 2014-2018. During my time in that office I represented clients in habeas \ncorpus proceedings in state court, in appeals in the state appellate and supreme court, in motions \nto correct an illegal sentence, and in parole hearings before the Connecticut Board of Pardons \nand Paroles. I also second-chaired two felony trial cases from investigation through pre-trial \n(resolution post-jury selection and -motions but pre-trial) in the New Haven Judicial District. In \naddition to individual client representation, I also coordinated the division’s representation of \nindividuals who were juveniles at the time of the crime and who had been sentenced to lengthy \nprison terms in adult court. This involved providing training, written samples, guides, and other \nresources to attorneys working on these cases.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 134-5   Filed 08/03/20   Page 4 of 4\n9.  As part of this case and with co-counsel, I have communicated with hundreds of persons \ncurrently incarcerated at FCI Danbury, with several persons recently released from FCI Danbury, \nand with dozens of family members of people incarcerated at FCI Danbury.  I have also \ncommunicated with dozens of attorneys representing individuals currently incarcerated at FCI \nDanbury.  As part of this investigation, I have reviewed medical records, grievances, and other \ndocuments from individuals currently and recently incarcerated at FCI Danbury.      \n10. I accompanied Dr. Homer Venters, petitioner’s expert in the case, on an inspection of \nFCI Danbury on May 27, 2020. During the course of this inspection, Dr. Venters observed the \nconditions in medical, isolation, and housing facilities and spoke with a number of staff members \nand incarcerated people at FCI Danbury.  He prepared an expert report based on his \nobservations.   \n \nI declare that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. \n \n______/s/__________ \nAlexandra Harrington \nAssociate Professor of Law  \n \n3 \n ",

EASTER, Warden of Federal Correctional   : \nInstitution at Danbury, in her official capacity  : \n     :  \n                                         Respondent.  :   \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n  This Settlement Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made and entered into effective July 27, \n2020 (the “Effective Date”) by Petitioner James Whitted, individually and on behalf of the \nmembers of the proposed class defined herein in Section 1 (the “Medically Vulnerable Class”), \non the one hand, and the Respondent, Diane Easter, in her official capacity as the Warden \n(“Respondent” or the “Warden”) of the Federal Correctional Institution located in Danbury, \nConnecticut (“FCI Danbury”) and the Bureau of Prisons (the “BOP”), on the other hand.   \nRECITALS \nWhereas, on April 27, 2020, several FCI Danbury inmates, subsequently joined by \nPetitioner, brought this action (the “Action”) alleging the Respondent was violating the Eighth \nAmendment rights of FCI Danbury prisoners by (i) failing to make full use of her home \nconfinement and compassionate release authority, and (ii) failing to implement adequate \nmeasures to prevent the continued spread of COVID-19 at FCI Danbury; \nWhereas Respondent denies and vigorously disputes that any FCI Danbury inmate at \nissue in the present litigation has been treated with deliberate indifference;  \n \n \n\nWhereas, on May 12, 2020, United States District Judge Michael P. Shea entered a \nTemporary Restraining Order in this Action (the “May 12, 2020 TRO” (ECF 30)) provisionally \ncertifying a putative subclass of medically vulnerable to COVID-19 FCI Danbury inmates and \nsetting forth standards for determining their suitability for home confinement release.1  \nWhereas, on May 15, 2020, Respondent filed an initial list identifying 314 inmates who \nare potential members of the Medically Vulnerable Class (the “Medically Vulnerable Class List \nOne Inmates” or “List One Inmates”).  Respondent identified the 314 List One Inmates by \nsearching the BOP’s record systems using a list of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes identified by \nPetitioner’s counsel as representing conditions specifically identified by the CDC as putting a \nperson at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19; \nWhereas Respondent ran a second search of BOP’s record systems, again using a list of \nICD-9 and ICD-10 codes identified by Petitioner’s counsel as representing conditions \nspecifically identified by the CDC as putting a person at higher risk for severe illness from \nCOVID-19, which resulted in a list of 111 additional inmates who are also potential members of \nthe Medically Vulnerable Class; and subsequently, at Petitioner’s counsel’s request, Respondent \nagreed to add an additional 14 inmates to be included into the second list of inmates who are \n                                                \n1 In the May 12, 2020 TRO, the medically vulnerable subclass was defined as: “All individuals \nin custody at FCI Danbury, while the threat of COVID-19 at the facility remains, who are aged \n65 or over and/or who have any of the following conditions specifically identified by the United \nStates Centers for Disease Control as putting them at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-\n19: (a) chronic lung disease including moderate to severe asthma, COPD, emphysema, chronic \nbronchitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and/or cystic fibrosis; (b) immunocompromised status, \nincluding status as a transplant recipient, on chemotherapy, HIV positive, prolonged use of \ncorticosteroids, using immunosuppressive medication, and/or having an immune deficiency; (c) \nsevere obesity (BMI of 40 or higher); (d) diabetes mellitus Type I or Type II, (e) gestational \ndiabetes mellitus; (f) chronic kidney disease on dialysis; (g) chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis; \nand/or (h) serious heart conditions, including congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, \ncongenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, and/or pulmonary hypertension.”  ECF 30 at pp. 65-66 \nn.32; see also ECF No. 26 at p. 2.   \n2 \n \n\npotential members of the Medically Vulnerable Class (collectively, these 125 inmates are the \n“Medically Vulnerable Class List Two Inmates” or “List Two Inmates”);   \nWhereas attached as Exhibit A is a list setting out the List One Inmates and the List Two \nInmates, respectively;  \nWhereas the parties recognize that there may be certain inmates, including future \ninmates, who are not List One Inmates or List Two Inmates but who nevertheless may already be \nor may in the future become members of the Medically Vulnerable Class (“Non-List Medically \nVulnerable Class Inmates” or “Non-List Inmates”);  \nWhereas the BOP has statutory authority to transfer prisoners to home confinement under \n18 U.S.C. § 3624(c)(2) and 34 U.S.C. § 60541; \nWhereas, on March 26, 2020, Attorney General William Barr issued a memorandum that \ndirected the BOP to “prioritize the use of your various statutory authorities to grant home \nconfinement for inmates seeking transfer in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” \nand provided a non-exhaustive list of discretionary factors for evaluating inmates for home \nconfinement;  \nWhereas, on March 27, 2020, Congress enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and \nEconomic Security Act (“CARES Act”), which authorized the Director of the BOP to lengthen \nthe amount of time prisoners can be placed on home confinement under Section 3624(c)(2)—\npreviously capped at the shorter of 10% of their sentence or 6 months—provided that the \nAttorney General makes a finding that “emergency conditions will materially affect the \nfunctioning of the Bureau”; \nWhereas, on April 3, 2020, Attorney General Barr issued a memorandum in which he \nfound that “emergency conditions are materially affecting the functioning of the Bureau” and \n3 \n \n\ndirected the Bureau to “move with dispatch in using home confinement, where appropriate, to \nmove vulnerable inmates out of these institutions” while cautioning that the BOP must continue \nto make “individualized [home confinement] determinations”; \nWhereas the BOP has established a multidisciplinary committee within its Central Office \nin Washington, D.C. (the “Home Confinement Committee” or “HCC”) to make home \nconfinement review determinations for inmates who are not eligible for home confinement under \nBOP’s current guidance but nevertheless could possibly be determined suitable for home \nconfinement as an exception case; \nWhereas the parties now desire to resolve the present litigation on the mutually \nacceptable terms set forth below, which they agree are a fair, reasonable and adequate resolution \nof this case; \nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises set forth herein, the parties agree \nand covenant as follows: \nSETTLEMENT TERMS \n  Settlement Class  \n1.  This Settlement Agreement is entered into on behalf of all members of the \nMedically Vulnerable Class, consisting of any person incarcerated at FCI Danbury anytime from \nthe Effective Date until the termination date of this Agreement, October 31, 2021, unless \notherwise modified by the parties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, who either: (a) is a \nList One Inmate or List Two Inmate, or (b) possesses one or more underlying medical conditions \nwhich, according to current CDC guidance (i.e., the CDC guidance in effect at the time of the \nindividual’s home confinement review), either (i) places that inmate at increased risk of severe \nillness from COVID-19 (“Tier 1 medical conditions”); or (ii) might place that inmate at an \n4 \n \n\nincreased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 (“Tier 2 medical conditions”). \nList One and List Two Inmate Home Confinement Reviews  \n2.  Respondent has already reviewed all List One Inmates for home confinement at \nthe institutional level and Respondent asserts that it has conducted these reviews pursuant to \nAttorney General Barr’s March 26 and April 3, 2020 memoranda, the current BOP guidance at \nthe time of each review, and the standards set forth in the May 12, 2020 TRO (see ECF 30).  The \nRespondent has already referred to the Home Confinement Committee all List One Inmates who \nwere not eligible for home confinement under the current BOP guidance at the time of each \nreview but whom the Respondent nevertheless believed could even possibly be eligible for home \nconfinement as an exception case based upon the standards set forth in the May 12, 2020 TRO \n(see ECF 30).  BOP asserts that the Home Confinement Committee has already made home \nconfinement determinations based upon the standards set forth in the May 12, 2020 TRO (see \nECF 30) for all List One Inmates referred to it.  The parties agree that Section 13 of this \nAgreement, infra, resolves any disputes or disagreements the parties may have, or have ever had, \nwith respect to the adequacy of the home confinement reviews performed under this Section. \n3.  To the extent she has not already done so, the Respondent agrees to have all List \nTwo Inmates reviewed for home confinement at the institutional level pursuant to Attorney \nGeneral Barr’s March 26 and April 3, 2020 memoranda, the current BOP guidance at the time of \neach review, and the standards set forth in the May 12, 2020 TRO (see ECF 30).  To the extent \nthat the standards set forth in the May 12, 2020 TRO differ from Attorney General Barr’s March \n26 and April 3, 2020 memoranda or the current BOP guidance at the time of each review, the \nprovisions of the May 12, 2020 TRO shall control.  Petitioner acknowledges that Respondent, at \nthe institutional level, may not be authorized to apply provisions of the May 12, 2020 TRO that \n5 \n \n\nconflict with current BOP guidance.  Respondent agrees to refer all List Two Inmates who are \nnot approved for home confinement at the institutional level to the Home Confinement \nCommittee.  BOP agrees to have the Home Confinement Committee make a home confinement \ndetermination for all such inmates based upon the standards set forth in the May 12, 2020 TRO \n(see ECF 30). \nIdentification of Medically Vulnerable Non-List Inmates \n4.  The parties agree that Non-List Inmates can become recognized as members of \nthe Medically Vulnerable Class, but only through the following process:  \na.  Petitioner’s counsel may propose any Non-List Inmate to become a recognized \nmember of the Medically Vulnerable Class, but only upon a good faith belief, \nsubstantiated by documentary evidence, that such individual falls within the \ndefinition of the Medically Vulnerable Class.   \nb.  Respondent and BOP agree to recognize as a member of the Medically \nVulnerable Class any inmate proposed under Section 4(a), unless within 7 days of \nsuch proposal the Respondent or BOP disagrees that the proposed inmate is a \nmember of the Medically Vulnerable Class.  \nc.  Any disagreements between counsel for Petitioner and Respondent or BOP over \nwhether a particular Non-List Inmate is a recognized member of the Medically \nVulnerable Class shall be finally resolved by a physician detailed to the BOP \nfrom the United States Public Health Service, Department of Health and Human \nServices, (the “PHS Physician”) within 7 days of such dispute being referred to \nhim or her. \nd.  Neither Respondent nor BOP nor the PHS Physician will consider whether an \n6 \n \n\ninmate has previously tested positive for COVID-19 in making a determination \nabout whether such individuals falls within the definition of the Medically \nVulnerable Class for purposes of this Section.  \ne.  Determinations about whether any Non-List Inmate is a recognized member of \nthe Medically Vulnerable Class will be based solely on BOP records, unless (1) \nthe inmate at issue has been in BOP custody for less than the two consecutive \nyears preceding the date of the inmate’s proposal under Section 4(a), or (2) \nPetitioner’s counsel makes a good faith representation that extraordinary and \ncompelling circumstances show the Non-List Inmate has a COVID-19 risk \nfactor(s) which warrant consideration of such outside medical records.  In either \nsuch instance, the inmate may submit outside medical records to be included in \nthe inmate’s BOP records, which—once submitted and made part of the inmate’s \nBOP records—will collectively be reviewed in determining whether an inmate is \na member of the Medically Vulnerable Class. \n5.  To help facilitate the identification of medically vulnerable Non-List Inmates, the \nparties agree to abide by the following timeline: \na.  Within 1 day of the Effective Date, Petitioner’s counsel agrees to provide \nRespondent medical release forms for certain inmates currently housed at FCI \nDanbury.   \nb.  Within 7 days of the Effective Date, Respondent or BOP will begin producing to \nPetitioner’s counsel the past two years of medical records for each inmate on \nbehalf of whom Petitioner’s counsel submits a medical release form pursuant to \nSection 5(a).  Respondent or BOP will finish producing all such records within 14 \n7 \n \n\ndays of the Effective Date.   \nc.  Respondent will continue to undertake efforts to identify medically vulnerable to \nCOVID-19 inmates who have arrived or will arrive at FCI Danbury after June 3, \n2020 pursuant to Attorney General Barr’s March 26 and April 3, 2020 \nmemoranda.  Respondent will ensure that each inmate admitted to FCI Danbury \nafter June 3, 2020 receives a copy of the attached notice and authorization to \nrelease medical records form, attached as Exhibit C to this Agreement (the \n“Authorization Form”).  For those inmates admitted after the Effective Date of \nthis Agreement, Respondent will provide each such inmate a copy of the \nAuthorization Form at the time of their admission.  Inmates will be responsible \nfor submitting signed Authorization Forms to Respondent.  Within 7 days of \nRespondent’s receipt of a signed Authorization Form, Respondent will provide a \ncopy of the signed form and the inmate’s past two years of BOP medical records \nto Petitioner’s counsel.  \nMedically Vulnerable Non-List Inmate Home Confinement Reviews  \n6.  Respondent agrees to have all Non-List Inmates who are recognized as members \nof the Medically Vulnerable Class pursuant to the process set forth in Section 4 of this \nAgreement reviewed for home confinement at the institutional level pursuant to Attorney \nGeneral Barr’s March 26 and April 3, 2020 memoranda, the current BOP guidance at the time of \neach review, and the standards set forth in the May 12, 2020 TRO (see ECF 30).  To the extent \nthat the provisions set forth in the March 12, 2020 TRO differ from Attorney General Barr’s \nMarch 26 and April 3, 2020 memoranda or the current BOP guidance at the time of each review, \nthe provisions of the May 12, 2020 TRO shall control.  Petitioner acknowledges that \n8 \n \n\nRespondent, at the institutional level, may not be authorized to apply provisions of the May 12, \n2020 TRO that conflict with current BOP guidance.  Respondent agrees to refer all such inmates \nwho are not approved for home confinement at the institutional level to the Home Confinement \nCommittee.  BOP agrees to have the Home Confinement Committee make a home confinement \ndetermination for all such inmates based upon the standards set forth in the May 12, 2020 TRO \n(see ECF 30).  After the List Two Inmates are reviewed for home confinement, with respect to \nanyone else subsequently recognized as a Medically Vulnerable Class member under Section 4 \nof this Agreement, Respondent and BOP shall complete their home confinement review within a \nreasonable time from recognition and shall endeavor to do so within fourteen days.  \nPrinciples Governing Home Confinement Assessments  \n7.  For each inmate reviewed for home confinement pursuant to Section(s) 3, 6, 13, \nand/or 14 of this Agreement, a medical clinician employed or appointed by Respondent or BOP \nwill verify that all Tier 1 medical conditions and Tier 2 medical conditions that each such inmate \nhas, based on qualifying medical records as set forth in Section 4(e) herein, are identified and \nlisted for consideration at both the institutional and Home Confinement Committee levels of \nreview.   \n8.  In making home confinement determinations under this Agreement pursuant to \nthe May 12, 2020 TRO, including in particular the May 12, 2020 TRO’s mandate to “assign \nsubstantial weight … to the inmate’s risk factors for COVID-19 based on CDC guidance,” \nRespondent and the BOP agree not to utilize the “high-average-no” risk methodology employed \nin ECF 92, or consider the fact that any particular inmate may have previously tested positive for \nCOVID-19.   \n9.  BOP’s National Health Technology Administrator—or a substitute medical \n9 \n \n\nclinician in the event the National Health Technology Administrator is unavailable—will remain \na member of the Home Confinement Committee to assist the Committee’s home confinement \nreviews. \n10.  The Respondent will create Review Worksheets for each person being reviewed \nthat include: (i) a list of the person’s CDC tier one and tier two COVID-19 risk factors; (ii) the \nperson’s age; (iii) the offense/s of conviction; (iv) the person’s projected release date (PRD); (v) \nthe percentage of statutory time served; (vi) a list of pending charges or detainers, if applicable; \n(vii) the person’s security level; (vii) the person’s PATTERN risk level; (viii) if the release plan \nhas been deemed unsuitable, the reasons for that conclusion; and (ix) the person’s DST, if he or \nshe has one.  The Home Confinement Committee will also use these Review Worksheets in \nmaking home confinement determinations.  Respondent agrees that if she determines that a \nMedically Vulnerable Class member is not eligible for home confinement, she will comply with \nthe May 12, 2020 TRO and provide a written explanation of the factual basis for any factors \nrelied upon for the denial.  \n11.  The BOP agrees that if the Home Confinement Committee denies home \nconfinement to a Medically Vulnerable Class member, it will comply with the May 12, 2020 \nTRO regarding a written explanation of the factual basis for any factors relied upon for the \ndenial.  Respondent and BOP agree to provide Petitioner’s counsel copies of the documents \ngenerated in the process of conducting home confinement reviews under this Agreement, \nincluding the Review Worksheets, the PATTERN Worksheets (i.e., worksheets containing the \nPATTERN score calculations) and the reason for denial (if the person is denied).  The parties \nagree that the form of the documents produced under this Section will be consistent with the \nworksheets that have been disclosed in this litigation (see, e.g., ECF 59).  BOP will endeavor to \n10 \n \n\nrelease individuals approved for home confinement to home confinement within 14 days of the \napproval decision unless public safety or the absence of any home in which to place the inmate \nwould make it unsafe to move the inmate to home confinement within that 14 day period. \nHome Confinement Reconsiderations  \n12.  Petitioner’s counsel may, based on a good faith belief, submit to Respondent and \nBOP for the Home Confinement Committee’s reconsideration any inmate who was denied home \nconfinement but whose Review Worksheets or PATTERN Worksheets produced to Petitioner’s \ncounsel under Section 11 contain an error or mistake of fact, including but not limited to a \nmistake in the description of an inmate’s PATTERN score or percentage of time served, or if the \nincorrect underlying medical condition(s) is listed on the worksheets for a particular inmate. \nRespondent and BOP may refuse to submit for reconsideration any such inmate to the extent \nthey disagree on a good faith basis with Petitioner’s counsel’s determination that an error or \nmistake of fact exists or that the error or mistake of fact is material, in which case the parties’ \ndispute will be subject to the Dispute Resolution Procedures in Section 23.   \n13.  Respondent and BOP agree to submit the 54 List One Inmates set out in the list \nattached to this Agreement as Exhibit B (“Exhibit B Inmates”) to the Home Confinement \nCommittee for it to reconsider their denials of home confinement.  The Home Confinement \nCommittee’s re-review for home confinement of the Exhibit B Inmates will comply with \nSections 7 through 11 of this Agreement, and is subject to enforcement under this Agreement.  \n14.  The BOP agrees that, if an inmate’s lack of a release plan is, or is among, the \nreason(s) for denial of home confinement, and a suitable release plan is subsequently presented, \neach such inmate will have the right to apply, on their own initiative, for a home confinement re-\nreview.  Such inmates shall be re-reviewed first by the institution, and, if denied again by the \ninstitution, then by the Home Confinement Committee.  Where a pending charge, detainer, or \n11 \n \n\nwarrant is, or is among, the reason(s) for denial of home confinement, and that pending charge, \ndetainer, or warrant has been resolved, each such inmate will have the right to apply, on their \nown initiative, for a home confinement review.  Such inmates shall be re-reviewed first by the \ninstitution, and, if denied again by the institution, then by the Home Confinement Committee. \nAll such home confinement re-reviews under this Section will comply with Sections 7 through \n11 of this Agreement, and are subject to enforcement under this Agreement.  This Section \napplies to all List Two Inmates and Non-List Inmates, as well as to List One Inmates previously \ndenied home confinement by the Home Confinement Committee. \nResolution and Release of Claims  \n15.  The parties agree that this Agreement resolves all claims in the above-captioned \ncase.  \n16.  The named Petitioner and all members of the Medically Vulnerable Class, as \ndefined in Section 1, individually and behalf of all their respective heirs, beneficiaries, \nsuccessors and assigns, in consideration of the benefits of this Agreement, release and forever \ndischarge the Respondent and BOP, and all their respective present and former officers, \nemployees, agents, heirs, successors and assigns, from all actions, causes of action, suits, claims, \nor controversies, for any and all forms of non-monetary relief arising from or based on either: (i) \nany denial of home confinement or exercise of the BOP’s statutory authority to transfer prisoners \nto home confinement which may be brought during the time this Agreement is in effect, except \nas otherwise provided under this Agreement, or (ii) any acts or omissions alleged or that could \nhave been alleged in the Action relating to the COVID-19 pandemic occurring prior to the \nEffective Date.  For the avoidance of doubt, this release applies to any and all Medically \nVulnerable Class members’ habeas corpus cases pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 seeking any relief \n12 \n \n\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Date.  The \naforementioned releases do not apply to sentence reduction/compassionate release motions filed \npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582.  \nDuration and Termination of Settlement \n17.  The parties intend that this Agreement will remain in place until October 31, \n2021, but upon the mutual consent of the parties, this date of termination may be modified, \nshortened or extended.  Additionally, the parties may make a motion to extend or motion to \nterminate this Agreement based on any substantial change in circumstances related to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic’s effect on FCI Danbury or other good faith basis.   \n18.  Upon termination, without the need for any further order of any state or federal \ncourt, all jurisdiction of any court to enforce this Agreement shall end.   \nCertification of the Settlement Class and Conditional Dismissal  \n19.  This Agreement is not a consent decree and shall not be incorporated into any \njudgment of the Court.  To the contrary, this is a settlement agreement which the parties agree is \na fair, reasonable and adequate resolution of this case.   \n20.  The Petitioner shall file a consent motion for certification of the Medically \nVulnerable Class within 5 days of the Effective Date.  The Medically Vulnerable Subclass shall \nbe defined, as in Section 1, as “any person incarcerated at FCI Danbury anytime from the \nEffective Date until the termination date of this Agreement, October 31, 2021, unless otherwise \nmodified by the parties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, who either: (a) is a List One \nInmate or List Two Inmate, or (b) possesses one or more underlying medical conditions which, \naccording to current CDC guidance (i.e., the CDC guidance in effect at the time of the \nindividual’s home confinement review), either (i) places that inmate at increased risk of severe \n13 \n \n\nillness from COVID-19; or (ii) might place that inmate at an increased risk of severe illness from \nCOVID-19.”  Within three days of the consent motion for class certification being granted, \nPetitioner and Respondent shall jointly move for an Order to Give Notice, and for a fairness \nhearing, analogous to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e).  \n21.  Subsequent to the fairness hearing referenced above, Petitioner and Respondent \nshall jointly move pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2) to approve this Agreement and to dismiss \nthe Petition subject to the parties’ compliance with the terms of the Agreement.  The dismissal \nshall be with prejudice and without costs as to all claims asserted in the Action by the Medically \nVulnerable Class pertaining to home confinement review and all other claims released under \nSection 16.  This dismissal will be without prejudice and without costs to all other claims \nbrought in the Action.  The parties agree that the Court shall retain jurisdiction over the parties \nand this case to the full extent necessary to enforce the terms of the Agreement.  \n22.  Throughout the duration of the Agreement, the parties agree to enforce the \nAgreement and resolve any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this \nAgreement, only pursuant to the procedures outlined in Section 23 of this Agreement (the \n“Dispute Resolution Procedures”).  The parties understand and agree that, if approved, and the \nCourt consents, the Court will maintain jurisdiction of this action throughout the duration of the \nAgreement to resolve any disputes which cannot be amicably resolved between the parties \npursuant to the Dispute Resolution Procedures set forth in Section 23.  If the parties are unable to \nresolve any such disputes with the assistance of the Settlement Judge, the Court shall retain \njurisdiction to enforce the provisions of the Agreement and the Petitioner may seek specific \nperformance of the Agreement.   \n \n14 \n \n\nDispute Resolution Procedures  \n23.  The following Dispute Resolution Procedures will govern any dispute, \ncontroversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or any breach or enforcement \nof this Agreement:  \na.  In the event of any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this \nAgreement, or any breach or enforcement of this Agreement, counsel for the \nparties shall meet and confer with each other before seeking intervention from the \nCourt.  The parties agree to meet and confer within 5 days of notice of a dispute.  \nb.  Either Party may request that the Honorable Thomas O. Farrish, United States \nMagistrate Judge or, if Judge Farrish is not available, another D. Conn. United \nStates Magistrate Judge (the “Settlement Judge”), participate in a meet and \nconfer, or in a meeting subsequent to a meet and confer, in order to facilitate \ninformal resolution of the issue. \nc.  If the parties are unable to resolve their dispute informally, they may seek \nintervention from the Court. \nd.  Petitioner agrees he shall not file a motion for contempt in connection with this \nAgreement.  The Court may not entertain a motion for contempt and the Court \nmay not grant any remedial relief in the nature of a contempt of court finding \nagainst Respondent or BOP.  If Petitioner prevails on any claim alleging \nRespondent’s or BOP’s non-compliance with this Agreement, the sole remedy \nshall be specific performance of this Agreement.   \ne.  The Petitioner agrees not to seek any attorneys’ fees and/or costs for any time \nspent in any portion of dispute resolution.  \n15 \n \n\nf.  The Home Confinement Committee’s substantive determination of whether to \nplace any particular member of the Medically Vulnerable Class on home \nconfinement shall not be subject to judicial review, except that the Court may \norder the BOP to have the Home Confinement Committee reconsider a home \nconfinement denial that is based upon erroneous factual underpinnings pursuant to \nSection 12 of this Agreement or a failure to comply with the terms of the \nAgreement, and may compel specific performance of this Agreement. \nOther Provisions  \n \n24.  This Agreement may be modified only by the mutual written agreement of all \nparties.  \n25.  This Agreement will not be interpreted against any party as the drafter, and it \nshall only ever be interpreted as if the organizational headings within the Settlement Terms do \nnot exist.   \n26.  The parties agree that this Agreement may be made public, and Petitioner \nexpressly consents to such release and disclosure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b). \n27.  This Agreement shall in no way be deemed an admission by any party of liability, \nfault, misconduct, or a violation of any policies, procedures, or federal, state, or local laws or \nregulations.  Neither this Agreement nor the fact of this settlement shall be construed to be, nor \nshall it be, admissible in any proceeding as evidence of an admission by any party of a violation \nof any policies, procedures, or federal, state, or local laws or regulations; nor shall this \nAgreement or the fact of settlement constitute evidence of any admission by any party as to any \nissue of law or fact.  This Agreement is entered into by all parties for the purpose of \ncompromising disputed claims and avoiding the expenses and risks of litigation.  This \n16 \n \n\nAgreement shall only ever be admissible in a proceeding to enforce its terms. \n28.  It is understood between the parties that certain presently unforeseeable events or \nconditions, including but not limited to changes in the established treatment practices or standard \nof care for treatment of COVID-19 infection or the prevalence or effect of COVID-19 in the state \nof Connecticut, may prevent or obviate the need for compliance with this Agreement.  If so, the \nparties agree to enter into good-faith discussions to attempt to resolve such issues or modify or \nterminate this Agreement as appropriate.  In the event the parties are unable to reach agreement, \nthe Dispute Resolution Procedures in Section 23 shall apply. \n29.  The provisions of this Agreement may be temporarily suspended or modified in \npart or in their entirety if the Respondent or her designees determine that a “genuine emergency” \nexists at FCI Danbury.  Genuine emergency means any special circumstances under which it is \nreasonable to conclude that there is any actual or potential threat to the security of FCI Danbury, \nor to the safety of the staff, prisoners or other persons within any one of the institution’s \nfacilities.  If a “genuine emergency” lasts longer than forty-eight hours, or occurs more than once \nin a one-week period, Respondent shall report to Petitioner’s counsel, within forty-eight hours \nexcept for good cause, the date of the emergency, the nature of the emergency, and which \nprovisions of this Agreement have been temporarily suspended.  For the avoidance of doubt, this \nSection is subject to the Dispute Resolution Procedures in Section 23. \n30.  Petitioner’s counsel agrees not to seek any attorneys’ fees, costs or expenses of \nany kind for their past or future work on this case.   \n \n \n \n17 \n \n\n\n\n",

(ECF Nos. 134-1). On August 11, 2020, the Court certified the proposed class identified in \nthe Settlement (the “Class”) for purposes of the Settlement, issued an Order of Notice to the Class, and \nappointed the undersigned as Class Counsel (ECF No. 141).  \nApplying the principles of Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23(e) to this case, Class Counsel request that the \nCourt grant approval of the Settlement. The Settlement is the product of a complex and extended set of \nnegotiations and, in Class Counsel’s view, represents a unique and important landmark on behalf of \nincarcerated individuals in the custody of the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in the COVID-19 era. \nClass Counsel believe that this litigation and the Settlement have succeeded in bringing to the fore and \nremedying the inadequacies, prior to the commencement of this lawsuit, of the Bureau of Prison’s  \nhome  confinement  release  procedures.  Building  on  the  protections  afforded  by  the  Temporary \nRestraining Order (“TRO”) issued by this Court on May 12, 2020, the Settlement provides remedies to \nenable more individuals to be in safer conditions than before the litigation began. The parties seek this \nCourt’s approval of the Settlement. \nINTRODUCTION \nOn March 27, 2020, with its enactment of the CARES Act, Congress gave the federal Bureau \nof Prisons (“BOP”) the authority to transfer any federal prisoner to home confinement provided that \nthe Attorney General made a finding that “emergency conditions will materially affect the functioning \nof the Bureau.”1 Attorney General Barr made that finding on April 3, 2020, and singled out FCI \nDanbury along with two other prisons as the sites of the most severe COVID-19 outbreaks in the federal \nsystem.2 At that time, Attorney General Barr issued a directive to the BOP to “maximize” the use of \n \n1 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, Pub. L. No. 116-136, § 12003(b)(2) (2020). \n2 Memorandum from Attorney Gen. to Director of Bureau of Prisons, Increasing Use of Home Confinement at Institutions \nMost Affected by COVID-19 (Apr. 3, 2020), available at https://www.justice.gov/file/1266661/download.  \n \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 12 of 52\nhome confinement and “immediately review all inmates who have COVID-19 risk factors” for \npotential placement in home confinement.  \nYet a month later, the BOP had released only twenty-one individuals to home confinement from \nthe three facilities at FCI Danbury, a federal prison complex in Danbury, Connecticut which includes \na women’s low-security satellite (the “FSL”), a women’s minimum security facility (the “camp”), and \na men’s low security prison (the “men’s facility”). FCI Danbury had put in place no system to prioritize \nconsideration of the medically vulnerable for home confinement or to give weight to their COVID-19 \nrisk factors in the decision. Moreover, officials were automatically denying release to individuals based \non factors unrelated to public safety.  \nPetitioners Dianthe Martinez-Brooks, Rejeanne Collier, Jackie Madore and Kenneth Cassidy \nbrought this lawsuit on April 27, 2020 to redress these problems and the lack of safety for those held \nin FCI Danbury. After the lawsuit began, and as this Court held a hearing on Petitioners’ Emergency \nMotion  for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction, held status conferences, issued \nrulings, encouraged the parties to work with the Magistrate Judge, and certified the settlement class, \nthe BOP has identified as eligible for and released approximately 100 Class members from FCI \nDanbury to home confinement or halfway houses.3  \nThe Settlement now before the Court is the result of intense efforts, through both litigation and \nnegotiation, to vindicate the constitutional rights of the Class by ensuring that the BOP implements a \nmeaningful home confinement review process to protect medically vulnerable people from unsafe \nincarceration due to the risks that COVID-19 poses to them. The Class is comprised of individuals who \nare incarcerated at any of the three facilities at FCI Danbury who are recognized as medically \nvulnerable, as well as all those later identified as having a medical condition that places them or may \n \n3 Approximately 45 Class members have been released by other means including through compassionate release orders \nfrom their sentencing judges or by reaching the end of their sentences.  \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 13 of 52\nplace them at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 under guidance from the United States \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”).4  \n  This Settlement provides three principal benefits. First, the Settlement requires Respondent to \nadhere to the procedures and standards established by this Court in its TRO, which changed the method \nby which the BOP reviews people for home confinement due to the health risk imposed by COVID-\n19, and sets out a procedure for Class Counsel to identify additional members of the Class, including \nrequiring Respondent to facilitate that process by informing newly incarcerated individuals of the \nSettlement and their opportunity to have medical records reviewed by Class Counsel. \n  Second,  the  Settlement  provides  for  expedited  consideration  for  home  confinement  in \ncompliance with the standards set forth by this Court in its TRO, which include, inter alia, that \n“substantial weight” be given to an individual’s COVID-19 risk factors in the home confinement \ndetermination. Those denied home confinement at FCI Danbury will be reviewed by the BOP’s Home \nConfinement Committee (“HCC”) in Washington, D.C. Denial decisions must be supported by a \nwritten explanation of factors relied upon to deny home confinement despite the danger posed by \nCOVID-19 to the incarcerated individual. \n   Third, under the Settlement, this Court retains jurisdiction to oversee the process and enforce \nviolations of the Settlement. The Court may, for example, require re-review if the HCC relies on \nerroneous factual information or fails to apply the proper standards.  \nBecause of this litigation and the significant provisions in the Settlement that benefit the Class, \nthis Settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate as required by Rule 23. The Settlement affords the \nClass a meaningful home confinement review process without limiting their ability to pursue other \n \n4 Under its updated guidance, the CDC distinguishes between conditions that are scientifically established to increase risk \nof severe illness from COVID-19 (designated as “Tier I medical conditions” in the Settlement) and those for which there is \nstill only limited data but which, on the basis of current available science, the CDC believes might put individuals at \nincreased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 (designated as “Tier II medical conditions”). The conditions in each \ncategory can be found on the CDC’s website: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-\nwith-medical-conditions.html.  \n \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 14 of 52\nforms of relief. For example, Class members may, consistent with this Settlement, pursue individual \nactions for monetary damages against Respondent or her staff for FCI Danbury’s response to COVID-\n19. Members of the Class are, further, not precluded from pursuing equitable relief in the future, should \nit be needed to ensure adequate social distancing or other changes to the congregate housing conditions \nat FCI Danbury.5 In short, the Settlement substantially benefits the Class and, at the same time, \npreserves the Class members’ future rights to seek relief from unsafe conditions at FCI Danbury. Class \nCounsel therefore request that this Court conclude that the Settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate \nand grant it final approval.  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA.  Procedural History \nMulti-Party Petition  \n  On April 27, 2020, Dianthe Martinez-Brooks, Rejeanne Collier, Jackie Madore and Kenneth \nCassidy6 brought this multi-party habeas action against Warden Diane Easter on behalf of a proposed \nclass of all individuals held at FCI Danbury. At the time the Petition was filed, there were 728 men at \nthe men’s facility, 165 women at the FSL, and 153 women at the camp. (ECF No. 1, ¶ 35). \n  Petitioners alleged that they were at imminent risk of contracting COVID-19 because of the \nunsafe, congregate conditions in which prisoners were held. Petitioners also identified a subclass of \nthose who had medical conditions that the CDC said placed people at heightened risk of serious illness \nor death if they contract COVID-19.   \n \n5 Because the Settlement does not resolve the claims of individuals outside of the Class, it does not prevent non-Class \nmembers incarcerated at FCI Danbury from bringing any claims they may have against the federal government or its \nofficials. \n6 This action was originally brought by the four above-referenced petitioners. Mr. Cassidy was released on May 13, 2020 \nafter his sentencing judge granted his compassionate release motion. Dianthe Martinez-Brooks and Rejeanne Collier were \nreleased in June 2020 on home confinement pursuant to the home confinement process established by this Court’s TRO. \nClass Counsel filed voluntary dismissal of these three petitioners’ claims, and filed an Amended Petition pursuant to Rule \n21 (ECF No. 111) naming Amanda Cooper and James Whitted (along with original petitioner Jackie Madore) as named \nclass representatives. Since the filing of the Amended Petition, Ms. Madore and Ms. Cooper have been released from FCI \nDanbury and placed on home confinement (see ECF Nos. 130 and 131), leaving Mr. Whitted currently as the named class \nrepresentative. This memorandum will use the plural term “Petitioners” in reference to allegations made or relief sought in \nprior pleadings. \n \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 15 of 52\n  Petitioners alleged that because of the unsafe conditions at FCI Danbury and the resulting \ndanger they faced of contracting COVID-19 while incarcerated at FCI Danbury, their confinement was \nunconstitutional in violation of their Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishments. \nAt the time the lawsuit was filed, the COVID-19 outbreak was at its height in Fairfield County, where \nFCI Danbury is located, and in the communities nearby and across the state. The virus was rapidly \nspreading through FCI Danbury’s crowded dorms in March, with the first confirmed cases in the FSL \nand the men’s facility in late March. As of April 15, 2020, at least 44 prisoners and 39 staff members \nhad tested positive for COVID-19, and one person had died. (ECF No. 1, ¶ 40). There was no facility-\nwide testing done at the facility before May, and thus these numbers likely vastly understated the \noutbreak. Indeed, of those tested at the facility in March and April, 79% were positive.7  \n  As the Petition explained, on March 27, 2020, with the CARES Act, Congress gave the Bureau \nof Prisons the authority to transfer any federal prisoner to home confinement provided that the Attorney \nGeneral made a finding that “emergency conditions will materially affect the functioning of the \nBureau.” CARES Act, Pub. L. No. 116-136, § 12003(b)(2) (2020). Attorney General Barr made that \nfinding on April 3, 2020, naming FCI Danbury along with two other facilities as sites of “significant \nlevels of infection” and urging BOP “to move with dispatch in using home confinement, where \nappropriate, to move vulnerable inmates out of these institutions.”8 In his April 3 memo, Attorney \nGeneral Barr noted the BOP’s “profound obligation to protect the health and safety of all inmates,” and \ndirected it to “immediately review all inmates who have COVID-19 risk factors, as established by the \nCDC,”  to  “immediately  maximize  appropriate  transfers”  to  home  confinement,  and  to  “begin \nimplementing this directive immediately.”9 However, despite the urgency expressed in the Attorney \nGeneral’s directive and the severity of the outbreak at FCI Danbury, few from FCI Danbury had been \n \n7 The high percentage of positive tests is apparent from the data contained in a May 5, 2020 declaration from Warden Easter. \n(See ECF No. 24-2, Ex. A ¶¶ 83-85).   \n8 Memorandum from Attorney Gen. to Director of Bureau of Prisons, Increasing Use of Home Confinement at Institutions \nMost Affected by COVID-19 (Apr. 3, 2020), available at https://www.justice.gov/file/1266661/download.  \n9 Id. at 1-2.  \n \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 16 of 52\ntransferred to home confinement.  \n  The  Petition  and  Petitioners’  Emergency  Motion  for  Temporary  Restraining  Order  and \nPreliminary Injunction, filed on April 30, 2020, sought a two-part response to the COVID dangers \nfacing the class of all prisoners and the subclass of medically vulnerable prisoners at FCI Danbury.  \n(ECF Nos. 14, 15). First, Petitioners alleged that the BOP had failed to abide by the Attorney General’s \ndirectives and had not made full and sufficient use of its authority to transfer medically vulnerable \nindividuals to home confinement to protect them against COVID-19 at FCI Danbury. To cure these \nfailures, Petitioners sought orders requiring FCI Danbury to undertake the immediate transfer of \nmedically vulnerable individuals to home confinement or other appropriate settings.   \n  Second, Petitioners alleged that FCI Danbury had failed to implement the measures necessary \nto protect the entire prison population from COVID-19 infection. Petitioners further contended that \nFCI Danbury’s failure to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic had put Petitioners and putative class \nmembers at unacceptably heightened risk of injury and illness unrelated to COVID-19; breakdowns in \nthe healthcare system at FCI Danbury resulted in prisoners with urgent health needs going without \nnecessary treatment. With respect to these failures, Petitioners sought immediate implementation of \nthe social distancing and hygiene measures essential to lowering the risk of disease and death. \nPetitioners also requested measures be taken to bring the system of healthcare delivery at Danbury up \nto the constitutional minima.   \nTemporary Restraining Order and Identification of Medically Vulnerable Individuals \n  On May 12, 2020, after a hearing on petitioners’ Motion on May 6, 2020, this Court issued a \nTRO granting in part Petitioners’ request for provisional remedies.10 (ECF No. 30). This Court found \nthat the facts regarding the BOP’s use of its home confinement authority were largely undisputed. As \nof May 5, only 21 people had been released on home confinement out of approximately 159 reviewed.11 \n \n10 The Court also denied Respondent’s Motion to Dismiss, which had been filed on May 5, 2020. \n11 During the discovery process, FCI Danbury officials were unable to say how many of the 159 people reviewed were \nmedically vulnerable, or to account for the identities of everyone reviewed prior to the issuance of the TRO. Discovery \n \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 17 of 52\nThis Court held that those facts established that officials at FCI Danbury had made only limited use of \ntheir home confinement authority and other tools at their disposal to protect incarcerated people during \nthe outbreak.  \n  Accordingly,  this  Court  entered  an  Order  provisionally  certifying  the  following  class  of \nindividuals who are medically vulnerable to COVID-19 in accordance with CDC guidelines: \nAll individuals in custody at FCI Danbury, while the threat of COVID-19 at the \nfacility remains, who are aged 65 or over and/or who have any of the following \nconditions  specifically  identified  by  the  United  States  Centers  for  Disease \nControl as putting them at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19: (a) \nchronic lung disease including moderate to severe asthma, COPD, emphysema, \nchronic bronchitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and/or cystic fibrosis; (b) \nimmunocompromised  status,  including  status  as  a  transplant  recipient,  on \nchemotherapy,  HIV  positive,  prolonged  use  of  corticosteroids,  using \nimmunosuppressive medication, and/or having an immune deficiency; (c) severe \nobesity (BMI of 40 or higher); (d) diabetes mellitus Type I or Type II, (e) \ngestational diabetes mellitus; (f) chronic kidney disease on dialysis; (g) chronic \nliver diseases, cirrhosis; and/or (h) serious heart conditions, including congestive \nheart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, \nand/or pulmonary hypertension. \n \n(ECF No. 30 at 65-66 n.32).   \n  The  Court  ordered  expedited  consideration  of  home  confinement  for  all  such  medically \nvulnerable class members and set forth standards for determining their suitability for home confinement \nrelease. In its May 12 Order, the Court noted the main factual disputes between the parties regarding \nwhat  measures  Respondent  had  undertaken  and  the  efficacy  of  those  measures  in  protecting \nincarcerated  individuals  from  a  COVID-19  outbreak.  The  Court  declined  to  issue  a  temporary \nrestraining order compelling FCI Danbury to implement other safety protocols. (ECF No. 30 at 60-62). \nThe Court scheduled an evidentiary hearing on Petitioners’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction for June \n11 and 12, 2020. (Id. at 74).  \n \nrevealed that on April 1, 2020 FCI Danbury received a list from BOP of 238 individuals with COVID-19 risk factors. \nHowever, it appears that the facility took no action with respect to this list until after the lawsuit was filed. Even then, there \nwas no process put in place to ensure that everyone on the April 1, 2020 list was reviewed for home confinement.  \n \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 18 of 52\n  As a result of the TRO, the parties engaged in discussion on how to identify individuals \nimprisoned at FCI Danbury who were part of the Medically Vulnerable Class. Petitioners’ counsel, \nusing the expert assistance of Dr. Jaimie Meyer, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Yale School of \nMedicine  board-certified  in  internal  medicine  and  infectious  diseases  and  addiction  medicine, \nidentified a set of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes that represented medical conditions identified by the CDC \nas high-risk factors for severe illness from COVID-19.  \n  Respondent conducted a search of BOP medical records using those codes, and on May 15, \n2020, as required by the TRO, Respondent filed an initial list identifying 314 inmates who were \npotential  members  of  the  Medically  Vulnerable  Class.  (“List  One  Inmates”;  see  ECF  No.  41). \nSubsequent to this initial search, Petitioners’ counsel, with the assistance of Dr. Meyer, met and \nconferred with Respondent’s counsel regarding conditions rendering individuals medically vulnerable \nthat had been missed in the initial search and identified additional codes that more accurately captured \nthe conditions that render someone medically vulnerable to COVID-19 in light of BOP’s method of \nmedical coding. Respondent agreed to run a second search of BOP’s record systems, using a new set \nof ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes identified by Petitioners’ counsel with the assistance of Dr. Meyer. \nCounsel’s request resulted in BOP adding 111 individuals who were also potential members of the \nMedically Vulnerable Class.12 Subsequently, and again at Petitioners’ counsel’s request, Respondent \nagreed to add an additional 14 inmates in the second list of inmates whom it agreed to treat as members \nof the Medically Vulnerable Class. (“List Two Inmates”; see ECF No. 134-1, at 27-29).  \n \n \n \n12 Although Petitioners’ counsel and Respondent agreed on the codes Respondent would search, Petitioners’ counsel \nmaintained that such a search, and any search reliant solely on ICD codes, would not identify all individuals who the CDC \ndefines as medically vulnerable to COVID-19. With guidance from the Court, the parties put in place a system for \nPetitioners’ counsel to review medical records to identify additional class members. Notice was provided to all prisoners of \nthe lawsuit, and prisoners were given the opportunity to sign authorization forms giving Petitioners’ counsel access to the \nrecords. (ECF No. 72).   \n \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 19 of 52\nTRO-imposed Home Confinement Review Process \n  Once individuals were identified, the TRO required Respondent to review the Medically \nVulnerable Class for home confinement. On May 25, 2020, Respondent filed with the Court the results \nof its review of the List One Inmates. (ECF No. 59). After identifying errors, on May 28, 2020, this \nCourt ordered re-review with input from a medical clinician of List One Inmates who had been denied, \nand specified that individuals meeting certain criteria be reviewed by the BOP’s Home Confinement \nCommittee in Washington, D.C. (See ECF No. 68). The Court also directed the parties to try to reach \nan agreement about a process for generating a random sample of the materials reviewed by the Warden \nin making home confinement decisions to address “the Court’s need to better understand the home \nconfinement review process undertaken by the Warden in response to the temporary restraining order.” \n(Id.) Finally, the Court observed that many who had been approved for home confinement had still not \nbeen  released,  and  ordered  release  of  those  approved  by  June  4,  2020  unless  the  Respondent \ndemonstrated “that public safety or medical considerations or the absence of any home in which to \nplace the inmate would make it unsafe to move the inmate immediately to home confinement.” (Id.).  \n  On May 29, 2020, the Court ordered that individuals approved for RRC (halfway house) \nplacements who did not have a “High” PATTERN score or a violent or sexually-related offense of \nconviction be placed on home confinement unless the Respondent demonstrated “that public safety or \nmedical considerations or the absence of any home in which to place the inmate would make it unsafe \nto move the inmate immediately to home confinement.” The Court stressed that “[t]he fact that a greater \ndegree of supervision will be available at an RRC will not, by itself, be deemed sufficient to \ndemonstrate that it is unsafe to move the inmate to home confinement.” (ECF No. 70).  \n  On June 9, 2020, Respondent filed declarations with the Court regarding the re-reviews and \nactions it had taken following the May 28 and May 29 Orders. (ECF No. 90-96). However, Respondent \ndid not file with the Court the worksheets, or documentation, that accompanied these re-reviews. \nDuring the course of settlement discussions, on June 25 and 26, Petitioners received the review \n \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 20 of 52\nworksheets  for  individuals  who  had  been  re-reviewed  by  the  HCC  following  these  Orders.13 \nRespondent did not complete its home confinement review of the List Two Inmates prior to the parties’ \nexecuting the Settlement currently before the Court.  \nDiscovery and Settlement Negotiations \n  After  the  TRO  issued,  the  parties  entered  into  discovery.  Petitioners’  counsel  reviewed \napproximately 20,000 pages of documents provided by Respondent in discovery, and responded to \nRespondent’s discovery requests. (See Declaration of Attorney Sarah Russell, attached as Exhibit A, ¶ \n8). Counsel retained expert witnesses and developed expert evidence in support of Petitioners’ claims, \nconducted an inspection of the facility, reviewed competing expert reports regarding conditions at FCI \nDanbury and the BOP’s response to those conditions, took and defended multiple depositions, and \nundertook substantial preparation for the preliminary injunction hearing scheduled by the Court. (Id. \n¶¶ 9-10, 13). \n  As the case progressed, Petitioners’ counsel spent countless hours communicating via email \nand telephone with men and women incarcerated in the three facilities at FCI Danbury, as well as with \nprisoners’ family members and lawyers. (Id. ¶¶ 3-4, 6). Counsel gathered information about the \nchallenges prisoners faced in accessing health care at FCI Danbury, the experiences of those in isolation \nand quarantine, and the inability of prisoners to socially distance in their housing units. (Id. ¶ 6). \nCounsel have communicated with at least 400 prisoners at FCI Danbury—including in the FSL, the \nCamp, and the men’s prison—and with more than 150 lawyers and dozens of family members. (Id. ¶ \n4). Counsel also reviewed home confinement worksheets, PATTERN scores, and medical records, \n \n13 Following the Court’s May 28, 2020 order and between June 2 and June 9, the BOP conducted a review of some List One \nInmates, but not all, with the input of a medical clinician. (ECF No. 90-1). Respondent then indicated that 30 were suitable \nfor home confinement. (ECF No. 90-1, ¶ 8). However, this number included eight individuals who had already been \napproved for home confinement. The parties met and conferred over whether this re-review violated the May 28, 2020 order \nduring the course of settlement proceedings, and Respondent agreed to undertake a re-review at FCI Danbury of those List \nOne Inmates who had not been re-reviewed. Petitioners have not received documentation of these reviews but understand \nthat none were granted home confinement upon re-review.  \n    Following the May 29, 2020 bail order, Respondent reported, inter alia, that 4 individuals approved for halfway houses \nwere denied home confinement “due to public safety considerations.” (ECF No. 95-1, ¶ 11).   \n \n \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 21 of 52\nidentifying, where possible, errors in home confinement reviews. (Id. ¶ 11).   Counsel consulted with \nother lawyers litigating COVID-19 relating cases around the country, as well as leading prisoner rights \nand class action lawyers.  (Id. ¶ 13).   \n  Shortly before the preliminary injunction hearing was scheduled to begin, the parties entered \ninto settlement discussions. These discussions commenced on June 10, 2020, on the eve of the \nscheduled preliminary injunction hearing. (ECF No. 87). During the course of the four weeks that \nfollowed, the parties met with Magistrate Judge Farrish on nine separate occasions to attempt to reach \nsettlement; in addition, the parties had direct interactions, as they worked to find common ground. With \nthe guidance and supervision of Judge Farrish, the parties’ counsel spent more than forty hours as they \ndiscussed, disputed, and deliberated over every detail of the Settlement. (ECF Nos. 99, 102, 109, 112, \n115, 119, 120, 121, 123). During this time, counsel continued to prepare for a two-day preliminary \ninjunction hearing, as it was not clear whether the discussions would result in a settlement. (See Ex. A, \n¶ 13; ECF Nos. 87, 116). On July 27, 2020—six weeks after negotiations began—Petitioners and \nRespondent reached this Settlement. (ECF No. 128).    \n  B.  The Proposed Settlement \n  This Settlement builds on the benefits obtained as a result of the Court’s Orders in this litigation \non behalf of those imprisoned at FCI Danbury who are medically vulnerable as defined by the CDC. \nAfter this Court’s TRO, 439 individuals were identified as medically vulnerable and included on List \nOne and List Two. (See ECF No. 134-1, at 21-29). Since then, 145 of these medically vulnerable \nindividuals have been released by BOP to home confinement or halfway house placements, or through \nother means including compassionate release orders by sentencing judges or by reaching the end of \ntheir sentence.14 Despite new admissions at all three facilities, the overall population is down in each \nfacility since when the lawsuit was filed: the FSL has dropped from 165 women to 123; the Camp from \n \n14 From List One, 85 people have been released by BOP to home confinement or halfway house placements, with 35 released \nthrough other means. From List Two, 14 have been released to home confinement or halfway house placements, and 11 \nhave been released through other means.  \n \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 22 of 52\n153 women to 54, and the men’s facility from 728 men to 648.15   \n  The Class now certified for purposes of settlement (ECF No. 141) is comprised of individuals \nincarcerated at FCI Danbury who have already been identified as medically vulnerable as well as all \nthose who are later identified as having a medical condition that places them or may place them at \nincreased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 under CDC guidance. The Settlement provides a \nprocess for identification of new Class members, expedited home confinement review pursuant to \nstandards set forth in the TRO, reconsideration for some Class members, and preservation of certain \nclaims for the Class.16   \nIdentification of New Class Members  \n  The Settlement sets out a procedure for Class Counsel to identify additional members of the \nClass and requires Respondent to facilitate that process by informing newly incarcerated individuals \nof the Settlement and of their opportunity to have medical records reviewed by Class Counsel. (ECF \nNo. 134-1, ¶¶ 4-5). Specifically, Class Counsel, with the appropriate authorization, will review medical \nrecords of those incarcerated at FCI Danbury and identify those individuals believed to be part of the \nClass to Respondent. (Id.) Except in extraordinary circumstances, individuals who have been in BOP \ncustody for two years or longer will be evaluated for qualifying conditions based exclusively on their \nBOP medical records, while individuals who have been incarcerated for fewer than two years may \nsubmit outside medical records. (ECF No. 134-1, ¶ 4(e)). Any disputes over whether a particular \nindividual possesses the requisite medical conditions for membership in the Class is to be resolved by \na physician detailed to BOP from the United States Public Health Service, Department of Health and \nHuman Services. (Id. ¶ 4(c)). \n \n \n15Compare  ECF  No.  1,  ¶  35,  with  BOP,  “Population  Statistics”  (last  updated  Sept.  9,  2020), \nhttps://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/population_statistics.jsp.  \n16 Along with the Settlement, though not enforceable as such, Respondent also sent Class Counsel a letter dated July 24, \n2020 providing assurances and commitments to improve processes for testing and screening individuals for COVID-19 \nsymptoms at the facility and healthcare delivery at FCI Danbury. (ECF No. 138-1).  \n \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 23 of 52\nExpedited Home Confinement Review  \n  The Settlement then sets forth a home confinement review process based on the standards and \ncriteria ordered by the Court in its TRO. The Settlement provides that all members of the Class \nidentified in the future and all Class members on List Two are entitled to the Settlement’s home \nconfinement review process.17 Each of these individuals is entitled to expedited home confinement \nreview pursuant to the standards set forth in the Court’s TRO. (See ECF No. 134-1, ¶¶ 2,3,6, citing \nECF No. 30). Specifically, each individual is entitled to a home confinement review that, inter alia: (1) \nassign(s) substantial weight . . . to the inmate’s risk factors for COVID-19; (2) sets forth in a Review \nWorksheet the factors considered in reaching a home confinement determination; (3) does not treat any \nparticular consideration as an automatic disqualifier to home confinement; and (4) provides a written \nexplanation of any factors relied upon in a determination to deny home confinement despite the danger \nto the incarcerated individual posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. (See ECF No. 30, at 33-34). A \nmedical clinician must identify and list the individual’s COVID-19 risk factors for consideration in the \nhome confinement review.  \n  If the individual is denied home confinement by the Respondent, the Settlement provides that \nthe decision will be reviewed by the BOP’s Home Confinement Committee (HCC) in Washington D.C. \n(ECF No. 134-1, ¶¶ 3, 6). A medical clinician must be a member of the HCC during each HCC review. \n(Id. ¶ 9). The HCC must assign substantial weight to each individual’s COVID-19 risk factors and must \nprovide a written explanation for every denial that details the reasons why home confinement was \ndenied in accordance with the standards set out in the Court’s TRO. (Id. ¶¶ 3, 6). The BOP will complete \n \n17 Reviews of List Two inmates were underway during settlement negotiations. On August 26, 2020, the results of the \nreviews were produced to Petitioners’ counsel. Of the 125 individuals on List Two, 25 are no longer at FCI Danbury. \nAmong those released, the review worksheets indicate that 6 were approved for home confinement, and 4 were approved \nfor RRC placement. The remainder were released through means outside of this lawsuit including compassionate release \norders from sentencing judges or by reaching the end of their sentence. Two people approved for home confinement and \nthree approved for RRC placement have not yet been released.   \n \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 24 of 52\nthe home confinement review process within a reasonable time from the individual’s identification as \nmedically vulnerable and shall endeavor to do so within 14 days. (Id. ¶ 6.) \n  If the home confinement decision relies on erroneous factual information or fails to apply the \nproper standards, the individual is entitled to re-review of the decision using the correct information \nand proper standards. Class Counsel will initiate and oversee the re-review process and, where \nnecessary following meet  and confer  obligations,  will present  individualized home  confinement \nreviews to this Court to enforce the terms of the Settlement. (See ¶¶ 12, 23).     \nReconsideration by HCC of Some Class Members \n  The Settlement also provides for reconsideration for home confinement by the HCC of a subset \nof Class members on List One who were previously reviewed for home confinement through this \nlitigation and denied. (See id. ¶ 13; see also id. Ex. B). Class counsel identified 54 individuals from \nList One who were similarly situated to individuals who had been granted home confinement, and who \nhad significant and material errors in the previous review.  The Settlement provides for reconsideration \nby the HCC of these 54 individuals under the standards of the TRO and the terms of the Settlement. \n(Id. ¶ 13; Ex. B). 18   \nReconsideration based on Resolution of Release Plan or Pending Charges Issues \n \n  Furthermore,  Class  members  who  are  denied  home  confinement  by  the  HCC  based  on \nunsuitable release plans or pending warrants, charges, or detainers are entitled to reconsideration for \nhome confinement by FCI Danbury if those issues are resolved. (Id. ¶ 14).19 If subsequently denied by \n \n18 Respondent agreed to have the HCC reconsider these reviews under the Settlement without conceding any error in the \nprevious reviews. The remaining individuals on List One who were denied home confinement are not entitled to automatic \nreconsideration for home confinement pursuant to the Settlement. However, to the extent that the information on any \nindividual’s original home confinement review worksheet has changed based on a material change in circumstances or new \ninformation, the Settlement allows the person to submit documentation to be included in the his or her Central File and to \nseek re-review of the home confinement decision. Respondent has agreed that this provision applies to the entire Class.    \n19 Paragraph 14 of the Settlement applies by its terms to all future members of the Class, all Class members on List Two, \nand all List One Class members who were denied home confinement by the Home Confinement Committee.  The remaining \nList One Class members can seek reconsideration pursuant to the Settlement’s allowance for a request for re-review in the \nevent of a material change in circumstance or new information.   \n \n \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 25 of 52\nthe institution, these individuals are entitled to another review by the HCC. These reviews too are \ngoverned by the standards of the TRO and the terms of the Settlement.     \nPreservation of Future Injunctive Relief and Damages Claims \n  In addition to the benefits the Settlement provides to Class members, it also preserves their \nability to pursue other claims they may have against Respondent or BOP. Under the Settlement, Class \nmembers retain the right to pursue damages relief for Respondent’s responses to the COVID-19 \npandemic and retain the right to pursue injunctive relief against Respondent to provide adequate social \ndistancing and other changes to the congregate housing conditions at FCI Danbury, for events and \ncircumstances arising after July 27, 2020. (Id. ¶ 16). Class members also have the ability to continue \npursuing sentence reduction/compassionate release motions filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582. (Id.). \nThus, the Settlement requires the Class to release Respondent only from any equitable relief claims \narising out of the home confinement review process or Respondent’s handling of the COVID-19 \npandemic prior to July 27, 2020. (Id.). As such, the Settlement leaves intact any claim for recompense \nfor prior constitutional harms and ensures that Class members (as well as all other individuals confined \nat FCI Danbury who are not Class members) are empowered to vindicate their right to constitutional \nconditions of confinement in the here and now as the pandemic crisis continues.   \nC.  Notice to the Class. \n  Pursuant to this Court’s order of August 11, 2020 (ECF No. 141), Counsel worked with \nRespondent to distribute notice within FCI Danbury as directed by the Court.20 Respondent has \ncertified its compliance with distribution of notice throughout the facility (ECF No. 142). Class counsel \nalso communicated with more than 300 individuals at FCI Danbury with whom counsel has a \nconnection via the Corrlinks/Trulincs system. (Ex. A, ¶ 15). Counsel responded to questions, mailed \n \n20 The Court ordered Class Counsel to disseminate the Notice to the Class Members via Corrlinks/Trulincs. (ECF No. 141 \nat ¶ 10). Because Class Counsel cannot on their own disseminate a document to all individuals incarcerated at FCI Danbury \n(the potential Class members), Class Counsel caused the Notice to be disseminated via Corrlinks/Trulincs and paper posting \nvia Respondent and BOP staff at FCI Danbury.  \n \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 26 of 52\ncopies of the Settlement to those who requested it, and provided reminders about the deadline and \nmanner of filing objections. (Id.). Overall, there have been more than 540 contacts to Class Counsel \nthrough the Corrlinks/Trulincs prison email system since the notice was published (id.), and additional \ncontacts to Class Counsel by telephone or by emails from attorneys or family members of prisoners.  \nLEGAL STANDARD FOR ASSESSING PROPOSED CLASS SETTLEMENTS \n  Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a class action may not be \nsettled without the approval of the Court. The determination whether to approve a settlement is \ncommitted to the Court’s discretion. Joel A. v. Giuliani, 218 F.3d 132, 139 (2d Cir. 2000); In re Merrill \nLynch Tyco Research Securities Litigation, 249 F.R.D. 124, 132 (S.D.N.Y. 2008). As a matter of public \npolicy, federal courts favor the settlement of disputed claims, particularly in complex class actions. \nWal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 396 F.3d 96, 116 (2d Cir. 2005) (“We are mindful of the \n‘strong judicial policy in favor of settlements, particularly in the class action context’”) (citation \nomitted); In re Global Crossing Sec. & ERISA Litig., 225 F.R.D. 436, 455 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (“[F]ederal \ncourts favor settlement, especially in complex and large-scale disputes, so as to encourage compromise \nand conserve judicial and private resources. Accordingly, this Court will take into consideration such \npublic policy concerns in exercising its discretion”) (citations omitted). When reviewing a proposed \nsettlement of a class action, the Court must determine whether the proposed settlement is “fair, \nreasonable and adequate.” In re Luxottica Group S.p.A. Sec. Litig., 233 F.R.D. 306, 310 (E.D.N.Y. \n2006). The Court must examine both the negotiating process leading to the settlement (procedural \nfairness) and the settlement’s substantive terms (substantive fairness). See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e); Wal-\nMart, 396 F.3d at 116; In re Merrill Lynch Tyco, 249 F.R.D. at 133. \n  Rule 23 was amended in 2018 to provide additional guidance and make uniform the criteria to \nconsider when class action settlements are proposed.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, 2018 Advisory Committee \nNotes. The four key factors to consider are whether: (A) the class representative and class counsel have \nadequately represented the class; (B) the proposal was negotiated at arm’s-length; (C) the relief \n \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 27 of 52\nprovided to the class is adequate; and (D) the proposal treats class members equitably relative to one \nanother.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(A)-(D).  \n  Prior to the 2018 amendments, courts in this Circuit determining the fairness of a proposed class \naction settlement applied the Grinnell factors drawn from the Second Circuit’s 1974 opinion in City of \nDetroit v. Grinnell Corp., 495 F.2d 448 (2d Cir. 1974), abrogated on other grounds by Goldberger v. \nIntegrated Resources, Inc., 209 F.3d 43 (2d Cir. 2000):  \n(1) the complexity, expense and likely duration of the litigation, (2) the reaction \nof the class to the settlement, (3) the stage of the proceedings and the amount of \ndiscovery completed, (4) the risks of establishing liability, (5) the risks of \nestablishing damages, (6) the risks of maintaining the class action through the \ntrial, (7) the ability of the defendants to withstand a greater judgment, (8) the \nrange of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of the best possible \nrecovery, [and] (9) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund to a \npossible recovery in light of all the attendant risks of litigation. \n \nId. at 463. The 2018 amendments elaborate upon, rather than displace, the Grinnell factors. In re \nPayment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, 330 F.R.D. 11, 29 \n(E.D.N.Y. 2019), citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, 2018 Advisory Committee Notes (“The goal of this \namendment is not to displace any factor, but rather to focus the court and the lawyers on the core \nconcerns of procedure and substance that should guide the decision whether to approve the proposal.”). \nAccordingly, the court considers both sets of factors in its analysis of whether the proposed settlement \nis fair, reasonable, and adequate, and whether to grant final approval. In re Payment Card Interchange \nFee, 330 F.R.D. at 29; Berni v. Barilla G. e R. Fratelli, S.p.A., 332 F.R.D. 14, 33 (E.D.N.Y. 2019) \n(“Rule 23(e)(2)(C), however, requires the Court to consider specifically formulated subfactors that \nvary, albeit minimally, from the Grinnell factors”).  \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE LENGTHY COURT-SUPERVISED NEGOTIATION THAT RESULTED IN \nTHE SETTLEMENT WAS PROCEDURALLY FAIR.  \n \n  The first two factors set forth in the 2018 amendments— whether: (A) the class representative \nand class counsel have adequately represented the class; and (B) the proposal was negotiated at arm’s-\n \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 28 of 52\nlength—correspond to the traditional Grinnell factors focused on the procedural fairness of the \nsettlement. “To determine procedural fairness, courts examine the negotiating process leading to the \nsettlement.” In re Sturm, Ruger, & Co., Inc.

When \nweighing this factor, the Court “need not find that the parties have engaged in extensive discovery. . . \nInstead, it is enough for the parties to have engaged in sufficient investigation of the facts to enable the \nCourt to intelligently make an appraisal of the Settlement.” In re Austrian & German Bank Holocaust \nLitig., 80 F.Supp.2d at 176 (internal quotations and citations omitted). \nThroughout the litigation, and for weeks prior to bringing suit, counsel spent hundreds of hours \nin communication with the named class representatives and countless other prisoners at FCI Danbury \nand became thoroughly acquainted with the conditions at the prison, the problems with medical care \ndelivery at the facility and the specific medical vulnerabilities of Class members, including the \nexperiences of those in isolation and quarantine, and the inability of prisoners to socially distance in \ntheir housing units. (Ex. A ¶ 6). The level of detail of counsel’s understanding of both the conditions \nin the facility and the unique medical needs of the members of the Class is fully evidenced in the 19 \nprisoner  declarations  submitted  as  exhibits  to  the  original  Petition  and  Petitioners’  Motion  for \nTemporary Restraining Order—the vast majority of which were prepared as a result of ongoing back \nand forth Corrlinks communications with Class members while the prison was closed to visitors during \nthe pandemic. (Id. ¶ 5). Counsel also pursued extensive additional contacts on behalf of Class members \nwith their families and legal representatives including obtaining voluminous medical records and other \nrelevant documentation about the circumstances of their convictions and incarceration. (Id. ¶ 6). All \ntold,  throughout  the  period  of  preparing  and  litigating  this  case,  counsel  has  had  ongoing \ncommunications with at least 400 prisoners at FCI Danbury—including in the FSL, the Camp, and the \nmen’s prison—and at least 150 lawyers and dozens of family members. (Id. ¶ 4).  \n  In addition to these investigations prior to and outside of the litigation process, as this Court is \naware from its active involvement in the management of this case, counsel has also been involved in \n \n \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 31 of 52\nsignificant information-gathering through intensive litigation and discovery. Between April 27, 2020 \nand June 8, 2020, Class Counsel:  \n•  Engaged in formal written discovery including propounding and responding to an extensive \nseries of requests for admission, requests for production, and interrogatories, as well as \nconducting informal discovery;   \n \n•  Reviewed approximately 20,000 pages of documents produced by Respondent in discovery \nincluding  class  medical  records,  BOP  policies,  staff  emails,  and  documents  recounting \nRespondent’s actions following onset of the COVID-19 pandemic;  \n \n•  Retained two experts, Dr. Jaimie Meyer and Dr. Homer Venters, who prepared expert reports \nin this matter. Dr. Venters conducted a physical inspection at FCI Danbury prior to issuing his \nreport along with a member of the Class Counsel team;  \n \n•  Conducted six depositions, including a 30(b)(6) deposition of Respondent’s representative \nregarding healthcare delivery and conditions at FCI Danbury and depositions of Respondent’s \ntwo expert witnesses, Mr. Beard and Ms. Tekbali;  \n \n•  Defended depositions of Petitioners’ two expert witnesses and defended the deposition of a \nnamed petitioner in the action;  \n \n•  Filed a motion for sanctions against Respondent for spoliation seeking to ensure that in the \nfuture crucial medical records would not be destroyed prior to Class Counsel’s ability to review \nthem; and \n \n•  Prepared to present testimony and evidence at a preliminary injunction hearing before this \nCourt.  \n  \n(Ex. A, ¶¶ 8-10, 12-14).  \n \nCounsel has also fully investigated the considerations relevant to the home confinement \ndeterminations that are at the heart of the relief sought for the medically vulnerable Class members. \nCounsel have scrutinized home confinement worksheets and PATTERN scores, comparing them, \nwhere possible, to information available from other sources including medical records, dockets of \nunderlying criminal cases and presentence reports. (Id. ¶ 11). Counsel have been aggressive in \nidentifying errors in information utilized in the BOP’s home confinement reviews and have brought \nthose errors to the attention of Respondent’s counsel and, where appropriate, in filings to this Court. \n(Id.; see also ECF No. 67).   \n \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 32 of 52\n  There is no question that this intensive information-gathering and discovery process—which \nincluded motion practice and every form of discovery available to the parties—was “sufficiently \nadversarial that [it was] not designed to justify a settlement . . . [,but] an aggressive effort to ferret out \nfacts helpful to the prosecution of the suit.” Martens v. Smith Barney, Inc., 181 F.R.D. 243, 263 \n(S.D.N.Y.  1998).  Class  Counsel  therefore  had  ample  information  to  evaluate  the  strengths  and \nweaknesses of the claims and defenses asserted and the propriety of settlement. See Chatelain, 805 F. \nSupp. at 213-14 (“Given that document discovery and extensive discussions have already been \nconducted and resulted in the Stipulation of Settlement, all counsel are undoubtedly acting with a firm \ngrasp of the strengths and weaknesses of the case.”); Ingles v. Toro, 438 F. Supp. 2d 203, 213 (S.D.N.Y. \n2006) (settlement negotiated after extensive discovery supports a finding of procedural fairness).  \n  In short, Class Counsel had a “clear view of the strengths and weaknesses of their cases and of \nthe adequacy of the settlement.” In re Sturm, 2012 WL 3589610, at *5 (internal citation omitted). Thus, \nClass Counsel have clearly satisfied the first inquiry under the 2018 amendments (whether counsel \nhave adequately represented the class) and their considered judgment that the Settlement meets the \nrequirements of Rule 23(e) is entitled to “great weight.” In re NASDAQ, 187 F.R.D. at 474; see also \nAramburu  v.  Healthcare  Financial  Services,  Inc.,  No.  02-CV-6535,  2009  WL  1086938,  at  *2 \n(E.D.N.Y.  Apr.  22,  2009)  (“[I]n  appraising  the  fairness  of  a  proposed  settlement,  the  view  of \nexperienced counsel favoring the settlement is entitled to a great weight”) (quotations omitted).   \n  The procedural fairness of the Settlement is also supported by the fact that it was the product \nof arms-length negotiations that involved long sessions over complex issues. The parties spent more \nthan six weeks in negotiations. During that period, they often corresponded several times a day to \ndiscuss every textual and practical nuance of the resulting agreement while continuing to prepare for a \npreliminary injunction hearing.  \n  Furthermore, the parties were fortunate to have this Court’s assistance. Negotiations proceeded \nunder the thoughtful guidance of Judge Farrish, who convened nine settlement conferences over the \n \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 33 of 52\ncourse of four weeks. (ECF Nos. 99, 102, 109, 112, 115, 119, 120, 121, 123). In total, the parties \nparticipated in more than forty hours of Court-supervised negotiation before a settlement was finally \nreached and in the face of a looming hearing on Petitioners’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction. \nTogether, these circumstances reflect a negotiating posture that was not only arms-length but often \ncontentious. Thus, the Settlement also satisfies the Rule 23(e)(2)(B) prong. See Ingles v. Toro, 438 F. \nSupp. 2d 203, 213 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (approving injunctive class settlement in prisoner lawsuit where \n“the litigation was hard-fought and the settlement negotiations . . . were extended and involved the \nCourt”); In re Austrian & German Bank Holocaust Litig., 80 F. Supp. 2d 164, 174 (S.D.N.Y. 2000), \naff’d sub nom. D’Amato v. Deutsche Bank, 236 F.3d 78 (2d Cir. 2001) (approving class settlement as \nthe  product  of  arms-length  negotiations,  where  “at  points  the  negotiations  were  extremely \ncontentious”); see also Wal–Mart, 396 F.3d at 117 (noting that district court held that “there could not \nbe any better evidence of procedural integrity than the aggressive litigation . . . and the impassioned \nsettlement negotiations that produced an agreement on the brink of trial”).   \n  The arms-length nature of negotiations, the extensive discovery conducted under the press of \nan upcoming preliminary injunction hearing, and the experience of Class Counsel each amply support \na finding that the negotiations that ultimately resulted in this Settlement were procedurally fair. See In \nre Sturm, 2012 WL 3589610, at *4.  \nII.  THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IS SUBSTANTIVELY FAIR,  \n   REASONABLE, AND ADEQUATE. \n \n  The last two prongs of the new Rule 23(e)(2)—whether: (C) the relief provided to the class is \nadequate; and (D) the proposal treats class members equitably relative to one another—are concerned \nwith whether the Settlement is substantively fair, reasonable, and adequate, and, in this Circuit, are \nevaluated with reference to the traditional Grinnell factors. In re Payment Card Interchange Fee, 330 \nF.R.D. at 29; Berni, 332 F.R.D. at 33.23  “For a settlement to be substantively fair, not every factor must \n \n23 Where, as here, a class action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, a reviewing court need only consider the first six \nGrinnell factors. See Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 185 F.R.D. 152, 162 (S.D.N.Y. 1999), aff'd sub nom. Joel A. v. Giuliani, 218 \n \n \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 34 of 52\nweigh in favor of settlement, rather, the court should consider the totality of these factors in light of the \nparticular circumstances.” Kemp-DeLisser v. Saint Francis Hosp. & Med. Ctr., 2016 WL 6542707, at \n*7 (D. Conn. Nov. 3, 2016) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).  \nA. The Proposed Settlement Provides Significant Benefits to the Class \n  As set forth in detail above, the Settlement builds on the benefits obtained in this litigation on \nbehalf of those imprisoned at FCI Danbury who are medically vulnerable as defined by the CDC. The \nBOP has committed that it will conduct its home confinement determinations as to all individuals \nidentified as medically vulnerable in this litigation pursuant to the standards and criteria set forth by \nthe Court in the TRO entered in this action.  \n  In addition to the guaranteed implementation of the criteria set forth in the TRO, the Settlement \nprovides four discrete benefits to the Class—each of which applies without regard to the current extent \nof COVID-19 in the facility and none of which would have been available absent this Settlement: (1) \na procedure for identification of new medically vulnerable Class members with oversight by Class \nCounsel; (2) expedited home confinement review pursuant to standards set forth in the TRO with \noversight by Class Counsel; (3) reconsideration of home confinement denials for some Class members; \nand (4) reconsideration in the event of certain changed circumstances.   \n  In addition, the Settlement leaves intact Class members’ right to pursue monetary relief for any \nconstitutional violations occasioned by the conditions of their confinement and permits pursuit of any \nclaims for injunctive relief arising after the effective date of the Settlement. Finally, although not \nenforceable as such, as part of the Settlement, Respondent also sent Class Counsel a letter dated July \n24, 2020 providing assurances and commitments to improve processes for testing and screening \nindividuals for COVID-19 symptoms at the facility and to improve healthcare delivery at FCI Danbury.  \n \n \nF.3d 132 (2d Cir. 2000), and, with respect to the fifth, the court evaluates the risks of establishing remedies instead of the \nrisks of establishing damages. Id. \n \n \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 35 of 52\n1.  Identification of New Class Members \n  First, the Settlement creates an entirely new procedure for the identification of all prisoners \ncurrently at or newly transferred into FCI Danbury who are medically vulnerable to COVID-19 which \napplies for the entire duration of the agreement—without regard to whether COVID-19 is prevalent (or \neven present) at the facility at the time such medically vulnerable individuals are identified. The \nSettlement assures that newly incarcerated individuals will be informed of the Settlement and of their \nopportunity to have medical records reviewed by Class Counsel and, upon a showing of a qualifying \nmedical condition, to receive the expedited home confinement review guaranteed to Class members \nunder the Settlement. (ECF No. 134-1, ¶¶ 4-5). Where there are disputes as to an individual’s eligibility \nfor Class membership, the Settlement provides a mechanism for third party review by a physician \ndetailed to the BOP from the United States Public Health Service—a significant derogation from the \nBOP’s otherwise exclusive discretion. (Id. ¶ 4(c)). The inclusion of prospective class members, and a \nguaranteed mechanism to review their medical records for eligibility for class membership with Class \nCounsel oversight is a unique benefit of the Settlement that would not otherwise be available to future \nFCI Danbury prisoners. \n2.  Expedited Home Confinement Review Pursuant to the TRO Standards \n  The Settlement sets forth a home confinement review process that applies to all members of the \nClass who are identified as medically vulnerable in the future and all Class members on List Two. The \nSettlement provides these individuals with the right to expedited home confinement review and requires \nsuch determinations to be undertaken in accordance with standards and criteria ordered by the Court in \nits  TRO,  in  effect  constraining  to  some  degree  the  BOP’s  discretion  with  respect  to  those \ndeterminations. Specifically, each individual is entitled to a home confinement review that, inter alia: \n(1) assign(s) substantial weight . . . to the inmate’s risk factors for COVID-19; (2) sets forth in a Review \nWorksheet the factors considered in reaching a home confinement determination; (3) does not treat any \nparticular consideration as an automatic disqualifier to home confinement; and (4) provides a written \n \n \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 36 of 52\nexplanation of any factors relied upon in a determination to deny home confinement despite the danger \nto the incarcerated individual posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. (See ECF No. 30, at 33-34). \nMoreover, the Settlement provides an additional procedural protection by requiring that a medical \nclinician must identify and list the individual’s COVID-19 risk factors for consideration in the home \nconfinement review. And, any individual denied home confinement after review by the Warden at \nDanbury is entitled to review by the BOP’s Home Confinement Committee (HCC) in Washington D.C. \n(ECF No. 134-1, ¶¶ 3, 6). \n  The Settlement, thus, both implements standards which circumscribe to some degree the BOP’s \ndiscretion to make home confinement determinations and creates a paper record that permits oversight \nof those determinations for factual and/or procedural errors by class counsel and, where appropriate, \nby the Court. BOP’s commitments under the Settlement to both tailor its exercise of discretion in \naccordance with the standards set forth in the TRO (which would otherwise lapse absent further \nlitigation) and to permit oversight over the process (which would be wholly unavailable absent \ncontinued litigation)—is a significant material benefit to the Settlement Class. \n3.  Re-Review and Error Correction \n  Because the Settlement requires preparation of the Review Worksheet and written explanation \nof the reasons for denial, with oversight by Class Counsel, the Settlement also affords Class members \nthe unique benefit of obtaining re-review where a home confinement decision is shown to rest on \nerroneous factual information or fails to apply the proper standards and, where appropriate, allows for \njudicial review of any such improper determinations.24 (Id. ¶¶ 12, 23).     \n \n  \n \n24 In this regard, Class Counsel identified 54 individuals from List One who were similarly situated to individuals who had \nbeen approved for home confinement and had significant and material errors in their previous review. The Settlement \nprovides for reconsideration by the HCC of these 54 individuals under the standards of the TRO and the terms of the \nSettlement. \n \n \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 37 of 52\n4.  Reconsideration based on Changed Circumstances \n  Finally, the Settlement specifically guarantees all future Class members, all Class members on \nList Two, and a significant number of Class members on List One who were or are in the future denied \nhome confinement by the HCC based on unsuitable release plans or pending warrants, charges, or \ndetainers the right to  reconsideration for home confinement by FCI Danbury if those issues are \nresolved and, if denied at the level of the institution, further entitles them to review by the HCC. (Id. ¶ \n14).25 These reviews—again, not specifically available in the absence of the Settlement —are governed \nby the standards of the TRO.  \n  Moreover,  the  Settlement  provides  these  benefits  while  leaving  intact  class  members’ \nindividual rights to pursue damages relief for Respondent’s responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and \nto pursue injunctive relief against Respondent to provide adequate social distancing and other changes \nto the congregate housing conditions at FCI Danbury, for events and circumstances arising after July \n27,  2020.  (Id.  ¶  16).  Class  members  also  have  the  ability  to  continue  pursuing  sentence \nreduction/compassionate release motions filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582. (Id.).  \n  Indeed, there is a concrete measure of the benefits of the terms of this Settlement. Since the \ncommencement of this litigation—and due to the continued implementation of the requirements of the \nTRO during the pendency of the settlement negotiations and as a result of the Settlement—145 \nDanbury prisoners identified as medically vulnerable to COVID-19 have been  released to home \nconfinement or halfway house placements.   \nB.  The Relief Provided to the Class Is Clearly Adequate in Light of the Costs, Risks and \nDelay of Trial and Appeal.   \n \n1.  The Complexity of Continued Litigation and the Benefit of Avoiding Delay \n \n25  The remaining List One Class Members who were reviewed for and denied home confinement prior to the Settlement \nmay seek reconsideration pursuant to the Settlement’s allowance for a request for re-review in the event of a material \nchange in circumstance or new information.  \n \n \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 38 of 52\n  This multi-party habeas corpus action is complex per se. See U. S. ex rel. Sero v. Preiser, 506 \nF.2d 1115, 1125 (2d Cir. 1974) (noting that district courts must craft procedures for multi-party habeas \nlitigation based on the nature of the specific claims raised); see also Ronald P. Sokol, Federal Habeas \nCorpus Practice, 20 Am. Jur. Trials 1 (2020) (“Habeas corpus proceedings in federal courts present \nmany complex problems”); In re Global Crossing Sec., 225 F.R.D. at 455 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (noting that \nfederal courts favor settlement in “especially complex and large-scale disputes”).  \n  Petitioners’ habeas petition sought preliminary relief in the form of admission to bail for many \nindividuals. See Martinez-Brooks v. Easter, No. 3:20-cv-00569 (MPS), 2020 WL 2405350, at *14-*15 \n(D. Conn. May 12, 2020) (this Court noting that bail may be an appropriate interim remedy at habeas \neven in a multi-party proceeding). Bail determinations in the context of a petition for habeas corpus \nrequire individualized assessments before a court can determine whether to grant bail to a particular \npetitioner. See Mapp v. Reno, 241 F.3d 221, 226 (2d Cir. 2001) (individuals must demonstrate that \n“extraordinary or exceptional circumstances exist which make the grant of bail necessary to make the \nhabeas remedy effective”).  \n  Rather than what could be a more protracted process, the Settlement establishes an expedited \nprocedure to have hundreds of medically vulnerable individuals reviewed for home confinement and \nreleased from FCI Danbury if appropriate, and the Settlement provides for Court involvement only \nwhen necessary. (ECF No. 134-1, ¶ 23). Given the requisite time and effort for individual bail \ndeterminations, the Settlement provides an immediately useful remedy relatively quickly for members \nof the Class. See Romero v. La Revise Assocs., L.L.C., 58 F.Supp.3d 411, 420-21 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) \n(noting that “the large number of class members [486] and the fact-intensive nature of their claims \nmean that litigation would likely be lengthy, complex, and expensive”).  \n  Under the rubric of this litigation, multiple members of the Class have already secured release \nto home confinement pursuant to pre-compliance with the terms of this Settlement. Were the parties to \ninstead proceed to an evidentiary hearing in this matter, the risks to medically vulnerable individuals \n \n \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 39 of 52\nat FCI Danbury could escalate, especially if another COVID-19 outbreak takes place. In contrast, upon \nCourt approval of this Settlement, the benefits of the Settlement can be immediately provided. This \nagreement will help move as many vulnerable individuals as possible out of FCI Danbury—which was \na principal goal of this litigation. The Settlement, moreover, incorporates this Court’s expectation that \nany such releases occur within 14 days after approval. (ECF No. 134-1, ¶ 11). See In re Veeco \nInstruments Inc. Securities Litigation, No. 05 MDL 01695(CM), 2007 WL 4115809, at *1, *6 \n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 7, 2007) (noting the virtues of “guaranteed immediate relief for the Class” as opposed \nto “delays associated with the continued litigation”); Guippone v. BH S&B Holdings LLC, No. 09 Civ. \n01029 (CM), 2016 WL 5811888, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 23, 2016) (prompt relief by settlement weighed \nfavorably under the first Grinnell factor).  \n2.  The Risks to Obtaining Relief \n \n  Petitioners’ underlying Eighth Amendment claims rest on a shifting factual and legal landscape. \nFacts are changing daily at FCI Danbury and around the country as the virus spreads—and while some \nstates are experiencing an increase in their infection rate, others are experiencing a temporary hiatus. \nMoreover, Respondent has made active use of home confinement as a result of this litigation and has \nalso updated policies and practices purportedly to improve access to healthcare at Danbury. (See ECF \nNo. 57-1, ¶ 21; Ex. B). It is unclear how this Court would view these adjustments if litigation proceeded. \nSee Martinez-Brooks, 2020 WL 2405350, at *29 (noting at the outset that the Warden’s implementation \nof safety protocols in response to COVID-19 and whether it violated Eighth Amendment standards \nwould be a detailed factual question for evidentiary hearing). Instead of pressing for judicial resolution \nin these uncharted waters, Class Counsel have secured a settlement that ensures Counsel will remain \nan integral part of the home confinement review process under the supervision of this Court—insulating \nprotections for medically vulnerable individuals from further alteration or appeal.  \n  Whether the BOP’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to the Attorney General’s \nmemorandum suffices as a matter of constitutional law is also hotly debated. There have been many \n \n \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 40 of 52\ncases brought across the country related to people in detention who— whether held as immigrants, pre-\ntrial detainees, or post-conviction—are exposed to a substantial risk of contracting COVID-19. The \nresultant judicial orders have varied over time and place. In some instances, judges have ordered release \non bail, called for facilities inspections, or mandated testing, sanitation, and other distancing protocols. \nSee, e.g., Mays v. Dart, No. 20-1792, 2020 WL 5361651, at *9 (7th Cir. Sept. 8, 2020); Criswell v. \nBoudreaux, No. 1:20-cv-01048-DAD-SAB, 2020 WL 5235675 (E.D. Cal. Sept. 2, 2020); Malam v. \nAdducci, No. 20-10829, 2020 WL 4496597, at *1 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 4, 2020); Wilson v. Ponce, No. CV \n20-4451-MWF (MRWx), 2020 WL 5118066 (C.D. Cal. July 14, 2020); Banks v. Booth, No. 20-849 \n(CKK), 2020 WL 3303006, at *12 (D.D.C. June 18, 2020); Seth v. McDonough, No. 8:20-cv-01028-\nPX, 2020 WL 2571168, at *14 (D. Md. May 21, 2020); Savino v. Souza, No. NO. 20-10617-WGY, \n2020 WL 1703844, at *9 (D. Mass. Apr. 8, 2020).  \n  In several other cases, appellate courts have remanded or reversed preliminary orders or district \ncourts have denied emergency relief altogether. See, e.g., Barnes v. Ahlman, No. 20A19, ___ S.Ct. ___, \n2020 WL 4499350 (Aug. 5, 2020); Swain v. Junior, 961 F.3d 1276, 1294 (11th Cir. 2020); Wilson v. \nWilliams, 961 F.3d 829, 845 (6th Cir. 2020); Valentine v. Collier, 956 F.3d 797, 806 (5th Cir. 2020); \nFernandez-Rodriguez v. Licon-Vitale, No. 20 Civ. 3315 (ER), 2020 WL 3618941, at *33 (S.D.N.Y. \nJuly 2, 2020); Chunn v. Edge, No. 20-cv-1590 (RPK) (RLM), 2020 WL 3055669, at *28 (E.D.N.Y \nJune 9, 2020). This legal uncertainty makes protracted litigation likely in the absence of settlement, as \nin many other cases litigants have sought and continue to seek appellate review.  \n  Moreover, in addition to questions of liability and remedy are issues of procedure. Many courts \nhave approved multi-party proceedings for COVID-19 detention cases. See, e.g., Wilson, 961 F.3d at \n838 (petitioners alleging danger from COVID-19 in confinement could seek class habeas relief “[t]o \nthe extent [they] argue the alleged unconstitutional conditions of their confinement can be remedied \nonly by release”); Valenzuela Arias v. Decker, No. 20 Civ. 2802, 2020 WL 2306565, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. \nMay 8, 2020); Ferrerya v. Decker, No. 20 Civ. 3170 (AT), 2020 WL 1989417, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. \n \n \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 41 of 52\n27, 2020) (“The extraordinary circumstance of the COVID-19 crisis warrants a multi-party habeas \npetition permitting expeditious resolution of the claims before the Court”). Yet, as this Court noted, the \nissue has not been definitively settled. See Martinez-Brooks, 2020 WL 2405350, at *30 (considering \n“on a provisional basis, whether multi-party treatment is likely appropriate as to this claim and the \nassociated relief” and identifying that “the scope of [] inquiry as to multi-party treatment need not \nextend beyond the scope of the claim addressed by this ruling”) (emphasis added).  \n  Here, as in many other cases, Class Counsel believes that this action was properly brought  as \na multi-party/class action proceeding. However, litigation about this case status is yet another reason \nto come to a settlement. See Chatelain, 805 F.Supp. at 214 (“Even if certified, the class would face the \nrisk of decertification”); In re Sumitomo Copper Litig., 189 F.R.D. 274, 284 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (the risk \nof the class being decertified, in which case the class members would recover nothing, favored approval \nof the proposed settlement); In re NASDAQ, 187 F.R.D. at 476-477 (risk of class being decertified at \ntrial or risk of class certification being reversed on appeal supported approval of settlement); In re \nRemeron Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., No. Civ. 03-0085 FSH, 2005 WL 3008808, at *8 (D.N.J. \nNov. 9, 2005) (noting that “the risks faced by Plaintiffs with regard to class certification weigh in favor \nof approving the Settlement”).26  \n  In short, this factual and legal landscape weighs in favor of approving the Settlement. See In re \nAustrian & German Bank Holocaust Litig., 80 F. Supp. 2d 164, 177 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (“the court need \nonly assess the risks of litigation against the certainty of recovery under the proposed settlement”); In \nre Michael Milken & Assocs. Sec. Litig., 150 F.R.D. 57, 65 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (identifying the risk of \nappeal as weighing in favor of settlement despite potentially favorable treatment at the district court \nlevel); see also Carson v. American Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 88 (1981) (noting that the court need \nnot “decide the merits of the case or resolve unsettled legal questions” to approve settlement).   \n \n26 Approval of the Settlement also obviates the need for Class Counsel to continually identify new class representatives \nwhen old class representatives are released to home confinement—which has already presented problems for the parties \nduring the course of this litigation. See supra note 2.  \n \n \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 42 of 52\nC. The Settlement Treats Class Members Equitably Relative to Each Other \n  Rule 23(e)(2)(D) requires the Court to assess whether the Settlement “treats class members \nequitably relative to each other.” As set forth in the Advisory Note to the 2018 amendments, “[m]atters \nof concern could include whether the apportionment of relief among class members takes appropriate \naccount of differences among their claims. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e), 2018 Advisory Committee Notes. \nThus, “equitable” treatment does not require identical treatment. See, e.g., Radcliffe v. Hernandez, 794 \nFed. Appx. 605, 607 (9th Cir. 2019) (“Rule 23’s flexible standard allows for the unequal distribution \nof settlement funds so long as the distribution formula takes account of legitimate considerations and \nthe settlement remains ‘fair, reasonable, and adequate’”); In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and \nMerchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, No. 05-MD-1720 (MKB)(JO), 2019 WL 6875422019 at * 27 \n(E.D.N.Y. Dec. 16, 2019) (approving settlement as “equitable” notwithstanding that merchants who \nwere in the class for only a portion of the class period would have to release claims for the full class \nperiod without much compensation, while others might receive proportionally more compensation with \nthe same release).  \n  The Settlement in this case creates a process for home confinement review. The question posed \nby Rule 23(e)(2)(D) is whether that process applies equitably to all members of the class. Since every \nmember of the Class possesses unique circumstances relevant to a home confinement assessment, the \nresults of that process will necessarily be different among the members of the Class. The relevant \nquestion is, thus, not whether the process results in the same relief for every member of the Class but \nwhether all Class members had or have the same opportunity to avail themselves of the home \nconfinement process set forth in the settlement. The Settlement is still fair and treats Class members \nequitably notwithstanding that the process results in different determinations by the Respondent based \non legally permissible considerations.   \n  The home confinement review provided in the Settlement affords a review that, inter alia: (1) \nassign(s) substantial weight . . . to the inmate’s risk factors for COVID-19; (2) sets forth in a Review \n \n \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 43 of 52\nWorksheet the factors considered in reaching a home confinement determination; (3) does not treat any \nparticular consideration as an automatic disqualifier to home confinement; and (4) provides a written \nexplanation of any factors relied upon in a determination to deny home confinement despite the danger \nto the incarcerated individual posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The only distinction in treatment \namong the Class members is that certain List One members who received their home confinement \nreview pursuant to the standards set forth in the Court’s TRO, but before those terms of the TRO were \nincorporated into the Settlement, see n.19, supra, are not entitled to automatic reconsideration whereas \nList  One  members  who  were  identified  in  Exhibit  B  to  the  Settlement  are  entitled  to  such \nreconsideration. The individuals on Exhibit B who received such reconsideration had significant and \nmaterial errors in their previous review and were, on the face of the worksheets, similarly situated to \nindividuals who had been granted home confinement—a consideration on which the Court had \nspecifically relied in issuing its own Orders requiring HCC review during earlier proceedings in this \nmatter. (See, e.g., ECF No. 68). Moreover, the List One members excluded from the benefits of \nautomatic reconsideration may nevertheless seek reconsideration along with other Class members \npursuant to the Settlement’s allowance for a request for re-review in the event of a material change in \ncircumstance or new information. Thus, to the extent that any difference between automatic  re-review \nand “material change of circumstance” re-review may inform the ultimate outcome of such re-review, \nthe differential treatment with respect to this process among members of the Class was both principled \nand equitable—and premised on factors which both the BOP and the Court had previously treated as \nlegally relevant. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(D) (settlements must treat “class members equitably \nrelative to each other”); William H. Rubenstein, 5 Newberg on Class Actions § 13.44 (5th ed. June \n2020 Update) (noting that a settlement is still equitable where “class members should be treated \ndifferently because they are situated differently”); see also Clark v. Duke University, 2019 WL \n2588029, at *5–6 (M.D. N.C. 2019) (noting that “different circumstances” justified different treatment \nof class members and that settlement was both fair and equitable).  \n \n \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 44 of 52\nD. The Objections Raise Understandable Concerns but Do Not Warrant Rejection of the \nSettlement \n \n  Counsel have filed this lawsuit on behalf of incarcerated people at FCI Danbury and have \nlearned from many of them that they approve of this Settlement, while others have registered to Counsel \nand to this Court their concerns and opposition. Below, Counsel explain the kinds of objections \nreceived and our views on how to weigh them. Moreover, because it remains unclear who may become \na member of the Class in the future, Counsel urge the Court to consider all objections, whether the \nindividual has been recognized already as a member of the Class or not. Although non-class members \nlack standing to object to the Settlement under Rule 23, see Gould v. Alleco, Inc., 883 F.2d 281, 284 \n(4th Cir. 1989), at this juncture it is not possible to know whether any individual imprisoned at FCI \nDanbury who is not already identified as a Class member nevertheless has standing to object—as \nindividuals may be identified as Class members in the course of execution of the Settlement. (ECF No. \n134-1 ¶¶ 4-5) (provisions for identifying medically vulnerable). Class Counsel also urge the Court to \nconsider objections received by the Court after the September 4, 2020 deadline. As noted in Counsel’s \nSeptember 4 filing (ECF No. 173), multiple objectors mailed objections to the Court in advance of that \ndeadline but the objections were not yet docketed by September 4. Prisoners at FCI Danbury are unable \nto control when the mail leaves the facility and there are often delays. Class Counsel have docketed all \nresponses received by Counsel to date that were not already docketed. (ECF No. 173-1).  \n  Class Counsel have reviewed every filing and have identified four major objection categories, \nwhich we summarize for the Court below. As explained, the substance of the objections and other \ncomments  by  Class  (and  non-Class)  members  weighs  in  favor  of  this  Court’s  approval  of  the \nSettlement. \n1.  Objections to Conditions of Confinement During the COVID-19 Pandemic and  \n  Absence of Enforceable Conditions-Related Terms in the Agreement.  \n \n  The vast majority of the objections detail class members’ difficult and traumatic experiences in \nprison during the COVID-19 pandemic. The comments reflect the enormous anxiety experienced by \n \n \n34 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 45 of 52\npeople detained in congregate housing, where they are unable to control their surroundings and have \ndifficulty accessing health care. Many wrote about the conditions of their confinement at FCI Danbury \nand about Respondent’s inability to maintain social distancing, properly sanitize or ventilate the \nfacility, or ensure adequate access to healthcare, including prompt and non-punitive care for those with \nCOVID-19 and related exposure. (See, e.g, ECF Nos. 140, 143, 145, 147, 151, 152, 156, 162, 163, 164, \n166, 168, 169, 171, 172, 173, 177, 185, 187, 188, 191, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 202, 206, 209, 212, \n214, 216). Many people—including several who expressed support for the Settlement insofar as it \nprovides for home confinement review for medically vulnerable individuals—objected to the fact that \nthe Settlement does not address these conditions-related issues. (See, e.g, ECF Nos. 161, 173, 179, 180, \n182, 190, 192, 194).  \n  These objectors express understandable frustration that the Settlement does not encompass an \nagreement concerning the conditions at FCI Danbury. As reflected in the Petition, Class Counsel \nviewed the conditions at FCI Danbury as deeply troubling, but also recognized limitations in the law \naffecting whether petitioners could prevail on constitutional challenges to such conditions. While Class \nCounsel were unable to reach an enforceable agreement on conditions of confinement, the Settlement \npreserves the right of all Class members (and non-Class members) incarcerated at FCI Danbury to \npursue injunctive relief against Respondent to challenge these conditions again in the future. (ECF No. \n134-1, ¶ 16). With respect to past-looking claims, the Settlement does prevent members of the Class \nfrom seeking injunctive relief for any acts or omissions relating to the BOP’s response to the COVID-\n19 pandemic prior to July 27, 2020. (ECF No. 134-1, ¶ 16). But this limited preclusion of retrospective \nactions for injunctive relief will be of no significance to any member of the Class seeking to litigate \npresent conditions in the prison. That litigation could be brought today. Cf. W. v. City of New York, \n2016 WL 4367969, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 12, 2016) (finding injunctive consent decree unfair and \nunreasonable based, in part, on “the extraordinary length of time for which the parties propose to bar \nfurther systemic litigation”). Furthermore, the Settlement does not affect the right of non-Class \n \n \n35 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 46 of 52\nmembers to challenge the conditions in the facility at any time.  \n  In addition, Class Counsel secured a letter of assurance regarding necessary improvements the \nBOP has committed to undertaking at Danbury (ECF No. 138-1).27 Class Counsel’s negotiations on \nthe provisions in this letter were informed by communications with hundreds of persons incarcerated \nat FCI Danbury about their experiences and issues; Class Counsel endeavored to reflect and resolve as \nmany of their concerns as possible in the letter. To the extent Respondent fails to live up to these \nassurances and conditions at FCI Danbury fall below constitutional requirements, members of the Class \ncan re-institute their challenge against Respondent.  \n  Finally, the Class remains entitled to bring their own lawsuits for money damages based on the \nsame circumstances raised in this lawsuit or any other COVID-19-related circumstances past or present. \nSee Stinson v. City of New York, 256 F. Supp. 3d 283, 292–93 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (approving a settlement \nwhere  it  did  not  release  any  class  members’  individual  damage  claims  arising  from  the  same \nallegations). The Settlement therefore permits, as it should, vindication of the interests identified by \nmany of these objectors while securing an expedited home confinement review process that will help \nmedically vulnerable individuals leave prison. See Lucky Brand Dungarees, Inc. v. Marcel Fashions \nGroup, Inc., 140 S.Ct. 1589, 1596 (2020) (noting that “preclusion generally does not bar claims that \nare predicated on events that postdate the filing of the initial complaint”) (internal quotations and \ncitations omitted).  \n2.  Objections to the Settlement for Not Reaching Non-Class Members. \n \nAt least two objections express concern that the Settlement does not cover everyone at FCI \nDanbury. One objection prepared on behalf of sixty-four individuals opposes the Settlement because it \n \n27 As discussed elsewhere, the benefits of securing immediate relief for members of the Class—many of whom will be \nreleased pursuant to the procedure set forth in the Settlement—far outweighed the lengthy delay and significant risks of \nlitigation to secure a remedy for prison conditions and added safety measures at FCI Danbury that could not be secured \nduring settlement negotiations. See Martinez-Brooks, 2020 WL 2405350, at *29 (noting that the Warden’s implementation \nof safety protocols in response to COVID-19 and whether it violated Eighth Amendment standards would be a detailed \nfactual question for evidentiary hearing). The constantly changing conditions on the ground at the prison with respect to the \nCOVID response added to the uncertainty of litigation. This balance reached by the Settlement is particularly sensible \nbecause conditions can be the subject of future litigation.  \n \n \n36 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 47 of 52\ndoes not provide relief for individuals at FCI Danbury who are not medically vulnerable to COVID-19 \n(ECF No. 147), and another proposes that the Settlement should extend to those who have already \ntested positive for COVID-19 and to those without medical conditions. (ECF No. 143).28  \nAgain, Class Counsel understand the frustration that some at FCI Danbury will feel from not \nbeing included in the Class or Settlement. Yet, the Settlement does not alter the legal rights of \nindividuals who are not part of the settlement class. These individuals retain their right to pursue all \ncauses of action against Respondent without restriction. (See ECF No. 134-1, ¶ 16 (noting that \nvoluntary dismissal of claims is without prejudice as to all individuals not part of the “Medically \nVulnerable Class”)); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(1)(A) (court approval for voluntary dismissal of a class \naction complaint only required for a certified class). In any case, those individuals have been placed in \nthe position they were in prior to the filing of this instant lawsuit, and therefore their concerns—that \nthey do not benefit from the Settlement—while understandable, do not implicate Rule 23(e) concerns.  \nFinally, to the extent that home confinement releases de-densify the institution, the Settlement \nmay make it easier for everyone at Danbury to practice social distancing—Counsel acknowledges that \nto achieve that benefit, however, release rates would have to increase significantly; moreover, transfers \ninto the facility, which, according to several objections, have increased in recent weeks (e.g., ECF Nos. \n147, 158, 177, 199), would need to be slowed or stopped.  \n3.  Objections Discussing Individual Cases for Home Confinement Release.   \nMany objectors have already been reviewed for home confinement and denied release—they \nchallenge the underlying substantive determination, urging the Court to intervene. (See, e.g., ECF Nos. \n188, 190, 202). A number of these objectors described their health conditions and care by Respondent \nand argued that these should have weighed in favor of their being released to home confinement (See, \ne.g., ECF Nos. 158, 173, 195, 212). Others, citing similar health and care concerns, assert that they \n \n28 Notably, the Settlement covers individuals with qualifying medical conditions who have already tested positive for \nCOVID-19 and prohibits BOP from using prior infection as a reason for denying them home confinement.  (ECF No. 134-\n1, ¶ 8). \n \n \n37 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 48 of 52\nshould have been already identified as medically vulnerable.  (See, e.g., ECF Nos. 162, 170, 183, 196, \n204). Those challenging the home confinement reviews also include several people who seek to ensure \nthat people convicted of sex or violent crimes are not precluded from home confinement relief. (ECF \nNos. 143, 144, 156, 173, 181).   \nClass Counsel acknowledge the seriousness of these objections that echo their hundreds of \nconversations with Class members over the course of the litigation. However, the issue before the Court \nis not a particular individual’s treatment, but whether the relief obtained by the Settlement—here, a \nprocess for home confinement review—is fair, adequate, and reasonable. See Austin v. Pa. Dep’t of \nCorr., 876 F. Supp. 1437, 1459 n.12 (E.D. Pa. 1995) (in a case regarding medical care, “an individual \ninmate’s objections regarding his own care are not directly relevant to the Court’s inquiry into the \nfairness of the Settlement Agreement”). Here, the Settlement provides as many Class members as \npossible the ability to challenge a home confinement review to the extent that it does not comply with \nthe TRO, including, inter alia, if it: (1) fails to assign adequate weight to an individual’s COVID-19 \nrisk factors; (2) relies on erroneous or outdated information; or (3) uses automatic disqualifiers \nprohibited by the TRO. (ECF No. 134-1, ¶¶ 12, 14, 23). The Settlement will therefore allay the concerns \nthat some objectors have with Respondent’s home confinement reviews. Decoteau v. Raemisch, No. \n13–cv–3399–WJM–KMT, 2016 WL 8416757, at *7 (D. Colo. July 6, 2016) (approving settlement for \ninjunctive relief in prison suit where “Settlement Agreement contains a dispute resolution mechanism \nthat Class Counsel can invoke if serious complaints continue to arise regarding these matters”).  \nFor those home confinement reviews that resulted in denials but for which there is no error, the \nSettlement is still fair as the relief ordered by the Court was procedural in nature rather than substantive \nrelease. Some objections also requested sentencing reduction or compassionate release relief beyond \nthe scope of this litigation. (See, e.g., ECF No. 169). However, the Settlement explicitly carves out a \nright for members of the Class to pursue this relief on an individualized basis. (ECF No. 134-1, ¶ 16).    \n \n \n \n38 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 49 of 52\n4.  Objections to the Home Confinement Review Process \nA small minority of the objectors raise concerns that are specific to the Settlement and its \nterms—that is, the Settlement applies to them, and they object to aspects of the home confinement \nreview process set out in the agreement.  \nSome of these objectors are individuals on List One who note factual errors in their initial \nreview that they believe should entitle them to reconsideration along with the others identified in \nExhibit B to the Settlement (ECF Nos. 173, 174, 207, 212),29 including that they or others suffer from \nadditional medical conditions that, at the time of HCC review, the CDC did not recognize as rendering \nthem especially vulnerable to COVID-19, but that it has since recognized (See, e.g., ECF No. 156).30 \nIt is true that although the individuals on List One have already been given a home confinement review \npursuant to the terms of this Court’s TRO (see ECF No. 57-1), only the subset set forth in Exhibit B \nare receiving automatic reconsideration before the HCC. Respondent agreed in the Settlement to have \nthe HCC reconsider these individuals, and any errors in these HCC reviews will be subject to the \nSettlement’s enforcement mechanism. Respondent did not agree to reconsideration of the remainder of \nList One individuals, however these individuals may seek re-review pursuant to the Settlement’s \nallowance for a request for re-review in the event of a material change in circumstance or new \ninformation.31      \nTwo of the objections expressed concern about delays in the home confinement review process \nfor people not identified as medically vulnerable under the Settlement—that is, that the institution’s \n \n29 Note that some objectors who raise issues of error in the initial review are listed in Exhibit B and entitled to re-review \nunder the Settlement in the event of material error or mistake of fact in the initial review.  (ECF Nos. 185, 186, 202).    \n30 Several objectors not on List One also cite this latter concern in their objections and request that the Settlement provide \nfor re-review anytime the relevant CDC Guidance changes. (E.g., ECF Nos. 179, 198, 216).   \n31 Counsel are cognizant of the objections raised by Mr. Lenchick (ECF Nos. 173 and 174) and believe those objections \nraise legitimate concerns arising out of the incomplete implementation of the Court’s May 29, 2020 Order (ECF No. 70) \nwhile the parties were negotiating the present Settlement. Counsel are prepared to discuss Mr. Lenchick’s individual \ncircumstances at the fairness hearing. Objectors Falls (ECF No. 207) and Gioieli (ECF No. 212) assert that their reviews \nwere based on mistaken information about existing detainers or the circumstances of conviction which, Counsel believe, \nwould permit them to correct their Central File and request re-review based on a material change in circumstance or new \ninformation. \n \n \n39 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 50 of 52\nusual home confinement review process has slowed significantly or stalled. (ECF Nos. 167, 171). \nCounsel note that these reviews should be continuing apace notwithstanding the Settlement.   \nFinally, many objectors wrote that they and others are not able to assess the validity of the home \nconfinement review process if they do not have access to the worksheets and materials underlying those \ndecisions, as well as the written decision itself. (ECF Nos. 156, 173, 179, 182, 184, 191, 216). For \nClass members denied home confinement under the Settlement, Class Counsel will be providing \nindividuals  with  the  information  on  which  their  home  confinement  decisions  were  based  and \nendeavoring to access materials underlying the decisions, where possible. Class Counsel understands \nthat not all List One individuals have yet had access to this information and underlying materials.32 \nWe note that the views of Class members in a settlement are to be taken into account but are \nnot dispositive. See, e.g., Grant v. Bethlehem Steep Corp., 823 F.2d 20, 23 (2d Cir. 1987) (district \ncourts have a fiduciary obligation to the “silent majority” of class members and weighing this factor in \nfavor of settlement even where a large minority of class members voice objection); Collins v. Olin \nCorp., No. 3:03–cv–945 (CFD), 2010 WL 1677764, at *4 (D. Conn. April 21, 2010) (citing County of \nSuffolk v. Long Island Lighting Co., 907 F.2d 1295, 1325 (2d Cir. 1990)). While the views of the \nobjectors to the settlement are understandable and reflective of real frustrations with the conditions at \nthe prison and with the home confinement review process, the significant provisions of the settlement \nwill continue to benefit the Class and help send many medically vulnerable prisoners home safely as \nquickly as possible.  This Settlement is plainly fair, reasonable, and adequate as required by Rule 23. \nCONCLUSION  \n \n  For the reasons set forth above, Counsel requests that this Court grant final approval of the \nSettlement and authorize Class Counsel to begin enforcing its terms on behalf of the Class. \n   \n \n \n32 Several people objected in part because the Settlement does not provide for monetary compensation. (See, e.g., ECF Nos. \n143, 190, 194.). Again, however, the Settlement does not preclude any individual claim for monetary relief.  Moreover, this \nmulti-party habeas petition was never an action for damages.    \n \n \n40 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 218   Filed 09/11/20   Page 51 of 52\n  September 11, 2020  \n \n/s/  David S.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \nPetitioners  Dianthe Martinez-Brooks, Rejeanne  Collier, Jackie Madore, and  Kenneth \nCassidy (collectively, “Petitioners”), and a putative class of potentially all inmates at the Federal \nCorrectional Institution at Danbury in Danbury, Connecticut (“FCI Danbury”), request, pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 2241, that this Court short-circuit the entire criminal justice process and direct the \nmanagement of a prison by: (1) ordering, via a civil action, their immediate and unwarranted \nrelease from prison or placement in home confinement due to concerns related to the novel \ncoronavirus (“COVID-19”); (2) declaring that FCI Danbury has committed an Eighth Amendment \nviolation with respect to every single inmate at FCI Danbury; (3) implementing specific “safety” \nmeasures at FCI Danbury; and (4) appointing a Special Master “to make recommendations to the \nCourt regarding the number of incarcerated people that FCI Danbury can house consistent with \nCDC Guidance on best social distancing and hygiene practices to prevent the spread of COVID-\n19,” which essentially would result in a determination as to which convicted criminals (who have \nalready been sentenced) may be released from prison—thereby divesting the judges of this Court \nand other courts of the authority to control their own criminal dockets.  Respondents respectfully \nsubmit this memorandum of law in support of their motion to dismiss this Petition for Writ of \nHabeas Corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (Docket No. 1) and Petitioners’ Motion for a \nTemporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction1 (Docket Nos. 13 and 14) pursuant to  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), 12(b)(6), or, alternatively, for summary judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. \n                                                \n1 Petitioners’ relief requested in their Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary \nInjunction is merely a subset of the relief requested in their Petition.  To obtain either a TRO or a PI, \nPetitioners would need to show either a likelihood of success on the merits or at least serious questions \ngoing to the merits.  Charette v. Town of Oyster Bay, 159 F.3d 749, 754 (2d Cir. 1998).  As set forth herein, \nPetitioners’ claims should be dismissed outright.  Thus, Petitioners cannot meet the standards for a TRO or \nPI and the Court should deny Petitioners’ motion for such relief for the same reasons it should dismiss their \nPetition. \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 13 of 88\nP. 56.   As demonstrated below, Petitioners’ claims are subject to dismissal.  \nAs a threshold matter, this Court does not have jurisdiction over Petitioners’ claims.  \nAlthough  the  Second  Circuit  has  construed  28  U.S.C.  §  2241  as  permitting  challenges  to \nunconstitutional  conditions  of  confinement,  the  relief  Petitioners  seek  here—essentially  the \nmodification or reduction of their criminal sentences, as well as the criminal sentences of the entire \npopulation of inmates at FCI Danbury (which houses only sentenced offenders), or a subset \nthereof—has not been  recognized as an  available remedy to habeas petitioners challenging \nconditions of confinement in the Second Circuit.  Additionally, Petitioners have not alleged that \nthey have properly exhausted administrative remedies as required by 28 U.S.C. § 2241.      \n  The implications of such an extraordinary order would be staggering; under Petitioners’ \ntheory of appropriate habeas relief, a judge in a federal civil action would be permitted to commute \nthe sentences of hundreds of post-conviction inmates.  Petitioners completely overlook 18 U.S.C. \n§ 3626, which is the component of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”) that establishes \nthat courts are strictly limited in ordering the release of inmates “in any civil action in Federal \ncourt with respect to prison conditions” and that a single district judge is precluded from doing so.  \nSee id. § 3626(a)(3)(B). \nNot only does the Petition suffer from these multiple legal defects that warrant dismissal, \nbut it also presents a distorted picture of the efforts made at FCI Danbury to protect inmates from \nthe threat to health and safety posed by COVID-19.  Petitioners make bold accusations based on \nhearsay from convicted offenders who sought, or are seeking, release from confinement, and from \npurported experts who have never been to FCI Danbury, or at least not recently.  To the contrary, \nas set out below, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) has made significant efforts to respond to \nthis novel infectious disease which, until approximately four months ago, most people had never \n2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 14 of 88\nheard of and which expanded globally at an alarming and unprecedented rate.  These efforts belie \nany suggestion that the BOP, including FCI Danbury, is failing to meaningfully address the risks \nposed by COVID-19 or take seriously the threat the pandemic poses to current inmates.  Instead, \nthese efforts show that the BOP and FCI Danbury have taken the threat very seriously and have \nmitigated the spread of COVID-19.  Petitioners cannot establish any violation of their Eighth \nAmendment rights arising out of current conditions at FCI Danbury.   \nLastly, this Court should strike the Petition’s class action allegations.  Petitioners’ request \nfor a sweeping and indiscriminate order certifying a class of roughly 984 inmates—presumably \nevery  inmate  at  FCI  Danbury—should  be  rejected.    Petitioners’  request  is  fundamentally \nincompatible  with  class-wide  relief,  as  the  putative  class  is  not  ascertainable  and  has  no \ncommonality or typicality.  Indeed, the putative class would feature a hodgepodge of inmates, each \nof whom has his or her unique set of circumstances (including projected release dates, disciplinary \nhistories, medical histories, bases for judicially imposed criminal sentences, and bases for judicial \nfindings of dangerousness to the community and risk of flight) that would need to be considered \nby  the  judge  presiding  over  their  criminal  proceeding,  including  any  claim  for  bail  or \ncompassionate release.  Accordingly, the Court should dismiss the Petition in its entirety. \nII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA.  The Covid-19 Pandemic and the BOP’s Response  \nActivated in 1940, FCI Danbury is a male low security level correctional institution (“Main \nComplex”) with an adjacent female minimum security level federal prison camp (“Camp”) and a \nfemale federal satellite low security level facility (FSL).  Declaration of Diane Easter, Warden of \nFederal Correctional Institution at Danbury (“Decl.”) ¶ 3, attached hereto as Exhibit A.  FCI \nDanbury is an institution that houses only sentenced offenders.  Id. at ¶ 3. \n The Main Complex is a low security facility with a double-fenced perimeter, mostly \n3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 15 of 88\ndormitory or cubicle housing, and strong work and program components. Id. at ¶ 5.  The staff-to-\ninmate ratio at the Main Complex is higher than in the minimum security facilities.  Id.  As of the \ndate of the attached declaration, the Main Complex houses 719 male offenders.  Id.  The rated \ncapacity of the Main Complex is 554.  Id.  The rated capacity is not a figure which represents the \nmaximum number of inmates that can be designated to the respective sections FCI Danbury.  Id.  \nThe Camp is a minimum security institution which has dormitory housing, a relatively low \nstaff-to-inmate ratio, and no perimeter fencing.  Id. at ¶ 6.  As of the date of the attached \ndeclaration, the Camp houses 134 female offenders.  Id.   The rated capacity of the Camp is 146.  \nId. \nThe FSL is a low security facility with a single-fenced perimeter, cubicle housing, and \nstrong work and program components.  Id. at ¶ 7.  As of the date of the attached declaration, FSL \nhouses 131 female offenders.  Id.  The rated capacity of FSL is 198.  Id. \nThe main complex, the Camp, and the FSL are separate facilities, and, and under the current \nlockdown, the inmate populations do not interact.  Id. at ¶ 5.  There are currently 264 staff \nemployed at the institution.  Id. at ¶ 4.    \nIn January 2020, the BOP became aware of the first identified COVID-19 cases in the \nUnited States and took steps to prevent its introduction and spread in BOP institutions, including \nFCI Danbury.  Id. at ¶ 9.   To date, the BOP’s response to COVID-19 has occurred over six distinct \n“phases.”  Id. at ¶ 10.   \nIn January 2020, the BOP began Phase One of its Action Plan for COVID-19.  Id. at ¶ 11.  \nPhase One activities included, among other things, seeking guidance from the BOP’s Health \nServices Division and other stakeholders regarding the COVID-19 disease and its symptoms, \nwhere in the United States infections occurred, and the best practices to mitigate its transmission.  \n4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 16 of 88\nId.  In addition, an agency task force was established to begin strategic planning for COVID-19 \nBureau-wide.  Id.  From January 2020 through the present, the Bureau has been coordinating its \nCOVID-19 efforts with subject matter experts both internal and external to the agency, including \nimplementing guidance and directives from the World Health Organization (“WHO”), the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), the Office of Personnel Management (“OPM”), the \nDepartment of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Office of the Vice President.  Id. \nOn March 13, 2020, the BOP implemented Phase Two of its Action Plan during which, for \nan initial period of 30 days, in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19 into or through FCI \nDanbury, the facility suspended, with certain limited exceptions: social visits; legal visits; inmate \nfacility transfers; official staff travel; staff training; contractor access; volunteer visits; and tours.  \nId. at ¶ 12.  During Phase Two, inmates were subjected to new screening requirements and newly \narriving BOP inmates were screened for COVID-19 symptoms and “exposure risk factors,” \nincluding, for example, if the inmate had traveled from or through any CDC-determined, high-risk \nCOVID-19 locations, or had had close contact with anyone testing positive for COVID-19.  Id. at \n¶ 13.  Asymptomatic inmates with exposure risk factors were quarantined, and symptomatic \ninmates with exposure risk factors were isolated and evaluated for possible COVID-19 testing by \nlocal BOP medical providers.  Id.    On March 25, 2020, FCI Danbury implemented advanced \nenhanced screening measures for staff and contractors.  Id. at ¶ 14.  These enhanced screening \nprocedures required all staff and contractors to self-report any symptoms consistent with COVID-\n19, as well as any known or suspected COVID-19 exposure, and to have their temperature taken \nupon entry into any BOP facility.  Id.    \nDuring Phase Two, the BOP implemented national “modified operations” in order to \nmaximize social distancing within Bureau facilities.  Id. at ¶ 15.  These modifications included \n5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 17 of 88\nstaggering meal and recreation times to limit congregate gatherings.  Id.  The BOP also established \na set of quarantine and isolation procedures for known or potential cases of COVID-19.  Id.     \nOn March 18, 2020, the BOP implemented Phase Three of the COVID-19 Action Plan to \nmaximize telework.  Id. at ¶ 16.  Additionally, as part of this phase, and in accordance with the \nPandemic  Influenza  contingency  plan,  all  cleaning,  sanitation,  and  medical  supplies  were \ninventoried.  Id.  at ¶ 17.   \nOn March 26, 2020, the BOP implemented Phase Four of the COVID-19 Action Plan and \nrevised its preventative measures for all institutions; the agency updated its quarantine and \nisolation procedures to require all newly admitted inmates to be assessed using a screening tool \nand temperature check.  Id. at ¶ 18.  Thus, all new arrivals to FCI Danbury—even those who were \nasymptomatic—were placed in quarantine for a minimum of 14 days or until cleared by medical \nstaff.  Id.  Symptomatic inmates were placed in isolation until they tested negative for COVID-19, \nor were cleared by medical staff as meeting CDC criteria for release from isolation.  Id.  \nFCI Danbury implemented Phase Five of the COVID-19 Action Plan on April 1, 2020.  Id. \nat ¶ 19  Starting on that day, and for 14-days immediately thereafter: (i) all inmates were confined \nto their living quarters for the majority of the day; (ii) meals, commissary items, laundry, recreation \nmaterials, education materials, medical services and psychology services were delivered directly \nto inmates’ housing units; and (iii) inmates were released from their cells in small groups to engage \nin activities such as showers, exercise, phone calls, and email access.  Id. at ¶¶ 19-20.  During these \ntime periods, inmates were directed to maintain appropriate physical distancing.   Id. at ¶ 20. \nOn April 13, 2020, the BOP ordered the implementation of Phase Six of its COVID-19 \nAction Plan.  Id. at ¶ 21.  In implementing Phase Six, FCI Danbury extended the measures enacted \nin the nationwide actions in Phase Five, which includes continuing to perform rigorous medical \n6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 18 of 88\nscreening, limiting inmate gathering, daily rounds, limiting external movement, and fit testing, \nuntil May 18, 2020.  Id.  \nFCI Danbury has taken a number of additional measures in response to the COVID-19 \npandemic to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 into its facility.   \nB.  Steps Being Taken at FCI Danbury to Prevent COVID-19 \nFCI Danbury has implemented the BOP’s national action plan, in compliance with the \nBOP’s national directives, and has also taken numerous other measures to fight the introduction \nand spread of COVID-19 within its facilities including providing inmate and staff education; \nconducting  inmate  and  staff  screening;  putting  into  place  testing,  quarantine,  and  isolation \nprocedures in accordance with the BOP policy and CDC guidelines; ordering enhanced cleaning \nand medical supplies; and taking a number of other preventative measures.  Id. at ¶ 22.   \nFrom the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, FCI Danbury officials have provided updates \nto inmates and staff regarding the virus and the BOP’s response, and have educated inmates and \nstaff regarding measures that they should take to stay healthy.  Id. at ¶¶ 20, 23-24, 51, 52.  The \nmeasures that FCI Danbury has taken to insure the health and safety of its staff and inmates \nincludes, but is not limited to, the following:    \n1.  Isolation and Quarantine procedures \n \nThe implementation of the BOP’s COVID-19 Action Plans at FCI Danbury can best be \ndescribed as a “slowing down” of institutional operations, designed to limit the size of groups \ninmates can form and also the ability of these smaller groups to interact with each other at FCI \nDanbury.  Id. at ¶ 23.  This minimizes the opportunity for inmates to come into contact with \ninfected persons, and if they do, minimizes the possibility that any infection will spread beyond \nthe smaller group.  Id. \n \n7 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 19 of 88\n  In general, smaller inmate groups were formed at FCI Danbury by dividing inmates by \nhousing unit, and if applicable floor, so they can “shelter in place” with the fewest number of \nfellow inmates.  Id. at ¶ 24.  In order to reduce idle time and provide programs and activities, these \ngroups are rotated through the recreation facility by themselves, and disinfection of the recreation \nfacility is performed before the next group is rotated through it.  Id.  Programs are delivered on the \nunits, including Education, Psychology, and Religious Services (especially in consideration of the \nRamadan observance).  Id.  All meals are delivered to the units, with inmates receiving at least one \nhot meal per day.  Id.  Meal delivery to the units is performed by staff (instead of inmate food \nservice workers) in order to maintain the integrity of the inmate group quarantine.  Id.  When \ninmates need to report to Health Services for activities that cannot be performed on the unit \n(medication administration, etc.), inmates only report to the clinic with other inmates from their \ngroup.  Id.  Once at the clinic they move throughout the space in accordance with markings on the \nfloor to direct one-way travel, and wait in areas designed to facilitate social distancing.  Id. \n  In addition, separate housing spaces have been established for “Isolation” (for inmates \ndemonstrating symptoms) and “Quarantine” (asymptomatic) inmates.  Id. at ¶ 25.  These areas are \ndistinct from the aforementioned housing unit groups and are identified with signs visible to \nanyone entering the unit.  Id.  Staff are required to utilize proper personal protective equipment \n(“PPE”) prior to entering these units to minimize to potential for cross-contamination between \nunits.  Id. \n  Certain units have also been set up to quarantine inmates who, in light of guidance \nregarding eligibility for release to home confinement under the expanded consideration authority \ngranted to the Attorney General under the CARES Act, may soon be released to the community.  \nId. at ¶ 26.  In order to protect against the risk of transferring inmates to the community that will \n8 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 20 of 88\ncontribute to the spread of COVID-19, any inmate granted home confinement is placed in a 14-\nday  quarantine  prior  to  discharge  from  the  BOP  facility.    Id.    These  “home  confinement \nquarantine” units are intended to minimize the amount of time an inmate might be required to stay \nin a pre-release quarantine should they become eligible for this benefit.  Id.   \nThe Camp was placed on modified operations on March 19, 2020.  Id. at ¶ 27.  This \ninvolved dividing the Camp into four separate dormitory groups, each of which moves throughout \nthe facility so there is no opportunity to have contact with the other dormitory groups.  Id.   Each \ndormitory group has a designated shared bathroom and shower facility, eats in their assigned \ndormitory, and is allowed to use the recreation facilities only with inmates from their dormitory \ngroup.  Id.  Due to the fact there have been zero positive COVID-19 infections at the Camp, \nisolation and quarantine procedures have not been utilized at the Camp.  Id.  Nonetheless, space \nin the Unicor warehouse and at the Main Complex has been designated to perform these functions \nshould the need to isolate or quarantine Camp inmates arise in the future.  Id.   \n  The FSL was placed into modified status on March 19, 2020.  Id. at ¶ 28.  Housing at the \nFSL is a large dormitory that is divided into sections, with inmates assigned to live in cubicles \ncontaining bunks.  Id.  There are two areas in the Main Complex that have communal showers and \nbathrooms.  Id. at ¶ 7.  There are tables in the front of the dormitory for watching television.  Id.  \nThere is also an area in front of the dormitory that has exercise equipment, a law and leisure library, \nand offices.  Id.   Food services, psychology services, medical, education, and visiting is in a \nseparate building.  Id.  Areas of the FSL not ordinarily used as housing have been repurposed in \norder to accommodate isolation and quarantine procedures.  Id. at ¶ 28.  Further, recent COVID-\n19 infections at the FSL have created a need to utilize the kitchen as a separate quarantine space.   \nId.  The visiting room at the Main Complex has also been used as a quarantine space for at-risk \n9 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 21 of 88\nfemale inmates who were tested at the beginning of the emergency and are awaiting return to the \nFSL.  Id.  The number of temporary quarantine spaces needed should be reduced as the different \ngroups of inmates complete their quarantine periods (each established by the date the quarantine \nbegan) and can be reintroduced to the main living space at the FSL dormitory.  Id. \nThe Main Complex was placed into modified operations on March 29, 2020.  Id. at ¶ 29. \nThe Main Complex has seven units that are open dorm style, two television rooms, one area of \nTRULINCS stations and two rooms that can house ten to twelve inmates each.  Id. at ¶ 5.  The \nshowers and bathrooms are communal.  Id.  Two of these units have two-man cells with a toilet \nand sink in the cell.  Id.   These cell units also have communal showers, an area for television, and \nan area for phones.  Id.  The Main Complex facility has standalone housing units for isolation, \nquarantine (such as for newly-committed inmates; these inmates do not go straight into the general \npopulation), and “home confinement quarantine.”  Id. at ¶ 29.  Any Main Complex inmate who \nrequires isolation is placed in a single-occupancy cell with a solid door that locks.  Id.  The \nauditorium has been set up for quarantine for home confinement inmates.  Id.  The FCI also has a \nunit dedicated to those who are released from isolation to continue to recover before they are \nreturned to a general population unit.  Id.  \nShould the need arise, each facility retains the ability to create new isolation/quarantine \nspace.  Id. at ¶ 30.  For example, the Main Complex has been able to repurpose auditorium space \ninto a pre-release quarantine for inmates transferring to home confinement, and has preplanned \nturning the dormant Unicor (Federal Prison Industries) factory into temporary housing.  Id.  The \nCamp has already converted space in the Unicor warehouse into cubicle housing, and two \ntemporary buildings on loan from the United States Penitentiary in Lewisburg (PA) have been \nraised should additional isolation/quarantine space be needed.  Id.  Finally, the FSL has been able \n10 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 22 of 88\nto repurpose classroom and activity space inside the facility into temporary living quarters in order \nto isolate/quarantine inmates.  Id.  Additional, temporary measures that have been taken include \nusing the Main Complex visiting room as a quarantine facility for FSL inmates, and creating \nisolation cells inside the Main Complex for inmates from the FSL.  Id.   \nAny inmate at FCI Danbury presenting with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 is \nimmediately evaluated by a medical provider to determine whether testing and/or isolation is \nappropriate, and whether other measures (such as quarantine) should be implemented for inmates \nwith whom the symptomatic inmate has had contact.  Id. at ¶ 81.    \n2.  Hygiene and Safety Practices at FCI Danbury \nMaintaining institutional and personal hygiene is always a priority in a correctional setting. \nSince the COVID-19 pandemic however, institutional and personal hygiene has been elevated to \nthe utmost importance, especially since inmates have been largely restricted to their housing units \nsince implementing Phase Five of the COVID-19 Action Plan.  Id. at ¶ 31.   Maintaining the highest \nstandards of institutional and personal hygiene during modified operations is not only important \nfor purposes of infection control, but also to minimize the possibility of disturbances or other \nevents that might compromise the security and good order of the institution.  Id. \nThe Safety Department at FCI Danbury is responsible for distributing cleaning supplies \nthroughout the institutions.  Id. at ¶ 32.  These include but are not limited to cleaning chemicals, \nspray bottles, cleaning rags and applicators, and the equipment necessary to perform cleaning \ntasks.  Id.  The chemicals used for cleaning at FCI Danbury are distributed to all areas of the \ninstitution on a regular schedule, and if any particular area requires additional cleaning supplies, \nstaff assigned to that area can make arrangements with the Safety Department to receive more.  Id.  \nThe Warden does not believe that the Safety Department has ever run out of cleaning supplies \nsince the COVID-19 crisis began at FCI Danbury.   Id.    \n11 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 23 of 88\nCurrently, four specific cleaners are being used at FCI Danbury.  Id. at 33.   TriBase Multi-\nPurpose Cleaner, hdqC2 disinfectant cleaner, and Airlift Tropical 13 air freshener have been the \nordinarily employed cleaning chemicals at FCI Danbury.  Id.  Since the beginning of the COVID \nemergency however, a broad spectrum disinfectant, “Virex II/256” has been added to specifically \naddress the coronavirus threat.  Id.  Virex II/256 is now used throughout the institution.  Id. \nPrior to this pandemic, chemicals used for cleaning at FCI Danbury were distributed \nthroughout the institutions on a regular weekly and monthly schedule.  Id. at ¶ 34.  In between the \nregularly-scheduled distribution, staff were always able to request additional cleaning supplies if \nthey were needed.  Id.   Since the current emergency, however, FCI Danbury has gone to a daily \ndistribution of cleaning supplies.  Id. at ¶ 35.  On weekdays, an institution-wide announcement is \nmade for staff to place their cleaning bottles outside the doors of their housing units, and the Safety \nDepartment staff refills or replaces needed supplies.  Id.  While prior to the pandemic inmate \norderlies would report to the Safety Department to retrieve these supplies, in order to maintain the \nintegrity to the group quarantine, staff now perform these functions.   Id.  Of course, if additional \nsupplies are needed during the day, staff can coordinate the delivery of these items with the Safety \nDepartment.  Id. \nOnce in the housing units, cleaning supplies are maintained in small caddies or bins kept \nin staff offices or closets.  Id. at ¶ 36.  Inmates can then ask for a bin of cleaning supplies to bring \nback to their living areas.  Id.  Large area disinfection is being performed at both the FSL and the \nMain Complex through use of backpack cleaning chemical sprayers.  Id. at ¶ 37.  This work is \nperformed by inmate orderlies or staff, depending on the location (inmates cannot perform this \nwork in an area where they might come into contact with inmates not in their quarantine group).  \nId.  At this time, five more backpack sprayers are being routed to FCI Danbury from the BOP’s \n12 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 24 of 88\nCommand Center, and this will greatly expand the ability to perform this task.   Id.  Whether by \nbackpack unit or spray bottles, inmate orderlies (working only within their unit, to maintain the \nintegrity of the group quarantine) are cleaning all high-touch areas such as doorknobs, railings, \nknobs, and handles multiple times per day.  Id. \nAs a final measure intended to ensure all inmate living and activity areas are maintained in \nthe cleanest possible condition, the Warden has made each member of her Executive Staff \nindividually responsible for overseeing the condition of specific housing units.  Id. at 38.   \n3.  The Availability of Soap and Other Personal Hygiene Products \nInmates at FCI Danbury are provided with basic soap and personal hygiene products \n(razors,  toothbrushes,  toothpaste,  etc.)  by  the  institution.   Id.  at  ¶ 39.    These  toiletries  are \nmaintained by staff whose offices are located in the housing units, so there is never a reason an \ninmate should not have access to soap at FCI Danbury.  Id.   \nFCI Danbury also operates a centralized laundry, and inmates in this facility have their \nclothes (institution issued items as well as personal articles purchased from commissary) washed \nfor them by the laundry department.   Id. at ¶ 40.  Inmates at both the Camp and FSL are provided \nwith no-cost washers/dryers/laundry soap which they can use to clean clothes and linens.  Id. \nBeyond that, the  commissary  at FCI  Danbury  allows inmates to purchase toiletries, \nmedication, food, and other items not issued regularly as part of the institution administration.  Id. \nat ¶ 41.  Similar to the offerings at any convenience store, the commissary at FCI Danbury offers \na selection of up to 13 different soaps, to include Irish Spring, Dove, Pure Antibacterial, Noxema, \nand Neutrogena. Inmates can also buy Ajax dish detergent and laundry detergent from the \ncommissary.   Id.  A complete list of items FCI Danbury inmates can buy is available on the BOP’s \npublic  website  and  can  be  seen  at  https://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/dan/dan_ \ncomlist.pdf.  Id.  \n13 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 25 of 88\nA review of commissary records show that all four Petitioners have had regular access to \nthe commissary throughout this time and regularly purchase soap and other personal hygiene \nproducts.  Id. at ¶ 42.  Since the beginning of the year, Petitioner Martinez-Brooks has spent \napproximately $391.10 at the commissary, including the purchase of Pure Antibacterial soap on \nthree occasions (last purchased Pure Antibacterial Soap on April 2, 2020).   Id. at ¶ 43.  Since the \nbeginning of the year, Petitioner Cassidy has spent approximately $567.20 at the commissary, \nincluding the purchase of various brands of soap on five occasions (last purchased Irish Spring Icy \nBlast on April 1, 2020).  Id. at ¶ 44.  Since the beginning of the year, Petitioner Collier has spent \napproximately $921.90 at the commissary, including the purchase of various brands of soap on ten \noccasions (last purchased Dove Soap on April 27, 2020).  Id. at ¶ 45.  Since the beginning of the \nyear, Petitioner Madore has spent approximately $1,187.65 at the commissary, including the \npurchase of bar soap (last purchased three bars of Pure Antibacterial soap on March 24, 2020).  Id. \nat ¶ 46.   \n4.  Status of Personal Protective Equipment \nStaff and inmates at FCI Danbury have, and will continue to have, access to appropriate \nPPE.  Id. at ¶ 47.  Upon reporting to work each day, staff at FCI Danbury are provided with new \nsurgical masks at the staff screening site to wear throughout their shift.  Id. at ¶ 48.  Staff are \nrequired to wear these masks, and failure to do so may be cause for employee discipline under \nterms of Program Statement 3420.11 Standards of Employee Conduct.  Id. \nThere are areas of the institution where staff might require additional PPE to perform their \nduties.  Id. at ¶ 49.  These areas include but are not limited to Health Services, Receiving & \nDischarge, and isolation housing units.  Id.  In these areas, kits have been assembled which contain \nthe enhanced PPE to be used in that area (for example, gown, gloves, N-95 particulate respirators, \nface shields), and these kits are always available.  Id.  When the number of kits gets low, staff \n14 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 26 of 88\ncontacts Health Services and additional kits are provided.  Id.   In addition, kits are maintained in \nother areas of the institution (Control Center, Lieutenant’s Office) to ensure availability during all \nhours of the day.  Id. \nThroughout the institution and while working posts at the outside hospital, Correctional \nOfficers are provided with PPE appropriate for their assigned post.  Id. at ¶ 50.  Staff are instructed \nas to the proper use of PPE through various memoranda detailing the type of PPE required at a \ngiven post or for a specific duty.   Id. at ¶ 51.  Memoranda have also been circulated to instruct \nstaff as to the proper donning/doffing of PPE, and video instruction is also available on the \ncomputer desktop of every FCI Danbury employee.   Id. \nInmates at FCI Danbury were initially provided with two of the same surgical masks which \nwere provided to staff.  Id. at ¶ 52.  Once FCI Danbury was able to procure cloth masks, two cloth \nmasks were issued to every inmate.  Id.  Inmates can still request, and will be provided with, the \ndisposable surgical masks provided to staff.  Id.  Inmates are required to wear masks at all times \nexcept when they are eating or sleeping, and failure to do so may make the inmate subject to \ndiscipline under Program Statement 5270.09 Inmate Discipline Program.  Id.  Inmates performing \ncleaning or orderly duties have always had, and will continue to have, access to gloves or other \nPPE as may be necessary for them to perform their assigned duties.  Id. at ¶ 53.    \n5.  Staffing \nFCI Danbury staff work and live in an area of the country where there has been widespread \ncommunity transmission of COVID-19.  Id. at ¶ 54.  Through communications from the BOP \nleadership, local Executive Staffs, and individual supervisors, staff have been informed how to \nperform regular self-monitoring for symptoms, practice social distancing, and to disinfect and \nclean their work spaces.  Id.  Anyone who develops signs or symptoms of illness is sent home.  Id. \n \n15 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 27 of 88\nBeginning on or about March 25, 2020, staff at FCI Danbury were subjected to enhanced \nhealth screening prior to the start of their shift.  Id. at ¶ 55.  These enhanced screening measures \ninvolve every staff member reporting to a screening site in the front lobby prior to the start of their \nshift, where they are required to self-report any symptoms consistent with COVID-19 as well as \nany known or suspected COVID-19 exposure and are further required to have their temperature \ntaken.  Id. at ¶¶ 55, 88.  Staff are not permitted to report to their post without first reporting to the \nstaff screening site.  Id. \nIf a staff member reports symptoms consistent with COVID-19, has known or a suspected \nCOVID-19 exposure, or registers a temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher, they are sent home.  \nId. at ¶ 56.   A BOP medical officer will then contact the staff member to determine when it would \nbe safe and appropriate for them to return to the institution.  Id.   \nIf a staff member has been determined to be positive for COVID-19 following a laboratory \ntest, the following criteria is used to assess their suitability for returning to work: (a) at least 3 days \n(72 hours) need to have passed since recovery (defined as resolution of fever without the use of \nfever-reducing  medications);  and,  (b)  improvement  in  respiratory  symptoms  (e.g.,  cough, \nshortness of breath); and, (c) at least 7 days have passed since symptoms first appeared.  Id. at \n¶ 57.  If a staff member has been identified as a prolonged close contact of a COVID-19 positive \ncase, and did not have the appropriate PPE or had a breach in their PPE, as long as the staff member \nremains asymptomatic, they: (a) return to work for their regular shift; and (b) are required to \nundergo temperature monitoring and symptom checks upon arrival to work, and are also instructed \nto perform self-monitoring at home; and, (c) are instructed to immediately stop work, notify their \nsupervisor, and isolate at home if symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (e.g., fever, cough, or \nshortness of breath) develop; and, (d) are directed to quarantine themselves when not at work for \n16 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 28 of 88\na period of 14 days.

If a staff member at FCI Danbury is symptomatic or becomes \nsymptomatic, they: (a) are not allowed to report to work; and (b) are required to give notice to their \nSupervisor; and (c) are directed to notify their local Health Department or their personal healthcare \nprovider  Id. at ¶ 59.   \n6.  Testing \nFCI Danbury is conducting testing in accordance with CDC guidelines.  Id. at ¶ 79.  The \nCDC has explained that “[n]ot everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19,” and “decisions about \ntesting are at the discretion of state and local health departments and/or individual clinicians.”  See \ncdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html (last visited on May 2, 2020).   Id.  \nAs of April 9, 2020, FCI Danbury began daily temperature checks of the entire inmate \npopulation at the institution.  Id. at ¶ 80.  The Lieutenants at FCI Danbury have been provided with \ninfra-red no-touch thermometers to perform this task, and every day they visit each housing unit \nto take the temperature of all inmates assigned to that unit.  Id.  If in the course of performing these \ntemperature checks any inmate is found to have a temperature of 99 degrees or higher, Health \nService staff are contacted and the inmate is sent for a follow-up assessment to be performed by a \nlicensed health care provider.  Id.    \nAt FCI Danbury, the decision whether to test an inmate for COVID-19 is made by BOP \nmedical providers based on a number of criteria, including but not limited to: (1) the nature and \nseverity of the symptoms; (2) the inmate’s potential exposure to COVID-19; and (3) whether the \ninmate is considered “high-risk.”  Decl. at ¶ 82.  On April 14, 2020, the Camp received an “ID \nNOW  Abbot  Machine”  that  can  deliver  positive  or  negative  test  results  for  COVID-19  in \napproximately fifteen minutes.  Id.  FCI Danbury has 150 COVID-19 testing kits in stock.  Id.  \nFCI Danbury also has the ability to order and quickly receive additional kits from a designated \nvendor if the need arises.  Id.  \n17 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 29 of 88\nDuring the week of April 25, 2020 the office of Senator Christopher Murphy reached out \nto FCI Danbury to discuss testing of inmates at FCI Danbury.  Id. at ¶ 85.  Between May 2 and 3, \n2020, every FSL inmate was tested using these kits.  Id.  During this weekend, 143 tests were \nperformed, and 20 inmates at FSL tested positive for COVID-19.  Id.  Since the advent of the \nemergency, which includes the testing conducted over the past weekend noted above, 205 inmates \nhave been tested for COVID-19.  Id. at ¶ 83.  In total, 69 inmates and 56 staff have tested positive \nfor COVID-19.  Id. at ¶ 83.   \n7.  Medical Services at FCI Danbury \nThe Health Services department at FCI Danbury is staffed with both civilian health care \nproviders and uniformed officers from the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health \nService (“USPHS”).  Id. at ¶ 86.   In total, the Health Services department at FCI Danbury consists \nof one Health Services Administrator, two physicians, one part-time Mid-Level Provider, one \nIOP/ID  Registered  Nurse,  one  Registered  Nurse,  three  Emergency  Medical  Technician-\nParamedics, one dentist, one dental hygienist, one licensed clinical social worker, one medical \nrecords technician, one health services administrative assistant, three contract medical assistants, \none contract phlebotomist, and one contract x-ray technician.  Id.   Since the COVID-19 emergency \nbegan, three BOP and two contract Health Services staff were placed on leave due to testing \npositive for COVID-19.  Id. at ¶ 87.   Prior to the COVID-19 emergency two staff members were \non medical leave status and one had been granted paternity leave.  Id.  Due to these absences, the \nBOP’s Northeast Regional Office (“NERO”) sent a Medical Asset Support Team (“MAST”) to  \nassist FCI Danbury with its COVID-19 response.  Id.  This MAST includes an Associate Warden, \ntwo Physician Assistants, and one pharmacist.  Id. \nUnder the current state of emergency, instead of having inmates going to medical services \nfor treatment for non COVID-19 related symptoms, a social worker and hygienist go to the units \n18 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 30 of 88\nto pass out and collect sick call forms.  Id. at ¶ 90.  The social worker and hygienist are not \nconducting sick call but, instead, are bringing the forms back to medical staff for review.  Id.  The \nforms are triaged by a Registered Nurse and/or a Physician Assistant for appropriate action.  Id. \nInmates are not being denied access to further medical follow-up.  Id. at ¶¶ 84, 90.  Sick calls are \nplaced on the schedule, and staff round in all areas of the institution.  Id. at ¶ 90.  If an inmate \npresents with a more emergent case, the PA will call the inmate up to medical for an appointment.  \nId. \nAll inmates who present with COVID-19 symptoms are isolated and tested the same day, \nprovided testing supplies are available.  Id. at 91.  Under no circumstances are inmates who have \nbeen placed in isolation released to the general population prior to meeting the CDC’s symptom-\nbased criteria for appropriateness, which includes (1) being fever-free for greater or equal to 72 \nhours without the use of fever-reducing medication, and (2) respiratory symptoms have improved, \nand (3) at least 7 days have passed since the first symptoms appeared.  Id.   When an FCI Danbury \ninmate is receiving treatment for COVID-19 at an outside hospital, Health Services staff engage \nin daily contact and consultation with the community based infectious disease specialists providing \nthe treatment.  Id.  \nThe  pharmacy  at  FCI  Danbury  has  remained  functioning  throughout  this  period  of \nmodified operations.  Id. at ¶ 92.  Whenever possible inmates “self carry” their medications, \nmeaning they are allowed to maintain their prescription medications in their property and are \nresponsible for taking the medication themselves.  Id.  Otherwise, there are two scheduled “moves”  \nper day when inmates can, within their quarantine group, proceed to the clinic for “pill line” or \nstaff-assisted medication administration.

Compassionate Release \nThe BOP does not have the authority to provide inmates with “early release.”  A reduction \nof an inmate’s federal sentence can only be accomplished by an Article III judge; specifically, the \ninmate’s sentencing judge.  However, upon an inmate’s request, the Director of the BOP may make \na motion to an inmate’s sentencing court to reduce a term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. § \n4205(g) and 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A).  This process is outlined in the United States Department \nof Justice Federal Bureau of Prisons, Compassionate Release/Reduction in Sentence Procedures \nfor Implementation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 3582 and 4205(g), Program Statement 5050.50 (Jan. 17, 2019), \nhttp://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/5050_050_EN.pdf.2 \nStaff at FCI Danbury are receiving and processing requests for Compassionate Release as \nquickly as possible.  Id. at ¶ 94.  Indeed, since this emergency began (through May 4, 2020), the \nReduction in Sentence (“RIS”) Coordinator at FCI Danbury has received 241 requests for release.  \nId.  As of May 4, 2020, 136 completed requests have been processed and denied; 18 have been \nreturned to the inmate seeking further information; 70 are processing through the various staff who \nneed to review the specific application, and 17 are awaiting the Warden’s review.  Id. \nImportantly, while the BOP is processing these requests as expeditiously as possible, the \nstatute gives the BOP thirty (30) days to evaluate compassionate release requests before any  \nmotion may be presented in the sentencing court. 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A).   Further, the ultimate \ndecision lies with the sentencing judge.    \n \n                                                \n2 This BOP Program Statement and all other program statements and operations memoranda cited \nherein are available at www.bop.gov via the Resources link. \n \n20 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 32 of 88\nPetitioners  Martinez-Brooks,  Collier,  and  Cassidy  have  submitted  requests  for \ncompassionate release to the Warden, see Decl. at ¶ 95, and Petitioners Cassidy and Collier have \neven filed Motions for Compassionate Release with their respective sentencing judges.  Petitioner \nCassidy’s Motion for Compassionate Release was denied without prejudice as the United States \nDistrict Court for the Western District of New York found he had not exhausted administrative \nremedies.  See United States v. Cassidy, No. 1:17-CR-00116-WMS-MJR, Doc. No. 61, at p. 2 \n(W.D.N.Y. Apr. 24, 2020), docket sheet attached hereto as Exhibit B.  On May 4, 2020, Petitioner \nCassidy refiled his Motion for Compassionate Release, and this motion has been set down for \nhearing on May 6, 2020.  Id.  Petitioner Collier’s Motion for Compassionate Release is still \npending in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York.  See United \nStates v. Collier, No. 6:12-CR-06003-CJS (W.D.N.Y.), docket sheet, attached hereto as Exhibit C.   \nThe Petitioners have not claimed that they filed administrative claims relating to all other condition \nof confinement remedies they seek, and FCI Danbury does not have a record of any such claims.  \nDecl. at ¶ 97.   \nAdditionally,  to  date,  FCI  Danbury  inmates  have  filed  numerous  Motions  for \nCompassionate Release in the United States District Courts nationwide, including the United \nStates District Court for the District of Connecticut.  See Section VI.B, infra.  See also the United \nStates Attorney’s Office for the District of Connecticut’s Spreadsheet tracking Motions for \nCompassionate Release and Decisions Rendered by the Article III Judges in this District, attached \nhereto as Exhibit F.  \nB.  Home Confinement \nAt the Attorney General’s direction, the BOP has also significantly increased the number \nof inmates on home confinement by over 40% and continues to screen all inmates to determine \n21 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 33 of 88\nwhether they are appropriate for home confinement.3  By memoranda dated March 26, 2020, and \nApril 3, 2020, the Attorney General directed the BOP to “prioritize the use of [its] various statutory \nauthorities to grant home confinement for inmates seeking transfer in connection with the ongoing \nCOVID-19 pandemic.”  See Attorney General Memoranda dated March 26, 2020 (Exhibit D) and \nApril 3, 2020 (Exhibit E), attached hereto.  In assessing which inmates should be granted home \nconfinement, the Attorney General directed the BOP to consider the totality of the circumstances \nof each inmate, the statutory requirements for home confinement, and a series of factors including \nthe age and vulnerability of the inmate, the security level of the facility holding the inmate, the \ninmate’s conduct while incarcerated, the inmate’s score under the Prisoner Assessment Tool \nTargeting Estimated Risk and Needs, whether the inmate has a demonstrated and verifiable reentry \nplan that will prevent recidivism and ensure public safety (including verification that the conditions \nunder which the inmate would be confined upon release would present a lower risk of contracting \nCOVID-19 than the inmate would face at their current facility), and the inmate’s crime of \nconviction.  Exhibit E at pp. 1-2. \nIn addition to these factors, before granting an inmate release on home confinement, the \nAttorney General directed the BOP Medical Director, or his designee, “to make an assessment of \nthe inmate’s risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness, risks of COVID-19 at the inmate’s prison \nfacility, as well as the risks of COVID-19 at the location in which the inmate seeks home \nconfinement.”  Id. at 2.  FCI Danbury is following this guidance.  Decl. at ¶ 60. \nAlthough the BOP lacks the authority to release an inmate from his sentence, the BOP has \nthe authority to transfer a prisoner to home confinement for the remainder of his or her sentence \npursuant to provisions and limitations set forth 18 U.S.C. § 3624(c)(2) and 34 U.S.C. § 60541.  See \n                                                \n3  See  https://www.bop.gov/resources/news/20200405_covid19_home_confinement.jsp  (last \nvisited May 2, 2020).  \n22 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 34 of 88\nalso BOP Program Statement 7320.01, Home Confinement and BOP Operations Memorandum, \nHome Confinement under the First Step Act.   Decl. at ¶ 60.  Generally, the BOP may place a \nprisoner in home confinement only for the lesser of 10 percent of the term of imprisonment or 6 \nmonths.  18 U.S.C. § 3624(c)(2).  In order to appropriately evaluate an individual for home \nconfinement, FCI Danbury staff assesses the risk of criminal activity in the community and \ndetermines whether there is an appropriate home where the inmate can be placed.  Decl. at ¶ 62.  \nThis is a time and resource intensive process.  Upon receipt of the staff assessment, the BOP \nreviews the assessment and makes the final determination regarding home confinement.  Id. at \n¶ 63.  If approved, absent any disciplinary infractions, the inmate would serve the remainder of his \nor her sentence on home confinement after being quarantined for 14 days.  Id. at ¶ 64.  \nUnder 34 U.S.C. § 60541, the BOP may release some or all eligible elderly offenders and \neligible terminally ill offenders from BOP facilities to home detention, upon written request from \neither BOP staff, or an eligible elderly offender4 or eligible terminally ill offender5.   Decl. at ¶ 60.  \nIn order to appropriately evaluate an elderly or terminally ill individual for home confinement, the \nBOP assesses the risk of criminal activity in the community and determines whether there is an \nappropriate home where the individual can be placed.  Id.  Inmates that do not meet the criteria for \n                                                \n4 The statute defines “eligible elderly offender” to include an inmate who is not less than 60 years \nof age; who is serving a term of imprisonment that is not life imprisonment based on a conviction for an \noffense or offenses that do not include any crime of violence; has served two-thirds of the term of \nimprisonment to which the offender was sentenced; who has not been convicted in the past of any Federal \nor State crime of violence, sex offense, or other offense referenced in the statute; who has not been \ndetermined by BOP to have a history of violence, or of engaging in conduct constituting a sex offense or \nother excluded offense; who has not escaped, or attempted to escape from a BOP institution; whose release \nto home detention will result in a substantial net reduction of costs to the Federal Government; and who \nhas been determined by BOP to be at no substantial risk of engaging in criminal conduct or of endangering \nany person or the public if released to home detention.  34 U.S.C. § 60541. \n \n5 “Eligible terminally ill offender” is defined as an offender in the custody of BOP who meets all \nof the above-stated criteria except the age restriction, and has been determined by a medical doctor approved \nby BOP to be in need of care at a nursing home, intermediate care facility, or assisted living facility, or \ndiagnosed with a terminal illness.  34 U.S.C. § 60541. \n23 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 35 of 88\nthe elderly home confinement can be placed on home confinement under the BOP’s general \nauthority to do so.  18 U.S.C. § 3624(c)(2).   \nUnder the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), signed \ninto law on March 27, 2020, however, “if the Attorney General finds that emergency conditions \nwill materially affect the functioning of the BOP, the Director of the Bureau may lengthen the \nmaximum amount of time for which the Director is authorized to place a prisoner in home \nconfinement.”  Pub. L. No. 116-136, 516 § 12003(b)(2), 134 Stat. 281 (2020).  On April 3, 2020, \nthe Attorney General made that finding and authorized the Director of the BOP to immediately \nmaximize appropriate transfers to home confinement of all appropriate inmates where COVID-19 \nis materially affecting operations.  Exhibit E at 1; Decl. at ¶ 65.  In light of the COVID-19 \npandemic, the BOP is maximizing its authority to place inmates on home confinement and is \nexpediting the process as much as possible in furtherance of the Attorney General’s memoranda \ndated March 26, 2020, and April 3, 2020.  Decl. at ¶ 71.  The BOP has increased home confinement \nby over 69.1% since March 2020, and is continuing to aggressively screen inmates for home \nconfinement.  Id. at ¶ 73.      \n  Inmates do not need to apply to be considered for home confinement under the CARES \nAct.  Id. at ¶ 74.  The BOP Case Management staff are urgently reviewing all inmates to determine \nwhich ones meet the criteria established by the Attorney General.  Id.  While all inmates are being \nreviewed for suitability for home confinement, any inmate who believes he or she is eligible may \n request to be referred to home confinement and provide a release plan to his or her Case Manager.  \nId. \n  Pursuant to the Attorney’s General’s direction, the BOP is currently assessing a number of \nfactors to ensure that an inmate is suitable for home confinement.  Id. at 75.  The factors to be \n24 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 36 of 88\nconsidered when reviewing and referring inmates for home confinement are, in addition to the \nabove: primary or prior offense is not violent; primary or prior offense is not a sex offense; primary \nor prior offense is not terrorism; no detainer for the inmate; the inmate’s Mental Health Care Level \nis less than CARE-MH 4; the inmate’s recidivism risk score is Minimum; the inmate has had no \nincident reports in the past 12 months (regardless of severity level); the inmate is a U.S. citizen; \nthe inmate has a BRAVO score (custody classification) of Low or Minimum; the inmate has served \n25% or more of their sentence and have 18 months or less remaining; and the inmate has a viable \nrelease plan.  Id. at ¶¶ 75-76.   \n  As part of this review, not only does a Unit Team review each inmate, a review is conducted \nby the Medical Director, or his designee, and the Medical Department (“Medical”).  Id. at ¶ 63.  \nMedical  conducts  multiple  reviews.    Id.    Initially,  Medical  must  determine  the  age  and \nvulnerability of the inmate related to COVID-19 risk factors in accordance with CDC and \nprevention guidelines.   Id. at ¶ 62.  Additionally, Medical reviews the conditions under which the \ninmate would be confined upon release to determine whether those conditions would present a \nlower risk of contracting COVID-19 than the inmate would face at the BOP facility, and also \ndetermines whether frequent and on-going medical care is required within the next 90 days.  Id. at \n¶¶ 62-63. \n  Staff at FCI Danbury have been reviewing inmates for home confinement since the \nAttorney General’s March 26 guidance issued.  Id. at ¶ 78.  Because this guidance has changed \nseveral times (in some cases causing inmates to be reviewed more than once), an exact number of \ninmates that have been reviewed is impossible to arrive at.  Id.  However, with the assistance the \nCase Management Coordinator, the Warden estimates that approximately 159 FCI Danbury \ninmates have been reviewed for home confinement since March 26, 2020.  Id.  These reviews have \n25 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 37 of 88\nled to 21 FCI Danbury inmates being released to home confinement, and another 2 inmates having \nbeen released on furlough.  Id. \nIV.  THE PETITION AND ALLEGED FACTS \nThe gravamen of Petitioners’ allegation is that, because of their age and/or medical \nconditions, they have elevated risk of serious, adverse outcomes if they contract COVID-19 and \nmust be released from custody or placed on home confinement because detention at FCI Danbury \nper se poses an increased risk of health complications or death from COVID-19.  See Petition. \nA.  Petitioner Kenneth Cassidy \nPetitioner Cassidy is fifty-four year old inmate in the Main Complex at FCI Danbury.  \nPetition, Exhibit D at ¶ 1.  Petitioner Cassidy is serving a sentence of five years arising from a \nconviction for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and willful failure to file an income tax return.  Id. \n¶ 3.  Petitioner Cassidy’s release date is March 31, 2021, and his projected home confinement \nrelease date is October 1, 2020.  Id.  \nAccording  to  the  Petition,  Petitioner  Cassidy  has  significant  cardiovascular  issues, \nincluding ischemic heart disease (i.e., deficient blood supply from a narrowing of the blood \nvessels), unstable angina, and hypertension.  Petition ¶ 32.  Petitioner Cassidy claims he suffered \nthree heart attacks, including two in his thirties and has chronic bronchial asthma.  Id.   \n  On April 10, 2020, Petitioner Cassidy moved for release to home confinement or for a \nsentence reduction to time served under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A) on the ground that he is at \nheighted risk to develop COVID-19 given his asthma and cardiac conditions and the outbreak of \nthe coronavirus at FCI Danbury.  See Cassidy, No. 1:17-CR-00116-WMS-MJR, Doc. 61, at p. 2; \nExhibit B.

He \nsubmitted his first request on April 4, 2020, by way of an ‘Inmate Request to Staff’ form addressed to his \n26 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 38 of 88\nApril 24, 2020, the court denied Petitioner Cassidy’s motion without prejudice after determining \nthat the court lacked authority to order the relief Petitioner Cassidy sought under the compassionate \nrelease statutory provision, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), because Petitioner Cassidy had failed to \nexhaust his administrative remedies.  Exhibit B, Docket No. 61, at p. 6.  The court invited Petitioner \nCassidy to file an updated motion once exhaustion is complete.  Id. at p. 16, n. 9.  Petitioner \nCassidy’s administrative request for compassionate release was denied on April 22, 2010.  Decl. \nat ¶ 95.

Petitioner Martinez-Brooks is serving a 48 month sentence for wire \nfraud.7  Id.   Petitioner Martinez-Brooks’ release date is June 25, 2022.  Id. at ¶ 3.     \nAccording to the Petition, Petitioner Martinez-Brooks suffers from asthma, hypertension, \narthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (“SLE”).  Petition ¶ 26.  Petitioner Martinez-Brooks \nstates she takes Atenolol for hypertension and has a Proventil emergency inhaler and Asmanex \nTwisthaler (mometasone furoate inhalation powder, 220 mg) for her asthma.  Id.  Since her \nincarceration, Petitioner Martinez-Brooks claims she was proscribed steroids once for the joint and \nmuscle inflammation associated with her lupus.

He submitted \nhis second request on April 15, 2020, by way of another ‘Inmate Request to Staff’ form addressed to his \ncase manager.  (See Doc. No. 57-1, p. 2.)  While the government represents that Cassidy never sent his \nemail to the warden and never submitted his first request to his case manager, it has submitted no affidavits \nin that regard and, in fact, it readily obtained and submitted copies of these documents that were reportedly \nnever received. Accordingly, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, this Court finds that Cassidy first \nrequested compassionate release from the Bureau of Prisons on April 4, 2020.”   Exhibit B, Doc. 61 at n1. \n \n7 To date, there have not been any positive cases of COVID-19 at the Camp.

Petition, Exhibit C at ¶ 25.  Petitioner Martinez-Brooks states she was \ngiven paperwork to sign on April 19, 2020 relating to home confinement and/or a halfway house.  \nId. at ¶ 26.  However, Petitioner Martinez-Brooks claims that a memorandum came out on April \n21, 2020, stating that, if an inmate had not completed 50 percent of their sentence, they were \nineligible for compassionate release.  Id.  Petitioner Martinez-Brooks then referenced the April 23, \n2020, memorandum that amended this requirement to completion of 25 percent of the inmate’s \nsentence with 18 months or less remaining to serve.  Id.  Petitioner Martinez-Brooks does not \nindicate the status of her compassionate release request and does not state whether she has filed a \nmotion for compassionate release with her sentencing judge.  According to FCI Danbury records, \nPetitioner Martinez-Brooks filed a new administrative request for compassionate release on April \n24, 2020.  Decl. at ¶ 95.   \nC.

Petitioner Jackie Madore \nJackie Madore is a 50-year-old inmate in FSL at FCI Danbury.  Petition ¶¶ 3, 31.  Although \nthe Petition is silent as to Petitioner Madore’s conviction, the Petition states that she has 20 months \nremaining  on  her  sentence.    Id.    Petitioner  Madore  claims  she  suffers  from  hypertension, \nhypothyroidism, and Hepatitis C.  Id.    \n  The Petition is also silent as to whether Petitioner Madore filed an administrative claim \nseeking release or filed a motion for compassionate release.  The Respondents did not find that an \nadministrative claim had been submitted by Petitioner Madore or that a motion for compassionate \nrelease had been filed with a United Sates District Court.  Id. at ¶ 95.  \nE.  Petitioners’ Requested Relief \nPetitioners request broad and extraordinary relief, including the immediate “release from \ncustody or to home confinement members of the Subclass [identified by Petitioners as those at FCI \nDanbury who are 50 and over or those with serious medical conditions]”;  requiring Respondents \nto provide “medically adequate social distancing and health care and sanitation” for the remaining \n9848 inmates at FCI Danbury; the appointment of a Special Master “to make recommendations to \n                                                \n8   The Petition claims there are approximately 1046 inmates at FCI Danbury.  This number is \nincorrect.  As of the date of this filing, there are 984 inmates at FCI Danbury.

Petitioners also ask the Court to order \nRespondents “to identify within twenty-four (24) hours of the Court’s order, and submit to the \nCourt a list of, all Subclass members, and requiring Respondents to answer as to why the habeas \npetition and relief sought herein should not be granted”9 and to certify the Petition as a Class \nAction.  Id.  \nV.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW \nA.  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(1) \nAn action is properly dismissed under Rule 12(b)(1) “when the district court lacks the \nstatutory or constitutional power to adjudicate” the case.  See Doyle v. Midland Credit Mgmt., Inc., \n                                                \n9 On April 29, 2020, undersigned counsel advised Petitioners’ counsel that the BOP would provide \na list of all inmates at FCI Danbury whom the CDC has identified as being high-risk for severe illness from \nCOVID-19.  This includes individuals who are 65 years of age or older or those who suffer from either:  (1) \nchronic  lung  disease  or  moderate  to  severe  asthma;  (2)  serious  heart  conditions;  (3)  the \nimmunocompromised, which can be caused by many conditions, including cancer treatment, smoking, bone \nmarrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and prolonged use \nof corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications; (4) severe obesity (body mass index of 40 or \nhigher);  (5)  diabetes;  (6)  chronic  kidney  disease  undergoing  dialysis;  (7)  liver  disease.  \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html  (last \nvisited 04/30/2020).  Due to Privacy Act concerns, the list would include the identity of the inmate, the \ninmate’s sentencing court[,] and the case number of their underlying criminal conviction but would not \ninclude  information  about  the  specific  medical  condition  suffered  by  each  inmate.    Additionally, \nundersigned counsel advised that a request for a Protective Order would need to be submitted, and entered \nby the Court, before production of the list.   \n \nPetitioners’ counsel indicated that he would have to discuss this with “the team” and would get \nback to undersigned counsel the next day, April 30, 2020.  To date, undersigned counsel have not received \na response from Petitioners’ counsel about this list.   \n \nIf the Court agrees with Respondents that this Petition, as well as the Motion for a Temporary \nRestraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction, should be denied, this request becomes moot. \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 42 of 88\n722 F.3d 78, 80 (2d Cir. 2013) (citation omitted).  When “deciding a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, the \ncourt may also rely on evidence outside the complaint,” including competent affidavits.  See \nCortlandt St. Recovery Corp. v. Hellas Telecomms., S.à.r.l, 790 F.3d 411, 417 (2d Cir. 2015).   \nB.  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6) \nA motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) should be granted where a complaint fails \nto plead facts to state a claim that is plausible on its face.  See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 677-\n78 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion, the court may consider, in addition to the factual allegations of the complaint, “documents \nappended to the complaint or incorporated in the complaint by reference, and ... matters of which \njudicial notice may be taken.”  Concord Assocs., L.P. v. Entm’t Props. Tr., 817 F.3d 46, 51 n.2 (2d \nCir.  2016)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).    “Agency  determinations  and  administrative \nfindings are public records of which a court may properly take judicial notice.”  Lia v. Saporito, \n909 F. Supp. 2d 149, 161 (E.D.N.Y. 2012).10  \nVI.  ARGUMENT \nPetitioners bear the burden of establishing the Court’s jurisdiction.  Petitioners have failed \nto allege a sufficient basis to invoke the Court’s jurisdiction over the subject matter. \nA.  The Court Lacks Subject Matter Jurisdiction to Hear Petitioners’ Claims as \nPetitioners have Failed to Exhaust Administrative Remedies \nBefore the Court can properly consider a petition for habeas corpus pursuant to Section \n2241, the Petitioners must exhaust all administrative remedies.  Sufasso v. Wilson, No. 3:20-CV-\n513 (MPS), Doc. 5 (D. Conn. Apr. 20, 2020) (“As an initial matter, the Second Circuit has held \n                                                \n10 Alternatively, should the Court construe the present motion as one for summary judgment, \nsummary judgment is appropriate where, as here, “there is no genuine issue of material fact and . . . the \nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); see also Celotex v. Catrett, \n477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986). \n \n31 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 43 of 88\nthat an inmate must exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing a habeas petitions under 28 \nU.S.C. § 2241.” (quoting United States v. Credidio, 2020 WL 1644010, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 2, \n2020) (citing Carmona v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, 243 F.3d 629, 634 (2d Cir. 2001))).  “The failure \nto exhaust constitutes a procedural default that bars judicial review unless the petitioner makes a \nshowing of cause and prejudice.”  Sufasso, No. 3:20-CV-513 (MPS) (quoting Credidio, 2020 WL \n1644010, at *2 (citation omitted)).  See also United States v. Smalling, 644 Fed. App’x 3, 4-5 (2d \nCir. 2016) (challenge to execution of sentence must be brought in a Section 2241 proceeding, but \nonly “after exhaustion of administrative remedies”); Wilson v. Wells, No. 3:17CV40 (AWT), 2017 \nWL 6667515, at *2 (D. Conn. Sept. 6, 2017) (“a prisoner must exhaust his or her administrative \nremedies prior to filing a section 2241 petition or exhaust state court remedies prior to filing a \nsection 2254 petition.”). \n  As the Petitioners make various claims seeking multiple remedies, the Respondents have \ndivided  the  exhaustion  argument  into  two  segments.    First,  have  the  Petitioners  exhausted \nadministrative  remedies  with  respect  to  their  request  for  release  from  custody  or  to  home \nconfinement.  As release from custody or placement in home confinement is not a remedy available \nunder a 28 U.S.C. § 2241 conditions of confinement habeas, an exhaustion analysis is not essential \nwith respect to these claims.  Second, have Petitioners exhausted administrative remedies with \nrespect to their specific requests for additional “safety” measures (i.e. soap, towels, access to \nquarantined telephone, etc.) at FCI Danbury.  The answer to this question is no.  Petitioners have \nnot filed any administrative claims with respect to their requests for additional “safety” measures \nat FCI Danbury.       \nB.  This Court Lacks Authority to Divest the BOP and Sentencing Courts of Their \nJurisdiction to Place Inmates in Home Confinement or The Sentencing Judge’s \nAuthority to Amend a Term of Imprisonment \nPetitioners seek to change the terms of their sentence in light of the pandemic.  However, \n32 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 44 of 88\n“‘[a] judgment of conviction that includes [a sentence of imprisonment] constitutes a final \njudgment’ and may not be modified by a district court except in limited circumstances.”  Dillon v. \nUnited States, 560 U.S. 817, 824 (2010) (quoting 18 US.C. § 3582(b)).  As the Supreme Court has \nrecognized, finality is an important attribute of criminal judgments, and one “essential to the \noperation of our criminal justice system.”  Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 309 (1989) (plurality \nopinion).  Accordingly, it is well-established that once a district court has pronounced a sentence \nand the sentence becomes final, even that district court has no inherent authority to reconsider or \nalter that sentence.  Rather, it may do so only pursuant to statutory authorization.  See, e.g., United \nStates v. Addonizio, 442 U.S. 178, 189 & n.16 (1979).  Consistent with this principle of finality, \n18 U.S.C. § 3582(c) provides that a court generally “may not modify a term of imprisonment once \nit has been imposed,” except in three circumstances: (1) upon a motion for reduction in sentence \nunder 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A); (2) “to the extent otherwise expressly permitted by statute or by \nRule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,” 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(B); and (3) where \nthe defendant was sentenced “based on” a retroactively lowered sentencing range. 18 U.S.C. \n§ 3582(c)(2); United States v. Gotti, No. 02-CR-743-07 (CM), 2020 WL 497987, at *1-*6 \n(S.D.N.Y.  Jan.  15,  2020)  (noting  that  “[a]  court  is  not  required  to  reduce  a  sentence  on \ncompassionate release grounds, even if a prisoner qualifies for such reduction because of his \nmedical condition”). \nAlthough the Second Circuit has construed Section 2241 as permitting habeas petitioners \nto raise challenges to prison conditions, “Section 2241 does not provide an avenue for challenging \nthe length of a sentence” based on poor conditions of confinement.  See Grant v. Terrell, No. 10-\nCV-2769 (MKB), 2014 WL 2440486, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. May 29, 2014) (reasoning that “Section \n2241 permits habeas petitioners to challenge the post-conviction administration of a sentence, but \n33 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 45 of 88\nit does not provide an avenue for challenging the length of a sentence” and denying petitioner’s \nrequest for “a two-level sentence reduction and an order of immediate release, based on the \nconditions of confinement” of petitioner’s prison); Medina-Rivera v. Terrell, No. 11-CV-0734 \n(BMC), 2011 WL 3163199, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July 26, 2011) (noting that the petitioner’s “desired \nremedy—a sentence reduction—is not of the type that can be granted in response to [Section 2241] \nclaims regarding conditions of confinement”); Serra v. Terrell, No. 10-CV-03044 (DLI), 2013 WL \n5522850, at * 1 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2013) (same).    \nCourts in other circuits also have held that Section 2241 does not permit release based on \nconditions of confinement.  See, e.g., United States v. Washington, 549 F.3d 905, 917 (3d Cir. \n2008) (holding that a court has jurisdiction to alter a sentence only as specifically permitted by \nstatute); Wright v. Terrell, No. 10-CV-3492 (PGS), 2011 WL 5117851, at *2 (D.N.J. Oct. 26, \n2011) (rejecting Section 2241 petition by a petitioner who claimed not to challenge the imposition \nof his sentence upon finding that “[p]etitioner is actually seeking a modification of his sentence \nbased on the conditions of his confinement at the MDC, which is not cognizable in a habeas \npetition under § 2241”); Glaus v. Anderson, 408 F.3d 382, 387 (7th Cir. 2005) (holding that “[i]f \nan inmate establishe[s] that his medical treatment amounts to cruel and unusual punishment, the \nappropriate remedy would be to call for proper treatment, or to award him damages; release from \ncustody is not an option” (citation omitted)); Gomez v. United States, 899 F.2d 1124 (11th Cir. \n1990) (same); Crawford v. Bell, 599 F.2d 890, 891 (9th Cir. 1979) (same); Cook v. Hanberry, 596 \nF.2d 658, 660 (5th Cir. 1979) (same).  Indeed, “[a] court may not modify a term of imprisonment \nonce it has been imposed except pursuant to statute.”  Gotti, 2020 WL 497987, at *6  (noting that \n“[a] court is not required to reduce a sentence on compassionate release grounds, even if a prisoner \nqualifies for such reduction because of his medical condition”). \n34 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 46 of 88\nTherefore, this Court should not permit Petitioners to improperly seek a reduction in their \ncriminal sentences via a Section 2241 petition, based on the allegedly unconstitutional conditions \nof confinement at the FCI Danbury.  Further, Petitioners are not entitled to have this Court release \nor transfer to home confinement more than 984 inmates, or any subset thereof, from FCI Danbury.  \nThere are specific legal avenues for consideration of the release or transfer of these inmates.  Those \ninclude home confinement and compassionate release.   \nRegarding home confinement, the BOP may place a prisoner in home confinement only \nfor the lesser of 10 percent of the term of imprisonment or 6 months.11  See 18 U.S.C. § 3624(c)(2).  \nUnder the CARES Act, “if the Attorney General finds that emergency conditions will materially \naffect” the BOP’s functioning, the BOP Director may “lengthen the maximum amount of time for \nwhich [he] is authorized to place a prisoner in home confinement” under 18 U.S.C. § 3624(c)(2).   \nPub. L. No. 116-136, § 12003(b)(2) (2020).  On April 3, 2020, the Attorney General authorized \nthe Director of the Bureau to immediately maximize appropriate transfers to home confinement of \nall appropriate inmates held in BOP facilities.  See April 3, 2020 Memo from the Attorney General,  \n“Increasing Use of Home Confinement at Institutions Most Affected by COVID-19”.   \nThe determination of whether to place a prisoner in home confinement is solely in the \ndiscretion of the BOP and “not reviewable by any court.”  18 U.S.C. § 3621(b); 18 U.S.C. § \n3624(c)(4).  The factors to be considered are: the inmate’s age and vulnerability to COVID-19 per \nCDC guidelines, the inmate’s conduct in prison including violence and gang activity, the inmate’s \nrecidivism risk, the inmate’s reentry plan, the inmate’s danger to the community.  18 U.S.C. § \n                                                \n    11 The BOP’s policy and procedures regarding home confinement are outlined in BOP Program \nStatement 7320.01, Home Confinement and BOP Operations Memorandum, Home Confinement under the \nFirst Step Act, both of which are available on www.bop.gov via the Resources tab.  See 18 U.S.C. § \n3624(c)(2) and 34 U.S.C. § 60541.  \n \n35 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 47 of 88\n3621(b).    Some  offenses,  such  as  sex  offenses,  will  render  an  inmate  ineligible  for  home \nconfinement.  Id.  Notably, regarding compassionate release, neither the BOP nor this Court has \nthe authority to provide inmates with “early release.”  A reduction of an inmate’s federal sentence \ncan only be accomplished by the inmate’s sentencing judge.  However, upon an inmate’s request, \nthe Director of the BOP may make a motion to an inmate’s sentencing judge to reduce a term of \nimprisonment under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A).12   \nImportantly,  while  the  BOP  is  processing  these  compassionate  release  requests  as \nexpeditiously as possible, the statute gives the BOP 30 days to evaluate them before any motion \nmay be presented in the sentencing court.  18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A).  Further, the ultimate \ndecision lies with the sentencing judge.  Id.  Here, as noted above, Judge Skretny denied Petitioner \nCassidy’s motion for compassionate release for failure to exhaust, and Petitioner Collier’s motion \nfor compassionate release is still pending before her sentencing judge.  Petitioners Martinez-\nBrooks and Madore have both chosen not to file motions seeking compassionate release. \nBy filing this action, the Petitioners are not only trying to circumvent the process, but are \nalso trying to create a mechanism through which any unfavorable ruling from a sentencing judge \ncan be challenged in another district court.  Petitioners’ efforts to forum shop or create new forums \nwould have the result of depriving sentencing judges from the ability to maintain control over the \ninmate sentences they have issued.     \nBy seeking release to home confinement through this civil action, Petitioners also are \nessentially seeking to divest the BOP of its statutory and regulatory discretion as to which inmates \nshould be placed in home confinement.  Recently, a Louisiana district court dismissed a Section \n                                                \n12 This process is outlined in the U.S. Dep’t of Justice Fed.

Myers, No. \n20-CV-422 (TAD)(KK), 2020 WL 1939583, at *8 (W.D. La. Apr. 22, 2020).

The Court  \nappreciates the government’s recognition that Brito is a fully qualified candidate for release.”).  \nSee also Exhibit F.   \nPetitioners try to circumvent this established law and process by relying on the concept of \n“enlargement” of a sentence to construe the relief requested here as falling within Section 2241. \nBut “enlargement” is not a cognizable remedy in this Court.  Petitioners and their declarant \nProfessor  Judith  Resnik  cite  to  inapposite  cases  holding  that  federal  courts  have  “inherent \n39 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 51 of 88\nauthority” to grant bail as interim relief pending habeas litigation.  See, e.g., Ostrer v. United \nStates, 584 F.2d 594, 596 n.1 (2d Cir. 1978); Mapp v. Reno, 241 F.3d 221, 226 (2d Cir. 2001) \n(explicitly reaffirming Ostrer and its progeny).  But this line of cases only applies to prisoners \nwhose habeas petitions allege a defect in their convictions or sentences that, if granted, would \nentitle them to a release from custody.  See Ostrer, 584 F.2d at 596 n.1 (interim bail may be \navailable to a habeas petitioner “contesting the legality of his custody,” emphasis added); U.S. ex \nrel.  Schonbrun  v.  Commanding  Officer,  Armed  Forces,  403  F.2d  371,  374  (2d  Cir.  1968) \n(“Generally habeas corpus is available only to a petitioner who is entitled to release from unlawful \nrestraint . . . .”); Stepney v. Lopes, 597 F. Supp. 11, 13 (D. Conn. 1984) (interim bail in the post-\nconviction  context  may  be  granted  for  habeas  petitions  challenging  “the  illegality  of  the \npetitioner’s custodial status, presumably from its inception”).   \nHere, Petitioners’ theory of relief is not that there is a defect in their convictions or \nsentences or that they are entitled to release from the BOP custody, but rather that they should be \nallowed to complete their terms of custody in a different setting because they believe the conditions \nat the facility where they are currently being held are unconstitutional.  Therefore, this not a case \nin which bail is appropriate under Ostrer/Mapp; and there is simply no authority for this Court to \ncraft a new provisional remedy to “enlarge” the custody of convicts serving sentences to which no \ncollateral challenge is pending before it.  See also Gomez, 899 F.2d at 1125-27 (bail pending Eighth \nAmendment habeas challenge to conditions of confinement was improper because “even if Gomez \nprevails on his habeas petition, he would not be entitled to be released from prison” and he was \nnot allowed “more relief on a preliminary basis than he would be entitled to if he ultimately \nprevail[ed] on his constitutional claims”).   \n40 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 52 of 88\nMoreover, any authority this Court might have to “enlarge” Petitioners’ custody would be \ncircumscribed by 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2) of the PLRA, which provides that, in civil action \nchallenging conditions of confinement, any preliminary injunction must “be narrowly drawn, \nextend no further than necessary to correct the harm the court finds requires preliminary relief, and \nbe the least intrusive means necessary to correct that harm.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2); see also Jones \nv. Smith, 720 F.3d 142, 145 n. 3 (2d Cir. 2013) (assuming that the PLRA applies to conditions of \nconfinement claims brought under Section 2241).  Clearly, a mass release of all FCI Danbury \ninmates, or a subclass thereof including Petitioners, to home confinement is one of the least \nnarrowly drawn and most intrusive means imaginable.  Petitioners have not demonstrated, as they \nmust, that such a mass release is necessary to curtail any heightened risk of COVID-19 unique to \nFCI Danbury.  Indeed, even in the one case the government is aware of that–we submit incorrectly–\nendorsed Professor Resnick’s “enlargement” theory, Wilson v. Williams, No. 20-CV-00794, 2020 \nWL 1940882, *4 (N.D. Ohio April 22, 2020) (appeal pending), the court declined to order a mass \nrelease of inmates to home confinement, and instead ordered only that the BOP, not the Court \nand not a Special Master, evaluate each member of a medically vulnerable subclass’s eligibility \nfor release or transfer to another BOP facility.  Id. at *10-11 (emphasis added).    \nEven if the Court determines that it has the inherent authority to grant mass “enlargement” \nof custody during the pendency of this action pursuant to Ostrer/Mapp—notwithstanding Section \n3626(a)(2)’s restrictions on provisional relief—Petitioners have not met the stringent standard for \nsuch relief.  The Second Circuit has explained that “a habeas petitioner should be granted bail only \nin unusual cases,” and the “standard for bail pending habeas litigation is a difficult one to meet: \nThe petitioner must demonstrate that the habeas petition raise[s] substantial claims and that \nextraordinary circumstances exist[] that make the grant of bail necessary to make the habeas \n41 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 53 of 88\nremedy effective.”  Mapp, 241 F.3d at 226 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted); see \nalso Rado v. Meachum, 699 F. Supp. 25, 26-27 (D. Conn. 1988) (holding that the relevant factors \nare whether (1) “substantial claims” are set forth in the petition; (2) there is a “demonstrated \nlikelihood the petition will prevail”; and (3) there are “extraordinary circumstances” attending the \npetitioner’s situation which would “require” the grant in order to make the writ of habeas corpus \n“effective,” presumably if granted) (citations omitted). \nPetitioners have not demonstrated that this is a “special case” warranting the extraordinary \nrelief of interim release.  Mapp, 241 F.3d at 226.  First, for all the reasons discussed in Section \nVII, supra, Petitioners fail to meet the first requirement because they have not demonstrated that \nthey raise “substantial claims” in their habeas petition, that is, that they have “a substantial \nlikelihood . . . of succeeding on the merits of” their petition.  See Ancona v. Lantz, No. 3:05-CV-\n363 (MRK), 2005 WL 839655 (D. Conn. April 8, 2005) (quoting Mapp, 241 F.3d at 230 n.13).   \nPetitioners also cannot meet the second, independent requirement that they demonstrate “that \nextraordinary circumstances exist[] that make the grant of bail necessary to make the habeas \nremedy effective.” Mapp, 241 F.3d at 226 (emphasis added); see also Skakel v. Murphy, No. 3:07-\nCV-1625 (PCD), 2009 WL 2253175, *5 (D. Conn. July 27, 2009).  The relief Petitioners seek is \neither release to home confinement or changes in the conditions at FCI Danbury.  Petitioners have \nnot demonstrated why a grant of interim release to home confinement (essentially, the ultimate \nrelief they hope to obtain in their petition) is necessary to make the remedy—release to home \nconfinement or changes of conditions at FCI Danbury—effective.  See e.g., Rosemond v. Decker, \nNo. 19-cv-9657 (NSR-LMS), 2020 WL 1876318, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 14, 2020) (denying \nemergency relief from custody under Mapp based on a serious medical condition in the face of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic because interim release was not necessary to make the habeas remedy–a \n42 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 54 of 88\nconstitutionally adequate bond hearing–effective).   \n1.  Res Judicata Bars Petitioners’ Immediate Release \nRes judicata also bars a plaintiff from relitigating the same issues that were or could have \nbeen raised in a prior action.  See Federated Dep’t Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394, 398 (1981); \nFreeman v. Sikorsky Aircraft Corp., 151 F. App’x. 91, 92 (2d Cir. 2005) (affirming dismissal of \nan action as barred by res judicata because claim had already been decided on the merits and action \nwas raising the precise issues, arising from same events, as raised in petitioner’s first complaint); \nStaffer v. Bouchard Transp. Co., Inc., 878 F.2d 638, 643 (2d Cir. 1989) (explaining that “[r]es \njudicata, or claim preclusion, bars the revival of claims that already have been litigated” and \nadding that “[r]es judicata can also operate to bar claims that were not originally asserted.”)).  “The \ndoctrine of res judicata, or claim preclusion, holds that ‘a final judgment on the merits of an action \nprecludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in \nthat action.’”  Brown Media Corp. v. K&L Gates, LLP, 854 F.3d 150, 157 (2d Cir. 2017).  The \npurpose of the res judicata bar “is based on the requirement that the plaintiff must bring all claims \nat once against the same defendant relating to the same transaction or event.”  Robinson v. Purcell \nConstr. Corp., 647 F. App’x 29, 30 (2d Cir. 2016) (quotation marks omitted). \nPetitioners Cassidy and Collier filed motions for compassionate release pursuant to 18 \nU.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), citing the same allegedly unconstitutional conditions of confinement in \ntheir Section 3582 motions as set forth in the Petition.  See Exhibits B and C.  Petitioner Cassidy’s \nsentencing judge denied his Section 3582 motion without prejudice and invited him to refile the \nmotion once he properly exhausted administrative remedies.  Exhibit B at Docket No. 61.  To the \nextent Petitioner Cassidy seeks immediate release from FCI Danbury, Judge Skretny’s ruling \nprecludes Petitioner Cassidy’s claim here for immediate release.  Petitioner Cassidy does not \nsimply get a “do-over” in the District of Connecticut after his same claim was rejected by Judge \n43 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 55 of 88\nSkretny in the Western District of New York.  Instead, as indicated by Judge Skretny, Petitioner \nCassidy can refile his motion for compassionate release after exhausting administrative remedies.  \nIn fact, on May 4, 2020, Petitioner Cassidy did exactly as instructed.  Id. at Docket No. 62.  A \nhearing on this motion is set for May 6, 2020 in the Western District of New York.  Id. at Docket \nNo. 63. \nFurther, Petitioner Collier’s compassionate release application remains pending in the \nWestern District of New York, before her sentencing judge, who has the statutory authority to \ngrant her release.  See Exhibit C at Docket No. 65.  This Court has no analogous authority. \n2.  Section 3626 Precludes the Remedy Requested By Petitioners \nPetitioners request habeas relief and the release of thousands, if not hundreds, of inmates \nfrom FCI Danbury.  However, the PLRA, 18 U.S.C. § 3626, titled “Appropriate remedies with \nrespect to prison conditions,” places strict limits on Courts’ ability to order the release of inmates \n“in any civil action with respect to prison conditions,” and precludes a single district judge from \ndoing so.  Id. § 3626(a)(3)(A)-(B).  That law applies to “any civil proceeding arising under Federal \nlaw with respect to the conditions of confinement or the effects of actions by government officials \non the lives of persons confined in prison, but does not include habeas corpus proceedings \nchallenging the fact or duration of confinement in prison.”  Id. § 3626(g)(2).  In such a suit, the \nCourt “may enter a temporary restraining order or an order for preliminary injunctive relief,” but \nsuch injunctive relief “must be narrowly drawn, extend no further than necessary to correct the \nharm the court finds requires preliminary relief, and be the least intrusive means necessary to \ncorrect that harm.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2).  Under Section 3626, a “prisoner release order”—\nwhich “includes any order, including a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunctive relief, \nthat has the purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison population, or that directs the \nrelease from or nonadmission of prisoners to a prison,” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(4)—may “be entered \n44 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 56 of 88\nonly by a three-judge court,” id. § 3626(a)(3)(B), and then only if certain conditions have been \nmet.  Among other requirements, “no court shall enter a prisoner release order unless—(i) a court \nhas previously entered an order for less intrusive relief that has failed to remedy the deprivation of \nthe Federal right sought to be remedied through the prisoner release order; and (ii) the defendant \nhas  had  a  reasonable  amount  of  time  to  comply  with  the  previous  court  orders.”    Id.  § \n3626(a)(3)(A). \nCongress  enacted  the  PLRA  “to  oust  the  federal  judiciary  from  day-to-day  prison \nmanagement.”  Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Rouse, 129 F.3d 649, 655 (1st Cir. 1997); see \nalso Benjamin v. Jacobson, 172 F.3d 144, 182 (2d Cir. 1999) (en banc) (Calabresi, J., concurring) \n(“The in banc majority argues at length that Congress meant to get the federal courts out of the \nbusiness of running jails, and it cites any number of congressional statements to that effect.”).  \n“Congress intended the PLRA to revive the hands-off doctrine,” which was “a rule of judicial \nquiescence derived from federalism and separation of powers concerns.”  Gilmore v. California, \n220 F.3d 987, 991, 997 (9th Cir. 2000).  “Courts must be sensitive to the State’s interest in \npunishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation, as well as the need for deference to experienced and \nexpert prison administrators faced with the difficult and dangerous task of housing large numbers \nof convicted criminals.”  Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 511 (2011).  Section 3626 thus “restrict[s] \nthe equity jurisdiction of federal courts,” Gilmore, 220 F.3d at 999, and, “[b]y its terms . . . restricts \nthe circumstances in which a court may enter an order ‘that has the purpose or effect of reducing \nor limiting the prison population.’”  Plata, 563 U.S. at 511 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)).  The \nPLRA’s “requirements ensure that the ‘last resort remedy’ of a population limit is not imposed ‘as \na first step.’”  Plata, 563 U.S. at 514 (quoting Inmates of Occoquan v. Barry, 844 F.2d 828, 843 \n(D.C. Cir. 1988)).  “The release of prisoners in large numbers . . . is a matter of undoubted, grave \n45 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 57 of 88\nconcern.”  Plata, 563 U.S. at 501. \nInsofar as the Petitioners in this case are seeking release as a remedy for the allegedly \nunconstitutional conditions at FCI Danbury—either for themselves or for their putative class \nmembers—Section 3626 prevents this Court from granting that relief.  Under Section 3626, “[t]he \nauthority to order release of prisoners as a remedy to cure a systemic violation of the Eighth \nAmendment is a power reserved to a three-judge district court, not a single-judge district court.”  \nPlata, 563 U.S. at 500 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)); 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3)(B) (“In any civil action \nin Federal court with respect to prison conditions, a prisoner release order shall be entered only by \na three-judge court.”). \nMoreover, such an order may not be entered unless “(i) a court has previously entered an \norder for less intrusive relief that has failed to remedy the deprivation of the Federal right sought \nto be remedied through the prisoner release order; and (ii) the defendant has had a reasonable \namount of time to comply with the previous court orders.”  18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3)(A).  And even \na three-judge court may order prisoners released to remedy unconstitutional prison conditions \n“only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence” that “crowding is the primary cause of \nthe violation” and “no other relief will remedy [it].”  Id. § 3626(a)(3)(E)(i)-(ii). \nHere, there can be no dispute that the instant lawsuit is a “civil action with respect to prison \nconditions”  governed  by  Section  3626,  which  defines  “civil  action  with  respect  to  prison \nconditions” broadly to mean “any civil proceeding arising under Federal law with respect to the \nconditions of confinement or the effects of actions by government officials on the lives of persons \nconfined in prison, but [that term] does not include habeas corpus proceedings challenging the fact \nor duration of confinement in prison.”  18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(2).13 \n                                                \n13 One court recently reached this conclusion in an identical case.  In Money v. Pritzker, Nos. 20-\nCV-2093 & 20-CV-2094, 2020 WL 1820660 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 10, 2020), inmates from various Illinois \n46 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 58 of 88\nSection 3626 strictly limits the relief that this Court may grant and precludes the Court \nfrom releasing inmates from FCI Danbury as requested by Petitioners.  Id. § 3626(a)(3)(B).  \nC.  Petitioners Have Failed to Exhaust Administrative Remedies for All Remaining \nRemedies Sought in Their Petition  \nIn addition to seeking release from custody or home confinement, Petitioners \nrequested the Court to order additional remedies (“safety requests”) which include: \n•  Ensure  that  incarcerated  individuals  can  remain  six  feet  apart  to  practice  social \ndistancing in compliance with CDC Guidance; \n \n•  Ensure that each incarcerated individual receives a free and adequate personal supply \nof: hand soap sufficient to permit frequent hand washing, paper towels, facial tissues, \ncleaning implements such as sponges or brushes, and disinfectant products that are \neffective against COVID-19; \n \n•  Ensure that all individuals have access to hand sanitizer containing at least 60% \nalcohol; \n \n•  Provide daily access to showers and clean laundry, including clean towels after each \nshower; \n \n•  Require that all FCI Danbury staff wear PPE consistent with the CDC Guidance, \nincluding masks and gloves, when interacting with visitors and incarcerated individuals \nor when touching surfaces in common areas; \n \n•  Provide an anonymous mechanism for incarcerated individuals to report staff who \nviolate these guidelines so that appropriate corrective action may be taken; \n \n•  Take each incarcerated person’s temperature daily (with a properly disinfected and \naccurate thermometer) to identify potential COVID-19 infections; \n \n•  Assess each incarcerated individual daily through questioning to identify potential \nCOVID-19 infections; \n \n•  Conduct immediate testing for anyone displaying known symptoms of COVID-19; \n                                                \nDepartment of Correction facilities brought purported class action lawsuits seeking release of prisoners \nover 12,000 prisoners in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Court held that the PLRA prevented it from \nentering the relief requested by Petitioners for the release of inmates.  Id. at *14.  See also Jones v. Smith, \n720 F.3d at 145, n. 3 (assuming that the PLRA applies to conditions of confinement habeas claims brought \nunder Section 2241). \n \n47 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 59 of 88\n \n•  Immediately provide clean masks for all individuals who display or report potential \nCOVID-19 symptoms until they can be evaluated by a qualified medical professional \nor placed in non-punitive quarantine and ensure the masks are properly laundered with \nreplacements as necessary; \n \n•  Ensure that individuals identified as having COVID-19 or having been exposed to \nCOVID-19 are properly quarantined in a non-punitive setting, with continued access \nto showers, recreation, mental health services, reading materials, commissary, phone \nand video visitation with loved ones, communication with counsel, and personal \nproperty; \n \n•  Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces with disinfectant products effective \nagainst  the  virus  that  causes  COVID-19  (at  the  manufacturer’s  recommended \nconcentration), as well as surfaces in common areas, every two hours during waking \nhours, and at least once during the night; \n \n•  Ensure incarcerated people are provided guidance on how to protect themselves from \nCOVID-19 and reduce COVID-19 transmission; \n \n•  Assure incarcerated people are told that they will not be retaliated against for reporting \nCOVID-19 symptoms; \n \n•  Respond to all emergency (as defined by the medical community)requests for medical \nattention within an hour; \n \n•  Provide incarcerated individuals with sufficient and effective cleaning supplies free of \ncharge so that they may clean frequently touched items, such as phones, before use; \n \n•  Provide frequent communication to all incarcerated individuals regarding COVID-19, \nmeasures taken to reduce the risk of infection, best practices for incarcerated people to \navoid infection, and any changes in policies or practices; \n \n•  Craft a mechanism to ensure compliance through the appointment of an independent \nmonitor  with  medical  expertise  to  ensure  compliance  with  these  conditions,  and \nprovide  the  monitor  with  unfettered  access  to  medical  units,  confidential \ncommunication with detained individuals in and out of quarantine, and surveillance \nvideo of public areas of the facilities. \n \nPetition, pp. 67-70. The Petitioners have made no effort to present their conditions of confinement \nsafety request claims in accordance with the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act.   Decl.  ¶ 97.   \n“[F]ederal prisoners must exhaust their administrative remedies prior to filing a petition for \nhabeas relief.”  Carmona, 243 F.3d at 634.  Only when “legitimate circumstances beyond the \n48 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 60 of 88\nprisoner’s control preclude him from fully pursuing his administrative remedies” can failure to \nexhaust be forgiven.  Id.  In other words, Petitioners can only bring a habeas corpus motion without \nhaving exhausted his administrative remedies if he can demonstrate that there was an external \ncause of his failure and that this cause resulted in prejudice.  Id.   \nIn order to exhaust their administrative remedies, federal inmates must proceed through the \nBOP’s four-step administrative remedy procedure.  See 28 C.F.R. § 542, Subpart B;14 see also \nBarber v. Perdue, No. 9:11–CV–0127 (NAM/DEP), 2012 WL 5996342, at *4 (N.D.N.Y. Nov. 9, \n2012) report and recommendation adopted by 2012 WL 5996866 (N.D.N.Y. Nov. 30, 2012).  To \ncomplete the first step, inmates must present any issue regarding their confinement informally to \nstaff, who must then attempt to resolve the issue.  28 C.F.R. § 542.13(a).  Second, if the informal \nresolution is unsuccessful, the inmate must submit a formal Administrative Remedy Request to \nthe Warden, on a designated form, within twenty days of the event that triggered the complaint.  \n28 C.F.R. § 542.14(a).  Third, the inmate must appeal any dissatisfactory Warden response by \nfiling an appeal with the Regional Director, in this case the NERO and SERO, of the BOP within \ntwenty days of the Warden’s signature of the response.  28 C.F.R. § 542.15(a).  Finally, the inmate \nmust appeal the Northeast Regional Director’s negative decision to the Office of General Counsel \nwithin thirty calendar days of the NERO or SERO’s signature of the initial appeal.  Id.  Only upon \ncompletion of all four of these steps can the inmate have successfully exhausted his administrative \nremedies.  28 C.F.R. §§ 542.14–542.15.  No complaint raised through the administrative remedy \nprocess is considered fully exhausted until considered by the Bureau of Prisons’ Office of General \nCounsel.  See, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.14 - 542.15; Strong v. Lappin, 2010 WL 276206 at * 4 (E.D.N.Y. \n                                                \n14 Federal inmates are required to comply with the procedural rules set forth in BOP Program \nStatement 1330.18, “Administrative Remedy Program”, and as codified at 28 C.F.R. § 542, Subpart B, in \norder to exhaust the administrative remedy process.   \n49 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 61 of 88\nJan. 15, 2010) (“Until the BOP’s Central Office considers the appeal, no administrative remedy is \nconsidered to be fully exhausted.”). \n“[T]he Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) exhaustion requirement requires proper \nexhaustion.”  Woodford v.

Proper exhaustion, in turn, demands \ncompliance with [a penal institution]’s deadlines and other critical procedural rules.”  Id. at 90.  \nThus, to meet the requirement of proper exhaustion, “a prisoner must file complaints and appeals \nin the place, and at the time, the prison’s administrative rules require.”  Acosta v.

Cir. 2007) (holding proper exhaustion requires a \nplaintiff to procedurally exhaust his claims by “complying with the system’s critical procedural \nrules”).

Dec. 9, 2016) (“Meeting the exhaustion process after a federal action has been \nfiled does not, therefore satisfy the exhaustion requirement.”); Shepherd v. Lempke, 2017 WL \n1187859 at *3 (N.D.N.Y. March 30, 2017) (citing Neal v. Goord, 267 F.3d 116, 121-22 (2d Cir. \n2001), abrogated in part on other grounds by Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516 (2002)); Nellson, 2020 \nWL 1890670, at *5 (“The Court finds that plaintiff has failed to exhaust his administrative \nremedies before seeking judicial relief.  In reaching this conclusion, the Court does not overlook \nthe risks of COVID-19 at [the BOP facility at issue] or in the prison system generally.  But the \n50 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 62 of 88\nCourt may not alter the mandatory requirements of the PLRA for COVID-19 or any other special \ncircumstance.” (citing Ross v. Blake, 136 S. Ct. 1850, 1856-57 (2016))).   \nThe Supreme Court has made clear that the exhaustion requirement applies to all suits \nregarding prison life, Porter 534 U.S. at 532, including when a prisoner seeks injunctive relief, \nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 847 (1994) (in cases seeking injunctive relief to address \n“current” prison conditions, inmates are not “free to bypass adequate internal prison procedures \nand bring their health and safety concerns directly to court”).   And, it is explicitly mandatory.  See \nRoss, 136 S. Ct. at 1856; see also Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 211 (2007) (“There is no question \nthat exhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA.”)  \nThe only exception to the exhaustion requirement is when the administrative remedy \nprocess is “unavailable.”  Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1858.  In Ross, the Supreme Court outlined just three \nsituations in which a prisoner can show that the administrative remedy process is “unavailable”: \n(1) “when (despite what regulations or guidance materials may promise) it operates as a simple \ndead end—with officers unable or consistently unwilling to provide any relief to aggrieved \ninmates,” such as in the hypothetical situation in which “a prison handbook directs inmates to \nsubmit their grievances to a particular administrative office—but in practice that office disclaims \nthe capacity to consider those petitions”; (2) when “some mechanism exists to provide relief, but \nno ordinary prisoner can discern or navigate it”; and (3) “when prison administrators thwart \ninmates from taking advantage of a grievance process through machination, misrepresentation, or \nintimidation.”  Id. at 1859-60.   \nThe PLRA’s exhaustion requirement applies to habeas corpus proceedings.  Gonzalez v. \nPerrill, 919 F.2d 1 (2d Cir. 1990) (“[i]t is well settled that an appellant must exhaust his \nadministrative remedies before seeking habeas corpus relief in the federal courts”); see Rogers v. \n51 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 63 of 88\nUnited States, 180 F.3d 349, 357-58 (1st Cir. 1999) (“[o]nce the administrative remedies under the \nBureau of Prison’s Administrative Remedies Program are exhausted . . . prisoners may then seek \njudicial review of the request for designation by filing a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241.”); \nMoscato v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 98 F.3d 757, 760 (3d Cir. 1996) (failure to pursue \nadministrative remedies barred judicial review of loss of inmate’s good time credits); United States \nv. Flanagan, 868 F.2d 1544, 1545 (11th Cir. 1989) (shortening of sentence is in the first instance \nan administrative, not a judicial function); Sayyah v. Farquharson, 382 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 2004) \n(common law exhaustion doctrine “almost universally” premises judicial review upon the prior \nexhaustion of administrative remedies).  \nAlthough Petitioners in this habeas make an unsupported allegation that the administrative \nprocess at FCI Danbury was suspended, see Petition ¶ 49, this is untrue.  The fact that the all \nPetitioners, except for Petitioner Madore, have filed administrative claims for compassionate \nrelease under 18 U.S.C. § 3252 belies their current claims of unavailability of the administrative \nprocess.  Likewise, the fact that Petitioner Cassidy’s request was denied on April 22, 2020 and \nPetitioner Collier’s request was sent back to her to be corrected, evidences that the administrative \nprocess is operational. Additionally, a review of SENTRY (the BOP’s computerized inmate \nmanagement program which contains, among other things, a record of every grievance filed by \nany inmate throughout the agency) shows that inmates at FCI Danbury have filed 48 formal written \nAdministrative Remedy Requests with the Warden’s office between the dates March 1, 2020, and \nMay 2, 2020.  Decl. at ¶ 96.  13 of these Administrative Remedy Requests were requesting \ncompassionate release or home confinement.  Id.  As a matter of comparison, SENTRY shows the \nWarden’s office received 61 formal written Administrative Remedy Requests during this same \ntime period in 2019; 37 formal written Administrative Remedy Requests during this same time \n52 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 64 of 88\nperiod in 2018; and 33 formal written Administrative Remedy Requests during this same time \nperiod in 2017.  Id.  Petitioners are also very aware of how to properly submit an Administrative \nRemedy Request.  A review of SENTRY shows that Petitioner Collier’s most recent grievance \nwas a filing made with the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office on March 9, 2020, appealing an \naccess to exercise equipment complaint she filed with the Warden on January 10, 2020.   Id. at \n¶ 97.  Petitioner Martinez-Brooks’ most recent grievance was filed in August, 2019, at which time \nshe was appealing the denial of a lower bunk pass.  Id.  Petitioner Cassidy’s most recent grievance \nwas filed during a prior term of incarceration, when on September 7, 2007 while incarcerated at \nFCI Fort Dix New Jersey, he requested a transfer to a different institution.   Id.  Inmate Madore \nhas never filed a grievance regarding any matter whatsoever while in the BOP custody.  Id.  An \nadditional review of SENTRY shows that Petitioners have not filed any grievances since the \nCOVID emergency began.  Id.  \nWhile  Petitioners  might  attempt  to  argue  that  seeking  safety  measures  through  the \nadministrative process would be futile, there is also no evidence that is true.  Additionally, such an \nargument  would  ignore  that  the  Supreme  Court  defines  “available”  relief  through  the \nadministrative process as some—not all—relief that the inmate seeks.  Total and immediate relief \nis not the standard for exhaustion; “the possibility of some relief” is.  Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1859.   \nLikewise,  Petitioners  do  not,  and  cannot,  argue  that  requiring  them  to  exhaust \nadministrative remedies with respect to these safety requests would jeopardize their well-being.  \nDoing so, would completely overlook the fact that the BOP regulations provide for an expedited \nresponse to administrative requests “determined to be of an emergency nature which threatens the \ninmate’s immediate health or welfare.”  28 C.F.R. § 542.18. \n53 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 65 of 88\nPetitioners do not assert that they engaged in the administrative process with respect to the \nsafety requests sought as a remedy in this Petition.  Nor do Petitioners assert that the process could \nnot potentially provide any relevant relief whatsoever.   In this case, the COVID-19 pandemic has \nrapidly evolved over the course of just the past few weeks, and the BOP’s response has evolved \nwith it.  Most of the allegations in the Petition do not reflect the current conditions at FCI Danbury.   \nHad Petitioners raised their concerns directly with the institution, the BOP could have corrected \nPetitioners’ mistaken impressions regarding the actions FCI Danbury is taking to address COVID-\n19, and this litigation may have been avoided.  The rapidly changing nature of this pandemic thus \nfavors adherence to the administrative framework, and Petitioners’ request for an order with \nrespect to the safety measures outlined above, and contained on pages 67-70 of the Petition, should \nbe denied and dismissed.    \nD.  This Court Lacks Jurisdiction to Appoint a Special Master to Essentially Sit as an \nArticle III Judge \nPetitioners ask this Court to “[a]ppoint[] a special master pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 63 \n[sic] or an expert under Federal Rule of Evidence 706 to make recommendations to the Court \nregarding the number of incarcerated people that FCI Danbury can house consistent with CDC \nGuidance on best social distancing and hygiene practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19.”  \nPetition (Prayer for Relief) ¶ f.15  Petitioners’ request must be soundly rejected. \nFirst, the Court cannot give a Special Master powers that even it does not have.  See Livas, \n2020 WL 1939583, at *8 (denying habeas petition seeking release of inmates due to COVID-19 \nas the Court cannot serve as “a de facto ‘super’ warden” of the BOP facility).  It is well-established \nthat federal courts are “ill equipped” to deal with problems of prison administration.  See Turner \n                                                \n15 Respondents assume Petitioners actually meant appointment of a Special Master pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. Rule 53, not 63 as alleged.   \n54 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 66 of 88\nv. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 84 (1987) (quoting Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 405 (1974), \noverruled on other grounds by Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401 (1989)); Benjamin, 172 F.3d \nat 182 (en banc) (Calabresi, J., concurring) (“The in banc majority argues at length that Congress \nmeant to get the federal courts out of the business of running jails, and it cites any number of \ncongressional statements to that effect.  I agree.”); “Running a prison is an inordinately difficult \nundertaking that requires expertise, planning, and the commitment of resources, all of which are \npeculiarly within the province of the legislative and executive branches of government.”  Turner, \n482 U.S. at 84-85 (“Prison administration is [] a task that has been committed to the responsibility \nof [the legislative and executive branches], and separation of powers concerns counsel a policy of \njudicial restraint.”).  Moreover, the PLRA restricts the Court’s ability to appoint a Special Master \nfor the purposes of compliance with the Eighth Amendment.  Webb v. Goord, 340 F.3d 105, 111 \n(2d Cir. 2003) (“The PLRA has substantially limited the capacity of federal courts to appoint \nspecial masters to oversee prison conditions, specifically in order to ensure compliance with the \nEighth Amendment.”).  Finally, given the fluid nature this medical crisis, the official guidance, \nand the conditions at FCI Danbury, BOP is in a better position to respond and modify conditions \nas necessary; any report by a Special Master risks being outdated by the time the parties dispute it \nand the Court makes findings. \nEven if the Court had the authority to appoint a Special Master, no Special Master would \nhave the powers conjured up by the Petitioners.  In short, a Special Master does not, and indeed, \ncannot, possess the attributes that Article III of the Constitution demand here.  “The role of the \nSpecial Master is not meant to supplant the role of the court.”  Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve System v. Pharaon, 140 F.R.D. 642, 649 (S.D.N.Y. 1991); Idan Comput., Ltd. v. Intelepix, \nLLC,  No.  CV-09-4849  (SJF)  (ARL),  2010  WL  3516167,  at  *3  (E.D.N.Y.  Aug.  27,  2010) \n55 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 67 of 88\n(appointment of a special master is the exception, not the rule) (citations omitted).  The Petitioners \nask the Court to appoint a Special Master to make suggestions about how FCI Danbury should be \nrun in light of the pandemic, which would inevitably place the Court, should it wish to act on those \nsuggestions, in the position of a “super warden.”  Holleman v. Zatecky, 951 F.3d 873, 880 (7th Cir. \n2020) (declining to interfere with prison transfer because “[w]e are not super-wardens who sit to \ncritique the efficacy or wisdom of prison management choices.”). \nIndeed, a Special Master would be ill-equipped to take over the authority (let alone have \nthe collective depth of knowledge and experience) of BOP officials to determine how best to \nmanage their facilities in light of an evolving national pandemic.  See In re Bituminous Coal \nOperators’ Ass’n, 949 F.2d 1165, 1168 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (granting writ of mandamus against a \ndistrict judge because the judge “has no discretion to impose on parties against their will ‘a \nsurrogate judge,’ a substitute from the private bar charged with responsibility for adjudication of \nthe case.”); Stauble v. Warrob, Inc., 977 F.2d 690, 695 (1st Cir. 1992) (“Because Rule 53 cannot \nretreat from what Article III requires, a master cannot supplant the district judge.”).  Indeed, it is \nlong established that “Article III bars a district court ‘of its own motion, or upon the request of one \nparty’ from ‘abdicat[ing] its duty to determine by its own judgment the controversy presented, and \ndevolve that duty upon any of its officers.’”  Stauble, 977 F.2d at 695 (quotation omitted). \nFinally, Petitioners fail to address Rule 53(a)’s restrictions on the appointment of a Special \nMaster.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 53.  For example, Petitioners make no attempt to explain why criminal \ndefendants cannot “effectively and timely” have their claims addressed by the “available district \njudge or magistrate judge of the district.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 53(a)(1)(C).  Indeed, incarcerated \ncriminal defendants have already raised their COVID-19 concerns in other cases in this district.  \nSee Section VI.B., infra.  The variation in the results of these cases demonstrates that there is a \n56 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 68 of 88\nfunctioning system in place to review and make individualized determinations based on specific \nfacts.  The Petitioners fail to point to any decision (and undersigned counsel are unaware of any) \nwhere a district court has held that it was unable to address a defendant’s motion in an effective or \ntimely manner, which establishes that a Special Master is not warranted. \nAdditionally, as Respondents do not consent to the appointment of a Special Master, the \nCourt should not take the unusual step of appointing one absent such consent.  See Wasley Prod., \nInc. v. Bulakites, No. 3:03-CV-383 (MRK)(WIG), No. 3:03-CV-1790 (MRK)(WIG), 2006 WL \n3834240, at *11 (D. Conn. May 31, 2006) (it is “impermissible to refer fundamental issues of \nliability to a special master over the objection of one or more parties”).  Accordingly, Petitioners’ \nrequest for appointment of a Special Master should be denied.    \nVII.  EVEN IF THE COURT HAD JURISDICTION, PETITIONERS’ CLAIMS ARE \nSUBJECT TO DISMISSAL \nEven if the Court had jurisdiction (which Respondents submit it does not, as explained \nabove), Petitioners’ claims are subject to dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). \nA.  Applicable “Deliberate Indifference” Standard \nThe Eighth Amendment protects against the infliction of “cruel and unusual punishments.”  \nU.S. Const. amend. VIII. To satisfy the Eighth Amendment standards, prison officials “must  \nprovide humane conditions of confinement,” specifically they “must ensure that inmates receive \nadequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical care.”  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 832. \nInmates alleging Eighth Amendment violations based on unsafe prison conditions must \ndemonstrate that prison officials were deliberately indifferent to their health or safety by subjecting \nthem to a substantial risk of serious harm.  See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834.  Prison officials display \na deliberate indifference to an inmate’s well-being when they consciously disregard an excessive \nrisk of harm to the inmate’s health or safety.  Id. at 838-40.  It is “only ‘the unnecessary and wanton \n57 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 69 of 88\ninfliction of pain’ . . . [which] constitutes cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth \nAmendment.”  Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 319 (1986) (quoting Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. \n651, 670 (1977)).  \n“[I]f  a  particular  condition  or  restriction  .  .  .  is  reasonably  related  to  a  legitimate \ngovernmental objective, it does not, without more, amount to ‘punishment.’”  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 \nU.S. 520, 539 (1979).  “[T]he effective management of the detention facility . . . is a valid objective \nthat may justify imposition of conditions” that are discomforting and restrictive, without the \ninference that such restrictions are intended as punishment.  See Bell, 441 U.S. at 540.  Moreover, \n“[it] is obduracy and wantonness, not inadvertence or error in good faith, that characterize the \nconduct prohibited by the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, whether that conduct occurs in \nconnection with establishing conditions of confinement, supplying medical needs, or restoring \nofficial control over a tumultuous cellblock.”  Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 299 (1991). \n“[A] prison official violates the Eighth Amendment only when two requirements are \nmet”—both an objective and a subjective component.  See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834.  First, the \nobjective component of an Eighth Amendment claim requires that the deprivation must be \n“sufficiently serious.”  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 833.  “[O]nly those deprivations denying ‘the minimal \ncivilized measure of life’s necessities’ . . . are sufficiently grave to form the basis of an Eighth \nAmendment violation.”  Wilson, 501 U.S. at 298 (citing Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347 \n(1981)).  In claims like this, an inmate must show that he is incarcerated under conditions posing \na substantial risk of harm.  See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834.  “[T]he alleged deprivation must be \nsufficiently serious, in the sense that a condition of urgency, one that may produce death, \ndegeneration, or extreme pain exists.”  Hathaway v. Coughlin, 99 F.3d 550, 553 (2d Cir. 1996) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \n58 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 70 of 88\nSecond, the subjective component relates to the defendant’s state of mind, and requires \ndeliberate indifference.  See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834.  “[O]nly the unnecessary and wanton \ninfliction of pain implicates the Eighth Amendment.”  Id. (quotation omitted).  The subjective \nprong or second requirement that must be shown before an Eighth Amendment violation can be \nfound is that the prison official must have a “sufficiently culpable state of mind.”  Id. at 833; \nSalahuddin v. Goord, 467 F.3d 263, 280 (2d Cir. 2006) (requiring “a sufficiently culpable state of \nmind.”) (citing Wilson, 501 U.S. at 300).  “To be cruel and unusual punishment, conduct that does \nnot purport to be punishment at all must involve more than ordinary lack of due care for the \nprisoner’s interests or safety.”  Whitley, 475 U.S. at 319.  As the Supreme Court explained “[i]n \nprison-conditions cases that state of mind is one of ‘deliberate indifference’ to inmate health or \nsafety.”  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834 (quotation omitted).  Thus, to establish a violation of the Eighth \nAmendment, the inmate must show that prison officials “know[s] of and disregard[s] an excessive \nrisk to inmate health or safety.”  Id. at 837 (emphasis added). \nTo prove the second element, Petitioners must show that “the charged official act[ed] or \nfail[ed] to act while actually aware of a substantial risk that serious inmate harm will result. . . . \nThe reckless official need not desire to cause such harm or be aware that such harm will surely or \nalmost certainly result.  Rather, proof of awareness of a substantial risk of the harm suffices.”  \nSalahuddin, 467 F.3d at 280 (citing Farmer, 511 U.S. at 835-37, 842). \nA  showing  of  the  subjective  “deliberate  indifference”  element  “requires  more  than \nnegligence, but less than conduct undertaken for the very purpose of causing harm.”  Hathaway, \n37 F.3d at 66 (citing Farmer, 511 U.S. at 835).  That is, the “deliberate indifference” prong requires \nPetitioners to show that a prison official “knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate \nhealth or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn \n59 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 71 of 88\nthat a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.”  Hathaway, 37 \nF.3d at 66 (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837).  As discussed below, Petitioners here cannot \nestablish a constitutional violation. \nThis Court should assess FCI Danbury’s actions in light of Petitioners’ constitutional \nclaims, but it must not substitute its judgment for that of the BOP.  “[I]t is not the district court’s \nown belief about medical necessity that controls, but what was known and understood by prison \nofficials in crafting their policy.”  Kosilek v. Spencer, 774 F.3d 63, 82 (1st Cir. 2014) (citing \nWilson, 501 U.S. at 298).  As such, although this Court cannot abdicate its responsibility to ensure \nthat the limits imposed by the Constitution are not ignored, the court does not “sit to substitute its \nown judgment for that of prison administrators.”  Id. at 92.  \nB.  Petitioners are not Subject to an Unreasonable Risk of Harm at FCI Danbury \nDeliberate  indifference  does  not  cover  all  medical  care  or  all  harms,  but  rather \n“constitute[s] an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain or [is] repugnant to the conscience of \nmankind.”  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 105-06 (1976).  “[O]nly such indifference that can \noffend ‘evolving standards of decency’” can establish a violation of the Eighth Amendment.  See \nEstelle, 429 U.S. at 105-06.  In the context of exposing prisoners to risk of communicable disease, \na claim must be dismissed if it does not reach the law’s threshold of a threat that is so severe that \nit would be “contrary to current standards of decency for anyone to be so exposed.”  Helling v. \nMcKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 35 (1993).  “[C]onditions that cannot be said to be cruel and unusual under \ncontemporary standards are not unconstitutional.”  Rhodes, 452 U.S. at 347.  “A prison official’s \nduty under the Eighth Amendment is to ensure ‘reasonable safety,’ a standard that incorporates \ndue regard for prison officials’ unenviable task of keeping dangerous men in safe custody under \nhumane conditions.”  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 844-45. \nHere,  Petitioners  cannot  establish  that  they  have  suffered  a  “sufficiently  serious” \n60 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 72 of 88\ndeprivation.  See Wilson, 501 U.S. at 297.  To be sure, the spread of COVID-19 within the United \nStates puts everyone at some degree of risk of getting sick, but the BOP has taken appropriate steps \nto mitigate those risks throughout its inmate population.16  Since first learning of COVID-19, BOP \nhas instituted a multi-step action plan and taken extensive measures to mitigate the risks COVID-\n19 poses throughout its inmate population, including with respect to the inmate population at FCI \nDanbury.   As set forth above, those measures include providing inmate and staff education; strict \nlimitations  of  movement  within  FCI  Danbury;  suspension  of  most  visits  to  FCI  Danbury; \nconducting  inmate  and  staff  screening;  putting  into  place  testing,  quarantine,  and  isolation \nprocedures in accordance with BOP policy and CDC guidelines; ordering enhanced cleaning and \nmedical supplies; and taking a number of other preventative measures.  Additionally, FCI Danbury \nimplemented the “modified operations” directive in a number of ways to reduce the spread of \nCOVID-19 among inmates, including: (1) meals are brought to inmates in their respective housing \ndormitories; (2) providing health services within unit for routine medical issues, and allowing only \ninmates from the same units, who are sheltering in place together, to be in the same area for medical \nvisits and pill lines; (3) inmates are all provided masks and are required to wear them, or be subject \nto discipline; and (4) extensive cleaning and sanitizing measures are taking place within FCI \nDanbury.  See Decl. for the extensive list of measures taken by BOP and FCI Danbury.   \n                                                \n16 Courts around the country have recently received challenges to detention on the grounds of \nCOVID-19 in the criminal bail context and have recognized the government’s public health efforts, \nparticularly the efforts of the Bureau of Prisons, to address the COVID-19 crisis.

See e.g., Pet. Section II, pp. 12-17. What Petitioners fail to \nrecognize is that this situation is also true of many, if not all, of the correctional institutions, both \nstate and federal, nationwide.  FCI Danbury has attempted to achieve social distancing by locking \ndown each dormitory so that members of each dormitory only have contact with other members \nof that dormitory, akin to family units in the general population.  While recognizing that these \nfamily units are bigger than what one would find in similar family units in the community, this \npractice has substantially limited exposure.  See Hines v. Youssef, No. 1:13-CV-00357 (AWI-JL), \n2015 WL 164215, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 13, 2015) (“Unless there is something about a prisoner’s \nconditions of confinement that raises the risk of exposure substantially above the risk experienced \nby the surrounding communities, it cannot be reasoned that the prisoner is involuntarily exposed \nto a risk the society would not tolerate.”).  At FCI Danbury, each dormitory is essentially a closed \nfamily unit and the BOP separates each unit from other units, visitors, and sick inmates.  BOP staff \nalso wear masks and/or PPE and give inmates masks to wear.  During movement, which occurs \nonly with their unit, inmates are able to, and are encouraged to, maintain social distancing while \nin line.  And while Petitioners reiterate that they are unable to effectively maintain social distancing \nin contravention of CDC guidance, although six-foot distancing would “ideally” be followed, the \nCDC guidance published specifically for prison institutions acknowledges that complete social \ndistancing may not be feasible in jail. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/ \ncorrection-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html (last visited May 2, 2020); Mays v. \nDart, –- F. Supp. 3d –-, 2010 WL 1812381, at *10 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 9, 2020).   \nFor  these  reasons,  Petitioners  have  failed  to  establish  that  they  are  subject  to  an \nunreasonable risk of harm, and their constitutional claims must fail.   \n62 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 74 of 88\nC.  BOP has not Shown Deliberate Indifference and has Taken Appropriate Measures \nto Protect the Health of Inmates at FCI Danbury and the Public \nPetitioners likewise cannot prove that any officer at FCI Danbury “knows of and disregards \nan excessive risk to inmate health or safety.”  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837.  The test is subjective, \nmeaning “the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a \nsubstantial risk of serious harm exists, and he [or she] must also draw the inference.”  Id.  To \nsupport a claim for deliberate indifference to future health problems, the condition of confinement \ncomplained about must be “sure or very likely to cause serious illness.”  Helling, 509 U.S. at 33 \n(regarding exposure to environmental tobacco smoke).  The Second Circuit has delineated the \nrequirements  of  a  conditions-of-confinement  claim  brought  by  inmates  alleging  inadequate \nmedical care.  In Charles v. Orange County, the Second Circuit held that “[i]n order to establish a \nviolation of a right to substantive due process, a plaintiff must demonstrate not only government \naction but also that the government action was so egregious, so outrageous, that it may fairly be \nsaid to shock the contemporary conscience.”  Charles, 925 F.3d 73, 85 (2d Cir. 2019) (citation and \nquotation marks omitted).  In particular, an inmate raising a constitutional challenge to the medical \ncare provided in detention must establish “(1) that [the inmate] had a serious medical need . . .  and \n(2) that the Defendants acted with deliberate indifference to such needs.”  Id. at 86.  To establish \ndeliberate indifference in the context of an inmate’s medical needs, the inmate had to prove that \nthe defendant failed to provide treatment while having actual or constructive knowledge that doing \nso would pose a substantial risk to the detainee’s health.  Id. at 87. \nBOP’s  significant  efforts  to  mitigate  infections  at  FCI  Danbury  do  not  “shock  the \ncontemporary conscience” as required for the Petitioners to succeed on their constitutional claims.  \nId. at 85.  “To the contrary, the Bureau of Prison is by all objective accounts responding to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic as any reasonable observer could expect under the circumstances to prevent \n63 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 75 of 88\ninfectious outbreak, protect inmate health, and preserve internal order – all legitimate government \naims.”  United States v. Villegas, 2020 WL 1649520, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 3, 2020) (slip op).   \nThe condition complained of here is not the existence of COVID-19, which is not under \nthe control of the BOP, or of FCI Danbury.  Rather, the condition complained of is the precautions \nBOP and FCI Danbury have taken to reduce exposure to or the spread of COVID-19.   The BOP \nand FCI Danbury are acutely aware of the risk that COVID-19 poses to its inmate population and \nto the public at large, and Respondents can hardly be said to be indifferent, as shown by their \nactions as set forth above.   \nIn March, when Seattle, Washington was the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, the \ncourt noted that “[p]laintiffs do not cite to authority, and the court is aware of none, under which \nthe  fact  of  detention  itself  becomes  an  ‘excessive’  condition  solely  due  to  the  risk  of  a \ncommunicable disease outbreak—even one as serious as COVID-19.”  Dawson v. Asher, No. C20-\n0409 (JRL-MAT), 2020 WL 1304557, at *2 (W.D. Wa. Mar. 19, 2020).  Similarly, Petitioners \ncannot establish that the precautions and care at FCI Danbury are “sure or very likely” to lead to \nexposure or that that Respondents have been deliberately indifferent to this novel infectious disease \nwhich took the nation by storm.  The district court in Money, 2020 WL 1820660, reached the same \nconclusion on similar facts.  After finding that prison officials came forward “with a lengthy list \nof the actions they have taken to protect . . . inmates,” id. at *18, the court recognized that prison \nofficials in that case (like FCI Danbury staff here) “are trying, very hard, to protect inmates against \nthe virus and to treat those who have contracted it.”  Id.  There is no evidence to “support any \nsuggestion that [prison officials] have turned a kind of blind eye and deaf ear to a known problem \nthat would indicate ‘total unconcern’ for the inmates’ welfare.”  Id. (quoting Rosario v. Brown, \n670 F.3d 816, 821 (7th Cir. 2012)).  Similarly, in United States v. Desage, No. 2:13-CR-00039 \n64 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 76 of 88\n(JAD-VCF), 2020 WL 1904584, at *3 (D. Nev. Apr. 17, 2020), defendant alleged that the BOP’s \nCOVID-19 protections for inmates were insufficient, and that he was at risk of being exposed to \nthe life-threatening virus.  In denying his release, the court found such claims to be “hyperbole,” \nand found that the information the government provided about its plan, procedures and practices \nin general, and for the defendant in particular, demonstrated a lack of deliberate indifference, and \ndenied defendant’s emergency motion for compassionate release.  Id.    \nIn reviewing Petitioners claims, and considering the actions that Respondents have taken, \nand continue to take, to combat COVID-19 and to keep inmates and staff alike from contracting \nthe virus, this Court should find that Petitioners have failed to demonstrate deliberate indifference, \nand that Respondents’ actions, in fact, demonstrate a lack of deliberate indifference. \nWhile Petitioners may ultimately disagree with the measures taken by the BOP to protect \nand treat inmate health and safety while also carrying out its mission to effectuate criminal \nsentences imposed by federal courts, deliberate indifference is not shown simply by a difference \nof medical judgment.  See Hill v. Curcione, 657 F.3d 116, 123 (2d Cir. 2011) (“a prisoner does not \nhave the right to choose his medical treatment as long as he receives adequate treatment.”); Victor \nv. Milicevic, 361 F. App’x 212, 215 (2d Cir. 2010) (fact that a prisoner might prefer different \ntreatment does not give rise to Constitutional violation) (internal quotation marks and citations \nomitted); Scott v. Benson, 742 F.3d 335, 340 (8th Cir. 2014) (holding that a “mere difference of \nopinion over matters of expert medical judgment or a course of medical treatment fail[s] to rise to \nthe level of a constitutional violation”); Perkins v. Kan. Dep’t of Corr., 165 F.3d 803, 811 (10th \nCir. 1999) (“[A] prisoner who merely disagrees with a diagnosis or a prescribed course of treatment \ndoes  not  state  a  constitutional  violation.”).    Indeed,  a  prisoner  must  prove  more  than  “an \ninadvertent failure to provide adequate medical care,”  Estelle, 429 U.S. at 105, or a mere \n65 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 77 of 88\n“disagreement[ ] between [himself] and [his] doctors about the proper course of [his] medical \ntreatment,” Kosilek, 774 F.3d at 83.  Regarding the latter, it is well established that the Eighth \nAmendment “does not impose upon prison administrators a duty to provide care . . . of the \nprisoner’s choosing.”  Id. at 82 (citing Ferranti v. Moran, 618 F.2d 888, 891 (1st Cir. 1980)).   \nIn the midst of this extraordinary emergency, “[i]t is no part of the function of a court or a \njury to determine which one of two modes was likely to be the most effective for the protection of \nthe public against disease.”  Jacobson v. Comm. of Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 30 (1905).  Rather, \npublic health officials are entitled to heightened deference when exercising science-based public \nhealth judgment during a public health emergency.  See, e.g., United States ex rel. Siegel v. \nShinnick, 219 F. Supp. 789, 791 (E.D.N.Y. 1963) (explaining in a habeas matter that “the judgment \nrequired is that of a public health officer and not of a lawyer used to insist on positive evidence to \nsupport action; their task is to measure risk to the public.  They deal in a terrible context and the \nconsequences of mistaken indulgence can be irretrievably tragic.”); Hickox v. Christie, 205 F. \nSupp. 3d 579, 594 (D.N.J. 2016) (“To permit these constitutional claims to go forward . . . would \nbe a judicial second-guessing of the discretionary judgments of public health officials acting within \nthe scope of their (and not [the court’s]) expertise.”); see also Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 31 (upholding \nmandatory vaccination law and explaining that such a measure, enacted to protect public health, \nwill not be struck down unless it “has no real or substantial relation to [that goal], or is, beyond all \nquestion, a plain, palpable invasion of rights . . .” secured by the Constitution); Bragdon v. Abbot, \n524 U.S. 624, 650 (1998) (noting that “the views of public health authorities, such as the U.S. \nPublic Health Service, CDC, and the National Institutes of Health, are of special weight and \nauthority”); Sch. Bd. of Nassau Cty., Fla. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 288 (1987) (recognizing that \n“courts normally should defer to the reasonable medical judgments of public health officials”).   \n66 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 78 of 88\nPetitioners ask that this Court second-guess the experts at the BOP during an ongoing and \nuncertain public health crisis, and immediately release a number of inmates into the general public \nor to home confinement.  But Petitioners have failed to show that the BOP’s efforts to prevent the \nPetitioners’ infections with COVID-19, and its provision of medical care to Petitioners should they \nbecome ill, amounts to deliberate indifference to their medical needs.17   Petitioners’ assertions are \noverly  generalized and fail to recognize many  of the implemented policies and procedures \ndiscussed above.  The BOP has taken steps to provide all FCI Danbury inmates with adequate \nmedical care, both with respect to the prevention of infection with COVID-19 as well as the \ntreatment should they become infected with COVID-19.  Petitioners must show that FCI Danbury \nis deliberately indifferent to their medical needs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  See e.g., \nCharles, 925 F.3d at 85-97.  But to the contrary, FCI Danbury has actively responded to the \npandemic and taken steps to prevent its spread and isolate infected inmates.  The BOP and FCI \nDanbury have not been deliberately indifferent to the needs of FCI Danbury inmates.   \n                                                \n17 Multiple courts in this circuit agree and have denied requests for compassionate release and bail \napplications by inmates housed by the BOP with medical concerns complaining of their conditions of \nconfinement as grounds for release.  See, e.g., United States v. Carpenter, No. 19-70, 2020 WL 1909098, \nat *1 (2d Cir. Mar. 25, 2020) (affirming denial of inmate’s motion for bail so that he can stay isolated at \nhome until the risk of COVID-19 in prison decreases, finding that his “medical situation is not significantly \ndifferent from that of most inmates.”); United States v. Passley, No. 19 Cr. 534, 2020 WL 1815834, at *1, \n*4 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 9, 2020) (denying defendant’s motion seeking a temporary order of pre-trial release on \na secured bond, finding that his compromised immune system does not merit release); United States v. \nDeutsch, No. 18 Cr. 00502, 2020 WL 1694358, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2020) (denying defendant’s motion \nfor temporary release, explaining that defendant “does not have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, he does not \nsuffer from any pre-existing respiratory issues, he is young, and his medical condition [-- diabetes --] \nappears well managed throughout his pretrial detention.”); United States v. Amato, No. 19 Cr. 442 (ILG), \nDoc. 254 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2020) (Court had already determined defendant was a danger to the \ncommunity and declining to release defendant based on COVID-19 pandemic for 54-year-old who cited \npoor health and family history); United States v. Lipsky, No. 19 Cr. 203 (NGG) (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2020), \nDkt. Entry dated Apr. 21, 2020 (declining to release defendant, previously detained as a danger to the \ncommunity, based on general risks of COVID-19 pandemic). \n \n67 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 79 of 88\nFor the reasons set forth above, Respondents respectfully submit that it is beyond the \npurview of this Court to second-guess BOP officials’ judgment, and the medical judgments made \nwithin the BOP, or for this Court to delve within the daily operation of the BOP or FCI Danbury.  \nIn light of all of the measure taken by the BOP, and by FCI Danbury, Petitioners’ claims fail to \nstate  an  Eighth  Amendment  claim  of  deliberate  indifference  to  Petitioners’  medical  needs.  \nWithout an adequate constitutional violation supported by the pleadings, Petitioners’ claims cannot \nwithstand judgment.  Thus, this Court should deny the Petition, and dismiss Petitioners’ claims in \ntheir entirety. \nVIII.  THE PETITIONERS’ CONCLUSORY PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION \nALLEGATIONS MUST BE STRICKEN \nThe Second Circuit has recognized that Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \ndoes not apply to habeas corpus proceedings.  United States ex rel. Sero v. Preiser, 506 F.2d 1115, \n1125 (2d Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 921 (1975) (concluding that “the class action device \nshould not be imported into collateral actions, at least in its full vigor as contemplated by Rule \n23”).  In Presier, the Second Circuit held that “multi-party [habeas] actions” may nevertheless be \nappropriate in “unusual” cases where there is a “compelling justification” for such an action.  Id.  \nRepresentative habeas actions must meet the requirements of Rule 23 and be “uncluttered by \nsubsidiary issues,” and even then, “more stringent standards may be appropriate in deciding \nwhether a habeas action presents substantial and common questions of law or fact.” Id. at 1126-\n27.  For instance, in Presier, the Court considered a proposed habeas corpus class action brought \nby young adult misdemeanants (ages 16 to 21), on behalf of themselves and all others similarly \nsituated, who were serving a reformatory sentence in excess of the adult penalty for the same \nmisdemeanor.  Id. at 1119.  The petitioners in Presier alleged this correctional scheme violated the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Id.  The Second Circuit found a habeas \n68 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 80 of 88\nrepresentative action was appropriate in those unique circumstances because the alleged facts were \n“relatively uncomplicated” and “the complaint of the representative parties in this suit states a clear \nand unitary allegation on behalf of all young adult misdemeanants.”  Id. 1120.  The Presier court \nalso found “persuasive justifications” for the class action device, including that the individual \npetitions of the class would “present[] the identical issue” and that it was “not improbable that \nmore than a few [of the more than 500 members of the class]  would otherwise never receive the \nrelief here sought on their behalf” because many of them were “likely to be illiterate or poorly \neducated” and would not have the benefit of counsel.  Id. at 1126.   \nThis case is unlike Presier and unsuited to proceed as a representative habeas action.  The \nhabeas petitions of all the inmates in Petitioners’ various classes would not present one “identical,” \n“clear  and  unitary  allegation”  that  is  “uncluttered  by  subsidiary  issues”  and  “relatively \nuncomplicated.”  See id. at 1120, 1125-27.  To the contrary, the decision to release or transfer an \ninmate from FCI Danbury is an inherently individualized determination that must be made by the \njudge presiding over the detainee’s criminal proceeding.  These determinations turn not on a single \nlegal issue common to all inmates, but on each inmate’s unique circumstances, including projected \nrelease dates, disciplinary histories, medical histories, bases for judicially imposed criminal \nsentences, and bases for judicial findings of dangerousness to the community and risk of flight.  \nMoreover, Petitioners have not shown “compelling justifications” for a multi-party representative \naction, or that the existing procedures in place for inmates to seek release or transfer are not \navailable or working or will not work in the future. \n Nor  do  Petitioners’  putative  class  or  subclasses  meet  the  requirements  of  Rule  23, \nincluding  ascertainability,  commonality,  or  typicality,  which  they  must  for  a  Presier-like \nrepresentative action to be appropriate.  First, the proposed class is not ascertainable.  The key to \n69 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 81 of 88\nclass certification is defining the class in a way that makes administrative sense.  See Scaggs v. \nNew York State Dep’t of Educ., No. 06-CV-0799 (RRM)(WDW), 2009 WL 890587, at *2 \n(E.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2009).  Although Rule 23 “contains no express requirement regarding \nascertainability, the rule impliedly prohibits certification of a class that is not identifiable by \nreference to objective criteria.”  In re Vitamin C Antitrust Litig., 279 F.R.D. 90, 116 (E.D.N.Y. \n2012).  \nHere, Petitioners seek to represent a class consisting of all current and future inmates at \nFCI Danbury during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic,” which may exceed well over 984 \nindividuals.  Petition ¶ 11.  Petitioners’ putative class is inherently ill-defined, as the putative class \nbecomes a constant moving target.  Because Petitioners have provided no evidence to show that \nthey can meet the requirement of ascertainability, their putative class fails.  See John v. Nat’l Sec. \nFire and Cas. Co., 501 F.3d 443, 445 (5th Cir. 2007) (where apparent from pleadings that there is \nno ascertainable class, court may dismiss the class allegation on the pleadings). \nPetitioners also seek to represent a subclass of inmates defined by Petitioners as consisting \nof \nall individuals in custody at FCI Danbury or who will become in custody at FCI \nDanbury during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic who are aged 50 or over \nand/or who have serious underlying medical conditions that put them at particular \nrisk of serious harm or death from COVID-19, including but not limited to people \nwith respiratory conditions such as chronic lung disease or asthma; people with \nheart disease or other heart conditions; people who are immunocompromised as a \nresult of cancer, HIV/AIDS, or for any other reason; people with chronic liver or \nkidney disease, or renal failure (including hepatitis and dialysis patients); people \nwith  diabetes,  epilepsy,  hypertension,  blood  disorders  (including  sickle  cell \ndisease), or an inherited metabolic disorder; people who have had or are at risk of \nstroke; and people with any condition specifically identified by CDC, currently or \nin the future, as increasing their risk of contracting, having severe illness, and/or \ndying from COVID-19.   \n \nPetition ¶ 12.  While the subclass certainly has more proposed parameters than that of the putative \n70 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 82 of 88\nclass, it is still inherently ill-defined and is a moving target.  Additionally, it clearly goes beyond \nthe “at risk” population defined by the CDC. \nNext, there are no questions of law or fact common to the putative class that are capable of \nclass-wide resolution.  To show commonality, “[w]hat matters . . . is not the raising of common \n‘questions’—even in droves—but, rather, the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate \ncommon answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 \nU.S. 338, 350 (2011) (to satisfy Rule 23(a)(2) each class member’s claim must depend upon a \ncommon contention “of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution—which means that \nthe determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each \none of the claims in one stroke”).  \nIn Money, 2020 WL 1820660, the district court denied class action certification in nearly \nidentical circumstances to the case sub judice.  The district court explained that public interest \n“mandates  individualized  consideration  of  any  inmate’s  suitability  for  release  and  on  what \nconditions, for the safety of the inmate, the inmate’s family, and the public at large.”  Id. at *14.  \nThis is because “[e]ach putative class member comes with a unique situation – different crimes, \nsentences, outdates, disciplinary histories, age, medical history, places of incarceration, proximity \nto infected inmates, availability of a home landing spot, likelihood of transmitting the virus to \nsomeone at home detention, likelihood of violation or recidivism, and danger to the community.”  \nId. at *15.  The district court ruled that this resulted in a lack of commonality because the only \nmatter “apt to drive the resolution of the litigation” was which inmates should be released.  Id. at \n*14 (quoting Wal-mart, 564 U.S. at 350.)   \nHere the identical problem exists.  Petitioners’ putative class, and subclass, are incapable \nof classwide resolution, as they do not account for any of the myriad factors that are left to the \n71 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 83 of 88\ndiscretion of both Article III judges and the BOP in making determinations that are central to \nwhether a particular inmate should be released.  Petitioners’ putative class and subclass seek to \nblend post-sentencing inmates, despite the fact that these inmates have different criminal charges \nor convictions, have different lengths of remaining periods of imprisonment, feature different \ndisciplinary histories, pose different dangers to the community and risks of flight, have different \nages and medical histories, and rely on different resources should they be released from custody.    \nPetitioners even lump together inmates currently sick with COVID-19 with asymptomatic inmates \nand inmates who might have previously been sick and made a full recovery.  There simply is no \ncommonality and typicality  among the  proposed class member other than the fact or their \nincarceration at FCI Danbury. \nMoreover, typicality requires that the named Petitioners’ claims be typical of each other \nand overlap factually and legally in a manner indicative of the claims of unnamed class members.  \nSee Brown v. Kelly, 609 F.3d 467, 475 (2d Cir. 2010).  Petitioners have no basis to allege the unity \nor alignment of interests, either among themselves or with the other members of the proposed \nclass, necessary to meet this requirement.  Simply stated, in light of their widely-varying factual \ncircumstances and procedural postures, Petitioners cannot represent “typical” claims of any single \nclass.  Petitioners’ claims of typicality are, in any event, self-defeating.  For if the claims of the \nnamed Petitioners are typical of the rest of the class, then the defenses to those claims also apply \nclass-wide.  See  Pagan  v.  Abbott  Labs.,  287  F.R.D.  139,  146  (E.D.N.Y.  2012)  (typicality \nrequirement “ensure[s] that the class representative is not subject to a unique defense which could \npotentially become the focus of litigation.”).  For example, Petitioners Cassidy have already filed \nmotions for compassionate release, and either have been denied or the motion is still pending.  \nPetitioner Martinez-Brooks has submitted an administrative claim seeking compassionate release, \n72 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 84 of 88\nbut has not yet filed a motion seeking the same.  Petitioner Madore has not filed either an \nadministrative  claim  seeking  compassionate  release  or  a  motion  for  compassionate  release.  \nPetitioners are inadequate class representatives for these reasons.  See Caridad v. Metro-North \nCommuter R.R., 191 F.3d 283, 291 (2d Cir. 1999).   \nFinally, even assuming Petitioners’ proposed classes satisfied all four requirements of Rule \n23(a), Rule 23(b)(2) would be a sticking point for class certification.  Rule 23(b)(2) allows for \nclass certification where “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that \napply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief . . . is appropriate respecting the class as \na whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  But Rule 23(b)(2) “applies only when a single injunction or \ndeclaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class,” not “when each individual \nclass member would be entitled to a different injunction.”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360.   Here, the \ndecision to release or transfer a detainee from FCI Danbury is an inherently individualized process \nthat is not amenable to class-wide resolution in a single injunction, as this Court appears to have \nrecognized in its May 3, 2020 Order.  See Docket No. 20 (noting that Petitioners’ “requested relief \nincludes ‘bail,’ ‘enlargement,’ or ‘release’ and [] such relief ordinarily requires the assessment of \nthe individual circumstances of the applicant”).   \nIndividualized proceedings are required for the writs of habeas corpus that the Petitioners \nseek because, among other reasons, the PLRA applies in this case.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(2) \n(the PLRA applies to any “civil action with respect to prison conditions” including any action \n“with respect to the conditions of confinement”); see also Jones, 720 F.3d at 145, n. 3 (the PLRA \ndoes not apply to “habeas petition[s] seeking to overturn a criminal conviction or sentence” but \npresumably applies to conditions of confinement habeas claims brought under Section 2241).  \nUnder the PLRA, in tailoring any prospective or preliminary injunctive relief “in any civil action \n73 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 85 of 88\nwith respect to prison conditions,” a court must “give substantial weight to any adverse impact on \npublic safety,” among other considerations.  18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A), (a)(2).  This mandate \nprecludes any class-wide injunctive relief in the form of bail, enlargement or release.  Mays is \ninstructive.  –- F. 3d –-, 2020 WL 1987007, at *20.  The district court in Mays denied certification \nof a subclass of medically vulnerable to COVID-19 prisoners under nearly identical circumstances, \nholding that Sections 3626(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2) of the PLRA precluded class-wide under Rule \n23(b)(2).  The Mays court correctly explained that, to fulfill the “PLRA’s mandate that a court \n‘give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety’ before issuing preliminary \ninjunctive or prospective relief,” under 18 U.S.C. §§  3626(a)(1)(A), (a)(2), “the Court would need \nto consider the circumstances of the detained persons and any threat they pose to public safety, \nwhich plainly would vary from one person to another.  This is a process that would render the \n[Petitioners’ 28 U.S.C. § 2241 habeas claims based on conditions of confinement] unsuitable to \ncertification under Rule 23(b)(2) or its analogy for representative actions.”  Id. at *20.18   \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should strike the class action allegations because it is \nclear from the Petition itself that the requirements for maintaining a class action cannot be met.   \nSee Johnson v. Connecticut Dept. of Admin. Serv., No. 3:11-cv-1106 (VLB), 2012 WL 414996, at \n*2 (D. Conn. Feb. 9, 2012).   \nIX.  CONCLUSION \nThe BOP is taking significant and ongoing steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at FCI \nDanbury and to provide medical care and treatment for inmates who do become infected.  The \n                                                \n18 Even if the PLRA did not apply to petitioners’ habeas corpus claims, the public interest—which \nmust be taken into account when considering a TRO or preliminary injunction—mandates individualized \nconsideration of any inmate’s suitability for release and on what conditions, for the safety of the inmate, \nthe inmate’s family, and the public at large.  See Money, 2020 WL 1820660, at *14. \n74 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 86 of 88\nBOP and FCI  Danbury have taken the COVID-19 pandemic extremely seriously  and have \nimplemented numerous measures to proactively combat the spread of this disease to staff members \nand the inmate population.  The various phases of the BOP’s Action Plan have been designed and \nimplemented in a systemic manner both nationally and at FCI Danbury in order to mitigate the \nspread of COVID-19.  Id.  The BOP and FCI Danbury remain flexible in their ability to receive \nguidance from the CDC and other health organizations and to modify their actions to best respond \nto this pandemic, according to the quickly shifting needs on the ground.   \nFor these reasons, Petitioners cannot demonstrate that the BOP, or FCI Danbury, has acted \nwith deliberate indifference and their constitutional claims under the Eighth Amendment must fail.  \nMoreover, the release of thousands or hundreds of prisoners by this Court is neither permitted by \nlaw, nor would it serve the health and safety of the inmates or the general public.  Therefore, this \nCourt must deny the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, deny class certification in this case, and \ndeny Petitioners’ motions for a temporary restraining order, injunctive relief and declaratory \njudgment.  \nRespondents request that the Court dismiss the Petition in its entirety pursuant to Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 12(b)(1) or, alternatively, 12(b)(6).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n75 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-1   Filed 05/05/20   Page 87 of 88\n \n              Respectfully Submitted \n \n              Respondents \n              By Their Attorneys \n \n              John H.

The current \nsituation is challenging for us all, but I have great confidence in the ability of the Bureau of Prisons \n(BOP) to perform its critical mission during these difficult times.  We have some of the best-run \nprisons in the world and I am confident in our ability to keep inmates in our prisons as safe as \npossible from the pandemic currently sweeping across the globe.  At the same time, there are some \nat-risk inmates who are non-violent and pose minimal likelihood of recidivism and who might be \nsafer serving their sentences in home confinement rather than in BOP facilities.  I am issuing this \nMemorandum to ensure that we utilize home confinement, where appropriate, to protect the health \nand safety of BOP personnel and the people in our custody. \nI.  TRANSFER  OF  INMATES  TO  HOME  CONFINEMENT  WHERE \nAPPROPRIATE TO DECREASE THE RISKS TO THEIR HEAL TH \nOne of BO P's tools to manage the prison population and keep inmates safe is the ability to \ngrant certain eligible prisoners home confinement in certain circumstances.  I am hereby directing \nyou to prioritize the use of your various statutory authorities to grant home confinement for inmates \nseeking transfer in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  Many inmates will be safer \nin BOP facilities where the population is controlled and there is ready access to doctors and \nmedical care.  But for some eligible  inmates, home confinement might be  more effective in \nprotecting their health. \nIn  assessing  which  inmates  should  be  granted  home  confinement  pursuant  to  this \nMemorandum, you are to consider the totality of circumstances for each individual inmate, the \nstatutory  requirements  for  home  confinement,  and  the  following  non-exhaustive  list  of \ndiscretionary factors: \n•  The age and vulnerability of the inmate to COVID-19, in accordance with the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines; \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-2   Filed 05/05/20   Page 46 of 54\nMemorandum from the Attorney General  Page 2 \nSubject: Prioritization of Home Confinement As Appropriate in Response to COVID-19 \nPandemic \n•  The security level  of the facility currently holding the inmate, with priority given to \ninmates residing in low and minimum security facilities; \n•  The inmate's conduct in prison, with inmates who have engaged in violent or gang \nrelated activity in prison or who have incurred a BOP violation within the last year not \nreceiving priority treatment under this Memorandum; \n•  The  inmate's  score  under  PATTERN,  with  inmates  who  have  anything  above  a \nminimum score not receiving priority treatment under this Memorandum; \n•  Whether the inmate has a demonstrated and verifiable re-entry plan that will prevent \nrecidivism and maximize public safety, including verification that the conditions under \nwhich the inmate would  be  confined  upon release would  present a  lower risk  of \ncontracting COVID-19 than the inmate would face in his or her BOP facility; \n•  The inmate's crime of conviction, and assessment of the danger posed by the inmate to \nthe community.  Some offenses, such as sex offenses, will render an inmate ineligible \nfor  home  detention.  Other  serious  offenses  should  weigh  more  heavily  against \nconsideration for home detention. \nIn addition to considering these factors, before granting any inmate discretionary release, \nthe BOP Medical Director, or someone he designates, will, based on CDC guidance, make an \nassessment of the inmate's risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness, risks of COVID-19 at the \ninmate's prison facility, as well as the risks of COVID-19 at the location in which the imnate seeks \nhome confinement.  We should not grant home confinement to inmates when doing so is likely to \nincrease their risk of contracting COVID-19.  You should grant home confinement only when BOP \nhas determined-based on the totality of the circumstances for each  individual  inmate- that \ntransfer to home confinement is likely not to increase the inmate's risk of contracting COVID-19. \nII.  PROTECTING THE PUBLIC \nWhile we have an obligation to protect BOP personnel and the people in BOP custody, we \nalso have an obligation to protect the public.  That means we cannot take any risk of transferring \ninmates to home confinement that will contribute to the spread of COVID-19, or put the public at \nrisk in other ways.  I am therefore directing you to place any inmate to whom you grant home \nconfinement in a mandatory 14-day quarantine period before that inmate is discharged from a BOP \nfacility to home confinement.  Inmates transferred to home confinement under this prioritized \nprocess should also be subject to location monitoring services and, where a court order is entered, \nbe subject to supervised release. \nWe must do the best we can to minimize the risk of COVID-19 to those in our custody, \nwhile also minimizing the risk to the public.  I thank you for your service to the country and \nassistance in implementing this Memorandum. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-2   Filed 05/05/20   Page 47 of 54\nEXHIBIT E\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-2   Filed 05/05/20   Page 48 of 54\n(@fffre of t~e Attarntt! (irnrrul \n1'a1tJtiugtnn, 'ID. QI. 205:30 \nApril 3, 2020 \nMEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR OF BUREAU OF PRISONS \nFROM:  THE ATTORNEY GENERA~~ \nSUBJECT:  Increasing Use of Home Confinement at Institutions Most Affected by \nCOVID-19 \nThe mission of BOP is  to  administer the lawful punishments that our justice system \nimposes.  Executing that mission imposes on us a profound obligation to protect the health and \nsafety of all inmates. \nLast week, I directed the Bureau of Prisons to prioritize the use of home confinement as a \ntool for combatting the dangers that COVID-19 poses to our vulnerable inmates, while ensuring \nwe successfully discharge our duty to protect the public. I applaud the substantial steps you have \nalready  taken on that  front  with respect to  the  vulnerable inmates who qualified for  home \nconfinement under the pre-CARES Act standards. \nAs you know, we are experiencing significant levels of infection at several of our facilities, \nincluding FCI Oakdale, FCI Danbury, and FCI Elkton.  We have to move with dispatch in using \nhome confinement, where appropriate, to move vulnerable inmates out of these institutions.  I \nwould like you to give priority to these institutions, and others similarly affected, as you continue \nto process the remaining inmates who are eligible for home confinement under pre-CARES Act \nstandards.  In addition, the CARES Act now authorizes me to expand the cohort of inmates who \ncan be considered for home release upon my finding that emergency conditions are materially \naffecting the functioning of the Bureau of Prisons.  I hereby make that finding and direct that, as \ndetailed below, you give priority in implementing these new standards to the most vulnerable \ninmates at the most affected facilities, consistent.with the guidance below. \nI.  IMMEDIATELY  MAXIMIZE  APPROPRIATE  TRANSFERS  TO  HOME \nCONFINEMENT OF ALL APPROPRIATE INMATES HELD AT FCI OAKDALE, \nFCI DANBURY, FCI ELKTON, AND AT OTHER SIMILARLY SITUATED BOP \nFACILITIES WHERE COVID-19 IS MATERIALLY AFFECTING OPERATIONS \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-2   Filed 05/05/20   Page 49 of 54\nMemorandum from the Attorney General  Page 2 \nSubject: Increasing Use of Home Confinement at Institutions Most Affected by COVID-19 \nWhile BOP  has taken extensive precautions to prevent COVID-19 from entering its \nfacilities and infecting our inmates, those precautions, like any precautions, have not been perfectly \nsuccessful at all institutions.  I am therefore directing you to immediately review all inmates who \nhave COVID-19 risk factors, as established by the CDC, starting with the inmates incarcerated at \nFCI Oakdale, FCI Danbury, FCI Elkton, and similarly situated facilities where you determine that \nCOVID-19 is materially affecting operations.  You should begin implementing this directive \nimmediately at the facilities I have specifically identified and any other facilities facing similarly \nserious problems. And now that I have exercised my authority under the CARES Act, your review \nshould include all at-risk inmates-not only those who were previously eligible for transfer. \nFor all inmates whom  you deem suitable candidates for home confinement, you are \ndirected to immediately process them for transfer and then immediately transfer them following a \n14-day quarantine at an appropriate BOP facility, or, in appropriate cases subject to your case-by \ncase discretion, in the residence to which the inmate is being transferred.  It is vital that we not \ninadvertently contribute to the spread of COVID-19 by transferring inmates from our facilities. \nYour assessment  of these  inmates  should  thus  be  guided  by  the  factors  in  my  March 26 \nMemorandum, understanding, though, that inmates with a suitable confinement plan will generally \nbe appropriate candidates for home confinement rather than continued detention at institutions in \nwhich COVID-19 is materially affecting their operations. \nI also recognize that BOP has limited resources to monitor inmates on home confinement \nand that the U.S. Probation Office is unable to monitor large numbers of inmates in the community. \nI therefore authorize BOP to transfer inmates to home confinement even if electronic monitoring \nis not available, so long as BOP determines in every such instance that doing so is appropriate and \nconsistent with our obligation to protect public safety. \nGiven the speed with which this disease has spread through the general public, it is clear \nthat time is of the essence.  Please implement this Memorandum as quickly as possible and keep \nme closely apprised of your progress. \nII.  PROTECTING THE PUBLIC \nWhile we have a solemn obligation to protect the people in BOP custody, we also have an \nobligation to protect the public. That means we cannot simply release prison populations en masse \nonto the streets.  Doing so would pose profound risks to  the public from released prisoners \nengaging in additional criminal activity, potentially including violence or heinous sex offenses. \nThat risk is particularly acute as we combat the current pandemic. Police forces are facing \nthe same daunting challenges in protecting the p1;1blic that we face in protecting our inmates.  It is \nimpossible to engage in social distancing, hand washing, and other recommend steps in the middle \nof arresting a violent criminal.  It is thus no surprise that many of our police officers have fallen \nill with COVID-19, with some even dying in the line of duty from the disease. This pandemic has \ndramatically increased the already substantial risks facing the men and women who keep us safe, \nat the same time that it has winnowed their ranks while officers recover from getting sick, or self \nquarantine to avoid possibly spreading the disease. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 24-2   Filed 05/05/20   Page 50 of 54\nMemorandum from the Attorney General  Page 3 \nSubject: Increasing Use of Home Confinement at Institutions Most Affected by COVID-19 \nThe  last  thing  our  massively  over-burdened  police  forces  need  right  now  is  the \nindiscriminate release of thousands of prisoners onto the streets without any verification that those \nprisoners will follow the laws when they are released, that they have a safe place to go where they \nwill not be mingling with their old criminal associates, and that they will not return to their old \nways as soon as they walk through the prison gates.  Thus, while I am directing you to maximize \nthe use of home confinement at affected institutions, it is essential that you continue making the \ncareful, individualized determinations BOP makes in the typical case.  Each inmate is unique and \neach requires the same individualized determinations we have always made in this context. \nI believe strongly that we should do everything we can to protect the inmates in our care, \nbut that we must do so in a careful and individualized way that remains faithful to our duty to \nprotect the public and the law enforcement officers who protect us all. \n\nCase

The Court will promptly \nschedule an initial telephonic status conference with the parties once the \nRespondents have filed their response; the purpose of the conference, \nwhich the Court will endeavor to hold within 36 hours of the filing of the \nresponse, will be to discuss the nature and timing of the hearing the \nCourt should hold to adjudicate the petition and any other issues raised \nin the parties' papers, including but not limited to whether the Court \nshould require Respondents promptly to identify members of the \n\nSubclass defined in the Petition, as requested in the Motion for Order to \nShow Cause.

(Entered: \n05/04/2020) \n05/03/2020  20   ORDER: Nothing in this order should be taken as any indication about \nhow the Court will rule on the petition or motion for temporary \nrestraining order/preliminary injunction. The Government must file its \nresponses to the order to show cause and the motion for temporary \nrestraining order/preliminary injunction by 6pm on May 5, 2020. (The \ntime was inadvertently omitted from the Court's previous order.) The \nparties shall be prepared to argue the motion for temporary restraining \norder/preliminary injunction at the telephonic hearing scheduled for 1pm \non May 6. To facilitate preparation for that argument, and to facilitate \nany relief the Court might order after the argument and/or after further \nproceedings, the parties shall be prepared to discuss the following legal \nand factual issues. To the extent these questions can only be answered by \nthe Government, Government counsel shall make diligent efforts before \nthe call to obtain answers: \n \n1. Do the provisions of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3626 apply to this case, i.e., is this \na \"civil action with respect to prison conditions\"? Relatedly, is the relief \npetitioners are seeking a \"prisoner release order\"? See 18 U.S.C. Sec. \n3626(g)(2),(4). \n \n2. Although the Second Circuit has \"conclude[d] that the class action \n\ndevice should not be imported into collateral actions, as least in its full \nvigor as contemplated by Rule 23,\" it has recognized \"the power of the \njudiciary... to fashion for habeas actions appropriate modes of procedure, \nby analogy to existing rules or otherwise in conformity with judicial \nusage.\" U.S. ex rel. Sero v. Preiser, 506 F.2d 1115, 1125 (2d Cir. 1974). \nIn Preiser, the court allowed \"a multi-party proceeding similar to the \nclass action\" on behalf of young adults serving misdemeanor sentences, \nbecause \"many of those serving reformatory sentences are likely to be \nilliterate or poorly educated,\" \"most would not have the benefit of \ncounsel to prepare habeas corpus petitions,\" and \"considerable \nexpenditure of judicial time and energy in hearing and deciding \nnumerous individual petitions presenting the identical issue is thereby \navoided.\" Id. at 1126; see also id. at 1127 (\"And although we believe that \nmore stringent standards may be appropriate in deciding whether a \nhabeas action presents substantial and common questions of law or fact, \nit is apparent that the complaint of the representative parties in this suit \nstates a clear and unitary allegation on behalf of all young adult \nmisdemeanants.\"). To what extent does this habeas petition satisfy these \ncriteria for \"a multi-party proceeding similar to the class action,\" given \nthat the requested relief includes \"bail,\" \"enlargement,\" or \"release\" and \nthat such relief ordinarily requires the assessment of the individual \ncircumstances of the applicant, cf. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3142(g)(3) (directing \nthe court to consider, among other things, \"the history and characteristics \nof the person\" when making release determinations)? \n \n3. What is the current population and capacity of each of the three \nfacilities at FCI Danbury? \n \n4. What is the availability of extra space that might be outfitted for living \nor quarantine space at each of the three facilities? \n \n5. For each of the three facilities at Danbury FCI, how many written \nrequests based on the circumstances presented by COVID-19 have been \nmade for temporary release, home confinement, or compassionate \nrelease (under 18 U.S.C. Secs. 3622, 3624, 3582(c)(1)(A), the CARES \nAct, or any other authority)? And for each facility, (1) how many such \nrequests have been granted either by the BOP or by the Court, and (2) \nhow many inmates have actually been released - whether it be to home \nconfinement, a half-way house, or otherwise? \n \n6. Which of the named petitioners have sought the relief in paragraph 5, \nwhat types of relief have been sought, and what is the status of any \nrequests/motions? (The Court will ask this question first of Petitioners' \ncounsel.) \n \n7. How long would it take the Warden to respond to a court order \n\nrequiring the production of a list of all inmates at each of the three \nfacilities falling within the subclass defined by the petitioners or an \nalternative subclass based on the CDC's guidance as to vulnerable \npersons, see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-\nprecautions/people-at-higher-risk.html? \n \nThis is not a comprehensive list of the questions the Court will ask. \nCounsel should be prepared on all issues raised in their papers. \n \nSigned by Judge Michael P.

For the reasons discussed during today's call, the Court hereby \namends the Temporary Restraining Order entered on May 12, \n2020, see ECF No. 30 at 68-73, as follows: \n \n(1) Paragraph 1f is amended to read as follows: \"Respondent shall \nprovide the list to Petitioners' counsel, and the list shall be marked \n'Confidential Attorneys' Eyes Only' and be treated accordingly under the \nProtective Order entered in this case, ECF No. 9, except that Petitioners' \ncounsel may also disclose information on the list pertaining to a \nparticular inmate to (a) that inmate and/or (b) that inmate's representative \n(either the inmate's family member or his/her attorney). To be clear, \nPetitioners counsel may not disclose information pertaining to one \ninmate to another inmate or another inmate's representative.\" \n \n(2) The Court nunc pro tunc amends the Temporary Restraining Order \nand Ruling (ECF No. 30) to indicate that it has considered whether to \nrequire the Petitioners to give security under Rule 65(c) and has \nconcluded that, because they are indigent and because of the nature of \n\nthe case, the amount of security is set at $0. \n \nWith regard to the discussion on the call concerning the Connecticut \nSupreme Court's decision in Byrne v. Avery Center for Obstetrics and \nGynecology, P.C., 327 Conn. 540 (2018), the Court does not find that \nthat decision, or the Connecticut statute or HIPAA regulations cited \ntherein, is an obstacle to amending the Temporary Restraining Order \nfurther to require that the list of inmates in the Medically Vulnerable \nSubclass include ICD codes. The Byrne decision suggests, and the \nstatute and HIPAA regulations make clear, that a disclosure made in \nresponse to a court order, as opposed to a subpoena issued by a litigant, \nwould not expose the person subject to the court order to liability. \nNonetheless, as Respondents asked to file a proposed order on this point, \nthe Court will await making further amendments to the temporary \nrestraining order until the Respondents file the proposed language, \nprovided they do so promptly. \n \nAs discussed, by close of business on Tuesday, May 19, 2020, the \nparties are directed to submit a joint proposal regarding the format and \nlogistics of the preliminary injunction hearing, including whether any \npart of the proceeding should be conducted in the courtroom. The Court \nwill issue a further order regarding the hearing after it receives this input \nfrom the parties. \n \nSigned by Judge Michael P. Shea on 5/14/2020.

The Court held a telephonic status conference today to discuss \nissues related to the Respondent's compliance with the Court's TRO, \nECF No. 30. During the call, the Petitioners indicated that they knew of \nmultiple individuals who qualified as medically vulnerable under \nParagraph 1 of the TRO (which references CDC criteria), but who were \nnot included on the list of medically vulnerable inmates that Respondent \nused to select inmates for prioritized review for home confinement, as \nrequired by the TRO. Petitioners indicate that they believe that additional \nsearches are necessary to identify additional medically vulnerable \ninmates they believe to be present at FCI Danbury who are not on the \ncurrent list. The Respondent indicated a willingness to conduct a further \nsearch to identify additional medically vulnerable inmates, although the \nRespondent took the position that the Petitioners' proposed search \nparameters were overbroad. Given that additional searches are likely \nnecessary to identify all of the medically vulnerable inmates at FCI \nDanbury for prioritized home confinement review (as required by \nParagraphs 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the TRO), that further additional time will be \nnecessary to review those inmates for home confinement, and that \nfurther inquiry is necessary to determine whether the Respondent has \notherwise fully complied with the TRO, the Court finds that there is \ngood cause under Rule 65(b)(2) to extend the temporary restraining order \nby 14 days, through June 9, 2020. \n \nAs discussed during today's call, the parties shall meet and confer \nregarding the most effective and efficient process for identifying as many \nof the remaining medically vulnerable inmates at FCI Danbury as \npossible. The parties should also discuss whether and how a person with \nmedical expertise should be involved in the home confinement review \nprocess, in light of the requirement under the TRO that the Respondent \nassign substantial weight to an inmate's COVID-19 risk factors in the \nreview process. The parties shall file a status report regarding their \ndiscussions by close of business on May 27. The Court will hold a \ntelephonic status conference on May 28, 2020 at 11:00 a.m. to discuss \nthese issues. \n \nAs further discussed, the Respondent shall also file a notice by close of \nbusiness on May 27, under seal, indicating the release status of each of \nthe 26 inmates that have been approved for home confinement. \n \n\nSigned by Judge Michael P.

The Court will hold a telephonic conference with counsel, \ntoday, at 5pm, to discuss this issue with the parties. The Court will \ncirculate dial-in information shortly. Before the call, counsel should \nreview the following authorities, and any others that may be \npertinent: U.S. v. Charmer Indus., Inc., 711 F.2d 1164, 1176 (2d Cir. \n1983); D. Conn. L. Crim. Rule 32(i),(k); U.S. Dept of Justice v. Julian, \n486 U.S. 1 (1988) and its progeny, see, e.g., US v. Pugh, 69 Fed. Appx. \n628 (4th Cir. 2003). \n \nSigned by Judge Michael P. Shea on 6/5/2020. (Karpman, Michael) \n(Entered: 06/05/2020) \n06/05/2020  81   ORDER. For the reasons discussed on the call (and the Court may issue \na short, further explanatory ruling in the future), the parties are ordered \nto meet and confer to develop a form of release that would allow inmates \nidentified in the sample group to choose whether or not to disclose their \npresentence reports to Petitioners' counsel in this action. Under the \nSupreme Court's decision in U.S. Dept. of Justice v. Julian, 486 U.S. 1 \n(1988), it is clear that an inmate has the right under the FOIA to obtain \nhis or her own presentence report, and thus also to authorize its \ndisclosure to Petitioners' counsel--who seek to represent a class of \ninmates including the inmates in the sample--so that Petitioners' counsel \ncan pursue the inmate's interests in this case. In light of the important \nprivate and public interests at issue in this case, and the apparent role of \nthese presentence reports in the Respondent's decisionmaking process, \nPetitioners' have made a compelling demonstration that disclosure, in the \nmanner described above, is necessary to meet the ends of justice. The \nrelease form should indicate that any presentence reports disclosed to \nPetitioners' counsel under these authorizations will be treated with strict \nconfidentiality, and, more specifically, will be disclosed only to \nPetitioners' counsel, Petitioners' counsel's expert witness, Respondent's \ncounsel, Respondent's counsel's expert witness, and the Court. Should \ninmates in the sample authorize such disclosure, the Respondents shall \nproduce the presentence reports of such inmates to Petitioners' counsel. \n \nPetitioners' request to obtain inmates' Statements of Reasons is denied \nfor the reasons discussed on the call. \n \nIn addition, for the reasons discussed on the call, the Respondent shall \n\nproduce to Petitioners' counsel the names of the inmates who were in the \ngroup of an estimated 159 inmates (referred to in the Warden's \ndeclaration, ECF No. 24-2 at 23) who were reviewed for home \nconfinement between March 26 and May 5, 2020. \n \nFurther, as discussed, Petitioners shall file a Rule 21 motion to add \nparties by June 9, 2020. \n \nSigned by Judge Michael P.

(Attachments: \n# 1 Envelope)(Payton, R.) (Entered: 10/01/2020) \n09/30/2020  230   ORDER: On September 18, 2020, the Court approved the class \nsettlement following a fairness hearing. (ECF No. 221.) In light of the \nCourt's approval of the settlement and its findings at the hearing, it \ndisposes of the remaining pending motions in this case as follows: The \nmotion for preliminary injunction (ECF No. 14) and motion for sanctions \n(ECF No. 83) are DENIED in light of the settlement and releases and the \nCourt's findings at the fairness hearing. The emergency motion to \nintervene (and for other relief) by Andrew Mackey (ECF No. 114) is \nDENIED, because, to the extent Mr. Mackey is or will in the future \nbecome a member of the class, the Court already considered his interests \nat the fairness hearing, and to the extent he is not, he is not so situated \nthat disposing of the action in his absence will impair or impede his \nability to protect his interests; he also does not sufficiently share a \ncommon question of law or fact with the class members given that the \nCourt made no determination in this case (even a preliminary \ndetermination by way of temporary restraining order) regarding the \nclaims of non-class members. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 24, to the extent it \n\napplies in a habeas proceeding. The interest of judicial economy would \nnot be furthered by adjudicating his claims as part of this case. Mr. \nMackey is free, of course, to bring his own independent action seeking \nwhatever relief he deems appropriate. (Forms for self-represented parties \nare available on the Court's website.) The emergency motion to intervene \nand motion to amend emergency motion to intervene by Bernice Mackey \n(ECF Nos. 146 & 159) is DENIED for the same reasons, and because \nshe likely lacks standing to join this habeas proceeding. The motion to \nintervene by Deric Twitty (ECF No. 203) is DENIED for the same \nreasons as those recited in the denial of Mr. Mackey's motion; as for Mr. \nTwitty's objection to the settlement, the Court considered it and similar \nobjections before approving the settlement at the fairness hearing. The \nmotion to amend the complaint (ECF No. 208) is DENIED because it \nwas not filed by class counsel, who are the only authorized \nrepresentatives of the class, the only recognized plaintiffs in this action. \nFurther, to the extent Mr. Wallace is making objections to the settlement, \nthe Court considered those and similar objections before approving the \nsettlement at the fairness hearing; and to the extent he is not a member of \nthe class, he remains free to bring his own action. The motions to \nintervene by Mr. Jackson (ECF Nos. 209 & 210) are DENIED for \nsimilar reasons, i.e., to the extent he is a member of the class, the Court \nconsidered his interests at the fairness hearing; to the extent he is not, he \nis free to bring his own action and he does not satisfy Rule 24 for the \nreasons set forth above with respect to Mr. Mackey; and to the extent he \nis stating objections to the settlement, the Court considered those and \nother similar objections before approving the settlement at the fairness \nhearing. The motions for a copy of the settlement agreement (ECF Nos. \n213 & 215) are DENIED, as the Court was advised at the fairness \nhearing by both the defendant and class counsel that the settlement \nagreement had been made available to all inmates in accordance with \nthis Court's previous orders. To the extent the motions also stated \nobjections to the settlement, the Court considered them and others like \nthem before approving the settlement at the fairness hearing. Finally, Mr. \nMackey's emergency motion for bail (ECF No. 225) is DENIED for the \nreasons set forth above with respect to Mr. Mackey; again, Mr. Mackey \nis free to bring his own action at any time. \n \nSigned by Judge Michael P.

In any event, the failure of a party to respond to a \nmotion does not require the court to grant the motion, and it is not a \nsufficient basis to do so when the motion itself is not supported by the \nrelevant legal principles. The motion otherwise fails for reasons \npreviously set forth by the Court in Order No. 230. Again, nothing \nprevents Mr. Mackey from bringing his own lawsuit to the extent he is \nnot a member of the class. \n \nSigned by Judge Michael P. Shea on 10/19/2020. (Super, John) (Entered: \n10/19/2020) \n10/19/2020  241   ORDER.

The terms of the \n\nSettlement were discussed at length by the Court during a fairness \nhearing that preceded the Settlement's approval. (ECF Nos. 222-223.) On \nOctober 12, 2020, the parties jointly moved for an order of dismissal. \n(ECF No. 238). In accordance with the terms of the Settlement, and \npursuant to Fed. R. Civ.

(Entered: 12/14/2020) \n12/14/2020  294   ORDER: The Court has been advised that there has been a complication \nregarding the release of Ms. Hechtman, one of the 17 inmates who was \npreviously approved by the BOP for home confinement and was the \nsubject of the Courts December 11, 2020 order. Specifically, the Court \nwas advised by Respondent's counsel that one of the persons at whose \nhome Ms. Hechtman was proposing to stay has refused to host her. \nDuring a conference call with counsel today, Petitioner's counsel \nrepresented that, in light of the apparently increasing spread of COVID-\n19 at FCI Danbury, she would be willing to host Ms. Hechtman in a safe \nspace at her home in the New Haven area on a furlough (see 18 U.S.C. \nSec. 3622) while another home confinement or other appropriate release \nplan is vetted and approved by the BOP. Accordingly, consistent with its \nDecember 11, 2020 order, to provide for specific performance of the \nSettlement Agreement, and for reasons that will be more fully explained \n\nin a forthcoming opinion, the Court hereby orders the Respondent to \nrelease Ms. Hechtman to the care of Attorney Sarah Russell, as a 30-day \nfurlough, beginning as soon as Attorney Russell or Sean McElligott \narrives at FCI Danbury to pick up Ms. Hechtman. During the 30-day \nfurlough, the Respondent shall make it a top priority to vet and approve \nan appropriate home or community confinement plan for Ms. Hechtman. \nIn the event that Respondent is unable to do so, however, Ms. Hechtman \nshall return to FCI Danbury no later than the 30th day following her \nrelease. At all times, Ms. Hechtman's sentence will remain intact and she \nwill remain subject to the authority of the Bureau of Prisons. \n \nSigned by Judge Michael P. Shea on 12/14/2020.

The Court received a motion for transfer to home confinement \nfrom Michael Milchin. (ECF No. 306). Mr. Milchin's 306 motion is \nhereby DENIED because all such filings on behalf of petitioner or the \nclass must be made by class counsel. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(a) (\"Every \npleading, written motion, and other paper must be signed by at least one \nattorney of record in the attorney's name--or by a party personally if the \nparty is unrepresented.\"). Thus, if Mr. Milchin is a member of the class, \nas he asserts, the motion must be filed by class counsel; if he is not a \nmember of the class, then he would not have standing to file this motion. \nMr. Milchin's motion also does not comply with the settlement \nagreement's dispute resolution provision, which provides a multi-tiered \napproach to resolving any dispute prior to seeking judicial review.

Banks \nis currently an inmate at FCI Oakdale and previously filed a pro se \nmotion to extend certain orders from Whitted v. Easter (3:20-cv-569-\nMPS) to the inmates at FCI Oakdale, located in Louisiana. I returned \nBanks' submission to him with an order that provided as follows: \n\"Generally, under § 2241, a prisoner challenging his confinement must \nfile his petition in his district of confinement. Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 \nU.S. 426, 443 (2004). Likewise, under the statute's jurisdiction of \n\nconfinement rule, district courts may only grant habeas relief against \ncustodians 'within their respective jurisdictions.' 28 U.S.C § 2241(a). \nBecause FCI Oakdale is not within the District of Connecticut, I do not \nhave jurisdiction to grant habeas relief to you or other inmates housed at \nFCI Oakdale under section 2241.\" Banks' reliance, for jurisdictional \npurposes, on the transfer of former FCI Danbury inmates to FCI Oakdale \nis misplaced. Banks does not indicate that he was ever confined at FCI \nDanbury, and he provides no basis for the Court to exercise jurisdiction \nover his motion to join Whitted v. Easter, a case that has settled and was \nclosed as of October 20, 2020. \n \nSigned by Judge Michael P. Shea on 2/11/2021.

That city, within the New York City \nmetropolitan area, is part of the epicenter of our nation’s struggle with the novel COVID-19 \nvirus and resulting coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”). \nAs COVID-19 ravages the New York Metropolitan area, the risks posed by COVID-19 to \npeople confined in prisons, working in prison, and their communities are stark and alarming. For \nreasons beyond their control, people in jails and prisons cannot practice social distancing, control \ntheir exposure to large groups, practice increased hygiene, wear protective clothing, obtain \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 2 of 71\n \nspecific products for cleaning or laundry, avoid high-touch surfaces, or sanitize their own \nenvironment. And those problems are no more evident than at FCI Danbury, a prison consisting \nof a men’s low security complex, a women’s low-security satellite facility, and a women’s \nminimum security satellite facility, which has been one of the hardest hit prisons run by the \nFederal Bureau of Prisons nationwide. \nPetitioners bring this action against the Warden of FCI Danbury and the Director of the \nFederal Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) on behalf of themselves and the class of prisoners held at \nFCI Danbury who are at imminent risk of contracting COVID-19, which feeds on precisely the \nunsafe, congregate conditions in which they are held. Respondents are aware of the grave \ndangers posed by COVID-19 and have failed to implement measures to comply with their \nconstitutional obligations to those in their custody. Because of their unlawful and \nunconstitutional confinement, Petitioners seek emergency orders requiring a two-part response, \nthe immediate transfer of the most medically vulnerable individuals to home confinement or \nother appropriate settings and immediate implementation for those who remain of the social \ndistancing and hygiene measures essential to lowering the risk of the disease and of death.  \nPARTIES \n1.  Petitioner Dianthe Martinez-Brooks, BOP Register Number 71331-050, is a 50 \nyear-old woman who, at all times relevant herein has been in the custody of the BOP at FCI \nDanbury, and is currently housed in FCI Danbury’s women’s minimum-security camp (the \n“camp”). Ms. Martinez-Brooks suffers from systematic lupus erythematosus, an inflammatory \nautoimmune disease of the connective tissue, for which she takes corticosteroids that has resulted \nin her being immunocompromised. Ms. Martinez-Brooks also suffers from asthma and \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 71\n \nhypertension. All three of those diagnosed medical conditions place Ms. Martinez-Brooks at \nsignificantly heightened risk of severe illness or death in the event she becomes infected with \nCOVID-19. \n2.  Petitioner Rejeanne Collier, BOP Register Number 21263-05, is a 64 year-old \nwoman who, at all times relevant herein, has been in the custody of the BOP at FCI Danbury, \nand is currently housed in FCI Danbury’s women’s minimum security camp. Ms. Collier is at \nheightened risk of mortality from COVID-19 because she suffers from lupus and hypertension \nand, while in custody, she has been treated for both intestinal cancer and a spot on her lung. She \nalso suffers from hepatitis C and hypertension.  \n3.  Petitioner Jackie Madore, BOP Register Number 08721-036, is a 50 year-old \nwoman who, at all times relevant herein, has been in the custody of the BOP at FCI Danbury, \nand is currently housed in the low security satellite facility (“FSL”). She transferred to that \nbuilding to participate in the Residential Drug Abuse Program (RDAP), which is currently \nsuspended. Ms. Madore is at heightened risk of mortality from COVID-19 due to hypertension. \nShe also suffers from hypothyroidism, and hepatitis C. \n4.  Petitioner Kenneth Cassidy, BOP Register Number 48169-054, is a 54 year-old \nman who, at all times relevant herein, has been in the custody of the BOP at FCI Danbury, and is \ncurrently housed in FCI Danbury’s men’s facility. Mr. Cassidy has significant cardiovascular \nissues, including ischemic heart disease, unstable angina, and hypertension. He has suffered three \nheart attacks. He has chronic bronchial asthma and other respiratory problems which have \nresulted in multiple bouts of pneumonia.  He is also morbidly obese. Each of these conditions \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 71\n \nplaces Mr. Cassidy at dramatically heightened risk of death from COVID-19; the combination of \nall these conditions creates exponential danger. \n5.  Respondent D. Easter is the Warden at FCI Danbury and has oversight \nresponsibility for all three units in the facility. As Warden of FCI Danbury, Respondent Easter is \nresponsible for and oversees all day-to-day activity at FCI Danbury, and all aspects of the \noperation and of the functioning of FCI Danbury. Her responsibilities include ensuring the safety \nof all in the institution and ensuring the orderly running of the institution. Respondent Easter is \naware of the harms of COVID-19, but she has adopted and enforced a policy that leaves \nPetitioners and all those similarly situated exposed to infection, severe illness, and death due to \nCOVID-19. Respondent Easter is the immediate physical custodian responsible for the detention \nof the Petitioners at FCI Danbury. She is sued in her official capacity. \n6.  Respondent Michael Carvajal is the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons \nand, in that capacity, is responsible for the safety and security of all persons, including \nPetitioners and all proposed Class Members, serving federal sentences at BOP facilities, \nincluding FCI Danbury. He is sued in his official capacity. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 because \nPetitioners seek relief from being held in custody in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution. \n8.  In addition, the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this Petition pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question) in that the Petitioners’ claims arise under the federal statute \nproviding for habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. § 2241, and under Article I, § 9, cl. 2 of the U.S. \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 5 of 71\n \nConstitution (Suspension Clause), as Petitioners are held in violation of the Eighth Amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution.   \n9.  Venue is proper in the District of Connecticut pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) \nbecause a substantial part of the events and omissions giving rise to these claims occurred and \ncontinue to occur in this district. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n10.  Petitioners bring this representative habeas action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 \nand as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on their own \nbehalf and on behalf of all persons similarly situated. \n11.  Petitioners seek to represent a class consisting of all individuals currently in \ncustody at FCI Danbury or who will become in custody at FCI Danbury during the course of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic (the “Class”). \n12.  Petitioners also seek to represent a subclass (the “Subclass”) consisting of all \nindividuals in custody at FCI Danbury or who will become in custody at FCI Danbury during the \ncourse of the COVID-19 pandemic who are aged 50 or over and/or who have serious underlying \nmedical conditions that put them at particular risk of serious harm or death from COVID-19, \nincluding but not limited to people with respiratory conditions such as chronic lung disease or \nasthma; people with heart disease or other heart conditions; people who are \nimmunocompromised as a result of cancer, HIV/AIDS, or for any other reason; people with \nchronic liver or kidney disease, or renal failure (including hepatitis and dialysis patients); people \nwith diabetes, epilepsy, hypertension, blood disorders (including sickle cell disease), or an \ninherited metabolic disorder; people who have had or are at risk of stroke; and people with any \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 6 of 71\n \ncondition specifically identified by CDC, currently or in the future, as increasing their risk of \ncontracting, having severe illness, and/or dying from COVID-19. \n13.  The members of the Class and Subclass are too numerous to be joined in one \naction, and their joinder is impracticable. Upon information and belief, the class exceeds 1,000 \nindividuals. \n14.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all Class and Subclass members and \npredominate over questions that affect only the individual members. These common questions of \nfact and law include but are not limited to: (1) whether the conditions of confinement described \nin this Petition amount to Constitutional violations; (2) what measures Respondents took in \nresponse to the COVID-19 crisis; (3) whether Respondents implemented an adequate emergency \nplan during the COVID-19 crisis; (4) whether Respondents’ practices during the COVID-19 \ncrisis exposed people at FCI Danbury to a substantial risk of serious harm; (5) whether the \nRespondents knew of and disregarded a substantial risk of serious harm to the safety and health \nof the Class; and (6) what relief should be awarded to redress the harms threatened to members \nof the Class as a result of the conditions. \n15.  Absent class certification, individuals detained at FCI Danbury during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic would face a series of barriers in accessing the relief sought. FCI Danbury \nhas suspended visitation and FCI Danbury prisoners have limited access to communication with \nthe outside world, impeding their ability to obtain legal representation and to pursue remedies, \nincluding through litigation. A large portion of the Class and Subclass has limited educational \nbackgrounds. And a significant percent of them suffer from physical or mental impairments. For \nsome, English is not their first language. \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 7 of 71\n \n16.  Respondents’ practices and the claims alleged in this Petition are common to all \nmembers of the Class and Subclass. \n17.  The claims of Petitioners are typical of those of the Class and Subclass. \nPetitioners are threatened with imminent inhumane conditions of confinement at FCI Danbury. \n18.  The legal claims of Petitioners are the same or similar to those of all Class and \nSubclass members, and the harms suffered by them are typical of those suffered by all the other \nClass members. \n19.  Petitioners will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class and \nSubclass. The interests of Petitioners as class representatives are consistent with those of the \nClass and Subclass members. In addition, counsel for Petitioners are experienced in class action \nand civil rights litigation. \n20.  Counsel for Petitioners know of no conflicts of interest among Class or Subclass \nmembers or between the attorneys and Class members that would affect this litigation. \n21.  Prosecuting separate actions by individual class members would create a risk of \ninconsistent or varying adjudications that could establish incompatible standards of conduct for \nthe party opposing the Class.  \n22.  The party opposing the Class has acted and refused to act on grounds generally \napplication to the Class, such that final injunctive and declaratory relief is appropriate as to the \nClass as a whole. \n23.  Use of the class action mechanism is superior to other available methods for the \nfair and efficient adjudication of the claims and will prevent the imposition of undue financial, \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 8 of 71\n \nadministrative, and procedural burdens on the parties and on this Court, which individual \nlitigation of these claims would impose. \n24.  This class action is superior to any other method for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this legal dispute, as joinder of all Class and Subclass members is impracticable. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nI.  Petitioners Are Members of the Population Particularly Vulnerable to COVID-19 \n \n25.  Petitioners, current detained at FCI Danbury, are individuals who are particularly \nvulnerable to serious illness or death if infected by COVID-19. \n26.  Petitioner Dianthe Martinez-Brooks is a 50-year-old female who suffers from \nasthma, hypertension, arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). She takes Atenolol for \nhypertension and has a Proventil emergency inhaler and Asmanex Twisthaler (mometasone \nfuroate inhalation powder, 220 mg) for her asthma. Since her incarceration, she has been \nproscribed steroids once for the joint and muscle inflammation associated with her lupus.   \n[Declaration of Dianthe Martinez-Brooks, submitted herewith as Exhibit C (“Martinez-Brooks \nDecl.”) ¶ 2]. \n27.  As a result of her medical condition, Ms. Martinez-Brooks has effectively been \ncondemned to serve her sentence at substantial risk of serious illness or death. As a result of her \nhypertension, Ms. Martinez-Brooks is significantly more vulnerable to complications should she \ncontract COVID-19. Indeed, the WHO-China Joint Mission Report provided historical mortality \nrates for those who contracted COVID-19 with specific pre-existing conditions. For those with \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 9 of 71\n \nhypertension, the mortality rate was 8.4%.1 That same report indicates that the mortality rate for \nchronic respiratory disease such as asthma was 8.0%. Id. \n28.  As a lupus patient, Ms. Martinez-Brooks is also at greater risk from COVID-19 in \ntwo respects. As with other lupus patients, Ms. Martinez-Brooks has been prescribed \ncorticosteroids which weaken the immune system and render the patient immunocompromised. \nBoth that compromised immune system and lupus itself are risk factors for an increased chance \nof infection and for the development of a more severe form of COVID-19.2   \n29.  Although the Judgment in her criminal case only sentences Ms. Martinez-Brooks \nto an additional two years in prison [Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 3], as a result of her medical \ncondition there is a grave risk that she will not make it out of FCI Danbury alive or will become \nterribly ill.  \n30.  Petitioner Rejeanne Collier is a 64-year-old female who suffers from systemic \nlupus erythematosus (SLE), hypertension and Hepatitis C. She has had surgery for intestinal \ncancer while in BOP custody and has been diagnosed with a spot on her lung. See Motion to \nReduce Sentence, United States v. Collier, 6:12-cr-06003-CJS (N.D.N.Y. Apr. 16, 2020) (Doc. \n64 at 13). As set forth above, these conditions condemn her to serve a sentence at substantial risk \n                                                 \n1 See Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), World \nHealth Organization (Feb. 28, 2020), at 12, https://www.who.int/docs/default-\nsource/coronaviruse/whochina-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf (hereinafter “WHO-China Joint \nMission Report”).  \n2 See People who are at higher risk, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Coronavirus \nDisease 2019 (COVID-19) (Apr. 15, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-\nprecautions/people-at-higher-risk.html; Amr H. Sawalha et al, Epigenetic dysregulation of ACE2 and \ninterferon-regulated genes might suggest increased COVID-19 susceptibility and severity in lupus \npatients, Clinical Immunology (2020): 108410, \nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521661620302394 (“propos[ing] that lupus patients \nmight be at an increased risk for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and for developing a more severe form of \nCOVID-19, independent of the possible effect of immunosuppressive medications”). \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 10 of 71\n \nof serious illness or death.  The mortality rate for COVID-19 with pre-existing hypertension is \n8.4%; for cancer, the mortality rate is 7.6%.3 She is also at significantly greater risk as a result of \nher lupus. To the extent that the as yet incompletely diagnosed spot on her lung represents either \nlung cancer or some other form of respiratory compromise, that condition will also place her at \nsubstantially elevated risk of significant illness or death in the event she contracts coronavirus. \nThe Judgment in her criminal case sentences Ms. Collier to an additional four years in prison. As \na result of her medical condition there is a grave risk that she will not make it out of FCI \nDanbury alive or will become terribly ill.  \n31.  Petitioner Jackie Madore is a 50-year-old female who suffers from hypertension, \nhypothyroidism, and Hepatitis C. As a result of her hypertension alone, without consideration of \nthe complicating effects of her other conditions, she has a substantially elevated risk of severe \nillness or mortality in the event she contracts COVID-19 while confined at FCI Danbury.4 As a \nresult of her medical condition, Ms. Madore has effectively been condemned to serve her \nsentence at substantial risk of serious illness or death. The Judgment in her criminal case only \nsentences Ms. Madore to an additional 20 months in prison. As a result of his medical condition, \nthere is a grave risk that he will not make it out of FCI Danbury alive or will become terribly ill.  \n32.  Petitioner Kenneth Cassidy is a 54-year-old male with a significant number of risk \nfactors putting him at high risk of severe illness or death in the event he contracts COVID-19.  \nMr. Cassidy has significant cardiovascular issues, including ischemic heart disease (i.e., deficient \nblood supply from a narrowing of the blood vessels), unstable angina, and hypertension. He has \nsuffered three heart attacks, including two in his thirties. He has chronic bronchial asthma and \n                                                 \n3 See WHO-China Joint Mission Report at 12. \n4 See id.    \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 11 of 71\n \nother respiratory problems which have resulted in his having contracted pneumonia at least 21 \ntimes in his life. He also has chronic gastrointestinal and gastroesophageal disease including \ndiverticulosis and he is morbidly obese. He suffers significant food allergies and is on a restricted \ndiet as a result of his diverticulosis. He is on numerous different medications/interventions for \nthese conditions.   \n33.  As a result of his medical condition, Mr. Cassidy has effectively been condemned \nto serve his sentence at substantial risk of serious illness or death. Pursuant to the above-cited \nWHO-China Joint Mission Report, each of these conditions puts Mr. Cassidy at significantly \nelevated risk of mortality in the event he should contract COVID-19: The mortality rate for \nhypertension is 8.4%; the mortality rate for chronic respiratory disease is 8.0%, the mortality rate \nfor cardiovascular disease is 13.2%.5 Moreover, a recent study found that obesity was the single \nbiggest chronic risk factor for hospitalization for COVID-19.6 COVID-19 infection in a patient \npresenting with all four medical conditions will undoubtedly be deadly.7  \n34.  The Judgment in his criminal case only sentences Mr. Cassidy to an additional 11 \nmonths in prison.

As a result of his medical condition, there is a grave risk that he will not make it \nout of FCI Danbury alive or will become terribly ill. \nII.  The Layout of the Facilities at FCI Danbury Gives Rise to an Urgent Need for Social \nDistancing that Remains Unmet More than Six Weeks into the National COVID-19 \nPandemic \n   \n  A.  Physical Layout of FCI Danbury’s Three Facilities \n \n35.  As of April 23, 2020, the BOP reports that 1,046 people were held at FCI \nDanbury. They were divided among the units as follows: 165 women are incarcerated at the \nsatellite prison, 153 women are incarcerated at the camp, and 728 men are incarcerated at the \nmen’s prison.8 \n1.  Women’s FSL \n36.  The women in the satellite facility (“FSL”) are housed in a single dormitory-style \nroom that accommodates approximately 160-170 beds. [Declaration of Christina Korbe, \nsubmitted herewith as Exhibit E (“Korbe Decl.”) ¶ 8]. The room is divided into cubicles, each \ncontaining two bunk beds, separated by approximately four feet. [Declaration of Marius (Marie) \nMason, submitted herewith as Exhibit F (“Mason Decl.”) ¶ 7; Declaration of Kimberly \nHoisington, submitted herewith as Exhibit G (“Hoisington Decl.”) ¶ 4]. Beds in each cubicle are \nimmediately adjacent to the cubicle wall, which does not reach to the ceiling. In some instances \nthe wall does not even reach the top of the bunk bed, so women on the top bunk sleep right next \nto the woman on the top bunk in the adjacent cubicle. [Mason Decl. ¶ 7; Korbe Decl. ¶ 10]. \n                                                 \n8  See BOP, “Population Statistics” (last updated Apr. 23, 2020), \nhttps://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/population_statistics.jsp  \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 13 of 71\n \na.  All of the women in the FSL share the same three bathrooms, each of which \nincludes between 4-8 toilets, sinks, and showers. [Mason Decl. ¶ 10; Korbe Decl. \n¶ 8].  \nb.  The FSL also includes a common area where the women have access to 6-12 \nshared phones (not all of which are working) and 6 shared computers (only 4 of \nwhich are working), which are located in close proximity to one another. [Korbe \nDecl. ¶ 11; Mason Decl. ¶8]. \nc.  The women in the FSL eat meals together in the dormitory. Meals are brought to \nall of the prisoners in the dormitory at the same time.  \nd.  On April 25, around 40 women were moved from the dorm area to sleep in the \ndining hall/kitchen area.  \ne.  On information and belief, there is no medical staff permanently assigned to the \nFSL or available 24 hours a day. A doctor and a physician’s assistant rotate \nbetween the three FCI Danbury facilities and are there during limited hours on \nweekdays. In order to request medical care, a requester must go to “pill call” in \nthe morning, where a pharmacy technician dispenses medications, and fill out a \nsick call slip. The requester must then wait until she is called in to be seen, which \ncan take weeks. Emergencies require a call from a correctional officer for a \nmedical professional to come to the FSL. Prior to the pandemic, there were two \npsychologists who were at the FSL on a daily basis, but they have rarely been \npresent since the pandemic (as psychology programming has been canceled).    \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 14 of 71\n \n2.  Women’s Camp \n37.  The women at the camp occupy a single building divided into four dormitories, \neach containing 25 cubicles with bunk beds sleeping two each, and nine rooms that can each \nhold 4 to 5 women. Prior to the lockdown of the facility on April 15, there were approximately \n43 women housed in the nine rooms. After the lockdown, those women were moved to the \ndormitories. [Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶¶ 4-5]. \na.  The cubicles in the dormitories—which currently house all of the women in the \ncamp—have no doors and their dividing walls do not extend to the ceilings. In \nmany cubicles, the beds are positioned perpendicular to the partitions and extend \nthe full width of the cubicle. In this configuration, the partition is the only \nseparation between the beds. Even where beds are placed parallel to the partition, \nthere is not six feet of separation between them. [Id. ¶ 7]. \nb.  As of April 21, 2020, A and B dorms each house 48 women; C dorm houses 47 \nwomen and D Dorm houses 7. Each dorm has a common area containing toilets, \nsinks and showers. A dorm has 4 showers and three toilets. B dorm has 5 working \ntoilets and 6 showers; C dorm has 5 toilets and 5 showers. D Dorm has 3 toilets \nand three showers.  [Id. ¶¶ 6-7]. \nc.  There are four phones, 7 computers for email, and 3 working video-visiting \nmachines, clustered together in a single common area shared by the entire \npopulation of the camp. The common area also contains hot water taps and sinks \nfor washing dishes. [Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 9]. \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 15 of 71\n \na.  The camp is currently on lockdown. Pursuant to the lockdown, the women in each \ndorm unit are permitted to leave the dorm for 45 minutes in the morning and one \nhour later in the day, at different times. They can use the facilities in the common \nroom during these times. Within these short time periods, the 47-48 woman \ncensus of A, B, and C dorm must each negotiate the sharing of the four common \nphones, the 7 computers and 3 video chat machines. [Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ \n11]. \nb.  Recently, women who are out of their dorm during their designated recreation \ntime have been going to visit friends in other dorms. [Martinez-Brooks Decl., ¶ \n15]. \nd.  There is no actual medical clinic in the camp and there is no medical staff \npermanently assigned to the camp or available 24 hours a day. Rather, there are a \nseries of offices: two are used by medical staff, one by dental staff, and one by \npsychology. During this lockdown, a sick call request is made to physician’s \nassistants when they come to the unit in the morning to dispense medications and \nthe requester must wait until she is called in—often days later.  Emergencies \nrequire a call from a correctional officer for a medical professional to come to the \ncamp.  [Id. ¶ 21]. \n3.  Men’s Prison \n38.  The men’s facility contains 13 units, comprised of 10 units designed for \ndormitory-style housing and three units of individual cells. There is also a Special Housing Unit \nfor solitary confinement.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 16 of 71\n \na.  The dormitory units (designated C through L Units) consist of rows of bunk beds \nlined in two rows three to four feet apart across a middle aisle, with no barriers \nbetween the beds.  [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 32]. A man in that unit would, therefore, sleep \nwithin 3-4 feet of five other men. [Id.]. The average dorm unit would also contain \na bathroom with 5 stalls and a urinal, 5-6 sinks (generally consisting of five cold-\nwater wash sinks and a single hot-water slop sink for washing eating utensils) and \na shower area approximately two feet across a hall from the toilets with three to \nfour showers. [Id. ¶ 33]. The sinks are located approximately four inches apart \nand people occasionally have to share the same sink.  [Id.]. \nb.  The dorms also contain 2 television rooms, approximately 10 x 12 feet that can \naccommodate approximately 20 prisoners each and typically hold 15-20 people at \na time.  [Id. ¶ 35]. There is also a small telephone room, approximately 3 x 8 feet, \ncontaining two telephones. The telephones, which are about eight inches apart, are \nalmost always in use. When two prisoners are using the telephones, they have to \nstand within two feet of each other. Typically, there are two prisoners on the \nphones, and the rest wait in a line in the hallway, standing right next to each other, \nclose enough to touch each other. [Id. ¶ 36]. \nc.  There is also a small computer room in each dorm measuring approximately 8 x \n10 feet containing three computers, an eating table and an ice dispenser. There are \nno barriers between the computers and, at any given time, there will be three \npeople in the room using the computers, three people standing behind them in the \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 17 of 71\n \nroom waiting to use the computers, and several more lined up shoulder to \nshoulder outside the room. [Id. ¶ 37]. \nd.  The three units of individual cells (A, B and M Units) consist of two floors of \ncells measuring 8 x 4 feet, containing a bunk bed for two men with a toilet/sink.  \n[Declaration of Rafael Almonte, submitted herewith as Exhibit H (“Almonte \nDecl.”), ¶ 6]. Prior to the emergence of COVID-19 in the facility, only one of the \ncell block units (M Unit) was in use and housed primarily military veterans, older \nmen and those with serious medical conditions. A second cellblock (A Unit) has \nsince been devoted to prisoners who are positive for coronavirus.  [Almonte Decl. \n¶ 17]. The facility has also activated one of the dorms (K Unit)—which had \npreviously been emptied because of the need for asbestos remediation—to serve \nas an isolation unit at the prison. [Id. ¶ 4; Cassidy Decl. ¶ 42]. B Unit has since \nbeen converted to serve as a quarantine unit for individuals being released or sent \nto home confinement. \ne.  The cellblock units also contain a TV room that can accommodate 30 men who sit \nclose together and a computer room containing 3 stations right next to one \nanother. There are also two small rooms containing one phone each. [Almonte \nDecl. ¶ 8]. \nf.  There is a single medical clinic for men at FCI Danbury. Before the outbreak, it \nwas typically staffed by one physician and two physician assistants. The physician \nfrom the women’s facilities would occasionally come to the men’s prison to see \npatients. [Almonte Decl. ¶ 11]. Since the lockdown, a social worker is coming \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 18 of 71\n \ninto the units to conduct sick call triage of men exhibiting symptoms. [Cassidy \nDecl.  ¶ 18]. At times she brings along the prison’s dental hygienist. [Id.] The \nclinic is not staffed by medical staff 24 hours a day.  \ng.  There is also a dining hall in the men’s prison that serves all of the units in the \nprison. The men’s prison also includes an outdoor space for recreation (“rec \nyard”).  The space is accessed through a single 4 foot wide door and men entering \nand exiting the rec yard must line up in close proximity to file through the door.  \nDuring recreation, prisoners stand right next to one another and are unable to \nobserve social distancing.  [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 29]. \nB.  COVID-19 Outbreak at FCI Danbury  \n39.  FCI Danbury is in the center of the global COVID-19 storm. The United States \ncurrently has the greatest number of infections of any country in the world. As of April 27, 2020, \nthere were approximately 966,000 reported COVID-19 cases and more than 55,000 deaths in the \nUnited States.9 And, the New York City metropolitan area, in which FCI Danbury is located, is \ncurrently at the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in this country. As of April 27, 2020, there \nare over 422,000 positive cases of COVID-19 in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey. As of \nthat date, there have been 30,000 deaths in those three states, representing 55% of the total \nconfirmed deaths from COVID-19 reported nationwide.10 In New York City and the seven \ncounties most proximate to FCI Danbury (Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess and Nassau counties \nin New York and Fairfield, Litchfield and New Haven counties, Connecticut), there were an \naggregate of 242,000 cases of COVID-19 and 21,000 deaths. Id. In Connecticut alone, the \n                                                 \n9  COVID-19 Dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns \nHopkins University (JHU), https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html. \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 19 of 71\n \nConnecticut Department of Public Health (\"DPH\") has reported that, as of April 27, 2020, in \nConnecticut, there were 25,269 confirmed cases and 1,924 deaths attributed to COVID-19.  \nFairfield County, where FCI- Danbury is located has the highest number of confirmed cases of \nCOVID-19 and deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the state: as of April 27, 2020, there were \n10,529 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 707 COVID-19 associated deaths.11  \n40.  FCI Danbury is the site of one of the worst COVID-19 outbreaks at BOP facilities \nnationwide. As of April 15, at least 44 prisoners and 39 staff members have or had tested \npositive for COVID-19.12 One person incarcerated at FCI Danbury has died of COVID-19. On \nApril 24-26, 2020, at least two women from the FSL were brought to the hospital because of \nsevere COVID-19 symptoms. On information and belief, at least ten more women in the FSL \ntested positive during those same days.  \n41.  The incidence rate at Danbury exceeds 2.8% of the total prisoner population at the \nfacility—among the highest concentrations of positive tests per capita of any facility in the \nBureau of Prisons network.   \n42.  The incidence of staff COVID-19 infections at FCI Danbury is likewise, among \nthe highest incidence per capita of staff infections in the BOP system.    \n43.  The BOP reports the number of positive cases for inmates and staff at each \nfacility on its website. But the BOP’s numbers do not include people who previously tested \n                                                                                                                                                             \n10  Id. \n11  See https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Coronavirus/CTDPHCOVID19summary4232020.pdf?la=en  \n12 See Laura Cassels, COVID-19 deaths in federal prisons rise to 15; about 700 staff and inmates \nsick, Phoenix, April 15, 2020, https://www.floridaphoenix.com/2020/04/15/covid-19-deaths-in-federal-\nprisons-rise-to-15-about-700-staff-and-inmates-sick/     \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 20 of 71\n \npositive for COVID-19 and have since been deemed recovered by BOP.13 The BOP provides no \nexplanation as to what qualifies as “recovery.” \n44.  BOP’s data does not state where the incarcerated people who tested positive have \nbeen housed, and who may have been exposed to staff members who have tested positive.   \n45.  As set forth in detail below, see paragraphs 131-141, there is ample evidence to \nindicate that FCI Danbury appears to be avoiding testing prisoners who present with symptoms \nof COVID-19 infection. \n46.  COVID-19 is at Danbury and individuals are infected. What cannot be known is \nhow many currently have the infection or exposure. In the absence of any information from the \nBOP about the number of tests actually administered at FCI Danbury and the criteria employed \nat that institution to determine whether and when to perform COVID-19 testing, no reliable \ninformation is public about the degree to which the infection has spread at FCI Danbury. \n47.  Respondents have failed to prioritize medically vulnerable prisoners for release to \nhome confinement or to other destinations appropriate to reduce population density at FCI \nDanbury and enhance opportunities for social distancing.   \n48.  On information and belief, Respondents have also reversed prior determinations \nto release medically vulnerable individuals pursuant to de-densification efforts and have advised \nmedically-vulnerable individuals who had previously been notified that they were to be released \nto home confinement that they are no longer eligible for such release because they had not \ncompleted one-half of their sentences.  \n49.  Further, on information and belief, FCI Danbury has indefinitely suspended the \nadministrative remedy process; staff informed prisoners that, due to the state of emergency under \n                                                 \n13 Federal Bureau of Prisons, https://www.b2op0. gov/coronavirus/  \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 21 of 71\n \nwhich the facility is operating, staff are unavailable to review, investigate and respond to \ngrievances. [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 25]. \n50.  FCI Danbury is grossly ill-equipped to identify, monitor, and treat a COVID-19 \nepidemic. The combination of an epidemic striking a facility that houses over 1,000 people and \nFCI Danbury’s inability to provide appropriate medical care under normal circumstances is \nlikely to result in serious illness and death, if people remain confined there at current population \nlevels and under current conditions. \n51.  At current facility population levels, prisoners at FCI Danbury cannot comply \nwith the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) guidelines for physical distancing, \na “cornerstone” of risk reduction in prisons.14 \n52.  As long as prisoners are unable to practice physical distancing, any other \nmitigating steps will fail to decrease meaningfully the risk of COVID-19 infections at FCI \nDanbury. \n53.  The failure to implement appropriate social distancing measures has led to the \ncreation of crisis conditions at FCI Danbury. \n54.  On April 24-26, 2020, several prisoners at the FSL have shared an account of a 43 \nyear-old woman housed at the satellite facility whose serious symptoms, including profuse \n                                                 \n14  See CDC, Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- \n19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities (Mar. 23, 2020), at 4 (“CDC Interim Correctional Facility \nGuidance”) (“Although social distancing is challenging to practice in correctional and detention \nenvironments, it is a cornerstone of reducing transmission of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19”); \nid. (“Social distancing is the practice of increasing the space between individuals and decreasing the \nfrequency of contact to reduce the risk of spreading a disease (ideally to maintain at least 6 feet between \nall individuals, even those who are asymptomatic.”), available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html.  \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 22 of 71\n \nvomiting and dry heaving, over several hours, were disregarded by correctional staff before she \nwas finally taken to the hospital. [See Korbe Decl. ¶¶ 16-17; Hoisington Decl. ¶¶ 16-17].  \na.  The woman at issue had been sick for a couple of weeks with a sore throat and \nbody aches. \nb.  On April 24, she said that she couldn’t breathe and that her lungs felt like they \nwere filling with fluid. She began vomiting, and was vomiting, dry heaving, and \nviolently struggling for air for hours. At one point she had to be wheeled in a \nwheelchair by a correctional officer from the bathroom because she couldn’t \nwalk. \nc.  Other prisoners tried to advocate for her to receive medical treatment and were \ntold that the hospital can’t take her unless she’s dying, and that the prisoners \nwould get disciplinary reports and get locked down if they continued advocating \non her behalf. The prisoners were told that they were not doctors and were \ninstigating the sick woman’s behavior. \nd.  By late at night on April 24 or early morning on April 25, the sick woman had \nbeen taken to the hospital. At the hospital, she tested positive for COVID-19. \ne.  The next day on April 25, roughly 40 inmates who were determined to have had \nrecent contact with the sick prisoner were moved out of the dormitory into a \nseparate area of the facility and were tested for COVID-19. \nf.  On information and belief, at least ten of those inmates tested positive for \nCOVID-19. \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 23 of 71\n \ng.  Thereafter, all of the prisoners who had been removed from the dormitory \nreturned for some time to gather their personal property, use phones and \ncomputers, use bathrooms, and take showers. On information and belief, even \nafter they were removed to isolation, several of these women were able to return \nto the dormitory to gather snacks and other belongings.  \nh.  The phones, computers, and bathrooms were not sanitized immediately \nafterwards. \ni.  The other inmates in the dormitory are using these same phone, computers, and \nbathrooms. \nj.  Some inmates who had contact with the sick woman were not among those \nremoved from the dormitory and are still living there. \nk.  As a result of failure to implement social distancing and to plan for contagion \nwithin the facility, FCI Danbury had no appropriate location to isolate the women \nwho newly-tested positive for COVID-19 and was required to take those women \nto sleep in the dining hall/kitchen. \nl.  Prisoners have been warned that they will get disciplinary reports if they tell \nanyone about what is going on in the facility. A prisoner who relayed information \nabout the sick woman to her attorney via phone was given a disciplinary report for \nsharing information about another prisoner. \n55.  FCI Danbury is undergoing a serious outbreak and worse will likely follow with \ndevastating consequences for Petitioners and other vulnerable prisoners, correctional staff, local \nhealth care workers, their families, and the broader community. \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 24 of 71\n \nIII.  Prisons Are Especially Susceptible to COVID-19 Contagion \n56.  The COVID-19 virus is highly infectious and can be spread “easily and \nsustainably” from person-to-person.15 The virus can live on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 72 \nhours, and, powered by a single cough or sneeze, can be propelled in a gas cloud that extends up \nto 27 feet in length.16 \n57.  To date, the virus is known to spread from person to person through respiratory \ndroplets, close personal contact, and from contact with contaminated surfaces and objects, where \nthe virus can survive for up to three days. Critically, people who are asymptomatic or pre-\nsymptomatic can unknowingly transmit the virus, making it particularly difficult to slow its \nspread.  [Declaration of Jaimie Meyer, M.D. submitted herewith as Exhibit A (“Meyer Decl.”) ¶ \n20]. \n58.  There is no vaccine against COVID-19 and there is no known medication to \nprevent or treat infection from COVID-19. Social distancing, or remaining physically separated \nfrom known or potentially infected individuals, and vigilant hygiene, including washing hands \nwith soap and water, are the only known effective measures for protecting vulnerable people \nfrom COVID-19.   \n59.  As a result, the only assured way to curb the pandemic is through dramatically \nreducing contact for all.

Spaces within jails and prisons are often poorly ventilated; the lack of ventilation \npromotes highly efficient spread of diseases through droplets. [Meyer Decl. ¶ 9]. \n64.  Prisoners and staff interact in close proximity under cramped conditions that are \ndesigned to confine people rather than distance them; as a result, correctional facilities are highly \nsusceptible to rapid transmission of the virus through contact, including asymptomatic carriers \nwho show no signs of illness, and common surfaces. \n65.  Absent significant de-densifying, people who are confined in prisons, jails, and \ndetention centers, as well as staff, will find it impossible to engage in the necessary social \ndistancing and hygiene required to mitigate the risk of transmission.

Correctional settings also increase the risk of contracting and spreading an \ninfectious disease, like COVID-19 because they typically house high numbers of people with \nchronic, often untreated underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, chronic \nlung and liver diseases, asthma, and lower immune systems from HIV. This chronic underlying \nillness, in turn, is often exacerbated by minimal levels of sanitation, limited access of personal \nhygiene, limited access to medical care, and no possibility of staying at a distance from others.22 \n68.  Indeed, outbreaks of the flu regularly occur in prisons, and during the H1N1 \nepidemic in 2009, many jails and prisons dealt with high numbers of cases.23 \n69.  Prisons are not isolated from communities, and infections in prisons give rise to \nthe risk of “community spread.” Even when prison visitors are reduced, staff, contractors and \nvendors go from prisons to communities and can bring infectious diseases into facilities and then \ninto communities. The turnover of prison populations means that people cycle in and out, as well \nas transfer from one facility to another.     \n70.  Such movement creates an ever-present risk that persons, including asymptomatic \ncarriers, will carry the virus into and out of those facilities, spread infection, and trigger \n                                                 \n22 See, e.g., Joseph A.

Evidence of the degree of risk in prisons is mounting. The estimate is that recent \noutbreaks in the Cook County Jail in Chicago and at the Rikers Island Jail in New York are the \nhighest transmission rates for COVID-19 in the world.25 As of April 20, 2020, eight hundred \nNew York City correctional employees had tested positive and eight had died. Including \nprisoners, there have been 10 deaths and more than 1,200 confirmed cases in New York City’s \njails.26 \n72.  In Arkansas, 38% of the positive COVID-19 cases in the state are concentrated in \none prison, which has 850 confirmed cases.27 \n73.  As of April 26, 2020, at least 12,613 people in jails and prisons had tested positive \nfor the illness.28 The number of new cases among prisoners is more than doubling each week.  \n                                                 \n24 See ACLU, COVID-19 Model Finds Nearly 100,000 More Deaths Than Current Estimates, \nDue to Failures to Reduce Jails (April 22, 2020), \nhttps://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/aclu_covid19-jail-report_2020-8_1.pdf \n(epidemiological model indicating that, “as a result of the constant movement between jails and the \nbroader community, our jails will act as vectors for the COVID-19 pandemic in our communities.”). \n25 See Alleen Brown, Inside Rikers: An Account of the Virus-Stricken Jail from a Man Who \nManaged to Get Out, Intercept, April 21 2020, https://theintercept.com/2020/04/21/coronavirus-rikers-\nisland-jail-nyc/; Timothy Williams & Danielle Ivory, Chicago’s Jail Is Top U.S. Hot Spot as Virus \nSpreads Behind Bars, N.Y.

Sixteen prison systems—including the Federal Bureau of Prisons which has \nalready experienced major outbreaks throughout its network—are not releasing information \nabout how many prisoners they are testing.30 Of the rest, only eight systems had tested more than \n400 of the people in their custody by the week beginning April 20, 2020.31 \n75.  Therefore, the data of more than 12,000 people in prison and jails testing positive \nis most likely a significant undercount.  \n76.  In Ohio, mass testing of everyone at the Marion Correctional Institution revealed \n1,828 confirmed cases among prisoners, which represents 73% of the population. One hundred \nand nine staff members at the facility were also positive.32   \nIV.  COVID-19 Infection in the Prison Demographic Is Deadly \n77.  Many incarcerated individuals are at heightened risk of serious illness and death \nfrom COVID-19 because their demographic profile and histories make them part of a cohort that \nis especially vulnerable. People over the age of fifty face greater chances of serious illness or \ndeath from COVID-19. In a February 28, 2020, WHO-China Joint Mission Report, the \npreliminary mortality rate analyses showed that individuals age 60-69 had an overall 3.6% \nmortality rate and those 70-79 years old had an 8% mortality rate.

For individuals age 40-49, the mortality rate was 0.4%, and for \nindividuals 40 years and younger, the mortality rate was 0.2%.33 \n78.  People of any age who suffer from certain underlying medical conditions, \nincluding lung disease, heart disease, chronic liver or kidney disease (including hepatitis and \ndialysis patients), diabetes, epilepsy, hypertension, compromised immune systems (such as from \ncancer, HIV, or autoimmune disease), blood disorders (including sickle cell disease), inherited \nmetabolic disorders, stroke, developmental delay, and asthma, are at elevated risk as well.34  \n79.  The WHO-China Joint Mission Report provides that the mortality rate for those \nwith cardiovascular disease was 13.2%, 9.2% for diabetes, 8.4% for hypertension, 8.0% for \nchronic respiratory disease, and 7.6% for cancer.35 \n80.  In many people, COVID-19 causes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. But for \npeople over the age of fifty or with medical conditions that increase the risk of serious COVID-\n19 infection, shortness of breath can be severe.  \n81.  Most people in higher risk categories who develop serious illness will need \nadvanced medical help and support.

COVID-19 can severely damage lung tissue, which requires an extensive period \nof rehabilitation, and in some cases, can cause a permanent loss of respiratory capacity. COVID-\n19 may also target the heart muscle, causing a medical condition called myocarditis, or \ninflammation of the heart muscle. Myocarditis can affect the heart muscle and electrical system, \nreducing the heart’s ability to pump. This reduction can lead to rapid or abnormal heart rhythms \nin the short term, and long-term heart failure that limits exercise tolerance and the ability to \nwork. \n83.  Emerging evidence also suggests that COVID-19 can trigger an over-response of \nthe immune system, further damaging tissues in a cytokine release syndrome that can result in \nwidespread damage to other organs, including permanent injury to the kidneys and neurologic \ninjury. These complications can manifest at an alarming pace. Patients can show the first \nsymptoms of infection in as little as two days after exposure, and their condition can seriously \ndeteriorate in as little as five days or sooner. \n84.  Even some younger and healthier people who contract COVID-19 are susceptible \nto severe strokes and may require supportive care, which includes supplemental oxygen, positive \npressure ventilation, and in extreme cases, extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation.37 \n                                                 \n36  Kevin McCoy and Katie Wedell, ‘On-the-job emergency training’: Hospitals may run low on \nstaff to run ventilators for coronavirus patients, USA TODAY (Mar. 27, 2020), available at \nhttps://bit.ly/2V7rLsS. \n37 See Young and middle-aged people, barely sick with covid-19, are dying of strokes, WASH \nPOST.

The need for care, including intensive care, and the likelihood of death, is much \nhigher from COVID-19 infection than from influenza. According to recent estimates, the fatality \nrate of people infected with COVID-19 is about ten times higher than a severe seasonal \ninfluenza, even in advanced countries with highly effective health care systems.38 For people in \nthe highest risk populations, the fatality rate of COVID-19 infection is about 15 percent.   \n86.  Most people in high-risk categories who develop serious illness require advanced \nmedical support, including specialized equipment, such as ventilators, and large teams of highly \ntrained care providers, such as ICU doctors, nurses, and respiratory therapists. [Meyer Decl. ¶ \n22]. The artificial ventilation process is itself invasive and dangerous, and some patients must be \nplaced in medically induced comas for such treatment.  \n87.  Given the need for advanced and urgent intervention, often in an ICU \nenvironment, people with severe cases of COVID-19 cannot be shackled or otherwise restrained, \nnor can they be subjected to constant, close supervision by correctional staff, as they would be in \na typical correctional setting.  \n88.  FCI Danbury is not equipped to provide advanced support in an ICU setting with \nventilators, certainly not for a substantial group of seriously ill prisoners who may require such \nspecialized care. \n89.  Patients who do not die from serious cases of COVID-19 may face prolonged \nrecovery periods, including extensive rehabilitation from neurologic damage, amputation due to \n                                                 \n38  Betsy McKay, Coronavirus vs. Flu Which Virus is Deadlier, WALL ST.

Spread of Disease in BOP Facilities Requires De-Densifying and Providing Social \nDistancing for Those Who Remain  \n \n91.  Available statistics reveal a public health disaster erupting across BOP facilities \nthat worsens with each passing day.  \n92.  From March 20 to April 25, confirmed COVID-19 cases among BOP prisoners \nand staff rose from 2 to 1047 across 42 facilities nationwide. \n93.  Severe outbreaks at FCI Oakdale in Louisiana, FCI Elkton in Ohio, and FCI \nButner in North Carolina, already have resulted in dozens of confirmed COVID-19 infections \namong prisoners and staff, many more suspected but unconfirmed cases, and 22 prisoner deaths \nthroughout the system.40 \n                                                 \n39  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of \nPatients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), https://cutt.ly/etRPVRl; Melissa Healy, \nCoronavirus infection may cause lasting damage throughout the body, doctors fear, LA TIMES (Apr. 10, \n2020), available at https://cutt.ly/htNrJ77; see also Di Wu et al., Plasma Metabolomic and Lipidomic \nAlterations Associated with COVID-19, MEDRXIV 2020.04.05.20053819 (2020); Declaration of Dr. \nJonathan Golob, Dawson v.

That surge of COVID-19 cases inside the federal prison system has dwarfed the \nnational percentage increase in confirmed cases over the same time period.41 \n95.  According to CDC guidelines, only two measures are known to be effective in \nreducing the spread of this disease: (1) diligent “social or physical distancing,” which involves \nkeeping at least six feet of space between people to avoid transmission of the virus, and (2) \nvigilant hygiene practices, including frequently washing hands and regularly disinfecting \nsurfaces. Physical distancing is a necessary predicate for hygiene practices to have any \nmeaningful impact.42   \n96.  Because asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people can transmit the virus to \nothers, it is critical to follow CDC guidelines, including social distancing, even among people \nwho show no signs of COVID-19 and appear to be healthy. \n97.  The only effective way to minimize the potential devastation from COVID-19 in \nBOP facilities generally and at FCI Danbury in particular is to downsize immediately the \nincarcerated population and, for the prisoners who remain at the institution, to undertake \naggressively the detection, prevention, and treatment measures that public health and medical \nexperts have recommended, including effective social distancing. \n98.  These measures are not possible in prisons, like FCI Danbury, without substantial \nreductions in the prisoner population. \n99.  What some officials call “modified lockdowns” are not what self-quarantining \nand social distancing entails.

Implementation of necessary hygiene practices is also impossible, particularly \nwhen adequate supplies of free soap, sanitizers, disinfectants, and paper towels are not readily \navailable in prisons. [Meyer Decl. ¶¶ 9, 11, 39]. \n101.  Correctional public health experts have recommended the release from custody of \npeople most vulnerable to COVID-19 so as to protect them and permit risk mitigation for all \npeople held or working in facilities. Release of the most vulnerable people from custody also \nreduces the burden on the region’s health care infrastructure by reducing the likelihood that an \noverwhelming number of people will become seriously ill from COVID-19 at the same time. \n102.  Calling for immediate and extensive “efforts to decarcerate” to protect both \nprisoners and the general public, the New England Journal of Medicine explained: \nThe boundaries between communities and correctional institutions are porous, as \nare the borders between countries in the age of mass human travel. Despite \nsecurity at nearly every nation’s border, Covid-19 has appeared in practically all \ncountries. We can’t expect to find sturdier barriers between correctional \ninstitutions and their surrounding communities in any affected country. . . .To \npromote public health, we believe that efforts to decarcerate, which are already \nunder way in some jurisdictions, need to be scaled up; and associated reductions \nof incarcerated populations should be sustained. The interrelation of correctional-\nsystem health and public health is a reality not only in the United States but \naround the world.43 \n \n                                                 \n43  Matthew J.

Consistent with these public health recommendations, many jurisdictions have \nalready taken steps to protect those in custody from the impending spread of COVID-19 by \nreleasing people in an effort to reduce populations.44   \n104.  In New York City, public officials, the jail oversight board, and doctors working \nat Rikers Island have acknowledged that the City’s jails are unsafe and that releasing people is \nthe medically appropriate and humane option.45 See Statement of New York City Board of \nCorrection, March 17, 2020 (calling on the City to release people from criminal custody, \nprioritizing people over 50, those with underlying health conditions, detained for administrative \nreasons, and those who have been convicted and sentenced to one year or less).46   \n                                                 \n44 For example, in Washington, the governor has, as of April 23, commuted almost 300 sentences, \nand more than 40 people have received work release furloughs; Kentucky’s governor signed an executive \norder on April 2, 2020, commuting the sentences of 186 people convicted of felonies, and the state plans \nto release 743 others who are within 6 months of completing their sentences; the governor of Oklahoma \nhas commuted the sentences of more than 450 people; the number of people being paroled from state \nprisons in Michigan has reportedly increased by about 1,000 people per month to reduce prison density \nduring the pandemic; and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation announced on \nMarch 31 that it would expedite the transition to parole for 3,500 nonviolent offenders with 60 days or \nless left on their sentences.   See Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, Prison Policy Initiative (Apr. 24, \n2020), https://www.prisonpolicy.org/virus/virusresponse.html. Numerous cities and counties have also \ntaken steps to reduce jail populations, including: from March 18 to April 15, 2020, the Washington, D.C., \njail population decreased by more than 21%; the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office in California has \nreleased 382 people from their two county jails, including those who are 65 and older; after an April 3, \n2020, ruling from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, almost 300 people were released from jails \nacross the state.

On March 20, 2020, Dr. Robert Cohen, a member of New York City’s Board of \nCorrection, said, “The most important thing we can do right now is discharge all of the people \nwho are old and have serious medical issues — those people are likely to die from a coronavirus \ninfection.”47  \n106.  Several doctors working in New York City’s jails have echoed the calls to release \nvulnerable people. Dr. Rachael Bedard, senior director of the geriatrics and complex care service \nat Rikers Island, has described depopulation as “[t] he only meaningful public health \nintervention.”48 In correctional facilities, “if you think about how many excess human contacts \n[there are], even compared to something like a shelter setting, you can imagine why viral spread \nin this environment is extra dangerous.”   \n107.  Ross McDonald, the Chief Medical Officer for Correctional Health Services, \nwhich provides healthcare to New York City’s Department of Corrections, said Rikers was a \n“public health disaster unfolding before our eyes.” He stressed: “This is not a generational public \nhealth crisis, rather it is a crisis of a magnitude no generation living today has ever seen.” He also \nwarned that it was “unlikely” they will be able to stop the growth in the jail, and predicted that \n20% of those infected would need hospital treatment and 5% would need ventilators. He called \nfor the release of “as many vulnerable people as possible”49 \n                                                 \n47  Jen Ransom and Alan Feuer, ‘A Storm Is Coming’: Fears of a Prisoner Epidemic as the Virus \nSpreads in the Jails, N.Y.

Members of Congress have, likewise, recognized the urgency of reducing prison \npopulations as a means of achieving social distancing in those institutions. On March 23, 2020, a \nbipartisan group of fourteen U.S. Senators sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Barr and BOP \nDirector Carvajal to express their “serious concern for the health and wellbeing of federal prison \nstaff and prisoners . . . especially those who are most vulnerable to infection.” The Senators \nwrote that they reviewed the BOP’s COVID-19 Action Plan and noted that it did not include any \nmeasures to protect the most vulnerable staff and prisoners. The Senators urged DOJ and BOP to \nrelease to home confinement certain individuals who were elderly, ill, or incarcerated for non-\nviolent offenses and are near release. \n109.  Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, founding Chairman and current member of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law (subsequently \nrenamed the Subcommittee on Constitution, Civil Rights, and Human Rights) and current \nranking member on the Subcommittee on Immigration has called on the federal government to \ntake action to protect staff and people detained in federal prisons. “Federal prisons will \ninevitably be a hotspot for the spread of coronavirus, especially among vulnerable staff and \nprisoners,” Durbin said. “It is imperative for BOP to take immediate action to protect staff and \nprisoners at federal prisons throughout the country and ensure that facilities are prepared to \naddress this threat.”50 \n                                                 \n50  Durbin Discusses Coronavirus Threat At Federal Prisons With Council Of Prison Locals, \nDick Durbin United States Senator Illinois (Mar. 24, 2020), \nhttps://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-discussescoronavirus-threat-at-federal-\nprisons-with-council-of-prison-locals; Letter, \nhttps://www.durbin.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Letter.%20to%20DOJ%20and%20BOP%20on%20COVI\nD-19%20and%20FSA%20provisions%20-\n%20final%20bipartisan%20text%20with%20signature%20blocks.pdf \n38 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 39 of 71\n \n110.  On March 27, 2020, Congress enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic \nSecurity Act (CARES Act, P.L. 116-136), which authorizes the BOP Director to lengthen the \nmaximum amount of time for which a prisoner may be placed on home confinement “as the \nDirector determines appropriate” when the Attorney General “finds that emergency conditions \nwill materially affect the functioning” of BOP. \n111.  The authority is limited to “the covered emergency period,” which is defined as \nthe period spanning from the President’s declaration of a national emergency with respect to \nCOVID-19 to the date that is 30 days after the date on which the declaration terminates.  \n112.  The United States Department of Justice has also called for urgent action to \nreduce prison populations in the BOP to achieve necessary social distancing. On March 26, \n2020, Attorney General William Barr sent a memo to the Director of BOP “directing [him] to \nprioritize the use of [his] various statutory authorities to grant home confinement for prisoners \nseeking transfer in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic” because “for some eligible \nprisoners, home confinement might be more effective in protecting their health.”51 \n113.  The Attorney General specifically recognized that “there are some at-risk \nprisoners who are non-violent and pose minimal likelihood of recidivism and who might be safer \nserving their sentences in home confinement rather than BOP facilities.”52   \n114.  Attorney General Barr further identified “[t]he age and vulnerability of the \nprisoner to COVID-19, in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n(CDC) guidelines,” and “the security level of the facility,” with “priority given” to prisoners \n                                                 \n51  Memo from Attorney General to Director of Bureau of Prisons, March 26, 2020, \nhttps://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/docs/bop_memo_home_confinement.pdf \n52  Id. \n39 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 40 of 71\n \nincarcerated “in low and medium security facilities,” as two of the critical, discretionary factors \nfor consideration.  Id. \n115.  In an April 3, 2020, memorandum to Respondent Carvajal, following the dramatic \nincreases in confirmed COVID-19 cases at FCI Danbury and two other BOP facilities (FCI \nOakdale in Louisiana, and FCI Elkton in Ohio), Attorney General Barr affirmed the BOP’s \n“profound obligation to protect the health and safety of all inmates.”53 \n116.  Attorney General Barr stated: “As you know, we are experiencing significant \nlevels of infection at several of our facilities, including FCI Oakdale, FCI Danbury, and FCI \nElkton. We have to move with dispatch in using home confinement, where appropriate, to move \nvulnerable inmates out of these institutions. I would like you to give priority to these institutions, \nand others similarly affected, as you continue to process the remaining inmates who are eligible \nfor home confinement under pre-CARES Act standards. In addition, the CARES Act now \nauthorizes me to expand the cohort of inmates who can be considered for home release upon my \nfinding that emergency conditions are materially affecting the functioning of the Bureau of \nPrisons. I hereby make that finding and direct that, as detailed below, you give priority in \nimplementing these new standards to the most vulnerable inmates at the most affected facilities, \nconsistent with the guidance below.”  \n117.  Attorney General Barr further recognized that, despite “extensive precautions to \nprevent COVID-19 from entering [BOP] facilities and infecting our prisoners,” those measures \n“have not been perfectly effective.” Accordingly, he ordered the BOP to take more aggressive \n                                                 \n53  Memo from Attorney General to Director of Bureau of Prisons, April 3, 2020, \nhttps://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/docs/bop_memo_home_confinement_april3.pdf \n40 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 41 of 71\n \nsteps, immediately, to transfer prisoners to home confinement, even if electronic monitoring will \nnot be available. \n118.  Echoing the warnings of public health experts, Attorney General Barr stated: \n“Given the speed with which this disease has spread through the general public, it is clear that \ntime is of the essence.”  Id.   \nVI.  Respondents Have Failed to Proceed as Promptly as Required in this Crisis to De-\nDensify and to Implement the Necessary Social Distancing at BOP Facilities and at \nFCI Danbury in Particular  \n \n119.  Notwithstanding Attorney General Barr’s statements, the recommendations of \npublic health officials and the efforts of multiple state jurisdictions to decarcerate their prison \npopulations, Respondents have failed to use the BOP’s available statutory authority to reduce the \npopulation of FCI Danbury to mitigate the severe risk posed by COVID-19. Instead, the facility \nhas reversed course, refusing to follow through with transfers to home confinement for \nindividuals previously identified for such home confinement based on their medical \nvulnerability, and failing to timely respond to requests for emergency compassionate relief or to \ntake other measures appropriate for a public health crisis. \n120.  According to the BOP’s website, from March 26 (the date of Attorney General \nBarr’s first memo) through April 25, the agency placed 1576 prisoners nationwide into home \nconfinement—which would constitute only 0.9 percent of the approximately 171,000 prisoners \ncurrently held in BOP custody.  However, the real number of those released to home \nconfinement may well be less. As the Wall Street Journal reported on April 23: “The bureau said \nit has started placing at least 1,440 of the roughly 175,000 prisoners it holds into home \nconfinement, but didn’t say how many of those people have actually been released.” Sadie \n41 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 42 of 71\n \nGurman & Rebecca Davis O’Brien, Confusion Hampers Coronavirus-Driven Inmate Releases, \nWall Street Journal, April 23, 2020;54 see also Joseph Neff & Keri Blakinger, Few Federal \nPrisoners Released Under COVID-19 Emergency Policies: A Federal Judge Called the Bureau \nof Prisons Release Process “Kafkaesque”, The Marshall Project, Apr. 25, 2020 (only 1,027 \nmore prisoners allowed to serve the rest of their sentence in home confinement since Attorney \nGeneral Barr’s April 3 urgent memo, “about half of 1 percent of the more than 174,000 people in \nthe bureau’s custody”).55 \n121.  The BOP has not disclosed the number of prisoners it typically released per day \nprior to Attorney General Barr’s memos, nor has it disclosed how many new prisoners have \nentered BOP custody during the same time period. In short, data from the BOP demonstrate that \nit is not releasing enough prisoners to protect federal prisons from COVID-19. \n122.  Indeed, despite concerns by government officials and public health experts, the \nBOP continues to transfer people from facility to facility. Those transfers increase the likelihood \nthat the virus will be transmitted within the incarcerated population.56 \n123.  On information and belief, the first person at FCI Danbury (then housed in the M \nUnit of the men’s prison) tested positive for COVID-19 on or about March 28, 2020.  [Almonte \nDecl. ¶ 12].  \n                                                 \n54 Available at https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-clarifies-coronavirus-driven-\ninmate-releases-11587594242. \n55 Available at https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/04/25/few-federal-prisoners-released-\nunder-covid-19-emergency-policies.  \n56  Luke Barr, Despite Coronavirus Warnings, Federal Bureau of Prisons Still Transferring \nPrisoners: Sources, ABC News (Mar. 23, 2020, 1:22PM), https://abcnews.go.com/Health/warnings-\nbureau-prisons-transporting-inmates-sources/story?id=69747416    \n42 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 43 of 71\n \n124.  Prior to testing positive for COVID-19, the individual was in contact with many \nprisoners and staff, necessitating a proper public health response to contain the infection, \nincluding the immediate introduction of social distancing and enhanced hygiene measures.  \n125.  However, as set forth above, the very configuration of the confined prison space \nwith sleeping quarters and all ancillary facilities in close physical proximity and multiple \nprisoners in the same physical space and requiring simultaneous access to the limited available \nresources, precludes the requisite social distancing without dramatic de-densification.  Under \nexisting conditions, neither class members nor staff in any of the three units at FCI Danbury can \nstay at least six feet away from other people and, therefore, engage in effective social distancing, \nas called for by the CDC. \n126.  Moreover, FCI Danbury has failed to take appropriate action as set forth in the \nrelevant CDC Guidance in response to those tests confirming the existence of the virus within its \npopulation but rather, persisted in practices and policies which are contrary to social distancing \ndirectives and are inconsistent with the needs for enhanced hygiene.  \n127.  Respondents’ failures to adopt and implement adequate policies and procedures to \nprevent and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 fall into several broad categories which are \ndiscussed below. \nA.  Failures to Triage Cases, Diagnose and Isolate Disease   \n128.  If an incarcerated person exhibits symptoms of COVID-19, the CDC Guidance \ncalls for the individual to be immediately given a face mask, paced in isolation, provided a \nmedical evaluation and treatment, and evaluated for possible testing.  By contrast, FCI Danbury \nhas deliberately not sought out potential cases of coronavirus and has not implemented the \n43 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 44 of 71\n \nmeasures called for by the CDC Guidance. By failing meaningfully to isolate prisoners and staff \nwho are positive for coronavirus, or who exhibit symptoms highly indicative of coronavirus and \npresent a substantial risk of infecting other prisoners and staff in the unit, the Respondents have \nbeen deliberately indifferent to the known serious medical needs of the Petitioner class.  \n129.  Since the lockdown began, sick call triage in the men’s facility is conducted by a \nsocial worker without medical training, and who is openly contemptuous of the men’s needs.  \n[Cassidy Decl. ¶ 18]57 \n130.  At men’s and women’s facilities, prisoners who present for sick call who do not \nexhibit fever are denied access to any further medical follow-up. [Id.; Korbe Decl. ¶¶ 4-6, \nHoisington Decl. ¶ 6].  \n131.  Prisoners who complain to staff of symptoms consistent with COVID-19—\nincluding coughing, congestion and shortness of breath—are routinely unable to obtain \nimmediate medical examination, are not tested for COVID-19, and are returned to the general \npopulation until their symptoms worsen. [Hoisington Decl. ¶¶ 5-7, 14-15; Korbe Decl. ¶¶ 7, 12; \nMason Decl. ¶ 19; Almonte Decl. ¶ 20].58 \n                                                 \n57   As Mr. Cassidy states: \nThe social worker, Ms. Adamson, has told us “you are all fucking children with nothing \nmore than a flu so stop your shit you’re not going home early.”  She has said, “if you did \nthe crime stop crying and do the time.”  She has said, “I don’t need medical training to \ntell you you’re not sick so go lay the fuck down.”  [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 18]. \n58  As Ms. Hoisington – who was subsequently hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection \nand a temperature of 102 degrees on admission [Hoisington Decl. ¶ 5, 8] – recounts:  \nI had been feeling sick for a couple weeks before I went to the hospital. I had put \nin a request to see medical, and had been given two different “idles” to miss \nprograms because I was sick. On March 26 I reported to staff that I wasn’t \nfeeling well ... I went to the medical clinic, but after waiting there for 45 minutes \nwithout being seen, I returned to my bunk.  A few hours later, I reported to staff \non duty that I was feeling worse.  I was told to lie back down.  By early in the \nmorning of March 27th, around 1 or 2am, I had such bad chest pain that I could \n44 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 45 of 71\n \n132.  FCI Danbury has further willfully refused to take temperatures or test for fever in \norder to avoid identifying cases of possible COVID infection.  [Almonte Decl. ¶ 15] \n133.  When prisoners have presented with likely fever, Respondents have on occasion \nfalsely discounted the readings of elevated temperatures in order to avoid taking appropriate \nfollow-up action, including, in particular, isolating the prisoner from the general population and \ntesting to confirm a coronavirus diagnosis.   \n134.  Methods employed by respondents to avoid appropriate follow-up in cases of \nlikely fever include, (1) falsely attributing the reading to equipment error; (2) falsely attributing \nthe reading to operator error; (3) falsely recording identical temperatures for every person tested \non a given unit; (4) “resetting” the thermometer while pretending to take another reading; and (5) \ntaking repeat temperature readings after first requiring the prisoner to drink a glass of ice water. \n[Cassidy Decl. ¶ 14; Mason Decl. ¶¶ 20, 21 (recorded temperatures are artificially low at \nbetween 96-97°F because temperature is taken with a remote scanner that is placed too remote \nfrom the body; prisoners made to drink cold water after registering elevated temperatures); \nKorbe Decl. ¶ 5; see also Hoisington Decl. ¶ 8 (reporting that she was transported to the hospital \non an emergency basis after persistent symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and that she had a \ntemperature of 102°F on admission after having been told by FCI Danbury staff that a \n                                                                                                                                                             \nnot sleep. I told the officer on duty, who called the command center, and then \ncalled an ambulance. [Id. ¶ 5-7] \n  Similarly, Ms. Korbe – who has been complaining of a headache, cough and lost sense of smell \nfor over a week, has not been screened for COVID-19 and has been maintained in general population \nthroughout. [Korbe Decl. ¶ 4].  Indeed, Ms. Korbe’s cough was so extreme that one of the psychologist \nupon hearing the cough told Ms. Korbe that she should be tested because she could be infecting others.  \nNotwithstanding that Ms. Korbe asked the one of the psychologists to assist her to obtain appropriate \ntesting, she has not, to date, been tested for COVID-19. [Id. ¶ 6].   \n45 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 46 of 71\n \ntemperature taken within an hour prior to her leaving in the ambulance had purportedly \nregistered a reading of 97°F)].59 \n135.  Even where prisoners have presented with confirmed fever, respondents have \nfailed to isolate the prisoner from the general population. Rather, in many instances, respondents \nhave returned the prisoner to his or her unit with instruction to take two to three Tylenol and will \nonly proceed to isolate the prisoner if his or her fever does not respond after that time. [Cassidy \nDecl. ¶ 12; Mason Decl. ¶ 20]. \n136.  When temperatures are taken, they are often not being recorded in the medical \nrecords.  [Mason Decl. ¶ 21]. \n137.  Prison staff have further denigrated or dismissed prisoners exhibiting clear \nsymptoms of coronavirus, telling prisoners with headache, body ache, shortness of breath or even \n                                                 \n59  As Ms. Hoisington states, on April 17, after previously having tested positive for COVID-19, \nshe started to get symptoms again, including weakness, fever, terrible body pains, sweating and dry \nheaving.  She was taken to the medical clinic where her temperature was recorded at 98 degrees (which \nshe believed to be incorrect but which was not re-taken despite her presenting symptoms).  \nNotwithstanding that her oxygenation only registered at 96 and her blood pressure was so high that the \nnurse took it three times, the nurse instructed her to take Tylenol and return to her unit. [Hoisington Decl. \n¶ 15]. \nAs Mr. Cassidy recounts:  “For the last couple weeks, prisoners with a fever are taken to medical.  \nSometimes, however, a prisoner has a fever and the associate warden attributes the temperature reading to \nequipment error.  When the temperature wand comes up with a low-grade fever, the associate warden will \n‘reset’ it and pretend to take another reading.  He will announce another number, but he won’t even aim \nthe wand at the prisoner’s forehead.  The associate warden does not show the prisoners the LCD screen \non the wand that displays the temperature, so we have to go by whatever they tell us. … If the associate \nwarden acknowledges that a prisoner has a temperature, then he will escort the prisoner to medical.  At \nmedical, the prisoner is given two or three Tylenol and told that the device is not working properly and \nthat they do not have a fever.  This has happened to more than 20 prisoners in my unit.  One of the \nprisoners has been vomiting blood all week.  When his temperature was taken in the unit, he was told he \nhas a 101.2 degree fever.  When he got to medical, he was given Tylenol, told that his temperature is 98.7 \ndegrees, and sent back to the unit.  When he got back to the unit, he told us that they never took his \ntemperature in medical.  His forehead was hot.  [Cassidy Decl. ¶¶ 13-14]. \nAccording to Ms. Korbe, staff members have been taking all of the inmates’ temperatures every \nday: “They have us line up in rows to do this.  I have noticed that everyone in the same row is told that \nthey have the exact same temperature.”  [Korbe Decl. ¶ 14]. \n46 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 47 of 71\n \nchest pains that there is nothing that they can do, that the prisoner merely suffers from \n“overblown flu,” that the prisoner “did the crime” and should “do the time,” and/or that the \ncoronavirus epidemic is not “going to get you out of prison.” [Cassidy Decl. ¶¶ 9, 18; Korbe \nDecl. ¶ 16 (staff criticized prisoners’ concern about medical emergency in FSL, telling women to \n“stay in our lane” because they weren’t doctors)].  \n138.  Respondents’ failure to de-densify the population at FCI Danbury and their \ninadequate manner of responding to suspected COVID-19 cases places the putative class at an \nunreasonable risk of contracting COVID-19. \nB.  Failure to Respond Adequately to Cases of Close Contact or Observe \nAppropriate Quarantine/Isolation \n \n139.  CDC Guidance directs prisons to implement 14-day quarantines/isolation of \nprisoners or staff who have had contact with people known to have tested positive for COVID-\n19, to monitor such Close Contact Cases for COVID-19 symptoms, and to keep staff members \nout of the facility unless they are asymptomatic 14 days after their exposure to COVID-19.  \nContrary to this Guidance, Respondents routinely fail to test or isolate prisoners with known \nclose contact with individuals subsequently diagnosed with coronavirus. [Cassidy Decl. ¶¶  31, \n41; Hoisington Decl. ¶¶ 14, 17 (recounting failure to test prisoners in close contact with prisoner \nhospitalized with COVID-19 infection)].   \n140.  Prisoners who test positive for COVID-19 are frequently returned to the general \npopulation far earlier than appropriate pursuant to CDC Guidance.60 [Declaration of Tamika \nSomerville, submitted herewith as Exhibit I (“Sommerville Decl.”) ¶ 13 (women testing positive \n                                                                                                                                                             \n \n47 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 48 of 71\n \nfor COVID-19 on Tuesday returned to the unit that same Friday); Madore Decl. ¶ 12; Cassidy \nDecl. ¶ 15 (reporting that two individuals returned to the unit within 5-6 days after testing \npositive for COVID-19, resulting in a substantial outbreak on the unit); Almonte Decl. ¶ 17; \nMason Decl. ¶ 18]. \n141.  Due to staff shortages, prisoners are often required to respond to a medical \nemergency such as another prisoner collapsing on the unit. Notwithstanding that the collapse of a \ngrown man in the context of a pervasive outbreak is highly suggestive of a COVID-19 infection, \nprisoners who respond in this fashion are not thereafter followed for possible infection or \notherwise isolated from the rest of the population.  [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 31; Hoisington Decl. ¶ 13 \n(women had to bang front door to facility to get attention of someone in parking lot when there \nwas no available officer to attend to women who was unconscious after hitting her head on \nconcrete floor)].61 \n142.  Contrary to CDC Guidance, prison staff, including those working in food \nservices, have not been allowed to call in and explain that they are sick or have returned to work \nat times when medical professionals advised that they were still potential carriers. [Martinez-\nBrooks Decl. ¶ 20; Mason Decl. ¶ 15 (“Officers have returned to work after being unable to get \ntheir FMLA papers signed, but remain symptomatic. One officer stated that they still feel ill and \ndo not want to be at work, but were told to return.”)].   \n143.  Working correctional officers who are sick or who were previously diagnosed as \npositive for COVID-19 have advised prisoners to keep their distance since they do not know \n                                                                                                                                                             \n60  As set forth in the Declaration of Tamika Somerville, who is housed in the FSL, a woman in \nher unit who tested positive for COVID-19 on a Tuesday was returned to the general population on \nFriday, three days later. [Somerville Decl., ¶ 13]. \n61  Mr. Cassidy has observed at least three prisoner medical emergencies that were addressed only \n48 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 49 of 71\n \nwhether they are sufficiently recovered to no longer present a risk of infection to people with \nwhom they come in contact. [Mason Decl. ¶ 15].   \n144.  FCI Danbury has failed to observe appropriate isolation for new prisoners, and \nprisoners have been permitted into the facility without observance of proper quarantine pursuant \nto CDC Guidance.  [Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 12]. \n145.  Respondents’ failure to implement appropriate isolation procedures is reckless \nand places the putative class at an unreasonable risk of contracting COVID-19. \nC.  Failure to Remediate Adequately Spaces with Known Coronavirus Contact  \n  and to Inform Prisoners of the Extent of Infection                    \n \n146.  In the event a prisoner or staff member tests positive for COVID-19, CDC \nGuidance calls for the facility to close off the areas used by that person.  These areas are to be \nwell ventilated for at least 24 hours before they are disinfected by people equipped with proper \npersonal protective equipment (“PPE”).  Respondents have failed to implement any of these \nmeasures. \n147.  In addition, FCI Danbury has departed from CDC Guidance by not informing \nincarcerated prisoners that someone in their unit has tested positive for COVID-19, thereby \ndepriving petitioners and the class members of the opportunity to exercise more vigilance in their \nhygiene and cleaning habits when extra vigilance is needed most. Petitioners and the putative \nclass members have not been informed of the extent of the outbreak at FCI Danbury. [Mason \nDecl. ¶ 16 (FSL prisoners learned about COVID-19 outbreak in the facility because it was \nreported on the news)]; Declaration of Theresa Foreman, submitted herewith as Exhibit J \n                                                                                                                                                             \nby other prisoners. \n49 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 50 of 71\n \n(“Foreman Decl.”) ¶ 19 (the Assistant Warden informed the women that they wouldn’t be told if \nthey were exposed to COVID-19)]. \n148.  Respondents know that these failures to adequately remediate spaces with known \ncoronavirus contact or to advise petitioners and the putative class members of the extent of the \noutbreak at the facility unnecessarily heightens the risk that petitioners and the putative class \nmembers will contract COVID-19. \nD.  Failure to Implement Adequately Social Distancing Measures \n149.  As set forth above, the very configuration of FCI Danbury precludes meaningful \nsocial distancing. The overwhelming majority of the facility’s prisoners in each of the three \nfacilities are housed dormitory-style and all prisoners in these configurations sleep within 3 to 4 \nfeet of between 3 and 5 other prisoners. [Mason Decl. ¶ 7; Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 7; Cassidy \nDecl. ¶ 31; Declaration of Ronald Harper, submitted herewith as Exhibit N (Harper Decl.) ¶ 4]. \nPrisoners use the same bathrooms and share a limited number of toilets, sinks and showers. \n[Mason Decl. ¶ 10; Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶¶ 6, 10; Cassidy Decl. ¶ 32; Harper Decl. ¶ \n4]. Prisoners further must share a limited number of telephones and computers which are located \nclose together in a common area [Mason Decl. ¶ 8; Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 9; Cassidy Decl. ¶¶ \n35-36] and which are rarely cleaned or disinfected (and are not disinfected after each use). \n[Korbe Decl. ¶ 11; Cassidy Decl. ¶¶ 35-36].  \n150.  FCI Danbury has failed to implement adequate social distancing measures in \nother aspects of prison life.  For example, prisoners are regularly unnecessarily made to line up \nin close proximity to one another to receive their meals and when medications are dispensed. \n[Almonte Decl. ¶ 13; Cassidy Decl. ¶ 39 (“Staff give out medication twice a day. They shout \n50 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 51 of 71\n \n‘medication’ and stand outside the door. Prisoners form a pill line, standing right next to each \nother. If you don’t hear ‘medication’ you don’t get your medication for the day, so everyone \ncomes up at the same time and crowds each other.”)].   \n151.  Prisoners likewise mass together for commissary which, in the dorms in the men’s \nunits, is brought into the central dormitory hallway in a laundry bin. The men on the dorm then \nstand in the narrow hallway in close proximity to one another while waiting for their names to be \ncalled. [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 37]. \n152.  Prisoners further congregate in close proximity in unacceptably large numbers in \nrecreation areas and in common areas to watch television, to use the telephones and computers, \nand for meals. [Declaration of Antrum Coston, submitted herewith as Exhibit K (“Coston Decl.”) \n¶ 4; Almonte Decl. ¶ 8; Mason Decl. ¶¶ 8-9].  \n153.  Staff move regularly between units, in contravention of proper social distancing \npractices, thereby exacerbating the spread of undiagnosed disease from one part of the facility to \nanother. [Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 19 (staff move between all four dorms in the camp for count, \nfood delivery and commissary and staff at camp also work at the other two facilities at FCI \nDanbury)]. \n154.  Respondents have inappropriately moved prisoners from rooms where greater \nseparation was possible into dorms in the women’s camp, pushing the populations of A, B and C \ndorms to almost full capacity, thereby dramatically reducing the ability of occupants of those \ndorms to practice any form of social distancing. [Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 5]. Despite the \nlockdown at the camp, women from one dorm out for recreation have been visiting friends in \nother dorms. [Id. ¶ 15]. \n51 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 52 of 71\n \n155.  Respondents have further isolated prisoners nearing the end of their sentences and \npreparing for halfway house or other release, but subsequently rendered such isolation \nineffective by moving other prisoners with unknown COVID-19 exposures onto those previously \nisolated units. [Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 13]. \n156.  Respondents further initially isolated medically-vulnerable prisoners who were \nnotified that they were going to be transferred to home confinement but, after reversing policy \nand putting such transfers on hold, have rendered those isolations ineffective—and have put \nmedically-vulnerable prisoners at undue risk—by moving other prisoners with unknown \nCOVID-19 exposures onto those previously isolated units. [Id.].  \n157.  Respondents’ failure to implement adequate social distancing measures places \npetitioners and the putative class members at unnecessarily heightened risk of contracting \nCOVID-19. \n  E.  Failure to Implement Necessary Hygiene Measures \n158.  CDC Guidance requires heightened hygienic, cleaning and disinfecting practices \nin order to prevent and mitigate COVID-19 infection. FCI Danbury has failed adequately to \nimplement these heightened hygienic and cleaning practices. Petitioners do not have access to \nthe cleaning supplies necessary to sanitize themselves, their personal items, or their living areas. \n159.  Prisoners at FCI Danbury are responsible for cleaning their own cubicles or \ndormitory spaces. Prisoners do not have adequate cleaning supplies, shared living spaces \nthroughout the facility are not regularly or properly disinfected to prevent the spread of COVID-\n19. [Madore Decl. ¶ 6]. \n52 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 53 of 71\n \n160.  Common spaces are cleaned by prisoners who are assigned jobs as cleaners, but \nmany women have quit their jobs and cleaning has been sporadic. [Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 9; \nAlmonte Decl. ¶ 22]. The common toilets, sinks and showers are not regularly or properly \ndisinfected to prevent the spread of COVID-19. \n161.  Telephones, computers and video calling equipment and televisions shared by \nhundreds of prisoners are not cleaned or disinfected between uses and the common areas in \nwhich that equipment is located is not regularly or properly disinfected to prevent the spread of \nCOVID-19. [Cassidy Decl. ¶¶ 36-37]. \n162.  No professional or staff cleaners have sanitized the units where prisoners who \ntested positive have been housed, but instead those units are being cleaned by prisoner orderlies \nwith the same cleaning supplies they regularly use and without provision of sufficient gloves and \nmasks. [Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 8; Mason Decl. ¶ 8; Almonte Decl. ¶ 22; Declaration of \nShannon Benson, submitted herewith as Exhibit L (Benson Decl.”) ¶ 8; Cassidy Decl. ¶ 33; \nCoston Decl. ¶¶ 7, 15).  \n163.  FCI Danbury has provided inadequate access to soap and sanitizers.  The prison \nhas not created any hand-washing stations or provided prisoners with hand sanitizer. [Coston \nDecl. ¶ 15; Somerville Decl. ¶ 10; Mason Decl. ¶ 12].  Nor has hand sanitizer been available in \nthe commissary for the duration of the current COVID-19 crisis. [Coston Decl. ¶ 15].  Liquid \nsoap dispensers have only recently been installed in the men’s prison, but they are not regularly \nrestocked and the prisoners have to wait a day or two to get it refilled.  [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 34 \n(men’s unit)].   \n53 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 54 of 71\n \n164.  There are no paper towels or hand towels, so prisoners have to use toilet paper or \ntheir clothing to dry their hands.  [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 34; Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 8]. \n165.   Soap must be purchased from the commissary and is unavailable to indigent \nprisoners. Prisoners are not provided with cleaning supplies either.62 [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 34]. \n166.  The prison does not distribute shampoo, toothpaste or mouthwash which must be \npurchased from the commissary and are, therefore, unavailable to indigent prisoners. [Id.]. \n167.  Since the epidemic, laundry is done once a week (depending on the availability of \nhot water or staff to perform the function), leaving used clothing and bedding exposed to the \nvirus. [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 20].   \n168.  Prisoners in the facility have further been assigned to handle laundry, mattresses \nand bedding of individuals isolated for COVID, exposing those prisoners in turn to possible \ninfection.    \n169.  Isolation facilities are further inadequate and unhygienic. The isolation room at \nthe FSL is cold and small, with just enough room for a bed and a toilet.  The bed has a one-inch \nthick mattress and no pillow.  The toilet’s flush is controlled by the corrections officer and is \nonly flushed a few times a day. [Hoisington Decl. ¶ 11].   \n170.  FSL subsequently required overflow isolation for individuals returning from \nhospital or with confirmed diagnosis positive for COVID-19 and was required to convert the \nvisiting room at the facility. Four women were housed in the visiting room and were required to \nuse the visiting room bathrooms and had to shower in a temporary stand-up stall built in the \nbathroom to enable them to bathe.  [Id. ¶ 13].  \n54 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 55 of 71\n \n171.  Some prisoners who are in quarantine are held in a room with no running water. \n172.  Men have been isolated in an observation cell where they do not have consistent \naccess to meals and showers and often experience medication delays. Men isolated in \nobservation cells were further unable to communicate with their families or other prisoners in the \nfacility. [Declaration of Richard Johnson, submitted herewith as Exhibit M, ¶¶ 7-8].   \n173.  More than 40 women in the FSL are currently quarantined in the facility’s dining \nhall/kitchen. [Hoisington Decl. ¶ 17]. \n174.  The FSL frequently has issues with water which is often shut off for a few hours \nor for as long as a day at a time, during which time nobody in FSL is able to wash their hands or \nflush the toilet. [Mason Decl. ¶ 11].   \n175.  Cleaning is now sporadic in many areas of the camp since prisoners who were \npreviously assigned to clean different areas of the facility have either quit their jobs or have been \nisolated in different dorms from their assigned cleaning area. [Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 8]. \n176.  These unsanitary conditions and inadequate levels of cleaning and disinfecting, \nwhich are in contravention of the CDC Guidance, place petitioners and the putative class \nmembers at an inexcusably higher risk of contracting COVID-19. \n  F.  Failure to Plan Adequately to Prevent or Mitigate the Spread of COVID-19 \nInfection                                                                                                  \n \n177.  CDC Guidance recommends that correctional facilities should develop \ncontingency plans for reduced workforces due to staff absences. That Guidance also calls for the \nprovision of PPE and contingency planning for shortages of PPE. FCI Danbury has failed to \n                                                                                                                                                             \n62  During the early weeks of the crisis, respondents actively confiscated spray bottles that \nprisoners used for cleaning.  Those spray bottles are now only available to prisoners in the counselor’s \noffice.  [Almonte Decl. ¶ 21].  \n55 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 56 of 71\n \nadequately plan for either inevitable staff shortages or the need for PPE, placing petitioners and \nthe putative class members at heightened risk. \n178.  As set forth above, respondents have required correctional staff who were ill—\nincluding correctional staff in close contact with individuals exposed to COVID-19 and \ncorrectional staff who were confirmed positive for COVID-19—to return to work before they \nwere symptom-free and earlier than appropriate pursuant to applicable CDC Guidance. [Mason \nDecl., ¶ 15].  \n179.  Prisoners at FCI Danbury were not provided with fabric masks until in or about \nmid-April. [Mason Decl. ¶ 13]. Prior to that time, prisoners were dependent on paper masks or \nhad to fashion their own masks. [Id.]. However, in many parts of the facility, FCI Danbury only \nprovides one mask per prisoner and, therefore, prisoners have no protection when their masks are \nbeing washed. [Somerville Decl. ¶ 11]. Several prisoners in the men’s prison are dependent on \npaper disposable hospital masks that fall apart when they come in contact with water.  [Cassidy \nDecl. ¶ 40].  \n180.  Prisoners—including prisoners on cleaning duty—are not provided with gloves to \nprotect their hands from exposed surfaces. [Id.; Foreman Decl. ¶ 16]. \n181.  Correctional officers and staff, likewise were not provided with fabric masks until \napproximately mid-April. [Mason Decl. ¶ 14]. \n182.  Moreover, usage of PPE is inconsistent and correctional staff does not enforce \nmask usage on prisoners who refuse to cover their faces, [Cassidy Decl. ¶40], nor does \ncorrectional staff consistently wear masks or gloves when they are on the units. [Martinez-\nBrooks Decl. ¶ 16; Cassidy Decl. ¶ 41].     \n56 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 57 of 71\n \nG.  Failure to Implement the Training and Interventions Necessary to Prevent \n   the Spread of COVID-19 \n \n183.  CDC Guidance states that correctional staff and incarcerated people should be \ntrained on donning, doffing and disposing of PPE. CDC Guidance further recommends that \ncorrectional facilities post signage informing staff and incarcerated people how to report \nCOVID-19 symptoms and advising staff to stay at home when sick.  FCI Danbury has failed \nadequately to implement either of these training and educational interventions. [See, e.g., \nCassidy Decl. ¶ 42 (staff go into quarantine units and then return to units that are purportedly \nCOVID-free without changing gloves and masks or will remove gloves without washing hands)].  \nFCI Danbury has further failed to provide prisoners or staff with clear guidance on what to do to \nprotect themselves and prisoners are often reluctant to report symptoms because they have no \nexpectation that they will receive effective treatment and fear being isolated away from their \nfriends and property in quarantine units that are often insufficiently hygienic. [Mason Decl. ¶ \n22].      \n  H.  Respondents’ Failures to Respond to the COVID-19 Epidemic Have Further \nPut Petitioners and Putative Class Members at Unacceptably Heightened \nRisk of Injury and Illness Unrelated to COVID-19                 \n \n184.  Respondents’ failure to prepare adequately for the COVID-19 epidemic has also \nput petitioners and the putative class members at heightened risk of other injury and illness.   \n185.  FCI Danbury is experiencing significant staff shortages.  Many correctional \nofficers are absent and those who are working are putting in significant overtime.   \n186.  The performance of the duties of correctional officers is being augmented by non-\ncorrectional staff (such as medical or educational staff) who cover units when there are \ninsufficient correctional staff.  [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 30]. \n57 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 58 of 71\n \n187.   As a result of staff shortages, correctional officers and other staff are often only \navailable on the units for limited amounts of time, generally for count, resulting in significantly \nextended response times in the event of emergencies on the units. On at least one occasion, when \na prisoner experienced chest pains on a unit in which no correctional officer was present, other \nprisoners on the unit were required to yell out the window in the hopes that a staff member could \nhear them and could respond to the medical emergency. [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 31; Hoisington Decl. ¶ \n13 (on one occasion in isolation unit in FSL visiting room, one of the quarantined prisoners fell \nin the bathroom and hit her head on the concrete floor, rendering her unconscious. There was no \nnearby guard and the prisoners were required to bang on the locked front door to the facility; \nhelp only arrived because someone in the parking lot heard the prisoners and called control)].  \n188.  As a result of the increased attention to the COVID epidemic, non-virus medical \nneeds have gone unattended.  The regular prison physicians have been absent or are no longer \navailable to prisoners on the unit, prisoners who do not present with fever during sick call cannot \nbe referred to a physician, and sick call requests for other than virus symptoms go unanswered \nfor prolonged periods of time. [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 17; Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 23].63   \n189.  Recently, the prison pharmacy has been closed. Medications must be shipped \nfrom another facility (USP Allenwood in Pennsylvania) resulting in delays in their delivery and \ndisruption of medication regimens. [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 7 (two week delay in receipt of correct \ndosage of medication); Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 23 (8 day delay in refill of hypertension \nmedication)]. \n                                                 \n63  Petitioner Kenneth Cassidy suffers from intestinal disease, including diverticulitis.  [Cassidy \nDecl. ¶ 5].  He has recently developed an abnormal growth in the rectum which has resulted on occasion \nin dark black blood in feces and obstruction of his bowel.  Although he has made at least three requests \n58 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 59 of 71\n \n190.  Special medical diets are not available to prisoners at FCI Danbury. As a result, \non repeated occasions, special-diet prisoners have received meals containing ingredients \ndangerously harmful to their health, including, for example, delivery of meals containing peanut \nproducts to allergic patients at risk of anaphylaxis, or delivery of meals containing rice and beans \nto prisoners with diverticulosis. [Cassidy Decl. ¶¶ 20, 22; Martinez-Brooks Decl. ¶ 22 (peanut \nbutter was served multiple times in a dorm housing a woman with severe peanut allergy)]. \n191.  As a result of the epidemic, food service has been reduced below BOP guidelines \nfor caloric intake and nutritional value; food reductions put petitioners and putative class \nmembers at heightened risk of adverse health effects. [Cassidy Decl. ¶ 21].64 \n192.  Respondents’ failures to respond appropriately to the coronavirus outbreak in FCI \nDanbury has, likewise, endangered prison staff.  In an “Imminent Danger Report” filed with the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) on March 31, 2020, the President of \nthe union that represents many BOP staff reported health and safety hazards across many BOP \nfacilities – including FCI Danbury – related to COVID-19, including: \na.  Contrary to CDC guidelines, officials have directed staff throughout the BOP who \nhave come into contact with, or been in close proximity to, individuals who show \nor have shown symptoms of COVID-19, to report to work and not self-quarantine \nfor 14 days; \n                                                                                                                                                             \nfor a medical visit to assess and diagnose his condition, he has been advised that his condition is not an \nemergency and that the medical team is currently unavailable to evaluate him. [Id. ¶ 17].   \n64 The COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in worrisome curtailment of prisoners’ legal rights.  \nThe prison law library has been closed and locked and the administrative remedy process has been \nsuspended indefinitely.  Legal mail is being delayed and at times not picked up due to staff shortages.  \nLegal calls are being denied  and legal requests from attorneys are often going unanswered, including for \nopen and pending cases that require access to attorneys such as the development of pleadings in \nconnection with motions for compassionate release. [Cassidy Decl. ¶¶ 25-27]. \n59 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 60 of 71\n \nb.  The BOP has violated CDC Guidelines by continuously moving prisoners by bus \nand/or airlift to various prison sites across the nation, including infected prisoners, \nprisoners suspected of being infected, and prisoners who have been in close \ncontact with, or proximity to, infected prisoners; \nc.  The BOP has failed to introduce workplace controls to mitigate exposure or \nfurther exposure to the virus, such as high efficiency air filters to minimize the \nairborne nature of the virus or otherwise improve ventilation; \nd.  The BOP has failed to minimize contact within recreation areas, education areas, \ncounseling/treatment rooms, resulting in prisoners and staff coming in \ndangerously close contact with each other; and \ne.  The BOP has failed to comply with OSHA Personal Protective Equipment \nStandards.65 \nVII.   FCI Danbury Is Not Prepared to Treat Individuals Who Contract Coronavirus  \n \n193.  Prisoners who do contract COVID-19 are at higher risk for developing acute \nsymptoms than if they were in the community, because FCI Danbury lacks the medical resources \nto care for symptomatic prisoners, creating a continuing unacceptable danger to petitioners and \nputative class members.   \n194.  Now that COVID-19 is inside the facility, FCI Danbury will be unable to stop the \nspread of the virus throughout the facility given long-documented inadequacies in BOP’s \nmedical care and in light of how these facilities function. \n                                                 \n65  Available at https://www.afge.org/globalassets/documents/generalreports/coronavirus/4/osha-\n7-form-national-complaint.pdf . \n60 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 61 of 71\n \n195.  There is no separate medical unit or facility for ill prisoners at the men’s facility \nor either facility for women. Unlike many Federal Correctional Institutions, FCI Danbury has no \nphysical space in which an ill prisoner can convalesce that is separate from other prisoners, \nwarm, clean and has access to fresh water and regular hand-washing. \n196.  On information and belief, FCI Danbury has woefully inadequate numbers of \nnasal swab COVID-19 test kits, requiring correctional staff to ration those few available kits and \nto refuse testing to prisoners clearly exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 infection. As a result of \nthe lack of testing and confirmation of actual infections in the facility, FCI Danbury is failing to \nimplement appropriate isolation practices thus accelerating the spread of the infection within the \ninstitution.66 \n197.  FCI Danbury currently has no ventilators and cannot intubate prisoners on-site.  \nFCI Danbury does not have any specialized equipment or medical providers. \n198.  On information and belief there are only 2 (and possibly fewer) doctors available \nat FCI Danbury to care for all 1,046 prisoners. Even this highly limited number is likely to \ndecrease as doctors themselves go into quarantine. None of these doctors specializes in infectious \ndiseases. \n                                                 \n66  Earlier in April 2020  the warden at Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, a BOP \nfacility, advised in a letter to United States District Judge Paul Engelmayer that MCC could not test a \ndefendant in a matter pending before that court exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms because “MCC New \nYork does not have COVID-19 tests.”  See No COVID-19 tests available for prisoners at center of New \nYork outbreak, court documents show, ABCNews (April 4, 2020, 6:00 am), available at \nhttps://abcnews.go.com/Health/covid-19-tests-prisoners-center-york-outbreak-court/story?id=69969077.  \nAt the same time, Bureau of Prisons officials confirmed to ABC news that FCI Oakdale prisoners \nshowing symptoms in the middle of an outbreak at that facility wouldn’t be tested because tests were too \nscarce.  Id.  At the same time, another federal facility in New York, the Metropolitan Detention Center in \nBrooklyn, court filings before U.S. District Judge Rachel Kovner revealed that only seven of 1,700 \nprisoners in that facility had been tested.  Id. \n61 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 62 of 71\n \n199.  People who contract COVID-19 can deteriorate rapidly, even before a test result \ncan be received. They need constant monitoring. Most people in the higher risk categories will \nrequire more advanced support: positive pressure ventilation, and in extreme cases, \nextracorporeal mechanical oxygenation. Such care requires specialized equipment in limited \nsupply as well as an entire team of specialized care providers. FCI Danbury does not have that \nspecialized equipment or specialized providers. \n200.  FCI Danbury is short-staffed. As of April 25, 2020, 38 staff members have tested \npositive and several more are symptomatic; correctional officers are understandably hesitant to \ncome to work. This staffing shortage will only increase as employees need to stay home to care \nfor children whose schools are closed, elderly family members, and other personal health \nsituations. With fewer staff, correctional officers are less able to monitor prisoners’ health. \nVIII.  The Situation at FCI Danbury Imposes Undue Risks on the Surrounding \nCommunity that result in further harm to the Petitioner Class  \n \n201.  FCI Danbury is located in Fairfield County, Connecticut—the hardest hit area of \nthe State with over 10,500 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection and 707 deaths as of April \n27, 2020.67  \n202.  Diseases in prison put staff and surrounding community at risk. When the \nCOVID-19 virus is introduced to a prison, all persons within the facility – whether they are staff \nor incarcerated people – are at heightened risk of contracting the virus and, in turn, spreading the \nvirus to others with whom they live or come into contact with in their own homes and \nneighborhoods.68  The harm caused by a COVID-19 outbreak in a correctional facility, therefore, \n                                                 \n67  COVID-19 Dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns \nHopkins University (JHU), https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html  \n68  Peter Wagner & Emily Widra, No need to wait for pandemics: The public health case \n62 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 63 of 71\n \nis not confined to those who are incarcerated or work in that facility. Instead, this harm poses a \nserious health risk to the surrounding community on which Petitioner class needs to rely for \nhealth care as well as for general services through staffing of FCI. \n203.  For example, scarce community health resources like emergency departments, \nhospital beds, and ventilators would inevitably become more scarce in the event of a COVID-19 \noutbreak in a detention facility, because incarcerated people are more likely to have underlying \nmedical conditions that carry a significantly increased risk of severe complications from \nCOVID-19. \n204.  A COVID-19 outbreak would exceed the capacity of the local health \ninfrastructure because treatment for serious cases requires significant medical intervention, \nincluding ventilator assistance and intensive care support.  If the need for ICU beds and life-\nsaving medical equipment exceeds supply, the death rate will increase for the entire population \nof Connecticut. \nCLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(Declaratory and Injunctive Relief for \nViolation of the Eighth Amendments) \n \n205.  Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein \n206.  Respondents are holding Petitioners and all putative class members in violation of \nthe Constitution by detaining them in the face of significant threats to their health and safety \nwithout taking sufficient steps to prevent that harm. \n                                                                                                                                                             \nfor criminal justice reform, Prison Policy Initiative (Mar. 6, 2020), \nhttps://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2020/03/06/pandemic/  \n63 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 64 of 71\n \n207.  Respondents’ failure to provide adequate medical care in response to a \nwidespread outbreak of a contagious disease constitutes deliberate indifference to the serious, \nknown medical needs of detainees, thereby establishing a violation of the Eighth Amendment of \nthe United States Constitution. \n208.  Because of the conditions at FCI Danbury, Petitioners are not able to take steps to \nprotect themselves—such as social distancing, using hand sanitizer, washing their hands \nregularly, and disinfecting their surroundings—and the government has not provided adequate \nprotections. As COVID-19 rapidly spreads at FCI Danbury in a matter of days, as experts \npredict, the already deplorable conditions at FCI Danbury will be exacerbated, and the ability to \nprotect oneself will become even more impossible. \n209.  Respondents’ failure adequately to protect Petitioners from these punitive \nconditions, or release them from the conditions altogether, constitutes deliberate indifference to \nthe serious known medical needs of Petitioners, and all members of the Class, thereby \nestablishing a violation of the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution. \n210.  Respondents were aware of the medical needs of the population and the \npervasiveness of prisoners and staff exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms throughout the prison.    \n211.  Respondents knew of and disregarded an excessive risk to health and safety. \n212.  Respondents failed to act with reasonable care to mitigate these risks. \n213.  Because Respondents failed to act to remedy Petitioners’ and the Class’s \ndegrading and inhuman conditions of confinement in violation of their Eighth Amendment \nrights, Petitioners seek relief under this Writ of Habeas Corpus. \n64 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 65 of 71\n \n214.  Because of the unlawful conduct of Respondents, Petitioners and the Class are \nthreatened with imminent physical injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, humiliation, \nand death. \n215.  Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law and will suffer irreparable harm \nunless the court acts immediately to grant the relief requested herein. \nTHE NEED FOR ENLARGEMENT AS A PROVISIONAL REMEDY \n216.  Federal district courts have authority, when habeas actions are pending, to \n“enlarge” the custody of petitioners. Enlargement is not release. Rather, it is a provisional \nremedy that modifies custody by expanding the site at which it takes place, upon order of the \ncourt, from a particular prison to another setting; as requested here, to home confinement. See \nExhibit B, Declaration of Professor Judith Resnik Regarding Enlargement and the Use of \nProvisional Remedies for Detained Individuals ¶¶ 28-29. The enlargement power stems from \nCongress’s authorization of federal judges under the habeas statutes to “summarily hear and \ndetermine the facts, and dispose of the matter as law and justice require” as well as the courts’ \ninherent powers. See 28 U.S.C. § 2243.  \n217.  To qualify for the enlargement remedy, an individual must show “extraordinary \ncircumstances” and that the underlying claim raises “substantial claims.” Mapp v. Reno, 241 \nF.3d 221, 226 (2d Cir. 2001).  \n218.  Petitioners and the putative Subclass members meet these requirements because \nof the extreme risk that COVID-19 poses, especially in light of their ages and medical \nconditions, and because of the particular conditions of confinement at FCI Danbury. If \npetitioners and putative Subclass members remain incarcerated, there is a high risk that they will \n65 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 66 of 71\n \ncontract COVID-19 and, as a result, suffer severe illness or death. Immediate release to permit \npetitioners and putative Subclass members to serve their sentences on home confinement during \nthe pendency of this action is thus the only way to effectuate the eventual habeas remedy.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Petitioners and proposed class members respectfully request that this Court: \na.  Certify the proposed Class and Subclass pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23(B)(1) \nand (B)(2); \nb.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2243 and this Court’s inherent powers, enlarge petitioners \nand Subclass members pending disposition of the underlying petition; \nc.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2243 and issued “forthwith,” issue an Order to Show \nCause requiring Respondents to identify within twenty-four (24) hours of the \nCourt’s order, and submit to the Court a list of, all Subclass members, and \nrequiring Respondents to answer as to why the habeas petition and relief sought \nherein should not be granted; \nd.  Issue a Writ of Habeas Corpus and/or pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 65, enter a \ntemporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction \nrequiring Respondents to release from custody or to home confinement members \nof the Subclass and requiring Respondents to provide medically adequate social \ndistancing and health care and sanitation for members of the Class who remain; \ne.

Appoint a special master pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 63 or an expert under \nFederal Rule of Evidence 706 to make recommendations to the Court regarding \nthe number of incarcerated people that FCI Danbury can house consistent with \nCDC Guidance on best social distancing and hygiene practices to prevent the \nspread of COVID-19. \ng.  Issue a Writ of Habeas Corpus and/or pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65 enter an \ninjunction requiring Respondents to:  \n1.  Ensure that incarcerated individuals can remain six feet apart to \npractice social distancing in compliance with CDC Guidance; \n2.  Ensure that each incarcerated individual receives a free and \nadequate personal supply of: hand soap sufficient to permit frequent \nhand washing, paper towels, facial tissues, cleaning implements such \nas sponges or brushes, and disinfectant products that are effective \nagainst COVID-19; \n3.  Ensure that all individuals have access to hand sanitizer containing \nat least 60% alcohol; \n4.  Provide daily access to showers and clean laundry, including clean \ntowels after each shower; \n5.  Require that all FCI Danbury staff wear PPE consistent with the \nCDC Guidance, including masks and gloves, when interacting with \nvisitors and incarcerated individuals or when touching surfaces in \ncommon areas; \n67 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 68 of 71\n \n6.  Provide an anonymous mechanism for incarcerated individuals to \nreport staff who violate these guidelines so that appropriate corrective \naction may be taken; \n7.  Take each incarcerated person's temperature daily (with a properly \ndisinfected and accurate thermometer) to identify potential COVID-19 \ninfections; \n8.  Assess each incarcerated individual daily through questioning to \nidentify potential COVID-19 infections; \n9.  Conduct immediate testing for anyone displaying known \nsymptoms of COVID-19; \n10.  Immediately provide clean masks for all individuals who display \nor report potential COVID-19 symptoms until they can be evaluated \nby a qualified medical professional or placed in non-punitive \nquarantine and ensure the masks are properly laundered with \nreplacements as necessary; \n11.  Ensure that individuals identified as having COVID-19 or having \nbeen exposed to COVID-19 are properly quarantined in a non-punitive \nsetting, with continued access to showers, recreation, mental health \nservices, reading materials, commissary, phone and video visitation \nwith loved ones, communication with counsel, and personal property; \n12.  Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces with disinfectant \nproducts effective against the virus that causes COVID-19 (at the \n68 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 69 of 71\n \nmanufacturer's recommended concentration), as well as surfaces in \ncommon areas, every two hours during waking hours, and at least once \nduring the night; \n13.  Ensure incarcerated people are provided guidance on how to \nprotect themselves from COVID-19 and reduce COVID-19 \ntransmission; \n14.  Assure incarcerated people are told that they will not be retaliated \nagainst for reporting COVID-19 symptoms; \n15.  Respond to all emergency (as defined by the medical \ncommunity)requests for medical attention within an hour; \n16.  Provide incarcerated individuals with sufficient and effective \ncleaning supplies free of charge so that they may clean frequently \ntouched items, such as phones, before use; \n17.  Provide frequent communication to all incarcerated individuals \nregarding COVID-19, measures taken to reduce the risk of infection, \nbest practices for incarcerated people to avoid infection, and any \nchanges in policies or practices; \n18.

Background and Qualifications \n \n1.  I am Dr. Jaimie Meyer, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Yale School of Medicine \nand Assistant Clinical Professor of Nursing at Yale School of Nursing in New Haven, \nConnecticut. I am board certified in Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases and Addiction \nMedicine.  I completed my residency in Internal Medicine at NY Presbyterian Hospital at \nColumbia, New York, in 2008. I completed a fellowship in clinical Infectious Diseases at \nYale School of Medicine in 2011 and a fellowship in Interdisciplinary HIV Prevention at \nthe Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS in 2012. I hold a Master of Science in \nBiostatistics and Epidemiology from Yale School of Public Health. \n2.  I have worked for over a decade on infectious diseases in the context of jails and prisons. \nFrom 2008-2016, I served as the Infectious Disease physician for York Correctional \nInstitution in Niantic, Connecticut, which is the only state jail and prison for women in \nConnecticut.  In that capacity, I was responsible for the management of HIV, Hepatitis C, \ntuberculosis, and other infectious diseases in the facility.  Since then, I have maintained a \ndedicated HIV clinic in the community for patients returning home from prison and jail.  \nFor over a decade, I have been continuously funded by the NIH, industry, and \nfoundations for clinical research on HIV prevention and treatment for people involved in \nthe criminal justice system, including those incarcerated in closed settings (jails and \nprisons) and in the community under supervision (probation and parole).  I have served as \nan expert consultant on infectious diseases and women’s health in jails and prisons for the \nUN Office on Drugs and Crimes, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and others.  I also served \nas an expert health witness for the US Commission on Civil Rights Special Briefing on \nWomen in Prison.      \n3.  I have written and published extensively on the topics of infectious diseases among \npeople involved in the criminal justice system including book chapters and articles in \nleading peer-reviewed journals (including Lancet HIV, JAMA Internal Medicine, \nAmerican Journal of Public Health, International Journal of Drug Policy) on issues of \nprevention, diagnosis, and management of HIV, Hepatitis C, and other infectious diseases \namong people involved in the criminal justice system.  In making the following \nstatements, I am not commenting on the particular issues posed this case. Rather, I am \nmaking general statements about the realities of persons in detention facilities, jails and \nprisons. \n4.  My C.V. includes a full list of my honors, experience, and publications, and it is attached \nas Exhibit A.  \n5.  I was paid $1,000 for my time drafting an earlier version of this report filed in another \ncase. I subsequently prepared this version of the report without receiving payment for my \nservices. \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 9\n \n6.  I testified as an expert at a single trial or by deposition in the past four years: State v. \nFrank Sanville, Docket No. 263-3-18 Wrcr (Vermont) on April 21, 2020. \nII.  Heightened Risk of Epidemics in Jails and Prisons \n \n7.  The risk posed by infectious diseases in jails and prisons is significantly higher than in \nthe community, both in terms of risk of transmission, exposure, and harm to individuals \nwho become infected. There are several reasons this is the case, as delineated further \nbelow.    \n8.  Globally, outbreaks of contagious diseases are all too common in closed detention \nsettings and are more common than in the community at large.  Prisons and jails are not \nisolated from communities.  Staff, visitors, contractors, and vendors pass between \ncommunities and facilities and can bring infectious diseases into facilities.  Moreover, \nrapid turnover of jail and prison populations means that people often cycle between \nfacilities and communities.  People often need to be transported to and from facilities to \nattend court and move between facilities.  Prison health is public health. \n9.  Reduced prevention opportunities: Congregate settings such as jails and prisons allow for \nrapid spread of infectious diseases that are transmitted person to person, especially those \npassed by droplets through coughing and sneezing. When people must share dining halls, \nbathrooms, showers, and other common areas, the opportunities for transmission are \ngreater. When infectious diseases are transmitted from person to person by droplets, the \nbest initial strategy is to practice social distancing.  When jailed or imprisoned, people \nhave much less of an opportunity to protect themselves by social distancing than they \nwould in the community. Spaces within jails and prisons are often also poorly ventilated, \nwhich promotes highly efficient spread of diseases through droplets. Placing someone in \nsuch a setting therefore dramatically reduces their ability to protect themselves from \nbeing exposed to and acquiring infectious diseases.  \n10. Disciplinary segregation or solitary confinement is not an effective disease containment \nstrategy.  Beyond the known detrimental mental health effects of solitary confinement, \nisolation of people who are ill in solitary confinement results in decreased medical \nattention and increased risk of death.  Isolation of people who are ill using solitary \nconfinement also is an ineffective way to prevent transmission of the virus through \ndroplets to others because, except in specialized negative pressure rooms (rarely in \nmedical units if available at all), air continues to flow outward from rooms to the rest of \nthe facility.  Risk of exposure is thus increased to other people in prison and staff.  \n11. Reduced prevention opportunities: During an infectious disease outbreak, people can \nprotect themselves by washing hands.  Jails and prisons do not provide adequate \nopportunities to exercise necessary hygiene measures, such as frequent handwashing or \nuse of alcohol-based sanitizers when handwashing is unavailable.  Jails and prisons are \noften under-resourced and ill-equipped with sufficient hand soap and alcohol-based \nsanitizers for people detained in and working in these settings.  High-touch surfaces \n(doorknobs, light switches, etc.) should also be cleaned and disinfected regularly with \nbleach to prevent virus spread, but this is often not done in jails and prisons because of a \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 9\n \nlack of cleaning supplies and lack of people available to perform necessary cleaning \nprocedures.  \n12. Reduced prevention opportunities: During an infectious disease outbreak, a containment \nstrategy requires people who are ill with symptoms to be isolated and that caregivers have \naccess to personal protective equipment, including gloves, masks, gowns, and eye \nshields.  Jails and prisons are often under-resourced and ill-equipped to provide sufficient \npersonal protective equipment for people who are incarcerated and caregiving staff, \nincreasing the risk for everyone in the facility of a widespread outbreak.  \n13. Increased susceptibility: People incarcerated in jails and prisons are more susceptible to \nacquiring and experiencing complications from infectious diseases than the population in \nthe community.1 This is because people in jails and prisons are more likely than people in \nthe community to have chronic underlying health conditions, including diabetes, heart \ndisease, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, and lower immune systems from \nHIV. \n14. Jails and prisons are often poorly equipped to diagnose and manage infectious disease \noutbreaks.  Some jails and prisons lack onsite medical facilities or 24-hour medical care.  \nThe medical facilities at jails and prisons are almost never sufficiently equipped to handle \nlarge outbreaks of infectious diseases. To prevent transmission of droplet-borne \ninfectious diseases, people who are infected and ill need to be isolated in specialized \nairborne negative pressure rooms.  Most jails and prisons have few negative pressure \nrooms if any, and these may be already in use by people with other conditions (including \ntuberculosis or influenza).  Resources will become exhausted rapidly and any beds \navailable will soon be at capacity. This makes both containing the illness and caring for \nthose who have become infected much more difficult. \n15. Jails and prisons lack access to vital community resources to diagnose and manage \ninfectious diseases. Jails and prisons do not have access to community health resources \nthat can be crucial in identifying and managing widespread outbreaks of infectious \ndiseases.  This includes access to testing equipment, laboratories, and medications. \n16. Jails and prisons often need to rely on outside facilities (hospitals, emergency \ndepartments) to provide intensive medical care given that the level of care they can \nprovide in the facility itself is typically relatively limited. During an epidemic, this will \nnot be possible, as those outside facilities will likely be at or over capacity themselves.   \n17. Health safety: As an outbreak spreads through jails, prisons, and communities, medical \npersonnel become sick and do not show up to work. Absenteeism means that facilities \ncan become dangerously understaffed with healthcare providers. This increases a number \nof risks and can dramatically reduce the level of care provided.  As health systems inside \nfacilities are taxed, people with chronic underlying physical and mental health conditions \nand serious medical needs may not be able to receive the care they need for these \n                                                 \n1 Active case finding for communicable diseases in prisons, 391 The Lancet 2186 (2018), \nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31251-0/fulltext. \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 5 of 9\n \nconditions.  As supply chains become disrupted during a global pandemic, the availability \nof medicines and food may be limited. \n18. Safety and security: As an outbreak spreads through jails, prisons, and communities, \ncorrectional officers and other security personnel become sick and do not show up to \nwork.  Absenteeism poses substantial safety and security risk to both the people inside \nthe facilities and the public.   \n19. These risks have all been borne out during past epidemics of influenza in jails and \nprisons. For example, in 2012, the CDC reported an outbreak of influenza in 2 facilities \nin Maine, resulting in two inmate deaths.2  Subsequent CDC investigation of 995 inmates \nand 235 staff members across the 2 facilities discovered insufficient supplies of influenza \nvaccine and antiviral drugs for treatment of people who were ill and prophylaxis for \npeople who were exposed.  During the H1N1-strain flu outbreak in 2009 (known as the \n“swine flu”), jails and prisons experienced a disproportionately high number of cases.3  \nEven facilities on “quarantine” continued to accept new intakes, rendering the quarantine \nincomplete. These scenarios occurred in the “best case” of influenza, a viral infection for \nwhich there was an effective and available vaccine and antiviral medications, unlike \nCOVID-19, for which there is currently neither. \nIII.  Profile of COVID-19 as an Infectious Disease4 \n \n20.  The novel coronavirus, officially known as SARS-CoV-2, causes a disease known as \nCOVID-19.  The virus is thought to pass from person to person primarily through \nrespiratory droplets (by coughing or sneezing) but may also survive on inanimate \nsurfaces.  People seem to be most able to transmit the virus to others when they are \nsickest but it is possible that people can transmit the virus before they start to show \nsymptoms or for weeks after their symptoms resolve.  In China, where COVID-19 \noriginated, the average infected person passed the virus on to 2-3 other people; \ntransmission occurred at a distance of 3-6 feet.  Not only is the virus very efficient at \nbeing transmitted through droplets, everyone is at risk of infection because our immune \nsystems have never been exposed to or developed protective responses against this virus. \nA vaccine is currently in development but will likely not be able for another year to the \n                                                 \n2 Influenza Outbreaks at Two Correctional Facilities — Maine, March 2011, Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention (2012), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6113a3.htm. \n3 David M.

Antiviral medications are currently in testing but not yet FDA-approved, \nso only available for compassionate use from the manufacturer.  People in prison and jail \nwill likely have even less access to these novel health strategies as they become available. \n21. Most people (80%) who become infected with COVID-19 will develop a mild upper \nrespiratory infection but emerging data from China suggests serious illness occurs in up \nto 16% of cases, including death.5  Serious illness and death is most common among \npeople with underlying chronic health conditions, like heart disease, lung disease, liver \ndisease, and diabetes, and older age.6  Death in COVID-19 infection is usually due to \npneumonia and sepsis.  The emergence of COVID-19 during influenza season means that \npeople are also at risk from serious illness and death due to influenza, especially when \nthey have not received the influenza vaccine or the pneumonia vaccine. \n22. The care of people who are infected with COVID-19 depends on how seriously they are \nill.7  People with mild symptoms may not require hospitalization but may continue to be \nclosely monitored at home.  People with moderate symptoms may require hospitalization \nfor supportive care, including intravenous fluids and supplemental oxygen.  People with \nsevere symptoms may require ventilation and intravenous antibiotics. Public health \nofficials anticipate that hospital settings will likely be overwhelmed and beyond capacity \nto provide this type of intensive care as COVID-19 becomes more widespread in \ncommunities. \n23. COVID-19 prevention strategies include containment and mitigation.  Containment \nrequires intensive hand washing practices, decontamination and aggressive cleaning of \nsurfaces, and identifying and isolating people who are ill or who have had contact with \npeople who are ill, including the use of personal protective equipment.  Jails and prisons \nare totally under-resourced to meet the demand for any of these strategies.  As infectious \ndiseases spread in the community, public health demands mitigation strategies, which \ninvolves social distancing and closing other communal spaces (schools, workplaces, etc.) \nto protect those most vulnerable to disease.  Jails and prisons are unable to adequately \nprovide social distancing or meet mitigation recommendations as described above. \n24. The time to act is now. Data from other settings demonstrate what happens when jails \nand prisons are unprepared for COVID-19. To date, few  state or federal prison systems \nhave adequate (or any) pandemic preparedness plans in place. Systems are just \nbeginning to screen and isolate people on entry and perhaps place visitor restrictions, \nbut this is wholly inadequate when staff and vendors can still come to work sick and \n                                                 \n5 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Situation Summary, Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (March 14, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary.html. \n6 Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, \nChina: a retrospective cohort study.

Systems are challenged to respond to COVID-19 guidelines that are modified on a near-\ndaily basis. It may be impossible to adequately respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, \nwhile also respecting the rights and dignity of people who are incarcerated.    \nIV.  Possible Risks of COVID-19 in Federal Bureau of Prisons Facilities in Danbury, \nConnecticut \n \n26. From approximately 2017-2018, I volunteered to provide AIDS Awareness Programming \nfor all women housed at the Camp and the Satellite Low (FSL) facilities at FCI Danbury.  \nIn doing so, I interacted with the resident inmates in common meetings areas on a \nmonthly basis in groups as small as 10 and as large as 100.  I have additionally toured all \nareas of the FSL facility in January 2018 with leadership from the National Association \nof Women Judges.  I last entered the facilities in approximately Summer 2018. \n27. The FSL facility is comprised of a single large dormitory style room, in which all of the \nwomen sleep on bunks.  There is also a library, a laundry room, a group meeting area, \nand a space for exercise.  In the adjoining building, there are multiple classrooms and \nmeeting spaces.  There was an infirmary staffed intermittently by a physician or nurse \npractitioner, who was available for sick call.  For other medical needs, women were \nbrought into the men’s facility to see the healthcare provider by appointment.  All serious \nmedical needs and specialty visits were referred to the nearby Danbury Hospital.  Per the \nBOP webpage, as of April 23, 2020, there were 165 women housed at FSL.  The layout \nof the space would make it impossible for these women to practice social distancing. \n28. When I last visited the Camp, it was comprised of a single floor of cells, each of which \nheld 2-3 women.  I understand that the building has since been reconfigured and the \nwomen are now housed in large dormitory style rooms. Per the BOP webpage, as of April \n23, 2020, there were 153 women housed at the Camp.  Dormitory style housing makes it \nimpossible for prisoners to practice social distancing. \n29.  Per BOP reports, as of April 23, 2020, there are 15 inmates with confirmed COVID-19 \ninfection, 32 staff members, and 1 death.  These numbers do not include the number of \ninmates and staff who previously tested positive and have since recovered.  For example, \non April 15, a news article said that BOP reported 44 inmates and 39 staff infected at FCI \nDanbury. It is unclear in which compound the COVID+ inmates resided on the Danbury \nBOP campus.  Given that all spaces in both women’s facilities on the Danbury BOP \ncampus are communal, there is high likelihood that if a single case entered the facility, \nmany more will follow in what some have called a “tinderbox scenario.” The large \nnumber of cases in FCI Danbury to date reflects widespread disease in the surrounding \ncommunity and is evidence that FCI Danbury is unable to mitigate or contain the spread \nof disease.  \n \n30. During my visit to FSL in January 2018, I had the opportunity to meet with many of the \nwomen to discuss their experiences of confinement without any correctional officers \npresent.  The women I met with had significant medical issues, including serious \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 8 of 9\n \ncardiovascular, neurologic, and psychiatric conditions.  They described significant delays \nin receiving medical attention for issues both large and small.  Any delays in access to \ncare that already exist in normal circumstances will only become worse during an \noutbreak, making it especially difficult for the facilities to contain any infections and to \ntreat those who are infected. \n31. Failure to provide individuals with continuation of the treatment they were receiving in \nthe community, or even just interruption of treatment, for chronic underlying health \nconditions will result in increased risk of morbidity and mortality related to these chronic \nconditions.  \n32. Failure to provide individuals adequate medical care for their underlying chronic health \nconditions results in increased risk of COVID-19 infection and increased risk of \ninfection-related morbidity and mortality if they do become infected. \n33. People with underlying chronic mental health conditions need adequate access to \ntreatment for these conditions throughout their period of detention.  Failure to provide \nadequate mental health care, as may happen when health systems in jails and prisons are \ntaxed by COVID-19 outbreaks, may result in poor health outcomes.  Moreover, mental \nhealth conditions may be exacerbated by the stress of incarceration during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including isolation and lack of visitation.  \n34. Failure to keep accurate and sufficient medical records will make it more difficult for \nfacilities to identify vulnerable individuals in order to both monitor their health and \nprotect them from infection.  Inadequate screening and testing procedures in facilities \nincrease the widespread COVID-19 transmission.  \n35. Many women at FSL spoke only Spanish and reported significant challenges \nparticipating in groups and classes, which were at the time only offered in English.  \nLanguage barriers will similarly prevent the effective identification of individuals who \nare particularly vulnerable or may have symptoms of COVID-19. Similarly, the failure to \nprovide necessary aids to individuals who have auditory or visual disabilities could also \nlimit the ability to identify and monitor symptoms of COVID-19.   \n36. Facilities with a track record of neglecting individuals with acute pain and serious health \nneeds under ordinary circumstances are more likely to be ill-equipped to identify, \nmonitor, and treat a COVID-19 epidemic. \n37. Similarly, facilities with a track record of failing to adequately manage single individuals \nin need of emergency care are more likely to be seriously ill-equipped and under-\nprepared when a number of people will need urgent care simultaneously, as would occur \nduring a COVID-19 epidemic.  \n38. For individuals in facilities that have experienced these problems in the past, the \nexperience of an epidemic and the lack of care while effectively trapped can itself be \ntraumatizing, compounding the trauma of incarceration.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 9 of 9\n \nV.  Conclusion and Recommendations \n \n39. Reducing the size of the population in jails and prisons is crucial to reducing the level of \nrisk both for those within those facilities and for the community at large. As such, from a \npublic health perspective, it is my recommendation that individuals who can safely and \nappropriately remain in the community not be placed in BOP facilities at this time. I also \nrecommend that individuals who are already in these facilities should be evaluated for \nrelease. \n40. This is more important still for individuals with preexisting conditions (e.g., heart disease \nand hypertension, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, suppressed immune system, \nmorbid obesity, diabetes) or who are over the age of 65.  \n41. Health in jails and prisons is community health. Protecting the health of individuals who \nare detained in and work in these facilities is vital to protecting the health of the wider \ncommunity.  \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \n \n \nApril 2__4, 2020           _______________________ \nWilton, Connecticut           Dr. Jaimie Meyer \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-2   Filed 04/27/20   Page 1 of 14\nEXHIBIT \nB\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-2   Filed 04/27/20   Page 2 of 14\n1 \n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDECLARATION OF PROFESSOR JUDITH RESNIK REGARDING  \nENLARGEMENT AND THE USE OF PROVISIONAL REMEDIES FOR DETAINED \nINDIVIDUALS \n \n \nI have been asked to make this declaration to explain my \nunderstanding  of  the  remedies, both  provisional  and  permanent, \nthat federal judges can provide to people who are incarcerated and \nfacing the threat of COVID-19. Because I have practiced in the \nDistrict  of  Connecticut  for  decades  and  represented  prisoners \nbefore the federal court here, I have had personal experience with \nthe use of enlargement in habeas corpus cases. Given that this \nprovisional  remedy  is  not  regularly  discussed  in  reported \ndecisions or in academic analyses, I believe that my experiences \nand knowledge can be useful to the Court. This opinion is mine and \nis not that of the institutions with which I am affiliated. I \ndeclare that the following is a true and accurate account of my \nown  work  as  a  lawyer,  of  the  pertinent  legal  principles  as  I \nunderstand  them,  and  of  how  these  precepts  can  apply  in  this \nunprecedented context. \n \n \nMy Background \n \n     \n1.  I have worked on occasion as a lawyer, including in the \nclinical programs at Yale Law School and at U.S.C. I have appeared \nbefore the United States Supreme Court and in federal district and \nappellate courts. I have also been appointed by federal judges to \nassist  in  issues  arising  in  large-scale  litigation.  Below,  I \nprovide a few aspects of my work particularly relevant to this \ndeclaration. I attach my resume as Exhibit A to this Declaration. \n \n2.  From 1977 until 1980, I was a supervising attorney at \nYale  Law  School’s  clinical  program,  which  then  provided  legal \nservices to federal prisoners housed at F.C.I. Danbury. \n \n3.  I am now the Arthur Liman Professor of Law at Yale Law \nSchool  where  I  teach  courses,  including  on  federal  and  state \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-2   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 14\n2 \n \ncourts;  procedure;  large-scale  litigation;  federalism;  and \nincarceration.  \n \n4.  I have taught law for decades. Much of my focus has been \non  the  role  and  function  of  courts,  and  the  relationship  of \ngovernments  to  their  populations.  I  regularly  teach  the  class \nentitled Federal and State Courts in the Federal System. Readings \nfor students include materials on habeas corpus and on civil rights \nlitigation. \n \n5.  In 2018, I was awarded an Andrew Carnegie Fellowship to \nwork on a book, tentatively entitled Impermissible Punishments, \nwhich explores the impact of the 1960s civil rights revolution on \nthe kinds of punishments that governments can impose on people \nconvicted of crimes. Central to this book is the role that access \nto courts played for people held in detention.  \n \n6.  I am the Founding Director of the Arthur Liman Center \nfor Public Interest Law. The Liman Center teaches classes yearly, \nconvenes colloquia, does research projects, supports graduates of \nYale  Law  School  to  work  for  one  year  in  public  interest \norganizations, and is an umbrella for undergraduate fellowships at \neight institutions of higher education. \n \n7.  I  write  about  the  federal  courts;  adjudication  and \nalternatives such as arbitration; habeas corpus and incarceration; \nclass actions and multi-district litigation; the judicial role and \ncourts’  remedies;  gender  and  equality;  and  about  transnational \naspects of these issues. In recent years, I have spent a good deal \nof time doing research related to prisons. I have helped to develop \na series of reports that provide information nation-wide on the \nuse of solitary confinement. \n \n8.  In  February  of  2019,  I  testified  before  the  U.S. \nCommission on Civil Rights at its hearing on women in prison and \nco-authored a statement related to the isolation of many facilities \nfor women, their needs for education and work training, and the \ndiscipline to which they are subjected. See Statement submitted \nfor  the  record,  Women  in  Prison:  Seeking  Justice  Behind  Bars, \nbefore the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, March 22, 2019. The \nreport, published a few months ago, reference this testimony. See \nU.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Women in Prison: Seeking Justice \nBehind  Bars  (February  2020),  available  at \nhttps://www.usccr.gov/pubs/2020/02-26-Women-in-Prison.pdf. \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-2   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 14\n3 \n \nRemedies Available in the Federal Courts: \nHabeas Corpus, Civil Rights Litigation, and Enlargement \n \n9.  In light of my knowledge of the federal law of habeas \ncorpus,  state  and  federal  court  relations,  procedure,  and \nremedies,  I  have  been  asked  by  counsel  for  the \npetitioners/plaintiffs to address the range of responses available \nto judges presiding in cases that raise claims related to COVID-\n19. \n \n10.  As I understand from public materials on the health risks \nof this disease, COVID-19 poses a deadly threat to the well-being \nand lives of people who contract this disease. To reduce the risk \nand spread of this disease, our governments have instructed us to \nstay  distant  from  others  and  to  take  measures  that  are \nextraordinary departures from our daily lives and routines. \n \n11.  Applying  these  urgent  medical  directives  to  prisons \nposes challenges in every jurisdiction. Governing legal principles \nabout prisoners’ access to courts were not framed to address COVID-\n19’s reality: that being inside prisons that are densely populated \ncan put large numbers of people (prisoners and staff) at risk of \nimmediate serious illness and potential death. \n \n12.  These unprecedented risks from and harms of COVID-19 in \nprison raise a new legal question: whether COVID-19 has turned \nsentences  which,  when  imposed,  were  (or  may  have  been) \nconstitutional into unconstitutional sentences during the pendency \nof this crisis.   \n \n13.  When  sentencing  people  to  a  term  of  years  of \nincarceration, judges had no authority to impose putting a person \nat  grave  risk  of  serious  illness  and  death  as  part  of  the \npunishment for the offense. Now, such grave risks and harms can \narise from the fact of incarceration. \n \n14.  A recent Supreme Court case, Montgomery v. Louisiana, \n136  S.Ct.  718  (2016),  provides  an  analogous  situation  -  a \nconstitutional-when-sentenced but unconstitutional-now sentence. \nThe Court determined that, in light of new understandings of the \nlimits of brain development in juveniles, sentences of life without \nparole (LWOP) imposed on individuals who had committed crimes when \nunder  the  age  of  eighteen  were  lawful  when  issued  but  became \nunconstitutional. As a consequence, parole boards or courts had to \nreconsider whether LWOP remained appropriate. COVID-19 raises a \nparallel  question,  as  it  requires  courts  to  address  whether \nsentences lawful at imposition can (at least temporarily) no longer \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-2   Filed 04/27/20   Page 5 of 14\n4 \n \nbe served in prisons because otherwise, the sentence would become \nan unconstitutional form of punishment. In normal times, using \nMontgomery v. Louisiana as a guide, federal judges could remit \neligible individuals to state courts and parole boards. But in \nthese abnormal times, the speed at which decisions are made is \ncritical.  Therefore,  as  I  discuss  below,  provisional  remedies \n(enabling enlargement and release for some individuals and de-\ndensifying for others) are necessary.  \n \n15.  The  classic  and  longstanding  remedy  for  relief  from \nunconstitutional detention, conviction, and sentences is habeas \ncorpus. The Constitution enshrined the remedy of habeas corpus, \nwhich has a substantial common law history and is codified in \nfederal statutes. See generally Paul D. Halliday, Habeas Corpus \n(Harvard U. Press, 2012); Amanda L. Tyler, Habeas Corpus in Wartime \n(Oxford U. Press, 2017); Randy Hertz and James Liebman, Federal \nHabeas Corpus Practice and Procedure (2 volumes, 2019); Hart & \nWechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System, Chapter X1, \n1193-1164  (Richard  H.  Fallon,  Jr,  John  F.  Manning,  Daniel  J. \nMeltzer & David Shapiro, 7th ed., 2015). These citations are the \ntip of a vast and substantial literature that aims to understand \nthe history and law of habeas corpus. \n \n \nThe Legal Thicket \n \n16.  As is familiar, in federal courts, federal petitioners \nfile under 28 U.S.C. §2255 (post-conviction motions) and under \n§2241  (the  general  habeas  statute),  both  of  which  are  civil \nactions.  \n \n17.  For example, when I worked at Yale Law School in its \nclinical program in the late 1970s, we filed lawsuits for federal \nprisoners predicated on 28 U.S.C. §2241 as well as (in appropriate \nsituations) on 28 U.S.C. §1331 (general question jurisdiction) and \n28 U.S.C. §1361 (mandamus), and in several instances, we filed \ncases  as  class  actions.  In  the  mid-1970s,  the  Supreme  Court \nprovided rules and forms for §2254 and §2255 filings. The Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure supplement those rules.  \n \n18.  Congress  has  recognized  that  federal  judges  are \nauthorized  under  the  habeas  statutes  to  “summarily  hear  and \ndetermine the facts, and dispose of the matter as law and justice \nrequire.”  See  28  U.S.C.  §2243.  In  addition  to  this  statutory \nauthority,  federal  judicial  power  is  predicated  on  the \nconstitutional protection of the writ and on the common law. \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-2   Filed 04/27/20   Page 6 of 14\n5 \n \n19.  Congress has channeled and circumscribed some of federal \njudicial authority through the Antiterrorism and Effective Death \nPenalty  Act  of  1996  (AEDPA)  and,  relatedly,  under  the  Prison \nLitigation Reform Act (PLRA) of 1996. Moreover, the Supreme Court \nhas issued many decisions interpreting the prior habeas statutes, \nthe 1996 revisions in AEDPA, and the intersection of habeas and \ncivil rights claims brought under 42 U.S.C. §1983. The result is \na  dense  arena  of  law  and  doctrine  that  can  be  daunting  for \nlitigants and jurists alike. \n \n20.  Some Supreme Court decisions, written to address claims \nby state prisoners, have delineated litigation focused on the fact \nor duration of confinement, for which release is the remedy and \nhabeas is the preferred route, from challenges to conditions of \nconfinement, for which the Court has required use of 42 U.S.C. \n§1983. See, e.g., Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475 (1978); Heck \nv. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994).  Yet that distinction is hard to \napply,  and  many  opinions  have  identified  that  the  overlap,  as \nexemplified by Mohammad v. Close, 540 U.S. 744 (2004), Wilkinson \nv. Dotson, 544 U.S. 74 (2005), and by other Supreme Court and lower \ncourt decisions. \n \n21.  COVID-19 poses a new and painful context in which to \nundertake that analysis. Some reported decisions addressing the \nconstitutional  right  of  prisoners  that  officials  not  be \n“deliberately indifferent to serious medical needs” consider those \nEighth Amendment claims to be appropriate for §1983 because they \nrelate  to  conditions.  But  this  deadly  disease  turns  ordinary \nconditions into potentially lethal threats of illness for which \nthe  remedy  to  consider  is  release  of  at  least  some  prisoners \nbecause density puts people at medical risk.  \n \n22.  Because COVID-19 can end people’s lives unexpectedly and \nabruptly, COVID-19 claims turn the condition of being incarcerated \ninto a practice that affects the fact or duration of confinement. \nIn my view, COVID-19 claims, therefore, collapse the utility and \npurpose  of  drawing  distinctions  between  what  once  could  more \ncoherently be distinguished.  \n \n23.  Courts need also to consider how COVID-19 fits (or not) \nwith provisions of AEDPA and the parameters of the PLRA. Again, \nnew problems have emerged. For example, in some contexts for state \nand federal prisoners, a question of exhaustion of remedies arises. \nOften one issue is the ability of the executive branch to respond \nquickly. In the COVID context, day by day, the risk of illness \nincreases  for  prisoners  and  staff,  which  endanger  health  care \nresources.  Exhaustion  would  be  “futile”  if  other  branches  of \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-2   Filed 04/27/20   Page 7 of 14\n6 \n \ngovernment are not prompt in response and if people become sick, \nrisks skyrocket, and deaths occur.  \n \n24.  “Futility” thus needs to be analyzed in terms not only \nof the capacity of institutions but in terms of the likelihood \nthat the people seeking relief will be well enough to have the \ncapacity to do so, and that the remedy provided will be effective \ngiven the alleged harm. \n  \n25.  Other  legal  issues  include  when  class  actions  are \nappropriate and the criteria of Rule 23 are met; the merits of \narguments about unconstitutional sentences and conditions; and the \nrange of remedies.  \n \n \nThe Availability of Provisional Remedies \n \n26.  The  reason  to  flag  some  of  the  many  issues  that \nlitigation of both habeas petitions and civil rights cases entail \nis  to  underscore  the  importance  of  considering  provisional \nremedies when cases are pending. In general, time is required for \nlawyers to brief and for judges to interpret and apply the law. \nBut waiting days in a world of COVID infections can result in the \nloss of life. \n \n27.  While courts have not faced COVID before, they have faced \nurgent situations, which is why provisional legal remedies exist. \nCourts have two ways to preserve the status quo – which here means \nprotecting to the extent possible the health of prisoners, staff, \nand  providers  of  medical  services.  One  route  is  the  use  of \ntemporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions. These \nremedies  require  no  explanation  because  they  are  familiar \nprocedures. See Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 65. \n \n28.  Another option is an aspect of federal judicial power \nthat is less well known. District courts have authority when habeas \npetitions are pending to “enlarge” the custody of petitioners. \n“Enlargement” is a term that, as far as I am aware, is used only \nin the context of habeas. (More familiar terms for individuals \npermitted to leave detention are “release” and “bail,” and some \ndecision that “enlarge” petitioners use those words rather than \nenlargement). \n \n29.  The distinction is that enlargement is not release. The \nperson remains in custody - even as the place of custody is changed \nand thus “enlarged” from a particular prison to a hospital, half-\nway house, a person’s home, or other setting. Enlargement is a \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-2   Filed 04/27/20   Page 8 of 14\n7 \n \nprovisional remedy that modifies custody by expanding the site in \nwhich it takes place. In some ways, enlargement resembles a prison \nfurlough. \n \n30.  Enlargement  has  special  relevance  when  the  PLRA  has \napplication. As I understand the PLRA’s rules on the “release” of \nprisoners, enlargement would not apply, as enlargement is not a \nrelease order. And, of course, interpreting the many directives of \nthe  PLRA  in  light  of  COVID  entails  more  elaboration  that  my \ncomments here. \n \n31.   The need to work through that statute and case law is \nanother reason why the availability of provisional remedies is so \nimportant. Enlargement provides an opportunity for increasing the \nsafety of prisoners, staff, and their communities while judges \nconsider a myriad of complex legal questions. \n \n32.  I  first  encountered  the  provisional  remedy  of \nenlargement in the 1970s, when I represented a prisoner – Robert \nDrayton – who was confined at F.C.I. Danbury and who filed a habeas \npetition  alleging  that  the  U.S.  Parole  Commission  had \nunconstitutionally rescinded his parole.  \n \n33.  The Honorable T.F. Gilroy Daly, a federal judge sitting \nin the District of Connecticut, granted Mr. Drayton’s request for \nenlargement  while  the  decision  on  the  merits  was  pending.  Mr. \nDrayton returned to his home in Philadelphia and came back to \nConnecticut for the merits hearing. Judge Daly thereafter ruled in \nhis favor; that decision was upheld in part and reversed in part. \nSee Drayton v. U.S. Parole Commission, 445 F. Supp. 305 (D. Conn. \n1978), affirmed in part, Drayton v. McCall, 584 F.2d 1208 (2d Cir. \n1978). \n \n34.  Judge  Daly  did  not  write  a  decision  explaining  the \nenlargement.  Given that I knew that the use of enlargement was \nnot always recorded in published decisions and that enlargement \nhad special relevance here, I decided I should learn more about \nother courts’ discussion of this provisional remedy.  \n \n35.  The provisional district court remedy of enlargement is \nnot mentioned directly in in federal rules governing the lower \nfederal courts. In contrast, at the appellate level, Federal Rule \nof Appellate Procedure (FRAP) 23 provides in part that: \n \nWhile a decision not to release a prisoner is under review, \nthe court or judge rendering the decision, or the court of \nappeals,  or  the  Supreme  Court,  or  a  judge  or  justice  of \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-2   Filed 04/27/20   Page 9 of 14\n8 \n \neither court, may order that the prisoner be: (1) detained \nin the custody from which release is sought; (2) detained in \nother  appropriate  custody;  or  (3)  released  on  personal \nrecognizance,  with  or  without  surety.  While  a  decision \nordering  the  release  of  a  prisoner  is  under  review,  the \nprisoner  must  –  unless  the  court  or  judge  rendering  the \ndecision, or the court of appeals, or the Supreme Court, or \na judge or justice of either court orders otherwise – be \nreleased on personal recognizance, with or without surety. \n \nAs that excerpt reflects, the Rule uses language familiar in the \ncontext  of  bail  and  provides  that  appellate  courts  may  also \ndetermine  that  a  petitioner  be  detained  in  “other  appropriate \ncustody.” \n \n36.  Federal courts at all level are authorized by Congress \nto decide habeas cases “as law and justice requires.” 28 U.S.C. \n§2243. The case law also references that, at the district court \nlevel,  the  authority  to  release  a  habeas  petitioner  pending  a \nruling on the merits stems from courts’ inherent powers. See, e.g., \nMapp v. Reno, 241 F.3d 221, 226 (2d Cir. 2001). And, as I noted, \nin these reported decisions, the terms “bail” or “release” are \nsometimes used instead of or in addition to “enlargement.” \n \n37.  In  the  last  weeks,  the  saliency  of  enlargement  has \nprompted me to review more of the law surrounding it. To gather \nmaterials and opinions on enlargement, I asked two law students, \nKelsey Stimson of Yale Law School and Ally Daniels of Stanford Law \nSchool, to help me research what judges have said about enlargement \nand what others have written. Below I detail some of the governing \ncase law. The Hertz & Liebman Treatise on Habeas also has a section \n(§14.2) devoted to this issue. \n \n38.  Some of the decisions involve requests for release when \nhabeas petitions were pending from state prisoners, and others \nfrom federal prisoners, or from people in immigration detention. \nFurther, several appellate cases address the issue of whether a \ndistrict court order on enlargement was appealable as of right or \nsubject to mandamus. \n \n39.  My central point is that, amidst these various debates \nabout  appealability  and  the  test  for  enlargement/release,  most \ncircuits have recognized that district courts have the authority \nto order release. See e.g., Woodcock v. Donnelly, 470 F.2d 93, 43 \n(1st Cir. 1972); Mapp v. Reno, 241 F.3d 221, 226 (2d Cir. 2001); \nLandano v. Rafferty, 970 F.2d 1230, 1239 (3d Cir. 1992); Calley v. \nCallaway, 496 F.2d 701, 702 (5th Cir. 1974); Dotson v. Clark, 900 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-2   Filed 04/27/20   Page 10 of 14\n9 \n \nF.2d 77, 79 (6th Cir. 1990); Cherek v. United States, 767 F.2d \n335, 337 (7th Cir. 1985); Martin v. Solem, 801 F.2d 324, 329 (8th \nCir. 1986); Pfaff v. Wells, 648 F.2d 689, 693 (10th Cir. 1981): \nBaker v. Sard, 420 F.2d 1342, 1342-44 (D.C. Cir. 1969). \n \n40.  The  Fourth  and Eleventh  Circuits  appear,  albeit  less \ndirectly, to recognize enlargement authority. See Gomez v. United \nStates, 899 F.2d 1124, 1125 (11th Cir. 1990); United States v. \nPerkins, 53 F. App’x 667, 669 (4th Cir. 2002). A Ninth Circuit \nopinion  from  1989  likewise  appears  to  recognize  the  power  of \ndistrict courts to grant release pending a habeas decision where \nthere are “special circumstances or a high probability of success.” \nSee  Land  v.  Deeds,  878  F.2d  318  (9th  Cir.  1989).  Thereafter, \nanother decision, In re Roe, described the Circuit as not having \nruled on the issue in terms of state prisoners. See 257 F.3d 1077 \n(9th Cir. 2001).1 \n \n41.  A  discrete  question  is  the  standard  for  enlarging \npetitioners. To obtain an order for release pending the merits of \nhabeas decision, the petitioner must demonstrate “extraordinary \ncircumstances” and that the underlying claim raises “substantial \nclaims.” See e.g. Mapp v. Reno, 241 F.3d 221, 226 (2d Cir. 2001). \nCourts  have  also  discussed  that  release  is  appropriate  when \n“necessary to make the habeas remedy effective.” Mapp, 241 F.3d at \n226; see also Landano v. Rafferty, 970 F.2d 1230, 1239 (3d Cir. \n1992).  As  that  Third  Circuit  decision  explained,  release  was \n“available  ‘only  when  the  petitioner  has  raised  substantial \nconstitutional  claims  upon  which  he  has  a  high  probability  of \nsuccess, and also when extraordinary or exceptional circumstances \nexist which make the grant of bail necessary to make the habeas \nremedy effective.’” \n \n42.  Some judges have interpreted the “substantial questions” \nprong to require the underlying claim to have a “high probability \nof success.” See Hall v. San Francisco Superior Court, No. C 09-\n5299 PJH, 2010 WL 890044, *1 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 8, 2010); In re \nSouels, 688 F. App'x 134, 135 (3d Cir. 2017). That test resembles \nstandards for preliminary injunctive relief and for stays, which \n                                                 \n1 Subsequent lower court cases debated whether district courts do possess such \nauthority. See, e.g., Hall v. San Francisco Sup. Ct., 2010 WL 890044, at *2 \n(N.D. Cal. Mar. 8, 2010) (“Based on the overwhelming authority [of other circuit \ncourts] in support, the court concludes for purposes of the instant motion that \nit has the authority to release Hall pending a decision on the merits.”); United \nStates v. Carreira, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31210, at *4, (D. Haw. Mar. 10, 2016) \n(“[T]his Court declines to address the merits of Petitioner’s bail requests in \nthe absence of definitive guidance from the Ninth Circuit regarding the scope \nof this Court’s bail authority.”). \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-2   Filed 04/27/20   Page 11 of 14\n10 \n \ninclude an assessment of the likelihood of success on the merits \nand of whether the balance of hardships tips in favor of altering \nthe status quo. (And, of course, more can be said about the nuances \nof these bodies of law as well.) \n \n43.  A  few  cases  focus  on  the  health  of  a  petitioner  as \ncentral  to  the  conclusion  that  “extraordinary  circumstances” \nexist. For example, in Johnston v. Marsh, the petitioner, Alfred \nAckerman, brought a habeas claim alleging that he was convicted in \nPennsylvania through a trial that lacked “due process.” 227 F.2d \n528 (3d Cir. 1955). Ackerman asked for release pending a decision \non  the  merits  of  his  habeas  petition;  he  argued  that  he  had \nadvanced  diabetes  and  was  “rapidly  progressing  towards  total \nblindness.” Id. at 529. The district court authorized Ackerman to \nbe  released  to  a  private  hospital.  The  prison  warden  (Frank \nJohnston) went to the Third Circuit invoking sought   writs of \nprohibition and mandamus to order the district court (Judge Marsh) \nto change his ruling. Rejecting the petitions, the Third Circuit \naffirmed that district courts possessed the  authority to order \nrelocation while the habeas petition was pending. Johnson v. Marsh \nhas been cited in more recent cases to illustrate that findings of \nextraordinary  circumstances  may  “be  limited  to  situations \ninvolving poor health or the impending completion of the prisoner’s \nsentence.” Landano, 970 F.2d at 1239. \n \n44.  The  court  in  In  re  Souels  addressed  what  showing  of \nhealth problems constituted extraordinary circumstances. See 688 \nF. App’x at 135-36. Sean Souels, who was serving a 46-month federal \nprison sentence, petitioned for a writ of mandamus directing the \ncourt to rule on his writ of habeas corpus and sought release \npending the decision. Id. at 134. The court denied Souels bail \nbecause “he [did] not describe his medical conditions in any detail \nor explain how he cannot manage his health issues while he is in \nprison.” Id. \n \n45.  Health is not the only extraordinary circumstance that \nhas been the basis for enlargement. For example, in United States \nv. Josiah, William Josiah brought a writ of habeas corpus after \nthe Supreme Court invalidated the residual clause of the Armed \nCareer Criminal Act (ACCA) and altered the method for determining \nwhether prior convictions qualify as violent felonies under the \nACCA. 2016 WL 1328101, at *2 (D. Haw. Apr. 5, 2016). Josiah, who \nwas  serving  a  federal  prison  sentence  argued  that  his  prior \nconvictions did not qualify as violent felonies and that he should \nnot be subject to the fifteen-year mandatory minimum. The district \ncourt concluded that because the issue of retroactivity was pending \nbefore the Supreme Court and Josiah would have served his full \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-2   Filed 04/27/20   Page 12 of 14\n11 \n \nsentence if the Court held its prior ruling retroactive, release \npending the higher court’s ruling was appropriate. Id. at *4-6. \n \n46.  In  circumstances  similar  to  Josiah,  a  district  judge \nsitting in the Central District of Illinois issued three orders \ngranting release, termed bail, to petitioners pending resolution \nof their habeas claims. See Zollicoffer v. United States, No. 15-\n03337, 2017 WL 79636 (C.D. Ill. Jan. 9, 2017); United States v. \nJordan, No. 04-20008, 2016 WL 6634852 (C.D. Ill. Nov. 9, 2016); \nSwanson v. United States, No. 15-03262, 2016 WL 5422048 (C.D. Ill. \nSept. 28, 2016). \n \n47.  Another case involved enlargement in the context of the \nmilitary. See Gengler v. U.S. through its Dep't of Def. & Navy, \n2006 WL 3210020, at *6 (E.D. Cal. Nov. 3, 2006). As that court \nexplained, a “district court has the inherent power to enlarge a \npetitioner on bond pending hearing and decision on his petition \nfor writ of habeas corpus.” Id. at *5. The judge also noted that \na “greater showing must be made by a petitioner seeking bail in a \ncriminal conviction habeas ‘than would be required in a case where \napplicant  had  sought  to  attack  by  writ  of  habeas  corpus  an \nincarceration  not  resulting  from  a  judicial  determination  of \nguilt.’” The court used the test of “exceptional circumstances \nand, at a minimum, substantial questions as to the merits.” Id. at \n13. The court found exceptional circumstances” based on the fact \nthat the petitioner had been admitted to business school, had been \ngranted permission by his commanding officer to attend, and would \nbe forced to drop out if his custody were not enlarged. The court \nalso ruled that “substantial questions as to the merits” existed \nbecause  of  alleged  government’s  errors  in  drafting  the \npetitioner’s service agreement. Id. at *6. \n \n48.  As of this writing, I have located three reported cases \non COVID. (Given the pace of litigation, I assume that more may \nhave been filed and some decided.)  \n \n49.  On April 7, the Honorable Jesse Furman, sitting in the \nSouthern District of New York, granted on consent a motion styled \n“for bail” (the term used in the Second Circuit Mapp decision). \nJudge Furman ordered immediate release under specified conditions, \npending the adjudication of the Section 2255 Motion. See United \nStates v. Nkanga, No. 18-CR-00730 (S.D.N.Y., Apr. 7, 2020). \n \n50.  A second case involves a class action filed by Craig \nWilson and others. See Wilson v. Williams, No. 4:20-cv-00794-JG, \n2020  WL  1940882,  at  *1  (N.D.  Ohio  Apr.  22,  2020).  Seeking  to \nrepresent a class of all current and future prisoners of the Elkton \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-2   Filed 04/27/20   Page 13 of 14\n12 \n \nFederal  Correctional  Institution  (FCI)  and  a  subclass  of  the \nmedically vulnerable population, they sought relief because their \ncontinued incarceration subjected all FCI prisoners to substantial \nrisk of harm in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  \n \n51.  On April 22, 2020, the federal district court granted in \npart the request by the Wilson class for emergency relief, which \nincluded enlargement of a subclass of prisoners challenging the \nmanner in which the sentence was served and hence cognizable as a \nhabeas  petition.  See  Wilson  v. Williams,  No.  4:20-cv-00794-JG, \n2020  WL  1940882  (N.D.  Ohio  Apr.  22,  2020) \n \n52.  The third case has less relevance as it was brought by \nan unrepresented litigant, Richard Peterson, who had originally \nsought habeas corpus relief on a claim about education credits and \nthen filed an emergency request for release from a California state \nprison due to COVID-19. No. 2:19-CV-01480, 2020 WL 1640008, at *1 \n(E.D. Cal. Apr. 2, 2020). The district court noted that a class \naction raising COVID claims was pending in another federal court \nin  California  and  that,  while  the  court  had  the  authority  to \nrelease a person while a habeas petition was pending, Mr. Peterson \nhad not provided evidence sufficient to meet the test to do so. \n \nConclusion \n \n53.  In sum, COVID-19 is an unprecedented event that, in my \nview,  raises  the  legal  question  of  whether,  in  light  of  the \ngovernment  mandates  for  social distancing,  sentences  (that  had \nbeen lawful when they were imposed) cannot lawfully be served when \nthe setting puts an individual in a position of untenable risk. \nThus, habeas corpus – which addresses the constitutionality of \nsentences and offers the possibility of release and enlargement – \nproperly provides a jurisdictional basis and remedies for this \nsituation.  \n \n54.  I need also to note that, in recent years, the Supreme \nCourt has raised questions in many contexts about the remedial \npowers  of  federal  judges.  Whether  the  topic  is  nationwide \ninjunctions or commercial contracts, debates have occurred within \nthe Court about the authority of federal judges.  \n \n55.  Those cases do not address the extraordinary and painful \nmoment in which we are all living. Ordinary life has been up-ended \nin an effort to keep as many people as possible alive and not \ndebilitated by serious illness. Moreover, Supreme Court opinions \nhave  not  focused  on  the  relevance  of  remedial  debates  to  the \nsituation  were  confinement  can  put  entire  staffs  and  detained \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-2   Filed 04/27/20   Page 14 of 14\n13 \n \npopulations at mortal risk. Therefore, judges have the obligation \nand the authority to interpret statutes and the Constitution to \npreserve the lives of people living in and working in prisons. It \nis my hope that this account of earlier uses of enlargement in \nthis District and the dense account of case law and doctrine will \nbe of service to this Court and to the parties in understanding \nthe meaning and import of American law.  \n \n \n \nDated:  April 23, 2020 \n \n \n \n          __________________________ \nJudith Resnik \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-3   Filed 04/27/20   Page 1 of 4\nEXHIBIT \nC\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-3   Filed 04/27/20   Page 2 of 4\nDeclaration of Dianthe Martinez-Brooks \n \n \n1.  I am currently in custody at Danbury FCI in the minimum security women’s camp (the \n“Camp.” My Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) Register Number is 71331-050. \n \n2.  I am 50 years old. I have asthma, hypertension, arthritis, and systemic lupus \nerythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease. I take Atenolol for hypertension. For my \nasthma, I have a Proventil emergency inhaler and use an Asmanex Twisthaler \n(mometasone furoate inhalation powder, 220mg). Since my incarceration began, I have \nbeen prescribed steroids once for the joint and muscle inflammation associated with my \nlupus. \n \n3.  I am serving a sentence of 48 months for wire fraud. My release date is 6/25/2022.  \n \n4.  At the Camp, there are rooms and dorms containing bunk beds. There are 9 rooms, each \nthat can hold 4 to 5 women. There are four dorms: Dorms A, B, C, and D.  \n \n5.  Before the lockdown on April 15, there were approximately 43 women in the 9 small \nrooms. On April 15, these women from the rooms were moved to the dorms.  \n \n6.  I am currently housed in Dorm A. Dorm A has 48 women in it right now, who share 4 \nshowers and 3 toilets. Dorm B has 48 women sharing 5 toilets and 6 showers. In Dorm C, \n46 women share 5 toilets and 5 showers. In Dorm D, 7 women are currently sharing 3 \nshowers and 3 toilets.   \n \n7.  In the dorms, women sleep on bunk beds, with 2 women per bunk bed. The bunk beds are \nin cubicles. In many of the cubicles, the beds are positioned so they reach from one end \nof the cubicle to the other—so the only separation between the bed in one cubicle and the \nbed in the next is the wall of the cubicle, which does not reach to the ceiling. Beds \npositioned parallel to the wall of the cubicle are also not six feet away from beds in the \nnext cubicle.   \n \n8.  All cleaning in the Camp is done by prisoners, and cleaning has been sporadic. Many \nwomen have quit their jobs. Women are responsible for cleaning their own cubicles. \n \n9.  There is a common area in the Camp containing phones, computers, video chat machines, \nsinks for dishwashing, and hot water taps. There are also common recreation rooms \ncontaining tables, chairs, cards, and games. Women also share ice machines where they \nscoop out ice.   \n \n10. There are open bathrooms that can be used by all on the upper level and in the old \nvisiting room.  \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-3   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 4\n11. We are currently on a lockdown at the Camp.  Each dorm has 45 minutes of recreation in \nthe morning and 1 hour of recreation later in the day. These are the only times of day that \nwe can access the common areas in the Camp with the phones, recreation rooms, etc. \n \n12. I know of two women who self-surrendered to the Camp at the end of March. One came \nstraight into the Camp and the other was quarantined first.  \n \n13. Some women have been told that they are on a list for home confinement and would be \nquarantined before released. On April 6, 23 women were put in Dorm C for quarantine. \nOn April 7, 5 more women were put in Dorm C. On April 10, they moved some women \nfrom Dorm C into Dorm D and then added an additional 28 women to both Dorm C and \nDorm D.  On April 15, they took all the women who were housed in the rooms and added \nthem to Dorms A, B, and C. At that time, the Camp went into lockdown. \n \n14. Of the approximately 56 women placed in quarantine in the first 2 weeks of April, I am \naware of only 4 that have left from Dorm D and one that has left from Dorm C. One of \nthese women was granted compassionate release by the court. I understand that 2 of the \nother releases were COVID-19 related. The others were at or near the end of their \nsentences.  \n \n15. Even though there is a lockdown, women from different dorms are continuing to \ncomingle. During recreation, women are visiting friends who live in different dorms.  \n \n16. Not all staff are regularly wearing masks and gloves. \n \n17. There is no hand sanitizer for use by prisoners or staff.  \n \n18. Staff are serving meals. Prisoners are used to assist in food preparation, cooking, and \ncleaning the kitchen.   \n \n19. Each day, staff move between all four dorms in the Camp for count, food delivery, and \ncommissary. We have staff in the Camp that have been at the other two facilities at FCI \nDanbury. Medical staff see prisoners at all three facilities.  \n \n20. Three correctional officers who have been at the Camp have said that they had COVID-\n19, including one who works in food service.   \n \n21. There is no actual medical clinic in the Camp. Instead, there are a series of offices: two \nare used by medical staff, one by dental staff, and one by psychology. RNs come for pill \nline in the morning and in the late afternoon. If you are sick, you must go to morning pill \nline and fill out a sick call request. You then must wait to be called in and it can take \ndays. If there is an emergency, a correctional officer must call for a medical professional \nto come to the Camp because there is not a medical professional at the Camp 24 hours a \nday.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-3   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 4\n \n22. I have a severe peanut allergy. I had a reaction on April 15 when peanut butter was \nserved for dinner and I had to leave the dorm. To date, peanut butter has been served in \nthe dorm 7 times. Medical staff have told me that I should leave for at least an hour to \nallow the dorm to air out. I have expressed my concerns about this to staff repeatedly.  \n \n23. Since I have been incarcerated at FCI Danbury, I have had multiple problems accessing \nbasic medical care. In October 2019, I had difficulty being seen for an upper respiratory \ninfection and my daughter had to contact the facility. It took 8 days for me to be seen and \n11 days to get the medication that I needed. In February 2020, I was left without my \nasthma medication for more than 4 weeks when my prescription ran out. My daughter \nagain needed to contact the facility. My blood pressure medicine ran out on April 2 and \nmy prescription did not reach me until April 10.  \n \n24. Since my incarceration, I have only been prescribed steroids once for the joint and \nmuscle inflammation associated with my lupus and have not been brought to see a \nrheumatologist. I also suffer from migraines and TMJ and have not received treatment for \nthose conditions in BOP custody.  \n \n25. On March 26, 2020, I asked the warden for compassionate release.  \n \n26. I was given paperwork to sign on April 19 relating to home confinement and/or a halfway \nhouse. Then a new memo came out on 4/21/20 saying that if you haven’t completed 50% \nof your sentence you are ineligible. Another memo came out on 4/23/20 saying you must \nhave completed 25% of your time and have 18 months or less remaining on your \nsentence.  \n \n27. There has been no access to the law library for women working on current legal cases and \nno copy cards available to purchase.  \n \n28. I declare under the penalty of perjury that the contents of this declaration are true and \ncorrect to the best of my knowledge. I will sign a hard copy of this declaration at my \nearliest opportunity. \n \n \n______/s/_______________ \nDianthe Martinez-Brooks \n \nApril 26, 2020 \n \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-4   Filed 04/27/20   Page 1 of 12\nEXHIBIT \nD\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-4   Filed 04/27/20   Page 2 of 12\nDeclaration of Kenneth Cassidy \nI, Kenneth Cassidy, am over the age of 18 and fully competent to make the following \ndeclaration: \n1.  I am currently incarcerated at FCI Danbury.  My Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) \nRegister Number is 48169-054.  I arrived at FCI Danbury on January 21, 2020, my 54th \nbirthday. \n2.  I am assigned to D Unit.  D Unit is a dorm unit, can accommodate up to 80 \nprisoners, and currently houses approximately 66 prisoners. \n3.  I am serving a sentence of 5 years arising from a conviction for conspiracy to \ncommit wire fraud and willful failure to file an income tax return.  I have no violent offenses on \nmy record.  The BOP calculates my release date to be March 31, 2021.  My projected home \nconfinement release date is October 1, 2020.  At sentencing, the Court recommended to the BOP \nthat I serve the final year of my sentence at a halfway house. \n4.  While in the BOP, I have completed the 40-hour non-residential drug treatment \nprogram and taken courses on diabetes and personal finance.  I am on waiting lists to take \ncourses to become an OSHA-certified laborer and legal assistant.  I have never had an incident \nreport while in BOP. \n5.  I have had three heart attacks.  I have had pneumonia in my right lung more than \n20 times, and have been told that I have the lungs of a 70-year-old.  I suffer from many serious \nchronic medical conditions including asthma, coronary artery disease, hypertension, Prinzmetal \nangina, cervical disc disease, lumbar disc disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), \nBarrett’s esophagus, and diverticulitis resulting in a hernia in the colon wall.  I have a soft tissue \nmass on my upper cervical spine resulting in partial paralysis that requires immediate surgery \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-4   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 12\nupon my release.  I cannot digest rice, beans or greens.  I am severely allergic to ragweed, \nshellfish, trees and chlorophyll (including in green vegetables).  I am morbidly obese. \n6.  My current medications include an albuterol inhaler, Lisinprol, Metropolol, \nAtorvastatin, Nitroglycerin, Docusate and Lasix, as well as breathing treatments and oxygen \ntreatments in the medical department as needed. \n7.  Our pharmacy is currently closed because the pharmacist is out.  Our medication \nis being shipped in from FCC Allenwood with several days’ delay.  As a result, I did not receive \nthe correct dose of my medication for two weeks in April. \n8.  The COVID-19 virus has ravaged FCI Danbury.  Approximately 80% of prisoners \nin my unit show flu-like symptoms including fever, coughing, body aches, shortness of breath, \nchest pressure, and headaches. \n9.  The prison staff’s response has been disrespectful, degrading, dehumanizing and \nthreatening.  Social worker Adamson has said to me, “It’s not that big.  Don’t worry about it.  \nWe got it under control,” “This is nothing more than an overblown flu.  You guys are all \nbecoming hypochondriacs.  You’re paranoid after watching too much television.  Stop watching \nthe TV.  Stop watching the news because it’s only going to make you guys paranoid over \nnothing,”   “Stop being a hypochondriac, it’s not going to get you out of prison,” and “Lay down, \ntake a Tylenol, there’s nothing we can do.” \n10.  Warden Easter and Associate Warden Comstock told us, in effect, we know it’s \ndifficult for you guys to social distance, so just try your best to do what you can.  That is the only \ninstruction we have received on social distancing. \n11.  For the last couple of weeks, an associate warden has come through the unit daily \nto take prisoners’ temperatures.  He approaches prisoners one at a time and aims a temperature \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-4   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 12\nwand at our foreheads.  He stands so close to you that you could kiss him.  When a prisoner’s \ntemperature is taken, and there is no fever, he states the number loudly so that others are at ease.  \nWhen a prisoner has a fever, he states the number softly so that only the prisoner can hear, if he \nstates it at all. \n12.  Just because you have a fever doesn’t mean you are taken off the unit.  In the \nbeginning, there was such chaos that the staff couldn’t handle the influx and even if you had a \nfever, you stayed in the unit.  Until recently, a prisoner with a low-grade fever of 100 or 101 \ndegrees would be given Tylenol for 2 or 3 days to see if the Tylenol can break the fever. \n13.  For the last couple weeks, prisoners with a fever have been taken to medical.  \nSometimes, however, a prisoner has a fever and the associate warden attributes the temperature \nreading to equipment error.  When the temperature wand comes up with a low-grade fever, the \nassociate warden will “reset” it and pretend to take another reading.  He will announce another \nnumber, but he won’t even aim the wand at the prisoner’s forehead.  The associate warden does \nnot show the prisoners the LCD screen on the wand that displays the temperature, so we have to \ngo by whatever he tells us. \n14.  If the associate warden acknowledges that a prisoner has a temperature, then he \nwill escort the prisoner to medical.  Prisoners who have gone to medical have told me what \nhappens there.  At medical, the prisoner is given two or three Tylenol and told that the wand is \nnot working properly and that they do not have a fever, and then sent right back to the unit.  \nOne of the prisoners who went to medical and came right back has been vomiting blood all \nweek.  When his temperature was taken in the unit, he was told that he has a 101.2 degree fever.  \nWhen he got to medical, he was given Tylenol, told that his temperature is 98.7 degrees, and sent \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-4   Filed 04/27/20   Page 5 of 12\nback to the unit.  They never took his temperature in medical.  When he got back to the unit and \ntold us all this, his forehead was hot. \n15.  Although most of us are sick, only three prisoners with a fever have been taken \nout of the unit and quarantined.  These prisoners were taken to A Unit, a cell-based isolation unit.    \nTwo of these three prisoners returned to our unit about 8-10 days after testing positive for \nCOVID-19.  One was taken out on March 27 and the other was taken out on March 29.   \nI understand that when they were in the isolation unit, they were given two Tylenol per day.  \nOtherwise, they did not receive any medical treatment.  Shortly after they both returned to my \nunit on April 6, the unit became deathly sick.  Prisoners were up in the middle of the night \ncoughing and gasping for air.  It was at its worst from approximately April 7 to April 12.  \nThe third prisoner remains in isolation. \n16.  The prison recently opened another isolation unit, K Unit, which was condemned \nlast winter for asbestos.  Even though the BOP was supposed to renovate this unit and remove \nthe asbestos, and has not done so, the prison is justifying its use as a temporary. \n17.  The COVID-19 virus has decimated the medical department.  I was told by the \nassistant health administrator, Mr. Dakote, and a physician assistant, Mr. Quest, that our regular \nphysicians have been out for weeks.  Sick call requests have been going unanswered for weeks.  \nIn the last month, I have made three requests regarding an abnormal tumor near my rectum, and \nwas told “that’s not an emergency” even though there is dark black blood in my bowels on \noccasion.  The tumor has grown in the past month, obstructing my bowels, and medical has still \nnot evaluated me.  If you don’t have a fever, you have no access to a physician. \n18.  All sick call triage for our unit is being handled by a social worker who has no \nformal medical training.  The social worker, Ms. Adamson, has told us “you are all fucking \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-4   Filed 04/27/20   Page 6 of 12\nchildren with nothing more than a flu so stop your shit you’re not going home early.”  She has \nsaid, “if you did the crime stop crying and do the time.”  She has said, “I don’t need medical \ntraining to tell you you’re not sick so go lay the fuck down.”  Prisoners who present for sick call \ntriage who do not have a fever are denied access to any further medical treatment.  Sometimes \nMs. Adamson brings along the dental hygienist from the facility to help with the triage. \n19.  Ms. Adamson is also the staff member handling all CARES Act and \ncompassionate release requests. \n20.  Before the pandemic, we ate in the mess hall with several other units.  From \napproximately March 29 until April 5, we ate in the mess hall with another unit.  From \napproximately April 6 until April 10, our unit ate in the mess hall by itself.  Since then, we have \nbeen eating all meals in our unit. \n21.  Food service is closed.  The COs are preparing our food.  Food is delivered on a \nbread rack and is placed in your unit directly on your chair or on your bed.  We only have \nlaundry once a week at the most, and only if there is hot water and a staff member available.  \nAs a result, we cannot clean the stains on our bedding and clothes from when staff drop the trays \non our chairs and beds. \n22.  Our meals are smaller.  The portions were cut in half and we are not meeting the \nnutritional guidance of 2,000 calories per day.  Breakfast will be one sour milk with one small \npiece of half-cooked cake batter.  Lunch will be some type of hot food with a green vegetable or \nhalf-cooked rice as filler.  Lunch the other day was four ounces of some type of cream salad with \ngreen peas.  For dinner we are given a hamburger bun and a piece of meat, or four ounces of tuna \nwith one piece of bread. \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-4   Filed 04/27/20   Page 7 of 12\n23.  All special medical diets are suspended indefinitely.  I was prescribed a special \nmedical diet by Dr. Greene and Dr. Febregas-Schindler on January 21, which was updated and \nmodified by Dr. Febregas-Schindler on March 11.  I am on a special medical diet of no green \nvegetables or plants due to my allergy to chlorophyll, and no rice and beans due to my \ndiverticulosis.  Despite this I have been given food with greens, rice and beans.  I informed \nMs. Adamson about my special medical diet not being met, and she responded, “Mr. Cassidy, \nI have other more important things to address with this virus being widespread than worry about \nwhat you can or cannot eat.” \n24.  My chronic medical conditions have deteriorated as a result of not being given my \nspecial medical diet. \n25.  The prison closed and locked the law library indefinitely, and has suspended the \nadministrative remedy process indefinitely.  The staff has stated that they are short-handed to \nreview, investigate and respond to every grievance under the state of emergency the facility is \noperating in.  This resulted in me being unable to access administrative remedy and \ncompassionate release procedures. \n26.  Legal mail is being delayed and at times not picked up due to staff shortages.  \nAccording to the local post office this has been an ongoing issue with several bins being left \nbehind by prison staff.  I know this because we have a prisoner in my unit who gets mail from \nEngland, and he hasn’t been getting his magazines for the last month and a half.  His family \ncalled the local postmaster in Danbury, and the postmaster informed his family that this has been \nan ongoing problem with Danbury for 37 years but that it has gotten worse in the last month and \na half.  The postmaster informed his family that prison staff leave behind a couple of bins, say \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-4   Filed 04/27/20   Page 8 of 12\nthey’re going to come back, and never come back, so they’re always a couple days behind on the \nbins. \n27.  Legal calls are being denied for open and pending cases that require access to \nattorneys.  I filed a written request to call my attorney and was told that a compassionate release \nmotion is not a legal matter that is recognized.  The case manager informed me that in her view \nthe matter did not meet the criteria she was told by the unit manger to be considered a legal \nmatter.  Legal requests from attorneys are going unanswered because, per the staff, they “don't \nhave time to handle these nonsense calls with all they are dealing with all the futile \ncompassionate release requests.” \n28.  Until approximately March 29, our unit took rec with the rest of the prison, and \nwe had access to both an indoor rec area and the outside rec yard.  After around April 6, we were \nno longer allowed to use the indoor rec area.  Instead, we used the outside rec yard with two \nother units, E Unit and F Unit.  That lasted for about a week.  For the last two weeks, our unit has \ngone to the outside rec yard by ourselves.   When we go out to the rec yard, prisoners move out \nat the same time, standing next to each other, through the same 4’ wide door.  During rec, \nprisoners stand right next to each other.  There is no social distancing. \n29.  We are experiencing serious staff shortages and they keep getting worse and \nworse.  There are way fewer COs than normal.  95% of the time, there is no officer in the unit.  \nSometimes we only see staff on the unit during count.  You see the same guys working 80-100 \nhour weeks.  I estimate that there are only about 40 COs on the entire compound.  The COs are \nbeing “augmented,” meaning that a random staff member from medical, education, etc. has to \ncover units when COs are short-handed.     \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-4   Filed 04/27/20   Page 9 of 12\n30.  If there is a medical emergency, and we cannot find a CO, the prisoners respond \nand help the prisoner.  When prisoners collapse, it is the other prisoners who carry the prisoner to \nhis bed.  In order to get a CO, we have to yell out the window hoping that somebody hears us.  \nI have witnessed at least three prisoner medical emergencies that were addressed only by other \nprisoners.   \n31.  Social distancing is impossible in here.  All 66 prisoners in my unit sleep in the \nsame room in bunk beds.  When I am sleeping, I am within one foot of the prisoner sleeping \nabove me, and only about three or four feet away from the four prisoners in the two bunks on \neither side of me.  There are no barriers between the beds. \n32.  In my unit there are five toilets, one urinal, three showers, and six sinks, including \nfive cold-water wash sinks and one hot-water slop sink for washing eating utensils.  The slop \nsink is right next to the other sinks.  The sinks are about four inches apart.  Sometimes two \npeople have to share the same sink.  The showers are two feet across the hall from the toilets.  \nThe tiles in the showers are corroded and filthy with mold.  There are holes in the rotted woods \nin the ceiling above the showers, exposing rusted pipes, and when the prisoners above us in Unit \nC use their showers, water leaks down on us. \n33.  There is one liquid soap dispenser that was just put up last week.  When we run \nout of liquid soap, we have to wait a day or two for it to get refilled.  There are no paper towels \nor hand towels.  We use toilet paper to dry our hands.  There is no communal bar soap in the \nbathroom.  You have to buy your own bar of soap from commissary.  Indigent prisoners do \nwhatever they have to do to get themselves a bar of soap.  The prison does not give out shampoo, \ntoothpaste, or mouthwash to indigent prisoners, either.  We are also not provided with any \ncleaning supplies. \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-4   Filed 04/27/20   Page 10 of 12\n34.  There are two television rooms in the unit.  Each room is about 10’ by 12’ with \ntwo televisions.  The rooms can hold about 20 people and there are typically about 15-20 people \nin each of them.  There is no ventilation in the television rooms. \n35.  There is a small telephone room, approximately 3’ by 8’, containing two \ntelephones.  The telephones are about eight inches apart.  Both telephones are almost always in \nuse.  When two prisoners are using the telephones, they have to stand within two feet of each \nother.  Typically, there are two prisoners on the phones, and the rest wait in a line in the hallway, \nstanding right next to each other, close enough to touch each other.  Since they started giving us \nfree calls two weeks ago, there is always a line to use the telephones.  The telephones are not \ncleaned between use.  \n36.  There is also a small computer room, approximately 8’ by 10’, containing three \ncomputers, an eating table, and an ice dispenser.  The amount of mold that is built up in the ice \ndispenser is incredible.  The computers are in constant use.  There are no barriers between the \ncomputers.  At any given time, there will be three people in the room using the computers, three \npeople standing behind them in the room waiting to use the computers, and several more people \nlining up shoulder-to-shoulder outside the room, right next to each other.  The computers are not \ncleaned between use. \n37.  The commissary is open, but they are out of 50% of the items and a lot of the \nitems are past their due date.  They bring the commissary into a hallway in a laundry bin, and \nthen the entire unit stands in the hallway and we wait for our names to be called.  The hallway is \nnarrow and no more than 20 feet long.  We stand right on top of each other.  If you miss your \nname then you have to wait until the end of commissary, so everyone comes out into the hallway \nat the same time. \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-4   Filed 04/27/20   Page 11 of 12\n38.  Staff give out medication twice a day.  They shout “medication” and stand outside \nthe door.  Prisoners form a pill line, standing right next to each other.  If you don’t hear \n“medication” you don’t get your medication for the day, so everyone comes up at the same time \nand crowds each other. \n39.  On April 9, staff gave the prisoners in my unit one mask each.  A week later, they \ngave us a second mask.  We haven’t received a mask in the last week.  These masks are thin, \npapery disposable hospital masks that you cannot clean.  They fall apart if you wet them.  There \nis one prisoner with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a beard who does not \nwear a mask.  He is not being made to wear a mask. \n40.  Staff have not provided us with gloves.  Staff do not wear gloves regularly.   \n41.  Staff wear masks in our unit.  But we see them take them off when they leave the \nunit and put them back on when they come back into the unit.  Staff will go into the A Unit or K \nUnit, the two units with people who are positive with the virus, and come back into our unit \nwithout changing their gloves, or they’ll take off their gloves outside the unit but won’t wash \ntheir hands and won’t change their masks. The entrances to A Unit and K unit are both on the \nfirst floor, so my whole unit can see staff going in and out of those units. \n42.  On March 13, I submitted a request to the Warden through Unit Manager Moore \nfor compassionate release.  Around March 20, I learned that that she had tested positive for \nCOVID-19.  She is still not back in the facility. On April 1, I asked for an administrative remedy \nand was told that the administrative remedy process was suspended.  On April 24, I received a \ndenial of my compassionate release request from the warden. \n43.  I have a secure and stable home environment that I can go to immediately if I am \nreleased.  I would be confined to my family residence of the last 16 years in Brooklyn, New \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-4   Filed 04/27/20   Page 12 of 12\nYork with my brother, Donald Cassidy.  I would stay at home and would not be out in the \ncommunity.  My brother Michael Cassidy and sister Dorothy Peters both will assist with any \nfinancials.  I also have employment secured with Quick Call Medical Answering Service. \nI have reviewed the information contained in this declaration with counsel by telephone \nand correspondence.  I declare under the pains and penalties of perjury that the contents are true \nand correct to the best of my knowledge.  I will sign a hard copy of this declaration at my earliest \nopportunity. \n \n            /s/ Kenneth Cassidy (by consent) \n            Kenneth Cassidy \n \n            April 26, 2020 \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-5   Filed 04/27/20   Page 1 of 4\nEXHIBIT \nE\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-5   Filed 04/27/20   Page 2 of 4\n \nDeclaration of Christina Korbe \n \n1.  I am currently in custody at Danbury FCI in the low security satellite prison (“FSL”). My \nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) Register Number is 30233-068. \n \n2.  I have been incarcerated in the BOP for almost 12 years. My release date is set for May \n18, 2022. \n \n3.  I am 51 years old. I have been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease and post-\ntraumatic stress disorder. \n \n4.  In early April, I began experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19. My symptoms \nincluded a severe headache, body aches, fever, shortness of breath, and a terrible cough. I \nalso lost my appetite and my sense of smell. The cough was the worst cough I have ever \nhad. At one point, I coughed so hard that I was afraid I had fractured a rib.  \n \n5.  I spoke to the medical department multiple times about my symptoms. When I coughed \nso hard that I feared I had fractured a rib, I submitted a request for an x-ray. In response, I \nwas called to medical, but I was not given an x-ray. Medical told me that my vitals were \ngood and that I was “healthy,” and that I probably just pulled a muscle rather than \nfractured a rib. I was given no treatment. I bought Tylenol from the commissary for my \npain. \n \n6.  My symptoms lasted for approximately three weeks. Upon hearing how hard I was \ncoughing, one of the psychologists commented that I should be tested because I could be \ninfecting other people. I responded, “Could you please make that happen?”  \n \n7.  I was never offered a test for COVID-19.  \n \n8.  I was also never quarantined in response to my symptoms. Instead, I was kept in general \npopulation.  \n \n9.  At the FSL, all of us live in one dormitory-style room, which is like a big “warehouse,” \nwith about 160 to 170 inmates total. The dormitory is divided up into cubicles with two \nbunkbeds in each. The dormitory also contains our common area with televisions, hair \ncare, laundry, phones, and computers, as well as our bathrooms and showers.  \n \n10. There are currently three people, including me, living in my cubicle. Many of the \ncubicles have four people. My cubicle is approximately 10 feet by 10 feet. Within the \ncubicle, the two bunkbeds are approximately 6 feet apart. Most of the cubicles are \nseparated by a partition about an inch thick; however, some of the partitions do not reach \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-5   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 4\nall the way up to the top bunk, so in some cases, two people on top bunks in separate \ncubicles are sleeping right next to one another. \n \n11. In the common area, there are 12 phones, but not all of them are working. There are 6 \ncomputers, but only 4 of them are working. These are shared among the 160 to 170 \nwomen who live here. The phones and computers are not being cleaned in between each \nuse; rather, they are being cleaned at most three times per day, and sometimes less \nfrequently. \n \n12. There are 24 showers for all of us, but not all of them are working. The showers are \ncleaned once per day. \n \n13. FSL has canceled all classes and programming, as well as indoor recreation, and we are \nbeing called to meals in waves. However, this has not made much of a difference in our \ndaily contact with one another, because we are still living side by side in the crowded \ndormitories, and standing side by side in line for meals. We share countless items that we \nall touch many times per day, including, for example, the phones, computers, laundry, ice \nmachine, door handles, and a hot water spigot that we use to make coffee and food. \n \n14. Staff members here have been taking the inmates’ temperature every day. They go down \nour rows of cubicles to do this, but on quite a few occasions, I have noticed that everyone \nin the same row is told that they have the exact same temperature. Sometimes, I and other \nwomen have not gotten out of bed to have our temperature taken, and no one seems to \nnotice or care. \n \n15. Before April 24, 2020, I was aware of only four women in the FSL who had been tested \nfor COVID-19, at least two of whom tested positive. But many more people were sick. I \nhave personally observed many other prisoners with symptoms similar to mine. Many \nstaff members have been absent. Although a few women were placed into quarantine, the \nmajority of women with symptoms were not. \n \n16. On April 24, 2020, a woman in the FSL became extremely sick. She was vomiting and \nstruggling for air. Other inmates were around her, trying to help her, without wearing any \ngloves or masks. She was sick for hours, and throughout the night. We did not understand \nwhy staff did not take her to the hospital. In response to concern among the inmates, a \ncorrectional officer (a lieutenant) came into the dormitory and announced that anyone \nwho used the phone to contact people on the outside about this incident would get a \ndisciplinary violation. He said that he would be listening to our phone calls, and that we \nneeded to “stay in our lane,” because we “are not doctors.” The woman who was sick was \neventually taken to the hospital on April 25.  \n \n17. On April 25, many of the women who had been in contact with the woman who was \ntaken to the hospital were tested for COVID-19. At least ten of them have tested positive, \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-5   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 4\nand all of them have been quarantined. That night, the women who were being placed in \nquarantine were allowed to come into the dormitory to get their personal belongings and \ntake showers.  \n \n18. As of April 26, 2020, I still have a cough and a headache. I am terrified for my health and \nsafety. \n \n19. I declare under the penalty of perjury that the contents of this declaration are true and \ncorrect to the best of my knowledge. I will sign a hard copy of this declaration at my \nearliest opportunity. \n \n/s/ Christina Korbe \n \nApril 26, 2020 \n \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-6   Filed 04/27/20   Page 1 of 4\nEXHIBIT \nF\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-6   Filed 04/27/20   Page 2 of 4\nDeclaration of Marius (Marie) Mason \n \n1.  I am currently in custody at Danbury FCI in the low security satellite prison (“FSL”). My \nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) Register Number is 04672-061. \n \n2.  I am 58 years old.  \n \n3.  I am serving a sentence of 21 years and 10 months for conspiracy and arson. My release \ndate is set for May 4, 2027. \n \n4.  On Tuesday I submitted a request to the Warden for compassionate release. I also asked \nto be considered for home confinement. I was approached by a staff member and \ninformed that if I persisted in my request for compassionate release I might be moved to a \nmedical facility. This would seem to me to confirm that I am in fact a candidate for \ncompassionate release.  \n \n5.  I have a history of breast and uterine cancer, as well as an enlarged heart, hypertension, \nand borderline diabetes.  \n \n6.  At FSL it is not possible for me to maintain distance from other prisoners. I am housed in \na large dormitory style room with approximately 168 other women.  \n \n7.  The dormitory in which I am housed is divided into cubicles. Each cubicle holds two \nbunk beds, with up to four prisoners per cubicle. Each bunk bed is about two to four feet \nfrom the bed in the same cubicle. Each bed is about two to four inches from the bunk bed \non the other side of the cubicle wall. The cubicle wall does not reach the top of the bunk \nbeds, so a prisoner on the top bunk is right next to the prisoner on the top bunk on the \nother side of the cubicle wall. \n \n8.  All of the prisoners at FSL must share 6 or 7 working phones and 4 working computers. \nThey are not cleaned between uses. The phones and computers are located close together \nin a common area. \n \n9.  Prisoners in my housing unit eat meals together in the unit. About 10-20 people are \nseated at each table. Five tables are filled at a time for meals.  \n \n10. All of the prisoners in the FSL use three bathrooms, which each include 5 toilets, 5 sinks, \nand 4 showers.  \n \n11. There are frequently issues with the water in the FSL, and water will be shut off for a few \nhours or more than a day at a time. In early April, the water was shut off for about \nseventeen hours. During this time no one was able to wash their hands or flush the toilet. \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-6   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 4\n12. Prisoners are not given hand sanitizer. \n \n13. Prisoners were given paper masks a few weeks ago. Before then we were not given \nmasks. In mid-April, we were given fabric masks. \n \n14. Staff began wearing masks and gloves around mid-April. Before that time they weren’t \nwearing protective equipment.   \n \n15. Some staff have been out sick. More than one correctional officer tested positive for \nCOVID-19, was out of work for a week, and then came back to work. One of our cooks \nis still out. Officers have returned to work after being unable to get their FMLA papers \nsigned, but remain symptomatic. One officer stated that they still feel ill and do not want \nto be at work, but were told to return. \n \n16. On March 30, 2020, inmates in FSL found out about the first COVID-19 case in our \nfacility because it was reported on the news. A women from our facility was taken to the \nhospital and tested positive.  \n \n17. In total, I am aware of three people from FSL who have tested positive for COVID-19. \nOne of those individuals couldn’t breathe and passed out. One had asthma. One had a \npersistent fever that wouldn’t go down. They were all taken to the hospital, where they \nwere tested and found to be positive. \n \n18. Those inmates that tested positive for COVID-19 have returned to the facility. One was \naway from the unit for about two weeks, and others were out for only about 7 days. \n \n19. Inmates who are coughing, congested, or short of breath are not being tested for COVID-\n19. They are not being separated from other inmates. I am not aware of any prisoner in \nthe FSL being tested for COVID-19 except those who were tested at the hospital.  \n \n20. Staff are checking temperatures but inmates who have had high temperatures have not \nbeing separated from the rest of the population. Recently, however, nobody has had a \nnormal temperature, because they take our temperatures with a remote scanner, a plastic \nwand with a digital readout. It does not touch on our body and people’s temperatures read \nartificially low: as low as 96, but often around 97. \n \n21. Previously, they used an oral mercury thermometer. When a person’s temperature was \nelevated, staff would retake the temperature several times. A number of people had \nhighly elevated temperatures, ranging from 103 and above. Staff told those individuals to \ndrink cold water and then immediately retook their temperatures, at which point the \ntemperature would appear to have dropped, although it was still above normal. Nothing \nwas done after that as a result of the temperatures. Our temperatures were not and are not \nbeing recorded.  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-6   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 4\n \n22. While we are supposed to report symptoms, we are all aware that if we complain of \nsymptoms we are unlikely to get effective treatment, and that we may be isolated away \nfrom our friends and our belongings, in cells that do not have ready bathroom access. \nNeither prisoners nor staff have any clear guidance on what to do to protect ourselves or \nwhat should be done if we are ill. \n \n23. I have reviewed the information contained in this declaration by telephone with my \nlawyer, Moira Meltzer-Cohen. I declare under the penalty of perjury that the contents are \ntrue and correct to the best of my knowledge. I authorize my attorney to sign this \ndeclaration on my behalf. \n \n \n_/S/_____________________________ \nMarius Mason \n \nApril 23, 2020 \n \nI, Moira Meltzer-Cohen, certify that I have reviewed this declaration with Mr. Mason by \ntelephone on April 23, 2020, and that he certified that the information contained in this \ndeclaration was true and correct to the best of his knowledge. \n \n \n             \n            Moira Meltzer-Cohen \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-7   Filed 04/27/20   Page 1 of 3\nEXHIBIT \nG\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-7   Filed 04/27/20   Page 2 of 3\nDeclaration of Kimberly Hoisington \n \n1.  I am currently in custody at Danbury FCI in the low security satellite prison (“FSL”). My \nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) Register Number is 11764-082. \n \n2.  I am serving a sentence of 85 months for conspiracy to distribute cocaine. My release \ndate is set for November 1, 2021. \n \n3.  I am 61 years old. I have chronic asthma, which requires the use of two prescribed \ninhalers. \n \n4.  At FSL I am housed in a dormitory style room at with about 150 other prisoners. The \nroom is divided into cubicles with two bunkbeds each. I am in a cubicle with three other \nprisoners. Our beds are at most four and a half feet apart, and the top bunks are closer \ntogether, at most two feet, to the top bunks on the other side of the cubicle wall. \n \n5.  On March 27th I was hospitalized with COVID-19. I had been feeling sick for a couple \nweeks before I went to the hospital. I had put in a request to see medical, and had been \ngiven two different “idles” to miss programs because I was sick. \n \n6.  On March 26th I reported to staff that I wasn’t feeling well, and asked to be excused from \nparticipating in programs that day. I went to the medical clinic, but after waiting there for \n45 minutes without being seen, I returned to my bunk. A few hours later, I reported to \nstaff on duty that I was feeling worse. I was told to lie back down.  \n \n7.  By early in the morning of March 27th, around 1 or 2am, I had such bad chest pain that I \ncould not sleep. I told the officer on duty, who called command center, and then called an \nambulance. \n \n8.  Upon arrival at the hospital, my temperature was taken and registered at 102 degrees. My \ntemperature had been taken at the facility within an hour earlier. I was told it had \nregistered 97.  \n \n9.  At the hospital I was tested for COVID-19 and tested positive. I believe I was released \nfrom the hospital on April 1st. It was a Wednesday. I was told that I would have to test \nnegative twice before they would release me. I was tested most recently the Tuesday \nbefore I was released from the hospital. I got the results on Wednesday: I was positive for \nCOVID-19. I was released that afternoon. \n \n10. FSL has two isolation rooms. After I returned from the hospital, I was placed in one of \nthe isolation rooms. Another prisoner who I was told had tested positive for COVID-19 \nwas in the other isolation room. I remained in that room for 24 hours.  \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-7   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 3\n11. The isolation room was cold and small, with just enough room for my bed and a toilet. \nThe bed had a one-inch thick mattress and no pillow. The toilet’s flush was controlled by \nthe corrections officer from outside the room and was only flushed a few times a day.  \n \n12. After 24 hours, I was placed in the facility’s visiting room for five days. There were four \nof us in the visiting room. While we were there, we used the visiting room bathrooms. \nEach woman had her own toilet stall, but we shared the same shower, a temporary stand-\nup stall built in order for us to be able to bathe.  \n \n13. At one point when we were in the visiting room, one of the other women fell when she \nwas in the bathroom and hit her head on the concrete floor. She was unconscious, and we \ntried to get help for her. There was no guard outside the door. We tried to yell for help, \nbut nobody came. We went to the locked front door and started beating on the door and \nyelling to try to get someone’s attention. Someone who was in the parking lot heard us \nand told control. A Commander came into the visiting room and we told him what had \nhappened and that the woman who fell needed medical attention.   \n \n14. I returned to the general population housing unit on April 7.  \n \n15. I have continued to feel unwell since I returned to the unit. On April 17th I felt weak, had \na fever and terrible body pains, and was sweating and dry heaving. That weekend I \ncontinued to feel terribly sick. I had a stomach ache that lasted at least 8 hours, horrible \nbody aches, and my eyes burned. I was scared. I notified correctional officers, and I was \ntaken to the medical clinic. My temperature was taken and registered 98 degrees, but I \nbelieve this was incorrect. My oxygenation was 96 and my blood pressure was so high \nthat the nurse took it three times. The nurse instructed me to take Tylenol and return to \nmy room. \n \n16. Another prisoner in the unit was very sick and was taken to the hospital last night. She \ncouldn’t stop dry heaving for three or four hours before she was sent to the hospital. \n \n17. Today maybe 40 people were taken from the unit into the Rec room. I was told they were \nbeing tested for COVID-19. Some people who had been in contact with the prisoner who \nwent to the hospital were still in the unit and not among the people in the Rec room. \n \n18. I have reviewed the information contained in this declaration by telephone. I declare \nunder the penalty of perjury that the contents of this declaration are true and correct to the \nbest of my knowledge.

I am currently in custody at Danbury FCI in the low security satellite prison (“FSL”). My \nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) Register Number is 33746-068. \n \n2.  I am 40 years old. I am 5’9” and I weigh approximately 220 pounds. I use the pronouns \nhe/him. \n \n3.  I have asthma and hypertension. \n \n4.  I am serving a sentence of 15 years for possessing a firearm as a convicted felon. I was \nsubject to a 15-year mandatory minimum based on having three prior drug convictions. \nMy release date is set for March 20, 2025. \n \n5.  In early April I submitted a request to the Warden for compassionate release, and I \nsubmitted through my Federal Public Defender a request for home confinement.  \n \n6.  At FSL it is not possible for me to social distance. I can try to keep to myself, but I am \nhoused in a dorm style unit with 198 beds. The unit is divided into cubes like office \ncubicles with four people to a cube. The walls of the cubicles are about 4-5 feet high and \ndo not reach the ceiling. The beds are not six feet apart. \n \n7.  Our unit has 3 bathrooms for all of the prisoners in our dormitory. Each bathroom has 6-8 \ntoilet stalls and 6-8 showers. Not all of the showers are functional.  \n \n8.  Meals are brought to all the prisoners in the unit at the same time; meal times are not \nstaggered. They are brought on Styrofoam trays. There are not enough places for \neveryone to sit to eat.   \n \n9.  The counselor’s office has hand sanitizer that I can use when I make a legal call. Hand \nsanitizer is not available in the units.  \n \n10. The prisoners have one fabric washable mask each. There are washing machines \navailable to us to clean the masks. We do not have another mask to wear while our mask \nis being cleaned.  \n \n11. A woman in my unit was removed for fever. She reported that she tested positive for \nCOVID-19 on a Tuesday. She was returned to our unit that same Friday. She sleeps in a \ncubicle that touches mine on the top bunk. I sleep on the bottom bunk. After she returned \nfrom the hospital, I slept with my head away from the wall to try to protect myself. \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-9   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 3\n12.

I am currently in custody at Danbury FCI in the minimum-security women’s satellite \ncamp (“Camp”).  My Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) Register Number is 26224-014. \n \n2.  I am 58 years old and African American. I am 5 feet 7 inches tall and I weigh \napproximately 240 pounds.  \n \n3.  I have a medical history of hypertension, for which I am currently taking \nHydrochlorothiazide and Aspirin.   \n \n4.  I am serving a sentence of imprisonment of a year and a day for tax evasion—my first \nand only criminal conviction—and the BOP calculates my release date to be January 4, \n2021, but I have been advised that I may be eligible for release to home confinement on \nNovember 30, 2020.    \n \n5.  I self-surrendered to FCI Danbury on February 28, 2020. \n \n6.  On April 17, 2020, I submitted a request by U.S. Mail to Warden Easter for \ncompassionate release, or, in the alternative, immediate transfer to home confinement.  \nAs of today, I have not received a response.  \n \n7.  At the Camp, it is not possible for me to maintain physical distance from other women. I \ncan try to keep to myself, but I am housed in a dorm style unit with about 47 other \nwomen.  We sleep in a common space that is divided into open cubicles, each with a \nbunk bed that sleeps two women. The walls of the cubicles are about 4-5 feet high and do \nnot reach the ceiling. The bunk beds are close enough that if I reached out my hand, I \ncould touch the hand of the person in the bed next to me. \n \n8.  Camp prisoners are responsible for cleaning our own cubicles.  Our shared living spaces \nin our dorm are not regularly disinfected.   \n \n9.  Our unit has 5 toilets, 6 sinks and 6 showers that are currently shared by approximately \n48 women.  Our common toilets, sinks, and showers are not regularly cleaned or \ndisinfected.     \n \n10. There are four dorms at Camp: A, B, C, and D.  I am in Dorm B.  Currently, I believe that \nthe A, B and C dorms each house approximately 47-50 people.  I believe that the D dorm \nhouses 12 people.   \n \n11. Staff move throughout the day between all four of the dorms, including for count, food \ndelivery, and commissary.  Staff also rotate between the men’s prison, the FSL, and \nCamp, interacting with prisoners at each location.   \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-10   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 4\n \n12. Among other duties, staff serve us our meals in our cubicles three times per day.   \n \n13. Several staff members that typically have shifts at the Camp have been out sick.  Two \nstaff members in particular have been out for several weeks, and their offices, which are \nusually cleaned by inmates, have been thoroughly disinfected, floors mopped, and \nfurniture cleaned—I haven’t seen this type of cleaning before, and it goes far beyond the \nsanitation and cleaning practices throughout the rest of the Camp facility.   \n \n14. Cleaning throughout the rest of the Camp has been sporadic lately, as some prisoners \nhave quit their jobs and some are quarantined in different dorms from their assigned \ncleaning areas.  We do not have adequate cleaning supplies.  I am not aware of any part \nof the Camp being sanitized or disinfected other than the two staff offices.    \n \n15. The Camp contains one common area with telephones, computers, and “video-visiting” \nmachines.  These items are shared by women housed in all four dorms; for the entire \nCamp, there are a total of 4 phones, 7 computers, and 3 video machines currently \noperational.  The common area also includes hot water taps and sinks for dishwashing.  \nThe phones, computers, and video machines are clustered close together in the shared \ncommon space.  They are not cleaned or disinfected between uses.  There is cleaning \nsolution available in the phone area, but not in the computer room.  When we have access \nto the common area to make phone calls or use the computers, we often have to wait in \nline because they are in high demand.  While we wait, we are not able to social distance \nfrom each other. \n \n16. Prisoners have been given 2 surgical masks and 3 material masks in the last two weeks.  \nWe have not been given gloves. \n \n17. Since April 15, the Camp has been on lockdown.  Under this lockdown, the women in \neach dorm are let out of the dorm for one hour a day at different times of day.  This is our \nonly time for recreation and access to the common area.  During the time we are confined \nto our dorm, we are instructed to remain in our cubicles.  Since the walls between the \ncubicles are only 4 to 5 feet tall, we are still able to speak to other prisoners in our dorm \nover the wall.  \n \n18. There are a limited number of prisoners doing jobs, and those prisoners continue to move \naround the facility and between the dorms.  Three times a week, my entire unit (all 48 of \nus) will move through the facility to the laundry room and deliver our laundry to \nprisoners who will do the laundry.  We wait in line to drop it off, and we are not able to \nsocial distance while we wait in line. \n \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-10   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 4\n19. On April 16, the Assistant Warden visited the Camp and was asked if we would be \ninformed if we were exposed to COVID-19.  She said that we would not be told if we \nwere exposed.   \n \n20. Every day, the lieutenant comes by and takes our temperature using a sensor \nthermometer, but since staff tries to get it as close to our heads as possible, it sometimes \ntouches our head.  The same thermometer is used for each inmate, and I do not see it \nbeing disinfected between uses.  There is no screening for other symptoms such as \ncoughing.   \n \n21. Although some women at the Camp have been told that they are on a “list” for home \nconfinement, these women have not been released.  I only know of two releases resulting \nfrom COVID-19 from Camp: a pregnant woman and a woman with Parkinson’s disease.  \n \n22. I have not been told that I am on the list for home confinement.   \n \n23. I declare under the penalty of perjury that the contents of this declaration are true and \ncorrect to the best of my knowledge. I will sign a hard copy of this declaration at my \nearliest opportunity. \n \n \n___/s/___________________________ \nTheresa Foreman \nApril 26, 2020 \n \n  3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-11   Filed 04/27/20   Page 1 of 3\nEXHIBIT \nK\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-11   Filed 04/27/20   Page 2 of 3\nDeclaration of Antrum Coston \nI, Antrum Coston, am over the age of 18 and fully competent to make the following \ndeclaration: \n1.  I was incarcerated at FCI Danbury from April 2019 until April 17, 2020, when the \nCourt granted my motion to reduce my sentence.  I served a little more than two years for federal \ndrug and gun convictions.  My BOP Register Number was 15278-014. \n2.  I was housed in H Unit, a congested, second-floor dorm-style unit which houses \nabout 75 prisoners. \n3.  All prisoners in H Unit sleep in bunk-beds in the same room.  The bunk-beds are \nin rows, both side-by-side and front-to-back.  Side-by-side, there is a distance of approximately \n3’ between beds.  I could stretch out my arms and touch the bunk next to me.  Front-to-back, \nthere is a distance of approximately 6’ between beds. \n4.  All 75 men in the unit share the same bathroom, which has one urinal, four or five \ntoilets, five or six sinks, and a shower area with four showers.  The unit also has two television \nrooms, a computer room with three computers, and a telephone room with two telephones.  \nThe television rooms can accommodate approximately 20 prisoners and it is not unusual for 15 \nor more prisoners to be in the same television room at the same time.  The two phones in the \ntelephone room are next to each other and if two prisoners are using the phones they have to \nstand right next to each other. \n5.  Most units in FCI Danbury are dorm-style.  There are three cell units.  One of the \ncell units is for the drug program, one is for mainly ex-military prisoners, and one (A Unit) was \nrecently emptied and converted into a quarantine unit.  Each cell has a bunk-bed for two \nprisoners, a sink and a toilet. \n6.  In February, many prisoners in my unit got very sick.  Staff explained the \noutbreak as chicken pox, pneumonia, or shingles.  The prison temporarily closed the gym in \nresponse to the outbreak.  The gym was reopened in March.  When the gym reopened, it was \npacked because prisoners had gone so long without working out. \n7.  In the beginning of March, prison staff took away prisoners’ spray bottles, which \nuntil then had been allowed.  We were told that we could get spray bottles from a CO, but the \nCO was never on the block.  In early April, we got our spray bottles back. \n8.  In mid-March, the prison cancelled all visits and split the jail in half.  Although \nbefore then the entire prison would have rec at the same time, after mid-March half the prison \nwould have rec at one time, and the other half would have rec at a different time.  \n9.  Before mid-March the entire prison would eat around the same time, on staggered \nshifts.  There would be about four units in the chow hall at any given time.  After mid-March, \nonly one unit would go to the chow hall at a time. \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-11   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 3\n10.  In early April, the prison closed the gym and the law library and my unit was \nlocked down.  It was still locked down when I was released.  My unit was allowed out of the \ndorm for one hour per day for rec.  Some time after that, my unit started going to rec by itself, \nwith no other units.  People did not observe social distancing in the rec yard.  \n11.  In early April, prison staff started allowing prisoners to wear mask.  They did this \nbecause we were making our own masks.  In the two weeks before I was released, the prison \nstaff started providing prisoners with masks. \n12.  In mid-April, my unit stopped going to the chow hall entirely.  All meals were \nbrought to the unit.  The prison switched from hot meals to bagged meals. \n13.  On approximately April 13, the prison started mandatory temperature-taking for \nprisoners.  Before then, prison staff would come through the dorm and asked if anyone wanted to \nget their temperature checked.  Having a high temperature would not necessarily result in any \nfurther action being taken.  There were prisoners with 103-degree temperatures who were not \ntaken out of the unit.  Generally, if prisoners in the unit get sick, they just get sick.  A couple \nextremely sick prisoners were taken out of the unit and transferred to A Unit.  But you had to be \nfalling down to get any help. \n14.  Medical has been no help.  Before the crisis, prisoners could go to sick call in the \nmorning, fill out a slip, and, depending on the severity of their condition, could expect to see a \ndoctor a day or two later.  For the last month, prisoners have been filling out slips but have not \nbeen hearing back from medical or getting appointments.   I put in a slip approximately one \nmonth before I was released, and never heard back from medical. \n15.  The prison put up a few signs reminding people to wash their hands.  They did not \ncreate any hand-washing stations or provide any prisoners with hand sanitizer or soap.  There is \nno hand sanitizer available in the commissary.  They used to have it, but they weren’t selling it to \nus for the last two months. \n16.  When I was released on April 17, there was no social distancing at the prison.  \nPrisoners frequently stood directly next to each other when waiting in crowded, congested lines, \nincluding to receive medications, to use the commissary, and to get meals.  At this time, some \nguards wore masks and some guards did not. \n \nI declare under the penalty of perjury that the contents of this declaration are true and correct to \nthe best of my knowledge. \n/s/ Antrum Coston (by consent) \nAntrum Coston \nApril 26, 2020 \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-12   Filed 04/27/20   Page 1 of 2\nEXHIBIT \nL\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-12   Filed 04/27/20   Page 2 of 2\nDeclaration of Shannon Benson \n \n1.

All the men in the unit share a bathroom that has one urinal and \n5 individual stalls. We all share 2 phones and 3 computers.  \n \n4.  Last week, a man passed away from COVID-19 who had been housed in my unit. \n \n5.  People with symptoms including coughing, chest restriction, headaches, and loss of taste \nand smell are not being taken up to medical or tested for the virus. You have to have a \nhigh temperature to be seen by medical. There are people in my unit right now who have \nserious symptoms and haven’t been seen by medical or removed from the unit. \n \n6.  I experienced loss of taste and smell, and had profuse cold sweats. I had headaches for 4 \nto 5 days. I was not tested for the virus. I was told that if you didn’t have an elevated \ntemperature then it may have been a common cold or flu I was experiencing. \n \n7.  Around March 13, 2020, I was scheduled to go to a specialist due to my T4 levels being \nelevated to the point of danger. Due to COVID-19, I was unable to be seen by the \nspecialist. I did not receive any blood work here at the institution until April 24 to see if \nin fact my thyroid condition had leveled out. I am concerned my medication is not \nperforming correctly because of my elevated levels.  \n \n8.

I was then locked up in an observation cell. There were long periods of time that no one \ncame to see me. I even missed meals.  \n \n8.  I was later moved to a celled unit.

EASTER & MICHAEL CARVAJAL, \nDefendants. \n \nORDER \nOn May 12, I issued a temporary restraining order directing the Respondent to review, on \nan expedited basis, all medically vulnerable inmates for home confinement eligibility under the \nWarden’s expanded authority under the CARES Act.  ECF No. 30 at 69-73.  The Respondent has \ntaken substantial steps toward complying with this order.  Nonetheless, more than two weeks \nafter the Temporary Restraining Order was entered, it appears that not one inmate has actually \nbeen released to home confinement pursuant to the Order (i.e., excluding those who were \nreleased as a result of the process that was occurring before the order was issued).  Consequently, \nwith respect to those inmates that the Respondent has already determined to be eligible for home \nconfinement, yesterday I ordered the Respondent, by June 4, either to (a) release each inmate to \nhome confinement or (b) demonstrate that public safety or medical considerations or the absence \nof any home in which to place the inmate would make it unsafe to move the inmate immediately \nto home confinement.  ECF No. 68 at 4.  This order was intended to bring the Respondent into \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 70   Filed 05/29/20   Page 2 of 6\ncompliance with the Court’s May 12 TRO, which required the Warden to eliminate the \ncategorical 14-day quarantine requirement to allow for immediate release where possible.  ECF \nNo. 30 at 71.   The Petitioners urge the Court to take similar action with respect to those inmates \nthat the Respondent has already determined to be appropriate for placement in a Residential \nReentry Center (“RRC”).  For the reasons that follow, I grant the Petitioners’ request in part—as \nto those inmates the Warden has deemed appropriate for placement in a RRC who do not have \neither (a) a violent1 or sexually related offense of conviction2 or (b) a PATTERN score of \n“High.”  This ruling assumes familiarity with the procedural history of this case as well as the \nCourt’s prior rulings.  \nIn Mapp v. Reno, the Second Circuit held that district courts have inherent authority to \ngrant bail to habeas petitioners.  Mapp v. Reno, 241F.3d 221, 226 (2d Cir. 2001) (“Today we \nreaffirm these cases and hold, once again, that the federal courts have inherent authority to admit \nto bail individuals properly within their jurisdiction.”).  The standard for bail pending habeas \nlitigation, however, is “a difficult one to meet.”  Id.  “The petitioner must demonstrate that the \nhabeas petition raise[s] substantial claims and that extraordinary circumstances exist[ ] that make \nthe grant of bail necessary to make the habeas remedy effective.”  Id.  During the course of the \nongoing COVID-19 pandemic, district courts within this Circuit have relied on the authority of \nMapp to issue bail or temporary release orders to medically vulnerable Section 2241 petitioners \nclaiming that their continued confinement violates the Constitution.  See, e.g., Basank v. Decker, \n \n1 For purposes of this order only, I do not consider mere possession of a firearm or ammunition – \nwhether as a convicted felon, in connection with a drug trafficking offense, or based on some \nother unlawful capacity – to be a violent offense. \n2 By “offense of conviction,” I mean the offense for which the inmate is currently incarcerated.  \nAn inmate who has a violent or sexually-related past offense is not excluded by this order unless \nhis or her PATTERN score is “High.” \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 70   Filed 05/29/20   Page 3 of 6\n2020 WL 1953847, at *13 (S.D.N.Y Apr. 23, 2020) (“Even if [ICE detainees petitioning under \nSection 2241] had not met the requirements for a preliminary injunction, the Court would release \nthem on bail pending final resolution of their habeas claims under the Second Circuit’s decision \nin Mapp v. Reno, 241 F.3d 221, 226 (2d Cir. 2001).”); Ferreyra v. Decker, 2020 WL 1989417, at \n*12 (same); Coronel v. Decker, 2020 WL 1487274, at *8-9 (S.D.N.Y. March 27, 2020) (finding \nthat “Petitioners have raised substantial claims” and that “[r]elease is . . . necessary to make the \nhabeas remedy effective” because “[i]f Petitioners were to remain detained, they would face a \nsignificant risk that they would contract COVID-19—the very outcome they seek to avoid.”). \nHere, I have already found that the Petitioners have shown a likelihood of success on \ntheir claim that the Respondent has run afoul of the Eighth Amendment by failing to make \nmeaningful use of her home confinement and compassionate release authority.  See ECF No. 30 \nat 42-56.  For those same reasons, Petitioners have also shown that they have raised “substantial \nclaims” under Mapp. \nI now further find that, with respect to those medically vulnerable inmates who have \nalready been approved for community placement, who do not have violent or sexually-related \noffenses of conviction, and who do not have a “High” PATTERN score, there are “extraordinary \ncircumstances . . . that make the grant of bail necessary to make the habeas remedy effective.”  It \nis undisputed that the medically vulnerable inmates face a grave risk of serious illness or death if \nthey were to contract COVID-19.  ECF No. 30 at 6-7.  It is also undisputed that true social \ndistancing—the most effective measure for preventing the spread of COVID-19—simply cannot \nbe implemented at a facility, like FCI Danbury, where inmates live communally and sleep in \nlarge dormitory halls that house as many as 140 inmates.  Id. at 6-7, 44.  FCI Danbury was \nspecifically identified as one of three federal prisons exhibiting “significant levels of infection” \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 70   Filed 05/29/20   Page 4 of 6\nby the Attorney General.  ECF No. 24-2 at 48.  Thus far, one inmate at FCI Danbury has died as \na result of contracting COVID-19, and multiple inmates have been hospitalized.  Id. at 7.   \nThe habeas remedy the Petitioners seek is for the Warden to pursue all reasonable \nmeasures, including the use of her expanded home confinement authority under the CARES Act, \nto remove them from FCI Danbury and thereby protect them from contracting COVID-19—a \npotentially fatal illness.  The effectiveness of this remedy depends upon these inmates remaining \ninfection-free.  Yet every day that these medically vulnerable inmates spend incarcerated at FCI \nDanbury increases their chances of contracting COVID-19.  This is the very outcome that \nPetitioners seek to avoid, and one that would render their requested relief entirely ineffective.   \nThe Respondent has designated the inmates in question for placement in an RRC.  Many \nof these placements, however, are not scheduled to occur for several months.  See ECF No. 66 \n(listing RRC dates ranging from June 2020 through April 2021).  Counsel for the Respondent \nindicated during the May 28 conference that Respondent is attempting to accelerate some of \nthese placements, but it remains unclear when placement will actually occur.  Furthermore, it \nseems unlikely that social distancing can be adequately observed at a half-way house, where \ncommunal living is, again, the norm.  As a result, the extent to which RRCs actually present a \nsafer environment for medically vulnerable inmates is unclear.  Thus, the inmates’ pending \nplacement at an RRC does not render bail unnecessary to make the habeas remedy effective. \nImportantly, with respect to the medically vulnerable inmates that are the subject of this \norder, the Respondent has already determined that these inmates—who have generally served \nthe vast majority of their sentences—are appropriate for some form of community placement, \ni.e., that they are suitable to leave the prison environment in the coming months.  The fact that \nthe Respondent has already conducted these individualized determinations in approving these \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 70   Filed 05/29/20   Page 5 of 6\ninmates for community placement, presumably taking into account both public safety and \npenological objectives, addresses any concern that the need for individualized consideration \nmakes granting bail under Mapp on a multi-party basis inappropriate under U.S. ex rel. Sero v. \nPreiser, 506 F.2d 1115, 1125 (2d Cir. 1974).  See generally ECF No. 30 at 62-66 (discussing the \napplication of Preiser to the present action). \nThe Respondent chiefly argues that release to home confinement is inappropriate because \nit does not allow for the level of supervision that an inmate would receive at a half-way house.  I \naddress this concern in part by excluding from this order those inmates designated for RRC \nplacement who are the most in need of close supervision to protect the public, i.e., those who are \ncurrently incarcerated for violent or sexually-related offenses and those who have PATTERN \nscores of “High,” which reportedly reflects a high likelihood of recidivism.3  This order thus \nonly applies to those inmates listed on the spreadsheet filed as ECF No. 66—and any others \ndesignated for RRC placement since the spreadsheet was filed on May 27, 2020—who have been \ndesignated for RRC placement but do not have violent or sexually-related offenses of conviction \nand do not have PATTERN scores of “High.”   \nI also note that inmates on home confinement are not without supervision.  They remain \nin the custody of the BOP and can be supervised by either an RRC or the United States Probation \nSystem.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 3624(c)(2) (classifying home confinement as “prelease custody”); \nid. § 3624(c)(3) (directing Probation to provide assistance to prisoners in “prerelease custody”).  \nInmates on home confinement can also be placed on electronic monitoring.  See \n \n3 Of course, as to those inmates, I encourage the Respondent to continue to make efforts to \naccelerate their assignments to RRCs—in the hope that the particular RRC to which they might \nbe assigned would present a somewhat lower risk of infection than does the environment of FCI \nDanbury.  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 70   Filed 05/29/20   Page 6 of 6\nhttps://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/docs/program_fact_sheet_201907.pdf (last visited on May \n29, 2020).  While there is some degree of additional supervision at an RRC, I cannot conclude \nthat this factor outweighs the medical considerations that make release to home confinement \nnecessary to make the habeas remedy effective for those inmates to whom this order applies. \nI thus find that, as to the inmates to whom this order applies, extraordinary \ncircumstances, including the substantial risk to the health of these medically vulnerable inmates \nand the prevalence of COVID-19 at FCI Danbury (described in my earlier ruling, ECF No. 30 at \n7, 13), make bail necessary to make the habeas remedy effective.  Accordingly, I order as \nfollows: By June 9, with respect to each medically vulnerable inmate who has been approved for \ncommunity placement at an RRC and who does not have a violent offense of conviction, a \nsexually-related offense of conviction, or a “High” PATTERN score, the Warden shall either (a) \nrelease the inmate to home confinement or (b) demonstrate that public safety or medical \nconsiderations or the absence of any home in which to place the inmate would make it unsafe to \nmove the inmate immediately to home confinement.  The fact that a greater degree of \nsupervision will be available at an RRC will not, by itself, be deemed sufficient to demonstrate \nthat it is unsafe to move the inmate to home confinement, as the Court has already addressed this \nargument. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \n    /s/   \n  Michael P.

For reasons I will explain in a forthcoming opinion, I find that the \nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) and the Respondent have breached the provision of the Settlement \nAgreement requiring that they “endeavor to release individuals approved for home confinement \nto home confinement within 14 days of the approval decision unless public safety or the absence \nof any home in which to place the inmate would make it unsafe to move the inmate to home \nconfinement during that 14 day period.”  ECF No. 134-1 at 11-12.  \nThere are currently 17 inmates at FCI Danbury who have been approved for home \nconfinement but have been waiting substantially more than 14 days—some as long as 3 \nmonths—for processing of their release to home confinement.  I am issuing this order now to \neffectuate their near-immediate release due to the urgent circumstances at FCI Danbury \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 289   Filed 12/11/20   Page 2 of 4\npresented by a new surge of COVID-19 infections there, as reflected on the BOP’s COVID-19 \nwebsite and in sworn declarations filed by the petitioner. \nIn the event of a breach, the Settlement Agreement authorizes the Court to order specific \nperformance.  ECF No. 134-1 at 14, 15.  Yesterday, during a telephonic hearing with the parties, \nRespondent’s counsel agreed that that authority allows the Court, if it finds that the BOP and the \nRespondent have breached the above-mentioned provision, to order a specific date for release of \nparticular inmates.  As noted, I make that finding and, with respect to the 17 inmates identified in \nthis order, I further find that there is no public safety or other reason to refrain from doing by \n5:00 p.m. on Saturday, December 12, 2020, what the BOP’s Home Confinement Committee has \nalready determined the Respondent Warden should do: release them to home confinement (or, if \nfor some technical reason the Warden believes that is not possible, release them to their homes \non furlough).  The 17 inmates are identified in ECF No. 282, which counsel for the Respondent \nshall provide to the Respondent along with a copy of this order forthwith.  The only public safety \nconcern about immediately releasing these 17 inmates cited by counsel for Respondent during \nthe telephonic hearing yesterday was that some of them have not yet completed a 14-day \nquarantine.  But as I will explain in more detail in the forthcoming opinion, the fact that some of \nthese inmates have not completed a 14-day quarantine at FCI Danbury does not, under the \ncurrent circumstances at FCI Danbury, warrant further delaying their transfer to home \nconfinement (or furlough).  Given the apparently rapid increase in infections at FCI Danbury, it \nwill be safer for all concerned for these inmates to quarantine in their homes, which they should \nbe instructed to do upon leaving FCI Danbury.  Accordingly, Respondent and the BOP shall \ntransfer to home confinement (or furlough) each of the 17 inmates identified in ECF No. \n282 by 5:00 p.m. on Saturday, December 12, 2020.  Should any of these 17 inmates require \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 289   Filed 12/11/20   Page 3 of 4\nadditional time to arrange for safe transportation to the place of home confinement (or \nfurlough), Respondent and the BOP shall be granted such additional time—but not later \nthan Tuesday, December 15, 2020, at 5:00 p.m.—as is necessary to safely move that inmate \nto home confinement (or furlough).  For the avoidance of doubt, a family member’s or \nfriend’s picking up the inmate at FCI Danbury in a vehicle constitutes safe transportation \nfor purposes of this order.  \nIn addition, henceforth, the BOP/Respondent may not delay releasing an inmate who is a \nmember of the settlement class in this case beyond 14 days after approval by the Home \nConfinement Committee for any of the following reasons: (1) the need to make additional \nnotations in, or the need to supplement, the inmate’s medical record; (2) the need to quarantine \nan inmate at FCI Danbury unless the BOP finds, for specific reasons, that the inmate cannot \nsafely quarantine at home; (3) the need to await COVID-19 test results or to further quarantine \nan inmate if the inmate has quarantined for 14 days at FCI Danbury and is not showing \nsymptoms of COVID-19; (4) electronic or paperwork errors of the type described in the \nWarden’s declaration, ECF No. 281 at 3-4; (5) a delay in transmitting an approval by the Home \nConfinement Committee to the RRM of more than 2 days from the date of approval; (6) a delay \nby the RRM in setting the inmate’s date for release of more than 5 days from receipt by the RRM \nof the referral packet; (7) the setting of a date for release by the RRM that is more than 14 days \nfrom the sending of the referral packet to the RRM; and (8) the need to make or document a \ncomparative risk assessment with respect to whether home confinement would be more effective \nin protecting the inmate’s health than continued confinement at FCI Danbury. \nFurther, to the extent there is a delay beyond 14 days from approval, the reasons for the \ndelay and a plan to eliminate or minimize further delay must be specifically documented and \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 289   Filed 12/11/20   Page 4 of 4\ncommunicated to class counsel within 5 days of the expiration of the 14-day period from \napproval.  The plan need not be detailed but should note practical steps the BOP intends to take \nto clear the obstacles to release.  Similarly, in case the BOP views the delay as justified by public \nsafety considerations or the absence of a home, it must document its findings and the steps it \nintends to take to resolve those obstacles and provide such documentation to class counsel within \n5 days of the expiration of the 14-day period from approval.  \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \n    /s/   \n  Michael P. Shea, U.S.D.J. \n \n \nDated:    Hartford, Connecticut  \nDecember 11, 2020 \n ",

ECF No. 133.  On the same day, \nPetitioner filed a motion for an order of notice to the class.  ECF No. 135.  The Court held a \ntelephonic status conference on August 5, 2020 to discuss both motions.  As a result of that \nconference, the Government filed the “side letter,” ECF No. 138, and Petitioner filed a revised \nNotice in both English and Spanish, ECF No. 139, 139-1, 139-2.  Respondent consents to both \nmotions.  ECF No. 133 at 1; ECF No. 135 at 1.   \nHaving considered the motions and the supporting memoranda and materials filed \ntherewith, the Settlement Agreement (ECF No. 134-1) and side letter (ECF No. 138-1), and the \nrevised Notice (ECF No. 139), the Court certifies the proposed class for settlement purposes, \ngrants the Motion for Order of Notice (ECF No. 135) by approving the revised Notice (ECF No. \n139), and finds and orders as follows: \n1.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241, this Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of \n \n1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 141   Filed 08/11/20   Page 2 of 8\nthis litigation and all related matters and all claims raised in this action and released in the \nSettlement Agreement.  The Court also has personal jurisdiction over all parties and Class \nMembers.  \n2.  The Court finds that, under U.S. ex rel. Sero v. Preiser, 506 F.2d 1115, 1125 (2d \nCir. 1974), a multiparty proceeding analogous to a class action is appropriate here substantially \nfor the reasons set forth in the Court’s Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”).  ECF No. 30 at 63-\n65; see also ECF No. 134 at 7-9.  In particular: (1) the issue of the constitutionality of the \nWarden’s implementation of her home confinement and compassionate release authority is \nplainly “applicable on behalf of the entire class” and is “uncluttered by subsidiary issues”; (2) the \nmajority of the vulnerable inmates would be unlikely to have the benefit of counsel in pursuing \nindividual habeas petitions absent a multi-party proceeding; and (3) multi-party treatment avoids \nthe “considerable expenditure of judicial time and energy in hearing and deciding numerous \nindividual petitions presenting the identical issue.”  ECF No. 30 at 63-65 (citing Preiser, 506 F.2d \nat 1126).  As a result, and acknowledging “that the precise provisions of Rule 23 do not apply to \nhabeas corpus proceedings,” the Court finds that the class action procedures set forth in Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23 provide an appropriate mode of procedure to resolve this multi-party habeas \nproceeding .  See Preiser, 506 F.2d at 1125 (citing Harris v. Nelson, 394 U.S. 286, 294, 299 \n(1969) (confirming the power of the judiciary to fashion “appropriate modes of procedure, by \nanalogy to existing rules or otherwise in conformity with judicial usage” under the All Writs Act, \n28 U.S.C. § 1651 (1970))). \n3.  The Court finds that the requirements for class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a) and 23(b)(2) are satisfied for settlement purposes only with respect to the following Class: \nany person incarcerated at FCI Danbury anytime from the Effective Date of the parties’ \nSettlement Agreement, i.e., July 27, 2020, until the termination date of the Agreement, \n \n2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 141   Filed 08/11/20   Page 3 of 8\ni.e., October 31, 2021, unless otherwise modified by the parties pursuant to the terms of \nthe Agreement, who either (a) is a List One Inmate or List Two Inmate (as those terms are \ndefined in the Settlement Agreement, ECF No. 134-1 at 3-4), or (b) possesses one or more \nunderlying medical conditions which, according to current CDC guidance (i.e., the CDC \nguidance in effect at the time of the individual’s home confinement review), either (i) \nplaces that inmate at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 (“Tier 1 medical \nconditions”); or (ii) might place that inmate at an increased risk of severe illness from \nCOVID-19 (“Tier 2 medical conditions”). \n \n4.  The Court finds that Rule 23(a)’s requirements of numerosity, commonality, \ntypicality, and adequacy are met for substantially the reasons set forth in the TRO.  ECF No. 30 at \n65-66; see also ECF No. 134 at 9-14; Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1)-(4).  The proposed class is so \nnumerous that the joinder of all members is impracticable, given that at least 439 inmates at FCI \nDanbury have been identified as medically vulnerable within the meaning of the class definition \nset forth above.  ECF No. 134 at 10; see also Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Town of Hyde Park, 47 \nF.3d 473, 483 (2d Cir. 1995) (holding that “numerosity is presumed at a level of 40 members”).  \nWhen new admissions to FCI Danbury are accounted for, the class may exceed 600.  ECF No. \n134 at 10-11.  The Court also finds that there are questions of law or fact that are common to the \nclass, even under Preiser’s stringent standards.  506 F.2d at 1127.  That is so because: (1) each \nclass member is recognized as being a part of the high-risk group as to which a prompt and \nconstitutionally adequate home confinement review is justified; and (2) the factual and legal \nquestions regarding the Warden and Bureau of Prison’s (“BOP”) process for considering inmates \nfor home confinement are common to the entire class.  ECF No. 134 at 12-13.  This is true even \nthough members of the class may face varying levels of heightened risk of severe illness from \nCOVID-19.  The Court finds that Rule 23(a)(3)’s typicality requirement is met because “each \nclass member’s claim arises from the same course of events [i.e., application of respondent’s \nhome confinement review process], and each class member makes similar legal arguments to \nprove the defendant’s liability.”  Cent. States SE. & SW. Areas Health and Welfare Fund v. \n \n3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 141   Filed 08/11/20   Page 4 of 8\nMerck-Medco Managed Care, L.L.C., 504 F.3d 229, 245 (2d Cir. 2007).  The Court also finds that \nthat the Plaintiff and Settlement Class Counsel will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \nthe Class under Rule 23(a)(4).  Because of his medical conditions (see ECF No. 134 at 14), Mr. \nWhitted is an appropriate and adequate class representative for the proposed class of medically \nvulnerable individuals.  He has incentives to seek a home confinement review process that is \nspeedy and fair and that best accounts for class members’ shared medical vulnerabilities to \nCOVID-19 regardless of each member’s individual conditions.  Further, class counsel are \n“qualified, experienced and able to conduct the litigation,” Baffa v. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette \nSec. Corp., 222 F.3d 52, 60 (2d Cir. 2000), and meet the requirements of Rule 23(g).  See \nDeclarations of Professor Sarah F. Russell, Professor Marisol Orihuela, David S. Golub, Esq. and \nProfessor Alexandra Harrington (ECF No. 134-2, 134-3, 134-4, 134-5, respectively). \n5.  The Court finds that the proposed settlement class also satisfies the requirements of \nRule 23(b)(2) in that Respondent “acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the \nclass” so that “a single injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of \nthe class.”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 360 (2011) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(b)(2))).  Here, the Warden and BOP’s home confinement policies and procedures apply \ngenerally to the class, and the Court can provide relief to each class member through a single \ninjunction or declaratory judgment.  The relevant relief sought in the petition—bail or \n“enlargement” to home confinement (ECF No. 1 at 66)—and ultimately fashioned in the \nSettlement Agreement—expedited home confinement review based on the standards set forth in \nthe TRO with additional procedural protections enumerated in the Settlement Agreement—is \nplainly susceptible of class-wide application because it establishes procedural protections and \nuniform review standards common to the class.     \n \n4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 141   Filed 08/11/20   Page 5 of 8\n6.

Frank Legal Services Organization, and \nAlexandra Harrington of the Criminal Justice Advocacy Clinic, University at Buffalo School of \nLaw, as Settlement Class Counsel for settlement purposes only. \n8.  The Court finds that the parties have a made a sufficient showing to justify ordering \nnotice under Rule 23(e)(1) because (1) the Court likely will be able to approve the proposed \nSettlement Agreement and (2) the proposed Settlement Class has been certified as of the entry of \nthis Order.  Subject to further review and a fairness hearing, the Court finds that it is likely to \napprove the proposed Settlement Agreement as fair, adequate, and reasonable.  In particular, the \nCourt finds that the settlement terms appear fair, adequate, and reasonable as to all class \nmembers, including the effectiveness of the proposed method of providing relief and processing \nclass member claims, when balanced against the costs and risks of further litigation.  The Court \nalso finds that: (1) the class representatives and counsel appear to have adequately represented the \nclass; (2) the proposed Settlement Agreement appears to treat class members equitably; and (3) \nthe Settlement Agreement was reached after lengthy, intensive, arm’s length negotiations, \nincluding over 38 hours of mediation (ECF No. 99, 102, 109, 112, 115, 119, 120, 121, 123) \npresided over by United States Magistrate Judge Thomas O. Farrish. \n9.  The Court approves the form and content of the proposed Settlement Notice \nattached as exhibits to this order in English and Spanish.    \n10.  The Court finds that the distribution of the Settlement Notice in the manner and \n \n5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 141   Filed 08/11/20   Page 6 of 8\nform set forth in ECF No. 135 (as modified in ECF No. 139): (1) is the best practicable notice; (2) \nis reasonably calculated, under the circumstances, to apprise Settlement Class Members of the \npendency of the civil action and of their right to object to the proposed Settlement; and (3) is \nreasonable and constitutes due, adequate, and sufficient notice to all persons entitled to receive \nnotice.  The Court directs Class Counsel to disseminate the Settlement Notice to the Class \nMembers in accordance with its proposal in ECF Nos. 135 and 139. \n11.  The Settlement Notice shall be provided: (1) to all class members currently \nincarcerated at FCI Danbury by posting a copy of the notice in both English and Spanish in each \nresidential unit of the facility and by disseminating the notice in both English and Spanish via the \nCorrlinks/Trulincs email system maintained by the Bureau of Prisons to provide authorized email \nto BOP prisoners; and (2) to all class members admitted to FCI Danbury in the future by \nproviding a copy of the notice in the appropriate language to such class member upon admission. \n12.  Class members may mail an objection to the settlement to the Clerk of Court as \ninstructed in the Settlement Notice.  Objections may be submitted to the Court either by filing the \nobjection on the docket or mailing the objection to the Clerk of Court, Abraham A. Ribicoff \nFederal Building, United States District Court, 450 Main Street Suite A012, Hartford, CT 06103, \nAttention: Danbury Settlement.  Objections must  be filed or received on or before September 4, \n2020.  Objectors should not send materials to the undersigned’s chambers. \n13.  Any Class Member who fails to submit timely written objections in the manner \nspecified in this Order and in the Settlement Notice shall be deemed to have waived any \nobjections and shall be foreclosed from making any objection (whether by appeal or otherwise) to \nthe Settlement.  The Court will consider all timely filed objections, and no Class Member need \nparticipate in the Fairness Hearing to have his or her timely submitted objection considered by the \n \n6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 141   Filed 08/11/20   Page 7 of 8\nCourt. \n14.  Settlement Class Counsel shall file a motion to approve the settlement by \nSeptember 11, 2020.  A Fairness Hearing, to be conducted entirely via video teleconference (or \naudio, for those who cannot participate by video), shall be held on September 18, 2020 at 10:00 \na.m. to determine all necessary matters concerning the Settlement, including whether the \nproposed Settlement of the Civil Action on the terms and conditions provided for in the \nSettlement Agreement is fair, adequate and reasonable and should be finally approved by the \nCourt.   \n15.  Pending the Fairness Hearing, all proceedings in this action, other than proceedings \nnecessary to carry out or enforce the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement and this \nOrder, are stayed. \n16.  The Court orders the following schedule for further proceedings: \na.  Settlement Class Counsel shall distribute the Settlement Notice in both English \nand Spanish via the Corrlinks/Trulincs email system maintained by the Bureau \nof Prisons to Class Members within 3 days of the entry of this Order, i.e., by \nAugust 14, 2020.

EASTER, Warden of Federal Correctional  : \nInstitution at Danbury, in her official capacity  : \n: \nRespondent.  : \n \nNOTICE TO THE CLASS OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \nThis Notice is to inform you that there has been a Settlement Agreement resolving a class \naction habeas lawsuit on behalf of individuals incarcerated in the Federal Correctional Institution \nin Danbury, Connecticut (“FCI Danbury”) who are medically vulnerable to COVID-19 (the \n“Medically Vulnerable Class”). This Notice is also to give you an opportunity to comment on \nand/or object to the Settlement, and provide you with instructions on how, when, and where to \nmail your written comments and/or objections to it. \n \nYou are a Class Member if you are incarcerated at FCI Danbury and: \n•  You have already been placed on a list of medically vulnerable people during the course \nof this lawsuit (a “List One” Inmate or a “List Two” Inmate, defined below); OR \n•  You possess one or more medical conditions which, according to current United States \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) guidance, either (i) places you at \nincreased risk of severe illness from COVID-19; or (ii) might place you at an increased \nrisk of severe illness from COVID-19. See https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019- \nncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html. \n \nI.  CASE BACKGROUND \nOn April 27, 2020, several individuals imprisoned at FCI Danbury filed this action \nagainst Diane Easter, in her official capacity as the Warden of FCI Danbury, challenging the \nconditions of confinement at FCI Danbury and the Bureau of Prisons’ (“BOP”) measures in \nresponse to the COVID-19 crisis. In the complaint, Petitioners alleged that the BOP had \ninadequate policies and procedures for managing the risk of COVID-19 infection at FCI \nDanbury in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and \nchallenged the BOP’s alleged failure to release medically vulnerable individuals from the facility \nduring the pandemic. Respondent Warden Easter and the BOP have denied the allegations. This \nis not a money damages case. Rather, the lawsuit sought non-monetary relief in the form of \nchanges to the conditions of confinement at FCI Danbury and the release of individuals who are \n\n \nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 141-1   Filed 08/11/20   Page 2 of 5\nmedically vulnerable to COVID-19. The Petitioners are represented by the law firm of Silver \nGolub & Teitell LLP, the Legal Clinic at Quinnipiac University School of Law, the Jerome N. \nFrank Legal Services Organization at Yale Law School, and the Criminal Justice Advocacy \nClinic at the University at Buffalo School of Law (collectively, “Petitioners’ lawyers”). \n \nThe District Court overseeing this case issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) on \nMay 12, 2020 that ordered Warden Easter to identify medically vulnerable individuals and set \nforth standards for determining those individuals’ suitability for home confinement. \n \nOn July 27, 2020, the parties reached a Settlement Agreement that resolves this lawsuit, \nsubject to final approval by the Court. The Settlement Agreement applies to those individuals \nincarcerated at FCI Danbury who are medically vulnerable to COVID-19 (meaning they are or \nmight be at higher risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19 according to CDC guidance). \nCopies of the Settlement Agreement will be available with the case managers in each unit at the \nfacility, or you may request one by writing to Petitioners’ lawyers (see details below). \n \nIn addition, the Government issued a letter filed on the docket (ECF No. 138-1) stating its \nintention to take certain actions at FCI Danbury to meet the medical needs of inmates during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic to mitigate and control the spread of the virus. This letter is not part of the \nparties’ Settlement Agreement (ECF No. 134-1) and does not create any enforceable rights. \n \nIf you are part of the Medically Vulnerable Class as defined above, you have a right to \ncomment and/or object to the Settlement Agreement. \n \nII.  THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \nA.  Terms of the Settlement Agreement \nThe main terms of the Agreement are: \n \nIdentifying and Reviewing Members of the Medically Vulnerable Class for Home Confinement \nWho Have Not Previously Been Identified for Home Confinement Review \n \n1.  Respondent and BOP agree to recognize individuals as part of the Medically Vulnerable \nClass as follows: Individuals at FCI Danbury who believe they are medically vulnerable as \ndefined by current CDC guidance can sign an Authorization Form permitting BOP to give their \nmedical records to Petitioners’ lawyers. Petitioners’ lawyers will propose to BOP those \nindividuals they believe are part of the Medically Vulnerable Class if medical records confirm a \ncondition listed by the CDC. If you already signed an Authorization Form in early June giving \nPetitioners’ lawyers access to your medical records you do not need to sign another form. \nIndividuals who have been at FCI Danbury for less than two years may also submit outside \nmedical records to substantiate a claim that they are medically vulnerable. \n \n2.  Medically vulnerable individuals will be entitled to expedited consideration for suitability \nfor home confinement. Once someone is identified as medically vulnerable, a medical clinician \nwill verify that all medical conditions are identified for the home confinement review. The \nreview process will be conducted under policies set forth by the BOP and the Attorney General \n  2 \n\n \nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 141-1   Filed 08/11/20   Page 3 of 5\nand the standards of the Court’s May 12 TRO, which include speedy consideration for release to \nhome confinement and substantial weight provided to each individual’s COVID-19 risk factors. \n \n3.  Members of the Medically Vulnerable Class who are denied home confinement at FCI \nDanbury will be reviewed for home confinement by the Home Confinement Committee (HCC), \na committee within the Central Office of the BOP in Washington D.C. in accordance with the \nstandards set forth in the Court’s May 12 TRO. \n \n4.  Respondent and BOP agree to complete home confinement review within a reasonable \ntime, and will try to do so within 14 days from the time an individual is recognized as part of the \nMedically Vulnerable Class. \n \n5.  The home confinement review process will be subject to continued oversight from the \nlawyers and the Court. The lawyers will receive written explanations for the reasons for any \ndenial. If the HCC relies on erroneous factual information or applies the wrong standards in \ndenying home confinement, individuals may be entitled to re-review by the HCC. Individuals \ndenied home confinement based on an unsuitable release plan or pending warrants, charges, or \ndetainers will have the right to apply, on their own initiative, for a home confinement re-review \nif those issues are resolved. Such inmates shall be re-reviewed first by the institution, and, if \ndenied again by the institution, then by the Home Confinement Committee. \n \n6.  The BOP will attempt to release those approved for home confinement within 14 days of \nthe approval decision unless public safety or release plan issues make it unsafe to move the \nindividual to home confinement within that 14-day period. \n \nPreviously Identified Medically Vulnerable Individuals \n \n7.  List One Inmates: On May 15, 2020, Warden Easter identified an initial group of \nindividuals, whom the Settlement Agreement identifies as “List One Inmates.” Those individuals \nhave already been reviewed for home confinement. Under the Settlement Agreement, the BOP \nagrees to re-review 54 of these List One Inmates for home confinement under the TRO standards \nand terms of the Settlement Agreement. Petitioners’ lawyers identified these individuals because \nPetitioners’ lawyers contend there were significant and material errors in the previous review: \nwithout conceding error, the BOP has agreed to re-review them. All List One Inmates are listed \non Exhibit A of the Settlement Agreement, and the 54 individuals who will be re-reviewed are \nlisted on Exhibit B. The exhibits include the initials of each individual and the first three digits of \ntheir BOP register numbers. These lists are attached to the Settlement Agreement and you can \nview the lists in your case manager’s office. You may also contact Petitioners’ lawyers to find \nout if you are on these lists. \n \n8.  List Two Inmates: Warden Easter identified an additional group of individuals on June 3, \n2020, and several more individuals were later added to this list by agreement between the parties. \nThe Settlement Agreement identifies this group of individuals as “List Two Inmates.” All List \nTwo Inmates are listed on Exhibit A of the Settlement Agreement. Respondent and BOP have \nbegun reviewing List Two Inmates for home confinement. Respondent agrees to have all List \nTwo Inmates, to the extent she has not done so already, reviewed for home confinement at FCI \n  3 \n\n \nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 141-1   Filed 08/11/20   Page 4 of 5\nDanbury. All List Two Inmates who are not approved for home confinement at FCI Danbury will \nbe reviewed for home confinement by the HCC. These reviews are subject to oversight from the \nlawyers and the Court for compliance with the TRO and the Settlement Agreement. \n \nB.  Releases of Claims \nIf you are a member of the Medically Vulnerable Class, you will not be able to pursue \nany individual lawsuit challenging BOP’s home confinement decision made during the duration \nof the agreement (currently until October 31, 2021). Any challenge to BOP’s decision to deny \nyou home confinement must be made under the terms and procedures set forth in the Settlement \nAgreement. In addition, you will not be able to pursue any action seeking non-monetary relief \nfor any acts or omissions regarding the BOP’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic prior to July \n27, 2020. \n \nHowever, the Settlement Agreement does not affect your ability to pursue any claims for \nmoney damages that you may have against the BOP. The Settlement Agreement also does not \nprevent any claims (other than those challenging BOP’s home confinement decisions) based on \nconditions at FCI Danbury after July 27, 2020. Finally, the Settlement Agreement does not affect \nyour ability to seek a sentence reduction, typically called a compassionate release motion, \npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582. \n \nC.  Impact on Individuals Who Are Not Medically Vulnerable \nIf you are incarcerated at FCI Danbury and do not have a medical condition that places \nyou or might place you at an increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 as defined by the \nCDC, you are not a party to the Settlement Agreement. While the Settlement Agreement does \nnot afford any protections to you, it also does not waive any of your rights or prevent you from \npursuing any claims you may have against the BOP. If, at some point during the effective period \nof the Settlement Agreement, you are diagnosed with a condition that makes you medically \nvulnerable to COVID-19 as defined in the Agreement, you will become a member of the \nMedically Vulnerable Class and eligible for home confinement review under the terms set forth \nin the Settlement Agreement. As a class member, you will be subject to the “Release of Claims” \ndescribed in Section B above. \n \n \nIII.  PURPOSES OF THIS NOTICE AND NOTICE OF FAIRNESS HEARING \n \nThe Settlement Agreement is under review by the Court, and it will not take effect unless \nand until it is approved by the Court. This Notice is not intended to be, and should not be \nconstrued as, an expression of any opinion by the Court with respect to the truth of the allegations \nin the litigation or the merits of the claims or defenses asserted.

The Court will consider any objections \nor comments you may have regarding the Settlement Agreement, provided they are received by \nSeptember 4, 2020. \n  4 \n\n \nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 141-1   Filed 08/11/20   Page 5 of 5\n \nAll written objections to the pending Settlement Agreement must be mailed to: \n \nUnited States District Court \n450 Main Street \nHartford, CT 06103 \nAttention: Danbury Settlement \n \nA hearing, which may be conducted by teleconference or video conference, will be held at \nthe discretion of the Court, on September 18, 2020 at 10:00 a.m. at which time the Court will \nconsider the fairness of the Settlement Agreement and whether to approve it.

Williams, No. 4:20-CV-00794 (N.D. Ohio).   \nI.  List of Medically Vulnerable Prisoners  \nAs requested by the Court, counsel for Petitioners consulted with counsel for \nRespondents about the definition of the Subclass of medically vulnerable prisoners and the \nprocess of compiling a list of such Subclass members. Petitioners and the Government have \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 26   Filed 05/07/20   Page 2 of 5\nagreed that the Subclass shall be defined on the basis of conditions specifically identified by the \nCDC as putting such individuals at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.   \nConsistent with CDC Guidance, Petitioners propose that the medically vulnerable \nSubclass be defined as follows: \nAll individuals in custody at FCI Danbury, while the threat of COVID-19 at the \nfacility remains, who are aged 65 or over and/or who have any of the following \nconditions specifically identified by the United States Centers for Disease Control \nas putting them at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19: (a) chronic lung \ndisease including moderate to severe asthma, COPD, emphysema, chronic \nbronchitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and/or cystic fibrosis; (b) \nimmunocompromised status, including status as a transplant recipient, on \nchemotherapy, HIV positive, prolonged use of corticosteroids, using \nimmunosuppressive medication, and/or  having an immune deficiency; (c) severe \nobesity (BMI of 40 or higher); (d) diabetes mellitus Type I or Type II, (e) \ngestational diabetes mellitus; (f) chronic kidney disease on dialysis; (g) chronic \nliver diseases, cirrhosis; and/or serious heart conditions, including congestive \nheart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, \nand/or pulmonary hypertension. \n \nThese conditions are covered by the CDC’s publication, People Who Are at Higher Risk for \nSevere Illness, attached as Exhibit B.1  \nPlaintiff’s expert, Dr. Jaimie Meyer, has compiled a list of the CDC conditions and \ncorresponding ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. See Exhibit C. The parties have agreed that, as a first \nstep in compiling the list of Subclass members, the BOP will search for these codes in the \nmedical records of all prisoners at FCI Danbury. The search through medical records will include \nbut will not be limited to the “health problem lists” that appear in the medical records of each \nprisoner. The parties have further agreed that Petitioners shall have the right thereafter to seek to \nadd individuals to such list of Subclass members based on outside medical records or other \nevidence of relevant medical conditions meeting the criteria for the Subclass.   \n   \n                                                 \n1 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 26   Filed 05/07/20   Page 3 of 5\nII.  Proposed Order as to the Medically Vulnerable Subclass \nPetitioners’ Proposed Order, attached as Exhibit A, addresses the proposed Subclass \ndefinition, the compilation of the list of Subclass members, and a process for transfer of Subclass \nmembers to home confinement.   \nAt the hearing on Petitioners’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order, Petitioners \nreferenced the order entered on April 22, 2020 by the court in Wilson v. Williams, No. 4:20-CV-\n00794, 2020 WL 1940882 (N.D. Ohio Apr. 22, 2020). Subsequent to the hearing in this matter, \nthe Bureau of Prisons filed a status report in Wilson which, Petitioners believe, reflects a \ncomplete failure by the BOP in that case to identify in good faith medically vulnerable prisoners \nat Elkton eligible for transfer or to implement meaningful transfers of the medically vulnerable \nsubclass.2 Most saliently, although the BOP identified 837 medically vulnerable prisoners at \nElkton, as of the date of its report it had initiated community placement for only 5 such \nmedically vulnerable individuals and was pursuing further evaluation of 72 others. The \nremaining 760 prisoners (almost 91% of the class) were deemed by the BOP “not appropriate for \nhome confinement at this time.”3 \n  In light of BOP’s failure to implement the order in Wilson in a meaningful manner, \nPetitioners respectfully request that this Court enter a more self-executing Order. Petitioners \nbelieve that any such Order should presume eligibility of the members of the proposed medically \nvulnerable Subclass at FCI Danbury for transfer to home confinement absent a showing by the \nBOP that such Subclass member presents a serious danger to the safety of the community, to be \n                                                 \n2   The BOP’s status report in Wilson is attached hereto as Exhibit D; Petitioners’ responsive Emergency \nMotion for Enforcement of the Preliminary Injunction is attached hereto as Exhibit E.   \n3  According to its submission, the BOP also determined that only a single one of the 243 medically \nvulnerable prisoners who had applied for compassionate release met the criteria for such release.

See Proposed Order ¶¶ 3-4. Further, the Order shall set \nforth a mechanism to adjudicate disputes concerning Subclass member suitability for home \nconfinement.  Id. ¶ 8.   \nIII.  Proposed Order as to the Class \n \n  Petitioners further request that this Court enter Orders directing that Respondents identify \nmembers of the Class (who are not members of the medically vulnerable Subclass) who are \neligible for home confinement, and that, consistent with the April 3, 2020 Memorandum from \nAttorney General Barr, in making such eligibility determinations, the percentage of sentence the \nprisoner has served or the and length of the Class member’s remaining sentence shall not be a \nfactor.  Petitioners further request an Order directing transfer to home confinement for the \nmembers of the Class so identified. \nIV.  Discovery Orders \n  Finally, Petitioners request that the Court enter Orders directing Respondents to provide \nspecific information about the testing that has been performed to date on both prisoners and staff \nat FCI Danbury, and the medical staffing coverage at the prison and further to order an expert \ninspection of the facility during the week of May 11 or as soon thereafter as practicable as agreed \nby the parties. \n   \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 26   Filed 05/07/20   Page 5 of 5\nDated May 7, 2020         Respectfully Submitted,  \n \n \n/s/  David S.

(ECF No. 35-1)    \n\n \n  CCasaes:e 4 3:2:200--ccvv--0000759649--JMGP  SD o  cD #o:c 4u9m  eFnilte 2d6: - 40 5  /F0i6le/2d0 0  52/ 0o7f /62.0   P  aPgaegIeD 3 # o: f6 779\nEven before the Court issued its preliminary injunction, the BOP was evaluating, and continues \nto evaluate, all of the approximately 170,000 federal inmates’ eligibility for transfer to home \nconfinement, consistent with the directives from Congress and the Attorney General and is also \nworking to consider requests for “compassionate release” pursuant to statutory and regulatory \nrequirements.  The BOP has undertaken this review at Elkton and, in the interest of expediting \nthe review, has provided additional staff from other BOP institutions and offices to assist \nElkton’s Case Management Coordinator’s Office with the evaluation of the inmates on the list of \n“medically vulnerable” inmates as defined by the Court for release through the methods \nidentified by the Court. The BOP’s compliance with this Court’s order is described more fully \nbelow. \nI.  Home Confinement \nThe BOP has the authority to transfer an inmate to home confinement for the remainder \nof his sentence pursuant to the provisions and limitations set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3624(c)(2) and \n34 U.S.C. §60541.  See also, BOP Program Statement 7320.01, Home Confinement and BOP \nOperations Memorandum, Home Confinement under the First Step Act, the Coronavirus Aid, \nRelief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), Pub.L. 116-136, Attorney General \nMemoranda dated March 26, 2020 and April 3, 2020, and BOP Memorandum dated April 15, \n2020.  As noted above, even before the Court issued its preliminary injunction, the BOP was \nevaluating the eligibility for home confinement of all inmates throughout the United States.  The \nBOP has continued that evaluation, including at Elkton, and as of May 5, 2020, BOP has \nevaluated the eligibility for home confinement of all of the inmates from the list of “medically \nvulnerable” inmates as defined by the Court.  As of May 5, 2020, five inmates are pending \ncommunity placement.  Another 72 inmates are being further evaluated for eligibility for home \n2 \n \n\n \n  CCasaes:e 4 3:2:200--ccvv--0000759649--JMGP  SD o  cD #o:c 4u9m  eFnilte 2d6: - 40 5  /F0i6le/2d0 0  53/ 0o7f /62.0   P  aPgaegIeD 4 # o: f6 780\nconfinement.  The remaining inmates identified on the list are not appropriate for home \nconfinement at this time.   \nII.  Compassionate Release  \nThe BOP does not have the authority to grant “compassionate release,” but upon an \ninmate's request, the Director of BOP may make a motion to an inmate's sentencing court to \nreduce a term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. § 4205(g) and 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(l)(A). This \nprocess is outlined in BOP Program Statement 5050.50, Compassionate Release/Reduction In \nSentence Procedures for Implementation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 3582 and 4205(g).  The First Step Act, \ncodified at 18 U.S.C. § 3582, and  the applicable regulations, 28 C.F.R § 571.61, specify that an \ninmate may file a Motion for Reduction of Sentence directly with the sentencing court after \nexhaustion of administrative remedies, or 30 days from the date the Warden receives such a \nrequest from the inmate, whichever is earlier. The sentencing court makes the ultimate decision \nwhether to grant compassionate release. As of May 5, 2020, 243 inmates on the list of \n“medically vulnerable” inmates as defined by the Court have submitted a request for \ncompassionate release to the Warden.  The BOP has evaluated those requests. Only one inmate \nof that group met the criteria for compassionate release. The BOP is currently working on a \nrelease plan for that inmate.  The remaining inmates who submitted requests did not meet the \ncriteria for compassionate release.  \nThe large majority of the remaining inmates on the list have not submitted requests for \ncompassionate release; consequently, BOP lacks information required by regulation to complete \nthe assessment.  However, BOP has identified six inmates on the list who, although they have \nnot formally requested compassionate release, BOP is currently considering pending further \nreview.   \n3 \n \n\n \n  CCasaes:e 4 3:2:200--ccvv--0000759649--JMGP  SD o  cD #o:c 4u9m  eFnilte 2d6: - 40 5  /F0i6le/2d0 0  54/ 0o7f /62.0   P  aPgaegIeD 5 # o: f6 781\nAmong other things, inmates are required to submit a release plan with their request.  See \n28 C.F.R. § 571.61.  A release plan is a critical part of BOP’s evaluation of a compassionate \nrelease request; release plans are highly individualized and developed by the inmate with \nassistance from BOP social workers and include information regarding where the inmate will \nreside, how the inmate will support himself, and where the inmate will receive medical treatment \nand how he will pay for such treatment. Without this information submitted to the Warden along \nwith the inmate’s request, the BOP is unable to assess the inmate for eligibility for \ncompassionate release.  And absent a request, BOP also cannot know whether a particular inmate \neven desires to seek compassionate release.  If additional Elkton inmates, including inmates on \nthe list of “medically vulnerable” inmates as defined by the Court, submit requests for \ncompassionate release, BOP will review and act on their requests as quickly as feasible.  \nIII.  Inmate Furloughs and Supervised Release \nThe BOP has the authority to temporarily release from custody (i.e. “furlough”) an \ninmate pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3622 and BOP Program Statement 5280.09, Inmate Furloughs.  \nThe issuance of furloughs is within the sole discretion of the BOP, and delegated to the Warden \nof each institution.  Furloughs are being considered in conjunction with other avenues of transfer \nor release in an effort to expedite the transfer of inmates nearing the end of a sentence.  \nFurloughs are not being used as a stand-alone basis for release from an institution. \nThe BOP has no legal authority to “release” inmates via parole or community \nsupervision.  Supervised release is a form of post-imprisonment supervision, although similar to \nparole, a term of supervised release does not replace a portion of the sentence of imprisonment, \nbut rather is an order of supervision in addition to any term of imprisonment imposed by the \nsentencing court. See eg. United States v. Reese, 71 F.3d 582, 587 (6th Cir. 1995) (\"supervised \n4 \n \n\n \n  CCasaes:e 4 3:2:200--ccvv--0000759649--JMGP  SD o  cD #o:c 4u9m  eFnilte 2d6: - 40 5  /F0i6le/2d0 0  55/ 0o7f /62.0   P  aPgaegIeD 6 # o: f6 782\nrelease is ... a sentence in itself ...\").  \nIV.  Updated COVID-19 Data From Elkton \nThe BOP’s considerable efforts to protect inmates at Elkton and throughout the United \nStates from the COVID-19 pandemic are showing positive results. The following information is \naccurate as of May 5, 2020.  \nTesting – On April 16, 2020, Elkton received an Abbott testing machine and 250 testing \ncassettes. The Abbott machine was removed on April 21, 2020.  A second Abbott machine was \ndelivered on April 29, 2020, with an additional 250 test cassettes.  Elkton is currently testing all \ninmates in quarantine who are pre-release.  These inmates are generally asymptomatic.  Elkton \nHealth Services have coordinated with an outside laboratory to complete mass testing.  That is \npending approval.  With approval, that testing could be immediately available to the institution. \nProtective Equipment – Inmates were provided two surgical masks initially, and an additional \ntwo cloth masks when they became available.   \nQuarantine – Currently there are 36 inmates in quarantine at the main facility and six inmates in \nquarantine at the Satellite Camp. \nHospitalizations – 20 Inmates remain hospitalized or in rehabilitation facilities. No new inmates \nhave required hospitalization since May 2, 2020.  8 inmates in hospitalization are intubated.

Confirmed cases have risen to 99 prisoners and 49 staff.2 One week ago, \nthose numbers were 49 and 48.3 The situation remains as dire and urgent as ever, and Respondents’ \nhalfhearted response measures have done little or nothing to stem the tide.

PPaaggeeI D3  o#f:  16294\norder from this Court to begin moving medically vulnerable prisoners out of Elkton, Respondents \nhave turned to a mixture of stalling tactics and outright defiance. \nThis Court ordered Respondents to evaluate and transfer vulnerable prisoners out of this \nepicenter of COVID-19—quickly. See ECF No. 22. As the Court reaffirmed yesterday, that Order \nrequired Respondents “to identify members of the subclass; evaluate each subclass member’s \neligibility for transfer within two weeks (by May 6), prioritizing the most medically vulnerable \ninmates; and transfer inmates ineligible for other forms of release to another BOP facility.” ECF \nNo. 45 at 1. Respondents were directed to assess each person’s possibility for “transfer out of \nElkton  through  any  means,  including  but  not  limited  to  compassionate  release,  parole  or \ncommunity supervision, transfer furlough, or non-transfer furlough[.]” ECF No. 22 at 20.  \nRespondents have already demonstrated, time and again, that they will not take such action \non their own. But under this Court’s Order, it is not for Respondents to decide whether the subclass \nshould be moved out of Elkton, but only how—beginning with the most vulnerable, and keeping \nin BOP facilities only those who are “ineligible for” release or home confinement. “None of the \nabove” is not an option that Respondents may continue to choose. See ECF No. 22 at 9 (injunction \nissued “ordering Respondents to  determine  the  appropriate  means of transferring  medically \nvulnerable subclass members out of Elkton”); id. at 20-21 (“Subclass members who are ineligible \nfor [release or home confinement] must be transferred to another BOP facility”). \nRespondents’ Status Report is a damning account of noncompliance with the letter and \nspirit of the Court’s Order. Rather than rebutting the showing of subjective deliberate indifference \nto the prisoners who are falling ill and dying in Respondents’ care, the Report confirms it on \nmultiple levels. First, Respondents have refused outright to evaluate prisoners for furlough as they \nwere ordered to do. Second, they have refused to conduct or facilitate compassionate release \n  2   \n\nCCasaes:e 4 3:2:200--ccvv--0000759649--JMGP  SD o  cD #o:c 5u1m  eFnilte 2d6: - 50 5  /F0i6le/2d0 0  53/ 0o7f /1210.     PPaaggeeI D4  o#f:  16295\nmeasures unless a prisoner directly applies, but have done nothing to advise them to do so. Cf. \nECF No. 41 at 15 (Respondents’ position that it would be “premature” even to begin measures to \nfully identify the medically vulnerable subclass). Third, they have regarded this Court’s Order as \na ceiling, not a floor—they have failed to identify any other mechanism for release or transfer. \nFourth, Respondents’ Status Report is silent on any measures of any kind to transfer to another \nfacility individuals who are ineligible for home confinement, or even to prepare to do so. Nor is \nthere any inkling that Respondents’ are prioritizing the most pressing cases—or any case.  \nThe paltry results of Respondents’ evaluations speak for themselves. Out of 837 medically \nvulnerable class members, which must be reduced by those who have already died while awaiting \nrelease, five are “pending community placement.” ECF No. 49 at 2. Only one has “met the criteria” \nfor compassionate release, and the BOP is “working on” a release plan. Id. at 3. Zero have been \napproved, or apparently considered, for furlough. Id. at 4. In passing, Respondents have even \nrewritten the Court’s instruction to consider “all Elkton inmates 65 years or older” into a list of \nthose “over the age of 65.” Id. at 1.4  \nMeanwhile, the stalling continues. Having already delayed production of their preliminary \nclass list until more than a week after the Court’s Order, Respondents argue today that their \nrequests to stay that Order—none of which have been granted by any Court, for any period of \ntime—should somehow justify delays in producing a proposed protective order that would enable \nemergency discovery. ECF No. 48 at 3-4. Even relevant discovery about the class list itself is \ndescribed as “unnecessarily divert[ing] BOP resources away from the health and security of the \n                                                 \n4 Respondents’ admission explains why at least two, and possibly more, 65 year-old prisoners were \nleft off the list, as noted in Petitioners’ Emergency Motion for Expedited Discovery. See ECF No. \n44 at 2 n. 1.  \n  3   \n\nCCasaes:e 4 3:2:200--ccvv--0000759649--JMGP  SD o  cD #o:c 5u1m  eFnilte 2d6: - 50 5  /F0i6le/2d0 0  54/ 0o7f /1210.     PPaaggeeI D5  o#f:  16296\ninmates.” ECF No. 48 at 2. On the contrary, given Respondents’ abject failure to protect their \ncharges’ health to date, rapid discovery is rendered all the more necessary. \nFederal courts are “not reduced to issuing injunctions against [government actors] and \nhoping for compliance. Once issued, an injunction may be enforced.” Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. \n678, 690 (1978). This Court’s Order was not an advisory opinion, and it did not merely suggest \nthat Respondents keep the parties and the Court informed while they continue their present, \ndemonstrably failed course. Social distancing remains impossible at Elkton, and the death toll \ncontinues to rise. Respondents’ defiant response to this Court’s Order—coupled with stalling \ntactics that threaten to run out the clock while the disease runs its course—is manifestly inadequate. \nAbsent the Court’s intervention, more people will die while Respondents continue their incessant \ndelays and deflections. \nARGUMENT \nI.  Respondents Have Failed To Conduct the Required Evaluations \nA.  Respondents Refuse To Conduct Any Review for Furloughs \nBy statute, the Bureau of Prisons may release a prisoner from his place of imprisonment \nfor a limited period, if the release is consistent with “the purpose for which the sentence was \nimposed” and any pertinent policy statement issued by the Sentencing Commission, if it is \n“otherwise consistent with the public interest,” and if there is “reasonable cause to believe that a \nprisoner will honor the trust to be imposed in him[.]” 18 U.S.C. § 3622. Purposes of such release \nmay include, among others, obtaining medical treatment. § 3622(a)(3). Sentenced prisoners housed \nin BOP facilities are eligible. See 28 C.F.R. § 570.31. Among other possibilities, emergency non-\ntransfer furloughs are available to “address a family crisis or other urgent situation.” 28 C.F.R. § \n570.32(b)(1). \n  4   \n\nCCasaes:e 4 3:2:200--ccvv--0000759649--JMGP  SD o  cD #o:c 5u1m  eFnilte 2d6: - 50 5  /F0i6le/2d0 0  55/ 0o7f /1210.     PPaaggeeI D6  o#f:  16297\nRespondents have conceded that BOP already has the authority to temporarily release \nindividuals from custody. See ECF No. 10-2 at p. 3 ¶ 7. They simply refuse to use it, as it is “only \nbeing used for those individuals who have been medically screened, considered to be at risk, and \non the advice of medical professionals.” Id. (“No FCI Elkton resident has met this criterion.”). The \nentire  medically-vulnerable  subclass  matches  that  description,  rendering  this  mechanism  an \nexcellent fit under the Court’s instruction to “evaluate each subclass member’s eligibility [for] \ntransfer furlough, or non-transfer furlough[.]” ECF No. 22 at 20.  \nBut faced with that direct order, Respondents have responded with outright defiance—no \none, in their unilateral view, will receive furlough “as a stand-alone basis for release from an \ninstitution.” ECF No. 49 at 4. No one, by their own account, has been evaluated for a furlough \nunder the Court’s Order, much less granted one. On its face, Respondents’ Status Report appears \nto recount a brazen repudiation of this Court’s Order as to furloughs.  \nB.  Respondents Have Evaluated Only a Fraction of the Medically Vulnerable Subclass \nfor Compassionate Release and Their Explanations Why Are Unavailing \nThe Court’s April 22 ruling ordered Respondents to “evaluate each subclass member’s \neligibility for transfer out of Elkton through any means, including but not limited to compassionate \nrelease,” among other measures. ECF No. 22 at 20. In response, BOP attempts to offload its \nresponsibility to comply onto the prisoners themselves. Arguing that BOP lacks standalone \n“authority to grant ‘compassionate release,’” Respondents’ Status Report states that they have \nevaluated only 243 of the prisoners on their own privately generated list of medically vulnerable \nsubclass members because those were the only subclass members who had “submitted a request \nfor compassionate release.” ECF No. 49 at 3. They argue that the lack of a proposed “release plan” \nis a barrier to considering subclass members who have not yet made a request, as is not knowing \n“whether a particular inmate even desires to seek compassionate release.” Id. at 4. Thus far, they \n  5   \n\nCCasaes:e 4 3:2:200--ccvv--0000759649--JMGP  SD o  cD #o:c 5u1m  eFnilte 2d6: - 50 5  /F0i6le/2d0 0  56/ 0o7f /1210.     PPaaggeeI D7  o#f:  16298\nreport that only 1 of those 243 prisoners “met the criteria for compassionate release,” and it appears \nthat even that prisoner has not yet actually been released. Id. at 3.  \nRespondents’ lack of action amounts to abdication of their responsibility to follow the \nOrder. The Court “order[ed] Respondents to evaluate each subclass member’s eligibility for,” \namong other avenues, “compassionate release.” ECF No. 22 at 20. The Order did not say anything \nabout evaluating only those inmates who took the threshold step of making a request. See id. \nFurthermore, Respondents’ own report demonstrates that they are perfectly capable of evaluating \ninmates who have not made requests: they note that “BOP has identified six inmates on the list \nwho,  although  they  have  not  formally  requested  compassionate  release,  BOP  is  currently \nconsidering.” Status Report, ECF No. 49 at 3.5 Yet Respondents leave unexplained why the 588 \nother prisoners on BOP’s list of 837 prisoners were not similarly evaluated. More generally, and \nself-evidently, that Respondents have thus far identified only one qualifying prisoner at a low-\nsecurity facility like Elkton calls into the question the vigor of their efforts.6  \n   \n                                                 \n5 Indeed, some courts are waiving compassionate-release exhaustion requirements altogether in \nlight of the pandemic. E.g., United States v. Zukerman, No. 16 CR. 194 (AT), 2020 WL 1659880, \nat  *2  (S.D.N.Y.  Apr.  3,  2020)  (“[T]he  Court  holds  that  Zukerman’s  exhaustion  of  the \nadministrative process can be waived in light of the extraordinary threat posed—in his unique \ncircumstances—by the COVID-19 pandemic.”). Moreover, there is certainly no reason to believe \nthat a prisoner must consent to be evaluated for compassionate release. Even assuming for \nargument’s sake that some prisoners would object to compassionate release, those prisoners would \nsurely have a chance to voice their objections before being forcibly compassionately released by \nRespondents. \n6 Respondents' ambivalence may also be reflected in their opposition to at least one \ncompassionate-release petition brought in this District by an Elkton prisoner, who supplemented \nhis motion based on COVID-19. See United States v. Smith, No. 4:15-CR-19, 2020 WL \n2063417, at *2, 4 (N.D. Ohio Apr. 29, 2020) (noting that Government opposed the prisoner's \nsupplemental motion on exhaustion grounds and denying relief while observing that the prisoner \n“may be a member of the subclass” involved in this habeas litigation).  \n \n  6   \n\nCCasaes:e 4 3:2:200--ccvv--0000759649--JMGP  SD o  cD #o:c 5u1m  eFnilte 2d6: - 50 5  /F0i6le/2d0 0  57/ 0o7f /1210.     PPaaggeeI D8  o#f:  16299\nC.  Respondents Have Failed to Explain Why They Have Not Considered Other Means \nto Comply with the Court’s Order \nThe Court directed the Bureau of Prisons to determine eligibility “through any means, \nincluding but not limited to … parole or community supervision… ” Order, ECF No. 22 at 20. The \nRespondents have opted to interpret the order quite narrowly, and then not to comply with even \nthat. To begin, Respondents argue that “BOP has no legal authority to ‘release’ inmates via parole \nor community supervision,” because “a term of supervised release does not replace a portion of \nthe sentence of imprisonment.” Status Report, ECF 49 at 4. As Respondents well know, the Court \nwas not suggesting that an additional punishment should be imposed on the prisoners, but that \nBOP should use community-based placements, with conditions, as necessary to implement the \nCourt’s order. Further, the Government’s terse defiance fails to explain why it is refusing to use \nBureau of Prison’s significant authority to transfer people to alternative forms of confinement, \nincluding home detention, while imposing conditions. That BOP is again choosing not to take \nnecessary steps only underscores the necessity of further action by this Court. \nII.  Respondents Have Failed To Describe Any Action To Transfer Prisoners \nAs noted above, this Court’s Order requires that those individuals who are “ineligible for \ncompassionate release, home release, or parole or community supervision must be transferred to \nanother BOP facility where appropriate measures … may be accomplished.” ECF No. 22 at 20–\n21. Respondents acknowledged as much in seeking a stay from this Court. Stay Mem., ECF No. \n30-1 at 2–3, 8, 15. And the Court’s May 5 Order reiterated that Respondents must “evaluate each \nsubclass member’s eligibility for transfer within two weeks (by May 6), prioritizing the most \nmedically vulnerable inmates; and transfer inmates ineligible for other forms of release to another \nBOP facility.” Order, ECF 45 at 1; accord Sixth Circuit Order, App. ECF 23-2 at 1–2.    \n  7   \n\nCCasaes:e 4 3:2:200--ccvv--0000759649--JMGP  SD o  cD #o:c 5u1m  eFnilte 2d6: - 50 5  /F0i6le/2d0 0  58/ 0o7f /1210.     PPaaggeeI D9  o#f:  17200\nDespite this unambiguous instruction, Respondents’ Status Report says nothing about \ntransferring any prisoners to any other facility, having plans in place to do so, or in fact doing \nanything at all to begin these urgent transfers—for the most medically vulnerable, or for anyone \nelse.  Respondents  argued,  in  pursuing  a  stay,  that  transferring  inmates  is  “an  extremely \nburdensome process,” Stay Mem., ECF 30-1 at 15, but that is all the more reason to begin the \nprocess, and it certainly does not excuse them from compliance. That there is no indication that \nthey have initiated, let alone effected, even a single transfer flies directly in the face of what \nRespondents were ordered to do.  \nIII.  Respondents’ Efforts To Shield This Process from Discovery Renders the Full Extent \nof Their Noncompliance Unknown \nEven  those  evaluations  that  Respondents  have  actually  undertaken  have  resulted  in \nabsurdly low numbers of individuals approved for release. See Status Report, ECF No. 49. Of the \n837 known subclass members—a number that is known to be underinclusive, e.g., supra n. 4—\nRespondents have approved six people, or 0.7% of the subclass, for some form of release. That is \nequal to the number that had already been approved for home confinement transfers before \nRespondents answered the Petition in this case. See ECF No. 10-2 at ¶ 20. Respondents have not, \nin other words, stepped up their pace in response to this Court’s Order.  \nInstead, they appear to be applying a set of unattainable filtering criteria. The reasoning for \neach rejection remains known only to Respondents, as they refuse to answer discovery about the \nconditional class. See Opp., ECF No. 48, at 2-3. Across multiple cases, the BOP has taken \ncontradictory and shifting views on what criteria apply for home confinement, for example.7 \n                                                 \n7 Neena Satija & Matt Zapotosky, Amid coronavirus pandemic, federal inmates get mixed signals \nabout  home-confinement  releases,  WASHINGTON  POST  (April  24,  2020), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/amid-coronavirus-pandemic-federal-inmates-\nget-mixed-signals-about-home-confinement-releases/2020/04/24/0bbc5458-84de-11ea-a3eb-\ne9fc93160703_story.html. \n  8   \n\nCCaassee:  43::2200--ccvv--0000759649--JMGP S D  o Dc o#c: u5m1 e Fnitl e2d6:- 5 0  5 F/0il6e/d2 00 5 9/0 o7f/ 2101 .    PPaaggee I1D0  #o:f  71021\nIndeed, BOP’s approach to home confinement in the COVID-19 crisis has been described as \n“Kafkaesque” and “an illogical and self-defeating policy that appears to be inconsistent with the \ndirective of the Attorney General, ungrounded in science, and a danger to both [the prisoner] and \nthe public health of the community.” United States v. Scparta, No. 18-CR-578 (AJN), 2020 WL \n1910481, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 20, 2020). Furloughs, according to Respondents, are at the \nWarden’s discretion, applying wholly unknown criteria within the statutory boundaries of that \ndiscretion. See Status Report, ECF No. 49 at 4. The results, however, speak for themselves. \nRespondents’ glacial pace and minuscule scope of releases to date simply underscores the need for \nexpedited discovery and enforcement of this Court’s Order. Respondents have proven that left to \nproceed at their own discretion, they will do little or nothing to expedite releases or transfers. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Petitioners respectfully request that this Court take appropriate \nmeasures to enforce compliance with its April 22, 2020 Order. \n \n   \n  9   \n\nCCasaes:e 4 3:2:200--ccvv--0000759649--JMGP  SD o  cD #o:c 5u1m  eFnilte 2d6: - 50 5  /F0i6le/2d0 0  51/00 7o/f2 101  .

I am currently incarcerated at FCI Danbury.  My Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) Register \nNumber is 48169-054.   \n \n2.  I am 54 years old.  I am currently housed in the D unit at FCI Danbury. There are \napproximately 60 men in my unit right now.   \n \n3.  On Thursday, May 7, 2020, a man who sleeps in the bunk bed next to me (an arms’ \nlength away) tested positive for COVID-19. I know this man’s name but will not use it \nhere to maintain his privacy.  \n \n4.  On the morning of May 7, I walked this man to the case manager’s office because he was \nso sick. The case manager told him to go lay down. I told the man to go bang on the case \nmanager’s door and demand help. After he did this, he was escorted to medical. \n \n5.  This man had been asking for medical help for two weeks and each time was told that he \ndid not have a fever and should just go lay down. I saw him being turned away on \nmultiple occasions.   \n \n6.  After this man was removed from the unit on May 7, his bed sheets and blankets were left \non his bed, which is right across from my bed. His towels were left in his area too. As of \ntoday, these items have not been removed and his area has not been cleaned.  When we \ncomplained to staff, we were told to clean the area ourselves. However, we were not \ngiven cleaning supplies and protective equipment to do this cleaning.  \n \n7.  A man who came into the unit from the SHU was put in the top bunk right above where \nthe man who tested positive for COVID-19 had been sleeping.   \n \n8.  A second man was also removed from the unit on May 7. I know this man’s name as well \nbut will not use it here to maintain his privacy. I understand from a government filing in \nmy compassionate release case that this second man tested negative for COVID-19. This \nman slept two bunks away from me and has been sick for around two months.  He was \npassing blood in his stool, which he showed to me and other inmates. He asked for \nmedical care on many occasions.  \n \n9.  Through the window in my unit, I saw this second man being escorted to the A unit. My \nunderstanding is that the A unit is for those inmates who have tested positive for the \nvirus. \n \n10. Staff have not removed the dirty laundry and dirty clothes from this second man’s bed \nand living area, and they have refused to clean the area.    \n \n11. I am not aware of anyone in the unit who has been tested for COVID-19 since May 7, \nother than the two men who were removed that day.  \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 27-1   Filed 05/11/20   Page 2 of 2\n12. I am aware of three other men in my unit who tested positive prior to May 7.  \n \n13. Multiple men are currently showing symptoms of COVID-19 and have not been tested. \nOne of the men who is coughing has COPD and is refusing to wear a mask. \n \n14. No medical staff have been in the unit since Friday, May 8.  \n \n15. I am concerned about my cardiac condition because I am having numbness in the left side \nof my face and my left arm is weaker than normal.  \n \n16. I suffer from serious chronic medical conditions including asthma, coronary artery \ndisease, hypertension, Prinzmetal angina, cervical disc disease, lumbar disc disease, \ngastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett’s esophagus, and diverticulitis resulting \nin a hernia in the colon wall. I have a soft tissue mass on my upper cervical spine \nresulting in partial paralysis that requires immediate surgery. I have had three heart \nattacks and have had pneumonia in my right lung more than 20 times. I cannot digest \nrice, beans or greens. I am severely allergic to ragweed, shellfish, trees and chlorophyll \n(including in green vegetables). I am morbidly obese. \n \n17. I was seen by a physician’s assistant on April 29 who said an emergency cardiac \ncatheterization and colonoscopy would be ordered. To date, I have not had these \nprocedures. When a procedure is ordered, it will appear in an inmate’s Trulincs account \nunder “consultation.” The procedures I was told would be ordered do not appear in my \naccount. I was also told on April 29 that I would be reevaluated again in a week to see if \nmy cardiac medication needed to be adjusted. I have not been seen since April 29.  \n \n18. Although a BOP doctor at FCI Danbury ordered that I be provided with a special medical \ndiet, this diet is not being provided to me. I cannot digest food containing chlorophyll, \nwhich is in much of the food being provided. The doctor told me that the cardiac episodes \nI am having may be related to the special medical diet not being given. I have been \nexperiencing severe discomfort and sharp pains in my abdominal wall.  \n \n19. I declare under the penalty of perjury that the contents of this declaration are true and correct \nto the best of my knowledge. I will sign a hard copy of this declaration at my earliest \nopportunity.  \n \n \n_____/s/____________ \nKenneth Cassidy  \nMay 10, 2020  \n \n \n\nCaCsaes e1 :31:72-0c-rc-0v0-0101566-W9-MMSP-SM  J DRo  c Dumoceunmt 2e7n-t 26 7   F  iFleidle d0 50/51/10/82/02 0   P  aPgaeg e1  1o fo 2f 2\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \n_______________________________________________                                      \n \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA           \n                                                              \n        -v-                  17-CR-116 \n                 \nKENNETH CASSIDY,               \n \nDefendant. \n_______________________________________________ \n \n \nGOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S \nSUPPLEMENTAL AFFIRMATION \n \n \n  THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, by and through its attorney, James P. \nKennedy,  Jr.,  United  States  Attorney  for  the  Western  District  of  New  York,  and  the \nundersigned  Assistant  United  States  Attorney,  respectfully  files  this  response  to  the \ndefendant’s  supplemental  affirmation.

I am currently incarcerated at FCI Danbury.  My Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) Register \nNumber is 27135-171.   \n \n2.  I am 47 years old.  I am currently housed in the D unit at FCI Danbury.  \n \n3.  The D unit is a dormitory style unit, with rows of bunk beds.  Currently, there are \napproximately 60 men in the unit.  \n \n4.  On May 7, 2020, two men who were sick were removed from our unit.  We were initially \ntold both men had tested positive for COVID-19 but later told only one had tested \npositive.  \n \n5.  As of today, the staff have not removed the dirty sheets and blankets off the beds where \nthese sick men were sleeping.  They have also not cleaned their living areas, lockers, and \nbins.  \n \n6.  Since the men were taken out of the unit on May 7, many of the other men in my unit are \nshowing symptoms of the virus including coughing, chills, severe headaches, and body \naches.  \n \n7.  I have heard staff tell men to stop complaining about their symptoms if they don’t have a \nfever. I have also heard staff say if you keep complaining you will be put in the A unit.  \n(The A unit is where they are housing men who have tested positive for the virus).  \n \n8.  I am not aware of anyone in the unit who has been tested since May 7. \n \n9.  I suffer from hyperglycemia and had gastric bypass surgery before coming into BOP \ncustody. Recent blood work showed my liver and pancreas levels were double what is \nnormal. I am experiencing severe numbness in my hands. My blood pressure was last \ntested on either May 4 or May 5 and was 190/100, which is alarming to me. On that same \nday, the doctor said a scope for internal injuries would be ordered. However, I have not \nbeen told when this procedure will occur.    \n \n10.

He had been \nasking for help at sick call but told to stop complaining because he didn’t have a fever. \nHe was tested on May 4 and told he was negative for the virus. He told me that when he \nwas tested, a medical staff member who was watching told the person doing the test that \nthe swab had not been pushed up in the nose far enough. He was not retested at that time.   \n \n5.  The other man removed from the unit had been sick for around two weeks. He went to \nthe case manager on May 7 to ask for help. He was told to go lay down. He then started \nscreaming and they took him to medical.  We’ve been told he tested positive.   \n \n6.

EASTER & MICHAEL CARVAJAL, \nDefendants. \n \nCONFERENCE MEMORANDUM AND ORDER \nAt a status conference today, the Court discussed with counsel the Respondent’s efforts \nto comply with the Court’s temporary restraining order (ECF No. 30).  During the discussion, \ncounsel for the Petitioners and counsel for the Respondent represented that they had agreed (1) \nthat, to ensure that “substantial weight” is accorded to each inmate’s COVID-19 risk factors, \nECF No. 30 at 71, Respondent will arrange for a medical clinician to review the medical profiles \n(in particular, the medical “dashboard” in the BEMERS system) as to each inmate who was \npreviously reviewed for home confinement as set forth in the worksheets filed as ECF No. 59 on \nthe docket, and (2) that Respondent will use additional ICD codes supplied by Petitioners to \nsearch the BEMERS system to determine whether additional inmates should be included in the \nmedically vulnerable subclass described in paragraph 1 of the Court’s temporary restraining \norder, ECF No. 30 at 69, ECF No. 64 at 1.  The parties also agreed to confer further with an eye \ntowards reaching agreement about (1) the role the above-mentioned medical clinician will play \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 68   Filed 05/28/20   Page 2 of 6\nin the review process as a whole, including whether he or she will generate specific, written \nassessments as to the severity of each inmate’s risk factors and how the Respondent will weigh \nand incorporate any such assessments in the home confinement review process as a whole, (2) \nparticular ICD codes that, if present in an inmate’s medical record, will automatically qualify \nthat inmate for inclusion in the above-mentioned medically vulnerable subclass, and (3) a means \nof identifying inmates who should be included in the subclass but are not captured by the agreed-\nupon ICD codes.  Regarding the last item in the preceding sentence, the Respondent shall file a \ndeclaration by close of business on June 1 as to the costs and/or burden associated with the \npetitioners’ proposal that inmates be provided with notice of the pendency of this action and a \nmeans to forward HIPAA-compliant medical record releases to petitioners’ counsel (should the \ninmates choose to do so), together with the costs and/or burden of searching for and providing to \npetitioners’ counsel any medical records authorized for release under such a process.  The \nparties shall, by close of business on June 2, 2020, file a notice describing any agreements \nthey reach on these matters and indicating whether court intervention is needed as to any \nitems on which they cannot agree. \n  The Court also discussed with counsel the Court’s need better to understand the home \nconfinement review process undertaken by the Warden in response to the temporary restraining \norder.  As discussed on the call, counsel shall meet and confer about (1) generating a random \nsample of the records reviewed by the Warden and her staff in the process reflected in the \nworksheets filed on the docket (ECF No. 59), and (2) providing the sample to the Petitioners’ \nexpert, as suggested in item #6 in Section V. of the Petitioners’ May 27 filing (ECF No. 67 at 8).   \nThe parties shall file any agreement about the sampling process on the docket on or before \nJune 4, 2020. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 68   Filed 05/28/20   Page 3 of 6\n  The Court also discussed with counsel the extent to which the information on the \nspreadsheet filed as docket #66 regarding the release status of those deemed eligible for home \nconfinement shows that the Warden has fully complied with the Court’s temporary restraining \norder.  Paragraph 2a. of the temporary restraining order states that Respondent shall “modify[] \nany requirement that a person approved for home confinement be quarantined at the facility for \n14 days to allow for immediate release to home confinement for those inmates as to whom \nRespondent verifies, after reasonable inquiry, that the inmate is not showing symptoms and is \nable to self-isolate for the same period in the home confinement setting.”  (ECF No. 30 at 71.)  \nAlthough the Court recognizes that the Respondent and her counsel have devoted \nsubstantial resources to their efforts to comply with the temporary restraining order in general, it \ndoes not appear that the Respondent has complied with the above-quoted language of Paragraph \n2a. of the order.  More specifically, there is no evidence in any of the worksheets or other filings \nby Respondent that any efforts have been made to determine whether inmates approved for home \nconfinement can be released immediately to home confinement because they are able to self-\nisolate at home.  Further, it appears from the worksheets and the spreadsheet filed as docket No. \n66 that, as to most or all of those inmates who were rejected on initial review by the Warden and \nher staff, but later approved by the “home confinement committee” (i.e., personnel from BOP’s \ncentral office in Washington, D.C., ECF No. 57-1 at 4), all of them have either already been \nquarantined (in the case of camp inmates) or are being quarantined as of 5/28/2020; but none of \nthem have actually been released as of 5/28/2020.  See ECF No. 66.  Further, most of those \nindicated as having been “released” on the spreadsheet appear to have been recommended for \nhome confinement even before the Court issued its temporary restraining order; as to several, for \nexample, the worksheets are blank and simply indicate that the person is being released to home \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 68   Filed 05/28/20   Page 4 of 6\nconfinement.  A few described as “released” – including two male inmates listed on the \nspreadsheet with initials MT and BH and a female inmate RA from the camp – do not even \nappear in the worksheets and were apparently not part of the court-ordered home confinement \nreview process at all.  Critically, all the inmates shown on the spreadsheet as having been \napproved for home confinement are persons who, the Warden agrees, should be placed in home \nconfinement due to COVID-19 risk factors and other considerations.  While the Court \nunderstands that the Warden and her staff may need some time to “process people out,” it is not \nclear why they need more than a few days to do so; further, as noted, there is no evidence the \nWarden has attempted to determine, “after reasonable inquiry,” that these inmates could not self-\nisolate at home.   \nTherefore, by way of ensuring full compliance with its temporary restraining order, the \nCourt orders that, by close of business on June 4, 2020, the Respondent shall, with respect to \neach inmate shown on the spreadsheet (ECF No. 66) who has been approved for home \nconfinement either (1) release such inmate to home confinement, or (2) demonstrate that public \nsafety or medical considerations or the absence of any home in which to place the inmate would \nmake it unsafe to move the inmate immediately to home confinement.  Given the amount of time \nalready taken to investigate each inmate’s proposed release plan and the amount of additional \ntime the Court is allowing for compliance with this order, it will not be a sufficient response to \nthe “show cause” portion of this order for the Respondent to state that the release plan is still \nbeing investigated or that details need to be worked out. \n  Finally, as the Court discussed with counsel, it appears from the worksheets (ECF No. \n59) that, during the review process, mistakes were made regarding PATTERN scores that may \nhave caused inmates to be denied home confinement based on incorrect information.  The Court \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 68   Filed 05/28/20   Page 5 of 6\nalso discussed that the worksheets of some inmates who were denied home confinement list \nmedical, COVID-19 risk, public safety risk, and other information that is substantively identical \nto the corresponding information in the worksheets of inmates who were granted home \nconfinement.  Respondent’s counsel explained that Respondent had faced tight time pressure \n(imposed by the Court) to review a large number of inmate profiles, and expressed a willingness \nto re-review particular inmate profiles to ensure that the correct information was used and \nconsistent judgments were made.  In light of this, the Court further orders that the Respondent \nspecifically re-review for home confinement consideration and send to the home confinement \ncommittee for its consideration (1) those inmates shown on Attachment A of ECF No. 67 and \n(2) any inmate whose “case narrative” or “final decision” explaining the reviewer’s denial on the \nworksheets (ECF No. 59) cites only one or more of the following factors: (a) the amount of time \nleft to serve and/or the percentage of time served, (b) any non-violent or non-sexually related \ndisciplinary infractions, (c) non-violent conduct occurring during pretrial release, (d) the \nexistence of pending charges, unless there is a detainer, (e) a PATTERN score of “low” or \n“medium,” (f) a history of violence that is greater than 15 years old, (g) the seriousness of any \nnon-violent or non-sexual offense of conviction, and/or (h) the fact that the inmate has been \ndesignated to or is awaiting placement in a Residential Reentry Center (see, e.g., ECF No. 59 at \n312, 572, 611, 626, 629, 644, 652, and 707).  To avoid later suggestions of further mistakes, by \nclose of business on June 1, 2020, Petitioners’ counsel shall provide Respondent’s counsel with \na list of any inmates who, in the view of Petitioners’ counsel, meet the description set forth in the \npreceding sentence.  But if there are disagreements as to whether any particular inmate meets \nthat description, the Respondent’s view shall prevail for purposes of determining the group to re-\nreview under this paragraph.  If necessary, the Court will adjudicate disputes later.  The \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 68   Filed 05/28/20   Page 6 of 6\nRespondent shall complete the re-review described in this paragraph by June 9, 2020, and shall \nfile a declaration and worksheets setting forth the details of this process by close of business on \nthat date. \nTo be clear, the Court is not suggesting that persons who do not meet the criteria set forth \nin the preceding paragraph are inappropriate for home confinement or should not be re-reviewed \nfor home confinement; rather, simply to ensure that the process is consistent, the Court is at this \ntime requiring re-review and submission to the home confinement committee of inmate profiles \nthat closely resemble those of other inmates whom the home confinement committee has already \napproved for home confinement.  It is also the Court’s understanding that all of the inmates who \nwere previously reviewed for home confinement will be reviewed again with the input of a \nclinician, as described above.  The Court leaves to the parties to discuss whether it would be \nmost efficient to coordinate the two re-reviews as a single process.  In any event, both re-reviews \n(either singly or in combination) shall be completed – and any additional or corrected \ndeclarations and worksheets filed – by close of business on June 9, 2020. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \n    /s/   \n  Michael P.

Background and Qualifications \n \n1.  I am Dr. Jaimie Meyer, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Yale School of Medicine \nand Assistant Clinical Professor of Nursing at Yale School of Nursing in New Haven, \nConnecticut. I am board certified in Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases and Addiction \nMedicine.  I completed my residency in Internal Medicine at NY Presbyterian Hospital at \nColumbia, New York, in 2008. I completed a fellowship in clinical Infectious Diseases at \nYale School of Medicine in 2011 and a fellowship in Interdisciplinary HIV Prevention at \nthe Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS in 2012. I hold a Master of Science in \nBiostatistics and Epidemiology from Yale School of Public Health. \n2.  I have worked for over a decade on infectious diseases in the context of jails and prisons. \nFrom 2008-2016, I served as the Infectious Disease physician for York Correctional \nInstitution in Niantic, Connecticut, which is the only state jail and prison for women in \nConnecticut.  In that capacity, I was responsible for the management of HIV, Hepatitis C, \ntuberculosis, and other infectious diseases in the facility.  Since then, I have maintained a \ndedicated HIV clinic in the community for patients returning home from prison and jail.  \nFor over a decade, I have been continuously funded by the NIH, industry, and \nfoundations for clinical research on HIV prevention and treatment for people involved in \nthe criminal justice system, including those incarcerated in closed settings (jails and \nprisons) and in the community under supervision (probation and parole).  I have served as \nan expert consultant on infectious diseases and women’s health in jails and prisons for the \nUN Office on Drugs and Crimes, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and others.  I also served \nas an expert health witness for the US Commission on Civil Rights Special Briefing on \nWomen in Prison.      \n3.  I have written and published extensively on the topics of infectious diseases among \npeople involved in the criminal justice system including book chapters and articles in \nleading peer-reviewed journals (including Lancet HIV, JAMA Internal Medicine, \nAmerican Journal of Public Health, International Journal of Drug Policy) on issues of \nprevention, diagnosis, and management of HIV, Hepatitis C, and other infectious diseases \namong people involved in the criminal justice system.  In making the following \nstatements, I am not commenting on the particular issues posed this case. Rather, I am \nmaking general statements about the realities of persons in detention facilities, jails and \nprisons. \n4.  My C.V. includes a full list of my honors, experience, and publications, and it is attached \nas Exhibit A.  \n5.  I was paid $1,000 for my time drafting an earlier version of this report filed in another \ncase. I subsequently prepared this version of the report without receiving payment for my \nservices. \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 9\n \n6.  I testified as an expert at a single trial or by deposition in the past four years: State v. \nFrank Sanville, Docket No. 263-3-18 Wrcr (Vermont) on April 21, 2020. \nII.  Heightened Risk of Epidemics in Jails and Prisons \n \n7.  The risk posed by infectious diseases in jails and prisons is significantly higher than in \nthe community, both in terms of risk of transmission, exposure, and harm to individuals \nwho become infected. There are several reasons this is the case, as delineated further \nbelow.    \n8.  Globally, outbreaks of contagious diseases are all too common in closed detention \nsettings and are more common than in the community at large.  Prisons and jails are not \nisolated from communities.  Staff, visitors, contractors, and vendors pass between \ncommunities and facilities and can bring infectious diseases into facilities.  Moreover, \nrapid turnover of jail and prison populations means that people often cycle between \nfacilities and communities.  People often need to be transported to and from facilities to \nattend court and move between facilities.  Prison health is public health. \n9.  Reduced prevention opportunities: Congregate settings such as jails and prisons allow for \nrapid spread of infectious diseases that are transmitted person to person, especially those \npassed by droplets through coughing and sneezing. When people must share dining halls, \nbathrooms, showers, and other common areas, the opportunities for transmission are \ngreater. When infectious diseases are transmitted from person to person by droplets, the \nbest initial strategy is to practice social distancing.  When jailed or imprisoned, people \nhave much less of an opportunity to protect themselves by social distancing than they \nwould in the community. Spaces within jails and prisons are often also poorly ventilated, \nwhich promotes highly efficient spread of diseases through droplets. Placing someone in \nsuch a setting therefore dramatically reduces their ability to protect themselves from \nbeing exposed to and acquiring infectious diseases.  \n10. Disciplinary segregation or solitary confinement is not an effective disease containment \nstrategy.  Beyond the known detrimental mental health effects of solitary confinement, \nisolation of people who are ill in solitary confinement results in decreased medical \nattention and increased risk of death.  Isolation of people who are ill using solitary \nconfinement also is an ineffective way to prevent transmission of the virus through \ndroplets to others because, except in specialized negative pressure rooms (rarely in \nmedical units if available at all), air continues to flow outward from rooms to the rest of \nthe facility.  Risk of exposure is thus increased to other people in prison and staff.  \n11. Reduced prevention opportunities: During an infectious disease outbreak, people can \nprotect themselves by washing hands.  Jails and prisons do not provide adequate \nopportunities to exercise necessary hygiene measures, such as frequent handwashing or \nuse of alcohol-based sanitizers when handwashing is unavailable.  Jails and prisons are \noften under-resourced and ill-equipped with sufficient hand soap and alcohol-based \nsanitizers for people detained in and working in these settings.  High-touch surfaces \n(doorknobs, light switches, etc.) should also be cleaned and disinfected regularly with \nbleach to prevent virus spread, but this is often not done in jails and prisons because of a \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 9\n \nlack of cleaning supplies and lack of people available to perform necessary cleaning \nprocedures.  \n12. Reduced prevention opportunities: During an infectious disease outbreak, a containment \nstrategy requires people who are ill with symptoms to be isolated and that caregivers have \naccess to personal protective equipment, including gloves, masks, gowns, and eye \nshields.  Jails and prisons are often under-resourced and ill-equipped to provide sufficient \npersonal protective equipment for people who are incarcerated and caregiving staff, \nincreasing the risk for everyone in the facility of a widespread outbreak.  \n13. Increased susceptibility: People incarcerated in jails and prisons are more susceptible to \nacquiring and experiencing complications from infectious diseases than the population in \nthe community.1 This is because people in jails and prisons are more likely than people in \nthe community to have chronic underlying health conditions, including diabetes, heart \ndisease, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, and lower immune systems from \nHIV. \n14. Jails and prisons are often poorly equipped to diagnose and manage infectious disease \noutbreaks.  Some jails and prisons lack onsite medical facilities or 24-hour medical care.  \nThe medical facilities at jails and prisons are almost never sufficiently equipped to handle \nlarge outbreaks of infectious diseases. To prevent transmission of droplet-borne \ninfectious diseases, people who are infected and ill need to be isolated in specialized \nairborne negative pressure rooms.  Most jails and prisons have few negative pressure \nrooms if any, and these may be already in use by people with other conditions (including \ntuberculosis or influenza).  Resources will become exhausted rapidly and any beds \navailable will soon be at capacity. This makes both containing the illness and caring for \nthose who have become infected much more difficult. \n15. Jails and prisons lack access to vital community resources to diagnose and manage \ninfectious diseases. Jails and prisons do not have access to community health resources \nthat can be crucial in identifying and managing widespread outbreaks of infectious \ndiseases.  This includes access to testing equipment, laboratories, and medications. \n16. Jails and prisons often need to rely on outside facilities (hospitals, emergency \ndepartments) to provide intensive medical care given that the level of care they can \nprovide in the facility itself is typically relatively limited. During an epidemic, this will \nnot be possible, as those outside facilities will likely be at or over capacity themselves.   \n17. Health safety: As an outbreak spreads through jails, prisons, and communities, medical \npersonnel become sick and do not show up to work. Absenteeism means that facilities \ncan become dangerously understaffed with healthcare providers. This increases a number \nof risks and can dramatically reduce the level of care provided.  As health systems inside \nfacilities are taxed, people with chronic underlying physical and mental health conditions \nand serious medical needs may not be able to receive the care they need for these \n                                                 \n1 Active case finding for communicable diseases in prisons, 391 The Lancet 2186 (2018), \nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31251-0/fulltext. \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 5 of 9\n \nconditions.  As supply chains become disrupted during a global pandemic, the availability \nof medicines and food may be limited. \n18. Safety and security: As an outbreak spreads through jails, prisons, and communities, \ncorrectional officers and other security personnel become sick and do not show up to \nwork.  Absenteeism poses substantial safety and security risk to both the people inside \nthe facilities and the public.   \n19. These risks have all been borne out during past epidemics of influenza in jails and \nprisons. For example, in 2012, the CDC reported an outbreak of influenza in 2 facilities \nin Maine, resulting in two inmate deaths.2  Subsequent CDC investigation of 995 inmates \nand 235 staff members across the 2 facilities discovered insufficient supplies of influenza \nvaccine and antiviral drugs for treatment of people who were ill and prophylaxis for \npeople who were exposed.  During the H1N1-strain flu outbreak in 2009 (known as the \n“swine flu”), jails and prisons experienced a disproportionately high number of cases.3  \nEven facilities on “quarantine” continued to accept new intakes, rendering the quarantine \nincomplete. These scenarios occurred in the “best case” of influenza, a viral infection for \nwhich there was an effective and available vaccine and antiviral medications, unlike \nCOVID-19, for which there is currently neither. \nIII.  Profile of COVID-19 as an Infectious Disease4 \n \n20.  The novel coronavirus, officially known as SARS-CoV-2, causes a disease known as \nCOVID-19.  The virus is thought to pass from person to person primarily through \nrespiratory droplets (by coughing or sneezing) but may also survive on inanimate \nsurfaces.  People seem to be most able to transmit the virus to others when they are \nsickest but it is possible that people can transmit the virus before they start to show \nsymptoms or for weeks after their symptoms resolve.  In China, where COVID-19 \noriginated, the average infected person passed the virus on to 2-3 other people; \ntransmission occurred at a distance of 3-6 feet.  Not only is the virus very efficient at \nbeing transmitted through droplets, everyone is at risk of infection because our immune \nsystems have never been exposed to or developed protective responses against this virus. \nA vaccine is currently in development but will likely not be able for another year to the \n                                                 \n2 Influenza Outbreaks at Two Correctional Facilities — Maine, March 2011, Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention (2012), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6113a3.htm. \n3 David M.

Antiviral medications are currently in testing but not yet FDA-approved, \nso only available for compassionate use from the manufacturer.  People in prison and jail \nwill likely have even less access to these novel health strategies as they become available. \n21. Most people (80%) who become infected with COVID-19 will develop a mild upper \nrespiratory infection but emerging data from China suggests serious illness occurs in up \nto 16% of cases, including death.5  Serious illness and death is most common among \npeople with underlying chronic health conditions, like heart disease, lung disease, liver \ndisease, and diabetes, and older age.6  Death in COVID-19 infection is usually due to \npneumonia and sepsis.  The emergence of COVID-19 during influenza season means that \npeople are also at risk from serious illness and death due to influenza, especially when \nthey have not received the influenza vaccine or the pneumonia vaccine. \n22. The care of people who are infected with COVID-19 depends on how seriously they are \nill.7  People with mild symptoms may not require hospitalization but may continue to be \nclosely monitored at home.  People with moderate symptoms may require hospitalization \nfor supportive care, including intravenous fluids and supplemental oxygen.  People with \nsevere symptoms may require ventilation and intravenous antibiotics. Public health \nofficials anticipate that hospital settings will likely be overwhelmed and beyond capacity \nto provide this type of intensive care as COVID-19 becomes more widespread in \ncommunities. \n23. COVID-19 prevention strategies include containment and mitigation.  Containment \nrequires intensive hand washing practices, decontamination and aggressive cleaning of \nsurfaces, and identifying and isolating people who are ill or who have had contact with \npeople who are ill, including the use of personal protective equipment.  Jails and prisons \nare totally under-resourced to meet the demand for any of these strategies.  As infectious \ndiseases spread in the community, public health demands mitigation strategies, which \ninvolves social distancing and closing other communal spaces (schools, workplaces, etc.) \nto protect those most vulnerable to disease.  Jails and prisons are unable to adequately \nprovide social distancing or meet mitigation recommendations as described above. \n24. The time to act is now. Data from other settings demonstrate what happens when jails \nand prisons are unprepared for COVID-19. To date, few  state or federal prison systems \nhave adequate (or any) pandemic preparedness plans in place. Systems are just \nbeginning to screen and isolate people on entry and perhaps place visitor restrictions, \nbut this is wholly inadequate when staff and vendors can still come to work sick and \n                                                 \n5 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Situation Summary, Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (March 14, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary.html. \n6 Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, \nChina: a retrospective cohort study.

Systems are challenged to respond to COVID-19 guidelines that are modified on a near-\ndaily basis. It may be impossible to adequately respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, \nwhile also respecting the rights and dignity of people who are incarcerated.    \nIV.  Possible Risks of COVID-19 in Federal Bureau of Prisons Facilities in Danbury, \nConnecticut \n \n26. From approximately 2017-2018, I volunteered to provide AIDS Awareness Programming \nfor all women housed at the Camp and the Satellite Low (FSL) facilities at FCI Danbury.  \nIn doing so, I interacted with the resident inmates in common meetings areas on a \nmonthly basis in groups as small as 10 and as large as 100.  I have additionally toured all \nareas of the FSL facility in January 2018 with leadership from the National Association \nof Women Judges.  I last entered the facilities in approximately Summer 2018. \n27. The FSL facility is comprised of a single large dormitory style room, in which all of the \nwomen sleep on bunks.  There is also a library, a laundry room, a group meeting area, \nand a space for exercise.  In the adjoining building, there are multiple classrooms and \nmeeting spaces.  There was an infirmary staffed intermittently by a physician or nurse \npractitioner, who was available for sick call.  For other medical needs, women were \nbrought into the men’s facility to see the healthcare provider by appointment.  All serious \nmedical needs and specialty visits were referred to the nearby Danbury Hospital.  Per the \nBOP webpage, as of April 23, 2020, there were 165 women housed at FSL.  The layout \nof the space would make it impossible for these women to practice social distancing. \n28. When I last visited the Camp, it was comprised of a single floor of cells, each of which \nheld 2-3 women.  I understand that the building has since been reconfigured and the \nwomen are now housed in large dormitory style rooms. Per the BOP webpage, as of April \n23, 2020, there were 153 women housed at the Camp.  Dormitory style housing makes it \nimpossible for prisoners to practice social distancing. \n29.  Per BOP reports, as of April 23, 2020, there are 15 inmates with confirmed COVID-19 \ninfection, 32 staff members, and 1 death.  These numbers do not include the number of \ninmates and staff who previously tested positive and have since recovered.  For example, \non April 15, a news article said that BOP reported 44 inmates and 39 staff infected at FCI \nDanbury. It is unclear in which compound the COVID+ inmates resided on the Danbury \nBOP campus.  Given that all spaces in both women’s facilities on the Danbury BOP \ncampus are communal, there is high likelihood that if a single case entered the facility, \nmany more will follow in what some have called a “tinderbox scenario.” The large \nnumber of cases in FCI Danbury to date reflects widespread disease in the surrounding \ncommunity and is evidence that FCI Danbury is unable to mitigate or contain the spread \nof disease.  \n \n30. During my visit to FSL in January 2018, I had the opportunity to meet with many of the \nwomen to discuss their experiences of confinement without any correctional officers \npresent.  The women I met with had significant medical issues, including serious \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 8 of 9\n \ncardiovascular, neurologic, and psychiatric conditions.  They described significant delays \nin receiving medical attention for issues both large and small.  Any delays in access to \ncare that already exist in normal circumstances will only become worse during an \noutbreak, making it especially difficult for the facilities to contain any infections and to \ntreat those who are infected. \n31. Failure to provide individuals with continuation of the treatment they were receiving in \nthe community, or even just interruption of treatment, for chronic underlying health \nconditions will result in increased risk of morbidity and mortality related to these chronic \nconditions.  \n32. Failure to provide individuals adequate medical care for their underlying chronic health \nconditions results in increased risk of COVID-19 infection and increased risk of \ninfection-related morbidity and mortality if they do become infected. \n33. People with underlying chronic mental health conditions need adequate access to \ntreatment for these conditions throughout their period of detention.  Failure to provide \nadequate mental health care, as may happen when health systems in jails and prisons are \ntaxed by COVID-19 outbreaks, may result in poor health outcomes.  Moreover, mental \nhealth conditions may be exacerbated by the stress of incarceration during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including isolation and lack of visitation.  \n34. Failure to keep accurate and sufficient medical records will make it more difficult for \nfacilities to identify vulnerable individuals in order to both monitor their health and \nprotect them from infection.  Inadequate screening and testing procedures in facilities \nincrease the widespread COVID-19 transmission.  \n35. Many women at FSL spoke only Spanish and reported significant challenges \nparticipating in groups and classes, which were at the time only offered in English.  \nLanguage barriers will similarly prevent the effective identification of individuals who \nare particularly vulnerable or may have symptoms of COVID-19. Similarly, the failure to \nprovide necessary aids to individuals who have auditory or visual disabilities could also \nlimit the ability to identify and monitor symptoms of COVID-19.   \n36. Facilities with a track record of neglecting individuals with acute pain and serious health \nneeds under ordinary circumstances are more likely to be ill-equipped to identify, \nmonitor, and treat a COVID-19 epidemic. \n37. Similarly, facilities with a track record of failing to adequately manage single individuals \nin need of emergency care are more likely to be seriously ill-equipped and under-\nprepared when a number of people will need urgent care simultaneously, as would occur \nduring a COVID-19 epidemic.  \n38. For individuals in facilities that have experienced these problems in the past, the \nexperience of an epidemic and the lack of care while effectively trapped can itself be \ntraumatizing, compounding the trauma of incarceration.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569   Document 1-1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 9 of 9\n \nV.  Conclusion and Recommendations \n \n39. Reducing the size of the population in jails and prisons is crucial to reducing the level of \nrisk both for those within those facilities and for the community at large. As such, from a \npublic health perspective, it is my recommendation that individuals who can safely and \nappropriately remain in the community not be placed in BOP facilities at this time. I also \nrecommend that individuals who are already in these facilities should be evaluated for \nrelease. \n40. This is more important still for individuals with preexisting conditions (e.g., heart disease \nand hypertension, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, suppressed immune system, \nmorbid obesity, diabetes) or who are over the age of 65.  \n41. Health in jails and prisons is community health. Protecting the health of individuals who \nare detained in and work in these facilities is vital to protecting the health of the wider \ncommunity.  \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \n \n \nApril 2__4, 2020           _______________________ \nWilton, Connecticut           Dr. Jaimie Meyer \n8 \n ",

Although, as set forth in detail in the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, \nthere is ample evidence to indicate that FCI Danbury has been avoiding testing prisoners who \npresent with symptoms of COVID-19 infection, Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) statistics reported \nearlier this month reflect that the prison had among the highest incidence of COVID-19 among \nboth prisoners and staff anywhere in the BOP system. Those reported statistics also show that, far \nfrom containing the initial outbreak, Respondents’ management of the prison has allowed a second \nwave of infections to sweep through the facility. One prisoner has already died and several others \nhave recently been transported to the hospital on an emergency basis.   \nQuite simply, notwithstanding that Attorney General William Barr directed the BOP over \na month ago to give priority to FCI Danbury in identifying medically vulnerable prisoners who \ncould serve their sentences in home confinement as a means to address the infection in the facility, \nRespondents have failed to take sufficient and appropriate measures to halt the further spread of \nthis deadly virus, putting the lives and health of prisoners and staff at FCI Danbury, and countless \nothers in the community, at risk. And, the inadequate isolation practices that Respondents have \nimplemented have resulted in grossly unhygienic conditions with women made to sleep on \nblankets on the floor in rooms never designed to serve for housing with patently insufficient \nbathroom and shower facilities.   \nThe Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution forbids this state of affairs. \nNor  does  it  serve  any  necessary  penal  purpose.  Approximately  half  of  the  women \nimprisoned at FCI Danbury are in the women’s camp, which is a minimum security facility—the \nvery lowest security level in the federal prison system. Consistent with Attorney General Barr’s \nmonth-old directive, the women in the camp can be expeditiously released (“enlarged”) to home \nconfinement which will, in turn, permit substantial social distancing improvements throughout the \nprison.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 10 of 51\nPetitioners seek to represent the class1 of all individuals who are currently or will in the \nfuture be imprisoned at FCI Danbury during the pendency of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as \na subclass of prisoners who are aged 50 or over and/or who have serious underlying medical \nconditions that put them at particular risk of serious harm or death from COVID-19.  Because of \nthe grave risk to health and life at stake, Petitioners now bring this Emergency Motion for \nTemporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction seeking Orders requiring Respondents \nimmediately to: (1) enlarge to home confinement all women currently housed in the camp; (2) \nenlarge to home confinement all members of the medically vulnerable Subclass; and (3) implement \nappropriate measures to maximize social distancing and improve hygiene for the prisoners who \nremain at FCI Danbury for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.   \nAs the supporting declarations attached to the Petition and to this Memorandum make \nclear, this is a matter of life and death. Each hour that passes risks the health and lives of Petitioners \nand the other prisoners and staff at FCI Danbury, as well as members of the community with whom \nFCI Danbury staff necessarily interact. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nI.  There is a Dangerous and Uncontrolled COVID-19 Outbreak at FCI Danbury  \nFCI Danbury consists of three facilities. The largest is a low-security main complex \ncurrently housing 719 men (“men’s facility”). A second unit is an adjacent low-security satellite \nprison housing approximately 164 women (“FSL”). The third is a minimum-security satellite \nfacility (called the “camp”) which currently houses approximately 142 women.2 All of the women \nlive in crowded, dormitory-style housing, as do the vast majority of the men. With the current \npopulation levels in the three facilities, and the particular architecture of these structures, it is \n                                                 \n1 Although Petitioners have not yet moved for class certification, this Court need not rule on \nPlaintiffs’ class certification motion or formally certify a class in order to issue the requested emergency \nrelief. See, e.g., Newberg on Class Actions § 24:83 (4th ed. 2002) (“The absence of formal certification is \nno barrier to classwide preliminary injunctive relief.”); Moore’s Federal Practice § 23.50, at 23-396, 23-\n397 (2d ed.1990) (“Prior to the Court’s determination whether plaintiffs can maintain a class action, the \nCourt should treat the action as a class suit.”).  \n2 Federal Bureau of Prisons, FCI Danbury, https://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/dan/  \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 11 of 51\nimpossible to keep people safe from COVID-19, which is raging through the FCI complex. Yet \nthe unique structure of FCI Danbury also presents an obvious first step for managing the crisis. \nThe minimum security women’s camp houses women who present the very lowest risk of any \nprisoners in the federal system. These women should be moved immediately to home confinement \nfor the remainder of their sentences. Immediately clearing out the camp, and moving medically \nvulnerable people from the FSL and men’s facility to home confinement, would create more space \nto address the safety of the prisoners who remain.  \nIn late March, a woman in the FSL and a man in the men’s facility tested positive for \nCOVID-19. The woman had been exhibiting symptoms for weeks but was not tested until she was \nbrought to the hospital. Ex. G, Declaration of Kimberly Hoisington (“Hoisington Dec.”) ¶¶ 5, 9.3 \nThe man had symptoms for several days before he was able to access medical care at the prison \nand be tested. Ex. M, Declaration of Richard Johnson (“Johnson Dec.”) ¶¶ 5, 6. Soon after, two \nmore men in his unit tested positive, and several men in another unit had positive tests. Ex. H, \nDeclaration of Rafael Almonte (“Almonte Dec.”) ¶ 15; Ex. D, Declaration of Kenneth Cassidy \n(“Cassidy Dec.”) ¶ 15. Two other women in the FSL tested positive at the hospital. Ex. F, \nDeclaration of Marius Mason (“Mason Dec.”) ¶ 17.  \nBy April 15, BOP had reported 44 prisoners and 39 staff members were positive for \nCOVID-19 at FCI Danbury.4 Several days later, a prisoner from the facility died of the virus.5  \nFCI Danbury’s utter failure to implement effective COVID-19 testing has made it difficult to \ndetermine the total number of infected prisoners at the facility.6 Indeed, BOP has provided no \n                                                 \n3 Exhibits referenced in this memorandum include exhibits attached to the Petition for Writ of \nHabeas Corpus (ECF No. 1) and supplemental exhibits attached hereto and are designated sequentially.  \nExhibits A through N are attached to the original petition. Exhibits O and following are attached to this \nmemorandum \n4 See Laura Cassels, COVID-19 deaths in federal prisons rise to 15; about 700 staff and inmates \nsick, Phoenix, April 15, 2020, https://www.floridaphoenix.com/2020/04/15/covid-19-deaths-in-federal-\nprisons-rise-to-15-about-700-staff-and-inmates-sick/     \n5 Federal Bureau of Prisons, Inmate Death at FCI Danbury, \nhttps://www.bop.gov/resources/news/pdfs/20200418_press_release_dan.pdf  \n6 The BOP provides COVID-19 data each day on its website, Federal Bureau of Prisons, \nhttps://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/ The BOP’s reported data on each facility does not include prisoners it \ndeems “recovered,” and by April 27 the agency was reporting only 5 positive cases among prisoners at \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 12 of 51\ninformation about how many tests have been conducted at FCI Danbury in total. Numerous \nprisoners exhibiting serious symptoms at the facility have not been tested. Regardless, it is clear \nthat BOP’s data vastly understates the extent of the outbreak. Recent data from the BOP show that \nout of 2,700 tests conducted systemwide, nearly 2,000 have come back positive.7 This rate of more \nthan 70% positive tests suggests that widespread testing would confirm many additional cases of \nCOVID-19 at FCI Danbury. COVID-19 is spreading aggressively through FCI Danbury and \nexposing the men and women incarcerated there to grave risk.  \n  A.  Federal Satellite Low facility (“FSL”)  \nThere is a severe outbreak of COVID-19 in the women’s FSL, and the women in the facility \nare at grave risk. The outbreak, which started five weeks ago and has been utterly mishandled by \nBOP, shows no signs of abating. Since March 27, at least 4 women have been brought to the \nhospital and tested positive for the virus. Eleven more tested positive on April 25.  Ex. O, \nDeclaration of Miranda McLaurin (“McLaurin Dec.”) ¶ 8; Ex. P, Second Declaration of Kimberly \nHoisington (“Hoisington Dec. 2”) ¶ 7. This is likely a significant undercount as only a fraction of \nwomen in the facility have been tested.  \nAs of April 30, 2020, there were 164 women in the FSL. Housing in the FSL is a single \ndormitory-style room that accommodates approximately 160-170 beds. Ex. E, Declaration of \nChristina Korbe (“Korbe Dec.”) ¶ 8. The room is divided into cubicles, each containing two bunk \nbeds, separated by approximately four feet. Ex. F, Declaration of Marius Mason (“Mason Dec.”) \n¶ 7; Hoisington Dec. ¶ 4. Beds in each cubicle are immediately adjacent to the cubicle wall, which \ndoes not reach to the ceiling so that women on the top bunk sleep with the head of the bed next to \nthe woman on the top bunk in the adjacent cubicle. Mason Dec. ¶ 7; Korbe Dec. ¶ 10.  \nAll of the women in the FSL share the same three bathrooms, each of which includes \nbetween 4-8 toilets, sinks, and showers. Mason Dec. ¶ 10; Korbe Dec. ¶ 8. Water in the unit will \n                                                 \nFCI Danbury. As of April 29, the positive number for prisoners was up to 18, likely as a result new \ntesting that followed a positive test at the hospital on April 25 of a woman from the FSL. \n7 See Michael Balsamo, Over 70% of tested inmates in federal prisons have COVID-19, \nAssociated Press (Apr. 30, 2020), https://apnews.com/fb43e3ebc447355a4f71e3563dbdca4f.    \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 13 of 51\nsometimes be shut off for a few hours or more than a day at a time, including for about 17 hours \nin early April. Mason Dec. ¶ 11. The FSL also includes a common area where the women have \naccess to 6-12 shared phones (not all of which are working) and 6 shared computers (only 4 of \nwhich are working), which are located in close proximity to one another. Korbe Dec. ¶ 11; Mason \nDec. ¶ 8. The phones and computers are not cleaned between each use. Mason Dec. ¶ 8. \nThe prisoners at FSL have not had access to hand sanitizer during the outbreak. Id. ¶ 12; \nEx. I, Declaration of Tamika Somerville (“Somerville Dec.”) ¶ 9. Hand sanitizer has been out of \nstock at the commissary since the beginning of the pandemic. Ex. Q, Declaration of Shannon Battle \n(“Battle Dec.”) ¶ 6. They have one fabric washable mask each. Somerville Dec. ¶ 10. The soap \ndispensers in the bathrooms are empty, and there are not paper towels for the women to dry their \nhands. McLaurin Dec. ¶ 15.  \nOn March 27, 2020 a woman at the FSL was brought to the hospital and tested positive for \nCOVID-19. Hoisington Dec. ¶ 9.  She had been feeling sick for weeks and had reported her \nsymptoms to medical staff. Id. ¶¶ 5, 6. When she returned to the facility a few days later, she was \nplaced in a small, cold isolation room with a toilet that was flushed by staff only a few times a day.  \nId. ¶¶ 10, 11. After 24 hours, she was placed for five days in the FSL’s visiting room with four \nother women. Id. ¶ 12. While there, one of the other woman slipped in the shower and was knocked \nunconscious. Id. ¶ 13. No staff responded to their calls for help, and the women had to bang on the \nwindow to get the attention of someone outside in the parking lot.  Id.  \nSoon after this initial positive test, at least two more women from the FSL were brought to \nthe hospital and tested positive. Mason Dec. ¶ 17. They were returned to the dormitory area within \na week of their positive tests. Hoisington Dec. ¶ 9, 10, 12; Mason Dec. ¶ 18; Somerville Dec. ¶ 11.  \nMeanwhile, women who were sick were not being treated or tested for COVID-19; nor \nwere they being separated from the other women in the unit. Korbe Dec. ¶ 15; Mason Dec. ¶19, \n22. One woman who was sick in bed for weeks with a horrible cough, body aches fever, lack of \nappetite, and vomiting was told by staff that nothing was wrong with her. McLaurin Dec. ¶ 6. \nAnother woman experienced in early April a severe headache, body aches, fever, shortness of \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 14 of 51\nbreath, and a terrible cough, as well as a loss of appetite and sense of smell. Korbe Dec. ¶ 4. She \nwas given no treatment and was not tested for COVID-19. Id. ¶¶ 5, 7. Before April 25, the only \nwomen tested for COVID-19 were the ones who ended up at the hospital. Mason Dec. ¶ 19.  \nStaff have been taking the women’s temperatures, which are sometimes recorded as \nartificially low, Mason Dec. ¶ 20, or exactly the same for several women in a row, Korbe Dec. ¶ \n14. Sometimes staff tell women with a high temperature to drink cold water before retaking their \ntemperature. Mason Dec. ¶ 21. One women had a temperature of 102 degrees according to hospital \nstaff. Hoisington Dec. ¶ 8. Her temperature, when taken at the facility about an hour earlier \nregistered 97 degrees. Id. \nMedical staff are available at the FSL only on certain days. McLaurin Dec. ¶ 4. A doctor \nand a physician’s assistant rotate between FSL and the other FCI Danbury buildings and are there \nduring limited hours on weekdays. Id. at ¶¶ 4, 5. To request medical care, a requester must go to \n“pill call,” where a pharmacy tech passes out medicine, and fill out a sick call slip. McLaurin Dec. \n¶¶ 3, 4. The requester must then wait until she is called to be seen, which can take weeks. Id. ¶ 3.  \nIn addition to the prisoners who have been sick with COVID-19, some FSL staff have had \nthe virus. Mason Dec. ¶ 15. More than one correctional officer has returned to work within a week \nof being out sick with COVID-19. Id. Some officers have stated while at the facility that they still \nfeel ill and did not want to return to work, but were told to return. Id.  \nLate in the night on April 24, one of the women in the dormitory was violently ill. She was \nstruggling to breath and throwing up, dry heaving and gagging for hours before she was taken to \nthe hospital by ambulance. Battle Dec. ¶ 11; Hoisington Dec. ¶ 16; Ex. R, Declaration of Kimberly \nKitts (“Kitts Dec.”).  After the woman was finally taken to the hospital, one of the other women in \nthe unit got a disciplinary report for calling her lawyer about what happened. Hoisington Dec. 2 ¶ \n3. The officer who wrote the report told the rest of the women that he would be listening to their \ncalls and that anyone telling anyone on the outside about the incident would also get a disciplinary \nreport. Id. ¶ 3; Korbe Dec. ¶ 16. \nThe next day, 43 women from the facility were tested for COVID-19. Hoisington Dec. at \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 15 of 51\n¶ 17; Kitts Dec. ¶ 6; McLaurin Dec. ¶ 8. Eleven of them tested positive. Hoisington Dec. 2 ¶ 7; \nMcLaurin Dec. ¶ 8. Not everyone who had contact with the sick woman or the women who tested \npositive was tested or isolated. Kitts Dec. ¶ 6; McLaurin Dec. ¶ 13. The women who tested positive \nwere placed in the facility’s visiting room. McLaurin Dec. ¶ 9. Because of a lack of beds, some \nwomen who have tested positive for COVID-19 sleep on the floor. Kitts Dec. ¶ 11. The women \nwho tested negative were placed in the dining room. Hoisington Dec. 2 ¶ 7; McLaurin Dec. ¶ 9.  \nThis  method  of  separating  the  prisoners  has  not  effectively  isolated  the  different \npopulations. Before they were quarantined, the 43 women were in the dormitory gathering personal \nbelongings, using the phone and computer, using the bathroom, and showering. Kitts Dec. ¶ 6; \nSecond Declaration of Christina Korbe (“Korbe Dec. 2”) ¶ 4. The spaces were not cleaned at that \ntime. Kitts Dec. ¶ 6. Since they were first placed in quarantine, some women have come into the \ndormitory to use the phones and computers for email. Kitts Dec. ¶ 16. Laundry has been taken by \nstaff and by prisoners from the rooms where people have been quarantining to the dormitory to be \nwashed. Battle Dec. ¶ 21; Kitts Dec. ¶ 16. When women from the dormitory go to the pill line they \nhave come into contact with women in the visiting room who tested positive for COVID-19. Battle \nDec. ¶ 10. Staff, including officers, medical, and administrative personnel move among the various \nquarantine rooms and the dormitory. Kitts Dec. ¶ 17; Korbe Dec. ¶ 7; McLaurin Dec. ¶ 14.  \nThe dining hall where some of the women are quarantined is connected to the kitchen, with \ntables in the front of the room, a counter for meals to be served dividing the room, and a kitchen \nin the back. Hoisington Dec. 2 ¶ 8; McLaurin Dec. ¶ 10. When the women were first placed in the \ndining room many people slept on the concrete floor because there were not enough cots. Kitts \nDec. ¶ 12. The dining room has one bathroom with one toilet and sink. Hoisington Dec. 2 ¶ 9; \nMcLaurin Dec. ¶ 10.  A trailer with showers and toilets is parked outside the dining hall for the \nwomen to use. Battle Dec. ¶ 18. Hoisington Dec. 2 ¶ 9. Meals are still being prepared in the kitchen \nwhile the women who tested negative are quarantined in the dining room. Korbe Dec. 2 ¶ 8. \nPrisoners who are currently working in the kitchen had been working side-by-side with a woman \nwho tested positive for COVID-19 and is now in isolation. Id. ¶ 8.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 16 of 51\nIn addition to the women in the FSL dormitory, visiting room, and dining room, some \nwomen were placed for several days in the classrooms, and one in the library. Hoisington Dec. 2 \n¶ 11, 12; McLaurin Dec. ¶ 12. The library does not have heat. Hoisington Dec. 2 ¶ 11; Kitts Dec. \n¶ 15. Neither the classrooms nor the library have bathrooms. Kitts Dec. ¶ 15. The woman who was \nplaced in the library has had multiple surgeries for cancer, currently has two untreated cancerous \ngrowths, and has a chest tube. Kitts Dec. ¶ 15. She had to be brought by an officer to use the \nbathrooms that were being used also by the other women in quarantine. Kitts Dec. ¶ 15.  \nOn April 28, the women at FSL had their temperature taken and were asked if they had any \nsymptoms like a cough, sore throat, body aches, fatigue or diarrhea. Hoisington Dec. 2 ¶ 13; Kitts \nDec. ¶ 19; Korbe Dec. 2 ¶ 11. No one else was tested for COVID-19 or removed from the unit at \nthat time. Hoisington Dec. 2 ¶ 13; Kitts Dec. ¶ 20; Korbe Dec. 2 ¶ 11. On April 29, the women in \nquarantine in the classrooms and the library were taken to the special housing unit (SHU) at the \nmen’s facility to be housed there. Korbe Decl 2. ¶ 12.  \nB.  Women’s Minimum Security Camp  \nThe women’s camp at FCI Danbury is a minimum security facility—the very lowest \nsecurity level in the federal prison system. As of April 30, 2020, there were 142 women at the \ncamp.8 The women at the camp occupy a single building divided into four dormitories, each \ncontaining 25 cubicles with bunk beds sleeping two each, and nine rooms that can each hold 4 to \n5 women. Martinez-Brooks Dec. ¶ 7; Ex. H, Declaration of Theresa Foreman (“Foreman Dec.”) ¶ \n7. The cubicles in the dormitories have no doors and their dividing walls do not extend to the \nceilings; the bunk beds are less than 6 feet away from each other. Martinez-Brooks Dec. ¶ 7; \nForeman Dec. ¶ 7. Each dorm has a common bathroom area containing sinks, 3-5 toilets, and 4-6 \nshowers. Martinez-Brooks Dec. ¶ 6. All the women in housed at the camp share 4 phones, 7 \ncomputers for email, and 3 working video-visiting machines, which are clustered together in a \nsingle common area. The common area also contains hot water taps, sinks for washing dishes, and \n                                                 \n8 See Bureau of Prisons, Population Statistics, \nhttps://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/population_statistics.jsp  (last updated Apr. 30, 2020). \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 17 of 51\na recreation area with tables. Foreman Dec. ¶ 15. \nQuarantine efforts in the camp have been disorganized and ineffective. Initially, some \nwomen were told that they are on a list for home confinement and would be quarantined before \nreleased. Martinez-Brooks Dec. ¶ 13. On April 6, 23 women were put in Dorm C for quarantine. \nSeven more were added the next day to Dorm C. On April 10, staff moved some women from \nDorm C into Dorm D and then added an additional 28 women to both Dorm C and Dorm D—thus \nrendering the initial days of the quarantine for some women ineffective. Before April 15, there \nwere around 43 women housed in the nine rooms. On April 15, they took all the women who were \nhoused in the rooms and added them to Dorms A, B, and C—thus restarting the clock again for \nthe women held previously in quarantine. Id. ¶¶ 5, 13.  \nApril 15 was the start of a camp-wide lockdown. Martinez-Brooks Dec. ¶ 5. Under the \nlockdown, the women are confined to their dorm rooms for approximately 22 hours a day. Id. ¶  \n11. As of April 26, A and B dorms each housed 48 women; C dorm housed 47 women and D Dorm \nhouses 7. Id. ¶ 6. Women are being let out one dorm at a time for 45 minutes in the morning and \nan hour in the afternoon. Id. ¶ 11. During this time, they congregate in the camp’s common area \ntrying to access the phones, computers, and video machines during their limited window of time. \nId. ¶ 9, 11. Recently, women who are out of their dorm during their designated recreation time \nhave been going to visit friends in other dorms. Id. ¶ 15. In addition, some prisoners at the camp \nare continuing to assist in food preparation, cooking, and cleaning the kitchen. Id. ¶ 18. Women \nalso move throughout the facility multiple times a week for laundry. Foreman Dec. ¶ 18. \nMeanwhile, staff posted at the camp circulate through the dorms throughout the day for \ncount, food delivery, and commissary. Id. ¶ 7; Martinez-Brooks Dec. ¶ 19. Staff at the camp have \nalso been posted at other facilities at FCI Danbury, and medical staff see prisoners at all three \nfacilities. Martinez-Brooks Dec. ¶ 19; Foreman Dec. ¶ 7. Three correctional officers who have \nbeen at the camp have said that they had COVID-19, including one who works in food service. \nMartinez-Brooks Dec. ¶ 20. Two staff members who worked at the camp have been out for several \nweeks, and their offices were thoroughly cleaned. Foreman Dec. ¶ 13. Otherwise, cleaning at the \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 18 of 51\ncamp has been sporadic, as some women have quit their ordinary cleaning jobs and women are \nresponsible for cleaning their own sleeping areas. Id. ¶ 14. \nThere is no actual medical clinic in the camp and no medical staff permanently assigned to \nthe camp or available 24 hours a day. Ex. C, Declaration of Dianthe Martinez-Brooks (Martinez-\nBrooks Dec.) ¶ 21. During this lockdown, a sick call request is made to physician’s assistants when \nthey come to the unit in the morning to dispense medications and the requester must wait until she \nis called in—often days later or not at all. Emergencies require a call from a correctional officer \nfor a medical professional to come to the camp. Id. ¶ 21. Temperature checks have been sporadic. \nFor example, temperatures were not taken of the women in the camp from April 26 to April 29. \nEx. T, Second Declaration of Dianthe Martinez-Brooks (“Martinez-Brooks Dec. 2”) ¶ 2.  \nThere  has  been  mass  confusion  at  the  camp  about  who  will  be  moving  to  home \nconfinement. A pregnant woman was told she would be leaving on April 28 but was then told she \nwould not leave until May 11, 2020. She has been in quarantine in D dorm since April 6, 2020. Id. \n¶ 3. Petitioner Martinez-Brooks was given paperwork to sign on April 19 relating to home \nconfinement and/or a halfway house. She was then informed she was not eligible because new \ncriteria were being used. Martinez-Brooks Dec. ¶ 26. Multiple women who were initially told they \nwere going home and even given dates for their release were later told they were not be leaving \nafter all. Martinez-Brooks Dec. 2 ¶ 4.  \nC.  Men’s Prison  \nThe men’s prison at FCI Danbury is a low-security facility containing 13 units, comprised \nof 10 units designed for dormitory-style housing and three units of individual cells. There is also \na Special Housing Unit for solitary confinement. The dormitory units (designated C through L \nUnits) house around 80 men and consist of rows of bunk beds lined in two rows three to four feet \napart across a middle aisle, with no barriers between the beds. Cassidy Dec. ¶ 32; Ex. K, \nDeclaration of Antrum Coston (“Coston Dec.”) ¶ 3. The average dorm also contains a bathroom \nwith 5 stalls and a urinal, 5-6 sinks, and a shower area with 3-4 showers. Cassidy Dec. ¶¶ 2, 33; \nCoston Dec. ¶ 4; Ex. L, Declaration of Shannon Benson (“Benson Dec.”) ¶ 3. The dorms have 2 \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 19 of 51\nsmall television rooms that typically hold 15-20 people at a time, and small phone and computer \nrooms that are almost always in use with men waiting nearby in line. Cassidy Dec. ¶ 35; Coston \nDec. ¶ 4. The three units of individual cells (A, B and M Units) consist of two floors of cells, \ncontaining a bunk bed for two men with a toilet/sink. Ex. H, Declaration of Rafael Almonte \n(“Almonte Dec.”) ¶ 6; Coston Dec. ¶ 5. The cellblock units also contain small rooms for TV, \nphones, and computers—where men typically congregate.  Coston Dec. ¶ 4. The cellblock units \nhold around 75 men. Almonte Dec. ¶ 7.  \nOn or around March 27 2020, a man in the M Unit tested positive for COVID-19. Johnson \nDec. ¶ 6. Soon after, two other men were removed from M Unit after they tested positive—one \nwas a tutor and had been in contact with men in units throughout the facility. Almonte Dec. ¶ 15. \nAll three men returned to M Unit in less than 14 days. Id. ¶ 17; Johnson Dec. ¶ 9. After the initial \npositive tests, M Unit was placed on lockdown. However, men in the other units continue to mix \nin the chow hall, pill line, and at recreation.  Coston Dec. ¶¶ 10, 12, 16; Almonte Dec. ¶ 13.  Also \nat the end of March, there was a positive test in the D Unit, and several men were removed.  Cassidy \nDec. ¶ 15. Eventually, all the units were placed on lockdown but staff continued to move in and \nout different units throughout the day.    \nMeanwhile, numerous men throughout the different units began experiencing serious \nsymptoms of COVID-19 including fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Johnson Dec. ¶ 9; \nCoston Dec. ¶ 13. Many were not tested and not placed in isolation. Coston Dec. ¶ 13; Ex. N, \nDeclaration of Ronald Harper (“Harper Dec.”) ¶¶ 5, 6. On April 9, a man from one of the units \nwas transported to the hospital and later died of COVID-19.9 \nBefore the outbreak, the medical clinic at Danbury was typically staffed by one physician \nand two physician assistants. Almonte Dec. ¶ 11. Men who wanted to be seen could go up to the \nclinic in the morning and get on a sick call list. Coston Dec. ¶ 14.  Since the lockdown started, it \nhas been near impossible to get a medical appointment. Id. ¶ 14.  A social worker comes into the \n                                                 \n9 See supra note 5.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 20 of 51\nunits to conduct sick call triage, at times with the dental hygienist. Cassidy Dec. ¶ 18. The social \nworker collects sick call requests and speaks to men about their symptoms the unit.  \nStaff take the temperatures of men each day using forehand wand thermometers.  Early on \nduring the outbreak, even men with fevers were being kept in the units. More recently, some men \nwith fevers have been taken up to the medical unit. Harper Dec. ¶ 6; Cassidy Dec. ¶ 13. But \ntemperatures are not always reliably reported: sometimes, staff attribute high temperature readings \nto an equipment or operator error and take a second reading without putting the thermometer close \nto the man’s forehead. Cassidy Dec. ¶ 14. And men who have gone to medical have come back \ndown to the unit, saying they were told to just take Tylenol or cough syrup and see if their fever \ngoes away. Id. ¶ 12; Harper Dec. ¶ 5. Many men who have COVID-19 symptoms other than a \nfever including coughs and difficulty breathing have not been able to see a medical professional \nat all.

FCI Danbury Has Not Implemented Essential Measures to Protect Prisoners and \nMitigate the Spread of COVID-19 \n  In the face of a COVID-19 outbreak, Respondents have utterly failed to take the measures \nnecessary to protect the women and men in its care.  \n \nA.  Correctional facilities are incubators and amplifiers for infectious diseases like \nCOVID-19, and the CDC has issued guidance for managing the virus in \ncorrectional facilities \nThe COVID-19 virus is highly infectious and can be spread “easily and sustainably” from \nperson-to-person.10 The virus spreads through respiratory droplets, close personal contact, and \ncontact with contaminated surfaces and objects, where the virus can survive for up to three days.11  \nCritically, people who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic can transmit the virus, making it \n                                                 \n10 See Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, How COVID-19 Spreads (accessed Apr. 3, \n2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/transmission.html.  \n11  Neeltje van Doremalen et al., Aerosol and Surface Stability of SARS-CoV-2 as Compared with \nSARS-CoV-1, NEW ENG.

Ex. A, Declaration of Jaimie Meyer, M.D. (“Meyer Dec.”) \n¶ 20. There is no vaccine to protect against COVID-19 and there is no known medication to prevent \nor treat infection from COVID-19. Social distancing (remaining physically separated from known \nor potentially infected individuals) and vigilant hygiene (including washing hands with soap and \nwater and disinfecting surfaces) are the only known effective measures for protecting vulnerable \npeople from COVID-19.  \nCOVID-19 poses particular risks to people in prison, because the activities of daily life \nhappen in close proximity, there is limited access to personal hygiene resources and medical care, \nand, often, minimal levels of sanitation.12 Prisoners and staff interact in close proximity under \ncramped  conditions  that  are  designed  to  confine,  rather  than  distance,  people;  as  a  result, \ncorrectional facilities are highly susceptible to rapid transmission of the virus through contact, \nincluding asymptomatic carriers who show no signs of illness, common surfaces, and movement \nof staff between facilities and the community. Spaces within prisons are often poorly ventilated, \nwhich promotes highly efficient spread of diseases through droplets. Id. ¶ 9.  And prisons often \nlack adequate supplies of soap, sanitizers, disinfectants, paper towels, and the personal protective \nequipment necessary to ensure proper hygiene and mitigate spread of the virus. Id. ¶¶ 9, 11, 39. \nRecognizing the dangers that COVID-19 poses for prisons, the Center for Disease Control \nand Prevention (“CDC”) on March 23, 2020, issued “Interim Guidance on Management of \nCoronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities” (“Interim Guidance”), \nwhich describes measures necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in correctional facilities.13 \n                                                 \n12  See Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in Correctional \nand Detention Facilities, CDC (Mar. 23, 2020), available at  \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/guidance-correctional-detention.pdf; Joseph A. \nBick, Infection Control in Jails and Prisons, 45:8 Clinical Infectious Diseases 1047 (Oct. 2007), available \nat https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/45/8/1047/344842 (incarcerated people at increased risk for \ntransmission of blood-borne pathogens, sexually transmitted diseases, certain antibiotic resistant \ninfections, Staph.

FCI Danbury has Failed to Implement the CDC’s Guidance  \nRespondents’ failures to protect the health and safety of the incarcerated people in their \ncare  have  been—and  continue  to  be—profound  and  pervasive  throughout  Danbury’s  three \nfacilities. The failures to follow CDC Guidance include:  \n \n(cid:0)x \nFailures to triage cases, and diagnose, isolate, and care for those with the disease: If \nan incarcerated person exhibits symptoms of COVID-19, the CDC Guidance calls for the \nindividual to be immediately given a face mask, paced in isolation, provided a medical \nevaluation and treatment, and evaluated for possible testing. Contrary to this guidance, FCI \nDanbury avoids evaluating and testing prisoners with classic symptoms of COVID-19 \nincluding fever, cough, difficulty breathing, and loss of taste and smell. In many instances, \nindividuals with these symptoms are denied access to medical evaluation and testing and \ninstead left in crowded housing units. Without adequate medical attention, some prisoners \nhave become gravely ill.  \n \n(cid:0)x \nFailure  to  respond  adequately  to  cases  of  close  contact  or  observe  appropriate \nquarantine/isolation:  CDC  Guidance  directs  prisons  to  implement  14-day \nquarantines/isolation of prisoners or staff who have had contact with people known to have \ntested positive for COVID-19, to monitor such Close Contact Cases for COVID-19 \nsymptoms, and to keep staff members out of the facility unless they are asymptomatic 14 \ndays after their exposure to COVID-19. Contrary to this Guidance, Respondents routinely \nfail to test or isolate prisoners with known close contact with individuals subsequently \ndiagnosed with the virus. Prisoners who test positive for COVID-19 are frequently returned \nto the general population far earlier than appropriate pursuant to CDC Guidance, and staff \npositive for COVID-19 who were still exhibiting symptoms have returned to work. \n \n(cid:0)x \nFailure to remediate adequately spaces with known coronavirus contact and to \ninform prisoners of the extent of infection: In the event a prisoner or staff member tests \npositive for COVID-19, CDC Guidance calls for the facility to close off the areas used by \nthat person. These areas are to be well ventilated for at least 24 hours before they are \ndisinfected  by  people  equipped  with  proper  personal  protective  equipment  (“PPE”).  \n                                                 \n14 Id. \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 23 of 51\nRespondents have failed to implement any of these measures. \n \n(cid:0)x \nFailure to adequately implement social distancing measures: The very configuration of \nFCI Danbury precludes meaningful social distancing. The overwhelming majority of the \nfacility’s prisoners in each of the three facilities are housed dormitory-style and all \nprisoners in these configurations sleep within 3 to 4 feet of between 3 and 5 other prisoners. \nThroughout  the  day,  prisoners  congregate  closely  together  to  access  the  pill  line, \ncommissary, and phones and computers. They share a limited number of toilets, sinks, and \nshowers. Staff move throughout the units within facilities, and among all three facilities. \n \n(cid:0)x \nFailure to implement necessary hygiene measures: CDC Guidance requires heightened \nhygienic, cleaning and disinfecting practices in order to prevent and mitigate COVID-19 \ninfection. FCI Danbury has failed adequately to implement these heightened hygienic and \ncleaning practices. Petitioners do not have access to the cleaning supplies necessary to \nsanitize themselves, their personal items, or their living areas.  \n \n(cid:0)x \nFailure to plan adequately to prevent or mitigate the spread of COVID-19 infection: \nCDC Guidance recommends that correctional facilities should develop contingency plans \nfor reduced workforces due to staff absences. That Guidance also calls for the provision of \nPPE and contingency planning for shortages of PPE. FCI Danbury has failed to adequately \nplan for either inevitable staff shortages or the need for PPE, placing petitioners and the \nputative class members at heightened risk. \n \n(cid:0)x \nFailure to implement the training and interventions necessary to prevent the spread \nof COVID-19: CDC Guidance states that correctional staff and incarcerated people should \nbe trained on donning, doffing and disposing of PPE. CDC Guidance further recommends \nthat correctional facilities post signage informing staff and incarcerated people how to \nreport COVID-19 symptoms and advising staff to stay at home when sick. FCI Danbury \nhas failed adequately to implement either of these training and educational interventions. \n \n(cid:0)x \nRespondents’  failures  to  respond  to  the  COVID-19  epidemic  have  further  put \npetitioners and putative class members at unacceptably heightened risk of injury and \nillness unrelated to COVID-19:  Respondents’ failure to prepare adequately for the \nCOVID-19 epidemic has also put incarcerated people at heightened risk of other injury and \nillness. Just as those with COVID-19 symptoms are unable to access medical care, \nprisoners with other urgent health needs have gone without treatment. The pharmacy at \nFCI  Danbury  has  been  closed,  which  has  led  to  delays  in  access  to  medication  as \nprescriptions are shipped from another facility. Staff have been absent from the units, \nrequiring prisoners themselves to respond to medical emergencies in the units. \n \nC.  Public  health  officials,  Congress  and  the  Department  of  Justice  have \nrecognized that prisons such as FCI Danbury need to de-densify to protect the \nhealth and safety of prisoners and staff \nEven with effective hygiene practices, FCI Danbury remain too dangerous—especially for \nthose most vulnerable to serious illness or death— absent significant de-densifying. There is \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 24 of 51\nsimply no way to keep the women and men housed in three facilities safe at current population \nlevels. It is hard to imagine conditions more conducive to the spread of the virus than the FSL \nfacility—with more than 150 women living all together in bunk beds in a single crowded room, \nsharing a limited number of bathrooms. The crowded housing conditions in the camp and the men’s \nfacility are hardly better.  \nRecognizing the reality of COVID-19 in a prison setting, correctional public health experts, \nCongress, and the U.S. Department of Justice have recommended the release from custody of \npeople most vulnerable to COVID-19 so as to protect them and permit risk mitigation for all people \nstill held or working in facilities. Calling for immediate and extensive “efforts to decarcerate” to \nprotect both prisoners and the general public, the New England Journal of Medicine explained: \n \nThe boundaries between communities and correctional institutions are porous, as \nare the borders between countries in the age of mass human travel. Despite security \nat nearly every nation’s border, Covid-19 has appeared in practically all countries. \nWe can’t expect to find sturdier barriers between correctional institutions and their \nsurrounding communities in any affected country. . . .To promote public health, we \nbelieve  that  efforts  to  decarcerate,  which  are  already  under  way  in  some \njurisdictions, need  to be scaled up; and associated reductions of incarcerated \npopulations should be sustained. The interrelation of correctional-system health and \npublic health is a reality not only in the United States but around the world.15 \nIn New York City, public officials, the jail oversight board, and doctors working at Rikers Island \nhave acknowledged that the City’s jails are unsafe and that releasing people is the medically \nappropriate and humane option. On March 20, 2020, Dr. Robert Cohen, a member of New York \nCity’s Board of Correction, said, “The most important thing we can do right now is discharge all \nof the people who are old and have serious medical issues—those people are likely to die from a \ncoronavirus infection.”16 Ross McDonald, the Chief Medical Officer for the agency that provides \n                                                 \n15  Matthew J.

On March 27, 2020, Congress enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic \nSecurity Act (CARES Act, P.L. 116-136), which authorizes the Director of the BOP to lengthen \nthe maximum amount of time that a prisoner may be placed on home confinement when the \nAttorney General “finds that emergency conditions will materially affect the functioning” of BOP.  \nOn March 26, 2020, Attorney General William Barr directed the BOP to prioritize the use \nof “various statutory authorities to grant home confinement for prisoners seeking transfer in \nconnection  with  the  COVID-19  pandemic”  because  “for  some  eligible  prisoners,  home \nconfinement  might  be  more  effective  in  protecting  their  health.”18  The  Attorney  General \nspecifically recognized that “there are some at-risk prisoners who are non-violent and pose \nminimal likelihood of recidivism and who might be safer serving their sentences in home \nconfinement rather than BOP facilities.”19 He identified as two of the critical, discretionary factors \nfor consideration (1) “[t]he age and vulnerability of the prisoner to COVID-19, in accordance with \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines,” and (2) “the security level of \nthe  facility,”  with  “priority  given”  to  prisoners  incarcerated  “in  low  and  medium  security \nfacilities.”  \n                                                 \n17 Miranda Bryant, Coronavirus spread at Rikers is a 'public health disaster', says jail's top doctor, \nTHE GUARDIAN (Apr. 1, 2020 10:36 am), Available at https://www.theguardian.com/us-\nnews/2020/apr/01/rikers-island-jail-coronavirus-public-health-disaster; see also Statement of New York \nCity Board of Correction, March 17, 2020 (calling on the City to release people from criminal custody, \nprioritizing people over 50, those with underlying health conditions, detained for administrative reasons, \nand those who have been convicted and sentenced to one year or less); New York City Board of \nCorrection Calls for the City to Begin Releasing People from Jail as Part of Public Health Response to \nCOVID-19 (Mar. 17, 2020), https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/in-the-news/julia-salazar/nyc-board-\ncorrection-calls-city-begin-releasing-people-jail \n  18  Memo from Attorney General to Director of Bureau of Prisons, March 26, 2020, \nhttps://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/docs/bop_memo_home_confinement.pdf \n  19  Id. \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 26 of 51\nIn an April 3 memo to the BOP Director, the Attorney General affirmed the BOP’s \n“profound obligation to protect the health and safety of all inmates” following the dramatic \nincreases in confirmed COVID-19 cases at FCI Danbury and two other BOP facilities (FCI \nOakdale in Louisiana, and FCI Elkton in Ohio).20 Barr asked the BOP to give particular priority \nto those three institutions and others similar affected. Significantly he stated: “[T]he CARES Act \nnow authorizes me to expand the cohort of inmates who can be considered for home release upon \nmy finding that emergency conditions are materially affecting the functioning of the Bureau of \nPrisons. I hereby make that finding and direct that, as detailed below, you give priority in \nimplementing these new standards to the most vulnerable inmates at the most affected facilities, \nconsistent with the guidance below.” He further recognized that, despite “extensive precautions to \nprevent COVID-19 from entering [BOP] facilities and infecting our prisoners,” those measures \n“have not been perfectly effective.” Accordingly, he ordered the BOP to take more aggressive \nsteps, immediately, to transfer prisoners to home confinement, even if electronic monitoring will \nnot be available. Echoing the warnings of public health experts, Attorney General Barr stated: \n“Given the speed with which this disease has spread through the general public, it is clear that time \nis of the essence.”  \n \nD.  FCI Danbury’s failure to implement the CDC’s Guidance and de-densify its \nfacilities places incarcerated women and men at grave risk \nNotwithstanding Attorney General Barr’s statements and the recommendations of public \nhealth officials, Respondents have failed to use the BOP’s available statutory authority to reduce \nthe population of FCI Danbury to mitigate the severe risk posed by COVID-19. Instead, the facility \nhas reversed course, refusing to follow through with transfers to home confinement for individuals \npreviously identified for such home confinement based on their medical vulnerability, and failing \nto take other measures appropriate for a public health crisis.21  \n                                                 \n20 Memorandum For Director of Bureau of Prisons re Increasing Use of Home Confinement at \nInstitutions Most Affected by COVID-19, Office of the Attorney General, Washington, D.C. (Apr. 3, \n2020), available at https://www.justice.gov/file/1266661/download. \n21 Memos from the Warden at FCI Danbury reveal the shifting criteria the facility has used for \nhome confinement. See Ex. T (memo of April 16, 2020); Ex. U (memo of April 21, 2020).  \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 27 of 51\nLast week, one district court expressly criticized FCI Danbury’s inexcusable failure to \nimplement proper transfer procedures for medically vulnerable prisoners. In United States v. Park, \nNo. 16-cr-473 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 24, 2020), the court granted—over the government’s objection—\nimmediate compassionate release from FCI Danbury to Ms. Haena Park. As the Warden of FCI \nDanbury explained, within less than two weeks the BOP’s Correctional Programs Division had \ntwice “revised the criteria which must be met in order for an inmate to be referred to home \nconfinement.” Park, Declaration of Warden Diane Easter at ¶¶ 4-5 (Apr. 23, 2020) [D.E. 69-1]. \nConcluding that the “ever-changing guidelines” meant “the Court cannot be assured that Ms. Park \nwill indeed be released on April 30, as is currently being represented,” the court ordered her \nimmediate release because “[w]e are living in novel and dangerous times” where “[e]very day— \nindeed, every minute—may count.”22 \nThe BOP has not disclosed the number of prisoners it typically released per day prior to \nAttorney General Barr’s memos, nor has it disclosed how many new prisoners have entered BOP \ncustody during the same time period. No information is available about how many prisoners FCI \nDanbury has released pursuant to Barr’s memos.23 The BOP does provide weekly updates on the \n                                                 \n22 The BOP’s mismanagement of home confinement placements has occurred nationwide. See \nLetter from Kevin A. Ring, President, Families for Justice Reform to Attorney General Barr and Director \nCarvajal (April 21, 2020) (citing “reports from dozens of people around the country that their loved ones, \nquarantined with the explicit understanding that they would move to home confinement in two weeks, were \ninstead returned to general population and told that the rules had changed and that they were no longer \ngoing home” and “numerous reports about case managers and counselors giving incorrect information and \ncontradictory  answers  to  people  exploring  early  release  options”),  https://famm.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/final-bop-letter-april-21-2020.pdf; Order, United States v.

Apr. 21, 2020) (noting that the BOP had already approved the defendant’s request for home \nconfinement before deeming him likely no longer eligible in light of “new guidance;” directing the \nGovernment to, inter alia, provide an explanation from the BOP as to how new DOJ guidance could affect \nthe prior approval).  \n23 According to the BOP’s website, from March 26 (the date of Attorney General Barr’s first \nmemo) through April 25, the agency placed 1576 prisoners nationwide into home confinement—which \nwould constitute only 0.9 percent of the approximately 171,000 prisoners currently held in BOP custody. \nHowever, the real number of those released to home confinement nationwide may well be less. As the \nWall Street Journal reported on April 23: “The bureau said it has started placing at least 1,440 of the \nroughly 175,000 prisoners it holds into home confinement, but didn’t say how many of those people have \nactually been released.” Sadie Gurman & Rebecca Davis O’Brien, Confusion Hampers Coronavirus-\nDriven Inmate Releases, Wall Street Journal, April 23, 2020;23 see also Joseph Neff & Keri Blakinger, \nFew Federal Prisoners Released Under COVID-19 Emergency Policies: A Federal Judge Called the \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 28 of 51\nnumber of people held at each facility. As of April 30, 2020, the BOP reports that 1,025 people \nare held at FCI Danbury. They are divided among the units as follows: 164 women are incarcerated \nat the satellite prison, 142 women are incarcerated at the camp, and 719 men are incarcerated at \nthe men’s prison.24 At these population levels, FCI Danbury is simply unable to follow the CDC’s \nrecommendations regarding isolation and social distancing.  \nCOVID-19 can lead to dangerous—and sometimes fatal—consequences for those infected \nby it. While the risks for severe or deadly symptoms are elevated for people over the age of 60 and \npeople of any age who suffer from certain underlying medical conditions (including asthma, \nobesity, diabetes, lung disease, heart disease, chronic liver or kidney disease, and compromised \nimmune systems), even individuals outside of these categories are at risk of contracting this \npotentially deadly disease. For example, 22 percent of individuals requiring admission to a hospital \nintensive care unit do not have any underlying health conditions.25  \nEach of the four (named) Petitioners faces a particularly high risk of complications from \nCOVID-19. Petitioner Dianthe Martinez-Brooks is a 50-year-old woman who suffers from asthma, \nhypertension,  arthritis  and  systemic  lupus  erythematosus  (SLE).  She  takes  Atenolol  for \nhypertension and has a Proventil emergency inhaler and Asmanex Twisthaler (mometasone furoate \ninhalation powder, 220 mg) for her asthma. Since her incarceration, she has been proscribed \nsteroids once for the joint and muscle inflammation associated with her lupus.   Martinez-Brooks \nDec. ¶ 2. As a result of her hypertension, Ms. Martinez-Brooks is significantly more vulnerable to \ncomplications should she contract COVID-19. Indeed, the WHO-China Joint Mission Report \nprovided historical mortality rates for those who contracted COVID-19 with specific pre-existing \n                                                 \nBureau of Prisons Release Process “Kafkaesque”, The Marshall Project, Apr. 25, 2020 (only 1,027 more \nprisoners allowed to serve the rest of their sentence in home confinement since Attorney General Barr’s \nApril 3 urgent memo, “about half of 1 percent of the more than 174,000 people in the bureau’s custody”), \nhttps://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/04/25/few-federal-prisoners-released-under-covid-19-\nemergency-policies. \n24  See BOP, “Population Statistics” (last updated Apr. 30, 2020), \nhttps://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/population_statistics.jsp  \n25 Preliminary Estimates of the Prevalence of Selected Underlying Health Conditions Among \nPatients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 — United States, February 12-March 28, 2020, CDC (Apr. 3, \n2020), https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6913e2.htm  \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 29 of 51\nconditions. For those with hypertension, the mortality rate was 8.4%.26 That same report indicates \nthat the mortality rate for chronic respiratory disease such as asthma was 8.0%. Id. As a lupus \npatient, Ms. Martinez-Brooks is also at greater risk from COVID-19 in two respects. As with other \nlupus  patients,  Ms.  Martinez-Brooks  has  been  prescribed  corticosteroids  which  weaken  the \nimmune system and render the patient immunocompromised. Both that compromised immune \nsystem and lupus itself are risk factors for an increased chance of infection and for the development \nof a more severe form of COVID-19.27   \nPetitioner Rejeanne Collier is a 64-year-old woman who suffers from systemic lupus \nerythematosus (SLE), hypertension and Hepatitis C. She has had surgery for intestinal cancer while \nin BOP custody and has been diagnosed with a spot on her lung. See Motion to Reduce Sentence, \nUnited States v. Collier, 6:12-cr-06003-CJS (N.D.N.Y. Apr. 16, 2020) (Doc. 64 at 13). As set forth \nabove, these conditions condemn her to serve a sentence at substantial risk of serious illness or \ndeath. The mortality rate for COVID-19 with pre-existing hypertension is 8.4%; for cancer, the \nmortality rate is 7.6%.28 She is also at significantly greater risk as a result of her lupus.

Mr. Cassidy \nhas significant cardiovascular issues, including ischemic heart disease (i.e., deficient blood supply \nfrom a narrowing of the blood vessels), unstable angina, and hypertension. He has suffered three \nheart attacks, including two in his thirties. He has chronic bronchial asthma and other respiratory \nproblems which have resulted in his having contracted pneumonia at least 21 times in his life. He \nalso has chronic gastrointestinal and gastroesophageal disease including diverticulosis and he is \nmorbidly obese. He suffers significant food allergies and is on a restricted diet as a result of his \ndiverticulosis.  He  is  on  numerous  different  medications/interventions  for  these  conditions. \nPursuant to the above-cited WHO-China Joint Mission Report, each of these conditions puts Mr. \nCassidy at significantly elevated risk of mortality in the event he should contract COVID-19: The \nmortality rate for hypertension is 8.4%; the mortality rate for chronic respiratory disease is 8.0%, \nthe mortality rate for cardiovascular disease is 13.2%.30 Moreover, a recent study found that \nobesity was the single biggest chronic risk factor for hospitalization for COVID-19.31 COVID-19 \ninfection in a patient presenting with all four medical conditions will undoubtedly be deadly.32 As \na result of his medical condition, there is a grave risk that he will not make it out of FCI Danbury \nalive or will become terribly ill. \n                                                 \n29 See id.    \n30 See id. \n31 Christopher M.

Standard of Review \n  In this case, Petitioners seek two forms of immediate relief.  The Subclass, consisting of \nmedically  vulnerable  individuals,  seeks  immediate  release  from  the  chaotic  and  infectious \nenvironment at FCI Danbury to home confinement through an order of enlargement.  Their health \nand possibly their lives depend on how quickly they are released from that environment.   \nThe Class as a whole seeks orders requiring Respondents to enlarge to home confinement \nall women currently housed in the satellite camp as a means to achieve necessary social distancing \namong  the  female  population  of  FCI  Danbury.    The  Class  further  seeks  orders  requiring \nRespondents (a) to establish a medically safe environment at FCI Danbury through implementation \nof necessary and appropriate measures to maximize social distancing and to improve hygiene for \nthe prisoners who remain at FCI Danbury for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and/or (b) \nto transfer such Class members to other BOP facilities that can provide such medically safe \nenvironment.   \nThe standards for granting a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) are the same standards \nthat govern preliminary injunctions. See Local 1814, Int’l Longshoremen’s Ass’n, AFL-CIO v. \nNew York Shipping Ass’n, Inc., 965 F.2d 1224, 1228 (2d Cir. 1992); Maxum Petroleum, Inc. v. \nHiatt, No. 3:16-CV-01615 (VLB), 2016 WL 5496283, at *1 (D. Conn. 2016); Andino v. Fischer, \n555 F. Supp. 2d 418, 419 (S.D.N.Y. 2008).  For a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff “must establish \nthat he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence \nof preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the \npublic interest.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). The Second Circuit \nhas long held that the Winter factors are properly balanced with a showing of “(a) irreparable harm \nand (b) either (1) likelihood of success on the merits or (2) sufficiently serious questions going to \nthe merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly \ntoward the party requesting the preliminary relief.” Citigroup Glob. Markets, Inc. v. VCG Special \nOpportunities Master Fund Ltd., 598 F.3d 30, 35 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Jackson Dairy, Inc. v. \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 33 of 51\nH.P. Hood & Sons, Inc., 596 F.2d 70, 72 (2d Cir. 1979)). Petitioners meet all four Winter factors, \nand therefore more than satisfy the Second Circuit alternative of “sufficiently serious questions \ngoing to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation.” Id. \nOnce a plaintiff demonstrates entitlement to preliminary relief, courts have broad power to \nfashion equitable remedies to address constitutional violations in prisons. Hutto v. Finney, 437 \nU.S. 678, 687 n.9 (1978). And although courts must “be sensitive to the State’s interest[s]” in \nimprisonment, courts “must not shrink from their obligation to enforce the constitutional rights of \nall persons, including prisoners [and] . . . may not allow constitutional violations to continue simply \nbecause a remedy would involve intrusion into the realm of prison administration.” Brown v. Plata, \n563 U.S. 493, 511 (2011). \nAction by this Court is necessary here. There is no vaccine or cure for COVID-19. And the \nconditions at FCI Danbury inherently make social distancing and other imperative protective \nmeasures impossible. As such, the only way to protect against the imminent risk of substantial \nharm and possible death for the subclass of prisoners who are most vulnerable to the virus is to \nimmediately remove them from the prison before they contract the virus. Injunctive relief is \nnecessary  because  the  danger  here,  vulnerable  people  condemned  to  prolonged  illness  and \npotential death, is the quintessential irreparable harm. See, e.g., Jones’El v. Berge, 164 F. Supp. \n2d 1096 (W.D. Wisc. 2001) (“[P]ain, suffering and the risk of death constitute ‘irreparable harm’ \nsufficient to support a preliminary injunction in prison cases.”). There is also an overwhelming \npublic interest in limiting the spread of COVID-19, both to minimize further infections and to \nreduce strain on overwhelmed health systems. And, in light of the global COVID-19 pandemic, \nthe balance of equities weighs heavily in favor of the vulnerable prisoners, who must be transferred \nto home confinement to self-isolate, and against Respondents’ interest in indefinitely confining \nPetitioners, the Class and the Subclass, in life-threatening conditions. This Court should order that \nthe Subclass be immediately released to home confinement.  The Court should further order that \nRespondents release to home confinement all members of the Class currently housed in the satellite \ncamp as a means to achieve necessary social distancing and that Respondents implement all \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 34 of 51\nnecessary and appropriate measures  (a) to establish a medically safe environment at FCI Danbury \nfor the population that remains there and/or (b) to transfer such Class members to other BOP \nfacilities as necessary to create such medically safe environment.   \n \nII.   Petitioners and the Class and Subclass Face Irreparable Harm If They Continue to \nbe Incarcerated.  \nEach of the named Petitioners and the members of the Class and Subclass face an immense \nthreat of irreparable harm that they will contract and may suffer severe illness or death from \nCOVID-19 if they continue to be incarcerated under existing conditions of inadequate social \ndistancing measures and inadequate hygiene.   \nIrreparable harm is the threshold requirement for the granting of a TRO. Faiveley Transp. \nMalmo AB v. Wabtec Corp., 559 F.3d 110, 118 (2d Cir. 2009) (quoting Rodriguez v. DeBuono, \n175 F.3d 227, 234 (2d Cir. 1999)). Furthermore, “the Second Circuit has deemed the threshold \nshowing of ‘irreparable harm’ to be of particular significance under Rule 65, regardless of the \nstrength of the movant’s case on the merits.” AIM Int’l Trading LLC v. Valcucine SpA., 188 F. \nSupp. 2d 384, 387 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). \nThe Supreme Court has determined that substantially increased risk of serious illness and \ndeath always constitutes irreparable injury. See, e.g., Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33(1993) \n(“It would be odd to deny an injunction to inmates who plainly proved an unsafe, life threatening \ncondition in their prison on the ground that nothing yet had happened to them.”). See also \nInnovative Health Sys., Inc. v. City of White Plains, 117 F.3d 37, 43 (2d Cir. 1997) (finding the \nburden of showing irreparable injury satisfied where evidence showed that closing of treatment \nprogram would lead to plaintiffs’ continued abuse of alcohol and drugs, “resulting in death, illness, \nor disability”); see also Harris v. Bd. of Supervisors, Los Angeles Cty., 366 F.3d 754, 766 (9th Cir. \n2004) (finding likelihood of “pain, infection, amputation, medical complications, and death” \nconstituted irreparable harm); Stagliano v. Herkimer Cent. Sch. Dist., 151 F. Supp. 3d 264, 273 \n(N.D.N.Y. 2015) (“[T]he obvious potential for such issues as developing chronic health issues or \nspreading contagious diseases underscores the need for equitable relief . . . .”).  \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 35 of 51\nEven the failure to test for a disease has been sufficient to support a finding of irreparable \nharm. See Boone v. Brown, No. Civ. 05–750(AET), 2005 WL 2006997, at *14 (D.N.J. Aug. 22, \n2005) (allegation of refusal to provide adequate testing for highly contagious infectious disease \nsufficient to demonstrate irreparable harm); Austin v. Pa. Dep’t of Corr., Civ. A. No. 90–7497, \n1992 WL 277511, at *7 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 29, 1992) (granting preliminary injunction for prison to \ndevelop testing and protocol for Tuberculosis); see also Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 477 (2d \nCir. 1996) (state officials have an affirmative obligation to protect prisoners from infectious \ndisease). \n  Harm is irreparable when money damages after the matter is resolved will not be adequate \nredress. See JSG Trading Corp. v. Tray-Wrap, Inc., 917 F.2d 75, 79 (2d Cir. 1990). Here, no \namount of damages could make Petitioners or the members of the Class or Subclass whole if they \nsuffer illness or die a preventable death while in custody. Furthermore, alleged violations of \nconstitutional rights, such as those made here, amount to irreparable injury. See, e.g., Conn. Dep’t \nEnvtl. Prot. v. OSHA, 356 F.3d 226, 231 (2d Cir. 2004); Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 482 (2d \nCir. 1996). \n  A likelihood of irreparable harm is clearly present here. Petitioners and the members of the \nClass and Subclass face severe illness, pain, and potentially death if the conditions of their \nincarceration are not addressed and changed now. COVID-19 has already gained an initial foothold \nat the FCI Danbury, has already spawned secondary outbreaks, and its continued spread is \ninevitable.  Once infected, Petitioners and other prisoners will be at serious risk of grave or life-\nthreatening  complications  due  not  only  to  the  FCI  Danbury’s  patently  inadequate  sanitary \nconditions, health protections, and housing practices, but also (for the medically vulnerable \nSubclass) because of their ages and pre-existing medical conditions.  \n  Indeed, numerous federal courts around the country have found the threat posed by the \nCOVID-19 pandemic to constitute irreparable injury for the purposes of temporary restraining \norders and preliminary injunctions. See, e.g., Castillo v. Barr, No. CV 20-00605, at *5-6 (C.D. \nCal. Mar. 27, 2020) (finding that petitioners should be released from immigration custody because \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 36 of 51\nthey established irreparable harm stemming from risk of exposure to COVID-19); Coronel v. \nDecker, 20-cv-2472, 2020 WL 1487274, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2020) (“Due to their serious \nunderlying medical conditions, all Petitioners face a risk of severe, irreparable harm if they contract \nCOVID-19.”); Basank v. Decker, No. 20 Civ. 2518, 2020 WL 1481503, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, \n2020) (“The risk that Petitioners will face a severe, and quite possibly fatal, [COVID-19] infection \nif they remain in immigration detention constitutes irreparable harm warranting a TRO.”). \n \nIII.   Petitioners, the Class and Subclass Are Substantially Likely to Succeed on the Merits \nof Their Claims. \n  Petitioners, and the Class and Subclass they seek to represent have suffered violations of \ntheir constitutional rights.  Respondents have acted with deliberate indifference to the medical \nneeds of people incarcerated at FCI Danbury, placing all Class and Subclass members in danger \nas a result of Respondents’ inadequate response to the risk to Class and Subclass members from \nCOVID-19.  \n \nA.  The Class and Subclass are Likely to Succeed on their Claim that  \nRespondents Have Violated the Eighth Amendment.  \n  The Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment safeguards the rights of \nprisoners while in state custody. Under the Eighth Amendment, the Government has an affirmative \nduty to provide conditions of reasonable health and safety to those in its custody. DeShaney v. \nWinnebago County Dep’t Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 199-200 (1989) (“[W]hen the State takes a \nperson into its custody and holds him there against his will, the Constitution imposes upon it a \ncorresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety and general well-being.”). This \naffirmative duty includes the obligation to provide adequate care to inmates with acute medical \nneeds. See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976). \n  All incarcerated people have a right to be housed safely. That right is violated if they are \n“incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm,” and their jailers’ “state \nof mind,” at least for convicted detainees, “is one of ‘deliberate indifference’ to inmate health or \nsafety.” Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994).  The law is clear that when prison \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 37 of 51\nauthorities “strip [prisoners] of virtually every means of self-protection and foreclose[] their access \nto outside aid, [they] are not free to let the state of nature take its course.”  Id. at 833.  Instead, \nprison officials have a responsibility under the Eight Amendment to “take reasonable measures to \nguarantee the safety of the inmates.”  Id. at 832.  Prison authorities are liable if they “ignore a \ncondition of confinement that is sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering.” \nHelling, 509 U.S. at 33.  \n  An Eighth Amendment claim based on conditions of confinement has two prongs: an \nobjective  prong  and  subjective  prong.  Under  the  objective  prong,  Eighth  Amendment \njurisprudence specifically holds that incarcerated individuals may not constitutionally be exposed \nto a severe risk of contracting a communicable disease. Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 477 (2d \nCir. 1996) (“[C]orrectional officials have  an affirmative obligation to protect inmates from \ninfectious disease.”); Lareau v. Manson, 651 F.2d 96, 109–11 (2d Cir. 1981); Gates v. Collier, \n501 F.2d 1291, 1300-02 (5th Cir. 1974) (cited with approval in Helling, 509 U.S. at 34).   \nThe Eighth Amendment’s “deliberate indifference” inquiry specifically encompasses the \nrisk of future harm in its analysis. In Helling v. McKinney, the Supreme Court held that a prisoner’s \nexposure to second-hand smoke constituted a viable Eighth Amendment claim, even before \ncontracting any second-hand-smoke related illness. 509 U.S. at 35. “It would be odd to deny an \ninjunction to inmates who plainly proved an unsafe, life threatening condition in their prison on \nthe ground that nothing yet had happened to them,” the Court observed. Id. at 33-34. Similarly, \nthe Helling Court explained that prison officials cannot “ignore a condition of confinement that is \nsure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering the next week or month or year.” \nId. at 33; see also Forbes v. Edgar, 112 F.3d 262, 266 (7th Cir. 1997) (noting that “exposure of \ninmates to a serious, communicable disease . . . can qualify [as a] deprivation . . . [that is] \nsufficiently serious).  Where continuing confinement in an environment that puts a prisoner at risk \nof known exposure to serious disease, the prison must “choose between removing the prisoner \nfrom the unhealthy environment and protecting him from its consequences ... provided, of course, \nthat the protection is efficacious.”  Powers v. Snyder, 484 F.3d 929, 931 (7th Cir. 2007); see also \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 38 of 51\nMcDonald v. Hardy, 821 F.3d 882, 889 (7th Cir. 2016) (explaining that the Eighth Amendment \ndoes not excuse deliberate indifference simply because harms “have not yet reached the point of \ncausing acute or life-threatening injuries”). \n  Under the second, or subjective, prong of a “deliberate indifference” claim, an individual \nmust next show that prison officials “acted with deliberate indifference to [the plaintiff’s] medical \nneeds.” Brock, 315 F.3d at 162; see also Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104. To meet this second prong, the \nindividual is required to prove that “the prison official knew of and disregarded the plaintiff’s \nserious medical needs.” Harrison v. Barkley, 219 F.3d 132, 137 (2d Cir. 2000) (quoting Chance v. \nArmstrong, 143 F.3d 698, 703 (2d Cir.1998)). A prisoner need not show that an official acted “for \nthe very purpose of causing harm,” Hathaway v. Coughlin, 37 F.3d 63, 66 (2d Cir. 1994), but must \nshow that an official “knows that inmates face a substantial risk of serious harm and disregards \nthat risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it,” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 847. A “fact finder \nmay conclude that a prison official knew of a substantial risk from the very fact that the risk was \nobvious.” Id. at 842; Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 738 (2002) (“We may infer the existence of \nthis subjective state of mind from the fact that the risk of harm is obvious.”). The Supreme Court \nhas directed lower courts to consider “prison authorities’ current attitude and conduct” and \npreventative policies put in place in determining whether officials are deliberately indifferent to \nmedical needs. Helling, 509 U.S. at 36 (directing the court of appeals, on remand, to evaluate the \nplaintiff’s Eighth Amendment claim in light of a new smoking policy put in place in the course of \nthe litigation). \nBoth of these standards are easily met in this case. The conditions at FCI Danbury clearly \nviolate Respondents’ obligation not to house the prisoners in their care under conditions posing a \nsubstantial risk of serious harm.   Petitioners and the Class and Subclass they represent are being \nexposed to extreme and unprecedented risk of infection and death because of the failure of FCI \nDanbury to meet the most minimal public health standards. Every person detained at FCI Danbury \nunder the chaotic conditions that prevail and where the applicable CDC Guidance is being ignored \nand disregarded—including every member of the medically vulnerable Subclass—is rendered at \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 39 of 51\nheightened risk of infection that can cause severe and debilitating injury and death and will likely \nsucceed on the merits of their Eighth Amendment claim. \n  Respondents are aware of and recklessly indifferent to the grave threat COVID-19 presents \nto petitioners and the members of the Class and Subclass who are incarcerated at FCI Danbury.  \nBy failing to  abate the risks that these individuals face from COVID-19, Respondents  are \ndeliberately indifferent to their serious medical needs in contravention of the Eighth Amendment.   \n“A prisoner is not required to show that he was literally ignored by the staff to prove an Eighth \nAmendment violation, only that his serious medical needs were consciously disregarded.” Rouster \nv. Cty. of Saginaw, 749 F.3d 437, 448 (6th Cir. 2014). Custodians are still deliberately indifferent \nif they took some action, observed that it was failing, but choose not to adjust. See, e.g, Greene v. \nBowles, 361 F.3d 290, 294 (6th Cir. 2004) (putting prisoner into protective custody but failing to \nprotect her from a risk that persisted even in protective custody was unconstitutional); Hathaway \nv. Coughlin, 37 F.3d 63, 67 (2d Cir. 1994) (“A jury could infer deliberate indifference from the \nfact that [defendant] knew the extent of [plaintiff’s] pain, knew that the course of treatment was \nlargely  ineffective,  and  declined  to  do  anything  more  to  attempt  to  improve  [plaintiff’s] \nsituation.”); Ruffin v. Deperio, 97 F. Supp. 2d 346, 353 (W.D.N.Y. 2000) (deliberate indifference \ncould  be  found  where  “defendants’  treatment’  of  plaintiff  consisted  of  little  more  than \ndocumenting his worsening condition, and continuing the provision of ineffective medications”); \nUnited States v. Rodriguez, No. 2:03-cr-0271, 2020 WL 1627331 (E.D. Pa., April 1, 2020) (“The \ngovernment’s assurances that the BOP’s ‘extraordinary actions’ can protect inmates ring hollow \ngiven that these measures have already failed to prevent transmission of the disease[.]”). \n  Most saliently, although Respondents were directed by Attorney General Barr more than \n30 days ago to give priority to FCI Danbury in identifying medically vulnerable prisoners who \ncould serve their sentences in home confinement, Respondents have failed to transfer such \nmedically vulnerable prisoners from FCI Danbury in any meaningful numbers, thus continuing to \nendanger not only those medically vulnerable individuals but also the prison population at large \nthat would otherwise benefit from de-densification measures. \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 40 of 51\n  And, as set forth above, Respondents have carelessly failed to address the COVID-19 \npandemic sweeping through FCI Danbury.  They have failed to triage cases or to diagnose and \nisolate disease – including by knowingly refusing to take temperatures (and therefore diagnose \nwith COVID-19) prisoners presenting with symptoms consistent with coronavirus infection, \nknowingly distorting temperature readings, and deliberately returning prisoners with confirmed \nfever to the general population – instructing those individuals to take Tylenol and lie down.  \nRespondents have further failed to observe appropriate quarantine/isolation policies, failing to test \nand isolate prisoners in close contact with individuals subsequently diagnosed with cornonavirus, \nand returning individuals who test positive for COVID-19 (whether prisoners, correctional staff, \nor food service personnel) to the general population far earlier than appropriate pursuant to CDC \nGuidance and failing to observe appropriate observation requirements for new prisoners.  \n  Respondents  have  also  deliberately  failed  to  implement  adequate  social  distancing \nmeasures with full knowledge that, pursuant to relevant CDC Guidance, such social distancing is \ncritical to reducing the spread of disease.  The prison layout is incompatible with social distancing \nin the best of circumstances, but Respondents have undertaken actions that exacerbate the problem.  \nThus, correctional staff continue to move regularly between units, in contravention of proper social \ndistancing  and  Respondents  have  deliberately  moved  prisoners  from  rooms  where  greater \nseparation was possible into dorms where such separation is not possible.  Respondents have \nfurther taken patently insufficient action to reduce close contact between prisoners in multiple \naspects of prison life, including lines for phone and computer use, and lines for commissary, \nmedication  and  recreation.    And,  Respondents  have  violated  basic  isolation  protocols, \nintermingling prisoners with unknown COVID-19 exposures into units previously isolated for \nindividuals nearing release or for individuals at heightened medical risk.  \n  Respondents have further failed to observe mandated hygiene measures.  Frequently used \nsurfaces are not regularly sanitized, and cleaning throughout the facility – much of which depends \non prisoner labor – is sporadic at best.  The prison has not made available adequate supplies of \npersonal protective equipment, soap and sanitizers to either prisoners or staff.   Isolation wards are \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 41 of 51\nestablished in unhygienic makeshift spaces, including in visiting rooms or recreation areas with \ninsufficient running water.   \n  Finally, Respondents’ health care system is grossly inadequate.  Aside from the deliberate \nindifference reflected in Respondents’ purposeful efforts to avoid testing for and diagnosing \nCOVID-19 infection in prisoners presenting with symptoms of the disease, non-virus medical \nneeds are being completely neglected: regular physicians are absent, prisoners who do not present \nwith fever during sick call are not being referred for physician follow-up and sick call requests for \nother than virus symptoms – however serious or urgent – go unanswered for prolonged periods of \ntime.  Moreover, the prison pharmacy has been closed and medically vulnerable prisoners are \nbeing subject to extreme delays and disruption of their medication regimens.   \nPetitioners and the Class and Subclass members remain incarcerated at FCI Danbury while \na pandemic sweeps through it like wildfire and every lull is followed by a new eruption. The \nunconstitutionally dangerous conditions at FCI Danbury will inevitably lead to the illness—and \ndeath—of prisoners and corrections officers alike. The Eighth Amendment bars this imminent, \ndeadly exposure to COVID-19 and petitioners are therefore highly likely to succeed on the merits \nof their claims.  \nB.  This Action is Properly Brought Pursuant to Section 2241. \nSection 2241(c)(3) authorizes courts to grant habeas corpus relief where a person is “in \ncustody in violation of the United States.” The Second Circuit has “long interpreted § 2241 as \napplying to challenges to the execution of a federal sentence, including such matters as . . . prison \nconditions.” Thompson v. Choinski, 525 F.3d 205, 209 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). This includes challenges to detention where conditions pose a threat to Petitioners’ \nmedical wellbeing. See Roba v. United States, 604 F.2d 215, 218–19 (2d Cir. 1979) (approving \nthe use of § 2241 to challenge a prisoner’s transfer where that transfer created a risk of fatal heart \nfailure). \n  The Second Circuit’s decision in Roba is instructive. In that case, Petitioner alleged that an \nimminent transfer from New York to face charges in California would create a substantial risk of \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 42 of 51\ndeath because of his precarious heart condition. The Second Circuit held that there was Section \n2241 jurisdiction to challenge his contemplated transfer, where such custody would threaten his \nlife,  citing  Estelle  v.  Gamble,  the  Supreme  Court’s  seminal  case  establishing  the  Eighth \nAmendment’s deliberate indifference standard. 604 F.2d at 218–19. Critically, the court held that \nhabeas jurisdiction was appropriate even though the transfer, and hence custody, was imminent: \n“Petitioner need not wait until the marshals physically lay hands on him; he is entitled now to \nchallenge the allegedly unlawful conditions of his imminent custody.” Id. at 219.  \n  In addition, Petitioners are excused from § 2241’s prudential exhaustion requirements. An \nexhaustion requirement does not apply where the petitioner is likely to suffer an irreparable injury \nwithout immediate judicial relief or where the administrative remedy would be futile. Beharry v. \nAshcroft, 329 F.3d 51, 62 (2d Cir. 2003), as amended (July 24, 2003); see also   United States v. \nBasciano, 369 F. Supp. 2d 344, 348 (E.D.N.Y. 2005) (excusing exhaustion in considering a § 2241 \npetition brought by a prisoner held in SHU, noting that “the court may excuse exhaustion if it \nappears that an administrative appeal would be futile, or because the appeals process is shown to \nbe inadequate to prevent irreparable harm to the defendant”). Here, both exceptions are met. The \nBOP’s Administrative Remedy Program is a lengthy process that would not provide the immediate \nrelief necessary to avoid irreparable injury and does not provide for all measures of relief sought \nby Petitioners on behalf of themselves and other proposed Class members. Moreover, staff at FCI \nDanbury have informed prisoners that, due to the state of emergency under which the facility is \noperating,  staff  are  unavailable  to  review,  investigate,  and  respond  to  grievances  and  the \nadministrative remedy process is suspended. Cassidy Dec. ¶¶ 25, 43. \nIV.  The Equities and Public Interest Weigh in Favor of the Relief Petitioners Seek. \n  The equities and public interest factors, which “merge” when the government is the \nopposing party, Coronel, 2020 WL 1487274, at *7 (citing Planned Parenthood of New York City \nv. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 337 F. Supp. 3d 308, 343 (S.D.N.Y. 2018)), favor \ninjunctive relief here.   \nFirst, “the public interest is best served by ensuring the constitutional rights of persons \n34 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 43 of 51\nwithin the United States are upheld.” Coronel, 2020 WL 1487274, at *7 (quoting Sajous v. Decker, \n2018 WL 2357266, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. 2018)); see also L.V.M. v. Lloyd, 318 F. Supp. 3d 601, 620 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2018). This is especially true in this case, where the constitutional rights at stake go to \nthe very physical well-being of the aggrieved individuals. \n  Second, ensuring public health and safety is also in the public’s interest. Courts have \nrecognized the overwhelming “public interest” in releasing vulnerable individuals “in light of the \nrapidly-evolving public health crisis engendered by the spread of COVID-19.” Coronel, 2020 WL \n1487274, at *8; see Grand River Enters. Six Nations, Ltd. v. Pryor, 425 F.3d 158, 169 (2d Cir. \n2005) (referring to “public health” as a “significant public interest”).  Moreover, the relief \nrequested here would also protect FCI Danbury staff members, as well as the community at large—\nas staff members who come into contact with COVID-19-positive inmates may spread the disease \nto their families and communities.35 Sick prisoners or staff members will frequently need to be \ntransported to local hospitals, which are already overwhelmed. Any action to ease the burden on \nhospitals and healthcare systems – or, at a minimum, to prevent making the situation worse – is \nundeniably in the public interest.  \n \nV.   This Court Has the Power to Grant a Preliminary Injunction and Issue a Provisional \nOrder of Enlargement of Custody While this Habeas Action is Pending. \nIn light of the emergency nature of Petitioners’ circumstances and the issues raised by their \npetition, they request that the Court act immediately to safeguard their wellbeing and the wellbeing \nof the other prisoners at FCI Danbury and enter an Order enlarging their custody to place them and \nother medically vulnerable members of the Subclass on home confinement during the pendency \nof this habeas action.  \nProvisional relief is required here in order to preserve Petitioners’ current state of health \nand wellbeing and to make the remedy of release effective if they prevail in this action. Petitioners \nhave demonstrated “extraordinary circumstances” and presented “substantial claims” supporting \n                                                 \n35  Sandhya Kajeepeta & Seth J. Prins, Why Coronavirus in Jails Should Concern All of Us, THE \nAPPEAL (Mar. 24, 2020), https://theappeal.org/coronavirus-jails-public-health/. \n35 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 44 of 51\nenlargement relief in light of the rampant spread of COVID-19 at FCI Danbury, the particular \nthreat to their health, and Respondents’ failure to ensure necessary social distancing, effective \ntesting and quarantine procedures, and adequate sanitation. Enlargement is, thus, both appropriate \nand necessary here.  \n  A.  The Enlargement Power of the Federal District Courts \nFederal district courts have authority, when habeas actions are pending, to “enlarge” the \ncustody of petitioners. Enlargement is not release. Rather, it is a provisional remedy that modifies \ncustody by expanding the site at which it takes place. That is, the petitioner remains in custody, \nbut the place of custody is changed, or “enlarged,” upon order of the court, from a particular prison \nto a hospital, halfway house, a person’s home, or another setting. See Ex. B, Declaration of \nProfessor Judith Resnik Regarding Enlargement and the Use of Provisional Remedies for Detained \nIndividuals (“Resnik Dec.) ¶¶ 28-29; see also Wilson v. Williams, No. 20-cv-00794, 2020 WL \n1940882, *4 (N.D. Ohio, April 22, 2020) (describing the authority of the district court to grant \nenlargement pending a ruling on the merits of a habeas petition, noting that “[w]hen a court \nexercises its power to ‘enlarge’ the custody of a defendant pending the outcome of a habeas action, \nthe BOP maintains custody over the defendant, but the place of custody is altered by the court”).  \nEnlargement is part and parcel of Congress’s authorization of federal judges under the \nhabeas statutes to “summarily hear and determine the facts, and dispose of the matter as law and \njustice require.”  See 28 U.S.C. § 2243.  \nJudges in this District have long recognized and utilized enlargement as a provisional \nremedy in habeas actions. See Resnik Dec. ¶¶ 32-34 (describing Judge T.F Gilroy Daly’s use of \nenlargement in the 1970s); see also Mapp v. Reno, 241 F.3d 221, 226 (2d Cir. 2001) (describing \nthe authority of district courts to release habeas petitioners pending a ruling on the merits, using \nthe term “bail” instead of “enlargement”); Ostrer v. United States, 584 F.2d 594, 596 n.1 (2d Cir. \n1978); Gaymon v. Whidden, No. 3:11-cv-805, 2011 WL 2078632 (D. Conn. 2011) (recognizing \nthe existence of such power with respect to a petitioner seeking relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2254); \nRado v. Meachum, 699 F. Supp. 25, 26 (D. Conn. 1988) (“A federal court has the inherent power \n36 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 45 of 51\nto release a state prisoner on bail pending resolution of his habeas petition.”).36 \nEnlargement is appropriate when, as here, a court must work through novel and complex \nlegal issues in the context of an urgent crisis. Enlargement provides the court a provisional \nmechanism by which to increase the safety of the Petitioners, fellow prisoners, and correctional \nstaff during the course of the legal proceedings and thus ensure that eventual habeas relief is \neffective and meaningful. See Resnik Dec. ¶ 9.   \n  B.  Legal Standard for Enlargement  \nAn order of enlargement pending the merits of a habeas decision is appropriate if a \npetitioner  demonstrates  “extraordinary  circumstances”  and  that  the  underlying  claim  raises \n“substantial claims.” See Mapp, 241 F.3d at 226 (concluding that to obtain an order for release \npending  the  merits  of  habeas  decision,  the  petitioner  must  demonstrate  “extraordinary \ncircumstances” and that the underlying claim raises “substantial claims”). \nIn Wilson v. Williams, No. 20-cv-00794, 2020 WL 1940882, *4 (N.D. Ohio, April 22, \n2020), the court considered an emergency habeas action brought by prisoners related to the spread \nof  COVID-19 at  Elkton Federal Correctional  Institution. The petitioners sued on behalf of \nthemselves and a class of all current and future Elkton prisoners, as well as a subclass of medically \nvulnerable prisoners. They sought immediate relief for the subclass, pending resolution of the \naction, in the form of discharge from the physical confines of the Elkron prison.  \nIn considering the request, the court observed that district courts have authority “to grant \nenlargement to a defendant pending a ruling on the merits of that defendant’s habeas petition,” and \nconcluded that “the exceptional circumstances at Elkton and the Petitioners’ substantial claims, \nthat are likely to succeed at the merits stage, necessitate the exercise of that authority and that such \nrelief is proper for members of the subclass defined infra.” The court defined the subclass as those \n                                                 \n36 Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 23 provides in part that while a decision to release or not \nrelease a prisoner is under review, the prisoner may be “(1) detained in the custody from which release is \nsought; (2) detained in other appropriate custody; or (3) released on personal recognizance, with or \nwithout surety.” Thus, the appellate rule uses language familiar in the context of bail, while also \nauthorizing the prisoner to be detained in “other appropriate custody.” See Resnik Dec. ¶ 35. \n37 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 46 of 51\npeople “identified by the CDC as being at higher risk” from COVID-19.  Because of the class \naction nature of the habeas proceeding, the Court was “unable to determine the specific type of \nenlargement most suitable for each subclass member.” Thus, the court granted “a preliminary \ninjunction, in aid of its authority to grant enlargements, ordering Respondents to determine the \nappropriate means of transferring medically vulnerable subclass members out of Elkton.” Finding \nthat the standard for a preliminary injunction was met, the court entered an order as follows:  \n \nThe  Court  orders  the  Respondents  to  identify,  within  one  (1)  day  all \nmembers of the subclass as defined in this Order. Respondents must identify in the \nlist  each  subclass  member’s  sentencing  court  and  the  case  number  of  their \nunderlying criminal conviction. \n \nFollowing identification, the Court orders Respondents to evaluate each \nsubclass  member's  eligibility  for  transfer  out  of  Elkton  through  any  means, \nincluding  but  not  limited  to  compassionate  release,  parole  or  community \nsupervision, transfer furlough, or non-transfer furlough within two (2) weeks. \n \nIn undertaking this evaluation, Respondents will prioritize the review by the \nmedical threat level. For example, older inmates with heart, pulmonary, diabetes or \nimmunity risks should receive review priority over subclass members who are \nyounger. \n \nSubclass members who are ineligible for compassionate release, home \nrelease, or parole or community supervision must be transferred to another BOP \nfacility where appropriate measures, such as testing and single-cell placement, or \nsocial  distancing,  may  be  accomplished.  In  transferring  subclass  members, \nRespondents must continue to comply with BOP policy of quarantining inmates for \n14 days prior to transfer out of Elkton. \n \nAny subclass members transferred out of Elkton may not be returned to the \nfacility until the threat of the virus is abated or until a vaccine is available and \nElkton obtains sufficient vaccine supplies to vaccinate its population, whichever \noccurs first. (Id. at *10-11). \n  Numerous federal district courts have already determined that enlargement (or relief styled \nas “bail”) is an appropriate provisional remedy in the context of a habeas petition related to the \nspread of COVID-19 in detention facilities, citing the “exceptional circumstances” at the facility \nand the petitioners’ likelihood of success on the merits of their claims. See, e.g., Wilson, 2020 WL \n1940882, at *4; Coronel, 2020 WL 1487274, at *9 (noting that “[s]evere health issues have been \n38 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 47 of 51\nthe  prototypical  but  rare  case  of  extraordinary  circumstances  that  justify  release  pending \nadjudication of habeas” and “[i]n order to secure a meaningful bond hearing and therefore preserve \nthe effectiveness of the remedy sought on habeas, Petitioners must be released until they receive \ntheir  bond  hearings”);  Avendano  Hernandez  v.  Decker,  No.  20-CV-1589  (JPO),  2020  WL \n1547459, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2020) (“continued risk of exposure to COVID-19” constituting \n“extraordinary circumstances”); Basank v. Decker, No. 20 Civ. 2518 (AT), 2020 WL 1953827, at \n*13 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 23, 2020) (granting release where claims of deliberate indifference to serious \nmedical needs and risk from COVID-19 are “plainly substantial” and “[d]etention of Petitioners \npending final adjudication of this action could cause severe illness or death—precisely the harm \ntheir petition seeks to avert”); Barbecho v. Decker, No. 20-CV-2821 (AJN), 2020 WL 1876328, \n*8 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 15, 2020) (noting that “[s]evere health issues have been the prototypical but \nrare case of extraordinary circumstances” and that, were petitioners to remain in detention, they \nwould face significant risk of contracting COVID-19); Savino v. Souza, No. CV 20-10617-WGY, \n2020 WL 1703844, *8-9 (D. Mass. Apr. 8, 2020) (bail for detainees in habeas class, citing the \n“exceptional circumstances of this nightmarish pandemic”); United States v. Nkanga, No. 18-CR-\n713 (JMF), 2020 WL 1695417, *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2020) (ordering release on bail pending \ndetermination of § 2255 motion alleging counsel was ineffective in not requesting delay of self-\nsurrender date in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic).  \nCONCLUSION \nEnlargement is an appropriate and necessary form of provisional relief here in light of the \nexceptional circumstances, Petitioners’ substantial claims, and the urgent risk that COVID-19 \nposes  to  health  and  life  of  all  persons  incarcerated  at  FCI  Danbury  without  immediate \nimplementation of appropriate social distancing measures.   \nThe country faces a public health crisis of epic proportions. COVID-19 presents risks to \nall of us, and has forced us to come together to make tough decisions that are necessary to reduce \nthe number of fatalities caused by the virus. We must allow everyone to engage in practices that \nflatten the curve, including social distancing and rigorous hygiene—particularly for those among \n39 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 48 of 51\nus who are most vulnerable. Both the United States Department of Justice and the federal Bureau \nof Prisons have acknowledged the obligation to de-densify federal correctional institutions—\nincluding FCI Danbury in particular—by transferring the most medically vulnerable prisoners to \nhome confinement in order to protect not just the health and welfare of these more medically \nvulnerable individuals but the health and welfare of the entire prison population and the staff. \nBut Respondents have not acted on their admitted obligations. They have left highly \nvulnerable prisoners to languish in a highly contagious environment and wait for this disease to \nrip through their prison, leaving severe illness and death in its wake. The Constitution demands \nbetter. This Court should grant Petitioners’ Motions for Temporary Restraining Order and for \nPreliminary Injunction, preliminarily certify the proposed medically vulnerable Subclasses, and \nissue provisional remedies, including enlargement, in aid of its habeas jurisdiction, ordering \nRespondents to: \n \n(1) enlarge to home confinement all women currently housed in the camp;  \n \n(2) enlarge to home confinement all members of the medically vulnerable Subclass; and  \n \n(3) implement appropriate measures to maximize social distancing and improve hygiene \nfor the prisoners who remain at FCI Danbury for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n \n   \n40 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15   Filed 04/30/20   Page 49 of 51\nDated April 30, 2020        Respectfully Submitted,  \n \n \n/s/  David S.

I am currently in custody at Danbury FCI in the low security satellite prison (\"FSL\"). My \nBureau of Prisons (\"BOP\") Register Number is 21032-043. \n2.  I am 42 years old. \n3.  Even before the coronav irus pandemic, the medical care at this facility has been terrible. \nIf a person is sick, they have to go to \"pill call\" that day to get a sick call slip. They then \nfill out the slip to request an appointment with medicaL Most people are not seen for \nweeks. \n4.  Normally, there is a pharmacy tech at medical every day to pass out medicine for pill call. \nI believe that there is a doctor who rotates between the three facilities at Danbury all \nweek. He is only at FSL certain days. He is an OB/GYN. There is one nurse at FSL who \nalso rotates through the facilities. There are two psychologists who are here every day \nduring the week. \n5.  Currently, medical staff is rotating through the different facilities. The medical staff are at \nour facility for appointments only, and they are rarely here. If it is past a certain time of \nthe day and you have a medical emergency, you have to tell an officer what's going on \nand the officer will call the medical staff member who is on call that night and tell them \nwhat's happening. The medical staff member will determine ifthe person with the \nmedical emergency needs to be taken to the hospital or not. \n6.  The woman in the bunk directly across from me (my \"bunkie\") was sick for three weeks. \nShe was coughing up her lungs, her body was sore, she was running a fever, not eating, \nvomiting, and barely getting out ofbed. Some other women and I told the staff we \nthought she had the virus. Medical staff told her there was nothing wrong with her. She \nwas not tested for COVID-19. \n7.  Staff check everyone's temperature with the same kind ofthem1ometer. There is a nurse \nwho came to FSL on April 27th to help because the facility is short-staffed, and he called \nthe thermometer cheap. The temperature read-out is the same for everyone. \n8.  On April 25th the facility tested 43 women for COVID-19 and 11 women tested positive. \n9.  The women who tested positive for COVID-19 were placed in the visitation room at FSL. \nThe women who tested negative were placed in the dining room. \n10. The dining room and the kitchen are in one building. It's kind of like a Popeye' s \nrestaurant, with the food served behind a line, tables in front, and the cooking area in the \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15-1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 3 of 3\nback. The dining room has one bathroom with a toilet and a sink. There are 32 women in \nthere now. \n11. The visiting room has one shower and one toilet. \n12. Some women who have been quarantined are placed in classrooms. There aren't any \ntoilets or showers or sinks in the classrooms. Some of those women have had to wait \nhours before they were let out to use the restroom. \n13. The facility tested people who were in contact with the woman who went to the hospital \non the 241 Anyone who was in contact with her was asked to go to a certain area. \nh. \nHowever, the facility did not ask about or test everyone who were watching tv, playing \ncards, or otherwise interacting with people who tested positive. \n14.

This declaration supplements the declaration that I provided on April 25, 2020. \n3_  On April 24th, the day the woman who bad been vomiting and dry heaving was taken to \nthe hospital, one of the other women at FSL got a disciplinary report because she called \nher lawyer about the incident The officer told the rest of us that he would be listening to \ncalls and anyone calling their lawyer would also get a disciplinary report \n4_  On the afternoon of April 25th everyone at FSL was sent outside except for maybe 40 \npeople who were going to be quarantined and tested for COVID-19 _W  hen we came back \ninto the unit those 40 women were in Rec waiting on the testing results_ \n5.  At 9:30pm that same evening everyone except for the 40 people was sent outside again \nfor about an hour so that the people who were being quarantined could gather their \nbelongings. \n6.  Mter I came back into the unit my name was called and a nurse was waiting for me_ I \nwas told I needed to be tested, and at about 11 pm I was tested and came back negative for \nCOVID-19 _T  he warden sent me back into the unit \n7 _ Among the 40 people being quarantined, 11 people tested positive for COVID-19 _T  hey \nwere placed in the visiting room for isolation. The other 30 or so people, who tested \nnegative, were placed on cots in the dining hall for quarantine. \n8_  The dining hall is where we would eat for mealtimes before our meals started to be \nbrought into the dormitory. It is connected to the kitchen. Now we stand in line and have \nthe meals handed out to us in the dorm. \n9 _ The dining hall has two doors, but one is kept locked. The dining hall has one bathroom \nwith one toilet and one sink There is no shower. A trailer that has showers and toilets \nwas brought down from Camp for the people in the dining halL \n10  _T  he visiting room has three bathrooms. Two have two toilets and two sinks_ The third has \none toilet, one urinal, and two sinks. When I was there earlier this month there was only \none shower, which was in the third bathroom. It was a temporary stand-up stall built out \nof two by fours. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15-2   Filed 04/30/20   Page 3 of 3\n11. In addition to the women in the dormitory, dining hall, and visiting room, there is one \nwoman in the library. The library does not have heat and is often so cold you can see \nyour breath. \n12. There are also two to three women in each education room. \n13. On April28t\\ around lunchtime we were all sent outside and told to wait in line by the \nback door ofRec. We were brought through the door two at a time, and medical staff \ntook our temperature and asked whether we were having symptoms like coughing, sore \nthroat, fever, body pains, etc. I said no. I am very weak still but not having any of those \nother symptoms. We were all sent back into the unit. \n14. I worry that people in the unit could still be positive and getting other people sick because \nseveral of the women tested positive for COVID-19 and were isolated had absolutely no \nsymptoms. \n15. I have reviewed the information contained in this declaration. I declare under the penalty \nof perjury that the contents of this declaration are true and correct to the best of my \nknowledge.

I am currently in custody at Danbury FCI in the low security satellite prison (\"FSL\"). My \nBureau of Prisons (\"BOP\") Register Number is 13335-036. \n2.  I am 40 years old. I have issues with liver disease and obesity. \n3.  In February there were a handful of women at FSL that became very ill. Some of them \nwere in bed for weeks. They put in requests to see medical. Some were seen if they had \nbreathing issues. No one received treatment. \n4.  We were still in programming through March 2151\n• \n5.  Around that time staff started to wear masks and carry hand sanitizer. \n6.  Hand sanitizer was out of stock at the commissary and remains out of stock. \n7.  A few weeks later we were given masks. \n8.  The facility started quarantining people after a woman here was taken to the hospital at \nthe end of March and tested positive for COVJD-19. She had tested negative when she \nwas tested at the facility. \n9.  After she went to the hospital, a couple of other women were sick on the unit. One of \ntheir temperatures was 103 degrees. She was told to take aspirin. A couple of days later \nthe woman with the high temperature and her bunkmate, who was also sick, were put into \nquarantine in the visiting room. When the woman who went to the hospital returned to \nthe facility, she was also placed in the visiting room. \n10. When the rest of the women in the unit went to that building for pill line they were in \ncontact with the women in the visiting room who tested positive. \n11. On April 241 a woman at FSL was deathly ill. She was taken to the hospital after gagging \nh \nand puking for hours. \n12. On April251 around noon we were all asked to go outside so that the facility could test \nh \nthe people who slept close to the woman who went to the hospital. They tested about one \nfourth of the population. Out of that one fourth, a quarter tested positive for COVID-19. \n13. While they were doing testing and waiting for results, the women who tested negative \nand those who tested positive were sitting together. They were also coming into the unit \nwhere everyone else was to get their belongings. \n14. At 9pm that evening we were asked to go outside so the women who were being \nquarantined could come into the unit and take showers and use the phones. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15-3   Filed 04/30/20   Page 3 of 3\n15. Since April251 the women who tested positive for COVID-19 (about 10-11 people) \n\\ \nhave been in the visiting room. The women who tested negative (about 30 people) are in \nthe chow hall (dining room), which is connected to the kitchen. There is also an open dish \nroom window that c01mects the dining hall to the dish room in the kitchen. \n16. That night (ofthe 25th) one of the women who was in the chow ball was sent to the \nhospital and tested positive for COVID-19. As far as I know, she is still at the hospital. \n17. Another woman who was housed with the woman who went to the hospital was working \nin the kitchen the day (the 26th). \n18. The dining room and visiting room have bathrooms. There is a portable shower outside \nthe dining room for the people there. \n19. There were also three women in the education rooms-there are three separate education \nrooms, all of which are very small-and one woman in the library. These rooms do not \nhave running water. The women in these rooms had to walk through the halls to the \nbathrooms, which are in the same place where we all go for pill line. The woman in the \nlibrary is sometimes taken to the portable shower (same as used by those in the dining \nroom) to shower. \n20. On April 29th the women in the education rooms and the library were moved to the \nspecial housing unit (SHU) in the FCI building. \n21. The clothes ofwomen in quarantine are taken by prisoners and staff to be washed in the \nwashers and dryers here in the unit we are all housed in. The prisoners do not have gloves \nto wear while they are doing this. The washer and dryer units are not being sanitized \nafterwards. \n22. The staff are moving between the donnitory unit and the different quarantine rooms. The \nwomen here also move between the different buildings to go to pill line. \n23. I am very concerned for our welfare here. \n24. I declare under the penalty of perjury that the contents of this declaration are true and \ncorrect to the best of my knowledge. I will sign a hard copy of this declaration at my \nearliest opportunity. \nIs/Shannon Battle \nApril29, 2020 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15-4   Filed 04/30/20   Page 1 of 4\nEXHIBITR \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15-4   Filed 04/30/20   Page 2 of 4\nDeclaration of Kimberly Kitts \n1. I am currently in custody at Danbury FCI in the low security satellite prison (FSL). My \nBureau ofPrisons (BOP) Register Number is 01234-138. \n2. I am 52 years old. \n3. I am serving 87 months for wire fraud. My release date is set for July 1, 2025. \n4. I am housed in a dormitory at FSL with about 160 women (base count as of 4/24/2020 168). \n5. On April 24th, a woman in our dormitory was very ill and was taken by ambulance to the \nhospital after several hours of vomiting and dry heaving. \n6. The next day, 43 women who were determined to have had very recent contact with the sick \nwoman were removed from the dormitory to be tested and quarantined. Before they were \nremoved, they were coming in and out of the dormitory to get their personal property, use the \nphones, use the computers, use the bathrooms and take showers. The showers and other common \nareas were not cleaned after this happened. \n7. These 43 women were tested for COVID-19, and 10 of them tested positive. \n8. One of the women who was taken to quarantine was later taken by ambulance to Danbury \nHospital on April 26th. She had tested negative for COVID-19 the day before when all of the \nquarantined women were tested. She tested positive for the virus at the hospital. \n9. The quarantined women were split into two groups. The 33 who had tested negative were sent \nto sleep in the dining hall which is adjacent to the facility's kitchen. The 10 who tested positive, \nwere sent to sleep in the visitation room. With the exception of the one lady who was removed to \nthe hospital on the 26th, the remaining 32 women remain in the dining hall and 10 in the \nvisitation room. \n10. The dining hall is adjacent to the kitchen where all of the FSL meals are prepared. The floor \nis concrete and under normal conditions, it holds 40-50 inmates for a meal. Now, it needs to \nsleep 32 inmates since the one was taken out on the 26th. \n11. The visitation room has 4 spring beds and the rest of the women in that room sleep on \nmattresses on the floor. There is one bathroom for their use with a sink and toilet and a makeshift \nshower stall has been put into the room. There is one phone in the room for their use. There is no \ncomputer access and there is a TV with DVDs only and no current news or information access. \n12. The dining hall windows have been covered in a way where no natural light can get into the \ndining hall. When the women were initially sent to the dining room, there were not enough cots \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15-4   Filed 04/30/20   Page 3 of 4\nfor everyone, so many slept on the concrete floor with only blankets. There is heat but I am told \nit is very cold in the room. There is one bathroom they have access to with a toilet and sink only. \nMobile showers were put outside for these women to use which they need to be allowed out of \nthe dining hall to use. I am told there is no schedule for this and the number of showers is limited \nto 3 or 4 stalls. \n13. The ladies in the dining hall have no access to television, computer or phone. Until Monday \nmidday they were not given cleaning supplies, paper towels, toilet paper (other than the couple \nof rolls in the bathroom), feminine pads/tampons, envelopes, cop outs and more. I was in the \nCounselor's office on Monday when those items were being given to an officer to deliver to the \ndining hall. They were given commissary sheets and were shopped. Their items will be delivered \ntoday, Wednesday. \n14. The visitation room has heat and the windows are not currently covered, so they do get \nnatural light. \n15. There is a women who was removed to the hospital around 2pm April23rd via ambulance. \nShe tested negative for COVID-19 at the hospital and was returned to the GED room alone that \nsame evening. She had access there to share the toilet with the other quarantine rooms in the \nother warehouse. On the 25th, she was moved to the library which has no heat, no running water, \nno access to phone, TV, computer, toilet or shower. The floor is concrete and she must sleep on a \ndesk. She has to be brought by an officer to use the bathroom and shower in the san1e shared \nfacilities she used on the 23rd and 24th. It's not a short walk. She has been allowed one shower \nsince the 23rd. My understanding is that she has had multiple surgeries for cancer and currently \nhas two growths that are going untreated. She also has a chest tube. \n16. Since the women have been in the dining hall, several have repeatedly been in the dormitory \nto use the phones and computers for email. On the morning of April 26th, I saw one of the \nquarantined women getting into the shower, another on a phone and one sat next to me to use a \ncomputer. This activity continued throughout the day. I have seen little oversight over how \nlaundry gets passed between the rooms where people are quarantining and the dormitory. \n17. The same staff including officers, medical and administrative personnel move among the \nvarious quarantine rooms and dormitory throughout their shifts. \n18. On April 27th, one of the other women discovered a bag of outgoing mail from prisoners in \nthe trash. We place our outgoing mail into a locked box in the unit. The box has to be unlocked \nby an officer in order to be removed. I saw the mail some of the envelopes and there were \naddress labels and names of inmates on the mail that was found. The woman who discovered the \nmail brought it to the officers station. I have no additional information. \n19. On April 28th, all of the women in the dormitory were sent outside to the Rec Yard. We were \nbrought back into the inside Rec Area one by one. I was the first to be called back in. When I \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15-4   Filed 04/30/20   Page 4 of 4\ncame in, medical staff took my temperature, which registered at 98 degrees. Another of the \nmedical staff asked me questions to screen for COVID-19 risk. The staff told me they were not \ntesting anyone unless they said they had symptoms of cough, diarrhea, fatigue, muscle aches or \nintestinal issues. I told them about my Crohns Disease and symptoms. I was given lunch and told \nto go into the unit and eat. I was not tested. \n20. After everyone had their temperatures taken and were asked the screening questions, no one \nelse presented with a temperature above normal either. No one admitted to any symptoms. No \none was tested and no additional people were removed from the unit as of today. \n21.

This information supplements my earlier declaration dated April26, 2020. \n3.  On April 261 2020 one of the women who had been quarantined the day before went to \n\\ \nthe hospital by ambulance. \n4.  On the morning of April271h some of the women who were in quarantine and tested \nnegative ran into the unit and gathered more personal belongings. Some of them used the \nphones and computers for email. Some of them used the shower. They then went back \ninto quarantine. They were able to do this because they were not being monitored. \n5.  The women who were quarantined and tested positive are being held in the visiting room. \n6.  The women who were quarantined and tested negative-about 30 people-are in the \ndining hall. This is a room about 60x30' in size. There are bathrooms in the dining hall, \nand the facility brought in a porta-shower truck for them to use to shower. Yesterday they \nput in a phone for them to use and got them cleaning supplies. \n7.  Staff members are moving between all of the different areas of the facility where women \nare quarantined and the dormitory. \n8.  Since April l81 prisoners have been working in the kitchen. This is when we started \nh \ngetting our meals in the unit instead of the dining hall. Prisoners who are working in the \nkitchen had been working side-by-side with a prisoner who tested positive for COVID-19 \non April25111• None of them have been tested or removed from where they are since that \nwoman tested positive. \n9.  On April 27th, a new prisoner was brought into the FSL. She was placed in quarantine in \nthe other building where the kitchen, visiting, and education rooms are. \n10. On April 27111, the woman who had been sent to the hospital on April 241h was brought \nback to the facility and placed in the visitation room with the other people who have \ntested positive for COVID-19. \n11. On April28111 the staff took everyone's temperature and asked us if we had shortness of \nbreath, cough, body aches, fever, sore throat, diarrhea, or chills. We were then given a \npersonal pizza for lunch and sent to eat in the dorm. No one was taken into quarantine. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 15-5   Filed 04/30/20   Page 3 of 3\n12.

      "title": "Class Action Filed Against Bureau of Prisons for Gross Failures in COVID-19 Response at FCI Danbury",
      "text": "For immediate release: \nCLASS ACTION FILED AGAINST BUREAU OF PRISONS FOR  \nGROSS FAILURES IN COVID-19 RESPONSE AT FCI DANBURY  \nA class action lawsuit was filed today in federal court in Connecticut seeking to require federal \nofficials to provide emergency measures to protect the 1,000+ women and men at the three facilities \nwithin the low security federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut (“FCI Danbury”) from COVID-19. \nThe lawsuit responds to the COVID-19 disaster that is underway at FCI Danbury.  The prison has \none of the biggest outbreaks in the federal system, and in recent weeks, more than forty incarcerated \npeople and more than thirty staff have tested positive for COVID-19.  Many more are likely positive, but \nthe Bureau of Prisons is not reliably releasing that information and, worse yet, for some time stopped \ntesting. \n“Public health experts uniformly agree that prisons are hot spots for the spread of COVID-19 \nthat require prison officials to take swift action to protect the lives of those in their custody,” said \nProfessor Sarah Russell, one of the lawyers representing the proposed class.  “FCI Danbury has \ncompletely disregarded these warnings, placing incarcerated people at an unbearable and \nunconstitutional risk of contracting the disease.” \nThe people imprisoned at FCI Danbury are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19.  They live in \nclose quarters, with units containing more than 100 people lined up in rows of bunk beds, and with \ncommunal bathrooms and dining areas.  Many are experiencing serious symptoms, including high fevers \nand difficulty breathing, but have not been tested or removed from these crowded living areas.  Access \nto medical care in the facility is woefully inadequate, and there have been significant delays in getting \ncritically ill prisoners transported to local hospitals. \nFCI Danbury contains a women’s “camp,” the lowest level security facility in the entire federal \nprison system.  Yet, despite the ability to release low-level prisoners, those incarcerated at FCI Danbury \nremain in dangerous living conditions virtually certain to promote the spread of COVID-19 through the \nDanbury prisoner and staff populations. \n  The lawsuit filed today asks the federal district court to order that the Bureau of Prisons \nimmediately identify prisoners who are medically vulnerable and can be safely relocated to home \nconfinement, as Attorney General Barr has directed, and to provide safe and humane conditions for \nthose imprisoned at FCI Danbury. \nThe case is brought by the law firm of Silver Golub & Teitell LLP, the Civil Justice Clinic at \nQuinnipiac University School of Law, and the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization at Yale Law \nSchool.  \n \nFor more information, contact: \nMarisol Orihuela, Yale Law School - 404-625-2307; Sarah Russell, Quinnipiac University School of Law - \n917 749-4008; David S.

EASTER, Warden of Federal     : \nCorrectional Institute at Danbury,     : \n            :             \n            : \nRespondent.          :             June 8, 2020   \n \n \nPETITIONERS’ MOTION FOR SANCTIONS \n AND SUPPORTING MEMORANDUM OF LAW  \n \nOne of the basic tenets of litigating fairly is that parties preserve relevant evidence. \nViolation of this norm is so contrary to our judicial system that it permits district courts -- \npursuant to their inherent power to oversee the judicial process -- to employ a variety of \nsanctions against the violating party when appropriate. That is the case here. Respondent has an \nongoing obligation to keep medical records, which include requests for medical care, and she \nwas clearly on notice of her duty to preserve all medical records by the time this action was filed. \nDespite her ongoing obligation and being on notice of the relevance of all medical records in this \ncase, Respondent’s practice up until last week was to destroy requests for medical care (called \n“sick call” requests). Petitioners respectfully move this Court for sanctions. Specifically, for the \nreasons stated below and based on the evidence in this case, Petitioners move for entry of an \nOrder precluding Respondent from disputing that FCI Danbury’s system for responding to sick \ncalls requests was inadequate and untimely to provide proper medical care to inmates.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 83   Filed 06/08/20   Page 2 of 10\nI.  Factual and Procedural Background  \nPetitioners filed the instant action for habeas corpus relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 \non April 27, 2020. ECF No. 1. In their petition, Petitioners expressly allege significant delays \nand other deficiencies with FCI Danbury’s system for responding to prisoners’ requests for \nmedical care and, specifically, allege deficiencies in FCI Danbury’s system to responding to \n“sick call requests” from prisoners. See ECF No. 1 at ¶ 36.e. (describing sick call system at FSL), \n¶ 37.d. (same for Camp), ¶ 38.f. (same for FCI, or men’s facility), ¶ 129 (alleging that “[s]ince \nthe lockdown began, sick call triage in the men’s facility is conducted by a social worker without \nmedical training, and who is openly contemptuous of the men’s need”), ¶ 130 (“At men’s and \nwomen’s facilities, prisoners who present for sick call who do not exhibit fever are denied access \nto any further medical follow-up”), ¶ 188 (“As a result of the increased attention to the COVID \nepidemic, non-virus medical needs have gone unattended. The regular prison physicians have \nbeen absent or are no longer available to prisoners on the unit, prisoners who do not present with \nfever during sick call cannot be referred to a physician, and sick call requests for other than virus \nsymptoms go unanswered for prolonged periods of time”). \nOn May 18, 2020, Petitioners served interrogatories and requests for production on \nRespondent. See Exhibit A, attached hereto (Petitioners’ Requests for Production); Exhibit B \n(Petitioners’ Interrogatories). Through Request for Production Number 7, Petitioners specifically \nrequested “[a]ll documents concerning sick call requests or other requests made by prisoners for \nmedical care for COVID-19 symptoms since March 1, 2020, and FCI Danbury’s responses to \nthese requests, including but not limited to the date(s) of such responses, who examined the \nprisoner, what (if any) treatment was provided, and the date(s)the treatment was provided.”  Exh. \nA at 7. Further, Petitioners’ Interrogatory Number 8 asked Respondent to “[s]tate the number of \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 83   Filed 06/08/20   Page 3 of 10\nsick call and other requests for medical care made from prisoners at each of the three facilities \n(Main Complex, FSL, and Camp) since March 1, 2020 and state, for each facility, for each day \nsince March 1, 2020, the number of prisoners who were seen respectively by a physician, a \nphysician’s assistant, or a nurse.” Exh. B at 8.  \nRespondent did not produce sick call requests in response to Petitioners’ request for \nproduction or provide the specific answers, as requested in the interrogatory, regarding the \nnumber of sick call requests made since March 1, 2020.1  Petitioners’ counsel raised these \ndeficiencies with Respondent’s counsel, who on or around May 29, 2020 informed Petitioners’ \ncounsel via telephone that Respondent had failed to preserve paper sick call requests because the \nfacility’s practice was to not retain them. Respondent’s counsel indicated that the sick call \nrequests would be retained going forward.   \nOn June 3, 2020, Petitioners’ counsel deposed Ms. Angela Dukate, the Health Services \nAdministrator at FCI Danbury, both as a fact witness and as the 30(b)(6) witness on FCI \nDanbury’s medical response to the COVID-19. See Exhibit C (Excerpt of 06/03/20 Dukate \nTranscript) at 21-29. Ms. Dukate testified that FCI Danbury had destroyed all sick call requests \nsubmitted prior to May 29, 2020.  When asked why the facility had failed to preserve these \nrecords, Ms. Dukate asserted that she considers the sick call requests not medical records \nbecause they are, in her view, “informal” and “nothing official.” Id. at 22-23. Ms. Dukate \nadmitted that FCI Danbury continued to destroy sick calls requests after April 27, 2020, the date \nin which this action was initiated, and up until either June 1st or 2nd, weeks after Petitioners had \nrequested sick call requests from Respondent through discovery. See id. at 29.   \n                                                 \n1 In response to Petitioners’ Interrogatory Number 8, Respondent provided the number of prisoners who were treated \nfor sick calls, but did not respond to Petitioners’ requests for the number of sick call requests made. Without the \nnumber of sick call requests made, Petitioners are not able to show how many sick calls were ignored and how many \nprisoners were not seen in response to such requests.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 83   Filed 06/08/20   Page 4 of 10\nRespondent has now produced sick call requests submitted in June 2020.2  Contrary to \nMs. Dukate’s testimony, the requests are on a medical form, contain medical information from \nthe inmate-patient and the health care provider, and reflect the date the request was submitted \nand the date that the inmate was subsequently seen.  They are plainly records that form a part of \neach inmate’s medical records.3 \nNot only did the pleadings and discovery requests in this case put Respondent on notice \nof her obligation to preserve sick call requests, the Bureau of Prisons independently has the \nresponsibility to preserve medical records such as requests for medical care. The National \nCommission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC), which accredits some BOP facilities, sets \nforth that “[w]ithout documentation of these steps, it is not possible to evaluate the \nresponsiveness of your sick-call system, and if you are seeking accreditation, to determine if you \nare in compliance. Request slips are usually filed in the health records and begin the \ndocumentation trail. If you do not file the slips in the record, a log may be kept to monitor the \nstages of the response. The log needs to include the request date, date and result of triage, date of \nthe sick-call visit if required, etc.”4 The NCCHC further recommends that jails and prisons \nmaintain documentation of compliance for three years.5  \nFinally, but importantly, the Bureau of Prisons was put on notice of the relevance of sick \ncall requests to COVID-19 litigation in another case relating to the Metropolitan Detention \nCenter (MDC) in Brooklyn, New York. That suit, alleging deficiencies in the sick call system, \nwas filed on March 27, 2020,6 and by May 1, 2020 the media had publicized the destruction of \n                                                 \n2 Respondent has provided a few sick call requests dated prior to June 2020 that were not, for some unknown reason, \ndestroyed.  \n3 Attached, as Exhibit D, is a (redacted) sick call request form (for June 1, 2020) produced by Respondent.  \n4 FAQ, Documentation, National Commission on Correctional Health Care, available at: \nhttps://www.ncchc.org/documentation.  \n5 Id. \n6 See ECF No. 1, Chunn v. Edge, 1:20-cv-01590-RPK-RLM (E.D.N.Y Mar. 27, 2020).  \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 83   Filed 06/08/20   Page 5 of 10\nsick call requests.7 The destruction of the records was the subject of extensive court filings and \ntestimony in the MDC case.8 In other words, for over one month after it was publicized that a \nfederal jail was improperly destroying requests for medical care, BOP staff continued to destroy \nsick call requests from prisoners at FCI Danbury.  \nII.  Argument \n“Spoliation is the destruction or significant alteration of evidence, or the failure to \npreserve property for another’s use as evidence in pending or reasonably foreseeable litigation.” \nThomas v. Butkiewicus, 3:13-CV-747 (JCH), 2016 WL 1718368, at *7 (D. Conn. Apr. 29, 2016) \n(quoting West v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 167 F.3d 776, 779 (2d Cir. 1999)). If there is a \ndiscovery order, a court may impose sanctions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37. \nId. However, traditionally, and absent a court order, a district court can impose sanctions on a \nspoliating party based on the court’s inherent power to control the judicial process and litigation. \nId. A court has broad discretion to fashion appropriate sanctions when spoliation occurs. Id.  \nSanctions for spoliation should aim to: (1) deter parties from engaging in spoliation; (2) \nplace the risk of an erroneous judgment on the party who wrongfully created the risk; and (3) \nrestore the prejudiced party to the same position he would have been in absent the wrongful \ndestruction of evidence by the opposing party. Id. “Where, as here, the nature of the alleged \nbreach of a discovery obligation is the non-production of evidence, a district court has broad \ndiscretion in fashioning an appropriate sanction, including the discretion to delay the start of a \ntrial (at the expense of the party that breached its obligation), to declare a mistrial if trial has \n                                                 \n7 Nick Pinto, Medical Expert: Federal Jail Intentionally Destroying Medical Records and Hiding Extent of \nCoronavirus Behind Bars, THE INTERCEPT (May 1, 2020), available at: https://theintercept.com/2020/05/01/mdc-\nbrooklyn-jail-coronavirus-medical-records/.  \n8 See, e.g., ECF No. 86, Chunn v. Edge, 1:20-cv-01590-RPK-RLM (E.D.N.Y May 9, 2020); ECF No 89 (May 10, \n2020).  \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 83   Filed 06/08/20   Page 6 of 10\nalready commenced, or to proceed with a trial and give an adverse inference instruction.” \nResidential Funding Corp. v. DeGeorge Fin. Corp., 306 F.3d 99, 107 (2d Cir. 2002). An adverse \ninference instruction is appropriate where: “(1) the party having control over the evidence had an \nobligation to preserve it at the time it was destroyed; (2) that the records were destroyed with a \nculpable state of mind; and (3) that the destroyed evidence was relevant to the party’s claim or \ndefense such that a reasonable trier of fact could find that it would support that claim or \ndefense.” Id. (quoting Chin v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 685 F.3d 135, 162 (2d Cir. 2012)). The \n“culpable state of mind” factor is “satisfied by a showing that the evidence was destroyed \n“knowingly, even if without intent to [breach a duty to preserve it], or negligently.” Residential \nFunding Corp. v. DeGeorge Fin. Corp., 306 F.3d 99, 108 (2d Cir. 2002).  \nPetitioners easily meet all three prongs for the sanction sought through this motion. First, \nthere can be no dispute that Respondent had a duty to preserve paper sick calls. Paper sick calls \nare an important way in which prisoners at FCI Danbury alert the facility that they have a \nmedical problem as they constitute records of prisoners documenting their medical issues and \nseeking medical help. For this reason, the NCCHC provides that jails and prisons retain \ndocumentation of compliance with sick call requests for three years. Even assuming that FCI \nDanbury’s pre-April 27 practice of destroying sick call requests was permissible (which \nPetitioners’ dispute), Respondent had an obligation to preserve sick call requests once she \nreasonably anticipated litigation to which the requests were relevant. Zubulake v. UBS Warburg \nLLC, 220 F.R.D. 212, 218 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (“Once a party reasonably anticipates litigation, it \nmust suspend its routine document retention/destruction policy and put in place a “litigation \nhold” to ensure the preservation of relevant documents.”) As such, Respondent’s litigation duty \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 83   Filed 06/08/20   Page 7 of 10\nto preserve the sick call requests arose at the latest on April 27 when the instant action was filed. \nSee ECF No. 1. \n   Second, Respondent has acted with the requisite culpable mind. “[O]nce the duty to \npreserve attaches, any destruction [of relevant evidence] is, at a minimum, negligent.” Slovin v. \nTarget Corp., No. 12 CV 863 (HB), 2013 WL 840865, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 7, 2013) (quoting \nZubulake, 220 F.R.D. at 220). Here, however, there is evidence for finding an intentional \ndestruction of sick calls. Respondent destroyed evidence not only contrary to applicable \ncorrectional standards and a complaint alleging deficiencies in FCI Danbury’s medical care \nresponse, it did so also after receiving specific discovery requests from Petitioners seeking the \nrequests and information about them. Compare Exhibits A-B (discovery requests propounded on \nMay 18) with Exhibit C (Dukate deposition confirming destruction of sick call requests up until \nJune 1 or 2).  \nThird, the sick call requests go to a critical issue in this case; namely, whether \nRespondent was deliberately indifferent in providing medical care in response to the COVID-19 \npandemic’s impact on the facility. Petitioners have alleged and intend to establish that, despite \nbeing aware of the importance of medical care during a pandemic that has already killed over \n100,000 people in the United States, Respondent’s sick call system regularly ignored or delayed \nin responding to prisoners’ requests for medical care. Such a response not only subjects putative \nclass members to an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death, the response during the \npandemic is at the very least reckless as to the risk of serious injury or death. Indeed, other courts \nin this Circuit have held that prison officials’ disregard of sick-call requests may be evidence of \ndeliberate indifference.  See e.g., Aikens v. Rao, 13-CV-1088S, 2015 WL 5919950, at *2 \n(W.D.N.Y. Oct. 9, 2015) (evidence of ignoring sick call requests sufficient for reasonable jury to \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 83   Filed 06/08/20   Page 8 of 10\nfind that defendants acted deliberately in denying plaintiff treatment); Myers v. Dolac, No. 09 \nCiv. 6642, 2013 WL 5175588, *12 (W.D.N.Y. 2013) (ignoring or destroying sick call requests, if \nproved, sufficient for jury to conclude that defendant knew of plaintiff’s medical condition and \nacted deliberately to deny plaintiff treatment).  \nThe sanction sought here is a reasonable and appropriate one, as Petitioners are \nprejudiced by Respondent’s spoliation. The destruction of the paper sick call requests prevents \nPetitioners from confirming through contemporaneous documentation the testimony of Danbury \ninmates of the inordinate delays between their submission of their sick call requests and the dates \nof response by BOP staff at FCI Danbury. Even worse, Respondent’s spoliation prevents \nPetitioners from proving those requests for medical care that BOP staff at FCI Danbury \ncompletely ignored. Both of these forms of prejudice warrant remedial action through a Court \norder.9   \nBecause Petitioners now are prevented from establishing through documentary evidence \nthat requests for sick call were ignored or that there were significant delays in response to the \nrequests for care, an appropriate sanction in this case is to preclude Respondent from disputing \nthat the sick call system at FCI Danbury timely and adequately responds to prisoners’ requests \nfor medical care at FCI Danbury. Because the Court is the trier of fact, and this matter is not \ngoing to a jury, an adverse inference instruction is not an appropriate sanction. Rather, a sanction \nin the form of precluding Respondent from disputing this issue would more adequately restore \n                                                 \n9 Petitioners anticipate that Respondent will claim that its production of the “Activities Report,” a document which \nlists the dates of clinical encounters with prisoners, cures any potential prejudice.  This is incorrect for multiple \nreasons. First, the Activities Report does not contain the date that a paper sick call request was submitted by the \nprisoner.  Second, after conferring with Ms. Dukate, Respondent’s counsel has informed Petitioner’s counsel that the \ndate the sick call request was made is not saved in the computer system once a patient is seen. Finally, Ms. Dukate \ntestified at her deposition that not all sick call requests are entered into this system.  Accordingly, Petitioners cannot \nrely on the Activities Report as evidence probative of when prisoners made sick call requests and how long it took to \nbe seen.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00569-MPS   Document 83   Filed 06/08/20   Page 9 of 10\nPetitioners to the “position [they] would have been in but for [Respondent’s] wrongful \ndestruction of evidence.” Kronisch v. United States, 150 F.3d 112, 126 (2d Cir. 1998) (“It is a \nwell-established and long-standing principle of law that a party’s intentional destruction of \nevidence relevant to proof of an issue at trial can support an inference that the evidence would \nhave been unfavorable to the party responsible for its destruction”). Such a sanction would also \nserve the other purposes of sanctions for spoliation, including deterring spoliation in the future \nand placing the risk of an erroneous judgment on the party who wrongfully created that risk. \nKronish, 150 F.3d at 126.  \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court should grant Petitioners’ motion for sanctions and \npreclude Respondent from disputing that the sick call system at FCI Danbury failed to \nadequately and timely respond to prisoners’ requests for medical care at FCI Danbury. \n \nDated June 8, 2020         Respectfully Submitted,  \n \n \n  /s/     \nDavid S.
