    "summary": "<p>The plaintiffs, California Attorneys for Criminal Justice and the American Immigration Lawyers Association (Southern California Chapter), filed this petition for writ of mandate on April 24, 2020. They were represented by attorneys from the ACLU of Southern California, ACLU of San Diego, and ACLU of Northern California. Respondents were Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Xavier Becerra.</p>\r\n<p>The petition identified several people, contemporaneously or formerly, held in ICE detention centers which were not offering proper care with regards to the spread of COVID-19. Petitioners argued that the detention centers continued to house detainees in close quarters and in unsanitary conditions. The petition argued that the State of California's continued transfers of non-citizen detainees to ICE detention centers constituted violations of the Due Process clause of both the U.S. Constitution and California state constitution. Petitioners also argued that the conditions also were a threat to the public in general. Therefore, the petition sought a writ of mandate to prohibit the state from transferring any more detainees to ICE detention centers and an order declaring respondents in violation of the Due Process clauses of the U.S. Constitution and the California state constitution. They also asked for attorney's fees and costs.</p>\r\n<p>On April 30, respondents offered their response in opposition. They argued that any responsibility to keep conditions safe for detainees lied with the ICE and the federal government. They also argued that pending federal litigation would provide an adequate remedy and that the petitioners had not identified any duty that respondents had which could be remedied by a writ of mandate.</p>\r\n<p>On May 13 the California Supreme Court issued its opinion. They denied the writ of mandate, finding that the petitioners failed to establish that the respondents had any clear duty. However, they denied the writ without prejudice, so that any party which <em>did</em> have a duty could be brought before the court.</p>\r\n<p>The case is now closed.</p>",

Respondents were Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Xavier Becerra.\r\n\r\nPetitioners argued that the state continued to send non-citizen detainees to ICE detention centers, knowing that those centers were doing an inadequate job at attempting to halt the spread of COVID-19. Petitioners argued that the continued transfers constituted a violation of the Due Process rights guaranteed by both the U.S. Constitution and the California state constitution. Meanwhile, respondents argued that the responsibility for the conditions at the detention centers lied with ICE and the federal government, and that litigation in the federal courts provided an adequate remedy for petitioners. \r\n\r\nThe California Supreme Court ultimately sided with the respondents. They held that the respondents had no duty to take the requested action. However, they issued the ruling without prejudice, so that future lawsuits could be brought forward.",

Coraima Sanchez Nuรฑez is presently on hunger strike at the \nMesa Verde immigration detention facility in Bakersfield, California. She is \ndemanding  her  right  to  live.  Since  the  COVID-19  pandemic  began, \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (โICEโ) has subjected her and her \nfellow detainees to intolerable conditions, as if encouraging COVID-19 to \nspread within the facility. โI [] feel like I am in a death trap and itโs just a \nmatter of time before infection will harm me.โ Declaration of Coraima \nYaritza Sanchez Nuรฑez (Exh. 58) ยถ17. She is in ICEโs Mesa Verde facility,  .t\nr\nu\nfighting for her life, because the State of California put her there. Sonoma  o\nC\n \nCounty Jail officials transferred1 her to ICE custody. Id. ยถ5.  e\nm\ne\n2.  Kelvin  Hernandez  Roman  was  detained  in  the  Adelanto  r\np\nu\nimmigration detention facility in San Bernardino County, California, until a  S\n \nA\ncourt ordered his release just days ago. There he was crammed into a dorm  C\n \ne\nof 70โ80 people, without any protective equipment or adequate sanitation to  h\nt\n \ny\nward against COVID-19. Declaration of Hernandez Roman (Exh. 64) ยถยถ6โ\nb\n \nd\n30, 40โ59. When, just a few weeks ago, he fell ill with a fever, a cough, and  e\nv\ni\nbody aches, โ[n]o one took me to medical.โ Id. ยถ61. โThey were trying to tell  e\nc\ne\nthe officer, this guy is sick, you have to take him to medical, but the officer  r \nt\nn\ndidnโt care.โ Id. When he requested a COVID-19 test and medication for his  e\nm\nu\n  c\no\n  D\n1 This petition defines โtransferโ as any time a prison or jail provides \nnotification to ICE of release dates and/or facilitates ICEโs ability to take \ncustody of an individual as they are being released, as discussed further \ninfra Facts, Sec. E. \n13 \n \n\n \nasthma, the facility nurse told him โno.โ Id. ยถ62. Mr. Hernandez Roman was \nin Adelanto, fighting for his life, because the State of California put him \nthere. Orange Countyโs Theo Lacy Jail officials transferred him to ICE \ncustody. Id. ยถ4. \n3.  Andre  Luis  Laraโa  48-year-old  man  with  diagnosed \nhypertensionโhas been detained pretrial in the Marin County Jail for a \nmonth and half, even though he can afford to pay his bail, because ICE has \nrequested his transfer upon his release from custody. Declaration of Andre \nLuis Lara (Exh. 55) ยถยถ2โ6; Declaration of Nathan Peterson (Exh. 51) ยถยถ3โ\n11. Under the Marin County Sheriffโs policy, if Mr. Lara posts bail, he will \nbe transferred to ICE. Peterson Decl. (Exh. 51) ยถ5โ11; Lara Decl. (Exh. 55) \nยถยถ5โ8. As a result, Mr. Lara remains unnecessarily detainedโand every \nadditional day in custody is one additional day of heightened exposure to a \n.\nt\nr\nvirus that could seriously harm, if not kill him. He faces this danger solely  u\no\nC\nbecause the State of California continues to permit transfers to ICE during   \ne\nm\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. \ne\nr\np\n4.  Up  and  down  the  state,  Californiaโs  jails  and  prisons  are  u\nS\n \ncontinuing to voluntarily transfer individuals to ICE custody in the midst of  A\nC\nthe  pandemic,  even  though  they  are  not  legally  required  to  do  so.  By   \ne\nh\nt\ntransferring individuals to ICE custody, California agencies are delivering   \ny\nb\nthe individuals in their care to dangerous conditions of confinement in ICEโs   d\ne\nv\nfive detention centers in California. ICEโs abject failure to protect the lives \ni\ne\nc\nof people in its custody from the deadly COVID-19 is inviting a calamityโ e\nr\n \nt\na  public  health  crisis  that  will  affect  not  just  the  detainees,  but  the  n\ne\nm\nsurrounding communities and California as a whole. \nu\nc\no\n5.  The  State  of  California  is  aware  of  the  unconscionable \nD\nconditions in ICEโs detention centers. Attorney General Becerra called the \nconditions  a  โCOVID-19-related  catastropheโ  in  the  making,  and  even \ndemanded that ICE halt the transfers and introduction of new individuals into \n14 \n \n\n \nits detention facilities. Exh. 82 at 1801. Yet, the State of California is just as \nresponsible for populating ICEโs โdeath trapโ detention centers. Transfers \nfrom California prisons and jails account for most of ICEโs bookings into \ndetention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those transferred to ICE \nare the very same people the State of California has released early from \ncriminal custody, due to COVID-19 efforts to depopulate jails and prisons \nand save lives. \n6.  The State of Californiaโs continued transfers to ICE at this \nmoment in time is cruel and inhumane, and it defies every effort this state \nhas already made to ebb the spread of the lethal COVID-19 virus. Federal \ncourts across the country, including in California, have lambasted ICEโs \nfailures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in its detention facilities as \nโcallous disregard for the safety of our fellow human beings,โ Bravo Castillo \n.\nt\nr\nv.

Petitioner  California  Attorneys  for  Criminal  Justice \n(โCACJโ)  is  a  membership  organization  of  criminal  defense  attorneys \npracticing in California. CACJ has approximately 1,300 attorney members, \nwho handle criminal cases in every county in the state. CACJ routinely \nengages  in  advocacy  to  advance  justice,  fairness,  and  constitutional \nprotections in the criminal systems in the courts and the Legislature. CACJ \nmembers have clients or former clients incarcerated in California prisons and \njails who are subject to ICE requests for transfer of custody or who have been \ntransferred to ICE. \n9.  Petitioner  American  Immigration  Lawyers  Association, \nSouthern  California  Chapter  (โAILA  SoCalโ)  is  a  membership \n.\nt\norganization  of  over  1,050  member  attorneys  in  Los  Angeles,  Orange,  r\nu\no\nRiverside, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and Ventura  C\n \ne\nCounties,  who  handle  all  manner  of  immigration-related  cases.

Respondent Gavin Newsom is Governor of California. He is   t\nn\ne\nsued in his official capacity. It is Governor Newsomโs legal duty to ensure  m\nu\nc\nthat the laws of California are uniformly and adequately enforced. Governor \no\nD\nNewsom  also  has  special,  emergency  duties  pursuant  to  the  State  of \nEmergency concerning COVID-19, which he declared on March 4, 2020, \nand  which  remains  in  effect.  The  State  of  Emergency  vests  Governor \n16 \n \n\n \nNewsom with broad authority to take actions necessary to mitigate the threat \nof COVID-19. Governor Newsom has complete authority over the California \nDepartment of Corrections and Rehabilitation (โCDCRโ) and can order a \nmoratorium on transfers to ICE during the State of Emergency. Govโt Code \nยงยง 8627, 8567. The Governor also has the power to suspend laws and \nregulations temporarily if compliance with their terms would hinder or delay \nthe stateโs emergency response. Govโt Code ยง 8571. As described below, he \ncan suspend Govโt Code ยง 7282.5 and certain sections of Govโt Code ยง \n7284.6(a) to stop local jail transfers to ICE. The Emergency Services Act \nalso  charges  the  Governor  with  the  responsibility  to  coordinate  the \nemergency plans and programs of all local agencies. Govโt Code ยง 8569.  \n11.  Respondent  Xavier  Becerra  is  Attorney  General  of \nCalifornia. He is sued in his official capacity. It is Attorney General Becerraโs \n.\nt\nr\nduty to ensure that the laws of California are uniformly and adequately  u\no\nC\nenforced. Attorney General Becerra also is responsible for exercising โdirect   \ne\nm\nsupervisionโ over all sheriffs in the state โin all matters pertaining to the \ne\nr\np\nduties of their respective offices.โ Cal. Const. art. V, ยง 13. Under California  u\nS\n \nlaw, sheriffsโ law enforcement duties include the duty โto keep the county  A\nC\njail and the prisoners in it.โ Gov't Code ยง 26605. As the stateโs chief law   \ne\nh\nt\nenforcement officer, Attorney General Becerra is responsible for ensuring   \ny\nb\nthat  the  sheriffsโ  custodial  practices  comply  with  California  law  and   d\ne\nv\nconstitutional requirements. As such, the Attorney General has the power to \ni\ne\nc\norder local law enforcement to stop transfers to ICE.  e\nr\n \nt\nn\ne\nJURISDICTION  m\nu\n  c\no\n12.  Petitioners  respectfully  invoke  this  Courtโs  original  D\njurisdiction under article VI, section 10 of the California Constitution, Code \nof Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1086, and Rule 8.486 of the California \nRules of Court. Petitioners invoke this Courtโs original jurisdiction because \n17 \n \n\n \nthe  issues  presented  are  of  paramount  public  importance  and  must  be \nresolved promptly to address a looming and urgent public health crisis in the \nstateโs  correctional  and  immigration  detention  facilities.  See  California \nRedevelopment Assโn v. Matosantos, 53 Cal. 4th 231, 253 (2011) (original \njurisdiction over mandate challenging statutes that placed redevelopment \nagencies at risk of imminent dissolution); San Francisco Unified Sch. Dist. \nv. Johnson, 3 Cal. 3d 937, 945 (1971) (original jurisdiction over writ petition \nconcerning  the  legality  of  compulsory  busing  as  a  means  of  achieving \nintegration in public schools). \n13.  COVID-19 is a highly contagious, potentially deadly virus \nwith no vaccine or cure. It is spreading rapidly in California. In recognition \nof these grave risks, the State of California has adopted sweeping measures \nto reduce infections in communities throughout the state. California has also \n.\nt\nr\ntaken some important steps to reduce its prison and jail populations, though  u\no\nC\nthese actions have not yet been at a pace or scale to significantly prevent   \ne\nm\nCOVID  outbreaks  in  Californiaโs  carceral  facilities.  Immigration  and \ne\nr\np\nCustoms  Enforcement  (โICEโ),  however,  has  not  made  any  effort  u\nS\n \nwhatsoeverโlarge  or  smallโto  meaningfully  mitigate  the  spread  of  A\nC\nCOVID-19 in its facilities, despite the virus rapidly coursing through the five   \ne\nh\nt\nfacilities in which ICE detains 4,000 people in the state of California. Federal   \ny\nb\ncourts have declared the prospect of failing to release ICE detainees in   d\ne\nv\nadvance of a COVID-19 outbreak to be โbarbaricโ and โunconscionable.โ \ni\ne\nc\nThakker, 2020 WL 1671563, at *9 (ordering release of 13 detainees).2 Yet  e\nr\n \nt\nn\ne\n  m\n  u\nc\n2 See, e.g., Xochihua-Jaimes v.

Time is of the essence. Piecemeal litigation in the lower courts \nis not an option given the dramatic pace at which the crisis is unfolding and \ngiven the sheer number of jails and prisons in the state that transfer people \nevery day to ICEโs custody. A uniform, statewide moratorium on transfers to \nICE is necessary to immediately protect the rights and lives of California \nresidents.

Goldenson Decl. (Exh. 77) ยถ10; Golob Decl. (Exh. 32) ยถ10. The disease \nis believed to spread through โdropletsโ that can be transmitted during close \ninterpersonal contact of about six feet, as well as through touching surfaces \n.\nt\nr\ncontaminated by respiratory droplets produced by a sick person. Schneberk  u\no\nC\nDecl. (Exh. 81) ยถ8. And evidence shows individuals infected with COVID-  \ne\nm\n19 can transmit it to others even if they have no symptoms. Id. ยถยถ12-13.  \ne\nr\np\n17.  Nearly every adult appears to be at risk of infection. Id. ยถ23.  u\nS\n \nAlthough certain characteristics such as advanced age or underlying health  A\nC\nconditions exacerbate the risk of death or serious illness from COVID-19,   \ne\nh\nt\nsignificant numbers of even young, otherwise healthy people with no pre-  \ny\nb\nexisting conditions have died from the virus. Id. ยถ24. And in New York,   d\ne\nv\napproximately one-third of the patients between the ages of 30 and 39 who \ni\ne\nc\ndied  from  COVID-19  did  not  appear  to  have  any  risk  factors.  See  id.  e\nr\n \nt\nMoreover, many individuals have risk factors that have not been diagnosed.  n\ne\nm\nId. ยถ34. This is particularly likely among immigrants in the United States, \nu\nc\no\nwho are disproportionately likely to lack access to health insurance and \nD\nquality health care. Id. Among the nonelderly population, 23% of lawfully \npresent immigrants and more than 45% of undocumented immigrants were \nuninsured as of March 2020, compared to 9% of citizens, Exh. 22 at 972, and \n20 \n \n\n \nthe lack of health insurance often results in a failure to identify chronic \ndiseases or other health conditions. See also Schneberk Decl. (Exh. 81) ยถ34. \n18.  The only known effective measure to reduce the risk of serious \nillness or death from COVID-19 is to prevent people from being infected in \nthe first place. Golob Decl. (Exh. 32) ยถ10. In the absence of a comprehensive \ntesting regime, โsocial distancing,โ or maintaining six feet of separation at \nall times from other people, and quarantining is the only effective means of \nstopping the spread of the virus in the long run. Id. ยถ10; Schneberk Decl. \n(Exh. 81) ยถ38; Goldenson Decl. (Exh. 77) ยถ11.  \n19.  As  a  result,  incarcerated  people  are  at  heightened  risk  of \nCOVID-19 infection. Id. ยถยถ13-24. Correctional and immigration detention \nfacilities are โcongregate settings,โ places where people live and sleep in \nclose  proximity.  Schneberk  Decl.  (Exh.  81)  ยถ41.  Such  enclosed  group \n.\nt\nr\nenvironments make it very difficult, if not impossible, for people to practice  u\no\nC\nโsocial distancing.โ Goldenson Decl. (Exh. 77) ยถยถ13โ14. Indeed, in settings   \ne\nm\nlike immigration detention facilities, โit will be very difficult irrespective of \ne\nr\np\nthe amount of sanitation and hygiene practices employed, to prevent spread  u\nS\n \nin such a confined densely populated space.โ Schneberk Decl. (Exh. 81) ยถ40.   A\nC\n20.  In immigration detention facilities, there is a heightened risk of   \ne\nh\nt\ninfection due to crowding and the layout of facilities, which make social   \ny\nb\ndistancing impossible; inadequate sanitation and hygiene supplies; scant   d\ne\nv\nmedical resources and care; and a high proportion of vulnerable people \ni\ne\nc\ndetained. See id. ยถ42; Golob (Exh. 32) Decl. ยถ13.   e\nr\n \nt\n21.  ICEโs own medical subject matter experts have recognized that  n\ne\nm\nconditions in immigration detention amount to a โtinderbox scenarioโ for the \nu\nc\no\nrapid spread of COVID-19. See Exh. 23 at 984; see also Schneberk Decl. \nD\n(Exh. 81) ยถยถ109โ11.  \n22.  For these reasons, leading public health officials have warned \nthat  without  swift  and  large  judicial  intervention,  the  โepicenter  of  the \n21 \n \n\n \npandemic will be jails and prisons.โ See, e.g., Exh. 20 at 961; Exh. 84 at \n1809-10. Experience already shows how quickly the virus can course through \na correctional or detention facility. For example, in the span of one week, the \nnumber of confirmed COVID-19 cases Chicagoโs Cook County jail jumped \nfrom two to 101. Exh. 28 at 1094. As of April 22, 2020, 448 detainees and \n334 correctional officers and other sheriff employees had tested positive for \nthe virus. Exh. 68 at 1496.  \n23.  Transmission  in  correctional  and  immigration  detention \nfacilities  endangers  not  only  the  incarcerated,  but  also  the  broader \ncommunity. As correctional staff enter and leave the facility, they can carry \nthe virus with them.  Goldenson Decl. (Exh. 77) ยถ27. And any outbreak in a \ncorrectional  or  detention  facility  impacts  the  surrounding  communityโs \nhealth care system. Schneberk Decl. (Exh 81) ยถยถ99-106. For example, news \n.\nt\nr\noutlets report the COVID-19 outbreak at the federal prison in Lompoc,  u\no\nC\nCaliforniaโthe worst federal prison outbreak in the nationโis believed to   \ne\nm\nbe responsible for nearly one-third of all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Santa \ne\nr\np\nBarbara County. Exh. 47 at 1253-56; Exh. 44 at 1217-23. The outbreak is so  u\nS\n \nsevere that, according to the Los Angeles Times, the Countyโs public health  A\nC\nresources are now being committed to the prison to help contain the outbreak   \ne\nh\nt\nand a field hospital is being set up within the prison grounds to prevent โlocal   \ny\nb\nhospitals  from  being  overwhelmed  by  patients  and  their  accompanying   d\ne\nv\nsecurity.โ Exh. 44 at 1220. \ni\ne\nc\n24.  The same strain on state and local public health resources is  e\nr\n \nt\nexpected  of  any  outbreak  in  federal  immigration  detention  facilities.  n\ne\nm\nSchneberk Decl. (Exh. 81) ยถยถ104โ06. Mitigation efforts recommended by \nu\nc\no\nmedical experts and public health officials include depopulating correctional \nD\nfacilities to enable social distancing, limiting or suspending new bookings \ninto custody, and sharply restricting transfers. Id. ยถยถ 94โ95; Exh. 26 at 1020-\n30. The CDCโs guidance specifically urges the โrestrict[ion of] transfers of \n22 \n \n\n \nincarcerated/detained persons to and from other jurisdictions and facilities \nunless  necessary  for  medical  evaluation,  medical  isolation/quarantine, \nclinical care, extenuating security concerns, or to prevent overcrowding.โ \nExh. 26 at 1024. \nB.   ICEโs Abject Failure to Protect Human Lives in its Detention \nCenters from COVID-19 \n25.  COVID-19 is raging through ICEโs detention facilities across \nthe country due to ICEโs abject failure to mitigate its spread. While the total \nnumber of infected people is unknown given the scarcity of testing, as of the \ndate of this petition, ICE reports a total of 297 confirmed COVID-19 cases \namong detainees, 35 confirmed cases among ICE employees at detention \ncenters, and 88 confirmed cases among ICE agents, while the number of \nconfirmed cases among private prison company employees is unknown. Exh. \n.\nt\nr\n76 at 1548-49; see Exh. 35 at 1175.   u\no\nC\n26.  ICEโs Otay Mesa facility, in San Diego, has one of the largest \n \ne\nm\noutbreaks of any ICE detention facility in the country, with 42 confirmed \ne\nr\np\ncases among those in custody. Exh. 76 at 1548-49. The actual numbers of \nu\nS\ninfected detainees nationwide and in California areโbecause of the long   \nA\nC\nincubation period of the virus, the nationwide shortage of testing, and the   \ne\nh\ntime it takes to process a testโundoubtedly far higher. Schneberk Decl.  t\n \ny\nb\n(Exh. 81) ยถ111. The outbreak in ICEโs detention centers is so significant that,   \nd\ne\naccording to news reports, Guatemala has refused to accept new deportees  v\ni\ne\nc\nuntil  ICE  can  ensure  that  they  are  not  infected  by  COVID-19.  This  is  e\nr\n \nt\nfollowing  the  revelation  that  at  least  44  individuals  aboard  a  recent  n\ne\nm\ndeportation flight to Guatemala tested positive for COVID-19. Exh. 48 at \nu\nc\n1264;  see  Exh.  43  at  1214.  According  to  news  reports,  CDC  officials  o\nD\nthemselves randomly tested 12 individuals aboard one deportation flight to \nGuatemala and their tests were all positive for COVID-19, suggesting that \n23 \n \n\n \nthe true rate of infection in ICEโs detention centers is necessarily far greater \nthan reported confirmed cases. Exh. 43 at 1214.   \n27.  ICE has taken no meaningful action to reduce its detention \ncenter populations or to address the spread of the virus coursing through its \nfacilitiesโeffectively willing people in its custody to die. As of April 15, \n2020,  ICE  had  released  only  700  vulnerable  individuals  nationwide  in \nresponse to COVID-19, out of a total of 32,309 detained. Exh. 41 at 1202; \nExh. 39 at 1195. Meanwhile, it has continued its enforcement activities, \nincluding routinely booking into custody new detainees into its detention \nfacilities.  See,  e.g.,  Declaration  of  Kelly  Engel  Wells  (Exh.  78)  ยถ5; \nDeclaration of Katie Kavanagh (Exh. 75) ยถ19; Declaration of Lisa Knox \n(Exh. 65) ยถ8. The result is continued crowding in facilities that house people \nin congregate settings, allowing for no possibility of social distancing. See, \n.\nt\nr\ne.g., Savino v.

In California, ICE has five detention facilities: the Adelanto ICE \nProcessing  Center,  the  Mesa  Verde  Detention  Center,  the  Otay  Mesa \nDetention Center, the Imperial Regional Detention Facility, and the Yuba \nCounty Jail. As of July 2019, these five facilities detained approximately \n4,000 people. Exh. 13 at 606. Four of these facilitiesโall but the Yuba County \nJailโare operated by private prison companies the GEO Group, CoreCivic, \nand the Management Training Corporation. These companies are notorious \nfor  providing  substandard  medical  care  to  immigration  detainees  in \n.\nCalifornia. See Exh. 2 at 22-24, 32-36; see also, e.g., Exh. 9 at 412-14; Exh.  t\nr\nu\no\n6 at 264-318; see also Exh. 10 at 424-25.   C\n \ne\n30.      ICEโs detention centers in California remain crowded and, given  m\ne\nthe design of the facilities, ICE forces detainees to live in conditions that allow  r\np\nu\nfor no social distancing, while providing paltry, if any, protections against the  S\n \nA\nspread of the virus. As public health officials have warned, from the southern  C\n \ne\nborder  to  northern  California,  these  facilities  threaten  public  health  h\nt\n \ny\nb\n \nd\ne\nv\ni\n  e\nc\n  e\nr\n3 ICEโs refusal to use alternatives-to-detention programs, even during this   t\nn\npandemic, is consistent with ICEโs general approach under the Trump  e\nm\nAdministration to aggressively rely on detention over other alternatives. \nu\nThese policies led to a sharp increase in the number of people in  c\no\nimmigration detention, rising from 34,376 in FY 2016 to 50,165 in FY  D\n2019.

Governor Newsom and Attorney General Becerra are well-\naware of the dangerous situation unfolding in ICE detention centers in the \nstate.

In fact, since the pandemic started, transfers from Californiaโs \ni\ne\nc\nprisons and jails have become the primary source of ICEโs new bookings  e\nr\n \nt\ninto Californiaโs immigration detention centers. In other words, it is the  n\ne\nm\nactions of the State of California, more than actions of ICE at this unique \nu\nc\no\nmoment, that are keeping a flow of new people into ICE detention facilities. \nD\nIn litigation, ICE stated that it โis continuing to transfer detainees from state \nand local criminal custodyโ while otherwise โlimit[ing] the intake of new \ndetainees being introduced into the ICE detention system.โ Fraihat v. ICE, \n36 \n \n\n \nDeclaration of Russell Hott (Exh. 42) ยถ12. This is consistent with available \ndata and the first-hand accounts of detainees. For example, in the Yuba \nCounty Jail, ICE booked 44 individuals into custody between March 11 and \nApril 20, 2020. Kavanagh Decl. (Exh. 75) ยถยถ26. Lawyers interviewed 26 of \nthe 44 individuals and learned that all 26 had been transferred to ICE from \nother institutions, with 21 coming from California prisons and jails. Id. \nSimilarly, all new bookings into one dorm in Mesa Verde in a recent two-\nweek period were the product of jail and prison transfers. Knox Decl. (Exh. \n65) ยถ8. See also Wells Decl. (Exh. 78) ยถ5. \n70.  In regular times, California prisons and jails account for a large \npercent of new bookings into ICEโs detention centers. In Fiscal Year 2018, \nCalifornia prisons and jails contributed to 38% of all ICE arrests in the state, \nwith 30.5% (or 4,336) coming from local jails6 and 7.5% (or 1,073) coming \n.\nt\nr\nfrom state prisons.

(Exh. 66). In 2019, the Los Angeles Sheriffโs Department transferred  u\nS\n \n457 individuals to ICE. Martinez Decl. (Exh. 52) ยถ5.  A\nC\n71.  When California prisons and jails transfer individuals, ICE   \ne\nh\nt\nbooks those individuals into one of Californiaโs five immigration detention   \ny\nb\nfacilities where they often remain for long periods of time.

In 2018, 30 local law \nenforcement agencies in California reported to the Attorney General 2,038 \ntransfers into ICE custody. See Romani Decl. (Exh. 80) ยถ16. \n37 \n \n\n \n(same); Espinoza Decl.

Without  any  moratorium  or  limit  on  transfers,  California \nprisons and county jails have continued to transfer individual to ICE custody \neven when individuals are released due to COVID-19 measures put in place \nby  the  Governor,  the  Judicial  Council,  or  local  law  enforcement.  For \nexample, on March 25, 2020, the Los Angeles County Sheriffโs Department \ntransferred a 68-year-old man whom the Los Angeles County Superior Court \nhad  ordered  released  in  specific  consideration  of  COVID-19  to  ICE. \nMartinez Decl. (Exh. 52) ยถยถ7โ9. He is now detained at the Adelanto ICE \nProcessing Center, where the likelihood of his being exposed to the virus is \nfar higher than if he had been released as intended. Id. ยถ10. Similarly, on \nApril 14, 2020, the Ventura County Sheriffโs Office transferred an individual \n.\nt\nr\nto ICE after he was ordered released due to Emergency Rule 4 of the Judicial  u\no\nC\nCouncil, which directed courts to set $0 bail for certain individuals. That   \ne\nm\nindividual remains detained at Adelanto. Starrett Decl. (Exh. 45) ยถ6. Further, \ne\nr\np\nin  the  first  two  weeks  of  April,  the  Sonoma  County  Sheriffโs  Office  u\nS\n \ntransferred  four  people  to  ICE  who  were  released  due  to  the  Judicial  A\nC\nCouncilโs emergency bail orders. Espinoza Decl. (Exh. 54) ยถ6.   \ne\nh\nt\n73.  Californiaโs continued cooperation with ICE transfer requests   \ny\nb\nis not only undermining the (not-yet-sufficient) state and local decarceration   d\ne\nv\nefforts to address COVID-19, by simply moving people from one carceral \ni\ne\nc\nsetting to another, but it is also keeping people incarcerated in county jails  e\nr\n \nt\ndespite their eligibility for bail. For example, in Marin County, the Sheriffโs  n\ne\nm\npolicy is to transfer individuals to ICE custody based on pending charges, \nu\nc\no\nnot convictions, meaning that a person can be transferred to ICE pretrial \nD\nwhen they post bail or are otherwise ordered released pretrial. Keast Decl. \n(Exh. 71) ยถ4; Romani Decl. (Exh. 80) ยถ10. As a result, some individuals in \n38 \n \n\n \ncustody in counties like Marin may not seek pretrial release, despite their \neligibility, to avoid transfer to ICEโkeeping them needlessly incarcerated. \n74.  For  a  month  and  a  half,  Andre  Luis  Lara,  a  48-year-old \nBrazilian citizen with no prior convictions or criminal history, has been \nunnecessarily detained in Marin County Jail because he has an ICE detainer \nthat the Marin County Sheriffโs Office has confirmed in writing it intends to \ncomply with. Lara Decl. (Exh. 55) ยถยถ2โ5; Peterson Decl. (Exh. 51) ยถยถ3โ9. \nAlthough Mr. Lara is eligible for release on bail and he can afford to pay the \namount, he has not posted bail because, if he did, the Sheriff would transfer \nhim to ICE custody, where his life would be further jeopardized. Peterson \nDecl. (Exh. 51) ยถ5โ11; Lara Decl. (Exh. 55) ยถยถ5โ8. Mr. Lara suffers from \nhypertensionโevery  additional  day  that  he  spends  in  custody  is  one \nadditional day of heightened exposure to a virus that could seriously harm, if \n.\nt\nr\nnot kill him. Peterson Decl. (Exh. 51) ยถยถ10โ11; Lara Decl. (Exh. 55) ยถ6.   u\no\nC\n75.  Californiaโs continuing transfers to ICE is also contributing to   \ne\nm\nICEโs Fourth Amendment violations during this pandemic. For example, on \ne\nr\np\nApril 9, the San Quentin State Prison transferred a United States citizen to  u\nS\n \nICE custody. That person was unlawfully detained by ICE at the Yuba  A\nC\nCounty Jail (which holds people for ICE) for over one week before a lawyer   \ne\nh\nt\nintervened. Kavanagh Decl. (Exh. 75) ยถยถ3โ7. On April 14, 2020, the Ventura   \ny\nb\nCounty  Sheriff  transferred  a  person  to  ICE  custody  on  an  immigration   d\ne\nv\ndetainer that the district court for the Central District of California has ruled \ni\ne\nc\nunconstitutional  and  permanently  enjoined,  see  Gonzalez  v.  ICE,  416  e\nr\n \nt\nF.Supp.3d 995 (C.D. Cal. 2019), yet ICE nonetheless issued the detainer and  n\ne\nm\narrested the individual. Starrett Decl. (Exh. 45) ยถยถ6โ7.  \nu\nc\no\nE.   Legal and Policy Framework for Californiaโs Transfers to ICE \nD\nCustody \n76.  ICE requests custody transfers through its I-247 immigration \ndetainer forms. These detainers are unilaterally issued, unsworn, check-the-\n39 \n \n\n \nbox forms ICE agents complete without any judicial review either before or \npromptly after arrest. See Gonzalez v. ICE, 416 F. Supp. 3d 995, 1000 (C.D. \nCal. 2019). The I-247 form requests that a state or local law enforcement \nagency notify ICE of a personโs release date and detain a person in its custody \nfor up to 48 hours beyond their release time to allow ICE to come take \ncustody.  See,  e.g.,  Exh.  51-1  (I-247  form).  California  law  and  policy \nprohibits  state  prisons  and  local  jails  from  detaining  individuals  on \nimmigration detainers, so California agencies interpret immigration detainers \nas requests for notification and transfer of custody to ICE at the point of \nrelease. Govโt Code ยง 7284.6(a)(1)(B) (prohibiting local law enforcement \nfrom detaining an individual on an immigration detainer, but permitting \nnotification and transfer in certain circumstances); Exh. 7 at 320 (โCDCR \nwill no longer retain an inmate past his/her parole/discharge date to facilitate \n.\nt\nr\npick-up by ICEโ but stating it will facilitate notification and release to ICE).   u\no\nC\n77.   For the purposes of this petition, โtransferโ to ICE shall refer   \ne\nm\nto any time a state prison or local jail provides notification to ICE of release \ne\nr\np\ndates and/or facilitates ICEโs ability to take custody of an individual as they  u\nS\n \nare being released from prison or jail, whether or not the jail or prison uses  A\nC\nthe term โtransfer,โ and whether or not the ICE arrest or pick-up happens   \ne\nh\nt\ninside the jail or prison or in a public lobby. See, e.g., Romani Decl. (Exh.   \ny\nb\n80) ยถ10 (describing how Marin and Fresno County take the position that   d\ne\nv\nhanding a person over to ICE in a custodial setting is not a โtransferโ), Exhs. \ni\ne\nc\n80-6 and 80-7 (Marin and Fresno County policies); Keast Decl. (Exh. 71) ยถ4  e\nr\n \nt\n(noting that Marin County Sheriff allows ICE into the sally port area of the  n\ne\nm\njail to make arrests). This petitionโs use of the term โtransferโ is consistent \nu\nc\no\nwith California law, which defines transfer to ICE as an โagency facilitat[ing] \nD\nthe transfer of an individual in its custody to ICE.โ Govโt Code ยง 7283(g). \n40 \n \n\n \nThe Attorney Generalโs Office has further clarified that any hand-off to ICE, \neven if it occurs in a non-public area of the jail is a transfer.7 \n78.  Transfers to ICE are voluntary. Federal law does not require \nstate or local compliance with ICEโs requests for notification of release dates \nand cooperation in facilitating transfers. United States v. California, 921 F.3d \n865, 887 (9th Cir. 2019) (โneither an administrative warrant issued by federal \nauthorities nor any other provision of law identified by the United States \ncompels any action by a state or local officialโ); Steinle v. City and Cnty. of \nSan Francisco, 919 F.3d 1154, 1164 (9th Cir. 2019) (federal law does not \nprohibit state and local restrictions on providing release date information to \nICE); City and County of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1241 n.7 \n(9th  Cir.  2018).  Rather,  as  California  law  makes  clear,  compliance  is \ndiscretionary. Govโt Code ยง 7282.5 (โA law enforcement official shall have \n.\nt\nr\ndiscretion to cooperate with immigration authorities only if doing so would  u\no\nC\nnot  violate  any  federal,  state,  or  local  law,  or  local  policy,  and  where   \ne\nm\npermitted by the California Values Act.โ).   \ne\nr\np\n79.  California law does not constrain the discretion of the stateโs  u\nS\n \nprisonsโthe  California  Department  of  Corrections  and  Rehabilitation  A\nC\n(โCDCRโ)โto comply with ICEโs requests for transfer of custody. That is,   \ne\nh\nt\nstate law currently permits the CDCR to comply with any ICE transfer   \ny\nb\nrequest. But it does not require it.   d\ne\nv\n80.  California law does, however, constrain the discretion of local \ni\ne\nc\nlaw enforcement. The California Values Act (โValues Actโ), Govโt Code ยง  e\nr\n \nt\n7284,  prohibits  local  law  enforcement  from  transferring  custody  of  n\ne\nm\nindividuals  to  ICE  absent  a  judicial  warrant  or  judicial  probable  cause \nu\nc\no\n  D\n \n7 See Oral Argument at 43:45, U.S. v.

Under  California  law,  a  person  in  local  law  enforcement \ncustody can be transferred to ICE custody only once he or she is eligible for \nrelease from criminal custody because (1) all criminal charges against the \nindividual have been dropped or dismissed, (2) the individual has been \nacquitted of all criminal charges filed against him or her, (3) the individual \nhas served all the time required for his or her sentence, (4) the individual has \n.\nt\nr\nposted a bond, and (5) the individual is otherwise eligible for release under  u\no\nC\nstate or local law, or local policy.

California barred the future operation of Californiaโs for-profit \nimmigration detention centers with the passage of AB 32 in 2019, which \n42 \n \n\n \nwent into effect on January 1, 2020. See Penal Code ยง 9501. When Governor \nNewsom signed AB 32, he stated โDuring my inaugural address, I vowed to \nend private prisons, because they contribute to over-incarceration, including \nthose that incarcerate California inmates and those that detain immigrants \nand asylum seekers. These for-profit prisons do not reflect our values.โ Exh. \n15. Despite Californiaโs firm stance, between the signing of the bill and \nJanuary 1, 2020, ICE renewed the contracts for the four privately-operated \nfacilities for a term of 15 years for the Adelanto, Mesa Verde, and Imperial \nRegional  facilities  and  a  term  of  5  years  for  the  Otay  Mesa  facility, \ngrandfathering in the four existing private detention facilities in the state and \nperpetuating the very conditions of inhumane detention that the state sought \nto eradicate. Exh. 88. See Penal Code ยง 9505.  \n66.  Further, immigration detention is entirely unnecessary, as its \n.\nt\nr\npurpose is to ensure a personโs appearance in their removal proceedings,  u\no\nC\nZadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690 (2001), which can be accomplished   \ne\nm\nthrough other means. As Attorney General Becerra has acknowledged, ICE \ne\nr\np\nhas  the  โdiscretion  to  release  thousands  of  individualsโ  and  there  are  u\nS\n \nsophisticated alternatives to detention, such as supervised release, electronic  A\nC\nankle monitoring, and telephonic monitoring, that are proven to be effective   \ne\nh\nt\nmethods of ensuring a personโs appearance.

In the Attorney Generalโs words, the โpublic health benefits that  e\nr\n \nt\nwill  flow  from  reducing  the  population  of  detained  immigrantsโ  are  n\ne\nm\nparamount to any interest in keeping people detained.

This includes protecting \nthe health and safety of individuals in its custody and not subjecting them to \ndangerous conditions. Yet, Respondents are endangering the lives of every \nperson the state transfers to ICE custody during the COVID-19 pandemic, \nagainst the very interests of the State of California. Petitioners are thus \nentitled to a writ of mandate requiring Respondents to conform their conduct \nto  the  requirements  of  the  United  States  Constitution  and  California \nConstitution. \n2.  Respondents  violate  the  due process  rights  secured  by  the \nFourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution  and  article  1, \nsection 7 of the California Constitution by continuing to transfer individuals \n.\nt\nr\nto ICE custody during the COVID-19 pandemic.   u\no\nC\n3.  This  constitutional  violation  impacts  not  just  the  rights  of   \ne\nm\nimpacted individuals, but the public health at large by continuing to populate \ne\nr\np\nimmigration detention centers that have systematically failed to mitigate the  u\nS\n \nvirusโs spread. As such, it is a matter of urgent and compelling public interest.  A\nC\n4.

To exercise their duties without violating the constitutional \nrights of people incarcerated and detained in Californiaโs state \nprisons and local jails by imposing a moratorium on transfers \nto federal immigration authorities or their agents. โTransfersโ \nshall be defined as any cooperation to facilitate ICE or their \nagents taking custody of an individual for removal proceedings \nwhen they are due for release from criminal custody, including \nproviding notification of release dates, performing a custodial \ntransfer, allowing ICE or their agents into a sally port, booking \narea, or other non-public area of a jail to make arrests, or \notherwise  facilitating  an  ICE  arrest  as  the  person  leaves \n.\nt\nr\ncriminal  custody.  Should  Respondents  wish  to  lift  the  u\no\nC\nmoratorium after such time as COVID-19 is no longer a public   \ne\nm\nhealth  menace,  it  shall  be  incumbent  on  Respondents  to \ne\nr\np\ndemonstrate to the Court that it is safe to resume transfers and  u\nS\n \nthat the Stateโs interest in doing so does not jeopardize the  A\nC\nhealth and safety of transferred individuals or the public at   \ne\nh\nt\nlarge.   \ny\nb\nb.

Those who are \neligible for release  from criminal custodyโwhether due to COVID-19-\nrelated  measures  undertaken  by  the  State,  the  courts,  or  local  law \nenforcement, or otherwiseโshould be released. They should not be handed \ninto dangerous, life-threatening conditions that not only jeopardize their \nlives,  but  also  impede  State  efforts  to  control  and  contain  the  virus. \nImmigration  detention  is  civil  in  nature  and  intended  only  to  secure  a \npersonโs presence at a removal hearing, a goal which can be accomplished \nthrough other means. It is not a death sentence. Continuing  to transfer \nindividuals into these conditions is inhumane, and it violates the Due Process  .\nt\nr\nu\nClause of the U.S. and California Constitutions.     o\nC\nDISCUSSION   e\nm\ne\nr\nI.  Transferring Individuals into ICE Custody During this  p\nu\nPandemic Violates Due Process  S\n \nA\nBy transferring and facilitating the transfer of individuals from its own  C\n \ne\ncustody into ICE custody, the State of California violates the Due Process  h\nt\n \ny\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and article 1,  b\n \nd\nsection  7  of  the  California  Constitution.  During  this  unprecedented  e\nv\ni\ne\npandemic, those parallel provisions prohibit the State from facilitating the  c\ne\nr\ntransfer of any individuals into ICEโs custody during the pandemic, given the   t\nn\ne\nrisk  to  their health  and  safety  and Californiaโs  lack  of  interest  in  their  m\nu\ncontinued detention. At a minimum, they prohibit such facilitation in this  c\no\nD\ncontext, given ICEโs total failure to protect the people in its custody from the \nrisk of deadly infection by COVID-19.  \n \n48 \n \n\n \nA.  The State of California Has an Obligation Not to Place \nIndividuals in its Custody into Danger \nโ[W]hen the State takes a person into its custody and holds him there \nagainst his will, the Constitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to \nassume some responsibility for his safety and general well-being.โ DeShaney \nv. Winnebago Cty. Depโt of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 201 (1989). This \nincludes  ensuring  the  health  and  safety  of  people  in  its  custody.  See \nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 315โ16 (1982); Estelle v. Gamble, 429 \nU.S. 97, 103-04 (1976); Gordon v. Cty of Orange, 888 F.3d 1118, 1124-25 \n(9th Cir. 2018), cert. denied sub nom. Cty of Orange, Cal. v. Gordon, 139 \nS.Ct. 794 (2019).  \nImmigration  detention  is  civil  detention.  Therefore,  the  Stateโs \nobligations to individuals subject to ICE transfer requests are embodied in \n.\nt\nr\nthe  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  U.S.  u\no\nC\nConstitution and article 1, section 7 of the California Constitution, which \n \ne\nm\nwholly  prohibit  conditions  that  amount  to  punishmentโthat  is,  their \ne\nr\np\nconfinement may not be โโexcessive in relation to [its non-punitive purpose]โ \nu\nS\nor โโemployed to achieve objectives that could be accomplished in so many   \nA\nC\nalternative and less harsh methods.โโ Jones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918, 934 (9th   \ne\nh\nCir. 2004). See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 321โ22 (โ[p]ersons who have been  t\n \ny\nb\ninvoluntarily  committed  are  entitled  to  more  considerate  treatment  and   \nd\ne\nconditions of confinement than criminals whose conditions of confinement  v\ni\ne\nc\nare designed to punishโ); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 n.16 (1970)  e\nr\n \nt\n(โDue process requires that a pretrial detainee not be punishedโ); see also  n\ne\nm\nOchoa v. Superior Court, 39 Cal.3d 159, 174 (1985); Inmates of Riverside \nu\nc\nCty. Jail v. Clark, 144 Cal. App. 3d 850, 858-59 (Ct. App. 1983).    o\nD\nWhen the State either creates a danger or by its actions โrender[s] [an \nindividual] any more vulnerable toโ a danger, it has โplaced him in [a] worse \nposition than that in which he would have been had it not acted at all.โ  \n49 \n \n\n \nDeShaney, 489 U.S. at 201. Thus, an individual establishes โa due process \nviolationโ  if  the  State  โplace[d]  [them]  in  danger,โ  and  โact[ed]  with \ndeliberate indifference to [a] known or obvious danger in subjecting [them] \nto [that danger].โ Hernandez v. City of San Jose, 897 F.3d 1125, 1137 (9th \nCir. 2018) (alterations in original). See Kennedy v. City of Ridgefield, 439 \nF.3d 1055, 1062 (9th Cir. 2007); Zelig v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 27 Cal. 4th \n1112, 1149 (2002) (The government violates due process when it โhas taken \nsome affirmative action that places the person in danger.โ).  \nAn individual need not show that the relevant government officials \nare โsubjectively aware that their [actions are] unreasonable,โ only that โa \nreasonable official in the circumstances would have appreciated the high \ndegree of risk involved.โ Gordon v. Cty. of Orange, 888 F.3d 1118, 1123, \n1125 (9th Cir. 2018). This standard requires โmore than negligence but less \n.\nt\nr\nthan subjective intentโsomething akin to reckless disregard.โ Id. at 1125. In  u\no\nC\nsystemic  cases,  such  as  this,  the  key  question  is  whether  systemic   \ne\nm\ndeficiencies โtaken as wholeโ subject people to a โโsubstantial risk of serious \ne\nr\np\nharm.โโ See Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 505 n.3 (2011).  u\nS\n \nFurthermore,  it  is  well-settled  that  a  detaineeโs  constitutional  A\nC\nprotections extend to โfuture harm,โ including a โcondition of confinement   \ne\nh\nt\nthat is sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering the   \ny\nb\nnext week or month or year.โ Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993).   d\ne\nv\nConstitutional violations therefore can arise from โthe exposure of inmates \ni\ne\nc\nto a serious, communicable diseaseโ even if โthe complaining inmate shows  e\nr\n \nt\nno serious current symptomsโ and โeven though the possible infection might  n\ne\nm\nnot affect all those exposed.โ Id.; see also Castillo, 2020 WL 1502864, at *4; \nu\nc\no\nHutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 682โ83, 687 (1978) (risk of exposing inmates \nD\nto communicable diseases such as hepatitis and venereal disease violates the \nEighth Amendment); DeGidio v. Pung, 920 F.2d 525, 527, 533 (8th Cir. \n50 \n \n\n \n1990)  (inadequate  screening  and  control  procedures  in  response  to \ntuberculosis outbreak violated the Eighth Amendment).  \nThus,  when  the  State  of  California  transfers  individuals  into  the \ncustody of ICE, thereby creating a substantial risk that they will be harmed, \nit violates due process. See Doe ex rel. Johnson v. S.C. Depโt of Soc. Servs., \n597 F.3d 163, 175 (4th Cir. 2010) (holding that state agencies may not \ntransfer  individuals  in  its  custody  to  placements  that  are  โdeliberately \nindifferent to [their] right to personal safety and securityโ). This is true \nwhether state agents physically hand over custody by performing an in-\ncustody transfer or allowing ICE into the lock-up of a jail, or simply provide \nan individualโs release date to ICE to enable ICE arrests. Both actions create \na  heightened  risk  to  the  individualโs  health  and  safety.  Cf.  Wood  v. \nOstrander, 879 F.2d 583, 586, 589โ90 (9th Cir. 1989) (where police officer \n.\nt\nr\nstranded the female passenger of a drunk driver on the side of the road in a  u\no\nC\nhigh-crime area at 2:30 a.m., resulting in her being raped, she raised triable   \ne\nm\nissues of fact as to whether the officer had affirmatively placed her in a \ne\nr\np\nposition of danger and acted in callous disregard for her physical security).   u\nS\n \nThe State of Californiaโs transfers to ICE violate due process for two  A\nC\nreasons. First, irrespective of the actual conditions in ICE custody, continued   \ne\nh\nt\nconfinement  undeniably  presents  an  exponentially  greater  threat  of   \ny\nb\ncontracting COVID-19 than release, which is not justified by any legitimate   d\ne\nv\ngovernment purpose during this pandemic. Second, actual conditions in ICE \ni\ne\nc\ncustody present a substantial risk of harm, including death, making transfers  e\nr\n \nt\nduring this time categorically unreasonable.  n\ne\nm\n \nu\nc\no\nD\n51 \n \n\n \nB.  Given the General Danger of Continued Detention During \nthis Pandemic, the State of California Violates Due Process \nby Transferring People to ICE Custody  \nTransferring people into another custodial setting where transfers and \nincarceration are avoidable and not necessary defies CDC guidance and \nmedical consensus. See, e.g., Exh. 26 at 1024. Such transfers place people in \ngrave danger during this pandemic, and therefore violate substantive due \nprocess. It is undeniable that the State of California is placing people in its \ncustody in danger by transferring them to ICE custody, as carceral settings \ngenerally pose a substantially higher risk of COVID-19 infection. Schneberk \nDecl. (Exh. 81) ยถยถ 42โ44. Transferred individuals would be safer if the State \nhad released them from state prison or local jail when they became due for \nrelease, rather than facilitating ICEโs arrest and detention of them. They \n.\nwould be at home, sheltering-in-place, not confined with hundreds of people  t\nr\nu\no\nin crowded detention centers where COVID-19 is already spreading or will  C\n \ne\ninevitably spread. Schneberk Decl. (Exh. 81) ยถยถ 116โ119. That is, the State  m\ne\nof Californiaโs transfers to ICE custody place people โin [a] worse position  r\np\nu\nthan that in which [they] would have been had it not acted at all.โ DeShaney,  S\n \nA\n489 U.S. at 201.  C\n \ne\n  The State of California knows that these transfers are likely to cause  h\nt\n \ny\nharm and carry a high degree of risk of COVID-19 infection and spread, and  b\n \nd\nthus is acting with reckless disregard for the rights of those subject to ICEโs  e\nv\ni\ne\nrequests. CDC guidance explicitly urges the restriction of any transfers of  c\ne\nr\ncustody, unless medically necessary (such as to a hospital) or to prevent   \nt\nn\ne\novercrowding. Exh. 26 at 1024. See Hernandez v. Cty. of Monterey, 110 F.  m\nu\nSupp.  3d  929,  942โ43  (N.D.  Cal.  2015)  (finding  that  jailโs  practices  c\no\nD\nregarding tuberculosis did not conform to CDC standards, and holding that \nโknown noncompliance with generally accepted guidelines for inmate health \nstrongly indicates deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious \n52 \n \n\n \nharmโ).  See  Schneberk  Decl.  (Exh.  81)  ยถ 83  (โFrom  a  public  health \nperspective, ICE detention facilities must adhere rigorously to the CDCโs \nguidance to stop all medically unnecessary transfers.โ); id. at ยถยถ 80โ89.  \nAttorney General Becerra has urged DHS to โ[l]imit the transfer or \ntransport  of  detainees  and  halt  the  introduction  of  new  detainees  to \nimmigration detention facilities.โ Exh. 82 at 1801. However, his letter fails \nto mention that he too bears responsibility for this practice, as the Stateโs \nofficers facilitate ICEโs continuing arrests and bookings into immigration \ndetention facilities. During the pandemic, state prison and local jail transfers \naccount for most of the new ICE bookings into detention centers. See supra \nFacts, Sec. D. The Attorney Generalโs criticism of DHSโs failure to address \nwhat  he  acknowledges  is  a  โCOVID-19-related  catastrophe  in  our \nimmigration detention facilities and surrounding communities,โ shows that \n.\nt\nr\nthe Attorney General is well-aware of the harm that his own law enforcement  u\no\nC\nofficials cause when they facilitate transfers to ICE custody.   \ne\nm\nGovernor Newsom is also well-aware of the need to limit transfers \ne\nr\np\nand  movement  of  inmates  between  correctional  facilities  because  he  u\nS\n \nspecifically suspended new intakes into state prisons from county jails and  A\nC\nother settings, even as he failed to suspend transfers from state prisons to   \ne\nh\nt\nICE. See Exh. 89 (Executive Order). And, due to significant advocacy, he is   \ny\nb\nwell-aware of conditions in ICE detention and the Stateโs continuing role in   d\ne\nv\nthat by facilitating transfers. See supra Facts, Sec. C. Yet, he too has failed \ni\ne\nc\nto stop the transfers.  e\nr\n \nt\n Further, there is no legitimate, non-punitive reason for the State to  n\ne\nm\ncontinue these transfers during the pandemic. First, transfers to ICE are \nu\nc\no\nentirely  discretionaryโno  law  requires  the  State  to  comply  with  such \nD\nrequests, nor could it. United States v. California, 921 F.3d 865, 889 (9th Cir. \n2019) (holding that โ[f]ederal law provides states and localities the option, \nnot the requirement, of assisting federal immigration authoritiesโ and noting \n53 \n \n\n \nthat, under the Tenth Amendment, Congress could not force states to comply \nwith transfer requests).  \nSecond, neither the State of California nor the federal government \nhave any legitimate interest in keeping people in immigration custody during \nthe  pandemic.  For  California,  continuing  these  transfers  only  further \ncontributes to the ongoing public health crisis in the state by keeping people \nincarcerated when they should be released, fueling the spread of COVID-19 \nin Californiaโs immigration detention centers and surrounding communities, \nand burdening already underprepared county and state health care resources. \nSchneberk Decl. (Exh. 81) ยถ 112 (โCarceral facilities are critical parts of \nCaliforniaโs broader public health infrastructure.

Furthermore,  u\no\nC\nCalifornia  has  already  firmly  and  boldly  rejected  private  immigration   \ne\nm\ndetention  in  the  state,  which  accounts  for  four  of  the  five  existing \ne\nr\np\nimmigration detention centers.

See Hernandez Roman v. Wolf, 20-cv-00768-TJH, ECF 53, 14โ\nD\n15 (C.D. Cal.

Davis, \n533  U.S.  678,  699  (2001).  But  such  justifications  cannot  support \nincarceration during a pandemic when nearly everyone is required to practice \nsocial  distancing  to  safeguard  their  lives,  and  when  ICE  has  ample \nalternatives to detention that have proven capable of ensuring that individuals \nappear for their proceedings. See supra Facts, Sec.

As the District Court for   \ne\nm\nCentral  District  of  California  aptly  put  it  just  days  ago,  in  granting  a \ne\nr\np\npreliminary injunction against ICE due to its nationwide failure to safeguard  u\nS\n \ndetainees against COVID-19:   A\nC\n \n[A]ttendance at hearings cannot be secured reliably when the detainee  e\nh\nhas, is at risk of having, or is at risk of infecting court staff with a  t \ny\ndeadly  infectious  disease  with  no  known  cure.  Participation  in  b\n \nd\nimmigration proceedings is not possible for those who are sick or \ne\nv\ndying, and is impossible for those who are dead. Another purpose of \ni\ne\ndetention, public safety, is not advanced by delay. Plaintiffs establish  c\ne\nthat  public  safety  as  a  whole  is  seriously  diminished  by  facility  r\n \nt\noutbreaks, which further tax community health resources.    n\ne\nm\n \nu\nFraihat  v.

DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 201. \nIt is creating this danger in spite of Californiaโs admitted lack of interest in \nfurthering ICE detention. See Jones, 393 F.3d at 931 (conditions of civil \n.\nt\nr\nconfinement must always remain โreasonable [in] relation to the purposeโ of  u\no\nC\nconfinement); Bell, 441 U.S. at 539 (โ[I]f a restriction or condition is not   \ne\nm\nreasonably related to a legitimate goalโif it is arbitrary or purposelessโa \ne\nr\np\ncourt permissibly may infer that the purpose of governmental action is  u\nS\n \npunishment that may not constitutionally be inflicted.โ).

Exh. 82 at 1798-1801.   \nFederal courts in California have also now repeatedly held that ICEโs \nfailure to protect people in its California detention centers from COVID-19 \nconstitutes reckless disregard for their safety. Judge Hatter of the District \nCourt  for  the  Central  District  of  California  has  now  ordered  ICE  to \nimmediately depopulate the Adelanto detention center to allow for social \n.\nt\nr\ndistancing.

All five \nfacilities remain crowded, making social distancing impossible. ICE has \nfailed to release people and prioritize depopulation of the facilities, while \ncontinuing to make new arrests and book people into custody, mainly from \nCalifornia state and county transfers.

Respondents Have Breached Their Constitutional Duty to \nProtect the Lives of People in State and Local Custody \n  Respondents have breached their ministerial duty to uphold the due \nprocess rights of people in state and local custody. As this Court has held, \nโ[m]andamus is . . . appropriate for challenging the constitutionality or \nvalidity of statutes or official acts.โ Jolicoeur v. Mihaly, 5 Cal. 3d 565, 570 \nn. 2 (1971). When an officialโs conduct violates rights guaranteed by the U.S. \nor California constitutions, mandamus is available to compel the official to \ntake corrective action. Id.; see also Edward W. v. Lamkins, 99 Cal. App. 4th \n516, 529 (2002) (writ of mandate appropriate if โrespondentโs practices \nviolate  the  constitutional  guarantees  of  due  processโ);  Stone  v.

S\n \nA\n  While officials have discretion in how they perform certain public  C\n \ne\nduties, no official has discretion to violate the constitution. When an official  h\nt\n \ny\nviolates rights secured by the constitution, the official has breached a non-\nb\n \nd\ndiscretionary duty, warranting mandamus relief. See Molar v. Gates, 98 Cal.  e\nv\ni\nApp. 3d 1, 25 (1979) (โPlaintiff has a clear right to the enjoyment of the equal  e\nc\ne\nprotection of the laws and defendants have a clear duty to respect that right.  r \nt\nn\nAccordingly,  mandamus  is  an  appropriate  remedy  to  enforce  plaintiffโs  e\nm\nu\nconstitutional right to equal protection.โ); De La Mar v.

Both directly \noversee Californiaโs county jails and Governor Newsom oversees the Stateโs \nprisons, and both owe a constitutional duty to ensure that people held in those \nfacilities  are  not  voluntarily  transferred  into  ICE  custody  during  this \npandemic in violation of constitutional due process rights.  \nGovernor Newsomโs duty to ensure public health of individuals in \nstate and local custody flows from his emergency declaration. On March 4, \n2020, Governor Newsom declared a state of emergency concerning the viral \noutbreak, triggering provisions of the Emergency Services Act. See Exh. 19. \nThe Emergency Services Act โconfers broad powers on the Governor to deal \nwith [declared] emergencies.โ Macias v.

Governor  Newsom  has  A\nC\ncomplete authority over CDCR under his emergency powers. Govโt Code ยง   \ne\nh\nt\n8672. As such, the Governor has a duty to protect the health and safety of   \ny\nb\nindividuals  in  CDCR  custody  by  halting  transfers  to  ICE  custody.  The   d\ne\nv\nGovernor has already taken some steps to address the pandemic in CDCR \ni\ne\nc\nfacilities. See Exh. 89 (Executive Order on State Prisons).  e\nr\n \nt\nThe Governor also has the emergency authority to halt transfers to  n\ne\nm\nICE from local law enforcement agencies to protect lives and address the \nu\nc\no\npublic  health  crisis.  In  issuing  his  state  of  emergency  declaration,  the \nD\nGovernor expressly found that โlocal authority is inadequate to cope with the \nthreat posed by COVID-19,โ necessitating a unified, statewide response. \nNewsom March 4, 2020 Executive Order. This is particularly critical here \n62 \n \n\n \nwhere a uniform response to halt transfers is required to address the public \nhealth calamity unfolding in Californiaโs immigration detention centers, in \nthe face of federal inaction, and to protect lives. \nThe Governor has the power to suspend laws and regulations that \nhinder or delay the stateโs emergency response. Govโt. Code ยง 8571. In \naddition, the Emergency Services Act expressly permits the release of people \nwho are incarcerated when, as here, emergency circumstances โendanger the \nlives of inmates of a state, county, or city penal or correctional institution.โ \nGovโt  Code  ยง 8658;  see  also  Cal.

See Dibb v. Cty. of \nSan Diego, 8 Cal. 4th 1200, 1210 (1994). He also has the obligation to ensure \nthat โthe laws of the State are uniformly and adequately enforced.โ Cal. \nConst. art.

State and local \ntransfers  to  ICE  custody unequivocally  affects  the  health  and  safety  of \nPetitionersโ  clients.  Emerick  Decl.  (Exh.  83)  ยถ8  (โCOVID-19  poses  an \nextremely serious threat to many of our detained clients. Their continued \ncustody in crowded and unhygienic Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n(โICEโ) detention facilities threatens their health  and safety and deeply \naffects their mental health.โ); Munkelt Decl. (Exh. 46) ยถ4 (โOur members are \nincredibly concerned about the current coronavirus pandemic and its effect \n.\nt\nr\non our clients, not only for their rights in the criminal court process and the  u\no\nC\neffects on our ability to advocate on their behalf, but also for their health and   \ne\nm\nsafety given the direct risks of infection and difficulty getting appropriate \ne\nr\np\nmedical  treatment.โ).  This  risk  to  petitionersโ  clients  give  petitioners  a  u\nS\n \nconcrete interest โover and above the interest held in common with the public  A\nC\nat large.โ Plastic Bag Coal., 52 Cal. 4th at 170 (holding that association of   \ne\nh\nt\nplastic bag manufacturers had beneficial interest in challenging ordinance   \ny\nb\nbanning plastic bags because ordinance would harm membersโ business in   d\ne\nv\nthe city); Associated Builders & Contractors, Inc. v.

When, as here, โthe question is one \nof public right and the object of mandamus is to procure the enforcement of \n65 \n \n\n \na public duty,โ any member of the public can seek public interest standing \nโsince it is sufficient that he is interested as a citizen in having the laws \nexecuted and the duty in question enforced.โ Plastic Bag Coal., 52 Cal. 4th \nat 166 (quoting Bd. of Soc. Welfare v. Los Angeles Cty., 27 Cal. 2d 98, 100โ\n01 (1945)).  \nIn evaluating whether a petitioner has public interest standing, courts \nweigh the public interest in ensuring that the government performs its duties \nagainst any โcompeting considerations of a more urgent nature.โ Green v. \nObledo, 29 Cal. 3d 126, 145 (1981). When there is a โmanifest public \ninterestโ  in  ensuring  that  respondentsโ  conduct  conforms  to  legal \nrequirements,  and  no  โurgent  considerations  .  .  .  outweighโ  that  public \ninterest,  public  interest  standing  is  available.  Hector  F.  v.  El  Centro \nElementary Sch. Dist., 227 Cal. App. 4th 331, 341-42 (2014); see Reynolds \n.\nt\nr\nv. City of Calistoga, 223 Cal. App. 4th 865, 875 (2014) (โโWhen the duty is  u\no\nC\nsharp and the public need weighty, the courts will grant a mandamus at the   \ne\nm\nbehest of an applicant who shows no greater personal interest than that of a \ne\nr\np\ncitizen who wants the law enforced.โโ).  u\nS\n \nHere, the public has a manifest interest in ensuring that respondents  A\nC\ndo not subject people in government custody to intolerable risks of COVID-  \ne\nh\nt\n19 infection in violation of their constitutional rights. See In re Head, 42 Cal.   \ny\nb\n3d 223, 230 (1986) (public policies served by the constitutional and statutory   d\ne\nv\nrights of incarcerated people are frequently โof interest not only to the prison \ni\ne\nc\ninmates themselves, but the public in general.โ); In re Brindle, 91 Cal. App.  e\nr\n \nt\n3d 660, 670 (1979) (explaining that โthe supervision of the administration of  n\ne\nm\ncriminal justiceโ raises โquestions of general public concernโ); see also \nu\nc\no\nDepโt of Corr. v.

Infections in ICE detention among people \ntransferred  there  by  the  State  of  California  are  altogether  avoidableโ\ntransfers are discretionary and there is no legitimate government interest in \nimmigration detention at this moment given the threat to human health. \nFurther, because ICE detention centers are not sealed off from the rest of the \ncommunityโstaff and contractors enter and leave every day, new arrestees \narrive daily, and others are releasedโany outbreak that begins in a detention \ncenter will spread to the broader community. Additionally, once people \ncontract COVID-19 in ICE detention centers and become seriously ill, they \nwill need to be treated in community healthcare facilities. This will further \nstrain the resources of hospitals statewide, during the most significant global \npandemic in generations. Schneberk Decl. (Exh. 81) ยถยถ 99โ112. The public \n.\nt\nr\nhas a strong interest in preventing these harms, which impact the health of  u\no\nC\nall Californians.8   \ne\nm\nFurther support for public interest standing comes from the structural \ne\nr\np\nchallenges that individual people who are incarcerated face in vindicating  u\nS\n \ntheir constitutional rights. โIn determining whether a petitioner has public  A\nC\ninterest standing, the court . . . considers the burden on those who have a   \ne\nh\nt\nbeneficial  interest,  and  would  have  general  standing,  but  who  may  be   \ny\nb\ndisinclined or ill-equipped to seek review.โ Weiss v. City of Los Angeles, 2   d\ne\nv\nCal. App. 5th 194, 205 (2016). Even if every individual in custody had the \ni\ne\nc\nresources and ability to file a lawsuit seeking protection from these infection  e\nr\n \nt\nn\n  e\nm\n \nu\n8 Courts have previously found public interest standing when the harms  c\no\nhave a similarly broad impact. See Plastic Bag Coal., 52 Cal. 4th at 170  D\n(finding public interest in โthe preparation of an environmental impact \nreportโ); Bd. of Soc. Welfare v. Los Angeles Cty., 27 Cal. 2d 98, 101 (1945) \n(โ[T]he provision of public aid to the needy aged is a matter of state-wide \nconcern.โ). \n67 \n \n\n \nrisks, such piecemeal litigation would be inefficient and inadequate to the \ncrisis at handโespecially as COVID-19 limits the capacity of courts around \nthe  state.  Given  the  pace  at  which  the  pandemic  is  unfolding,  and  the \nincreased risks of exposure in each county and with each passing day, public \ninterest litigation is necessary. \nC.  Petitioners have no Adequate Administrative Remedy  \nMandamus is appropriate only if the petitioner has no โplain, speedy, \nand  adequate  remedy.โ Civ.  Proc.  Code  ยง  1086.  Courts  do  not  require \nexhaustion of administrative remedies where โirreparable harm will result if \njudicial  intervention  is  withheld  until  a  final  administrative  decision  is \nrendered.โ Alta Loma Sch. Dist. v. San Bernardino Cty. Commโn on Sch. \nDist. Reorganization, 124 Cal. App. 3d 542, 555 (1981); see Ogo Assocs. v. \n.\nt\nr\nu\nCity of Torrance, 37 Cal. App. 3d 830, 834 (1974). Here, the rapid spread of \no\nC\nCOVID-19 and inherent susceptibility of ICE detention centers to viral   \ne\nm\noutbreak create a grave risk of infection for everyone inside, and it only  e\nr\np\nincreases with each passing day of inaction.  u\nS\n \nUnder these circumstances, it is simply impracticable for thousands  A\nC\nof  incarcerated  people  facing  transfer  to  ICE  to  pursue  relief  through   e\nh\nt\nadministrative  channels.9  By  the  time  each  incarcerated  person  has  an   \ny\nb\nopportunity to be heard, the statewide situation will have worsened and many   d\ne\nv\ni\ne\nc\n  e\nr\n   t\nn\n9 Although some form of administrative remedy process may be available  e\nm\nin various correctional facilities, it is neither speedy enough nor sufficient. \nu\nThese administrative remedy processes are typically designed to address  c\no\nroutine individualized grievances, such as to request that a facility  D\ninvestigate a discrete incident of mistreatment or unprofessional behavior \nby staff, request changes to housing or security classifications, or correct an \nerror in the facilityโs recordsโnot to address urgent, systemwide changes \nlike those addressed in this petition.  \n68 \n \n\n \nof those pursuing administrative relief may already have become infected or \neven  critically  ill. Courts  have excused  failure  to  exhaust  on  far lesser \nshowings of urgent need. See Depโt of Pers. Admin. v. Superior Court, 5 Cal. \nApp.  4th  155,  170-72  (1992)  (entertaining  mandamus  petition  seeking \nwithout exhaustion to invalidate statute that cut employee compensation \nduring  a  financial  crisis  because,  among  other  things,  delaying  judicial \nreview could result in unnecessary layoffs and cuts to public services). \nNor have courts required exhaustion when the public interest demands \njudicial resolution. See Hull v. Cason, 114 Cal. App. 3d 344, 358 (1981). As \ndiscussed  above,  preventing  the  spread  of  COVID-19  in  correctional \nfacilities is a matter of compelling, statewide public interest. Absent judicial \nintervention, the stateโs correctional facilities are likely to become hotspots \nof infection, threatening public health and undermining the stateโs efforts to \n.\nt\nr\nlimit spread of this highly contagious disease. This has already occurred in  u\no\nC\nother states, and it underscores the need for immediate judicial review. See   \ne\nm\nid.  at  358  (declining  to  apply  exhaustion  requirement  when  โprompt \ne\nr\np\ndetermination [was] not only in the public interest, but it would also end what  u\nS\n \nmust be grave uncertainty in the lives and careers of the many persons . . .  A\nC\nwho [would] be affected by its outcomeโ); see also Lindeleaf v. Agric. Labor   \ne\nh\nt\nRelations Bd., 41 Cal. 3d 861, 870โ71 (1986) (hearing challenge to Labor   \ny\nb\nBoard protocols despite failure to exhaust when refusal to address challenge   d\ne\nv\nwould affect not only the parties involved in current litigation, but also the \ni\ne\nc\nparties to other nonfinal Board decisions).  e\nr\n \nt\nFor all of these reasons, the Court should decline to enforce the  n\ne\nm\nexhaustion requirement and resolve this petition on its merits. The petition \nu\nc\no\nraises important constitutional issues that โaffect not only the present parties, \nD\nbut alsoโ every person who is incarcerated in California, everyone who lives \nin the surrounding communities, and California residents at large. Lindleaf, \n69 \n \n\n \n41 Cal. 3d at 870. Time is short, and there is an urgent need for remedial \naction. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Petitioner respectfully requests that this \nCourt grant the relief sought in the Petition for Writ of Mandate. \n \nDATED:  April 24, 2020  Respectfully submitted, \n \nACLU FOUNDATION OF \nSOUTHERN CALIFORNIA \n \n \n \n  By:  /s/ Jennifer Pasquarella \n  Jennifer Pasquarella  .\nt\nr\nAttorneys for Petitioners  u\no\n  C\n \ne\nm\ne\nr\np\nu\nS\n \nA\nC\n \ne\nh\nt\n \ny\nb\n \nd\ne\nv\ni\ne\nc\ne\nr\n \nt\nn\ne\nm\nu\nc\no\nD\n70 \n \n\nCERTIFICATE OF WORD COUNT \n \n  I, the undersigned counsel for Petitioners, relying on the word count \nfunction of Microsoft Word, the computer program used to prepare this \ndocument, certify that the foregoing Petition and Memorandum of Points \nand Authorities contain 19,039 words, excluding the words in the sections \nthat the California Rules of Court 8.204(c)(3) and 8.486(a)(6) instruct \ncounsel to exclude.

      "text": "SUPREME COURT \nFILED \nMAY  1 3 2020 \nJorge Navarrete Clerk \nS261829  Deputy \nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA \nEn Bane \nCALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE et al., Petitioners, \nv. \nGAVIN NEWSOM, as Governor, etc., Respondent; \nXAVIER BECERRA, as Attorney General, etc., Respondent. \nThis mandate proceeding, like others that have recently come before this court, raises \nurgent questions concerning the responsibility of state authorities during the current pandemic to \nprotect the health and safety of inmates under their supervision and control in light of the spread \nof the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.  The current proceeding arises from \nrespondents' role in the transfer of noncitizen state prisoners and county jail inmates to federal \nimmigration authorities, which may lead to detention in facilities that, according to the petition, \ndo not follow safe practices or otherwise take reasonable steps to prevent transmission of the \nv1rus. \nOn March 23, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance \nobserving that conditions in correctional and detention facilities present \"unique challenges for \ncontrol ofCOVID-19 transmission among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, and visitors.\" \n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus \nDisease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities (Mar. 23, 2020) p. 2.) \nPetitioners contend that respondents, the Governor and the Attorney General, have violated their \nconstitutional rights by failing to take action to prevent state and local authorities with custody \nover noncitizen inmates from facilitating their transfer to federal immigration authorities, which \nmay lead to detention in one of five federal immigration detention facilities in California with \nknowledge of or reckless indifference to the risk that detention in these facilities will cause \nthem, facility employees, and members of the surrounding communities to become infected with \nthe novel coronavirus.  Petitioners allege, with supporting declarations, that these facilities do \nnot practice appropriate social distancing, do not maintain sanitary conditions in dorms and \ncommon areas, do not provide adequate medical care to inmates with possible symptoms of \n1 \n\ninfection, and do not provide inmates with masks or supplies for basic hygiene, such as soap or \nhand sanitizer.  Petitioners further allege that state authorities are aware of the dangerous \nconditions at these detention facilities but nonetheless failed to take action to prevent the transfer \nof noncitizen inmates to these facilities.  Petitioners contend that respondents' conduct violates \ntheir right to due process.  Respondents contend that the duty to remedy any violations rests with \nfederal officials in charge of the detention facilities, that pending federal litigation provides an \nadequate alternative remedy, and that petitioners have failed to identify any clear ministerial \nduty that could be remedied by issuance of a writ of mandate.  They note, among other things, \nthat California law provides that local law enforcement officials have discretion to cooperate \nwith federal immigration authorities \"only\" where permitted by the California Values Act (Gov. \nCode, ยง 7284 et seq.) and \"if doing so would not violate any federal, state, or local law, or local \npolicy.\"  (!d., ยง 7282.5, subd. (a).)  Outside of these limitations, respondents argue, the law \npreserves substantial discretion for state and local custodial officials to consider multiple factors \nin determining whether to provide assistance to federal immigration authorities in any particular \ncase. \nThe petition establishes no clear and mandatory duty on the part of the Governor and the \nAttorney General to take the requested action.  The petition for writ of mandate is therefore \ndenied.  The denial is, however, without prejudice to the institution of any action for writ of \nmandate or prohibition against responsible authorities with respect to conduct that may \nunnecessarily expose inmates in their custody to significant risks to their health and safety. \nSuch claims may be brought in the superior courts of appropriate counties. \nFor any such filing, the superior court should be mindful of a range of procedural tools to \nachieve prompt and effective resolution of the matter.  Those tools include the authority to: \n- join all parties necessary for full inquiry into the issues raised and for \ndevelopment and implementation of any appropriate relief (Code Civ. Proc., \nยง 389, subd. (a)); \nconsolidate the action with any similar actions pending in the court, in the \ninterest of efficiency and in light of public health concerns (Code Civ. Proc., \nยง 1048, subd. (a)); \ntransfer and consolidate matters across counties upon a motion by any party \nwhen such transfer and consolidation would promote efficient utilization of \njudicial resources and otherwise satisfy applicable standards (Code Civ. Proc., \nยงยง 403, 404.1); \nassign a single bench officer or appoint one or more referees or special masters \nto bring swift and focused attention to the issues raised (Cal. Rules of Court, \nrule 3.734; Code Civ. Proc., ยงยง 638, 639); \n2 \n\nfacilitate discussion among all parties to achieve a negotiated resolution that is \nresponsive to local conditions and avoids protracted litigation; \norder interim relief, as appropriate, during the pendency of the action; and \ngive the matter expedited consideration for evidentiary hearings, briefing, and \nany joint discussions for resolution. \nIn all such matters, the superior court is to proceed as expeditiously as possible and to be \nmindful that conditions associated with COVID-19 in detention facilities and local communities \nare continually evolving.  Given the dynamic nature of the pandemic, yet cognizant of the \nongoing federal litigation targeting alleged deficiencies at immigration detention facilities, the \ndenial of the petition is without prejudice to the filing of a new petition in this court raising \nsimilar claims if circumstances warrant. \nThe request for judicial notice is granted as to exhibits 19, 25, 82, and 89. \nThe request for judicial notice regarding \"government records\" is granted as to exhibits 1, \n2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 15 through 18, 39, 41, 52-1,54-1,54-4,66,68,76,79,80-1, 80-2, 80-3, 80-\n4, 80-5, 80-6, 80-7, 80-9, 80-10, and 88.  Judicial notice is granted only concerning the \nexistence, but not the accuracy, of factual allegations or findings made in these documents. \nThe request for judicial notice regarding \"court filings\" is granted as to exhibits 27, 29, \n30, 31, 37, 42, 50,52-2,61,90 through 94.  Judicial notice is granted only concerning the \nexistence, but not the accuracy, of factual allegations or findings made in these documents. \nThe request for judicial notice regarding various newspaper articles is granted as to \nexhibits 10, 20, 21, 24, 28, 33, 35, 36, 40, 43, 44, 47, 48, 49, 62, 84, and 86.  Judicial notice of \nthese materials is granted concerning only the fact that these materials were published and not \nconcerning the factual statements contained therein. \nCANTIL-SAKAUYE \nChiefJ ustice \nDISSENTING STATEMENT \nBYLIU, J. \nPetitioners in this mandamus proceeding allege that respondents, the Governor and \nthe Attorney General, have acted with deliberate indifference to the health and safety of \nCalifornia's prison and jail inmates by allowing the ongoing transfer of inmates to federal \n3 \n\nimmigration detention facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.  According to \npetitioners, these facilities have unsanitary conditions, do not allow for social distancing, \nand lack resources to treat infected inmates who become seriously ill.  Petitioners seek a \nwrit of mandate ordering respondents to impose a moratorium on all such transfers. \nArticle VI, section 10 of the California Constitution grants this court original \njurisdiction in mandamus.  As a prudential matter, we exercise such jurisdiction \"only in \ncases in which 'the issues presented are of great public importance and must be resolved \npromptly.' \"  (San Francisco Unified School Dist. v. Johnson (1971) 3 Cal. 3d 937, 944.) \nIf there is any case where exercising our mandamus jurisdiction is appropriate, this is it. \nThe petition alleges time-sensitive, critical health concerns on behalf of persons in state \nand local custody, and raises legal issues of obvious statewide importance.  Since we \nreceived this petition on April24, 2020, a detainee at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in \nSan Diego County became the first person in federal immigration custody to die of \nCOVID-19 complications.  (Santana & Shoichet, First ICE detainee dies from \ncoronavirus (May 6, 2020) CNN.)  If petitioners' allegations are true, more deaths will \nsurely follow.  We should retain this matter, issue an order to show cause, appoint a \nfactfinder if necessary, and promptly resolve the issues presented. \nThe 1,900 pages of exhibits and declarations accompanying the petition include \ndetailed documentation of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement's \n(ICE) failures in providing basic protections against COVID-19 at its five detention \nfacilities in California.  Petitioners allege that social distancing, which is critical to \npreventing the spread of COVID-19, is impossible given the physical confines of the \nfacilities and the number of individuals detained in them.  According to petitioners, the \nfacilities house dozens of detainees in a single dormitory-style unit with bunk beds no \nmore than one meter apart.  Detainees are often required to be in close proximity with \none another as they share dining areas, bathrooms, recreational spaces, and medical units. \nMoreover, petitioners allege that ICE has taken no meaningful action to reduce its \ndetention center populations and continues to defy the guidance of federal health \nauthorities.  (See U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Interim Guidance \non Management ofCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and \nDetention Facilities (Mar. 23, 2020) (CDC Guidance).)  In multiple facilities, detainees \nhave no regular access to gloves, masks, hand sanitizer, or even soap.  At the Otay Mesa \nDetention Center, petitioners allege, officials withheld facemasks from detainees unless \nthey signed a waiver releasing the officials from responsibility if they contracted COVID-\n19.  Many who have experienced COVID-19 symptoms have not been treated. \nMeanwhile, ICE continues to book new detainees into custody and to transfer detainees \nbetween detention centers without recommended quarantine procedures or protocols to \nscreen detainees and staff for symptoms ofCOVID-19. \nRespondents acknowledge that these allegations are \"serious and alarming.\"  In \nfact, they have raised the same concerns themselves.  In an April 13, 2020 letter to the \n4 \n\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Attorney General urged the agency to \nrelease detainees who pose no risk to public safety and to \"halt the introduction of new \ndetainees to immigration detention facilities\" in California.  (Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra, \nletter to Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad F. Wolf, April13, 2020, p. 4 \n(Attorney General Letter).)  Based on \"comprehensive reviews\" of these facilities, the \nAttorney General \"encountered many individuals whose medical conditions place them at \na higher risk for developing serious illness from COVID-19.\"  (!d.  at p.  L)  In the words \nof the Attorney General:  \"I am aware that the physical plants, custody and staffing \npatterns, and health care systems in immigration detention do not allow for social \ndistancing practices and that additional practices such as improved sanitation, screening, \nand halting the admission of new detainees are needed to prevent transmission of the \nvirus.  Further, the facilities in question in California do not appear to have the healthcare \nresources required to treat infected detainees who become seriously ill.  Failure to use \nyour discretion to decrease the detainee population as much as possible and improve \nsanitation and COVID-19 screening practices for those detainees that remain will not \nonly harm civil immigration detainees, but will overwhelm community hospitals to which \nthose detainees will necessarily be transferred for treatment. . . . Urgent action is \nrequired to prevent our country's immigration detention system from causing countless \nunnecessary deaths.\"  (Ibid.) \nAnd yet, according to petitioners, state and local officials continue to notify ICE of \ninmate release dates and to facilitate the transfer of inmates to ICE from state prisons and \ncounty jails, populating the very detention centers that the Attorney General has called on \nICE to depopulate.  By some evidence, California's prisons and jails have become the \nprimary source of new detainees to some ofthese facilities-in California, as ICE has \nlimited the intake of detainees from other sources during the pandemic.  These transfers \ncontinue, petitioners allege, even as the CDC has specifically urged the \"restrict[ ion of] \ntransfers of incarcerated/detained persons to and from other jurisdictions and facilities \nunless necessary for medical evaluation, medical isolation/quarantine, clinical care, \nextenuating security concerns, or to prevent overcrowding.\"  (CDC Guidance, supra, at \np. 9.) \nA writ of mandate may be issued \"by any court to any inferior tribunal, \ncorporation, board, or person, to compel the performance of an act which the law \nspecially enjoins, as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station.\"  (Code Civ. Proc., \nยง 1085.)  Respondents' primary argument is that a writ of mandate cannot issue to control \nthe Governor's or the Attorney General's exercise of discretion in a particular manner. \nThey contend that petitioners have identified no ministerial duty on the part of the \nGovernor or Attorney General to impose a moratorium on the transfer of California \ninmates to federal immigration detention centers.  Today's order denies the petition based \non an assertion that \"[t]he petition establishes no clear and mandatory duty on the part of \nthe Governor and the Attorney General to take the requested action.\" \n5 \n\nBut that assertion does not address the crux of petitioners' claim or the scope of \nthis court's mandamus authority.  It is true that a writ of mandate will \"usually\" issue to \ncompel an official to perform a ministerial duty.  (Santa Clara County Counsel Attys. \nAssn. v.  Woodside (1994) 7 Cal.4th 525, 539-540.)  And I agree that the relief petitioners \nseek is likely not grounded in any ministerial duty, meaning \"an obligation to perform a \nspecific act in a manner prescribed by law whenever a given state of facts exists, without \nregard to any personal judgment as to the propriety ofthe act.\"  (People v. Picklesimer \n(2010) 48 Ca1.4th 330, 340.)  But that is not the limit of our mandamus authority.  We \nmay also issue the writ \"to compel a public agency's performance or correct an agency's \nabuse of discretion whether the action being compelled or corrected can itself be \ncharacterized as 'ministerial' or 'legislative.' \"  (Woodside, at p. 540; see Common Cause \nv. Board ofS upervisors (1989) 49 Ca1.3d 432, 442 (Common Cause) [\"[M]andamus will \nlie to correct an abuse of discretion by an official acting in an administrative capacity.\"]; \nLandsborough v. Kelly (1934) 1 Ca1.2d 739, 744; Inglin v. Hoppin (1909) 156 Cal. 483, \n491; see also 8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (5th ed. 2020) Writsยง 95, [use of mandamus to \ncontrol abuse of discretion].)  On numerous occasions, this court and the Courts of \nAppeal have found it appropriate to issue a writ of mandate to control abuses of \ndiscretion by public officials.  (See e.g., Clean Air Constituency v. Cal. State Air \nResources Bd. (1974) 11 Cal.3d 801, 819; In re Veterans' Industries, Inc. (1970) 8 \nCal.App.3d 902, 925-927; Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corp. v. Superior Court (1962) 208 \nCal.App.2d 803, 824; Munns v. Stenman (1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 543, 551.) \nMoreover, we have signaled that official acts or omissions in violation of \nconstitutional limits will constitute an abuse of discretion.  For example, in Wilson v. Eu \n(1991) 54 Cal.3d 471 (Eu), this court exercised its original jurisdiction to issue an \nalternative writ of mandate appointing three special masters to hold hearings and \nrecommend a reapportionment plan to the court if the Governor and Legislature failed to \nresolve their impasse and enact a plan in time for the 1992 election.  (Id. at pp. 473-475.) \nWe found it appropriate to issue the writ to \" ' \"[e  ]nsure the electorate equal protection of \nthe laws.\"'\" (ld. at p. 473; see Jolicoeur v. Mihaly (1971) 5 Ca1.3d 565, 570, fn. 2 \n[\"Mandamus is ... appropriate for challenging the constitutionality or validity of statutes \nor official acts.\"].)  Our decision implied that the Governor's and Legislature's failure to \nenact a reapportionment plan would constitute an abuse of discretion by denying \nCalifornians their constitutional right to equal representation.  (Eu, at p. 4 73.) \nThe relevant question, therefore, is not whether the Governor and Attorney \nGeneral have a ministerial duty to order a moratorium on ICE transfers.  It is whether the \nGovernor and Attorney General have abused their discretionary authority over California \nprisons and jails by demonstrating deliberate indifference to the health and safety of \ninmates in allowing their continued transfer to ICE detention centers. \nThe due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution prohibits state officials from acting with deliberate indifference to a detained \n6 \n\nindividual's health and safety.  (Lemire v.  Cal. Dept. of Corrections and Rehabilitation \n(9th Cir. 2013) 726 F.3d 1062, 1075; see Farmer v. Brennan (1994) 511 U.S. 825, 843 \n(Farmer) [Eighth Amendment is violated when \"prison officials, acting with deliberate \nindifference, expose[] a prisoner to a sufficiently substantial 'risk of serious damage to \nhis future health'\"]; Castro v. County ofL  os Angeles (9th Cir. 2016) 833 F.3d 1060, \n1067 [due process rights of civil detainees are at least as great as Eighth Amendment \nrights of prisoners].)  State officials can be liable for deliberate indifference ifthey place \nor leave an individual \" 'in a situation that was more dangerous than the one in which \nthey found him.'\"  (Kennedy v.  City ofR  idgefield (9th Cir. 2006) 439 F.3d 1055, 1062, \nquoting Munger v.  City of Glasgow Police Dept. (9th Cir. 2000) 227 FJd 1082, 1086.) \nPlacing an individual who is under the government's control into objectively unsafe \nconditions created by a third party constitutes deliberate indifference to the individual's \nhealth and safety.  (See Hernandez v. City ofS an Jose (9th Cir. 2018) 897 FJd 1125, \n113 8 [police action \"shepherd[ing] [people] into a violent crowd of protesters\" and \nblocking off other exits is sufficient to establish deliberate indifference]; Doe ex rel. \nJohnson v. S.C. Dept. ofS oc. Services (4th Cir. 2010) 597 F.3d 163, 175 [due process \nprohibits state agency from \"mak[ing] a foster care placement that is deliberately \nindifferent to the child's right to personal safety and security\"]; Cortes-Quinones v. \nJimenez-Nettleship (1st Cir. 1988) 842 F.2d 556, 560 (opn. of Breyer, J.) [prison official \nacted with deliberate indifference to inmate's safety under Eighth Amendment when he \ntransferred a mentally ill inmate to a crowded jail that was known for violence].)  And an \nofficial may be held liable for acquiescing to the constitutional violations of those over \nwhom the official has supervisory control.  (See Starr v. Baca (9th Cir. 2011) 652 F.3d \n1202, 1208 [sheriff could be held liable for knowing acquiescence to the unconstitutional \nprison policies and customs of the county]; Dubner v.  City & County ofS an Francisco \n(9th Cir. 2001) 266 F.3d 959,968 [similar].) \nAt the core of the question presented is whether the Governor or Attorney General, \nas opposed to the custodians of state prisons or county jails who are directly responsible \nfor making ICE notification and transfer decisions, owe any legal duty to the prison or \njail inmates who are subject to those decisions.  Petitioners contend that respondents' \nduty arises from their supervisory authority.  With respect to prison inmates, the \nGovernor has \"complete authority\" over the California Department of Corrections and \nRehabilitation during the current state of emergency.  (Gov. Code, ยง 8627.)  With respect \nto county jail inmates, petitioners point to article V, section 13 of the California \nConstitution, which says:  \"The Attorney General shall have direct supervision over \nevery district attorney and sheriff and over such other law enforcement officers as may be \ndesignated by law, in all matters pertaining to the duties oftheir respective offices ....\"  \nFurther, in their informal opposition, respondents acknowledge they have broad authority \nto direct state and local agencies under the Emergency Services Act (Gov. Code, ยง 8550 \net seq.).  According to petitioners, the Governor and Attorney General have ample \nauthority to direct how custodial officials make ICE notification and transfer decisions -\nyet respondents, by allowing transfers to continue unabated during this public health \n7 \n\ncrisis; have failed to give adequate consideration to the grave risks posed by such \ntransfers in violation of due process of law. \nThe Governor and Attorney General counter that their broad authority in this \ncontext does not give rise to any corresponding legal duty and, further, that due process \nrequires \"a complex balancing of competing interests.\"  According to respondents, \"there \nare a number of case-specific factors that may be relevant to the necessary balancing of \ninterests, including the conditions and practices at a specific detention facility, the State's \nparticular interest in assisting with federal immigration enforcement efforts, the \ndetainee's health and medical history, and the amount of time the detainee is likely to \nspend at the detention facility.\"  But respondents do not indicate whether they are \nactually considering a number of competing interests when making such decisions or \nhow they actually go about balancing such interests.  There is no mention of official or \nunofficial criteria, the process actually used, or which officials at what level make the \ndecisions.  Most telling, respondents make no assertion that state or local officials are \nactually considering, as one of the competing interests, the risk that inmates will contract \nthe virus and become seriously ill in ICE detention facilities - a risk that the Attorney \nGeneral has recognized as serious enough to \"caus[e] countless unnecessary deaths.\" \n(Attorney General Letter, supra, at p. 1.) \nSo, even if the court is correct that respondents have no clear duty to grant \npetitioners' requested relief (i.e., a moratorium on transfers), the analysis does not end \nthere.  Petitioners' central claim is that respondents' present conduct amounts to \ndeliberate indifference to inmates' health and safety in violation of due process.  If this \nclaim succeeds, nothing would prevent us from ordering appropriate relief.  (Lockyer v. \nCity and County ofS an Francisco (2004) 33 Ca1.4th 1055, 1113 [\"As a general matter, \nthe nature of the relief warranted in a mandate action is dependent upon the \ncircumstances of the particular case, and a court is not necessarily limited by the prayer \nsought in the mandate petition but may grant the relief it deems appropriate.\"].)  An \nappropriate remedy could recognize that although respondents have discretion to balance \ncompeting interests in their approach to transfers, it is an abuse of discretion not to \nconsider COVID-19 risk as one important factor, and mandamus will lie to \"correct [that] \nabuse of discretion.\" (Common Cause, supra, 49 Ca1.3d at p. 442.)  Such a mandate \nwould not impermissibly control the exercise of lawful discretion; it would instead \nrequire state officials to \"exercise [their discretion] under a proper interpretation of the \napplicable law.\"  (Ibid.)  Although consideration ofCOVID-19 risk might make a \ndifference to transfer decisions in certain cases, that consideration could be outweighed in \nother cases, including cases where public safety considerations support transfer of \ndangerous individuals.  This court is fully capable of crafting a proper mandate that does \nnot intrude on the lawful discretion of the Governor and Attorney General. \nBut we need not get ahead of ourselves.  At this stage, we have a petition, an \ninformal response, a reply, and a formidable submission of exhibits and declarations in \n8 \n\nsupport of the claim that respondents have demonstrated deliberate indifference to the \nhealth and safety of California's jail and prison inmates.  There is a substantial legal \nquestion as to whether respondents, in light of their supervisory authority over state and \nlocal officials, have a corresponding duty to ensure that ICE notification and transfer \ndecisions are made in conformity with due process of law. At this point, I cannot \nconfidently say what the answer is.  What I can say is that the question is urgent and \nimportant, and this court should answer it, whatever the answer may be. \nAccordingly, I would issue an order directing respondents to show cause why they \nhave not acted with deliberate indifference to.the health and safety of California inmates \nin allowing the continued transfer of those inmates to ICE detention centers.  To the \nextent that factual development is needed, this court may appoint a referee or special \nmaster.  (See, e.g., Eu, supra, 54 Cal.3d at p. 473.)  Unlike the factual inquiry we recently \nconsidered in National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers v. Newsom, petition \ndenied May 4, 2020, S261827, which involved conditions at scores of jails and juvenile \nfacilities in 15 or more counties, the factual inquiry in this case principally concerns the \nconditions at the five ICE facilities in California, which seems a manageable task. \nRespondents' contention that they are \"poorly situated to substantiate or contest \n~etitioner's factual allegations\" is unpersuasive.  In his April 13, 2020 letter to DHS, the \nAttorney General detailed serious concerns about conditions in ICE facilities \"[b] ased on \nthe California Department of Justice's comprehensive reviews of six facilities and tours \nof all other detention facilities in California where immigrants are held pending their \nimmigration proceedings.\"  (Attorney General Letter, supra, at p. 1.)  This appears to be a \nreference to the Attorney General's comprehensive 147-page review of conditions in ICE \nfacilities, published in February 2019.  (Dept. of Justice, Review of Immigration \nDetention in California (Feb. 2019).)  The Attorney General conducted this review \npursuant to Government Code section 12532, which requires the Attorney General to \nperiodically inspect, make findings, and publicly report on immigration detention \nfacilities in California, including \"the conditions of confinement\" and \"the standard of \ncare ... provided.\"  (Gov. Code,ยง 12532, subd. (b)(l)(A), (B).)  This statute further \nstates:  \"The Attorney General, or his or her designee, shall be provided all necessary \naccess for the observations necessary to effectuate reviews required pursuant to this \nsection, including, but not limited to, access to detainees, officials, personnel, and \nrecords.\"  (Id., subd. (c).)  The Attorney General has successfully defended his \nprerogatives under this provision as to subdivisions (b)(l)(A) and (b)(l)(B) against \narguments that they violate intergovernmental immunity and federal preemption.  (US. v. \nCalifornia (9th Cir. 2019) 921 F.3d 865, 873.)  In light of his positions in federal court \nand in public, it is quite remarkable that the Attorney General now purports to be at a loss \nas to \"how Respondents should go about verifying these wide-ranging allegations in this \nsuit.\"  If anything, respondents are in a better position than petitioners to obtain access to \nthe facilities, detainees, officials, and documents that are relevant to this petition. \n9 \n\nInstead of affording the parties a full opportunity to be heard, the court today \ndenies the petition on the ground that respondents have no clear duty to halt all transfers. \n\"The denial is, however, without prejudice to\" the filing of similar claims \"against \nresponsible authorities\" \"in the superior courts of appropriate counties.\"  This disposition \nleaves much to be desired for several reasons. \nThe first is the undeniable urgency and statewide importance of the issues \npresented.  (See California Redevelopment Assn. v. Matosantos (2011) 53 Cal.4th 231, \n253 [\"We will invoke our original jurisdiction where the matters to be decided are of \nsufficiently great importance and require immediate resolution.\"].)  Simply put, it is our \njob to decide issues like the ones presented in this petition- not only whether \nrespondents have a duty to impose a moratorium on transfers, but more fundamentally \nwhether respondents have a duty in this context to act without deliberate indifference to \ninmates' health and safety.  To the extent there is some question whether petitioners' \nclaims are cognizable in an original mandamus action, that is not an obstacle to our \nthorough and swift consideration of the matter.  (See Vandermost v. Bowen (2012) 53 \nCa1.4th 421,441 & fn. 15 [original mandate proceeding in which the court's order to \nshow cause \"established an extremely expedited briefing schedule\" and \"expressly \nreserv[ ed] resolution of the threshold question of jurisdiction for our eventual written \ndecision\"].)  We are in a state of emergency.  We can and should, without delay, give all \nsides a full hearing and provide a reasoned opinion answering the questions presented. \nSecond, I do not see why it makes sense to refer these claims to \"the superior \ncourts of appropriate counties\" when the main factual issues concerning the five ICE \ndetention facilities in California would be the same no matter where the claims are filed. \nThis seems like a recipe for duplicative litigation.  Moreover, in light of current public \nhealth conditions and the urgency of petitioners' claims, I am doubtful that the superior \ncourts, which have been heavily impacted and burdened by the pandemic, are better \npositioned than this court to resolve the matter now before us. \nThird, to the extent that today's order suggests we should wait and see what \nhappens in \"ongoing federal litigation targeting alleged deficiencies at immigration \ndetention facilities,\" this misunderstands petitioners' claims.  Petitioners and other \nadvocates are litigating on all fronts, to be sure.  But whatever relief they may obtain \nagainst federal officials in terms of improving conditions at ICE facilities, their principal \nclaim here is that California's approach to ICE notification and transfers exacerbates the \nCOVID-19 risk in those facilities and does not meet constitutional standards.  Indeed, \nCalifornia's ongoing transfer of inmates to ICE facilities may well undermine any relief \nthat the federal courts provide. \nI fear that today's order will unnecessarily delay resolution of issues with \npotentially dire consequences for inmates, correctional staff, the health care system, and \nour state as a whole.  In response to the pandemic, the Judicial Council has said that \n\"[t]he continuous operation of our courts is essential for our constitutional form of \n10 \n\ngovernment, for providing due process and protecting the public.\"  (Judicial Council of \nCalifornia, Statewide Emergency Order (Mar. 30, 2020).)  In order to serve these vital \npurposes, it is incumbent upon us not only to maintain continuous operation but also to \nfully engage and resolve claims as important as those asserted in this petition. \nFinally, it bears mention that \"[t]he courts ... have a special obligation \nto protect the rights of prisoners.\"  (Hudson v. Palmer (1984) 468 U.S. 517,557 (cone. & \ndis. opn. of Stevens, J.); see Turner v. Safley (1987) 482 U.S. 78, 84 [\"Prison walls do not \nform a barrier separating prison inmates from the protections of the Constitution.\"].) \n\"The Constitution 'does not mandate comfortable prisons,' but neither does it permit \ninhumane ones ....\"   (Farmer, supra, 511 U.S. at p. 832, citation omitted; see id. at \np. 833 [\"[H]aving stripped [inmates] of virtually every means of self-protection and \nforeclosed their access to outside aid, the government and its officials are not free to let \nthe state of nature take its course.\"].)  The deliberate indifference standard does not \nrequire a petitioner \"seeking 'a remedy for unsafe conditions [to] await a tragic event ... \nbefore obtaining relief.' \"  (!d.  at p. 845.)  These observations carry particular force \nduring the present state of emergency, as it is evident that the burdens of the pandemic do \nnot fall equally upon all. \nThe warning signs could not be more clear.  (See Winton, 70% of inmates test \npositive for coronavirus at Lompoc federal prison, L.A. Times (May 9, 2020).)  We \nshould act with an urgency that befits the current crisis.  Petitioners contend that the \nGovernor and Attorney General bear responsibility for the substantial risk of serious \nharm that ICE transfers pose to persons in state and local custody; respondents disclaim \nany legal duty to mitigate that risk.  We owe it to the parties and the public to resolve the \nheart of this matter. \nLIU, J. \n11 ",

The current proceeding\narises from respondents' role in the transfer of noncitizen state prisoners and county jail\ninmates to federal immigration authorities, which may lead to detention in facilities that,\naccording to the petition, do not follow safe practices or otherwise take reasonable steps to\nprevent transmission of the virus. On March 23, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention issued guidance observing that conditions in correctional and detention facilities\npresent \"unique challenges for control of COVID-19 transmission among\nincarcerated/detained persons, staff, and visitors.\" (Centers for Disease Control and\nhttps://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/dockets.cfm?dist=0&doc_id=2317360&doc_no=S261829&request_token=NiIwLSEmXkw6WzBBSCMtVE9JQEโฆ 2/9\n\n7/6/2020 California Courts - Appellate Court Case Information\nPrevention, Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in\nCorrectional and Detention Facilities (Mar. 23, 2020) p. 2.) Petitioners contend that\nrespondents, the Governor and the Attorney General, have violated their constitutional\nrights by failing to take action to prevent state and local authorities with custody over\nnoncitizen inmates from facilitating their transfer to federal immigration authorities, which\nmay lead to detention in one of five federal immigration detention facilities in California with\nknowledge of or reckless indifference to the risk that detention in these facilities will cause\nthem, facility employees, and members of the surrounding communities to become infected\nwith the novel coronavirus. Petitioners allege, with supporting declarations, that these\nfacilities do not practice appropriate social distancing, do not maintain sanitary conditions\nin dorms and common areas, do not provide adequate medical care to inmates with\npossible symptoms of infection, and do not provide inmates with masks or supplies for\nbasic hygiene, such as soap or hand sanitizer. Petitioners further allege that state\nauthorities are aware of the dangerous conditions at these detention facilities but\nnonetheless failed to take action to prevent the transfer of noncitizen inmates to these\nfacilities. Petitioners contend that respondents' conduct violates their right to due process.\nRespondents contend that the duty to remedy any violations rests with federal officials in\ncharge of the detention facilities, that pending federal litigation provides an adequate\nalternative remedy, and that petitioners have failed to identify any clear ministerial duty that\ncould be remedied by issuance of a writ of mandate. They note, among other things, that\nCalifornia law provides that local law enforcement officials have discretion to cooperate\nwith federal immigration authorities \"only\" where permitted by the California Values Act\n(Gov. Code, ยง 7284 et seq.) and \"if doing so would not violate any federal, state, or local\nlaw, or local policy.\" (Id., ยง 7282.5, subd. (a).) Outside of these limitations, respondents\nargue, the law preserves substantial discretion for state and local custodial officials to\nconsider multiple factors in determining whether to provide assistance to federal\nimmigration authorities in any particular case. The petition establishes no clear and\nmandatory duty on the part of the Governor and the Attorney General to take the requested\naction. The petition for writ of mandate is therefore denied. The denial is, however, without\nprejudice to the institution of any action for writ of mandate or prohibition against\nresponsible authorities with respect to conduct that may unnecessarily expose inmates in\ntheir custody to significant risks to their health and safety. Such claims may be brought in\nthe superior courts of appropriate counties.\nFor any such filing, the superior court should be mindful of a range of procedural tools to\nachieve prompt and effective resolution of the matter. Those tools include the authority to: -\njoin all parties necessary for full inquiry into the issues raised and for development and\nimplementation of any appropriate relief (Code Civ. Proc., ยง 389, subd. (a)); - consolidate\nthe action with any similar actions pending in the court, in the interest of efficiency and in\nlight of public health concerns (Code Civ. Proc., ยง 1048, subd. (a)); - transfer and\nconsolidate matters across counties upon a motion by any party when such transfer and\nconsolidation would promote efficient utilization of judicial resources and otherwise satisfy\napplicable standards (Code Civ. Proc., ยงยง 403, 404.1); - assign a single bench officer or\nappoint one or more referees or special masters to bring swift and focused attention to the\nissues raised (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.734; Code Civ. Proc., ยงยง 638, 639); - facilitate\ndiscussion among all parties to achieve a negotiated resolution that is responsive to local\nconditions and avoids protracted litigation; - order interim relief, as appropriate, during the\npendency of the action; and - give the matter expedited consideration for evidentiary\nhearings, briefing, and any joint discussions for resolution. In all such matters, the superior\ncourt is to proceed as expeditiously as possible and to be mindful that conditions\nassociated with COVID-19 in detention facilities and local communities are continually\nevolving. Given the dynamic nature of the pandemic, yet cognizant of the ongoing federal\nlitigation targeting alleged deficiencies at immigration detention facilities, the denial of the\npetition is without prejudice to the filing of a new petition in this court raising similar claims\nif circumstances warrant.

Petitioners in this mandamus proceeding allege that\nrespondents, the Governor and the Attorney General, have acted with deliberate\nindifference to the health and safety of California's prison and jail inmates by allowing the\nongoing transfer of inmates to federal immigration detention facilities during the COVID-19\npandemic. According to petitioners, these facilities have unsanitary conditions, do not allow\nfor social distancing, and lack resources to treat infected inmates who become seriously ill.\nPetitioners seek a writ of mandate ordering respondents to impose a moratorium on all\nsuch transfers. Article VI, section 10 of the California Constitution grants this court original\njurisdiction in mandamus. As a prudential matter, we exercise such jurisdiction \"only in\ncases in which 'the issues presented are of great public importance and must be resolved\npromptly.' \" (San Francisco Unified School Dist. v. Johnson (1971) 3 Cal.3d 937, 944.) If\nthere is any case where exercising our mandamus jurisdiction is appropriate, this is it. The\npetition alleges time-sensitive, critical health concerns on behalf of persons in state and\nlocal custody, and raises legal issues of obvious statewide importance. Since we received\nthis petition on April 24, 2020, a detainee at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego\nCounty became the first person in federal immigration custody to die of COVID-19\ncomplications. (Santana & Shoichet, First ICE detainee dies from coronavirus (May 6,\n2020) CNN.) If petitioners' allegations are true, more deaths will surely follow. We should\nretain this matter, issue an order to show cause, appoint a factfinder if necessary, and\npromptly resolve the issues presented. The 1, 900 pages of exhibits and declarations\naccompanying the petition include detailed documentation of the United States Immigration\nand Customs Enforcement's (ICE) failures in providing basic protections against COVID-19\nat its five detention facilities in California. Petitioners allege that social distancing, which is\ncritical to preventing the spread of COVID-19, is impossible given the physical confines of\nthe facilities and the number of individuals detained in them. According to petitioners, the\nfacilities house dozens of detainees in a single dormitory-style unit with bunk beds no more\nthan one meter apart. Detainees are often required to be in close proximity with one\nanother as they share dining areas, bathrooms, recreational spaces, and medical units.\nMoreover, petitioners allege that ICE has taken no meaningful action to reduce its\ndetention center populations and continues to defy the guidance of federal health\nauthorities. (See U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Interim Guidance on\nManagement of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention\nFacilities (Mar. 23, 2020) (CDC Guidance).) In multiple facilities, detainees have no regular\naccess to gloves, masks, hand sanitizer, or even soap. At the Otay Mesa Detention Center,\npetitioners allege, officials withheld facemasks from detainees unless they signed a waiver\nreleasing the officials from responsibility if they contracted COVID-19. Many who have\nexperienced COVID-19 symptoms have not been treated. Meanwhile, ICE continues to\nbook new detainees into custody and to transfer detainees between detention centers\nwithout recommended quarantine procedures or protocols to screen detainees and staff for\nsymptoms of COVID-19.\nRespondents acknowledge that these allegations are \"serious and alarming.\" In fact, they\nhave raised the same concerns themselves. In an April 13, 2020 letter to the U.S.\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS), the Attorney General urged the agency to\nrelease detainees who pose no risk to public safety and to \"halt the introduction of new\ndetainees to immigration detention facilities\" in California. (Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra, letter\nhttps://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/dockets.cfm?dist=0&doc_id=2317360&doc_no=S261829&request_token=NiIwLSEmXkw6WzBBSCMtVE9JQEโฆ 4/9\n\n7/6/2020 California Courts - Appellate Court Case Information\nto Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad F. Wolf, April 13, 2020, p. 4 (Attorney\nGeneral Letter).) Based on \"comprehensive reviews\" of these facilities, the Attorney\nGeneral \"encountered many individuals whose medical conditions place them at a higher\nrisk for developing serious illness from COVID-19.\" (Id. at p. 1.) In the words of the\nAttorney General: \"I am aware that the physical plants, custody and staffing patterns, and\nhealth care systems in immigration detention do not allow for social distancing practices\nand that additional practices such as improved sanitation, screening, and halting the\nadmission of new detainees are needed to prevent transmission of the virus. Further, the\nfacilities in question in California do not appear to have the healthcare resources required\nto treat infected detainees who become seriously ill. Failure to use your discretion to\ndecrease the detainee population as much as possible and improve sanitation and COVID-\n19 screening practices for those detainees that remain will not only harm civil immigration\ndetainees, but will overwhelm community hospitals to which those detainees will\nnecessarily be transferred for treatment. . . . Urgent action is required to prevent our\ncountry's immigration detention system from causing countless unnecessary deaths.\"\n(Ibid.) And yet, according to petitioners, state and local officials continue to notify ICE of\ninmate release dates and to facilitate the transfer of inmates to ICE from state prisons and\ncounty jails, populating the very detention centers that the Attorney General has called on\nICE to depopulate. By some evidence, California's prisons and jails have become the\nprimary source of new detainees to some of these facilities in California, as ICE has limited\nthe intake of detainees from other sources during the pandemic. These transfers continue,\npetitioners allege, even as the CDC has specifically urged the \"restrict[ion of] transfers of\nincarcerated/detained persons to and from other jurisdictions and facilities unless\nnecessary for medical evaluation, medical isolation/quarantine, clinical care, extenuating\nsecurity concerns, or to prevent overcrowding.\" (CDC Guidance, supra, at p. 9.) A writ of\nmandate may be issued \"by any court to any inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or\nperson, to compel the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins, as a duty\nresulting from an office, trust, or station.\" (Code Civ. Proc., ยง 1085.) Respondents' primary\nargument is that a writ of mandate cannot issue to control the Governor's or the Attorney\nGeneral's exercise of discretion in a particular manner. They contend that petitioners have\nidentified no ministerial duty on the part of the Governor or Attorney General to impose a\nmoratorium on the transfer of California inmates to federal immigration detention centers.\nToday's order denies the petition based on an assertion that \"[t]he petition establishes no\nclear and mandatory duty on the part of the Governor and the Attorney General to take the\nrequested action.\"\nBut that assertion does not address the crux of petitioners' claim or the scope of this court's\nmandamus authority. It is true that a writ of mandate will \"usually\" issue to compel an\nofficial to perform a ministerial duty. (Santa Clara County Counsel Attys. Assn. v. Woodside\n(1994) 7 Cal.4th 525, 539-540.) And I agree that the relief petitioners seek is likely not\ngrounded in any ministerial duty, meaning \"an obligation to perform a specific act in a\nmanner prescribed by law whenever a given state of facts exists, without regard to any\npersonal judgment as to the propriety of the act.\" (People v. Picklesimer (2010) 48 Cal.4th\n330, 340.) But that is not the limit of our mandamus authority. We may also issue the writ\n\"to compel a public agency's performance or correct an agency's abuse of discretion\nwhether the action being compelled or corrected can itself be characterized as 'ministerial'\nor 'legislative.' \" (Woodside, at p. 540; see Common Cause v. Board of Supervisors (1989)\n49 Cal.3d 432, 442 (Common Cause) [\"[M]andamus will lie to correct an abuse of\ndiscretion by an official acting in an administrative capacity.\"]; Landsborough v. Kelly (1934)\n1 Cal.2d 739, 744; Inglin v. Hoppin (1909) 156 Cal. 483, 491; see also 8 Witkin, Cal.\nProcedure (5th ed. 2020) Writs ยง 95, [use of mandamus to control abuse of discretion].) On\nnumerous occasions, this court and the Courts of Appeal have found it appropriate to issue\na writ of mandate to control abuses of discretion by public officials. (See e.g., Clean Air\nConstituency v. Cal. State Air Resources Bd. (1974) 11 Cal.3d 801, 819; In re Veterans'\nIndustries, Inc. (1970) 8 Cal.App.3d 902, 925-927; Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corp. v.\nSuperior Court (1962) 208 Cal.App.2d 803, 824; Munns v. Stenman (1957) 152 Cal.App.2d\nhttps://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/dockets.cfm?dist=0&doc_id=2317360&doc_no=S261829&request_token=NiIwLSEmXkw6WzBBSCMtVE9JQEโฆ 5/9\n\n7/6/2020 California Courts - Appellate Court Case Information\n543, 551.) Moreover, we have signaled that official acts or omissions in violation of\nconstitutional limits will constitute an abuse of discretion. For example, in Wilson v. Eu\n(1991) 54 Cal.3d 471 (Eu), this court exercised its original jurisdiction to issue an\nalternative writ of mandate appointing three special masters to hold hearings and\nrecommend a reapportionment plan to the court if the Governor and Legislature failed to\nresolve their impasse and enact a plan in time for the 1992 election. (Id. at pp. 473-475.)\nWe found it appropriate to issue the writ to \" ' \"[e]nsure the electorate equal protection of\nthe laws.\" ' \" (Id. at p. 473; see Jolicoeur v. Mihaly (1971) 5 Cal.3d 565, 570, fn. 2\n[\"Mandamus is . . . appropriate for challenging the constitutionality or validity of statutes or\nofficial acts.\"].) Our decision implied that the Governor's and Legislature's failure to enact a\nreapportionment plan would constitute an abuse of discretion by denying Californians their\nconstitutional right to equal representation. (Eu, at p. 473.) The relevant question,\ntherefore, is not whether the Governor and Attorney General have a ministerial duty to\norder a moratorium on ICE transfers. It is whether the Governor and Attorney General have\nabused their discretionary authority over California prisons and jails by demonstrating\ndeliberate indifference to the health and safety of inmates in allowing their continued\ntransfer to ICE detention centers.\nThe due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\nprohibits state officials from acting with deliberate indifference to a detained individual's\nhealth and safety. (Lemire v. Cal. Dept. of Corrections and Rehabilitation (9th Cir. 2013)\n726 F.3d 1062, 1075; see Farmer v. Brennan (1994) 511 U.S. 825, 843 (Farmer) [Eighth\nAmendment is violated when \"prison officials, acting with deliberate indifference, expose[] a\nprisoner to a sufficiently substantial 'risk of serious damage to his future health' \"]; Castro v.\nCounty of Los Angeles (9th Cir. 2016) 833 F.3d 1060, 1067 [due process rights of civil\ndetainees are at least as great as Eighth Amendment rights of prisoners].) State officials\ncan be liable for deliberate indifference if they place or leave an individual \" 'in a situation\nthat was more dangerous than the one in which they found him.' \" (Kennedy v. City of\nRidgefield (9th Cir. 2006) 439 F.3d 1055, 1062, quoting Munger v. City of Glasgow Police\nDept. (9th Cir. 2000) 227 F.3d 1082, 1086.) Placing an individual who is under the\ngovernment's control into objectively unsafe conditions created by a third party constitutes\ndeliberate indifference to the individual's health and safety. (See Hernandez v. City of San\nJose (9th Cir. 2018) 897 F.3d 1125, 1138 [police action \"shepherd[ing] [people] into a\nviolent crowd of protesters\" and blocking off other exits is sufficient to establish deliberate\nindifference]; Doe ex rel. Johnson v. S.C. Dept. of Soc. Services (4th Cir. 2010) 597 F.3d\n163, 175 [due process prohibits state agency from \"mak[ing] a foster care placement that is\ndeliberately indifferent to the child's right to personal safety and security\"]; Cortes-\nQuinones v. Jimenez-Nettleship (1st Cir. 1988) 842 F.2d 556, 560 (opn. of Breyer, J.)\n[prison official acted with deliberate indifference to inmate's safety under Eighth\nAmendment when he transferred a mentally ill inmate to a crowded jail that was known for\nviolence].) And an official may be held liable for acquiescing to the constitutional violations\nof those over whom the official has supervisory control. (See Starr v. Baca (9th Cir. 2011)\n652 F.3d 1202, 1208 [sheriff could be held liable for knowing acquiescence to the\nunconstitutional prison policies and customs of the county]; Dubner v. City & County of San\nFrancisco (9th Cir. 2001) 266 F.3d 959, 968 [similar].) At the core of the question presented\nis whether the Governor or Attorney General, as opposed to the custodians of state prisons\nor county jails who are directly responsible for making ICE notification and transfer\ndecisions, owe any legal duty to the prison or jail inmates who are subject to those\ndecisions. Petitioners contend that respondents' duty arises from their supervisory\nauthority. With respect to prison inmates, the Governor has \"complete authority\" over the\nCalifornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation during the current state of\nemergency. (Gov. Code, ยง 8627.) With respect to county jail inmates, petitioners point to\narticle V, section 13 of the California Constitution, which says: \"The Attorney General shall\nhave direct supervision over every district attorney and sheriff and over such other law\nenforcement officers as may be designated by law, in all matters pertaining to the duties of\ntheir respective offices . . . .\" Further, in their informal opposition, respondents\nhttps://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/dockets.cfm?dist=0&doc_id=2317360&doc_no=S261829&request_token=NiIwLSEmXkw6WzBBSCMtVE9JQEโฆ 6/9\n\n7/6/2020 California Courts - Appellate Court Case Information\nacknowledge they have broad authority to direct state and local agencies under the\nEmergency Services Act (Gov. Code, ยง 8550 et seq.). According to petitioners, the\nGovernor and Attorney General have ample authority to direct how custodial officials make\nICE notification and transfer decisions - yet respondents, by allowing transfers to continue\nunabated during this public health crisis, have failed to give adequate consideration to the\ngrave risks posed by such transfers in violation of due process of law.\nThe Governor and Attorney General counter that their broad authority in this context does\nnot give rise to any corresponding legal duty and, further, that due process requires \"a\ncomplex balancing of competing interests.\" According to respondents, \"there are a number\nof case-specific factors that may be relevant to the necessary balancing of interests,\nincluding the conditions and practices at a specific detention facility, the State's particular\ninterest in assisting with federal immigration enforcement efforts, the detainee's health and\nmedical history, and the amount of time the detainee is likely to spend at the detention\nfacility.\" But respondents do not indicate whether they are actually considering a number of\ncompeting interests when making such decisions or how they actually go about balancing\nsuch interests. There is no mention of official or unofficial criteria, the process actually\nused, or which officials at what level make the decisions. Most telling, respondents make\nno assertion that state or local officials are actually considering, as one of the competing\ninterests, the risk that inmates will contract the virus and become seriously ill in ICE\ndetention facilities - a risk that the Attorney General has recognized as serious enough to\n\"caus[e] countless unnecessary deaths.\" (Attorney General Letter, supra, at p. 1.) So, even\nif the court is correct that respondents have no clear duty to grant petitioners' requested\nrelief (i.e., a moratorium on transfers), the analysis does not end there. Petitioners' central\nclaim is that respondents' present conduct amounts to deliberate indifference to inmates'\nhealth and safety in violation of due process. If this claim succeeds, nothing would prevent\nus from ordering appropriate relief. (Lockyer v. City and County of San Francisco (2004) 33\nCal.4th 1055, 1113 [\"As a general matter, the nature of the relief warranted in a mandate\naction is dependent upon the circumstances of the particular case, and a court is not\nnecessarily limited by the prayer sought in the mandate petition but may grant the relief it\ndeems appropriate.\"].) An appropriate remedy could recognize that although respondents\nhave discretion to balance competing interests in their approach to transfers, it is an abuse\nof discretion not to consider COVID-19 risk as one important factor, and mandamus will lie\nto \"correct [that] abuse of discretion.\" (Common Cause, supra, 49 Cal.3d at p. 442.) Such a\nmandate would not impermissibly control the exercise of lawful discretion; it would instead\nrequire state officials to \"exercise [their discretion] under a proper interpretation of the\napplicable law.\" (Ibid.) Although consideration of COVID-19 risk might make a difference to\ntransfer decisions in certain cases, that consideration could be outweighed in other cases,\nincluding cases where public safety considerations support transfer of dangerous\nindividuals. This court is fully capable of crafting a proper mandate that does not intrude on\nthe lawful discretion of the Governor and Attorney General. But we need not get ahead of\nourselves. At this stage, we have a petition, an informal response, a reply, and a\nformidable submission of exhibits and declarations in support of the claim that respondents\nhave demonstrated deliberate indifference to the health and safety of California's jail and\nprison inmates. There is a substantial legal question as to whether respondents, in light of\ntheir supervisory authority over state and local officials, have a corresponding duty to\nensure that ICE notification and transfer decisions are made in conformity with due process\nof law. At this point, I cannot confidently say what the answer is. What I can say is that the\nquestion is urgent and important, and this court should answer it, whatever the answer may\nbe.\nAccordingly, I would issue an order directing respondents to show cause why they have not\nacted with deliberate indifference to the health and safety of California inmates in allowing\nthe continued transfer of those inmates to ICE detention centers. To the extent that factual\ndevelopment is needed, this court may appoint a referee or special master. (See, e.g., Eu,\nsupra, 54 Cal.3d at p. 473.) Unlike the factual inquiry we recently considered in National\nAssociation of Criminal Defense Lawyers v. Newsom, petition denied May 4, 2020,\nhttps://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/dockets.cfm?dist=0&doc_id=2317360&doc_no=S261829&request_token=NiIwLSEmXkw6WzBBSCMtVE9JQEโฆ 7/9\n\n7/6/2020 California Courts - Appellate Court Case Information\nS261827, which involved conditions at scores of jails and juvenile facilities in 15 or more\ncounties, the factual inquiry in this case principally concerns the conditions at the five ICE\nfacilities in California, which seems a manageable task. Respondents' contention that they\nare \"poorly situated to substantiate or contest Petitioner's factual allegations\" is\nunpersuasive. In his April 13, 2020 letter to DHS, the Attorney General detailed serious\nconcerns about conditions in ICE facilities \"[b]ased on the California Department of\nJustice's comprehensive reviews of six facilities and tours of all other detention facilities in\nCalifornia where immigrants are held pending their immigration proceedings.\" (Attorney\nGeneral Letter, supra, at p. 1.) This appears to be a reference to the Attorney General's\ncomprehensive 147-page review of conditions in ICE facilities, published in February 2019.\n(Dept. of Justice, Review of Immigration Detention in California (Feb. 2019).) The Attorney\nGeneral conducted this review pursuant to Government Code section 12532, which\nrequires the Attorney General to periodically inspect, make findings, and publicly report on\nimmigration detention facilities in California, including \"the conditions of confinement\" and\n\"the standard of care . . . provided.\" (Gov. Code, ยง 12532, subd. (b)(1)(A), (B).) This statute\nfurther states: \"The Attorney General, or his or her designee, shall be provided all\nnecessary access for the observations necessary to effectuate reviews required pursuant\nto this section, including, but not limited to, access to detainees, officials, personnel, and\nrecords.\" (Id., subd. (c).) The Attorney General has successfully defended his prerogatives\nunder this provision as to subdivisions (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) against arguments that they\nviolate intergovernmental immunity and federal preemption. (U.S. v. California (9th Cir.\n2019) 921 F.3d 865, 873.) In light of his positions in federal court and in public, it is quite\nremarkable that the Attorney General now purports to be at a loss as to \"how Respondents\nshould go about verifying these wide-ranging allegations in this suit.\" If anything,\nrespondents are in a better position than petitioners to obtain access to the facilities,\ndetainees, officials, and documents that are relevant to this petition.\nInstead of affording the parties a full opportunity to be heard, the court today denies the\npetition on the ground that respondents have no clear duty to halt all transfers. \"The denial\nis, however, without prejudice to\" the filing of similar claims \"against responsible\nauthorities\" \"in the superior courts of appropriate counties.\" This disposition leaves much to\nbe desired for several reasons. The first is the undeniable urgency and statewide\nimportance of the issues presented. (See California Redevelopment Assn. v. Matosantos\n(2011) 53 Cal.4th 231, 253 [\"We will invoke our original jurisdiction where the matters to be\ndecided are of sufficiently great importance and require immediate resolution.\"].) Simply\nput, it is our job to decide issues like the ones presented in this petition - not only whether\nrespondents have a duty to impose a moratorium on transfers, but more fundamentally\nwhether respondents have a duty in this context to act without deliberate indifference to\ninmates' health and safety. To the extent there is some question whether petitioners' claims\nare cognizable in an original mandamus action, that is not an obstacle to our thorough and\nswift consideration of the matter. (See Vandermost v. Bowen (2012) 53 Cal.4th 421, 441 &\nfn. 15 [original mandate proceeding in which the court's order to show cause \"established\nan extremely expedited briefing schedule\" and \"expressly reserv[ed] resolution of the\nthreshold question of jurisdiction for our eventual written decision\"].) We are in a state of\nemergency. We can and should, without delay, give all sides a full hearing and provide a\nreasoned opinion answering the questions presented. Second, I do not see why it makes\nsense to refer these claims to \"the superior courts of appropriate counties\" when the main\nfactual issues concerning the five ICE detention facilities in California would be the same\nno matter where the claims are filed. This seems like a recipe for duplicative litigation.\nMoreover, in light of current public health conditions and the urgency of petitioners' claims,\nI am doubtful that the superior courts, which have been heavily impacted and burdened by\nthe pandemic, are better positioned than this court to resolve the matter now before us.\nThird, to the extent that today's order suggests we should wait and see what happens in\n\"ongoing federal litigation targeting alleged deficiencies at immigration detention facilities, \"\nthis misunderstands petitioners' claims. Petitioners and other advocates are litigating on all\nfronts, to be sure. But whatever relief they may obtain against federal officials in terms of\nhttps://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/dockets.cfm?dist=0&doc_id=2317360&doc_no=S261829&request_token=NiIwLSEmXkw6WzBBSCMtVE9JQEโฆ 8/9\n\n7/6/2020 California Courts - Appellate Court Case Information\nimproving conditions at ICE facilities, their principal claim here is that California's approach\nto ICE notification and transfers exacerbates the COVID-19 risk in those facilities and does\nnot meet constitutional standards. Indeed, California's ongoing transfer of inmates to ICE\nfacilities may well undermine any relief that the federal courts provide.\nI fear that today's order will unnecessarily delay resolution of issues with potentially dire\nconsequences for inmates, correctional staff, the health care system, and our state as a\nwhole. In response to the pandemic, the Judicial Council has said that \"[t]he continuous\noperation of our courts is essential for our constitutional form of government, for providing\ndue process and protecting the public.\" (Judicial Council of California, Statewide\nEmergency Order (Mar. 30, 2020).) In order to serve these vital purposes, it is incumbent\nupon us not only to maintain continuous operation but also to fully engage and resolve\nclaims as important as those asserted in this petition. Finally, it bears mention that \"[t]he\ncourts . . . have a special obligation to protect the rights of prisoners.\" (Hudson v. Palmer\n(1984) 468 U.S. 517, 557 (conc. & dis. opn. of Stevens, J.); see Turner v. Safley (1987)\n482 U.S. 78, 84 [\"Prison walls do not form a barrier separating prison inmates from the\nprotections of the Constitution.\"].) \"The Constitution 'does not mandate comfortable\nprisons, ' but neither does it permit inhumane ones . . . .\" (Farmer, supra, 511 U.S. at p.\n832, citation omitted; see id. at p. 833 [\"[H]aving stripped [inmates] of virtually every means\nof self-protection and foreclosed their access to outside aid, the government and its\nofficials are not free to let the state of nature take its course.\"].) The deliberate indifference\nstandard does not require a petitioner \"seeking 'a remedy for unsafe conditions [to] await a\ntragic event . . . before obtaining relief.' \" (Id. at p. 845.) These observations carry particular\nforce during the present state of emergency, as it is evident that the burdens of the\npandemic do not fall equally upon all. The warning signs could not be more clear. (See\nWinton, 70% of inmates test positive for coronavirus at Lompoc federal prison, L.A. Times\n(May 9, 2020).) We should act with an urgency that befits the current crisis. Petitioners\ncontend that the Governor and Attorney General bear responsibility for the substantial risk\nof serious harm that ICE transfers pose to persons in state and local custody; respondents\ndisclaim any legal duty to mitigate that risk. We owe it to the parties and the public to\nresolve the heart of this matter.
