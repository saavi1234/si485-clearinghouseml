    "summary": "<p>On February 19, 2016, the plaintiff, a Muslim person incarcerated at the Red Onion State Prison, filed this pro se lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia, alleging a violation of his right to free expression. He sued the Virginia Department of Corrections (VDOC) and several of its employees, individually and in their official capacities, under 48 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, the Declaratory Judgment Act, and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA). He sought a declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunctions, costs, and damages, and requested a jury trial.</p>\r\n<p>In the complaint, the plaintiff contested three specific prison policies that he alleged hindered his ability to practice his Sufi Islamic faith. First, he alleged that the prison's policy for Jum'ah, the weekly Islamic gathering, for inmates in solitary confinement violated his rights. In the general population, Jum'ah was broadcast in common spaces, but for inmates in solitary confinement, a taped version of Jum'ah was given to inmates with televisions. The plaintiff alleged that he was being held in solitary confinement due to his beard length, and that he had neither a television nor means to get a job that would allow him to purchase a television. He next alleged that the prison's quarter-inch beard policy prevented him from growing his beard out to the four inches mandated by his faith. Finally, he focused on prison food policies, alleging that his halal dinners were no longer halal once they entered the contaminated food slot all solitary confinement inmates used, and that he was not given proper facilities to make his food halal again.</p>\r\n<p>Judge James P. Jones denied the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction on all issues on March 23, 2016, finding that the claims presented in the complaint did not meet the bar of imminent harm. 2016 WL 1179225. The plaintiff appealed this decision on April 14, 2016. In a December 22, 2016 opinion, the Fourth Circuit upheld the district court's decision regarding the halal food issue and beard issue, but remanded the Jum'ah decision, finding that the court did not provide specific facts to support its decision. 672 F. App'x 259.</p>\r\n<p>The case returned to the district court, and on May 10, 2017, Judge Jones denied the plaintiff's request for preliminary injunctive relief on the issue of Jum'ah. 2017 WL 1929669. The court&rsquo;s order followed Magistrate Judge Pamela Meade Sargeant's March 20, 2017 recommendation that injunctive relief be denied. 2017 WL 9517164. The court reasoned that the prison gave the plaintiff the option to improve his behavior, which would allow him to leave segregation or get a job that would pay for a television. Because the plaintiff was in segregation due to disciplinary problems, and it was his financial status that prevented him from purchasing a television, the court found that the plaintiff had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits in proving his religious exercise rights were infringed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff appealed this decision on June 1, 2017, and the Fourth Circuit issued a short memorandum opinion declining to take up the case on October 31, 2017, stating that it had enough information to uphold the district court's decision. 699 F. App'x 280.</p>\r\n<p>On December 15, 2017, Judge Jones issued an opinion on the defendant's motion for summary judgment, which was filed back before the preliminary injunction appeals on July 13, 2016. The court denied summary judgment for the claims arising under RLUIPA, reasoning that the defendants did not counter the plaintiff's allegations that his continued stay in solitary confinement was related to his refusal to trim his beard in accordance with his religion, and that his confinement was preventing him from accessing televised Jum'ah. However, the court granted summary judgment to the defendants on the First Amendment free exercise claims as to the beard, halal food, and Jum'ah policies, finding that these policies did not impose an undue burden under existing precedent.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment addressing the RLUIPA issues on January 12, 2018. Judge Jones granted this motion on September 19, 2018, finding that the defendants&rsquo; supplemental filing presented enough evidence to support summary judgment. The court found that the beard length policies did not substantially burden the plaintiff's religious exercise because his violation of those policies were not the cause of the restrictions on his living conditions. The court found that there was an issue of material fact as to whether the defendants' Jum'ah policies substantially burdened the plaintiff's religious exercise, but that denying the plaintiff television access was the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest, so it did not violate RLUIPA. 2018 WL 4512074.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff appealed this summary judgment decision on October 23, 2018. On December 6, 2019, the Fourth Circuit vacated the district court&rsquo;s grant of summary judgment and remanded the case, holding that the VDOC's use of access to television for religious services as an incentive program unduly burdened the plaintiff's rights to practice a bona fide religious belief. The panel reasoned that religious practice should be a right, not a privilege that could be taken away through an incentive program. 944 F. 3d 243.</p>\r\n<p>Back in the district court, on July 8, 2020, represented by private counsel, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The plaintiff added additional individual defendants, as well as GraceInside, Virginia&rsquo;s prison chaplain service organization. The amended complaint raised three claims. First, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants violated RLUIPA by denying the plaintiff visual access to Jum&rsquo;ah and by prohibiting the plaintiff from growing and maintaining his beard at the length his religion required. Second, the plaintiff argued that these policies also violated the First Amendment. Lastly, the plaintiff argued that the defendants&rsquo; violation of RLUIPA and the First Amendment gave rise to a private right of action under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983.</p>\r\n<p>Following the filing of the amended complaint, the parties reached a separate agreement and jointly moved to dismiss the case with prejudice. The parties decided not to make the settlement public. This case is now closed.</p>",

Judge John P. Jones denied the plaintiff's request for injunctive relief in 2017 and initially granted summary judgment in favor of VDOC in 2018, but the Fourth Circuit overturned this decision on appeal in late 2019, holding that VDOC's use of access to television for religious services as an incentive program unduly burdened the plaintiff's rights to practice a bona fide religious belief. After the case was remanded to the district court, the plaintiff, through legal representation, filed an amended complaint, alleging that the defendants had violated RLUIPA and the First Amendment. Following the filing of the amended complaint, the parties reached a separate agreement and jointly moved to dismiss the case with prejudice. This case is now closed.",

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA \nROANOKE DIVISION \n \nALFONZA HARDY GREENHILL, ) \n  Plaintiff        )  Civil Action No.: 7:16cv00068 \n            )                 \n  v.          ) \n            )             REPORT AND \n            )   RECOMMENDATION \nHAROLD W. CLARKE, et al.,  )  By: PAMELA MEADE SARGENT   \n  Defendants        )  United States Magistrate Judge         \n   \n \nThe  pro  se  plaintiff,  Alfonza  Hardy  Greenhill,  (“Greenhill”),  an  inmate \nincarcerated at Red Onion State Prison, (“Red Onion”), brings this civil rights \naction  pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  §  1983  and  the  Religious  Land  Use  and \nInstitutionalized  Persons  Act,  (“RLUIPA”),  42  U.S.C.  §§  2000cc  to  2000cc-5, \nagainst the defendants, Harold W. Clarke, Director of the Virginia Department of \nCorrections, (“VDOC”), A. David Robinson, Chief of Corrections Operations for \nthe  VDOC,  and  Earl  Barksdale,  Warden  of  Red  Onion.  Greenhill  asserts  that \nrestrictive living conditions in long-term administrative segregation interfere with \nhis ability to exercise his Muslim religious beliefs related to his participation in the \nweekly service know as Jum’ah, as well as wearing a beard and maintaining a \nreligious diet. \n \nGreenhill  has  filed  two  motions,  (Docket  Item  Nos.  4,  35)  (“Motions”), \nseeking, among other relief, preliminary injunctive relief ordering prison officials \nto provide him with a television for viewing a weekly broadcast of the Jum’ah \nservice. This court originally denied Greenhill’s request for preliminary injunctive \nrelief, and Greenhill noted an interlocutory appeal. The United States Court of \n-1- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 41   Filed 03/20/17   Page 1 of 11   Pageid#: 417\n\nAppeals  for  the  Fourth  Circuit  remanded  the  case  for  further  proceedings  on \nGreenhill’s  request  for  preliminary  injunctive  relief.  On  remand,  Greenhill’s \nrequest for preliminary injunctive relief is before the undersigned magistrate judge \non  referral  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §  636(b)(1)(B)  for  a  report  setting  forth \nappropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law and recommended disposition. \n \nI. Facts \n \n  In his sworn Complaint, (Docket Item No. 1), Greenhill claims that he has \nbeen a practicing Sufi Muslim since 2000.  He claims that his religion requires \n“strict adherence, outwardly and inwardly, to the Sunnah (ways, habits, traditions) \nof the Prophet Muhammad…, his Sahabah (companions) and Sufi Masters.” He \nstates that his religion obligates him to be present bodily or visually at the weekly \nFriday Islamic gathering known as Jum’ah. He states that Jum’ah is a central tenet \nof Islam and that “any adult Muslim male who is absent therefrom incurs a terrible \nsin and is deprived of the opportunity to acquire many blessings.” \n \nIn his Complaint, Greenhill concedes that he is housed in the S security level or \nsegregation  housing  at  Red  Onion.    He  states  that,  as  an  inmate  housed  in \nsegregation, he is confined to his cell for 23 hours a day and is only released from \nhis cell to be escorted in handcuffs and leg shackles to an outside recreation cage, \nshower or medical department. As a segregation inmate, Greenhill is not allowed \nto attend weekly Jum’ah services.  He states that Red Onion broadcasts a videotape \nof Jum’ah services every week for inmates in general population and segregation \nhousing.  According to Greenhill, the only segregation inmates who may view this \nservice  are  those  who  can  afford  to  purchase  their  own  television  from  the \ncommissary. Greenhill states that one of these televisions costs $212 and, as an \n-2- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 41   Filed 03/20/17   Page 2 of 11   Pageid#: 418\n\nindigent prisoner, he cannot afford to purchase a television. Therefore, he argues, \nhe is precluded from visually accessing and participating in the weekly Jum’ah \nservices. He claims that this preclusion places a substantial burden on his free \nexercise of his religious beliefs as a Sufi Muslim. \n \nGreenhill  further  alleges  that,  because  he  refuses  for  religious  reasons  to \ncomply with the VDOC’s policy limiting beards to a quarter of an inch in length, \nhe is not eligible to obtain a prison job, which would allow him to earn money to \nbuy a personal television from the commissary. Greenhill states that there are no \ncommunal televisions in Red Onion’s segregation pods, although there are cable \nand electrical outlets on the walls where there used to be communal televisions. \n \nGreenhill has provided the court with a copy of VDOC Operating Procedure, \n(“OP”), 841.3, Offender Religious Programs, effective July 1, 2015. (Docket Item \nNo. 4-3.) This OP establishes “protocols to provide reasonable opportunities for \noffenders incarcerated in Department of Corrections facilities to voluntarily pursue \nreligious  beliefs  and  practices  subject  to  concerns  regarding  facility  security, \nsafety, order, space and resources.”  This OP does not, however, address how \ninmates held in segregation can participate in religious services. \n \nIn response to the Motions, the defendants have filed the Affidavit of A. \nDuncan, the Unit Manager of C-Building at Red Onion. (Docket Item No. 40-1.) \nAccording  to  Duncan,  Greenhill  is  serving  a  15-year,  40-day  sentence.  Since \nGreenhill’s  arrival  at  Red  Onion  in  2013,  he  has  received  10  institutional \ndisciplinary convictions. Duncan states that segregation at Red Onion is “utilized \nfor the protective custody and/or custodial management of offenders and is not \npunitive.” She stated that VDOC OP 861.3, Special Housing, which she attached to \n-3- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 41   Filed 03/20/17   Page 3 of 11   Pageid#: 419\n\nher Affidavit, sets forth the conditions of segregation. Duncan stated that offenders \nassigned  to  a  segregated  housing  assignment  are  limited  in  their  out-of-cell \nactivities, and they may not attend group religious services. According to Duncan, \nthese  inmates  may  practice  their  faith  in  their  cells  and  may  request  that  the \nChaplain visit their cells for private worship and counsel.  \n \nDuncan states that Greenhill has been in segregation at Red Onion since \nSeptember  4,  2015,  after  receiving  institutional  disciplinary  charges.  Operating \nProcedure 830.A establishes procedures for the Segregation Reduction Step-Down \nProgram, (“Step-Down Program”), at Red Onion.  According to Duncan, the Step-\nDown Program is an “incentive-based housing program which creates a pathway \nfor offenders to step-down to lower security levels in a manner that maintains \npublic, staff and offender safety.” Duncan states that the Step-Down Program is “a \ncognitive program which includes pro-social goals and requires the offender to \ncomplete  7  workbooks  in  the  Challenge  Series.”  Duncan  states  that  Greenhill \nrefuses  to  participate  in  this  Step-Down  Program,  and,  therefore,  he  remains \nconfined in a Special Management segregation assignment.  \n \nDuncan states that there are no communal televisions in the housing pods of \nthe C-Building at Red Onion. She states that televisions are considered a privilege \nfor offenders. According to Duncan, if Greenhill participated and met certain goals \nin the Challenge Series and remained infraction free, he could be considered for a \npod job which would enable him to earn money to purchase a personal television. \n   \n   \n-4- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 41   Filed 03/20/17   Page 4 of 11   Pageid#: 420\n\nII. Analysis \n \nGreenhill  seeks  preliminary  injunctive  relief  requiring  the  defendants  to \nprovide him with “the means,” i.e. a television, to visually observe Jum’ah services \nin his cell in segregation housing. “The standard for granting either a [temporary \nrestraining order] or a preliminary injunction is the same.”  Moore v. Kempthorne, \n464 F. Supp. 2d 519, 525 (E.D. Va. 2006) (quoting U.S. ex rel. $12,642.00 U.S. \nCurrency v. Commonwealth of Va., 2003 WL 23710710, at *1 (E.D. Va. 2003) \n(not reported) (citing Rum Creek Coal Sales, Inc. v. Caperton, 926 F.2d 353 (4th \nCir. 1991); Ry. Labor Execs. v. Wheeling Acquisition Corp., 736 F. Supp. 1397 \n(E.D. Va. 1990)).   A plaintiff seeking preliminary injunctive relief is required to \ndemonstrate that he is likely to succeed on the merits of his claim, that he is likely \nto suffer irreparable injury in the absence of an injunction, that the balance of \nequities tips in his favor and that an injunction is in the public interest. See Winter \nv. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). A preliminary injunction is \nan extraordinary remedy, never awarded as of right.  See Winter, 555 U.S. at 24.  \nThe  plaintiff  bears  the  burden  of  establishing  that  the  court  should  grant  a \npreliminary injunction or temporary restraining order.  See Manning v. Hunt, 119 \nF.3d 254, 263 (4th Cir. 1997) (citing Hughes Network Sys., Inc. v. InterDigital \nCommc’ns Corp., 17 F.3d 691, 693 (4th Cir. 1994)).  \n \nGreenhill argues that the defendants’ failure to provide a television for his \ncell  violates  his  rights  under  the  First  Amendment  of  the  U.S.  Constitution  to  \nfreely exercise his religion. Courts have held that, although inmates lose some \nconstitutional protections upon incarceration, they retain the right to freely worship \nwhile in prison.  See McManus v. Bass, 2006 WL 753017, at *4 (E.D. Va. Mar. 22, \n2006)  (citing  O’Lone  v.  Estate  of  Shabazz,  482  U.S.  342,  348  (1987);  Bell  v. \n-5- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 41   Filed 03/20/17   Page 5 of 11   Pageid#: 421\n\nWolfish,  441  U.S.  520,  545  (1979)).    The  Free  Exercise  Clause  of  the  First \nAmendment  provides  that  “Congress  shall  make  no  law  respecting  an \nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. …”  U.S. CONST. \namend. 1.  The Free Exercise Clause extends to prison inmates.  See O’Lone, 482 \nU.S. at 348; Morrison v. Garraghty, 239 F.3d 648, 656 (4th Cir. 2001).  However, \nan  inmate’s  religious  rights  must  be  evaluated  within  the  context  of  his \nincarceration.  The Supreme Court has long cautioned that “courts are ill equipped \nto  deal  with  the  increasingly  urgent  problems  of  prison  administration[,]” \nProcunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 405 (1974) (overruled on other grounds in \nThornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401 (1989)), and, therefore, the court “must accord \ndeference to the officials who run a prison, overseeing and coordinating its many \naspects, including security, discipline, and general administration[,]” Lovelace v. \nLee, 472 F.3d 174, 199 (4th Cir. 2006).   \n \nThis deference is achieved by a rational basis test, under which the court \nconsiders four factors to determine if prison regulations are reasonably related to \nlegitimate penological interests: (1) whether there is a “valid, rational connection” \nbetween  the  prison  regulation  or  action  and  the  interest  asserted  by  the \ngovernment, or whether the interest is “so remote as to render the policy arbitrary \nor irrational;” (2) whether there are alternative means of exercising the asserted \nconstitutional  right  that  remain  open  to  inmates;  (3)  what  impact  the  desired \naccommodation would have on security staff, inmates and the allocation of limited \nprison resources; and (4) whether there exist any “obvious, easy alternatives” to the \nchallenged regulation or action, which may suggest that it is “not reasonable, but is \n[instead] an exaggerated response to prison concerns.”  Lovelace, 472 F.3d at 200 \n(quoting  Turner  v.  Safley,  482  U.S.  78,  89-92  (1987)).    When  applying  these \nfactors, the court must “respect the determinations of prison officials.”  United \n-6- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 41   Filed 03/20/17   Page 6 of 11   Pageid#: 422\n\nStates v. Stotts, 925 F.2d 83, 86 (4th Cir. 1991).  The burden of proof under the \nTurner analysis is on the prisoner to disprove the validity of the prison regulation \nat issue.  See Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 126, 132 (2003). \n \n  In order to establish a right under the Free Exercise Clause, Greenhill must \nmake two threshold showings before turning to the rational basis test.  First, he \nmust show that he sincerely holds his religious beliefs.  See Wisconsin v. Yoder, \n406 U.S. 205, 214-16 (1972).  Second, Greenhill must show that his claims are \nrooted in religious belief and are not “purely secular.”  Yoder, 406 U.S. at 215.  If \nGreenhill can make these two threshold showings, he then must show that the free \nexercise  of  his  religion  is  substantially  burdened  by  the  government  policy  or \naction at issue.  See Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963)  \n \n  RLUIPA requires a “more searching standard of review … than the standard \nused in parallel constitutional claims: strict scrutiny instead of reasonableness.”  \nLovelace, 472 F.3d at 186 (internal quotations omitted).  Section 3 of RLUIPA \nprovides that “[n]o government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious \nexercise  of  a  person  residing  in  or  confined  to  an  institution  …  unless  the \ngovernment demonstrates that imposition of the burden … (1) is in furtherance of a \ncompelling  governmental  interest;  and  (2)  is  the  least  restrictive  means  of \nfurthering  that  compelling  governmental  interest.”    42  U.S.C.A.  §  2000cc-1(a) \n(West 2012).  The term “government” as used in § 2000cc-1 is defined broadly to \ninclude: “(i) a State, county, municipality, or other governmental entity created \nunder the authority of a State; (ii) any branch, department, agency, instrumentality, \nor official of an entity listed in clause (i); and (iii) any other person acting under \ncolor  of  State  law[.]”    42  U.S.C.A.  §  2000cc-5(4)(A)  (West  2012).    RLUIPA \ndefines religious exercise as “any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled \n-7- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 41   Filed 03/20/17   Page 7 of 11   Pageid#: 423\n\nby, or central to, a system of religious belief.”  42 U.S.C.A. § 2000cc-5(7)(A) \n(West  2012).    “If  a  plaintiff  produces  prima  facie  evidence”  of  a  RLUIPA \nviolation, “the government shall bear the burden of persuasion on any element of \nthe claim, except that the plaintiff shall bear the burden of persuasion on whether \nthe law (including a regulation) or government practice that is challenged by the \nclaim substantially burdens the plaintiff’s exercise of religion.”  42 U.S.C.A. § \n2000cc-2(b) (West 2012).   \n \n  As under the First Amendment, although prison officials may not question \nthe  truth  of  an  inmate’s  belief,  an  inmate  must  demonstrate  that  the  belief  is \nsincerely  held  in  order  to  establish  a  protected  right  under  RLUIPA.    See \nMcManus, 2006 WL 753017, at *5 (citing Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 725 \nn.13 (2005)).  Under both the First Amendment and RLUIPA, an inmate also must \nshow  that  his  right  to  the  free  exercise  of  his  religion  has  been  “substantially \nburdened.”  McManus, 2006 WL 753017, at *5 (quoting Hernandez v. Comm’r of \nInternal Revenue, 490 U.S. 680, 699 (1989)); see also 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a).  \nRLUIPA does not define “substantial burden.”  However, the Fourth Circuit has \nheld that a “substantial burden” on religious exercise occurs when a state or local \ngovernment, through act or omission, puts substantial pressure on an adherent to \nmodify his behavior and to violate his beliefs or one that forces a person to choose \nbetween following the precepts of his religion and forfeiting governmental benefits \non the one hand, and abandoning one of the precepts of his religion on the other \nhand.    See  Lovelace,  472  F.3d  at  187  (internal  quotation  omitted);  see  also \nSherbert, 374 U.S. at 404.  Furthermore, this court previously has held that “[n]o \nsubstantial burden occurs if the government action merely makes the ‘religious \nexercise more expensive or difficult’ or inconvenient, but does not pressure the \nadherent to violate his or her religious beliefs or abandon one of the precepts of his \n-8- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 41   Filed 03/20/17   Page 8 of 11   Pageid#: 424\n\nor her religion.” Marron v. Miller, 2014 WL 2879745, at *2 (W.D. Va. June 24, \n2014) (citing Smith v. Allen, 502 F.3d 1255, 1278 (11th Cir. 2007); Living Water \nChurch of God v. Charter Tp. of Meridian, 258 F. App’x 729, 739 (6th Cir. 2007)). \n \n  The defendants do not contest Greenhill’s assertion that he is a practicing \nSufi Muslim who must observe Jum’ah every Friday, and there is nothing in the \nrecord  before  the  court  to  suggest  that  Greenhill  does  not  sincerely  hold  this \nreligious belief. To be entitled to preliminary injunctive relief, however, Greenhill \nalso must show that he is likely to prevail on his claim that the free exercise of his \nreligious  beliefs  has  been  substantially  burdened.  Greenhill  seeks  preliminary \ninjunctive relief ordering the defendants to provide him with “the means to visually \naccess Jum’ah.” It is important to note that Greenhill conceded in his Complaint \nthat Red Onion broadcasts a video recording of Jum’ah services every Friday. He \nalso conceded that segregation prisoners who own a television were able to view \nthe  broadcast  of  Jum’ah  services.  Greenhill  also  conceded  that  Red  Onion \nprisoners may purchase a personal television from the prison commissary for use \nin  their  cells.  Nonetheless,  Greenhill  asserted  that,  because  he  is  indigent  and \ncannot afford to purchase a television, the defendants have denied him the right to \nvisually access Jum’ah. Thus, the facts alleged by Greenhill, himself, show that the \ngovernment action complained of here merely makes Greenhill’s exercise of his \nreligious beliefs more expensive or difficult; the action does not pressure Greenhill \nto violate his religious beliefs or abandon one of the precepts of his religion.  \n \n  I further note that the defendants also have produced evidence that it is \nGreenhill’s own action in refusing to participate in the Step-Down Program that \nprevents him from being transferred from segregation to a housing unit where he \ncould receive a prison job and earn money to purchase a television. Also, the \n-9- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 41   Filed 03/20/17   Page 9 of 11   Pageid#: 425\n\ndefendants have produced evidence that Greenhill may freely practice his religion \nin his segregation cell in other ways, including requesting a visit from a chaplain to \nparticipate in private worship. \n \nBased on the above reasons, I find that it is unlikely that Greenhill can \ndemonstrate that the defendants’ actions have placed a substantial burden on the \nfree exercise of his religious beliefs. That being the case, I also find that he has \nfailed to show that it is likely he will prevail on the merits of either his First \nAmendment claim or his RLUIPA claim. Therefore, I will recommend that the \ncourt deny Greenhill’s request for preliminary injunctive relief. \n \n    PROPOSED FINDINGS OF FACTS AND \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n   \nAs supplemented by the above summary and analysis, the undersigned now \nsubmits the following formal findings, conclusions and recommendations: \n \n1.  It  is  unlikely  that  Greenhill  can  demonstrate  that  the  defendants’ \nactions placed a substantial burden on his right to freely exercise his \nreligious beliefs; \n2.  Therefore, Greenhill has failed to show that he will likely prevail on \nhis First Amendment claim or his RLUIPA claim; and \n3.  The court should deny Greenhill’s request for entry of preliminary \ninjunctive relief. \n \nRECOMMENDED DISPOSITION \n \n  Based on the above-stated reasons, I recommend the court deny the Motions \nrequesting preliminary injunctive relief.  \n   \n-10- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 41   Filed 03/20/17   Page 10 of 11   Pageid#: 426\n\nNotice to Parties  \n \nNotice  is  hereby  given  to  the  parties  of  the  provisions  of  28  U.S.C.  § \n636(b)(1)(C): \n \nWithin fourteen days after being served with a copy [of this Report \nand  Recommendation],  any  party  may  serve  and  file  written \nobjections  to  such  proposed  findings  and  recommendations  as \nprovided by rules of court.

Cahill and Mary Grace \nMiller, Office of the Attorney General, Richmond, Virginia, for Defendants. \n \n  The plaintiff, Alfonza Hardy Greenhill, a Virginia inmate proceeding pro se, \nfiled this civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Religious Land Use \nand Institutionalized Persons Act (“RLUIPA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc to 2000cc-5.  \nGreenhill  asserts  that  restrictive  living  conditions  in  long-term  administrative \nsegregation interfere with his ability to exercise his sincere religious beliefs related \nto group religious services, wearing a four-inch beard, and maintaining a religious \ndiet.    After  review  of  the  record,  I  conclude  that  the  defendants’  Motion  for \nSummary Judgment must be granted in part and denied in part. \nI. \nGreenhill is serving a fifteen-year prison term in the custody of the Virginia \nDepartment of Corrections (“VDOC”) for convictions including assault, robbery, \n \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 53   Filed 12/15/17   Page 1 of 15   Pageid#: 459\n\nand firearms offenses.  He is currently assigned to Red Onion State Prison (“Red \nOnion”).  Red Onion and its sister facility, Wallens Ridge State Prison (“Wallens \nRidge”), house all “Level S” inmates,  reserved for inmates who must be managed \nin a segregation setting.1  Once in this status, a Level S inmate may participate in \nthe Segregation Reduction Step-Down Program, designed to “create a pathway for \noffenders to step-down from Security level S to lower security levels in a manner \nthat maintains public, staff and offender safety.”  Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J., \nDuncan Aff. Enclosure B, Operating Procedure (“OP”) 830.A(I), ECF No. 26-1.   \nThe  Step  Down  Program  is  goal-oriented.    When  inmates  succeed  in \ncompleting the established goals in each stage of the procedure, they are rewarded \nby moving to the next step and earning its additional privileges.  An inmate’s status \non a step-down pathway is formally reviewed every ninety days by the Institutional \nClassification Authority (“ICA”).  At the most restrictive level of the inmate’s \nassigned pathway, he cannot attend group religious services, possess a television in \nhis cell, or hold a job.  If he completes certain goals of the Step Down Program, \nhowever, he may be assigned to less restrictive steps and earn back privileges, \nincluding the ability to have a paid job and use a personal television in his cell. \n                                                           \n1    According  to  the  current  VDOC  operating  procedure  for  security  level \nclassification  available  online  at  http://www.vadoc.virginia.gov/about/procedures, \ninmates are classified to Level S based on various qualifying history of serious prison \nconduct, including violence and gang activity  \n-2- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 53   Filed 12/15/17   Page 2 of 15   Pageid#: 460\n\nAfter  Greenhill  arrived  at  Red  Onion  in  February  2013,  the  ICA \nrecommended him for assignment to the Structured Living Phase 1 pod.  In this \nstatus under OP 830.A, inmates can have jobs and use a television in their cells, \namong other privileges.  Greenhill refused to participate in the Step Down Program \nat that time, and as a result, he was assigned to the most restrictive step of the \nSpecial Management pathway, known as SM-0 status.  In May 2014 Greenhill was \nassigned to the Secure Integration Pod Phase 1, where the privileges again included \njob possibilities and possessing a television in one’s cell.  In September 2015 \nhowever,  Greenhill  was  returned  to  SM-0  status  after  he  had  incurred  ten \ninstitutional disciplinary charges during the previous two years.   \nGreenhill states that he has been a Muslim since 2000.  He asserts that his \nMuslim faith requires him to participate in a weekly Jum’ah service with at least \nthree other Muslims.  He also contends that he cannot perform Jum’ah alone or \nwith  Red  Onion’s  Christian  chaplain.    As  a  Level  S  inmate,  Greenhill  cannot \nphysically  attend  Jum’ah  group  services.    The  prison  broadcasts  a  videotaped \nversion of Jum’ah that Level S inmates with personal televisions may watch once \nthey have progressed beyond SM-0 status.  Greenhill does not own a television and \nis classified at SM-0 status, so he cannot use a television or work to earn money \ntoward purchasing one.  No communal televisions are made available to Level S.   \n-3- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 53   Filed 12/15/17   Page 3 of 15   Pageid#: 461\n\nGreenhill also states that his Muslim faith requires him to grow and keep his \nbeard trimmed to the length of his fist, or about four inches long.  The VDOC’s \ngrooming policy, OP 864.1, requires inmates to keep their beards trimmed to no \nlonger than one-quarter inch.  Since at least October 2015 Greenhill has worn his \nbeard  longer  than  allowed  under  OP  864.1.    All  violators  of  this  policy  must \nremain in segregated confinement unless they meet qualifications for transfer to the \nGrooming Policy Violators Housing Unit (“VHU”), a unit designated for special \nmanagement of male inmates not in compliance with OP 864.1.  At the time of this \nlawsuit,  for  eligibility  to  seek  transfer  to  the  VHU,  Greenhill  was  required  to \ncomplete the Challenge Series, serve a minimum of six months in segregation, and \nremain free of disciplinary charges for three to six months. \nGreenhill receives the Common Fare diet that is comprised of halal foods \nconsistent  with  his  Muslim  dietary  beliefs.    At  mealtimes,  officers  place  his \nCommon Fare meal tray in the security box attached to his door so that he can \nretrieve the meal through the tray slot.  Greenhill contends that the security box \ncontaminates his meals, because at other times, he must place dirty clothes, shoes, \nand used cleaning materials in the box.   \nGreenhill  filed  this  lawsuit  in  early  2016  against  three  VDOC  officials:  \nHarold  Clarke,  Director;  A.  David  Robinson,  Chief  of  Operations;  and  Earl \nBarksdale,  Warden  of  Red  Onion.    The  suit  seeks  monetary  damages  and \n-4- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 53   Filed 12/15/17   Page 4 of 15   Pageid#: 462\n\npermanent injunctive relief.2  He contends that the defendants should adjust prison \npolicies  to  accommodate  his  religious  practices  by  allowing  him  to  view  the \nweekly Jum’ah service on a communal television in the pod area, in a nearby \nclassroom  or  in  person;  by  permitting  him  to  maintain  a  four-inch-long  beard \nwithout remaining in segregation; and by serving Common Fare meals in a manner \nthat  does  not  contaminate  the  serving  trays.    The  defendants  have  moved  for \nsummary  judgment,  and  Greenhill  has  responded,  making  the  motion  ripe  for \ndisposition.  \nII. \nA.  Standard of Review. \nA court should grant summary judgment “if the movant shows that there is \nno genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as \na matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). “As to materiality . . . [o]nly disputes over \nfacts  that  might  affect  the  outcome  of  the  suit  under  the  governing  law  will \nproperly preclude the entry of summary judgment.”  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, \nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  A dispute about a material fact is genuine “if the \n                                                           \n2    I  have  already  twice  denied  Greenhill’s  separate  motions  for  preliminary \ninjunction.  See Greenhill v. Clarke, No. 7:16CV00068, 2017 WL 1929669 (W.D. Va. \nMay 10, 2017) (Jum’ah), aff’d, Greenhill v. Clarke, 699 F. App’x 280 (4th Cir. 2017) \n(unpublished); Greenhill v. Clarke, No. 7:16CV00068, 2016 WL 1179225 (W.D. Va. \nMar. 23, 2016),  aff’d in part regarding the grooming policy and halal food service \nclaims, remanded as to Jum’ah claim, No. 16-6542, 2016 WL 7414198 (4th Cir. Dec. 22, \n2016) (unpublished). \n-5- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 53   Filed 12/15/17   Page 5 of 15   Pageid#: 463\n\nevidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving \nparty.”    Id.    I  must  draw  all  reasonable  inferences  from  the  facts  in  favor  of \nGreenhill, the nonmoving party.  Williams v. Staples, Inc., 372 F.3d 662, 667 (4th \nCir. 2004).  \nB.  First Amendment Claims. \nUnder the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, prison officials \nmust reasonably accommodate an inmate’s exercise of his sincerely held religious \nbeliefs.  O’Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 350 (1987).  To prove a \nviolation of this right, an inmate must first state facts sufficient to show that the \nchallenged prison regulation substantially burdens his right to free exercise of a \nsincerely held religious belief.  Lovelace v. Lee, 472 F.3d 174, 187 (4th Cir. 2006).  \nIn this context, “a substantial burden is one that puts substantial pressure on an \nadherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.”  Id. (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted). \nBecause  “courts  are  ill  equipped  to  deal  with  the  increasingly  urgent \nproblems  of  prison  administration,”  Procunier  v.  Martinez,  416  U.S.  396,  405 \n(1974), they  must defer to the expertise of prison officials in crafting policies \naddressing those problems, such as security, discipline, and efficient use of limited \nresources;  therefore,  a  prison  regulation  that  substantially  burdens  inmates’ \nreligious practices is, nevertheless, “valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate \n-6- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 53   Filed 12/15/17   Page 6 of 15   Pageid#: 464\n\npenological  interests.”    Id.  at  199  (quoting  Turner  v.  Safley,  482  U.S.  78,  89 \n(1987).  This determination turns on a four-factor test: (1) “whether there is a valid, \nrational connection between the prison regulation” and the asserted government \ninterest; (2) whether Greenhill was “deprived of all forms of religious exercise or \nwhether [he was] able to participate in other observances of [his] faith; (3) what \nimpact the desired accommodation would have on security staff, inmates, and the \nallocation  of  prison  resources;  and  (4)  “whether  there  exist  any  obvious,  easy \nalternatives to the challenged regulation.”  Id. at 200 (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted). \nThe defendants do not challenge the sincerity of Greenhill’s Muslim beliefs.  \nRather, they argue that Greenhill’s First Amendment claims fail under the four-\nfactor Turner test and/or the substantial burden requirement.  I agree. \nGiven the violent, disruptive histories of the inmates classified to Level S, \nRed Onion officials clearly have legitimate security interests that are furthered by \nkeeping  Level  S  inmates  physically  separate  from  each  other  and  from  other \ninmates.  See Morrison v. Garraghty, 239 F.3d 648, 660 (4th Cir. 2001) (“Without \nquestion, prison safety and security is a legitimate, indeed compelling, penological \ninterest.”).  The defendants also assert that the VDOC has a legitimate penological \ninterest  in the success of  the  Step  Down  Program  to  maintain  order,  motivate \ninmates to reduce disruptive and dangerous behaviors, and promote the successful \n-7- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 53   Filed 12/15/17   Page 7 of 15   Pageid#: 465\n\nre-entry  of  a  Level  S  inmate  post-incarceration.    They  contend  that  current \nrestrictions  on  SM-0  inmates’  privileges,  including  the  television  ban,  are \nrationally related to and further this interest by maintaining incentives for inmates \nto participate in the Step-Down Program.  I so find. \nMoreover,  I  also find  that  Greenhill  can  practice his  religious beliefs  in \nmany ways other than group service participation.  As consistent with his religious \nbeliefs, he may engage in personal study of religious texts and prayer in his cell, he \nreceives Common Fare meals, and he may grow his beard.  Finally, I find that \nGreenhill fails to demonstrate any readily available alternative means to provide \nthe  requested  Jum’ah  access  and  accomplish  the  purposes  of  the  step-down \nprogram to the same extent without additional financial and staffing costs.  Thus, I \nconclude that the defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Greenhill’s First \nAmendment claim that SM-0 regulations violate his free exercise right related to \ngroup religious services. \nSimilarly,  the  VDOC’s  quarter-inch  beard  limit  meets  the  factors  of  the \nTurner test.  This court has held that the current VDOC grooming policy on beard \nlength is reasonably related to legitmate prison security interests.  See Bayadi v. \nClarke, No. 7:15CV00618, 2017 WL 4248522, at *8 (W.D. Va. Sept. 25, 2017) \n(Moon, J.).  In the Bayadi case, the court found that: \nBayadi does not show that it is unreasonable for the VDOC to prohibit \ninmates from growing beards of indeterminate length while housed in \n-8- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 53   Filed 12/15/17   Page 8 of 15   Pageid#: 466\n\ngeneral population.  There is a “valid, rational connection” between \nregulating beard length and defendants’ explanations about security \nand  sanitation.  See  Lovelace,  472  F.3d  at  182,  190  (stating \n“emphatically that any substantive explanation offered by the prison \nmust  be  viewed  with  due  deference”).  .  .  .  [T]he  government  has \nlegitimate  penological  interests  in  identification  of  inmates, \npreventing the spread of contraband, and inmate hygiene.  There is a \nrational connection between OP 864.1’s beard length restrictions and \nthese  interests.  .  .  .  [I]t  is  Bayadi’s  burden  to  disprove  the \nreasonableness of these regulations — and he has not done so. \n \nId.   I find the reasoning in Bayadi to be persuasive.  As such, I also find that the \ndefendants in this case have satisfied the rational relationship aspect of the Turner \nstandard.  Greenhill is able to maintain his beard at the desired length and to \npractice other aspects of his religious beliefs.  Finally, he fails to show any easy \nalternatives to address to the same extent the security concerns presented by his \nfour-inch beard.  Therefore, I will grant summary judgment for the defendants on \nGreenhill’s First Amendment claim regarding his beard. \n  I also find no merit to Greenhill’s First Amendment claim that current tray \nbox procedures violate his religious dietary practices.  The defendants’ undisputed \nevidence is that each inmate is responsible for keeping his tray box clean as part of \nhis cell.  An inmate receives two sponges for cell cleaning, replaced as needed \nupon request.  Once each week, he is also provided cleaning chemicals.  Greenhill \ncomplains that this cleaning system does not meet Muslim standards that require \nany item touching food to be rinsed three times in clean water.  He proposes that \n-9- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 53   Filed 12/15/17   Page 9 of 15   Pageid#: 467\n\nofficials should use portable tray boxes and maintain one to be used only for halal \nmeals. \n  The defendants’ refusal to follow Greenhill’s portable box proposal does not \nviolate the First Amendment.  First, Greenhill fails to show any substantial burden \non his religious dietary beliefs.  The two sponges provided allow Greenhill to \nreserve one sponge to clean his tray box after every transaction, while using the \nother  sponge  for  cleaning  other  parts  of  his  cell.    Prison  practices  do  not \nsubstantially burden an inmate’s rights if they merely make his “religious exercise \nmore  expensive  or  difficult,”  but  fail  to  pressure  the  adherent  to  violate  his \nreligious beliefs or abandon one of the precepts of his religion.  Living Water \nChurch of God v. Charter Twp. of Meridian, 258 F. App’x 729, 739 (6th Cir. \n2007).  Second, the two sponge practice meets the Turner test factors.  It clearly \nfurthers  the  prison’s  interests  in  keeping  costs  low  and  teaching  inmates \nresponsibility.    Greenhill  may  comply  with  his  dietary  beliefs  by  eating  his \nCommon Fare meals and keeping his tray box clean himself, and he has presented \nno easy alternatives that would both accommodate his concerns over cleanliness \nand further prison interests to a similar extent.  Finding no genuine material fact in \ndispute, I will grant the defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment on this claim. \nFinally, I will grant the defendants’ motion as to Greenhill’s complaint that \nthe  defendants’  failure  to  provide  a  communal  television  for  Level  S  inmates \n-10- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 53   Filed 12/15/17   Page 10 of 15   Pageid#: 468\n\nviolates OP 830.A, the Step Down procedure.3  State officials’ failure to abide by \nstate procedural regulations is not a federal due process issue, and is, therefore, not \nactionable under § 1983.  Riccio v. Cty. of Fairfax, 907 F.2d 1459, 1469 (4th Cir. \n1990) (“If state law grants more procedural rights than the Constitution would \notherwise require, a state’s failure to abide by that law is not a federal due process \nissue.”); see also United States v. Caceres, 440 U.S. 741, 751-52 (1979) (where a \ngovernment agency is not constitutionally required to adopt certain regulations, a \nviolation of those regulations, without more, does not “raise any constitutional \nquestions”). \nC.  RLUIPA Claims. \nRLUIPA  provides  federal  statutory  protection  of  prisoners’  religious \nexercise under a stricter legal standard: “RLUIPA prohibits [state] prisons from \nimposing  a  substantial  burden  on  an  inmate’s  religious  exercise  unless  prison \nofficials  can  demonstrate  that  the  burden  furthers  a  compelling  governmental \ninterest by the least restrictive means.”  Miles v. Moore, 450 F. App’x 318, 319 \n(4th  Cir.  2011)  (unpublished)  (citing  42  U.S.C.  §  2000cc-1(a)).    A  RLUIPA \nanalysis  consists  of  two  steps.    First,  the  inmate  “bears  the  initial  burden  to \ndemonstrate  that  the  prison’s  policy  exacts  a  substantial  burden  on  religious \n                                                           \n3  Appendix G to OP 830.A indicates that inmates at all levels of the SM pathway \nwill be provided with a television to watch education and religious programming.  Mem. \nSupp. Mot. Summ. J., Duncan Aff. Enclosure B, ECF No. 26-1. \n-11- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 53   Filed 12/15/17   Page 11 of 15   Pageid#: 469\n\nexercise.”  Incumaa v. Stirling, 791 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir. 2015).  For purposes of \na RLUIPA claim, “a substantial burden on religious exercise occurs when a state or \nlocal  government,  through  act  or  omission,  ‘put[s]  substantial  pressure  on  an \nadherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.’”  Lovelace, 472 F.3d at \n187 (quoting Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Emp’t Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 718 \n(1981)).    Only  if  the  inmate  proves  that  there  is  a  substantial  burden  on  his \nreligious practice, does “the burden shift[] to the government to prove its policy \nfurthers  a  compelling  governmental  interest  by  the  least  restrictive  means.”  \nIncumaa, 791 F.3d at 525. \nGreenhill raises all three of his claims under RLUIPA as well as the First \nAmendment.  All of Greenhill’s claims under RLUIPA fail to the extent that he \nseeks monetary damages, because such relief is not available under RLUIPA.  See, \ne.g.,  Sossamon  v.  Texas,  563  U.S.  277,  285-86  (2011)  (finding  damages  not \nrecoverable  against  defendants  in  their  official  capacities  under  RLUIPA); \nRendelman v. Rouse, 569 F.3d 182, 189 (4th Cir. 2009) (finding no RLUIPA claim \nfor  damages  available  against  defendants  in  their  individual  capacities).    In \naddition, I conclude that Greenhill’s third claim, regarding tray box cleanliness, \nfails under the substantial burden facet of the RLUIPA standard, just as in the First \nAmendment  analysis.    Therefore,  I  will  grant  summary  judgment  for  the \ndefendants on the tray box claim and on all claims for monetary damages.  \n-12- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 53   Filed 12/15/17   Page 12 of 15   Pageid#: 470\n\nThe  defendants  argue  that  they  are  entitled  to  summary  judgment  on \nGreenhill’s beard length claim under a prior decision of this court, Coleman v. \nJabe, No. 7:11CV518, 2014 WL 2040097 (W.D. Va. May 16, 2014) (upholding \nVDOC grooming policy under RLUIPA).  The defendants also argue for summary \njudgment on Greenhill’s claim concerning his inability as a Level S inmate to \nparticipate in Jum’ah services, based on their contention that he fails to show how \nthe VDOC policies at issue have substantially burdened his religious practice.   \nThe defendants contend that prison officials have provided an avenue for \nLevel S inmates who are Muslim to participate in Jum’ah by participating in the \nStep Down Program to achieve greater privilege levels where they can work to \nearn money to buy a television, and thereby participate in the Jum’ah broadcast.  \nThey also argue that Level S inmates who also refuse to comply with the VDOC \ngrooming standards have the potential for transfer to the VHU.   \nGreenhill  states,  however,  that  “[u]ntil  [he]  complies  with  the  VDOC’s \nbeard length limitation (which is something he has vowed to Allah never to do), he \nwill not be permitted to attain institutional employment” to purchase a television.  \nCompl. 3, ECF No. 1.  He also asserts that his failure to comply with the beard \ngrooming  requirements  will  prevent  him  from  progressing  in  the  Step  Down \nProgram as he must do to become eligible for transfer to the VHU.  See Greenhill \nDecl. 3, ECF No. 31.  Greenhill also points out the absence of evidence in the \n-13- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 53   Filed 12/15/17   Page 13 of 15   Pageid#: 471\n\nrecord that even if he were transferred to the VHU, he would be able to participate \nin Jum’ah.  The defendants have not addressed these facts and arguments, and I \nfind them critical to any determination of Greenhill’s remaining RLUIPA claims.  I \nalso note that the Bayadi decision, issued after the defendants filed their motion, \ndenied  summary  judgment  for  prison  officials  on  these  same  claims,  in \ncontravention of the defendants’ reliance here on the Coleman decision.  For these \nreasons,  I  will  deny  the  defendants’  motion  as  to  Greenhill’s  RLUIPA  claims \nregarding the beard length policy and the policies affecting his ability to participate \nin  Jum’ah.    I  will,  however,  grant  the  defendants  an  opportunity  to  submit  a \nsupplemental motion for summary judgment. \nIII. \nIn  accordance  with  the  foregoing,  it  is  ORDERED  that  the  defendants’ \nMotion  for  Summary  Judgment  (ECF  No.  25)  is  GRANTED  IN  PART  AND \nDENIED  IN  PART.  The  motion  is  DENIED  as  to  Greenhill’s  claims  under \nRLUIPA  against the  defendants  in  their  official  capacities  for  injunctive  relief \nregarding beard length and Jum’ah participation and the motion is GRANTED as \nto all other claims. The defendants are granted leave to file a supplemental motion \nfor summary judgment within 28 days of the date of entry of this Opinion and \nOrder or the matter will be set for trial.  \n-14- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 53   Filed 12/15/17   Page 14 of 15   Pageid#: 472\n\n              ENTER:   December 15, 2017 \n \n              /s/  James P.

Harold Clarke \n \n \n7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB  \n________________________ \n \nNOTICE OF JUDGMENT \n________________________ \nJudgment was entered on this date in accordance with Fed. R. App. P. 36. Please be \nadvised of the following time periods: \n \nPETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI: To be timely, a petition for certiorari \nmust be filed in the United States Supreme Court within 90 days of this court's entry of \njudgment. The time does not run from issuance of the mandate. If a petition for panel \nor en banc rehearing is timely filed, the time runs from denial of that petition. Review \non writ of certiorari is not a matter of right, but of judicial discretion, and will be \ngranted only for compelling reasons. (www.supremecourt.gov) \n \nVOUCHERS FOR PAYMENT OF APPOINTED OR ASSIGNED COUNSEL: \nVouchers must be submitted within 60 days of entry of judgment or denial of \nrehearing, whichever is later. If counsel files a petition for certiorari, the 60-day period \nruns from filing the certiorari petition. (Loc. R. 46(d)). If payment is being made from \nCJA funds, counsel should submit the CJA 20 or CJA 30 Voucher through the CJA \neVoucher system. In cases not covered by the Criminal Justice Act, counsel should \nsubmit the Assigned Counsel Voucher to the clerk's office for payment from the \nAttorney Admission Fund. An Assigned Counsel Voucher will be sent to counsel \nshortly after entry of judgment. Forms and instructions are also available on the court's \nweb site, www.ca4.uscourts.gov, or from the clerk's office.  \n \nBILL OF COSTS: A party to whom costs are allowable, who desires taxation of \ncosts, shall file a Bill of Costs within 14 calendar days of entry of judgment. (FRAP \n39, Loc. R. 39(b)). \n \n \n \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-7300      Doc: 81-1            Filed: 12/06/2019      Pg: 2 of 3 Total Pages:(2 of 5)\nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-PMS   Document 68   Filed 12/06/19   Page 2 of 5   Pageid#: 841\nPETITION FOR REHEARING AND PETITION FOR REHEARING EN \nBANC: A petition for rehearing must be filed within 14 calendar days after entry of \njudgment, except that in civil cases in which the United States or its officer or agency \nis a party, the petition must be filed within 45 days after entry of judgment. A petition \nfor rehearing en banc must be filed within the same time limits and in the same \ndocument as the petition for rehearing and must be clearly identified in the title. The \nonly grounds for an extension of time to file a petition for rehearing are the death or \nserious illness of counsel or a family member (or of a party or family member in pro se \ncases) or an extraordinary circumstance wholly beyond the control of counsel or a \nparty proceeding without counsel.  \n \nEach case number to which the petition applies must be listed on the petition and \nincluded in the docket entry to identify the cases to which the petition applies. A \ntimely filed petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc stays the mandate \nand tolls the running of time for filing a petition for writ of certiorari. In consolidated \ncriminal appeals, the filing of a petition for rehearing does not stay the mandate as to \nco-defendants not joining in the petition for rehearing. In consolidated civil appeals \narising from the same civil action, the court's mandate will issue at the same time in all \nappeals.  \n \nA petition for rehearing must contain an introduction stating that, in counsel's \njudgment, one or more of the following situations exist: (1) a material factual or legal \nmatter was overlooked; (2) a change in the law occurred after submission of the case \nand was overlooked; (3) the opinion conflicts with a decision of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, this court, or another court of appeals, and the conflict was not addressed; or (4) \nthe case involves one or more questions of exceptional importance. A petition for \nrehearing, with or without a petition for rehearing en banc, may not exceed 3900 words \nif prepared by computer and may not exceed 15 pages if handwritten or prepared on a \ntypewriter. Copies are not required unless requested by the court. (FRAP 35 & 40, \nLoc. R. 40(c)). \n \nMANDATE: In original proceedings before this court, there is no mandate. Unless the \ncourt shortens or extends the time, in all other cases, the mandate issues 7 days after \nthe expiration of the time for filing a petition for rehearing. A timely petition for \nrehearing, petition for rehearing en banc, or motion to stay the mandate will stay \nissuance of the mandate. If the petition or motion is denied, the mandate will issue 7 \ndays later. A motion to stay the mandate will ordinarily be denied, unless the motion \npresents a substantial question or otherwise sets forth good or probable cause for a \nstay. (FRAP 41, Loc. R. 41). \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-7300      Doc: 81-1            Filed: 12/06/2019      Pg: 3 of 3 Total Pages:(3 of 5)\nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-PMS   Document 68   Filed 12/06/19   Page 3 of 5   Pageid#: 842\nU.S. COURT OF APPEAL FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT BILL OF COSTS FORM \n(Civil Cases)  \nDirections: Under FRAP 39(a), the costs of appeal in a civil action are generally taxed against appellant if a \njudgment is affirmed or the appeal is dismissed. Costs are generally taxed against appellee if a judgment is \nreversed. If a judgment is affirmed in part, reversed in part, modified, or vacated, costs are taxed as the court \norders. A party who wants costs taxed must, within 14 days after entry of judgment, file an itemized and \nverified bill of costs, as follows:  \n• Itemize any fee paid for docketing the appeal. The fee for docketing a case in the court of appeals is $500 \n(effective 12/1/2013). The $5 fee for filing a notice of appeal is recoverable as a cost in the district court.  \n• Itemize the costs (not to exceed $.15 per page) for copying the necessary number of formal briefs and \nappendices. (Effective 10/1/2015, the court requires 1 copy when filed; 3 more copies when tentatively \ncalendared; 0 copies for service unless brief/appendix is sealed.). The court bases the cost award on the page \ncount of the electronic brief/appendix. Costs for briefs filed under an informal briefing order are not \nrecoverable.  \n• Cite the statutory authority for an award of costs if costs are sought for or against the United States. See 28 \nU.S.C. § 2412 (limiting costs to civil actions); 28 U.S.C. § 1915(f)(1) (prohibiting award of costs against the \nUnited States in cases proceeding without prepayment of fees).  \nAny objections to the bill of costs must be filed within 14 days of service of the bill of costs. Costs are paid \ndirectly to the prevailing party or counsel, not to the clerk's office. \nCase Number & Caption: _____________________________________________________ \nPrevailing Party Requesting Taxation of Costs: ____________________________________ \nAppellate Docketing Fee (prevailing \nAmount Requested: ______  Amount Allowed: _____ \nappellants):  \nPage \nDocument  No. of Pages  No. of Copies  Cost  Total Cost \n(<$.15) \nAllowed   Allowed   Allowed  \n   Requested  Requested     Requested \n(court use only)  (court use only)  (court use only) \n                       \n                       \n                       \nTOTAL BILL OF COSTS:  $0.00  $0.00 \n1.

CLARKE,  ETC., ET AL.,  )       By:  James P. Jones \n    )       United States District Judge \n                            Defendants.  )   \n \nAlfonza Hardy Greenhill, Pro Se Plaintiff; Mary Grace Miller, Assistant \nAttorney General, Office of the Attorney General, Criminal Justice and Public \nSafety Division, Richmond, Virginia, for Defendants. \n \nThis prisoner civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is before me on the \nReport and Recommendation (“Report”) of the magistrate judge pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B) and (C).  The magistrate judge recommends that I should \ndeny the plaintiff’s motions seeking preliminary injunctive relief allowing him to \nparticipate  in  a  weekly  group  religious  service.    The  plaintiff  has  filed timely \nobjections to the Report.  After conducting a de novo review, I will overrule the \nobjections, adopt the Report, and deny Greenhill’s motions for interlocutory relief. \nI. \nIn his Complaint, Greenhill contends that prison officials violated his right \nto  free  exercise  of  his  religious  beliefs  under  the  First  Amendment  and  the \nReligious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (“RLUIPA”).  After I denied \n \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 43   Filed 05/10/17   Page 1 of 5   Pageid#: 437\n\nGreenhill’s  motion  seeking  a  preliminary  injunction,  he  took  an  interlocutory \nappeal.  Greenhill v. Clarke, No. 7:16CV00068, 2016 WL 1179225 (W.D. Va. \nMar.  23,  2016),  aff’d  in  part  and  remanded  in  part,  No.  16-6542,  2016  WL \n7414198 (4th Cir. Dec. 22, 2016) (unpublished).  The court of appeals affirmed \nthis  court’s  denial  of  preliminary  injunctive  relief  as  to  Greenhill’s  claims \nregarding the prison’s grooming policy and process of serving religious meals, but \nremanded the case for further consideration of his contention that the court should \norder prison officials to allow him to participate in Jum’ah, the Islamic Friday \ncongregational service.  I referred the matter to the magistrate judge, resulting in \nthe present Report and Greenhill’s objections to it. \nThe  Report’s  recites  certain  facts  to  which  Greenhill  does  not  object.   \nGreenhill’s sincere religious beliefs require him to be present bodily or visually at \nJum’ah. Greenhill arrived at Red Onion State Prison (“Red Onion”) in 2013. He \nwas  classified  as  a  Security  Level  S  inmate  in  September  2015  after  he  had \nincurred ten institutional disciplinary charges during the previous two years. Level \nS inmates are segregated from other inmates and therefore cannot bodily attend \nJum’ah services. Red Onion broadcasts a videotape of Jum’ah services every week \nfor inmates. There are no communal televisions available to Level S inmates like \nGreenhill.    Level  S  inmates  who  own  a  television  may  view  this  service  but \nGreenhill is indigent and cannot afford to purchase a television, which costs $212 \n-2- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 43   Filed 05/10/17   Page 2 of 5   Pageid#: 438\n\nfrom  the  prison  commissary.  Greenhill  remains  in  Level  S  and  its  restrictive \nconditions because he refuses to participate in the prison’s Step Down Program.  \nII. \nThe magistrate judge makes only a recommendation to this court.  Mathews \nv. Weber, 423 U.S. 261, 270 (1976).  The district judge is charged with making a \nde novo determination of those portions of a report and recommendation to which \na party makes proper objections.  28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1). \n“A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of \nright.”  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  The party \nseeking the preliminary injunction must make a clear showing “that he is likely to \nsucceed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary  relief,  that  the  balance  of  equities  tips  in  his  favor,  and  that  an \ninjunction is in the public interest.”  Id. at 20. \nTo state a viable claim under the First Amendment or RLUIPA, Greenhill \nmust demonstrate that the defendant prison officials’ actions or policies place a \nsubstantial burden on his free exercise of his sincere religious belief.  Thomas v. \nReview Bd. of Ind.  Emp’t Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 718 (1981) (First Amendment); \nLovelace v. Lee, 472 F.3d 174, 185 (4th Cir. 2006) (RLUIPA, 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-\n1(a)).  For purposes of the First Amendment or RLUIPA, a substantial burden on \nreligious exercise occurs when a state action or policy “put[s] substantial pressure \n-3- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 43   Filed 05/10/17   Page 3 of 5   Pageid#: 439\n\non an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.”  Id. at 187 \n(quoting  Thomas,  450  U.S.  at  718).    “No  substantial  burden  occurs  if  the \ngovernment  action  merely  makes  the  ‘religious  exercise  more  expensive  or \ndifficult’ or inconvenient, but does not pressure the adherent to violate his or her \nreligious beliefs or abandon one of the precepts of his or her religion.”  Marron v. \nMiller, No. 7:13CV00338, 2014 WL 2879745, at *2 (W.D. Va. June 24, 2014) \n(citing Smith v. Allen, 502 F.3d 1255, 1278 (11th Cir. 2007); Living Water Church \nof  God  v.  Charter  Twp.  of  Meridian,  258  F.  App’x  729,  739  (6th  Cir.  2007) \n(unpublished)). \nBased upon these principles, the Report concludes that the facts in this case \nare not likely to support a viable claim that the defendants’ policies have prohibited \nGreenhill  from  practicing  Jum’ah  in  segregation;  rather,  the  Report  finds,  the \npolicies  have  merely  made  his  practice  more  inconvenient  or  expensive.    To \npractice his beliefs, he must participate in the Step Down Program to work toward \nleaving segregation and/or purchase a television.   \nThe Report finds that “[i]t is unlikely that Greenhill can demonstrate that the \ndefendants’ actions placed a substantial burden on his right to freely exercise his \nreligious beliefs,” and therefore, he “has failed to show that he will likely prevail \non his First Amendment claim or his RLUIPA claim.” Report 10, ECF No. 41.  \nThe  magistrate  judge  recommends  that  I  deny  Greenhill’s  request  to  grant \n-4- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 43   Filed 05/10/17   Page 4 of 5   Pageid#: 440\n\npreliminary injunctive relief.  Greenhill objects to of these findings and complains \nthat  his  indigence  and  his  inability  to  have  a  prison  job  (because  of  his \nnoncompliance with the beard-grooming policy) prevent him from purchasing a \ntelevision, and in turn, prevent him from practicing Jum’ah, in violation of his \nbeliefs.  These inconvenient or difficult aspects of his problem, however, are not \ncaused  by  the  challenged  Jum’ah  policies.    On  the  contrary,  the  policies \naccommodate inmates’ Jum’ah practice.  Greenhill’s Level S status, caused by his \ndisciplinary  problems,  combined  with  his  financial  status,  prevents  him  from \nparticipating  in  Jum’ah  at  this  time.    Thus,  I  find  that  Greenhill  has  not \ndemonstrated a likelihood of success in proving a defendant-caused, substantial \nburden on his religious practice as required for a successful claim under the First \nAmendment or RLUIPA. \nIII. \nFor the stated reasons, after de novo review of pertinent portions of the \nrecord, it is hereby ORDERED that the plaintiff’s objections, ECF No. 42, are \nOVERRULED;  the  magistrate  judge’s  Report,  ECF  No.  41,  is  hereby \nACCEPTED, and the plaintiff’s motions seeking preliminary relief, ECF Nos. 4 \nand 35, are DENIED. \n              ENTER:  May 10, 2017 \n \n              /s/  James P.

Cahill,  Assistant \nAttorney General, Office of the Attorney General of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia, \nfor Defendants. \n \n  The plaintiff, Alfonza Hardy Greenhill, a Virginia inmate proceeding pro se, \nfiled this civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Religious Land Use \nand Institutionalized Persons Act (“RLUIPA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc to 2000cc-5.  \nBy Opinion and Order entered in this case on December 15, 2017, ECF No. 53, I \ngranted  summary  judgment  for  the  defendant  prison  officials  as  to  certain  of \nGreenhill’s claims.  The matter is now before me on the defendants’ Supplemental \nMotion  for  Summary  Judgment  on  Greenhill’s  remaining  claims  for injunctive \nrelief under RLUIPA regarding his Muslim religious practices of participating in \nweekly group Jum’ah services and wearing a four-inch beard.1  After review of the \n                                                           \n1    The  defendants  are  Harold  Clarke,  Director,  A.  David  Robinson,  Chief  of \nOperations, and Earl Barksdale, former warden.  In support of their motion, they offer \n \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 60   Filed 09/19/18   Page 1 of 19   Pageid#: 791\n\nrecord, I conclude that the defendants’ are entitled to summary judgment as a \nmatter of law. \nI.  BACKGROUND. \nGreenhill  is  in  the  custody  of  the  Virginia  Department  of  Corrections \n(“VDOC”), serving a prison term of fifteen years and forty days.2  He states that he \nhas been a Muslim since 2000.  He asserts that his Muslim faith requires him to \nparticipate in a weekly Jum’ah group religious service with at least three other \nMuslims.  Greenhill also states that his religious beliefs require him to grow and \nkeep his beard trimmed to the length of his fist, or about four inches long.  He has \nclaimed that he is confined in an administrative segregation unit where policies \nprevent him from participating in Jum’ah services, in person or via television.  He \nalso  alleges  that  wearing  a  four-inch  beard,  in  violation  of  prison  grooming \npolicies, will prevent him from  moving to less restrictive conditions  and from \nobtaining a job so he could purchase a television for Jum’ah participation.  He \nclaims  that  the  defendants’  policies  and  actions  under  those  policies  have \nsubstantially burdened his religious practices, and he seeks injunctive relief under \nRLUIPA. \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \naffidavits from Unit Manager Larry Collins and former Unit Manager A. Duncan, with \nsupporting documentation. \n \n2  This summary of facts is taken from the parties’ submissions as a whole and is \nundisputed, except where otherwise noted. \n \n-2- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 60   Filed 09/19/18   Page 2 of 19   Pageid#: 792\n\nA.  Participation in Group Religious Services. \nVDOC  policies  have  established  “protocols  to  provide  reasonable \nopportunities for offenders incarcerated in [VDOC] facilities to voluntarily pursue \nreligious  beliefs  and  practices  subject  to  concerns  regarding  facility  security, \nsafety, order, space, and resources.”  Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 2, Operating \nProcedure (“OP”) 841.3(I), ECF No. 26-2.  Inmates in Security Levels 1 through 5 \n(with Level 1 depicting the lowest measure of security) may attend group religious \nworship services with other inmates, subject to varying degrees of staff monitoring \nbased on inmates’ security levels; time, space, and staffing constraints; and other \nneeds of orderly prison operations.  OP 841.3(IV)(A)(7).  After Greenhill entered \nVDOC custody in 2007, he was assigned to Deep Meadows Correctional Center, a \nSecurity Level 2 facility, and then to Sussex II State Prison, a Level 4 facility.   \nBecause Greenhill was found guilty of a series of institutional disciplinary \ninfractions in 2008, however, he was transferred to Red Onion State Prison (“Red \nOnion”) and was reclassified as a Security Level S.  Level S is a security status \nreserved for inmates who must be managed in a segregation setting, apart from \nother  inmates,  for  reasons  of  security  and  order.3    To  earn  eligibility  for  less \n                                                           \n3  According to the VDOC operating procedure for security level classification, \ninmates  are  classified  to  Level  S  based  on  “segregation  qualifiers,”  including  gang \nactivity or leadership, manipulating staff or displaying predatory behavior, or acts posing \na “threat level too great for the safety and security of a lower level institution.”  See OP \n-3- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 60   Filed 09/19/18   Page 3 of 19   Pageid#: 793\n\nrestrictive classifications, a Level S inmate must complete the various requirements \nof the Segregation Reduction Step-Down Program (“Step-Down Program”) set out \nin VDOC Operating Procedure (“OP”) 830.A.4   \nIn February 2013, when the current Step-Down Program policy took effect, \nthe  Institutional  Classification  Authority  (“ICA”)  at  Red  Onion  recommended \nGreenhill  for  assignment  to  the  Structured  Living  Phase  1  pod,  a  general \npopulation setting rather than segregation.  In this status under OP 830.A, inmates \ncan have jobs and use a television in their cells, among other privileges.  Greenhill \nrefused this general population assignment and remained in segregation, awaiting \nreclassification.  In March 2013, the ICA again reviewed his housing status and \nnoted that he had “advised staff that he would prefer to remain in segregation \nrather than go into a Phase 1 housing assignment.”  Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. \nEx. 1, Duncan Aff. ¶ 10, ECF No. 26-1.   \nUltimately, Greenhill was assigned to SM-0 status, the most restrictive step \nof the  program’s  Special  Management pathway  of the program.    SM  status is \nreserved for inmates with a history of disruptive behavior, fighting, and/or violence \ntoward staff or other inmates for whom reasonable interventions at lower security \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n830.2(IV)(G)(2),  VDOC  Procedures  (Apr.  1,  2018)  https://vadoc.virginia.gov/about/ \nprocedures/ documents/ 800/830-2.pdf. \n \n4  My previous Opinion described Level S and the Step-Down procedures in detail \nand need not be repeated. \n \n-4- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 60   Filed 09/19/18   Page 4 of 19   Pageid#: 794\n\nlevel  facilities  have  not  been  successful  in  eliminating  such  disruptive  and \ndangerous behaviors.  An SM-0 inmate cannot participate in group activities with \nother inmates, possess a personal television in his cell, or hold a job.  In May 2014, \nGreenhill was assigned to the Secure Integration Pod Phase 1, where the privileges \nagain  included  job  possibilities  and  possessing  a  television  in  one’s  cell.    In \nSeptember 2015, after Greenhill had incurred ten institutional disciplinary charges \nin two years, officials reassigned him SM-0 status. \nThe Step-Down Program requires inmates to learn and display new thought \npatterns and social skills.  As they do so, they earn advancement to lower, less \nrestrictive housing assignments and greater privileges, in a manner that maintains \npublic, staff, and inmate safety.  To progress in the program and attain SM-1 \nstatus, Greenhill must complete designated portions of the seven workbooks in the \nChallenge Series, which teach positive thinking patterns.  He must also remain free \nof disciplinary charges and earn good weekly behavior ratings in cell maintenance, \npersonal hygiene, standing for count, and respect.  When an inmate incurs new \ndisciplinary charges or continually fails to meet positive behavior goals, evaluators \nmay find that he has not learned the intended lessons and require him to remain in \nhis current step or start the program anew. \nSince his assignment to SM-0 in September 2015, Greenhill has incurred \nnine additional institutional disciplinary charges.  He has, at times, participated in \n-5- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 60   Filed 09/19/18   Page 5 of 19   Pageid#: 795\n\nthe Step-Down Program, and he completed the Orientation Book of the Challenge \nSeries on November 15, 2017.  A month later, however, Greenhill incurred another \ndisciplinary charge for tampering with a security device.  At the time the parties \nfiled the pleadings currently before me for review, in January and February 2018, \nGreenhill remained at SM-0 status. \nLike all segregation status inmates, Level S inmates cannot congregate with \nother inmates, even for religious services.  A Level S inmate who has progressed \nbeyond SM-0 status to SM-1 or SM-2, however, can participate in the weekly \nJum’ah group religious service via a closed circuit television broadcast.  Greenhill \ndoes not own a personal television, and the Step-Down Program pods are not \nequipped with closed circuit televisions for inmates’ use.  Greenhill has asked \nprison officials to provide him with a television for Jum’ah purposes only — in his \ncell, in the pod, or in a nearby classroom.  Although the defendants admit that \nofficials could physically provide any of these accommodations to Greenhill, they \nhave denied his requests because of his security level and housing assignment to \nSM-0.   \nInstead,  officials  have  advised  Greenhill  to  remain  infraction  free  and \nparticipate consistently in the Step-Down Program requirements to earn eligibility \nfor  advancement  past  SM-0.    When  he  achieves  SM-1  or  SM-2,  he  can  be \nconsidered for a paid job and save money toward purchasing a personal television \n-6- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 60   Filed 09/19/18   Page 6 of 19   Pageid#: 796\n\nset from the commissary for $212.  According to the unit managers, the Step-Down \nProgram procedures use television access as a motivational tool.  Only inmates in \nSM-0 or IM-0 (the lowest step in the Intensive Management pathway of the Step-\nDown Program) are denied television access.  “There are incentives built into the \nStep-Down Program which we hope will motivate the offenders to participate and \nwork  toward  long-term  behavioral  changes,  new  thought  patterns  and  social \nskills.”  Duncan Aff. ¶ 13, ECF No. 26-1.  “An offender’s ability to possess a \ntelevision inside his cell is a privilege that most inmates covet, and it is one of the \nbiggest  motivators  for  encouraging  offenders  to  participate  in  the  Step-Down \nprogram.”  Collins Aff. ¶ 10, ECF No. 55-1.   \nB.  Beard Length Policies. \nThe  VDOC  grooming  policy,  OP  864.1(I),  establishes  uniform  personal \ngrooming standards for inmates “to facilitate the identification of offenders and to \npromote safety, security, and sanitation.”  Id. at Enclosure D.  “Hair styles and \nbeards that could conceal contraband, promote identification with gangs, create a \nhealth, hygiene, or sanitation hazard, or that could significantly compromise the \nability to identify an offender are not allowed.”  Id. at ¶ 13.  The policy now \nrequires inmates to keep their beards trimmed to no longer than half an inch.  \n  When  an  inmate  becomes  noncompliant  with  the  OP  864.1  grooming \nrequirements, he will be ordered to comply.  If he refuses, he will be charged with \n-7- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 60   Filed 09/19/18   Page 7 of 19   Pageid#: 797\n\na policy offense, and receive disciplinary procedural protections required by the \nVDOC’s disciplinary policy.  No inmate will receive more than one grooming \ncharge  for  each  separate  violation  incident,  and  all  inmates  who  remain \nnoncompliant with grooming standards will stay in segregated housing until they \ndo comply.  As of November 6, 2017, a Level S inmate participating in the Step-\nDown Program who refuses to comply with VDOC grooming standards on the \nbasis of religious principles will receive only one charge and “will not receive a \n‘poor’ in the personal hygiene category” of the weekly behavior ratings.  Id. at ¶ \n16.   \nAs  OP 864.1 now  stands,  an inmate  “is  not prevented from  progressing \nthrough the Step-Down Program for refusing to comply with the grooming policy \ndue to his religious beliefs.”  Id.  If he participates in that program and earns \nassignment to a less restrictive step, he can be considered for a pod job without \nshaving his beard.  He “is not required to shave his beard in order to obtain a pod \njob.”  Id. at ¶ 12. \nFurthermore, inmates who are noncompliant with OP 864.1 hair and beard \nrestrictions  for  religious  reasons  may  qualify  for  assignment  to  the  Grooming \nPolicy Violators Housing Unit (“VHU”).5  The VHU is a special management \nhousing unit, but allows its inmates privileges that Level S inmates do not have.  \n                                                           \n  5  The VHU is actually located at the nearby Wallens Ridge State Prison, a similar \nhigh security prison. \n-8- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 60   Filed 09/19/18   Page 8 of 19   Pageid#: 798\n\nAmong  other  benefits,  the  VHU  housing  areas  are  equipped  with  communal \ntelevisions with in-cell volume controls to allow for inmates’ visual participation in \nweekly Jum’ah services via a closed circuit television broadcast. \nTo  be  found  eligible  for  the  VHU,  Greenhill  must  meet  the  following \ncriteria:  (a) be convicted of a grooming policy violation and (b) have “[n]o past \nhistory of disruptive or assaultive behavior as determined by review team.”  Id. at \nEnclosure D, OP 864.1(V)(C)(1).  A recommendation for assignment to the VHU \nmust be reviewed by the ICA at Red Onion and the VDOC Central Classification \nServices (“CCS”), with final decisions or exceptions approved by Facility Unit \nHead and the Regional Operations Chief. \nC.  Greenhill’s Allegations and Claims. \nGreenhill claims that “since the defendants have made [his] visual access to \nJum’ah contingent upon ownership of a personal television [he does] not own and \ncannot afford to purchase, they have substantially burdened [his] religious exercise \nof Jum’ah” in SM-0.  Greenhill Decl. ¶ 5, ECF No. 57.  He states that even if he \ncan move to a status allowing employment, this burden on his religious practice \nwill continue.  According to Greenhill, the pay rate for pod jobs is 20 to 35 cents \nper hour.  With other necessary expenses including hygiene and stationery items \nand  medical  expenses,  it  may  be  years  before  he  could  save  $212  to  buy  a \ntelevision.  He states that “Jum’ah is a central tenet of Islam; any adult Muslim \n-9- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 60   Filed 09/19/18   Page 9 of 19   Pageid#: 799\n\nmale who is absent therefore incurs a terrible sin and is deprived of the opportunity \nto acquire many blessings.”  Compl. ¶ 9, ECF No. 1. \nGreenhill also claims that because his religion requires him to maintain a \nbeard that exceeds the length requirements of OP 864.1, he will be maintained \nindefinitely in segregated confinement.  This housing status deprives him of many \nactivities available to VDOC inmates in a general population setting, including:  \nJum’ah participation, institutional employment, recreational activities like soccer \nand basketball, and earning good conduct time to shorten his term of confinement. \nGreenhill contends that factors beyond his control prevent his qualification \nto enter the VHU, where he could wear his beard and participate in the televised \nJum’ah.    First,  his  assaultive  disciplinary  history  precludes  him  from  VHU \neligibility unless three levels of administrative reviewers make an exception and \napprove him for VHU admittance.  Second, he has not yet received a grooming \ncharge, another prerequisite for VHU consideration.6 \nTo address these alleged violation of his rights under RLUIPA, Greenhill \nasserts that I should order prison officials to “accommodate [him] with the means \n                                                           \n6  In his responsive pleadings, Greenhill complains that Unit Manager Collins, \nwho is not a defendant in this case, has refused to charge him with a disciplinary offense \nfor failing to comply with grooming policy requirement for religious reasons.  Collins \nallegedly believes that the VHU is reserved for Rastafarian inmates and, on that basis, \nsuch charges are reserved for Rastafarian inmates.  Greenhill also claims that his religion \nforbids charging a fee for Jum’ah participation, but that VDOC regulations essentially \nrequire a fee (the cost of a personal television set) for Greenhill to participate in Jum’ah.  \nI find these allegations to be new claims, not properly presented in the Complaint or by \ntimely amendment.  Therefore, I do not consider these issues to be part of this case. \n-10- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 60   Filed 09/19/18   Page 10 of 19   Pageid#: 800\n\nto visually access Jum’ah or allow him bodily access thereto.”  Id. at ¶ 46.  He also \nasks for an order allowing him to maintain a four-inch beard “without incurring \ndisciplinary measures as a result.”  Id. \nII.  DISCUSSION. \nA.  Summary Judgment Standard of Review. \nA court should grant summary judgment “if the movant shows that there is \nno genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as \na matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  “As to materiality, . . . [o]nly disputes over \nfacts  that  might  affect  the  outcome  of  the  suit  under  the  governing  law  will \nproperly preclude the entry of summary judgment.”  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, \nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  A dispute about a material fact is genuine “if the \nevidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving \nparty.”    Id.    I  must  draw  all  reasonable  inferences  from  the  facts  in  favor  of \nGreenhill, the nonmoving party.  Williams v. Staples, Inc., 372 F.3d 662, 667 (4th \nCir. 2004).  To survive the defendants’ motion, however, Greenhill must present \nsufficient evidence that could carry the burden of proof of his claims at trial.  Id.  \nHe “may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but must set \n-11- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 60   Filed 09/19/18   Page 11 of 19   Pageid#: 801\n\nforth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Anderson, 477 \nU.S. at 248.7 \nB.  RLUIPA. \nRLUIPA provides that  \nNo  government  shall  impose  a  substantial  burden  on  the \nreligious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution, \n. . . even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, \nunless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on \nthat person —  \n \n(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and  \n \n(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling \n  governmental interest.”  \n  \n§ 2000cc-1(a).  Congress enacted RLUIPA with the express intention to provide \ngreater protections for inmates’ religious exercise than does the First Amendment \nas interpreted by the Supreme Court.  Holt v. Hobbs, 135 S. Ct. 853, 860 (2015). \nNevertheless, context matters.  An inmate’s right to religious exercise under \nRLUIPA must be balanced against the VDOC’s institutional needs of security, \ndiscipline, and general administration.  Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 722 \n(2005).  RLUIPA cannot be applied so as “to elevate accommodation of religious \nobservances over an institution’s need to maintain order and safety.”  Id.

Lee, 472 F.3d 174, 190 (4th Cir. 2006). \n1.  Substantial Burden. \nUnder the first facet of the RLUIPA analysis, the inmate “bears the initial \nburden to demonstrate that the prison’s policy exacts a substantial burden on [his] \nreligious exercise.”  Incumaa v. Stirling, 791 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir. 2015).  For \npurposes of a RLUIPA claim, “a substantial burden on religious exercise occurs \nwhen  a  state  or  local  government,  through  act  or  omission,  puts  substantial \npressure  on  an  adherent  to  modify  his  behavior  and  to  violate  his  beliefs.”  \nLovelace, 472 F.3d at 187.   \nThe defendants argue that Greenhill has not met his initial burden to show \nthat his inability to attend or view group religious services in SM-0 status has \nsubstantially burdened his religious practice, since that status is temporary.  I find \notherwise.  Greenhill contends that even a temporary inability to participate in \ngroup Jum’ah services, in person or via the broadcast, deprives him of a central \npractice of his Muslim beliefs and, thereby, causes him to sin and deprives him of \nblessings.  He presents evidence that it will take him many months to advance past \nSM-0, secure a prison job, and save enough from his meager wages to purchase a \npersonal television to permit his Jum’ah participation while in Level S status.  He \nalso points out that his disciplinary history includes assaultive behavior, making \n-13- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 60   Filed 09/19/18   Page 13 of 19   Pageid#: 803\n\nhim ineligible for transfer to the VHU (with access to a communal television for \nJum’ah)  unless  prison  administrators  grant  him  an  exception.    Nothing  in  the \nrecord suggests that such exceptions are common or that Greenhill has any chance \nof quickly obtaining one.  Taking all of this evidence in the light most favorable to \nGreenhill, I find that he has presented material disputes of fact by which he could \nshow that SM-0 regulations place a substantial burden on his Jum’ah practice.  See \nObataiye-Allah v. Va. Dep’t of Corr., No. 7:15CV00230, 2016 WL 5415906, at \n*14 (W.D. Va. Sept. 28, 2016) (finding denial of televised Jum’ah at lowest OP \n830.A step placed substantial burden on Nation of Islam inmate’s practice), aff’d, \n688 F. App’x 211 (4th Cir. 2017) (unpublished).8   \nI cannot find, however, that Greenhill has met his threshold showing that the \nVDOC grooming policy is placing a substantial burden on his religious practice to \nwear a four-inch beard.  It is undisputed that Greenhill is currently in segregated \nconfinement because of his many disciplinary infractions and his failure to meet \nthe goals of the Step-Down Program for advancement to less restrictive housing \nstatuses.  His beard now exceeds the half-inch beard length limit in OP 864.1, and \nhe can grow and maintain it at a four-inch length, consistent with his beliefs.  It is \nundisputed, however, that his noncompliance with the beard length provision will \n                                                           \n8  The plaintiff in the Obataiye-Allah case withdrew this RLUIPA claim \nbefore appealing the disposition of his unrelated due process claims.   \n \n-14- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 60   Filed 09/19/18   Page 14 of 19   Pageid#: 804\n\nnot prevent his progress to less restrictive steps in the Step-Down Program and will \nnot result in more restrictive living conditions than those to which he is already \nsubjected because of his SM-0 status.  Thus, Greenhill has presented no disputed \nfact on which he could show that OP 864.1 is placing “substantial pressure” on him \nto violate his belief of wearing a four-inch beard.  Lovelace, 472 F.3d at 187.  \nAccordingly, the defendants are entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law, \nand I will grant their motion, as to Greenhill’s RLUIPA challenge to the VDOC \nbeard grooming requirements. \n2.  Compelling Interest and Least Restrictive Means. \nOnly if the inmate proves that there is a substantial burden on his religious \npractice does “the burden shift[ ] to the government to prove its policy furthers a \ncompelling governmental interest by the least restrictive means.”  Incumaa, 791 \nF.3d at 525.   \nRLUIPA . . . contemplates a more focused inquiry and requires the \nGovernment  to  demonstrate  that  the  compelling  interest  test  is \nsatisfied through application of the challenged law to the person — \nthe  particular  claimant  whose  sincere  exercise  of  religion  is  being \nsubstantially burdened. \n \nHolt, 135 S. Ct. at 863.   \nThe  defendants  argue  that  the  VDOC  has  a  compelling  interest  in  the \nsuccess of the Step-Down Program to motivate inmates to improve attitudes and \nbehaviors  —  thereby,  to  maintain  order,  reduce  disruptive  and  dangerous \n-15- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 60   Filed 09/19/18   Page 15 of 19   Pageid#: 805\n\nbehaviors,  and  to  promote  inmates’  successful  re-entry  of  society  after \nincarceration.  I agree that the VDOC has a compelling interest in rehabilitating its \nprisoners — to further internal safety and security, but particularly to prepare an \ninmate like Greenhill, who is nearing the end of his prison term, for life outside \nsegregated confinement.9  Now, I must determine whether the defendants have \ndemonstrated that the Step-Down Program television restriction in SM-0 is the \nleast restrictive means by which they could further the policy’s motivational goals. \nRLUIPA’s  “least-restrictive-means  standard  is  exceptionally  demanding.”  \nId. at 864.  “The least-restrictive-means standard . . . requires the government to \nshow that it lacks other means of achieving its desired goal without imposing a \nsubstantial burden on the exercise of religion by the objecting party.”  Jehovah v. \nClarke, 798 F.3d 169, 177 (4th Cir. 2015).   \nCourts should not “mechanically accept” prison administrators’ rationale for \nrestricting religious exercise.”  Lovelace, 472 F.3d at 190.  However, courts must \napply RLUIPA standards with “due deference to the experience and expertise of \nprison and jail administrators in establishing necessary regulations and procedures \nto maintain good order, security and discipline, consistent with consideration of \n                                                           \n9  According to the VDOC website, Greenhill’s projected release date is January \n25,  2022.    Offender  Locator  Search  Results,  https://vadoc.virginia.gov/offenders/ \nlocator/results.aspx (last visited Sept. 18, 2018). \n-16- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 60   Filed 09/19/18   Page 16 of 19   Pageid#: 806\n\ncosts and limited resources.”  Wright v. Lassiter, 633 F. App’x 150, 151 (4th Cir. \n2016) (unpublished) (quoting Cutter, 544 U.S. at 723). \nIn this context, I find it appropriate to view VDOC religious accommodation \npolicies as a whole, as Greenhill has encountered them throughout his term of \nconfinement.  He started his VDOC prison term in institutional settings where \nVDOC policies allowed him to gather with fellow believers for group religious \nservices.    Greenhill squandered  that  opportunity  and  committed numerous  rule \nviolations  and  threatening  actions  that  caused  officials  to  reclassify  him  as  a \ngreater security risk.  Eventually, his actions resulted in his placement in Level S, \nwhere  policies  bar  him  from  group  gatherings  with  other  inmates  for  security \nreasons.   \nEven  since  moving  to  Level  S,  Greenhill  has  had  opportunities  (in  the \nStructured Living Phase 1 pod and in the Secure Integration Pod Phase 1) to take \nactions  toward  reclaiming  the  opportunity  for  group  Jum’ah  participation.    By \navoiding disciplinary infractions and participating fully in the Step-Down Program \nrequirements,  he  might  have  earned  reclassification  to  a  lower  security \nclassification  where  group  religious  services  were  available  to  him.    In  both \ncircumstances, however, Greenhill’s choices (to refuse the Step-Down Program \nparticipation and to commit multiple, serious disciplinary infractions) led to his \ndemotion to SM-0.  In that status, too, his own actions or inactions have blocked \n-17- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 60   Filed 09/19/18   Page 17 of 19   Pageid#: 807\n\nhis progress toward a less restrictive housing situation, including the possibility for \na job and other privileges, such as transfer to the VHU. \nThe defendants have demonstrated that the Step-Down Program procedures \nin OP 830.A use incentive-based pathways specifically designed for inmates with \nparticular  issues  that  may  derail  their  successful  transition  after  release  from \nprison.  The SM pathway is focused to assist those inmates, like Greenhill, with a \nhistory of disruptive behavior, fighting, or violence, and a past demonstration of \nunwillingness  or  inability  to  improve  their  behavior  under  less  restrictive \nconditions.  Such inmates need strong motivational factors to convince them to \nchange, for the improvement of prison order and safety and for their own future \nsuccess after prison.  The defendants argue that since television access is one of the \nbest  motivations  for  inmates  to  work  toward  advancement  in  the  Step-Down \nProgram,  its  restrictions,  including  the  television  ban  in  SM-0,  “are  the  least \nrestrictive means of furthering” the state’s compelling interest in the Step-Down \nProgram’s  success  in  maintaining  order,  reducing  inmates’  disruptive  and \ndangerous  actions,  and  promoting  successful  re-entry  to  society.    Mem.  Supp. \nSuppl. Mot. Summ. J. 14, ECF No. 55.  They also contend that “[r]emoving the \nescalating  privilege  levels  would  render  the  entire  incentive-based  Step-Down \nProgram ineffective.”  Id. at 15. \n-18- \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 60   Filed 09/19/18   Page 18 of 19   Pageid#: 808\n\nGreenhill  does  not  offer  evidence  in  contradiction  of  the  defendants’ \ncontention that the television ban is the least restrictive means of furthering the \nstate’s  compelling  interest  in  motivating  him  to  make  positive  changes  in  his \nthinking and conduct.  The Supreme Court has instructed courts to defer to the \nprofessional judgment and experience of prison administrators in developing and \nenforcing effective procedures for inmate management. Cutter, 544 U.S. at 723.  I \nam also instructed not to measure any religious accommodation under the RLUIPA \nstandard in such a way as to “override other significant interests.”  Cutter, 544 U.S. \nat 722.  Inmates’ rehabilitation and successful re-entry must be counted as such an \ninterest.  I conclude that although the television restriction for SM-0 inmates may \nsubstantially  burden  Greenhill’s  Jum’ah  practice,  that  restriction  furthers \ncompelling penological interests by the least restrictive means.  Accordingly, I will \ngrant  the  defendants’  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  on  Greenhill’s  RLUIPA \nclaim concerning his Jum’ah participation. \nIII.  CONCLUSION. \nFor the stated reasons, it is ORDERED that the defendants’ Supplemental \nMotion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 54, is GRANTED.  \nA separate Judgment will be entered herewith. \n              ENTER:  September 19, 2018 \n \n              /s/  James P.

Laura  Haeberle \nCahill,  OFFICE  OF  THE  ATTORNEY  GENERAL  OF  VIRGINIA,  Richmond, \nVirginia, for Appellees.  \n \n \nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit. \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 32   Filed 12/22/16   Page 1 of 3   Pageid#: 280\n\nPER CURIAM: \n  Alfonza Hardy Greenhill appeals the district court’s order \ndenying his request for a preliminary injunction in this action \nbrought  pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  § 1983  (2012)  and  the  Religious \nLand Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 2000cc  to  2000cc-5  (2012).    Greenhill,  a  Muslim  inmate \ncurrently confined in segregation, sought an injunction ordering \nprison  officials  to  provide  a  television  broadcast  of  the \nJum’ah, a revision in the prison’s grooming policy, and a change \nin how he is served halal meals.  The district court denied the \nrequested  injunction  because  Greenhill  did  not  show  that  he \ncould satisfy any of the factors set forth in Winter v. Natural \nResources  Defense  Council,  Inc.,  555  U.S.  7,  20  (2008).    On \nappeal, Greenhill only challenges the district court’s denial of \ninjunctive  relief  regarding  his  access  to  the  Jum’ah.  \nAccordingly,  we  affirm  the  district  court’s  order  as  to  its \ndisposition of the grooming policy and halal meal claims.  See \n4th Cir. R. 34(b); Jackson v. Lightsey, 775 F.3d 170, 177 (4th \nCir. 2014); Williams v. Giant Food Inc., 370 F.3d 423, 430 n.4 \n(4th Cir. 2004). \n  As  to  Greenhill’s  claim  concerning  access  to  the  Jum’ah, \nthe  district  court  made  no  specific  findings  of  fact  or \nconclusions of law in denying this claim.  Rule 52(a)(2), Fed. \nR. Civ. P., requires that the district court make particularized \n2 \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 32   Filed 12/22/16   Page 2 of 3   Pageid#: 281\n\nfindings  of  fact  supporting  its  decision  to  grant  or  deny  a \npreliminary injunction; such findings are necessary in order for \nan appellate court to conduct meaningful appellate review.  See \nH & R Block Tax Servs. LLC v. Acevedo-Lopez, 742 F.3d 1074, 1078 \n(8th Cir. 2014).  In the absence of any such specific findings, \nwe  are  constrained  to  conclude  that  the  district  court  abused \nits  discretion  in  denying  the  requested  injunction  as  to \nGreenhill’s  Jum’ah  claim.    See  WV  Ass’n  of  Club  Owners  & \nFraternal Servs., Inc. v. Musgrave, 553 F.3d 292, 298 (4th Cir. \n2009) (stating standard of review). \n  Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s order as to the \ngrooming  policy  and  halal  food  claims,  vacate  it  as  to  the \nJum’ah claim, and remand for further proceedings.  We dispense \nwith oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are \nadequately  presented  in  the  materials  before  this  court  and \nargument would not aid the decisional process. \nAFFIRMED IN PART, \nVACATED IN PART, \nAND REMANDED \n \n3 \n \nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-RSB   Document 32   Filed 12/22/16   Page 3 of 3   Pageid#: 282",

Defendant Earl Barksdale was the Warden of Red Onion State Prison from January\n2015 until December 2016.  As Warden, Defendant Barksdale was also the Facility Unit Head of \nRed Onion, in which role he had ultimate authority to approve – or to delegate authority to approve \n– security-level classifications of Red Onion prisoners.  He also had responsibility for the welfare\nof all the inmates at Red Onion, including Plaintiff Greenhill.  Defendant Jeffrey Kiser is the \nWarden of Red Onion State Prison, and has held that position since December 2016 and previously \nheld the role of Assistant Warden of Red Onion State Prison.  As Warden, Defendant Kiser is also \nthe Facility Unit Head of Red Onion, in which role he has ultimate authority to approve – or to \ndelegate authority to approve – security-level classifications of Red Onion prisoners.  He also has \nresponsibility for the welfare of all the inmates at Red Onion, including Plaintiff Greenhill. \n8. Defendant Fuller is the Assistant Warden of Red Onion State Prison, and has held\nthat position since 2019.  Upon information and belief, as Assistant Warden, Defendant Fuller \nshares responsibility for the welfare of all the inmates at Red Onion, including Plaintiff Greenhill, \nand is known to inmates as an extension of the Warden.  Defendant Fuller also has the authority to \ngrant Plaintiff Greenhill access to Jum’ah services. \n9. Defendant Larry Collins is a Unit Manager at Red Onion State Prison and, upon\ninformation and belief, has held that position from 2015 to 2016.

Each defendant is sued individually and in his or her official capacity.  At all times\nmentioned in this complaint each defendant acted under color of state law, specifically, under color \nof the law of the Commonwealth of Virginia.   \nIV. FACTS\n16. Plaintiff Greenhill is a devout, practicing Muslim, sincere in his Islamic beliefs.\nPlaintiff Greenhill practices Islam in its Sufi context.   \n17. Sufism is a genre of Islam that emphasizes a strict adherence, outwardly and\ninwardly, to the Sunnah (ways, habits, traditions) of the Prophet Muhammed (peach be upon him), \nhis Sahabah (companions) and Sufi Masters.   \n18. Plaintiff Greenhill has been a Muslim since 2000.\n19. Plaintiff Greenhill’s religion, Islam, obligates him to be present, bodily or visually,\nat the weekly Islamic gathering known as Jum’ah.  Jum’ah mean, in English, “a gathering.”   \n20. Jum’ah takes place, world-wide, every Friday.\n21. Jum’ah consists of a two-part Khutbah (sermon) and a ritual Salah (ritual prayer)\nof two rakat (cycles).  For Sufi Muslims, it is also obligatory to give or share a meal after Jum’ah.   \n22. There is an entire Surah (chapter) of the Holy Qur’an entitled, “al-Jum’ah” (Surah\n62), and it is one of the places wherein the commandment to attend Jum’ah can be found.   \n23. Jum’ah is a central tenet of Islam; any adult Muslim male who is absent therefrom\nincurs a terrible sin and is deprived of the opportunity to acquire many blessings. \n24. Plaintiff Greenhill has been confined within facilities operated by the Virginia\nDepartment of Corrections from 2008 to the present. \n25. Plaintiff Greenhill was a security level “segregation” (hereinafter level S) prisoner\nliving in level S housing (“C” building) of Red Onion State Prison (ROSP) from 2008 until 2012. \n5\n \n\nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-PMS   Document 83   Filed 07/08/20   Page 6 of 21   Pageid#: 942\nIn level S housing, Plaintiff Greenhill was confined to his cell for 23 hours a day and was only \nreleased therefrom to be escorted, in handcuffs and shackles, to an outside man-cage (the same \nsize as his cell – approximately 12 ft. x. 7 ft.), shower, medical building, etc.  As a level S prisoner, \nPlaintiff Greenhill was not permitted to be bodily present at Jum’ah. \n26. In 2012, Plaintiff Greenhill was transferred to Wallens Ridge State Prison (“D”\nbuilding).  While at Wallens Ridge State Prison, Plaintiff Greenhill was subject to the same \nconditions as level S housing in ROSP.  Plaintiff Greenhill was not permitted to be bodily present \nat Jum’ah.  In 2013, Plaintiff Greenhill was transferred back to ROSP in level S housing (“D” \nbuilding).  Plaintiff Greenhill was subject to the same conditions as experienced in ROSP from \n2008 until 2012.   \n27. In 2015, Plaintiff Greenhill was transferred to the “C” building of ROSP, where he\nremained  until  February  2020.    Plaintiff  Greenhill  was  subject  to  the  same  conditions  as \nexperienced in the “D” building of ROSP from 2013-2015. \n28. Plaintiff Greenhill has been housed in a Re-Entry Unit since February 14, 2020.  In\nthe Re-Entry Unit, Plaintiff Greenhill is confined alone to his cell for 23 hours per day and is only \nreleased to be escorted, in handcuffs and shackles, to an outside man-cage (the same size as his \ncell – approximately 12 ft. x 7 ft.), to shower or to receive medical care.  In the Re-Entry unit, \nPlaintiff Greenhill is not permitted to be bodily present at Jum’ah. \n29. ROSP broadcasts a videotape of Jum’ah every Friday on a closed-circuit television\nsystem within the facility.  ROSP has done this for many years.  The videotape of Jum’ah is aired \nto ROSP prisoners in the general prisoner population and level S housing.  The only level S \nprisoners who may view the videotape of Jum’ah are those who own a personal television.   \n6\n \n\nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-PMS   Document 83   Filed 07/08/20   Page 7 of 21   Pageid#: 943\n30. As for those level S prisoners who do not own a personal television, they have no\nway to visually access, and participate in, Jum’ah.   \n31. A personal television costs approximately $212 to ROSP inmates and can be\npurchased from the facility commissary.   \n32. Plaintiff Greenhill is a financially indigent prisoner and cannot afford a personal\ntelevision.   \n33. Because Plaintiff Greenhill did not own and could not afford to purchase a personal\ntelevision during his confinement in level S housing at ROSP, Plaintiff Greenhill was precluded \nfrom visually observing or participating in Jum’ah throughout his confinement in level S housing.  \n34. Plaintiff Greenhill is still not able to fully observe or participate in Jum’ah.\n35. Precluding Plaintiff Greenhill from visually observing or participating in Jum’ah\nplaced a substantial burden upon Plaintiff Greenhill’s religious exercise of Jum’ah, a central tenet \nof Islam. \n36. Precluding Plaintiff Greenhill from visually accessing or participating in Jum’ah\nplaced a substantial burden upon Plaintiff Greenhill’s religious exercise of religion. \n37. Virginia  Department  of  Corrections  Operating  Procedure  841.3  “Offender\nReligious Programs,” signed by Defendant A. David Robinson, mandates that the only Virginia \nDepartment  of  Corrections  (VDOC)  Segregation  prisoners  who  may  visually  access  and \nparticipate in religious programs are those who own a personal television.  Operating Procedure \n841.3 is enforced at all VDOC prisons. \n38. Plaintiff Greenhill submitted an Informal Complaint form, on October 1, 2015,\naddressed to Defendants Harold W. Clarke and A. David Robinson, regarding his inability to \nvisually access Jum’ah by way of the Jum’ah videos aired at ROSP, and that his visual access to \n7\n \n\nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-PMS   Document 83   Filed 07/08/20   Page 8 of 21   Pageid#: 944\nJum’ah has been conditioned upon the purchase and ownership of a personal television that he \ncannot afford (see exhibit A).  Plaintiff Greenhill was sent a response dated October 13, 2015 \ndenying Plaintiff Greenhill a personal television by which he can visually access Jum’ah and fulfil \nhis religions Islamic obligation (see exhibit A).  In his appeal to that response, Plaintiff Greenhill \nproposed, as an alternative to a personal television, that he be allowed to bodily attend Jum’ah, or \nthat communal television be placed in all level S pods at ROSP, and that Plaintiff Greenhill could \nvisually access, and participate in, Jum’ah thereby (see exhibits B and C). \n39. VDOC officials operating under the VDOC Defendants’ direction and control\nmaintained, throughout the exhaustion process and throughout Plaintiff Greenhill’s confinement \nin level S housing that Plaintiff Greenhill could not visually access Jum’ah unless he first sought \nand obtained institutional employment and earn enough money to purchase a $212 television (see \nexhibits A, B, and C).   \n40. However, for years, Plaintiff Greenhill was regarded by VDOC officials as “Special\nManagement 0” (SM0).  As SM0, Plaintiff Greenhill was not permitted to attain institutional \nemployment.  Also, Plaintiff Greenhill, for religious reasons, refused to comply with the VDOC’s \nprior quarter-inch length limitation on prisoner beards.   \n41. Plaintiff  Greenhill’s  religion,  Islam,  obligates  him  to  grow  his  beard  to,  and\nmaintain it at, the length of his fist.  Plaintiff Greenhill’s first is four inches in length.  It is noted \nin a rigorously authenticated hadith (report of tradition) that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be \nupon him) said: \n“Differ from the Polytheists; let your beard grow and shave your mustache.” \n(Bukhari Collection of Hadith) \nThat command had been defined by a close companion of the Prophet and foundational jurist of \nIslamic Law, Ibn ’Umar: \n8\n \n\nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-PMS   Document 83   Filed 07/08/20   Page 9 of 21   Pageid#: 945\nWhen Ibn ’Umar made his hajj (pilgrimage) and ’Umrah (lesser pilgrimage), he \nwould hold his beard in his fist, and whatever exceeded his fist he would cutoff.” \n(Bukhari and Muslim Collections of Hadith) \n42. Prior to 1999, the VDOC had no policy forbidding beards.  In 1999, the VDOC\nimplemented a policy forbidding prisoners to have beards of any length.  In 2013, the VDOC began \nto permit beards not exceeding the length of a quarter-inch (see exhibit D, section IV.F.c.).   \n43. Plaintiff Greenhill entered the VDOC in 2007 and was not permitted to grow his\nboard to, and maintain it at, the length of four inches as he is obligated by his religion, Islam, for \n12 years.  Not allowing Plaintiff Greenhill to grow his beard to, and maintain it at, the length of \nfour inches, as his religion, Islam, obligates him to; placed a substantial burden on Plaintiff \nGreenhill’s religious exercise.  Just five days after briefing was completed before the Fourth Circuit \nin this case, the policy was changed in April 2019, effective June 2019, to allow for  “freedom in \npersonal grooming.”  The policy, as amended in June 2019 by Defendant Robinson, specifically \nrequires that it shall be reviewed annually and re-written no more than three years after its effective \ndate.   \n44. In obedience to his religion, Islam, Plaintiff Greenhill was not in compliance with\nthe VDOC’s grooming policy for the vast majority of his incarceration, Operating Procedure 864.1 \n“Offender Grooming and Hygiene” (O.P. 864.1) (see exhibit D).  Plaintiff Greenhill’s beard was \napproximately two inches in length when he filed this suit.  He intends to maintain it at four inches \nuntil the day of his death.   \n45. As long as Plaintiff Greenhill refused to comply with O.P. 864.1, he was not allowed\ninto the VDOC’s general prisoner population; he remained locked in a cell 23 hours a day 5 days \na week, and 24 hours a day 2 days a week; he was deprived of the opportunity to bodily attend \nJum’ah; he was prohibited from congregating with fellow Muslim prisoners for obligatory prayer \n9\n \n\nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-PMS   Document 83   Filed 07/08/20   Page 10 of 21   Pageid#: 946\nand study classes; he was not allowed to attain institutional employment; he will not be allowed \nthe recreational activities such as basketball and soccer; he will not be able to earn any good-time \ncredits.  For all of the aforementioned reasons, Plaintiff Greenhill’s religious exercise of fulfilling \nhis Islamic commandment to grow his beard to, and maintain it at, the length of four inches was \nsubstantially burdened for 11 years. \n46. As a result, for years, the VDOC Defendants forced Plaintiff Greenhill to choose\nbetween his religious command to grow and maintain a four-inch beard and his need to participate \nin Jum’ah.  He could not fulfill his religious command to visually access Jum’ah unless he obtained \nemployment and purchased a television, and he could not obtain employment unless he broke his \nreligious command to grow a four-inch by shaving. \n47. Plaintiff Greenhill continued to maintain a four-inch beard until, shortly after the\nFourth Circuit’s December 6, 2019 decision, he was misled by a VDOC employee who made false \npromises to induce Plaintiff Greenhill into shaving his beard.  To wit, Plaintiff Greenhill was \npromised improved conditions of confinement if he shaved his beard.  This promise was false \nbecause VDOC had previously lifted its ban on four-inch beards.   \n48. Plaintiff Greenhill intends to never shave it any shorter than four inches until his\ndeath. \n49. Plaintiff Greenhill has never been convicted of concealing contraband in his beard.\n50. Plaintiff Greenhill’s four-inch beard does not and has never posed any security\nthreat to employees, inmates, or staff at ROSP. \n51. VDOC and the VDOC Defendants have at all relevant times allowed female\ninmates to maintain shoulder-length hair, that is, hair substantially longer than four-inches. \n10\n \n\nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-PMS   Document 83   Filed 07/08/20   Page 11 of 21   Pageid#: 947\n52. At no time relevant here have VDOC or the VDOC Defendants ever imposed any\ngrooming or length requirements on armpit or pubic hair. \n53. Plaintiff  Greenhill  submitted  an  Informal  Complaint  on  October  10,  2015,\naddressed to Defendants Harold W. Clarke and A. David Robinson, regarding the substantial \nburden placed upon his Islamic religious exercise of growing his beard to, and maintaining it at, \nthe length of four inches (see exhibit E).  In his appeal, Plaintiff Greenhill requested a revision of \nO.P. 864.4 that would allow him to grow his beard to, and maintain it at, the length of four inches \nand thereby remove the substantial burden currently upon his exercise of religion.  That request \nwas denied (see exhibit F). \n54. From the time he was transferred to ROSP until February 2020, Plaintiff Greenhill\nwas classified by the VDOC as a level S prisoner and was housed in level S housing at ROSP. \nROSP’s C-building is designated exclusively for level S housing.   \n55. In level S housing, prisoners are locked in their cells 23 hours a day.\n56. The entirety of C-building at ROSP serves as the housing unit for the VDOC’s level\nS prisoners.  There are six pods in C-building: C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6.  C-1 and C-6 pods \nboth have 44 cells, and all other pods in C-building have 22 cells each. \n57. From the time Plaintiff Greenhill was placed in section S housing at ROSP until\nFebruary 2020, the VDOC Defendants took the position that Plaintiff Greenhill was housed in a \nsegregation unity not as a punishment for security reasons. \n58. Throughout that time, the VDOC Defendants and VDOC took the position that if\nPlaintiff Greenhill progressed through the “step down” program he would eventually cease to be \na security risk and he could either obtain a job that would allow him to purchase a television to \n11\n \n\nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-PMS   Document 83   Filed 07/08/20   Page 12 of 21   Pageid#: 948\nvisually access Jum’ah or to be housed in a unit where he could either visually access Jum’ah \nthrough a communal television or attend Jum’ah physically. \n59. From the time Plaintiff Greenhill entered VSOP until June 2019, Plaintiff Greenhill\ncould not participate in the “step down” program unless he cut or shaved his beard to one-half inch \nor shorter, as required by ROSP grooming regulations, in violation of his religious faith. \n60. Because  Plaintiff  Greenhill’s  religious  mandate  to  grow  a  four-inch  beard\nprohibited him from shaving his beard to one-quarter inch or shorter, Plaintiff Greenhill could not \nparticipate in the “step down” program before June 2019, unless he violated his religious tenets by \nshaving or cutting his beard down to one-half inch or less. \n61. This means that the VDOC Defendants punished Plaintiff Greenhill for exercising\nhis religious obligation to keep a four-inch beard by keeping him in administrative isolation—\nspending at least 23 hours a day in a tiny cell alone—for more than a decade. \n62. Moreover, Plaintiff Greenhill objected to being forced to participate in the “step\ndown” program because it would entail indoctrination inconsistent with his beliefs as a devout, \npracticing Muslim. \n63. The VDOC Defendants’ and VDOC’s position is that level S housing is not used as\na punishment but for security purposes. \n64. There are many ways an inmate can demonstrate he is not a security threat other\nthan participating in the “step down” program, and therefore, the VDOC Defendants’ decision to \nmake participation in the “step down” program the only path to being removed from level S \nhousing is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. \n65. Plaintiff Greenhill has not posed a legitimate security threat while at ROSP such\nthat his housing in level S housing was required for his safety or the safety of others. \n12\n \n\nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-PMS   Document 83   Filed 07/08/20   Page 13 of 21   Pageid#: 949\n66. Plaintiff Greenhill has not been a legitimate security threat throughout his time at\nROSP such that his housing in level S housing was required for his safety or the safety of others. \n67. VDOC  and  the VDOC  Defendants  considered  Plaintiff  Greenhill’s  refusal  to\nparticipate in the “step down” program a failure to comply with an order, and further considered \nthis infraction itself sufficient to keep him in level S housing until February 2020. \n68. After exhausting his administrative appeals, Plaintiff Greenhill filed this action in\nFebruary 2016, outlining the VDOC Defendants’ and VDOC’s violations of his religious rights \nunder RLUIPA and the First Amendment. \n69. Although Plaintiff Greenhill’s Complaint put the VDOC Defendants fully on notice\nof their continuing violations of his protected religious rights, the VDOC Defendants continued \nviolating his protected religious rights as set forth above. \n70. The VDOC  Defendants  asserted  that  Plaintiff  Greenhill’s  visual  accessing  of\nJum’ah through a closed-circuit television was a privilege. \n71. The VDOC Defendants asserted that they were withholding the ability to visually\naccess Jum’ah services from Plaintiff Greenhill to coax him into participating in the “step down” \nprogram at ROSP. \n72. On December 6, 2019, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision in this\ncase, Greenhill v. Clarke, 944 F.3d 243 (4th Cir. 2019). \n73. The Fourth Circuit’s December 6, 2019 decision made clear that the actions of\nDefendants Clarke and Robinson infringed on Plaintiff Greenhill’s religious freedom as protected \nby the First Amendment and RLUIPA. \n13\n \n\nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-PMS   Document 83   Filed 07/08/20   Page 14 of 21   Pageid#: 950\n74. The Fourth Circuit’s December 6, 2019 decision held that the justifications that\nVDOC and Defendants Clarke and Robinson had provided for denying Plaintiff Greenhill’s \nreligious rights were insufficient and remanded the case to this Court for further proceedings. \n75. The Fourth Circuit’s December 6, 2019 decision rejected Defendants Clarke and\nRobinson’s attempt to characterize Plaintiff Greenhill’s religious mandate to participate in Jum’ah \neach week “privilege” that could be withdrawn if Plaintiff Greenhill did not participate in a “step \ndown” program” promulgated at ROSP.   \n76. The Fourth Circuit’s December 6, 2019 decision held that “placing such religious\nexercise in the category of privilege to be earned is fundamentally inconsistent with the right to \nreligious exercise that RLUIPA guarantees to prisoners.”  944 F.3d at 250 (emphasis in original). \n77. The  Fourth  Circuit’s  December  6,  2019  decision  further  held  that  “VDOC’s\ngrooming  policy  also  imposed  a  substantial  burden  on  Greenhill’s  religious  exercise  under \nRLUIPA.”  Id. \n78. The Fourth Circuit’s December 6, 2019 decision further observed that Defendants\nClarke and Robinson’s and VDOC’s frequent changes to its grooming policy governing beards \n“suggest[] that a less restrictive means was available to accommodate Greenhill’s religious \nexercise.”  Id. at 252. \n79. The Fourth Circuit’s December 6, 2019 decision also rejects Defendant Clarke and\nRobinson’s justifications for denying Plaintiff Greenhill’s rights under the First Amendment.  The \ncourt  held  that  “VDOC’s  justification  for  preventing  Greenhill  from  viewing  Jum’ah  was \nessentially that access to religious services was a privilege for SM-0 inmates to earn” which again \nfailed to take account of the fact that Plaintiff Greenhill’s religious observance is a right.  Id. at \n253. It similarly reiterated that VDOC’s shifting grooming policies suggested that Defendants and\n14\n \n\nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-PMS   Document 83   Filed 07/08/20   Page 15 of 21   Pageid#: 951\nVDOC “may not have” had even a rational basis for requiring Plaintiff Greenhill to cut his beard \nto one-half inch or less.  Id. \n80. Notwithstanding this clear ruling by the Court of Appeals that rejected Defendants\nClarke and Robinson’s justifications for denying Plaintiff Greenhill’s religious rights, the VDOC \nDefendants kept Plaintiff Greenhill in level S housing for two months after the Fourth Circuit’s \nDecember 6, 2019 ruling and continued to deny him the ability to bodily or visually access Jum’ah \nduring this time. \n81. Additionally,  on  or  about  November  2019,  the  VDOC  Defendants  issued  a\nmemorandum announcing a policy that made it impossible to practice Ta’lim, which is the Islamic \npractice of study and education of the Qu’ran and the hadith (teachings of the prophet Muhammad). \nUpon information and belief, this policy did not prohibit any other religious practices, including \nthose of the Christian faith. \n82. The VDOC pays Defendant GraceInside to conduct chaplaincy services in ROSP,\nincluding to Plaintiff Greenhill.  Defendant GraceInside employs Defendant Theiben to conduct \nthese chaplaincy services. \n83. Upon  information  and  belief,  the  chaplaincy  services  provided  by  Defendant\nGraceInside is the only available chaplaincy service available to Plaintiff Greenhill while in ROSP. \n84. Defendant Theiben has provided chaplaincy services to Plaintiff Greenhill and\nother people at RSOP through VDOC’s contract with GraceInside. \n85. Upon information and belief, Defendant Theiben is an evangelical Christian.\n86. Despite Plaintiff Greenhill’s request, Defendant Theiben has refused to provide any\nreligious materials other than Christian materials. \n15\n \n\nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-PMS   Document 83   Filed 07/08/20   Page 16 of 21   Pageid#: 952\n87. In the provision of chaplaincy services for the VDOC, Defendant Theiben has\nattempted to persuade Plaintiff Greenhill to abandon his Muslim faith, has denounced the prophet \nMohammad, the Qu’ran, and the hadith, and has refused to say a Muslim prayer despite Plaintiff \nGreenhill’s request. \n88. When Plaintiff Greenhill sought religious counseling from Defendant Theiben,\nDefendant Theiben told Plaintiff Greenhill that “Islam is a lie.” \n89. Plaintiff Greenhill was finally moved out of level S housing in February 2020 into\nthe Re-Entry Unit to prepare for the end of his prison term in 2021. \n90. Although Plaintiff Greenhill is no longer living in Level S Housing, the harms to\nPlaintiff Greenhill’s religious rights outlined in this Amended Complaint are capable of repetition \nyet evading review unless this Court awards Plaintiff Greenhill declaratory and injunctive relief to \nprohibit future violations.   \nV. LEGAL CLAIMS.\nCOUNT I: VIOLATION OF RELIGIOUS LAND USE \nAND INSTITUTIONALIZED PERSONS ACT (RLUIPA) \n91. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 90.\n92. By denying Plaintiff Greenhill visual access to Jum’ah, Defendant Harold W. Clark\nhas substantially burdened and continues to substantially burden Plaintiff Greenhill’s Islamic \nreligious exercise of Jum’ah, in violation of Plaintiff Greenhill’s rights under the Religious Land \nUse and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA).  That denial has caused and is causing Plaintiff \nGreenhill  injury  to  rights  under  the  Religious  Land  Use  and  Institutionalized  Persons Act \n(RLUIPA). \n93. By  denying  Plaintiff  Greenhill  visual  access  to  Jum’ah,  Defendant A.  David\nRobinson substantially burdened Plaintiff Greenhill’s Islamic religious exercise of Jum’ah, in \n16\n \n\nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-PMS   Document 83   Filed 07/08/20   Page 17 of 21   Pageid#: 953\nviolation of Plaintiff Greenhill’s rights under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons \nAct (RLUIPA).  That denial caused Plaintiff Greenhill injury to his rights under the Religious Land \nUse and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA). \n94. By prohibiting Plaintiff Greenhill from growing his beard to, and maintaining it at,\nthe length of four inches as his religion, Islam, obligates him to, Defendant Harold W. Clarke \nsubstantially  burdened  Plaintiff  Greenhill’s  religious  exercise  of  growing  his  beard  to,  and \nmaintaining it at, the length of four inches in violation of Plaintiff Greenhill’s rights under the \nReligious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA).  That prohibition caused Plaintiff \nGreenhill injury to his rights under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act \n(RLUIPA). \nCOUNT II: VIOLATION OF FIRST AMENDMENT TO \nTHE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES \n95. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 94.\n96. By prohibiting Plaintiff Greenhill from growing his beard to, and maintain it at, the\nlength of four inches as his religion, Islam, obligates him to, Defendants denied Plaintiff Greenhill \nthe  free  exercise  of  his  religion,  in  violation  of  Plaintiff  Greenhill’s  rights  under  the  First \nAmendment to the United States Constitution.  That denial caused Plaintiff Greenhill injury to his \nFirst Amendment rights.  As a result of this violation, they left Plaintiff Greenhill in administrative \nsegregation in level S housing for more than a decade, leaving him substantially isolated. \n97. By denying Plaintiff Greenhill visual access to Jum’ah, a central tenet of Plaintiff\nGreenhill’s Islamic religion, Defendant Harold W. Clarke denied Plaintiff Greenhill the free \nexercise of his religion, in violation of Plaintiff Greenhill’s rights under the First Amendment to \nthe  United  States  Constitution.    That  denial  caused  Plaintiff  Greenhill  injury  to  his  First \nAmendments rights. \n17\n \n\nCase 7:16-cv-00068-JPJ-PMS   Document 83   Filed 07/08/20   Page 18 of 21   Pageid#: 954\n98. By denying Plaintiff Greenhill visual access to Jum’ah, a central tenet of Plaintiff\nGreenhill’s Islamic religion, Defendant A. David Robinson denied Plaintiff Greenhill the free \nexercise of his religion, in violation of Plaintiff Greenhill’s rights under the First Amendment to \nthe  United  States  Constitution.    That  denial  caused  Plaintiff  Greenhill  injury  to  his  First \nAmendment rights. \nCOUNT III: VIOLATION OF PLAINTIFF GREENHILL’S \nRIGHTS UNDER COLOR OF STATE LAW (42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n99. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 98.\n100. At all relevant times, each Defendant acted under color of State law, that is, under\nauthority delegated to them by the Commonwealth of Virginia, with respect to Plaintiff Greenhill. \n101.

In the experience of \namici,  granting  reasonable  requests  for  religious  accommodations—in  Mr. \nGreenhill’s case, by permitting him to watch Jum’ah on television once a week and \nto  maintain  a  four-inch  beard—serves  to  enhance  prison  security  and \nrehabilitation,  while  rejecting  such  requests  has  the  opposite  effect.    The \nimportance of accommodating religion is only heightened when prisoners, like Mr. \nGreenhill, are in long-term solitary confinement.  Amici respectfully submit this \nbrief to set forth the basis for those views. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nAlfonza Hardy Greenhill is an observant Muslim prisoner in the custody of \nthe Virginia Department of Corrections (the “Department”) and housed in solitary \nconfinement.  Consistent with the obligations of his faith, Mr. Greenhill wishes to \nparticipate  in  a  weekly  Friday  prayer—the  Jum’ah—and  maintain  a  four-inch \nbeard.   Based on his security classification, the Department has prevented Mr. \nGreenhill  from  physically  attending  in-person  group  prayer  services  and  from \n3 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-7300      Doc: 28-1            Filed: 01/21/2019      Pg: 9 of 22\n \nwatching the televised service broadcast by the prison.  Additionally, Department \ngrooming policies prohibit Mr. Greenhill from growing the four-inch beard that his \nreligious  observance  requires.    Appellees  have  cited  (and  the  district  court \ncredited) prison security and the success of the Department’s incentive-based Step-\nDown  Program  as  the basis  for denying  Mr.  Greenhill’s  requests  for  religious \naccommodations. \nBased  on  the  observations  and  experience  of  amici  across  a  variety  of \ncorrectional  settings,  Appellees’  prison  security  and  rehabilitation  claims  are \ninconsistent with sound penal policy, contradicted by experience, and not entitled \nto the deference they were given by the court below.  Reasonably accommodating \nindividual religious practice can have a demonstrably positive effect on prisoner \nadjustment and rehabilitation and, as a result, on the prison security environment as \na whole.  In contrast, restrictions that unreasonably impede individual religious \npractice under the banner of prison security and rehabilitation are likely to have the \nopposite  effect.    In  amici’s  experience,  allowing  latitude  in  prisoner  religious \nexercise  meaningfully  contributes  to  both  prison  security  and  individual \nrehabilitation. \nThe district court’s decision should be reversed. \n4 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-7300      Doc: 28-1            Filed: 01/21/2019      Pg: 10 of 22\n \nARGUMENT \nIn the experience of amici, reasonable religious accommodations operate to \nenhance  prison  security  and  individual  rehabilitation.    The  requested \naccommodations in this case are, in fact, far more likely to support prison security \nthan to diminish it.  Consistent with amici’s own experience, an established body \nof academic literature supports the proposition that the free exercise of religion \namong  prisoners  contributes  to  their  adjustment  to  harsh  prison  life  and \nrehabilitation from prior criminal activity.  Both of these effects, in turn, have a \npositive  impact on prison security  and  public safety.    Accordingly,  Appellees’ \nactions  in  denying  Mr.  Greenhill’s  requests  for  reasonable  religious \naccommodations are unlikely to further the cited interests in rehabilitation and \nprison safety on which the district court relied in entering summary judgment in \nAppellees’ favor. \nI.  THE EMPIRICAL LITERATURE DEMONSTRATES THAT \nACCOMMODATING PRISONER RELIGIOUS PRACTICE \nPROMOTES PRISON SECURITY. \nAbundant social science research shows that respecting the right of prisoners \nto  practice  their  religion  promotes  their  adjustment  to  prison  life,  enhances \nrehabilitation, and reduces recidivism.  Amici’s collective experience administering \nprisons confirms this research.  “Broad[ly]” accommodating religious practices to \nthe “maximum extent” permitted by the state’s demonstrated security objectives \n5 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-7300      Doc: 28-1            Filed: 01/21/2019      Pg: 11 of 22\n \nputs  prisons  in the best possible position  to take  advantage  of these  very  real \nbenefits.  42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-3(g). \nA.  Allowing Prisoners to Practice Their Religion Promotes \nAdjustment. \nAllowing prisoners to practice their religion in accordance with their faiths \ncan  serve  an  important  role  in  promoting  prisoners’  adjustment  to  the  new \nenvironment in which they find themselves. \nStudies  show  a  robust  relationship  between  prison  policies  that \naccommodate religious practices and a diminished deviance among prisoners.  This \nrelationship  is  observed  across  various  measures  of  religious  practice  or \nparticipation when tested against indicators of “deviance” as varied as instances of \ndisciplinary confinement, Todd R. Clear & Melvina T. Sumter, Prisoners, Prison, \nand  Religion,  35  J.  of  Offender  Rehab.  125,  125,  152  (2002);  the  number  of \ninfractions, Thomas P. O’Connor & Michael Perryclear, Prison Religion in Action \nand its Influence on Offender Rehabilitation, 35 J. of Offender Rehab. 11, 11, 26, \n28 (2002); and the propensity to engage in conflict with fellow prisoners, Kent R. \nKerley et al., Religiosity, Religious Participation, and Negative Prison Behaviors, \n44 J. for the Sci. Study of Religion 443, 453 (2005).  In sum, multivariable studies \nconsistently show that “religiousness is directly important in reducing infractions,” \n“even  after  other  variables  [like  age  and  prior  record  are]  entered  into  the \nequation.”  Todd R. Clear et al., Does Involvement in Religion Help Prisoners \n6 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-7300      Doc: 28-1            Filed: 01/21/2019      Pg: 12 of 22\n \nAdjust to Prison? NCCD Focus (Nov. 1992), at 1, 4 (confirming the importance of \nreligion as a “potential suppressor of [infractions]” and concluding that religion \nmay help prisoners in “dealing with the emotional strains of incarceration and \ndealing with the deprivations of the prison environment” (emphases in original \nomitted));  see  also  Byron  R.  Johnson,  Religious  Participation  and  Criminal \nBehavior, in Effective Interventions in the Lives of Criminal Offenders 1, 14-15 \n(J.H. Humphrey & P. Cordella eds., 2014).   \nAmici’s  experience  confirms  the  conclusions  in  the  research:  allowing \nprisoners to exercise their religious beliefs can help moderate the harsh impact of \nprison  life,  particularly  where  prisoners  are  housed  in  solitary  confinement.  \nIncarceration  introduces  severe  deprivations  of  freedoms,  including  significant \nimpediments to the ability of religious prisoners to practice their religion at a time \nwhen those prisoners may need the solace and stability provided by their faiths \nmore than ever.  For some, faith and religious exercise can provide a new sense of \npurpose  or  meaning  in  the  absence  of  these  freedoms.    SpearIt,  Religion  as \nRehabilitation?  Reflections on Islam in the Correctional Setting, 34 Whittier L. \nRev. 29, 38-39 (2012); see also O’Connor & Perryclear, supra, at 28 (faith can \ncontribute “hope and motivation to change” for some prisoners in the correctional \nsetting).    For  others,  the  freedom  to  exercise  religious  beliefs  can  lead  to \nengagement with religious communities within the prison, which can have its own \n7 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-7300      Doc: 28-1            Filed: 01/21/2019      Pg: 13 of 22\n \nintrinsic benefits  as well as steering prisoners  away  from  more harmful social \ngroups like prison gangs.  See Clear et al., supra, at 6 (religious exercise “exposes \na prisoner less to the problems of prison life”); SpearIt, supra, at 48.  It is amici’s \nexperience that allowing prisoners reasonable latitude to exercise their religious \nbeliefs  as  they  see  fit  enables  prison  administrators  to  harness  the  positive \ninfluence of religion in the prison setting. \nB.  Accommodating Religious Exercise Promotes Prisoner \nRehabilitation and Reduced Recidivism. \nAllowing prisoners to practice their faith in accordance with their beliefs \nalso promotes rehabilitation and moderates the likelihood of recidivism.  Again, \nthe research is abundant. \nIn  2012,  Byron  R.  Johnson  and  Sung  Joon  Jang  conducted  “the  most \ncomprehensive assessment of the religion-crime literature to date by reviewing 270 \nstudies published between 1944 and 2010.”  Byron R.

The results of this meta-\nanalysis  “confirm[ed]  that  the  vast  majority  of the studies”—approximately  90 \npercent  (244  out  of  270)—“report  pro-social  effects  of  religion  and  religious \ninvolvement on various measures of crime and delinquency.”  Id.  The studies that \nwere part of this systematic review “utilize[d] vastly different methods, samples, \n8 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-7300      Doc: 28-1            Filed: 01/21/2019      Pg: 14 of 22\n \nand  research  designs,”  and  yet  nearly  all  pointed  to  the  same  conclusion:  \n“increasing religiosity is consistently linked with decreases in various measures of \ncrime or delinquency,” a link that was “particularly pronounced among the more \nmethodologically and statistically sophisticated studies that rely upon nationally \nrepresentative samples.”  Id.; accord Byron R.

When asked about which elements were “important for \nsuccessful  rehabilitation  and  reintegration  into  society,”  the  vast  majority  of \nchaplains rated access to religion-related programs as among such elements.  Id. \nat 13, 63.  Indeed, about 73% of surveyed prison chaplains considered access to \n“high-quality religion-related programs” while in prison to be “absolutely critical” \nfor rehabilitation and re-entry, and an additional 23% said those kinds of programs \nwere “very important.”  Id.   \nII.  IN PROMULGATING RLUIPA, CONGRESS WAS WELL AWARE \nOF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RELIGIOUS \nACCOMMODATIONS AND PRISONER REHABILITATION AND \nSECURITY. \nCongress enacted RLUIPA against the foregoing academic backdrop—well \ndeveloped even by 2000, when RLUIPA was passed.  The statute’s text confirms \nCongress’s  determination  that  prison  officials  must  accommodate  religious \nfreedom to the maximum extent possible, and the legislative history is replete with \nreferences to the importance of allowing prisoners the right to exercise their faiths \nas they see fit.  This legislative history again is consonant with amici’s experience. \nFor example, Senator Strom Thurmond observed that for some prisoners, \nallowing religious practice “helps rehabilitate them and makes them less likely to \ncommit  crime  after  they  are  released.”    Religious  Liberty:  Hearing  before  the \n10 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-7300      Doc: 28-1            Filed: 01/21/2019      Pg: 16 of 22\n \nSenate  Committee  on  the  Judiciary  on  issues  relating  to  religious  liberty \nprotection, 106th Cong. 20 (1999) (Statement of Sen. Strom Thurmond).  And \neven while testifying  against the bill, New York’s Department of Correctional \nServices Commissioner acknowledged that “every correction administrator in the \ncountry  recognizes  the  vital  role  played  by  most  religious  practices  and \nbeliefs * * * in  maintaining  a  sense  of  hope  and  purpose  among  individual \nprisoners and in enhancing overall institutional safety and well-being.”  Id. at 175 \n(Prepared Statement of Glenn Goord, Commissioner, New York State Department \nof Correctional Services) (emphasis added).  As Mr. Goord stated:  Most prisoners \nwho sincerely practice their religious beliefs “do not pose institutional problems,” \nbut rather “promote institutional stability.”  Id.  Indeed, witnesses emphasized the \n“societal interest” in protecting prisoner religious liberty, given that “[r]eligious \nobservance  by  prisoners  is  strongly  correlated  with  successful  rehabilitation.”  \nProtecting Religious Freedom After Boerne v. Flores: Hearing Before the House \nof Representatives Subcomm. on the Constitution of the Comm. on the Judiciary, \n105th  Cong.  7  (1997)  (Testimony  and  Prepared  Statement  of  Charles  Colson, \nPresident,  Prison  Fellowship  Ministries)  (the  “Protecting  Religious  Freedom \nHearing”); see also id. at 76, 79 (peaceful practice of prisoners’ religious beliefs \nhas been shown empirically “to have powerful rehabilitative effects” (Testimony \n11 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-7300      Doc: 28-1            Filed: 01/21/2019      Pg: 17 of 22\n \nand  Prepared  Statement  of  Prof.  Thomas  C.  Berg,  Cumberland  Law  School, \nSamford University)).3 \nThis abundant testimony was not lost on Congress.  In a floor statement \nurging the passage of RLUIPA, Senator Hatch explained that “[s]incere faith and \nworship  can  be  an  indispensable  part  of  rehabilitation,  and  these  protections \n[provided by the bill] should be an important part of that process.”  146 Cong. Rec. \nS6687, S6689 (daily ed. July 13, 2000) (Statement of Sen. Hatch on behalf of \nhimself  and  Sens.  Kennedy,  Hutchison,  Daschle,  Bennett,  Lieberman  and \nSchumer).  In sum, the rehabilitative impact of freedom of religious practice was \nsquarely before Congress when it considered and passed RLUIPA in 2000, and \nconstituted a motivating factor in the passage of the bill. \nIII.  COURTS AND EXPERTS RECOGNIZE THE POSITIVE IMPACT \nTHAT ACCOMMODATING RELIGIOUS EXERCISE CAN HAVE \nON PRISONER ADJUSTMENT AND REHABILITATION. \nCourts,  too,  have  recognized  the  salutary  relationship  between \naccommodating religious practices inside prison and a prisoner’s adjustment and \nrehabilitation.  Most recently, taking note of “‘the policies followed at other well-\n                                            \n3 See also Protecting Religious Freedom Hearing at 59, 86 (Testimony of Sixth \nCircuit  Judge  Jeffrey  Sutton,  then  Solicitor  of  the  State  of  Ohio)  (discussing \npositive  role  of  religion  in  rehabilitation);  Protecting  Religious  Freedom  After \nBoerne  v.  Flores  (Part  III):  Hearing  Before  the  House  of  Representatives \nSubcomm. on the Constitution of the Comm. on the Judiciary, 105th Cong. 40, 43 \n(1998) (Testimony and Prepared Statement of Isaac M. Jaroslawicz, Director of \nLegal Affairs, Aleph Institute) (same). \n12 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-7300      Doc: 28-1            Filed: 01/21/2019      Pg: 18 of 22\n \nrun  institutions’”  with  respect  to  beard  length  restrictions,  the  Supreme  Court \nconcluded:  “That  so  many  other  prisons  allow  inmates  to  grow  beards  while \nensuring prison safety and security suggests that the Department could satisfy its \nsecurity  concerns  through  a  means  less  restrictive  than  denying  petitioner  the \nexemption he seeks.”   Holt v. Hobbs, 135 S. Ct. 853, 866-67 (2015) (quoting \nProcunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 414 n.14 (1974)) (finding that grooming \npolicy violated RLUIPA “insofar as it prevents petitioner from growing a ½-inch \nbeard in accordance with his religious beliefs”).  Similarly, in Brown v. Livingston, \na Texas prisoner challenged prison policies that prevented unsupervised gatherings \nof more than four persons for religious services and limited the supervision of \nprisoners for the purpose of holding religious services to no more than one hour \nper week.  17 F. Supp. 3d 616, 619 (S.D. Tex. 2014).  The court held evidentiary \nhearings and received “undisputed testimony” that “overall, the regular practice of \nreligion improves prison safety.”  Id. at 626.  The court acknowledged the body of \nsocial science research supporting this point, and found that allowing religious \nprisoners  to  practice  their  faith  makes  for  a  safer  prison  unit  and  a  safer \ncommunity.  Id.  Even the State’s witnesses supported these points.  Id. \nIn  sum,  courts  recognize  that  “accommodating  a  genuine  religious \nobservance might reduce rather than increase the risk of prisoner misconduct.”  \nGrayson v. Schuler, 666 F.3d 450, 453 (7th Cir. 2012); see also Sasnett v. Sullivan, \n13 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-7300      Doc: 28-1            Filed: 01/21/2019      Pg: 19 of 22\n \n908 F. Supp. 1429, 1439 (W.D. Wis. 1995), aff’d, 91 F.3d 1018 (7th Cir. 1996), \ncert.  granted,  judgment  vacated  on  other  grounds,  521  U.S.  1114  (1997) \n(“Religious practice confers many benefits to prisoners.  Religious practice and \nfaith can introduce an element of morality into inmates’ thinking that leads them to \nbehave lawfully.  Religious practice and faith can give prisoners a great degree of \npersonal satisfaction.  Inmates who are involved in church activities and who are \nbehaving in ways consistent with religion usually act in ways that are consistent \nwith penological goals.”).  That conclusion is consistent with the experience of \namici  demonstrating  that  reasonable  religious  accommodations  support  prison \nsafety and enhance the rehabilitation of individual prisoners. \n*  *  * \n \nThat  accommodation  of  religion  can  have  a  positive  impact  on  prisoner \nrehabilitation and prison security is well established in social science research and \nacademic literature, was a motivating factor underlying RLUIPA’s passage, and \nhas  been  routinely  recognized  by  the  judiciary.    It  also  is  consistent  with  the \npractical experience of amici across diverse correctional systems.  The modest \nreligious  accommodations  that  Mr.  Greenhill  requests  fall  well  within  the \n“maximum  extent”  available  under  the  law,  42  U.S.C.  §  2000cc-3(g),  and  are \nlikely to promote (rather than to detract from) prison safety.  \n \n14 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-7300      Doc: 28-1            Filed: 01/21/2019      Pg: 20 of 22\n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, as well as those set forth in Plaintiff-Appellant’s \nbrief, the District Court’s judgment should be reversed. \n  Respectfully submitted, \n   /s/ Elizabeth Hagerty \n  ALLEN P.

CLARKE, ET AL.,  )       By:  James P. Jones \n    )       United States District Judge \n                            Defendants.  )   \n \nAlfonza Hardy Greenhill, Pro Se Plaintiff. \nThe plaintiff in this prisoner civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 seeks \na preliminary injunction.  After review of the record, I conclude that the motion \nmust be denied. \nGreenhill is an inmate at Virginia’s Red Onion State Prison.  In both his \nComplaint and the motion, Greenhill alleges that the defendant prison officials are \nburdening his right to free exercise of his Islamic religious beliefs in three separate \nrespects, in violation of his rights under the First Amendment and the Religious \nLand Use and Institutionalized Persons Act.  In particular, he claims that (1) as a \nSecurity S inmate, he cannot be bodily present at the Friday night Jum’ah service \nand, without access to a television, cannot be visually present for a videotaped \nversion of Jum’ah that the prsion broadcasts; (2) he is not allowed to grow his \nbeard to the length of his fist as his religion requires, absent restrictive living \n \n \n\nconditions  and  loss  of  privileges;  and  (3)  his  religious  diet  meal  trays  are \ncontaminated when placed in the tray slot box where other, unclean items must \nalso be placed.  In his motion seeking preliminary injunctive relief, Greenhill asks \nthe court to order the defendants to provide a communal television broadcast of \nJum’ah, to revise the grooming policy to allow him to grow a four-inch beard (the \nlength of his fist) in general population living conditions, and to return to utilizing \nremovable  tray  slot  boxes  for  Level  S  inmates,  with  one  such  box,  properly \ncleaned, to be used exclusively for serving religious meals. \n“A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of \nright.”  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  The party \nseeking the preliminary injunction must make a clear showing “that he is likely to \nsucceed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary  relief,  that  the  balance  of  equities  tips  in  his  favor,  and  that  an \ninjunction is in the public interest.”  Id. at 20.  A “plaintiff[] seeking preliminary \nrelief  [must]  demonstrate  that  irreparable  injury  is  likely  in  the  absence  of  an \ninjunction.    Id.  at  22.    Because  the  primary  purpose  of  injunctive  relief  is  to \npreserve the status quo pending a resolution on the merits, interlocutory injunctive \nrelief that changes the status quo pending trial cannot be “availed of to secure a \npiecemeal  trial” and  will only  be granted  when  the  court  determines  that  “the \n-2- \n \n\nexigencies of the situation demand such relief.”  Wetzel v. Edwards, 635 F.2d 283, \n286 (4th Cir. 1980).  \nAfter  review  of  the  record,  I  conclude  that  Greenhill  has  not  made  the \nrequired showings for interlocutory injunctive relief.  His motion seeks to change \nthe  status  quo  —  to  achieve  court-ordered  changes  to  the  prison’s  established \naccommodations of Islamic religious beliefs.  Rather than maintaining the status \nquo between the parties, granting the requested relief would require prison officials \nto  expend  substantial  resources  and  alter  established  Virginia  Department  of \nCorrections  and  institutional  procedures.    Moreover,  Greenhill  has  not \ndemonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of his claims or irreparable \nharm he will suffer absent the requested interlocutory court intervention.  His own \nallegations  indicate  that  the  defendants  have  taken  substantial  steps  to \naccommodate his religious dietary beliefs and provide him supplies to clean his \ncell, including his tray slot box.  The record also reflects that officials will allow \nGreenhill to grow his beard to the length that his religion dictates, provided that he \nremain in a more secure housing unit.     \nI also cannot find that the balance of the equities tips in Greenhill’s favor or \nthat the public interest will be best served by requiring prison officials to assume \nthe financial burdens required to achieve the changes to Level S living conditions \nthat  Greenhill  proposes,  before  his  claims  are  resolved  through  the  normal \n-3- \n \n\nlitigation process.  “In exercising their sound discretion, courts of equity should \npay particular regard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary \nremedy  of  injunction.”    Winter,  555  U.S.  at  24  (internal  quotation  marks  and \ncitations omitted); see also Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 548 n.23, 29 (1979) \n(noting  that  operating  penal  institutions  in  manageable  fashion  involves \n“considerations [that] are peculiarly within the province and professional expertise \nof  corrections  officials”  to  which  courts  should  give  “substantial  deference”) \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).   \nFurthermore, to grant the relief Greenhill seeks, I would have to decide, \nprematurely, the very legal questions he raises in his Complaint and order the \ndefendants to make drastic changes to the status quo.  Deciding issues in this \npiecemeal fashion is highly discouraged.  Wetzel, 635 F.2d at 286.  I simply do not \nfind any “exigencies” in Greenhill’s current situation that warrant the immediate \ncourt intervention he seeks. \nFor  the  reasons  stated,  I  will  deny  Greenhill’s  motion  for  preliminary \ninjunctive relief.   \nA separate Order will be entered herewith.   \n            DATED:   March 23, 2016 \n              /s/  James P. Jones      \n              United States District Judge \n-4- \n ",
