          "description": "TEXT ORDER: At the 5/26/22 status conference, Defendants raised the possibility of having the same jury decide damages if the jury first decided for Plaintiffs on liability, in order to avoid a duplicative trial. The Court is concerned about prolonging this trial, confusing the jury, and complicating the case on the eve of trial. The Fourth Amendment claim is an objective inquiry whereas a punitive damages claim is a subjective inquiry. Further, whether punitive damages would be available in light of the verdict in Defendants' favor on the Eighth Amendment claim is debatable. Whether any compensatory damages are available is also unclear since there was no physical injury. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(e). The parties do not explain what additional evidence they will introduce in the damages phase, and the final pretrial order would need to be amended as well as additional jury instructions proposed. The Court questions whether this jury should consider damages. The parties need to explain what damages are available, what additional evidence is necessary, and what additional jury instructions and verdict forms are needed. Potential jurors will nonetheless be informed that the trial may last through June 10, 2022. Entered by Judge Sue E. Myerscough on 05/27/2022. (SG)"

Following the filing of the Motion to Dismiss, the Plaintiffs filed a two-count First Amended Complaint (d/e 17 ) that omits the claim for indemnification. In addition, the Plaintiffs have filed a Response to the Motion to Dismiss (d/e 18 ), in which they (1) note the filing of the First Amended Complaint, and (2) request that the Court deny the Motion to Dismiss Count III as moot. In light of these developments, the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Count III (d/e 15 ) is DENIED AS MOOT. Entered by Judge Richard Mills on 06/22/2012. (VM, ilcd)"

The Court is concerned about prolonging this trial, confusing the jury, and complicating the case on the eve of trial. The Fourth Amendment claim is an objective inquiry whereas a punitive damages claim is a subjective inquiry. Further, whether punitive damages would be available in light of the verdict in Defendants' favor on the Eighth Amendment claim is debatable. Whether any compensatory damages are available is also unclear since there was no physical injury. 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e). The parties do not explain what additional evidence they will introduce in the damages phase, and the final pretrial order would need to be amended as well as additional jury instructions proposed. The Court questions whether this jury should consider damages. The parties need to explain what damages are available, what additional evidence is necessary, and what additional jury instructions and verdict forms are needed. Potential jurors will nonetheless be informed that the trial may last through June 10, 2022. Entered by Judge Sue E. Myerscough on 05/27/2022. (SG)"

    "summary": "<p>On March 31, 2011, female prisoners at an Illinois women&rsquo;s prison were strip searched as part of a training exercise for new guards. Several of the prisoners filed this putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois. The plaintiffs sued the Illinois Department of Corrections, Lincoln Correctional Center, and Logan Correctional Center under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Represented by civil rights attorneys Loevy and Loevy, they sought damages, costs and attorney&rsquo;s fees, punitive damages, and injunctive relief against three types of defendants: Members of the correctional facility tactical unit, who escorted the plaintiffs to the area where the searches were conducted, correctional officers who conducted the searches, and members of the Illinois Department of Corrections administration. The complaint alleged that the strip searches were conducted in a way that violated the Fourth and Eighth Amendments. Specifically, they claimed that the strip searches were unnecessary, demeaning, dehumanizing, and humiliating.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs had to stand naked in a line with 8-10 other inmates in a room with other inmates and guards who were not conducting the searches. The prisoners who were menstruating had to remove their menstrual products, they were not given new ones, and many got blood on themselves, their clothes, and the floor. The prisoners had to stand barefoot and naked on a floor covered in menstrual blood, raise their breasts, lift their hair, turn around, bend over, spread their buttocks and vaginas, and cough.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Richard Mills. On October 21, 2014 Judge Mills granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for class certification. 2014 WL 5349870 (C.D. Ill. 2014). Judge Mills certified the two classes. Class I included all individuals subjected to the March 31, 2011 strip search at Lincoln Correctional Center. Class II included all women who are incarcerated at Logan Correctional Center and all women who will be incarcerated at Logan Correctional Center in the future. Lincoln Correctional Center was converted to an all-male prison and the majority of inmates were sent to Logan Correctional Center.</p>\r\n<p>On April 14, 2016 the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on the Fourth Amendment claim, holding that a visual inspection of a prisoner did not constitute an unreasonable search. 2016 WL 11265636 (C.D. Ill. 2016). The district court denied summary judgment on the Eighth Amendment claim and that claim went to trial.</p>\r\n<p>A jury trial was held before Judge Mills on November 14-18, 2016. On November 21, 2016, the jury returned a verdict for the defendants, finding that the searches had not been intended to humiliate or conducted to gain sexual gratification. Judge Mills entered the verdict for the defendants on November 22, 2016. The plaintiffs appealed; they did not contest the jury verdict against them on the Eighth Amendment claim but appealed to the Seventh Circuit to reinstate the Fourth Amendment claim. (Docket No. 16-04234).</p>\r\n<p>On November 30, 2017, the case was argued in front of a panel of three judges: Circuit Judge Frank H. Easterbrook, Circuit Judge Daniel A. Manion, and District Judge John Z. Lee (sitting by designation). On July 16, 2019, the Seventh Circuit issued an opinion affirming the decision of the District Court that granted summary judgment to the defendants. Judge Lee dissented, arguing that whether or not the Fourth Amendment applied depended on whether the prisoners had a reasonable expectation of privacy, not on whether guards or the prisoners themselves conducted the searches. 930 F.3d 836 (7th Cir. 2019).</p>\r\n<p>Rehearing en banc was granted December 18, 2019. 788 Fed. Appx. 387 (Mem). On May 14, 2020 the case was argued en banc via Zoom.</p>\r\n<p>On August 11, 2020 the en banc Seventh Circuit reversed the previous panel&rsquo;s ruling. In an opinion by Circuit Judge Amy J. St. Eve, the court held that &ldquo;the Fourth Amendment protects a right to bodily privacy for convicted prisoners, albeit in a significantly limited way, including during visual inspections.&rdquo; 969 F.3d 769, 774. The Seventh Circuit then remanded the case back to District Court for further proceedings on the plaintiff&rsquo;s Fourth Amendment claims. Judge Easterbrook, who wrote the reversed panel opinion in this case, filed a dissent, arguing that convicted prisoners have no rights under the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 788.</p>\r\n<p>After remand, preparations for trial continued. On August 19, 2021, Judge Mills denied a motion for dismissal by members of the tactical unit and prison administrators on qualified immunity grounds and transferred the case to Judge Sue E. Myerscough. Judge Myerscough ordered parallel mediation for a possible settlement to begin on September 9, 2021.</p>\r\n<p>Preparations for trial continued, and on May 23, 2022 a number of defendants reinstated after the 7th Circuit decision requested leave to file for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds. These defendants were all correctional officers or members of the correctional facility tactical unit. Jury selection began on May 31, 2022. The same day, plaintiffs requested the dismissal of five defendant tactical unit members and correctional officers. Defendants did not contest this motion and Judge Myerscough dismissed them from the case. The IDOC administrators, one tactical unit member, and one correctional officer remained in the case. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 7, 2022, the jury found the prison administrators and a tactical unit member liable for violating the individual plaintiffs&rsquo; 4th Amendment rights. Specifically, the liable defendants were found to have directly participated in the search, that they failed to intervene in an unconstitutional search, and that they bore supervisory liability for the search. This liability also extended to the certified class of plaintiffs. The jury did not find any liability for the correctional officer. In addition to determining liability for both the individual plaintiffs and the class of plaintiffs as a whole, the jury awarded $20,000 in compensatory damages and a further $5,500 in punitive damages to each named plaintiff. The punitive damages were imposed only on the IDOC administrators.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Upon receipt of the jury verdict, the defendants requested that Judge Myerscough either enter a directed verdict in their favor by way of qualified immunity or a holding that the issues at hand had been litigated in the initial phase of trial. Alternatively, the defendants requested that she hold a new trial for the same reasons. Judge Myerscough denied this motion on October 25, 2022, in an opinion noting that every issue presented in the directed verdict motion had previously been forfeited or had been agreed to by plaintiffs. Judge Myerscough concluded that allowing a directed verdict or a new trial would be unfair to the plaintiffs, as the plaintiffs had built their trial strategy on the basis of these forfeitures and agreements. &nbsp;Defendants filed a request with Judge Myerscough for interlocutory appeal of these issues as well as a stay of proceedings. Judge Myerscough denied the defendants&rsquo; request for an interlocutory appeal and stay of proceedings on January 4, 2023. She noted that a stay pending appeal would increase cost to plaintiffs and would unreasonably extend timeline, effectively shrinking the class by those eligible dying or not realizing their eligibility for compensation due to temporal distance from the events.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 9, 2023, the parties met for a settlement conference. Two months later, on March 20, the case was reassigned to Judge Colleen R. Lawless, who had been recently appointed to the federal bench.</p>\r\n<p>Later that year, on August 11, the plaintiffs moved for preliminary approval of a class action settlement agreement. Under the agreement, individual class members who were subject to the 2011 strip search would receive about $7,535, with class representatives and people who testified or appeared in order to testify receiving additional incentives, up to a total of $119,000 for all incentive awards combined. Furthermore, class counsel could move for attorneys' fees, as long as the overall payment by defendants was no greater than $3 million. Any money that the defendants paid to the class that did not go to class members would go to the Illinois Prison Project of Restore Justice and Chicago Legal Advocacy for Incarcerated Mothers as <em>cy pres </em>funds. The court would retain jurisdiction to enforce the agreement.</p>\r\n<p>The court granted the motion for preliminary approval three days later, but final approval for the settlement requires a future fairness hearing.</p>\r\n<p>As of October 2, 2023, the case was ongoing.</p>",

The inmates claimed that their constitutional rights under the Fourth and Eighth Amendment were violated during a 2011 strip-search. In 2016, the district court entered judgement in favor of the defendants and the inmates appealed to the Seventh Circuit.  The case was argued in 2017 in front of a panel of three judges and in 2019 the district court's decision was affirmed.  The inmates petitioned for rehearing en banc, which was granted.  The case was reargued in front of the Seventh Circuit via Zoom (due to COVID-19) in May of 2020. On August 11, 202 the en banc Seventh Circuit reversed the panel decision, finding that the plaintiffs had a limited Fourth Amendment right bodily privacy, and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings. On remand, the inmates successfully obtained a verdict against prison officials. Litigation is ongoing to determine the damages to be awarded to the class of inmates whose rights were similarly violated. A preliminary class action settlement was approved on August 14, 2023.",

This is an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 challenging the unjustified, \ninvasive and humiliating public strip search inflicted upon female inmates at Lincoln \nCorrectional Center (“Lincoln”) on March 31, 2011. \n2.  On the morning of March 31, 2011, Assistant Warden Reynolds, members of \nLincoln’s “Orange Crush” tactical team, and other Lincoln correctional officers stormed the \ndormitories of Housing Units 2B and 4B and ordered all of the women to line up by the beds.  \nThe officers handcuffed the women and marched them to the gym, yelling obscenities and \nthreats as they walked.  Once in the gym, the officers forced the women to stand facing the wall, \nshoulder to shoulder, for more than one hour.  The women were then publicly strip searched in \ngroups of four to six, within plain view of male correctional officers, male cadets, and civilians.  \nAs the women were being strip searched, many of the correctional officers made derogatory \ncomments and insulting gestures about the women’s body parts and odors.    The women were \nforced to wait until everyone had been strip searched before being permitted to return to their \ndormitories. \n3.  The incident lasted nearly four hours and was unsanitary, sexually invasive, \ndegrading, and dehumanizing.  The women were never told why they were being searched, and \nwhen they inquired, the officers ignored their questions and threatened to punish them if they \ndidn’t stay quiet. \n4.  In fact, this group strip search was a “training exercise” for Illinois Department of \nCorrections cadets, organized by one or more as-yet unknown Illinois Department of Corrections \nemployees.  There was no legitimate purpose for subjecting the women to this public group strip \n2 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 1    Page 3 of 14                                               \n    \nsearch – it was unrelated to institutional security, discipline or order, and none of the women \nsearched were suspected of possessing contraband or having committed other prohibited activity. \n5.  Lincoln Correctional Center had no justification to force the women to submit to \nthis public group strip search or to force them to endure such an unsanitary, humiliating and \ndegrading process.  Nevertheless, as-yet unknown Illinois Department of Corrections employees \norganized and approved of this cadet training exercise, thereby instituting an unconstitutional \npublic group strip search and turning a blind eye to the dehumanizing way in which the search \nwas conducted. \n6.  Plaintiffs bring this class action to compensate those who were victimized by this \npublic group strip search and, hopefully, to bring change. \nJurisdiction and Venue \n7.  The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1367 as Plaintiffs assert claims under federal law and the state law claim arises out of the same \nfacts as the federal claims. \n8.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) as the events giving rise to the claims \nin this case all occurred in this judicial district. \nParties \n9.  Named Plaintiff BEVERLY THROGMORTON is 46 years old.  She resides in \nDecatur, Illinois.  At the time of the events at issue in this case, Ms. Throgmorton was \nincarcerated at Lincoln Correctional Center, and was one of the women in Housing Unit 2B that \nwas forcibly and publicly strip searched on March 31, 2011. \n3 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 1    Page 4 of 14                                               \n    \n10.  Named Plaintiff DELORES HENRY is 57 years old.  She is an inmate at Lincoln \nCorrectional Center, and was one of the women in Housing Unit 2B that was forcibly and \npublicly strip searched on March 31, 2011. \n11.  Named Plaintiff PATRICIA PHILLIPS is 44 years old.  She is an inmate at \nLincoln Correctional Center, and was one of the women in Housing Unit 2B that was forcibly \nand publicly strip searched on March 31, 2011. \n12.  Lincoln Correctional Center is one of three facilities run by the Illinois \nDepartment of Corrections (“IDOC”) that houses female inmates.  It is a medium security prison \nand houses approximately one thousand women. \n13.  On or about March 31, 2011, and at all times relevant to the events at issue in this \ncase, Defendants EDMONSON, JOHNSON, LEONETTI, DOWDY, PFEIFFER, CRAIG, \nSLATER, and as-yet Unknown Correctional Officers were employed by the IDOC and worked \nas “Orange Crush” tactical team members at Lincoln Correctional Center.  As such, these \nDefendants (hereinafter, the “Orange Crush Defendants”) were acting under color of law. \n14.  On or about March 31, 2011, and at all times relevant to the events at issue in this \ncase, Defendants DALLAS, ANDERSON, KRUDUP, and as-yet Unknown Correctional \nOfficers were employed by the IDOC and worked as correctional officers at Lincoln \nCorrectional Center.  As such, these Defendants (hereinafter, the “Defendant Officers”) were \nacting under color of law. \n15.  On or about March 31, 2011, and at all times relevant to the events at issue in this \ncase, Defendant REYNOLDS was employed by the IDOC in the capacity of Assistant Warden of \nLincoln Correctional Center.  As such, Defendant Reynolds was acting under color of law. \n4 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 1    Page 5 of 14                                               \n    \n16.  On or about March 31, 2011, and at all times relevant to the events at issue in this \ncase, one or more as-yet Unknown IDOC employees at Lincoln Correctional Center were in \ncharge of permitting the IDOC cadets to perform this public group strip search at Lincoln.  These \nas-yet Unknown Defendant IDOC Employees were employed by IDOC and, as such, were acting \nunder color of law. \n17.  On or about March 31, 2011, and at all times relevant to the events at issue in this \ncase, one or more as-yet Unknown IDOC employees were in charge of organizing and arranging \nfor the IDOC cadets to perform the public group strip search at Lincoln Correctional Center.  \nThese as-yet Unknown Defendant IDOC Employees were employed by IDOC and, as such, were \nacting under color of law. \nFacts Relating to the Named Plaintiffs \n18.  On the morning of March 31, 2011, Named Plaintiffs Throgmorton, Henry, and \nPhillips (the “Named Plaintiffs”) were in Housing Unit 2B at Lincoln Correctional Center when \nthe Orange Crush Defendants, Defendants Reynolds and Dowless, and IDOC cadets stormed the \nUnit.  Immediately thereafter, the Defendants and IDOC cadets stormed Housing Unit 4B. \n19.  The Defendants walked through the Units yelling and banging their batons, and \nordered all the inmates to the dormitory.  Once in the dormitory, the Defendants searched the \nwomen, handcuffed their hands behind their backs, and marched them to the day room.  During \nthe walk, several of the Orange Crush Defendants screamed obscenities at the women, called \nthem derogatory names, and threatened to place them in segregation if they disobeyed.  There \nwas no need for this abuse, as the women were all compliant. \n20.  From the day room, the handcuffed women were taken to the gym, where the \nremaining Defendant Officers were waiting.  The Orange Crush Defendants, the Defendant \n5 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 1    Page 6 of 14                                               \n    \nOfficers and Defendant Reynolds forced the women to stand shoulder to shoulder facing the gym \nwall for approximately one hour.  At no point did any of the Defendants tell Plaintiffs \nThrogmorton, Henry, Phillips, or any of the other women what was happening, or why.  Instead, \nthey continued to scream at and threaten the women. \n21.  Forced to stand for such a lengthy duration under stress and intimidation, some of \nthe women experienced seizures; others soiled themselves. \n22.  When approximately one hour had passed, the female Defendants began to take \ngroups of women, ranging in size from four to six women, into two rooms abutting the gym: the \nbathroom and the beauty shop.  The bathroom was open to the gym, giving the male Defendants \nand the male IDOC cadets clear views of the women.  The beauty shop had mirrored walls and a \ndoor that remained open for the duration of the strip searches, subjecting the naked women to \nstares from the correctional officers, civilian employees and cadets who walked by.  The beauty \nshop also had a window that faced the outdoors, permitting anyone outside to observe the women \ninside.  The civilian beauty shop supervisor was never told to leave, and remained in the shop for \nthe duration of the strip searches. \n23.  Named Plaintiff Henry was among the groups of women taken into the bathroom \nfor public group strip searches.  In the bathroom, groups of four to six women were forced to \nremove their clothing and stand in a line.  Due to the number of inmates, cadets, and correctional \nofficers occupying the cramped space, the naked women were forced to stand nearly shoulder to \nshoulder.  The women on their menstrual cycles were told to take out their tampons, but were not \npermitted to do so privately, so they had to remove them in plain view of the other inmates, \ncorrectional officers, and cadets.  Because they were not allowed to use the toilets, the women \nwere forced to discard their used tampons into a communal garbage bin. \n6 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 1    Page 7 of 14                                               \n    \n24.  Standing close together, shoulders touching, the women were forced to raise their \nbreasts, lift their hair, and cough and squat several times.  They were then forced to turn their \nbacksides to the cadets, bend over and spread open their buttocks and vaginas.  As they did this, \nmale cadets and correctional officers could, and did, watch them from the gym.  Some of the \nDefendant Officers and Orange Crush Defendants made insulting and derogatory comments \nabout the women’s odors and body parts. \n25.  Throughout the strip searches, the women were forced to stand barefoot on the \nbathroom floor, which was dirty with menstrual blood and other bodily fluids.  The women’s \nclothes were discarded on that floor during the searches.  At no point did any Defendant or other \nIDOC employee make any attempt to clean the area where the women were standing. \n26.  Women on their menstrual cycle were not given tampons after the strip searches.  \nRather, they were forced to put their clothing back on with glib suggestions that they use toilet \npaper if necessary.  Many of these women got blood on their legs, feet, and clothes.  They were \nthen sent back to the gym to wait until everyone had been strip searched. \n27.  Ms. Henry had been strip searched on numerous occasions at Lincoln \nCorrectional Center prior to the March 31, 2011 public group strip search.  Those strip searches \nwere conducted privately and efficiently. \n28.  Named Plaintiffs Throgmorton and Phillips were among the women taken to the \nbeauty shop for public group strip searches.  One or more Defendants and several IDOC cadets \nwere in the beauty shop, along with the civilian beauty shop supervisor.  The Defendants chatted \nwith the beauty shop supervisor and paid little attention to the strip searches taking place before \nthem.   \n7 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 1    Page 8 of 14                                               \n    \n29.  In the beauty shop, the IDOC cadets initially ordered the women, one at a time, to \nstand in front of the other women and remove all of their clothes.  In front of the other inmates \nand the civilian beauty shop supervisor, and in plain view of the window to the outdoors, Ms. \nThrogmorton was forced to lift her breasts, raise her hair, hold her buttocks open with her hands \nand squat and cough three times.  Ms. Throgmorton was then forced to stand with her backside \nfacing the inmates, bend over, and spread her buttocks and vagina, in plain view of the other \nwomen and any passersby.  Ms. Throgmorton was kept naked for 15 to 20 minutes. \n30.  During her term of incarceration at Lincoln, Ms. Throgmorton was strip searched \nregularly for her job.  Ms. Throgmorton estimates that she was strip searched between 150 and \n200 times.  Those strip searches were conducted professionally, privately, and quickly. \n31.  When one or more of the Defendants commented that the individual strip searches \nwere taking too long, the IDOC cadets began to strip search the women in the beauty shop in \ngroups.  Ms. Phillips was ordered to disrobe and stand in a group with four other women, nearly \ntouching.  Ms. Phillips was subjected to the same strip search process as Ms. Throgmorton: the \nbreast raising, the squat and coughs, and the bending over to expose her private parts.  At some \npoint, Ms. Phillips observed one of the Defendant Officers put a bandana over her nose, \ngesturing rudely about the women’s odors.  When it was over, the women were sent back to the \ngym to wait. \n32.  Ms. Phillips had experienced other routine strip searches at Lincoln Correctional \nCenter.  Those strip searches were conducted privately and professionally. \n33.  After everyone had been strip searched, the women were finally dismissed.  The \nline to the showers that afternoon was twenty women long.  The women were later told that the \nincident had been a training exercise for the IDOC cadets. \n8 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 1    Page 9 of 14                                               \n    \n34.  Throughout the incident, Ms. Throgmorton, Ms. Phillips, Ms. Henry, and the \nother women were forced to endure humiliation, degradation, and threats.  These highly intrusive \nstrip searches afforded no privacy to the women; were conducted under unsanitary, harassing and \nhumiliating conditions; and were carried out by the Defendants in an abusive manner. \n35.  There was no valid justification for these public group strip searches.  They were \nnot driven by concerns regarding Lincoln’s institutional security or employee or inmate safety, \nand there was no suspicion that any of the women in Housing Units 2B and 4B were \nparticipating in illicit conduct requiring further investigation, discipline or punishment.   \n36.  The public group strip searches inflicted on the women at Lincoln are the most \nintrusive types of searches the government can conduct, and the manner in which they were \nconducted was degrading, dehumanizing, and humiliating. \n37.  All of the Defendants, from Assistant Warden Reynolds to the individual \ncorrectional officers, participated in and were present for the entire duration of the incident. \n38.  Ms. Throgmorton, Ms. Phillips, Ms. Henry, and others promptly wrote grievances \nabout the strip searches.  Their grievances were left in the grievance boxes for days, even as the \nNamed Plaintiffs repeatedly asked Defendants and other correctional officers to attend to them.  \nAlthough the grievances were finally taken out of the boxes, in the nearly one year that has \npassed, not a single woman has received a response to her grievance. \nClass Allegations \n39.  Lincoln Correctional Center, located in Logan County, Illinois, is one of three \nprisons within the Illinois Department of Corrections that houses female inmates.   \n9 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 1    Page 10 of 14                                              \n     \n40.  Named Plaintiffs THROGMORTON, HENRY and PHILLIPS seek to pursue \nclaims both for themselves and for a class of others similarly situated (the “Class”) pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3). \n41.  Named Plaintiffs THROGMORTON, HENRY and PHILLIPS seek to represent a \nclass consisting of the following people:  All individuals who were subjected to the March 31, \n2011 public group strip search at Lincoln Correctional Center. \n42.  The individuals in this class are so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpractical.  The Named Plaintiffs estimate that at least one hundred women are members of the \nClass. \n43.  There are questions of law and fact common to the claims of the Class.  Among \nthese common questions are: \na.  Whether the public strip search was an unreasonable search in violation of the \nFourth and/or the Eighth Amendments; \nb.  Whether the use of the public strip search and/or the way in which it was \nconducted violates the inmates’ rights under the Fourth and/or Eighth Amendments; \nc.  Whether the responsible IDOC employees instituted, condoned, and/or were \ndeliberately indifferent to the risk of the violations of the Class members’ rights; and \nd.  Whether the responsible IDOC employees at Lincoln Correctional Center \nfailed in their supervisory responsibilities to have avoided and/or put a stop to the violations of \nthe Class members’ rights. \n44.  The claims of the Named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the Class.  The \nNamed Plaintiffs were inmates at Lincoln Correctional Center and were subjected to the March \n31, 2011 public group strip search.  They seek to prove that the public group strip search violated \n10 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 1    Page 11 of 14                                              \n     \ntheir rights under the Fourth, Fourteenth, and Eighth Amendments, and that each of the \nDefendants is liable as a result. \n45.  The Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the \nClass.  They have retained skilled counsel with experience in class action, constitutional, and \nstrip search litigation. \n46.  The questions of law and fact common to the Class predominate over any \nindividual issues.  In addition, a class action would be the most fair and efficient method of \nadjudicating the Class members’ claims. \nCount I – Claims Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nViolations of the Fourth & Fourteenth Amendments \n \n47.  Plaintiffs re-allege each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully stated herein. \n48.  There was no valid penological justification for the March 31, 2011 public group \nstrip search. \n49.  By instituting and continuing the public group strip search described in fuller \ndetail above, Defendants subjected Named Plaintiffs and the members of the Class to an \nunreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment. \n50.

The Defendants have not responded to the\nmotion.    \nI.\nThis action was initiated as a putative class action on March 20, 2012\nand relates to actions taken on March 31, 2011, by employees of the\nIllinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) at the Lincoln Correctional\nCenter in Lincoln, Illinois.  The Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive\n\nrelief.    \nOn  July  29,  2013,  the  Court  granted  the  Plaintiffs’  Motion  for\nCertification of a Rule 23(b)(3) “Damages Class.”  Although it denied\ncertification of the “Injunctive Relief Class,” the Court granted leave to the\nPlaintiffs  to  amend  their  complaint  and  file  a  new  motion  for  class\ncertification.  The Sixth Amended Complaint is the operative complaint\nnow before the Court.     \nThe  Damages  Class  is  comprised  of  female  inmates  who  were\nsubjected  to  a  humiliating  and  degrading  public  group  strip  search\nperformed during an IDOC Training Academy “cadet training exercise” on\nMarch 31, 2011.  The Plaintiffs now seek certification of a Rule 23(b)(2)\nclass so that they may obtain injunctive relief on behalf of themselves and\nall women at Logan Correctional Center. \nPreviously, the Plaintiffs proposed two classes:\nClass I (“Damages Class”): All individuals who were subjected \nto the March 31, 2011 public group strip search at Lincoln\nCorrectional Center.  \n. . . \n2\n\nSubclass A, consisting of: All individuals who were \nsubjected to the March 31, 2011 public group strip search\nat Lincoln Correctional Center, and who remain in the\ncustody of the Illinois Department of Corrections since\nthat time.  \nSubclass B, consisting of: All individuals who were \nsubjected to the March 31, 2011 public group strip search\nat  Lincoln  Correctional  Center,  and  who  were\nsubsequently released from the custody of the Illinois\nDepartment of Corrections.  \n. . . \nClass II (Injunctive Relief Class): All women who are currently\nincarcerated at Lincoln Correctional Center, and all women who\nwill  be  incarcerated  at  Lincoln  Correctional  Center  in  the\nfuture.  \nIn its Order of July 29, 2013, as to Class I, the Court found that the\nnumerosity requirement under Rule 23(a)(1) had been met, as there were\nover 100 women who were subjected to the strip search on March 31,\n2011.  The Court further determined under Rule 23(a)(2) that because the\nPlaintiffs sufficiently alleged that class members have suffered the same core\ninjury, the case presented common questions fact and law.  Upon reviewing\nthe declarations, the Court concluded pursuant to Rule 23(a)(3) that the\nexperiences of the named parties were fairly typical of the proposed class. \n3\n\nFinally, in considering adequacy-of-representation, the Court noted under\nRule 23(a)(4) that it was satisfied with the competency of class counsel,\nand has no reason to doubt that “the representative parties will fairly and\nadequately protect the interests of the class.”  \nBased on all of the unique circumstances of the case, the Court found\n“that  the  questions  of  law  [and]  fact  common  to  class  members\npredominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and\nthat a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and\nefficiently adjudicating the controversy.”  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).     \nThe Court declined to certify Class II, which consisted of women\nthen-incarcerated at Lincoln Correctional Center and women who will be\nincarcerated at that facility in the future.  Because women were no longer\nincarcerated at Lincoln Correctional Center and there were no future plans\nto house women at the facility, the Court determined that the proposed\nclass was a class of zero and the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a)(1)\ncould not be satisfied.  \nII.\n4\n\nAccording to the Plaintiffs’ current motion, the women who had been\nincarcerated at Lincoln Correctional Center were transferred out of the\nfacility, primarily to Logan Correctional Center, after Lincoln Correctional\nCenter was converted to an all-male prison.  \nThe Plaintiff now seeks to certify the following class pursuant to Rule\n23(b)(2): \nClass II (Injunctive Relief Class): All women who are currently \nincarcerated at Logan Correctional Center, and all women who\nwill be incarcerated at Logan Correctional Center in the future. \nUnder Rule 23(b)(2), a class action may be maintained where “the party\nopposing  the class has  acted or refused to act on grounds  that apply\ngenerally  to  the  class,  so  that  final  injunctive  relief  or  corresponding\ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 23(b)(2).       \nThe Plaintiffs contend that all of the requirements of Rule 23(a) have\nbeen met.  Rule 23(a)(1) (the “numerosity prong”) requires that the class\nbe so numerous that it would be impracticable to join all of the members\nin  a  single  action.    The  named  Plaintiffs  have  attached  to  their\n5\n\nmemorandum declarations from 43 other inmates who “endured the cadet\ntraining exercise.”  Moreover, Logan Correctional Center’s own records\nshow that approximately 230 women were subjected to the October 31,\n2013 public group strip search and its inmate population is approximately\n2,000 women.  Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Class II\nsatisfies the Rule 23(a)(1) numerosity requirement.  \nThe Plaintiffs further allege that Class II satisfies the commonality\nand typicality requirements.  Under Rule 23(a)(2), there must be questions\nof law or fact common to the class.  All that is required under Rule 23(a)(2)\nis a single common question among the class members.  See Wal-Mart\nStores,  Inc.  v.  Dukes,  131  S.  Ct.  2541,  2556  (2011).    However,\n“[c]ommonality demands more than a showing that the class members have\nall suffered a violation of the same provision of law at the hands of the\nsame defendant.”  Suchanek v. Sturm Foods, Inc., 764 F.3d 750, 755 (7th\nCir. 2014).  “Where the same conduct or practice by the same defendant\ngives rise to the same kind of claims from all class members, there is a\ncommon question.”  Id. at 756.  \n6\n\nThe Plaintiffs assert the claims here are almost identical and thus\ncompletely common among the class members.  Each of the putative class\nmembers was strip searched during a “cadet training exercise,” in the same\nmanner and under the same circumstances.  Each individual will rely on the\nsame core unlawful conduct: being forcibly strip searched in groups of two\nor more in full view of male corrections officers, IDOC administrators and\ncadets, as well as corrections officer, cadets and civilians not involved in the\nstrip search.  The Plaintiffs allege the core conduct is common to both the\nMarch 31, 2011 Lincoln Correctional Center “cadet training exercise” and\nthe October 31, 2013 Logan Correctional Center “cadet training exercise.” \nBased on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have met the\ncommonality requirement.  Each putative class members’ claims derive from\nthe same conduct or practice by the same Defendants.  There is a common\ncore experience that was shared by all, which took place on different dates\nat  two  different  correctional  centers.    Accordingly,  the  Plaintiffs  have\ndemonstrated commonality among the class members.  \nUnder  Rule  23(a)(3),  the  Plaintiff  must  demonstrate  that  the\n7\n\nexperiences of the named parties are fairly typical of the proposed class.  To\nsatisfy  the  typicality  requirement,  “there  must  be  enough  congruence\nbetween  the  named  representative’s  claim  and  that  of  the  unnamed\nmembers of the class to justify allowing the named party to litigate on\nbehalf of the group.”  Spano v. The Boeing Co., 633 F.3d 574, 586 (7th\nCir.  2011).  A finding of  commonality  usually results in  a finding of\ntypicality.  See Gen Tel. Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 158\nn.13 (1982) (“The commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a)\ntend  to  merge.”).    Upon  reviewing  the  declarations  attached  to  the\nPlaintiffs’  memorandum,  the  Court  concludes  the  Plaintiffs  have\nsufficiently alleged that Named Class Members Ieshia Brown and Sandra\nBrown were subjected to the same course of conduct as other class members\nduring the cadet training exercises.  Accordingly, those individuals bring the\nsame cause of action as the other class members.  \nBased on the foregoing, the Court concludes that pursuant to Rule\n23(a)(3), the experiences of the named parties are fairly typical of the\nproposed class.                  \n8\n\nUnder Rule 23(a)(4), the class representatives and their counsel must\n“fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(a)(4).  “[A]dequacy of representation is composed of two parts: the\nadequacy  of  the  named  plaintiff’s  counsel,  and  the  adequacy  of\nrepresentation provided in protecting the different, separate, and distinct\ninterest of the class members.”  Retired Chicago Police Ass’n v. City of\nChicago, 7 F.3d 584, 598 (7th Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted).  The class representative must possess the same interest\nand  suffer  the  same  injury  as  other  class  members.    See  Uhl  v.\nThoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc., 309 F.3d 978,\n985 (7th Cir. 2002).  Accordingly, the Court must determine there is no\ninconsistency between the named parties and the class members.  See id.  \nBased on the information in the record, the Court finds that the class\nrepresentatives have the same interest and suffered the same injury as other\nclass members.  The Court is aware of no inconsistencies between the\nnamed parties and class members.  \nIn  its  July  29,  2013  Order,  the  Court  approved  class  counsel’s\n9\n\nrepresentation of the Plaintiffs.  According to the memorandum in support\nof the current motion, the Plaintiffs’ Counsel has represented the Plaintiffs\nin multiple class action suits, including suits involving strip searches.  The\nCourt has no basis for finding that any of the class representatives are\nantagonistic  to  any  absent  class  member  or  that  they  do  not  have  a\nsufficient interest to vigorously pursue the claims.  \nAs was the case before, the Court is satisfied with the competency of\nclass counsel.  Pursuant to Rule 23(a)(4), the Court has no basis to doubt\nthat  “the  representative  parties  will  fairly  and  adequately  protect  the\ninterests of the class.”  \nIII.\nIf the requirements of Rule 23(a) are satisfied, a class action may be\nmaintained if “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on\ngrounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or\ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a\nwhole.”  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  \nCiting Amchem Prods v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591 (1997), the Plaintiffs\n10\n\nnote that actions seeking relief to prevent future alleged illegal deprivations\nof civil rights are a “prime example” of a proper Rule 23(b)(2) class.  See id.\nat  614.    “The  key  to  the  (b)(2)  class  is  the  indivisible  nature  of  the\ninjunctive or declaratory relief warranted–the notion that the conduct is\nsuch that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class\nmembers or as to none of them.”  Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557 (internal\nquotation marks anc citation omitted).  The relief sought “must perforce\naffect the entire class at once.”  Id. at 2558.  The Seventh Circuit has\nobserved that “Rule 23(b)(2) operates under the presumption that the\ninterests of the class members are cohesive and homogeneous such that the\ncase will not depend on adjudication of facts particular to any subset of the\nclass  nor  require  a  remedy  that  differentiates  materially  among  class\nmembers.”  Lemon v. Int’l Union of Operating Engineers, 216 F.3d 577,\n580 (7th Cir. 2000).  \nThe Plaintiffs note that Class II, comprised of all women incarcerated\nat Logan Correctional Center, seeks certification under Rule 23(b)(2) in\norder to ensure that Defendants are prevented from organizing any mass\n11\n\npublic group strip searches in the future, either as part of IDOC “training\nexercises” or in the facility at large.  Each class member’s claim depends on\nthe Defendants’ standardized conduct.  Class certification is appropriate\nunder Rule 23(b)(2) “only when a single injunction or declaratory judgment\nwould provide relief to each member of the class.”  Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct.\nat 2557.  Because each class member is seeking the same injunction, the\nCourt concludes the Plaintiffs have met the standard for maintaining a class\naction for equitable relief.  \nIV.\nFor the reasons stated herein, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs’\nmotion satisfies the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) and the requirements of\nRule 23(b)(2).  Accordingly, the motion to certify the class will be Allowed. \nClass II, the Injunctive Relief Class, is certified as follows: “All women\nwho are currently incarcerated at Logan Correctional Center, and all women\nwho will be incarcerated at Logan Correctional Center in the future.”  \nThe Named Plaintiffs–Beverly Thogmorton, Delores Henry, Patricia\nPhillips, Jacqueline Hegwood, Sandra Brown and Ieshia Brown–shall be\n12\n\nrepresentatives of the Class.  \nLoevy & Loevy are appointed as Counsel for the Class.   \nErgo, the Plaintiffs’ Rule 23(b)(2) Motion for Class Certification [d/e\n80] is ALLOWED.  \nClass II is hereby certified under Rule 23(b)(2), as provided in this\nOrder.  \nThe Named Plaintiffs are appointed as representatives of Class II. \nCounsel for the Named Plaintiffs, Loevy & Loevy, are appointed as \nCounsel for Class II.\nThis case is referred to United States Magistrate Judge Tom Schanzle-\nHaskins for the purpose of determining whether additional discovery is\nnecessary and entering a scheduling order.    \nENTER: October 17, 2014\nFOR THE COURT:\n           s/Richard Mills                  \nRichard Mills\nUnited States District Judge \n    \n13",

The plaintiffs also seek to put a stop to the \npractice.  \n  Before the Court are several motions filed by Defendants:  \nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment; Defendants’ motion to \nstrike Plaintiffs’ response thereto; and, Defendants’ motion to strike \nthe report and testimony of Plaintiffs’ expert.   \n \nPage 1 of 19 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 122    Page 2 of 19                                             \n      \nI.  Defendants’ Motion to Strike Plaintiffs’ Summary \nJudgment Response \n \nDefendants’ move to strike Plaintiffs’ response on the grounds \nthat Plaintiffs’ additional proposed facts are too numerous and \nmany of Plaintiffs’ proposed facts are disputed or immaterial to the \nlimited nature of Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.  \nDefendants ask the Court to strike the entire response or strike \ncertain paragraphs and give Defendants additional time to file a \nreply. \nThe Court has reviewed Plaintiffs’ response to the summary \njudgment motion and does not find the response improper.  That \nsome of Plaintiffs’ proposed facts are disputed and immaterial to \ndeciding Defendants’ summary judgment motion is not grounds for \nstriking the response and does not preclude a reply. \nAn extension to file a reply is also not warranted. Defendants \ndo not adequately explain why they did not file a timely reply, \nparticularly given the limited nature of their summary judgment \nmotion.  Further, granting an extension would only unnecessarily \ndelay the trial.  It is clear from the record that disputed questions of \nfact exist for trial.  \nPage 2 of 19 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 122    Page 3 of 19                                             \n      \nII.

Summary judgment will be \ngranted to these Defendants. \n  This appears to leave the following 17 Defendants sued for \ndamages in their individual capacities:  Hulett, Reynolds, Dawdy,2 \nCraig, Edmonson, Johnson, 3 Leonetti, Pfeiffer, Slater, Krull, Dallas, \nAnderson, Crudup,4 Butler, Spaniol, Hatfield, and Pasley.  (Pls.’ \nResp. d/e 113, footnote 1 and p. 51.)  Defendants Yurkovich, Zavala \nand Locke were sued in their official capacities only for purposes of \ninjunctive relief.  (Sixth Amended Complaint, d/e 83.)  According to \nDefendants, Yurkovich and Locke are now replaced by Christine \n                                                            \n1 Plaintiffs say only “Warden” in their footnote, but they appear to mean the current Warden of Lincoln \nCorrectional Center.  The current  Warden of Lincoln Correctional Center was not involved in the strip search and is \nnot an appropriate party for injunctive relief because the female inmates are now housed in Logan Correctional \nCenter, not Lincoln Correctional Center.   \n2 This Defendant’s name is spelled “Dowdy” in the sixth amended complaint, but from Defendants’ Answer the \ncorrect spelling appears to be “Dawdy.”   \n3 Two “Johnsons” are listed in the Sixth Amended Complaint.  Whether there are two separate Johnson \nDefendants is not clear. \n4 This Defendant’s name is spelled “Krudup” in the sixth amended complaint, but from Defendants’ Answer the \ncorrect spelling appears to be “Crudup.”     \nPage 3 of 19 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 122    Page 4 of 19                                             \n      \nBrannon (the current warden of Logan) and Michael Atchison (the \ncurrent IDOC Deputy Chief of Operations) pursuant to Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 25(d). \n  Moving to the merits of Defendants’ summary judgment \nmotion, the following facts are recounted in the light most favorable \nto Plaintiffs.  On March 31, 2011, female inmates in two housing \nunits in Lincoln Correctional Center were strip-searched as part of \na cadet training exercise.  According to  Plaintiffs, they were \nrequired to stand naked, nearly shoulder to shoulder with 8-10 \nother inmates in a room where they could be seen by others not \nconducting the searches, including male officers.  Menstruating \ninmates had to remove their tampons and sanitary pads in front of \nothers, were not given replacements, and many got blood on their \nbodies and clothing and blood on the floor.  The naked inmates had \nto stand barefoot on a floor dirty with menstrual blood and raise \ntheir breasts, lift their hair, turn around, bend over, spread their \nbuttocks and vaginas, and cough.  (Defs.’ Proposed Undisp. Facts \n56-62, 73, 74, d/e 113.)   \n  Defendants wisely do not dispute that Plaintiffs’ descriptions \nsupport an Eighth Amendment claim if true.  A strip search \nPage 4 of 19 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 122    Page 5 of 19                                             \n      \nconducted in an unnecessarily humiliating manner for no legitimate \nreason can “‘involve the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain’ \nin violation of the Eighth Amendment.”  King v. McCarty, 781 F.3d \n889, 896 (7th Cir. 2015); Mays v. Springborn, 575 F.3d 643, 649 (7th \nCir. 2009)(The Eighth Amendment prohibits strip searches \nconducted “in a harassing manner intended to humiliate and cause \npsychological pain.”); Calhoun v. DeTella, 319 F.3d 936, 939 (7th \nCir. 2003)(“the Eighth Amendment prohibits unnecessary and \nwanton infliction of pain, thus forbidding punishment that is ‘so \ntotally without penological justification that it results in the \ngratuitous infliction of suffering.’”)(quoted cite omitted).   \n      The individual capacity Defendants argue instead that the \nevidence does not support a finding that they were personally \nresponsible for the manner in which the strip search was \nconducted.  A government employee must be personally responsible \nfor the alleged constitutional violation in order to be liable under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983.  Kuhn v. Goodlow, 678 F.3d 552, 556 (7th Cir. \n2012)( \"'An individual cannot be held liable in a § 1983 action \nunless he caused or participated in an alleged constitutional \ndeprivation.'\")(quoted cite omitted); Chavez v. Illinois State Police, \nPage 5 of 19 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 122    Page 6 of 19                                             \n      \n251 F.3d 612, 651 (7th Cir. 2001)(no respondeat superior liability \nunder § 1983).  \n  However, Defendants’ proposed undisputed facts do not \npreclude a finding of personal responsibility against any \nDefendants, even with no response from Plaintiffs.  Only a few of \nDefendants’ proposed facts address personal involvement, and even \nthose few facts address only a few of the Defendants.  According to \nDefendants’ proposed facts relevant to personal responsibility, the \nWarden decided which units to search; Defendants Pasley and \nHatfield accompanied the cadets; Defendant Pasley was not aware \nof complaints about the search; Defendant Pasley remained in the \nliving units during the shakedowns; and Defendant Reynolds “was \nin and out of the housing units.”  (Defs.’ proposed undisputed facts \n9, 10, 20, 32.)  None of these proposed facts demonstrates the \nabsence of a material dispute over each Defendants’ knowledge, \nauthority, and participation in the incident. \n  Further, Defendants’ personal responsibility argument avoids \nconfronting evidence in Plaintiffs’ favor.  Goka v. Bobbitt, 862 F.2d \n646, 650 (7th Cir. 1988)(Defendants bear the burden of \ndemonstrating that no material factual disputes exist by pointing \nPage 6 of 19 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 122    Page 7 of 19                                             \n      \nout evidence favorable to them as well as addressing known \nevidence contrary to their position.)  Defendants Hulett (the \nWarden) and Reynolds (the Assistant Warden of Operations) \narguably knew of and approved of, facilitated, or turned a blind eye \nto the manner in which the strip search was conducted.  Matthews \nv. City of E. St. Louis, 675 F.3d 703, 708 (7th Cir.2012)(a supervisor \nis personally responsible for constitutional violations if the \nsupervisor knew of the violation and facilitated, approved, \ncondoned, or turned a blind eye).  Looking at the evidence in the \nlight most favorable to Plaintiffs, Defendant Hulett ordered and was \nultimately in charge of the shakedown.  (Hulett Dep. p. 76, 78.)  \nDefendant Reynolds also instructed and oversaw the cadets and, if \nPlaintiffs are believed, called the prisoners “bitches.”  (Reynolds’ \nDep. pp. 85-86; Ieshia Brown Aff. para. 8.)  Both Hulett and \nReynolds were arguably in a position to intervene and turned a \nblind eye to how the searches were carried out.   \n  Defendants Pasley and Hatfield, the training instructors, were \ninvolved in the training and oversight of the cadets, according to \nPlaintiffs.  Pasley knew that strip searches were occurring and his \npresence on the housing units allows an inference that he heard the \nPage 7 of 19 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 122    Page 8 of 19                                             \n      \nderogatory comments and threats made to Plaintiffs by the officers \non those units.  (Hulett Dep. p.77, 79; Pasley Dep. pp. 6, 7.)  \nHatfield was present in the gym and observed at least some of the \nstrip searches.  (Hatfield Dep. pp. 15-19.)  The rest of the individual \nDefendants, according to Plaintiffs, were directly involved in the \nunconstitutional aspects of the searches or were present and failed \nto intervene.  For example, Defendants Dawdy, Johnson, Leonetti, \nEdmonson, Craig, Slater, Pfieiffer, and Krull were part of the \ntactical team.  (Thogmorton Aff. paras. 3, 20; Iesha Brown Aff. para. \n2).  Defendant Crudup was present during the strip searches and \nmade rude comments.  (Crudup Aff. para. 18.)  Defendants Dallas, \nAnderson, and Butler also played a part in the training exercise.  \n(Reynolds Dep. pp. 42-43; Pfieffer’s Resp. to Pls.’ first interrogatory \n2; Pfieffer’s Resp. to Pls.’ first interrogatory 2).   \n  In short, the extent of these Defendants’ knowledge and \nparticipation in the strip search are disputed questions of fact on \nthis record.  Defendants’ personal responsibility argument may \nultimately prevail at trial, but that is for the jury to decide.  \n  Defendants next argue that Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment \nclaim is not legally viable under Seventh Circuit case precedent. \nPage 8 of 19 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 122    Page 9 of 19                                             \n      \n   The Supreme Court in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979) \nheld that visual cavity searches of pretrial detainees after contact \nvisits did not violate the Fourth Amendment, “assuming for present \npurposes that inmate, both convicted prisoners and pretrial \ndetainees, retain some Fourth Amendment rights upon commitment \nto a corrections facility . . . .”  441 U.S. at 558.   Bell, however, \ninvolved pretrial detainees, not convicted prisoners.   \n  After Bell, the Seventh Circuit recognized in some cases a \nconvicted inmate’s limited constitutional privacy right in his or her \nbody. In Forbes v. Trigg, 976 F.2d 308 (7th Cir. 1992), the Seventh \nCircuit upheld a habeas challenge to an inmate’s discipline for \nrefusing to provide urine sample but acknowledged that “[u]rine \ntests are searches for Fourth Amendment purposes, and prison \ninmates retain protect privacy rights in their bodies, although these \nrights do not extend to their surroundings.”  976 F.2d at 312-13.  \nIn Canedy v. Boardman, 16 F.3d 183 (7th Cir. 1993), the Seventh \nCircuit reversed the dismissal at the notice pleading stage of a claim \nby a male prisoner that female guards strip searched him and \nregularly observed his naked body.  The Canedy Court \nacknowledged a convicted inmate’s constitutional right to privacy in \nPage 9 of 19 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 122    Page 10 of 19                                            \n       \nhis or her body, a right to be balanced against legitimate prison \ninterests.  16 F.3d at 185, 188 (characterizing the adoption of \nreasonable measures to protect an inmate’s bodily privacy as a \n“constitutional mandate.”)   \n  Two years after Canedy, in Johnson v. Phelan, 69 F.3d 144, \n146 (7th Cir. 1995), the Seventh Circuit upheld the dismissal at the \nnotice pleading stage of a pretrial detainee male prisoner’s claim \nchallenging cross-sex monitoring.  The Court in Johnson stated that \n“[w]e think it best to understand the references to ‘privacy’ in \nCanedy and similar cases as invocations of the eighth amendment’s \nban on cruel and unusual punishments.”  69 F.3d at 147.  The \nmajority opinion based its conclusion in part on Hudson v. Palmer, \n468 U.S. 517 (1984), a Supreme Court case which held that \nprisoners have no Fourth Amendment right of privacy in their cells.  \n468 U.S. at 536.  Judge Posner dissented in part in Johnson, \napparently agreeing that the claim fell under the Eighth \nAmendment but arguing that dismissal was premature and that \nliability could exist under the deliberate indifference standard of the \nEighth Amendment.  69 F.3d at 155-56 (“If prison officials know \nthat they are subjecting male prisoners to gratuitous humiliation, \nPage 10 of 19 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 122    Page 11 of 19                                            \n       \nthe infliction is deliberate, even if the officials are not actuated by \nany punitive purpose . . . .”)(Judge Poser, concurring and \ndissenting).      \n  A few years after Johnson, in Peckham v. Wisconsin Dept. of \nCorrections, 141 F.3d 694 (7th Cir. 1998), the Seventh Circuit \nupheld strip searches of a female inmate under the Eighth \nAmendment, and, arguably, also under the Fourth Amendment.  \nThe majority in Peckham wrote: \nSo, does a prison inmate enjoy any protection at all \nunder the Fourth Amendment . . .?  Although we \nacknowledge the tension between Johnson and Canedy, \nwe think the answer is “yes,” but we hasten to add that \ngiven the considerable deference prison officials enjoy to \nrun their institutions it is difficult to conjure up too \nmany real-life scenarios where prison strip searches of \ninmates could be said to be unreasonable under the \nFourth Amendment.   \n \n141 F.3d at 697.  The Court also stated that “regardless of \nhow one views the Fourth Amendment in this context, it is the \nEighth Amendment that is more properly posed to protect \ninmates from unconstitutional strip searches, notably when \ntheir aim is punishment, not legitimate institutional \nconcerns.”  141 F.3d at 697.  Judge Easterbrook concurred \nseparately, characterizing the above indented quote as dicta \nPage 11 of 19 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 122    Page 12 of 19                                            \n       \nand arguing that Johnson required strip searches of convicted \ninmates to be analyzed under Eighth Amendment, not the \nFourth Amendment.  Id at 698-99.    Later in an unpublished \nopinion in a different case, the Court characterized Peckham \nas holding that “prisoner strip-search claims are better \naddressed under the Eighth Amendment.”  Payette v. \nHoenisch, 284 Fed.Appx. 348 * 5 (7th Cir. 2008)(not reported in \nFed. Rptr).  \n  Defendants do not address the Seventh Circuit’s most recent \ndiscussion of privacy rights of convicted prisoners in their bodies:  \nKing v. McCarty, 781 F.3d 889 (7th Cir. 2015).  Plaintiffs address the \ncase in a notice of supplemental authority filed on March 30, 2016. \n  In King, a per curiam decision, the Seventh Circuit held that \nthe Eighth Amendment, not the Fourth Amendment, applied to a \nconvicted prisoner’s claim that he had to wear a “see-through \njumpsuit that exposed his genitals and buttocks while he was \ntransported from a county jail to a state prison.” 781 F.3d at 892.  \nThe King Court reasoned: \nThe Supreme Court has adhered to the importance of the \nsubjective element of Eighth Amendment claims by \nconvicted prisoners like King, and the Court has never \nPage 12 of 19 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 122    Page 13 of 19                                            \n       \nextended Fourth Amendment protection to a prisoner's \nclaim like King's.  In light of those facts, we do not believe \nwe should expand the scope of Fourth Amendment \nprotection to strip-searches of convicted prisoners to \ncreate an Eighth–Amendment–light standard in which \nthe subjective purposes of prison officials would not be \nrelevant. We conclude that King has failed to state a \nclaim upon which relief may be granted under the Fourth \nAmendment. \n \n781 F.3d at 900-901.  The Court acknowledged that “case law \nindicates that the Fourth Amendment protects, to some \ndegree, prisoners’ bodily integrity against unreasonable \nintrusions into their bodies[,]” but pointed out that the plaintiff \nin King had alleged “only a prolonged form of visual search in \nwhich he was not touched.”  781 F.3d at 900 (emphasis in \noriginal).  The Court in King  characterized the statements in \nPeckham as dicta and seemed to confirm Johnson’s \ninterpretation that Canedy’s statements about privacy invoked \nthe Eighth Amendment, not the Fourth Amendment.   \n  Judge Hamilton wrote separately in King to urge that the \nFourth Amendment claim proceed for further development.  \nJudge Hamilton noted the tension between cases in the \nSeventh Circuit like Johnson, Canedy, and Forbes, a tension \nalso recognized in the majority opinion in King.  781 F.3d at \nPage 13 of 19 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 122    Page 14 of 19                                            \n       \n900-904.  Judge Hamilton argued that, “we should recognize \nthat the Fourth Amendment's focus on objective \nreasonableness may preserve some outer limit on the actions \nof even well-meaning prison administrators where such bodily \nsearches are involved, while it also requires courts to give \nsubstantial—but not complete—deference to the warden's \njudgment.”  781 F.3d at 904.  Judge Hamilton wrote that “a \nsingle panel obviously cannot resolve this tension in our \ncircuit’s case law.”  781 F.3d at 903.  Petition for rehearing en \nbanc was denied, with Judge Hamilton concurring but noting \nthat the tension about the Fourth Amendment’s application to \nconvicted prisoners would need to be addressed at some point.  \nKing v. McCarty, Appeal No. 13-1769 (7th Cir., 6/1/15 order \ndenying rehearing en banc).  The case settled on remand.  \nKing v. McCarty, 11-CV-1126 (C.D. Ill.)   \n  Plaintiffs argue that King is distinguishable because in \nthis case Plaintiffs had to remove tampons, bend over, and \nsubject their anal and vaginal cavities to inspection.  However, \nPlaintiffs do not appear to allege that officers touched Plaintiffs \nbodies during the search.  The search was limited to visual \nPage 14 of 19 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 122    Page 15 of 19                                            \n       \ninspection of the naked body as the Court understands the \nclaim, just like in King and Johnson.  Plaintiffs point to no \ncontrolling case in the Seventh Circuit in which a strip search \nclaim by a convicted prisoner—strip search meaning a visual \ninspection of the naked body, including the anus and/or \nvaginal cavities—actually proceeded to disposition under the \nFourth Amendment rather than the Eighth Amendment.   \nIn the Court’s opinion, a change in the law would be needed \nfor Plaintiffs to pursue a Fourth Amendment claim.  This \nmight be the case to push for a change, but that is a decision \nfor the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, not this Court.  The \nFourth Amendment claim will be dismissed.5  \n  Defendants next argue that no injunctive relief is \nwarranted because IDOC policy specifically prohibits how the \nsearch was allegedly conducted here, except for allowing group \nstrip searches in general under certain circumstances.  \nHowever, the IDOC allowance of mass group strip searches is \none of the main focuses of Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive \n                                                            \n5 Concepts of “reasonableness” may still be relevant to the subjective and objective inquiries under the Eighth \nAmendment.  An unreasonable response to a known, substantial risk of serious harm or an objectively serious \ncondition of confinement would support liability under the Eighth Amendment. \nPage 15 of 19 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 122    Page 16 of 19                                            \n       \nrelief.  (Pls.’ Sixth Amended Complaint, Count III; Pls.’ Resp. p. \n113.)  Further, Plaintiffs assert that the IDOC written policies \ndiffer from the actual practice which the policymakers \nknowingly allow to occur. At this point, the Court cannot \nconclude that no possibility of injunctive relief exists.6   \n \nIII.  Defendants’ Motion to Strike the Report and Testimony of \nPlaintiffs’ Expert \n \n  Plaintiffs proffer Wendy Still as an expert, whom Defendants \nappear to agree is qualified “to testify about general correctional \nstandards with respect to strip searches.”  (Defs. Mot. Strike Pls.’ \nExpert, p. 5.)  The problem is Ms. Still’s expert report, which \nDefendants argue, and the Court agrees, contains many \nconclusions that belong to the jury.  (Still Expert Report, d/e 110-\n24.)   \n  Ms. Still’s report reads like a closing argument.  She accepts \nall of Plaintiffs’ contentions as true and concludes that the March \n2011 strip search was abusive, without legitimate purpose, and \ncaused severe pain and suffering.  A long section recounts the   \nDefendants’ subjective intent, what actually happened during the \n                                                            \n6 Another case is pending about an allegedly similar group strip search of female inmates at Logan Correctional \nCenter on October 31, 2013.  Brown v. Locke, 15‐CV‐1447 (C.D. Ill.) \nPage 16 of 19 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 122    Page 17 of 19                                            \n       \nstrip search, and what kind of harm Plaintiffs suffered.  Her general \nknowledge of correctional standards is admissible, but not her \nopinions on what the jury must ultimately decide.  Ms. Still’s report \nwill not be admitted, and she will be limited to testifying about \ncorrectional standards regarding strip searches.  Admissible \ntestimony would include issues that are relevant to Plaintiffs’ claims \nsuch as generally accepted correctional standards for the planning, \noverseeing, and conducting of strip searches, but would not include \nthe resolution of disputed questions of fact.  Plaintiffs appear to \nagree.  (Pls. Resp., d/e 118, pp. 1, 9-13)  If the parties seek further \nguidance, they may make an offer of proof regarding Ms. Still’s \ntestimony outside of the jury.   \n \nIV.  Conclusion \n  Material disputes of fact remain for the jury on Plaintiffs’ \nEighth Amendment claim, but Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment claim \nis not viable under King and Johnson.  The possibility of injunctive \nrelief cannot be ruled out at this time.  Plaintiffs’ expert may testify, \nbut only as to correctional standards regarding strip searches, not \nto disputed questions of fact.   \nPage 17 of 19 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 122    Page 18 of 19                                            \n       \nErgo,  \nDefendants’ Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s Response is DENIED \n(114). \nDefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED IN \nPART AND DENIED IN PART (102).

In other words, “reasonableness” is a bad standard \nconstitutional  provision  other  than  the  Eighth  for  assessing  prison  management.  That  rules  out  the \nAmendment.

Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 127 S.Ct. 1091, \n  166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007), does not suggest that the Fourth Amendment falls away when an arrestee appears before a \nmagistrate.

LEE, District Judge.* \nEASTERBROOK, Circuit Judge. Members of a certiﬁed class \ncontend that during 2011 female inmates at an Illinois prison \nwere strip-searched as part of a training exercise for cadet \n                                                 \n* Of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation. \n\nCase: 16-4234      Document: 38            Filed: 07/16/2019      Pages: 15\n2  No. 16-4234 \nguards. The district court summarized the allegations this \nway: \n[Plaintiﬀs] were required to stand  naked, nearly shoulder to \nshoulder with 8-10 other inmates in a room where they could be \nseen by others not conducting the searches, including male oﬃc-\ners. Menstruating inmates had to remove their tampons and san-\nitary pads in front of others, were not given replacements, and \nmany got blood on their bodies and clothing and blood on the \nﬂoor. The naked inmates had to stand barefoot on a ﬂoor dirty \nwith menstrual blood and raise their breasts, lift their hair, turn \naround, bend over, spread their buttocks and vaginas, and cough. \n2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194393 at *6 (C.D. Ill. Apr. 14, 2016). \nPlaintiﬀs maintained that such an inspection—unnecessary \nfor security and conducted in an oﬀensive manner—violated \ntheir  rights  under  both  the  Fourth  Amendment  and  the \nEighth Amendment, applied to the states by the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. §1983. \nThe district court awarded summary judgment to defend-\nants on the Fourth Amendment theory, because Johnson v. \nPhelan, 69 F.3d 144 (7th Cir. 1995), and King v. McCarty, 781 \nF.3d 889 (7th Cir. 2015), hold that a visual inspection of a con-\nvicted prisoner is not subject to analysis under that amend-\nment, though a claim properly lies under the Eighth Amend-\nment if an unnecessary or demeaning inspection amounts to \npunishment. The Eighth Amendment claim went to trial, and \na jury returned a verdict for the defendants. Plaintiﬀs do not \ncontest the verdict but ask us to reinstate their Fourth Amend-\nment theory. Because analysis under the Fourth Amendment \nis objective, see Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989), while a \nsuccessful claim under the Eighth Amendment depends on \nproof of a culpable mental state, see Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. \n\nCase: 16-4234      Document: 38            Filed: 07/16/2019      Pages: 15\nNo. 16-4234  3 \n312 (1986), plaintiﬀs believe that they could succeed on a \nFourth Amendment theory despite the jury’s verdict. \nThe Fourth Amendment applies only to the extent that \nprisoners retain a legitimate expectation of privacy. Johnson \nand King rely on Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 524–30 (1984), \nwhich holds that prisoners lack privacy interests in their cells \nand implies that they lack any legitimate expectation of pri-\nvacy inside prison walls. The judgments of conviction allow \nwardens to control and monitor their charges’ lives, extin-\nguishing the rights of secrecy and seclusion that free people \npossess. But Hudson did not consider whether convicted pris-\noners have some residual privacy interest in their persons, as \nopposed to their possessions and surroundings. The Justices \nhave not returned to that subject in later decisions. Decisions \nin this circuit look in both directions on that topic. Compare \nKing with, e.g., Peckham v. Wisconsin Department of Corrections, \n141 F.3d 694 (7th Cir. 1998). \nKing reconciles the circuit’s competing strands of thought \nthis way: the Fourth Amendment does not apply to visual in-\nspections of convicted prisoners but does apply to procedures \nthat entail intrusions within prisoners’ bodies. 781 F.3d at \n899–901. That approach is justiﬁed not only by the holding of \nHudson but also by the need to maintain the subjective com-\nponent of Eighth Amendment analysis. In decisions such as \nWhitley the Justices stressed that guards will take many steps \nthat oﬀend and even injure prisoners, yet contribute to prison \nmanagement and security. Only those steps that are unneces-\nsary and intended to produce injury, the Court explained, \nshould be actionable. \nAn appropriate balance of prisoners’ interests against the \nneeds of prison management is achieved  through normal \n\nCase: 16-4234      Document: 38            Filed: 07/16/2019      Pages: 15\n4  No. 16-4234 \nEighth Amendment analysis, which has both objective and \nsubjective elements. See also, e.g., Helling v. McKinney, 509 \nU.S. 25 (1993); Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825 (1994). Apply-\ning the Fourth Amendment to all unwelcome observations of \nprisoners would eliminate the subjective component and cre-\nate a sort of Eighth Amendment lite, defeating the objectives \nthat the Justices sought to achieve by limiting liability in Whit-\nley and similar decisions. See King, 781 F.3d at 900–01. \nEven when the Fourth Amendment or the Due Process \nClause applies, as one or the other will before conviction, strip \nsearches often are reasonable and thus permissible. See Flor-\nence v. Board of Freeholders, 566 U.S. 318 (2012); Bell v. Wolﬁsh, \n441 U.S. 520, 558–60 (1979). But the absence of a subjective \ncomponent  in  determining  what  is  reasonable  under  the \nFourth Amendment would produce outcomes that depart \nfrom the approach required by Whitley for prisoners after con-\nviction. It would eﬀectively equate the rights of convicted \nprisoners with those of arrestees or pretrial detainees. Many \ndecisions hold that convicts’ rights are more limited. \nKing obliged the district judge to resolve this case as he \ndid. Plaintiﬀs allege a visual inspection, not a physical intru-\nsion. They maintain that each inmate had to manipulate her \nown body but do not contend that the prison’s staﬀ touched \nany inmate. A prisoner’s need to touch her own body does not \ndiﬀerentiate this situation from that of Florence, which con-\ncluded that a visual inspection (visual on the guards’ part) is \nreasonable even with respect to pretrial detainees. \nPlaintiﬀs ask us to overrule Johnson and King to the extent \nthat they deem the Fourth Amendment inapplicable to visual \ninspections of convicted prisoners. We decline. \n\nCase: 16-4234      Document: 38            Filed: 07/16/2019      Pages: 15\nNo. 16-4234  5 \nThe law in some other circuits is favorable to plaintiﬀs. See, \ne.g., Harris v. Miller, 818 F.3d 49, 57 (2d Cir. 2016); Hutchins v. \nMcDaniels, 512 F.3d 193, 196 (5th Cir. 2007). The law in this \ncircuit does not favor plaintiﬀs, however, and decisions such \nas Hudson are at best neutral. If the ﬂat declaration in Hudson \nthat a prisoner lacks any legitimate expectation of privacy in \na cell, 468 U.S. at 526, applies only while the prisoner is in a \ncell,  that  still  falls  short  of  establishing  that  the  Fourth \nAmendment applies elsewhere in a prison. And we know \nfrom Samson v. California, 547 U.S. 843 (2006), that even after \nconditional release a convicted person has a severely dimin-\nished expectation of privacy until the end of the sentence. \nSamson allowed a parolee to be searched without either prob-\nable cause or suspicion, and it stressed the extent to which a \nconviction curtails privacy. \nThe most one can say for plaintiﬀs is that judges, including \nthose  within  the  Seventh  Circuit,  have  disagreed  about \nwhether the Fourth Amendment ever prevents guards from \nviewing naked prisoners. Johnson was decided over a dissent. \nA concurring opinion in King expressed doubt about the ma-\njority’s analysis, as a concurring opinion in Peckham expressed \ndoubt about the analysis of the majority there. \nIt has been 35 years since the Justices last considered the \nextent to which convicted prisoners have rights under the \nFourth Amendment while still inside prison walls. For more \nthan 20 years it has been established in this circuit that the \nFourth Amendment does not apply to visual inspections of \nprisoners. It is best to leave the law of the circuit alone, unless \nand until the Justices suggest that it needs change. \nAFFIRMED \n\nCase: 16-4234      Document: 38            Filed: 07/16/2019      Pages: 15\n6  No. 16-4234 \nLEE, District Judge, dissenting. In prior decisions, we have \nrecognized that convicted prisoners have a reasonable expec-\ntation of privacy in the interior of their bodies sufficient to \ntrigger the Fourth Amendment’s safeguard against unreason-\nable searches (although, as we shall see, this line differentiat-\ning a prisoner’s bodily interior versus exterior is not man-\ndated by Supreme Court precedent, recognized by any of our \nsister circuits, or even uniformly applied by this Court, see \nKing v. McCarty, 781 F.3d 889, 902–04 (7th Cir. 2015) (Hamil-\nton, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)). To \nthis rule, the majority now appends an additional hurdle—a \nprisoner can invoke the Fourth Amendment only when the \nphysical intrusion into her body is carried out by someone \nother than the prisoner herself; this is the case even when a \nprisoner is ordered by correctional officers to probe into her \nown body. Because this new rule is not supported by our \nprior decisions or consistent with established Fourth Amend-\nment jurisprudence, I respectfully dissent.    \nIn Hudson v. Palmer, the Supreme Court held that prisoners \ndo not have a reasonable expectation of privacy as to their liv-\ning quarters or possessions. 468 U.S. 517, 525–26 (1984). But \nthe Supreme Court has yet to address whether (and to what \nextent) prisoners maintain a reasonable expectation of pri-\nvacy as to their persons when it comes to strip searches. Since \nHudson, this court has taken various, sometimes inconsistent, \ntacks to answer this question. Compare Peckham v. Wis. Dep’t of \nCorr., 141 F.3d 694, 697 (1998) (“So, does a prison inmate enjoy \nany protection at all under the Fourth Amendment against \nunreasonable searches and seizures? … [W]e think the answer \nis ‘yes,’…”); Canedy v. Boardman, 16 F.3d 183, 185–86 (7th Cir. \n1994) (applying Fourth Amendment reasonableness test es-\npoused in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), to strip searches), \n\nCase: 16-4234      Document: 38            Filed: 07/16/2019      Pages: 15\nNo. 16-4234  7 \nwith Johnson v. Phelan, 69 F.3d 144, 147 (7th Cir. 1995) (inter-\npreting  “Canedy  and  similar  cases”  as  applying  only  the \nEighth Amendment, not the Fourth); King, 781 F.3d at 899–900 \n(no reasonable expectation of privacy where inmate was re-\nquired to wear see-through clothes for transport).     \nOur prior decisions, however, seem to coalesce around the \nfollowing rule—that prisoners retain a legitimate expectation \nof privacy as to the insides of their bodies, if not the outsides. \nAnd so, in Forbes v. Trigg, 976 F.2d 308, 312–13, 315 (1992), we \nheld that “[u]rine tests are searches for Fourth Amendment \npurposes, and prison inmates retain protected privacy rights \nin their bodies, although these rights do not extend to their \nsurroundings.” Id. at 312. In Del Raine v. Williford, we ex-\nplained that a rectal search conducted by a guard “falls un-\nder” the protection of the Fourth Amendment. 32 F.3d 1024, \n1039 (7th Cir. 1994). And in Sparks v. Stutler, we assumed that \nthe involuntary catheterization of an inmate was subject to the \nFourth Amendment’s protections. 71 F.3d 259, 261–62 (7th \nCir. 1995) (“Certainly Hudson does not establish that the inte-\nrior of one’s body is as open to invasion as the interior of one’s \ncell.”).   \nThis rule, which recognizes an inmate’s right to privacy in \nher body (albeit, we have held, to a limited degree), finds \nsome support in prior Supreme Court decisions. For instance, \nin Winston v. Lee, the Supreme Court held that a criminal de-\nfendant’s expectation of privacy in the inside of his body ren-\ndered unreasonable a compelled surgery to obtain evidence. \n470 U.S. 753, 758–60 (1985). And in Bell, the Supreme Court \nassumed without deciding that pretrial detainees had a legit-\nimate expectation of privacy as to body-cavity searches. 441 \n\nCase: 16-4234      Document: 38            Filed: 07/16/2019      Pages: 15\n8  No. 16-4234 \nU.S. at 558; see also Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of Cty. \nof Burlington, 566 U.S. 318, 326–27 (2012). \nAt the same time, extending the limiting principle in Hud-\nson, we have refused to recognize a reasonable expectation of \nprivacy as to the exterior of inmates’ bodies. For instance, in \nJohnson, we held that opposite-sex monitoring in the prison, \nwhich led to female guards frequently observing male in-\nmates in various states of undress, did not implicate privacy \nconcerns under the Fourth Amendment. 69 F.3d at 145–47. We \nreached a similar conclusion in King, which involved an in-\nmate who was forced to wear a jumpsuit that was “less than \nopaque,” making his genitals and buttocks visible to those \naround him. 781 F.3d at 893, 899–900.  \nBut this rule—distinguishing between a prisoner’s insides \nand  outsides—has  not  been  pronounced  by  the  Supreme \nCourt or adopted by any other circuit. And its legal founda-\ntion has been questioned. See id. at 903 (Hamilton, J., concur-\nring in part and concurring in judgment) (noting that “no \nother circuit applies the categorical rule … finding no Fourth \nAmendment protection against strip-searches or nudity”).    \nTo this, the majority now attaches the added requirement \nthat, for a prisoner to possess a reasonable expectation of pri-\nvacy as to the interior of her body, the intrusion of her insides \nmust be performed by someone else. And because in this case \n“each inmate had to manipulate her own body but do not con-\ntend that the prison’s staff touched any inmate,” the majority \nconcludes that the prisoners lacked any reasonable expecta-\ntion of privacy here.   \nIt seems odd, however, to make the question of whether a \nprisoner has a reasonable expectation of privacy under the \n\nCase: 16-4234      Document: 38            Filed: 07/16/2019      Pages: 15\nNo. 16-4234  9 \nFourth Amendment in the integrity of his or her intimate \nbody cavities dependent on who it is that does the probing or \npenetrating. After all, the applicability of the Fourth Amend-\nment hinges on (1) whether an individual has an actual, sub-\njective expectation of privacy in the subject of the search, and \n(2) whether that expectation is “one that society is prepared \nto recognize as reasonable.” Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, \n361 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring); see Hudson, 468 U.S. at 525. \nThe focus of this inquiry is on an individual’s expectation of \nprivacy “in what was searched,” not who did the searching. \nUnited States v. Scott, 731 F.3d 659, 663 (7th Cir. 2013) (empha-\nsis added); see United States v. Villegas, 495 F.3d 761, 767 (7th \nCir. 2007) (“[W]hether a legitimate expectation of privacy ex-\nists in a particular place or thing must be determined on a \ncase-by-case basis.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). The \nmanner in which a search is conducted is more appropriately \naddressed when assessing its reasonableness. See Bell, 441 \nU.S. at 559. \nThe facts of this case illustrate the ungainliness of the ma-\njority’s new rule. Construing the record in Appellants’ favor, \nas we must on summary judgment, approximately 200 female \ninmates were rounded up early one morning by a tactical \nteam in riot gear. R110-3 at 5. Tightly handcuffed by guards \nwho screamed obscenities at them, the women were taken to \nthe gym, where they remained, handcuffed and standing, un-\ntil the guards searched them. Id. The women were not told \nwhat was happening or why. R110-9. This mass strip search \nof female inmates was conducted solely for training purposes, \nR.110-6 at 76:7–76:10, but the training was not strictly neces-\nsary, as most cadets graduated without it. R974–75.  \n\nCase: 16-4234      Document: 38            Filed: 07/16/2019      Pages: 15\n10  No. 16-4234 \nThe searches took place in a beauty salon and a bathroom \noff the gym. R110-3. Because the beauty shop had mirrored \nwalls, and the bathroom entry was open to the gym, the \nsearches were visible to the people in the gym, including male \nand female cadets, correctional officers, and civilians. Id.  \nDuring the searches, the women stood naked in groups of \nfour to ten, so close to one another that their bodies were \ntouching. Id. One by one, they were told to raise their breasts, \nbend over, spread their buttocks to expose their vaginal and \nanal  cavities,  and  cough.  Id.  Menstruating  inmates  were \nforced to extract tampons from inside their bodies. Id. The fe-\nmale correctional officers and cadets conducting the searches \nmade derogatory comments and gestures about the women’s \nbodies and odors, telling the women that they were “dirty \nbitches,” R110-9 at 2, “fucking disgusting,” “deserve to be in \nhere,” R110-9 at 14, and “smell like death.” R110-9 at 36. Male \ncorrectional officers watched the women from the gym. R110-\n3.  \nThe majority holds that the female prisoners have no re-\ncourse to the Fourth Amendment because it was they them-\nselves who manipulated and intruded upon their own bodies \n(although, of course, they had no choice because they were \nordered to do so). But surely the collecting of urine in Forbes, \n976  F.2d  at  315,  the  catherization  challenged  in  Sparks, \nsee 71 F.3d  at  261–62,  or  the  rectal  probing  in  Del  Raine, \nsee 32 F.3d at 1039, would not fall outside the Fourth Amend-\nment if the prisoners were forced to perform the acts them-\nselves. The distinction between those cases and this one—in \nwhich inmates were ordered to probe their own body cavities \nand subject them to visual inspection—is difficult to discern. \n\nCase: 16-4234      Document: 38            Filed: 07/16/2019      Pages: 15\nNo. 16-4234  11 \nOur recent decision in King did confuse the matter some-\nwhat by drawing a line between “intrusions into [prisoners’] \nbodies”—which we acknowledged might be unreasonable \nunder the Fourth Amendment—and searches involving no \nsuch “intrusion.” 781 F.3d at 900. The majority seizes on that \nlanguage, concluding that any search conducted through only \nvisual  means—regardless  of  the  subject  of  the  search \n(whether insides or outsides) or how that visual inspection \nwas achieved (such as by forcing prisoners to probe and ma-\nnipulate  their  own  bodies)—is  not  amenable  to  Fourth \nAmendment protection. But I think this reads too much into \nKing.  \nRemember  that  the  initial  inquiry  under  the  Fourth \nAmendment asks whether the person searched has a legiti-\nmate expectation of privacy in the place or thing searched—\nnot whether the method of the search implicates a reasonable \nexpectation of privacy. Accordingly, I read King’s reference to \n“intrusions” to merely restate the rule in this circuit that pris-\noners retain some expectation of privacy in the insides of their \nbodies; after all, King did not involve physical “intrusions” of \nany kind. The means of a search, in my view, are still more \npertinent to the second inquiry under the Fourth Amend-\nment—whether the search conducted was reasonable. \nThe majority also draws support from the existence of the \nEighth Amendment, which it feels is a superior vehicle for \nAppellants’ claims. This position reflects a concern with re-\ntaining  the  subjective  component  of  the  Eighth  Amend-\nment—the requirement that prisoners seeking to prove “cruel \nand unusual punishment” show both (1) a violation of their \nsubstantive rights and (2) a culpable mental state. See Whitley \nv. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 319–20 (1986). Because the Fourth \n\nCase: 16-4234      Document: 38            Filed: 07/16/2019      Pages: 15\n12  No. 16-4234 \nAmendment’s inquiry involves only a determination of “rea-\nsonableness,” the majority posits, applying it to prison offi-\ncials’ conduct “would eliminate the subjective component” \nrequired under the Eighth Amendment and would equate \nconvicted prisoners with pretrial detainees. \nTo be sure, we have recognized that “it is the Eighth \nAmendment that is more properly posed to protect inmates \nfrom unconstitutional strip searches, notably when their aim \nis punishment, not legitimate institutional concerns.” Peck-\nham, 141 F.3d at 697; see also King, 781 F.3d at 899–900 (distin-\nguishing between the Fourth and Eighth Amendments); John-\nson, 69 F.3d at 147 (explaining that the Eighth Amendment \ncould be used to “overcome calculated harassment unrelated \nto prison needs”) (quoting Hudson, 468 U.S. at 530). But I dis-\nagree that the Eighth Amendment is superior in all circum-\nstances, or that the application of the Fourth Amendment in \nthis  context  would  simply  be  redundant  of  the  Eighth \nAmendment. Cf. Peckham, 141 F.3d at 699 (Easterbrook, J., con-\ncurring) (“If the only way to use the fourth amendment in \nstrip-search cases is to make it functionally identical to the \ncruel  and  unusual  punishments  clause,  then  what’s  the \npoint?”). \nFirst, the notion that prisoners may have overlapping con-\nstitutional rights is not an alien concept. In fact, we already \nrecognize that prisoners retain other constitutional rights de-\nspite the existence of the Eighth Amendment. For instance, an \ninmate has due process rights as to discipline received in \nprison,  even  though  such  discipline  might  be  considered \n“punishment”  under  the  Eighth  Amendment.  See Wolff  v. \nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 555–56 (1974). And an inmate who is \nbarred from practicing his or her religion or from accessing \n\nCase: 16-4234      Document: 38            Filed: 07/16/2019      Pages: 15\nNo. 16-4234  13 \nthe courts may turn to the First Amendment for redress. See \nO’Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 348–49 (1987); Hudson, \n468 U.S. at 523. The existence of overlapping rights in the Con-\nstitution does not require that one right yield to another, but \nrather suggests that certain spheres of life are constitutionally \nentitled to greater protection. As we have seen, religion and \nspeech are two of those areas; I would argue that the right to \nbe free from arbitrary searches by the government of one’s in-\nsides is another.  \nOf course, this is not to say that inspections like the one \nconducted here are categorically prohibited by the Fourth \nAmendment. The concept of reasonableness under the Fourth \nAmendment is elastic enough to account for the legitimate \nneeds of prisons, and we always must be mindful that prison \nadministrators should be accorded “wide-ranging deference \nin the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in \ntheir judgment are needed to preserve internal order and dis-\ncipline and to maintain institutional security.” Bell, 441 U.S. \nat 547; see also Florence, 566 U.S. at 328 (courts should defer to \nthe expert judgment of correctional officers unless substantial \nevidence indicates that those officers exaggerated their re-\nsponses to security concerns). Indeed, courts in other circuits \ntypically defer to prison administrators and uphold searches \nunder the Fourth Amendment, unless the intrusion on a pris-\noner’s privacy is widely disproportionate to the purported \njustification for the search. See, e.g., Lewis v. Sec’y of Pub. Safety \n& Corr., 870 F.3d 365, 368–69 (5th Cir. 2017) (upholding as rea-\nsonable visual body-cavity searches of groups of prisoners re-\nturning from work duty); Nunez v. Duncan, 591 F.3d 1217, \n1226–28 (9th Cir. 2010) (upholding a visual body-cavity search \nwhere the prisoner failed to present evidence that it was un-\nreasonable); Franklin v. Lockhart, 883 F.2d 654, 656–57 (8th Cir. \n\nCase: 16-4234      Document: 38            Filed: 07/16/2019      Pages: 15\n14  No. 16-4234 \n1989) (holding that visual body-cavity searches did not vio-\nlate the Fourth Amendment because they were justified by \n“legitimate security concerns”).  \nFurthermore, this case illustrates why there is still a dis-\ntinct role for the Fourth Amendment in prisons. Here, alt-\nhough Appellees now attempt to craft a security-based justi-\nfication for the searches, the summary judgment record indi-\ncates that the primary reason was training. Surely a “training” \njustification need not be treated with the same level of defer-\nence as a search conducted due to concerns over smuggled \nweapons or other contraband? It is rationales like this—that \nfall somewhere between legitimate security concerns and un-\njustified harassment—that suggest the continuing need for \nthe Fourth Amendment even in prisons. \nIn this case, I would start by asking if the prisoners in \nquestion had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the subject \nof the searches—i.e., in the insides of their bodies and body \ncavities. To that I would answer yes, and I believe that answer \nwould be supported by precedent in this circuit, although it \nstill needs decisive resolution. See, e.g., Sparks, 71 F.3d at 261–\n62; Del Raine, 32 F.3d at 1039; Forbes, 976 F.2d at 312–13. \nOnly  after  concluding  that  a  protectible  interest  exists \nwould I address the searches’ justification and methodology \nin the context of deciding whether the searches were reason-\nable. This question of reasonableness necessarily requires “a \nbalancing of the need for the particular search against the in-\nvasion of personal rights that the search entails,” including \n“the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it \nis conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in \nwhich it is conducted.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. This two-step ap-\nproach is precisely what was done in Florence. See 566 U.S. at \n\nCase: 16-4234      Document: 38            Filed: 07/16/2019      Pages: 15\nNo. 16-4234  15 \n325–38 (considering a variety of administrative factors in de-\ntermining whether a search was reasonable as to pretrial de-\ntainees).  Because  the  district  court  in  this  case  ended  its \nFourth Amendment analysis after deciding that Appellants \nhad no legitimate expectation of privacy, I would vacate and \nremand for full consideration of the reasonableness factors.  \nAs a final note, the peculiar circumstances of this case raise \nthe question of whether the time has come for this Court to \nreconsider its broader position with respect to the application \nof the Fourth Amendment to inmates’ bodies generally. As \nthe concurring opinion in King pointed out, the distinction \nthis Court has drawn between the interior and exterior of a \nprisoner’s body was not required by the Supreme Court in \nHudson or any subsequent case. See 781 F.3d at 902–04 (Ham-\nilton, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). And \na position recognizing an inmate’s expectation of privacy in \nhis or her body—inside and out—would be consistent with \nthat of every other circuit to have addressed this issue; each \nhas assumed the application of the Fourth Amendment and \nmoved on to address the question of reasonableness. See gen-\nerally Cookish v. Powell, 945 F.2d 441, 445–46 (1st Cir. 1991); \nHarris v. Miller, 818 F.3d 49, 62–63 (2d Cir. 2016); Parkell v. \nDanberg, 833 F.3d 313, 327, 330 (3d Cir. 2016); King v. Ru-\nbenstein, 825 F.3d 206, 215 (4th Cir. 2016); Lewis, 870 F.3d at \n368–69; Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corr., 705 F.3d 560, 575 (6th \nCir. 2013); Franklin v. Lockhart, 883 F.2d 654, 656–57 (8th Cir. \n1989); Nunez, 591 F.3d at 1226–28; Farmer v. Perrill, 288 F.3d \n1254, 1260 (10th Cir. 2002); Fortner v. Thomas, 983 F.2d 1024, \n1030 (11th Cir. 1993). \nFor these reasons, I respectfully dissent. \n ",

More detailed information \non amici appears in the appendix to this brief.1 \nA jury determined that there was no Eighth Amendment remedy against a \nshocking abuse of state power—here, mass sexual violence—because corrections \nofficers allegedly strip-searched prisoners for training purposes rather than with the \nexpress intent to harm. A fractured panel of this Court then—erroneously—held that \nthe Fourth Amendment did not regulate the misconduct because corrections officers \ndid not physically touch the prisoners; rather, they ordered them to violate and \ndegrade themselves. The proper resolution of this case is a matter of grave concern \nto amici because the panel’s error leaves every prisoner incarcerated in Illinois, \nIndiana, and Wisconsin vulnerable to state-sponsored sexual violence that has no \nplace in a civilized society.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n1. Sexual violence is a hallmark of eras and regimes that repulse us. From the \nauction blocks of the American South to the fields of Myanmar, sexual violence has \nbeen relied upon to dehumanize and set the stage for domination.  \n                                                            \n1 No counsel for a party authored any part of this brief and no person other than \namici curiae and their counsel made a monetary contribution to the preparation or \nsubmission of this brief.  \n1 \n\nCase: 16-4234      Document: 51-2            Filed: 08/20/2019      Pages: 25\n \n2. Forced public nudity—here, gratuitous strip- and cavity-searches—is a \nform of sexual violence. While not part of a campaign of armed conflict, genocide, \nor enslavement, the ordeal endured by the prisoners nonetheless shares several \ncharacteristics with the sexual violence utilized by universally reviled regimes. It \nwas inflicted upon marginalized people. It was inflicted upon vulnerable people. It \nviolated fundamental mores regarding public exposure. \n3.  Even  behind  prison  walls,  the  Fourth  Amendment  guards  against \ngovernment encroachment. Here, it continued to shield 200 women from a gratuitous \nand aberrant search, notwithstanding the fact that they were forced to degrade and \nviolate themselves.  \nI.  Sexual Violence Is A Common Attribute Of Many Of The Darkest \nChapters In Recorded History. \n“Sexual violence is not limited to physical invasion of the human body and \nmay include acts which do not involve penetration or even physical contact. \nThe incident described by witness KK in which the Accused ordered the \nInterahamwe to undress a student and force her to do gymnastics naked in the \npublic courtyard … in front of a crowd, constitutes sexual violence.”2 \n \nOn auction blocks throughout the American South, enslaved women were \nstripped  naked  so  that  prospective  buyers  could  ogle  and  jeer.3  Primarily,  the \n                                                            \n2 Prosecutor v.

Muslim women were \nstripped and ordered to humiliate themselves.19 Some were forced to dance naked \natop tables.20 Others were marched through the streets without their clothing.21 One \nvictim described not only terror, but the dehumanizing feeling of being “owned” by \n                                                            \n13 Id. \n14 See Prosecutor v.

Its ubiquity is a testament \nto its effectiveness.

The Sexual Violence Endured By The Class Members Shares Several \nCharacteristics With The Sexual Violence Employed By Universally \nCondemned Regimes.   \nAfter being rousted by a tactical squad, approximately 200 women were \nherded—without explanation—into a prison gymnasium.30 The women were culled \ninto smaller groups and then ordered to “stand naked, nearly shoulder-to-shoulder \nwith 8-10 other inmates in a room where they could be seen by others not conducting \nthe  searches,  including  male  officers.”31  Menstruating  women  were  forced  to \n“remove their tampons and sanitary pads” in front of other prisoners and corrections \n                                                            \n27 See Elisabeth Jean Wood, Conflict-related sexual violence and the policy \nimplications of recent research, 96 INT’L REV.

Ill. \nApr. 14, 2016). \n6 \n\nCase: 16-4234      Document: 51-2            Filed: 08/20/2019      Pages: 25\n \nofficers, including those of the opposite gender, and “many got blood on their bodies \nand clothing and blood on the floor.”32 They were then forced to “stand barefoot on \na floor dirty with menstrual blood and raise their breasts, lift their hair, turn around, \nbend over, spread their buttocks and vaginas.”33 The correctional officers conducting \nthe searches directed derogatory comments at the women, telling them that they were \n“dirty bitches,” “fucking disgusting,” and “smell like death.”34  \nForced public nudity—here, gratuitous strip- and cavity-searches—is a form \nof sexual violence. While of course not part of a campaign of armed conflict, \ngenocide,  or  enslavement,  the  ordeal  endured  by  the  prisoners  nonetheless \nincorporates several characteristics of the sexual violence utilized by universally \ncondemned regimes.  \nFirst, like the Rohingya, the women belong to an oppressed and marginalized \ncohort, rendering them susceptible to targeting without sustained opposition from \nthose with political capital. Women prisoners come from the most “economically \nand politically disadvantaged” segments of society.35 They exist at the intersection \nof four populations that are traditionally disfavored and discriminated against, the \ncumulative effect of which is to render them acutely vulnerable to predation: they \n                                                            \n32 Id. \n33 Id. \n34 Henry v. Hulett, 930 F.3d 836, 841 (7th Cir. 2019) (Lee, J., dissenting). \n35 Candace Kruttschnitt & Rosemary Gartner, Women’s Imprisonment, 30 CRIME & \nJUST. 1, 4, 18 (2003). \n7 \n\nCase: 16-4234      Document: 51-2            Filed: 08/20/2019      Pages: 25\n \nare prisoners; they are women; they are (almost certainly) disproportionately poor; \nthey are (again, almost certainly) disproportionately of color.36 Thus, by virtue of \nidentity, the women may be seen as less deserving of our attention, let alone protest; \nthey were easy targets.  \nSecond, like enslaved Black women ogled on auction blocks, the prisoners \nwere primed to be especially traumatized by sexual violence. Decades of research \ndemonstrate  that  prior  trauma  exacerbates  subsequent  trauma.37  This  general \nproposition applies with particular force to sexual trauma.38 And data show that \nwomen prisoners are overwhelmingly likely to have histories of sexual abuse.39 In \n                                                            \n36 The qualifier “almost certainly” is utilized out of an abundance of caution but \nhardly seems necessary. In 2011, for example, women of color constituted 55% of \nthe Lincoln Correctional Center population, despite constituting a much smaller \npercentage of the Illinois population. Compare \nhttps://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/reportsandstatistics/Pages/Prison-Population-Data-\nSets.aspx with https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/IL. And, to a striking degree, \nincarcerated women are impoverished, even prior to imprisonment.

All \nchildren—especially girls—are socialized to prioritize bodily modesty.41 Intimate \nviews are reserved for intimate relations.42 And when it comes to menstruation, \nmany women maintain a zone of privacy, even from intimate relations.43 The search \nwas a particularly potent act of sexual humiliation and dehumanization precisely \nbecause it was so abnormal.  \nIII.  Forced Public Exposure Does Violence To The Most Fundamental \nAspects Of Our Being And Is Bounded By The Fourth Amendment. \n   \nIn each of the exemplars plucked from the annals of atrocity, sexual violence \nwas  expressly  intended  to  cause  harm—e.g.,  to  dehumanize  the  targets  of  a \ncampaign  of  hostility.  Thus,  the  perpetrators  were—in  constitutional  terms—\n                                                            \n40 See Kevin Barlow, Rauner signs law creating IDOC women’s division, THE \nPANTAGRAPH, Jan. 17, 2018, https://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/rauner-\nsigns-law-creating-idoc-women-s-division/article_4b467bc9-aa96-591f-a4e4-\ne91deb2db56e.html; 730 ILL.

Allen & Abbie E. Goldberg, Sexual Activity During Menstruation: \nA Qualitative Study, 46 J.

We are \ntaught that control over the most intimate portions of our body—our genitals, for \nexample—is ours and ours alone.48 It is understood that, absent circumstances not \n                                                            \n44 E.g., King v.

It  is \nquintessentially the province of the Fourth Amendment to regulate that conduct. And \n                                                            \n49 Id. \n50 Stoudemire v. Mich.

MYERSCOUGH, United States District Judge: \n \n  At the conclusion of a trial beginning on May 31, 2022, a jury \nfound Defendants Melody Hulett, Russell Reynolds, Renee Hatfield, \nand Troy Dawdy liable for violating the rights of the Plaintiff class of \nwomen who were subjected to strip and body cavity searches during \na March 31, 2011, cadet training exercise.  See d/e 261.  The jury \nawarded  compensatory  and  punitive  damages  to  each  of  the  six \ntestifying class members: Plaintiffs Patricia Phillips, Ieshia Brown, \nMiranda Howard, Teresa Williams, Veela Morris, and Michelle Wells.  \nId.    Before  the  Court  is  the  Defendants’  Renewed  Motion  for \n1 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 2 of 30 \nJudgment as a Matter of Law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n50(b) or, in the alternative, for a New Trial under Rule 59(e) [d/e 273].  \nFor the reasons that follow, the Defendants’ motion is denied.   \nBACKGROUND \n  This case has a lengthy procedural history.  In April 2016, U.S. \nDistrict  Judge  Richard  Mills  denied  the  Defendants’  motion  for \nsummary judgment as to the Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claims \nand granted summary judgment on the Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment \nclaims.  See d/e 122.  The Court also left open the possibility of \ninjunctive relief.  Id. at 19.  The case proceeded to trial in November \n2016  on  the  Plaintiffs’  Eighth  Amendment  claims  against  six \nDefendants, including Hulett, Reynolds, Hatfield, and Dawdy.  On \nNovember  21,  2016,  the  jury  returned  a  verdict  in  favor  of  all \nDefendants.   See d/e 177.  In December 2016, the Plaintiffs filed a \nnotice of appeal.  See d/e 186.   \n  On September 2, 2020, the Seventh Circuit issued its mandate \nreversing the Court’s entry of partial summary judgment in favor of \nthe  Defendants  on  Plaintiffs’  Fourth  Amendment  claims  and \nremanding the matter for further proceedings.  See d/e 209; Henry \n2 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 3 of 30 \nv. Hulett, 969 F.3d 769 (7th Cir. 2020).  On August 19, 2021, Judge \nMills entered an Order denying the Defendants’ motion for summary \njudgment  on  qualified  immunity  grounds  as  to  the  Fourth \nAmendment claims.  See d/e 217.  In the same Order, Judge Mills \ntransferred the case to the undersigned for further proceedings.  Id. \nat 6.     \n  The trial on the Fourth Amendment claims commenced on May \n31, 2022.  On June 7, 2022, a jury found Defendants Melody Hulett, \nRussell Reynolds, Renee Hatfield, and Troy Dawdy liable for violating \nthe rights of the Plaintiff class of women.  See d/e 261.   \n  After the close of evidence, the Defendants moved for judgment \nas a matter of law under Rule 50(a).  See d/e 288-1, at 21.  The \nmotion raised a number of grounds, including qualified immunity as \nto all damages claims.  Id. at 22.  Specifically, the Defendants claimed \nthat no developed law at the time of the strip and body cavity search \ntold  Defendants  what  does  or  does  not  constitute  a  reasonable \nsearch.  Id. at 23.  Defendants further asserted that because a jury \nhad already determined that Defendants had not violated the Eighth \nAmendment,  they  cannot  be  liable  for  punitive  damages.    Id.  \n3 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 4 of 30 \nAdditionally, the Defendants alleged that the entire class of Plaintiffs \nhad  not  suffered  a  concrete  injury.    Id.    The  Defendants  also \ncontended that no representative Plaintiff made any allegations of \nwrongdoing as to Defendants Hatfield and Hulett.  Id. at 24.  The \nDefendants argued that, to the extent the Plaintiffs base their claims \non crude language, that does not give rise to a claim under the Fourth \nAmendment.  Id. at 25.  The Defendants further contended that, \nwhile the Plaintiffs allege that the only physical injuries resulted from \nclaims  derived  from  cuffing  and  standing,  neither  representative \nPlaintiff testified that Defendants Reynolds or Dowdy had any role \nregarding the cuffing or standing.  Id. at 26.  The Court denied the \nDefendants’ Rule 50(a) motion.              \nDISCUSSION \n  Legal standard \n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 authorizes district courts “to \nenter judgment against a party who has been fully heard on an issue \nduring  a  jury  trial  if  ‘a  reasonable  jury  would  not  have  a  legally \nsufficient  evidentiary  basis  to  find  for  the  party  on  that  issue.’”  \nPassananti v. Cook County, 689 F.3d 655, 659 (7th Cir. 2012).  The \n4 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 5 of 30 \nCourt construes the evidence strictly in favor of the Plaintiffs as the \nprevailing  party  and  “examines  the  evidence  only  to  determine \nwhether  the  jury’s  verdict  could  reasonably  be  based  on  that \nevidence.”  Id.  The Court does not assess credibility or weigh the \nevidence, and the Court “must disregard all evidence favorable to the \nmoving party that the jury was not required to believe.”  Id.   \n“Because a post-verdict Rule 50(b) motion is ‘only a renewal’ of \na pre-verdict Rule 50(a) motion, a Rule 50(b) motion may be granted \n‘only on grounds advanced in the preverdict motion.’”  Abellan v. \nLavelo Property Management, LLC, 948 F.3d 820, 827 (7th Cir. 2020) \n(quoting  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  50(b)  advisory  committee’s  note  to  2006 \namendment).    While  the  non-movant  may  waive  or  forfeit  these \nrequirements, courts may enforce waiver or forfeiture if the non-\nmovant insists on their observance.  See Abellan, 948 F.3d at 827.  \n“A waived claim or defense is one that a party has knowingly and \nintelligently relinquished; a forfeited plea is one that a party has \nmerely failed to preserve.”  Wood v. Milyard, 566 U.S. 463, 470 n.4 \n(2012).     \n5 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 6 of 30 \nIn considering a motion for a new trial under Rule 59(a), a court \nmay order a new trial “only if the verdict is against the weight of the \nevidence, the damages are excessive, or if for other reasons the trial \nwas not fair to the moving party.”  Abellan, 948 F.3d at 827.  A court’s \nrole in reviewing jury instructions is limited.  See Jimenez v. City of \nChicago, 732 F.3d 710, 717 (7th Cir. 2013).  Courts assess whether \nthe jury was confused or misled by deficient instructions.  See id.  \nThe Court would then need to find that Defendants were prejudiced \nbefore ordering a new trial.  See id.   \n  Qualified immunity \n  The Defendants filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter \nof  law  under  Rule  50(b)  or,  alternatively,  for  a  new  trial.    The \nDefendants claim they are entitled to qualified immunity because the \nFourth Amendment right at issue here was not clearly established at \nthe relevant time because the Seventh Circuit’s en banc decision in \nthis  case  expanded  the  scope  of  prisoners’  privacy  rights  and, \nsimultaneously, Defendants’ liability.  See d/e 273, at 7-11.   \nQualified  immunity  protects  public  officials  from  liability  for \nmoney damages if “their conduct does not violate clearly established \n6 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 7 of 30 \nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would \nhave known.”  Van den Bosch v. Raemisch, 658 F.3d 778, 786 (7th \nCir. 2011) (citing Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 (2009)).  To \ndefeat a qualified immunity defense by a state official, a plaintiff must \nshow “(1) that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right; \nand (2) that the right was ‘clearly established’ at the time of the \nchallenged conduct.”  Kemp v. Liebel, 877 F.3d 346, 350 (7th Cir. \n2017) (citing Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 735 (2011)).  Courts \nare permitted to analyze the “clearly established” prong without first \nconsidering whether the alleged constitutional right was violated.  Id. \nat 351.   \nTo defeat the Defendants’ qualified immunity defense, Plaintiffs \nhave the burden of demonstrating that the alleged violations of their \nconstitutional rights were “clearly established.”  Id.  “To be clearly \nestablished  at  the  time  of  the  challenged  conduct,  the  right’s \ncontours  must  be  sufficiently  clear  that  every  reasonable  official \nwould have understood that what he is doing violates that right.”  Id.  \nThe key inquiry involves whether the official acted reasonably based \non the particular circumstances he or she faced.  Id.   \n7 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 8 of 30 \nWhile a plaintiff need not point to an identical case that finds \nthe  alleged  violation  unlawful,  the  statutory  or  constitutional \nquestion must be beyond debate due to controlling Supreme Court \nor  Seventh  Circuit  precedent.    Id.    In  the  absence  of  controlling \nauthority or persuasive authority that is based on a clear trend in the \ncaselaw, a plaintiff can show that a law was clearly established by \nproving  that  defendant’s  conduct  was  “so  egregious  and \nunreasonable that . . . no reasonable official could have thought he \nwas  acting  lawfully.”    Id.  (quoting  Abbott  v.  Sangamon  County, \nIllinois, 705 F.3d 706, 724 (7th Cir. 2013)).   \nIn determining whether a law was clearly established, the Court \nmust  ensure  that  the  right  allegedly  violated  is  defined  at  the \nappropriate level of specificity.  Id. at 351.  A court should not define \n“clearly established law at a high level of generality.”  Id. (quoting al-\nKidd, 563 U.S. at 742).  The crucial question is “whether the violative \nnature  of  particular  conduct  is  clearly  established.”  Id.  (quoting \nMullenix v. Luna, 577 U.S. 7, 12 (2015)).  “[T]he clearly established \nlaw must be “particularized” to the facts of the case.” Id. (quoting \nWhite v. Pauley, 137 S. Ct. 548, 552 (2017)).             \n8 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 9 of 30 \nIn rejecting the Defendants’ qualified immunity defense in their \nmotion  for  summary  judgment  following  the  Seventh  Circuit’s \nremand, the Court noted  Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 801 F.3d 828 (7th \nCir. 2015) was “somewhat analogous to this situation.”  See d/e 217.  \nIn  Kingsley,  the  defendants  argued  that  the  Supreme  Court  had  \nresolved a circuit split and altered the substantive law of liability.  \nSee Kingsley, 801 F.3d at 831.  The defendants claimed that because \nthe state of the law was uncertain at the time they acted, defendants \ncould  not  be  held  liable  for  their  actions.    See  id.  at  831.    The \nDefendants here contend that any reliance on Kingsley is misplaced \nbecause the Supreme Court there addressed the requisite mental \nstate  for  a  Fourteenth  Amendment  claim  but  did  not  alter  the \nsubstantive law of liability—the same conduct was unlawful both \nbefore and after the Supreme Court’s decision.  See id. at 831-32.  \nThe  Defendants  allege,  by  contrast,  that  the  en banc  decision  in \nHenry  overruled  existing  precedent  concerning  the  scope  of  a \nprisoner’s Fourth Amendment rights to include a right to protection \nfrom  visual  inspections,  thereby  creating  a  new  constitutional \nliability for Defendants.  See Henry, 969 F.3d at 783 (“[W]e thus \noverrule  the  section  of  King  addressing  the  plaintiff’s  Fourth \n9 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 10 of 30 \nAmendment claim and the bright-line rule it announced.  Likewise, \nwe overrule our decision in Johnson to the extent it deems the Fourth \nAmendment  inapplicable  to  visual  inspections  during  bodily \nsearches.”)  The Defendants allege that, in contrast to the scenario in \nKingsley, Defendants could not have known that Plaintiffs’ Fourth \nAmendment  rights  were  implicated  by  the  visual  strip  searches \nbecause  no  such  right  existed  until  the  Seventh  Circuit  decided \nHenry in 2020.  See d/e 273, at 11.  Accordingly, the Defendants \nclaim that Kingsley cannot be applied, and Defendants are entitled \nto qualified immunity because the Fourth Amendment right at issue \nwas not established at the time of Defendants’ conduct.  Id.   \n  Next, in order to preserve the argument for further review, the \nDefendants claim that to the extent the Seventh Circuit’s decision in \nKingsley  precludes  affording  Defendants  the  defense  of  qualified \nimmunity, Kingsley was wrongly decided.  Id. at 11-12.   \n  The  Defendants  next  allege  that,  even  if  it  was  clearly \nestablished in 2011 that visual inspections of prisoners implicate \ntheir Fourth Amendment rights, the contours of that right were not \nclearly established because, at the time of the searches, no case law \n10 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 11 of 30 \nexisted which informed officials what constituted a reasonable search \nunder those circumstances.  Id. at 12.  Beginning in 2020, a visual \nsearch of a prisoner may be found to be unreasonable, depending on \n“the scope of the particular intrusions, the manner in which they \nwere conducted, the justification for initiating them, and the place in \nwhich  they  were  conducted.”    Henry,  969  F.3d  at  784.    The \nDefendants  contend  that  that  the  second  jury  was  tasked  with \nevaluating Defendants’ actions against a standard that did not apply \nin  2011.    See  d/e  273,  at  13.    Defendants  claim  that  qualified \nimmunity exists to preclude retrospective immunity like that.  Id.   \n  Additionally,  the  Defendants  allege  they  could  not  have \nanticipated their pre-search measures—that Plaintiffs were cuffed too \ntightly for a long period while waiting to be searched, they were forced \nto  stand  while  waiting,  and  they  were  not  allowed  to  use  the \nbathroom—would  also  be  considered  in  the  Fourth  Amendment \nanalysis.  Id.  The Defendants claim that no case law, not even Henry, \nestablished that the events leading up to a search might trigger the \nFourth Amendment.  Id.  Accordingly, the Defendants allege they are \nalso entitled to qualified immunity for their pre-search conduct.      \n11 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 12 of 30 \n  The Court concludes that, because the Defendants’ qualified \nimmunity defense is not included in the proposed pretrial order [d/e \n224] or final pretrial order [d/e 231], the qualified immunity defense \nis waived based on Defendants’ failure to preserve.  Because the \npretrial order supersedes the pleadings, “a defense not raised in a \npretrial order is deemed waived.”  SNA Nut Co. v. Haagen-Dazs Co., \nInc., 302 F.3d 725, 732 (7th Cir. 2002); see also Maul v. Constan, \n982  F.2d  784,  785-86  (7th  Cir.  1991)  (Because  “[p]retrial  orders \nsupersede the pleadings,” the failure to include qualified immunity \nin the pretrial order may result in waiver).  “In order for a pretrial \norder to have any value as a procedural mechanism and to protect \nagainst the possibility of either of the parties being taken by surprise \nat trial, the parties must be held to the issues set forth in that order.”  \nHarper v. Albert, 400 F.3d 1052, 1063 (7th Cir. 2005).  A pretrial \norder “superced[es] the pleadings and establishes the issues to be \nconsidered at trial.”  SNA Nut Co., 302 F.3d at 732 (explaining “While \nthis result may seem harsh, pretrial orders help to prevent protracted \nlitigation due to changing theories and arguments such as those that \nwe are encountering in this case”).  This “strict rule of forfeiture” is \n12 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 13 of 30 \nnecessary to prevent either party from being taken by surprise at \ntrial.  See Harper v. Albert, 400 F.3d 1052, 1063 (7th Cir. 2005).  \n  The Defendants here made no mention of a qualified immunity \ndefense in the pretrial order, including in the sections on contested \nissues of fact and law and discussion of damages.  See d/e 231.  \nDefendants did not seek to amend the pretrial order at any time \nthrough the start of trial to include qualified immunity as a defense.  \nThe  Defendants  did  raise  qualified  immunity  in  their  second \nsummary judgment motion.  See d/e 211.  After the motion was \ndenied (d/e 217), the Defendants abandoned the defense, declining \nto pursue it in an interlocutory appeal and then failing to preserve it \nin the pretrial order.  See d/e 224 & 231.   \n  The Court finds it appropriate to hold the parties to the claims \nand defenses contained in the final pretrial order.  Undoubtedly, the \ninformation in the pretrial order affected the Plaintiffs’ trial strategy \nin terms of what evidence to present.  Because of this reliance during \ntrial, the Court concludes it would be unfair to allow Defendants to \nraise qualified immunity at the close of all evidence and following the \n13 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 14 of 30 \nverdict.    Accordingly,  the  Court  concludes  the  Defendants  have \nforfeited the qualified immunity defense.1      \n              \n  Punitive damages \n  The  Defendants  next  claim  that  punitive  damages  are  not \navailable on the basis that the issue was decided at the first trial.  \nSee id. at 14-15.  That jury found in favor of all Defendants on the \nquestion of liability under the Eighth Amendment and thus did not \nseparately address punitive damages.  Id. at 15. The Defendants note \nthat  at  the  second  trial,  Defendants  objected  to  submitting  the \npunitive damages issue to the jury along with liability under the \nFourth  Amendment,  arguing  that  a  jury  already  determined  that \nPlaintiffs  were  unable  to  prove  that  punitive  damages  were \nappropriate.  Id.  The Defendants claim they renewed that argument \nin their motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all \nevidence.    Id.    The  Court  overruled  the  objection  and  submitted \n \n1 The Plaintiffs also contend that Defendants waived or forfeited specific qualified \nimmunity challenges by failing to preserve them in a Rule 50(a) motion.  See d/e 288, \nat 26-28.  Additionally, the Plaintiffs argue the evidence at trial construed in favor of \nthe verdict on liability was sufficient to overcome a qualified immunity defense.  See \nid., at 28-57.  Because the Court concludes that Defendants have forfeited the \nqualified immunity defense, the Court need not address those arguments.   \n14 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 15 of 30 \npunitive  damages  to  the  second  jury  and  denied  the  motion  for \njudgment as a matter of law.  Id.   \n  In  cases  bought  under  §  1983,  a  jury  may  assess  punitive \ndamages if a “defendant’s conduct is shown to be motivated by evil \nmotive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference \nto the federally protected rights of others.”  Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. \n30, 56 (1983).  In cases involving the Eighth Amendment, the level of \nculpability required for liability is the same as the general punitive \ndamage standard.  See Walsh v. Mellas, 837 F.2d 789, 801 (7th Cir. \n1988).    However,  the  “objectively  unreasonable”  standard  of  the \nFourth Amendment is lower than that of the Eighth Amendment.  See \nWilliams v. Rodriguez, 509 F.3d 392, 403 (7th Cir. 2007); Henry, 969 \nF.3d at 780.   \nBecause the first jury found that Plaintiffs failed to act with the \nrequisite mental state, the Defendants claim that jury necessarily \nresolved the question of punitive damages.  Id. at 16.  That jury would \nnot  have  been  able  to  award  punitive  damages  by  finding  that \nDefendants  violated  the  lower,  objective  standard  of  the  Fourth \nAmendment but not the higher, subjective standard of the Eighth \n15 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 16 of 30 \nAmendment.  Id. at 15-16.  The Defendants assert it was error for the \nquestion of punitive damages to be submitted to the second jury, and \nthat portion of the verdict should be vacated.  Id.                   \nTo the extent that Defendants claim issue preclusion bars the \nPlaintiffs from seeking punitive damages on the Fourth Amendment \nclaims, the Court disagrees.  Two of the elements that Defendants \nmust establish are that “(1) the issue sought to be precluded must be \nthe same as that involved in the prior litigation, [and] (2) the issue \nmust have been actually litigated.”  E.E.O.C. v. AutoZone, Inc., 707 \nF.3d 824, 831.  The availability of punitive damages on a Fourth \nAmendment  claim  was  not  litigated  in  the  prior  trial.    Another \nelement  is  that  the  “determination  of  the  issue  must  have  been \nessential to the final judgment.”  See AutoZone, 707 F.3d at 831.  No \ndetermination  of  the  availability  of  punitive  damages  under  the \nFourth Amendment was essential to the jury verdict on the Eighth \nAmendment  claim.    Accordingly,  the  Defendants  are  unable  to \nestablish issue preclusion foreclosing punitive damages on a Fourth \nAmendment claim.   \n16 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 17 of 30 \nAt the trial on the Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claims, the \nparties  presumably  were  cognizant  of  Eighth  Amendment \nrequirements in determining trial strategy.  There was no reason for \nthe parties to consider Fourth Amendment standards in attempting \nto establish punitive damages should be assessed or in defending \nagainst punitive damages.  Because summary judgment had been \nentered  in  favor  of  Defendants  on  Plaintiffs’  Fourth  Amendment \nclaim, the Plaintiffs did not have an opportunity to present a Fourth \nAmendment claim at the first trial.  If the Plaintiffs were able to assert \na  Fourth  Amendment  claim  at  the  first  trial,  the  parties’  trial \nstrategies might well have been different.  The Defendants cite no \nauthority for the proposition that a defense verdict on liability for an \nEighth Amendment claim preludes punitive damages on a Fourth \nAmendment claim.                \nAdditionally,  the  Defendants  acknowledge  that  the  Fourth \nAmendment  jury  was  correctly  instructed  that  it  could  assess \npunitive  damages  if  it  found  that  a  Defendant’s  conduct  was \n“accompanied by ill will or spite” or “reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s \n[Fourth Amendment] rights,” because “Defendant simply did not care \n17 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 18 of 30 \nabout Plaintiff’s safety or [Fourth Amendment] rights.”  See d/e 271, \nat 38.  The jury in the Fourth Amendment trial could have found that \nDefendants  recklessly  exceeded  the  permissible  scope  of  a  strip \nsearch,  without  finding  their  intent  was  to  punish  or  humiliate, \nbecause they simply did not care about Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment \nrights.  Even if the two verdicts were inconsistent, however, the Court \nconcludes that the second verdict should take precedence given that \nPlaintiffs had an opportunity to present their Fourth Amendment \nclaim  at  the  second  trial,  and  the  jury  was  instructed  on  the \napplicable law.  Accordingly, the Court has no basis to find that the \npunitive damages issue was necessarily resolved by the first jury and \nshould not have been submitted to the second jury.  The Court will \ndeny this portion of Defendants’ motion.             \n  Compensatory damages \n  The Defendants next allege that compensatory damages are not \navailable  under  the  Prison  Litigation  Reform  Act,  42  U.S.C.  § \n1997e(e), which bars compensatory damages for mental or emotional \ninjuries  without  a  prior  showing  of  a  physical  injury  or  the \ncommission of a sexual act.  Id.  A sexual act is defined in 18 U.S.C. \n18 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 19 of 30 \n§ 2246 and is not at issue in this case.  The Defendants contend none \nof the Plaintiffs’ allegations constitute a “physical injury,” which is \nnot defined in the PLRA and has not been defined by the Seventh \nCircuit.  Id. at 16-17.   \n  The Defendants state that, at the close of evidence, Defendants \nmoved for judgment as a matter of law on the basis that Plaintiffs \nhad failed to allege a physical injury.  Id. at 17.  The Court denied \nthat motion.  Id.  The Defendants argue this was error, as standing \nand  wearing  cuffs,  even  when  applied  too  tightly,  may  be \nuncomfortable but does not constitute a physical injury that satisfies \nthe PLRA.  Id.  On that basis, the Defendants claim the Court should \nvacate the award of compensatory damages.  Id.      \n  The Defendants further allege that, assuming the Court viewed \nthe issue of physical injury as one for the jury to decide, the Court \nerred  in  not  instructing  the  jury  on  the  PLRA  limitation  after \nDefendants  submitted  a  proposed  instruction  that  would  have \ninformed  the  jury  of  the  PLRA  limitation.    Id.    Ultimately,  the \nDefendants claim that without such an instruction, the jury awarded \ncompensatory damages for mental and emotional injuries without \n19 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 20 of 30 \ndetermining if a physical injury occurred.  Id.  The Defendants ask \nthe Court to vacate the award of compensatory damages or grant \nDefendants  a  new  trial  in  which  the  jury  is  properly  instructed \nregarding the PLRA.  Id.   \n  The  Defendants next  allege  that,  to  the  extent  the  Plaintiffs \nclaim that the PLRA does not apply because not all the Plaintiffs were \nincarcerated  when  the  original  complaint  was  filed,  Plaintiffs’ \nargument is contrary to the plain language of the statute.  Id.   \n  The Court finds that Defendants waived their PLRA physical \ninjury defense by failing to include it as a barrier to compensatory \ndamages  in  the  final  pretrial  order.    The Defendants  did  identify \n“whether Plaintiffs suffered damages” as a contested legal issue.  See \nd/e 231, at 5.  However, that framing of the issue is far broader than \nwhether  the  physical  injury  provision  precluded  compensatory \ndamages.    Defendants  did  not  identify  the  physical  injury \nrequirement  in  the  final  pretrial  order  even  though  Plaintiffs \nindicated they were seeking damages for “emotional injury including \nhumiliation,  embarrassment,  shame,  and  degradation,  as  well  as \n20 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 21 of 30 \ndamages associated with the violation of their constitutional rights.”  \nSee d/e 231, at 6.   \n  Before  trial,  the  parties  eventually  agreed  that  liability  and \ndamages  should  be  decided  at  the  trial.    See  d/e  247  &  252.  \nHowever, the Defendants did not seek to amend the pretrial order to \nadd a legal or factual issue regarding physical injury or address the \nissue prior to trial.  Because the issue was not properly preserved in \nthe  final  pretrial  order,  the  Court  finds  that  the  physical  injury \ndefense, like qualified immunity, has been forfeited.   \n  Additionally, the Defendants did not raise the physical injury \ndefense in their summary judgment motions.  Defendants did not \nraise a challenge based on the PLRA’s physical injury requirement in \nthe first round of summary judgment briefing.  See d/e 102 & 103.  \nOn  appeal,  the  Defendants  attempted  to  raise  the  issue  but  the \nSeventh Circuit declined to reach it stating: \nDefendants moved for summary judgment. . . . Defendants did \nnot    .  .  .  argue  that  Plaintiffs  failed  to  present  evidence  of \nphysical injury pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act . . \n. .   \nDefendants did not raise this argument below, and therefore \nhave waived it for purposes of this appeal. . . . \n21 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 22 of 30 \nBecause  the  district  court  granted  summary  judgment  on \nPlaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment claim, it did not assess any of \nthese arguments pertaining to the availability of remedies as to \nthat claim.  We thus also leave these issues for the district \ncourt’s initial determination on remand.   \n \nHenry, 969 F.3d at 775, 787.  Following the mandate, Judge Mills set \na dispositive motion deadline of December 18, 2020, at which time \nany issues consistent with the Seventh Circuit’s Opinion were to be \naddressed.    See  Text  Order  of  Sept.  29,  2020.    However,  the \nDefendants did not raise the physical injury requirement challenge \nin their second summary judgment motion.  See d/e 211.   \n  The Defendants obviously knew they had attempted to raise the \nphysical injury requirement challenge before the Seventh Circuit.  \nHowever, the issue was not raised in the summary judgment motion \nfollowing the mandate.  Accordingly, the issue was also waived or \nforfeited at this stage.2       \n \n2 It appears that the physical injury requirement challenge was first raised \napproximately one week before jury selection in the Eighth Amendment trial.  See d/e \n144, Pls. MIL No. 9.  Plaintiffs immediately asserted waiver.  Id.  The Court denied the \nmotion as premature because damages had been bifurcated.  See d/e 157, at 4.  \nAlthough the issue was never adjudicated, this appears to be another basis for finding \nthat Defendants waived the PLRA physical injury defense.     \n22 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 23 of 30 \n  For all of these reasons, the Court concludes that the physical \ninjury requirement has been forfeited.            \n  Case as a class action \n  The Defendants next claim that the case proceeded improperly \nas a class action.  See d/e 273, at 18.  At the second trial, the \nPlaintiffs  called  as  witnesses  both  damages  class  representatives \n(Phillips and Morris) and both injunctive class representatives (Ieshia \nBrown  and  Howard),  as  well  as  two  non-representative  class \nmembers.  Id.  The Defendants claim that the jury was not instructed \nwhich witnesses were damages class representatives, and all six were \nincluded on the verdict form without distinction.  Id.     \nThe  Defendants  state  that,  at  the  close  of  all  evidence, \nDefendants objected to the class as certified as part of their motion \nfor  judgment  as  matter  of  law.    Id.    Defendants  claim  that  trial \nevidence showed the damages class representatives were not typical \nof the class.  Id.  The Court denied Defendants’ motion.  Id.   \n  The  Defendants  further  allege  that,  the  damages  class \nrepresentatives—Phillips and Morris—did not have experiences on \nMarch 31, 2011, that were typical of the other class members.  Id.  \n23 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 24 of 30 \nNeither Phillips nor Morris testified that any of the Defendants put \nthe cuffs on them, had any knowledge that the cuffs were too tight, \nor were requested to loosen the cuffs; neither class representative \ntestified that Defendants told them they could not sit; and neither \ntestified  about  the  denial  of  the  bathroom  and  the  unhygienic \nconditions  during  the  searches.    Id.  at  18-19.    Therefore,  the \nDefendants claim that the representatives were not typical of the \nclass and all class members were not subjected to the same set of \nconditions.  Id. at 19.  Citing Federal of Civil Procedure 23(c)(1)(C), \nthe  Defendants  note  that  an  order  granting  or  denying  class \ncertification can be amended at any time before entry of judgment.  \nId. at 18.   \n  The Defendants further claim the Court erred in including all \nsix class members on the verdict form without distinguishing as to \nwho was a class representative and in refusing to instruct a  jury \nwhat to do if it did not believe each representative had proved her \ncase.  Id. at 19.  Defendants seek a new trial with proper instructions \nregarding the class representatives and their burden of proof.  Id.   \n24 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 25 of 30 \n  As  the  Plaintiffs  note,  the  Defendants’  arguments  regarding \nclass  action    procedure  are  conclusory,  unsupported  by  record \ncitation, and almost entirely devoid of authority.3  See d/e 288, at 77.  \nThe  Defendants’  challenges  to  commonality  and  typicality  are \nunsupported.    Defendants  make  allegations  about  handcuffing, \nstanding and hygiene without citing to the record.  In 2013, the Court \ncertified  the  class  over  Defendants’  objections,  finding  the  class \nrepresentatives’ experiences typical of the class.  See d/e 68, at 8 and \n87, at 7-8.  Defendants did not ask the Court to reconsider that ruling \nor seek a Rule 23(f) appeal of the class certification ruling.  Between \n2013 and the close of evidence at the June 2022 trial, the Defendants \ndid not challenge commonality or typicality or seek decertification or \ndisqualification of any class representatives.  Defendant also did not \nraise such issues in their first summary judgment motion, at any \ntime prior to the Eighth Amendment trial, or immediately following \nthe Eighth Amendment trial.   \n \n3 The Defendants do cite Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(1)(C) for the proposition \nthat an order denying or granting class certification can be altered or amended any \ntime before entry of judgment.   \n25 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 26 of 30 \n  When  the  Seventh  Circuit  initially  considered  the  Plaintiffs’ \nappeal  of  the  dismissal  of  the  Fourth  Amendment  claims,  the \nDefendants did not raise any issue as to certification.  After rehearing \nen banc was granted, the Defendants did raise the issue, stating: \n“Even if plaintiffs were to survive summary judgment on their Fourth \nAmendment  theory  and  overcome  the  bar  on  compensatory  and \npunitive damages, the damages class would have to be de-certified \nbecause  the  summary  judgment  evidence  established  that  the \ninmates had not presented questions of law or fact common to the \nclass.”  See Case No. 16-4234 (7th Cir.), at 56.  The Seventh Circuit \ndeclined to consider the issue because it was outside the scope of the \ncourt’s review absent a cross-appeal.  See Henry, 969 F.3d at 787.   \n  On  remand,  the  parties  were  given  the  opportunity  to  file \ndispositive  motions.    See  Text  Order  of  Sept.  29,  2020.    The \nDefendants did not raise any challenges to the class action procedure \nin  their  second  summary  judgment  motions.    See  d/e  211,  241.  \nMoreover, Defendants did not challenge the certification or typicality \nof class representatives in any other pretrial filing.  The Defendants \nhad no objection to the substitution of Veela Morris and Miranda \n26 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 27 of 30 \nHeyward  as  class  representatives  in  place  of  previous \nrepresentatives.  See d/e 226, at 2; Text Order of Dec. 17, 2021; Text \nOrder of May 18, 2022.  Additionally, the Defendants proffered no \nobjection to class action procedures in the final pretrial order [d/e \n231].  The parties agreed on the class action damages instruction and \njointly submitted the instruction.  See d/e 270, at 28, adopted by \nCourt at 288-1, 6/6/2022 Trial Trans. Excerpts, at 9:17-9:20.  Only \nafter the close of evidence did Defendants, for the first time, raise an \nissue about the class representatives.  Based on the foregoing, the \nCourt concludes that Defendants have forfeited any challenges to \nclass  certification  through  their  delay,  their  omission  of  such \nchallenges  in  the  pretrial  order,  and  their  contrary  stipulations.  \nAccordingly, any challenge to class action procedures--including any \nchallenge  to  damages  representatives,  injunctive  representatives, \ntestifying class members, and verdict forms—has been forfeited.                     \n  Jury instruction on deference to prison administrators \n  The Defendants next allege the Court erred in not instructing \nthe jury on the deference owed to prison administrators.  Id.  “When \nevaluating  reasonableness,  in  the  context  of  strip  searches  of \n27 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 28 of 30 \nprisoners  as  in  others,  courts  must  afford  prison  administrators \n‘wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and \npractices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order \nand discipline and to maintain institutional security.’”  Henry, 969 \nF.3d at 783 (quoting Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547 (1979)).  The \nDefendants  claim  the  Court  erred  in  refusing  Defendants’  jury \ninstruction that conveyed that information, and a new trial should \nbe granted with an appropriate instruction on the issue.  Id. at 19-\n20.    \n  The Court rejected proposed instructions from the Plaintiffs and \nDefendants and gave the following instruction:  \nPrison officials may conduct strip searches for the purpose of \npreserving safety, security, discipline, and order.  Even strip \nsearches that are conducted to serve those legitimate purposes \nmust be carried out in a reasonable manner.   \nIn  deciding  whether  the  strip  searches  in  this  case  were \nunreasonable  you  should  consider  all  the  circumstances, \nincluding the scope of the intrusions, the manner in which the \nstrip searches were conducted, the justification for conducting \nthe strip searches, and the place in which the strip searches \nwere conducted.   \nYou must decide whether the Defendants you are considering \nsubjected  Plaintiffs  to  unreasonable  strip  searches  from  the \nperspective  of  a  reasonable  officer  facing  the  same \ncircumstances that the Defendant faced.  You must make this \ndecision based on what the Defendant knew at the time the strip \n28 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 29 of 30 \nsearches were conducted, not based on matters learned after \nthe strip searches were conducted.   \n \nSee d/e 271, at 32-33.  Although the Defendants initially objected to \nthis  instruction  before  the  final  two  sentences  were  added,  the \nDefendants stated they had no objection after those sentences were \nincluded.  See d/e 288-1, at 20:7-21:4; 288-14, at 6:9-6:25.  Because \nthe Defendants agreed to this instruction as an accurate statement \nof the law, Defendants cannot show the Court erred in giving it.  See \nDoe v. Johnson, 52 F.3d 1448, 1460 (7th Cir. 1995) (“[I]n a civil case, \na  litigant  may  not  attack  an  instruction  of  which  he  was  the \nproponent.”).   Accordingly, the Court concludes that Defendants \nhave  forfeited  a  challenge  to  instructing  the  jury  regarding  the \ndeference owed to prison administrators.   \nCONCLUSION \n  The Court concludes that each of the Defendants’ challenges to \nthe jury verdict are either forfeited or fail on the merits.  Accordingly, \nthe Court will deny the motion for judgment as matter of law under \nRule 50(b) or, alternatively, for a new trial under Rule 59.   \n29 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 289    Page 30 of 30 \n  For the reasons stated herein, the Defendants’ Renewed Motion \nfor Judgment as a Matter of Law or, in the alternative, for a New Trial \n[d/e 273] is DENIED.   \nENTER: October 25, 2022        \n            /s/ Sue E.

MYERSCOUGH, United States District Judge: \n \n  Before the Court is the Defendants’ motion to certify certain \nissues  for  interlocutory  appeal  and  stay  further  proceedings  on \ndamages [d/e 298].  For the reasons that follow, the Defendants’ \nmotion is denied.    \n  Pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §  1292(b),  the  Defendants  seek \ncertification for immediate appeal three questions of law decided in \nthe Court’s October 25, 2022, Order denying Defendants’ renewed \nmotion for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil \n1 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 303    Page 2 of 5 \nProcedure 50(b) [d/e 289].  The Defendants ask the Court to certify \nthe following issues for immediate appeal: \n(1) Are Defendants entitled to qualified immunity from damages       \non Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment claims where those claims \nwere  not  cognizable  in  Illinois  until  the  Seventh  Circuit \noverturned its own precedent in this case?   \n(2) Does  a  jury  verdict  for  Defendants  on  Plaintiffs’  Eighth \nAmendment claims over the manner of the strip searches \nforeclose  punitive  damages  under  the  Fourth  Amendment \nbased on the same searches, where the Eighth Amendment \nmental  state  standard  is  coextensive  with  the  punitive \ndamage standard?   \n(3) Does the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e) \n(PLRA),  bar  compensatory  damages  for  any  plaintiff \nincarcerated  at  the  time  of  filing  who  has  not  shown  a \nphysical  injury  from  a  Fourth  Amendment  violation,  even \nthough that claim is part of a class action?   \nSee d/e 298, at 1-2.  The Defendants claim that these damages issues \nshould be resolved now on appeal.  Id.  If the issues are resolved in \nthe Defendants’ favor, moreover, the need to schedule trials to resolve \n2 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 303    Page 3 of 5 \nquestions of compensatory and punitive damages for class members \nwould be eliminated.  Id.   \n  The Plaintiff states that, because of the age of this case, the \nparties should proceed to conducting damages trials in the event that \nsettlement efforts are unsuccessful.  See d/e 300, at 19.  Defendants \nwould have an opportunity to appeal post-judgment.  The Plaintiff \nasks the Court to set a prompt date for resolution of any pretrial \nissues.  Id.   \n  Section 1292(b) permits this Court to certify an interlocutory \nappeal from an order not otherwise appealable.  28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).  \nTo certify an appeal under § 1292(b), the Court must find that (1) the \norder involves a question of law, (2) the question is controlling in the \ncase, (3) substantial grounds exist for a difference of opinion on that \nquestion,  and  (4)  immediate  appeal  may  materially  advance  the \nultimate termination of the litigation.  Id.; Sterk v. Redbox Automated \nRetail, LLC, 672 F.3d 535, 536 (7th Cir. 2012).     \n  The  Court  denied  on  forfeiture  grounds  the  Defendants’ \nqualified immunity defense raised in Defendants’ post-trial motion.  \nSee d/e 289, at 13-14.  Because Defendants do not seek to certify \n3 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 303    Page 4 of 5 \nany questions regarding the forfeiture ruling, Defendants proposed \nQuestion 1 is not controlling in the case.   \n  Even if the Defendants had sought certification of the Court’s \nforfeiture ruling, that ruling is not a pure question of law that can be \nresolved without reference to the record.  Waiver presents a mixed \nquestion of law and fact.  See Baker v. Lindgren, 856 F.3d 498, 506 \n(7th Cir. 2017) (noting the different standards of review for the factual \ndeterminations and the legal questions).     \n  The  Court  also  finds  that  Defendants’  proposed  Question  2 \nregarding punitive damages is not a pure question of law.  Because \nthe Seventh Circuit would have to consider the factual circumstances \nand trial evidence in order to adjudicate the issue, the Defendants \ncannot show that this issue raises a pure question of law.   \n  The Court further finds that resolution of the three questions \npresented in an interlocutory appeal will not materially advance the \nultimate termination of this litigation.  This case is almost twelve \nyears old.  The Plaintiffs note that, since this case was filed, multiple \nclass members and one class representative have died and other \nclass members have increasing health concerns with age.  See d/e \n300,  at  18.    The  prior  appeal  took  nearly  four  years  to  resolve.  \n4 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-SEM-EIL   # 303    Page 5 of 5 \nAnother  interlocutory  appeal  would  result  in  increased  litigation \ncosts for Plaintiffs while also delaying resolution of this case.  The \nmemories of class members and other witnesses concerning the 2011 \nstrip searches will continue to fade.  Moreover, the likelihood that \nadditional class members do not live to see resolution of this case \nwould increase with an interlocutory appeal.  For all of these reasons, \nthe Court concludes certifying the three questions in an interlocutory \nappeal would not materially advance termination of the litigation.    \n  Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Defendants have \nnot satisfied the criteria to certify an interlocutory appeal.      \n  For these reasons, the Defendants’ motion for certification of \nquestions  related  to  the  availability  of  damages  for  interlocutory \nappeal  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §  1292(b)  and  to  stay  further \nproceedings on damages [d/e 298] is DENIED.   \nENTER: January 4, 2023 \nFOR THE COURT:         \n            /s/ Sue E.

This is an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 challenging the unjustified, \ninvasive and humiliating public strip search inflicted upon female inmates at Lincoln \nCorrectional Center (“Lincoln”) on March 31, 2011. \n2.  On the morning of March 31, 2011, Assistant Warden Reynolds, members of \nLincoln’s “Orange Crush” tactical team, and other Lincoln correctional officers stormed the \ndormitories of Housing Units 2B and 4B and ordered all of the women to line up by the beds.  \nThe officers handcuffed the women and marched them to the gym, yelling obscenities and \nthreats as they walked.  Once in the gym, the officers forced the women to stand facing the wall, \nshoulder to shoulder, for more than one hour.  The women were then publicly strip searched in \n2 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 83    Page 3 of 20                                              \n     \ngroups of four to six, within plain view of male correctional officers, male cadets, and civilians.  \nAs the women were being strip searched, many of the correctional officers made derogatory \ncomments and insulting gestures about the women’s body parts and odors.  The women were \nforced to wait until everyone had been strip searched before being permitted to return to their \ndormitories. \n3.  The incident lasted nearly four hours and was unsanitary, sexually invasive, \ndegrading, and dehumanizing.  The women were never told why they were being searched, and \nwhen they inquired, the officers ignored their questions and threatened to punish them if they \ndidn’t stay quiet. \n4.  In fact, this group strip search was a “training exercise” for Illinois Department of \nCorrections cadets, organized by Defendants Hulett, Reynolds, Jones, Hatfield, Pasley, and as-\nyet unknown Illinois Department of Corrections employees.  There was no legitimate purpose for \nsubjecting the women to this public group strip search – it was unrelated to institutional security, \ndiscipline or order, and none of the women searched were suspected of possessing contraband or \nhaving committed other prohibited activity. \n5.  Lincoln Correctional Center had no justification to force the women to submit to \nthis public group strip search or to force them to endure such an unsanitary, humiliating and \ndegrading process.  Nevertheless, Defendants organized and approved of this cadet training \nexercise, thereby instituting an unconstitutional public group strip search and turning a blind eye \nto the dehumanizing way in which the search was conducted. \n6.  Plaintiffs bring this class action to compensate those who were victimized by this \npublic group strip search and, hopefully, to bring change. \n   \n3 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 83    Page 4 of 20                                              \n     \nJurisdiction and Venue \n7.  The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 as \nPlaintiffs assert claims under federal law. \n8.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) as the events giving rise to the claims \nin this case all occurred in this judicial district. \nParties \n9.  Named Plaintiff BEVERLY THROGMORTON is 48 years old.  She resides in \nBloomington, Illinois.

On the morning of March 31, 2011, Named Plaintiffs Throgmorton, Henry, \nPhillips, Hegwood, and Ieshia Brown (the “Named Plaintiffs”) were in Housing Unit 2B at \nLincoln Correctional Center when the Orange Crush Defendants, Defendants Reynolds and \nDowless, and IDOC cadets stormed the Unit.  Immediately thereafter, the Defendants and IDOC \ncadets stormed Housing Unit 4B. \n26.  The Defendants walked through the Units yelling and banging their batons, and \nordered all the inmates to the dormitory.  Once in the dormitory, the Defendants searched the \nwomen, handcuffed their hands behind their backs, and marched them to the day room.  During \nthe walk, several of the Orange Crush Defendants screamed obscenities at the women, called \n7 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 83    Page 8 of 20                                              \n     \nthem derogatory names, and threatened to place them in segregation if they disobeyed.  There \nwas no need for this abuse, as the women were all compliant. \n27.  From the day room, the handcuffed women were taken to the gym, where the \nremaining Defendant Officers were waiting.  The Orange Crush Defendants, the Defendant \nOfficers and Defendant Reynolds forced the women to stand shoulder to shoulder facing the gym \nwall for approximately one hour.  At no point did any of the Defendants tell Plaintiffs \nThrogmorton, Henry, Phillips, Hegwood, or any of the other women what was happening, or \nwhy.  Instead, they continued to scream at and threaten the women. \n28.  Forced to stand for such a lengthy duration under stress and intimidation, some of \nthe women experienced seizures; others soiled themselves. \n29.  When approximately one hour had passed, the female Defendants began to take \ngroups of up to seven women at a time into either of two rooms abutting the gym: the bathroom \nand the beauty shop.  The bathroom was open to the gym, giving the male Defendants and the \nmale IDOC cadets clear views of the women.  The beauty shop had mirrored walls and a door \nthat remained open for the duration of the strip searches, subjecting the naked women to stares \nfrom the correctional officers, civilian employees and cadets who walked by.  The beauty shop \nalso had a window that faced the outdoors, permitting anyone outside to observe the women \ninside.  The civilian beauty shop supervisor was never told to leave, and remained in the shop for \nthe duration of the strip searches. \n30.  Named Plaintiffs Henry, Hegwood, and Brown were among the groups of women \ntaken into the bathroom for public group strip searches.  In the bathroom, the groups of women \nwere forced to remove their clothing and stand in a line.  Due to the number of inmates, cadets, \nand correctional officers occupying the cramped space, the naked women were forced to stand \n8 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 83    Page 9 of 20                                              \n     \nnearly shoulder to shoulder.  The women on their menstrual cycles were told to take out their \ntampons, but were not permitted to do so privately, so they had to remove them in plain view of \nthe other inmates, correctional officers, and cadets.  Because they were not allowed to use the \ntoilets, the women were forced to discard their used tampons into a communal garbage bin. \n31.  Standing close together, shoulders touching, the women were forced to raise their \nbreasts, lift their hair, and cough and squat several times.  They were then forced to turn their \nbacksides to the cadets, bend over and spread open their buttocks and vaginas.  As they did this, \nmale cadets and correctional officers could, and did, watch them from the gym.  Some of the \nDefendant Officers and Orange Crush Defendants made insulting and derogatory comments \nabout the women’s odors and body parts. \n32.  Throughout the strip searches, the women were forced to stand barefoot on the \nbathroom floor, which was dirty with menstrual blood and other bodily fluids.  The women’s \nclothes were discarded on that floor during the searches.  At no point did any Defendant or other \nIDOC employee make any attempt to clean the area where the women were standing. \n33.  Women on their menstrual cycle were not given tampons after the strip searches.  \nRather, they were forced to put their clothing back on with glib suggestions that they use toilet \npaper if necessary.  Many of these women got blood on their legs, feet, and clothes.  They were \nthen sent back to the gym to wait until everyone had been strip searched. \n34.  Ms. Henry, Ms. Hegwood, and Ms. Brown had been strip searched on numerous \noccasions at Lincoln Correctional Center prior to the March 31, 2011 public group strip search.  \nThose strip searches were conducted privately and efficiently, and there is no valid reason for \nfailing to conduct the March 31, 2011 strip searches in that manner. \n9 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 83    Page 10 of 20                                             \n      \n35.  Named Plaintiffs Throgmorton and Phillips were among the women taken to the \nbeauty shop for public group strip searches.  One or more Defendants and several IDOC cadets \nwere in the beauty shop, along with the civilian beauty shop supervisor, and they carried on \ncasual conversations amidst the humiliating public group strip searches.   \n36.  In the beauty shop, the IDOC cadets initially ordered the women, one at a time, to \nstand in front of the other women and remove all of their clothes.  In front of the other inmates \nand the civilian beauty shop supervisor, and in plain view of the window to the outdoors, Ms. \nThrogmorton was forced to lift her breasts, raise her hair, hold her buttocks open with her hands \nand squat and cough three times.  Ms. Throgmorton was then forced to stand with her backside \nfacing the inmates, bend over, and spread her buttocks and vagina, in plain view of the other \nwomen and any passersby.  Ms. Throgmorton was kept naked for 15 to 20 minutes. \n37.  During her term of incarceration at Lincoln, Ms. Throgmorton was strip searched \nregularly for her job.  Ms. Throgmorton estimates that she was strip searched between 150 and \n200 times.  Those strip searches were conducted professionally, privately, and quickly. \n38.  When one or more of the Defendants commented that the individual strip searches \nwere taking too long, the IDOC cadets began to strip search the women in the beauty shop in \ngroups.  Ms. Phillips was ordered to disrobe and stand in a group with four other women, nearly \ntouching.  Ms. Phillips was subjected to the same strip search process as Ms. Throgmorton: the \nbreast raising, the squat and coughs, and the bending over to expose her private parts.  At some \npoint, Ms. Phillips observed one of the Defendant Officers put a bandana over her nose, \ngesturing rudely about the women’s odors.  When it was over, the women were sent back to the \ngym to wait. \n10 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 83    Page 11 of 20                                             \n      \n39.  Ms. Phillips had experienced other routine strip searches at Lincoln Correctional \nCenter.  Those strip searches were conducted privately and professionally. \n40.  After everyone had been strip searched, the women were finally dismissed.  The \nline to the showers that afternoon was twenty women long.  The women were later told that the \nincident had been a training exercise for the IDOC cadets. \n41.  Throughout the incident, Ms. Throgmorton, Ms. Phillips, Ms. Henry, Ms. \nHegwood, Ms. Brown, and the other women were forced to endure humiliation, degradation, and \nthreats.  These highly intrusive strip searches afforded no privacy to the women; were conducted \nunder unsanitary, harassing and humiliating conditions; and were carried out by the Defendants \nin an abusive manner. \n42.  There was no valid justification for these public group strip searches.  They were \nnot driven by concerns regarding Lincoln’s institutional security or employee or inmate safety, \nand there was no suspicion that any of the women in Housing Units 2B and 4B were \nparticipating in illicit conduct requiring further investigation, discipline or punishment.   \n43.  The public group strip searches inflicted on the women at Lincoln are the most \nintrusive types of searches the government can conduct, and the manner in which they were \nconducted was degrading, dehumanizing, and humiliating. \n44.  All of the Defendants named in their individual capacities, from Assistant Warden \nReynolds to the individual correctional officers, participated in and were present for the entire \nduration of the incident. \n45.  Ms. Throgmorton, Ms. Phillips, Ms. Henry, Ms. Hegwood, Ms. Brown, and \nothers promptly wrote grievances about the strip searches.  Their grievances were left in the \ngrievance boxes for days, even as the Named Plaintiffs repeatedly asked Defendants and other \n11 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 83    Page 12 of 20                                             \n      \ncorrectional officers to attend to them.  Although the grievances were finally taken out of the \nboxes, in the nearly one year that has passed, not a single woman has received a response to her \ngrievance. \n46.  In approximately March 2013, all of the female inmates at Lincoln Correctional \nCenter were transferred out of the facility and it was converted to an all-male prison.  The \nwomen, including Ms. Brown and Ms. Hegwood, were primarily transferred to nearby Logan \nCorrectional Center. \n47.  On the morning of October 31, 2013, a virtually identical “cadet training \nexercise” occurred at Logan Correctional Center.  Named Plaintiffs Jacqueline Hegwood, Sandra \nBrown, Ieshia Brown, and more than one hundred and fifty other female inmates at Logan were \nsubjected to degrading and humiliating public group strip searches in full view of male \ncorrections officers, cadets, and other individuals not involved in the strip searches. \n48.  All of the “cadet training exercises” are organized and approved by the IDOC \nTraining Academy and its Manager of Staff Development and Training, the IDOC Chief of \nOperations, and the Warden of the facility. \nClass Allegations \n49.  Named Plaintiffs THROGMORTON, HENRY, PHILLIPS, HEGWOOD, \nBROWN, and BROWN (the “Named Plaintiffs”) seek to pursue claims both for themselves and \nfor a class of others similarly situated.  Named Plaintiffs believe the class should be organized \ninto the following two subclasses. \n50.  Class I consists of:   \nAll individuals who were subjected to the March 31, 2011 public group strip search at \nLincoln Correctional Center. \n \n12 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 83    Page 13 of 20                                             \n      \nClass I brings claims pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and the \nEighth Amendment.  Named Plaintiffs THROGMORTON, HENRY, PHILLIPS, HEGWOOD, \nand BROWN seek to represent this class. \n51.  The members of Class I include inmates who are presently in-custody as well as \nformer Lincoln Correctional Center inmates who were released at some time after March 31, \n2011.  Because the claims of the in-custody class members will be analyzed through the lens of \nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act, it is appropriate to divide Class I into two separate subclasses: \nSubclass A consists of:  All individuals who were subjected to the March 31, 2011 public \ngroup strip search at Lincoln Correctional Center, and who have remained in the custody \nof the Illinois Department of Corrections since that time. \n \nSubclass B consists of:  All individuals who were subjected to the March 31, 2011 public \ngroup strip search at Lincoln Correctional Center, and who were subsequently released \nfrom the custody of the Illinois Department of Corrections. \n \n52.  The individuals in Class I are so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpractical.  The Named Plaintiffs estimate that more than 150 women are members of Class I. \n53.  There are questions of law and fact common to the claims of the Class.  Among \nthese common questions are: \na.  Whether the public strip search was an unreasonable search in violation of the \nFourth and/or the Eighth Amendments; \nb.  Whether the use of the public strip search and/or the way in which it was \nconducted violates the inmates’ rights under the Fourth and/or Eighth Amendments; \nc.  Whether the responsible IDOC employees instituted, condoned, and/or were \ndeliberately indifferent to the risk of the violations of the Class members’ rights; and \n13 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 83    Page 14 of 20                                             \n      \nd.  Whether the responsible IDOC employees at Lincoln Correctional Center \nfailed in their supervisory responsibilities to have avoided and/or put a stop to the violations of \nthe Class members’ rights. \n54.  The claims of the Named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of Class I.  The \nNamed Plaintiffs were inmates at Lincoln Correctional Center and were subjected to the March \n31, 2011 public group strip search.  Named Plaintiffs THROGMORTON, HENRY, PHILLIPS, \nand HEGWOOD are no longer in IDOC custody, and will represent the interests of Subclass A.  \nNamed Plaintiff BROWN remains within the custody of IDOC and will represent the interests of \nSubclass B.  Collectively, they seek to prove that the public group strip search violated their \nrights under the Fourth, Fourteenth, and Eighth Amendments, and that each of the Defendants is \nliable as a result. \n55.  The Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of Class I.  \nThey have retained skilled counsel with experience in class action, constitutional, and strip \nsearch litigation. \n56.  The questions of law and fact common to Class I predominate over any individual \nissues.  In addition, a class action would be the most fair and efficient method of adjudicating the \nClass members’ claims. \n57.  Named Plaintiffs seek to pursue an injunctive relief claim both for themselves and \nfor a class of others similarly situated.   \n58.  Class II consists of: \nAll women who are currently incarcerated at Logan Correctional Center, and all women \nwho will be incarcerated at Logan Correctional Center in the future. \n \n14 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 83    Page 15 of 20                                             \n      \nClass II brings claims pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and the \nEighth Amendment in order to secure injunctive relief.  Named Plaintiffs BROWN and BROWN \nseek to represent this class. \n59.  The individuals in Class II are so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpractical.  Named Plaintiffs BROWN and BROWN estimate that approximately 2,000 women \nare members of Class II. \n60.   There are questions of law and fact common to the claims of the Class.  Among \nthese common questions are: \na.  Whether the public strip search of the type used during the cadet training exercises at \nLincoln Correctional Center and Logan Correctional Center was an unreasonable \nsearch in violation of the Fourth and/or the Eighth Amendments; \nb.  Whether the use of the public strip search and/or the way in which it was conducted \nviolates the inmates’ rights under the Fourth and/or Eighth Amendments; \nc.  Whether the responsible IDOC employees instituted, condoned, and/or were \ndeliberately indifferent to the risk of the violations of the Class members’ rights;  \nd.  Whether the responsible IDOC employees failed in their supervisory responsibilities \nto have avoided and/or put a stop to the violations of the Class members’ rights; and \ne.  Whether there is a cognizable danger that Plaintiffs will be subject to recurring \nviolations of their constitutional rights in the manner described herein. \n61.  The claims of Named Plaintiffs BROWN and BROWN are typical of the claims \nof Class II. \n15 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 83    Page 16 of 20                                             \n      \n62.  Named Plaintiffs BROWN and BROWN will fairly and adequately represent the \ninterests of Class II.  They have retained skilled counsel with experience in class action, \nconstitutional, and strip search litigation. \n63.  The questions of law and fact common to Class II predominate over any \nindividual issues.  In addition, a class action would be the most fair and efficient method of \nadjudicating the Class members’ claims. \nCount I – Claims Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nViolations of the Fourth & Fourteenth Amendments \n \n64.  Plaintiffs re-allege each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully stated herein. \n65.  There was no valid penological justification for the March 31, 2011 public group \nstrip search. \n66.  By instituting and continuing the public group strip search described in fuller \ndetail above, Defendants subjected Named Plaintiffs and the members of Class I to an \nunreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment. \n67.  As a direct result of the express decisions of the Defendants who were in charge \nof organizing, approving, and/or arranging for this public group strip search, the Named \nPlaintiffs and members of Class I were subjected to unreasonable body searches that were \ndemeaning, dehumanizing, and humiliating.  Furthermore, these Defendants had supervisory \nresponsibility to terminate the public group strip search and failed to do so. \n  WHEREFORE, Named Plaintiffs THROGMORTON, HENRY, PHILLIPS, \nHEGWOOD, and BROWN respectfully demand judgment on behalf of themselves and Class I, \nawarding costs, fees, attorneys’ fees, actual damages, and any other appropriate relief against \nDefendants REYNOLDS, ANDERSON, DALLAS, EDMONSON, JOHNSON, LEONETTI, \nDOWDY, PFEIFFER, CRAIG, SLATER, KRUDUP, KRULL, M. BROOKS, BUTLER, LAST, \n16 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 83    Page 17 of 20                                             \n      \nBENDER, BOCH, BROWN, DILLEY, HINTON, JOHNER, JOHNSON, KENNEY, KILLAM, \nMATHIAS, RICKORD, SPANIOL, VAN MIDDLESWORTH, and WARDEN, IDOC \nEmployees RENEE HATFIELD and ALAN PASLEY, IDOC Chief of Operations EDDIE \nJONES, and the as-yet Unknown Illinois Department of Corrections Employees.  Named \nPlaintiffs THROGMORTON, HENRY, PHILLIPS, and HEGWOOD further demand an award \nof punitive damages on behalf of themselves and Class I against Defendants REYNOLDS, \nANDERSON, DALLAS, EDMONSON, JOHNSON, LEONETTI, DOWDY, PFEIFFER, \nCRAIG, SLATER, KRUDUP, KRULL, M. BROOKS, BUTLER, LAST, BENDER, BOCH, \nBROWN, DILLEY, HINTON, JOHNER, JOHNSON, KENNEY, KILLAM, MATHIAS, \nRICKORD, SPANIOL, VAN MIDDLESWORTH, and WARDEN, IDOC Employees RENEE \nHATFIELD and ALAN PASLEY, IDOC Chief of Operations EDDIE JONES, and the as-yet \nUnknown Illinois Department of Corrections Employees. \nCount II – Claims Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nViolations of the Eighth Amendment \n \n68.  Plaintiffs re-allege each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully stated herein. \n69.  There was no valid penological justification for the March 31, 2011 public group \nstrip search. \n70.  By instituting and continuing the group strip search described in fuller detail \nabove, Defendants subjected Named Plaintiffs and the members of Class I to punishment in \nviolation of the Eighth Amendment. \n71.  As described more fully above, the Defendants conducted the public group strip \nsearch in a harassing manner intended to humiliate the inmates. \n72.  As a direct result of the express decisions of Defendants who were in charge of \norganizing, approving, and/or arranging for this public group strip search, the Named Plaintiffs \n17 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 83    Page 18 of 20                                             \n      \nand members of Class I were subjected to unreasonable body searches that were demeaning, \ndehumanizing, and humiliating.  Furthermore, these Defendants had supervisory responsibility to \nterminate the public group strip search and failed to do so. \n  WHEREFORE, Named Plaintiffs THROGMORTON, HENRY, PHILLIPS, \nHEGWOOD, and BROWN respectfully demand judgment on behalf of themselves and the \nClass, awarding costs, fees, attorneys’ fees, actual damages, and any other appropriate relief \nagainst Defendants REYNOLDS, ANDERSON, DALLAS, EDMONSON, JOHNSON, \nLEONETTI, DOWDY, PFEIFFER, CRAIG, SLATER, KRUDUP, KRULL, M. BROOKS, \nBUTLER, LAST, BENDER, BOCH, BROWN, DILLEY, HINTON, JOHNER, JOHNSON, \nKENNEY, KILLAM, MATHIAS, RICKORD, SPANIOL, VAN MIDDLESWORTH, and \nWARDEN, IDOC Employees RENEE HATFIELD and ALAN PASLEY, IDOC Chief of \nOperations EDDIE JONES, and the as-yet Unknown Illinois Department of Corrections \nEmployees.  Named Plaintiffs THROGMORTON, HENRY, PHILLIPS, and HEGWOOD \nfurther demand an award of punitive damages on behalf of themselves and the Class against \nDefendants REYNOLDS, ANDERSON, DALLAS, EDMONSON, JOHNSON, LEONETTI, \nDOWDY, PFEIFFER, CRAIG, SLATER, KRUDUP, KRULL, M. BROOKS, BUTLER, LAST, \nBENDER, BOCH, BROWN, DILLEY, HINTON, JOHNER, JOHNSON, KENNEY, KILLAM, \nMATHIAS, RICKORD, SPANIOL, VAN MIDDLESWORTH, and WARDEN, IDOC \nEmployees RENEE HATFIELD and ALAN PASLEY, IDOC Chief of Operations EDDIE \nJONES, and the as-yet Unknown Illinois Department of Corrections Employees. \nCount III – Injunctive Relief \n73.  The Illinois Department of Corrections permits and often conducts public group \nstrip searches during “cadet training exercises” in the manner described herein.  Indeed, since the \n18 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 83    Page 19 of 20                                             \n      \ninitial filing of this lawsuit, and following the transfer of the female inmates from Lincoln to \nLogan, a virtually identical public group strip search took place during a “cadet training \nexercise” at Logan Correctional Center.  There is thus a cognizable danger that Plaintiffs will be \nsubjected to recurrent violations of their constitutional rights in the manner described herein.  An \ninjunction prohibiting such strip searches is an appropriate judicial remedy to prevent the \nrecurrence of these improper procedures. \n  WHEREFORE, Named Plaintiffs BROWN and BROWN, on behalf of themselves and \nClass II, respectfully demand that the Court enjoin Defendants LOCKE, YURKOVICH, and \nZAVALA, in their official capacities, from continuing the acts and practices set forth in \nparagraphs 25-48, and for any other and further equitable relief as it may deem just and proper.   \nFurther Request for Relief \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court certify this case as a class \naction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) for injunctive relief and (b)(3) for \ndamages, and appoint the undersigned as class counsel pursuant to Rule 23(g). \nJury Demand \n  Named Plaintiffs THROGMORTON, HENRY, PHILLIPS, HEGWOOD, BROWN, and \nBROWN respectfully demand a trial by jury on behalf of themselves and the Class Members on \nall issues so triable. \n             \n   \n19 \n \n\n3:12-cv-03087-RM-TSH   # 83    Page 20 of 20                                             \n      \n              RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, \n \n \n              /s/  Rachel Steinback \n              Attorneys for Plaintiffs \n \nArthur Loevy \nMichael Kanovitz \nJon Loevy \nRachel Steinback \nLOEVY & LOEVY \n312 North May Street, Suite 100 \nChicago, IL 60607 \n(312) 243-5900 \n20 \n ",
