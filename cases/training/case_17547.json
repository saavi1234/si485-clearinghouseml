          "description": "ORDER denying 57 Respondents' Motion in Limine to Preclude Undisclosed Expert Testimony of Dr. Robert Murphy.Plaintiffs were ordered to provide a list of expert and lay witnesses by the close of business on May 15, 2020. 52 . On May 15, 2020, Plaintiffs informed Defendants' counsel that they intended to call Dr. Robert L. Murphy as one of their expert witnesses and that the doctor's qualifications, declaration and disclosure would be forthcoming. On Sunday, May 17, Dr. Murphy's declaration was forwarded to defendants. Plaintiffs state that they transmitted the declaration as soon as they had it. Plaintiffs need to substitute a different infectious disease doctor, rather than use a doctor who previously provided a declaration, was driven by exigencies of the current pandemic and the pressing responsibilities of prominent, busy, clinicians. Further, Plaintiffs represent that Dr. Murphy's testimony closely tracks that previously provided by Dr. Golub, as well as that of Plaintiffs' other medical declarants. While the Court understands the demands on Defendants and their counsel, they are not unduly prejudiced. Counsel knew as of last week that Plaintiffs might provide a substitute expert due to the tight scheduling requirements, and that the substitute witness's qualifications and testimony would be consistent with prior declarations filed in support of a TRO and/or preliminary injunction. Nor, are Defendants prejudiced by a lack of an expert report prior to a deposition. As set forth during the conferences on May 11 and 14, the parties are engaging in expedited discovery and there is insufficient time for perfect Rule 26 disclosures. See McPherson v. Lamont, Civ. No. 3:20-cv-00534 (JBA), ECF No. 56, at *1 (D. Conn. May 16, 2020) (quoting In re World Trade Ctr. Disaster Site Litig., 722 F.3d 483, 487 (2d Cir. 2013) (It is well established that district courts possess the inherent power and responsibility to manage their dockets 'so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.'). Defendants will have an opportunity to depose Dr. Murphy and inquire into his credentials, experience and basis for his opinion. On this record, the Court finds no surprise or prejudice to Defendants in the substitution of Dr. Murphy as an expert witness. See, id., at *2 (finding exigent circumstances exist warranting an expedited schedule and noting that Defendants have had notice of Plaintiffs' claims since the case was filed on April 20, 2020, and to review the evidence filed in support of a TRO and Preliminary Injunction since April 27, 2020).The Court remains available to address issues as they arise on an expedited schedule. While the parties have a right to be heard on their objections and to develop a record, there is limited time remaining to prepare for a preliminary injunction hearing on May 22, 2020. The parties are strongly encouraged to contact the Court rather than engage in motion practice and delay a ruling. Signed by Judge William I. Garfinkel on 5/18/20. (Esposito, A.)

Specifically, the Court found that settlement was the product of arm's length negotiations conducted by experienced counsel, and so enjoyed a presumption of fairness. See In re Austrian & German Bank Holocaust Litig., 80 F. Supp. 2d 164, 173 (S.D.N.Y. 2000), aff'd sub nom. D'Amato v. Deutsche Bank, 236 F.3d 78 (2d Cir. 2001). The Court also found that factors articulated in City of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp., 495 F.2d 448, 463 (2d Cir.1974), abrogated on other grounds by Goldberger v. Integrated Resources, Inc., 209 F.3d 43 (2d Cir. 2000), weighed in favor of approval. Accordingly, the Court GRANTED the 169 Motion for Approval of Class Action Settlement.

In such instances, the Court need not designate the filer as a movant, intervenor, or other kind of participant. Signed by Judge Janet Bond Arterton on 9/16/20.(Tooker, Aimee) (Entered: 09/17/2020)"

    "summary": "<p>COVID-19 Summary: This is a putative class action brought on April 20, 2020, by five detainees at the Connecticut Department of Correction, seeking release from detention or transfer to home confinement due to elevated health risks in light of the virus. The class was certified on June 12. On July 17, the parties entered into a settlement agreement which provided for a variety of specific mitigation measures to improve COVID-19-related sanitation, hygiene, testing, and medical monitoring at every Connecticut DOC facility, and discretionary release that prioritizes prisoners who are 65 or older, or with a medical score of 4 or 5. The agreement was approved and the case was dismissed on July 22. Several individuals have objected to the settlement and two individuals have appealed. The settlement agreement expired on December 31, 2020. There was on appeal pending but it was dismissed on March 16, 2021, the case is now believed to be closed.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>On April 20, 2020, five individuals held at the Connecticut Department of Correction (DOC) filed a putative class action at the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut. Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, ACLU of Connecticut and private counsel, the plaintiffs brought this lawsuit as a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. under &sect; 2241, and as an injunctive and declaratory action under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2201-02. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the conditions of confinement posed an unreasonable risk of COVID-19 in violation of detainees&rsquo; Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. They alleged that the defendants' failure to implement CDC-mandated guidelines had resulted in a surge of COVID-19 cases at the DOC, and that those detainees had been transferred to isolation units unfit to serve as medical correctional facilities.The case was assigned to Judge Charles S Haight, then reassigned to Judge Janet Bond Arterton on April 27.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed this action on behalf of all people who are, or will be, held in DOC, via a \"Pre-adjudication Class\" and a \"Post-adjudication Class.\" These classes, which represent an estimated 11,840 people, are further grouped into subclasses, which are: the &ldquo;Medically Vulnerable Pre-adjudication Subclass,&rdquo; comprised of medically vulnerable detainees awaiting the adjudication of their charges, and the &ldquo;Medically Vulnerable Post-adjudication Subclass,&rdquo; comprised of those currently serving a criminal sentence. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and/or a writ of habeas corpus requiring the immediate release of both subclasses, as well as a plan for mitigation efforts in compliance with CDC guidelines, to be overseen by a qualified public health expert. In the alternative of the immediate release, the petitioners sought an expedited review of the complaint.</p>\r\n<p>On April 27, the plaintiffs submitted a motion for temporary restraining order requesting that the plan for mitigation efforts to be submitted in three days, as well as weekly reports of medically vulnerable populations held at the DOC. The defendants submitted a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on May 1, claiming that the plaintiffs failed to exhaust available habeas remedies and administrative remedies under &sect;1983 and the Prison Litigation Reform Act.</p>\r\n<p>The motion to dismiss was denied on May 6, noting that the normal grievance process was &ldquo;practically . . . incapable of use&rdquo; for COVID-19 purposes, due to the imminent health threat the virus posed. 2020 WL 2198279. The case was then referred to Judge William I Garfinkel for the purpose of expediting scheduling and discovery.</p>\r\n<p>On May 10, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, requesting similar demands as in the motion for TRO. On May 18, the defendants claimed that they had already significantly reduced the inmate population in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (1,810 detainees or 14.6% of the total population), and implemented evaluations for early release.</p>\r\n<p>Between June 1-6, the parties had settlement conferences before Magistrate Judge Garfinkel. Pursuant to their settlement agreement, the parties jointly sought class certification on June 11; the proposed class was &ldquo;[a]ll persons who were incarcerated in a DOC facility from March 1, 2020, or are incarcerated, or in the future will be so incarcerated, until the termination date of this Agreement, December 31, 2020.&rdquo; Class certification was granted on June 12. On June 19, the court directed notice to the class.</p>\r\n<p>On July 2, Rupert A. Thompson, an individual held at the Connecticut DOC, sought to intervene. Between July 2-13, over fifty individual plaintiffs submitted various objections to the settlement agreement, such as a lack of notice regarding the class, and sought to opt-out, claiming that the agreement did not address the needs of the entire inmate population. Another individual held at the facility sought to intervene on July 13.</p>\r\n<p>On July 17, the defendants sought an order finding compliance with the order giving notice to the class and for a finding of adequacy of the notice given. The same day, the parties sought approval of their settlement agreement. In the settlement agreement, the parties agreed to a variety of specific mitigation measures to improve COVID-19-related sanitation, hygiene, testing, and medical monitoring at every Connecticut DOC facility, and discretionary release that prioritized prisoners who are 65 or older, or with a medical score of 4 or 5. A five-person monitoring panel was to (1) oversee adherence to COVID-19-related correctional public health standards and to (2) make real-time, publicly available, recommendations to DOC regarding its COVID-19 mitigation efforts. The agreement also outlined a dispute resolution procedure in front of Judge Garfinkel in the event of defendants&rsquo; non-compliance with the measures in the Agreement.</p>\r\n<p>On July 20, the court denied the post-notice motions of class members seeking to opt-out, as they requested individualized relief. The same day, the court granted the defendants motion for an order finding compliance. The court held a hearing and on July 22, as agreed in the settlement agreement, the court dismissed the case.</p>\r\n<p>Several individuals continued to object to the settlement and the court required the parties to respond to the objections by November 30. Two individuals appealed the settlement approval on August 17 and 20. The first appeal, filed by Michael Young, was assigned USCA Case Number 20-2949, and was subsequently dismissed on March 16, 2021.</p>\r\n<p>Individuals continued to file objections to settlement, motions to reopen the case, and on January 26, a non-party filed an emergency motion for restraining order. On March 2, the court issued a notice stating that the settlement agreement expired on December 31, 2020 and the class ceased to exist as of that same date. The court further stated that it terminated its jurisdiction and all motions and requests related to the settlement that were filed after December 31 were dismissed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 2, 2021, an individual filed a motion to reopen the case. On April 23, 2021, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal and denied as moot all of appellant&rsquo;s remaining motions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of March 30, 2025, the case is closed.&nbsp;</p>",

The class was certified on June 12.

On April 7, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, along with a memorandum of law\nin support. FN3Thereafter, on April 8, 2020, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which adds Kerri\nDirgo and Joshua Wilcox as additional plaintiffs, and which includes additional allegations and changes\nto some previous allegations. FN4\nIn the amended complaint, the plaintiffs ask the court to issue a writ of mandamus compelling the\ndefendants to (a) “immediately release all people having the CDC heightened risk factors for serious\nillness or death from COVID-19, to an appropriate medical facility where necessary”; (b) “immediately\nand meaningfully reduce the population density at each and every facility in which they confine people”;\n(c) “submit for the court’s review and ongoing monitoring a plan: (1) to provide adequate sanitation and\nsocial distancing in prisons so as\nto prevent the spread of COVID-19, including by taking all measures for screening, cleaning, hygiene\nand social distancing that the CDC recommends for correctional facilities; (2) to diagnose and treat\npeople showing symptoms of COVID-19 in accordance with contemporary standards of care, (3) to\napprove, within seven days, community or private residences to those qualified for release to such via\n[General Statutes] § 18-100, (4) to approve, within seven days, residences for any prisoner or detainee\nwho is now eligible for release but for the defendant’s approval of a residence, and (5) to sufficiently\nfund transitional housing for the duration of the pandemic; and (d) undertake any other task necessary to\ndischarge their duties to those in their custody during the pandemic, including by working with other\narms of state government to expedite their handling of requests for release, and ensuring consideration\nof relief for all incarcerated people who can safely return to their communities.”\nThe defendants assert in their motion to dismiss that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this\naction on the basis that the defendant CCDLA lacks standing because it fails the classical aggrievement\ntest and because it cannot assert third party standing on behalf of the individual plaintiffs. They also\nassert that the individual plaintiffs lack standing because they do not have any right to be released prior\nto the end of their lawful sentences and because their constitutional claims are based on alleged injuries\nthat are too speculative. The defendants also assert that the plaintiffs’ claims are nonjusticiable political\nquestions. Finally, the defendants contend that the plaintiffs’ request for the court to order the defendants\nto submit a plan for the court’s review is barred by sovereign immunity to the extent that such a plan\ncalls for the defendants to sufficiently fund transitional housing for the duration of the pandemic because\nsuch a plan would amount to an award of damages from the state, which has not consented to be sued.\nOn April 13, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion and the defendants\nfiled a reply, along with a declaration of Cary Freston. Arguments on this motion were heard before this\ncourt on the record on April 15, 2020. Counsel for all parties participated by telephone.\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 1 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-2   Filed 05/01/20   Page 9 of 16\nDISCUSSION\n“[A] motion to dismiss . . . properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the\nplaintiff cannot as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court.”\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.) Santorso v. Bristol Hospital, 308 Conn. 338, 350, 63 A.3d 940\n(2013). “A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without\njurisdiction.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) MacDermid, Inc. v. Leonetti, 310 Conn. 616, 626, 79\nA.3d 60 (2013). “A court deciding a motion to dismiss must determine not the merits of the claim or\neven its legal sufficiency, but rather, whether the claim is one that the court has jurisdiction to hear and\ndecide.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Hinde v. Specialized Education of Connecticut, Inc., 147\nConn. App. 730, 740-41, 84 A.3d 895 (2014).\nA\nStanding\n“[J]usticiability comprises several related doctrines, namely, standing, ripeness, mootness and the\npolitical question doctrine, that implicate a court’s subject matter jurisdiction and its competency to\nadjudicate a particular matter. . . . A case that is nonjusticiable must be dismissed for lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Janulawicz v. Commissioner of Correction, 310\nConn. 265, 270, 77 A.3d 113 (2013).\n“[B]ecause the issue of standing implicates subject matter jurisdiction, it may be a proper basis for\ngranting a motion to dismiss.” Electrical Contractors, Inc. v. Dept. of Education, 303 Conn. 402, 413, 35\nA.3d 188 (2012). “The proper procedural vehicle for disputing a party’s standing is a motion to\ndismiss.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) D’Eramo v. Smith, 273 Conn. 610, 615 n.6, 872 A.2d 408\n(2005). “If . . . the plaintiff’s standing does not adequately appear from all materials of record, the\ncomplaint must be dismissed.” (Footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Burton v.\nDominion Nuclear Connecticut, Inc., 300 Conn. 542, 550, 23 A.3d 1176 (2011).\n“It is well established that [a] party must have standing to assert a claim in order for the court to have\nsubject matter jurisdiction over the claim. . . . Standing is the legal right to set judicial machinery in\nmotion. One cannot rightfully invoke the jurisdiction of the court unless he has, in an individual or\nrepresentative capacity, some real interest in the cause of action, or a legal or equitable right, title or\ninterest in the subject matter of the controversy. . . . [Our Supreme Court] has often stated that the\nquestion of subject matter jurisdiction, because it addresses the basic competency of the court, can be\nraised by any of the parties, or by the court sua sponte, at any time. . . . Where a party is found to lack\nstanding, the court is consequently without subject matter jurisdiction to determine the cause. . . .\n“Standing is no mere procedural technicality. As the United States Supreme Court has explained, ‘[t]he\npower to declare the rights of individuals and to measure the authority of governments . . . is legitimate\nonly in the last resort, and as a necessity in the determination of real, earnest and vital controversy.’ . . .\nValley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S.\n464, 471, 102 S. Ct. 752, 70 L. Ed. 2d 700 (1982). As a result, ‘[t]he exercise of judicial power, which\ncan so profoundly affect the lives, liberty, and property of those to whom it extends, is therefore\nrestricted to litigants who can show [an injury] resulting from the action which they seek to have the\ncourt adjudicate.’ . . . Id., 473. The standing requirement further evinces a proper regard for the judicial\nbranch’s relationship with coequal branches of government under our constitutional structure. Thus, ‘[i]t\nis the role of courts to provide relief to claimants, in individual or class actions, who have suffered, or\nwill imminently suffer, actual harm; it is not the role of courts, but that of the political branches, to shape\nthe institutions of government in such fashion as to comply with the laws and the Constitution.’ Lewis v.\nCasey, 518 U.S. 343, 349, 116 S. Ct. 2174, 135 L. Ed. 2d 606 (1996).” (Citations omitted; footnotes\nomitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Johnson v. Rell, 119 Conn. App. 730, 735–37, 990 A.2d 354\n(2010).\nThe defendants argue that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiffs lack standing\nto pursue their claims in this mandamus action. In support of their position, they argue that none of the\nplaintiffs are classically aggrieved because they have not alleged any direct injury. They also maintain\nthat the plaintiffs have failed to allege facts to meet the other standing requirements applicable to each of\nthe plaintiffs.\n1. Associational Standing as to the CCDLA\nWith regard to the CCDLA, the defendants first argue that the CCDLA lacks standing because the\ncomplaint sets forth no allegations of any injury to the CCDLA or its members; the plaintiffs allege only\npotential injury to some clients of its members. They further maintain that the CCDLA cannot\nsuccessfully assert associational standing because such standing requires the plaintiffs to allege that the\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 2 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-2   Filed 05/01/20   Page 10 of 16\nCCDLA has suffered or will suffer some direct injury in its own right. They note that no such allegations\nare included in the complaint. In opposition, the plaintiffs argue that the CCDLA may avail itself of\nassociational standing to bring this action on behalf of its members because they meet the requirements\nfor such standing. Specifically, they maintain that its members suffer an injury in fact and therefore\nwould otherwise have standing to maintain this action in their own right because they face the threat of\ncoronavirus infection when visiting their clients who are “cycling in and out of DOC custody.” They\nfurther assert that the interests they seek to protect are germane to the CCDLA’s purpose, which is to\nsupport its members in their defense of people accused of violating the law. Finally, they assert that\nparticipation of the individual members would not be required. In their reply, the defendants assert that\nthe plaintiffs’ assertions of injury in their memorandum in opposition are not a substitute for allegations\nin their operative complaint, which do not allege any such injuries, and argue that the CCDLA members\nhave no rights under the eighth or fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and are not\nrequired to enter prisons to represent their clients. They also argue that because the plaintiffs do not\nallege that CCDLA members represent inmates in any actions asserting conditions of confinement\nclaims, they fail to satisfy the “germaneness” prong of the associational standing test.\nThe court agrees with the defendants that the plaintiffs have not alleged facts demonstrating that the\nCCDLA meets the requirements for such standing. Specifically, the plaintiffs have not alleged that the\nCCDLA or any of its members have suffered any injury. In the amended complaint, the plaintiffs allege\nthat the CCDLA “is a nonprofit Connecticut organization comprising lawyers who represent people\naccused of crimes in the state,” it “has approximately 300 members statewide,” “[i]ts members represent\nclients held in each of the facilities controlled by the Connecticut Department of Correction,” and it\n“engages in education and advocacy for the fair treatment of those accused of crimes, and for positive\nchanges in Connecticut’s criminal and motor vehicle code,” and “also serves as an amicus curiae to\nConnecticut’s appellate courts.” (Amended complaint, entry #114, ¶¶ 1-4.) The CCDLA is not\nmentioned in anywhere else in the complaint, and these allegations fail to assert that it has suffered or\nwill suffer any direct injury.\n“An organization may file suit on its own behalf ‘to seek judicial relief from injury to itself and to\nvindicate whatever rights and immunities the organization itself may enjoy.’ Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S.\n490, 511, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 45 L. Ed. 2d 343 (1975). In order to do so, however, an organization must\nsatisfy the constitutional minimum of standing by demonstrating an ‘injury in fact’; a causal connection\nbetween the injury and the conduct of which the party complains; and that it is ‘likely’ a favorable\ndecision will provide redress.” Juvenile Matters Trial Lawyers Assn. v. Judicial Dept., 363 F. Supp. 2d\n239, 244 (D. Conn. 2005). Without any allegation of an injury in fact to the CCDLA, it fails to meet the\nrequirements of associational standing. In Juvenile Matters Trial Lawyers Assn. v. Judicial Dept., supra,\n363 F. Supp. 2d 245, an organization of attorneys who provided legal services to juveniles and their\nfamilies brought an action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against the Judicial Department and\nseveral individual defendants. In opposing a motion to dismiss asserting lack of standing, the plaintiff\nargued that it had standing to bring this action in its own right, on behalf of its members, and on behalf\nof the clients represented by the member attorneys. As in the present case, the complaint in that case did\nnot include any allegation of injury to the association itself. Accordingly, the District Court determined\nthat the plaintiff lacked standing to bring the action on its own behalf in that action. That same reason\napplies here. As the plaintiffs have not alleged any injury to the CCDLA, it lacks standing to assert any\nclaim on its own behalf.\nMoreover, any injury on behalf of the CCDLA that might be inferred from the complaint would be too\nindirect to demonstrate the CCDLA’s standing because any such injury would be suffered by individual\nclients of individual members of the CCDLA. In Connecticut State Medical Society v. Oxford Health\nPlans (CT), Inc., 272 Conn. 469, 481–82, 863 A.2d 645 (2005), the plaintiff had argued that it had\nsufficiently alleged an injury suffered by the plaintiff in that it alleged that its members had suffered\ninjury by the defendant’s failure to make timely and complete payments to those members, which, in\nturn, resulted in the plaintiff suffering injury because the defendants’ actions caused the plaintiff to\nexpend resources and to suffer a reduction in revenue from its members. The court upheld the trial\ncourt’s decision dismissing the action for lack of standing because the plaintiff’s injuries “derive solely\nand exclusively from the harm allegedly visited upon the plaintiff’s members by the defendant. In other\nwords, none of the harm that the plaintiff allegedly suffered as a result of the defendant’s conduct is\ndirect.” (Emphasis in original.) Id., 479. As the defendants in the present case correctly note, the injuries\nasserted in this case are one step further removed; any injuries would affect the inmates, not the CCDLA\nor its members. For this reason as well, the CCDLA does not have associational standing.\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 3 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-2   Filed 05/01/20   Page 11 of 16\n2. Third Party Standing of the CCDLA\nThe court must next address whether the plaintiffs’ allegations support the plaintiffs’ argument that the\nCCDLA has third party standing to assert claims on behalf of third party inmates. The defendants assert\nthat the CCDLA cannot assert third party standing on behalf of inmates because the three requirements\nfor such standing are not satisfied in the present case. Specifically, they argue that the complaint sets\nforth no allegation of an injury suffered by the CCDLA or its members, that the CCDLA’s relationship\nwith the third party inmates is not sufficiently close, and that there is no hindrance to the third parties’\nability to protect their own interests.\nThe plaintiffs counter that the CCDLA satisfies the requirements for third party standing, specifically\nthat the CCDLA’s relationship with third party inmates is sufficiently close and that there is a hindrance\nto the third party inmates’ ability to protect their own interests. The plaintiffs do not directly address the\ndefendants’ argument that the CCDLA fails to allege an injury to itself for purposes of third party\nstanding, but contend that members of the public may bring mandamus actions to enforce a public right\npursuant to Practice Book § 23-45 (a) FN5 without the need to demonstrate any interest in the outcome\nof the matter. Moreover, they maintain, the CCDLA is in a better position to represent the interests of its\nmembers’ clients than the individual inmates themselves because of the limited resources available to\nthe courts to review the petitions of numerous individual inmates seeking to obtain release due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nThe United States Supreme Court has “recognized the right of litigants to bring actions on behalf of\nthird parties, provided three important criteria are satisfied: The litigant must have suffered an ‘injury in\nfact,’ thus giving him or her a ‘sufficiently concrete interest’ in the outcome of the issue in dispute . . .\nthe litigant must have a close relation to the third party . . . and there must exist some hindrance to the\nthird party’s ability to protect his or her own interests.” (Citations omitted.) Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S.\n400, 410–11, 111 S. Ct. 1364, 113 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1991); see also State v. Bradley, 195 Conn. App. 36,\n51, 223 A.3d 62 (2019) (listing “injury” as one of three requirements that must be satisfied in order to\nbring actions on behalf of third parties), cert. granted on other grounds, 334 Conn. 925, 223 A.3d 379\n(2020).\nAs discussed elsewhere in this decision with regard to associational standing, the plaintiffs have not\nalleged any injury to the CCDLA or its members. As such an injury is required in order to bring a claim\non behalf of third parties, the plaintiffs’ claim of third party standing as to the CCDLA fails. Moreover,\nthe plaintiffs’ contention that such an injury or direct interest is not required where a plaintiff brings a\nmandamus action to enforce a public right is unpersuasive. Practice Book § 23-45 (a) provides: “An\naction of mandamus may be brought in an individual right by any person who claims entitlement to that\nremedy to enforce a private duty owed to that person, or by any state’s attorney to enforce a public\nduty.” (Emphasis added.) The CCDLA is alleged to be an association of criminal defense attorneys, not\nstate’s attorneys. The one Connecticut case cited by the plaintiffs in support of their position, State ex\nrel. E. Color Printing Co. v. Jenks, 150 Conn. 444, 190 A.2d 591 (1963), was brought by a state’s\nattorney and is therefore inapposite. Although it is therefore not necessary to address the other\nrequirements of third party standing, the court further notes that the plaintiffs’ contention that it meets\nthe third requirement, that the third parties must be hindered in protecting their own rights, is belied by\nthe fact that the individual plaintiffs in this action are members of the group whose interests the CCDLA\nseeks to protect. For all of these reasons, the CCDLA lacks standing to assert claims on behalf of third\nparties in this action. Accordingly, the motion is granted and the action is dismissed with regard to the\nCCDLA.\n2. Standing: Individual Plaintiffs\nThe court next turns to the issue of whether the individual plaintiffs have standing to maintain this\naction. The defendants argue that the individual plaintiffs lack standing because they have not alleged\nany injury as they do not have any right to be released before the end of their sentences. They maintain\nthat the individual plaintiffs have no statutory right to early release and that the statutes providing for\nearly release provide discretion to the executive officials charged with carrying out their provisions. In\nsupport, they further argue that the eighth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution\ndo not provide a remedy for the individual plaintiffs because they do not provide for early release; rather,\nthey relate to deliberate indifference to health and safety and the provision of medical care. They further\nmaintain that the risk of harm posed by the individual plaintiffs remaining incarcerated is too speculative\nto support the plaintiffs’ claims. Finally, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs’ failure to allege that the\ndefendants have the requisite level of mental culpability for purposes of a deliberate indifference claim\ndeprives them of standing.\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 4 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-2   Filed 05/01/20   Page 12 of 16\nIn opposition, the plaintiffs counter that the defendants’ knowledge of the dangers of COVID-19, and the\ndefendants’ failure to take appropriate measures to prevent its spread in their facilities, amount to an\neighth and fourteenth amendment violation because the individual plaintiffs’ conditions of confinement\nare likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering. They argue that they have alleged the\ndefendants’ deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs’ exposure to COVID-19 by their failure to take\nadequate steps to prevent exposure to the virus. Moreover, the plaintiffs maintain, their allegations\npertaining to the defendants’ mental state are adequate because they need only to have alleged that the\ndefendants acted “recklessly” with regard to the safety of the individual plaintiffs who have been\nsentenced and that the defendants knew or should have known of the excessive risk to health or safety\nwith regard to the individual plaintiffs who have not yet been sentenced. The plaintiffs further argue that\nclaims of deliberate indifference do not require the plaintiffs already to have been exposed to the risk of\ninfection. They maintain that the complaint adequately alleges that people incarcerated in DOC facilities\nare held in conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm. Finally, the plaintiffs argue that their\ninjuries are redressible by this court without regard to whether a particular statute or administrative\nscheme establishes a remedy to address the risks posed by the COVID-19 crisis and that, even if the\ncourt were limited only to the remedies already provided by the executive and legislative branches, the\ndefendants already have the authority “to alter every existing textual form of relief such that their\nfeigned helplessness divests them of a defense.” Essentially, the plaintiffs argue that the court has broad\ndiscretion to structure appropriate relief in this mandamus action such that the plaintiffs have injuries\nthat are redressible in this action.\nAs a threshold matter, the court rejects the defendants’ argument that the issue of whether the individual\nplaintiffs have a right to be released from custody is dispositive of the issue of whether they have\nstanding to maintain this action. Although the defendants have cited federal case law stating that “if the\nplaintiff’s claim has no foundation in law, he has no legally protected interest and thus no standing to\nsue”; Claybrook v. Slater, 111 F.3d 904, 907 (D.C. Cir. 1997); research reveals no appellate authority in\nConnecticut applying the concept of standing that broadly. To the contrary, our Supreme Court has\nconsistently retained a distinction between standing and the plaintiff’s “legal interests.” “The\nfundamental aspect of [statutory] standing . . . [is that] it focuses on the party seeking to get his\ncomplaint before [the] court and not on the issues he wishes to have adjudicated. . . . When standing is\nput in issue, the question is whether the person whose standing is challenged is a proper party to request\nan adjudication of the issue and not whether the controversy is otherwise justiciable, or whether, on the\nmerits, the plaintiff has a legally protected interest that the defendant’s action has invaded. . . . The\nconcepts of standing and legal interest are to be distinguished. The legal interest test goes to the merits,\nwhereas standing concerns the question whether the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is\narguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional\nguarantee in question.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Lazar v. Ganim, 334 Conn. 73, 85–86, 220\nA.3d 18 (2019), quoting Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, Inc. v. Gill, 175 Conn. 483, 491–92, 400 A.2d\n726 (1978). Accordingly, the court will not grant the defendants’ motion on ground that the plaintiffs\nhave no injury simply because they have no right to be released from custody. Nevertheless, the court\nmust consider whether the plaintiffs otherwise have failed to allege an injury as a result of the\ndefendants’ handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n“An allegation of injury is both fundamental and essential to a demonstration of standing. Under\nConnecticut law, standing requires no more than a colorable claim of injury; a plaintiff ordinarily\nestablishes his standing by allegations of injury. . . . As long as there is some direct injury for which the\nplaintiff seeks redress, the injury that is alleged need not be great. . . . Furthermore, an allegation of\ninjury is a prerequisite under federal law to the maintenance of an action under § 1983. See, e.g.,\nColombo v. O’Connell, 310 F.3d 115, 117 (2d Cir. 2002) (‘[t]o state a claim under [§] 1983, a plaintiff\nmust allege facts indicating that some official action has caused the plaintiff to be deprived of his or her\nconstitutional rights—in other words, there is an injury requirement to state the claim’), cert. denied, 538\nU.S. 961, 123 S. Ct. 1750, 155 L. Ed.2d 512 (2003); Ciambriello v. County of Nassau, 292 F.3d 307,\n323 (2d Cir. 2002) (‘[i]n order to state a claim under § 1983, a plaintiff must allege that he was injured\nby either a state actor or a private party acting under color of state law’).” (Emphasis in original;\nfootnotes omitted.) Johnson v. Rell, supra, 119 Conn. App. 735–38.\n“The eighth amendment, which applies to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth\namendment to the United States constitution . . . prohibits detention in a manner that constitutes cruel\nand unusual punishment. . . . Cruel and unusual punishment refers to punishment that involves the\nunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain or is grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime. . . .\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 5 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-2   Filed 05/01/20   Page 13 of 16\nUnder the eighth amendment, prison officials must ensure that inmates receive adequate food, clothing,\nshelter, and medical care, and must take reasonable measures to guarantee the safety of the inmates . . .\n.” (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Fuller v. Commissioner of Correction, 75 Conn.\nApp. 133, 136, 815 A.2d 208 (2003).\n“In challenging the conditions of confinement, the prisoner must meet two requirements. First, the\nalleged deprivation of adequate conditions must be objectively, sufficiently serious . . . such that the\npetitioner was denied ‘the minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities . . . .’ . . . Wilson v. Seiter, 501\nU.S. 294, 298, 111 S. Ct. 2321, 115 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1991). Second, the official involved must have had a\nsufficiently culpable state of mind described as ‘deliberate indifference’ to inmate health or safety.\nFarmer v. Brennan, [511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994)]. In that context,\nsubjective deliberate indifference means that ‘a prison official cannot be found liable under the [e]ighth\n[a]mendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official knows of and\ndisregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety . . . .’ Id., 837. (Citations omitted; internal\nquotation marks omitted.) Fuller v. Commissioner of Correction, supra, 75 Conn. App. 136–37.\nIn the present case, the plaintiffs have not alleged facts satisfying these two requirements. First, the\nplaintiffs have not alleged facts showing that the defendants have deprived the plaintiffs of the minimal\ncivilized measure of life’s necessities by failing to release a sufficient number of prisoners from\nconfinement in order to mitigate the risk of the spread of infection. Although Helling v. McKinney, 509\nU.S. 25, 113 S. Ct. 2475, 125 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1993), supports the plaintiffs’ position that exposure to\nfuture harm can present an eighth amendment violation, the facts of that case are distinguishable from\nthose alleged in the present case. In Helling, the United States Supreme Court held that the plaintiff in\nthat case stated a cause of action under the eighth amendment by alleging that prison officials “have,\nwith deliberate indifference, exposed [the plaintiff inmate] to levels of [environmental tobacco smoke]\nthat pose an unreasonable risk of serious damage to his future health.” Id., 35. Although the court held\nthat the fact that the plaintiff had not yet suffered any adverse health consequences from his exposure to\nsmoke was not fatal to his claim, the plaintiff had asserted that he was presently and directly exposed to\nthe dangerous condition, in that he was presently being exposed to smoke by being forced to share a cell\nwith another prisoner who was smoking five packs of cigarettes per day. Id., 28. In the present case, the\nplaintiffs have not alleged analogous facts. For example, the plaintiffs do not allege that any of them are\nhoused with or otherwise directly exposed to individuals with COVID-19. Rather, they allege that the\npreventative steps that the defendants have taken have not been and will not be adequate to address the\npandemic because the plaintiffs will be subjected to a heightened risk of exposure to the coronavirus in\nthe future as a result of inadequate steps taken to mitigate the risks.\nEven assuming, arguendo, that the conditions to which the plaintiffs are being or will be exposed do rise\nto the level of a “serious risk to health or safety,” the plaintiffs have not alleged facts to satisfy the\nsecond requirement, that is, to show that the defendants have acted or will act with “deliberate\nindifference” to the risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. To the contrary, the plaintiffs describe the\ndefendants’ conduct in the amended complaint as “commendable, but unfortunately insufficient to\ncomply with their constitutional and statutory obligation to ensure the safety of those in their custody.”\n(Amended complaint, entry #114, ¶ 92.) Allegations that the defendants’ actions have been or will be\n“insufficient” do not rise to the level of a conscious disregard of an excessive risk to inmate health or\nsafety.\n“The second requirement follows from the principle that only the unnecessary and wanton infliction of\npain implicates the Eighth Amendment. . . . To violate the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, a\nprison official must have a sufficiently culpable state of mind. . . . In prison-conditions cases that state of\nmind is one of ‘deliberate indifference’ to inmate health or safety . . . .” (Citations omitted; internal\nquotation marks omitted.) Farmer v. Brennan, supra, 511 U.S. 834. The United States Supreme Court\nhas explained that “deliberate indifference describes a state of mind more blameworthy than\nnegligence.” Id., 835. It further explained that this standard “requires more than ordinary lack of due\ncare for the prisoner’s interests or safety.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. “It is, indeed, fair to\nsay that acting or failing to act with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to a\nprisoner is the equivalent of recklessly disregarding that risk.” Id., 836. In further clarifying what is\nmeant by “recklessly” in this context, the court in Farmer explained that “a prison official cannot be\nfound liable under the Eighth Amendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement\nunless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must\nboth be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm\nexists, and he must also draw the inference.” (Emphasis added.) Id., 837. “The Eighth Amendment does\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 6 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-2   Filed 05/01/20   Page 14 of 16\nnot outlaw cruel and unusual ‘conditions’; it outlaws cruel and unusual ‘punishments.’ An act or\nomission unaccompanied by knowledge of a significant risk of harm might well be something society\nwishes to discourage, and if harm does result society might well wish to assure compensation. The\ncommon law reflects such concerns when it imposes tort liability on a purely objective basis. . . . But an\nofficial’s failure to alleviate a significant risk that he should have perceived but did not, while no cause\nfor commendation, cannot under our cases be condemned as the infliction of punishment.” (Citations\nomitted.) Id., 837–38.\nIn the present case, the plaintiffs have not alleged facts demonstrating that the defendants had or have the\nrequisite mental state with respect to the risks identified in the complaint. Although the allegations in the\namended complaint do demonstrate that the defendants are aware of the seriousness of the risks posed\nby COVID-19 generally, the complaint does not allege facts demonstrating that the defendants are acting\nwith deliberate indifference with regard to those risks. Rather, the plaintiffs assert in their amended\ncomplaint that the defendants, in failing to release prisoners from confinement to reduce prison\npopulation density, have not done enough to protect inmates from the risk of infection. As the defendants\ncorrectly assert, these allegations sound in negligence, not recklessness. Our Supreme Court has\n“described recklessness as a state of consciousness with reference to the consequences of one’s acts. . . .\nIt is more than negligence, more than gross negligence. . . . The state of mind amounting to recklessness\nmay be inferred from conduct. But, in order to infer it, there must be something more than a failure to\nexercise a reasonable degree of watchfulness to avoid danger to others or to take reasonable precautions\nto avoid injury to them. . . . Wanton misconduct is reckless misconduct. . . . It is such conduct as\nindicates a reckless disregard of the just rights or safety of others or of the consequences of the action.”\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.) Matthiessen v. Vanech, 266 Conn. 822, 832–33, 836 A.2d 394\n(2003). As the allegations in the amended complaint do not sound in recklessness, the plaintiffs have\nfailed to allege an eighth amendment injury and, accordingly, the individual plaintiffs lack standing to\nmaintain this action.\nB\nPolitical Question Doctrine\nAlthough it is not necessary to reach the other grounds asserted in the defendants’ motion, as the court\nhas already determined that none of the plaintiffs have standing to maintain this action and it must,\ntherefore, be dismissed, the court will address the political question doctrine as an alternative basis for\nits decision. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs’ action presents nonjusticiable political questions\nand must be dismissed because the plaintiffs’ requests for relief in this mandamus action seek to impose\nthe judgment of the court in place of the discretion vested in coordinate branches of government. In\nessence, they contend that by seeking mandamus relief that would limit or override the discretion\notherwise vested in the legislative and executive branches of government, the plaintiffs’ action presents\nnonjusticiable political questions. The plaintiffs counter that the plaintiffs’ claims do not involve\npolitical questions because the court has the power to provide mandamus relief from reckless exposure\nto illness or death as a result of the spread of COVID-19 in their facilities. They maintain that enforcing\nthe protections of the United States constitution against cruel and unusual punishment is within this\ncourt’s authority. They argue that the defendants’ duty to safeguard the health and wellbeing of the\ninmates in custody are not discretionary. In response, the defendants further argue that the question of\nhow any violations of the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights would be rectified should be left to the\ndiscretion of the legislative and executive branches. They maintain that because the plaintiffs seek relief\nthat calls for the exercise of discretion by executive branch officials, and seeks no alternative relief such\nas a declaratory judgment that the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights are being violated, this case presents\nnonjusticiable political questions and must be dismissed.\n“The political question doctrine itself is based on the principle of separation of powers . . . as well as the\nnotion that the judiciary should not involve itself in matters that have been committed to the executive\nand legislative branches of government. . . . [I]n considering whether a particular subject matter presents\na nonjusticiable political question, we have articulated [six] relevant factors, including: a textually\ndemonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of\njudicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding\nwithout an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of\na court’s undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate\nbranches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already\nmade; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments\non one question. Unless one of these formulations is inextricable from the case at bar, there should be no\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 7 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-2   Filed 05/01/20   Page 15 of 16\ndismissal for nonjusticiability on the ground of a political question’s presence.” (Citations omitted;\ninternal quotation marks omitted.) Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc. v. Rell,\n295 Conn. 240, 255-56, 990 A.2d 206 (2010).\nApplying these factors to the present case, the plaintiffs’ claims involve nonjusticiable political questions\nand should be dismissed for that reason as well. The plaintiffs seek mandamus relief compelling the\ndefendants to release inmates with heightened risk factors for COVID-19 to “to an appropriate medical\nfacility where necessary”; “immediately and meaningfully reduce the population density at each and\nevery facility in which they confine people” by taking specific steps specified by the plaintiffs in their\ncomplaint; and to “submit for the Court’s review and ongoing monitoring a plan” regarding certain\naspects of the defendants’ efforts to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, providing medical care to\ninmates, approval of residences for qualified inmates, and to sufficiently fund transitional housing for the\nduration of the pandemic; and to undertake other necessary tasks. If the court were to compel the\ndefendants to take these actions, such an order would necessarily be made without “judicially\ndiscoverable and manageable standards”; would not be possible “without an initial policy determination\nof a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion”; would not be possible “without expressing lack of the\nrespect due coordinate branches of government . . . .” See Id.\nAs the defendants correctly note, the statutes governing release and transfer of inmates in DOC custody\nprovide discretion to the executive branch officials with regard to the transfer or release of inmates. For\nexample, General Statutes § 18-100 (e) provides in relevant part that “the commissioner may transfer\nany person from one correctional institution to another or to any public or private nonprofit halfway\nhouse, group home or mental health facility or, after satisfactory participation in a residential program,\nto any approved community or private residence. . . .” (Emphasis added.) Similarly, General Statutes §\n18-100c provides that an inmates with a sentence of two years or less “may be released pursuant to\nsubsection (e) of section 18-100 or to any other community correction program approved by the\nCommissioner of Correction.” (Emphasis added.) General Statutes § 18-52a (a) provides in relevant\npart: “Any person committed to the custody of the Commissioner of Correction who is confined in a\ncorrectional facility and requires hospitalization for medical care may be transferred by the department\nto any hospital having facilities for such care. . . .” (Emphasis added.) These statutes necessarily entail\nthe use of discretion and judgment by the department of correction in determining whether to release or\ntransfer an inmate. Accordingly, application of the above factors indicates that the action should be\ndismissed based on the political question doctrine.\nBy contrast, in Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc., the court determined that\nthe plaintiffs’ claims in that case did not present a nonjusticiable political question. In reaching its\nconclusion, the court summarized the reasoning set forth in an earlier decision, Seymour v. Region One\nBoard of Education, 261 Conn. 475, 482–84, 803 A.2d 318 (2002). In both cases, the court relied, in\npart, on the forms of relief sought by the plaintiffs in determining that the case did not present a\nnonjusticiable political question. Specifically, it noted: “If we were to construe the complaint as\nrequesting only that a court, having determined that the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims are meritorious,\norder the [school] district to establish itself as a taxing district, and set the taxing powers and standards\nsuggested by the plaintiffs, we would have grave doubts about the justiciability of the claim, as the\ndefendant suggests. In that case, it is very likely that the claim would fall within one or more of the\ncategories of nonjusticiability.” Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc. v. Rell,\nsupra, 295 Conn. 261. The court further explained: “Although the plaintiffs do seek, in part, such an\norder from the court, and although the text of the complaint presents such a remedy as the only way to\nvindicate the plaintiffs’ rights, a separate prayer for relief is simply ‘[t]hat judgment be entered declaring\nthat . . . [General Statutes] § 10–51 (b) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied by [the board].’” Id.\nIt further explained: “This latter prayer for relief is susceptible of an interpretation that would leave the\nformulation of the appropriate remedy to the legislative branch, rather than requiring the judicial branch\nto entangle itself in what probably would be the nonjudicial function of establishing a taxing district.\nFurthermore, there is precedent for this court, having determined that a particular legislative scheme is\nunconstitutional, to leave the remedy to the legislative branch, at least initially. . . . We, therefore,\nconsider the question of justiciability on the premise that the plaintiffs seek a declaration of the\nunconstitutionality of § 10–51 (b), with the remedy that they propose to be considered by the legislative\nbranch.” Id., 261-62.\nApplying this reasoning to the present action yields a different result. In the present case, the plaintiffs’\nprayers for relief leave no room for an interpretation that the plaintiffs seek a mere declaration as to the\nconstitutionality of the defendants’ actions with respect to the COVID-19 crisis. Although the plaintiffs’\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 8 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-2   Filed 05/01/20   Page 16 of 16\nclaims would depend, in part, on a determination that the individual plaintiffs’ constitutional rights are\nbeing violated, the plaintiffs do not seek declaratory relief. They ask that the court order mandamus\nrelief, specifically the release and relocation of inmates and the reduction in prison populations.\nMoreover, the nature of the action itself, mandamus, demonstrates that the nature of relief sought in this\naction is to compel specific actions on the part of the defendants, actions that are governed by statutes\ngranting the defendants discretion with regard to how to carry out their responsibilities. Accordingly, this\naction presents nonjusticiable political questions and must be dismissed.\nC\nSovereign Immunity\nWith regard to the defendants’ sovereign immunity argument, the motion will not be granted on that\nbasis. “The Supreme Court . . . has taught that sovereign immunity is not invoked simply because\nprospective injunctive relief ultimately results in a diminution of state funds.” In re Dairy Mart\nConvenience Stores, Inc., 411 F.3d 367, 375 (2d Cir. 2005), citing Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651,\n668, 94 S. Ct. 1347, 39 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1974) (although state officials, “in order to shape their official\nconduct to the mandate of the Court’s decrees, would more likely have to spend money from the state\ntreasury than if they had been left free to pursue their previous course of conduct” such “an ancillary\neffect on the state treasury is a permissible and often an inevitable consequence of the principle” that\nprospective injunctive relief is not barred by the eleventh amendment to the United States constitution).\nAs the plaintiffs correctly assert, therefore, sovereign immunity does not bar the present action.\nAccordingly, the motion is not granted on sovereign immunity grounds. Nevertheless, for the reasons\ndiscussed elsewhere in this decision, the court nevertheless lacks subject matter jurisdiction, which\nrequires that the motion be granted.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the defendants’ motion to dismiss is hereby granted.\nFootnotes\n1 As noted elsewhere in this decision, Kerri Dirgo and Joshua Wilcox were added as plaintiffs on April\n8, 2020. Accordingly, references to the “individual defendants” refer to them as well.\n2 On April 8, 2020, the plaintiffs also filed a supplemental motion for temporary order of mandamus to\nconform to the amended complaint that was filed on that date.\n3 On April 7, 2020, the defendants also filed an objection to the motion for temporary order of\nmandamus, with several exhibits.\n4 On April 8, 2020, this court, Bellis, J., issued an order stating in relevant part: “By agreement of the\nparties, and with the court’s permission, Kerri Dirgo and Joshua Wilcox are added as party plaintiffs,\nAmended Complaint entry #114 filed on today’s date is the operative complaint, and Motion to Dismiss\nentry #112 is directed to said Amended Complaint.”\n5 Practice Book § 23-45 (a) provides: “An action of mandamus may be brought in an individual right by\nany person who claims entitlement to that remedy to enforce a private duty owed to that person, or by\nany state’s attorney to enforce a public duty.” (Emphasis added).\n421277\nJudge: BARBARA N BELLIS\nThis document may be signed or verified electronically and has the same validity and status as a document with a physical\n(pen-to-paper) signature.

Commissioner of Correction \n--------\nr--\nThis court concluded as a matter of law that M rendered ineffective \nassistance in having failed to advise the petitioner adequately concerning \nthe trial court's plea offer. This court also d_etermined that because M \nhad rendered ineffective assistance, it did not need to consider whether \nN had rendered deficient perfo!Illance in failing to pursue a claim of \nineffective assistance against M.

No. 20-cv-534 \n  May 20, 2020 \nNed Lamont, et al.,   \nDefendants-Respondents. \n \nPlaintiff-Petitioners’ Reply in Further Support of \nTheir Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n \n  The proposed plaintiff classes in this action seek preliminary relief from the rampant \nCOVID-19 infections plaguing their places of confinement in the defendants’ prisons and jails.  \nThey seek an injunction providing them with the three elements comprising what medical science \nhas identified as the only extant ‘treatment’ for this virus: prevention.  Those three elements are \nsanitation (in the form of increased cleaning, laundry, and sanitization); medical care (in the form \nof universal testing, and medical treatment in non-punitive conditions); and the social distancing \nthat the defendants have admitted is vital to warding off infection. \n  The defendants oppose preliminary relief [ECF No. 59], focusing on the possibility that \nchanging the place of confinement for the medically vulnerable class members to accomplish the \ndistancing that their prison buildings cannot will unleash a parade of woes.  Their myopia translates \npoorly  into  reasons  to  ignore  the  rampant  suffering  in  the  defendants’  facilities,  and  their \nopposition fails to counter the urgent necessity for the moderate measures of sanitation, medical \ncare, and distancing. \n \n \n \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 66   Filed 05/20/20   Page 2 of 8\nA.  COVID Infection Poses a Serious Risk of Harm to Human Health Sufficient to \nEstablish Irreparable Harm \n \n  Rather than concede that the avoidance of COVID-19 infection has reordered human \nexistence worldwide in recognition of its danger, Defendants Cook and Lamont contend in their \nopposition that their prisons are somehow different.  In Connecticut prisons, they argue, COVID-\n19 is no cause for alarm because it has ‘only’ killed one percent of the prisoners in their custody \ninfected with the pathogen, and hence, the plaintiff-petitioners “cannot show a substantial risk of \nserious harm in the form of death or serious illness.”  Defs.’ Opp. at 17.  This is grotesque and \nmisguided. \n  First, incarcerated people need not die in order to have valid claims to protection against \nCOVID-19.  “[S]erious injury is unequivocally not a necessary element of an Eighth Amendment \nclaim.”  Willey v. Kirkpatrick, 801 F.3d 51, 68 (2d Cir. 2015).  The question, instead, is whether \nthe risk of a COVID infection is “one that today’s society chooses to tolerate.”  Helling v. \nMcKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 36 (1993).  Owing to society having largely shut down on account of \nCOVID-19, the answer is obvious to all but the defendants here: whatever the frequency, the \nmonumental impact of serious COVID-19 infections1 means the disease is one that humanity has \nfor the past three months placed an unparalleled premium on avoiding.  \nA historical comparison underscores the untenability of their position: the polio virus \ncauses an asymptomatic infection in just under three-quarters of the humans to whom it spreads, \nmild flu-like symptoms in twenty-five percent, and paralysis in just one-half of one percent.2   \nNonetheless, humanity has universally recognized the pathogen as highly dangerous and \n \n1 Death is not the only thing the plaintiffs seek to avoid.  COVID can cause long-lasting damage, including \n“permanent loss of respiratory capacity, . . . inflammation of the heart muscle . . .[,] permanent injury to the \nkidneys . . . and neurologic injury.”  Declaration of Dr. Jonathan Golob [ECF No. 1-1] ¶ 9. \n2 U.S. Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, What is Polio?, https://www.cdc.gov/polio/what-is-polio \n(last visited May 18, 2020). \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 66   Filed 05/20/20   Page 3 of 8\ncelebrated its widespread eradication.  And any prison official or governor would be held \nunconstitutionally indifferent for arguing that they could fail to protect people in their custody \nfrom the polio virus because of its low overall incidence of paralysis.  \nSecond, the defendants present no factual basis upon which the Court could conclude that \nCOVID-19’s dangers do not equally obtain to incarcerated people.  The defendants have \nadmitted “that COVID-19 is a respiratory disease affecting human beings.”  Defs.’ Responses to \nPl.’s First Requests to Admit # 1 (attached as Exhibit 1).  And they admit “that a COVID-19 \ninfection may result in serious illness or death.”  Defs.’ Responses to Plaintiffs’ First Requests to \nAdmit # 3.  Defendant Lamont has concluded that the disease “spreads easily from person to \nperson,” e.g., Gov. Lamont Exec. Order No. 7 (Mar. 12, 2020), and the defendants both concede \nthat “there is an increased risk of rapid spread of COVID-19 among persons living in congregate \nsettings.”  Defs.’ Responses to Plaintiffs’ First Requests to Admit # 6.  On the basis of such facts, \nDefendant Lamont has temporarily shut down most of Connecticut’s economy and almost all of \nits government.  Without the defendants providing any facts demonstrating that the risk to \nConnecticut’s people in general does not pertain to its prisoners in specific, the Court should \nconclude that COVID-19’s serious risk equally threatens the plaintiff-petitioners with irreparable \nharm. \n  Lastly, the defendants’ phrasing of their duty as nothing more than a comparison between \nthe foregone chance of infection on the outside and in prison fails to advance their position.  The \nconstitutional floor exists to prevent the unreasonable risk of harm, e.g., Smith v. Carpenter, 316 \nF.3d 178, 188 (2d Cir. 2003), and not to permit prison officials to shrug and conclude that the \nrisk is diminished because either some people have it worse, or the threatened harm is difficult to \navert. \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 66   Filed 05/20/20   Page 4 of 8\nB.  Defendants  fail  to  provide  any  arguments  regarding  Plaintiffs’  conditions  of \nconfinement  claims  and  misrepresent  Plaintiffs’  claims  of  inadequate  medical \ntreatment.  \n \nDefendants’ Opposition focuses solely on Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment claims based \non  delayed  medical  care,  disregarding  case  law  supporting  Plaintiffs’  claims  against \nunconstitutional conditions of confinement stemming from Helling, which Defendants fail to cite \nentirely.  509 U.S. at 31. See also Darnell v. Pineiro, 849 F.3d 17, 29 (2d Cir. 2017) (finding that \n“a [pretrial] detainee’s rights are ‘at least as great as the Eighth Amendment protections available \nto a convicted prisoner.’” (quoting City of Revere v. Mass. Gen. Hosp., 463 U.S. 239, 244 (1983))).   \nThe plaintiffs’ claims are rare birds as conditions ones go, inasmuch as they identify severe \nconditions shortcomings that lead to rapid spread of a disease, and the remedies for which are \nprescribed by medical science.  The best medical evidence shows that the most effective treatment \nfor COVID-19 is to interrupt it in the first instance through proper sanitation, distancing, and \nmedical care such as universal viral testing.  See Wilson v. Williams, No. 20-cv-794, 2020 WL \n1940882, at *6 (N.D. Ohio Apr. 22, 2020) (acknowledging that COVID-19 conditions claims \n“evade[]  easy  classification”).    However,  no  matter  how  one  characterizes  the  conditions \ndeficiencies demonstrated by the plaintiffs, they do not comprise a contest of medical delays.  The \ndefendants’ concentration on medical delay case law is no surprise, given that the weight of \nauthority lies against them as to conditions leading to communicable pathogens.  The Second \nCircuit has repeatedly noted that “correctional officials have an affirmed obligation to protect \ninmates from infectious disease.”  Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 477 (2d Cir. 1996).  Similarly, \nthe Supreme Court has ruled that inmates were entitled to relief under the Eighth Amendment \nwhen they proved “threats to personal safety from . . . the mingling of inmates with serious \ncontagious diseases with other inmates.”  Helling, 509 U.S. at 34.  The Supreme Court found that \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 66   Filed 05/20/20   Page 5 of 8\nthe threat of “infectious maladies” was unconstitutional “even though the possible infection might \nnot affect all those exposed.”  Id. at 33.   \nFurther, courts around the country have repeatedly ruled that the threat of COVID-19 in \nprisons has resulted in unconstitutional conditions that present an unreasonable risk to inmates’ \nhealth.  See Ruderman v. Kolitwenzew, No. 20-cv-2082, 2020 WL 2449758, at *13 (C.D. Ill. May \n12, 2020); Frazier v. Kelley, No. 20-cv-00434, 2020 WL 2110896, at *6 (E.D. Ark. May 4, 2020) \n(“it cannot be disputed that COVID-19 poses an objectively serious health risk . . . given the nature \nof the disease and the congregate living environment of the [correctional] facilities.”); Awshana v. \nAdducci, No. 20-10699, 2020 WL 1808906, at *7 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 9, 2020) (“Objectively, the \nhealth risks posed by COVID-19 are abundantly clear.”).  None of those courts’ conclusions is \nsurprising, because unsanitary conditions (such as exposing inmates to a deadly disease), have \nbeen “long recognized” as cruel and unusual punishment.  Walker v. Schult, 717 F.3d 119, 127 (2d \nCir. 2013).  See also Wright v. McMann, 387 F.2d 519, 522, 526 (2d Cir. 1967) (reaching that \nconclusion where a prisoner was in a cell that “fetid and reeking from the stench of the bodily \nwastes of previous occupants”).   \nWorse, Defendants have failed to take necessary measures to abate this risk.  They \nmisrepresent  Plaintiffs’  injury  as  a  mere  preference  for  other  measures  to  be  taken.    But \nDefendants’ actions have not resulted in constitutional conditions.  Last week, this Court ruled that \nfailure to seriously consider and facilitate transfer of medically vulnerable prisoners constituted \ndeliberate indifference under the Eighth Amendment.  Martinez-Brooks v. Easter, No. 20-cv-\n00569, 2020 WL 2405350, at *20–22 (D. Conn. May 12, 2020).  Defendants are not immune from \ndeliberate indifference simply because they have taken some measures to stop the spread of the \nCOVID-19 virus.  Courts around the country have ruled that insufficient mitigation measures result \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 66   Filed 05/20/20   Page 6 of 8\nin deliberate indifference.3  Therefore, Defendants have been deliberately indifferent to the \nunconstitutional conditions of confinement that unconstitutionally, cruelly, and unusually punish \nboth  post-adjudication  and  pretrial  class  members  at  risk  under  the  Eighth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments. \n \nC.  Defendants are unconstitutionally punishing pretrial class members because they do \nnot have a “legitimate governmental purpose” for the conditions at DOC facilities.  \n \n  Lastly,  Defendants  contend  that  their  legitimate  governmental  purpose  for \nunconstitutionally punishing pretrial class members is public safety. However, this analysis is \nmisplaced.    First,  as  Defendants  note,  there  must  be  a  non-punitive  governmental  purpose \nrationally connected to a given condition, and the condition must be proportional to that purpose, \nnot an excessive means for accomplishing the purpose.”  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 538–59 \n(1979).  The government’s claim that pretrial Plaintiffs should not be released because of public \nsafety concerns has been deemed excessive under the particular circumstances and threat from \nCOVID-19  virus  in  many  other  courts.4    Second,  Defendants  fail  to  provide  a  legitimate \n \n3 See Valentine v. Collier, No. 20-cv-1115, 2020 WL 1916883, at *10 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 20, 2020) (finding \nthat “the risk of COVID-19 is obvious” and the Defendant facilities were deliberately indifferent because \nthe facilities were not complying with their implemented policies (e.g., placing inmates on lockdown, taking \ntemperatures twice per day, and providing inmates with new cloth masks daily and additional soap at no \ncost));  Swain v. Junior, No. 20-cv-21457, 2020 WL 2078580, at *16 (S.D. Fla Apr. 29, 2020) (finding \ndefendants’ preventative measures demonstrated deliberate indifference due to the “exponential rate of \ninfection since the case commenced.”); see also Wilson, 2020 WL 1940882, at *8 (finding respondents \nacted with deliberate indifference because they lacked sufficient equipment to test inmates properly and \nfailed to separate its inmates at least six feet apart). \n4 See Rodriguez Alcantara v. Archambeault, No. 20-cv-0756, 2020 WL 2315777, at *8–9 (S.D. Cal. May \n1, 2020) (noting that the governmental purpose of preventing danger to community could be achieved by \nless severe alternatives during a COVID-19 outbreak); Ruderman v. Kolitwenzew, No. 20-cv-2082, 2020 \nWL 2449758 (C.D. Ill. May 12, 2020) (finding that the government’s legitimate interest is greatly \ndiminished absent a showing that “he is a danger to the community or a flight risk” and considering the \ntotality  of  the  circumstances,  particularly  because  Petitioner  is  a  medically-vulnerable  detainee, \n“Petitioner’s detention appears excessive in relation to the Government’s legitimate nonpunitive purpose.”); \nFavi v. Kolitwenzew, No. 20-cv-2087, 2020 WL 2114566 (C.D. Ill. May 4, 2020); Thakker v. Doll, No. 20-\ncv-480, 2020 WL 1671563, at *8 (M.D. Pa.

And their silence on the subject is unsurprising, \nas there appears to be no legitimate government interest justifying the denial of mitigation \nmeasures that the classes seek here against a dangerous disease.  Lacking a showing that their \nfailures as to the pretrial plaintiffs is in service of any justifiable interest, the defendant-respondents \nmay not avoid preliminary relief being entered against them. \n \nD.  Conclusion \nFor the reasons set out in the plaintiff-petitioners’ motion for a preliminary injunction, the \nCourt should accord them immediate relief in the form of sanitation, proper medical care, and \ndistancing to avert even wider COVID infections than have already occurred. \n \nDated: May 20, 2020       \n   \n/s/ Will W.

Our \n3  concerns  have  been  resolved. \n4  THE  COURT:  Okay.  So  are  you  stipulated to  the \n5  finding  of  competency? \n6  ATTY.  ERWIN:  Yes.  Yes,  Your  Honor. \n7  THE  COURT:  Okay. \n8  ATTY.  BAER:  And  for  the  record,  Your  Honor, \n9  I've  had  the  opportunity  to  read  this  report,  also, \n10  dated  February  19,  2014,  by  the  Connecticut  Mental \n11  Health  Center,  which  documents  the  report  of  the  team \n12  of  evaluators  who  examined  Mr.  Young  pursuant  to  this \n13  Court's  order  and  have  concluded  that  he  is  competent \n14  on  Page  6  of  that  six-page  repoit. \n15  It was  defense  counsel's  motion.  The  state  has \n16  no  issue  with  the  conclusion  of  the  team. \n17  THE  COURT:  Okay.  Thank  you. \n18  Based  on  the  uncontroverted  evidence  presented \n19  and  the  written  report,  which  has  been  admitted  into \n20  evidence  as  a  full  exhibit  -- which  will  be  entered \n21  as  a  full  exhibit. \n22  THE  CLERK:  Yes. \n23  THE  COURT:  Thank  you  -- dated \n24  February  19,  2014,  it has  been  established by  a  fair \n25  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  the  defendant  is \n26  competent,  is  able  to  assist  in  his  own  defense,  or \n27  in  this  case,  for  the  sentencing,  and  is  able  to \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-7   Filed 07/07/20   Page 5 of 10\n1  Attorney  Erwin.  But  until  such  time  as  that's  the \n2  case,  then  I  oppose  the  dismissal. \n3  THE  COURT:  Okay.  Well,  I  don't  have  any \n4  authority  to  dismiss  or  not  dismiss  Attorney  Erwi~ \n5  because  he's  a  private  counsel,  and  it's really up  to \n6  the  defendant  to. \n7  I  understand  for  the  -- as  far  as  the \n8  proceedings  are  concerned;  yes.  It's best  for \n9  Mr.  Young  [sic]  to  stay  in. \n10  ATTY.  ERWIN:  If  I  could  suggest,  Your  Honor. \n11  Let  me  be  clear.  I  think  Mr.  Young  has  fired me \n12  privately  and  possibly  through  motions  he's  filed \n13  with  ·the  Court. \n14  THE  COURT:  Right. \n15  ATTY.  ERWIN:  I  believe  I  would  have  to  refresh \n16  my  memory  before  I  said  it with  one-hundred-percent \n17  confidence,  but  I  believe  that  that  requires  a \n18  mandatory  dismissal. \n19  Personally,  in  the  competency  evaluation,  he's \n20  expressed-no  confidence  in myself,  Attorney  Pattis, \n21  or  our  firm.  I  think  he's  also  expressed  a  desire  to \n22  go  pro  se. \n23  If  I'm mistaken,  the  Court  may  wish  to  canvass \n24  him  on  that  matter. \n25  THE  COURT:  Okay. \n26  ATTY.  ERWIN:  But  I  don't  think  that  my  being  in \n27  at  this  point  would  be  what's  required  under  the \n\n6 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-7   Filed 07/07/20   Page 6 of 10\n1  three  charges. \n2  THE  DEFENDANT:  But  I've been  convicted  without \n3  due  process  of  law,  Your  Honor. \n4  THE  COURT:  Well,  then  you  can  file  an  appeal  if \n5  that's  what  you  like,  sir;  but  as  far  as  we're \n6  concerned,  we're  going  to  go  forward  with  the \n7  sentencing.  Do  you  understand? \n8  THE  DEFENDANT:  Without  interrupting  you,  I  do \n9  have  a  pro  se  motion  to ~ismiss that  I  would  like  to \n10  argue  myse.~f. \n---.~ ,,, ·. \n11  support  of  my  actual  innocence  that  I'd like  to \n12  submit  to  the  Court. \n13  THE  COURT:  Sir,  I  sat  here  and  presided \n14  the  trial.  You  were  not  innocent.  The  jury  found \n15 \n16  interfering  with  a  police  officer.  You've  also  been \n17  convicted  of  committing  a  crime  while  on  pretrial \n18  release. \n19  THE  DEFENDANT:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  And  the \n20  assa~lt on  the  police  officer,  that  isn't  an  original \n21  charge;  and  that  charge  was  a~tually replaced  without \n22  substitute  information,  no  bill of  particulars. \n23  The  original  charge  was  creating  a  public \n24  disturbance. \n25  THE  COURT:  All  right,  sir.  You  can  file  an \n26  appeal  in  this  matter  if that  is  your  wish. \n27 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-7   Filed 07/07/20   Page 7 of 10\n1  not  familiar  with  the  evidence.  Attorney  Durham  is \n2  unavailable. \n3  THE  COURT:  No;  we're  not  going  to  argue  this \n4  today. \n5  ATTY.  BAER:  Thank  you. \n6  THE  COURT:  It's  just  -- so  today,  we're  just \n7  going  to  do  the  competency,  which  we  finished. \n8  So  I'm  going  to  give  you  four  more  weeks  before \n9  I  sentence  you. \n10  THE  DEFENDANT:  Your  Honor,  I  have  a  brief  that \n11  I  need  to  submit  to  the  Court. \n12  THE  COURT:  Okay.  You  can  file  it,  but  we're \n13  not  going  to  argue  that  today. \n14  THE  DEFENDANT:  But  I've  already  submitted  the \n15  motion,  the  pro  se  motjon  to  dismiss  post-conviction. \n16  THE  COURT:  All  right.  Well,  then  I'll rule  on \n17  that  next  time.  But  today,  I  can't  do  the  hearing \n18  because  we  don't  have  Attorney  Durham  here,  who  was \n19  the  prosecuting  attorney  for  your  trial. \n20  THE  DEFENDANT:  Okay.  So  now  I  can  submit  my \n21  brief  to  the  Court? \n22  THE  COURT:  Yes;  you  can  do  that.  I  mean,  if \n23  you  fired Attorney  Erwin  and  his  law  firm,  that's \n24  fine.  If you  want  to  go  forward  pro  se,  you  can \n25  certainly do  that. \n26  But  I'm  going  to  give  you  four  weeks  to  find  an \n27  attorney  a  replacement  attorney  for  yourself, \n\n.L\\.J \n·C-a~s-e~ 3-:-20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-7   Filed 07/07/20   Page 8 of 10\n1  to  work. \n2  THE  COURT:  Okay. \n3  ATTY.  BAER:  I  know  that  he's  starting  another \n4  trial,  but  four  weeks  out  might  --\n5  THE  COURT:  Okay. \n6  ATTY.  BAER:  -- might  be  adequate. \n7  THE  COURT:  March  20th  for  sentencing,  sir,  with \n8  or  without  an  attorney  for  yourself. \n9  ATTY.  BAER:  And  just  so  that  I'm  clear, \n10  Your  Honor,  Attorney  Erwin  is \n11  THE  COURT:  Yes. \n12  ATTY.  BAER:  -- has  been  relieved? \n13  THE  COURT:  Yes;  has  been  removed. \n14  ATTY.  ERWIN:  Thank  you,  Your  Honor. \n15  TBE  COURT:  All  right.  His  firm  has  been \n16  removed. \n17  ATTY.  ERWIN:  Thank  you.  I  don't  mean  to \n18  further  muddy  the  waters. \n19  THE  COURT:  Yes. \n20  ATTY.  ERWIN:  A  housekeeping  matter  that's \n21  relevant  to  sentencing  is  -- I  think  this  is  what \n22  Mr.  Young  was  referring  to.  I  have  his  file.  I \n23  think  he's  entitled to  it.  My  firm  has  to  do  a  purge \n- --\n--~----~-=~==~-=---\n24  first. \n25  We  have  what's  been  done  on  his  PSI  report.  In \n26  terms  of  preparing  him  for  sentencing,  his  further \n27  counsel,  I  know  he  would  like  to  have  this. \n\nJ_ L \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-7   Filed 07/07/20   Page 9 of 10\n1  THE  COURT:  And  you  know,  obviously,  sir,  if you \n2  hire  an  attorney,  you  need  to  have  that  counsel \n3  contact  Mr.  Erwin's  law  firm  so  he  could  get  the \n4  files. \n5  Do  you  understand,  sir? \n6  THE  DEFENDANT:  Um-hmm. \n7  THE  COURT:  Yes? \n8  THE  DEFENDANT:  Yes. \n9  THE  COURT:  Okay.  All  right. \n10  ATTY.  ERWIN:  Thank  you,  Your  Honor. \n11  THE  COURT:  Anything  else? \n12  ATTY.  BAER:  And  the  date,  Judge? \n13  THE  COURT:  March  20th. \n14  ATTY.  BAER:  Thank  you. \n15  THE  CIJERK:  Would  you  like  it at  ten  or  two, \n16  Your  Honor? \n17  THE  COURT:  What  day  is  that? \n18  ATTY.  BAER:  It's  a  Thursday. \n19  THE  COURT:  Thursday?  It'll have  to  be  in  the \n20  afternoon,  please. \n21  ATTY.  BAER:  2  p.m.? \n22  THE  COURT:  Yes. \n23  THE  DEFENDANT:  Your  Honor,  are  we  going  to \n24  address  my  motion  to  dismiss,  my  post-conviction \n25  motion  to  dismiss  at  that  time? \n26  THE  COURT:  Next  hearing,  sir,  we'll  do  that. \n27  THE  DEFENDANT:  Thank  you. \n\nCNaOs:e  3:T2l09-Rcv--C0R01513-40-0JB99A2  0 D6So cument 132-7   FSileOdP E0l7U/O0R7 /2C0O U  RPTa ge 10 of 10\nSTATE  OF  CONNECTICUT  GA  1119 \nv.

Thank  you. \n3  ATTY.  JOY:  Ready  to  begin  whenever  you  are, \n4  Your  Honor. \n5  THE  COURT:  Thank  you,  Attorney  Joy. \n6  I  believe  Mr.  Young  is  being  brought  out. \n7  Okay.  Would  the  parties  please  identify \n8  yourselves  for  the  record. \n9  ATTY.  DURHAM:  Reed  Durham  for  the  state, \n10  Your  Honor. \n11  ATTY.  JOY:  Attorney  Edward  Joy,  appointed \n12  counsel  for  Mr.  Young. \n13  THE  COURT:  Thank  you.  And  Mr.  Young  --\n14  ATTY.  JOY:  Mr.  Young  is  present  to my  left. \n15  THE  COURT:  Thank  you.  And  I  believe  he  had \n16  some  issues  with-- I  know  he's  walking  with  a  cane, \n17  so  I'm going  to  allow  him  to  sit through  the \n18  proceedings. \n19  ATTY.  JOY:  Thank  you  very much,  Your  Honor. \n20  THE  COURT:  All  right.  Okay.  This  is \n21  State  v  Young.  I  believe  there's  the  matter  of  the \n22  motion  for  a  new  trial which  we  need  to  take  up \n23  before  we  continue. \n24  ATTY.  JOY:  Yes.  Before  we  address  that, \n25  Your  Honor,  my  client  has  asked me  to  request  of  the \n26  Court  some  more  time  for  investigation  in  this \n27  matter. \n\nL \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-8   Filed 07/07/20   Page 5 of 26\n1  Of  course  you  know  I  did  not  sit  through  the \n2  trial.  I  was  not  present  through  any  of  the  evidence \n3  that  was  given  and  testimony.  And  he  would  like me \n4  to  have  a  better  opportunity  to  get  the  transcripts, \n5  review  them  to  address  properly  his  motion  for  a  new \n6  trial. \n7  THE  COURT:  That  motion  is  denied.  The \n8  transcripts  are  not  necessary  for  today's  sentencing. \n9  Certainly,  if he  wants  to  appeal  the  conviction,  he \n10  c.an  do  that .  He'll  have  opportunity  at  that  time  to \n11  review  transcripts. \n12  ATTY.  JOY:  Very  good.  As  for  the  motion  for  a \n13  new  trial,  Your  Honor,  I  did  discuss  with  my  client \n<::. \n14  what  we  discussed  in  chambers,  in  that  you  had  read \n15  both  the  motion  and  the  amendment  that  was  recently \n16  filed;  and  that  you  were  interested  if there  was  any \n17  new  information  to  be  added  to  that. \n18  I  did  ask my  client,  and  he  has  no  more \n19  information  to  add  to  that. \n20  THE  COURT:  Okay. \n21  ATTY.  JOY:  So  I  do  ask  you,  after  having \n22  reviewed  all  that,  that  you  would  grant  his  motion \n23  for  a  new  trial  in  this  matter. \n24  THE  COURT:  Okay.  Attorney  Durham. \n25  ATTY.  DURHAM:  Your  Honor,  the  state  would  rely \n26  on  its  response  to  the  original  motion  and  the \n27  comments  made  back  on  March  20th.  I  don't  see \n\n3 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-8   Filed 07/07/20   Page 6 of 26\n1  anything  in  the  first motion  for  a  new  trial  or  with \n2  the  addendum  that  rises  to  the  level  that  Mr.  Young \n3  did  not  get  a  fair  trial. \n4  THE  COURT:  Okay.  All  right.  As  Attorney  Joy \n5  stated,  the  Court  has  reviewed  both  the  first  motion \n6  and  the  accompanying  memorandum,  as  well  as  the \n7  amendment  for  a  new  trial. \n8  And  as  I  indicated  to  Mr.  Young  the  last  time  we \n9  were  here,  what  he's  trying  -- I  believe  he's  trying \n10  to  say  is  that  he  did  not  have  competent \n11  representation,  which  I  instructed him  that  that  is \n12  more  appropriate  for  a  habeas  petition. \n13  But  that  does  not-- there's  not  enough  in  the \n\\  14  motion  or  the  memorandum  that  would  indicate  +l--.!l-l',V~  \n15  Court  to  grant  a  new  trial  in  the  interest  of \n16  justice;  therefore,  the  motion  is  denied.  All  right. \n17  ATTY.  JOY:  Your  Honor,  my  client  tells me  that \n18  he  filed  a  motion  to  dismiss  the  case  back  in  -- I \n19  believe  it was  January.  And  he's  asking  if that  was \n20  ever  acted  upon. \n21  THE  COURT:  Motion  to  dismiss? \n22  ATTY.  JOY:  Yes. \n23  ATTY.  DURHAM:  Judge,  I  do  have  that.  It was  a \n24  post-conviction motion  to  dismiss,  I  think  filed  at \n25  the  same  time  the  other motions  were  filed,  including \n26  the  motion  to  dismiss  counsel.  And  I  don't  have  any \n27  marking  as  to  whether  that  was  acted  on. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Doc-u-m-e-n-t- 1-3-2---8-  - F--ile-d- -0-7-/0-7-/-2-0- -  -P-a-g-e- 7- -o-f -2-6------\n1  I  would  act  ask  the  Court  to  deny  the  motion. \n2  THE  COURT:  Attorney  Joy. \n3  ATTY.  JOY:  Thank  you,  Your  Honor.  I  have \n4  located  the  -- it was  dated  January  24th.  I  don't \n5  know  if the  Court  wishes  time  to  review  it yourself. \n6  THE  COURT:  I've  reviewed  everything  that \n7  Mr.  Young  has  previously  filed. \n8  ATTY.  JOY:  Okay.  Did  you  -- was  it acted  on, \n9  is  the  first  question. \n10  THE  COURT:  If  it's not  indicated,  then--\n11  Madam  Clerk,  was  there  any-- there's  no  decision  on \n12  the  motion  to  dismiss,  was  there? \n13  THE  CLERK:  That's  correct,  Your  Honor. \n14  THE  COURT:  Okay.  The  motion  is  denied.  Again, \n15  I  didn't  see  anything  in  there  that  would  warrant \n16  this  Court  to  dismiss  the  case. \n17  ATTY.  JOY:  Thank  you.  My  client  reserves  the \n18  right  to  appeal  these  motions,  Your  Honor. \n19  THE  COURT:  Absolutely.  That's  his  right. \n20  All  right.  Should  we  move  on  to  the  PSI? \n21  ATTY.  JOY:  One  second,  Your  Honor. \n22  THE  COURT:  Thank  you. \n23  ATTY.  JOY:  On  behalf  of  my  client,  Your  Honor, \n24  at  this  time,  he  asks  that  the  Court  not  refer  to  the \n25  PSI  as  part  of  the  sentencing. \n26  THE  COURT:  Why  is  that? \n27  ATTY.  JOY:  He  has  many  discrepancies  that  are \n\n5 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-8   Filed 07/07/20   Page 8 of 26\n1  here,  and  he  does  tell me,  although  the  PSI  was \n2  ordered  to  be  redone,  he  says  that  he  did  not  want \n3  the  PSI  to  be  redone;  and  I  just  learned  of  that  this \n4  morning. \n5  THE  COURT:  Attorney  Durham. \n6  ATTY.  JOY:  I  did  explain  that  it's like \n7  un-ringing  the  bell,  that  you've  already  seen  it. \n8  THE  COURT:  Right.  It's already  done.  I've \n9  read  it. \n10  ATTY.  DURHAM:  Judge,  I  really don't  take  a \n11  position.  If he  doesn't  want  the  Court  to  consider \n12  it \n13  THE  COURT:  Okay. \n14  ATTY.  DURHAM:  I'm  certainly  going  to  be \n15  referring  to  much  information  that's  in  that  report. \n16  THE  COURT:  Right. \n17  ATTY.  DURHAM:  That's  all  a  matter  of  public \n18  record. \n19  THE  COURT:  Right.  Attorney  Joy. \n20  ATTY.  JOY:  Then  if  I  could  point  out  a  couple \n21  of  things  that  my  client  says  are  incorrect  about  the \n22  PSI,  Your  Honor. \n23  THE  COURT:  Okay. \n24  ATTY.  JOY:  As  for  the  allegations  to  the \n25  current  offense,  he  does  state  that  those  are  all, \n26  obviously,  incorrect  as  he  does  not  take  any \n27  responsibility or  admit  that  anything  occurred  on \n\nb \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-8   Filed 07/07/20   Page 9 of 26\n1  that  date. \n2  THE  COURT:  Okay.  That's  not  going  to  be \n3  changed.  He's  been  convicted  of  those  charges,  so \n4  ATTY.  JOY:  Very  good.  He  also  takes  offense \n5  that  he  did  not  sign  -- he  said  he  did  not  sign  any \n6  releases  based  on  his  paranoia  about  Attorney  Pattis. \n7  His  reason  for  not  signing  any  releases  for  the \n8  PSI,  Your  Honor,  was  that  he  was  very  reticent  to \n9  sign  anything  because  of  a  stipulation  that  he  feels \n10  he  was  forced  into  signing  at  the  trial by \n11  Attorney  Pattis. \n12  THE  COURT:  Okay. \n13  ATTY.  JOY:  And  so  he  is  reluctant  to  sign  any \n14  releases. \n15  THE  COURT:  All  right.  Then  I  guess  it  is  what \n16  it  is.  I  don't  know  what  to  do  with  that,  but  is \n17  there  a  specific  location  in  the  PSI  that  he  is  --\n18  ATTY.  JOY:  Yeah.  It  comes  up  right  here  on \n19  Page  4,  at  the  top. \n20  THE  COURT:  Okay. \n21  ATTY.  JOY:  She  says  where  he  would  not  sign  any \n22  releases,  explaining  he  was  very  uncomfortable \n23  signing  anything  due  to  his  own  paranoia  -- that  is \n24  not  a  word  he  used  -- but  he  did  state  that  he  was \n25  distrustful  of  signing  anything  based  on  Norm  Pattis \n26  questioning  his  competency  and  asking  him  to  sign \n27  that  stipulation  about  missing  evidence. \n\n7 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-8   Filed 07/07/20   Page 10 of 26\n1  THE  COURT:  Well,  it says  he  would  not  sign  the \n2  release,  so  --\n3  ATTY.  JOY:  Correct. \n4  THE  COURT:  So  it is  what  it is. \n5  ATTY.  JOY:  Okay.  He  was  uncomfortable  signing \n6  anything  because  of  the  improper  stipulation. \n7  THE  COURT:  Okay.  Well,  it states  that,  so  I \n8  don't  think  that  needs  to  be  changed. \n9  ATTY.  JOY:  Very  good. \n10  THE.COURT:  All  right. \n11  ATTY.  JOY:  As  for  the  criminal  history  here,  he \n12  does  object  to  the  facts  that  are  stated there.  I \n13  did  explain  to  him  that  he  had  pled  guilty to  those \n!  14  cases,  and  he  tells me  on  several  of  those  case0r  he \n15  did  plead  under  the  Alford doctrine;  that  he  did  not \n16  agree  with  those  facts  as  stated. \n17  THE  COURT:  Okay.  That's  fine.  But  I  don't \n18  think  there's  anything  here  that  states  that  he \n19  agreed  to  these  facts;  that  these  were  just \n20  convictions. \n21  Whether  it's an  Alford-- a  guilty plea  under \n22  the  Alford doctrine  or  a  regular  guilty plea,  it \n23  really doesn't  matter  to  the  Court. \n24  ATTY.  JOY:  Very  good.  Nothing  further, \n25  Your  Honor. \n26  THE  COURT:  All  right.  Thank  you. \n27  ATTY.  DURHAM:  Judge,  from  the  state's \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-8   Filed 07/07/20   Page 11 of 26\n1  perspective,  the  only  inaccuracy  I  would  point  out  1s \n2  on  Page  3  during  the  factual  basis  of  the  current \n3  offense. \n4  THE  COURT:  Yes. \n5  ATTY.  DURHAM:  The  writer  has  included,  the \n6  male,  Robert  Picard,  stated there  was  an  issue \n7  between  he  and  Young  only;  and  that's  inaccurate. \n8  The  police  report  indicated  that  Mr.  Picard  told \n9  the  initial  responding  trooper  that  there  was  just  an \n10  issue  between  Jessica  Reed  and  Mr.  Young,  but  it was \n11  nothing  serious. \n12  THE  COURT:  Right. \n13  ATTY.  DURHAM:  And  that  that  would-- Reed's \n14  comment  that  followed  was  accurate. \n15  THE  COURT:  Okay.  So  then  do  you  wish  that  to \n16  be  corrected  on  the  PSI? \n17  ATTY.  DURHAM:  Just  noting  it  for  the  record, \n18  Your  Honor. \n19  THE  COURT:  Okay.  Attorney  Joy,  do  you  want  it \n20  corrected  in  there,  as  the  state  stated,  or  are  you \n21  fine  with  this?  It's  just-- it's going  to  be  on  the \n22  record. \n23  ATTY.  JOY:  I  think  it's  fine,  Your  Honor.  I \n24  don't  think  it's going  to  affect  much. \n25  THE  COURT:  All  right.  Thank  you. \n26  Did  the  police  officer  -- were  they  notified  of \n27  today's  sentencing? \n\n9 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-8   Filed 07/07/20   Page 12 of 26\n1  ATTY.  DURHAM:  Your  Honor,  I  know  Ms.  Kozicki \n2  attempted  to  contact  --\n3  THE  COURT:  Okay. \n4  ATTY.  DURHAM:  Trooper  Barrows.  He  is no \n5  longer  in  Connecticut.  He's  riow  with  the  state \n6  . police  ln  New  Jersey. \n7  THE  COURT:  Okay. \n8  ATTY.  DURHAM:  So \n9  THE  COURT:  That's  fine,  then.  Victim  notice \n10  has  been  attempted. \n11  I'll hear  from  the  state. \n12  ATTY.  DURHAM:  Thank  you,  Your  Honor. \n13  ARGUMENT  OF  ATTY.  DURHAM: \n14  Judge,  in  any  case  where  we're making  an  offer \n15  to  resolve  a  case  or  a  recommendation  at  sentencing,  I  t::ry \n16  to  take  into  account  what  the  crime  is,  how  serious  was  it \n17  in  nature,  both  generally  and  the  specific  circumstances, \n18  what  affect  it might  have  had  on  the  victim,  and  who  the \n19  defendant  is.  What  type  of  a  life have  they  led  coming  up \n20  to  that  point  in  time?  What  type  of  behavior  can  we  expect \n21  in  the  future? \n22  And  here,  we  have  a  very  serious  charge  of \n23  assault  on  a  police  officer  which  carries  a  ten-year \n24  sentence.  But  the  injury  here  was  almost  nonexistent.  It's \n25  an  issue  of  pain,  which  is  the  threshold  for  the.element  of \n2 6  the  s·tatute. \n27  But  we're  not  suggesting~~-.::la~~snything mace \n===-.....,.,~~-~,..,.,.,..,,_,.,-==\"~\"'\"\"\",...,..._,..·~.....,....,.,...,....-.-.--~,-.-- -·.  .  .-~-~'-·-.... ------~-~.,.,.. \n\n10 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-8   Filed 07/07/20   Page 13 of 26\n1  than  that  with  Trooper  Barrows.  He  was  kicked.  He \n2  indicated  he  was  taken  aback,  and  it hurt;  but  it was \n3  nothing  more  than  that.  So  taking  that  in  isolation,  it's \n4  not  a  case  that  merits  a  lengthy  jail  sentence. \n5  But  I'd  submit  to  the  Court  that  this  is  a \n6  circumstance  where  the  sum  is  really  greater  than  its \n7  individual  parts  in  that  Mr.  Young  has  been  getting  arrested \n8  since  1988.  He  has  twenty-six  years  of  criminal  activity. \n9  He  has  twenty-eight  criminal  convictions,  by  my  count.  He's \n10  violated  probation  on  three  occasions. \n11  And  that's  not  even  including  the  numerous  cases \n12  that  the  state  elected  not  to  pursue  for  one  reason  or \n13  another  nor  the  seven  other  pending  cases  that  we  presently \n14  have  in  this  court. \n15  Mr.  Young  has  been  a  burden  on  the  Town  of \n16  Stafford  and  the  State  of  Connecticut  for  quite  some  time. \n17  In  looking  at  his  criminal  history,  there  is  a  pattern  of \n18  behavior  that's  consistent  through  decades. \n19  In  1994,  he  was  convicted  of  an  incident  where \n20  he  assaulted  a  female,  grabbed  her  by  the  hair,  pushed  her \n21  head  in  to  the  wall.  He  was  highly  intoxicated.  He  didn't \n22  comply  with  the  police,  yelled  about  the  police  and  the \n23  Courts,  attempted  to  break  an  antenna  off  the  cruiser,  spit \n24  on  state  troopers. \n25  1994,  he  was  arrested,  believed  to  be  under  the \n26  influence  of  drugs  or  alcohol,  became  unruly,  was  described \n27  as  going  ballistic,  eventually  was  taken  to  the  hospital \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-8   Filed 07/07/20   Page 14 of 26 11 \n,.-------------------·--------------------, \n1  where  he  claimed  he  had  a  knee  that  was  broken. \n2  He  violated a  protective  order  in  1995  and  again \n3  three  months  later  in  1995,  and  in  that  particular  incident, \n4  he  spit  on  a  female,  attempted  to  fight  a  male  who  was  with \n5  her,  then  followed  them  in  a  car,  rammed  the  car,  and  broke \n6  a  window. \n7  Again  in  December  of  '95,  he  violated  a \n8  protective  order  again. \n9  In  March  of  1997,  he  violated a  protective \n10  order.  Excuse  me;  that  was  a  violation  of  probation. \n11  In  2002,  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  breach \n12  of  peace  and  interfering  in  an  incident  at  Joanna's  Caf~ in \n13  Somers.  He  was  intoxicated.  He  refused  to  comply  with \nI \nI  14  directions  from  the  state  police.  He  spit  during  transport \n15  to  the  state poljce.  And  there's  notatjons  that  he  told  the \n16  trooper  he  was  going  to make  up  a  story that  he  was \n17  assaulted by  the  state police. \n18  charged  with  interfering  with  the \n19  police.

He  says  that  it's \n12  an  exaggeration.  The  police  have  been  blowing  it out  of \n13  proportion  for  years;  and  that  incidents  have  not  been \n14  alcohol-driven.  It's merely  that  he  becomes  agitated  when \n15  he's  targeted  by  the  police  after  cons<_iminq  even  a  small \n16  amount  of  alcohol. \n17  I  think  that's  alarming  that  he  fails  to \n18  recognize  that  he  has  a  problem,  and  I  think  it's consistent \n19  with  the  fact  that  he  shows  no  signs  of  changing  his \n2 0  behavior. \n21  It's been  clear  throughout  this  case  that \n22  Mr.  Young  has  no  remorse  for  his  behavior.  He  sees  himself \n23  as  being  persecuted by  the  police.  He  thinks  they're  out  to \n24  get  him,  as  they  have  been  for  quite  some  time.  But  he \n25  neglects  the  fact  that  in  almost  every.one  of  the  cases,  the \n26  police  have  arrived  on  scene  as  the  result  of  a  911  call. \n27  So  it's not  the  police  that  are  chasing  him  down  and \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-8   Filed 07/07/20   Page 16 of 26 13 \n1  harassing  him  but  that  they're  being  called to  assist based \n2  on  his  behavior. \n3  Also,  looking  at  Mr.  Young's  past,  I  see, \n4  despite  the  twenty-plus  convictions,  that  he  has  been  given \n5  chance  after chance.  He's  been  given  conditional  discharges \n6  and  fines.  He's  been  given  fully  suspended  sentences, \n7  numerous  charges  that  were  nollied.  And  despite  those \n8  second,  third  chances,  he  has  failed  to  reform himself. \n9  I  looked  at  the  number  of  charges  that  relate  to \n10  violations  of  protective  orders,  conditions  of  release,  and \n11  violations  of  probation,  and  I'd suggest  to  the  Court  that \n12  he's  not  someone  that  should  get  a  split  sentence;  that  if \n13  there's  a  period  of  probation,  I  don't  think  it would  be \n1.. Le/1t   I  don't  think  he's  a  person  that's  going  to be \n15  rehabilitated by  probal:.ion1  and  I  don't  think  he's  ::;omeone \n16  who  would  comply  with  probation. \n17  We  look  at  the  traditional  factors  in \n18  sentencing,  specific,  general  deterrence,  punishment, \n19  rehabilitation.  I  don't  see  this  as  a  case  where  there's \n20  really  any  broader  message  for  potential  defendants.  I \n21  don't  see  it as  a  case  where  the  sentence  is  going  to  lead \n22  to  his  rehabilitation. \n23  I  do  see  it ~s an  opportunity  to  incapacitate \n24  Mr.  Young  and  ensure  that  he  does  not  harm  himself  or  anyone \n25  else.  I  think  that  every  day  that Mr.  Young  is \n26  incarcerated,  while  unfortunate  for  him  and  for  his  family, \n27  it is  a  good  thing  for  the  State  of  Connecticut  and  for \n\n14 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-8   Filed 07/07/20   Page 17 of 26\n1  Stafford  specifically,  where  I  think  he  is  unquestionably  a \n2  danger  to  the  community.  His  violent  and  reckless  behavior \n3  has  been  going  on,  as  I've  stated,  for  nearly  thirty  years \n4  without  any  sign  of  letting  up. \n5  So  I'm  not  recommending  any  specific  sentence  to \n6  the  Court,  but  I  am  recommending  to  the  Court  that  a  lengthy \n7  period  of  incarceration  is  appropriate  for  Mr.  Young;  and  I \n8  think  that  it is  in  the  best  interest  of  the  community  that \n9  he  serve  a  lengthy  period  of  incarceration.  Thank  you. \n10  THE  COURT:  Thank  you. \n11  Attorney  Joy. \n12  ATTY.  JOY:  Thank  you,  Your  Honor. \n13  ARGUMENT  OF  ATTY.  JOY: \n14  Your  Honor,  before  you  today  sits  Mr.  Young,  46 \n15  years  old,  and  there  is  a  lengthy  history  of  criminal \n16  involvement  here. \n17  Mr.  Young  states  that  having  lived  in  Stafford \n18  for  most  of  his  life  that  he  somehow  has  become  a  target  of \n' \n19  the  Stafford  Police  Department  and  the  Troop  C  state \n20  troopers  and  that  he  fails  to  somehow  stay  out  of  their way \n21  and  has  resulted  in  all  of  these  convictions  that  you  see \n22  before  you  that  he  did  indeed  plead  guilty  to  and  in  some \n23  instances  under  the  Alford doctrine,  where  he  did  not  agree \n24  with  any  of  the  allegations  against  him. \n25  Obviously,  I  don't  have  to  remind  the  Court  that \n26  the  cases  from  1/10  going  forward  are  all  pending  and  that \n27  all  of  those  allegations  are  merely  allegations  and  have  not \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-8   Filed 07/07/20   Page 18 of 26\n15 \n1  been  found  to  be  facts. \n2  Mr.  Young  is  accompanied  today  by  a  couple  of \n3  his  family  members,  his  mother  in  particular,  who  does  not \n4  want  to  address  the  Court.  But  obviously,  I'm  sure  she \n5  seeks  leniency  on  behalf  of  her  son. \n6  Mr.  Young  for  many  years  has  maintained  a  tree \n7  removal  business  in  the  area,  and  for  many  years,  he  worked \n8  on  several  of  the  disasters,  Sandy.  And  I  believe  Gloria \n9  was  the  other  one  Katrina,  helping  and  assisting  FEMA  in \n10  the  removal  of  trees  from  these  disaster  areas.  Oh  -- and \n11  Irene,  also.  So  you  know,  he  was  a  successful  business  man \n12  prior  to  being  incarcerated  on  this. \n13  He  has  no  idea  what  has  become  of  all  his  tree \nI \n1.  14  removal  equipment,  and  he's  incurred  quite  a  bit  of  debt  in \n15  hiring  an  al:torney  to  represent  him  who  he  then  had  to \n16  dismiss  for  all  the  reasons  which  Your  Honor  has  read. \n17  And  so  on  behalf  of  my  client,  I  do  ask  the \n18  Court  for  leniency  and  for  the  Court  to  enter  a  judgment \n19  here  in  a  sentence  of  as  little time  as  the  Court  sees  fit. \n20  THE  COURT:  Does  the  defendant  wish  to  make  a \n21  statement  before  the  Court  imposes  sentence?  .': I'  \n22  ATTY.  JOY:  No;  he  does  not,  Your  Honor. \n23  Okay.  Thank  you  very  much. \n24  Now,  as  Attorney  Durham mentioned,  the  four \n25  criteria  that  the  Court  needs  to  consider  in \n26  sentencing  somebody  are  protecting the  public, \n27  deterrence,  rehabilitation,  and  punishment. \n\n16 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-8   Filed 07/07/20   Page 19 of 26\n1  If  it were  simply  punishment,  it would  be  an \n2  easy  sentence  today  because  I  would  just  give  him  the \n3  max,  but  I  need  to  consider  the  other  criteria,  as \n4  well. \n5  On  May  10,  2011,  the  police  were  dispatched  to \n6  the  offender's  home  for  a  domestic  violence \n7  complaint.  According  to  the  complainant, \n8  Jessica  Reed,  Mr.  Young  assaulted  and  strangled  her. \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12  reckless  endangerment  in  the  first  degree. \n13  After  a  jury  trial  on  all  the  counts,  Mr.  Young \n- -..... ~~.-..;'-\"~==-~~~\"\"\"\"~\"\"-\"'-'>..\"\".......___8,.,--....,....-=\"'~~~~·-·~·--··. ... ~~~~----\"\"'. .= \"'\"'~\"=-~ \n14  was  found  not  guilty  on  all  counts  except  as  to  one \n15  t  on  a  p o l i c e  o f f i c e r  and  ,1; b~::\" \"S  \"' \"''f l~. \\e, II.O  IV 'ci j~~~ i~\\ t<,\\~t  ~J{t',) \n·\"'It•WkoP{KL\\f1t\\\\ ~~~((!~ ~t'oi)\\ \n16  interfering.

And \n23  committing  a  crime  while  on  pretrial  release  can  be \n24  punished  by  up  to  ten  years  for  a  felony  and  one  year \n25  for  a  misdemeanor.  Therefore,  Mr.  Young  faces  a \n26  maximum  sentence  of  twenty-two  years  for  his  crimes \n27  if they  are  to  run  consecutively. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-8   Filed 07/07/20   Page 20 of 26 17 \n1  We  have  continued  his  sentencing  for  a  few \n2  months,  several  times  for  the  PSI  to  be  completed, \n3  and  then  we  had  another  continuance  for  Mr.  Young  to \n4  be  examined,  as  his  former  attorneys  had  some  issues \n5  regarding  that  matter.  He  was  found  competent  to  be \n6  sentenced,  however. \n7  And  then  he  was  given  an  opportunity  for  another \n8  PSI  after  he  discharged  his  previous  counsel, \n9  Attorney  Pattis'  law  firm,  and  Attorney  Joy  was \n10  appointed  as  a  special  public  defender  in  this \n11  matter. \n12  Mr.  Young  has  a  very  long  history of  arrests  and \n13  convictions  going  back  to  1998,  including  several  .I  \n1- '-I\"I   conviction~ for  interfering  with  police  officers. \n15  Many  of  the  charges  were  nollicd,  and  he  only \n16  received  fines  for  many  others.  He  received \n17  suspended  sentences  and  was  placed  on  probations \n18  which  were  later violated.  And  until  1996,  Mr.  Young \n19  did  not  serve  any  prison  sentences,  when  he  served \n20  about  three  years  in  prison  for  a  number  of \n21  convictions  including  three  counts  of  violation of \n22  protective  orders. \n23  He  has  eight  more  files  on  the  trial  list \n24  involving multiple  counts  for  violent  behavior  and \n25  interfering with  police  officers.  It  is  evident to \n26  this  Court  that  Mr.  Young  has  violent  tendencies and \n27  has  issues  with  authority,  particularly with  police \nL----------------------------------------------\n\n18 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-8   Filed 07/07/20   Page 21 of 26\n1  officers;  therefore,  he  poses  a  significant  safety \n2  risk  to  the  public. \n3  He  has  disregarded  police  instructions,  as  well \n4  as  Court  orders  in  the  past,  and  it  is  ironic  that \n5  had  he  simply  complied  with  police  instructions  on \n6  this  night,  he  would  be  a  free  man,  at  least  as  to \n7  these  counts,  because  the  jury  found  him  not  guilty \n8  on  the  domestic  violence  charges. \n9  Either  Mr.  Young  has  an  inability  to  follow \n10  instructions  of  the  police  or  he  has  no  regard  for \n11  police  officers,  both  of  which  is  of  concern  for  the \n12  Court.  But  in  any  event,  he  needs  to  understand  that \n13  he  is  not  above  the  law  and  cannot  do  as  he  pleases \n14  without  suffering  the  consequences. \n15  Perhaps  because  in  the  past  so  many  of  his  cases \n16  were  either  nollied  or  he  received mostly  suspended \n17  sentences,  he  believes  he  can  continue  to  act  as  he \n18  does  and  flout  the  system,  but  Mr.  Young  needs  to \n19  understand  this  Court  will  not  tolerate  this  type  of \n20  behavior  any  longer;  and  he  must  be  punished  for  his \n21  illegal  actions. \n22  Police  officers  have  a  very  difficult  job  to \n23  perform,  and  they  are  subjected  to  danger  constantly; \n24  and  we  need  to  protect  our  officers  so  that  they  can \n25  perform  their  duties  in  protecting  society.  And \n26  protecting  the  public  is  one  of  the  criteria  that  the \n27  Court  must  consider  in  sentencing. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-8   Filed 07/07/20   Page 22 of 26 19 \n1  And  I  understand  there  was  very  little injury  in \n2  this  matter,  but  as  Attorney  Durham  stated,  it's his \n3  history of  interfering and  not  following  police \n4  officers  that  is  of  concern.  A  significant  period  of \n5  incarceration  is  warranted  in  this  case  due  to \n6  Mr.  Young's  lengthy prior  history  and  his  repeated \n7  behavior  of  confrontation  with  the  police. \n8  This  Court  also  needs  to  be  cognizant  of  the \n9  need  for  deterrence,  not  only  for  Mr.  Young  but  also \n10  of  others  who  may  be  thinking  of  doing  the  same. \n11  Because  of his  past  violations  of  probation  and \n12  inability  to  follow  Court  orders,  as  well  as  the \n13  number  of  arrests  and  convictions,  it is the  Court's \n14  oplnlon  that  probation  is  not  appropriate  in  this \n15 \n16  Therefore,  on  the  charge  of  assault  on  a  police \n17  officer,  in  violation  of  Connecticut  General  Statute \n18  Section  53a-167c,  it is  the  senterice  of  the  Court \n19  that  the  defendant  be  committed  to  the  custody  of  the \n20  Commissioner  of  Correction  for  a  period  of  five years \n21  to  serve,  followed  by  five  years  special  parole. \n22  On  the  charge  of  interfering with  an  officer,  in \n23  violation  of  Connecticut  GP.neral  Statute  Section \n24  53a-167a,  one  year  to  serve,  consecutive. \n25  On  the  charge  of  committing  a  crime  while  on \n26  pretrial  release,  in  violation  of  Connecticut  General \n27  Statute  Section  53a-40b,  on  the  assault  on  a  polLee \n\n20 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-8   Filed 07/07/20   Page 23 of 26\n1  officer,  five  years  to  serve,  consecutive,  and  one \n2  year  to  serve  on  interfering  with  a  police  officer, \n3  also  to  run  consecutive. \n4  Total  effective  sentence  is  twelve  years  to \n5  serve,  followed  by  five  years  special  parole. \n6  And  do  we  have  his  forms  for  his  right  to \n7  appeal,  as  well  as  sentence  review? \n8  THE  CLERK:  Yes,  Your  Honor. \n9  THE  COURT:  If  that  could  be  handed  over  to  the \n10  defendant. \n11  Let  the  record  reflect  that's  being  done. \n12  ATTY.

And \n6 \nspecifically  specified  only  in  violation  of \n7 \nConnecticut  General  Statute  53a-167 (c)  (a)  (1)  which \n8 \nwas  an  additional  count  to  their  Count  3,  which  is  a \n9 \ndifferent  subsection.  But,  nevertheless,  an  original \n10 \ncount  in  th.eir May  11th  2011  short  form  filing.  But \n11 \nany  rate,  I  was  found  not  guilty on  Count  3. \n12 \nBut  as  to  Count  4  here,  it's misinformed  as  an \n13 \n, fi) original  information  filing.  As  you  can  see  on \n15  . ~~L/ (n;~)~\" /  ri~f vE··\" ' xhibi4t~  \"\"~''\"4'~-   it's captioned  inform.a tion,  not  substitute· \n.,)  information.  Therefore,  manipulating  the  accurate \n16 \nrecord  as  it was  an  original  information. \n17 \nNow  as  to  Exhibit  3  now,  that  I  had  submitted, \n18 \nwhich  is  the  JDCR  71  second  short  form  filing  by  the \n19 \nState,  it reflects  Count  4  now  is  assault  of  a  public \n20 \nsafety/emergency  medical/public  transportation  in \n21 \nviolati6n  of  Connecticut  General  Statute  53a-167c. \n22 \nAnd  there's  no  count  at  all  of  the  original  failure \n23 \nto  submit  to  fingerprint  filing.  But  at  any  rate, \n24 \nthe  general  rule  requirements  of  information  filings \n25 \nare  the  same  general  pr'inciples  as  to  form  and \n.26 \ncontents  and  rules  of  pleading  that· apply  to \n27 \n\n70 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-9   Filed 07/07/20   Page 5 of 19\nConclusions,  arguments,  and  beliefs  should  not  be \n1 \nstated,  but  should  be  facts.  An  information, \n2 \nmoreover,  cannot  be  doubled.  And  I  specified \n3 \ndoubled.  And  I'll tell  you  in  a  little bit why. \n4 \n5  This  is,  one  Gannot  be  charged  with  two  or  more \noffenses  in  the  same  count.  This  makes  it bad  on  the \n6  t)eue.t. E» t:s~ \n7  ground  of  duplicity  or  doubledness.  More \n8  importantly,  it must  not  be  repugnant  because  as  is \nhere  in  this  case  and  in this  information  filing,, if \n9 \n10  one  or  more  parts -\"of  the  information  is  repugnant, \n11  repugnant  t6  the  other  part,  the  whole  is  void. \n12  Especia_lly,  especially  as  is  here  where  repugnant \nmatter  is  material  and  cannot  be  held ~erely \n.N(:)f\\<.  .  . \nsuperfluous  not  redundant.  And  beyond  certainty has \n~ \naltered the  prejudicial  surprising  untimely  Count  4 \n16  and  preceding  Count  3  averments. \nMost  importantly,  these  both -in-te-n-ti-onal  corrupt \n17 \n~RePEA.l~ \n18  material  insufficiencies  with  no  particular  named \n19  victims  in  Count  4  nor  Cou'Nn\\ tl( R.3.e,.   canXnt'o<!tf obt\\eM Are l.j ected  as \nimmaterial  surplusage  or material  informational \nCUR.Eb  -~ \"'-='=\"-==~ \ndefects  c-~rried by  any  verdict,  nor  ever  can  be \ndeemed  as  a  waiver  of my  right  to  arrest  these \n23  illegal  judgments.  Again,  the  statements  must  not  be \n24  in  the  alternative.  This  is, ·the  information  must \n25  not  charge  one  with  committing  one  or  the  other  of \n26  two  offenses.  For  example,  if an  information  states \nthat  the  accused  set  fire  to,  or  caused  fire  to,  be \n27 \n\n72 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-9   Filed 07/07/20   Page 6 of 19\nThe  day,  the  month,  and  the  year  should  be  stated. \n1 \n·,  2  It  is  not  necessar:y  however  to  state  the  hour  but  all \n3  of  the  other  has  to  be  stated.  Then  and  there,  as \n4  stated  in  the  averment  of  the  time  and  place  must  be \n5  repeated  at  common  law  with  each  and  every material \n6  allegation  of  the  offense.  We  got  seven  offenses \n7  here.  Not  once  did  he  use  the  term,  then  and  there. \nTo  avoid  the  cumbersome  method  of  literally repeating \n8 \nthe  day  and  the  month  and  the  year  and  also  the \n9 \nl'o  county  as  first  said out,  the  phrase  then  and  there \n11  is  used  as  6ften  as  each  new  material  part  of  the \n12  offense  is  alleged.  Now,  what,  what  we  got  here? \n13  Just  off  the  top  of my  head,  Count  2  -- we  got  on  or \n'  14  about  May  11th,  approximately  nine,  said Michael \n15  Young  did  obstruct,  resist,  hinder,  or  endanger  a \npolice  officer  in  the performance  of  his  official \n16 \n17  duties  in  violation,  again' ,  not  stating  that  it's \n18  against  the  peace  and  dignity  of  the  State,  but  at \nany  rate  then 'la ..n  d  there  ain't  there.  Then  and \n19 \n20  there  is  not  the  s6  called word  of  art  in  Count  4  as \nwell,  in  any  of  them  elements. \n21 \nAs  to  statutory offenses  here,  it's sometimes· \n22 \n23  said that  it's sufficient  in  statutory offenses  to \n24  follow  the  word  of  the  Statute,  but  this  practice  may \nhowever  be  fatal  as  it  is  in  this  information  filing \n25 \nto  the  information.  If  the  Statute  in.describing  the \n26 \n27  offense  contains  all  the  necessary  elements  of  the \n\n74 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-9   Filed 07/07/20   Page 7 of 19\nalways  be  avoided.  Since  matter  inserted  by  way  of \nl \nexcessiveness,  although  unnecessary,  is  no  longer  in \n'•, \n'::mt_MaIYt\\ 'e(frli EiaR l::r ;b;a ln  d  must  remain  and  must  be  proved.  So \nmaybe  that's  why  you  don't  see  anybody's  name  in \nCount  3  or  Count  4  under  these  felony  offenses. \n5 \nBecause  they made  up,  the  State  made  up  these  victims \n6 \nas  they  went  along  at  trial.  And  the  record  proves \n7 \nthat.  They  didn't  know  who  to  put  in  there  when  they \n8 \nfiled  that.  Maybe  because  they  didn~t know  what \n9 \npolice  officer was ·gonna  go  along  with  their \n10 \nshenanigans.  I'll give  you  an  example.  In  an \n11 \ninformation  for  larceny of  a  horse,  it describes  him \n12 \nas  a  Bay  Horse,  four  years  old,  having  two  white  feet \n13 \nand  a  star upon  its  forehead.  Such  a  particular \n14 \ndescription,  although  not  required,  must  stand.  No \n15 \npart  of  it  can  be  rejected  as  surplusage.  It's  a \n16 \nmaterial  part  of  the  offense  now  and .  larc. eny  of  just \n17 \na  horse  must  be  proven  or  the  case  fails.  But  if the \n18 \nwhole  of  a  statement  can  be  stricken  out  without \n19' \n2201  ,\"·   ~U/>/R'V(-;!-;u''=\\f- \\/   dperosvtreo yl. itn.g    tWhhee rae cmtcVulaAstTat\\etEir ofs\\n   ,m ?ti:~tC rG.ii aslns' t mneerceelyss  asruyrp  tlou sage, \n22  __y  .  ~-~  it has  NnOo t  effect  on  the  information  filing.  But \nI'll,  I'll tell  you,  Your  Honor,  the  names  of  the \n23 \nvictims  needed  to  be  in  here.  They  needed  to  state \n24 \nthe  names  who  are  particular  -- they  needed  to  be \n25 \ncertain  on  who  I  assaulted  or  allegedly  assaulted  in \n26 \nthem  crimes. \n27 \n\n76 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-9   Filed 07/07/20   Page 8 of 19\nbelieve  it's  in  Count  5  neither.  But  at  any  rate, \n1 \nlet me  give  you  an  example  here.  Forgery  requires  an \n2 \nintent  to  defraud  larceny  and  intent  to  deprive  the \n3 \nowner  of  permanent,  permanently  of  the  property. \n4 \nBurglary  and  intent  to,  to  commit  a  fe__ ,.l,.~o ... · n··=y;-;;1.  \n5. \nATTY.

GROSSO:  Thank  you. \n21  ' ' \nTHE  COURT:  So  noted. \n22 \nTHE  WITNESS:  May  I  move  on? \n23 \nTHE  COURT:  You  may  continue. \n24 \nTHE  WITNESS:  How  'bout  this  one?  Many \n25 \nstatutory  offenses  also  require  a  specific  intent, \n26 \nsuch  as  Count  2  here  -- let me  start  that  over.  Many \n27 \n\n78 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-9   Filed 07/07/20   Page 9 of 19\ncommon  law  an  essential  part  of  the  description  of \n1 \n'  2  the  certain  offenses.  And  unless  theyrre  made \nunnecessary  by  local  Statutes  or  decisions,  they  must \n3 \nbe  employed  to  make  the  information  good.  These  are \n4 \n', \ntechnical  words  and  have  established meaning.  So  no \n5 \nother  words  can  substitute  for  them. \n6 \nAmong  these  terms,  are  the  words  feloniously  and \nmalice. ,  a-f~t~eDrR ffloHrDeOth&oHTu ght,  in perjury,  the  words \nswoRE \nwillfully  and  corruptly,  so  are  falsely.  As  has,  has \n9 \n10  been  done  in  this  case,  Your  Honor.  Feloniously,  of \n11  ~~p~\\ ertaining to  or  having  the  quality  of  a  felony. \n12 ~·  ~//.t?J~   P~~cG:·iCfE~-£~~:1::2\\,'.\\ ~f rom  an  evil  heart  or  purpose.  Done  with \n13  1  deliberate  intention  of  committing  a  crim~,  without \n14  color  of  right  of  excuse,  maliciously,  acting  with \n15  felonious  intent.  Acting  with  the  intent  to  colllinit  a \n16  felony.  Felonious,  a  technical  word  oh,  I  think \n17  we  had  brought  that  up  over  my  words  of  art . \n18  . Technical  word  of  law,  which  means  done  with  intent \n19  to  colllinit  a  crime  of  the  grade  or  quality  of  a \nfelony.  Not  just with  the  intent,  but  with  the \n20 \n21  quality  of  a  felony.  I'll give  you  an  example,  a \n22  felonious  assault,  Count  4·is  a  felonious  assarilt. \n23  Under  the  Connecticut  General  Statute  53a-\n24  167 (c) (a)  (1),  it needs  to  state  in .there  that  I \n25  committed  physical  injury  to  such  police  officer with \n26  the  intent  to  commit  a  felonious  assault.  And  it \n27  doesn't  state  that  nowhere  in  that  Count  4.  The  term \n\n80 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-9   Filed 07/07/20   Page 10 of 19\n1  properly  prepare  for  a  trial,  and  prevent  him  from \n2  ever  being  tried  again  for  the  same  offense.  All \nright. \n3 \nSo  Count  2,  the  undersigning  Deputy  State's \n4 \n5  Attorney  for  the  Judicial  District  of  Tolland  further \n6  accuses  Michael  A.  Young  of  interfering with  an \n7  officer.  So  the  chosen  words  of  art,  accuses  Michael \nA.  Young,  right  there,  charges  me,  charges  me,  right \n8 \n9  there  in  the,  I  believe  it's the  commencement.  So \n10  that  would  be  the  commencement.  He's  charging me \n11  when  he  states  the,  when  he  chooses  the  wo~d of  art, \n12  accuses.  He  charges  me  right  there  in  the \n13  commencement.  But,  then,  you  go  on,  and  then  the \n··. ',  14  next  word  after  interfering with  an  officer,  he  uses \n15  the  word,  again,  he  chooses  the  word  and  charges,  in \n16  the  area-- that's  not  certainty,  of  164  East  Street. \nOkay.  Again,  he's  claiming  in  the  area,  which  is  not \n17 \ncertain,  of  the  area  of  164  East  Street  in  the  town \n18 \nof  Stafford Springs  on  or  about  the  lOth  day  of May \n19 \n2011.  Again,  at  approximately  9:00p.m.  He  uses  the \n20 \n21  term  approximately.  There's  no  then  and  there.  The \n22  sa~d,  Michael  A.  Young,  so  now  he's  using,  he's \ndqubling  my  name  here,  right.  He  didn't  just  use  it \n23 \n24  in  the  commencement,  but  now  he's  using  it down  here. \nMichael  A.  Young  did  -- he  doesn't  use  intended  and \n25 \ndid,  he  just  says  did  obstruct,  resist,  hinder,  or \n26 \nendanger  police  officer  in performance  of  such  police \n27 \n\n82 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-9   Filed 07/07/20   Page 11 of 19\nEdition,  the  word  charges  is  the  expense  which  have \n1 \n\"  been  incurred or  dispersements  made  in  connection \n·2 \nwith  a  contract.  And  I  submit  to  you,  Your  Honor, \n3 \nthis  information  drafting,  to  my  knowledge,  is  a \n4 \ncontract.  It's  a  contract  that Mr.  Reed  Durham \n5 \ndrafted.  Whether  he  drafted  it on May  13th  2013  or \n6 \nhe  drafted  it sometime  before  then  and,  and,  and \n7  I \npostdated  it,  or  drafted  it after  that.  He  never \n8 \nsubmitted  it till August  8th  2013.  But  anyways,  it's \n9 \ndefinitely  drafted by Mr.  Reed  Durham.  You  know,  and \n10 \nwithout  getting  into  the  particulars  on  where  you  see \n11 \non on  Exhibit  2,  there's August  8th  2013  stamped  on \n12 \n1 \neach  count  with  the  initials not  guilty plea.  And, \n13 \nyou  know,  at  the  top  it says  filed  in  court  at  11:15 \n14 \nor  whatnot.  Without  getting  to  the  merits  of  this \n15 \nnot  guilty plea  on August  8th  2013,  I  submit  to  you, \n16 \nYour  Honor,  that,  that  would  be  an  informal  binding \n17 \ncontract  of  my  not  guilty plea  of  the  wordings  chose \n18 \nin  his  information  filing.  The  contents  of  this \n19 \ndocument  right  here  need  to  be. enforced. \n20 \nLet's  use  that  word  enforced,  because  now  I'm \n21 \ngonna  touch  upon  -- if  you  go  to  Connec:ticut  General \n22 \n-- no,  your  Connecticut  Practice  Book,  Connecticut \n23 \nPractice  Book  44-37,  it's  gonna  show  you  some \n24 \ndefinitions  of  terms,  Your  Honor.  And  I  submit  to \n25 \nyou  that  these  chosen  words  of  art  were  chosen  for  a \n26 \nreason.  So  in  that  section  44-37,  in  the  Connecticut \n27 \n\n84 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-9   Filed 07/07/20   Page 12 of 19\nhis  office when  he  signs  this  docwnent.  Okay?  He's \n1 \nunder  the  oath  of  his  office,  and  he  knows  I  did  not \n2 \ncommit  these  crimes.  And  therefore,  he's  not  gonna \n3 \nsign  his  name  to  crimes  he  knows  I  didn't  commit.  So \n4 \nwhat  does  he  claim?  He  claims  that  I'm  in violation \n5 \nof  Section  53a-167a,  that's  Count  2,  and  I'm  in \n6 \nviolation  of  Connecticut  General  Statutes  53a-167(c) \n7 \n(a)  (1).  That's  what  he  claims. \n8 \nSo  now  let's  go  to  y'all's  Connecticut  Practice \n9 \nBook  Section  44-37,  under  the  definition  of  terms  of \n10 \na  violation,  means  an  offense  for  which  only  a \n11 \nsentence  authorized,  is  a  fine,  in which  is  not \n12 \nexpressly  designated  as  an  infraction.  I  can  see \n13 \nthat  Count  2  an  Count  4  in  this  information  filing \n14 \nare  not  infractions,  but  under  the  terms  of  this \n15 \nbinding  contract  between  now  Mr.  Reed  Durham  and my \n16 \nalleged not  guilty pleas  stamped  there,  a  sentence  of \n17 \nincarceration will  not  follow.  A  fine  shall  be \n18 \nimposed  only,  authorized,  is  a  fine  to  be  imposed. \n19 \nI've  been  sitting  in prison  for  six  years,  now.  I'm \n20 \njust  stating  the  word  of  art  that  were  used  in  this \n21 \nbinding  contract,  Your  Honor. \n22 \nATTY.  GROSSO:  Your  Honor,  I'm  going  to  object. \n23 \nThis  document  is  a  F1,1ll  Exhibit.  The  Court  is  well \n24 \naware  of  terms  of  art  and  it speaks  for  itself.  I \n25 \n\\ \nbelieve-- I'm  sorry.  That's  my  objection. \n26 \nTHE  COURT:  Mr.  Youn'g,  anything  in  response  to \n27 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-9   Filed 07/07/20   Page 13 of 19 86 \nmake  your  ruling. \n1 \nTHE  COURT:  Attorney  Grosso,  the  Court  notes \n2 \nyour  objection.  The  Court's  overruling  the  objection \n3 \nto  the  extent  that  Mr.  Young  has  been  using  it as  a \n4 \nbasis  to make  his  testimony.  He's  been  referencing \n5 \ni·t.  But,  Mr.  Young,  the  Court  will  advise  you  to \n6 \nlimit  your  reading  of  it.  Just  refer  to  specific \n7 \n8  port~ons of  it.  Thank  you. \nTHE  WITNESS:  I'll try my  best,  Your  Honor. \n9 \nATTY.  GROSSO:  Thank  you,  Your  Honor. \n10 \nTHE  COURT:  You  may  proceed. \n11 \nTHE  WITNESS:  Okay.  Again,  I  want  to  address \n12 \nCount  2  that  there's  no  claim  of  specific  intent  or \n13 \nwillful  statement  which  must  be  alleged  for  the  mind \n14 \nThat's  a  fatal  defect  ther~.  And \n15  crime  under  that. \nI  wanna  touch  upon  where  when  he  states  that  in  the \n16 \narea  of  164  East  Street,  now  we  know  that  this \n17 \ninformation  filing  came  on  August  8th  prior  to  trial, \n18 \nwhere  by  the  looks  of  his  draft,  he's  claiming  that \n19 \ncrimes  basically happened  at  164  East  StTrRefleNtS~  A!P-l+b~ \n±i~~<~tJ.~~1e e \n2 0  ·. \nBut,  now,  there  was  two  separate  incidences, \n21 \nspecifically to  Count  4.  It was  alleged  at  trial.  I \n22 \nwas  convicted  that  it happened  in  that  164  East \n23 \nStreet.  But,  in his  preliminary  draft  here,  he \n24 \nclaims  the  same  area  of  164  East  Street  on  the \n25 \ni. \nassault  -- I  mean  the  interfering with  a  police \n26 \nofficer,  Count  2.  But  at  trial,  now,  Ifve  been \n27 \n\n88 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-9   Filed 07/07/20   Page 14 of 19\nseparate  trial on  this.  So  with  that  being  said,  I \n1 \n'•,  am  entitled to  plead  guilty,  plead not  guilty, \n2 \nelection by  trial by  jury,  election by  trial  by \n3 \njudge.  I  was  never  afforded  them  opportunities,  Your \n4 \nHonor.  But  the  key  fact  here  is  this  is  another \n5 \nseparate  contract  he  drafted.  I  never  bound  into \n6 \nthis  contract  because  I  never  gave  a  plea.  If  you \n7 \nlook,  I  was  found  guilty  after  a  jury trial.  That's \n8 \nwhat  it says,  9/3/13.  There's  no  stamp  oh  here \n9 \nsaying  not  guilty plea  on  8/13,  8/30,  any  other  date. \n10 \nno  plea ..  And  in  the  record,  Your  Honor, \n11 \nno  plea.  Therefore,  the  trial court  had  no \n12  persohoon  .. \n....\" '  matter  nor  prosound  jurisdiction to  sentence \n13 \nme  on  this  Part  B  information  filing,  which  enhanced \n14 \nmy  sentence  six  years. \n15 \nRight  now  I  hctve  six  years  in.  I  was  sentenced \n16 \nto  a  total  of  12  years'  incarceration.  I  have  over \n17 \nsix  years  in  right  now.  This  is  null  and  void.  This \n18 \nsentence  is  null  and  void.  There  was  no  plea.  I \n19 \nnever,  I  never  informally,  formally,  however  you \n20 \nwanna  put  it,  entered  into  this  plea  agreement \n21  ('' \nwith  -- I  mean,  entered  into  this  contract with  a \n22 \nplea  agreement.  I  never  gave  a  plea  on  this. \n23 \nf(. \n24  ~~dTfh ere's no  subject matter  jurisdiction and  there's  no \n25  .;; f{j (,/<:~l~;•/   p'-Pre-o..l.fs'.Soo-un-nG-d....a-ml   jurisdiction  for  this  six  year  enhancement \nsentence  in  the  Part  B  information  filing  alone. \n26 \nI  wanna  touch  upon  one  more  thing  -- the  arrest \n27 \n\n90 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-9   Filed 07/07/20   Page 15 of 19\nover  the  subject  matter  or  the  person  is  absolutely \n1 \n2  void.  And  one  restrained  of  his  liberty by  such,  a \nsentence  and  verdict  has  his  remedy  and  right  through \n3 \na  habeas  corpus. \n4 \nIt's  took  me  a  long  time  to  come  here. and  get \n5 \nhere.  And  I  have  in  no  way,  Your  Honor,  been \n6 \n7  delayin~ any  proceedings.  If you  look  at  the  trial \n8  record,  you'll  see  over  and  over  have  I  made  it clear \n9  that  these  are  void,  null  and  void.  I've  been  all \n10  the  way  to  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  with  this \n11  case,  as  pursuing  matters  in  this  courthouse  in  state \n12  appeals.  So  in no  way  have  I  been  trying  to  delay \n13  these  proceedings.  So  at  this  point,  Your  Honor,  I \n14  would  ask  yourself,  or  I  would  ask  of  you,  if you \n15  would  reconsider  your  p1:evious  judgment  on  my \n16  preliminary motion  this  morning  for  release  pending \n17  the  outcome  of  this  case.  So  that  I  may  have  a \n18  proper  opportunity  to  obtain  ass{sted  legal  Special \n19  Forces  in  this  matter.  And  if nothing  else,.  an \n20  alternative  resolution would  be  to  at  least,  to  at \n21  least  vacate  this  Part  B  53  -- Connecticut  General \n22  Statute  53a-40b  enhancement. \nTHE  COURT:  Mr.  Young,  where  we  are  right  now  is \n23 \n24  in  the  midst  of  your  testimony.  If  you  wish  to \n25  address  any  motions  to  the  Court,  renew  any  motions, \n26  request  consideration,  the  Court  will  entertain  such \n27  after  your  testimony  has  concluded.  But  we  will  not \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-9   Filed 07/07/20   Page 16 of 19 92 \nTHE  WITNESS:  So  at  this  point,  my  direct  on \n1 \n',  this  matter  will be  concluded. \n2 \nTHE  COURT:  Thank  you.  Attorney  Grosso,  any \n3 \ncross-examination? \n4 \nATTY.  GROSSO:  No,  Your  Honor. \n5 \nTHE  COURT:  Thank  you.  No  cross-examination \n6 \n7  .  provided. \n·· ?.¢I I   _l\\  So  my  only  rebuttal  will  be  I \n8  •1~\\\\q;  THE  PETITIONER: \n9  .,'\"~~\\ 0..?~r eser.v  e  my  witness  recall  right. \n10  ::~  .,..- \"0,.~\\l)\\   THE  COURT:  The  Court  will  allow  you  such. \n(j~\\0~?: \n~~~  THE  PETITIONER:  And  I  would  like  to  presume \n11 \ntomorrovJ. \n12 \nTHE  COURT:  We'll  address  that-- we'll  address \n13 \nscheduling  in  a  moment.  At  this  point,  do  you  wish \n14 \nto  renew  your  motions,  or  your  requests  for \n15 \nreconsideration  at  this  time? \n16 \nTHE  PETITIONER:  I  do. \n17 \nTHE  COURT:  ·All  right.  So  just  so  I'm  clear, \n18 \nyour  request  was  for  one,  the  Court  to  reconsider \n19 \nyour  re~uest to  be  released  at  this  time  to  pursue \n20 \nlegal  assistance,  or  alternatively,  for  the  Court  to \n21 \nvacate  the  Part  B  enhancement.  Is  that  correct? \n22 \nTHE  PETITIONER:  That  was  my  request,  but  if you \n23 \njust  give  me  a  second  to  refer  back  to my  motion? \n24 \nTHE  COURT:  Please  do.  Take  your  time. \n25 \nTHE  PETITIONER:  If  I  can  make  one  further \n26 \ncomment,  so  all  right,  I  am  referring  to  -- I  would \n27 \n\n94 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-9   Filed 07/07/20   Page 17 of 19\nBased  upon  that  consideration,  the  Court \n1 \nindicated  earlier we  need  a  new  date  for  those \n2 \nsubpoenas  to  be  issued,  served,  and  for  those  to \n3 \nrespond  to  appear  in  court.  So  that  was  the  date  we \n4 \nprovided of  February  19th  2020  for  those  two \n5 \nwitnesses  to  testify on  that  date  for  subpoena.  This \n6 \ntrial was  scheduled  for  a  two  day  trial.  Today  being \n7 \nday  one.  We  were  originally  scheduled  for  tomorrow \n8 \nSeptember  18th  for  day  two,  noting  at  this  time  that \n9 \nwe  have  no  witnesses  prepared  to  testify tomorrow  for \n10 \nI \nthe  Petitioner's  side.  Day  two  that  is marked  for \n11 \n12  tomorrow  is  now  marked  off. \nTHE  PETITIONER:  'But  I'm prepared  to  testify \n13 \n14  tomorrow. \nTHE  COURT:  1\\nd  Mr.  Young  has  indicated  his \n15 \nwillingness  to  testify tomorrow,  however,  the  Court \n16 \nhas  indicated  the  Court  has  heard  testimony  from  Mr. \n17 \nYoung  today.  The  Court  has  afforded him  reasonable \n18 \nlatitude  to  provide  whatever  testimony he  wanted  to \n19 \nprovide.  The  Court  in  no  way  curtailed his  desire  or \n20 \nability to  testify today.  And,  therefore,  the  Court \n21 \ngave  him  chance  to  testify,  have  cross-examination, \n22 \nand  then  provide  rebuttal  testimony  as  well  for  that \n23 \npoint.  The  Court  is  not  allowing  the  request  for \n24 \ntomorrow  for  a  trial  for  the  petitioner  to  testify \n25 \nagain.  We  will  resume  the  next  court  date  February \n26 \n19th  2020. \n27 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-9   Filed 07/07/20   Page 18 of 19 96 \n1  rest.  Issue  your  ruling.  This  matter  is  adjourned. \n'•  2  THE  COURT:  So  Mr.  Young,  you're  indicating  you \ndo  not  wish  to  call  any  further  witnesses. \n3 \nTHE  PETITIONER:  No.  We're  done. \n4 \nTHE  COURT:  You  have  no  desire  to  call  those  two \n5 \n6  witnesses. \nTHE  PETITIONER:  Done.  I'm not  waiting  till \n7 \nFebruary,  and  then  wait  for  another  ruling.  I  just \n8 \nwant  you  to  issue  your  ruling.·  That's  it. \n9 \nTHE  COURT:  Attorney Grosso,  any  comment? \n10 \n11  ATTY.  GROSSO:  The  respond~nt rests. \nTHE  COURT:  All  right.  So  noting  that Mr.  Young \n12 \nhas  indicated  that  he  is  not  planning  or  willing  to \n13 \nprosecute  this  matter  further,  the  Court  has  heard \n14 \nhis  testimony  today.  The  Court  was  allowing Mr. \n15 \nYoung  the  latitude  to  have  two  additional  witnesses \n16 \nand  have  time  for  those·subpoenas  to  be  served. \n17 \nMr.  Young  was  to  receive  the  documentation  from \n18 \nthe  criminal  Clerk's  Office  that  he-- that  the  State \n19 \nagreed  to  provide  him  despite  there  being  no \n20 \nrequirement  to  do  so  under  Practice  Book's  rule  of \n21 \n22  rules. \n23  The  Court  ~ill consider Mr.  Young's  statements \ntoday  as  there  is  desire  to  no  longer  prosecute  this \n24 \nmatter.

In this action, \nPlaintiffs—sentenced and unsentenced people, and an organization of criminal defense \nlawyers—seek intervention from the Court to force the governor and correction \ncommissioner to discharge their statutory and constitutional duties to care for the \nhealth of people in their custody. For weeks, Defendants have known about the looming \nthreat to incarcerated people. While Governor Lamont and Commissioner Cook have \nmade attempts to mitigate the dangers posed by the virus, conditions of confinement in \nprisons prevent them from ensuring the safety and livelihood of thousands of those in \ntheir care. As public health experts indicate, the only feasible way to mitigate the disease \nwithin prison and jails is to take swift action – before the disease hits – to significantly \ndecrease the population in custody so that social distancing may be practiced and at-risk \ngroups are out of harm’s way.  The steps taken by Defendants are insufficient in light of \n1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-8   Filed 05/03/20   Page 3 of 157\nthe grave risks presented by the present crisis, necessitating court intervention through \nthe issuance of mandamus. \n \n \nParties \n1.  Plaintiff Connecticut Criminal Defense Lawyers Association (CCDLA) is a non-\nprofit Connecticut organization comprising lawyers who represent people \naccused of crimes in the state. \n2.  CCDLA has approximately three hundred members statewide. \n3.  Its members represent clients held in each of the facilities controlled by the \nConnecticut Department of Correction (DOC). \n4.  CCDLA engages in education and advocacy for the fair treatment of those accused \nof crimes, and for positive changes in Connecticut’s criminal and motor vehicle \ncode.  CCDLA also serves as an amicus curiae to Connecticut’s appellate courts. \n5.  Plaintiff Willie Breyette is a person incarcerated at MacDougall-Walker \nCorrectional Institution in Suffield.

Beginning in December 2019, cases of viral pneumonia caused by a novel \npathogen occurred in China; the World Health Organization shortly thereafter \nnamed the virus COVID-19. \n12.  The pathogen “is both highly contagious and deadly,” spreading from person to \nperson through “respiratory droplets, close personal contact, and from contact \nwith contaminated surfaces and objects.”  Affidavit of Dr. Jonathan Giftos \n(attached as Exhibit 19) ¶ 5. \n13.  There is no vaccine or cure for the virus; the focus on combatting it “is on \npreventing [its] spread.”  Id. ¶ 6. \n14.  Although the virus is highly dangerous to all humans, the United States Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified particular danger for \n“adults over 60 years old and people with chronic medical conditions,” which \ninclude “lung disease, cancer, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal \ndisease, liver disease, diabetes, immunocompromising conditions, and \npregnancy.”  Id. ¶ 7.   \n3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-8   Filed 05/03/20   Page 5 of 157\n15.  By early March 2020, the virus had spread to the New York City metro area, and \nConnecticut recorded its first diagnosed case. \n16.  On March 10th, defendant Gov. Lamont declared a dual emergency of public \nhealth and civil preparedness until September 2020 on account of the virus.  Gov. \nLamont, Letter to the Secretary of the State (Mar. 10, 2020), available at \nhttps://tinyurl.com/wptdlw6. \n17.  Since then, Governor Lamont has issued eighteen Executive Orders intended to \nprotect public health during the growing pandemic. \n \nThe Governor’s Efforts to Dampen the Spread of the Virus \n18.  Governor Lamont’s Executive Orders have found that COVID-19 “spreads easily \nfrom person to person and may result in serious illness or death,” and that the \n“risk of severe illness and death...appears to be higher for individuals who are 60 \nyears of age or older and for those who have chronic health conditions.”  Gov. \nLamont Exec. Order No. 7 at 1 (Mar. 12, 2020) (Exhibit 1). \n19.  The Executive Orders have also found that there is a dire need for people to keep \na six-foot distance from others in order to staunch the airborne transmission of \nthe disease.  Most recently, the defendant forbade “social and recreational \ngatherings of . . . six (6) or more people.”  Lamont Exec. Order 7N at 4 (Mar. 28, \n2020) (Exhibit 15). \n20.  The defendant has repeatedly highlighted the particular threat COVID-19 poses \nto institutional and congregant housing.  His first order found that “there is an \nincreased risk of rapid spread of COVID-19 among persons who are living in \n4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-8   Filed 05/03/20   Page 6 of 157\ncongregate settings, such as long-term care facilities.”  Lamont Exec. Order No. 7 \nat 1.  \n21.  He later reiterated his findings of the risk posed by congregate settings, adding \nthat such settings include “inpatient or outpatient hospitals, clinics or other \nfacilities for the diagnosis, observation or treatment of persons with psychiatric \nand intellectual disabilities.”  Lamont Exec. Order No. 7C at 2 (Mar. 15, 2020) \n(Exhibit 4). \n22.  On March 28, the defendant again acknowledged public health guidance to \nreduce human density in closed spaces, recognizing that the “Centers for Disease \nControl has recommended that states, especially those with higher rates of \ngrowth in the number of infected people, take measures to reduce density within \nhomeless shelters and other congregant housing situations.”  Lamont Exec. Order \nNo. 7P at 2 (Mar. 28, 2020) (Exhibit 17). \n23.  Governor Lamont has also spoken to the press about the dangers of close quarter \nliving arrangements, in one instance referring to nursing homes as a “petri dish” \nfor the spread of COVID-19.  Patrick Skahill, Connecticut Tracks COVID-19 Cases \nBut Doesn’t Keep Nursing Home Tally, WNPR, Mar. 27, 2020, \nhttps://www.wnpr.org/post/connecticut-tracks-covid-19-cases-doesnt-keep-\nnursing-home-tally. \n24.  As a result of these conclusions, Governor Lamont has restricted entry into \nnursing homes and similar facilities; modified in-person open meetings \nrequirements; closed public schools; prohibited bars and restaurants from \nserving sit-in customers and closed gyms, fitness centers, and movie theaters; \n5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-8   Filed 05/03/20   Page 7 of 157\nclosed malls; postponed the presidential primary; and limited the workplace \noperations of non-essential businesses and non-profits. \n25.  Governor Lamont has implemented similar measures targeted specifically at \ncourts, including suspending certain court operations and authorizing remote \nnotarization.  See Lamont Exec. Order No. 7G at 3-4 (Mar. 19, 2020), (Exhibit 8); \nLamont Exec. Order No. 7Q at 2-3 (Mar. 30, 2020) (Exhibit 18). \n \nThe People in the Defendants’ Custody \n26.  Although Governor Lamont has shown great concern for the general public and \nbusinesses of the state, the interventions he and Commissioner Cook have issued \ndo not adequately protect the people in their custody: those sentenced to \nincarceration, and those being detained before trial. \n27.  As of April 2nd, there were 3,241 people in pre-trial detention, and 8,580 people \nserving sentences of incarceration in Connecticut’s prison system. \n28.  Those figures have not materially changed since the outbreak of the COVID-19 \nvirus in Connecticut.  On January 1, 2020, for example, there were 3,393 people \ndetained prior to trial and 8,891 people serving sentences of incarceration in \nConnecticut’s prison system. \n29.  The threat to the health and lives of Connecticut’s incarcerated population falls \ndisproportionately on Black and Latinx prisoners. \n30.  As of March 1, 2020, Black people comprised 5,349 of the 12,411 people in \nConnecticut’s prisons, or 43.1% of the state’s prison population. \n31.  The 2010 decennial census identified Black people as comprising 11% of \nConnecticut’s population. \n6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-8   Filed 05/03/20   Page 8 of 157\n32.  As of March 1, 2020, Latinx people comprised 3,307 of the 12,411 people in \nConnecticut’s prisons, or 26.7% of the state’s prison population. \n33.  The 2010 decennial census identified Latinx people as comprising 16.5% of \nConnecticut’s population. \n34.  Many people in the defendants’ custody are needlessly facing danger as the \npandemic arrives in Connecticut prisons. \n35.  Approximately 200 people—like Mr. Jones—are being held on a bail of $50,000 \nor less, that is, they are in a highly dangerous congregate living situation for lack \nof the $5,000 or smaller ten percent cash bond. \n36.  Approximately 4,000 of the roughly 12,000 people in Connecticut prisons are \nwithin ninety days of their sentence end, by which time the pandemic is likely to \nbe still raging. \n37.  1,092 are incarcerated for technical violations of parole or probation. \n38.  3,339 are parole-eligible, yet remain within the walls of Connecticut prisons as \nthe pandemic bears down on them. \n39.  In addition, Connecticut’s prison population is aging. 595 of the people in the \nstate custody are age sixty or older like Mr. Johnson, a factor that the CDC has \nidentified as a risk for severe complications from a COVID-19 infection. These \nindividuals pose the least risk to the public, yet are most at risk of serious illness \nor death. \n40.  Many prisoners have compromised immune systems or, like Mr. Breyette, have \nautoimmune disorders also identified by CDC as heightening the risk of a serious \nillness or death from COVID-19. \n \n7 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-8   Filed 05/03/20   Page 9 of 157\nRoutine Prison Conditions Lend Themselves to Rapid Spread of the Virus \n41.  In Connecticut prisons, as elsewhere, people are held in a congregate living \nsituation at least as dense as is found in nursing homes and hospitals. \n42.  Some prisons have dormitory-style housing, like Willard-Cybulski, where Mr. \nJohnson is held.  His dormitory has one hundred men in it, and, in Mr. Johnson’s \nwords, “once the virus comes in, it’s going to spread like wildfire.”  Five prisoners \nat Willard-Cybulski have already tested positive for the pathogen. \n43.  In most other prisons, incarcerated people are held two to a cell in close quarters.  \nSee Second Connecticut Prison Inmate Tests Positive for the COVID-19 Virus, \nNBC Conn., Mar. 31, 2020, \nhttps://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/coronavirus/second-connecticut-prison-\ninmate-tests-positive-for-the-covid-19-virus/2247971/ (reporting that the second \nperson to test positive at Corrigan-Radgowski “was in a two-person cell”). \n44.  In Connecticut prisons as elsewhere, detainees and prisoners do not have the \nability to maintain personal hygiene to the same standards as free people do, \nbecause people in prison must in many cases live in a cell containing a toilet, are \nnot allowed hand sanitizer, have limited access to cleaning supplies and soap, and \nhave no control over disinfecting common areas or commonly touched surfaces. \n45.  Connecticut prisoners, like their counterparts nationwide, are given almost all of \ntheir medical treatment in the same facility in which they are housed, rather than \nin a dedicated medical facility such as a clinic or hospital. \n46.  As a result, “correctional settings increase the risk” of contracting the virus, \nbecause in prison, “there are high numbers of people with chronic, often \nuntreated, illnesses housed in a setting with minimal levels of sanitation, limited \n8 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-8   Filed 05/03/20   Page 10 of 157\naccess to personal hygiene, limited access to medical care, and no possibility of \nstaying at a distance from others,” Giftos Aff. ¶ 8, such that “there are more \npeople susceptible to getting infected congregated together in a context in which \nfighting the spread of an infection is nearly impossible.”  Id. ¶ 9 (emphasis \nadded). \n47.  COVID-19 public health experts have sounded the alarm that prisons are \nextremely high-risk settings for the spread of COVID-19 since the pandemic’s \narrival in the United States.  See Dr. Lipi Roy, Infections And Incarceration: Why \nJails And Prisons Need To Prepare For COVID-19 Now, Forbes, Mar. 11, 2020, \nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/lipiroy/2020/03/11/infections-and-incarceration-\nwhy-jails-and-prisons-need-to-prepare-for-covid-19-stat; Brie Williams et al., \nCorrectional Facilities in the Shadow of COVID-19: Unique Challenges and \nProposed Solutions, Health Affairs, Mar. 26, 2020, \nhttps://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200324.784502/full/ \n(cataloguing the significant differences between combatting the virus inside of \nprison versus outside of it); Timothy Williams, Benjamin Weiser, and William K. \nRashbaum, ‘Jails Are Petri Dishes’: Inmates Freed as the Virus Spreads Behind \nBars, N.Y.

Their warnings have proven tragically accurate.  One week ago, Chicago’s Cook \nCounty Jail had two COVID-19 diagnoses; as of March 30th, 101 incarcerated \n9 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-8   Filed 05/03/20   Page 11 of 157\npeople and 12 staff members have tested positive for the virus.

As of March 29th, 2020, Rikers Island had a COVID-19 infection rate surpassing \nevery country in the world. \n51.  Here in Connecticut, as of April 2, sixteen DOC staff members and eight \nincarcerated people have already tested positive for COVID-19.  Connecticut \nDep’t of Correction, Covid-19 Tracker, https://portal.ct.gov/DOC/Common-\nElements/Common-Elements/Health-Information-and-Advisories (last visited \nApr. 2, 2020). \n10 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-8   Filed 05/03/20   Page 12 of 157\n52.  The trajectory of other correctional systems make clear that Connecticut has \nlimited time to act to prevent the virus from taking over its facilities and \ncontributing the statewide overload on hospital beds.  See Andrew Clark et al, \nOpinion: Prison Outbreak Affects Health of Entire State, Conn. Post, Mar. 31, \n2020 (explaining that, “[a]s jails and prisons become flashpoints for infection, \nthe outbreak will overwhelm already limited state health care resources,” because \ncorrectional facilities are linked to surrounding communities by employees and \ncontractors moving in and out of them); Giftos Aff. ¶ 15 (“Specifically, a surge in \nCOVID-19 infections in a correctional setting could mean that ICU beds in the \ncommunity hospital would no longer be available to everyone who needed \nthem.”).  Other states have concluded that the only effective way to avoid a \nwidespread outbreak in prisons is to reduce the number of people in them.  See \nAppendix (Exhibit 21) (listing representative actions by state courts, as well as \nactions by federal courts in both the criminal and immigration detention \ncontexts); see also Consent Order, In re Request to Commute of Suspend County \nJail Sentences, No. 084230, slip op. at 2 (N.J.

Even prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, Connecticut has long struggled to provide \nsufficient medical services to the people it holds prisoner. Defendants’ medical \nstaff in prisons is now nearly certain to be overrun when the virus begins \nspreading inside the walls. \n54.  In July 2019, the Connecticut Mirror reported that DOC had 309 nurses on staff \nto serve 13,320 prisoners, or one nurse for every 43 prisoners.  For medical \nproviders, including doctors and physician assistants, the DOC employs only one \nfor every 579 prisoners.  Jenna Carlesso and Kelan Lyons, One Year after DOC \nTook Over Inmate Healthcare, Troubles Persist, Conn. Mirror, July 2, 2019, \nhttps://ctmirror.org/2019/07/02/one-year-after-doc-took-over-inmate-health-\ncare-troubles-persist. \n55.  Little has changed since that report.  In early 2020, Cheshire Correctional \nInstitution and Corrigan-Radgowski Correctional Center reported employing \ntwenty-nine and twenty-seven nurses, respectively, or thirty-nine prisoners per \nnurse at Cheshire and forty at Corrigan-Radgowski.  \n56.  Accessing medical doctors at those prisons is difficult: at Cheshire, one \npsychiatrist and one principal physician are the only doctors serving a population \nof 1,131. Corrigan-Radgowski, with a population of 1,083, does not employ a \nsingle physician beyond a staff psychiatrist. \n12 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-8   Filed 05/03/20   Page 14 of 157\n57.  The woeful medical provisions at Cheshire and Corrigan-Radgowski are not \nunique to those prisons. \n58.  In February of this year, Commissioner Rollin Cook told members of the Black \nand Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus that there were 139 healthcare positions \nvacant out of 843 budgeted.  Lisa Backus, Staffing Shortage Creates ‘Dangerous’ \nSituation in CT Prisons, Conn. Post, Feb. 3, 2020, \nhttps://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Staffing-shortage-creates-dangerous-\n15027264.php. \n59.  This month, a DOC spokesperson suggested that facilities can manage shortages \nby scheduling medical employees for twelve hours at a time in an emergency.  \nKelan Lyons, Elderly Prisoners in Connecticut Vulnerable to Potential \nCoronavirus Outbreak, Hartford Courant, Mar. 11, 2020, \nhttps://www.courant.com/coronavirus/hc-pol-coronavirus-connecticut-prisons-\n20200311-ote3jd6orje77ipl44qgi3bb6i-story.html \n60.  However, the Connecticut Mirror reported that healthcare staff were already \nlogging what would appear to be the maximum possible overtime before the \npandemic, sometimes staying on shift for sixteen to twenty-four hours a day.  \nCarlesso and Lyons, supra ¶ 54. \n61.  And, as of a month ago, head nurses, nurses, and licensed nurse practitioners \nwere among the twenty top wage earners in the DOC based on their overtime pay; \nat least three nursing staff were making twice their annual pay in overtime.  \nBackus, supra ¶ 58. \n62.  That the DOC is over 100 staff short to provide for ordinary healthcare needs at \nits facilities is alarming, because retirees and medical students are already being \n13 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-8   Filed 05/03/20   Page 15 of 157\ncalled to aid overwhelmed medical staff in regions where COVID-19 is rampant.  \nSelena Simmons Duffin, States Get Creative to Find and Deploy More Workers \nin COVID-19 Fight, NPR, Mar. 25, 2020, https://www.npr.org/sections/health-\nshots/2020/03/25/820706226/states-get-creative-to-find-and-deploy-more-\nhealth-workers-in-covid-19-fight. \n63.  DOC medical staff have sounded the alarm about possible systemic failure. Dr. \nGerald Valletta, the primary physician at Garner and Manson Youth Institution \nin Cheshire, told the Courant that “[t]he more people get sick and call out, the \nmore burdened staff will be. We were already facing a huge shortage.”   Eliza \nFawcett, With COVID-19 Threat Looming, State Prisons and Jails are on Edge, \nHartford Courant, Mar, 28, 2020, https://www.courant.com/coronavirus/hc-\nnews-coronavirus-connecticut-prisons-20200328-pvg57sfcafh5zck4wftabooxre-\nstory.html. \n64.  Debra Cruz, head nurse at Cheshire, expressed similar concerns, suggesting that \neven mandating 16-hour shifts, as permitted in the workers’ contract, would not \nguarantee adequate healthcare. “We’re all just holding our breaths and hoping \nthis passes us by,” the Hartford Courant quotes Cruz as saying on March 11.  \nLyons, supra ¶ 59. \n   \nDespite Their Efforts to Mitigate the Pandemic’s Impact, Defendants Have \nNot Demonstrated Ability to Prevent and Treat the Virus in Prisons \n \n65.  The risk to incarcerated people is heightened by DOC’s inadequate response to \nCOVID-19 and its facilities’ lack of capacity to safely house people at current \ndensities. \n14 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-8   Filed 05/03/20   Page 16 of 157\n66.  Initially, DOC’s only plan to address COVID-19 was a repurposed 2007 policy for \nflu outbreaks, see Connecticut Dep’t of Correction, Pandemic Influenza Response \nPlan (February 14, 2007), available at https://portal.ct.gov/-\n/media/DOC/Pdf/Coronavirus-3-20/A-7-02a-Pandemic-Influenza-response-\nplan.pdf, despite the fact that COVID-19 is understood to be transmitted more \neasily and in different ways than flu.  See, e.g., Johns Hopkins Hosp., \nCoronavirus Disease 2019 vs. the Flu, \nhttps://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-\ndiseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-disease-2019-vs-the-flu (accessed Mar. 30, \n2020) (reporting that, unlike influenza, COVID-19 may “spread through the \nairborne route, meaning that tiny droplets remaining in the air could cause \ndisease in others even after the ill person is no longer near”). \n67.  On March 11th, spokesperson Karen Martucci doubled down on the outdated \nplan in a press interview.  “This isn’t new for us. We quarantine for the flu every \nyear,” she said. “We didn’t have to create a pandemic plan. This was already \ncreated.”  Lyons, supra ¶ 59. \n68.  Though the 2007 plan has now been replaced online with one specific to the \ncurrent pandemic, the DOC’s preventative measures are insufficient to stop the \nvirus once inside prison walls.  \n69.  For example, the DOC’s plan permits recreation and programming to take place \nin groups of up to fifty incarcerated people, ten times the number of people \npermitted by the Governor’s executive order.  Compare Conn. Dep’t of \nCorrection, COVID-19 Operational Response Plan 1 (Mar. 20, 2020), available \n15 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-8   Filed 05/03/20   Page 17 of 157\nat https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/DOC/Pdf/Coronavirus-3-20/Covid-19-\nOperational-Response-Plan.pdf with Lamont Exec. Order 7N at 4. \n70.  However, the sanitation practices inside prisons continues to be woefully \ninsufficient in light of the danger posed by coronavirus.  Prisoners in certain \nfacilities do not have adequate access to soap. Corrections staff are not wearing \nmasks or gloves, and prisoners are given supplies with which to disinfect their \ncells only once a week.  Common areas and showers are being cleaned only once a \nday. \n71.  In addition, though everyone entering a Connecticut correctional facility must \nhave a wellness screening, including a temperature check, recent data suggests \nthat around 60% of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic.  Jane Qiu, Covert \nCoronavirus Infections Could Be Seeding New Outbreaks, Nature, Mar. 20, \n2020, available at https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00822-x.  As a \nresult, fevers are not be a reliable indicator of whether someone is a carrier. \n72.  The prevalence of symptomatic and pre-symptomatic COVID-19 carriers also \nbelie the claim, made by both the defendant and his Department of Correction, \nthat moving prisoners around inside the same sealed buildings will prevent the \nspread of infection.  Asked about prisoner releases in response to COVID-19, a \nDOC spokeswoman claimed, “Overcrowding is not a concern for our agency. We \nhave space to use.”  Lyons, supra ¶ 59. \n73.  On March 24th Governor Lamont refused to consider releasing anyone in his \ncustody but offered that “[w]e are going to do everything we can to make sure \nthat anybody who may be at risk of being a carrier is segregated or quarantined in \na separate area.”  Kelan Lyons, Lamont Says No Prison Releases Because of \n16 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-8   Filed 05/03/20   Page 18 of 157\nCOVID-19 Despite Pressure From Advocates, Conn. Mirror, Mar. 24, 2020, \nhttps://ctmirror.org/2020/03/24/lamont-says-no-prison-releases-because-of-\ncovid-19-despite-pressure-from-advocates. \n74.  At MacDougall-Walker, where Mr. Breyette is confined, staff have cleared a space \nfor quarantine: “seg,” or the restrictive housing unit where prisoners are placed \nas punishment. \n75.  At Osborn, where Mr. Rodriguez is confined, some prisoners work in a factory \nmaking filter masks for healthcare providers, but are not given any additional cell \ndisinfection time or materials. \n76.  Even when carriers are successfully identified and quarantined, additional space \nwithin a prison does not address the threat of airborne diseases within sealed \nbuildings; the CDC has emphasized that heating, ventilating, and air conditioning \nsystems can transmit particles of highly infectious diseases.  U.S. Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, \nPrevention and Control of Tuberculosis in Correctional and Detention Facilities: \nRecommendations from CDC (July 7, 2006), available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5509a1.htm. \n77.  It is therefore unrealistic to think that “screening, social distancing, and \nquarantining measures can be sufficiently employed within correctional settings \nto combat the spread of COVID-19,” Giftos Aff. ¶ 16, because “[t]here are too \nmany structural limitations, and correctional health care can only do so much.”  \nId. ¶ 17. \n78.  “Decreasing the incarcerated population so that there is more ability to physically \ndistance within the facility, fewer people who can contract the virus inside the \n17 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-8   Filed 05/03/20   Page 19 of 157\nfacility, and more medical care for those who need it is the only way to prevent \nthe complications from surging.”  Id. ¶ 18. \n \nThe Defendants’ Unmet Obligations to the People in Their Custody \n79.  During a declared civil preparedness emergency like the current COVID-19 one, \nthe governor is required to “take appropriate measures for protecting the health \nand safety of inmates of state institutions . . . .”  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 28-9(b)(5). \n80.  At all times, the commissioner is required to “provide for the relief of any sick or \ninfirm prisoner . . . .”  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 18-7. \n81.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, and at all other times, the defendants bear the \nduty to refrain from depriving anyone of sanitation or medical care on the basis \nof their “race, color, ancestry, or national origin.”  Conn. Const. art. 1, § 20. \n82.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, and at all other times, the defendants bear the \nduty to refrain from cruelly and unusually punishing sentenced prisoners of the \nState in contravention of the Connecticut and United States Constitutions by \nfailing to provide adequate sanitation and medical care. \n83.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, and at all other times, the defendants bear the \nduty to refrain from punishing pre-trial detainees of the State through lack of \nsanitation or medical care, since by virtue of their presumed innocence any such \ndeprivation contravenes the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution. \n84.  Defendants’ interventions to date are commendable, but unfortunately \ninsufficient to comply with their constitutional and statutory obligation to ensure \nthe safety of those in their custody. Because the conditions of confinement in \n18 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-8   Filed 05/03/20   Page 20 of 157\nConnecticut prisons leave prisoners in a highly dangerous congregate living \nsituation certain to result in widespread COVID-19 infection, court action is \nnecessary for defendants to execute their non-discretionary duties with respect to \nthe sanitation and medical care of the prisoners and detainees in their custody.. \n \nRequest for Relief \n85.  For such reasons stated above, the Court should issue a writ of mandamus \ncompelling the defendants to: \n(a) immediately release all people having the CDC heightened risk factors for \nserious illness or death from COVID-19, directly to a hospital or \nappropriate medical facility where necessary; \n(b) immediately reduce the population density at each and every facility in \nwhich they confine people, including by: \n(1)  releasing all pre-trial detainees facing misdemeanor charges or \ndetained subject to a bond of $50,000 or less; \n(2)  immediately release to transitional supervision all those eligible for \nsuch; \n(3)  immediately release to home confinement those eligible for such \npursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. § 18-100h; \n(4)  immediately release those currently incarcerated only for a \ntechnical violation of their parole or probation; \n(5)  immediately release on furlough all prisoners who are within six \nmonths of their end of sentence; \n(c) submit for the Court’s review a plan: \n19 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-8   Filed 05/03/20   Page 21 of 157\n(1)  to provide adequate sanitation and social distancing in prisons, \n(2)  to diagnose and treat people showing symptoms of COVID-19 in \naccordance with contemporary standards of care, \n(3)  to approve, within seven days, community or private residences to \nthose qualified for release to such via Conn. Gen. Stat. § 18-100, \n(4)  to approve, within seven days, residences for any prisoner or \ndetainee who is now eligible for release but for the defendant’s \napproval of a residence, and \n(5)  to sufficiently fund transitional housing for the duration of the \npandemic; and \n(d) undertake any other task necessary to discharge their duties to those in \ntheir custody during the pandemic. \n \n \n \n \n \n_  /s/ Dan Barrett__ \nDan Barrett (# 437438) \nElana Bildner (# 438603) \nACLU Foundation of Connecticut \n765 Asylum Avenue \nHartford, CT 06105 \n(860) 471-8471 \ne-filings@acluct.org \n \n \nHope Metcalf (# 424312) \nAllard K.

NO. 31), MOTION FOR \nJOINDER (DOC. NO. 35), AND MOTION TO AMEND COMPLAINT (DOC. NO. 36)  \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiff Tiana Laboy (“Laboy”) gave birth at the York Correctional Institution in \nFebruary, 2018, while in in the custody of the Department of Correction (“DOC”).  In \nMarch, 2019, Laboy and her daughter, Baby N., through her guardian, filed the \nComplaint (“Compl.”) (Doc. No. 1), alleging, inter alia, that staff and supervisors at the \nDOC acted with deliberate indifference to their medical needs.   \nSeveral motions are pending before this court.  This Ruling addresses the \ndefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 31), the plaintiffs’ Motion to \nAmend the Complaint (Doc. No. 36), and the plaintiff’s Motion for Joinder (Doc. No. 35).    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCCasaes e3 :32:01-9c-vc-v0-00503340-7J-BJCA H   D  oDcoucmumenetn 3t 45-51 2   F  iFleilde d1 20/50/50/31/92 0   P  aPgaeg e2  3o fo 1f 415\nII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Facts1 \nTiana Laboy has been incarcerated at the York Correctional Institute (“York”) \nsince August 15, 2017.  Defendants’ Statement of Material Facts (“Defts.’ Stat.”) (Doc. \nNo. 31-2) ¶ 1; Plaintiffs’ Statement of Material Facts (“Pls.’ Statement of Facts”) (Doc. \nNo. 54-1) ¶ 1.  When she was first admitted to York Correctional Institute, Laboy was \nabout eight weeks pregnant.  Id.2  Laboy received some medical care for her pregnancy \nat York, id. ¶ 2.  The gravamen of the Complaint is that care was inadequate in the days \nleading up to the birth of her child.  See Compl. (Doc. No. 1).  \nSpecifically, the Complaint alleges that, although Laboy experienced pain and \nvaginal discharge for several days in early February 2018, and informed York medical \nstaff of her symptoms, medical and correctional staff failed to provide medical care.  \nCompl. ¶¶ 53-58.  On one occasion, Laboy was told she could not be seen by medical \nstaff because she had not completed the appropriate medical form.  Id. ¶ 55.  A few \ndays later, she was told she should return if and when her contractions were less than \ntwo minutes apart.  Id. ¶¶ 58.  Finally, after she spent the night of February 13, 2018, \n                                                           \n1 With the Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 31), the defendants filed a Statement of \nMaterial Facts pursuant to Local Rule 56(a) (Doc. No. 31-2).  Some of the facts presented there are \nadmitted by the plaintiffs in their Statement of Material Facts in response.  See Plaintiffs’ Statement of \nMaterial Facts (Doc. No. 54-1).  The undisputed facts are taken from the Defendant’s Local Rule 56(a)(1) \nStatement and the plaintiffs’ Local Rule 56(a)(2) Statement.  Unless otherwise noted, Laboy admits to the \nfacts as stated.  \nBecause the defendants’ Local Rule 56(a)(2) Statement of Facts relates solely to the issue of \nexhaustion, this section also includes facts as alleged in the first Complaint, which provide context for the \ncourt’s discussion of the proposed Amended Complaint.  The court does not rely on any facts in the \nComplaint that are not included in the Defendant’s Local Rule 56(a)(1) Statement of Facts or the plaintiffs’ \nLocal Rule 56(a)(2) statement in its discussion of the Motion for Summary Judgment.   \n2 Tianna Laboy was initially admitted to York as a pretrial detainee.  Laboy was sentenced on \nOctober 18, 2018, and is serving that sentence at York.  See Department of Correction Inmate \nInformation, http://www.ctinmateinfo.state.ct.us/ detailsupv.asp?id_inmt_num=417372.  \n2 \n \n\nCCasaes e3 :32:01-9c-vc-v0-00503340-7J-BJCA H   D  oDcoucmumenetn 3t 45-51 2   F  iFleilde d1 20/50/50/31/92 0   P  aPgaeg e3  4o fo 1f 415\nlying awake in pain, Laboy requested medical attention at 4:30am, and was told the \ndoctor would see her at 7:30.  Id. ¶ 61.  Around 6:30 am that day, Laboy delivered her \nchild into a toilet at the prison.  Id. ¶ 64-66.   \nAn ambulance took Laboy and her baby to Lawrence and Memorial Hospital, \nwhere Laboy was shackled to a bed by her ankles for the duration of her four-day stay.  \nId. ¶ 75.  After Laboy returned to York, she met with Commissioner Scott Semple, who \napologized for her treatment and informed her that medical staff, who had been working \nthe night between February 12 and February 13, had been “walked out.”  Id. ¶ 113;  see \nalso Pl.’s Stat. ¶ 17.   \nDuring her orientation, Laboy was informed about York’s administrative remedies \nprocess.  Pls.’ Stat. ¶ 13.  Nonetheless, the defendants state that, between August 17, \n2018, and March 31, 2018, Laboy filed no grievances related to her treatment at York.  \nDefs.’ Stat. ¶ 8, 12.  Laboy denies this statement, saying that she “filed a grievance or \nan appeal or a document of some sort expressing dissatisfaction with treatment in \nprison” because she appealed a ticket during her pregnancy.  Pls.’ Stat. ¶ 8, 12.   \nB.  Procedural History \nLaboy filed the Complaint in March 2019.  Pls.’ Statement of Facts ¶ 4.  The \nComplaint named as defendants Scott Semple, Commissioner of the DOC; Dr. Nelson, \nMedical Director for York; Dr. Tricia Machinski, OB/GYN specialist at York; Warden \nAntonio Santiago; and four John or Jane Doe defendants, two of whom are members of \nthe medical staff and two of whom are correctional officers (collectively, “the \ndefendants”).  See Compl. at 1.  The Complaint includes 393 paragraphs, spanning \nover 65 pages.  Much of the Complaint’s length can be attributed to the plaintiffs’ \ndecision to include over twenty counts, which fall into five general categories: (1) eight \n3 \n \n\nCCasaes e3 :32:01-9c-vc-v0-00503340-7J-BJCA H   D  oDcoucmumenetn 3t 45-51 2   F  iFleilde d1 20/50/50/31/92 0   P  aPgaeg e4  5o fo 1f 415\ncounts, each corresponding to a different defendant, alleging that the defendant was \ndeliberately indifferent to Tianna Laboy’s medical needs in violation of the Eighth and \nFourteenth Amendments; (2) two counts of state-law negligence; (3) three counts \nalleging that Baby N. had been falsely imprisoned in violation of the Fourth Amendment; \n(4) seven counts, each corresponding to a different defendant, alleging that the \ndefendant had been deliberately indifferent to Baby N.’s medical needs in violation of \nthe Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments; and (5) two counts asserting supervisory \nliability against defendant Semple.  \nIn the eight months since the Complaint was filed, the parties have submitted \nnumerous filings.  The defendants filed their Answer (Doc. No. 18), with affirmative \ndefenses, in late June, and their Motion for Summary Judgment (“Mot. for Summ. J.”) \n(Doc. No. 31), on August 28.  The plaintiffs, on August 30, filed three motions: (1) a \nmotion challenging the designation of discovery materials as “confidential,”  see Motion \n(Doc. No. 32); (2) the Motion for Joinder of defendants identified through discovery \n(Doc. No. 35); and (3) the Motion to Amend the Complaint (Doc. No. 36).  Also pending \nare several Motions to Seal.  See Motion to Seal (Doc. No. 33) (moving to seal motion \nchallenging “confidential” designation); Motion to Seal (Doc. No. 37) (moving to seal \nproposed Amended Complaint).  The defendants oppose the Motion to Amend the \nComplaint.  See Defendants’ Memorandum in Opposition to Motion to Amend (“Defs.’ \nMem. in Opp. to Mot. to Amend”) (Doc. No. 47).  The plaintiffs have filed an Opposition \nto the Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 51), which they have also Moved to \nSeal (Doc. No. 52).  The court has granted multiple extensions of time to both sides.  \nSee, e.g., Order (Doc. No. 26) (extending time for the plaintiffs to Amend the Complaint \n4 \n \n\nCCasaes e3 :32:01-9c-vc-v0-00503340-7J-BJCA H   D  oDcoucmumenetn 3t 45-51 2   F  iFleilde d1 20/50/50/31/92 0   P  aPgaeg e5  6o fo 1f 415\nand the defendants to respond to discovery); Order (Doc. No. 43) (extending time for \nplaintiffs to respond to the Motion for Summary Judgment); Order (Doc. No. 45) \n(extending time for defendants to respond to Motion to Amend Complaint).   \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  Motion to Amend Complaint \n1.  Standard of Review \nFirst, the court considers the Motion to Amend the Complaint (Doc. No. 36), \nwhich the defendants oppose (Doc. No. 47).  Because Laboy filed the Motion to Amend \nthe Complaint within the—extended—deadline set by this court in its Scheduling Order, \nthat Motion is governed by the liberal standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a).  \nPursuant to Rule 15(a), a party may amend its pleading with the court’s leave, and “[t]he \ncourt should freely give leave when justice so requires.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15.  As the \nSupreme Court explained in Foman v. Davis,  \nIf the underlying facts or circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a \nproper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded an opportunity to test his \nclaim on the merits.  In the absence of any apparent or declared reason—\nsuch as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, \nrepeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, \nundue  prejudice  to  the  opposing  party  by  virtue  of  allowance  of  the \namendment, futility of amendment, etc.—the leave sought should, as the \nrules require, be “freely given.” \nFoman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962);  see also Agerbrink v. Model Serv. LLC, 155 \nF. Supp. 3d 448, 452 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (“Under this liberal standard, a motion to amend \nshould be denied only if the moving party has unduly delayed or acted in bad faith, the \nopposing party will be unfairly prejudiced if leave is granted, or the proposed \namendment is futile.”)  The Second Circuit has referred to prejudice as among the “most \nimportant” reasons to deny leave to amend.  AEP Energy Servs. Gas Holding Co. v. \n5 \n \n\nCCasaes e3 :32:01-9c-vc-v0-00503340-7J-BJCA H   D  oDcoucmumenetn 3t 45-51 2   F  iFleilde d1 20/50/50/31/92 0   P  aPgaeg e6  7o fo 1f 415\nBank of Am., N.A., 626 F.3d 699, 725 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting State Teachers Ret. Bd. v. \nFluor Corp., 654 F.2d 843, 856 (2d Cir. 1981)). \n2.  Analysis  \nThe defendants do not argue that there has been “undue delay” or that Laboy \nhad a “dilatory motive,”  Foman, 371 U.S. at 182.  Nor have there been “repeated \nfailure[s] to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed,”  id., as this is the \nplaintiffs’ first proposed Amended Complaint.  Therefore, of the Foman factors—which \nare not exhaustive—the defendants are left with two potential arguments why this court \nshould deny leave to amend: “undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of \nallowance of the amendment” or “futility of amendment.”  Id.   \nThe defendants do not argue that they would be unduly prejudiced by the \nproposed amendments.  See Defs.’ Mem. in Opp. to Mot. to Amend.  The court agrees \nwith Laboy and Baby N. that allowing leave to amend would not unduly prejudice the \ndefendants.  See Pl.’s Mem. in Support of Mot. to Amend (Doc. No. 36-1) at 4.  \n“Amendment may be prejudicial when, among other things, it would ‘require the \nopponent to expend significant additional resources to conduct discovery and prepare \nfor trial’ or ‘significantly delay the resolution of the dispute.’”  AEP Energy Servs., 626 \nF.3d at 725–26 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Fluor Corp., 654 F.2d at 856); see also Solomon \nv. Adderley Industries, Inc., 960 F. Supp. 2d 502, 508 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (“[The defendant] \nwill not have to expend significant additional resources because the same claims in the \noriginal complaint are being alleged against the new parties and further (limited) \ndiscovery itself is not an adequate ground to deny an amendment to a complaint.”) \n(citations omitted).  Here, although the Amended Complaint adds additional detail, it \ndoes not include any new claims based on facts of which the defendants were not \n6 \n \n\nCCasaes e3 :32:01-9c-vc-v0-00503340-7J-BJCA H   D  oDcoucmumenetn 3t 45-51 2   F  iFleilde d1 20/50/50/31/92 0   P  aPgaeg e7  8o fo 1f 415\naware at the time the initial Complaint was filed.3  The parties have until April of 2020 to \ncomplete discovery, and the court sees no reason why the additional proposed \namendments would delay the resolution of the dispute.   \nRather than arguing that they would be prejudiced by the amendment, the \ndefendants argue that the Proposed Amended Complaint fails to comply with Rule 8 of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and that amendment would be futile.  Def’s. Mem. \nin Opp. to Mot. to Amend at 4, 7.  Regarding Rule 8, the court agrees with the \ndefendants that the proposed Amended Complaint does not comply with Rule 8’s \nrequirement that pleadings contain a “short and plain” statement of the grounds for the \ncourt's jurisdiction, the claim, and a demand for the relief sought.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8.  \nHowever, the court is not aware of any cases suggesting that leave to amend—which, \nas discussed, is analyzed under the liberal standard of Rule 15—should be denied \nwhere a complaint is unnecessarily prolix.  Salahuddin v. Cuomo, 861 F.2d 40 (2d. Cir. \n1988), on which defendants rely, considered whether a court could dismiss an unusually \n“prolix” complaint for noncompliance with Rule 8 without granting leave to amend.  \nSalahuddin, 861 F.2d at 43.  On the facts before it, the Second Circuit concluded that \ndismissing without leave to amend was an abuse of the district court’s discretion.  Id.  \nThe Second Circuit did not consider whether it would be an abuse of discretion for a \n                                                           \n3 The proposed Amended Complaint makes several changes.  It eliminates some of the prolixity \nof the Initial Complaint by removing the state-law negligence claims and removing all claims against \ndefendants Nelson and Santiago.  See Proposed Am. Compl. (Doc. No. 39-1) at 1, 39.    It also replaces \nthe unnamed defendants previously identified as John or Jane Doe with Correctional Officer Alberto Ortiz, \nCorrectional Officer Silvia Surreira, Registered Nurse Michelle Fiala, and Registered Nurse Brianna \nSimmons.  Id. at 1.  Throughout, the proposed Amended Complaint includes additional detail, including, \ninter alia, several additional paragraphs listing Correctional Managed Health Care or DOC policy with \nwhich medical staff and correctional officers failed to comply, id. ¶¶ 38-55; additional allegations about the \nactions medical staff did not take in the days leading up to Baby N.’s birth,  id. ¶¶ 61-62, 64, 70; \ndescriptions of the Security Division Investigation conducted after Baby N.’s birth, id. ¶¶ 115-21; and \nadditional information about a consent decree that has been in place since 1988, id. ¶¶ 122-139.   \n7 \n \n\nCCasaes e3 :32:01-9c-vc-v0-00503340-7J-BJCA H   D  oDcoucmumenetn 3t 45-51 2   F  iFleilde d1 20/50/50/31/92 0   P  aPgaeg e8  9o fo 1f 415\ndistrict court to deny leave to amend to avoid unwanted detail.  Finding no authority to \ndo so, and in light of Rule 15’s liberal standard that leave should be “freely given,” the \ncourt will not deny leave to amend on the ground that the proposed Amended Complaint \nis unnecessarily long.4    \nThe court also declines to deny leave to amend on futility grounds.  The \ndefendants argue that the proposed amendments to the Complaint are futile because: \n(1) Tianna Laboy has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies; (2) government \nofficials, namely defendant Semple, may not be held liable under section 1983 for the \nconduct of their subordinates under a theory of respondeat superior; and (3) the \ndefendants are entitled to qualified immunity.  Def’s. Mem. in Opp. to Mot. to Amend at \n7-13.  In the court’s view, the supervisory liability and qualified immunity arguments \nwould be better addressed on a motion to dismiss.  Denying leave to amend will not \nchange the underlying allegations in the first Complaint, which could still be subject to \ndismissal for failure to establish supervisory liability or on qualified immunity grounds.  \nAny discussion of supervisory liability or qualified immunity at this stage would simply \nforeshadow how this court would rule if a motion to dismiss were before it and would \nneed to be repeated if such a motion were filed.  Therefore, the court will not address \nqualified immunity or supervisory liability here.  To the extent that the defendants argue \n                                                           \n4 The defendants also suggest that the “unnecessary and immaterial allegations” in the proposed \namended complaint “should be stricken.”  Defs.’ Mem. at 6.  The defendants can raise this argument in a \nMotion to Strike, which, following Second Circuit caselaw, the court will grant if there is no admissible \n“evidence in support of the allegation,”  Lipsky v. Commonwealth United Corp., 551 F.2d 887, 893 (2d \nCir.1976), the allegations “have no bearing on the issues in the case,” and “permit[ting] the allegations to \nstand would result in prejudice to the movant.”  Tucker v. American Intern. Group, Inc., 936 F. Supp. 2d 1 \n(D. Conn. 2013) (citations omitted).  \n8 \n \n\nCaCsaes 3e: 230:1-c9v-c-0v0-0503340-J7B-JAC  H D  o Dcuomcuemnet n3t4 5-152     F Filieledd 1 025/0/053/1/290     P Paaggee 9 1 o0f  o1f4 15\nthat the amendments are futile because Laboy has failed to exhaust her remedies, the \ncourt directs the parties to its discussion of the exhaustion requirement, infra at 8-13.  \nIn summary, pursuant to the liberal standard of Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure, this court must give leave to amend “freely” when justice so allows.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 15.  Because the defendants would not be prejudiced by the amendment \nof the Complaint, and because defendants’ arguments regarding supervisory liability \nand qualified immunity are better addressed in a dispositive motion, the court grants \nthe plaintiffs’ Motion to Amend the Complaint (Doc. No. 36). \nB.  Motion for Joinder \nThe plaintiffs have also filed a Motion for Joinder (Doc. No. 35), seeking to join \nCorrectional Officer Alberto Ortiz, Correctional Officer Silvia Surreira, Registered Nurse \nMichelle Fiala, and Registered Nurse Brianna Simmons to “replace” the unnamed John \nand Jane Doe defendants in the Complaint.  Mot. for Joinder at 3-4.  As the court has \ngranted the plaintiffs’ Motion to Amend (Doc. No. 36), which substitutes Ortiz, Surreira, \nFiala, and Simmons for the unnamed parties, the Motion for Joinder is granted.  \nC.  Motion for Summary Judgment \n1.  Standard of Review \nIn the Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 31), the defendants argue that \nLaboy is prohibited from bringing this action because she has not exhausted her \nadministrative remedies pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”).  Mot. for \nSumm. J. at 1.  A motion for summary judgment may be granted only where the moving \nparty can establish that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that it is \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Anderson v. Liberty \nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256 (1986); Wright v. N.Y. State Dep't of Corr., 831 F.3d 64, \n9 \n \n\nCCasaes e3 :32:01-9c-vc-v0-00503340-7J-BJAC H   D  oDcoucmumenetn 3t 45-51 2   F  iFleilde d1 20/50/50/31/92 0   P  aPgaeg e1 01 1o fo 1f 415\n71–72 (2d Cir. 2016).  The court “resolve[s] all ambiguities and draw all inferences in \nfavor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.”  LaFond v. Gen. Physics \nServs. Corp., 50 F.3d 165, 175 (2d Cir. 1995). \n2.  Analysis \nPursuant to the PLRA, an individual must exhaust “‘such administrative remedies \nas are available’ before bringing suit to challenge prison conditions.”  Ross v. Blake, 136 \nS.C.t 1850, 1854 (2016) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a)).  The crux of the dispute \nbetween the parties here is whether an administrative remedy was “available.” \nIn a similar case, the Seventh Circuit concluded that a woman could sue the staff \nat an Illinois county jail for deliberate indifference to her need for proper prenatal care \nand prompt transport to a hospital for delivery, regardless of the fact that she had not \nexhausted the administrative procedure for a remedy.  See White v. Bukowski, 800 F.3d \n392 (7th Cir. 2015).  In White, the plaintiff was almost eight months pregnant when she \nwas first detained in jail.  800 F.3d at 394.  When she went into labor, she was taken to \nthe hospital and delivered her baby, who suffered from birth defects.  Id.  The mother \nlater sued jail staff for failing to take a proper medical history, failing to respond to her \nrequests for medical assistance, and for failing to react quickly enough when she went \ninto labor.  Id.  The District Judge dismissed the suit for failure to exhaust available \nadministrative remedies.  Id. at 393.  On review, the Seventh Circuit began by noting \nthat “[t]he purpose of a prisoner’s filing a grievance is to obtain a change of some sort—\nto obtain better medical care, for example.”  White, 800 F.3d at 394.  For White, \nhowever, no such change was possible:  \n[S]uppose the plaintiff had suspected that [her child’s birth defects] were \nattributable to a mistreatment that she had received in the jail . . . What good \n10 \n \n\nCCasaes e3 :32:01-9c-vc-v0-00503340-7J-BJAC H   D  oDcoucmumenetn 3t 45-51 2   F  iFleilde d1 20/50/50/31/92 0   P  aPgaeg e1 11 2o fo 1f 415\nwould it have done her to file a grievance? She wasn’t about to become \npregnant again . . . could she have gained from filing a grievance?  \nId. at 394-95.  Stressing section 1997e(a)’s rule that no action can be brought “until \nsuch administrative remedies as are available are exhausted,”  id. at 395, the Seventh \nCircuit reasoned that, “if one has no remedy, one has no duty to exhaust remedies.”  Id.  \nIn its view, the caselaw suggested that “a grievance must be filed” under section 1997e \n“as long as there is something the jail or prison could do in response to a grievance.”  \nId.  After the plaintiff gave birth, there was “no remedy within the power of the jail to \ngrant,” and thus, section 1997e’s exhaustion requirement did not apply to require \ndismissal.  Id.  This reasoning aligns with the Second Circuit’s reasoning in Abney v. \nMcGinnis, 380 F.3d 663 (2d Cir. 2004), in which the Second Circuit explained that the \nPLRA requires exhaustion of only those remedies that are “available” to the inmate, that \nis, that afford the possibility of some relief for the action of which the individual \ncomplains.  Abney, 380 F.3d at 667 (quoting Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731 (2001)).  \nWhite was decided a year before the Supreme Court’s decision in Ross v. Blake, \n136 S.C.t 1850, 1857 (2016).  In Ross, the Court held that the statutory text and history \nof the PLRA’s exhaustion requirement foreclose “special circumstances” exceptions to \nthe exhaustion requirement.  However, as the Ross Court explained, “the PLRA \ncontains its own, textual exception to mandatory exhaustion”: an individual “must \nexhaust available remedies, but need not exhaust unavailable ones.”  Ross, 136 S. Ct. \nat 1859.  Thus, although Ross forecloses “special circumstances” exceptions, it does \nnot foreclose the application of White in this case, because White focused on the \n“availability” of a remedy.  See generally White, 800 F.3d at 395-396 (repeatedly \nemphasizing that a prisoner must exhaust “administrative remedies as are available” \n11 \n \n\nCCasaes e3 :32:01-9c-vc-v0-00503340-7J-BJAC H   D  oDcoucmumenetn 3t 45-51 2   F  iFleilde d1 20/50/50/31/92 0   P  aPgaeg e1 21 3o fo 1f 415\nand that there were no remedies available to a prisoner who had already given birth); \nDoe v. County of Milwaukee, 14-cv-200 (JPS), 2017 WL 1843262, at *7 (D. Wis. May 5, \n2017) (concluding that “Ross leaves room for White” and applying White to deny \nsummary judgment).5  Indeed Ross recognizes the PLRA’s exhaustion requirement \ndoes not apply to “unavailable remedies.”  136 S. Ct. at 1859.   \nIn support of their Motion for Summary Judgment, the defendants argue only that \nadministrative remedies were available because York’s grievance procedures were “not \nso opaque” that Laboy could not understand them.  Defs.’ Mem. in Support of Mot. for \nSumm. J. (Doc. No. 31-1) at 11 (citing Riles v. Buchanan, 656 Fed. App’x 577, 581 (2d \nCir. 2016)).  However, an administrative remedy may be “unavailable” even in cases \nwhere the plaintiff clearly understands the administrative process.  See, e.g., Ross, 136 \nS. Ct. at 1859-60 (discussing three scenarios in which relief may be unavailable, \nincluding where the process is too opaque, as well as cases in which administrators \nthwart inmates from using the process through misrepresentation and cases where the \nprocess, though clear, is a “dead end”).   \n                                                           \n5 Nor does White conflict with Second Circuit precedent.  In White, the Seventh Circuit \ndistinguished Ruggiero v. County of Orange, 467 F.3d 170 (2d Cir. 2006), a Second Circuit case that held \nthat the plaintiff had not exhausted his remedies and rejected his arguments that he should be excused \nfrom doing so either because he ultimately received the relief he requested—a transfer to another \nfacility—or because he was not provided with an inmate handbook.  Ruggiero, 467 F.3d at 176.  Ruggiero \nis distinguishable from this case, as well, because Ruggiero’s claims arose out of “several incidents in \nwhich . . . correctional officers . . . employed excessive force against him” over the course of a year.  Id. at \n172.  After those incidents, but before Ruggiero’s case was decided, the Supreme Court made clear that \nexhaustion was required even where the claim related to a single instance of mistreatment.  Id. at 173 \n(citing Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516 (2002)).  The Second Circuit reasoned that, for Ruggiero, additional \nrelief, such as a change in policy or disciplinary actions against the relevant officers, was available.  Thus, \nthe exhaustion requirement applied.  Id. at 177.  A policy change or the discharge of an officer could have \nhelped Ruggiero, because he continued to be incarcerated and would have to interact with those officers, \nunder those policies, in the future.  Here, however, a change in the policies regarding pregnant inmates or \nthe discharge of OBGYN staff could not have helped Laboy with her pregnancy—once her child was \nborn, the situation that led to the alleged deprivation of her rights could not be repeated because Laboy \nwould not again become pregnant in prison.  \n12 \n \n\nCCasaes e3 :32:01-9c-vc-v0-00503340-7J-BJAC H   D  oDcoucmumenetn 3t 45-51 2   F  iFleilde d1 20/50/50/31/92 0   P  aPgaeg e1 31 4o fo 1f 415\nUnder the circumstances of this case, there was no “available” remedy.  As in \nWhite, after Laboy’s baby was born, there was nothing she or the prison could do to \nchange the facts surrounding its birth, which remain in dispute.6  Laboy “had no \nopportunity to grieve” the failure to provide her medical care “until after the harm done    \n. . . was complete and could not be undone by the defendants.”  Id. at 396.  She “wasn’t \nabout to become pregnant again,” and thus, she had nothing to gain from filing a \ngrievance.  White, 800 F.3d at 394-95.  An “available” remedy is one that is “capable of \nuse for the accomplishment of a purpose,” and “accessible” or obtainable.  Ross, 136 S. \nCt. at 1958.  Here, filing a grievance could not have accomplished any purpose for \nLaboy.  On the facts of this case, there was no “available” remedy for Laboy to \nexhaust.7  \nIn light of Ross v. Blake, Laboy had no available remedies to exhaust.  \nTherefore, the defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 31) is denied.   \n \n \n                                                           \n6 The defendants do not state, in their Statement of Material Facts, that Laboy gave birth at York.  \nDefs.’ Statement of Facts (Doc. No. 31-2).  They simply state facts related to the grievance procedures at \nYork, and Laboy’s failure to use those procedures.  The plaintiffs’ Statement of Material Facts, however, \nincludes additional facts and refers to the birth in prison.  See Pl.’s Stat. ¶ 16, 19.  For the purpose of the \nMotion for Summary Judgment, the court accepts that Laboy gave birth in prison.  \n7 In Ross, the Supreme Court “note[d] as relevant here three kinds of circumstances in which an \nadministrative remedy, although officially on the books, is not capable of use to obtain relief:”  first, where \nthe administrative process “operates as a simple dead end;” second, where the administrative scheme is \n“so opaque that it becomes, practically speaking, incapable of use;” and third, where “prison \nadministrators thwart inmates from taking advantage of a grievance process through machination, \nmisrepresentation, or intimidation.”  136 S. Ct. at 1859-60.  The plaintiff argues that this case could fit into \neither the first or third Ross exceptions, because Semple met with Laboy after she returned to York.  See \nPl.’s Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. (Doc. No. 51) at 12-17.  However, as the plaintiff notes, citing the Second \nCircuit, the three circumstances in Ross do not appear to be exhaustive.  Id. at 17 (citing Williams v. \nCorrection Officer Priatno, 829 F.3d 118, 123 n. 2 (2d Cir. 2016)).  The court need not fit this case into \none of the three Ross examples to conclude that no remedy was available. \n13 \n \n\nCCasaes e3 :32:01-9c-vc-v0-00503340-7J-BJAC H   D  oDcoucmumenetn 3t 45-51 2   F  iFleilde d1 20/50/50/31/92 0   P  aPgaeg e1 41 5o fo 1f 415\nIV.

On April 7, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, along with a memorandum of law\nin support. FN3Thereafter, on April 8, 2020, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which adds Kerri\nDirgo and Joshua Wilcox as additional plaintiffs, and which includes additional allegations and changes\nto some previous allegations. FN4\nIn the amended complaint, the plaintiffs ask the court to issue a writ of mandamus compelling the\ndefendants to (a) “immediately release all people having the CDC heightened risk factors for serious\nillness or death from COVID-19, to an appropriate medical facility where necessary”; (b) “immediately\nand meaningfully reduce the population density at each and every facility in which they confine people”;\n(c) “submit for the court’s review and ongoing monitoring a plan: (1) to provide adequate sanitation and\nsocial distancing in prisons so as\nto prevent the spread of COVID-19, including by taking all measures for screening, cleaning, hygiene\nand social distancing that the CDC recommends for correctional facilities; (2) to diagnose and treat\npeople showing symptoms of COVID-19 in accordance with contemporary standards of care, (3) to\napprove, within seven days, community or private residences to those qualified for release to such via\n[General Statutes] § 18-100, (4) to approve, within seven days, residences for any prisoner or detainee\nwho is now eligible for release but for the defendant’s approval of a residence, and (5) to sufficiently\nfund transitional housing for the duration of the pandemic; and (d) undertake any other task necessary to\ndischarge their duties to those in their custody during the pandemic, including by working with other\narms of state government to expedite their handling of requests for release, and ensuring consideration\nof relief for all incarcerated people who can safely return to their communities.”\nThe defendants assert in their motion to dismiss that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this\naction on the basis that the defendant CCDLA lacks standing because it fails the classical aggrievement\ntest and because it cannot assert third party standing on behalf of the individual plaintiffs. They also\nassert that the individual plaintiffs lack standing because they do not have any right to be released prior\nto the end of their lawful sentences and because their constitutional claims are based on alleged injuries\nthat are too speculative. The defendants also assert that the plaintiffs’ claims are nonjusticiable political\nquestions. Finally, the defendants contend that the plaintiffs’ request for the court to order the defendants\nto submit a plan for the court’s review is barred by sovereign immunity to the extent that such a plan\ncalls for the defendants to sufficiently fund transitional housing for the duration of the pandemic because\nsuch a plan would amount to an award of damages from the state, which has not consented to be sued.\nOn April 13, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion and the defendants\nfiled a reply, along with a declaration of Cary Freston. Arguments on this motion were heard before this\ncourt on the record on April 15, 2020.

Smith, 273 Conn. 610, 615 n.6, 872 A.2d 408\n(2005). “If . . . the plaintiff’s standing does not adequately appear from all materials of record, the\ncomplaint must be dismissed.” (Footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Burton v.\nDominion Nuclear Connecticut, Inc., 300 Conn. 542, 550, 23 A.3d 1176 (2011).\n“It is well established that [a] party must have standing to assert a claim in order for the court to have\nsubject matter jurisdiction over the claim. . . . Standing is the legal right to set judicial machinery in\nmotion. One cannot rightfully invoke the jurisdiction of the court unless he has, in an individual or\nrepresentative capacity, some real interest in the cause of action, or a legal or equitable right, title or\ninterest in the subject matter of the controversy. . . . [Our Supreme Court] has often stated that the\nquestion of subject matter jurisdiction, because it addresses the basic competency of the court, can be\nraised by any of the parties, or by the court sua sponte, at any time. . . . Where a party is found to lack\nstanding, the court is consequently without subject matter jurisdiction to determine the cause. . . .\n“Standing is no mere procedural technicality. As the United States Supreme Court has explained, ‘[t]he\npower to declare the rights of individuals and to measure the authority of governments . . . is legitimate\nonly in the last resort, and as a necessity in the determination of real, earnest and vital controversy.’ . . .\nValley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S.\n464, 471, 102 S. Ct. 752, 70 L. Ed. 2d 700 (1982). As a result, ‘[t]he exercise of judicial power, which\ncan so profoundly affect the lives, liberty, and property of those to whom it extends, is therefore\nrestricted to litigants who can show [an injury] resulting from the action which they seek to have the\ncourt adjudicate.’ . . . Id., 473. The standing requirement further evinces a proper regard for the judicial\nbranch’s relationship with coequal branches of government under our constitutional structure. Thus, ‘[i]t\nis the role of courts to provide relief to claimants, in individual or class actions, who have suffered, or\nwill imminently suffer, actual harm; it is not the role of courts, but that of the political branches, to shape\nthe institutions of government in such fashion as to comply with the laws and the Constitution.’ Lewis v.\nCasey, 518 U.S. 343, 349, 116 S. Ct. 2174, 135 L. Ed. 2d 606 (1996).” (Citations omitted; footnotes\nomitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Johnson v. Rell, 119 Conn. App. 730, 735–37, 990 A.2d 354\n(2010).\nThe defendants argue that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiffs lack standing\nto pursue their claims in this mandamus action. In support of their position, they argue that none of the\nplaintiffs are classically aggrieved because they have not alleged any direct injury. They also maintain\nthat the plaintiffs have failed to allege facts to meet the other standing requirements applicable to each of\nthe plaintiffs.\n1. Associational Standing as to the CCDLA\nWith regard to the CCDLA, the defendants first argue that the CCDLA lacks standing because the\ncomplaint sets forth no allegations of any injury to the CCDLA or its members; the plaintiffs allege only\npotential injury to some clients of its members. They further maintain that the CCDLA cannot\nsuccessfully assert associational standing because such standing requires the plaintiffs to allege that the\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 2 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-13   Filed 05/03/20   Page 4 of 10\nCCDLA has suffered or will suffer some direct injury in its own right. They note that no such allegations\nare included in the complaint. In opposition, the plaintiffs argue that the CCDLA may avail itself of\nassociational standing to bring this action on behalf of its members because they meet the requirements\nfor such standing. Specifically, they maintain that its members suffer an injury in fact and therefore\nwould otherwise have standing to maintain this action in their own right because they face the threat of\ncoronavirus infection when visiting their clients who are “cycling in and out of DOC custody.” They\nfurther assert that the interests they seek to protect are germane to the CCDLA’s purpose, which is to\nsupport its members in their defense of people accused of violating the law. Finally, they assert that\nparticipation of the individual members would not be required. In their reply, the defendants assert that\nthe plaintiffs’ assertions of injury in their memorandum in opposition are not a substitute for allegations\nin their operative complaint, which do not allege any such injuries, and argue that the CCDLA members\nhave no rights under the eighth or fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and are not\nrequired to enter prisons to represent their clients. They also argue that because the plaintiffs do not\nallege that CCDLA members represent inmates in any actions asserting conditions of confinement\nclaims, they fail to satisfy the “germaneness” prong of the associational standing test.\nThe court agrees with the defendants that the plaintiffs have not alleged facts demonstrating that the\nCCDLA meets the requirements for such standing. Specifically, the plaintiffs have not alleged that the\nCCDLA or any of its members have suffered any injury. In the amended complaint, the plaintiffs allege\nthat the CCDLA “is a nonprofit Connecticut organization comprising lawyers who represent people\naccused of crimes in the state,” it “has approximately 300 members statewide,” “[i]ts members represent\nclients held in each of the facilities controlled by the Connecticut Department of Correction,” and it\n“engages in education and advocacy for the fair treatment of those accused of crimes, and for positive\nchanges in Connecticut’s criminal and motor vehicle code,” and “also serves as an amicus curiae to\nConnecticut’s appellate courts.” (Amended complaint, entry #114, ¶¶ 1-4.) The CCDLA is not\nmentioned in anywhere else in the complaint, and these allegations fail to assert that it has suffered or\nwill suffer any direct injury.\n“An organization may file suit on its own behalf ‘to seek judicial relief from injury to itself and to\nvindicate whatever rights and immunities the organization itself may enjoy.’ Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S.\n490, 511, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 45 L. Ed. 2d 343 (1975). In order to do so, however, an organization must\nsatisfy the constitutional minimum of standing by demonstrating an ‘injury in fact’; a causal connection\nbetween the injury and the conduct of which the party complains; and that it is ‘likely’ a favorable\ndecision will provide redress.” Juvenile Matters Trial Lawyers Assn. v. Judicial Dept., 363 F. Supp. 2d\n239, 244 (D. Conn. 2005). Without any allegation of an injury in fact to the CCDLA, it fails to meet the\nrequirements of associational standing. In Juvenile Matters Trial Lawyers Assn. v. Judicial Dept., supra,\n363 F. Supp. 2d 245, an organization of attorneys who provided legal services to juveniles and their\nfamilies brought an action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against the Judicial Department and\nseveral individual defendants. In opposing a motion to dismiss asserting lack of standing, the plaintiff\nargued that it had standing to bring this action in its own right, on behalf of its members, and on behalf\nof the clients represented by the member attorneys. As in the present case, the complaint in that case did\nnot include any allegation of injury to the association itself. Accordingly, the District Court determined\nthat the plaintiff lacked standing to bring the action on its own behalf in that action. That same reason\napplies here. As the plaintiffs have not alleged any injury to the CCDLA, it lacks standing to assert any\nclaim on its own behalf.\nMoreover, any injury on behalf of the CCDLA that might be inferred from the complaint would be too\nindirect to demonstrate the CCDLA’s standing because any such injury would be suffered by individual\nclients of individual members of the CCDLA. In Connecticut State Medical Society v. Oxford Health\nPlans (CT), Inc., 272 Conn. 469, 481–82, 863 A.2d 645 (2005), the plaintiff had argued that it had\nsufficiently alleged an injury suffered by the plaintiff in that it alleged that its members had suffered\ninjury by the defendant’s failure to make timely and complete payments to those members, which, in\nturn, resulted in the plaintiff suffering injury because the defendants’ actions caused the plaintiff to\nexpend resources and to suffer a reduction in revenue from its members. The court upheld the trial\ncourt’s decision dismissing the action for lack of standing because the plaintiff’s injuries “derive solely\nand exclusively from the harm allegedly visited upon the plaintiff’s members by the defendant. In other\nwords, none of the harm that the plaintiff allegedly suffered as a result of the defendant’s conduct is\ndirect.” (Emphasis in original.) Id., 479. As the defendants in the present case correctly note, the injuries\nasserted in this case are one step further removed; any injuries would affect the inmates, not the CCDLA\nor its members. For this reason as well, the CCDLA does not have associational standing.\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 3 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-13   Filed 05/03/20   Page 5 of 10\n2. Third Party Standing of the CCDLA\nThe court must next address whether the plaintiffs’ allegations support the plaintiffs’ argument that the\nCCDLA has third party standing to assert claims on behalf of third party inmates. The defendants assert\nthat the CCDLA cannot assert third party standing on behalf of inmates because the three requirements\nfor such standing are not satisfied in the present case. Specifically, they argue that the complaint sets\nforth no allegation of an injury suffered by the CCDLA or its members, that the CCDLA’s relationship\nwith the third party inmates is not sufficiently close, and that there is no hindrance to the third parties’\nability to protect their own interests.\nThe plaintiffs counter that the CCDLA satisfies the requirements for third party standing, specifically\nthat the CCDLA’s relationship with third party inmates is sufficiently close and that there is a hindrance\nto the third party inmates’ ability to protect their own interests. The plaintiffs do not directly address the\ndefendants’ argument that the CCDLA fails to allege an injury to itself for purposes of third party\nstanding, but contend that members of the public may bring mandamus actions to enforce a public right\npursuant to Practice Book § 23-45 (a) FN5 without the need to demonstrate any interest in the outcome\nof the matter. Moreover, they maintain, the CCDLA is in a better position to represent the interests of its\nmembers’ clients than the individual inmates themselves because of the limited resources available to\nthe courts to review the petitions of numerous individual inmates seeking to obtain release due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nThe United States Supreme Court has “recognized the right of litigants to bring actions on behalf of\nthird parties, provided three important criteria are satisfied: The litigant must have suffered an ‘injury in\nfact,’ thus giving him or her a ‘sufficiently concrete interest’ in the outcome of the issue in dispute . . .\nthe litigant must have a close relation to the third party . . . and there must exist some hindrance to the\nthird party’s ability to protect his or her own interests.” (Citations omitted.) Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S.\n400, 410–11, 111 S. Ct. 1364, 113 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1991); see also State v. Bradley, 195 Conn. App. 36,\n51, 223 A.3d 62 (2019) (listing “injury” as one of three requirements that must be satisfied in order to\nbring actions on behalf of third parties), cert. granted on other grounds, 334 Conn. 925, 223 A.3d 379\n(2020).\nAs discussed elsewhere in this decision with regard to associational standing, the plaintiffs have not\nalleged any injury to the CCDLA or its members. As such an injury is required in order to bring a claim\non behalf of third parties, the plaintiffs’ claim of third party standing as to the CCDLA fails. Moreover,\nthe plaintiffs’ contention that such an injury or direct interest is not required where a plaintiff brings a\nmandamus action to enforce a public right is unpersuasive. Practice Book § 23-45 (a) provides: “An\naction of mandamus may be brought in an individual right by any person who claims entitlement to that\nremedy to enforce a private duty owed to that person, or by any state’s attorney to enforce a public\nduty.” (Emphasis added.) The CCDLA is alleged to be an association of criminal defense attorneys, not\nstate’s attorneys. The one Connecticut case cited by the plaintiffs in support of their position, State ex\nrel. E. Color Printing Co. v. Jenks, 150 Conn. 444, 190 A.2d 591 (1963), was brought by a state’s\nattorney and is therefore inapposite. Although it is therefore not necessary to address the other\nrequirements of third party standing, the court further notes that the plaintiffs’ contention that it meets\nthe third requirement, that the third parties must be hindered in protecting their own rights, is belied by\nthe fact that the individual plaintiffs in this action are members of the group whose interests the CCDLA\nseeks to protect. For all of these reasons, the CCDLA lacks standing to assert claims on behalf of third\nparties in this action. Accordingly, the motion is granted and the action is dismissed with regard to the\nCCDLA.\n2. Standing: Individual Plaintiffs\nThe court next turns to the issue of whether the individual plaintiffs have standing to maintain this\naction. The defendants argue that the individual plaintiffs lack standing because they have not alleged\nany injury as they do not have any right to be released before the end of their sentences. They maintain\nthat the individual plaintiffs have no statutory right to early release and that the statutes providing for\nearly release provide discretion to the executive officials charged with carrying out their provisions. In\nsupport, they further argue that the eighth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution\ndo not provide a remedy for the individual plaintiffs because they do not provide for early release; rather,\nthey relate to deliberate indifference to health and safety and the provision of medical care. They further\nmaintain that the risk of harm posed by the individual plaintiffs remaining incarcerated is too speculative\nto support the plaintiffs’ claims. Finally, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs’ failure to allege that the\ndefendants have the requisite level of mental culpability for purposes of a deliberate indifference claim\ndeprives them of standing.\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 4 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-13   Filed 05/03/20   Page 6 of 10\nIn opposition, the plaintiffs counter that the defendants’ knowledge of the dangers of COVID-19, and the\ndefendants’ failure to take appropriate measures to prevent its spread in their facilities, amount to an\neighth and fourteenth amendment violation because the individual plaintiffs’ conditions of confinement\nare likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering. They argue that they have alleged the\ndefendants’ deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs’ exposure to COVID-19 by their failure to take\nadequate steps to prevent exposure to the virus. Moreover, the plaintiffs maintain, their allegations\npertaining to the defendants’ mental state are adequate because they need only to have alleged that the\ndefendants acted “recklessly” with regard to the safety of the individual plaintiffs who have been\nsentenced and that the defendants knew or should have known of the excessive risk to health or safety\nwith regard to the individual plaintiffs who have not yet been sentenced. The plaintiffs further argue that\nclaims of deliberate indifference do not require the plaintiffs already to have been exposed to the risk of\ninfection. They maintain that the complaint adequately alleges that people incarcerated in DOC facilities\nare held in conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm. Finally, the plaintiffs argue that their\ninjuries are redressible by this court without regard to whether a particular statute or administrative\nscheme establishes a remedy to address the risks posed by the COVID-19 crisis and that, even if the\ncourt were limited only to the remedies already provided by the executive and legislative branches, the\ndefendants already have the authority “to alter every existing textual form of relief such that their\nfeigned helplessness divests them of a defense.” Essentially, the plaintiffs argue that the court has broad\ndiscretion to structure appropriate relief in this mandamus action such that the plaintiffs have injuries\nthat are redressible in this action.\nAs a threshold matter, the court rejects the defendants’ argument that the issue of whether the individual\nplaintiffs have a right to be released from custody is dispositive of the issue of whether they have\nstanding to maintain this action. Although the defendants have cited federal case law stating that “if the\nplaintiff’s claim has no foundation in law, he has no legally protected interest and thus no standing to\nsue”; Claybrook v. Slater, 111 F.3d 904, 907 (D.C. Cir. 1997); research reveals no appellate authority in\nConnecticut applying the concept of standing that broadly. To the contrary, our Supreme Court has\nconsistently retained a distinction between standing and the plaintiff’s “legal interests.” “The\nfundamental aspect of [statutory] standing . . . [is that] it focuses on the party seeking to get his\ncomplaint before [the] court and not on the issues he wishes to have adjudicated. . . . When standing is\nput in issue, the question is whether the person whose standing is challenged is a proper party to request\nan adjudication of the issue and not whether the controversy is otherwise justiciable, or whether, on the\nmerits, the plaintiff has a legally protected interest that the defendant’s action has invaded. . . . The\nconcepts of standing and legal interest are to be distinguished. The legal interest test goes to the merits,\nwhereas standing concerns the question whether the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is\narguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional\nguarantee in question.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Lazar v. Ganim, 334 Conn. 73, 85–86, 220\nA.3d 18 (2019), quoting Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, Inc. v. Gill, 175 Conn. 483, 491–92, 400 A.2d\n726 (1978). Accordingly, the court will not grant the defendants’ motion on ground that the plaintiffs\nhave no injury simply because they have no right to be released from custody. Nevertheless, the court\nmust consider whether the plaintiffs otherwise have failed to allege an injury as a result of the\ndefendants’ handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n“An allegation of injury is both fundamental and essential to a demonstration of standing. Under\nConnecticut law, standing requires no more than a colorable claim of injury; a plaintiff ordinarily\nestablishes his standing by allegations of injury. . . . As long as there is some direct injury for which the\nplaintiff seeks redress, the injury that is alleged need not be great. . . . Furthermore, an allegation of\ninjury is a prerequisite under federal law to the maintenance of an action under § 1983. See, e.g.,\nColombo v. O’Connell, 310 F.3d 115, 117 (2d Cir. 2002) (‘[t]o state a claim under [§] 1983, a plaintiff\nmust allege facts indicating that some official action has caused the plaintiff to be deprived of his or her\nconstitutional rights—in other words, there is an injury requirement to state the claim’), cert. denied, 538\nU.S. 961, 123 S. Ct. 1750, 155 L. Ed.2d 512 (2003); Ciambriello v. County of Nassau, 292 F.3d 307,\n323 (2d Cir. 2002) (‘[i]n order to state a claim under § 1983, a plaintiff must allege that he was injured\nby either a state actor or a private party acting under color of state law’).” (Emphasis in original;\nfootnotes omitted.) Johnson v. Rell, supra, 119 Conn. App. 735–38.\n“The eighth amendment, which applies to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth\namendment to the United States constitution . . . prohibits detention in a manner that constitutes cruel\nand unusual punishment. . . . Cruel and unusual punishment refers to punishment that involves the\nunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain or is grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime. . . .\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 5 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-13   Filed 05/03/20   Page 7 of 10\nUnder the eighth amendment, prison officials must ensure that inmates receive adequate food, clothing,\nshelter, and medical care, and must take reasonable measures to guarantee the safety of the inmates . . .\n.” (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Fuller v. Commissioner of Correction, 75 Conn.\nApp. 133, 136, 815 A.2d 208 (2003).\n“In challenging the conditions of confinement, the prisoner must meet two requirements. First, the\nalleged deprivation of adequate conditions must be objectively, sufficiently serious . . . such that the\npetitioner was denied ‘the minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities . . . .’ . . . Wilson v. Seiter, 501\nU.S. 294, 298, 111 S. Ct. 2321, 115 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1991). Second, the official involved must have had a\nsufficiently culpable state of mind described as ‘deliberate indifference’ to inmate health or safety.\nFarmer v. Brennan, [511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994)]. In that context,\nsubjective deliberate indifference means that ‘a prison official cannot be found liable under the [e]ighth\n[a]mendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official knows of and\ndisregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety . . . .’ Id., 837. (Citations omitted; internal\nquotation marks omitted.) Fuller v. Commissioner of Correction, supra, 75 Conn. App. 136–37.\nIn the present case, the plaintiffs have not alleged facts satisfying these two requirements. First, the\nplaintiffs have not alleged facts showing that the defendants have deprived the plaintiffs of the minimal\ncivilized measure of life’s necessities by failing to release a sufficient number of prisoners from\nconfinement in order to mitigate the risk of the spread of infection. Although Helling v. McKinney, 509\nU.S. 25, 113 S. Ct. 2475, 125 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1993), supports the plaintiffs’ position that exposure to\nfuture harm can present an eighth amendment violation, the facts of that case are distinguishable from\nthose alleged in the present case. In Helling, the United States Supreme Court held that the plaintiff in\nthat case stated a cause of action under the eighth amendment by alleging that prison officials “have,\nwith deliberate indifference, exposed [the plaintiff inmate] to levels of [environmental tobacco smoke]\nthat pose an unreasonable risk of serious damage to his future health.” Id., 35. Although the court held\nthat the fact that the plaintiff had not yet suffered any adverse health consequences from his exposure to\nsmoke was not fatal to his claim, the plaintiff had asserted that he was presently and directly exposed to\nthe dangerous condition, in that he was presently being exposed to smoke by being forced to share a cell\nwith another prisoner who was smoking five packs of cigarettes per day. Id., 28. In the present case, the\nplaintiffs have not alleged analogous facts. For example, the plaintiffs do not allege that any of them are\nhoused with or otherwise directly exposed to individuals with COVID-19. Rather, they allege that the\npreventative steps that the defendants have taken have not been and will not be adequate to address the\npandemic because the plaintiffs will be subjected to a heightened risk of exposure to the coronavirus in\nthe future as a result of inadequate steps taken to mitigate the risks.\nEven assuming, arguendo, that the conditions to which the plaintiffs are being or will be exposed do rise\nto the level of a “serious risk to health or safety,” the plaintiffs have not alleged facts to satisfy the\nsecond requirement, that is, to show that the defendants have acted or will act with “deliberate\nindifference” to the risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. To the contrary, the plaintiffs describe the\ndefendants’ conduct in the amended complaint as “commendable, but unfortunately insufficient to\ncomply with their constitutional and statutory obligation to ensure the safety of those in their custody.”\n(Amended complaint, entry #114, ¶ 92.) Allegations that the defendants’ actions have been or will be\n“insufficient” do not rise to the level of a conscious disregard of an excessive risk to inmate health or\nsafety.\n“The second requirement follows from the principle that only the unnecessary and wanton infliction of\npain implicates the Eighth Amendment. . . . To violate the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, a\nprison official must have a sufficiently culpable state of mind. . . . In prison-conditions cases that state of\nmind is one of ‘deliberate indifference’ to inmate health or safety . . . .” (Citations omitted; internal\nquotation marks omitted.) Farmer v. Brennan, supra, 511 U.S. 834. The United States Supreme Court\nhas explained that “deliberate indifference describes a state of mind more blameworthy than\nnegligence.” Id., 835. It further explained that this standard “requires more than ordinary lack of due\ncare for the prisoner’s interests or safety.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. “It is, indeed, fair to\nsay that acting or failing to act with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to a\nprisoner is the equivalent of recklessly disregarding that risk.” Id., 836. In further clarifying what is\nmeant by “recklessly” in this context, the court in Farmer explained that “a prison official cannot be\nfound liable under the Eighth Amendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement\nunless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must\nboth be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm\nexists, and he must also draw the inference.” (Emphasis added.) Id., 837. “The Eighth Amendment does\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 6 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-13   Filed 05/03/20   Page 8 of 10\nnot outlaw cruel and unusual ‘conditions’; it outlaws cruel and unusual ‘punishments.’ An act or\nomission unaccompanied by knowledge of a significant risk of harm might well be something society\nwishes to discourage, and if harm does result society might well wish to assure compensation. The\ncommon law reflects such concerns when it imposes tort liability on a purely objective basis. . . . But an\nofficial’s failure to alleviate a significant risk that he should have perceived but did not, while no cause\nfor commendation, cannot under our cases be condemned as the infliction of punishment.” (Citations\nomitted.) Id., 837–38.\nIn the present case, the plaintiffs have not alleged facts demonstrating that the defendants had or have the\nrequisite mental state with respect to the risks identified in the complaint. Although the allegations in the\namended complaint do demonstrate that the defendants are aware of the seriousness of the risks posed\nby COVID-19 generally, the complaint does not allege facts demonstrating that the defendants are acting\nwith deliberate indifference with regard to those risks. Rather, the plaintiffs assert in their amended\ncomplaint that the defendants, in failing to release prisoners from confinement to reduce prison\npopulation density, have not done enough to protect inmates from the risk of infection. As the defendants\ncorrectly assert, these allegations sound in negligence, not recklessness. Our Supreme Court has\n“described recklessness as a state of consciousness with reference to the consequences of one’s acts. . . .\nIt is more than negligence, more than gross negligence. . . . The state of mind amounting to recklessness\nmay be inferred from conduct. But, in order to infer it, there must be something more than a failure to\nexercise a reasonable degree of watchfulness to avoid danger to others or to take reasonable precautions\nto avoid injury to them. . . . Wanton misconduct is reckless misconduct. . . . It is such conduct as\nindicates a reckless disregard of the just rights or safety of others or of the consequences of the action.”\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.) Matthiessen v. Vanech, 266 Conn. 822, 832–33, 836 A.2d 394\n(2003). As the allegations in the amended complaint do not sound in recklessness, the plaintiffs have\nfailed to allege an eighth amendment injury and, accordingly, the individual plaintiffs lack standing to\nmaintain this action.\nB\nPolitical Question Doctrine\nAlthough it is not necessary to reach the other grounds asserted in the defendants’ motion, as the court\nhas already determined that none of the plaintiffs have standing to maintain this action and it must,\ntherefore, be dismissed, the court will address the political question doctrine as an alternative basis for\nits decision. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs’ action presents nonjusticiable political questions\nand must be dismissed because the plaintiffs’ requests for relief in this mandamus action seek to impose\nthe judgment of the court in place of the discretion vested in coordinate branches of government. In\nessence, they contend that by seeking mandamus relief that would limit or override the discretion\notherwise vested in the legislative and executive branches of government, the plaintiffs’ action presents\nnonjusticiable political questions. The plaintiffs counter that the plaintiffs’ claims do not involve\npolitical questions because the court has the power to provide mandamus relief from reckless exposure\nto illness or death as a result of the spread of COVID-19 in their facilities. They maintain that enforcing\nthe protections of the United States constitution against cruel and unusual punishment is within this\ncourt’s authority. They argue that the defendants’ duty to safeguard the health and wellbeing of the\ninmates in custody are not discretionary. In response, the defendants further argue that the question of\nhow any violations of the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights would be rectified should be left to the\ndiscretion of the legislative and executive branches. They maintain that because the plaintiffs seek relief\nthat calls for the exercise of discretion by executive branch officials, and seeks no alternative relief such\nas a declaratory judgment that the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights are being violated, this case presents\nnonjusticiable political questions and must be dismissed.\n“The political question doctrine itself is based on the principle of separation of powers . . . as well as the\nnotion that the judiciary should not involve itself in matters that have been committed to the executive\nand legislative branches of government. . . . [I]n considering whether a particular subject matter presents\na nonjusticiable political question, we have articulated [six] relevant factors, including: a textually\ndemonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of\njudicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding\nwithout an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of\na court’s undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate\nbranches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already\nmade; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments\non one question. Unless one of these formulations is inextricable from the case at bar, there should be no\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 7 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-13   Filed 05/03/20   Page 9 of 10\ndismissal for nonjusticiability on the ground of a political question’s presence.” (Citations omitted;\ninternal quotation marks omitted.) Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc. v. Rell,\n295 Conn. 240, 255-56, 990 A.2d 206 (2010).\nApplying these factors to the present case, the plaintiffs’ claims involve nonjusticiable political questions\nand should be dismissed for that reason as well. The plaintiffs seek mandamus relief compelling the\ndefendants to release inmates with heightened risk factors for COVID-19 to “to an appropriate medical\nfacility where necessary”; “immediately and meaningfully reduce the population density at each and\nevery facility in which they confine people” by taking specific steps specified by the plaintiffs in their\ncomplaint; and to “submit for the Court’s review and ongoing monitoring a plan” regarding certain\naspects of the defendants’ efforts to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, providing medical care to\ninmates, approval of residences for qualified inmates, and to sufficiently fund transitional housing for the\nduration of the pandemic; and to undertake other necessary tasks. If the court were to compel the\ndefendants to take these actions, such an order would necessarily be made without “judicially\ndiscoverable and manageable standards”; would not be possible “without an initial policy determination\nof a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion”; would not be possible “without expressing lack of the\nrespect due coordinate branches of government . . . .” See Id.\nAs the defendants correctly note, the statutes governing release and transfer of inmates in DOC custody\nprovide discretion to the executive branch officials with regard to the transfer or release of inmates. For\nexample, General Statutes § 18-100 (e) provides in relevant part that “the commissioner may transfer\nany person from one correctional institution to another or to any public or private nonprofit halfway\nhouse, group home or mental health facility or, after satisfactory participation in a residential program,\nto any approved community or private residence. . . .” (Emphasis added.) Similarly, General Statutes §\n18-100c provides that an inmates with a sentence of two years or less “may be released pursuant to\nsubsection (e) of section 18-100 or to any other community correction program approved by the\nCommissioner of Correction.” (Emphasis added.) General Statutes § 18-52a (a) provides in relevant\npart: “Any person committed to the custody of the Commissioner of Correction who is confined in a\ncorrectional facility and requires hospitalization for medical care may be transferred by the department\nto any hospital having facilities for such care. . . .” (Emphasis added.) These statutes necessarily entail\nthe use of discretion and judgment by the department of correction in determining whether to release or\ntransfer an inmate. Accordingly, application of the above factors indicates that the action should be\ndismissed based on the political question doctrine.\nBy contrast, in Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc., the court determined that\nthe plaintiffs’ claims in that case did not present a nonjusticiable political question. In reaching its\nconclusion, the court summarized the reasoning set forth in an earlier decision, Seymour v. Region One\nBoard of Education, 261 Conn. 475, 482–84, 803 A.2d 318 (2002). In both cases, the court relied, in\npart, on the forms of relief sought by the plaintiffs in determining that the case did not present a\nnonjusticiable political question. Specifically, it noted: “If we were to construe the complaint as\nrequesting only that a court, having determined that the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims are meritorious,\norder the [school] district to establish itself as a taxing district, and set the taxing powers and standards\nsuggested by the plaintiffs, we would have grave doubts about the justiciability of the claim, as the\ndefendant suggests. In that case, it is very likely that the claim would fall within one or more of the\ncategories of nonjusticiability.” Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc. v. Rell,\nsupra, 295 Conn. 261. The court further explained: “Although the plaintiffs do seek, in part, such an\norder from the court, and although the text of the complaint presents such a remedy as the only way to\nvindicate the plaintiffs’ rights, a separate prayer for relief is simply ‘[t]hat judgment be entered declaring\nthat . . . [General Statutes] § 10–51 (b) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied by [the board].’” Id.\nIt further explained: “This latter prayer for relief is susceptible of an interpretation that would leave the\nformulation of the appropriate remedy to the legislative branch, rather than requiring the judicial branch\nto entangle itself in what probably would be the nonjudicial function of establishing a taxing district.\nFurthermore, there is precedent for this court, having determined that a particular legislative scheme is\nunconstitutional, to leave the remedy to the legislative branch, at least initially. . . . We, therefore,\nconsider the question of justiciability on the premise that the plaintiffs seek a declaration of the\nunconstitutionality of § 10–51 (b), with the remedy that they propose to be considered by the legislative\nbranch.” Id., 261-62.\nApplying this reasoning to the present action yields a different result. In the present case, the plaintiffs’\nprayers for relief leave no room for an interpretation that the plaintiffs seek a mere declaration as to the\nconstitutionality of the defendants’ actions with respect to the COVID-19 crisis. Although the plaintiffs’\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 8 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-13   Filed 05/03/20   Page 10 of 10\nclaims would depend, in part, on a determination that the individual plaintiffs’ constitutional rights are\nbeing violated, the plaintiffs do not seek declaratory relief. They ask that the court order mandamus\nrelief, specifically the release and relocation of inmates and the reduction in prison populations.\nMoreover, the nature of the action itself, mandamus, demonstrates that the nature of relief sought in this\naction is to compel specific actions on the part of the defendants, actions that are governed by statutes\ngranting the defendants discretion with regard to how to carry out their responsibilities. Accordingly, this\naction presents nonjusticiable political questions and must be dismissed.\nC\nSovereign Immunity\nWith regard to the defendants’ sovereign immunity argument, the motion will not be granted on that\nbasis. “The Supreme Court . . . has taught that sovereign immunity is not invoked simply because\nprospective injunctive relief ultimately results in a diminution of state funds.” In re Dairy Mart\nConvenience Stores, Inc., 411 F.3d 367, 375 (2d Cir. 2005), citing Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651,\n668, 94 S. Ct. 1347, 39 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1974) (although state officials, “in order to shape their official\nconduct to the mandate of the Court’s decrees, would more likely have to spend money from the state\ntreasury than if they had been left free to pursue their previous course of conduct” such “an ancillary\neffect on the state treasury is a permissible and often an inevitable consequence of the principle” that\nprospective injunctive relief is not barred by the eleventh amendment to the United States constitution).\nAs the plaintiffs correctly assert, therefore, sovereign immunity does not bar the present action.\nAccordingly, the motion is not granted on sovereign immunity grounds. Nevertheless, for the reasons\ndiscussed elsewhere in this decision, the court nevertheless lacks subject matter jurisdiction, which\nrequires that the motion be granted.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the defendants’ motion to dismiss is hereby granted.\nFootnotes\n1 As noted elsewhere in this decision, Kerri Dirgo and Joshua Wilcox were added as plaintiffs on April\n8, 2020. Accordingly, references to the “individual defendants” refer to them as well.\n2 On April 8, 2020, the plaintiffs also filed a supplemental motion for temporary order of mandamus to\nconform to the amended complaint that was filed on that date.\n3 On April 7, 2020, the defendants also filed an objection to the motion for temporary order of\nmandamus, with several exhibits.\n4 On April 8, 2020, this court, Bellis, J., issued an order stating in relevant part: “By agreement of the\nparties, and with the court’s permission, Kerri Dirgo and Joshua Wilcox are added as party plaintiffs,\nAmended Complaint entry #114 filed on today’s date is the operative complaint, and Motion to Dismiss\nentry #112 is directed to said Amended Complaint.”\n5 Practice Book § 23-45 (a) provides: “An action of mandamus may be brought in an individual right by\nany person who claims entitlement to that remedy to enforce a private duty owed to that person, or by\nany state’s attorney to enforce a public duty.” (Emphasis added).\n421277\nJudge: BARBARA N BELLIS\nThis document may be signed or verified electronically and has the same validity and status as a document with a physical\n(pen-to-paper) signature.

I am the Director of the Connecticut Innocence Project/Post-Conviction Unit of the \nDivision of Public Defender Services. I have been in this position for 7 years, and I have \nworked for the Division of Public Defender Services since 2009.  \n \n2.  A longtime client of mine is a 67-year-old man with chronic health conditions that will \nbecome much worse should he contract the coronavirus. Once the pandemic began, I \nsubmitted a compassionate release application on his behalf to the Board of Pardons and \nParole. He meets the statutory criteria; he is a model prisoner; and he has a home to go to \nand a job waiting for him. However, my application was denied. We were told simply \nthat “Unfortunately, he does not meet the eligibility criteria outlines [sic] in the statute as \nhe is not debilitated, incapacitated or infirmed as a result of his condition(s).  He is \nhoused in general population and is caring for himself with limited involvement from \nmedical staff.” His increased risk of serious illness or death due to the Coronavirus \noutbreak in the facility where he is housed was not addressed at all. \n \n3.  My client has had a habeas claim addressing his underlying criminal conviction since \nSeptember 2019, currently before Hon. Tejas Bhatt, Judge of the Superior Court. The \nhabeas court is not open to hear his claim, and has not been open since the end of March.  \n \n4.  Like my client, Robert Day had a pending habeas claim. I have learned that when counsel \nsubmitted an application for bond pending habeas for Mr. Day on the basis of COVID-19 \nand Mr. Day’s medical conditions, the habeas court held that it could not be granted \nabsent a demonstration that the petitioner would likely prevail on the underlying habeas.  \n \n5.  When someone with a current habeas files a new habeas, the habeas court’s practice is to \nconsolidate them. In addition, it will be impossible for me to make the requisite showing \nthat it is likely that my client will prevail on the merits of his habeas claim while the \ncourts, the police, the forensic lab, and all other state facilities are closed.  The habeas \nsystem in our state has only two judges and is slow moving in the best of times. It \nabsolutely does not have the capacity to hear tens, let alone hundreds or thousands, of pro \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-14   Filed 05/03/20   Page 3 of 3\nse habeas cases imminently.

There are almost three million confirmed cases \nof COVID-19 worldwide, and hundreds of thousands have died.  As a result, millions, perhaps \nbillions, of people are under orders to practice “social distancing” to avoid spreading the disease.  \nJails in urban centers such as New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia have been overrun with \ninfection and COVID-19 cases, and Connecticut Department of Correction (“DOC”) facilities are \nno exception.  Indeed, DOC has already reported that 382 of the people in its custody (and 310 \nstaff) have been infected with COVID-19 in the past month. Two people have died, and it is highly \nprobable that more will follow.   \nUnlike the general population in Connecticut and other communities around the world, \nPlaintiffs-Petitioners (“Plaintiffs”) and the classes they seek to represent have been subjected by \nDefendants-Respondents (“Defendants”) to conditions of confinement that prevent them from \navailing themselves of the basic social distancing and other public health guidelines that are \nmandated or recommended for everyone else in society.  These conditions of confinement pose a \nserious and imminent threat of severe disease and death for Plaintiffs and others in Defendants’ \ncustody.  Judicial intervention is necessary to protect their health and their lives.   \nThe conditions of confinement at DOC facilities are shockingly insufficient to protect \nPlaintiffs from infection, serious complications, or death from COVID-19.  Pandemic or no, people \ncontinue to live in crowded open dormitories and double-celled units.  The sanitation practices of \nDefendants in DOC facilities are inadequate; Defendants deny Plaintiffs and other prisoners even \nthe most basic hygiene products; and they have not sufficiently complied with guidelines from the \nCenters  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (“CDC”)  directing  correctional  institutions  to \nimplement mitigation efforts like social distancing and other best practices.  Instead, Defendants’ \nprimary response to the outbreak at DOC facilities has been to transfer members of the Classes \n1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15   Filed 04/27/20   Page 8 of 47\n \nwho have tested positive for COVID-19 to Northern Correctional Institution (“Northern”), a Level \n5 prison designed exclusively to punish, not to serve as a medical facility. Not only has this move \nbeen roundly condemned by scores of public health experts—who say it will exacerbate, not \nmitigate, the virus’s rampage through DOC facilities—but, tellingly, no other jurisdiction in the \nUnited States has resorted to putting people suffering from a novel, highly fatal illness in a \nsupermax prison. And notwithstanding the use of Northern, many of those who show symptoms \nof COVID-19 simply continue to be denied medical care, or moved from facility to facility, \nmeaning that Defendants recklessly expose those who are not symptomatic to those who are.  At \nbottom, the conditions at DOC facilities have created a rapid, uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 \nwith grave outcomes for both the incarcerated population and the surrounding communities.    \nThe stakes here could not be higher:  lives are on the line.  Courts have acknowledged the \ngravity of the situation and relied on their equitable powers to protect people held at prisons and \ndetention  facilities  during  this  once-in-a-lifetime  pandemic.    Indeed,  given  that  large-scale \noutbreaks at DOC facilities are spilling over into the surrounding communities and spreading \ninfection throughout Connecticut, Plaintiffs’ requested preliminary relief is more than justified and \nwould impose a minimal burden on Defendants and the public at large.   \nFor these reasons and those discussed below, Plaintiffs seek emergency preliminary relief. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nThe nation and the world are in the grips of the most significant pandemic in generations, \ncaused by COVID-19—a fast-moving virus that has infected millions and upended life in every \ncorner of the globe, country, and state.1  This Court is doubtless aware of the devastating effects \nCOVID-19 is having on the state of Connecticut.2  As of April 27, 2020, 3,035,177 cases have \n \n1 Compl. ¶ 16. \n2 Id.   \n2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15   Filed 04/27/20   Page 9 of 47\n \nbeen confirmed globally, with 985,374 of those cases in the United States.3  Over 55,000 \nAmericans have died.4  Connecticut alone has reported 25,269 cases of COVID-19, and 1,924 \ndeaths.5   The  virus  continues  to  spread  exponentially.    Without  effective  public  health \ninterventions, like those Plaintiffs request, the CDC projects approximately 200 million people in \nthe United States could be infected over the course of the epidemic.6   \nI.  COVID-19 POSES A GRAVE RISK OF SERIOUS INJURY AND DEATH TO \nTHOSE  INFECTED,  ESPECIALLY  INDIVIDUALS  IN  THE  MEDICALLY \nVULNERABLE CLASSES. \nCOVID-19  is  a  serious  and  potentially  fatal  respiratory  disease  caused  by  a  novel \ncoronavirus.7  COVID-19 spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets, close \npersonal contact, and from contact with contaminated surfaces and objects.8  These droplets can \ntravel up to six feet through the air to infect another person.9  The virus also spreads when people \ntouch surfaces and objects contaminated by those same respiratory droplets and then touch their \nown mouth, nose, or eyes.10  Symptomatic persons spread the disease, but so too can asymptomatic \n \n3 Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at \nJohns Hopkins University (JHU), Coronavirus Resource Center, Johns Hopkins University & Medicine, \n(last updated Apr. 27, 2020, 4:31 p.m.), https://cutt.ly/4ysesvR (last visited Apr. 27, 2020). \n4 Id. \n5  Connecticut  Open  Data,  COVID-19  Data  Resources:  Connecticut  Summary,  available  at \nhttps://cutt.ly/2yse8YA (last visited Apr. 27, 2020). \n6 Declaration of Dr. Johnathan Louis Golob, Compl.

COVID-19 also can trigger an over-response of the immune system, further \ndamaging tissues in a cytokine release syndrome that can result in widespread damage to other \norgans, including permanent injury to the kidneys (possibly leading to dialysis dependence) and \neven neurologic injury.17  These complications can develop at an alarming pace.18  Patients can \nshow the first symptoms of infection within two days after exposure, and their condition can \nseriously deteriorate in five days or sooner.19   \nFor persons over the age of 50 or with certain preexisting medical conditions, COVID-19 \npresents an even greater risk of serious symptoms and death.20  Persons with preexisting lung \ndisease, heart disease, chronic liver or kidney disease (including hepatitis and dialysis patients), \n \n11 Id. ¶¶ 8–10.   \n12 Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), Recommendation \nRegarding the Use of Cloth Face Coverings (Apr. 3, 2020), https://cutt.ly/rysekak. \n13 Golob Decl. ¶¶ 4–5.   \n14 Id. at ¶ 9. \n15 Id. \n16 Id.   \n17 Id.   \n18 Id. at ¶ 6.   \n19 Id. \n20 Golob Decl. ¶ 3.   \n4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15   Filed 04/27/20   Page 11 of 47\n \ndiabetes, compromised immune systems (such as from cancer, HIV, or other autoimmune disease), \nblood  disorders  (including  sickle  cell  disease),  inherited  metabolic  disorders,  stroke,  and \ndevelopmental delay all are at a heightened risk of serious illness and death from COVID-19.21  \nEach Plaintiff in the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses has one or more of these conditions, and \nthus faces an increased risk of serious complications or death from COVID-19. \nThere is no known cure, vaccine, or treatment for COVID-19.22  The need for care, \nincluding intensive care, and the likelihood of death, is much higher from COVID-19 than from \ninfluenza.23  According to recent estimates, the fatality rate of people with COVID-19 is about ten \ntimes higher than a severe seasonal influenza, even in advanced countries with effective health \ncare systems.24  For people in the highest risk populations, the fatality rate of COVID-19 is about \n15 percent.25  High-risk patients who survive should expect prolonged recovery, including the need \nfor extensive rehabilitation for profound reconditioning, loss of digits, neurological damage, and \nloss of respiratory capacity.26   \nThe most effective strategy for limiting the spread of the disease is social distancing—\ndeliberately keeping at least six feet of space between persons to avoid spreading the illness—\ncombined with a vigilant hygiene regimen, including washing hands frequently and thoroughly \nwith soap and water, and constant disinfecting of surfaces.27  Following the recommendation of \npublic health experts, government officials across the country have taken extraordinary measures \nto implement social distancing to minimize the spread of the disease, including shutting down \n \n21 Id.   \n22 Giftos Decl. ¶ 7; Golob Decl. ¶ 10.   \n23 Golob Decl. ¶ 4.   \n24 Id.   \n25 Id.   \n26 Id. \n27 Giftos Decl. ¶ 7.   \n5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15   Filed 04/27/20   Page 12 of 47\n \nschools, non-essential businesses, and courts.

THE CONDITIONS AT CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES PLACE ALL PERSONS \nAT AN EVEN GREATER AND IMMEDIATE RISK OF COVID-19 INFECTION \nTHAN MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC-AT-LARGE. \nThe state of Connecticut has not been spared from COVID-19, but Connecticut’s DOC is \nunique for the dramatic pace at which the virus has overtaken its facilities, wreaking havoc and \ninfecting hundreds of prisoners and staff alike.   \nIn mid-March, public health experts in Connecticut experienced in correctional health \nbegan  to  express  “grave  concern  that,  absent  immediate  action,  COVID-19  will  overrun \nConnecticut’s jails and prisons” and that “Connecticut has days, not weeks, to chart a different \nfuture.”29 They joined a growing chorus of infectious disease doctors, epidemiologists, and \nspecialists in correctional health, all of whom warned that a virus like COVID-19 “create[s] a \nperfect storm for correctional settings” because of ease of transmission, lack of prevention \nopportunities, concentration of people with chronic health issues, and the fact that “despite being \nphysically secure, jails and prison are not isolated from the community.”30   \nTheir warnings are now playing out in real-time. The first positive test of an incarcerated \nperson at a DOC facility was announced on March 30.31  In less than a month, that number has \n \n29 Letter from Dr. Emily Wang et al. to Governor Lamont (attached as Exhibit A). \n30 Declaration of Dr. Josiah Rich, Compl.

On April 2, three days \nafter the first positive test, 16 DOC staff members and 8 incarcerated people had tested positive for \nCOVID-19.  By April 6, both those numbers more than doubled, to 32 DOC staff members and 21 \nincarcerated people.  By April 7, they had grown exponentially: 41 DOC staff members and 44 \nincarcerated people, with 53 prisoner test results still pending.35  \n  On April 8, DOC announced it had begun transferring people who had tested positive to \nNorthern; as of that day, the number of incarcerated people at DOC facilities who tested positive \nhad grown to 46 across 13 different DOC facilities.36  But DOC’s use of Northern has in no way \nstopped the surge in positive cases.  As of April 13, they stood at 104 staff and 166 incarcerated \npeople.37  That day, the first incarcerated person died of COVID-19; another person followed, and \nothers have died immediately after being released from custody.38  \nAs of this writing, April 27, 310 staff and 382 prisoners have tested positive for COVID-\n19—meaning that DOC has gone from one infected prisoner to nearly 700 people infected across \n \n32 See Connecticut State Department of Correction, Health Information and Advisories: Coronavirus \nInformation, available at https://cutt.ly/xyr57np (last accessed Apr. 27, 2020). \n33  First  Conn.

In just the few \ndays since this lawsuit was filed, one Plaintiff, Mr. Roe, was confirmed positive for COVID-19, \nand has just been transferred to Northern.39   \nDefendants cannot claim to be caught unaware by these grim numbers.  As public health \nexperts have said for weeks, correctional facilities like those run by DOC are the exact type of \ncongregate environment—where people live, eat, bathe, and sleep in close proximity—in which \nCOVID-19 infection thrives.40  This increased risk is present in every prison, given the nature of \nprison.41  People incarcerated in these facilities are forced into close contact with each other and \nprison staff, including corrections officers.42  They cannot achieve the requisite social distancing \nneeded to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19.43  They likely share or touch objects used \noften by others and cleaned infrequently.44  In addition to eating, sleeping, recreating, and living \nclose to each other, they have to share bathroom facilities—showers, toilets, and sinks—without \nadequate cleaning between uses.45  Insufficient medical treatment capabilities also make it nearly \nimpossible to treat infected people properly, let alone prevent the further spread of COVID-19 \nthroughout the incarcerated population.46     \n  Additionally, about 40 percent of incarcerated people nationally are estimated to have at \nleast one chronic illness, including Plaintiffs Williams-Void, Doe, and Roe.47  Many of these \n \n39 Declaration of Jane Roe ¶ 4 (Apr. 23, 2020) (“Roe Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit B.   \n40 Giftos Decl. ¶ 13; Affirmation of Brie Williams, M.D., Compl.

THE CURRENT CONDITIONS IN WHICH DEFENDANTS HAVE CONFINED \nPLAINTIFFS AND CLASS MEMBERS ONLY EXACERBATE THE ALREADY \nEXTREME AND IMMINENT DANGER THEY FACE OF CONTRACTING AND \nPOSSIBLY DYING FROM COVID-19. \nAs detailed in the Complaint, Defendants’ response to the pandemic has been fatally \npiecemeal and reactive.56  As of mid-March, DOC spokespeople were boldly proclaiming that \nthere was no need to plan specifically for COVID-19; the department could simply recycle a 2007 \ninfluenza outline.57  Even today, Defendants’ response is neither uniform nor comprehensive, but \na grab-bag of aspirational half-measures that does not provide constitutionally adequate conditions \nof confinement.  Declarations submitted in support of Plaintiffs’ motion reveal a dangerous \ncombination of close proximity, conflicting and loose standards, and dire lack of sanitation and \nmedical resources—so much so that the DOC’s own staff continues to issue urgent, public pleas \nfor assistance.58  The disparities between what the CDC recommends, the policies DOC has put in \nplace, and what is actually happening in prisons are stark.  \nThe declarations from Plaintiffs and other incarcerated people that are attached to this \nmotion document the multiple ways Defendants defy CDC recommendations by continuing to \nforce those in their custody to sleep, eat, recreate, bathe, and use the phone in close proximity, \nwith minimal efforts to minimize the spread of COVID-19.59  These declarations also document \n \n55 Golob Decl. ¶ 12.   \n56 See Compl. ¶¶ 12.   \n57  Kelan  Lyons,  Elderly  Prisoners  in  Connecticut  Vulnerable  to  Potential  Coronavirus  Outbreak, \nHARTFORD COURANT (Mar. 11, 2020), https://cutt.ly/4ysyKVY. \n58 Mike Savino, DOC Workers Rally Outside Headquarters, Demanding Better Conditions, EYEWITNESS \nNEWS 3 (WFSB) (Apr. 24, 2020), https://cutt.ly/OysyCvG (describing rally by DOC staff for more \nprotective equipment, minimizing contact with prisoners, and ability to work remotely).   \n59 See generally Declarations of Pattikate Williams-Void (Apr. 24, 2020) (“Williams-Void Decl.”), attached \nhereto as Exhibit C; Thomas Caves (Apr. 17, 2020) (“Caves Decl.”), attached hereto Exhibit D; William \n11 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15   Filed 04/27/20   Page 18 of 47\n \nthe deleterious effect of Defendants’ refusal to act in a coordinated, comprehensive, systematic \nfashion by revealing just how much pandemic response measures vary by facility, building, and \neven unit.

Defendants Have Taken Insufficient Steps to Limit the Spread Of COVID-19 \nin DOC Facilities. \nDefying public health experts’ urgent recommendation that they take concerted, wide-scale \naction to de-densify DOC facilities, and notwithstanding the unprecedentedly dangerous nature of \nthis global pandemic, Defendants have consistently refused to take steps to release anyone from \ntheir custody outside of routine, one-by-one mechanisms meant for a non-emergency context.60  \n \nBruno (Apr. 14, 2020) (“Bruno Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit E; Angel Caballero (Apr. 22, 2020) \n(“Caballero Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit F; Marcus Champagne (Apr. 23, 2020) (“Champagne \nDecl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit G; Alex Flemming (Apr. 21, 2020) (“Flemming Decl.”), attached hereto \nas Exhibit H; Tyquwane Gilchrest (Apr. 23, 2020) (“Gilchrest Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit I; Chaz \nGulley (Apr. 8, 2020) (“Gulley Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit J; Zain Hussain (Apr. 17, 2020) \n(“Hussain Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit K; Roger Johnson (Apr. 17, 2020) (“Johnson Decl.”), attached \nhereto as Exhibit L; Frank Kelly (Apr. 16, 2020) (“Kelly Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit M; Austin Kerr \n(Apr. 20, 2020) (“Kerr Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit N; Kezlyn Mendez (Apr. 15, 2020) (“Mendez \nDecl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit O; Robert Miller (Apr. 20, 2020) (“Miller Decl.”), attached hereto as \nExhibit P; Luis Pagan (Apr. 8, 2020) (“Pagan Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit Q; Jonathan Pape (Apr. \n22, 2020) (“Pape Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit R; Kyle Lamar Paschal-Barros (Apr. 17, 2020) \n(“Paschal-Barros Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit S; Chad Petitpas (Apr. 22, 2020) (“Petitpas Decl.”), \nattached hereto as Exhibit T; Ken Pierce (Apr. 15, 2020) (“Pierce Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit U; \nDarien Rosario (Apr. 24, 2020) (“Rosario Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit V; Christopher Russell (Apr. \n22, 2020) (“Russell Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit W; Tyrone Spence (Apr. 16, 2020) (“Spence Decl.”), \nattached hereto as Exhibit X; Anthony Toscano (Apr. 14, 2020) (“Toscano Decl.”), attached hereto as \nExhibit Y; Joshua Wilcox (Apr. 23, 2020) (“Wilcox Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit Z; Tre McPherson \n(Apr. 24, 2020) (“McPherson Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit AA. \n60 DOC’s touted numbers of releases are both incomplete and misleading.  For example, that the state’s \nprison population was lower at the outset of this pandemic than in past years has nothing to do with whether \nDOC has released anyone because of the pandemic’s dangers.  DOC has similarly glossed over whether \nrecent releases have anything to do with the pandemic, rather than people maxing out on their sentences or \nfewer people entering the prison system.

Hartford Correctional Center, which has seen outbreaks in \nnearly every building, houses 853 people.  Willard-Cybulski Correctional Institution, which has \nsimilarly seen mass outbreaks, houses 913 people. \nAlthough Defendants now transfer people who test positive for COVID-19 to Northern,63 \nDefendants have not leveraged the resulting additional capacity to implement recommended and \nnecessary social distancing measures.  Notwithstanding seven weeks’ worth of executive orders \nDefendant Lamont has issued to protect public health during the a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic—\nwhich repeatedly highlight the particular threat COVID-19 poses to institutional and congregate \nhousing64—Defendants still force those in their custody to live and breathe “on top of one another,” \nby the dozens or hundreds.65   \nMany DOC facilities have dormitory-style housing in which up to 120 people live side-by-\nside in one room.  Pandemic notwithstanding, these remain unchanged, with dozens or hundreds \nof people still sleeping on bunk beds a few feet apart.66    \n \n61  Conn.

Social \ndistancing in a cell is impossible: cellmates sleep in bunk beds and share a desk, a toilet, and a sink \nin each cell.67  And like their dormitory counterparts, DOC facilities with double cells hold \nupwards of 80 people in each unit.68  Any time people in double-celled units are out of their cells, \nthey share each and every inch of physical space with their entire unit in common areas.  \nThe risks of continuing to house a large number of people in a dormitory or double-celling \npeople during a global pandemic are apparent and defy logic.  DOC’s dormitories and cells are too \nsmall for people to stand inside and remain six feet away from each other, as the CDC has urged—\nif not ordered—hundreds of millions of Americans to do.  There simply is no way for someone to \npractice social distancing while confined to a dormitory or cell with other people.69 \nDefendants do not allow those in their custody any opportunity to practice social distancing \neven outside of their cells.  Multiple times a day, people receive their meals together and take them \nto sit “shoulder-to-shoulder and knee-to-knee” at tables in their unit’s common areas.70  Needless \nto say, this is far more than the five-person limit Connecticut has placed for any congregation of \npersons.71  Even those who receive meals to eat on individual bunks or in cells are unable to avoid \nproximity to others, as they must stand “right next to each other in the line” to get them,72 or their \nbunks are so close together that there are still “10 people within four feet of each” other.73   \n \n67 See, e.g., Pape Decl. ¶ 5 (he and his cellmate are “always bumping into each other when we walk[] around \nthe cell at the same time”); Spence Decl. ¶ 4 (his cell is “cramped, and it is impossible to stay more than \nfive feet away from one another”).  \n68 See Spence Decl. ¶ 2 (90 people housed in E dorm at Garner); Caves Decl. ¶ 1 (82 or 83 people housed \nin B pod at Corrigan); Rosario Decl. ¶ 2 (150 housed in E unit at Osborn).   \n69 See e.g., Hussain Decl. ¶ 11; Bruno Decl. ¶ 3; Russell Decl. ¶ 4. \n70 Petitpas Decl. ¶ 5; see also Russell Decl. ¶ 4; Hussain Decl. ¶ 11; Toscano Decl. ¶ 5; Spence Decl. ¶ 5; \nMendez Decl. ¶ 5. \n71 See Lamont Exec.

Those in DOC custody share phones with \ntheir entire units.  Because visitors have been prohibited since mid-March, telephone calls are the \nonly lifeline to friends and family.  As a result, the telephone bays frequently are crowded, and \npeople must jam shoulder-to-shoulder next to each other.74  Phones are shared among tens or \nhundreds of people every day.75   \nFinally, all those in DOC custody share showers—and in dormitory settings, toilets and \nsinks—with their entire unit.76  Like phones, showers are sometimes sanitized and sometimes \nnot.77  Given these conditions, incarcerated people have described themselves as “lab rat[s] trapped \nin a small place waiting to get sick.”  Id. ¶ 12; see also Pierce ¶ 4 (“I feel like it is just a matter of \ntime until we all get infected with the virus.”).  \nB.  Defendants Maintain Dangerous, Unsanitary Conditions at DOC Facilities \nand Do Not Provide Appropriate Medical Care. \nDefendants also do not use sanitary procedures sufficient to promote proper personal \nhygiene or ensure that common areas shared by many incarcerated people remain clean.  Many in \nDOC custody have observed no changes to cleaning protocols during the pandemic.78  For \nexample, Defendants do not sanitize or clean the unit showers between uses, even though tens or \nhundreds  of individuals share them.79  Most other routine items, such as “[h]andcuffs and \nshackles[,] are used repeatedly throughout the day, and are not sanitized between uses.”80  Whether \n \n74 See Caves Decl. ¶ 6 (explaining “you’re right next to the next person” when using phones).   \n75 Toscano Decl. ¶ 7 (6 phones shared with 75 people); Rosario Decl. ¶¶ 2, 8 (4 phones shared with 150 \npeople); McPherson Decl. ¶¶ 5, 8 (phones shared with 48 people); Pagan Decl. ¶¶ 2, 8 (4 phones shared \nwith 40 people); Gulley Decl. ¶¶ 2, 6 (1 phone shared with 48 people).  \n76 See e.g., Toscano Decl. ¶ 7 (9 showers shared with 75 people); Rosario Decl. ¶¶ 2, 8 (4 showers with 150 \npeople).

Although regular, frequent handwashing is vital \nfor limiting the spread of COVID-19, and CDC guidance establishes that prisons should “[p]rovide \na no-cost supply of soap to incarcerated/detained persons, sufficient to allow frequent hand \nwashing,” Defendants still have not provided many people in their custody with soap.83  In that \ncase, those who cannot afford soap do not clean their hands.84  Some incarcerated people have \nbeen provided soap only when they complained,85 while others have received small amounts only \nrecently.86  Notwithstanding the lack of soap, “alcohol based sanitizer,” which Defendant Lamont \nand the CDC have concluded greatly reduces the spread of COVID-19,87 is prohibited to prisoners \nin his custody.88   \n  CDC guidance provides that doorknobs, light switches, sink handles, countertops, toilets, \ntoilet handles, recreation equipment, kiosks, and telephones be cleaned “several times a day.”89  \nYet in most facilities, Defendants have made no effort to increase cleaning of common spaces, \n \n81 See Spence Decl. ¶ 8 \n82 Toscano Decl. ¶¶ 2, 7 (6 phones shared with 75 people, sanitized once per day); Rosario Decl. ¶¶ 2, 8 (4 \nphones shared with 150 people, wiped down once); Williams-Void Decl. ¶ 9 (wipes down shared phone \nwith a personal rag because she does not think it has been cleaned); McPherson Decl. ¶¶ 5,8 (phones shared \nwith 48 people and cleaned only between rec shifts); Kelly Decl. ¶ 6 (phones not cleaned between use).  \n83 See Mendez Decl. ¶ 6; Flemming Decl. ¶ 10; Spence Decl. ¶ 6; Pierce Decl. ¶¶ 7, 9.  \n84 Petitpas Decl. ¶ 10.   \n85 Pierce Decl. ¶ 7 (one bar of soap since he complained). \n86 Caves Decl. ¶ 3 (one small bar a week ago); Champagne Decl. ¶ 5 (two bars of soap in past month); \nToscano Decl. ¶ 6 (less than two weeks ago, staff started giving out soap consistently).   \n87 Gov.

Rather than seek treatment, \nincarcerated people desperately try to hide symptoms because they are terrified of being sent to \nNorthern.138  Defendants’ use of Northern thus exacerbates the risks to Plaintiffs and the Class \nMembers.

Defendants  Do  Not  Properly  Screen,  Test,  or  Quarantine  Persons  with \nCOVID-19 Exposure.  \nEven  considering  their  use  of  Northern,  Defendants’  measures  to  screen,  test,  and \nquarantine are woefully inadequate.  Not only do symptomatic people wait days for medical care, \nbut Defendants have made no efforts to identify and isolate individuals at high risk for serious \nillness, those with potential exposure to the virus, or those with symptoms consistent with COVID-\n19.  To the contrary—and notwithstanding high rates of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic \ntransmission—they recklessly transfer those who have been exposed to COVID-19 to other \npopulations and facilities.   \nMost troubling is the abject failure to treat symptomatic individuals.  People are kept in \ntheir congregate housing units for days or even weeks after reporting COVID-19 symptoms and \nrequesting medical care.141  Some are refused medical care altogether.142  The first prisoner to die \n \n139 David Cloud, et al., The Ethical Use of Medical Isolation—Not Solitary Confinement—to Reduce \nCOVID-19 Transmission in Correctional Settings (Apr. 9, 2020).   \n140 See Miller Decl. ¶¶ 5–9 (detailing how he was transferred to Northern after refusing a meal in order to \nprotest lack of cleaning supplies and sanitation and hygiene measures).  \n141  Rosario  Decl.  ¶ 10  (symptomatic  people  only  quarantined  after  four  days);  Gilchrest  Decl.  ¶ 5 \n(symptomatic for two weeks “before anyone did anything,” despite requests to staff).   \n142 Champagne Decl. ¶ 10 (person asked repeatedly to go to medical but refused, though two others were \ntaken).  \n22 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15   Filed 04/27/20   Page 29 of 47\n \nfrom COVID-19 in custody had reportedly had a fever of 101 degrees and been begging to be seen \nbefore he finally was transferred to a hospital.143  \nDefendants also have recklessly moved people from place to place, including those \nexposed to COVID-19.144  Officials at Osborn, for example, reintegrated quarantined inmates into \nthe broader facility.145  People who seek to be tested are kept alongside those who are ill, even \nbefore they themselves test positive.146  One person who felt ill was kept in a cell at Bridgeport \nwith three other people who had tested positive, though he himself was never tested.147  He was \nunable to make phone calls or shower, and he was not given sheets, so he slept on a bare \nmattress.148  The staff with whom he interacted during this time were not wearing masks.

Plaintiffs and the Proposed Classes (including the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses) \nwill face the immediate, serious, and apparent risk of severe illness and possible death unless the \nCourt  intervenes.171   This  is  not  a  speculative  harm.    Cases  of  COVID-19  are  growing \nexponentially.  As of the time of this filing, 985,374 cases have been reported in the United States, \nwith 25,269 cases and 1,924 deaths in Connecticut.  More than 600 of these cases and two deaths \nare attributable to Defendants Lamont and Cook’s failures.   \nGiven the serious and often lethal nature of this disease, and the overwhelming strain it has \ncaused to our healthcare system, Plaintiffs and the Proposed Classes have established a serious \nrisk that, without the requested relief, they will be infected by coronavirus and develop COVID-\n19.  Members of the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses may die if not released.  Even those \nPlaintiffs and Proposed Class members who get infected and survive still face the prospect of a \nprolonged and painful recovery, including the need for extensive rehabilitation for profound \nreconditioning, loss of digits, neurological damage, and the loss of respiratory capacity.174  The \nrisks here are all the more extreme, given that DOC does not provide conditions of basic health \nand safety sufficient to protect Plaintiffs, the Proposed Classes as a whole, or members of the \nMedically Vulnerable Subclasses, who face the most significant risk of all.175   \n \n171 See, e.g., Basank v.

Earlier this month, the \nDistrict of Maryland recognized that “once COVID-19 is introduced into a detention facility, it \nspreads  like  wildfire,”  creating  “a  high  likelihood  of  irreparable  health  consequences”  for \nincarcerated people “that could not be alleviated without release.”176  The court explained that \nplacing incarcerated people with COVID-19 symptoms in isolation “does not remove the risk that \nthe virus will spread quickly once inside the facility,” which creates an increased “risk of death or \nserious  illness”  for  “high-risk  detainees,”  like  those  members  of  the  Medically  Vulnerable \nSubclasses.177   \nThis risk is even more apparent when, as here, correctional settings have not adopted the \nmitigation efforts recommended by the CDC.  For instance, the Western District of New York \nobserved that when facilities do not “isolate higher risk individuals,” do not test “all incoming \ndetainees or the staff that comes and goes” for COVID-19, do not provide prisoners with masks or \nother PPE, and allow prisoners to “eat their meals in communal settings and share bathing \nfacilities,” the “imminent risk” to prisoners’ “health, safety, and lives” constitutes irreparable \nharm.178  Courts around the country agree.179  Immediate action from this Court is necessary to \nprotect Plaintiffs, the Proposed Classes, and the members of the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses. \n \n176 Mem.

Plaintiffs  are  Substantially  Likely  to  Prevail  on  Their  Claim  that  the \nGovernment is Deliberately Indifferent to their Serious Medical Needs. \nThe Post-adjudication Class’ claim in Count 3 of the Complaint presents the Court with \nthe question of whether a failure to take medically necessary steps to prevent widespread COVID-\n19 infection in Connecticut prisons constitutes deliberate indifference to serious medical need.  \nThe evidence demonstrates that Plaintiffs will prevail. \n“[W]hen the state takes a person into custody” pursuant to a sentence of incarceration, thus \n“severely limiting his ability to care for himself, and then is deliberately indifferent to his medical \nneeds, the Eighth Amendment’s proscription against the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain \nis violated.”180  The same constitutional right exists for pretrial detainees and civil detainees, \nalthough their protection springs from the Fourteenth Amendment and does not depend on a \ndefendant’s awareness of the danger’s existence.181   \nIn the case of either class of incarcerated people, a plaintiff “must show that the conditions, \neither alone or in combination, pose an unreasonable risk of serious damage to his health.”182  The \nunreasonable risk is actionable whether it results in damage occurring at the time of pleading, or, \nwhether it will “cause serious illness and needless suffering the next week or month or year.”183  \nThe existence of an unreasonable risk of harm depends “not on the officials’ perception of the risk \nof harm, but solely on whether the facts . . . show that the risk of serious harm was substantial.”184   \n \n180 Charles v.

As discussed above, DOC facilities place detainees at an even greater and \nimmediate risk of contracting COVID-19 than members of the public-at-large.  Yet, the current \nconditions of confinement fail to protect Plaintiffs and pretrial detainees from this risk.  Defendants \nhave not implemented sufficient social distancing practices at of the DOC facilities, and maintain \ndangerous, unsanitary conditions.  Most disturbingly, Defendants do not quarantine or provide the \nmedical care necessary to protect detainees from the threat of COVID-19 spreading further in DOC \nfacilities across the state. \nAs was the case in Thakker, a recent decision from the Middle District of Pennsylvania that \nordered the immediate release of civil detainees, the conditions of confinement at DOC facilities \nhave “no rational relationship between a legitimate government objective” and keeping Plaintiffs \nand pretrial detainees in the Proposed Pre-adjudication Class “detained in unsanitary, tightly-\npacked environments.”206  Rather, doing so clearly constitutes unconstitutional punishment that \nviolates the Fourteenth Amendment rights of all pretrial detainees in the Proposed Class.207  \n \n201 Almighty Supreme Born Allah v.

Without a Viable Way to Safely Detain Plaintiffs, Injunctive Relief Releasing \nMedically Vulnerable Class Members Is the Only Option.  \nAs outlined in both the Giftos and Rich declarations, the medical standard of care to reduce \nthe risk of death from COVID-19 to vulnerable people is the transfer of the Medically Vulnerable \nSubclasses and additional Class Members to alternative custody such as home confinement.  Such \nremediation also creates physical distancing for those remaining in prisons.210  In addition to the \n \n208 See  Basank, 2020 WL 1481503, at *1, 5 (S.D.N.Y.

Thus, (1) immediate release of the most medically \nvulnerable persons, followed by (2) frequent reporting, improved health protocols, and—if public \nhealth still mandates—(3) further release of additional Class Members, are the necessary and least \nintrusive  means  of  vindicating  Class  Members’  constitutional  rights  and  preventing  grave \nirreparable harm for the proposed Classes and the greater Connecticut community. \nDespite the unquestionable risk posed by COVID-19 to Plaintiffs, Class Members, and by \nextension, the public at large and its healthcare providers who will be required to care for more \nand more incarcerated people who become seriously ill from COVID-19, Defendants have not \ntaken such steps.  These facts easily support “an inference of deliberate indifference.”   \nE.  The Balance of Equities Favors Granting Relief to the Proposed Classes. \nWhen weighing the balance of equities, this Court “must consider the effect on each party \nof the granting or withholding of the requested relief.”211  In this dispute, the balance of equities \n \n211 Amoco Production Co. v. Vill. of Gambell, 480 U.S. 531, 542 (1987).   \n34 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15   Filed 04/27/20   Page 41 of 47\n \nweighs heavily in favor of granting Plaintiffs relief, as an injunction in their favor will not \n“substantially injure other interested parties.”212   \nRather, given the nature of the circumstances here and the COVID-19 pandemic in general, \nnot issuing preliminary relief would cause significant injury to the parties and the general public.  \nBeyond the fact that “[t]he balance of the equities tips sharply” in favor of Plaintiffs and the \nProposed Classes, especially given that they face “irreparable harm to their constitutional rights \nand health,”213 the public interest clearly favors granting preliminary relief because Connecticut \nas a whole escapes further COVID-19 spread by stamping out each infection hotspot wherever it \nmay occur.   \nBy contrast, Defendants’ countervailing interest in indefinitely detaining Plaintiffs and the \nProposed Classes in obviously dangerous conditions is weak, at best.  State officials already have \nshown a willingness to release other prisoners in an effort to stem the spread of coronavirus.  There \nis no compelling or even rational reason to deny the same treatment to these incarcerated people, \nparticularly members of the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses, who are at the highest risk of \nCOVID-19.  Indeed, Defendants could undertake a particularized inquiry to identify and release \nthose who are at increased risk of serious complications from COVID-19, and to the extent \ncountervailing  penal  interests  favor  continued  incarceration  for  certain  at-risk  individuals, \nDefendants could release other individuals to reduce population at DOC facilities and allow those \nwho remain to comply with CDC guidelines.214  Further, other than the administrative burden of \n \n212 Doe v. Gonzales, 386 F. Supp. 2d 66, 82 (D. Conn. 2005).  See Doe v. Univ. of Connecticut, No. 20-cv-\n92, 2020 WL 406356, at *5 (D. Conn.

If Defendants \nseek to retain individual class members in custody for a purported penal interest, the Court should require \nDefendants to offer proof of judicially-recorded findings—by clear and convincing evidence—that the \nindividual poses such a serious risk of flight or danger to others that no conditions of release can mitigate.  \n35 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15   Filed 04/27/20   Page 42 of 47\n \nenacting requested policies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 throughout DOC—which, frankly, \nDefendants should already be doing—there is no other “harm” to Defendants should this Court \nissue preliminary relief. \nAny burden on Defendants is far outweighed by what is at stake for Plaintiffs, the Proposed \nClasses, and the public-at-large should preliminary relief be denied.  People are dying.  This Court \nshould do its part to help prevent Plaintiffs and the Proposed Classes from becoming another \nstatistic in this horrific chapter of our nation’s history. \nF.  The Public Interest Is Best Served by Minimizing the Spread of COVID-19 \nthrough  Social  Distancing  and  Hygiene  Practices,  but  Those  Steps  Are \nDifficult to Implement at DOC Facilities. \nFinally, the public’s interest weighs in favor of granting Plaintiffs’ injunction.  As in this \ncase, where Plaintiffs have demonstrated that Defendants have violated their and the Proposed \nClasses’ constitutional rights, injunctive relief always is in the public interest.215  That interest—\nfaithful enforcement of the Constitution—alone justifies the requested injunctive relief.  Moreover, \nplainly here, the public and Plaintiffs’ interests overlap: both benefit from ensuring community \nand individual health and safety.216  And on the facts here, that independently sufficient interest is \nbuttressed by the undeniable public interest in minimizing the already unprecedented spread of \nCOVID-19 throughout the nation, generally, and at DOC facilities, specifically.217   \n \n215 See Sajous v. Decker, 2018 WL 2357266, at *13 (S.D.N.Y.

With no vaccine or cure, each new infection breeds \nexponentially more infected persons.  Healthcare professionals accordingly agree that the most \ncritical actions that can be taken are preventive measures such as self-isolating, maintaining a \ndistance of six feet from other persons, and frequent disinfection.  These measures are lacking at \nDOC facilities, as detailed above, thus warranting immediate action from this Court.  But even \nwith the best intentions, high-risk persons like members of the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses \ncannot avoid the risk of infection.  The only viable mitigation tactic for those incarcerated people \nis release.   \nThe virus is spreading throughout the incarcerated population and cannot be contained \nwithin DOC’s walls.  COVID-19 has already spread across DOC staff members who have contact \nwith communities outside of the DOC.222  Cases of infected staff members will only increase while \nthe contagion sweeps throughout the prisoner population.  DOC staff has and will continue to, \nperhaps unknowingly, spread infection among the surrounding communities.  The only certain \nway to significantly hinder further spread of the virus within DOC facilities—and then from DOC \nfacilities to the greater Connecticut community, and further on—is for this Court to immediately \norder that Defendants impose necessary mitigation efforts throughout DOC facilities, and order \nthe immediate release of its most at-risk prisoners.   \nSecond, there is a strong public interest in minimizing the spread and thus the impact of \nCOVID-19 on the local, state, and national health care system.  Recent data show that in the most \nlikely infection scenarios, Connecticut hospitals will face a critical bed shortage in a matter of \nweeks.223  A large-scale infection at DOC will cause spillover into supporting hospitals, not to \n \n222 See Compl. ¶ 43.  \n223 Alex Putterman & Emily Brindley, Connecticut’s COVID-19 Peak Could be Two Weeks Away; The \nState Won’t Have Enough Hospital Beds or ICU Options When That Happens, Model Predicts, HARTFORD \nCOURANT (Apr. 3, 2020), available at https://bit.ly/3a2e6Ji. \n37 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15   Filed 04/27/20   Page 44 of 47\n \nmention increase the number of sick individuals in the community needing prompt and critical \nmedical care.224  The public interest is best served by taking all necessary steps to reduce infection, \nslow the spread of the virus, and provide all necessary and available support to prevent the collapse \nof the Connecticut hospital network. \nFinally, it cannot be overstated that the public interest is served by protecting those at \nelevated risk and with particular medical vulnerabilities from the ruthless nature of the virus.  On \nthe whole, populations like those detained at DOC face heightened risk of exposure and infection \nbecause of overcrowding and other problems existing at every detention facility across the country; \nsuch risks are even higher for the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses.  And the risk is not limited \nonly to incarcerated people, given the close proximity with which DOC staff members interact \nwith DOC population.  The release of individuals most vulnerable to COVID-19 thus reduces the \noverall health risk for DOC prisoners and staff alike.  By decreasing the number of prisoners, DOC \ncan institute greater and safer social distancing practices and prevent the need for increased \nnumbers of staff on a given shift.  Immediate release of the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses thus \nnot  only  imposes  minimal  harm  to  the  government,  it  also  furthers  the  public  interest  in \nmaintaining a healthy and orderly environment throughout this crisis. \nUnsurprisingly, courts acknowledge the weighty public interest when granting injunctive \nrelief where incarcerated people face similarly grave threats to their health.  At bottom, “[t]he \npublic has a critical interest in preventing the further spread of the coronavirus.”229  Further \noutbreak at DOC facilities, like the detention center in Castillo, would “endanger all of us—[the \n \n224 See Williams Aff. ¶ 4, 17 (explaining that in a world-wide pandemic, “correctional health is public \nhealth,” and thus, “The Entire Community is at Risk if Prison Populations Are Not Reduced”).   \n229 Castillo v.

That tragedy will have far-reaching effects not only for the \nthousands of Connecticut residents who live and work in correctional facilities, their families and \ncommunities, but also for the population of the state as a whole. Connecticut’s healthcare system \nsimply does not have the capacity to treat a massive outbreak in the incarcerated population at the \nsame time as it treats patients throughout the rest of the state. As jails and prisons become \nflashpoints for infection, the outbreak will overwhelm already limited state healthcare resources.  \n \nConnecticut has days, not weeks, to chart a different future. Under current conditions, in \nwhich there is no cure and no widespread testing, the thousands of Connecticut residents who live \nand work in correctional facilities are simply unable to practice the most effective method of \nprevention: social distancing. To create the requisite spacing of 6 feet between individuals, the \nState must (a) rapidly decrease the density of its prisons, jails, and halfway houses and (b) \n  1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 6\nimplement humane and evidence-based approaches to protect the health of incarcerated individuals \nand staff alike. Success is possible but will require coordinated, urgent action among all relevant \nagencies, including the Department of Correction, the judiciary, the Chief State’s Attorney, law \nenforcement, the Department of Public Health, and the Connecticut Department of Housing. We \ncall upon you to use the full powers of your office to lead the way through this public health \nemergency.  \n \nI.  The Public Health Perspective \nCOVID-19 is a highly infectious disease. Due to its novelty, there exist few tools for \ncontainment and even fewer for treatment. The scientific community currently lacks a vaccine or \ncure. Neither the United States nor the state of Connecticut possesses sufficient resources to screen \nor test individuals, and projections show that, absent extreme intervention, infections will rapidly \noutpace available healthcare resources. We commend that your office has already taken decisive \naction to limit exposure among most state residents by ordering one of the few proven prevention \nmethods:  social  distancing.  As  already  seen  in  the  reduced  rates  of  new  infections,  social \ndistancing works. \nUnfortunately,  effective  social  distancing  is  impossible  under  typical  conditions  in \nConnecticut’s correctional facilities. In Connecticut’s jails and lower security level prisons, \nincarcerated people sleep within feet of each other and use communal bathrooms, mess halls, \ndayrooms, and showers. Even in maximum security facilities, many people are double-celled and \nshare spaces to eat, bathe, and recreate. Further, while the Department of Correction has already \ntaken important actions, such as suspending visitors and volunteers, there is still a steady flow of \npeople  into  and  among  facilities.  Staff,  officers,  contractors,  and  vendors  are  still  moving \nthroughout and between facilities and they all link the facilities with surrounding communities. \nThese individuals can introduce the virus into the facility or contract it themselves and transmit it \nto others in the community. \nThe Department of Correction has stated that it is employing standard measures used to \ncontain other communicable diseases, such as the flu, but these are inadequate in the face of the \nnovel coronavirus. COVID-19 is estimated to be nearly 3 times more contagious than the flu and \nis deadlier. Furthermore, we are learning more about this novel coronavirus every day and it is \nbecoming increasingly clear that a significant percent of infections are transmitted by people even \nbefore they develop symptoms, meaning that there is no screening practice (checking temperatures \nor asking about symptoms) that is adequate. Additionally, whereas the flu is transmitted only by \nlarge droplets (i.e., 6 feet of distancing protects people), COVID-19 is now known to be passed in \nthe air as well. Under these circumstances, even heightened hygiene practices—frequent washing \nof hands with soap, regular bleaching and disinfection of public surfaces, and the like—are \ninsufficient. Further, proper containment and treatment of the novel coronavirus will require \nfacilities to quarantine people and will surely put a strain on the already understaffed healthcare \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 6\nsystem in the Department of Correction. At Yale-New Haven Hospital, we have already seen that \nas more people have become sick, staff have become sick as well, and we are struggling to develop \nadequate staffing plans. Sick individuals will need to be sent to community-based hospitals, which \nthemselves are already struggling to provide adequate care to others.  \nWhile more must be done in the coming weeks and months, as a starting point, we suggest \nthe following immediate actions:  \n  1. To the maximum extent possible, reduce the number of people entering and re-\nentering the system. We applaud the state for already making efforts to mitigate dangers in this \narea, as announced in the Department of Correction’s March 24 release. Police and State’s \nAttorneys should decline to arrest or prosecute individuals except where an individual poses a \nserious threat to public safety. Parole officers should halt the reincarceration of people on technical \nparole violations.  \n  2. Immediately release, to the maximum extent possible, people detained pretrial. As \nof today, we estimate that there are 2,905 unsentenced (mostly pretrial) people in custody, 95 of \nwhom are 60 or older. For the duration of the pandemic, people should be presumptively released \non personal recognizance, absent a showing of a compelling threat to public safety. \n  3. Immediately release all people convicted of nonviolent offenses who are scheduled \nto  be  released  in  90  days,  all  people  who  are  eligible  for  parole  and  community \nsupervision/release, and anyone incarcerated for a technical parole, probation violation, or \nconditional discharge. As of today, we estimate that there are 4,112 people in custody with fewer \nthan 90 days left on their sentences, 201 of whom are 60 or older. Additionally, we estimate that \n1,503 people are currently in custody for violation of probation or conditional discharge, 51 of \nwhom are 60 or older. The state should continue to exercise the use of transitional supervision \nmore aggressively to facilitate the release of people with shorter sentences. Additionally, the \nConnecticut Board of Pardons and Parole should expedite the release of people already found \nsuitable for release on parole, expedite all review processes for people eligible for parole, exercise \nits power to commute sentences, and use its discretion to grant compassionate parole release. The \nBoard should refrain, however, from requiring transitional housing as part of that process, in order \nto prevent the spread of COVID-19 within these congregate settings.  \n  The advantage of releasing the populations outlined above lies in the fact that most have \nspent less time incarcerated and are more likely to have maintained social bonds with their \ncommunities outside of prison. Their families and communities are better equipped to aid them in \nself-quarantine than are prisons, jails, and halfway houses. Individuals who fit the above criteria \nfor release should be screened to determine if they have somewhere to live in the community where \nthey can self-isolate if necessary. Individuals with such available housing should be prioritized for \nimmediate release. \n  3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 5 of 6\n  We note that the goal here is to thin the incarcerated population—by the most expeditious \nmeans possible, including releasing the healthy—to allow for social distancing. In some cases, \nsick individuals may have a more difficult time finding a safe place to live upon release, not least \nbecause of the lack of medical capacity in the state.  \n  We are very appreciative of the significant efforts you have already made to ensure people \nwho are released have safe accommodations in the community, and to ensure that no one is \nreleased to homelessness.  \n  4.  Transition  older  adults  and  medically  vulnerable  individuals  to  medical  and \ncommunity settings. Finally, we note that U.S. Attorney General William Barr, in response to \nrequests from Congress for a plan to mitigate the risk of widespread COVID-19 infection in federal \nprisons, has recommended that the federal Bureau of Prisons release certain at-risk individuals—\nincluding individuals with certain medical conditions and individuals over 60 years old. We agree \nthat this would be a worthy step to pursue in Connecticut, but we also emphasize that time is of \nthe essence here. We do not yet have a COVID-19 outbreak in our correctional facilities, but we \nmust act now to thin these populations out, social distance, and attempt to prevent one. That means \nreleasing whoever can be released most quickly and safely now. The next step would be to address \nthese  at-risk  populations.  Many  of  the  people  who  are  most  vulnerable  will  also  be  more \nchallenging to discharge: those without housing and those who, due to medical complexity, require \nmore  comprehensive  medical  discharge  planning.  The  state  must  nonetheless  work  toward \nreleasing older adults and other medically vulnerable inmates, who pose the least public safety risk \nand are most at-risk of COVID-19 complications. To that end, we, the Yale Transitions Clinic, \nhave created a hotline that DOC reentry coordinators and medical discharge planners can use to \nrefer people to us, and we will figure out the medical discharge follow-up. \nWe are eager to work with your office to facilitate any of these critical efforts for the public \nhealth of our state. We would also be glad to work with you in convening public health experts \nand physicians to further assess these issues, and the appropriate medical and public health \nprotocols for this population, as the pandemic evolves. \nThank you for your leadership on these issues thus far. \n \nSincerely, \n \n        \nEmily Wang, MD, MAS       \n  4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-1   Filed 04/27/20   Page 6 of 6\n   \nLisa Puglisi, MD \n \n \n \nAbbe R.

I am borderline diabetic. \n3.  I am being held at the York Correctional Institution in Niantic, Connecticut on a \nbond. \n4.  I have been here since March 6, 2020. \n5.  I was supposed to have a court date in my case on April 9th, but it was canceled \nand the court has not set a new date. \n6.  I am housed in 4 South, which is a medical unit, where I sleep in a room with one \nother person; my room contains a sink, a toilet, and a shower. \n7.  When we are in our beds, each person is less than six feet from the other. \n8.  My room is cleaned every two weeks.  I am not able to get any disinfectant to \nclean any more frequently. \n9.  The common areas are cleaned once a day.  I do not drink out of the water \nfountains because I do not think that they are clean.  I wipe the telephone down \nwith a rag before I use it because I do not think it has been cleaned. \n10.  The correctional officers do not regularly wear masks.  Some nurses wear masks \nand some don’t. \n11.  My unit has been locked down because of the COVID virus, and we only get \naround fifteen minutes outside of our rooms each day depending on which \ncorrectional officer is working that day. \n12.  I have to eat all of my meals in my room. \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-3   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 3\n13.  Although we are supposed to each have fifteen minutes to use the telephones, we \nhave been forced to split one fifteen minute shift between everyone who gets out \nto make a call that day. \n14.  There are people who have been taken into my unit for fourteen-day quarantine \nbecause they are suspected of having the virus.   \n15.  After my lawyer filed this lawsuit, medical staff began to take my temperature \nevery day.  Before that, they were not doing so.  \n16.

I have been incarcerated at Corrigan-Radgowski Correctional Institution \nsince March 22, 2019. I am 26 years old. I am housed in B pod of the Corrigan building. \nTo my knowledge, there are 82 or 83 people housed in my unit, on two tiers. \n2.  Our facility has been on lockdown for 16 days. We get 30 minutes out of \nour cells per day. During that time, I have to choose between showering or making phone \ncalls.  \n3.  One other person lives in my cell. Our sleeping area is not cleaned or \nsanitized by staff. I was given one small medicine cup of cleaner and a few paper towels, \nonce, to clean out my cell over the past 16 days. Correctional officers also passed out a \nsmall bar of soap per person about a week ago. \n4.  They are now cleaning the railings. But every time I come out of my cell, I \nsupposed to put my hands up against the wall, and they don’t clean the walls. And there’s \nno sink out here to wash your hands.  \n5.  I eat my meals in in my cell. Since we’ve been on lockdown, trash has \nbeen piling up outside our cell doors. Some staff will let people out to clean, but others \nuse cleaning as a bargaining tool.  \n6.  I do not have a shower in my cell. I share showers with the other 82 or 83 \npeople housed in my unit. I also share 9 phones with everyone in the unit. They just \nstarted having a laundry worker or tierman (unit worker) rub down the phones between \npeople. But when you use the phones, you’re right next to the next person.  \n7.  Within the last week, more staff have started to wear blue masks. It seems \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-4   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 4\n \nlike it is at their discretion—some people were wearing masks and some weren’t. I don’t \nknow if staff temperatures are being checked. Our temperatures have not been checked.  \n8.  One person in my block got sick and he was quarantined in his cell for 14 \ndays. His cellmate was also quarantined in there with him. They weren’t allowed out, \neven to take a shower. At the end of the 14 days, they took the temperature of the first \nperson and he went to medical. They didn’t test his cellmate or do anything like that. \nThey then moved them both to another cell, together, four cells down.   \n9.  Nobody in my block has been sent to Northern yet. Northern is a punitive, \nthreatening place. I’ve never been there. I know that people with symptoms will be afraid \nto say anything because god forbid you get transferred to Northern.  \n10.  I have asthma and stomach issues. Medical care here is really poor. In \nnormal days, you’ll submit a request and it will take between two weeks and a month to \nget it back. Then you will be seen within two or three weeks. I dropped in a request for \nmy friend recently that said it was urgent and he has yet to be seen.  \n11.  Since June of last year, I’ve been writing requests to medical to be seen \nfor severe stomach pain and certain foods that set me off. I was just put on an antibiotic \nyesterday.  \n12.  I want to give credit where credit is due. We are getting our two extra \nphone calls from Securus, and commissary gave out extra envelopes. But what’s \nhappening inside does not line up with what they are saying. I hear them talking about \ncleaning all shifts—that’s definitely not happening. I am now on a hunger strike with five \nother people in my unit. They are striking for better conditions and better medical care. I \nfeel like if people on the outside are advocating for us, we should do our part. DOC staff \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-4   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 4\n \nhave now threatened to take our commissary and our food for not taking our trays.  \n13.  It feels like we’re being punished because DOC had no adequate measures \nin place. We’ve been on lockdown for 16 days. It’s not good for anyone’s psychological \nwell-being. People are started to lose it. \n14.  I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I \nwould testify to the same statements above if called to do so in court. \n15.

I have been incarcerated at Brooklyn Correctional Institution for almost four \nyears. I am fifty years old. I am housed in D Dorm of Brooklyn CI. To my \nknowledge, there are 114 people housed in my dorm. \n2.  D Dorm has been in lockdown for about a month. The lockdown means that we \ndon’t leave D Dorm anymore to eat lunch with other dorms or to go to rec. We \nstill go outside once or twice per day. Other than that, we spend pretty much all of \nour time inside D Dorm.  \n3.  D Dorm is one big, open area. It has a single dayroom, which we can use from \n8:00am to 11:00pm every day. That means that all 114 of us are in the dayroom at \nonce. We play cards there and watch TV. Usually, we are about 1-2 feet away \nfrom each other. I have never been told by CDOC to “social distance” from other \npeople, or to keep 6-8 feet between me and every other person. Even if I was told \nto do that, it wouldn’t be possible because there is not enough space. I believe the \ntotal size of D Dorm is 120 feet by 65 feet. This includes sleeping areas and the \nday room, but not the showers. I believe these are the dimensions because the tiles \non the floor are each twelve-inch squares, and I counted the tiles.   \n4.  In D Dorm, we do not have cells. Instead, we sleep in “cubes.” “Cubes” are \nseparated from the day room by walls that are about eight feet high, and that leave \na gap of around six or seven feet between the top of the walls and the ceiling. \nEach cube sleeps six people on three bunk beds. When we sleep, we are probably \n2-3 feet apart from the people in the other bunks. There’s probably about an arm’s \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-5   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 4\nlength between the people who share a bunk bed. These measurements are my \nbest guesses. \n5.  CDOC gave each of the prisoners in D Dorm two masks. The masks are made of \na tan cloth that looks to me kind of like the “inmate prison tans,” and are lined \nwith cotton. CDOC told us that we can use the masks at our own discretion. I only \nwear mine when I go out of D Dorm for medical visits, or when I am talking on \nthe phone. I don’t wear my mask when I am inside D Dorm. Most other prisoners \ndon’t either. I would guess that maybe 5% of people wear their masks when they \nare inside D Dorm. \n6.  The prison gives me soap. Usually, prisoners have to buy soap, but for about the \nlast three weeks, the prison has been giving us bars of soap for free. They have \ntold us to wash our hands often. I probably wash my hands a dozen times a day. I \nsee other people in D Dorm washing their hands often as well.   \n7.  D Dorm is cleaned three times per day by prison workers. They are supposed to \nclean the table tops too, but they can’t because they don’t have supplies. I clean \non the third shift. I am still expected to do my job right now. If I refused to work, \nI would probably be written up for that. \n8.  Most of the guards wear masks all of the time, but some do not. Their masks are \nblue, but I think they are made from the same material as ours. A lot of staff wear \ngloves. I also see them using hand sanitizer from machine dispensers. Prisoners \nare not allowed to use the dispensers. Staff have also told us that they have their \ntemperatures taken every day before they come into the prison. But I cannot \nverify that. \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-5   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 4\n9.  I have been on medicine for Hepatitis C, so, luckily, I am allowed to go up to \nmedical every day. But for everyone else, it is taking longer than usual right now \nto get seen by medical. For example, we’ve been waiting for our flu shots for \nabout three months, and we still haven’t gotten them. The medical staff has told \nus that they haven’t had time to give us all flu shots because they have been busy \nwith other things. I do not know what the things are that they are busy with.  \n10. To my knowledge, I have not come into contact with anyone who has tested \npositive for coronavirus. I have not noticed anyone in my dorm with cough, fever, \ndiarrhea, nausea, and / or vomiting. But I have heard that so far there have been \nseven people in B Dorm who have symptoms.  \n11. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

I have been incarcerated at Corrigan for a little over a year. I am 44 years \nold. I am housed in Bravo Pod (“B Pod”) of Corrigan Correctional Institution. To my \nknowledge, there are 96 people housed in my unit. \n2.  Our facility has been on lockdown since approximately April 1. That’s \nwhen I started keeping track. For a few days when the lockdown first began, we got 15 \nminutes out of our cell for rec. Beginning Friday, April 3rd we got no time out of cell for \na few days after COs got into an altercation with an inmate. \n3.  Now we get at most 30 minutes of rec. Outside of our cells. \n4.  During rec, inmates can either take a shower or use the phone. There’s \nusually no time for both. People have to choose between getting in touch with their loved \nones and taking a shower. If you’re not using the phone or the shower, then you can’t \ncome out of the cell. \n5.  On my pod, people are housed two-to-a-cell. They’re allowing six people \nto take rec at once, releasing six people from three cells at a time. My cellmate and have \nbeen taking rec with the same group of four inmates every weekday since at least April 5.  \n6.  Since April 5, I’ve been coming into contact with about 13 people daily. \nThis includes my cellmate, the four other inmates we encounter during rec, and then \napproximately eight different COs. There are four COs per shift, and they take three \nshifts every 24 hours. \n7.  I share my cell with one other person. It’s six feet by nine feet. We sleep \napproximately three feet apart. We sleep in a regular bunk; I’ve got the top bunk and he’s \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-6   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 6\ngot the bottom. There are two chairs inside the cells so everything is really tight. The \nfurthest amount of distance that we can have between us while in the cell is nine feet. \nThat would require one person to sleep on the floor by the door. \n8.  COs pass our meals through the door. We eat all of our meals in our cell. \n9.  Inmate workers mop the dayroom, but it doesn’t seem to get very clean. \nThey’ll mop it once during the first shift and once during the second shift. They don’t \nusually mop during the third shift. The dayroom floors are only mopped sometimes. \nThere’s often still garbage left all over the tier. \n10.  We’ve been asking the COs for cleaning detergent and we haven’t gotten \nany. We’ve been asking for two weeks now, and they’ve only given us a bar of soap to \nwash our hands with. We have to use this bar of soap to clean our living quarters as well. \n11.  It’s a small bar of soap. I try to keep my cell clean by ripping pieces of \nfabric from my towel and using soap or shampoo to clean the floors. \n12.  The staff passed out soap on April 1st and on April 6th. They pass out a \nbar of soap about once a week. The last time I got soap was last week, the week of April \n13. \n13.  The staff passed out one mask April 1st and another mask about a week \nlater, on April 6th. The masks are made out of cloth. Today the COs exchanged our old \nmasks for new ones. I wash my mask every day using the bar of soap using the sink in \nmy cell. \n14.  Only some of the staff wear masks, and they only wear masks sometimes. \nThose that wear masks, wear masks made out of cloth. I don’t see staff members washing \ntheir hands regularly, and they don’t seem to carry hand sanitizer. They wear latex \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-6   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 6\ngloves. \n15.  The inmates on our unit share six showers. They don’t clean the showers \nafter each use, and I don’t know how often the showers are cleaned.  \n16.  There are three phones per pole, and inmates can only stand about two feet \naway from each other when using the phones. The phones are not regularly cleaned. \nSometimes inmates will wipe the phone down with a paper towel between uses, and I \nknow that sometimes COs will direct an inmate worker to wipe the phone down using a \nwatered down solution.  \n17.  The staff has not provided medical services. I have several medical \nconditions: asthma, fatty liver disease, mild liver fibrosis, and high cholesterol. Since \nbeing at Corrigan, I have not received one of my preventative asthma medications. I have \nbeen trying to see a doctor for two months, and have filed a grievance. I still have not \nbeen able to see a doctor, and I have not gotten my preventative asthma medication. \n18.  At the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, we received a staff memo \nthat basically instructs us not to contact medical services unless we’re showing symptoms \nof COVID-19. \n19.  I understand that I’m at higher risk because of my asthma and other \nchronic health conditions. I have repeatedly asked multiple staff members--the warden, \nunit manager, my counselor, and lieutenants--what kind of precautions they’re taking for \npeople like me, who have asthma and health conditions. No one has given me a response. \n20.  There are two people on my tier who I believe have had COVID-19. They \nshare a cell and they began to get sick around April 2 or April 3. Since they began to get \nsick, they were forbidden to leave their cell. They were forbidden to shower, to make \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-6   Filed 04/27/20   Page 5 of 6\nphone calls, or to even clear the trash out of their cell. The only treatment that I could see \nis that a staff member would come in once per shift to take their temperature. They were \nin this isolation for two weeks, and have recently been released back onto the tier. \n21.  I regularly spoke to these guys when they were isolated in their cell. The \ncell in which they were isolated was very close to the phones. You could easily speak to \nthem through an opening at the bottom of the door. I know that one of the guys actually \ntested positive for coronavirus, and so I assume that his cellmate also had it. \n22.  I spoke to the COs about their bad treatment of these sick guys. I argued \nthat those guys should get showers, and that what the COs were doing was wrong. No \none made any changes.  \n23.  I have not been tested for coronavirus, and as far as I know, no one else on \nthe tier has been. \n24.  I am very stressed because I don’t want to get sick. I have asthma so I’m \nat risk, and I don’t want to bring anything home to my moms and get her sick. When I \nask staff members what they’re doing to protect us, they tell me not to worry about it \nbecause I’m getting out in about 30 days. I don’t want to go home in a body bag. \n25.  I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I \nwould testify to the same statements above if called to do so in court. \n26.  I have authorized Faith Barksdale to affix my signature to this affidavit for \nme, because I am incarcerated, and it would take a minimum of seven days for me to \nreceive a document in the mail, sign it in front of a notary, and return it by mail. \n \n  Executed this 22 day of April, 2020. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-6   Filed 04/27/20   Page 6 of 6\n \n                s/Angel Caballero____________ \n                by Faith Barksdale______________ \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-7   Filed 04/27/20   Page 1 of 4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT G \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-7   Filed 04/27/20   Page 2 of 4\n \nDeclaration of Marcus Champagne \n \n1.  I, Marcus Champagne, declare as follows: \n2.  I have been incarcerated at Hartford Correctional Center (HCC) since February 20th, \n2020. I am 24 years old. I am housed in Dorm 4 of HCC. To my knowledge, there are \n120 people housed in my unit, 60 on each side. \n3.  I have severe asthma, and multiple immune disorders (psoriasis, eczema, and \nalopecia). \n4.  Our facility has been on lockdown every day for about a month. During this period of \nlockdown, I can only leave the dorm to shower and use the phone. \n5.  I sleep approximately 4 feet above and approximately 4 feet away from the people in \nthe next beds over. Our sleeping area is not cleaned or sanitized by staff. Two inmates \nhave left to go to medical with fevers and the staff did not wipe down their areas. We \ndo not get provided cleaning supplies other than two bars of soap in the past month. \nMost recently, we received a bar of soap on April 13th, 2020. \n6.  I eat my meals in my dorm, and the CO who passes them out doesn’t wear gloves or a \nmask. \n7.  I share 4 showers with approximately 60 other people. The showers are not sanitized, \nthey are only cleaned with hot water. \n8.  Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, I have observed staff re-using gloves \nand gloves and failing to wear masks. CO’s have told me that they are scared, \nbecause they are not provided with masks and have to bring their own. They haven’t \nbeen able to find enough at stores. \n9.  Staff have provided me with one mask made out of cloth. The vast majority of \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-7   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 4\n \ninmates have been wearing the same cloth mask for the past 2 weeks without washing \nit. \n10. I have come into contact with someone in my facility who has tested positive for the \ncoronavirus. The prison staff did not go through proper precautions to clean \nafterward. They sprayed his bunk one time with water, but no bleach. In addition, \npeople have been sick and asking to go to medical and have been denied. I’ve seen 3 \nor 4 people sick with coronavirus symptoms, and only 2 have gone to medical. One of \nthose people had been asking repeatedly for the entire day. Both of the people who \nhave been to medical didn’t come back to the dorm.  \n11. Right now, I am sleeping two bunks away from someone who tested positive for \nCOVID-19 and was sent to Northern, then moved back to Hartford CC after two \ndays. He was quarantined at Hartford for 16 days, he told me. I feel nervous about \nsleeping so close to someone who tested positive. \n12. I feel like I’m a lab rat trapped in a small place waiting to get sick. \n13. The Commissioner has been saying that the CO’s are getting the proper amount of \ngloves and disinfectants, but from what I see, they’re not getting anything at all. \n14. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I would \ntestify to the same statements above if called to do so in court. \n15. I have authorized Madeline Batt to affix my signature to this affidavit for me, because \nI am incarcerated, and it would take a minimum of seven days for me to receive a \ndocument in the mail, sign it in front of a notary, and return it by mail. \n \nExecuted this 23rd day of April, 2020. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-7   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 4\n \n \nMarcus Champagne________ \nby    ______________ \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-8   Filed 04/27/20   Page 1 of 5\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT H \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-8   Filed 04/27/20   Page 2 of 5\n \nDeclaration of Alex Flemming \n \n1.  I, Alex Flemming, declare as follows: \n2.  I have been incarcerated at Northern Correctional Institution since February 14, 2020. I \nam 24 years old. I am housed in the 1-West unit of Northern. To my knowledge, there are \n6 people housed on my tier.  \n3.  Approximately 40-50 people were transferred into my unit as a whole around early April. \nI was given a new cell-mate who was transferred in, but he was transferred to a different \ncell after one day. I was told he would be placed back in my cell again if he was found to \nbe on special parole. Since then he has been transferred back to my cell. \n4.  I have a heart condition called Supraventricular tachycardia as well as a right branch \nbundle blockage, and I have to take heart medication twice daily. \n5.  I get recreation one hour per day Monday through Friday. Sometimes they cheat you and \nonly give you 40 minutes. I get rec in an individual cage. There are three individual cages \nseparated by fences with holes in them, and when they first started taking coronavirus \nseriously, they left the middle cage empty. Since they have started getting more transfers, \nthey have been filling up all the cages again. I would be close enough to touch the person \nin the next cage over if there wasn’t a fence. I do not go to rec with the same people \nevery day, sometimes it’s people from other tiers. \n6.  The conditions here at Northern are brutal. I saw an inmate being assaulted by two \ncorrectional officers. The inmate was escorted by one officer and when he reached the \nblind spot, where the camera couldn’t see them, the other officer joined in and they beat \nhim. He couldn’t defend himself because he had his hands cuffed behind him. I had to \nwalk to end to the shower because I didn’t want to view the image anymore. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-8   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 5\n \n7.  I do not have a cellmate. My cell is not cleaned nor sanitized by staff. We are each \nprovided a dustpan, broom, lemonall, and some paper towels. They give you one small \nstyrofoam cup of lemonall two times a week, which is double from before the \ncoronavirus, but it’s still not enough to clean every time a correctional officer enters my \ncell. \n8.  I eat my meals in my cell. \n9.  The water is not drinkable here. I don’t drink it because it bothers my stomach a lot. \nOther inmates have told me it’s been like this for a long time. I only drink the milk and \norange juice provided to me. \n10. The staff do not provide us with soap. I asked for soap and was denied, I was told that I \nhave to be indigent to be provided with soap. When I’ve needed soap in the past two \nweeks, I’ve gotten it from the commissary for a fee. I do not have access to hand \nsanitizer. \n11. I do not have a shower in my cell. I share a shower with approximately 20 other people, \nincluding people on my tier, people from neighboring tiers, and the inmates who are \nallowed to clean the building. I also share 4 phones with half of the facility. \n12. Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, I have observed staff wearing masks. They \nhave said they check temperatures of staff members before they come in but I have no \nway to confirm this. \n13. Staff have not provided me with guidance about how to protect myself and others from \ncoronavirus transmission. They just gave notice that we would have to use the phones \nfaster and have two people at a time in the rec cages instead of three – though that lasted \nonly a week before they started filling the middle cage again. They have provided me \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-8   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 5\n \nwith one mask made out cloth of in approximately the beginning of April. \n14. We have been requesting that they clean the ventilation systems because we all share the \nsame air. Prisoners from Corrigan came to clean Northern around March 22 , 2020, but \nnd\nthey did not clean the ventilation. We have not gotten any response about cleaning the \nventilation. \n15. When I seek treatment for a medical condition, it usually takes me a week to two weeks \nto see a doctor. Sometimes if it’s really urgent you can request to be pulled out of your \ncell right away, but they get to decide how urgent it is. I requested treatment for two \nconfirmed cavities, and was supposed to get treatment in February, but it still hasn’t \nhappened. \n16. There have been a few times that they haven’t had my heart medications, but they marked \nit as me refusing my medication in their records. This has happened before and after the \npandemic. I had a doctor I really liked who prescribed the heart medication for me to \nhave in my cell with me, because it’s important for my health. But he has been gone since \nmid-March, and I no longer have my medication in my cell with me. \n17. They are no longer running mental health groups at Northern. There is really no mental \nhealth counseling happening anymore unless someone writes to a mental health counselor \nasking to be pulled out of their cell because they are imminently suicidal. There is also a \nbuzzer to press but no one really answers those. \n18. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I would testify to \nthe same statements above if called to do so in court. \n19. I have authorized Madeline Batt to affix my signature to this affidavit for me, because I \nam incarcerated, and it would take a minimum of seven days for me to receive a \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-8   Filed 04/27/20   Page 5 of 5\n \ndocument in the mail, sign it in front of a notary, and return it by mail. \n \n  Executed this 21  day of April, 2020. \nst\n \n                Alex Flemming________________ \n                by        ______________ \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-9   Filed 04/27/20   Page 1 of 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT I \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-9   Filed 04/27/20   Page 2 of 3\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-9   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 3\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-10   Filed 04/27/20   Page 1 of 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT J \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-10   Filed 04/27/20   Page 2 of 3\n \nDeclaration of Chaz Gulley \n \n1. I, Chaz Gulley, declare as follows: \n2. I have been incarcerated at Corrigan-Radgowski Correctional Center since May 2019. I \nam 35 years old. I am housed in the restrictive housing unit, which houses inmates from \nboth the Corrigan and Radgowski buildings of my facility. To my knowledge, there are \n48 people housed in my unit. \n3. My facility has been on lockdown every day since approximately March 31st, after people \n​\n​\nwithin the facility started testing positive for COVID-19. During this period of lockdown, \nI usually get 15-minute showers on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. I’ve been told I \ncan choose between half an hour of rec and half an hour phone call each day, and I’ve \nalways chosen the phone call, but sometimes they don’t allow phone calls at all.  That is \nthe only time I am allowed out of my cell. I eat meals in my cell. \n4.  I don’t have a cell-mate. My sleeping area is not cleaned nor sanitized by staff. I am not \nprovided cleaning supplies to clean my own cell. I can request someone to come clean \nmy cell, but that won’t happen during lockdowns.  \n5. The staff provide us with soap when we request it. I do not have access to hand sanitizer.  \n6. Our unit shares approximately 2 showers for 48 people. I also share 1 phone with the \nentire unit. Handcuffs are not sanitized between uses, and anyone who comes out of cell \nin my unit has to wear handcuffs.  \n7. Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, I have observed staff wearing masks and \ngloves, but not consistently. It depends on the day how many staff are actually wearing \nprotective equipment. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-10   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 3\n \n8.

I have been incarcerated at Cybulski since June 1, 2018. I am 43 years old. \nI am housed in E block, which houses the Second Chance Program. I have completed all \nthe programming they have asked me to and more. To my knowledge, there are close to \n100 housed in this block.  \n2.  I am a kitchen worker at Northern. I have done this job for 19 months. I \nusually wake up at 3:30 a.m. and go in to Northern from 4 a.m. until 11 a.m., seven days \na week. Last June, I switched to second shift, which is 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., also seven days \nper week.  \n3.  After Sunday, March 29, we stopped going to work at Northern. When we \nwere leaving to go to Northern that day on second shifft, a kitchen worker was coming \nback from first shift and sweating bullets. They took his temperature, which was 103.7. \nThey still sent us to work at Northern that day, but that was our last day of work.   \n4.  The first people to get sick in E block were taken out on March 30. There \nwas one guy taken out with a fever of 104. He was really sick. They started moving them \nfrom E block to another block, H block, which is usually the intake block at Cybulski. \nEven though they were sick, they made them clean out the block. They then put them in \nseg, two to a cell. They were in there for days, unable to take a shower. Then they moved \nthem to Northern.  \n5.  People continue to be taken out of my block because they are sick. There \nwere a couple people taken out of E block in the last week. The two people that they took \nout last Friday, April 10, were pretty bad. They had fevers and looked like death. I know \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-11   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 4\n \nsome people have been hospitalized at UCONN.  \n6.  They were doing temperature checks for a week, checking temperatures \nonce per day, but then they stopped. The last time they did it was April 11.   \n7.  I asked a medical worker if I could be tested for COVID-19. She said I \ncould, but that if I wanted to get tested, I would have to pack up my stuff and go wait in \nH block with everyone else who had been tested to wait for the test results. So I would be \nput in with a bunch of other people who are definitely sick with fever, while I waited for \nmy result. I decided not to.  \n8.  A guy yesterday had chest pains and got a rapid test. He works for the \nlaundry department here. He said he wasn’t scared of Northern. In 10 minutes they told \nhim he had the antibodies but you’re not positive any more. He’s back in the block now.  \n9.  There have been 10 or 11 guys so far who have come back from Northern. \nThey haven’t been retested for COVID-19, to my knowledge. They just bring them back \nwhen their symptoms are gone and don’t have fevers. Some people still haven’t come \nback.  \n10.  I have asthma and diabetes. I have two asthma inhalers. I had pneumonia \ntwice in 2017. I have never been higher than a Level 2 inmate here.  \n11.  There’s no social distancing here. If I use the microwave or toilet, \nsomeone goes and uses it right after me. They are serving food to us right in the block. \nWe eat on our bunks or on tables. The block is one big room with cubes for sleeping \naround the outside. There are 15 cubes, with eight guys to a cube. Each cube has four \nbunk beds, about four feet apart. We share one bathroom with three urinals and four \nstalls. We share six or seven showers. The tiermen clean twice a day. If I use the phone, I \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-11   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 4\n \nclean it with stuff that looks like windex.  \n12.  COs started wearing masks after a couple of them caught the virus. I wear \nmy mask most of the time, but I wonder what the point is because you can’t social \ndistance in here. The mask is a tan material, the same as our pants.  \n13.  I understand we all broke the law. The in people here are trying. They \ngave us some bleach for a time, then lemonall products and glass cleaner for the phones. \nBut what is the point of keeping us in here like this when we’re all on top of each other. \nPut us on an ankle monitor and let us out. I have a house to go to. I have a home where \nmy fiancee has never been in trouble, in Connecticut, and a job waiting for me.  \n14.

I am incarcerated in the E dorm of Cybulski. I will be 55 on April 29 of \nthis year.  \n2.  In prison, I work as a detail worker at Northern, meaning I am transported \nfrom Cybulski to Northern in order to clean that prison.  \n3.  When I was cleaning in March, I was not protected at all. I had a pair of \nrubber gloves, but no mask or hazmat suit or anything.  \n4.  March 28 was my last day of work at Northern. One of the kitchen \nworkers in Northern had tested positive for COVID-19, so they stopped taking us to \nwork. \n5.  They checked my vital signs back at Cybulski on March 30. I had a high \nfever. The nurse looked at me strangely and left. I stayed in the unit for a few hours. A \ncouple hours later I was called out with two other individuals. We took COVID tests and \nthen sat there for hours waiting.  \n6.  After a few hours, we were moved to H dorm at Cybulski. We had to \nmove our stuff out ourselves. Then they sent us down to H dorm with bleach and forced \nus to clean it out ourselves, even though we were all sick. This made no sense. They \nknew this virus was coming and they knew this would happen way ahead of time. They \ncould have done this weeks ago. Instead, they waited until it actually occurred and then \nsent sick people down to clean up the dorm.  \n7.  The three of us from E dorm were in H dorm for a week. Once we tested \npositive, they put us in seg. It’s a small cell behind the captains’ and lieutenants’ \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-12   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 6\n \nbuilding. The ventilation system there is really bad. I was put in seg with another guy \nfrom E dorm. The cell had mold all over the ceiling. I started to complain—I have \nrespiratory issues and it was terrible. There was a toilet in the cell, but I was in there with \nanother guy and there was no privacy. We weren’t allowed to leave to use the phone to \ncall, not even to call and our emergency contact that we were sick. The COs were trying \nto avoid the area. The nurses were calling us “little Covies” even before we got our test \nresults. There were guys who had gotten sick before us in E dorm, and they were stuck in \na seg cell for 10 days. \n8.  I started to get upset. I made two requests to mental health before they \nfinally came. A person from mental health came with the nurse and two lieutenants. As I \nwas expressing my concern, she said “People are dying. People are dying.” I said, “well, \nyou’re trying to kill me.” The lieutenant told me you requested to speak to mental health \nbecause of this? I said of course, look at the conditions. It was like a joke to her. I just felt \nlike an animal, the way they did this. And even though it was a quarantine area, staff kept \ncoming through to see who was in the cell and breaking the quarantine.   \n9.  The nurse told me I would be leaving soon. I was transferred to Northern \nthe night of April 7, around 10:30 p.m. I was transported in a regular van, with a bunch of \nother people.  \n10.  When I got to Northern, they took our vital signs—temperature and blood \npressure. Then they put us each in a cell for five days, in 2West. I was put in cell 202. We \nweren’t allowed to leave our cells at all, except for one phone call.  \n11.  There were guys close to me from Cybulski. There were guys downstairs \nfrom Corrigan and Radgowski. There were some from HCC and Cheshire, all around the \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-12   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 6\n \nstate. There were people in all the cells. I think 2W and 3W were both full.  \n12.  I heard coughing. Some guys were taken out on stretchers and \nwheelchairs. It was a really sad situation. Staff were wearing hazmat suits. \n13.  There were two nurses on each shift who took vitals. There was a CO who \nwent around every 30 minutes. That was it. There was no specialized medical care or \nanything that I saw. I had my property with me. They didn’t give us any cleaning \nsupplies—just whatever you already had. I didn’t take a shower for two weeks. When I \nasked why I couldn’t take a shower, they said if we took a shower we would get the virus \nin the air.   \n14.  People starting kicking their doors trying to get a phone call. After three \ndays, they finally let us have one call. I called my mom. That was the only time I got out \nof my cell when I was at Northern. \n15.  I was in Northern for a total of five days. After five days, we were told \nthat we would be going back to H dorm at Cybulski. We were also told that before we got \nback, they would test everyone in E dorm for COVID-19 with new tests. We were \nsupposed to leave Monday, but they took us out early, on Sunday, after taking our \ntemperature. \n16.  Instead, when we got back to Cybulski, they put us back in E dorm. They \ntold the other people in E dorm we were “cleared,” but we didn’t have another COVID-\n19 test, or test negative, or anything like that. Everyone was worried about us being back \nhere. Right now, there are 112 guys in the block and they are not practicing social \ndistancing. You can’t.  \n17.  When we got out of quarantine at Northern, there were people already \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-12   Filed 04/27/20   Page 5 of 6\n \ncoming in to take our spots.  \n18.  When I got back to E dorm, guys were taking Tylenol and aspirin to try to \nhide fevers so they wouldn’t get moved out to Northern. Nobody wants to go there. \nMeanwhile, a lot of guys I know are telling me they probably have the virus because their \nbodies are aching, they lost their smell and taste, but they don’t want to get tested. Still \ntoday, in here, you got guys doing a lot of coughing. There’s one guy who is overweight, \nhe doesn’t look good at all.  \n19.  Recently, staff actually stopped bringing in aspirin so people can’t take it \nany more. But they also stopped taking our temperatures. So everyone is still in here, no \nvital signs, nothing. There’s still no special cleaning. They stopped giving us bleach—\njust some stuff that looks like bleach. Whoever feels like cleaning, cleans.  \n20.  The officers have a desk here that’s right near the counselor’s office. They \nput up tape so that we stay six feet away from it, even though they’re sitting up high on \nan elevated platform. But that just takes six feet of space away from us, so we’re all \ncloser together.  \n21.  I’m trying to stay on my bunk and stay away from other people, but it’s \nhard. I wear my mask all the time. It’s giving me a sore on my nose. While I was sick, I \nhad a cough for two days and the fever. I am feeling better, trying to get my lungs back, a \nlittle weak. I heard someone died. This is scary situation for me. I’m at the end of my bid. \nTo experience this now, it’s scary. I don’t know what’s going to happen next. \n22.  As we speak, a guy is moving out of my dorm. He requested to be tested \nand they just moved him to H block. He just packed up his stuff and walked down the \nhall. There was another guy last night who requested to be tested and they said it came up \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-12   Filed 04/27/20   Page 6 of 6\n \npositive for antibodies, but they put him back in the unit. This guy is still walking around \nthe cube, with no mask.  \n23.  It’s clear to me that DOC did not have a plan for this. They didn’t know \nhow to deal with this. It is just crazy.  \n24.  I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I \nwould testify to the same statements above if called to do so in court. \n25.

I am an adult.\n2. I have been incarcerated at Garner Correctional Institution since January\n2, 2020. I am 25 years old. I am housed in Fox Unit. To my knowledge, there are \ncurrently approximately 25 people housed in my unit, but the number of people fluctuates \ndaily.  \n3. I get at most one hour out of cell per day. When people in my unit leave\ntheir cells, they are escorted by an officer. The officers hold people’s arms while \nescorting them. The officers wear gloves, but many do not change their gloves between \neach person they escort. The officers also use handcuffs while escorting some people. \nThey do not sanitize the handcuffs each time they place them on someone new. Wearing \na mask is optional, and most officers do not wear them. Sometimes officers place \nmultiple people in recreation “cages” at the same time so that they are within six of feet \nof one another.  \n4. I do not share my cell with anyone else. My sleeping area is not cleaned\nnor sanitized by staff. I am only provided supplies to clean my own cell once per week. I \nam provided with diluted cleaning supplies to clean. I do not have access to hand \nsanitizer.  \n5. I am only allowed to shower three times per week. I do not have a shower\nin my cell. I share approximately five showers with everyone in the unit. \n6. I also share two phones with my entire unit. I am allowed to make three\n15-minute phone calls per week. The phones are not always cleaned in between calls.\n7. There is one person who is responsible for cleaning the entire unit,\nincluding the common area, outside recreation area, counselors’ units, phone booths, \n1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-13   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 3\nshowers, and individual cells after people are transferred. He cannot clean the unit \nsufficiently each day. \n8. Staff have provided guidance about how to protect myself and others from\ncoronavirus transmission by placing posters in the unit. They have also provided me with \ntwo masks made out of the same material used for our uniforms. \n9. Some staff members have tested positive for COVID-19. I have no way of\nknowing if I have come into contact with them. \n10. I have been diagnosed with asthma. I have been hospitalized two times due\nto asthma while in the custody of the Department of Corrections. Both times, I was taken \nin an ambulance to an outside hospital.  \n11.

I, Austin Kerr, declare as follows: \n2.  I have been incarcerated at Corrigan Correctional Center since approximately September \n2019. I am 22 years old. I am housed in B pod at Corrigan. To my knowledge, there are \napproximately 100 people housed in my unit. \n3.  Around two or three weeks ago, I started experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. I felt a \nheadache and a sore throat. \n4.  I told correctional staff about my symptoms the same night I felt them, because I didn’t \nwant to get anyone sick on my recreation. \n5.  Correctional staff seemed appalled. They quickly distanced themselves from me, and \nthey said my cell-mate and I couldn’t go for recreation. I called the CO using my buzzer, \nand told them they couldn’t take away our rec, so they sent me to medical. \n6.  At medical, they took my temperature and as far as I know I didn’t have a fever. They \nsent me back to my cell. I remained in my cell that night and my cell-mate and I were \npermitted to shower but not to go to rec. \n7.  The next morning, my cell-mate (who was not symptomatic) and I were quarantined \ntogether in a cell in our unit. Approximately 9 days after I was quarantined, I was told I \ntested positive for COVID-19 by Correctional Officers. Medical staff did not \ncommunicate with me about my test. When I asked them, they said they would let me \nknow the results after a few days, but they never did. \n8.  In total, I was in isolation for 15 days. I was not allowed out of my cell at all during that \ntime. \n9.  I was not permitted to shower or go to recreation. I did not have access to the phone, even \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-14   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 4\n \nfor legal calls. No one was coming to collect garbage until I complained repeatedly about \nthe trash piling up. After that they collected the garbage once, and I believe that was the \nonly time it was collected while I was isolated. \n10. I repeatedly expressed discontent with my conditions to staff, including lieutenants, but \nno one did anything. I covered my cell window and flooded my cell to try and get \nconditions to change, but nothing changed even after staff came to deal with those \nsituations. \n11. I was not provided with any healthcare to alleviate my symptoms while I was isolated. \nMedical staff came to take my vitals twice a day, and one time they came because I said I \nwas having trouble breathing. They checked my breathing and said I was good. \n12. The staff who I interacted with were wearing gloves, masks, and gowns.  \n13. This form of isolation negatively affected my mental health. I had trouble sleeping and \nfelt depressed. I felt like I was losing it, because I was in seg without having done \nanything wrong. The worst part was that I couldn’t call my family. I could have died in \nthere without anyone knowing. \n14. I was let out of isolation after 15 days. I don’t know why I was let out on that day. I did \nnot receive any additional COVID-19 test before being let out of isolation. \n15. Before I went into isolation, people in my unit at Corrigan were still getting normal rec in \ngroups of about 20 people. Now people go out to rec for 30 minutes in groups of 2 or 3.  \n16. Before and after isolation, I have shared 6 showers with approximately 100 other people \nin the unit. I also share 9 phones with my entire unit.  \n17. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I would testify to \nthe same statements above if called to do so in court. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-14   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 4\n \n18.

To my knowledge, there are around 66 \npeople housed in N pod. \n3. We are not on lockdown, but our movement is restricted. We get three hours and\n30 minutes total out of cell per day. We use our time out of cell to shower and use the phone. We \ncan also play cards, chess, and dominoes. We are allowed to go outside and play basketball. \nThere is no social distancing when we are out of our cells.  \n4. I am in a cell by myself. My sleeping area is not cleaned or sanitized by staff. I\nam provided with diluted cleaning supplies to clean my own space. \n5. We eat meals in the dayroom of the unit. During mealtimes, we are spaced about\na foot apart. \n6. The staff do not provide us with soap. When I have needed soap in the past two\nweeks, I have gotten it from commissary for a fee. I sometimes cannot buy other items I need \nfrom commissary so that I can afford soap. I do not have access to hand sanitizer.  \n7. I do not have a shower in my cell. I share eight showers with approximately 12\nother people. On the tier below me, roughly 40 people share eight showers. The showers are \ntypically cleaned three times per day. The showers are cleaned with diluted cleaner. The showers \nare not sufficiently clean.   \n8. I also share eight phones with my entire unit. The phones sometimes get used\nabout 50 times in between cleanings. I put a sock over the phone before I use it to protect against \ngerms.  \n1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-15   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 3\n(cid:29)(cid:7)

\nDeclaration of Robert Miller \n \nI, Robert Miller, declare as follows: \n1.  I was incarcerated at Carl Robinson Correctional Institution from \nDecember 2018 until April 3, 2020. I am 34 years old. At Carl Robinson, I was housed in \n3B (building 3, on the B side). To my knowledge, there are 180 people in each building: \n90 on A side and 90 on B side. It’s a dormitory setting: We share showers, toilets, \nphones, tables, everything.  \n2.  Before I left Carl Robinson, we were struggling to get the proper cleaning \nproducts. In March, the warden had come to talk to us and said we would get extra soap \nand bleach to use for cleaning because of the virus. But three weeks later, we still hadn’t \ngotten anything. We were cleaning the dorm with our own toilet paper—we each get only \none roll per week—and our own soap. We had to decide between using soap to clean our \nbodies or to clean our areas. So on March 24, we wrote a letter to our counselor \nsupervisor saying that we were not able to clean our environment properly. We were \nasking to clean and being told they didn’t have paper towels, or being denied spray \nbottles. The detail workers were able to clean the phones, bathrooms, and the vents on \ntheir designated shifts, but they weren’t cleaning the floors, bunks, lockers and walls. \nWhy did DOC not give us ways to clean anything? It was clearly hazardous. \n3.  There were other issues too. Medical would hand us pills without gloves \non. When we complained, they told us they didn’t have to wear gloves or masks. I wrote \na request about it. They also started giving us “off” portions of food, and old food, about \na month ago—we would get a lunch portion of food for dinner: two slices of bread, two \nslices of baloney, one slice of cheese, a little coleslaw, a small bag of chips, and milk. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-16   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 6\n \nWhen they did clean the phones and the bathrooms, they would kick out the whole \nbuilding and put us all in the gym together, or put half of us in there at a time. Despite the \nvirus, COs continued to shake down peoples’ areas, usually three bunks a day, but \nsometimes up to a whole section. Even if they were coughing or sick, they would go \nthrough all our stuff thoroughly, touching everything. One of the COs in our block \nalready had tested positive for COVID at that point. And they weren’t wearing masks \nuntil recently. The warden is did address certain issues but the COs did not do what she \nsaid.   \n4.  On Wednesday, April 1, we got word that A side was not going to eat \nlunch in protest of the conditions. Everybody on B side decided that if A side wasn’t \neating, we wouldn’t either. I later heard that it went from building to building. We all \nshared whatever food we had; I gave a guy the last soup I had in my locker. Then when \ntime came to get our trays—we had to go outside to get them, no matter what the weather \nwas—and the correctional officer asked whether we were going down to get them, \neveryone says no. We didn’t scream, yell, or throw things. We just said no, we weren’t \ngoing to eat that one meal.  \n5.  At the time, all the staff was on A side. Then the warden, deputy warden,  \nlieutenants and other officers started to leave the building. Then when they heard we \nweren’t eating, they came to see us. We all sat on our bunks and had a conversation: We \ntold them everything that was going on, and how we hadn’t gotten bleach or any cleaning \nproducts that we were supposed to get. We also explained the issues with the food, which \nwas rancid, old, and often moldy. One of the captains said he didn’t believe us. The \nconversation ended and the officers left. The next day, nothing happened. We just called \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-16   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 6\n \nour families and told them about it.  \n6.  That Friday, a correctional officer came and told me I needed to go down \nto the processing area (A&D) and get a new ID. Instead, when I got there, a bunch of \ncorrectional officers rushed me and threw me against the wall. They put me in shackles \nand twisted my arms up. Then they put me in a van and took me to Northern. They told \nme I was under investigation. They didn’t say what for.  \n7.  When I got to Northern, they strip searched me and threw me back in \nshackles and put me in a cell. I didn’t have my morning medication. I had to beg them to \ngive me my albuterol inhaler, because I have asthma. My body was also starting to go \nnumb. I was lying on the floor, wheezing, and calling for help. I pressed the intercom in \nthe cell for help but was told multiple times to stop pressing the button. The COs just kept \nignoring me when they walked by. My lungs were getting tight and painful. I yelled to \nthe person two cells down to get help. When I was able to speak to a CO, I asked them to \ncall a “code white,” which is a medical emergency. They refused.  \n8.  I also take a medication named neurotin in the mornings. If I don’t take it, \nmy left side will go numb and I’m unable to walk or to use my hand. I didn’t get the pill \nthat morning. After hours went by, a CO on second shift finally brought me to medical, \nand he had to help me get up and walk. They helped with my asthma, but I didn’t get the \nneurotin until later that night.   \n9.  I was put in Northern just to silence me. I can’t afford to take a ticket for \nsomething I did not do. If we don’t feel like going to chow, we don’t have to. A hunger \nstrike is technically missing six meals; we just turned down food once.  \n10.  Here at Northern, I am in 1West in a cell the size of a closet by myself. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-16   Filed 04/27/20   Page 5 of 6\n \nOther people are here, including some from Robinson. I still haven’t had a hearing for my \nticket. I’m past my amount of seg days. I’m only allowed to go shower three times a \nweek for 15 minutes each. I’m not allowed to order commissary or have my TV or \nhotpot.  \n11.   Outside my window, by the entry to 2West, I’ve seen tons of people \ngetting transported in here in shackles, with workers wearing Hazmat suits. Some of the \npeople getting transported were doing badly and looked like they were hurting. The first \nnight I was here, people were coming in all night long. Earlier that day I saw them bring \nin maybe 50 mattresses to the same building. They now have a tent set up there. I’ve \nheard ambulances coming by. One of the tiermen said that they had to open another block \nbecause they had too many people with COVID-19 here, and that it was already over \n100.  \n12.  They have continued to bring people in. They are doing it at night with the \nlights off. Some of the COs have been wearing hazmat suits and some are not. Some are \nwearing normal clothes and others are not. When I look outside my window, I can see \ndebris all over – gloves, hair nets, shoe covers, a broken pallet, and hangers.  \n13.  The ventilation in here is crazy. The air is either hot and muggy or \nfreezing. When it’s cold here, it’s really cold. In order to sleep, I need to sleep with \nsweatpants, a sweatshirt, thermals, and a T-shirt, under the blanket, and it’s still too cold \nto sleep. And if it’s not freezing, it’s too hot and muggy.     \n14.  The COs here are giving us a Styrofoam cup of Lemonall and paper \ntowels to clean. There are showers on the tier but you have to go half-naked. You can’t \nclean the showers before you get in, and you’re transported there and back in handcuffs \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-16   Filed 04/27/20   Page 6 of 6\n \nthat aren’t cleaned.  \n15.  You can only make three phone calls per week. I was taken here on April \n3 and now I’m still here. Nobody is telling me anything. They aren’t testing anyone in \nthis part of Northern for COVID-19. I put in a sick call on April 9, and I was just seen on \nthe 19. I told them I needed a refill of my inhaler because my asthma feels like it’s \ngetting worse and I feel like I’ve had a cold for weeks.  All he did was check my vitals.  \n16.  I understand this is prison, but even still there’s a way it should be run and \na way it should not be. At Robinson, they were letting us stay up late at night and keeping \nthe TVs on and phone and extra channels, all to keep us calm. But they weren’t letting us \ndo what we needed to do to protect ourselves from this virus. They turned a blind eye to \nus.   \n17.  I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I \nwould testify to the same statements above if called to do so in court. \n18.

I, Luis Pagan, declare as follows: \n2. I have been incarcerated at Northern Correctional Institution since June 2017. I am 34 \nyears old. I have asthma and an autoimmune disorder. I am currently housed in 1 East \nunit at Northern. To my knowledge, there are about 40 people housed in my unit. \n3.  I get 1 hour out of cell per day for recreation and 15 minutes to shower. Rec is in outdoor \n​\ncages with 8 people at a time. Prior to the pandemic it was 6 people at a time. Since the \npandemic started, they’ve added 2 people who were transferred in from Walker to my \nrec, and now it is 8 people at a time. Rec takes place in 3 cages, one of which is \napproximately 5 feet by 9 feet, and 2 of which are smaller. 4 people are in the larger cage \nand 2 in each smaller cage at the same time.  \n4. I don’t have a cell-mate, but 2-3 officers enter my cell per day to take me to rec, the \nphone, or the showers. It is not the same 2-3 officers each day. \n5. My sleeping area is not cleaned nor sanitized by staff. We are provided cleaning supplies \nto clean our own spaces on Saturdays, though it is not enough supplies to last throughout \nthe week because the officers keep coming in and out of my cell. \n6. I eat my meals in my cell. The guards who bring my food are wearing gloves, but they do \nnot change their gloves between holding our food and touching unsanitized handcuffs. \n7. The staff have provided us with one bar of soap since the pandemic started. Other than \nthat, when I’ve needed soap in the past two weeks, I’ve gotten it from the commissary for \na fee. I do not have access to hand sanitizer.  \n8. I do not have a shower in my cell. I share a shower with approximately 40 other people in \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-17   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 4\n \nthe tier. There’s a single slot in the shower that everyone’s towels sit on, and towels are \nnot laundered between showers. I also share 4 phones with my entire unit. Handcuffs and \nshackles are used repeatedly throughout the day, and are not sanitized between uses. \n9. Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, I have observed staff wearing masks and \ngloves, but not gowns. My temperature has been taken a few times in response to an \nunrelated infection, but staff are not consistently taking inmates’ temperatures despite the \nfact that I was informed by a correctional officer that a kitchen worker at Northern has \ntested positive for COVID-19. \n10.Staff have provided me with guidance about how to protect myself and others from \ncoronavirus transmission. They have provided me with two pieces of paper encouraging \nus to wash our hands and clean our cells. However, it is difficult to follow the advice \nabout sanitizing because we don’t always have Lemonall, the provided cleaning material, \nand correctional officers are constantly coming in and out of our cells. They have \nprovided me with one mask made out of cloth on approximately April 1st.  \n​\n​\n11.I have come into contact with approximately 6 correctional officers in the past week who \nhave been coughing and sneezing. They have continued to work as normal and told me \n“it’s just allergies.” \n12. People at my facility have tried raising concerns with prison staff about their handling of \nthe coronavirus. They ask for more cleaning supplies, they ask staff to wear the \nDOC-issued masks instead of the smaller, thinner ones many are wearing, and they ask \nstaff to change their gloves. Prison staff have responded by refusing to give more \ncleaning supplies, saying that it’s too hot to wear the larger masks, and refusing to change \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-17   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 4\n \ntheir gloves. As a result, many inmates are refusing to leave their cells, including to \nshower, because they are concerned about the staff’s gloves.  \n13.When I seek treatment for a medical condition, it is usually a significant wait to see a \ndoctor. When I sought treatment for a root canal, it took from September to January to \nsee a doctor. I’m currently waiting to see a doctor for knee pain and a lump in my knee. \nIt’s been a month and half since I first started requesting treatment and I haven’t received \ntreatment yet.  \n14.People are no longer being pulled out of cell for mental health counseling, which \npreviously happened once per week for people receiving mental health treatment. \n15.I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I would testify to \nthe same statements above if called to do so in court. \n16.I have authorized Madeline Batt to affix my signature to this affidavit for me, because I \nam incarcerated, and it would take a minimum of seven days for me to receive a \ndocument in the mail, sign it in front of a notary, and return it by mail. \n \nExecuted this 8th day of April, 2020. \n​\n​\n \nLuis Pagan \nby       _____________ \n​\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-18   Filed 04/27/20   Page 1 of 5\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT R \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-18   Filed 04/27/20   Page 2 of 5\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-18   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 5\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-18   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 5\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-18   Filed 04/27/20   Page 5 of 5\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-19   Filed 04/27/20   Page 1 of 6\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT S \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-19   Filed 04/27/20   Page 2 of 6\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-19   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 6\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-19   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 6\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-19   Filed 04/27/20   Page 5 of 6\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-19   Filed 04/27/20   Page 6 of 6\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-20   Filed 04/27/20   Page 1 of 7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT T \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-20   Filed 04/27/20   Page 2 of 7\nDeclaration of Chad Petitpas  \n1. I, Chad Petitpas, declare as follows:  \n2. I have been incarcerated at Brooklyn CI for approximately six years. I am  \n40 years old. I am housed in D Dorm of Brooklyn CI. There are four dorms at  \nBrooklyn CI. To my knowledge, there are 114 people housed in each dorm.  \n3. Our facility has been on a kind of “soft lockdown” for the past seven or so  \nweeks. This started when someone in B Dorm tested positive for coronavirus. When  \nthat happened, they quarantined B Dorm. But they still let the other dorms—including  \nmine— go to outdoor rec, and move around freely inside the dorm.  \n4. As I said, there are around 114 people in each dorm, and everyone is split  \ninto 19 cubes. A cube is essentially a room with no roof and no front wall. There are a  \ntotal of three bunks in each cube. When you’re on your bunk, you’re probably about three  \nfeet away from the people in the bunk above or below you, and the bunks adjacent to  \nyou.  \n5. When we are not in our cubes, we are in the open social area. This social  \narea has eight tables. Normally, four people sit at each table, but sometimes, people pull  \nextra chairs around, so that each table can fit six. When people do that, everyone  \nis shoulder-to-shoulder and knee-to-knee.  \n6. No one at the prison has told us to “socially distance” or keep six to eight  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-20   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 7\nfeet away from each other. I have seen those recommendations on TV, but I know that  \nthose safety guidelines are not for us. That is because “socially distancing” is impossible  \n \nhere.  \n7. We have access to the social areas and the bathrooms all day long. That is  \nonly interrupted during counts, which happen twice per day. During the counts,  \nprisoners have to be in their cubes, and other prisoners, who are employed by the prison,  \nclean the social area. They also clean the social area once at night, but this is more of a  \nquick sweep. The tabletops are wiped down once per day with cleaning liquid. I don’t  \nbelieve the chairs are ever cleaned.  \n8. The showers are cleaned once per day. Because we can shower whenever  \nwe like, I would guess that 95 or 100 people shower every day. Nearly all of us use  \nshowers that have not been disinfected.  \n9. The phones are also cleaned one time per day. There are a total of six  \nphones, and every inmate is allowed up to six calls a day. I would guess that  \naround 80-90 people make calls every day, so that is about 13-14 people using the  \nsame phone in a row, before it is disinfected.  \n10. The prison has provided us with a free bar of soap two times. The first  \ntime was about five weeks ago. The second time was about two weeks ago. Because  \nwe usually do not get free soap from the prison, we have to buy it on our own from the  \ncommissary. It costs $0.90. That might not sound like a lot, but to put it in context,  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-20   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 7\nweekly wages for people who are employed by DOC is around $5.50. That means that a  \nbar of soap is equal to almost twenty percent of our weekly salary. Even so, I  \nhave noticed that prisoners who have the means to are cleaning their hands more  \noften than normal. Of course, some cannot afford soap, so they can’t clean their  \nhands.  \n11. The staff have masks, but very few wear them. I would guess that out of  \n100 officers, there are maybe 5 who will wear a mask. The rest of them are adamantly  \nopposed to it. The staff have told me that the masks are not what they were promised,  \nand that they won’t be effective in protecting against the virus. They compare what they  \nhave to putting a t-shirt over their face.  \n12. Because staff refuse to wear the masks, prisoners don’t see the point in  \nwearing them, either. DOC gave every prisoner in my dorm two masks, about two  \nweeks ago. The masks are made of an odd khaki material, similar to our uniform shirts.  \nThe majority of the inmates don’t wear them, because most people have little confidence  \nthat the masks will make a difference. It’s been explained to us on the news and through  \nstaff, that if the virus is contracted it will be because it is brought in by a staff member.  \nSo if the staff aren’t protecting us by wearing masks, we don’t understand what  \ndifference it makes if we, the prisoners, wear them.  \n13. I am also concerned for myself and for other people about what will  \nhappen if we test positive for coronavirus. Brooklyn CI mostly houses people who have a  \ncurrent conviction or a history with a sexual component. A lot of the people here \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-20   Filed 04/27/20   Page 5 of 7\nwould rather not be transferred to Corrigan or Northern. In fact, in the past, those  \nfacilities have been used as a threat. Now, the prison is saying that if a person tests  \npositive, they will be sent to Northern or Corrigan.  \n14. At one point, around five days ago, a number of people made clear that  \neven if they weren’t feeling well, they wouldn’t report their symptoms, because they  \nare afraid of being transferred. The warden heard about this, and so he came down and  \nhad everyone’s temperature taken. According to the digital thermometer, my  \ntemperature was 97.1 degrees. But the thermometer read the temperature of another guy  \nas being 95.7 degrees. I’m pretty sure that if that was his actual temperature, he would  \nbe dead. So I don’t have much confidence that the prison’s procedures are working to  \nscreen out symptomatic staff from coming into the building.  \n15. I am also concerned about what will happen to the many people in my  \ndorm who are close to the end of their sentences. Like I said, I have been at Brooklyn CI  \nfor six years, and over that time I have kind of taken on the role of helping people get  \nset up with homeless shelters, food pantries, and other kinds of services for their release.  \nThis isn’t an “on the books” job, it’s just something I do to help people. So a lot of  \npeople who are close to the end of their sentences come and talk to me. I would guess  \nthat right now, in my dorm, there are about 20 people who are within 60 days of their  \nend-of-sentence date.  \n16. DOC has not announced any procedures in place for an inmate who is at  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-20   Filed 04/27/20   Page 6 of 7\nthe end of his sentence and has a higher than normal temperature. But a number of staff  \nhave told me that what will happen is that DOC is going to take 20-30 days of their \ngood  \ntime away, send them to Corrigan or Northern until the temperature goes down to normal.  \nThis makes me sad, and angry. People have earned their good time. And DOC should not  \nbe able to take it away because they have, and continue to, mismanage their response to  \nthe coronavirus.  \n17. DOC has the discretion to release the people on furlough when they are at  \nthe end of their sentence. Our dorm is at nearly full capacity, and there are many people  \n \nwho are near the end of their sentences, but not one has been released on furlough. I  \n \nthink this is because DOC has an unstated policy of not approving people for community  \n \nrelease who have a sex offense on their records. I am in discovery with DOC on a federal  \n \ncase that is related to this. I believe from what I have learned through this discovery that  \nseven people with sex offences have been approved for community release in the last five  \nyears. I think that this is unjustifiable even in normal times, and I am very discouraged  \nthat DOC won’t even consider behaving differently during a global pandemic.  \n18. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I  \nwould testify to the same statements above if called to do so in court.  \n19. I have authorized Sophia Angelis to affix my signature to this affidavit for  \nme, because I am incarcerated, and it would take a minimum of seven days for me  \nto receive a document in the mail, sign it in front of a notary, and return it by mail.  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-20   Filed 04/27/20   Page 7 of 7\nExecuted this 22 day of April, 2020.  \nChad Petitpas________________  \nby_Sophia Angelis___________  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-21   Filed 04/27/20   Page 1 of 6\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT U \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-21   Filed 04/27/20   Page 2 of 6\nDeclaration of Ken Pierce \n \nI, Ken Pierce, declare as follows:\t\n1.  I have been incarcerated at Carl Robinson Correctional Institution since around \nDecember 2018. I am 39 years old. I was in dorm 3A until about a week ago. \nNow I am in dorm 5D. To my knowledge, there are around 90 people housed in \nthis dorm, and that is the same for all dorms. \n2.  Two days ago, a guy in the dorm was removed because he had symptoms of \ncoronavirus. Yesterday, the Lieutenant came in and announced to the whole dorm \nthat the guy had tested negative, but then he said that the prison authorities were \nputting our dorm on quarantine anyways. So our quarantine just started yesterday, \nApril 14, 2020.  \n3.  I feel skeptical that the Lieutenant was telling the truth when he said that the guy \nthey removed because he had symptoms tested negative. That’s because \nyesterday, two more people were removed from the dorm because they had \nsymptoms, too. I was talking to one of them before he was removed. He looked \nreally sick. I see him every day, so I know how he normally looks, and he really \ndifferent. He was sweaty and pale. I could tell something was not right. I told him \nthat he should tell the guards that he was sick and that they should remove him. \nHe said he had gone to the guard station several times already and told them this, \nand that eventually, they agreed to remove him from the dorm. He was sitting \nthere with his things packed, ready to go. He said he wanted to leave as quickly as \npossible so that he wouldn’t get other people sick. But he had to wait for the staff, \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-21   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 6\nand so he sat in the dorm for a few hours while he was symptomatic. I do not \nknow if he tested positive for coronavirus. \n4.  I feel like it is just a matter of time until we all get infected with the virus. Like I \nsaid, there are 90 people in one big, open dorm, and we all sleep in bunks. Being \nin quarantine means that we usually don’t leave the dorm anymore. For example, \nnow we eat on our laps, sitting on our bunks, instead of going to the cafeteria, \nwhere we normally eat with people from other dorms, because of the quarantine. \nBut even so, we are close together all the time. You can count the tiles on the \nfloor to see how close we are to each other, because the tiles are each 12-inch \nsquares. Me and some of the other guys with bunks near mine recently counted \nthe tiles around our bunk beds. By our count, there are 10 people within four feet \nof each of us every time we go to sleep. When we’re not in our bunks, we can \neither walk around the dorm, or go to the little dayroom that is attached. But there \nis not much more space where we can go.  \n5.  I have not observed any efforts to make the dorm more sanitized since the \nbeginning of the outbreak. We haven’t been given extra cleaning supplies; we get \nthe same amount of cleaning stuff every week as we have before the pandemic, \nand the inmate workers still clean the dorm three times per day. The inmates are \ndoing their best on their own to keep the dorm as clean as possible, but it’s hard to \ndo with 90 guys packed in one room. The one exception is that some guards have \nbought Lysol themselves, I believe with their own money, and brought it in for us \nto use. I don’t think this has been very effective, though, because a staff member \nhas to supervise inmates while they use it, so that rarely happens.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-21   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 6\n6.  I have not observed any changes to the protocols for cleaning showers. We have \nseven shower stalls. They are cleaned three times per day. But the showers are not \ncleaned after each use, so people use showers that have not been disinfected.  \n7.  We also usually do not free soap. The staff has told us that we have to pay for \nsoap from the commissary so long as we have any money in our accounts. I got \none free bar of soap because I complained about it. If I hadn’t complained, I don’t \nthink I would have gotten the bar of soap for free.  \n8.  Every person in my dorm was given one mask. The masks are made of cloth. The \nouter part is the same material that they use to make our “prison tans,” and the \ninner part is made of a t-shirt material. We haven’t been ordered to use them; we \nare told to use them at our own discretion. I would guess that about five or six \npeople in the dorm use the masks, out of 90 guys.  \n9.  The guards also have masks. I would guess that about 85% of the guards wear \nmasks and gloves. I also see them using hand sanitizer really often, either inside \nthe guard station or in bottles attached to their belts. I am not allowed to use hand \nsanitizer, because I am an inmate. I have also been told that the guards have their \ntemperatures checked before they come into the prison every day, though I do not \nsee this. \n10. The only guidance I have received from staff about how to protect myself from \ncoronavirus is rom informational flyers. Those flyers say, if I remember correctly, \nthat we should wash our hands and cover our mouths and noses when we sneeze \nor cough. I have not been told to keep a distance of 6-8 feet between me and other \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-21   Filed 04/27/20   Page 5 of 6\npeople, or to “socially distance.” I assume this is because it would be impossible, \nbecause the dorm is so crowded.    \n11. I am worried about what will happen if I get sick with coronavirus and need to \nseek medical treatment. In my experience, it can take months to see a doctor, even \nwhen there is not a global pandemic going on. For example, I have a bad ear \ncanal, so sometimes it gets infected and bleeds. Last year, my ear got infected and \nstarted bleeding. I tried to see someone from medical, but no one would see me \nfor two days. So I had to spend two days in the dorm with a bleeding ear. After \nthat, a nurse gave me antibiotics, but I have still never seen an ENT doctor, even \nthough I requested it. I have watched other guys wait for months to see a doctor. \nSometimes, you never see a doctor.  \n12. I worry about my family.  For example, my mother is a doctor in the ER in \nMiddlesex Hospital. I am worried that she will get infected while I am still in \nprison.  \n13. I am in prison because I committed a non-violent crime. I have been approved for \nrelease to a halfway house since October 16, 2019, but now I have been told that \nthe halfway houses are not accepting people from prison, so I can’t be released to \none. I know I committed a crime, and that’s why I’m here. But I also feel like I \nearned my release date. I think there are about ten people in my dorm who were \napproved for release and are in prison for non-violent offenses, but now, they’re \nstuck in here, just like me. If they let us go, like they are approved to do, it would \nmake more space for everyone else, and the other prisoners and the staff would be \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-21   Filed 04/27/20   Page 6 of 6\nsafer.

I, Darien Rosario, declare as follows: \n2.  I have been incarcerated at Osborn Correctional Institution since approximately January \n2020. I am 24 years old. I am housed in E unit of Osborn. To my knowledge, there are \napproximately 150 people housed in my unit. \n3.  I live in a cell. I get 45 minutes out of cell two times per day to use the phone and to take \na shower. \n4.  We are no longer doing recreation at Osborn. We stopped doing recreation 1-2 weeks \nago. \n5.  I have one cell-mate, and we sleep approximately 3 feet apart. Our sleeping area is not \ncleaned or sanitized by staff. We have cleaning supplies to clean our own spaces, but \nbecause only my cell-mate is a tier-man and has access to cleaning supplies. I don’t think \nwe would get cleaning supplies otherwise. \n6.  I eat my meals in my cell. We have to go line up to get the meals outside of our cells, and \nwe’re right next to each other in the line. We wear our masks but are not kept socially \ndistant from each other. \n7.  The staff have provided me with one bar of soap, around March 13 , since the pandemic \nth\nstarted. When I’ve needed additional soap, I’ve gotten it from the commissary for a fee.  \n8.  I do not have a shower in my cell. I share 4 showers with the entire unit. The showers are \ncleaned once per day. I also share 4 phones with my entire unit. Previously, my unit \ncould use both phones on both sides of the facility, so had access to 8 phones, but now \nwe’re restricted to the 4 phones on our side of the facility. The phones are wiped down \nbefore rec, but not between uses.  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-22   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 3\n \n9.  Before last week, it was not common to see staff wearing masks or gloves. Starting last \nweek, they are wearing masks consistently. Inmates also are all wearing masks now, \nbecause they put a rule in a place last week requiring it. Before some were wearing masks \nand some weren’t.  \n10. I have come into contact with multiple people in my facility who have tested positive for \nthe coronavirus. They took them out of the unit and quarantined them, but only after \nabout four days of them showing symptoms. \n11. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

I, Christopher Russell, declare as follows: \n2.  I have been incarcerated at Northern Correctional Institution since Monday, April 20th. \nPrior to that I had been incarcerated at Bridgeport Correctional Center since \napproximately the 21  of January. I am 29 years old. I am housed in a block at Northern \nst\nthey are using for medical isolation, in a cell by myself. 6 people were transferred with \nme from Bridgeport to Northern. \n3.  At Bridgeport, prior to coming to Northern, I was in a cell block that housed 20 people. \nWe slept less than 6 feet apart from one another, probably 3 or 4 feet. \n4.  We ate meals all together in the dayroom, less than 3 feet apart. All 20 of us were on top \nof one another. \n5.  Since the coronavirus started, we had our cells cleaned once. Our cells were supposed to \nbe cleaned every Monday, but they weren’t. We would ask for spray bottles and paper \ntowels to wipe down tables and they wouldn’t give us those. \n6.  Correctional officers had masks, but were wearing them around their necks. We were told \nthey were optional and the correctional officers didn’t have to wear them.  \n7.  After my mother had told me the news was reporting that there were COVID-19 cases in \nthe Department of Correction, I asked Correctional Officers at Bridgeport about it. They \ntold me it wasn’t true, and the news was lying. \n8.  I started feeling symptoms last Thursday, April 16 , and I told my block officer. He \nth\nrepeatedly told me he would call me down to medical but he never did. I was not sent to \nmedical until Sunday, April 19 . \nth\n9.  When I was sent to medical, they took my temperature. I had a fever but they didn’t test \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-23   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 4\n \nme for COVID-19. However, they sent me to a cell at Bridgeport with two people who \nhad already tested positive. They left me in the cell for twenty-four hours with the two \nCOVID-positive people.  \n10. After 24 hours in the cell, I was sent to Northern. I still had not been tested. \n11. A day after arriving at Northern, April 21 , I was tested for COVID-19. They have not \nst\nyet told me the results. When I asked the medical staff, they did not respond. They pretty \nmuch just looked at me and walked away. \n12. At Northern, I am in a cell by myself. I get 30 minutes out of cell per day to make two \nphone calls. \n13. I can’t shower at all while I’m here. I have no access to recreation. I have no access to my \nproperty. I cannot order commissary. I feel like they are punishing us for having COVID-\n19. \n14. I was given a care package of a toothbrush and toothpaste, soap, and shampoo when I \narrived at Northern. But it’s not very useful because we can’t shower. If we want to wash, \nwe have to do so in the sink, which is not clean. \n15. At Northern, the CO’s are wearing masks. \n16. The cells are disgusting and dirty. The toilets and sinks are all grimy. There’s toilet paper \nwith urine on it on the floor of my cell. It looks like the cells have not been cleaned in a \nwhile.  \n17. The cells are made of solid concrete and freezing cold. This has made it hard for me to \nsleep and breathe. I have asthma and the cold air makes it hard to breathe. \n18. When I arrived at Northern, I did not have my inhaler. I only got it back last night after I \nwoke up in the middle of night and told them I couldn’t breathe. There is a buzzer I can \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-23   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 4\n \npress in the cell, but I couldn’t get up to press it because I couldn’t move or breathe. I \ncouldn’t do anything until a CO came around on tour. I asked him to call medical, but he \ndidn’t do so immediately. Medical didn’t come until after his next tour, fifteen minutes \nlater. \n19. The only medical care I receive here is Tylenol and Mucinex. Neither of them help. They \ntake my temperature and blood pressure twice per day. They have not told me what \nwould happen if my fever was too high. \n20. Medical staff have told me I can leave Northern 14 days after arriving. \n21. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I would testify to \nthe same statements above if called to do so in court. \n22. I have authorized Madeline Batt to affix my signature to this affidavit for me, because I \nam incarcerated, and it would take a minimum of seven days for me to receive a \ndocument in the mail, sign it in front of a notary, and return it by mail. \n \n  Executed this 22  day of April, 2020. \nnd\n \n                Christopher Russell \n                by       _____________ \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-24   Filed 04/27/20   Page 1 of 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT X \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-24   Filed 04/27/20   Page 2 of 3\nDeclaration of Tyrone Spence \n \n1.  I am an adult.  \n2.  I have been incarcerated at Garner Correctional Institution since \nSeptember 2019. I am 28 years old. I am housed in Echo Unit. To my knowledge, there \nare approximately 90 people currently housed in my unit. \n3.  My unit is not on lockdown, but we are confined to the unit. We get about \n3 hours and 30 minutes of out-of-cell time per day. During this time, we can lift weights \nor play ping pong, chess, or cards. Sometimes, ten or fifteen people use equipment during \none recreation period, and equipment is not cleaned in between each person’s use. Some \npeople use gloves, but they are not used consistently.  \n4.  One other person lives in my cell. We sleep in bunkbeds. The cell is \ncramped, and it is impossible to stay more than five feet away from one another. Our \nsleeping area is not cleaned or sanitized by staff. We have cell clean-up once per week, at \nwhich time we are provided a broom, mop, and cleaner. The cleaner is diluted. If I want \nto clean my cell any other day of the week, I usually use shampoo.  \n5.  I eat my lunch and dinner in the common area of the unit. Each table has \nfour seats. Everyone sitting at a table is within arm’s length of one another. \n6.  The staff do not provide us with soap. I do not have access to hand \nsanitizer. I recently requested that my family send me hand sanitizer, but the prison staff \nwould not allow it.  \n7.  I do not have a shower in my cell. I share six showers with the entire unit. \nThe showers are typically cleaned twice per day. They are also cleaned with diluted \ncleaner. \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-24   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 3\n8. I share six phones with the entire unit. The phones are not cleaned\nbetween each person’s phone calls. I usually place a sock over the phone or put the phone \ninside my t-shirt to protect against germs.  \n9. I have not observed many staff members wearing masks or gloves or\nwashing their hands more often. I have not observed staff checking temperatures of \nincoming persons or staff on a daily basis.  \n10. Staff have placed posters on the wall providing information about what the\nfacility is doing to prevent against transmission of the virus. They have also provided us \nwith two masks made out of the same cloth that our uniforms are made out of.  \n11. One person in my unit had a fever. He was taken off of his work\nassignment in the kitchen, but remained in the unit. Another person in my unit said he \nwas having trouble breathing. He went to medical briefly before being sent back to the \nunit.  \n12. I have been diagnosed with asthma.\n13. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

I, Anthony Toscano, declare as follows: \n2. I have been incarcerated at Willard-Cybulski Correctional Institution since November \n2019. I am 30 years old. I am housed in A dorm of Willard-Cybulski. To my knowledge, \nthere are 75 people housed in my unit. Usually, my unit holds a little over 100 people, but \nmany people have been transferred out recently, a lot of whom have been sick. \n3. Right now, I get 20 minutes out of the dorm per day of outdoor recreation with 9 other \npeople. I also use shared phones and showers that are located in the dorm. \n4.  In my dorm, we sleep approximately 2 feet apart. Our sleeping area is not cleaned nor \nsanitized by staff. We can request cleaning supplies to clean our own spaces.  \n5. I eat my meals in my dorm. During mealtimes, we are spaced less than six feet apart. \n6. The staff initially did not provide us with enough soap, but less than two weeks ago \nstarted giving us soap more consistently and now I have enough. \n7. I share 9 showers with approximately 75 other people in the unit. I also share 6 phones \nwith my entire unit. The phones and showers are typically sanitized once per day. \n8. Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, I have observed staff wearing masks and \ngloves, though not all of the staff wear them.  \n9. Staff have provided me with a one-page pamphlet guidance about how to protect myself \nand others from coronavirus transmission. They have provided me with two masks made \nout of cloth in approximately the first week of April. \n10.I have come into contact with at least 3 people in my facility who have shown symptoms \nof coronavirus. They were removed from the facility, but none of their spaces were \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-25   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 3\n \ncleaned.

I was housed in South Block-5, a general population unit, until Monday. \nTo my knowledge, there are about 100 people housed in my unit. \n3.  South Block-5 is double-celled, with two tiers. We are in our cells 22 \nhours a day. We get out once first shift and once second shift. When we get out, we are \nallowed to use phones or take a shower. We share 12 to 13 phones spread out around the \ndayroom. They usually aren’t sanitized between uses, but they started giving us Lemonall \nand letting us clean them between uses.  \n4.  The cleaning regimen in my unit is pretty much the same as it was before, \nexcept they don’t let us do cell cleanup anymore. They usually would come in every \nweek to let us clean out our cells, but since the pandemic, they don’t let us do that \nanymore. Usually, on Wednesdays and Fridays, we were on lockdown for training \npurposes, and we would be able to clean out our cells during that time, but since the \npandemic they stopped doing that.   \n5.  We share six showers among the whole unit. Nothing is really sanitized \nafter everyone uses it. There were a couple COs that had COVID-19 in Cheshire, but \nnobody in my block was sick that I’m aware of.  \n6.  At the beginning of April, they passed out a bar of soap per person. As of \nMonday, they had not done it again. You can buy soap from the commissary but it’s not \nantibacterial. It’s the same price as it was before.  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-26   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 3\n7.  On April 2, they passed out masks. The warden had come in earlier and \nsaid we could all get gloves, but the COs said no, so we don’t have gloves. We got a \nsecond mask about a week and a half ago. Some people are wearing them and some \npeople are not. \n8.  About the half the COs are wearing blue cloth masks. The rest are not.  \n9.  We still don’t have any social visits.

Ned Lamont  \nGovernor of Connecticut \nConnecticut State Capitol \nHartford, CT \n  \nDear Governor Lamont,  \n \nWe  are writing  as  faculty  members  of  the Yale School of Public Health, the Yale School of \nMedicine, and the Yale School of Nursing to address the urgent threat of COVID-19 in Connecticut \nprisons, jails, and juvenile detention centers. The steps taken and decisions made by your office and \nthe CT Department of Corrections (CDOC) over the past month do not sufficiently mitigate the \ndangers of SARS-CoV-2 in carceral settings. As experts in public health and medicine, we wish to \nexpress clearly and unequivocally that the most effective measure to ensure the safety and wellbeing \nof incarcerated  individuals is  to  thoughtfully  release  a substantial portion of the State’s prison \npopulation.  \n \nCongregate  living  facilities  such  as  prisons,  jails,  and  detention  centers  are  well-known  to  be \nassociated  with  high  transmission  rates  for  infectious  diseases:  tuberculosis,  drug-resistant \ntuberculosis, influenza, MRSA,  and  hepatitis  among them. Due to the disproportionate rate of \ncomorbidities among people in prison, incarcerated individuals are at an elevated risk of Covid-19 \ncomplications and mortality. On April 14th, the CDOC announced the first COVID-19-related \ndeath of an individual in the custody of the State of Connecticut; we fear that this death is just one \nof  many  to  come.  Tragically,  the  man  who  passed  away  due  to  COVID-19  was  imminently \nscheduled for release. \n \nIn a five day period between Thursday, April 9th and Tuesday, April 14th, the number of positive \nCOVID-19  cases  in  CDOC  facilities  spiked from  61 to  182. When compared with state-wide \ninfection rates, the rate of new infections in CDOC facilities is particularly alarming. As medical and \npublic health professionals, we are concerned that the CDOC’s current COVID-19 response plan \ndoes  not  address  the  specific  disease  characteristics  of  SARS-CoV-2  --e.g.  current  screening \nmeasures do not account delayed symptomology or asymptomatic carriers-- nor does the current \nresponse  plan  utilize  the  most  effective  COVID-prevention  strategy,  the  rapid  and  thoughtful \nreduction of the State’s prison population.  \n \nOf the CDOC’s lackluster response to COVID-19, the decision to utilize Northern Correctional \nInstitution--itself a maximum-security facility--to isolate patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 \nis particularly concerning. Transferring all COVID-positive individuals to Northern C.I. is inhumane \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-28   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 8\nand ineffective, especially in light of the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture’s recent condemnation \nof  the  CDOC’s  widespread  use  of  prolonged  isolation.  The  inherently  punitive  nature  of \nconfinement associated with Northern C.I. may ultimately de-incentivize individuals from reporting \nif they become symptomatic. We are concerned that the human rights of incarcerated individuals are \nbeing unduly contravened in the name of medicine; isolation of sick patients in Northern C.I. is a \npunitive measure, not a public health one.  \nFinally, there remains a question of whether the CDOC is prepared to provide adequate medical \nservices to those who become infected while in their custody. Indeed, the union that represents \nhealthcare workers in the CDOC felt compelled to file an amicus brief for the ACLU CT’s lawsuit \nchallenging your response to COVID-19 in prisons; the brief highlighted the unions “specialized \nknowledge of chronic understaffing and limited medical  resources in Connecticut’s correctional \nfacilities.” Incarcerated individuals, their families, advocates, and public health experts have been \nvocalizing  their  concerns  for  weeks,  pleading  with  the  State  to  anticipate  the  ways  in  which \nhealthcare delivery within facilities will inevitably fail amidst a large-scale outbreak: testing kits and \npersonal protective equipment are already in short supply and facilities have limited resources for \nproper respiratory isolation.  \nTherefore, we strongly recommend you to take the following steps:  \n1) Rapidly reduce the number of people in prison. Decreasing the density of prisons is critical \nto mitigate the spread of COVID-19; Connecticut would be following precedent  set by \nnumerous other states that have either begun releasing incarcerated people or are imminently \npreparing to do so; \n \n2) Coordinate  non-congregant  housing arrangements by  renting vacant  hotels  and college \ndormitories for people released from incarceration; ease restrictions on sponsorship that \nprevent incarcerated people from identifying housing upon releases;  \n \n3) Place individuals who test positive for Covid-19 in medical isolation. Solitary confinement \nand quarantine do not provide the protections of medical isolation and should not be used \nas  an alternative. The CDOC should follow the recommendations of David Cloud, JD, \nMPH, Dallas Augustine, MA, Cyrus Ahalt, MPP, & Brie Williams, MD, MS articulated in \ntheir paper, The Ethical Use of Medical Isolation – Not Solitary Confinement – to Reduce COVID-19 \n​\nTransmission in Correctional Settings; \n \n4) Discontinue transfer to the Northern Correctional Institution and only utilize appropriate \nmedical facilities or isolated housing units to treat Covid-positive individuals; \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-28   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 8\n5) Require the CDOC to make their plans for prevention and management of COVID-19 in \neach correctional institutions publicly available; all plans should be coordinated with the \nadvice of independent medical experts; any reports of medical neglect, unsanitary conditions, \nor  violation  of  protocol  should  be  immediately  reported  to  an  independent  body  that \nincludes medical experts who can swiftly develop an actionable remedy; \n \n6) Monitor and ensure the availability of sufficient soap and hand sanitizer for all staff and \nincarcerated individuals, without charge; provide all incarcerated people with appropriate \nPPE.  \nInfectious pathogens are oftentimes invisible cargo: they won’t set off the metal detectors, but \nshould nonetheless be treated as significant threats to the safety and well being of incarcerated \nindividuals and prison staff alike. As medical experts and healthcare workers, we too feel compelled \nto urge your office to treat incarcerated populations, frontline healthcare workers, and correctional \nstaff  with  the  respect  they  deserve.  We  have  an  ethical  responsibility  to  protect  vulnerable \n​\ncommunities in these dark times. However, your duties as our State’s Executive authority extend \nbeyond  moral  platitudes  in  moments  of  crisis:  Covid-19  related  deaths  in  our  incarcerated \ncommunities are preventable tragedies. You must take immediate action.  \n​\nSincerely,  \n(affiliations for identification purposes only) \n1) Gregg Gonsalves, PhD; Yale School of Medicine; Assistant Professor of Epidemiology \n​\n(Microbial Diseases); Associate (Adjunct) Professor of Law, Yale Law School; Co-Director, \nGlobal Health Justice Partnership; \n2) Mayur Desai, PhD, MPH, FACE; Yale School of Public Health; Associate Professor of \nEpidemiology  (Chronic  Diseases);  Associate  Dean  for  Diversity, Equity,  and  Inclusion, \nYSPH; Director, Advanced Professional MPH Program; Core Faculty, National Clinician \nScholars Program \n3) Vasilis Vasiliou, PhD; Yale School of Medicine; Department Chair and Susan Dwight \nBliss Professor of Epidemiology (Environmental Health Sciences) and of Ophthalmology \nand Visual Science \n4) Robert  Heimer,  PhD,  MSc;  Yale  School  of  Medicine;  Professor  of  Epidemiology \n(Microbial Diseases) and of Pharmacology \n5) David Vlahov, PhD, RN, FAAN; Yale School of Nursing; Program Director, Professor \n​\nat the Yale School of Nursing with a joint appointment in Epidemiology and Public Health. \nCo-Director National Program Office for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Culture \nof Health: Evidence for Action Program.   \n6) Sarah Lowe, PhD; Yale School of Public Health; Assistant Professor of Public Health \n​\n(Social & Behavioral Sciences) \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 15-28   Filed 04/27/20   Page 5 of 8\n7) Melinda  Pettigrew, PhD; Yale School of Public Health; Senior  Associate Dean of \n​\nAcademic Affairs and Professor of Epidemiology (Microbial Diseases) \n8) Cary Gross, MD; Yale School of Medicine; Professor of Medicine (General Medicine) \n​\nand of Epidemiology (Chronic Diseases); Founder and Director, Cancer Outcomes Public \nPolicy and Effectiveness Research (COPPER) Center, Yale School of Medicine; Director, \nAdult  Primary  Care  Center,  Quality  Improvement;  Chair,  National  Clinician  Scholars \nProgram;

MAY 1, 2020 \nDECLARATION OF ROBERT J. CRISTIANO \nThe undersigned declarant, Robert J. Cristiano, being duly sworn, hereby deposes and declares \nunder the pains and penalties of perjury, pursuant to 28 USC§ 1746, that: \n1.  I work for the Connecticut Judicial Branch, in the Bail Services unit of the Court \nSupport Services Division, (CSSD), as a Regional :tv1anager.  I have been with the Judicial Branch for \n29 years and in my current role since 2010. \n2.  My 29 years working for the Judicial Branch, CSSD began with 10 years within Adult \nProbation Services, followed by 19 years within Bail Services. During this time, I spent approximately \n5 years as a Supervisor and 10 years as a Regional Manager. \n3.  As a Regional Manager, I oversee the Bail Services offices at nine court locations and \nstatewide Night Bail Services operations, and provide direct oversight of eight supervisors.  My \nprimary responsibilities are to oversee operational functions, develop and implement changes, manage \nstaff, develop and deliver trainings, evaluate and measure performance, and report and measure agency \noutcomes.  I also oversee the Eligibility Investigation Unit for one of our diversionary programs, the \nPretrial Alcohol Education Program.  I am a liaison to internal and external stakeholders, and my \nduties at times include training and answering questions for the State's Attorney's Office, Public \nDefender's Office, defense attorneys, as well as Judicial Branch staff: including training at judges' \nconferences when asked to do so: \n1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-6   Filed 05/01/20   Page 3 of 62\n4.  Based on my own personal knowledge, background and experience I can explain the \nsystem of bail in the Connecticut court system briefly as follows, in this flow chart: \nSystcnt flow ~ls to how a client ~noyes tllr(}ug~Jhe.bailsyste.m \nPolice encounter \nCustodial arrest by police: \n•  If arrested on a warrant containing a court-set bond amount: \no  Client bonds out; or \no  Client remains in custody \n•  If arrested on a warrant allowing the police to set the bond amount or arrested without a \nwarrant, and the police set the bond amount with or without non-financial conditions of \nrelease in accordance with Connecticut General Statutes§ 54-63c: \no  Client bonds out; or \no  Client remains in custody \nBail review during non-court hours \n•  During non-court hours, Bail Services conducts Bail Intake Interviews and Investigations \npursuant to Connecticut General Statutes §§ 54-63d and 54-63b (a) for all clients who remain \nin custody on police-set bond amounts, prioritizing clients whose bond amounts are likely to \nbe affected as a result of the bail review. \n•  Bail Services options after a Bail Intake Interview and Investigation and applying the \nUnifmn1 Weighted Release Criteria established pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes§ \n54-63b (b): \no  Keep the police-set bond amount; \no  Reduce the bond amount, and order the release of the client on a lesser bond amount \nwith or without non-financial conditions of release; or \no  Remove the bond amount, and order the release of the client upon the execution of a \nwritten promise to appear with or vvithout non-financial conditions of release \nBaH review during court hours \n•  During court hours, Bail Services: \no  Conducts Bail Intake Interviews and Investigations pursuant to § 54-56b (a) for all \nclients who remain in custody on any court or police set bond amount prior to their \npresentment for arraignment; and \no  Generates recommendations for the court concerning the terms and conditions of \nrelease applying the Uniform Weighted Release Criteria established pursuant to \nConnecticut General Statutes § 54-63b (b) \n•  During arraignment, the court will hear recommendations concerning the terms and \nconditions of release from the following before ordering the release of the client pursuant to \nConnecticut General Statutes§ 54-64a: \no  State's Attorney \no  Defense counsel \no  Bail Services \n2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-6   Filed 05/01/20   Page 4 of 62\nResults for a client if the case is not disposed of during arraignment: \n1111 \no  If the court orders the release of the client upon the execution of a written promise to \nappear with or without non-financial conditions of release, the client is released once \nthey execute the promise to appear; \no  If the court orders the release of the client upon the execution of a bond with or \nwithout surety and with or without non-financial conditions of release, the client: \n•  If able to post the bond, is released from custody once they do so; or \n•  If unable to post the bond, is remanded to the custody of the Department of \nCorrections until they are able to post the bond or until the final disposition of \ntheir case; \n0  ) \nBail review after arraignment-Jail Relnterview (JRI) \nBail Staff specializing in JRI reviews information on and meets with all clients held on bond \n1111 \namounts of $15 0, 000 or less and the client's attorney or the Office of the Public Defender to: \no  Assist or facilitate the client in posting the bond amount ordered, which includes \nidentifying family members or other individuals who may be able to help the client \npost the bond, and connecting the client with those individuals; and/or \no  Determine whether any additional information gathered justifies recommending a \nbond modification to the court, which may include a recommendation for a reduced \nbond amount, Intensive Pre-Trial Supervision, and/or residential treatment services \nJRI staff also review information on and meet with clients identified either by JRI staff, \n1111 \nPublic Defender Social Workers, court referrals, or attorneys to determine whether a bond \nmodification recommendation for residential treatment is appropriate. \nIf JRI staff determine that a recommendation for a bond modification is appropriate, they \n1111 \nassist the client's attorney or the Office of the Public Defender in bringing a Motion for Bail \nModification with the court for the court to determine whether to modify the client's bond \namount or other conditions of release .. \n5.  CSSD Policy 4.1, copy attached, as Exhibit A,  provides that CSSD will provide prompt bail \nnre-trial release services for nersons/clients referred to CSSD bv the oolice, pursuant to Section \n~--- --------~-- ---- J.  Ill  .&.  .~....,  • \n54-63c,  of the General Statutes, or by a Judge of the Superior Court.  (See Exhibit A, attached). \n6.  Bail Staff use specific factors to decide what type and how much bond should be posted. These \nfactors are called \"uniform weighted release criteria\" and they are required by Connecticut \nGeneral Statutes § 54=56b (b). \nWhat are the weighted release criteria? \nThe nature and circumstances of the offense \n1111 \n3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-6   Filed 05/01/20   Page 5 of 62\n•  The defendant's record of previous convictions \n•  The defendant's past record of appearance in court after being admitted to bail \n•  The defendant's family ties \n•  The defendant's employment record \n•  The defendant's financial resources \n•  The defendant's character and mental condition \n•  The defendant's community ties \n7.  Except in cases where a person is arrested on a warrant signed by a judge and the bond has already \nbeen set or denied by the judge, all arrested persons have the right to be interviewed about the \nterms and conditions of their release. \n8.  The Jail Re-Interview Program (\"JRI\") is a program to help pre-trial offenders who have not \nposted bond. As a result of are-interview, the court may change the amount of the bond or the \nconditions of release. The JRI Staff may also recommend that the court refer offenders for \ntreatment. \n9.  CSSD policy 4.7, copy attached as Exhibit B, describes in detail the JRI process, and provides \nthat CSSD assigned staff will review information for defendants held in lieu of bond, and \nreassess identified defendants at a Department of Correction (DOC) facility to facilitate the bond \nprocess or to determine if a bond modification recomn1endation is appropriate. \n10.  Following a number of emergency measures, Judge Carroll as the Chief Court Administrator \nissued a number of Notices and Orders impacting Judicial Operation, but as of March 26, 2020, \none of those orders stated, in part, that Effective immediately and until further notice, entrance to \ncourthouses that remain open is being limited to those individuals who are: Filing or have a \n4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-6   Filed 05/01/20   Page 6 of 62\nhearing for a Temporary Restraining Order. Therefore, emergency Temporary restraining \nOrders, to my knowledge, at all times were being accepted and acted upon by a judge. \n11. CSSD Executive leadership has had conference calls with Judge Joan Alexander, who is the \nstatewide presiding judge for all criminal matters, to discuss on-going CSSD pretrial releases and \nnext steps during this COVID-19 operational plan of the state courts. Between March 25,2020 \nand April28, 2020, Bail Services JRI staff have undertaken a special review of approximately \n1500 pretrial inmates, and the court has granted a total of 172 defendants release upon the \nexecution of a Written Promise to Appear as a result of a JRI bond modification recommendation \nand a review of their cases by the State and Public Defender. This is slightly more than 1O o/o of \npretrial inmates previously held on bond, being re-interviewed, and then having a judge approve \na bond modification to a Written Promise to Appear, resulting in release.  Despite the operational \nlimitations of the Courts, to a reasonable degree of professional certainty, this initial phase of the \nreview of the pretrial population has been a success. \n12.  After a review of the case, if the court orders release upon the execution of a Written Promise to \nAppear, Promise to Appear paperwork is sent to the records office of the correctional facility, \nand the inmate can be released by DOC without having to make a personal appearance in court. \n13.  I reviewed the relevant records from the Judicial Branch, as well as the regularly kept business \nrecords of Bail Services for the named petitioner in this case, Tre McPherson, #391124.  Upon \nreview,  initially McPherson was held on a total of $5,1 00 bond, and he had a criminal history \nreflecting the following: \n•  Conviction I 0/21/2015 Failure to Appear 2nd 1 year \n•  Conviction 12/18/2019 Larceny 2nd 5 years e/s, probation 3 years (active out of Stamford) \n•  Arrest 01/02/2020 Bridgeport Operating without License, Failure Maintain Proper Lane. \nReArrest 02/18/2020. Outstanding warrant. $10,000 bond. \n•  Arrest 01/24/2020 Bridgeport Operating Under Suspension, Failure Proper Lane. \nReArrest 02/18/2020. Outstanding warrant. $10,000 bond. \n5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-6   Filed 05/01/20   Page 7 of 62\n•  Arrest 01124/2020 Bridgeport Operating Under Suspension, Failure Display Plate. \nReArrest 02/18/2020.

Next Court Date 06/19/2020 Bond set $5,000. \ne  Pending 02/20/2020 Norwalk Failure to Appear 1st.  Underlying Violation of Probation. \nNext Court Date 07/01/2020 Bond set $100.  Underlying case Failure to Appear pt \n10/08/2015 5 years e/s/a 1 day, probation 5 years. \n14.  Although CSSD staff review the case, and make recommendation, it is extremely important to \nunderstand that the judge is the ultimate decision maker regarding terms and conditions of \npretrial release.  CSSD is not.  From my experience, Mr. McPherson has an involved or active \ncriminal justice profile.  In my opinion, Mr. McPherson still presents high risk for failing to \nreappear and for reoffending, which could affect his potential to be released on a Written \nPromise to Appear. His release on a Written Promise to Appear is a judgment call for a judge \nunder the uniform weighted release criteria.  My summary, in part, is based on his Failure to \nAppear 1st pending on the Violation of Probation charge, which is on an underlying Failure to \nAppear 1st (felony) conviction.  McPherson additionally has convictions for felony larceny and \ntwo counts of felony sale of controlled substance both of which resulted in violation of probation \nguilty pleas and three year prison terms.  Also, a separate conviction for Failure to Appear 2nd \nwhere he received a sentence of 1 year to serve.  The removal of the Failure to Appear warrants, \npotential vacating, allows the client to be released IF the court granted the client into a JRI \nplacement.  But there are a lot of IFs that need to be decided by the judge on this client. \n15. On April22, 2020, Mr. McPherson's criminal defense counsel filed a Motion to Vacate the \nRearrests. See Exhibit C, attached. \n16. On April27, 2020,  the criminal court in Bridgeport, Judge Alexander, vacated the Failures to \nAppear (that were holding him up from release) based on defense Motions, and lowered the \nexisting bonds (in Bridgeport GA # 2 &  GA 20 Norwalk) to Promises to Appear. \n6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-6   Filed 05/01/20   Page 8 of 62\n17. As a result, on April27, 2020, Mr. McPherson was released from the DOC on a Promise to \nAppear. \n18. With regard to the other pretrial detainee at issue in this case,  I have reviewed the records of Ms. \nPatti kate Williams-Void, and her criminal history reflects the following: \n•  Conviction 10/16/2002 Sale Narcotics 21a-277(b) 1 year e/a/a 10 days, probation 3 \nyears \n•  Conviction 011251979 Assault 3rd 3 month e/s, probation 1 year \nShe is presently held on bond on the following three files out ofNew Britain Superior Court: \n•  H15NCR200325256S Sale Narc, Control w/I 1500' $25,000 \n•  H15NCR200325254S Sale Narc, Control w/I 1500' $25,000 \n•  H15NCR200325253S Sale Narc, Control w/I 1500' $25,000 \n19.  Ms. Williams-Void was interviewed by Bail Services during court hours utilizing our Bail \nIntake process which includes a risk assessment.  At arraignment, Bail Services \nrecommended that the court set a bond on each file, all three, at a Written Promise to Appear \n(non-financial release) with the following Conditions of Release imposed: Electronic \nMonitoring with a lockdown setting except for leaves for medical, legal and court \nappointments. ·However, the Court imposed the following on each of three files, at $25,000 \ncash or surety bond (for a total of$75,000), with the following Conditions of Release \nimposed: Electronic Monitoring with a lockdown setting except for leaves for medical, \nlegal, and court appointments. \n20. There are always important factors to consider when interpreting the bond set by a judge, be \nit non-financial or financial and most notable the amount on financial circumstances.  The \nCT statute varies slightly between that of Bail and Judicial criteria, but they are different, \nand those differences can have significant contributions to the ultimate decision maker-the \nCourt.  See Com1. Gen. Stat.  Sec. 54-64a. Release by judicial authority. \n7 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-6   Filed 05/01/20   Page 9 of 62\n21. The next initiative CSSD leadership and Judge Alexander have discussed with respect to the \npretrial population during COVID-19 operational plan for the state courts is to start \nreviewing those clients who have been screened and accepted into a residential treatment \nprogram through the JRI process. These cases will first be reviewed by the State's Attorney \nand Public Defender to determine if an agreed upon disposition can be reached that includes \nplacement into the program. \n22. If an agreement for disposition cannot be reached, the Court may consider a conditional \npromise to appear however, case disposition would be the preferred process.  A \nvideoconference from DOC to the court could be set up for those cases in which a plea will \nbe entered as part of the agreement before any release to the program. \n23. If no plea is required, a videoconference would not be necessary and all the paperwork for \nrelease would be processed through DOC.  In either scenario, the defendant would not be \nbrought to court.  There are approximately 20 of these cases ready to go.  If we all agree this \ncan work and is in the best interest of the client, we can begin the process of scheduling the \nvideo conference and/ or release immediately. \n24.  In an on-going and continuing exchange of e-mails, between CSSD and the Office of the \nChief Public Defender, v.;e discussed trying to identify those individuals ·who have been held \nin pretrial status at DOC who may have enough time in to cover the maximum sentence \nallowed by statute for the charge they are being held on. The hope is that the Public \nDefenders would know about these cases and could bring those that fall into this category to \nthe court for a disposition. We could accomplish this through videoconferencing or if an \nagreement could not be reached, a Written Promise To Appear to allow the defendant out of \nDOC custody. \n8 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-6   Filed 05/01/20   Page 10 of 62\n25.

OF FAIRFIELD \nv. \nAT G.A. 2 BRIDGEPORT \nTRE MCPHERSON  APRIL 22, 2020 \nMOTION FOR  MODIFICATION OF BOND 1 \nThe Defendant,  TRE  MCPHERSON,  hereby moves pursuant to  The  Fifth and \nFourteenth  Amendments  of the  United  States  Constitution,  Article  First,  §  8  of the \nConnecticut  Constitution,  and  §  38-17  of the  Connecticut  Practice  Book,  for  this \nHonorable Court to reduce the Defendant's bond to a promise to appear. In support of \nthis motion, the Defendant makes the following representations: \n1.  On February 26, 2020, the Defendant was arrested and charged in the above \ncaptioned matter with the following: \n•  Evading Responsibility, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. §14w224 (b) (2), \n•  Reckless Driving, , in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. §14-222, \n•  If legal Operation Under Suspension, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. § 14-\n215, \n•  FaHure to Drive in a Proper Lane, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. §14-\n236; \n2.  On February 18, 2020, this Court ordered rearrests after noting the absence of \nthe Defendant when the above-captioned matters were called on the record; \n3.  Upon information and belief, the Defendant was in a detox program at \nSCADD Acute Care & Evaluation in New London, CTI on February 18, 2020; \n4.  On  February 26,  2020,  this Court ordered a  bond  of $5000 in the above \ncaptioned matter. The Defendant is unable to post this bond; \n1 This motion is filed in the Judicial District of Fairfield Courthouse (Part A) pursuant to the March 181 20201 \nOrder issued by the ChiefCourtAdministratorJ the Honorable PatrickL. Carroll1111 limiting each Judicial District \nin the State of Connecticut to one location for all matters due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-6   Filed 05/01/20   Page 59 of 62\n(FAX TRANSMISSION) To: 12033828401 From: 0000000000 Pages: 4 \n5.  On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially classified COVID-\n19 as a pandemic.2  Connecticut, along with most other states, has declared a \nstate  of emergency,  and  President  Donald  Trump  has  declared  a national \nemergency.  With confirmed cases on the rise in Connecticut, the collective \ncommunity,  including the courts,  must take necessary action to  protect the \ncommunity at large, especially vulnerable populations such as prisoners; \n6.  As of April 21, 2020, the new strain of coronavirus which causes COVID-19, \nhas  infected  over  2,500,000  people,  leading  to  at  least  172,21 0  deaths \nworldwide;3 \n7.  As of 2:00 P.M. on April 21, 2020, the Department of Corrections has listed 308 \ninmates and 222 staff members as positive for COVID-19. Individuals counted \namong that list are confirmed as having been located in Bridgeport Correctional \nCenter, where the Defendant is currently housed. 4 \n8.  The Defendant has essentially now served  almost two months in prison on \nthese motor vehicle charges. \n9.  As before, but certainly no\\AJ in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and given the \nstate of the nation, the Defendant has no incentive to flee the area or abscond. \nDuring his release, the Defendant will be subject to the Governor's directives \nurging residents to stay home to reduce the spread of the highly contagious \nCOVID-19 virus; \n10. Moreover,  the  Defendant  is  not  a risk  or danger to  the  community.  The \nDefendant has no history of violence in his record and poses no imminent threat \nto the community-but while  he remains detained COVID-19 poses a direct \nand  imminent threat to  his life.  The aforementioned, in addition to the non \nviolent nature and offense-level of his current charges, constitutes good cause \nfor the granting of this request. \nWHEREFORE!  the  Defendant  respectfully  requests  this  Court  to  modify  the \nconditions of the Defendant's release. \n2  WHO  Characterizes  COVID-19  as  a  Pandemic\"  Wor1d  Health  Organization  (March  11,  2020)  at \n.b.ltP.~-~/./..hlkJ~l./.2-YY.B.d~~~Ji.S. \n3  Coronavirus  Map:  Tracking  the Spread of the Outbreak,  The New York Times  (March  12, 2020)1  at \nktt~.:sJ..b:~~J.:LU-1~LHt.l.k.r:u.ttd (updating regularly). \n4 h.t.ttw;JiP.~iLH~J...t;.tg,Qy).D.Q~.J.~.Qmm~.m::.l'Uttm~.u!.:JJJ~.Q.Ullll~~J.t::.EJ.~nJ.~JJ.t~L.H~;JJJ.h:-1J;.f.Qr.nu~lh~i:!:.<Am.l:h.m:.t~.,g.r1tt~ \n(April 22, 2020). \n2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-6   Filed 05/01/20   Page 60 of 62\n(FAX TRANSMISSION) To: 12033828401 From: 0000000000 Pages: 4 \nRespectfully Submitted, \nTHE DEFENDANT, \nTRE MCPHERSON \nBy:  D~r~~ \nDaniel Fernandes Lage.

As shown below, \nthe Petitioners’ claims fail as they have failed to exhaust available state court remedies, and for \n§1983 and PLRA purposes, administrative remedies.   \nAlternatively, under the Younger abstention doctrine this Court should decline to exercise \njurisdiction over these claims because they implicate various state judicial orders and mittimuses, \nimpacting pending criminal pretrial matters, including detention and bond orders, as well as the state \nmandamus action brought by the same counsel.1 \nI.  BACKGROUND \n \nOn April 20, 2020, Petitioners filed their Petition against Respondents Ned Lamont, the \nGovernor of the State of Connecticut, and Rollin Cook, the Commissioner of the Connecticut \nDepartment of Correction.  The individually named Petitioners are inmates held in various facilities \n \n1 As instructed by the Court during the April 29, 2020 status conference, Respondents herein address only their \nchallenges to the Court’s jurisdiction.  Respondents reserve the right to challenge Petitioners’ motion for a \ntemporary restraining order, requests for preliminary and permanent injunctions and any efforts to certify a \nclass if and when necessary. \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-1   Filed 05/01/20   Page 2 of 27\nof the Connecticut Department of Correction (“DOC”) and they allegedly have pre-existing health \nconditions or are otherwise in an age group that allegedly place them at “significantly higher risk of \nsevere disease and death if they contract [COVID-19].”  (Doc. #1 at 2, ¶1.)  Petitioners request to \nbring this action as a class action, alleging, inter alia, violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments.  They seek the “immediate release” of numerous, indeed potentially thousands, of \ninmates who are “50 and older and those with medical conditions that place them at heightened risk \nof severe illness or death from COVID-19.”  Id.  Petitioners contend that the immediate release of \nthese “Medically Vulnerable Subclasses” will allow Respondents the ability to implement social \ndistancing measures.  Id.  Critically, the Petition includes a complete lack of allegations or requests \nfor relief that would suggest how they or any putative class members would be managed or cared for \nif released to the community. \nPetitioners further seek injunctive relief as to two classes: the first comprised of Pre-\nAdjudication individuals, and the second comprised of Post-Adjudication individuals.  Id. 2  \nTogether the two classes comprise the entirety of the current inmate population.  Id.  As part of their \nproposed injunctive relief, Petitioners conflate the deliberate indifference standard of the Eighth and \nFourteenth Amendments with administrative recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention,  requesting an order mandating that Respondents create a “plan” to ensure \n“[s]pecific mitigation efforts, consistent with CDC guidelines, to significantly reduce the risk of \nCOVID-19 for” all inmates and “an evaluation” of whether “DOC must release additional” inmates \nin order to “be in compliance with CDC guideline[s].”  (Doc. #1 at 34, ¶4.) \n \n2 There is no motion pending for class certification, and Respondents will oppose class certification as the \nindividual public safety risk issues that pertain to each offender, and the unique health concerns would \nnecessarily require that the individual issues would predominate over the common issues to the putative class. \nFurther, it is impossible to determine who is medically “vulnerable” and thus it would be impossible to \ndetermine who would be in the class and who would be excluded.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-1   Filed 05/01/20   Page 3 of 27\nOn April 27, 2020, Petitioners filed their Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (Doc. \n#15) claiming, inter alia, essentially the same allegations regarding the conditions of confinement in \nthe DOC facilities.  (Id. at 1, ¶1.)  Petitioners claim their requested preliminary relief is justified and \nfurther seek “emergency” preliminary relief.  (Id. at 2, ¶2.)  Clearly, the Petitioners’ TRO is, in fact, \na motion for a permanent, mandatory injunction seeking to compel the release of thousands of state \ninmates lawfully confined in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction.  On April 29, 2020 the \nCourt held a telephonic Status Conference (Doc. #27) in which counsel appeared to discuss the next \nsteps.  This Motion to Dismiss follows.         \nII.  ARGUMENT \n \nPetitioners attempt to classify their action as both a habeas matter and a civil rights suit under \n§ 1983.  As a preliminary matter, since Petitioners primarily seek a mass release of inmates, such a \nrequest is not cognizable in a § 1983 action and “cannot be granted in a civil rights action pursuant \nto section 1983” because it goes to “the fact or duration of a [Plaintiff’s] confinement” and therefore \n“only habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b) with its exhaustion requirement may be \nemployed.”  Morgan v. Dzurenda, No. 3:14-CV-966 SRU, 2014 WL 6673839, at *4 (D. Conn. Nov. \n21, 2014) (quoting Jenkins v. Haubert, 179 F.3d 19, 23 (2d Cir.1999)); see also Preiser v. \nRodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 489–90 (1973) (habeas corpus was appropriate remedy for inmates seeking \nrestoration of good-conduct-time credits which would shorten the length of their confinement in \nprison).   \nPetitioners are seeking, first and foremost, an order from this Court commanding \nRespondents “to identify all Medically Vulnerable Subclass Members in both the Pre-adjudication \nand Post-adjudication Classes within six (6) hours of the Court’s order and release—within twenty-\nfour (24) hours of submission of the list—all such persons…”  (Doc. #1 at 34, ¶2) (emphasis \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-1   Filed 05/01/20   Page 4 of 27\nadded).  Only after this mass release is completed do Petitioners then seek a court-ordered “plan” to \nreduce the risk of COVID-19 to remaining inmates.  (Id. at 34, ¶3.)  Still, this proposed “plan” is \nmerely a precursor to an “evaluation” of whether Respondents must “release additional members of \nthe Classes” in order to comply with CDC guidelines.  (Id. at 34, ¶3b.)  Finally, Petitioners are \nseeking further release of all supposedly medically vulnerable inmates as time progresses in order to \nremain in compliance with CDC guidelines.  (Id. at 34-35, ¶¶4a, 4d.)  In other words, this action is \nabout releasing inmates, not about changing the conditions of inmates’ confinement.  As such, \nPetitioners are seeking a writ of habeas corpus, plain and simple.  To classify it as a § 1983 action is \nmisleading and this Court should treat this as it really is: a Petition for a writ of habeas corpus by \nstate inmates via § 2254, with its concomitant state court exhaustion requirements. \nNoticeably absent from the Petition are necessary allegations regarding the Petitioners’ \nefforts to exhaust state court or administrative remedies and their outcomes.  There is no indication \nthat Petitioners ever attempted to pursue any state court or administrative remedies as required under \nthe applicable statutes and case law.  Indeed, the Court can take judicial notice of the absence of any \nstate court actions filed by any of the named Petitioners.  See Mangiafico v. Blumenthal, 471 F.3d \n391, 398 (2d Cir. 2006) (“docket sheets are public records of which the court could take judicial \nnotice.”).  \nAlso notably absent from the allegations is notification to this Court that there is a mandamus \naction filed with the Connecticut Superior Court.3  See Connecticut Criminal Defense Lawyers \nAssociation, et al. v. Lamont, Ned, et al, Superior Court, Judicial District of Waterbury, Docket No. \nCV20-6054309.4  (CCDLA v. Lamont.)  This state mandamus action was also filed against Governor \n \n3 As is noted more fully below the State Court (Bellis, J.) recently dismissed that action on April 24, 2020.  As \nof April 30, 2020, the court has not entered a final judgment of dismissal, nor has that decision been appealed.    \n4 Attached as Exhibit A, Also available at \nhttp://civilinquiry.jud.ct.gov/CaseDetail/PublicCaseDetail.aspx?DocketNo=UWYCV206054309S.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-1   Filed 05/01/20   Page 5 of 27\nNed Lamont and Commissioner of Correction Rollin Cook.  Further, in the state court action, the \nplaintiffs sought an order of mandamus compelling the defendants to, inter alia, “immediately \nrelease all people having the CDC heightened risk factors for serious illness or death from COVID-\n19…immediately reduce the population density at each and every facility in which they confine \npeople.”  CCDLA v Lamont, Amended Complaint (Doc. #114) at 22, ¶93.   The very fact that the \nsame attorneys were able to file such an action in state court completely refutes any claim that the \nstate courts are “closed.”  In fact, this very same action that is now pending before this Court could \nhave been filed in the state court, together with an emergency restraining order, and it would have \nbeen considered priority 1, and would have been dealt with appropriately.5 \nOn April 8, 2020, the parties participated in a status conference call with Judge Bellis, who \nset a schedule for considering the motion to dismiss.  The parties filed memoranda on April 9th and \nApril 13th, the court heard argument on April 15th and issued a memorandum of decision on April \n24, 2020.6 \nA.  Petitioners’ Habeas Claims Are Barred For Failure To Exhaust. \nA prisoner must exhaust his or her administrative remedies prior to seeking a federal writ of \nhabeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 and must exhaust state court remedies prior to seeking a \n28 U.S.C. § 2254 petition.  See Baldwin v. Reese, 541 U.S. 27, 29 (2004) (“Before seeking a federal \nwrit of habeas corpus, a state prisoner must exhaust available state remedies [pursuant to] 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2254(b)(1)”); United States v. Smalling, 644 Fed. App’x 3, 4-5 (2d Cir. 2016) (challenge to \nexecution of sentence must be brought in a section 2241 proceeding, but only “after exhaustion of \n \n5 See email dated April 4, 2020 from Attorney Barrett to Judge Abrams, who is the statewide presiding judge \nfor all civil matters.

(citing Baldwin, 541 U.S. at 32). \nHere, this Court lacks jurisdiction because Petitioners have not alleged and cannot show that \nthey have exhausted their remedies in state court.7  Indeed, Petitioners do not even allege that they \nhave attempted to do so or that they are somehow barred from doing so.8  Other than the first named \nPetitioner Tre McPherson9, there is nothing to indicate that any of the Petitioners have sought release \n \n7 Pichard v. Connor, 404 US 270, 275 (1971), (“It has been settled since Ex parte Royall, 117 U.S. 241 (1886), \nthat a state prisoner must normally exhaust available state judicial remedies before a federal court will entertain \nhis petition for habeas corpus.”); see also Pitchess v. Davis, 421 US 482, 487 (1975) (“Under our decision in \n[Picard] exhaustion of state remedies is required as a prerequisite to consideration of each claim sought to be \npresented in federal habeas.”). \n8 Petitioner Lowery does, in fact, make the false claim that state remedies are unavailable to him.  As noted \nabove, Lowery’s counsel participated in a state court matter prior to his filing of Lowery’s petition in this Court.  \nSee supra at p. 5 and n. 7. \n9 Infra, Petitioner McPherson has been released from custody pursuant to a Promise to Appear (“PTA.”). See \nDeclaration of Michelle DeVeau.

Gen. Stat. § 52-466 et seq. in state court.  This failure alone robs this Court of \njurisdiction.  See Saturno v. Mulligan, No. 3:18CV504(AWT), 2019 WL 1789902, at *2 (D. Conn. \nApr. 24, 2019) (“With respect to the other three grounds, the petitioner has not alleged that there is \nno opportunity for redress in state court or that the state court process is clearly deficient. Thus, he is \nnot excused from exhausting his state remedies before proceeding in federal court.”). \na.  There is no excuse for failing to exhaust as the State Courts are \nopen and hearing matters. \n \n“Failure to exhaust may be excused only where ‘there is no opportunity to obtain redress in \nstate court or if the corrective process is so clearly deficient to render futile any effort to obtain \nrelief.’”  Coleman, 2012 WL 2515541, at *1 (quoting Duckworth v. Serrano, 454 U.S. 1, 3 (1981) \n(per curiam)); see also Ellman v. Davis, 42 F.3d 144, 149 (2d Cir. 1994) (emphasizing the words \n“only,” “no opportunity,” “so clearly deficient,” and “futile.”).  “A petitioner cannot, however, \nsimply wait until appellate remedies no longer are available and argue that the claim is exhausted.”  \nId. (citing Galdamez, 394 F.3d at 73–74). \n“Futility is present when there is a ‘complete absence of a mechanism for correction of the \nalleged unconstitutional violation’ or the petitioner is ‘precluded by an unconscionable breakdown \nfrom using the process that exists.’”  Jordan v. Bailey, No. 13 Civ. 7651, 2013 WL 6233889 \n(S.D.N.Y. Dec. 1, 2013) (quoting Francis S. v. Stone, 995 F. Supp. 368, 380 (S.D.N.Y.1998), aff’d, \n221 F.3d 100 (2d Cir.2000)).  See Declarations of Kathryn Stackpole (Exhibit D) and Rob Cristiano \n(Exhibit E).  \nA petitioner’s ignorance does not excuse the exhaustion requirement.  See Peterkin v.

Alleged delay cannot excuse the exhaustion requirement unless \nthe court finds a violation when weighing the speedy trial factors of Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 \n(1972). See Roberites v. Colly, 546 F. App’x 17, 19-20 (2d Cir. 2013) (affirming the district court’s \ndismissal of § 2254 petition despite 32-month delay by state appellate courts between filing criminal \nappeal and filing habeas petition).  Nor can alleged “procedural obstacles” excuse the exhaustion \nrequirement when such obstacles are in fact, “reasonable procedural requirements.”  See Saunders v. \nComm’r, Dep’t of Correction, No. 10 CV 410 MRK, 2011 WL 572313, at *2 (D. Conn. Feb. 15, \n2011) (quoting Ellman, 42 F.3d at 149).  \nPetitioners do not allege that they have even attempted to exhaust their state court remedies \nas required by the statute and precedent.  To the extent they assume they are somehow relieved from \nthis statutory prerequisite, they have seriously misapprehended the current situation in Connecticut \nState Courts.10  The courts are open and are currently hearing and processing inmate requests for \nrelease via a variety of judicial mechanisms.  Several inmates have already filed actions in state \ncourt for release based on similar claims related to COVID-19 and these claims are being acted \nupon.  (Exhibit A.)  Indeed, Mr. McPherson was actually recently released on a PTA after his \ncriminal defense attorney requested this from the criminal court.  See Declaration of Rob Cristiano, \n(Exhibit E), ¶17; see also Declaration of Michelle DeVeau. (Exhibit C), ¶4. \nFurther, counsel from the ACLU and a Yale Law School clinic filed a mandamus action in \nstate court seeking the mass release of thousands of inmates.  See CCDLA v.Lamont, supra.  The \nbrief history of the CCDLA matter demonstrates the full availability of litigation remedies in our \nstate’s courts.  ACLU counsel, Attorney Dan Barrett, who appears for Petitioners in this matter, filed \nthe state court CCDLA matter on Friday April 3, 2020, and later that day sent an email to Superior \n \n10 See Declaration of Kathryn Stackpole, Assistant Clerk for Habeas Matters, (Exhibit D). \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-1   Filed 05/01/20   Page 11 of 27\nCourt Judge James Abrams, who serves as the Chief Administrative Judge for Civil Matters, \nreporting that the case had been filed and sought emergency relief.  The following morning, a \nSaturday, Judge Abrams responded to the email indicating that the court was aware of the case and \nwould take “appropriate measures” and later that day the case was transferred from the Hartford \nSuperior Court to the Complex Litigation docket in Waterbury.  The next business day, Monday \nApril 6, 2020, the clerk for the Complex Litigation docket emailed all counsel, provided his personal \ncellphone and other contact information, and scheduled a status conference call with the judge \nassigned to the case for two days following, Wednesday April 8, 2020.  The next day, the defendants \nfiled a motion to dismiss and an opposition to the request for mandamus.  Within three weeks, the \ncase was docketed, Respondents filed a motion to dismiss, this motion was argued, and the court \n(Bellis, J.) rendered a decision granting dismissal.  (Exhibit A.)  See also Day, Robert #253376 v. \nCommissioner of Correction, Superior Court, Judicial District of Rockville, Docket No. CV17-\n4008971-S11 where within seven (7) days the petitioner’s habeas motion was filed, objected to, and \nthe presiding habeas judge (Bhatt, J.) rendered a decision.  (Exhibit F.)  And in New Haven, an \ninmate named Daniel Greer was recently temporarily released from custody pursuant to his request \nfor bond while his conviction is being appealed.  (Exhibit G.)   \nInmates like the proposed class not only have access to the state courts to bring actions \nseeking their release, the courts have accommodated inmates by instituting particularly speedy \nlitigation schedules.12  Any allegation of futility is completely belied by the prompt and expeditious \n \n11 http://civilinquiry.jud.ct.gov/CaseDetail/PublicCaseDetail.aspx?DocketNo=TSRCV174008971S; a copy of \nJudge Bhatt’s Ruling is attached hereto (Exhibit F), for the convenience of the Court.  \n12 In addition, there have been numerous motions for immediate release due to COVID-19, as well as motions \nfor bond or for compassionate release, and the state court has treated these motions expeditiously. See \nDeclaration of Kathryn Stackpole, Exhibit D; See also, e.g Grimes v Commissioner, Dkt. No. TSR-CV20-\n5000478-S http://civilinquiry.jud.ct.gov/CaseDetail/PublicCaseDetail.aspx?DocketNo=TSRCV205000478S \n(motion for immediate release filed April 14, 2020). (Exhibit H). On April 29, 2020, Judge Bhatt docketed 3 \nemergency habeas petitions in Hartford.  Judge Bhatt has not issued any orders yet. The cases are: Solomon \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-1   Filed 05/01/20   Page 12 of 27\ntreatment these matters are currently receiving in state courts.  And any representation to the \ncontrary by Petitioners is bewildering, particularly in light of the active participation by Petitioners’ \nConnecticut counsel in at least one of those matters: CCDLA et. al. v. Lamont, et. al.   \nConnecticut’s state courts are providing exceedingly prompt attention to emergency motions, \nincluding but not limited to, habeas petitions and emergency motions seeking release or, in criminal \nmatters, emergency reductions in bond, and requests for PTA’s, due to COVID-19.  See Money v. \nPritzker, 2020 WL 1820660 at *22, (N.D. Ill., April 10, 2020) (“To be sure, exhaustion requirements \ncan…be waived when relief is truly unavailable. But waiving them here—when state courts clearly \nwere available …would turn the habeas system upside down.”). \nb.  The current COVID-19 pandemic is no excuse for failing to \nexhaust. \n \nPetitioners go into great length to describe the current COVID-19 pandemic and the \nextraordinary circumstances the state, the prisons, and, in particular, the Petitioners face.  And while \nRespondents—who are responsible for the health and safety of all of Connecticut’s citizens—\ncertainly recognize the extraordinary challenges presented by COVID-19, these circumstances do \nnot excuse statutory exhaustion requirements.   \nNationwide, inmates are seeking release through several methods both in state and federal \ncourts.  One such method available to federal inmates comes via compassionate release pursuant to \n18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A).  Like § 2254, § 3582 has an exhaustion requirement.13  But despite the \n \nBoyd v. Commissioner of Correction (COC), HHD-CV20-5063875; Douglas Murphy v. COC, HHD-CV20-\n5063876; Malik Nunn v. COC, HHD-CV20-5066377. (Exhibit I).  On March 26, 2020, the Judicial Branch \nannounced, in part, that matters from Rockville will transfer to the Hartford GA #14 courthouse. See  \nhttps://jud.ct.gov/COVID19.htm.  Therefore, Petitioner Lowery’s assertion that “habeas matters are not being \nprocessed in the state courts,” (Case 3:20-cv-00528-JBA, Doc. #1 at 3, ¶10) is simply inaccurate. \n13 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A): “(A) the court, upon motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or upon \nmotion of the defendant after the defendant has fully exhausted all administrative rights…” \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-1   Filed 05/01/20   Page 13 of 27\nexigencies arising from the current crisis, courts are not excusing the statutory exhaustion \nrequirement in these cases.   \nIn United States v. Raia, 954 F.3d 594 (3rd Cir. 2020), the Third Circuit held the petitioner’s \nlack of exhaustion to be fatal to his motion for release.  The court held “the mere existence of \nCOVID-19 in society and the possibility that it may spread to a particular prison alone cannot \nindependently justify compassionate release, especially considering BOP’s statutory role, and its \nextensive and professional efforts to curtail the virus’s spread…Given BOP’s shared desire for a safe \nand healthy prison environment, we conclude that strict compliance with § 3582(c)(1)(A)’s \nexhaustion requirement takes on added—and critical—importance.”  Id. at 597. \nSimilarly in this District, a petitioner’s failure to exhaust amid COVID-19 concerns barred \nhis compassionate release petition.  See United States v. Gamble, 2020 WL 1955338, at *2-3, (D. \nConn., April 23, 2020), appeal filed, No. 20-1379 (2d Cir. Apr. 27, 2020).  “‘While the [c]ommon \nlaw (or ‘judicial’) exhaustion doctrine ... recognizes judicial discretion to employ a broad array of \nexceptions that allow a plaintiff to bring his case in district court despite his abandonment of the \nadministrative review process,’ this array of exceptions—including futility—is simply not available \nwhen the exhaustion requirement is statutory.”  Id.

Scranton, 532 \nF.2d at 294; Marte, 2011 WL 4946708, at *6. \nAs argued supra for post-adjudication inmates, there have been no factual allegations made \nwhich indicate that anyone in the proposed petitioner class has even initiated, let alone fully \nexhausted, their state court remedies.  And just like their post-conviction counterparts, the pretrial \nPetitioners have not offered, nor could they offer, any viable excuse for their failure to exhaust.  As \nsuch, the pretrial Petitioners are also barred from seeking federal habeas relief due to their failure to \nfully exhaust their state court remedies. \n \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-1   Filed 05/01/20   Page 16 of 27\nB.  Petitioners’ Claims Are Barred Under the Younger Abstention Doctrine. \n \n“Younger16 exemplifies one class of cases in which federal-court abstention is required: \nWhen there is a parallel, pending state criminal proceeding, federal courts must refrain from \nenjoining the state prosecution.  This Court has extended Younger abstention to particular state civil \nproceedings that are akin to criminal prosecutions, see Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592, 95 \nS.Ct. 1200, 43 L.Ed.2d 482 (1975), or that implicate a State’s interest in enforcing the orders and \njudgments of its courts, see Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco Inc., 481 U.S. 1, 107 S.Ct. 1519, 95 L.Ed.2d 1 \n(1987).”  Sprint Communication, Inc. v. Jacobs, 571 U.S 69, 73 (2013).   \n1.  This Court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction over this action as \nthere is a pending state mandamus action purportedly brought on behalf \nof the same inmates against the same state officials. \n \n “Although the Younger abstention doctrine was born in the context of state criminal \nproceedings, it now applies with equal force to state administrative proceedings…This doctrine of \nfederal abstention rests foursquare on the notion that, in the ordinary course, a state proceeding \nprovides an adequate forum for the vindication of federal constitutional rights. Therefore, giving the \nrespect to our co-equal sovereigns that principles of ‘Our Federalism’ demand, we generally prohibit \nfederal courts from intervening in such matters.” Diamond “D” Const. Corp. v. McGowan, 282 F.3d \n191, 198 (2d Cir. 2002) (quoting Younger, 401 U.S. at 44).  \n“Younger abstention is required when three conditions are met: (1) there is an ongoing state \nproceeding; (2) an important state interest is implicated in that proceeding; and (3) the state proceeding \naffords the federal plaintiff an adequate opportunity for judicial review of the federal constitutional \nclaims.”  Id.  \n \n \n16 Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971). \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-1   Filed 05/01/20   Page 17 of 27\na.  There is an active state proceeding. \n \nThe first condition is met.  As noted earlier, Petitioners’ counsel brought a mandamus action \nin state court, essentially raising the same federal constitutional issues alleged in this case.  In \nCCDLA v. Lamont, supra, the plaintiffs asked the court to issue a writ of mandamus to, inter alia, \norder Governor Lamont and Commissioner Cook, both Respondents here, to release inmates with \nmedical conditions considered to be high risk factors by the CDC when contracting COVID-19.  The \naction was filed on April 3, 2020.  Defendants appeared and filed a motion to dismiss, which was \nrecently argued.   Although the court granted the motion to dismiss on April 24, 2020, judgment has \nnot entered and the appeal period remains open. Thus, the Petitioners’ federal constitutional claims \nhave not been presented to the state’s highest court and they have failed to fully exhaust in state \ncourt. \nPetitioners are obviously aware of this CCDLA case but seem to raise the argument that since \nRespondents sought dismissal of the action in state court on jurisdictional grounds, they are \nsomehow barred from also seeking dismissal here.  By raising this bizarre and ultimately unavailing \nargument17, Petitioners are essentially conceding that the federal issues within CCDLA v. Lamont are \n \n17 Respondents sought dismissal in CCDLA v. Lamont because those plaintiffs had no standing, both because \nCCDLA could not invoke third party standing and because the individual plaintiffs had not actually alleged \ninjury in that they did not claim that the Respondents had the requisite mental state of recklessness necessary \nto state a deliberate indifference claim.  The Respondents also sought dismissal because the plaintiffs sought a \nmandamus ordering Executive branch officials to exercise their discretion, granted to them by the Legislature, \nto release thousands of inmates.  This presented a non-justiciable political question.  Respondents did not \nargue that the federal courts had jurisdiction, as such an argument would make no sense given the exhaustion \nrequirements of both §2241 and §2254 and the fact that inmates cannot secure release via §1983.  See Gulley \nv. Ogando, No. 3:18-CV-858 (SRU), 2020 WL 1863276, at *1 (D. Conn. Apr. 13, 2020); see also Preiser, \n411 U.S. at 487–90 (holding that a state prisoner challenging the length of confinement and requesting \nimmediate release must do so by a habeas petition, not by a section 1983 suit).  To the extent Petitioners \nattempt to advance an argument that Respondents are estopped from seeking dismissal here because of \nCCDLA v. Lamont, this fails because it fallaciously assumes that 1. there must be some judicial forum with \njurisdiction, whether federal or state, for any claims presented and 2. that the proper forum for their claims \nwere either a state mandamus action or a federal habeas action.  Naturally, they are wrong and as argued \nsupra, the proper forum for their complaints would be found via habeas, bond reduction, or sentence \nmodification in the state courts, which are open for business. \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-1   Filed 05/01/20   Page 18 of 27\nthe same as the issues contained within their Petition.  No appeal has been sought in CCDLA v. \nLamont, but this does not obviate the necessity to “present the factual and legal bases of his federal \nclaim to the highest state court capable of reviewing it” or to utilize “all available means to secure \nappellate review of [the] claims.”  Fernandez, 2013 WL 870385, at *2.  Regardless, the first prong \nof Younger is met here.18  \nb.  There is an important state interest in that proceeding. \n \nThe second condition is met.  “A state interest is important for purposes of the second \nYounger abstention factor where ‘exercise of the federal judicial power would disregard the comity \nbetween the States and the National Government.’”  Grieve v. Tamerin, 269 F.3d 149, 152 (2d Cir. \n2001) (quoting Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 481 U.S. 1, 13 (1987)).  “In this Circuit, resolution of \nthis question turns on whether the state action concerns the central sovereign functions of state \ngovernment.”  Id. (quotation omitted).   \nThe State plainly has an interest in the supervision of its prisons and the judicial adjudication \nof the wide discretion the state legislature has given its executive branch officers in exercising that \nsupervision.  Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 229 (1976) (“[T]he administration of [prisons] is of \nacute interest to the States.”).  Both the federal and state courts give significant deference to the \nCommissioner in how to adequately provide for the safety and security of the inmates under his \ncharge.  See Pierce v. Lantz, 113 Conn. App. 98, 106 (2009) (“The courts ... give wide ranging \ndeference to the decisions of the commissioner in establishing guidelines for the order and discipline \nof the facilities that she governs”); Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 126, 132 (2003) (Courts owe \n \n18 This prong is also satisfied by the ongoing criminal matters in state court best represented by the named \nPetitioner, Mr. McPherson.  Since this action was filed, Mr. McPherson sought and received relief, while his \nunderlying charges remain pending.  This is representative of the potentially thousands of inmates the \nPetitioners seek to include within a class, who are now seeking relief in the state courts via similar bond \nreductions, habeas petitions, and sentence modifications. \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-1   Filed 05/01/20   Page 19 of 27\n“substantial deference to the professional judgment of prison administrators, who bear a significant \nresponsibility for defining the legitimate goals of a corrections system and for determining the most \nappropriate means to accomplish them”); Washington v. Meachum, 238 Conn. 692, 733-34 (1996) \n(Courts are “ill equipped” to manage the “Herculean obstacles” presented when administering the \nstate’s prisons).  \nc.  There is adequate opportunity for judicial review of federal \nconstitutional claims.  \n \nThe third condition is also met.  As part of the state mandamus action, the plaintiffs claimed \nviolations of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments as they apply to convicted prisoners and \npretrial detainees, respectively.  CCDLA v. Lamont, Amended Comp. at 21, ¶¶90-92.  The \nconstitutional claims were also extensively briefed in plaintiffs’ objection to the motion to dismiss.  \nThe court in CCDLA v. Lamont addressed the constitutional claims and the attendant lack of injury \nof the inmate plaintiffs in its decision on the motion to dismiss.  “[U]nder Art. VI of the \nConstitution, state courts share with federal courts an equivalent responsibility for the enforcement \nof federal rights, a responsibility one must expect they will fulfill.”  Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 \nU.S. 738, 755-56 (1975).    \nAs all three of the conditions are met, the Younger abstention clearly applies.  As such, even \nif Petitioners had properly exhausted or if their obligations could be somehow excused, Respondents \nrespectfully submit that this Court not exercise jurisdiction.  \n2.  Pre-adjudication detainees also fall under the first class of cases under \nYounger doctrine. \n \nAlthough the pretrial Petitioners are presumably not challenging the constitutionality of their \ncriminal prosecutions, this action still attempts to circumvent state court criminal procedures by \nseeking to essentially invalidate state court mittimuses and orders regarding the setting of bail. See \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-1   Filed 05/01/20   Page 20 of 27\nDeclaration of Rob Cristiano, (Exhibit E).  Orders such as these have been individually considered \nby judges and include the weighing of such factors as risk of danger to the community and risk of \nflight. See Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 54-63b, 54-63d, 54-64a; see also Cristiano Decl.  To allow \nPetitioners to sweepingly invalidate these orders would jeopardize the integrity of on-going state \ncourt criminal proceedings, by increasing danger to the community and the risk that detainees would \nflee.  This would naturally thwart the state’s ability to seek criminal convictions and potentially \njeopardize the safety of its residents. \nIn State v. Anderson, the Connecticut Supreme Court in affirming the criminal trial court’s \nimposition of a bond of $100,000, concluded that risk of danger to others was a permissible factor in \nsetting a bond amount, stating: \nThe very focus of the court’s inquiry, therefore, was on whether the defendant safely \ncould be released to the hospital again on a promise to appear, or whether permitting \nhim  to  remain  there,  without  further  conditions,  would  create  an \nunacceptable risk of danger to others. In making this determination, the court, pursuant \nto the statutory directive, was required to consider a broad array of factors, including \nthe defendant’s mental health, the charges pending against him, the strength of the \nevidence supporting those charges, the defendant’s history of violence and previous \nconvictions, and the likelihood that he would commit another crime if released.  \n \nState v. Anderson, 319 Conn. 288, 321 (2015) (citing Conn. Gen. Stat. § 54–64a (b)(2)). \n  Petitioners here seek an order from this federal court essentially negating the careful \nconsideration of a broad array of factors that was made by each state court judge when setting bail, \nand potentially releasing hundreds if not thousands of “pre-adjudication” inmates without  any notice \nto the states’ attorneys, criminal defense counsel, and—perhaps most importantly—to the alleged \nvictims.  This would also essentially ambush scores of state court judges who are statutorily charged \nwith reviewing individual bail decisions, and completely ignore and circumvent the process whereby \nindividual pretrial detainees can seek review of their bonds.  See Conn. Prac. Bk. §§38-13 et.seq. \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-1   Filed 05/01/20   Page 21 of 27\n  As was noted by the Supreme Court: “What they seek is an injunction aimed at controlling \nor preventing the occurrence of specific events that might take place in the course of future state \ncriminal trials… This seems to us nothing less than an ongoing federal audit of state criminal \nproceedings which would indirectly accomplish the kind of interference that Younger v. Harris, … \nand related cases sought to prevent.”  O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 500 (1974). “In a recent \nexplication of Younger in Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592, (1975), Mr. Justice Rehnquist, \nwriting the majority opinion, reiterated that federal injunctions against the state criminal law \nenforcement process could be issued only under extraordinary circumstances where the danger of \nirreparable loss is both great and immediate.”  Wallace v. Kern, 520 F.2d 400, 404 (2d Cir. 1975) \n(internal citations and quotation marks omitted).  Such an action would be inappropriate here, where \nPetitioners have not yet sought any relief from the courts that set bail in their individual cases, nor \nhave they even attempted to seek a writ of habeas corpus in state court. \nC.  Petitioners Also Failed To Exhaust Administrative Remedies. \n1.  Inmates must exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing §1983 \nclaims. \n \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a), requires inmates to exhaust \nadministrative remedies before seeking relief in federal court.  Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 532 \n(2002).  The exhaustion provision of the PLRA provides in relevant part that “[n]o action shall be \nbrought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, \nby a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative \nremedies as are available are exhausted.”  42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) (emphasis added).  By enacting the \nPLRA, Congress sought to afford prison officials time and opportunity to address complaints \ninternally and reduce the quantity, and improve the quality, of prisoner suits.  Porter, 534 U.S. at \n524-25.  \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-1   Filed 05/01/20   Page 22 of 27\nPetitioners’ attempt to characterize this action as a §1983 case is undercut by their request for \nrelease from confinement which is not cognizable and “cannot be granted in a civil rights action \npursuant to section 1983” because it goes to “the fact or duration of a [Petitioners’] confinement” \nand therefore “only habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b) with its exhaustion requirement may be \nemployed.”  Morgan v. Dzurenda, No. 3:14-CV-966 SRU, 2014 WL 6673839, at *4 (D. Conn. Nov. \n21, 2014) (quoting Jenkins v. Haubert, 179 F.3d 19, 23 (2d Cir.1999)); see also Preiser, 411 U.S. at \n489–90 (“when a state prisoner is challenging the very fact or duration of his physical imprisonment, \nand the relief he seeks is a determination that he is entitled to immediate release or a speedier release \nfrom that imprisonment, his sole federal remedy is a writ of habeas corpus.”) (emphasis added). \nSince Petitioners primarily seek “release” rather than additional hand soap, and other disinfectants or \ndistancing measures which as a practical matter would require releasing prisoners, this action should \nbe treated for what it really is, a federal habeas petition which fails because Petitioners failed to \nexhaust available state court habeas remedies. See Declaration of Kathryn Stackpole, Exhibit D; see \nalso various state court petitions, docket sheets, and motions, attached hereto as Exhibits F through J. \nConstruing this action, arguendo, as a §1983 action, it is nevertheless barred by the plain text \nof the PLRA exhaustion requirement. The Supreme Court has consistently found the language of the \nPLRA exhaustion provision to be mandatory.  Ross v. Blake, 136 S. Ct. 1850, 1856 (2016); see also \nJones v. Bock, 539 U.S. 199, 211 (2007) (“There is no question that exhaustion is mandatory under \nthe PLRA.”).  The Supreme Court has held that inmates must exhaust administrative remedies before \nfiling any type of action “about prison life, whether they involve general circumstances or particular \nepisodes, and whether they allege excessive force or some other wrong.”  Porter, 534 U.S. at 532.  \nThe PLRA exhaustion requirement applies regardless of whether the inmate may obtain the specific \nrelief he desires through the administrative process.  Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 741 (2001).     \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-1   Filed 05/01/20   Page 23 of 27\nAn inmate who fails to file administrative grievances and exhaust his remedies may not bring \nthe claim in federal court.  Adekoya v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 375 Fed. App’x. 119, 121 (2d Cir. \nApril 29, 2010) (barring inmate federal lawsuit where inmate failed to exhaust administrative \nremedies).  Further, “[p]roper exhaustion demands compliance with an agency’s deadlines and other \ncritical procedural rules.”  Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 90-91 (2006); see also Ruggiero v. County \nof Orange, 467 F.3d 170, 176 (2d Cir. 2006).  “An ‘untimely or otherwise procedurally defective \nadministrative grievance’ . . . does not constitute proper exhaustion.”  Snyder v. Whittier, 428 Fed. \nApp’x. 89, 91 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting Woodford, 548 U.S. at 83-84).  To properly exhaust a claim, a \nprisoner must comply with the prison grievance procedures, including utilizing each step of the \nadministrative appeal process.  Snyder, 428 Fed. App’x at 91 (citing Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, \n218 (2007)); see also Ruggiero, 467 F.3d at 176 (“PLRA requires ‘proper exhaustion,’ which ‘means \nusing all steps that the agency holds out and doing so properly.’”) (quoting Woodford, 548 U.S. at \n89). \nThe PLRA exhaustion requirement may only be excused where administrative remedies were \nnot available to the inmate.  Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1862.  The Supreme Court has identified three \ncircumstances in which an administrative remedy is not available for an inmate to obtain relief: (1) \n“the administrative remedy may operate as a ‘dead end,’ such as where the office to which inmates \nare directed to submit all grievances disclaims the ability to consider them . . . [(2)] the procedures \nmay be so confusing that no ordinary prisoner could be expected to 'discern or navigate' the \nrequirements . . . [a]nd [(3)] prison officials may ‘thwart inmates from taking advantage of a \ngrievance process through machination, misrepresentation, or intimidation.’”  Shehan v. Erfe, No. \n3:15-CV-1315 (MPS), 2017 WL 53691, * 6 (D. Conn. Jan. 4, 2017) (quoting Ross, 136 S. Ct. at \n1859-60).  \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-1   Filed 05/01/20   Page 24 of 27\nThe PLRA defines a “prisoner” as “any person incarcerated or detained in any facility who is \naccused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law or \nthe terms and conditions of parole, probation, pretrial release, or diversionary program.”  42 U.S.C. § \n1997e(h).  There is no dispute that all Petitioners,19 both “pre-adjudication” and “post-adjudication,” \nfall within the PLRA’s definition of “prisoner.”   Accordingly, the exhaustion requirement of the \nPLRA applies to the instant action. \n2.  Petitioners did not exhaust available administrative remedies. \nFor the petitioners to properly exhaust their administrative remedies, DOC requires the \nprisoner to file grievances and follow the procedures imposed by Administrative Directive (AD) 9.6.  \n(Exhibit K, DOC Administrative Directive 9.6); see also Riles v. Buchanan, 656 Fed. App’x. 577, \n579 (2d Cir. 2016) (Summary Order) (“The Connecticut Department of Correction requires inmates \nto submit grievances in accordance with Administrative Directive 9.6); Shehan v. Erfe, No. 3:15-\nCV-1315 (MPS), 2017 WL 53691, at *6 (D. Conn. Jan. 4, 2017).  In Sheehan, Judge Shea noted \nthat, “the inmate must exhaust his administrative remedies for each claim he asserts in federal \ncourt.”  Id. (citing Baldwin v. Arnone, No. 3:12cv243(JCH), 2013 WL 628660, at *5 (D. Conn. Feb. \n18, 2013)).   \nOftentimes, exhaustion is raised as an affirmative defense by way of a motion for summary \njudgment. “However, if it is apparent from the pleadings themselves, and the documents attached \nthereto or incorporated therein, that the plaintiff has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, \nthen the complaint may be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).”  Paschal-Barros v. Kenny, No. \n3:18-CV-1870 (VLB), 2019 WL 2720739, at *3 (D. Conn. June 28, 2019) (citing Nelson v. Deming, \n \n19 Except for McPherson who was released by the state court after his bond was reduced to a PTA. \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-1   Filed 05/01/20   Page 25 of 27\n140 F. Supp. 3d 248, 264 (W.D.N.Y. 2015)).20  “‘[C]ourts routinely consider extrinsic material on a \nmotion to dismiss for nonexhaustion,’ even without conversion pursuant to Rule 12(d).”  Id. (quoting \nMcCoy v. Goord, 255 F. Supp. 2d 233, 250 (S.D.N.Y. 2003)). This Court may consider the \nPetitioners’ failure to exhaust, as well as the extrinsic evidence set forth in the Declarations of \nMichelle King (Exhibit L), Marc Hambrecht (Exhibit M), Jessica Bennett (Exhibit N),  Ronald Cotta \nand D’Andra Basley-Motley  (Exhibit O), and Donald Acus (Exhibit P) in connection with the \nRespondents’ Motion to Dismiss.   \nIndeed, Petitioners do not allege that they have exhausted their administrative remedies, nor \ndo they claim an exception to the exhaustion requirement pursuant to Ross.  However, to the extent \nPetitioners respond that exhaustion would be futile due to the length of time it takes to properly \nexhaust all steps of the grievance procedure, the Supreme Court has rejected such arguments.  \n“[The] PLRA’s text suggests no limits on an inmate’s obligation to exhaust—irrespective of \nany ‘special circumstances.’”  Ross at 1856.  The amendments to the PLRA exhaustion requirements \neliminated both the discretion to dispense with administrative exhaustion and the condition that the \nremedy be “plain, speedy, and effective” before exhaustion could be required. Booth v. Churner, 532 \nU.S. 731, 739 (2001).  Indeed, as discussed above, if Petitioners sought a “plain, speedy and \neffective” remedy, they could have, should have, and still can file a state court habeas petition, \nwhich does not require administrative exhaustion.  Congress has mandated exhaustion regardless of \n \n20 See also Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 214–15 (2007) (complaint may be dismissed sua sponte for failure \n“when an affirmative defense ... appears on its face”); Stimpson v. Comm’r of Correction, No. 3:16-CV-00520 \n(SRU), 2017 WL 3841646, at *4 (D. Conn. Sept. 1, 2017) (holding “[i]t would be futile to permit [plaintiff] to \nproceed with regard to the unexhausted claims against [DOC officials].”); Thomas v. Metro.

Booth at 741. \nAs was the case with their potential remedies in state court, Petitioners have simply not \nexhausted their administrative remedies.  Petitioners are not permitted to “leapfrog” both the \nadministrative exhaustion requirement of the PLRA and the state court exhaustion requirements of \n§§ 2241 and 2254.  cf. Tota v. United States, No. 99-CV-0445E(SC), 2000 WL 1160477, at *1 \n(W.D.N.Y. July 31, 2000) (finding no subject matter jurisdiction where plaintiff failed to exhaust \nadministrative remedies and stating, “[plaintiff] may not circumvent the administrative procedures \nand leapfrog to this Court on the theory that the agency failed to respond to the later requests.”).  \nPetitioners cannot mandate that a federal court usurp the role of the state courts by bringing an \nexhausted claim before it and simply claiming exigency.  This Court should therefore dismiss this \naction. \nIII.

(Entered: 05/18/2020) \n05/18/2020  61   ORDER denying 57 Respondents' Motion in Limine to Preclude \nUndisclosed Expert Testimony of Dr. Robert Murphy. \n \nPlaintiffs were ordered to provide a list of expert and lay witnesses by \nthe close of business on May 15, 2020. 52 . On May 15, 2020, Plaintiffs \ninformed Defendants' counsel that they intended to call Dr. Robert L. \nMurphy as one of their expert witnesses and that the doctor's \nqualifications, declaration and disclosure would be forthcoming. On \nSunday, May 17, Dr. Murphy's declaration was forwarded to defendants. \nPlaintiffs state that they transmitted the declaration as soon as they had \nit. Plaintiffs need to substitute a different infectious disease doctor, rather \nthan use a doctor who previously provided a declaration, was driven by \n\nexigencies of the current pandemic and the pressing responsibilities of \nprominent, busy, clinicians. Further, Plaintiffs represent that Dr. \nMurphy's testimony closely tracks that previously provided by Dr. \nGolub, as well as that of Plaintiffs' other medical declarants. While the \nCourt understands the demands on Defendants and their counsel, they \nare not unduly prejudiced. Counsel knew as of last week that Plaintiffs \nmight provide a substitute expert due to the tight scheduling \nrequirements, and that the substitute witness's qualifications and \ntestimony would be consistent with prior declarations filed in support of \na TRO and/or preliminary injunction. Nor, are Defendants prejudiced by \na lack of an expert report prior to a deposition. As set forth during the \nconferences on May 11 and 14, the parties are engaging in expedited \ndiscovery and there is insufficient time for perfect Rule 26 disclosures. \nSee McPherson v. Lamont, Civ. No. 3:20-cv-00534 (JBA), ECF No. 56, \nat *1 (D. Conn. May 16, 2020) (quoting In re World Trade Ctr. Disaster \nSite Litig., 722 F.3d 483, 487 (2d Cir. 2013) (It is well established that \ndistrict courts possess the inherent power and responsibility to manage \ntheir dockets 'so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of \ncases.'). Defendants will have an opportunity to depose Dr. Murphy and \ninquire into his credentials, experience and basis for his opinion. On this \nrecord, the Court finds no surprise or prejudice to Defendants in the \nsubstitution of Dr. Murphy as an expert witness. See, id., at *2 (finding \nexigent circumstances exist warranting an expedited schedule and noting \nthat Defendants have had notice of Plaintiffs' claims since the case was \nfiled on April 20, 2020, and to review the evidence filed in support of a \nTRO and Preliminary Injunction since April 27, 2020). \n \nThe Court remains available to address issues as they arise on an \nexpedited schedule. While the parties have a right to be heard on their \nobjections and to develop a record, there is limited time remaining to \nprepare for a preliminary injunction hearing on May 22, 2020.

JOY:  Good  morning,  Your  Honors. \n4  ATTY.  FISCHER:  Good  morning. \n5  THE  CLERK:  Yesterday  -- Mr.  -- Attorney  Joy  and \n6  I  communicated.  He  had  noticed  that  their  Client \n7  Michael  Young  was  on  for  a  matter  in  Rockville.  I \n8  looked  it up,  Attorney  J.  Patten  Brown  was  to \n9  represent  him.  I  called their  office  and  found  out \n10  that,  in  fact  Attorney  Brown  would  not  be \n11  representing  in  Rockville  that  matter  was  off.  Our \n12  computers  did  not  know  that.  I  think  nobody  notified \n13  them  and  so,  we  were  trying  to  find  out  whether  or \n14  not  this  matter  was  going  to  go  forward  today.  It \n15  appeared  that  videos  are  deleted  from  our  --\n16  JUDGE  FISCHER:  So,  what's  the  status? \n17  ATTY.  JOY:  Well,  I  received  a  voice  mail  this \n18  morning  not  to  come  here  and  so,  I  actually went  to \n19  GA  19  because  they  told me  he  was  going  to  be  there. \n20  I  wanted  to  talk to  him  and  he  obviously  is  not \n21  there,  we  don't  know  if he's  available  today. \n22  But,  I  think  you  need  a  little background  on \n23  this -- on  this matter.  It's very  strange  the  way  I \n24  ended  up  on  this  case.  He  went  to  trial with  Norman \n25  Pattis,  all  right,  all  the  way  through  to  a  guilty \n26  verdict.  At  which  time,  Mr.  Pattis  decided  that  he \n27  thought  Mr.  Young  needed  a  54/560,  which  he  filed  a \n\n2 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-10   Filed 07/07/20   Page 5 of 7\n1  motion  for,  which  Mr.  Young  objected  to,  and  he  fired \n2  Pattis,  and  Judge  Kwak  let  Pattis  off. \n3  I  was  brought  in  for  sentencing.  So,  I  was  not \n4  at  the  trial,  I  know  nothing  about  it,  I  just \n5  appeared  at  sentencing  and  attempted  to  resolve  his \n6  other  nine  cases;  where  he  was  to  receive  two  first \n7  time  DUI's,  six months  suspended  after  forty-eight \n8  hours  on  each,  to  run  concurrent  to  what  he  was \n9  sentenced  to.  He  refused  that,  he  wanted  to  take  all \n10  nine  of  the  cases  to  -- go  to  trial,  at  which  time, \n11  he  briefed me.  I  was  able  to  withdraw  and  Attorney \n12  Brown  was  brought  on. \n13  So,  I  did  file  a  motion  to  withdraw  from  The \n14  Sentence  Review  and  I  was  hoping  to  resolve  that \n15  today,  but  it doesn't  look  like  we  can. \n16  JUDGE  FISCHER:  What's  the  status  with  Attorney \n17  Brown? \n18  ATTY.  JOY:  I  think,  Attorney  Brown,  had  a  death \n19  in  the  family  and  that's  why  today  did  not  go \n20  forward. \n21  THE  CLERK:  And  I  don't  know  what  matter  he's \n22  representing  him  on. \n23  ATTY.  JOY:  It's two  it's one  of  the  DUI \n24  cases  with  a  evading,  and  he  then  ran  from  the \n25  police. \n26  JUDGE  FISCHER:  All  right.  We'll  do  this, \n27  Attorney  Joy,  based  on  your  representations  to  this \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-10   Filed 07/07/20   Page 6 of 7\n1  panel,  we'll-- we  will  allow  you  to  withdraw  your \n2  representation  of  Mr.  Young. \n3  ATTY.  JOY:  Very  good.  And  I  think,  the  panel \n4  may  want  to  decide  if Attorney  Pattis  is  needed  for  a \n5  further  sentence  review. \n6  THE  COURT:  All  right.  Thanks,  Counsel. \n7  ATTY.  JOY:  Thank  you  very much. \n8  THE  COURT:  Thank  you. \n9  THE  CLERK:  Okay.

And  our  standard  is,  is  it inappropriate  or \n21  disproportionate  to  others  who  are  similarly \n22  situated.  Okay? \n23  THE  DEFENDANT:  Yes,  yes. \n24  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  That's  our  only  review  here. \n25  THE  DEFENDANT:  Umm. \n26  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Would  you  -- would  you  like  to \n27  represent  yourself  at  this  hearing? \n\n..  ....  ... \n4.  . .'  4 . .' \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 6 of 64\n3 \n1  THE  DEFENDANT:  Well,  at  this  point  I'm  not  - \n2  I'm  not  inclined to  waive  any  of  my  rights,  but  I \n3  would  just  refer  The  Court  maybe  to  take  judicial \n4  notice  under  Connecticut  Code  of  Evidence.  I  believe \n5  it's 2.2. \n6  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay. \n7  THE  DEFENDANT:  And  I'll rely on  the  acurite \n8  record  that  has  been  established  on  that  -- that \n9  issue. \n10  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay.  So,  you  don't  want  to \n11  be  heard  on  this? \n12  THE  DEFENDANT:  No,  no,  no.  I  do  want  to  be \n13  heard  today  and  I  want  to  fill my  obligation  of  - \n14  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay. \n15  THE  DEFENDANT:  -- on  this  part  of  the  matter. \n16  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  All  right.  If we're  going  to \n17  go  forward  then  I  do  have  to  put  you  under  oath \n18  because  I  to  question  you.  Okay? \n19  THE  DEFENDANT:  Yeah,  but  I  have  some \n20  preliminary matters  I'd like  to  discuss  with  The \n21  Court  at  this  time  before  we  do  that. \n/'2  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  We  got  the  preliminary matters \n23  where  you're  only  appearing  for  a  limited purpose,  is \n24  that  what  you  want  The  Court  to  know? \n25  THE  DEFENDANT:  I  don't  believe  I  filed  a  -- an \n26  appearance  in  that manner. \n27  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  No,  just  for  -- again,  for  the \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 7 of 64\n4 \n1  Special,  I  think  you're  calling  it a  Special  Reprisal \n2  for  Sentence  Review,  correct? \n3  THE  DEFENDANT:  Well  that's  part  of-- while- \n4  I  had  already,  I  believe,  yeah  I  already  filed  that. \n5  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Yeah. \n6  THE  DEFENDANT:  So,  if The  Court  has  that \n7  memorandum. \n8  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Yeah,  we're  good. \n9  THE  DEFENDANT:  Along  with  the  attachments. \n10  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Yup. \n11  THE  DEFENDANT:  So,  if I  could  just  clarify  for \n12  the  record  that  you've  got  everything  because  I've \n13  been  having  problems  with  the  mail  coming  out  of  DOC. \n14  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Nope,  we've  got  everything. \n15  THE  DEFENDANT:  Well,  if we  could  just  clarify \n16  what  you  have  to  what \n17  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  I'll put  it all-- I'll put  it \n18  on  the  record.  October  29,  2019,  caption my  mark  and \n19  special  reprisal  for  Sentence  Review  Division \n20  Hearing.  Then  October  29th  my  mark  and  Special \n21  reprisal  for  Sentence  Review  Hearing,  exhibits  one  to \n22  five.  My  mark  and  special  reprisal  for  Sentence \n23  Review  Hearing  and  it alsb  checks  habeas  9/17/19 \n24  transcript,  and  other  transcripts  from  June  6th,  11, \n25  9/3/13,  2/20/14,  and  April  17th  of  14.  And  with \n26  respect  to  that  we  do  have  those  transcripts  that \n27  were  all  referred  to. \n\n<1., \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 8 of 64\n5 \n1  And  then  there  is  a  final,  I  believe  case \n2  detail,  regarding  what  I  believe  is  a  habeas  matter \n3  pending  at  Rockville. \n4  THE  DEFENDANT:  You  have  a  case  detail?  That's \n5  not  submitted  by  me,  right? \n6  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Case  lookup.  I  think we  do \n7  this  as  part  of  our  review,  to  make  sure  that  there \n8  are  no  other  actions  pending,  which  might  put  off \n9  Sentence  Review.  Okay? \n10  So,  we  have  all  of  those. \n11  THE  DEFENDANT:  To  off  Sentence  Review? \n12  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Yeah,  sometimes  people  if they \n13  have  habeas  or  an  appeal,  they  wait  for  Sentence \n14  Review  because  if you  succeed  in  your  appeal  you \n15  don't  need  Sentence  Review.  Are  out  sill appealing \n16  and  taking  habeas  matters? \n17  THE  DEFENDANT:  No,  I  want  to  go  through  with \n18  the  Sentence  Review,  I  want  to  get  that  over  with. \n19  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay.  That's  fine.  So,  if \n20  you  would  please,  raise  your  right  hand. \n21  THE  DEFENDANT:  Umm,  at  this  point,  Your  Honor, \n22  could  I  get  the  handcuffs  removed,  maybe? \n23  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  No. \n24  THE  DEFENDANT:  And  umm,  I  have  some  preliminary \n25  paperwork  that  I  need  to  follow  up  and  submit  to  The \n26  Court  as  well. \n27  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  More  than  what  we  have? \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 9 of 64\n6 \n1  THE  DEFENDANT:  Yes,  yes. \n2  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  All  right.  Just  hand  it to \n3  Mr.  Brown  or  the  Marshal  and  he'll present  it to \n4  Court. \n5  THE  DEFENDANT:  Hey,  can  you  sign  that  for  me, \n6  it's  just  for  the  transcript  for  today.  All  right. \n7  And  now  I  want  to  submit  that. \n8  ATTY.  BROWN:  It's  just  a  transcript  request. \n9  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  All  right. \n10  THE  DEFENDANT:  That's  got  to  go  with  it.  Do \n11  you  know  the  names  of  these  three  Judges? \n12  ATTY.  BROWN:  I  do. \n13  THE  DEFENDANT:  Could.you  write  it down  on  a \n14  paper  for  me. \n15  ATTY.  BROWN:  Yeah. \n16  THE  DEFENDANT:  The  first  and  the  last. \n17  ATTY.  BROWN:  Yes. \n18  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  You're  calling  this  a  future \n19  proceeding,  but  what  I  understand,  Mr.  Young  is  you \n20  want  today's  transcript,  correct?  Because  it says \n21  future  proceeding,  but,  I  think  what  you're  asking \n22  for  is  the  transcript  from  today's  Sentence  Review, \n23  correct? \n24  THE  DEFENDANT:  You  mean  on  the  umm  - \n25  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  On  the  form. \n26  THE  DEFENDANT:  -- the  waiver? \n27  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Yeah. \n\n.....  ...  ...  .... \n. \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 10 of 64\n7 \n1  THE  DEFENDANT:  It  says  what  I  need  them  for. \n2  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay. \n3  THE  DEFENDANT:  For  future  proceedings. \n4  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  All  right. \n5  THE  DEFENDANT:  That's  right.  But,  the  umm \n6  the  umm,  the  actual  transcript  order  is  for  two \n7  days  I  believe,  right?  For  today  and  --\n8  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Today. \n9  THE  DEFENDANT:  -- a  date  in  June,  the  23rct,  I \n10  believe  2015. \n11  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Was  that  for  Sentence  Review \n12  also? \n13  THE  DEFENDANT:  Yeah,  yeah,  yes. \n14  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  It got  marked  off? \n15  THE  DEFENDANT:  I'm  not  sure  what  really \n16  happened,  I  didn't  -- I  didn't  actually  go  before  The \n~..L  ..I.,   Court  that \n18  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  All  right. \n19  THE  DEFENDANT:  All  right.  Here  I  am.  Where  am \n20  I?  We  got  that,  they  have  that.  They  have  that. \n21  Oh,  here  they  are.  All  right. \n}iccording  to  our \n22  JUDGE \n23  notes,  Mr.  Young,  on  June  23rct  of  2015,  the  video \n24  conference  was  canceled  by  Judge  Randolph,  as  you \n25  were  scheduled  in  a  Rockville  matter. \n26  Attorney  Joy  appeared  at  Sentence  Review  with  an \n27  oral  motion  to  withdraw,  with  no  State's  Attorney,  no \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 11 of 64\n8 \n1  Defendant  present.  The  motion  was  granted,  I  believe \n2  by  Judge  Randolph  and  a  new  attorney  was  assigned. \n3  The  reason,  although  it doesn't  appear  on  the  notes \n4  is  that,  I  believe,  you  were  probably  in  a  habeas \n5  matter  with  Attorney  Joy  for  ineffective,  is  that \n6  correct? \n7  THE  DEFENDANT:  No,  that's  all  inaccurate  as \n8  well. \n9  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay. \n10  THE  DEFENDANT:  But  are  what  you're  trying  to \n11  get  at  is,  there  was  no  hearings,  so  there's  no \n12  transcript  for  that  day? \n13  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  I  think  the  only  thing  that \n14  happened  was  that  Attorney  Joy  was  withdrawn  from  the \n15  case.  So,  you  were  not  here,  nothing  happened \n16  because  our  information  according  to  our  secretary \n17  was  that,  you  were  at  the  Rockville  Court  on  that \n18  day.  So,  I  don't  know  if anything  is  going  to  show \n19  up  in  our  transcript.  Does  that  make  sense? \n20  THE  DEFENDANT:  Well,  was  there  a  hearing  of  the \n21  motion  to  withdraw  --\n22  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  There  should  have  been. \n23  THE  DEFENDANT:  -- without  me  or  --\n24  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  There  should  have  been  a \n25  hearing  on  the  motion  to  withdraw,  so  do  you  want \n26  that  limited  transcript? \n27  THE  DEFENDANT:  Well,  that's  --that's what \n\n...  ...  ...  ... \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 12 of 64\n9 \n1  the \n2  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay. \n3  THE  DEFENDANT:  -- transcript  order  was \n4  referring  to  was  that  date  of  the \n5  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  June.  All  right. \n6  THE  DEFENDANT:  --Counsel's  motion  to  withdraw. \n7  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  So  what  I'll ask  The  Court \n8  Reporter,  and  I  will  sign  the  request  is  that,  we \n9  produce  a  transcript  from  June  23rct  of  2015,  and  of \n10  today's  proceedings. \n11  All  right.  With  respect  to  it,  I'm  going  to  put \n12  you  under  oath,  so  you  can  address  the  panel  on  what \n13  sentence  you  believe  is  the  appropriate  sentence. \n--~------~--------------------·----------~ \n14  And  that's  our  inquiry  today.  Okay? \n15  THE  DEFENDANT:  Okay,  Your  Honor,  but  just \n16  before  we  do  that,  I  do  have  a  preliminary matter  I'd \n17  like  to  bring  forward  and  file  with  The  Court  before \n18  we  start  the  actual  --\n19  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Does  it have  to  --\n20  THE  DEFENDANT:  -- Sentence  Review  part. \n21  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Does  it have  to  do  with \n')') \nL. L. \n23  THE  DEFENDANT:  Yes,  it does,  yes. \n24  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  What's  it called?  Because  we \n25  usually  don't  do  anything  preliminary  because  of  our \n26  limit  in  our  review.  What's  your--\n27  THE  DEFENDANT:  Well,  I  understand,  but  it's \n-------~-\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 13 of 64\n10 \n1  within  the  limit  -- the  limited  scope  of  this  review. \n2  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  What's  your  request? \n3  THE  DEFENDANT:  So  -- well  from  the  background \n4  there,  from  my  understanding,  your  flags  behind  you, \n5  you  all  are  not  recognized  in  International  Law  and \n6  are  in  fact  Pirate  Flags. \n7  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay. \nf\\5 \n8  THE  DEFENDANT:  Has  anything  attached  to  a  Title \nse.c..t;on \\ e>(  ~  --\n-\n9  4  U.S.C.  C1  or  C2  flag.  Them  gold  fringes \n10  manipulates  the  flag  under  Title  4  u.s.c.  3,  which \n11  carries  a  one  year  prison  term,  just  so  you  all  know. \n'ot.oR \n-\n12  The  gold  fringe  represents  Code  of  Law,  when  placed \n13  upon  Title  4  U.S.C.  flag.  The  fringe  is  a \n14  manipulation  that  suspends  The  Constitution. \n15  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  All  right. \n16  THE  DEFENDANT:  And  establishes  color  of  law. \n17  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Mr.  Young,  we'll  note  your \n18  objection  to  us  being  in  a  Courtroom with  those \n19  flags.  That  is  a  noted  objection  by  The  Court  to \n20  you  -- to  your  record  for  appearing  before  us  with \n21  those  flags.  You've  made  your  record  on  that.  Okay? \n22  THE  DEFENDANT:  Okay.  Could  I  continue? \n23  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Does  it still have  to  do  with \n24  the  flags  because  we're  very  familiar  with  that \n25  objection.  It will  be  overruled  because  again,  we're \n26  appearing  for  the  limited  purpose  of  reviewing  your \n27  sentence. \n\n......  ... :  ...  ... : \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 14 of 64\n11 \n1  THE  DEFENDANT:  Well,  I'm  just  trying  to  set  the \n2  record  straight  --\n3  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Right. \n4  THE  DEFENDANT:  -- to  when  I'm  going  to  need  it. \n5  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  And  that's-- that's  why  we \n6  noted  that  as  your  objection. \n7  THE·DEFENDANT:  Okay.  So,  may  I  continue,  Your \n8  Honor? \n9  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Is  the  other  objection  again \n10  to  the  Jurisdiction  of  The  Court  in  your  matter? \n11  THE  DEFENDANT:  I'm  just  trying  to  -- umm  - \n12  actually,  I'm  try~ng to  get  to  that  part,  but  I  don't \n13  believe  that  was  an  objections  to  the  jurisdiction  of \n14  Court. \n15  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  All  right.  And  you  don't  want \n16  to  submit  to  the  Jurisdiction  of  the  Court,  because \n17  as  you  claimed  your  documents,  that  you  are  factually \n18  innocent. \n19  THE  DEFENDANT:  I  don't  believe  that's  what  I \n20  was  saying  at  all. \n21  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  All  right.  So,  my  question  to \n22  you  is,  pretty straight  forward,  do  you  want  to \n23  appear  before  The  Court  in  light  of  all  of  your \n24  objections  to  have  your  sentence  reviewed?  If you  do \n25  then  we're  going  to  have  to  proceed,  if you  don't, \n26  then  your  objections  will  be  noted,  but  you  will  not \n27  go  forward  on  Sentence  Review. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 15 of 64\n12 \n1  THE  DEFENDANT:  But,  I  don't  believe  it's an \n2  objection,  Your  Honor.  I'd  just  like  to  clarify  for \n3  the  record. \n4  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay. \n5  THE  DEFENDANT:  Umm,  that  you  may  be \n6.  interpreting  it's in-- interpret  taking  it as  it's \n7  an  objection. \n8  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  But,  you  don't  have  an \n9  objection?  You're  just making  a  record? \n10  THE  DEFENDANT:  Not,  at  this  point  - \n11  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay. \n12  THE  DEFENDANT:  -- I  don't  have  an  objection  at \n13  this  point. \n14  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay. \n15  THE  DEFENDANT:  And  I  do  apologize  to  The \n16  Court  --\n17  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  No,  no  apologies  necessary. \n18  THE  DEFENDANT:  -- for  you  know,  umm,  your \n19  interpretation  that,  that's what  I  was  doing  at  that \n20  time. \n21  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  All  right. \n22  THE  DEFENDANT:  But  that's  not  what  I  was  doing, \n23  so  may  I  continue? \n24  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  You  can,  but  then  we  do  have \n25  to  move  to  the  argument  on  the  sentence. \n26  THE  DEFENDANT:  Okay.  So,  I'm  going  to  continue \n27  from  where  I  left  off. \n\n... :  ... :  ... : \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 16 of 64\n13 \n1  All  right.  Those  gold  -- gold  fringed  flags \n2  behind  -- that  utilize  the  color  of  State  Law,  and \n3  pretends  to  be  the  people's  American  Flag  there  are \n4  not  the  American  Flag  of  Peace.  It's a  pirate  flag, \n5  my  clear  warning  to  whom  and  what  I'm  about  to  do \n6  business  with  here. \n7  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  All  right. \n\"'ARM'<\" \n8  THE  DEFENDANT:  On  the  Regulation  260-10  states \nm7ts;,q, \n-\n9  that  the  gold  fringe  made be  used  only  on  regimental \n10  colors,  the  President's  Flag,  for  military  court-\n11  martial  or  for  the  flags  used  at  military  recruitment \n12  centers.  So,  now  with  that  said,  umm  -- The  Law  of \n13  The  Flag,  in  international  law  which  recognizes  --\n14  which  is  recognized  by  every  Nation  of  the  Planet  is \n15  defined  as  a  rule  to  the  effect  that  a  vessel  is  a \n16  part  of  the  territory of  which  the  Nation  whose  flags \n17  it flies. \n18  The  term  is  used  to  designate  the  right  under \n19  which  a  ship's  owner  who  sends  his  vessel  into  a \n20  foreign  port  gives  notice  by  his  flag  to  all who \n21  enter  into  contract  with.  The  ship  master  that  he \n22  intends  the  law  of  that  flag  to  regulate  those \n23  contracts  and  that  they must  either  submit  to  thereto \n24  its  operation  or  do  not  contract  with  him  or  his \n25  agent  at  all. \n26  So,  now  with  that  being  said,  obviously  The \n27  Court  has  indicated they  received my  Marque  and \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 17 of 64\n14 \n1  Special  Reprisal  for  The  Sentence  Review  Divisions \n2  Hearing  today,  which  you  did  indicate  that  you  had \n3  noticed  my  flag. \n4  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Yes. \n5  THE  DEFENDANT:  So,  you  notice  in my  flag,  my \n6  flag  does  not  fly  with  the  fringes  around  the  edges \n7  and  is  a  common  law  flag.  Therefore,  I  have  these \n8  separate  individual  contracts  that  I  would  like  to \n9  submit  to,  Your  Honor,  and  your  colleagues.  If  you \n10  would  like  to  review  them  and  had  any  questions,  I \n11  would  be  happy  to  answer  them. \n12  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Yup.  Marshal? \n13  THE  DEFENDANT:  So,  I  would  like  them  filed  for \n14  Sentence  Review  Record  as  well. \n15  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  All  right.  With  respect  to \n16  this,  Mr.  Young,  The  Court  cannot  enter  into  an \n17  agreement  with  you  as  it is  outlined.  The  Court  has \n18  both  Statutory  and  Constitutional  Obligations  to  The \n19  State  of  Connecticut  and  we  are  prohibited  in  our \n20  role  as  Judges  to  enter  into  an  agreement  that  you \n21  seek  to  present  to  The  Court  today. \n22  Do  the  fellow  Jurists  agree  with  that? \n23  JUDGE  WILLIAM:  Agreed. \n24  JUDGE  HADDEN:  Agreed. \n25  THE  DEFENDANT:  Okay.  So,  would  object  at  this \n26  point. \n27  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  That's  what  we  hear. \n\n.4.  4.  .  .4.  .4. \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 18 of 64\n15 \n1  THE  DEFENDANT:  And  take  exception  to  --\n2  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Yup. \n3  THE  DEFENDANT:  --I believe  that's  your  ruling? \n4  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  It  is \n5  THE  DEFENDANT:  Okay. \n6  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  --and that's  why  we  make  the \n7  ruling  so  you  can  have  the  objection  so  it is  noted \n8  on  our  Court  Record. \n9  THE  DEFENDANT:  Okay.  Now,  seeing  as  though \n10  that's  going  to  take  place-- with  that  taking  place \n11  then,  I  just have  a  short  informational  note  for  -~ \n12  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Yes,  please. \n13  THE  DEFENDANT:  -- this  Court  as  well. \n14  [as  read]  Under  my  patriotic  -- Patriotic Warrior \n15  status  devised  in  libertarian  approach  with  -- under \n16  this  Court's  Judicial  Clerk's  or  other  official's \n17  duties  and  sworn  on  oath  of  office  to  defend  The \n18  Constitution  of  The  United  States,  and  of  this  State \n19  in  question,  he  or  she  is  bound  by  this  Civil \n20  Contract  Filing,  yes  whether  or  not  he  or  she  has \n21  accepted  or  rejected  in  dishonor  and  returned  an \nsignature  is  not  required  to  make  these \noffici~l \nIn \n23  Color  of  Law  Presentment  legally binding  a-n--d-  good \n24  faith  party  agreement.  So,  umm  --\n25  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  All  right.  That  again  is \n26  overruled  by  this  Court  as  your  request  for  that \n27  agreement  is  denied.  Okay.  So,  your  objection  is \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 19 of 64\n16 \n1  noted. \n2  THE  DEFENDANT:  Okay.  And  very  briefly  here, \n3  Sounding  libel,  this  presentment  makes  The \n4  Constitution  and  The  Bill  of  Rights  Colorable  Law  in \n5  this  Court's  jurisdiction.  Drafted  this  way  both  are \n6  simply  contractual  provisions  that  can  be  and  are  in \n7  fact  enforced  by  me  in  this  Sentence  Review  Hearing. \n8  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  All  right. \n9  THE  DEFENDANT:  By  way  of  my  best  china \n10  submitted  to  box  The  Constitution,  whereby  The \n11  Constitution  Encompasses  the  Review  Court's  proper \n12  jurisdiction and  this  Review  Court's  jurisdiction \n13  encompasses  the  universal  -- the  Uniform  Commercial \n14  Code.  And  the  UCC  encompasses  contracts,  including \n15  the  Color  of  Law  Agreements  that  I  had  just \n16  submitted.  Yeah,  so  once  again  enable  to  use  my \n17  special  forces  of  top  secret  intelligence, \n18  eliminating  all  forms  of  Malicious  Law. \n19  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  If  I  can  inquire  of  Counsel  of \n20  Record,  has  Mr.  Young  ever  been  subject  to  a  54-56D \n21  examination  during  any  of  the  proceedings? \n22  ATTY.  PREVILLE:  Yes,  Your  Honor,  I  wasn't  the \n23  trial  attorney  that  tried  the  case,  but  there  was  a \n24  competency  ordered  between  the  rendering  of  verdict \n25  and  the  sentencing.  The  competency  evaluation  was \n26  submitted  and  the  representatives  from  Demus  found \n27  the  Defendant  competent  and  that's  when  the \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 20 of 64\n17 \n1  sentencing  proceeded. \n2  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Thank  you.  All  right.  Mr. \n3  Young,  you  have  made  your  record.  And  I  would  ask \n4  you  now  to  be  put  under  oath  for  the  purpose  of \n5  arguing  your  Sentence  Review.  All  right.  Please \n6  raise  your  right  hand. \n7  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Do  you  solemnly  swear  that  the \n8  evidence  you're  about  to  give  this  Court  will  be  the \n9  truth,  the  whole  truth  and  nothing  but  the  truth,  so \n10  help  you  God  or  under  penalty  of  perjury? \n11  THE  DEFENDANT:  I  do. \n12  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Thank  you.  State  your  name \n13  for  The  Court  Record. \n14  THE  DEFENDANT:  Michael  Young. \n15  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  All  right.  Mr.  Young,  at \n16  Sentence  Review,  one  of  three  things  can  result.  We \n17  can  leave  your  sentence  the  same,  we  could  increase \n18  your  sentence  to  the  Statutory Maximum,  and  we  could \n19  decrease  your  sentence.  Do  you  understand  that  those \n20  are  the  three  results  of  Sentence  Review? \n21  THE  DEFENDANT:  Absolutely. \nJUDGE  ALEXANDEE:  Do  you  wish  to  00  forward  with \n-'-\n23  Sentence  Review  today? \n24  THE  DEFENDANT:  I  do. \n25  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Has  anyone  forced  you  or \n26  threatened  you  to  go  forward? \n27  THE  DEFENDANT:  Absolutely  not. \n---~~-----------------------------------' \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 21 of 64\n18 \n1  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Has  anyone  promised  you  any \n2  specific  result? \n3  THE  DEFENDANT:  No,  they  haven't. \n4  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  And  do  you  need  any  time  to \n5  discuss  this  decision  with  Attorney  Brown? \n6  THE  DEFENDANT:  Ahh.  Not  the  decision,  no. \n7  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Do  you  need  to  discuss  ask \n8  him  for  some  advice  on  something  else? \n9.  THE  DEFENDANT:  I  would  like  to  maybe,  could  we \n10  get  a  ten minute  recess  to  maybe  discuss  some  of  what \n11  my  arguments  going  to  be  at  this  po{nt? \n12  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  I  can  give  you  about  five \n13  minutes,  which  I  think  is  enough  because  like  I  said \n14  we  have  a  very  limited  argument,  but  certainly we \n15  could  to  that. \n16  THE  DEFENDANT:  Umm. \n17  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  If  you'd  like  to  see  Mr. \n18  Brown. \n19  THE  DEFENDANT:  Well,  Your  Honor,  the  problem \n20  with  that  is  have  an  eight  page  brief  here.  So,  I \n21  think  it's going  to  take  that  five  minutes,  just  too \n22  even  -- to  read  the  brief  and  comprehend  where  I'm \n23  going  it,  before  I  can  even  ask  him  any  advice. \n24  That's  why  I  asked  for  maybe  ten  minutes. \n25  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay.  With  respect  to  this \n26  matter,  can  you  hold  on  one  minute? \n27  Go  off  the  record please. \n\n... \n.  . 4.  4.  4. \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 22 of 64\n19 \n1  Back  on  the  record. \n2  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  We  have  a  hard  break  at  1:00. \n3  This  Court  is  not  available  at  2:00,  but  there  is  one \n4  other  Judge  who  was  here  for  Sentence  Review  that \n5  might  be  able  to  actually  even  though  I  did  the \n6  preliminary  rulings,  they  would  hear  your  argument  on \n7  Sentence  Review.  Does  that make  sense? \n8  THE  DEFENDANT:  Well,  no,  Your  Honor,  I  could \n9  not  do  that  at  2:00. \n10  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Of  course  you  can. \ni: \n11  THE  DEFENDANT:  I  need  to  proceed  with  the  three \n12  of  you  up  there  at  this  point. \n13  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  No,  no  there  will  be  three \n14  Judges,  you  are  guaranteed  three  judges,  don't  worry \n15  about  that.  You  haven't  started  your  argument,  but  I \n16  also  need  to  know  that  Counselor  are  you  available  at \n17  2:00,  if this  continued  at  2:00? \n18  ATTY.  PREVILLE:  Yes,  Your  Honor,  I'm  available. \n19  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  And  IVJr.  Brown. \n20  ATTY.  BROWN:  I  can  be,  Your  Honor. \n21  THE  DEFENDANT:  But,  Your  Honor,  again  I  need  to \n22  proceed  with  the  Uuee  Judge  Panel  that  I  have  here \n23  that  I  started with. \n24  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  No,  we've  only  done \n25  preliminary matters.  You  haven't-- that's  why  I \n26  kept  asking  you  to  make  your  Sentence  Review  Argument \n27  because  at  this  point  you  haven't  started  and  so  I \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 23 of 64\n20 \n1  haven't  heard  as  to  the  argument  on  Sentence  Review \n2  yet. \n3  THE  DEFENDANT:  No,  I  understand,  but  then  it \n4  will  blow  my  whole  Preliminary  Procedure  out  the \n5  window,  if that  happens  that  way. \n6  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay.  And  what  way? \n7  THE  DEFENDANT:  If  I  proceed  with  another  panel \n8  after  2:00. \n9  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Why  would  it blow  it up? \n10  THE  DEFENDANT:  Because  I've  already \n11  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  And  I'm  using  your  terms,  but \n12  go  ahead. \n13  THE  DEFENDANT:  Because  I've  already  submitted \n14  my  Preliminary  Filings  with  Your  Honor  and  her  two \n15  colleagues. \n16  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay.  So,  you  want  the  one \n17  that  says  Joan  Alexander  to  have  a  different  Judges \n18  name,  is  that  what  you're  saying? \n19  THE  DEFENDANT:  Excuse  me,  I'm  being  confused. \n20  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay.  The  only  thing  that  you \n21  did  that  had  my  name  particularly,  was  that  you \n22  wanted  us  to  enter  an  agreement.  I  don't  --\n23  THE  DEFENDANT:  No,  there  were  two  other \n24  agreements  along  with  yours. \n25  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Right. \n26  THE  DEFENDANT:  For  your  colleagues. \n27  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Those  two  Judges  would  still \n\n...  ......  ... \n~ ..·   .. 4.  : \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 24 of 64\n21 \n1  be  here,  the  third  Judge \n2  All  right.  So,  the  third  Judge  is  not  available \n3  at  2:00  either.  So,  with  respect  to  this  matter  the \n4  other  option  you  have  is  instead  of  three  Judges,  you \n5  can  have  two  Judges.  It would  still be  the  two \n6  Judges  who  were  here  with  me  today,  but  I  would  not \n7  participate  in  the  final  decision  as  to  whether  your \n8  sentence  would  change. \n9  Would  you  like  to  proceed  with  two  of  the  three \n.10  Judges? \n11  THE  DEFENDANT:  No,  I  -- I  really wouldn't,  Your \n12  Honor. \n13  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay.  Then  we  --we're  going \n14  to  have  to  continue  the  matter.  And  I'm  not  doing \n15  this  to  force  your  decision  one  way  or  the  other. \n16  But,  again,  I  have  about  five  sentencings  that  I  have \n17  to  do  in  New  Britain  at  2:00  that  there  are  people \n18  waiting  to  be  heard  on  their  initial  sentences  that  I \n19  have  to  rule  on. \n20  So,  with  respect  to  it,  you  certainly  are \n21  welcome  to  meet  with  Mr.  Brown  and  go  over  that  eight \n22  page  brief.  If  you'd  like  to  submit  that  eight  p~gc \n23  brief,  we  will  read  it before  your  next  hearing \n24  that's  not  a  problem  at  all.  Because  as  you  know,  I \n25  already  read  wh~t you've  put  in  earlier because  we \n26  do  -- we  do  review  everything  up  front,  so  we \n27  understand  your  argument. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 25 of 64\n22 \n1  THE  DEFENDANT:  No,  I  think  that  you  do  have \n2  this  eight  page  brief.  It's the  Marque  and  Special \n3  Reprisal. \n4  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Oh,  then  --\n5  THE  DEFENDANT:  So,  it's already  submitted,  I \n6  think  we  went  through  that \n7  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Oh,  so  it's not  something \n8  different.  I  thought  you  had  something  in  addition. \n9  THE  DEFENDANT:  No,  what  I  had  in  addition  was \n10  the  Preliminary  Filings  that,  we  just  got  through. \n11  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Understood.  Yup. \n12  THE  DEFENDANT:  And  no  we're  going  to  start  on \n13  the  Sentence  Review  part. \n14  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay. \n15  THE  DEFENDANT:  I  needed  to  get  through  the \n16  Preliminary  Proceedings  first. \n17  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Got  it,  got  it. \n18  THE  DEFENDANT:  So  at  this  point,  Your  Honor, \n19  I'd -- could  I  just  consult  for \n20  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Of  course. \n21  DISCUSSION  OFF  RECORD  DEFENDANT  AND  HIS  ATTORNEY \n22  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Yes,  Mr.  Young? \n23  THE  DEFENDANT:  Okay.  So,  at  this  point,  Your \n24  Honor,  I'd like  to  reserve  my  right  to  make  that \n25  decision  till 2:00.  As  you  had  indicated the  other \n26  two  Justices  are  available. \n27  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Yes,  they  are. \n\n•... \n·  .4 ..  4.  4 ..·  \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 26 of 64\n23 \n1  THE  DEFENDANT:  You  will  not  be  available. \n2  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Correct. \n3  THE  DEFENDANT:  There  will  a  third  Judge  -- not \n4  as  a  replacement  is  not  available. \n5  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Correct. \n6  THE  DEFENDANT:  So,  at  this  point  I'd like  to \n7  reserve  my  right  to  make  that  decision  till 2:00, \n8  whether  I'm  going  to  ask  for  a  continuance  or  proceed \n9  with  the  other  two  Justices  -- that  way  it will  give \n,, \n10  me  time  to  consult  with  my  with  Attorney  Brown. \n;  ,t' \n,: tlo\"\"\\ \n11  /~~ ~•'Ms.  Preville,  did  you  want  to  be  heard? \n12  ~'~\"~;7 n ~.,(-..   ATTY.  PREVILLE:  With  all  due  respect,  Your \n•  \"41'1  . \n13  Honors,  I'd be  more  than  willing  to  stay  for  five  or \n14  ten minutes  if Mr.  Young  wants  to  speak  with  his \n15  Attorney  about  doing  it at  2:00.  What  I  would  be \n16  worried  about  is  waiting  until  2:00,  Mr.  Young  not \n17  making  a  decision,  and  then  being  out  of  the  office \n18  for  a  full  day. \n19  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  All  right. \n20  THE  DEFENDANT:  Your  Honor,  could  I  respond? \n21  JUDGE  ALEXAANDER:  Why  don't  we  give  you  ten \n22  minutes  thctt's  what  you \n23  THE  DEFENDANT:  But,  Your  Honor,  I've  been \n24  waiting  since  2015  to  now. \n25  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Yup. \n26  THE  DEFENDANT:  So,  I  don't  think  it's a--\n27  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Oh,  she's  just  saying  that \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 27 of 64\n24 \n1  she's  willing  to  accommodate  your  schedule  that's \n2  all. \n3  THE  DEFENDANT:  For  the  ten minutes,  she's \n4  objecting  to  me  making  a  decision  at  2:00. \n5  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Right  with  respect  to  it,  do· \n6  you  want  to  start with  ten  minutes,  or  we'll  bring \n7  you  back  out  or  do  you  want  to  wait  till 2:00. \n8  THE  DEFENDANT:  Well,  I'd  like  to  have  that  time \n9  till 2:00  to  consult  with  Attorney  Brown? \n10  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  So,  Marshals  is  the  lock-up \n11  open  between  one  and  two? \n12  THE  MARSHAL:  No. \n13  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  So,  Court  lock-ups  are  not \n14  open. \n15  THE  MARSHAL:  It's not  here  usually,  Your  Honor. \n16  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  No.  So,  Mr.  Brown's  not  going \n17  to  be  able  to  see  you  except  for  right  now  and  then \n18  . he  wouldn't  be  able  to  see  you  again  until  2:00.  So, \n19  he's  not  going  to  be  able  to  consult  with  you  again, \n20  it's  kind  of  a  hard  break.  Do  you  want  a  few  minutes \n21  right  now  here? \n22  THE  DEFENDANT:  Well,  I'll take  whatever,  Your \n23  Honor's  going  to  provide  me  this  morning. \n24  JUDGE  ALXENANDER:  Yeah,  why  don't  you  do  that \n25  right  now  and  then  again  we'll  get  a  quicker,  at \n26  least  feel,  for  what  you  want  to  do? \n27  ATTY.

BROWN:  Yes. \n23  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  for  the  preparing  of  the \n24  transcripts. \n25  And,  Mr.  Young,  did  you  want  a  continuance  or \n26  did  you  want  to  have  your  argument  at  2:00,  with  the \n27  two  judge  panel. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 29 of 64\n26 \n1  THE  DEFENDANT:  No,  Your  Honor,  I  would  like  you \n2  to  be  on  the  bench. \n3  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay.  So,  we'll  get  you  a \n4  continuance  date,  that's  fine. \n5  THE  DEFENDANT:  And  I  also  would  ask  that  you \n6  reappoint  a  different  Attorney. \n7  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay. \n8  THE  DEFENDANT:  As  there  is  a  severe  conflict \n9  here. \n10  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  So,  would  you  like  an  Attorney \n11  to  argue  for  you  or  do  you  just want  Standby  Counsel? \n12  THE  DEFENDANT:  No,  no,  no.  What  I  want  is  some \n13  Counsel  to  assist me  in  some  of my  questions  that  I \n14  had. \n15  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  All  right.  So,  with  respect \n16  to  Attorney  Brown,  would  you  agree  that  there  is  a \n17  breakdown  between  the  relationship  between  you  and \n18  Mr.  Young  at  this  point. \n19  ATTY.

BROWN:  I  would,  Your  Honor. \n24  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Motion  is  granted  based  on \n25  your  request,  Mr.  Young,  Mr.  Brown  will  no  longer \n26  represent  you.

We  do  not  have  Sentence \n2  Review  is  December,  but  we  do  have  Sentence  Review  in \n3  January,  so  I'm  going  to  docket  you  for  that.  Mr. \n4  Brown  can  you  please  let the  Office  of  Assigned \n5  Counsel  know  that  Mr.  Young  needs  Counsel  appointed \n6  and  they  should meet  with  him  before  -- what  date  is \n7  it in  January,  Madame  Clerk  or  Mr.  Clerk? \n8  THE  DEFENDANT:  You  know  what,  Your  Honor \n9  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Yeah? \n10  THE  DEFENDANT:  We'll  just  cut  to  the  chase \n11  here,  and  I  will  come  back  at  2:00,  and  I  will  argue \n12  in  front  of  the  other  two  Gentlemen. \n13  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  You  know  what  you-- I'd \n14  rather  have  you,  once  a  person,  and  I'm  just \n15  following  the  law,  once  a  person  says  they  want  to \n16  consult  with  a  lawyer,  I  don't  take  that  lightly.  I \n17  really  think  you  should  consult  with  a  lawyer  because \n18  of  the  possible  risk  that  you  could  receive  an \n19  increase  of  sentence. \n20  THE  DEFENDANT:  Yeah,  yeah. \n21  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  That  is  one  of  the  outcomes, \n22  so,  you  need  --\n23  THE  DEFENDANT:  But,  Your  Honor,  I'd like  to  get \n24  this  over  and  done  with  today,  and  just move  on.

The \n26  record  is  established  the  way  I  need  it to  be \n27  established,  therefore,  I  would  like  to  come  back  at \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 31 of 64\n28 \n1  2:00,  and  proceed  with  the  other  two  Gentlemen  and \n2  finish  this  up  and  get  a  decision. \n3  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Just  the  two  judge  panel  and \n4  you  are  going  to  proceed  without  Mr.  Brown  assisting \n5  you,  and  you  are  withdrawing  your  request  to  have  an \n6  Attorney  assist  you? \n7  THE  DEFENDANT:  I'm  not  addressing  that  matter, \n8  I'm  just \n9  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay. \n10  THE  DEFENDANT:  -- stating  for  the  record  that \n11  I'm  here  to  fulfill my  obligations  today. \n12  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Now  --\n13  THE  DEFENDANT:  -- and  I  would  like  to  do  that \n14  at  2:00  and  --\n15  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  See,  you  have  to  answer  yes  or \n16  no.  You  initially told me  that  you  want  another \n17  lawyer.  Okay? \n18  THE  DEFENDANT:  Well  that  was  because  of  the \n19  fact  that  I  did  get  a  ten minute  break  to  go  and \n20  discuss  the  brief with  Attorney  Brown,  and  he  wanted \n21  to  talk  about  everything  else,  under  the  sun,  but \n22  that.  Therefore,  I  saw  that  I  was  going  to  get \n23  nowhere,  and  therefore  proceeded  back  in  here,  to \n24  make  my  request  to  the  Court. \n25  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay. \n26  THE  DEFENDANT:  And  at  this  point  again,  I  would \n27  state  for  the  record,  and  make  the  record  clear,  that \n\n'  . 4. :  '  . 4. :  '  . 4, \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 32 of 64\n29 \n1  I  would  like  to  comeback  2:00,  and  finish  up  my \n2  argument-- and- so  I'll start my  argument  with  the \n3  Review  Board  and  the  panel  of  two  judges,  and  then \n4  have  them  issue  a  decision  as  expeditious  as \n5  possible. \n6  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  .And  do  you  wish  to  have  an \n7  Attorney  assist  you  in  this  matter,  yes  or  no? \n8  THE  DEFENDANT:  Well,  I'm  going  to  let  the \n9  record  reflect  for  itself. \n10  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay.  Then  you're  not  getting \n11  a  continuance  till two  because  you  have  to  tell me  if \n12  you  want  a  lawyer  or  not.  Your  last  statement  to  the \n13  panel  was  that  you  wanted  an  Attorney  assigned  to  the \n14  case  because  you  haven't  changed  that  request,  your \n15  request  for  2:00  is  going  to  have  to  be  denied. \n16  THE  DEFENDANT:  But,  Your  Honor,  my  request  for \n1  '7  Counsel  to  assist  me  in  some  questions& \n..L/ \n18  THE  COURT:  Right. \n19  THE  DEFENDANT:  That  was  what  the  whole  matter \n20  was  about,  and  he  refused  to  assist  me  in  the \n21  assistance  of  the  a  --\n22  JUDGE  ALEANDEER:  All  Liyhl.  So,  -L1-I-J- \n23  get  you  --\n24  THE  DEFENDANT:  -- questions. \n25  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  -- a  different  Attorney,  who \n26  will  answer  your  questions. \n27  THE  DEFENDANT:  But,  I  have  no  questions  at  this \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 33 of 64\n30 \n1  point  for  any  Attorney,  Your  Honor. \n2  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay.  Well,  with  respect  to \n3  the  -- then  do  you  need  an  Attorney? \n4  THE  DEFENDANT:  I  was  under  the  assumption,  I \n5  was  here  to  argue  my  matter  myself  today. \nJUDGE  ALEXANDER:  All  right.  And  --\n6 \nTHE  DEFENDANT:  They've  had  plenty  of  time  to \n7 \n8  assist me  from  2015  until,  I  believe  its  November  26, \n9  2019. \n10  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Okay. \n11  THE  DEFENDANT:  And  they  haven't  done  it yet, \n12  and  quite  frankly,  Your  Honor,  you  given  me  a  short \n13  continuance  for  a  month  or  two  to  get  an  appointed \n14  attorney  to  assist  me,  it's not  going  to  happen, \n15  therefore,  again,  I'd like  to  make  the  record  reflect \n16  that  I'd like  to  proceed  at  2:00  with  my  oral \n17  argument  for  the  umm  --\n18  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  Don't  be  --\n19  THE  DEFENDANT:  -- other  two  members  of  the \n20  Panel. \n21  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  don't  be  thinking  that  you \n22  wouldn't  have  an  attorney  with  you  because  I  would \n23  assure  you  that  The  Court  would  have  an  appointed \n24  Attorney  for  you.  And  so,  I  need  you  to \n25  unequivocally  state  that  you  do  not  want  an  Attorney, \n26  is  that  correct? \n27  THE  DEFENDANT:  No,  but  -- but,  Your  Honor  --\n\n... \n.  . \n~.  ~ \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 34 of 64\n31 \n1  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  No  that  -- you  have  to  answer \n2  that  question.  Do  you  want  an  Attorney,  yes  or  no? \n3  THE  DEFENDANT:  But,  now  if I  --\n4  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  No,  it's a  yes  or  no.  Do  you \n5  want  an  Attorney? \n6  THE  DEFENDANT:  Well,  the  thing  is  --\n7  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  And  I'm not  -- I'm  not  -- I \n8  need  to make  a  record.  So,  this  is  the  only  question \n9  that's  very  important  right  now.  Do  you  want  an \n10  Attorney,  yes  or  no? \n11  THE  DEFENDANT:  No,  I  would  rather  come  back  at \n12  2:00,  give  my  oral  argument  to  the  two  judge  panel, \n13  then  they  could  issue  their decision. \n14  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  All  right.  So,  you  --\n15  THE  DEFENDANT:  Without  no  further  inadequate, \n16  inordinate  delay. \n17  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  All  right.  So,  you  do  not \n18  want  an  Attorney,  correct? \n19  THE  DEFENDANT:  Absolutely,  at  this  point,  I \n20  don't  need  an  Attorney,  Your  Honor. \n21  THE  COURT:  That's  what  I  needed  you  to  say. \n/'2  2:00  and  you  can  proceed  with  your  argument.  You  are \n23  agreeing  to  a  two  judge  panel,  who've  been  who've \n24  been  here  for  the  whole  proceeding.  Okay? \n25  THE  DEFENDANT:  Fine,  Your  Honor. \n26  JUDGE  ALEXANDER:  All  right.  Very  good.  See \n27  you  at  2:00.

It's your  burden  to  show  that  the  challenged \n13  sentence  is  inappropriate  or  disproportionate  in  some \n14  way  as  defined  in  Section  43-28  of  The  Practice  Book. \n15  We  will  first  hear  from  you,  the  moving  party.  We \n16  will  then  hear  from  The  State  and  anyone  on  behalf  of \n17  any  victim who  wishes  to  be  heard.  And  then  after \n18  that,  Judge  Hadden  and  I  will  discuss  the  record  and \n19  the  arguments  made  and  we  will  issue  a  written \n20  ruling.

Do  you  understand  that  those  are  three \n7  possibilities  as  a  result  of  this  hearing? \n8  THE  DEFENDANT:  Yes. \n9  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  Thank  you,  Judge  Hadden,  I \n10  appreciate  that.  Thank  you,  Sir,  you  may  go  right \n11  ahead. \n12  THE  DEFENDANT:  Could  umm,  by  any  chance  I  could \n13  have  the  handcuffs  removed? \n14  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  No,  Sir. \n15  THE  DEFENDANT:  So,  just before  I  begin,  I  think \n16  I  had  overheard,  Judge  Alexander  state  that  the \n17  previous  documents  that  I  had  requested  in  2015  that \n,18  she  had  a  copy  of  the  brief  of  actual  innocence  that \n19  was  before  the  Trial  Court  on  the  Sentencing  Date, \n20  along  with  a  Post-Conviction  Motion  to  dismiss,  and  a \n21  Motion  for  a  new  trial.  So,  I  just  wanted  to  clarify \n22  that  them  documents  are  properly  submitted  and  umm \n23  before  I  begin.  Because  I  will  be  beginning  with \n24  opening  questions. \n25  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  Please  do  go  ahead  with  your \n26  argument,  Sir,  Judge  Alexander  appropriated  addressed \n27  after  giving  you  plenty  of  time,  she  addressed,  she \n\n....  ... \n· \n4.

So,  please  go  right  ahead. \n3  THE  DEFENDANT:  But  I  just want  to  make  sure \n4  that  it's in  the  record. \n5  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  What  is  it now  that  you're \n6  asking  to  verify  is  already  in  the  record,  Sir? \n7  THE  DEFENDANT:  Well,  I'm  going  to  give  you  an \n8  argument  on  - based  on  them  documents.  But,  I'm  not \n9  under  the  assumption \n10  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  What  is  the  document  you're \n11  asking  us  to  verify  what  we  have? \n12  THE  DEFENDANT:  A  Brief  of  Actual  Innocence,  A \n13  Post-Conviction  Motion  to  Dismiss,  and  a  Motion  for  a \n14  New  Trial  that  was  before  the  Trial  Court  at  the  time \n15  of  sentencing. \n16  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  Do  you  have  one  there  dated, \n17  Sir? \n18  THE  DEFENDANT:  No,  these  documents  I  asked  to \n19  be  submitted back  in  2015,  so  I  don't  have  a  copy  of \n20  any  of  them  documents  any  more. \n21  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  I've  got  a  set  of  Post-\n22  Conviction,  a  transcrip~ of  Post-Conviction  Motions \n23  dated  February  20,  2014,  in  front  of  Judge  Kwak,  is \n24  that  what  you're  referencing,  Sir. \n25  THE  DEFENDANT:  Not  a  transcript.  No,  no,  no, \n26  no.  It's a  Brief  in  Support  of  my  Actual  Innocence, \n27  it's a  handwritten  Brief.

Two  separate \n3  motions  that  I  asked  be  submitted  back  in  2015  to  The \n4  Review  Court. \n5  JUDGE  HADDEN:  Mr.  Young,  let me  ask  you  this, \n6  the  brief  that  you  submitted,  which  outlines  your \n7  argument  that  you  were  not  guilty  of  these  offenses, \n8  is  that  correct? \n9  THE  DEFENDANT:  There  was  two  separate  --\n10  JUDGE  HADDEN:  Does  the  brief  argue  that  you \n11  were  not  factually  guilty  of  these  offenses?  Is  that \n12  what  the  brief  contains? \n13  THE  DEFENDANT:  Are  you  a \n14  JUDGE  HADDEN:  That  would  be  a  yes  or  no  answer. \n15  THE  DEFENDANT:  I'm  confused. \n16  JUDGE  HADDEN:  It's a  very  simple  question,  the \n17  brief  that  you're  referring  to,  is  that  a  brief  in \n18  which  you  presented  to  Judge  Kwak  an  argument  that \n19  you  were  factually  innocent? \n20  THE  DEFENDANT:  Absolutely,  yes,  Sir. \n21  JUDGE  HADDEN:  That  is  not  relevant  to  this \n22  Panel.  Please  proceed  with  your  argument. \n23  THE  DEFENDANT:  But  it is. \n24  JUDGE  HADDEN:  It is  not  relevant  to  this  Panel, \n25  please  proceed  with  your  argument. \n26  THE  DEFENDANT:  So,  I. take  it objection  to  that, \n27  and  want  to  reserve  it. \n\n.....  ...  ......  ...... \n.  . \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 40 of 64\n37 \n1  JUDGE  HADDEN:  That's  fine.  So  noted. \n2  THE  DEFENDANT:  So,  umm  -- just  give  me  a  minute \n3  to  shift  gears  here,  okay? \n4  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  Certainly. \n5  THE  DEFENDANT:  All  right.  Well,  I  guess  we'll \n6  go  about  it this  way  then.  All  right.  So,  although \n7  reservation  of  my  rights  to  appeal  my  actual \n8  innocence  is  documented  at  the  four  transcript \n9  4/17/14  at  page  one  through  four,  which  are  in \n10  reference  to  them  documents  that  we  just  had  a \n11  discussion  about,  there.was  no  proper  procedural \n·•\" :tt-l At.COR.l;).~~(.t ~~ \n12  requirements  ever  taken  -an-d -ac-co-rd-in-g  to  Connecticut \n13  Practice  Book,  Chapter  73  provisions,  to  effectuate \n14  that  granted  request. \n15  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  I  am  going  to  allow  you  to  go \n16  forward,  but  I  am  redirecting  you  now  for  the  first \n17  time,  as  to  the  limited  scope  of  this  Panel's \n18  THE  DEFENDANT:  But,  I  believe  this  is  --\n19  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  Whether  the  sentence  imposed \n20  was  inappropriate  or  disproportionate  that  is  what \n21  this  hearing  is  for. \n22  THE  DEFENDANT:  This  all  -- all  pertains  to \n23  that. \n24  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  Anything  else  is  not  relevant, \n25  go  ahead. \n26  THE  DEFENDANT:  This  pertains  to  that,  so  you \n27  could  disregard  whatever  you  want  to  disregard,  but \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 41 of 64\n38 \n1  I'm  going  to  make  the  record  reflect  what  I  need  it \n2  to  reflect. \n3  JUDGE  HADDEN:  As  long  as  it has  to  do  with \n4  whether  your  sentence  was  inappropriate  or \n5  disproportionate  --\n6  THE  DEFENDANT:  Absolutely. \n7  JUDGE  HADDEN:  -- that  is  all we're  dealing \n8  with. \n9  THE  DEFENDANT:  Absolutely.  It all  pertains. \n10  JUDGE  HADDEN:  Carry  on. \n11  THE  DEFENDANT:  Okay.  So,  oh  there  was  no \n12  proper  procedural  requirements  ever  taken  in \n13  accordance  with  Connecticut  Practice  Book  73 \n14  provisions  to  effectuate  that  granted  request.  Now \n15  these  were  requests  were  just prior  to me  being \n\"\\\" - ~t\":\"  \\ .l\"'lF\" I  1 J \n\\li.-b./L.. \n16  sentenced.

I  was  requesting \n23  to  arrest  the  Judgement,  but  he  never  brought  that  to \n24  the  attention  of  The  Trial  Court  at  that  point.  Due \n25  to  the  fact  that  they  had  a  discussion  without  my \n26  presence  in  Chambers  prior  to  this  sentencing. \n27  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  Sir,  again,  while  I  will  let \n\n...  .....  ...  .. \n· ... ·  .... \nCase 3:20-cv·--00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 42 of 64\n:. \n39 \n1  you  continue,  The  Panel  redirects  you  to  its  limited \n2  scope  of  review  under  Sections  43-28  of  The  Practice \n\"'',',  :cI I  \n3  Book.  {1/1 \n~ta) ., • ...,. \n4  THE  DEFENDANT:  And  this .i...s... n't --\n5  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  Carry  on. \n6  THE  DEFENDANT:  -- in  limited  scope  because  this \n7  is  out  of  the  transcript  of  4/17,  which  is my \n8  sentencing  transcript. \n9  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  Go  ahead. \n10  THE  DEFENDANT:  So,  that's  another  intentional \nG\\f\\ \n-\n11  violation  of  due  process  in my  equal  protection \n12  rights. \n13  JUDGE  HADDEN:  Sir,  those  are  claims  that  have \n14  to  be  made  on  appeal  or  a  habeas.

In  this \n11  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  For  which  crime  are  you  saying \n12  you  received  a  sentence  greater  than  a  Statutory \n13  Maximum? \n14  THE  DEFENDANT:  We're  going  to  get  to  that  when \n15  I  get  through  --\n16  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  I  am  asking  right  now?  For \n17  which  crime  that  you  were  convicted  did  you  receive  a \n18  sentence  greater  than  the  maximum? \n19  THE  DEFENDANT:  I've  been  sentence  in  violation \n20  of  Double  Jeopardy  Clause.  Umm  --\n21  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  That  wasn't  my  question.  You \n22  said  you  received  a  sentence  greater  than  the \n23  Statutory Maximum,  which  this  Panel  notes,  could  be \n24  addressed  through  a  correction  of  an  illegal \n25  sentence. \n26  We're  here  for  Sentence  Review,  but  for  clarity \n27  of  the  record,  since  this  Panel  was  to  determine \n\n...•. \n... \n... 4. :  : \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 44 of 64\n41 \n1  whether  a  sentence  was  inappropriate  or \n2  disproportionate,  which  sentence  did  you  receive  that \n3  was  greater  than  a  Statutory Maximum?  That's  the \n4  question  from  the  Panel. \n5  THE  DEFENDANT:  The  Enhancement  Sentence.  There \n6  was  no  arguable  compo  -- competent  arguable \n7  jurisdiction  for  the  Enhancement  Sentences  that  I  had \n8  received.  And  I  will  get  to  that,  it's in  this \n9  argument.  And  I  will  clarify that  for  the  record  for \n10  both  of  you.  .. \n... \n11  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  Please  do,  go  ahead.  Go  ahead. \n12  THE  DEFENDANT:  Again,  I'll pick  up  where  I  left \n13  off.  This  imposition  of  over  the  max  sentence  was \n14  again  impermissibly  enhanced  to  penalize  me  for \n15  exercising my  Constitutional  Right  to  Trial.  See \n16  United  States  verses  Cruz,  977  F  2nd,  732,733  through \n17  4 \n0 \n18  Also,  in  accordance  with  U.S.  Supreme  President \n\\:: \n\"''K~AJt'l  11 \n19  the  Criminal  Court~- Trial  Court,  KK  was  prohibited \n20  from  imposing  Connecticut  General  Statute  53a-40b, \n21  sentences  based  on  both  Unconstitutional  Prior \n22  Convictions.  See  U.S.  verses  Tucker  404  U.S.  443, \n23  447.  So,  I  think  I'm  explaining  that  right  there. \n24  All  right?  He  was  prohibited  from  imposing  The \n25  Connecticut  General  Statute  53a-40B  sentences.  Based \n26  on  the  two  prior  Unconstitutional  convictions  in \n27  JUDGE  HADDEN:  Sir,  you  were  convicted  of \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 45 of 64\n42 \n\\  % \\ \n1  being  -- and  had  your  sentence  enhanced  because  you \n2  were  convicted  of  crimes  while  released  on  Bond.

You're \n7  mistaken. \n8  THE  DEFENDANT:  The  enhancement  was  in  a \n9  subsequent  prosecution.  It wasn't  in  the  same \n10  prosecution. \n11  JUDGE  HADDEN:  No,  you're  wrong  about  that  as \n12  well. \n13  THE  DEFENDANT:  Well,  clearly  several \n14  Unconstitutional  Deterrent  Sentences  all  imposed  in \na' \n.,.. • ~-\\ 1·-\\\"'\\ ~~ \\ q ... \n15  spite  at  Patient  19  through  21.

Which  is  two  months  prior  to  the  sentencing. \n2  Right  of  multiple  State  insufficient  information \n3  drafts  in  fatal  defective  variance  filings.  See  U.S. \n4  verses  Miller  263  F3D,  1  and  4.  Yeah,  so  along  with \nn LJN Lo~R.E'c.\"Gt/1 \n5  the  PSI  and  Prosecutorial  lies  in  deceit  at  the \n6  sentencing  4-17-14,  page  4  through  14.  So  now  if you \n7  look  at  4  through  14  he  goes  through  the  PSI  --\n. \nWJV:t\\~6 \n8  what'd  directed  in  the  PSI  the  inaccurate  information \n9  that's  in  the  PSI  is  what  I'm  talking  about  there. \nEqu\\vO\\\\\\.l\\\"t 1- o ~ ~~~t..GA'~'t \n10  Let  be  noted,  he  goes  into  a  -- bar  is  my \n~~~~~ \n11  contractional  no  plea  entry  to  the  subject  matter \n12  jurisdiction and  personal  jurisdiction  and  contract \n13  is  law  of  the  case,  on  this  subsequent  prosecution  at \n14  9-3-13.  So,  now  that's  the  part  B  that  we  just \n15  discussed  that  you  said  I  was  inaccurate  on,  which \n16  I'm  not  inaccurate  on.  The  Part  B  there  was  no  plea \n17  ever  entered  to  the  Part  B  Information,  and  that  is \n18  committing  while  allegedly  committing  while  on \n19  release.  So  again  there  was  never  no  pleas  ever \n20  taken  on  that  -- on  that  charge. \n21  So,  now  you've  got  me  all  confused  telling me \n22  that  I'm wrong  when  I'm  not  wrong  there. \n23  JUDGE  HADDEN:  Sir,  the  Enhancement  Statute  that \n24  you  were  convicted  on  is  based  upon  you're  being \n25  convicted  of  a  crime  while  released  on  bond.  You \n26  argue  that  you  -- that  your  Enhancement  Statute  had \n27  to  do  with  prior  criminal  convictions  that's  all  I \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 47 of 64\n44 \n1  pointed out  to  you  and  I  am  correct  about  that. \n2  THE  DEFENDANT:  But,  but  listen -- the  prior \n3  criminal  convictions  are  the  convictions  we're  here \n4  today  for. \n5  JUDGE  HADDEN:  Those  are  not  prior  criminal \n6  convictions  those  are  the  convictions  in  this  case. \n7  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  Unless  we  stray too  far  the \n8  Panel  --\n9  THE  DEFENDANT:  But,  but,  Your  Honor,  we  have,  I \n10  think  you're  confused \n11  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  -- refers  you  again \n12  THE  DEFENDANT:  -- we  had  two \n13  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  Sir,  we  need  a  clear  record, \n14  which  means  we  cannot  be  interrupted.  The  Panel \n15  refers  you  again  to  Section  43-28  of  The  Practice \n16  Book \n17  THE  DEFENDANT:  Right  we  had  two  subsequent \n18  prosecutions  -- we  had  two  separate  prosecutions \n19  here. \n20  JUDGE  HADDEN:  Sir  - Sir  --\n21  THE  DEFENDANT:  It  didn't  happen  in  one  trial, \n22  it happened  in  two  trials,  Your  Honor. \n23  JUDGE  HADDEN:  Sir,  we  are  here  to  review  the \n24  sentence  you  received  after being  convicted.  The \n25  sentence  that  Judge  Kwak  imposed.  That  is  the  only \n26  thing  that  this  Panel  has  jurisdiction  over.  The \n27  sentence  -- the  sentence  that  was  imposed  in  that \n\n.... \n'  .  . 4,  ' \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 48 of 64\n45 \n1  case.  Nothing  else  can  be  heard  by  this  Panel.  Your \n2  claims  have  to  do  with  Appellate  issues,  your  claims \n3  may  have  something  to  do  with  a  Habeas  issue,  but \n4  they  have  nothing  to  do  with  the  sentence. \n5  So,  please  restrict  your  argument  to  the  issue \n6  of  whether  or  not  the  s~ntence imposed  by  Judge  Kwak \n7  was  disproportionate  or  inappropriate. \n8  THE  DEFENDANT:  It .wasn't  appropriate. \n9  JUDGE  HADDEN:  Tell  us  why. \n10  THE  DEFENDANT:  I  have  been  explaining  --\n11  JUDGE  HADDEN:  No,  you  haven't  yet.  You  haven't \n12  touched  on  it. \n13  THE  DEFENDANT:  Okay.  I'm  telling  you  right \n14  here  that  there  was  never  no  plea  to  these \n15  Enhancements. \n16  JUDGE  HADDEN:  What  does  that  have  to  do  with \n17  the  sentence,  Sir? \n18  THE  DEFENDANT:  Huh? \n19  JUDGE  HADDEN:  Sir,  the  sentence  --\n20  THE  DEFENDANT:  There's  no  competent  argue--\n21  JUDGE  HADDEN:  I'm  not  here  --\n22  THE  DEFENDANT:  over  who's  jurisdiction \n23  JUDGE  HADDEN:  -- this  Panel  --\n24  THE  DEFENDANT:  -- to  sentence  me  on  the \n25  Enhancement,  Your  Honor. \n26  JUDGE  HADDEN:  this  Pa~el -- Sir,  please, \n27  this  Panel  cannot  make  a  ruling  regarding  the \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 49 of 64\n46 \n1  procedures  that  were  followed  prior  to  your \n2  conviction. \n3  THE  DEFENDANT:  What  about  illegally filed. \n4  JUDGE  HADDEN:  Sir,  the  only  issue  before  us,  is \n5  the  sentence.  It's as  simple  as  that.  So,  please \n6  restrict  your  argument  to  the  sentence  and  what  you \n7  believe makes  it disproportionate  or  inappropriate. \n:r:.N \n8  THE  DEFENDANT:  Well,  it was  all  done  -- .a-n-d- \n9  further  obvious  intentional  stage  set  manipulation  of \n10  the  accurate  record.  In  promotion  of  the  attempted \n~~~ \n11  murder  called  cover-up,  okay?  So,  with  no  prior \n12  advance  notice  being  provided  to  me  for  these \n13  Enhancements,  in  violation  of  Connecticut  General \n(b) \n-\n14  Statute  54-64ed  sub  section  4.  And  without  the \n15  appropriate  sufficient  information  filing,  another \nc..  s. \nGr. \n16  violation  of  Connecticut  54-62,  also  see,  U.S.  verses \n17  Valentine,  21  Federal  3D,  at  395;  After  K.K.  case \ny \ntn \n-\n18  which  is  Judge  Kwak  factual  confused  conclusion  and \n--\n~.~ ~ t.t:' ~ f\\ \n19  tactical  maneuver  of  lying  deceit  at  4-17-14 \n20  Transcript  page  16.  Okay  because  there,  at  page  16, \n21  what  he  says  -- okay  page  16,  I'm  going  to  start \n22  at  line  5.  On  May  lOth,  2011,  the  police  were \n23  dispatched  to  the  Offender's  home,  for  a  domestic \n24  violence  complaint.  According  to  the  complaintant, \n25  Jessica  Reed,  Mr.  Young  assaulted  and  strangled  her. \n26  Mr.  Young  was  also  charged  with  Interfering With  an \n27  Officer;  and  two  counts  of Assault  on  a  Police \n\n... \n.4.  4. : \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 50 of 64\n47 \n1  Officer,  as  well  as,  threatening  in  the  2nd  Degree \n2  and  Reckless  Endangerment  in  the  1st  Degree  that's \n3  inaccurate  information  right  there  because  I  was  only \n4  charged  on  May  10,  2011,  with  one  count  of  Assault  on \n5  a  Police  Officer  and  I  was  found  not  guilty  on  that \n6  count  that  was  count  3. \n7  So,  again,  when  I  tried  in  the  February \n8  Transcript,  page  6  through  8,  I  believe  it was, \n9  trying  to  challenge  this  information,  filing  prior  to \n10  sentencing,  Judge  Kwak  refused.  Then  when  he \n11  sentences  me,  he  puts  inaccurate  information  here \n12  that  -- manipulating  the  accurate  record  that  --\n13  because  I  was  only  charged  on  May  10,  2011,  with  one \n14  count  of  Assault  on  a  Police  Officer.  And  again,  I \n15  will  specify  and  clarify  for  the  record,  I've  been \n16  found  not  guilty  of  that  charge.  So  it wasn't  two, \n17  it was  only  one  on  May  lOili \n18  But  I'll give  him  a  reluctant  benefit  at  the \n19  very  lease  -- Criminal  Kwak  Trial  Court,  KK  was \n20  mistaken  in  believing  State's  Legislative  Branch  had \n21  authorized  any  consecutive  sentences  in  the \n22  circumstances  of  this  case.  Because  here  I  am, \n·~Noo~'Q.rtotYll'1'11 \n23  convicted  of  two  offenses  on  an  Assault  on  a  Police \n24  Office,  and  Interfering  on  a  Police  Officer.  Them \n25  are,  the  only  two  charges  I  was  convicted  of,  prior \n\"' 5 u~s EG JJE~\\i'T11 \n26  to  the  Substitute  Prosecution  on  the  Enhancements, \n27  okay? \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 51 of 64\n48 \n1  So  at  the  very  least  he  was  mistaken  in \n2  believing  that  The  State's  Legislative  Branch,  had \n3  authorized  consecutive  senten~es in  the  circumstances \n4  of  what  I  just  told  you.  And  that  error  has  imposed \n5  a  consecutive  -- no,  a  constructive  denial  of  my \n6  right  to  be  deprived  of  my  liberty as  punishment  for \n7  alleged  criminal  conduct  only  to  the  extent \n8  authorized  by  The  Connecticut  Legislator.  He  over \n9  exceed  his  sentencing  authority,  when  he  did  that. \n10  It  is my  contention  that  these  sentences  for \n11  Interfering,  Connecticut  General  Statute  53a-167a  and \n12  the  prejudicial  surprising  untimely  now,  State's \n13  nonexistent  and  mean  to  specify,  nonexistent  Felony \n14  Assault,  Connecticut  General  Statutes  53a-\n15  167 (c)  (a)  (1).  See  transcript  4/17/14,  page  9  and  10. \n16  So,  if you  go  to  9  and  10,  The  State  concedes \n17  bkay,  9  and  10  concedes  that  there  was  no  injury  to \n18  no  Officer.  I'll start  on  page  9  at  line  22.  And \n19  here  this  is  Th~ Prosecutor  now  speaking,  and  here  we \n20  have  a  very  serious  charge  of  Assault  on  a  Police \n21  Officer,  which  carries  a  10  year  sentence.  But,  the \n22  injury  here  was  almost  nonexistent.  It's an  issue  of \n23  pain,  which  is  the  threshold  for  the  element  of  the \n24  Statute.  So,  now,  he's  conceded  right  there,  that's \n25  the  threshold  that's  the  threshold~- okay,  of  one \n26  of  the  elements.  Okay.  But,  we're  not  suggesting--\n27  I'm  going  to  go  on,  20  --this is  line  27,  but  we're \n\n..... \n;,,  6. \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 52 of 64\n49 \n1  not  suggesting  it was  anything more  than  that  with \n2  Trooper  Barrows.  He  was  kicked.  He  indicated,  he \n3  was  taking  a  back  and  it hurt,  but,  it.was  nothing \n4  more  than  that.  So,  taking  that  in  isolation,  it's \n5  not  a  case  that merits  a  lengthy  jail sentence.  Them \n6  are  The  Prosecutors  spoken  words  at  sentencing;  to \n7  that  charge  that  I  was  unlawfully  convicted  and  I \n8  will  tell you  why  in  a  little bit  further  in my \n9  argument  here.  Okay.  They're  not  only  inappropriate \n10  disproportionate.  But,  both  sentences  are  null  and \n11  void  or must  be  merged  for  the  purposes  of \n12  punishment. \n13  In  addition,  there's  no  competent  arguable \n14  jurisdiction  for  any  subsequent  prosecution  on  the \n15  enhancements  of  alleged  committing  crimes  on  release, \n16  under  Connecticut  General  Statute  53a-40b.  There's \n17  no  competent  arguable  jurisdiction because  I  was \n18  never  put  to  plea  after  I  was  convicted  on  the \n19  Interfering  and  the  Assault  on  the  Police  Officer \n20  that  happened  at  at  one  trial.  I  was  never  put  to \n21  plea  after that,  to  even  go  to  -- to  subsequent \n22  prosecution,  which  is  the  second  trial  on  the  Part  B. \n23  I  never  entered  into  that  contract  because  I  never \n24  gave  a  plea  on  that.  Okay.  Clearly,  illegal \n25  imposition  of  cumulative  punishments  for  all  offenses \n26  was  contrary  to  the  Federal  and  this  State's \n27  Constitutional  Law,  and  to  the  double  jeopardy  clause \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 53 of 64\n50 \n1  of  the  5th  Amendment. \n2  More  importantly  here,  where  as  in  this  case, \n3  the  Trial  Court  has  exceeded  its  own  authority  in \n4  imposing  multiple  punishments  not  authorized  by  our \n5  Legislature.  It violates  yes,  not  only  a  specific \n6  guaranty  against  double  jeopardy,  but  it also \n7  violates  the  Constitutional  Principles  of  Separation \n8  of  Powers  in  the  manner  that  trenches  particularly on \n9  this  privateer  and  his  liberty,  individual  liberty. \n10  So,  I  direct  you  to  at  this  point  to  see  Waylon \n11  versus  The  U.S.  455US  684,  again  Waylon  vs.  U.S. \n12  455US  684.  Now,  the  principles  in Waylon \n13  specifically  state,  give  me  the  guarantied  through \n14  the  14th  Amendment  that  the  facts  and  circumstances \n15  of  the  1st  trial  -- facts  and  circumstances  that \n16  convicted me  on  the  Interfering  Charge,  and  the \n17  Assault  Charge,  cannot  now  be  brought  over  on  the \n18  enhancement  penalty phase  -- or  enhancement  trial  in \n19  the  Part  B,  because  it's a  subsequent  prosecution. \n20  Therefore  it violates  the  double  jeopardy  right \n21  there.  So,  the  issue  is  not  just  alone  that  I \n22  committed  these  of  allegedly  committed  these \n23  offenses,  while  on  released  on  bond  that's  not  the \n24  only  element  of  to  -- that  you  can  use  to  convict \n25  me  there.  You  still have  to  rely  on  the  facts  and \n26  circumstances  of  the  -- conviction  of  the  Assault  and \n27  Interfering,  which  again  you  cannot  now,  because  I've \n\n...  ...  ... \n.'  .' \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 54 of 64\n51 \n1  already been  tried and  convicted  at  that  trial,  you \n2  cannot  bring  them  facts  and  circumstances  back  over \n3  here  now  and  convict  me  in  a  subsequent  prosecution \n4  of  the  enhancement  penalty  because  that's  double \n5  jeopardy.  I've  already  been  tried  and  -- on  them \n6  facts  and  circumstances  once.  You  can't  now  use  them \n7  again  and  then  go  over  here  and  use  them  again,  and \n8  go  over  there  and  use  them  again,  that's  against  the \n9  law.  And  the  rule  of  law  on  that  is  on  my  side. \n10  Notably,  Courts  may  not  proscribe  - hold  on  I \n11  want  to  touch  upon  something  else  here,  before  I  go \n12  there.  Nah,  I'm  going  to  move  on.  All  right. \n13  Notably  Courts  may  not  prescribe  greater \n14  punishments  then  the  Legislature  intended.  Now,  I'm \n15  going  to  direct  you  to  Missouri  versus  Hunter,  459 \n16  U.S.  359.  Also  Brown  versus  Ohio  432  U.S.  161.  In \n17  accordance  with  these  principles  routed  in  com:mon \n18  law,  evident  in  this  case,  along  with  Constitutional \n19  Juris  Prudence  see,  Ex  parte  Lange  (18  Wall.)  163. \n20  We  presume  -~ these  are  fundamental  principles  now, \n21  we  presume  that  where  two  Statutory  Provisions \n22  describe  the  same  offense,  the  Legislature  does  not \n23  intend  to  impose  two  punishments  for  that  offense. \n24  Also,  see  Ball  versus  U.S.  470  U.S.  856.  Now \n25  again,  where  two  Statutory  Provisions  describe  the \n26  same  offense  you  may  want  to  try  to  argue  with  me, \n27  Your  Honor,  that  the  enhancement  is  -- is  not  the \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 55 of 64\n52 \n1  same  offense,  which  -- the  term  not  same  offense, \n2  cannot  be  categorized  that  way  in  this  situation \n3  because  of  the  fact  that,  the  prosecution  now  in \n4  relying  on  that  conviction  for  them  enhancements,  is \n5  relying  on  the  fact  and  circumstances  that  happened \n6  in  the  first  trial on  the  -- to  enhance  -- to  give  me \n7  a  conviction  for  enhancement,  it's not  just  alone \n,.IJ-e;~,.  ~ \nthat  I  · \n8  ~ ~~~~~-comm1tted offenses,  while  on-- out  on \n9  ~  release.  They  still have  to  rely  on  them  prior \n10  convictions.  And  the  facts  and  circumstances,  Your \n11  Honor,  of  them  prior  convictions;  that's  the \n12  threshold  of  one  of  the  elements,  to  that  crime,  or \n13  that  alleged  crime. \n14  All  right.  Oh  but,  more  subsequent \n15  applicability  found  set  forth  in  Bell  verses  U.S.  349 \n16  U.S.  82  and  82,  is  a  question  wholly  different  from \n17  Ex  Parte  versus  Lange  -- I  mean  Ex  Parte  Lange,  in \n18  that  proper  units  into  which  Statutory Offenses  is  to \n19  be  divided.  Okay.  That's  a-- a  wholly  different \n20  question  in  that  proper  units  into  which  Statutory \n21  Offenses  is  to  be  divided.  Yes,  again  as  in  this \n22  case  -- yeah  -- as  in  this  case  when  convicted  of  two \n23  offenses  with  the  same  continuing  episode  of  alleged \n24  criminal  conduct,  the  Co~rt applied  the  traditional \nFet'fta~-ll~r' \n25  rule  of  lenity and  held  particionanor  can  only  be \n26  punished  for  a  single  offense. \n27  So,  now  I'm  going  to  go  back  to  that  same \n\n....  ....  ....  ...  ... \n'  :  '  .  : \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 56 of 64\n54 \n1  Constitutional  Required  Principles  set  forth  by  your \n2  predecessors.  Okay.  So,  now  I've been  spending  all \n3  this  time  citing  you  the  Federal  Statute,  the  Federal \n4  Laws,  and  the  Federal  Case  Laws,  but  look  here,  this \n5  is  insistent  law  of  the  case  conformity  to  the \n6  Constitutional  required  principles  set  forth  by  your \n7  predecessors  of  Connecticut  Supreme  Court  holding  in \nCo-nn. \n8  Lubesky  versus  Bronson  found  at  213  CT  97.  I'm  sure \n9  you  all  are  familiar  with  that  case.  Making  proper \n10  subject  of  the  vacature  approach  that  must  provide \n11  emergency  relief  to  me,  rights  now  with  absolutely  no \nof. \n12  further  suffering  an  actual  injury. \n._  \\3LOC.\\< So~&G\"R'\" \n13  going  to  talk  about  the  block  -- but  in  the \n14  I  don't  know  how  far  you're  going  to  let me \n15  get  on  this,  but \n16  Now  in  effect  with  my  limited  appeal  here,  in \n17  the  scope  of  the  panel  of  two  Judges  in  front  of  me, \n18  here  affords  this  opportunity  for  standard \n19  Blockburger  versus  US  284,  US  299  or  -- or  now  the \n20  more  appropriate  broader  set  of  principles  extended \n21  by  invoking  US  Supreme  President  at  Illinois  versus \n22  Vital  477  US  410.  As  is  in  again  -- as  in  this  case, \n23  and  found  under  successive  prosecution  cases  which  is \n24  a  broader  scope  then  the  limited principles  of  the \n25  Blockburger  Review.  Nevertheless,  by  either  standard \n26  of  application  here,  anyway  you  want  to  slice  it if \n27  you  want  to  call  it apples,  you  want  to  call  it \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 57 of 64\n56 \n1  manipulating  my  accurate  record  because  now,  when  you \n2  go  and  you  read  them  pages,  you're  going  to  see  where \n3  it's transcribed  and  then  what  I  have  done  is  --what \n4  I  had  actually  said was  not  transcribed,  but  I  had \n5  made  notations  and  put  the  correct  spellings  and  the \n6  correct  pronunciations  of  my  articulation.  Now,  look \n7  at  it both  and  I  understand  it's certified by  the--\n8  the  Court  Reporter,  but  you're  going  to  see  it makes \n9  absolutely  no  sense  in  some  very  peculiar  --\n10  peculiarly  peculiar  places.  And  it makes  a  hell \n11  of  a  lot more  sense  with  my  written  words  there.  So, \n12  just  take  your  time  and  look  at  that,  and  see  what \n13  makes  more  sense  to  you,  Your  Honor. \n14  So,  moving  on.  So  upon  stage  set  assistance, \n-U-'\\ -\n15  and  collusion  with  the  lit -- denied  Counsel  right  to \n16  appointment  oh  here  we  go,  my  first  equivalent \n17  plea  at  bar  is  shown  in  miscondec  -- misconducted \n~ \n18  practice  of  law  from  the  bench  by  improper  judicial \n'''NfiEVt;~\" \n-\n19  Baldini  contract1. onal $en.\\o~  not  guilty  entry  at  6/6/11, \n20  page  one  through  five.  Now  that's  on  the  original \n21  on  the  original  drafted  insufficient  information. \n22  So,  I  think  what  I  need  to  do,  is  I  need  to \n23  articulate  this  at  this  point,  so  I  don't  get  lost  in \n24  transit  here.  Right,  see  Exhibit  one  as  well.  So, \n25  Exhibit  one  all  right,  so  anyways,  I  want  to \n26  direct  your  attention  to  Exhibit  five  because  right \n27  after  Judge  Baldini  -- entry  of  a  not  guilty plea  at. \n\n...  ...  ... ..  ... \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 58 of 64\n57 \n1  6/6/11,  page  one  through  five,  also  see  Exhibit  one, \n2  while  deliberately assisting  the  State's  clearly \nIt'Y) \n3  ~  corrupted  ex~nerating evidence  organized  i,n..  \n1 \n':t:r1?~o?R~t:err.es \n4  _p_ro_p_r_i_e_ti..e_s   at  6/6/11  page  six  through  eight  -- see \n5  Exhibit  five,  as  well.  So,  I  guess  that's  in  6/6. \n6  Now,  I  want  to  touch  upon  fatal  variance.  I'm \n7  going  to  give  you  the  definition  here.  Is  a  variance \n8  in  information  tending  to mislead  the  Defendant  as  it \n9  did  in  this  case,  ln making  a  defense  or  one \n10  preventing  a  plea  of  former  jeopardy,  which  both \n11  indisputably  are  found  in  this  case,  and  a  variance \n12  occurs  when  facts  proved  at  trial  are  different  from \n13  those  alleged  in  the  information?-  However,  variance \n14  constitutes  grounds  for  reversing  a  conviction  only \n15  as  in  this  case,  when  it affects  the  Defendant's \n16  substantial  rights.  Yes,  here  when  variance  deprives \n1.. L7'   the  Defendant  of  sufficient  pacific  information  to \n18  prepare  for  that  defense,  and  to  be  protected  against \n19  surprise  at  trial.  And  prevents  him  from  exerting \n20  his  Constitutional  protection  against  the  double \n21  jeopardy.  See  US  versus  George,  CA  MASS  752  F  2nd \nQ.5 \n-\n22  749.  It must  once  again  ask,  is  here  be  misleading \n23  or  serve  so  as  to  substantially and  yes,  materium  --\n24  materially mislead  the  adverse  party,  which  it did. \n25  JUDGE  HADDEN:  Mr.  Young,  you've  been  addressing \n26  The  Court  for  an  hour,  the  panel  has  reminded  you \n27  repeatedly  that  this  panel  has  jurisdiction only  over \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 59 of 64\n58 \n1  the  sentence,  and  our  review  is  whether  or  not,  the \n2  sentence  is  disproportionate  or  inappropriate.  Much \n3  of  what  you  have  argued,  as  again,  as  I  have  pointed \n4  out  to  you  previously  has  to  do  with  issues  that  may \n5.  be  raised  on  appeal.  They  have  to  do  with  issues \n6  that  may  be  raised  in  a  Habeas  Petition.  But  none  of \n7  what  you're  arguing  has  anything  to  do  with  the  issue \n8  of  disproportionate  or  inappropriate  sentence. \nSo,  again,  I'm  going  to  re-direct  you  to  the \n9 \n10  issue  before  this  Court.  Much  of  the  law  that  you \n11  cite  is  quite  correct,  but  it is  not  relevant  to  the \n12  issue  before  thi& panel.  Please  address  your \n13  comments  solely  to  the  issue  of  the  sentence  that  was \n14  imposed  in  your  case \n15  THE  DEFENDANT:  All  right.  Lastly  then,  briefly \nt'h e.. P{';tW\\'l ~t \n16  to  appoint  a  hand  in  none  of  the  foregoing  mentioned \nf~\\4n,SS h o. <; \n17  information  ~~the State  complied  with  any \n18  general  principles  of  form  nor  contents  or  rules  of \n19  pleading  to  be  sufficient  at  law.  So,  obviously  bad \n20  for  the  doubleness  and  null  and  void  for  repugnancy \n21  and  duplicity. \n22  Then .w e  have  trial Court  KK  overly  exceeding \n.:.\"'  ~  9  '  ' \n23  s-::e> ~n!-,t\"e't-n4!c'f-e\\! ..·a~ nII-'\"d~    authorlty  ln  spite  with  violation \n24  definition  of  terms  under  contract.  Now,  I'm  going \n25  to  direct  you  to  see,  9/17/19,  transcript  page  81 \n26  through  90,  which  I'm  going  to  articulate myself \n27  because  I  think  this  will  hit  the  nail  right  on  the \n\n... :  . . ... :  ...  ... \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 60 of 64\n59 \n1  head  for  you. \n2  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  Sir,  while  you  search  for  that \n3  you  keep  referencing  KK,  as  an  abbreviation  for  Judge \n4  Kwak,  where  does  that  come  from? \n5  THE  DEFENDANT:  Kwak.  KK.  Now,  there  was  a  --\n6  a-- another  trial that  I  had  back  in  the  90's  with \n7  Judge  Klaczak.  So,  KK  is  Judge  Klaczak  as  well  as, \n8  Judge  Kwak,  is  where  I  came  up  with  that  scenario. \n9  But,  it's all part  of  the  broader  --broader \n10  part  of  the  conspiracy. \n11  JUDGE  WILLIAMS:  I  regret  having  to  have  asked. \n12  Go  ahead  you  can  conclude. \n13  THE  DEFENDANT:  Okay,  I  submit  to  you  the  word \n14  intent means  to be  instated after Michael  A. \n15  Young  II  -- hold  on  here  - \n,.,...,.-. \n16  Okay,  I'm  just  going  to  start here.

So,  he  never  claims  that  I \n??  intended  to  do  that  iri  drafting  thal  -- that  Statute. \n23  What  Statute  was  that?  Oh,  her~ we  are.  No  it \n24  wasn't  that. \n25  I'm  going  to  go  to  count  two  here.  You're  not \n26  going  to  let me  argue  that.  I  got  to  get  to  the \n27  definitions  and  the  terms  of  these  contracts  here. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 61 of 64\n60 \n1  So \n2  JUDGE  HADDEN:  And  you  said,  this  is  your \n3  summation,  Sir,  this  is  your  conclusion? \n4  THE  DEFENDANT:  No,  this  is  not  my  conclusion, \n5  this  is  just  lastly of what  I  want  to  argue  because  I \n6  understand  he  keeps  saying  that  I'm  not  within  the \n7  scope,  but  this  is  directly  --\nJUDGE  HADDEN:  He  keeps  trying  to  impress  that \n8 \n9  upon  you. \n10  THE  DEFENDANT:  -- this  is  directly within  the \n11  scope  of  the  contract  drafted by  The  State's \n12  Attorney's  Office. \n13  JUDGE  HADDEN:  Please  finish,  Sir,  go  ahead. \n14  THE  DEFENDANT:  But,  I'm  a  little bit \n15  discombobulated. \n16  JUDGE  HADDEN:  Well,  I  think  that's  clear  for \n17•  the  past  hour. \n18  THE  DEFENDANT:  Well,  no,  no,  no.  He  said \n19  everything  allowed \n20  JUDGE  HADDEN:  Go  ahead,  Sir. \n21  THE  DEFENDANT:  What  I  said was  correct. \n22  JUDGE  HADDEN:  Go  ahead,  Sir. \nTHE  DEFENDANT:  Yeah,  that's  what  I  thought. \n23 \n24  JUDGE  HADDEN:  He  said  your  law  that  you  cited \n25  did  not  apply  to  the  scope  of  this  hearing.  But \n26  carry  on. \nTHE  DEFENDANT:  Well  it does  because  there's  no \n27 \n\n...  ...  ... \n: \n. \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 62 of 64\n75 \n1  activity.  And  twenty-eight  criminal  convictions. \n2  It's all  lined  out-- outlined  in  the  Sentencing \n3  Transcript,  but  Mr.  Young  had  a  significant  criminal \n4  record,  consistent  with  the  facts  of  this  case,  for \n5  assaultive  behavior  and  interfering with  Officers. \n6  He  has  shown  noncompliance  in  the  past  with \n7  Court  Orders,  with  Probation  Orders  and  --\n8  THE  DEFENDANT:  Objection,  Your  Honor. \n9  JUDGE  HADDEN:  Sir -- Sir --\n10  THE  DEFENDANT:  Objection. \n11  .J\"  JUDGE  HADDEN:  We'll  listen to  you  in  a  moment. \n\"''~o*'\\ \n12  g~o\\.!l  ...)  ATTY.  BROWN:  And  taking  that  into  account  the \n13  State  would  argue  that  Judge  Kwak's  sentence  is \n14  appropriate  and  proportionate.  There's  a  twenty-two \n15  year maximum  exposure  in  this  case,  Judge  Kwak \n16  sentenced Mr.  Young  to  twelve  years  to  serve  portion, \n17  with  a  period of  Special  Parole  after. \n18  I  believe Mr.  Young  made  a  brief  argument  about \n19  penalizing him  for  going  to  trial.  That  certainly \n20  wasn't  the  case  given  the  fact  that  he  could  have \n21  gotten  an  even  higher  sentence  than  Judge  Kwak \nopt~d \n22  not  to  and  that,  again  any  issues  with  the  PSI,  were \n23  brought  up  prior  to  the  Sentencing  being  started by \n24  Attorney  Joy  on  behalf  of  Mr.  Young.  Mr.  Young  opted \n25  not  to make  a  statement  at  sentencing,  which  is  his \n26  right,  but  was  given  the  opportunity  to  do  so. \n27  Based  on  all of  those,  I  would  ask  Your  Honors \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 63 of 64\n76 \nto  find  that  the  Sentence  is  appropriate  and \n1 \n2  proportionate. \nJUDGE  HADDEN:  All  right.  Mr.  Young,  you  wanted \n3 \n4  to  say  something? \nTHE  DEFENDANT:  Yes,  I  move  to  strike  everything \n5 \nhas  to  say  because  number  one  you  never  put  her \n6  sh~ \nunder  oath,  under  penalty  of  perjury.  And  number  two \n7 \na  lot  of  what  she  has  stated  is  again,  inaccurate \n8 \nmanipulating  the  accurate  record. \n9 \nJUDGE  HADDEN:  All  right.  Your  objection  is \n10 \n11  noted. \nAll  right.  Thank  you  very  much,  Sir.  You  will \n12 \n13  receive  a  written  decision  from  the  Panel. \nTHE  DEFENDANT:  Peace  out. \n14 \n************ \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n\n...  ...  .... \n..  .  .. \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-11   Filed 07/07/20   Page 64 of 64\nNO:  T19-CR11-99206-S  SUPERIOR  COURT \nSTATE  OF  CONNECTICUT  G.A.  #9 \nv. \nAT  MIDDLETOWN,  CONNECTICUT \nMICHAEL  A.

After targeted discovery, depositions, and a denial of a motion to dismiss, the \nparties entered Court-supervised settlement negotiations on the eve of a hearing on the Plaintiffs’ \nmotion for a preliminary injunction.  Plaintiffs now seek to have the fruits of that hard-fought \nnegotiation approved in conformance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e).  Defendants consent to this \nmotion.1 \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nI.  COVID-19 BACKGROUND \nAs this Court is aware, COVID-19 is a serious and potentially fatal respiratory disease \ncaused by a novel coronavirus.  It has infected millions and upended life in every corner of the \nglobe, country, and state.    \nMoreover, all parties are aware of the devastating effects COVID-19 has had on the state \nof Connecticut since March.  As of July 15, 2020, Connecticut has reported 47,750 cases of \nCOVID-19, and 4,389 deaths.2  While conditions have improved in the northeast, the virus \ncontinues to spread exponentially throughout the United States and a “second wave” could be \nimminent here.   \n \n1 Defendants consent to the approval of the settlement agreement because they also believe the \nGrinnell  factors  heavily  weigh  in  favor  of  acceptance  of  the  agreement.   However,  the \ndefendants  do not agree with, and continue to dispute, many of the factual representations that \nform the basis of the plaintiffs’ claims.  Furthermore, the defendants, by consenting to the approval \nof the agreement, do not also consent to this motion serving as an interpretive document should \nthere be a dispute in the future as to any of its terms or conditions. \n2  Connecticut  Open  Data,  COVID-19  Data  Resources:  Connecticut  Summary,  available  at \nhttps://cutt.ly/2yse8YA (last visited July 15, 2020). \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 6 of 33\nWhile scientists worldwide are still analyzing how COVID-19 spreads, it is accepted that \nit  spreads  from  person  to  person  through  respiratory  droplets  and  close  personal  contact.3  \nSymptomatic persons spread the disease, but so too can asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic \npersons.4  For this reason, the CDC has recommended persons wear masks any time they leave \ntheir homes5 and Governor Lamont issued an executive order requiring “any person in a public \nplace in Connecticut who is unable to or does not maintain a safe social distance of approximately \nsix feet from every other person [to] cover their mouth and nose with a mask or cloth face-\ncovering.”6   \nThere is still no known cure, vaccine, or treatment for COVID-19.  COVID-19 presents an \neven greater risk of serious symptoms and death for those who are over 50 or have certain \npreexisting medical conditions.  The need for care, including intensive care, and the likelihood of \ndeath, is much higher from COVID-19 than from influenza.  High-risk patients who survive can \nexpect  prolonged  recovery,  including  the  need  for  extensive  rehabilitation  for  profound \nreconditioning, loss of digits, neurological damage, and loss of respiratory capacity. \nThe expert consensus is that the most effective strategy for limiting the spread of the \ndisease is social distancing—deliberately keeping at least six feet of space between persons to \navoid spreading the illness—combined with a vigilant hygiene regimen, including frequent hand-\nwashing and routine disinfecting of surfaces, and covering one’s mouth and nose when around \nothers.7  Following the recommendation of public health experts, government officials across the \n \n3 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, How COVID-19 Spreads, available at https://cutt.ly/eaalOau \n(last visited July 17, 2020). \n4 Id.  \n5 Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), Considerations for \nWearing Cloth Face Covierings, available at https://cutt.ly/rysekak (last visited July 17, 2020). \n6 Exec.

THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 THROUGH CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES \nConnecticut’s Department of Correction (DOC), like other correctional facilities, has \nproven to be particularly vulnerable to outbreaks.   \nBy mid-March, public health experts in Connecticut experienced in correctional health \nbegan  to  express  “grave  concern  that,  absent  immediate  action,  COVID-19  will  overrun \nConnecticut’s jails and prisons.”8  This is because, like other congregate settings such as nursing \nhomes, prisons and jails are conducive to the spread of such a contagious disease.  People \nincarcerated in these facilities are forced into close contact with each other and prison staff, \nincluding corrections officers.  Compl. (ECF No. 1) at ¶ 15–18.  Many DOC facilities have \ndormitory-style housing in which up to 120 people live side-by-side in one room.  Other DOC \nfacilities hold incarcerated people two to a cell in close quarters.  Social distancing in a cell is \nimpossible:  cellmates sleep in bunk beds and share a desk, a toilet, and a sink in each cell.  And \nlike their dormitory counterparts, DOC facilities with double cells hold upwards of 80 people in \neach unit.  Any time people in double-celled units are out of their cells, they share each and every \ninch of physical space with their entire unit in common areas.  \nIt is difficult for those incarcerated in DOC facilities to achieve the requisite social \ndistancing needed to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19.  They share or touch objects \nsuch as objects or recreation equipment used often by others and cleaned infrequently.  In addition \nto eating, sleeping, recreating, and living close to each other, they have to share bathroom \nfacilities—showers, toilets, and sinks.   \n \n8 Letter from Dr. Emily Wang et al. to Governor Lamont, Ex. A to Pls’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (ECF No. 43-\n1). \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 8 of 33\nAdditionally, about 40 percent of incarcerated people nationally are estimated to have at \nleast one chronic illness.  See id. ¶¶ 10–12.  Many of these illnesses, such as hypertension, asthma, \ndiabetes, and chronic kidney disease, are associated with more severe cases of COVID-19 and \npoorer outcomes, including death.9  But chronically ill incarcerated people face a far greater risk \nof severe illness and death from COVID-19 than those with similar preexisting conditions who are \nfree to isolate in their homes or avoid groups of people. \nPublic health experts have issued guidance in light of the extraordinary risk COVID-19 \nposes  to  those  in  correctional  facilities.    The  CDC’s  COVID-19  guidance  documents  for \ncorrectional facilities recommend, among other things, social distancing to increase space between \nincarcerated people to six feet.10  Because regular, frequent handwashing is vital for limiting the \nspread of COVID-19, they also establish that prisons should “[p]rovide a no-cost supply of soap \nto incarcerated/detained persons, sufficient to allow frequent hand washing.”  They further provide \nthat  doorknobs,  light  switches,  sink  handles,  countertops,  toilets,  toilet  handles,  recreation \nequipment, kiosks, and telephones be cleaned “several times a day.”11   \nIII.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nFrom the beginning of the litigation, Defendants have vigorously contested Plaintiffs’ \nallegations, denied wrongdoing, and asserted that the DOC’s efforts to protect incarcerated people \nhave been exemplary in light of the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.

After a hard-fought discovery period and significant briefing, \nthe parties engaged in arms-length negotiations, assisted by Judge Garfinkel, who played a key \nrole in bringing the parties together and facilitating productive discussions that resulted in a fair \nsettlement. \nThis Court already is very familiar with the procedural history in this case, which is briefly \nsummarized below. \na.  Initiation of Lawsuit  \nPrior to the inception of this suit, certain of Plaintiffs’ counsel and other co-counsel—\nrepresenting a group of incarcerated people and the Connecticut Criminal Defense Lawyers \nAssociation (“CCDLA”)—filed a mandamus action in Connecticut Superior Court against the \nsame defendants as here on April 3, 2020.  See Conn. Crim. Def. Laws. Assoc. v. Lamont, No. \nUWY-CV20-6054309-S (Conn. Super. Ct. 2020) (Dkt. 100.31).  The defendants moved to \ndismiss12 on April 7, 2020.  The superior court heard argument on April 15, 2020, and dismissed \nthe case on April 24, 2020.  In its order, the court concluded that none of the plaintiffs possessed \nstanding to prosecute the claims, quizzically finding that “plaintiffs do not allege that any of them \nare housed with or otherwise directly exposed to individuals with COVID-19.”  CCDLA v. Lamont, \nNo. UWY-CV20-6054309-S, slip op. at 6 (Conn. Super. Ct. Apr. 24, 2020) (attached as Exhibit \n1).  The court also concluded that, even if any plaintiff had standing, their claims “involve \nnonjusticiable political questions.”  Id. at 8.  The plaintiffs sought, and were granted, expedited \n \n12 In Connecticut practice, a motion to dismiss is solely for the purpose of asserting “(1) lack of jurisdiction \nover the subject matter; (2) lack of jurisdiction over the person; (3) insufficiency of process; and (4) \ninsufficiency of service of process.”  Conn. R. Super. Ct. § 10-30(a). \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 10 of 33\ndirect review at the Connecticut Supreme Court.  Notice to Counsel, CCDLA v. Lamont, No. 20470 \n(Conn. May 15, 2020) (attached as Exhibit 2).  On June 6, 2020, following the parties’ agreement \nin this litigation, the CCDLA plaintiffs dismissed their appeal. \nOn April 20, 2020, Plaintiffs filed the instant class action complaint for declaratory and \ninjunctive relief and petition for writs of habeas corpus against Governor Ned Lamont and the \nCommissioner of the Department of Correction (then, Rollin Cook).  Plaintiffs, sentenced and \nunsentenced people in DOC facilities, requested relief from both detention and conditions of \nconfinement that violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  (ECF No. 1.)  At the time of \nfiling, a month into the COVID-19 pandemic, over 200 DOC staff members and almost 300 \nincarcerated  people  had  tested  for  positive  for  COVID-19,  already  resulting  in  one  death.  \nIncarcerated people in DOC facilities had the highest infection rate in the state, at almost 2.3%.  \nPlaintiffs alleged that DOC lacked necessary sanitation and hygiene procedures, social distancing, \nand quarantining of those who had tested positive or been exposed.   \nb.  Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nOn April 27, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order seeking \nexpedited release of members of the medically vulnerable subclasses as well as specific mitigation \nefforts to halt the spread of COVID-19 within DOC facilities.  (ECF No. 15.)  Defendants \nimmediately moved to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims on jurisdictional grounds, alleging that Plaintiffs \nwere required, and failed, to exhaust available administrative and state court remedies, and were \nfurther barred from brining their claims by PLRA exhaustion.  Following responsive briefing, oral \nargument was held on May 4.  This Court denied the Motion to Dismiss on May 6.  It held that, as \nPlaintiffs argued, the state court system’s near-shutdown meant that state court avenues were \nunavailable, and that grievance procedures were similarly “unavailable.”  (ECF No. 37.)   \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 11 of 33\nOn May 10, 2020, Plaintiffs converted their motion for a temporary restraining order into \na motion for preliminary injunction, seeking identical relief.  (ECF No. 43.)  Defendants opposed \nthe motion for preliminary injunction on May 18, 2020.  (ECF No. 59.)  In the course of preparing \nfor the preliminary injunction hearing, Plaintiffs served multiple sets of discovery requests and \nreceived three productions of discovery from Defendants. \nc.  Negotiation \nOn the eve of the preliminary injunction hearing scheduled for May 22, 2020, the parties \nstipulated to, and the Court granted, a motion to continue the preliminary injunction hearing on \nMay 21, 2020, to allow the parties to pursue settlement negotiations mediated by Magistrate Judge \nWilliam I. Garfinkel.  (ECF No. 86.)  Intensive negotiations took place over the course of the next \ntwo weeks.  With the assistance of Judge Garfinkel, the parties reached an agreement on June 6, \n2020.  (ECF No. 101.)  In light of the settlement, the parties jointly moved to certify the class on \nJune 11, 2020.  (ECF No. 104.)  The Court granted the joint motion for class certification on June \n12, 2020.  (ECF No. 105.)  \nIV.  SETTLEMENT \nThe parties’ proposed settlement agreement (hereinafter, “Agreement,” docketed at ECF \nNo. 160-1) is detailed and puts in place a variety of specific mitigation measures to improve \nCOVID-19-related  sanitation,  hygiene,  and  medical  monitoring  at  every  Connecticut  DOC \nfacility.  It also provides for a five-person monitoring panel to (1) oversee adherence to COVID-\n19-related correctional public health standards and to (2) make real-time recommendations to DOC \nregarding its COVID-19 mitigation efforts.  The panel’s output will be public.  Finally, the \nAgreement provides for a dispute resolution procedure in front of Judge Garfinkel in the event of \nDefendants’ non-compliance with the measures in the Agreement.  \nThe major terms of the settlement are summarized below: \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 12 of 33\na.  The Settlement Class \nThe parties have agreed that the Settlement Class will be defined identically to the \ncertified class, as follows: \nAll persons who were incarcerated in a DOC facility from March 1, 2020, \nor are incarcerated, or  in the future will be so incarcerated, until the \ntermination date of this Agreement, December 31, 2020. \nb.  Settlement Terms \nThrough the Agreement, Defendants have agreed to undertake a comprehensive set of \nmitigation measures aimed at preventing the transmission of COVID-19 within its facilities to the \ngreatest extent possible.  The substance of the Agreement is contained within five categories:  A) \nCDC Guidelines; B) Monitoring; C) Testing; D) Sanitation; and E) Discretionary Release of \nPrisoners.  Settlement Agreement ¶¶ 1-26. \nCDC Guidance \nFirst, Defendants agree to make best efforts to implement the public health guidance \npromulgated by the CDC has issued for correctional facilities during the COVID-19 crisis.  \nMonitoring Panel \nSecond,  Defendants  have  agreed  to  the  establishment  of  a  five-person  independent \nmonitoring panel.  Plaintiffs consider this independent monitoring panel to be the cornerstone of \nthe  Agreement,  providing  continued  insight  into  and  accountability  for  DOC’s  COVID-19 \nresponse.  The monitoring panel also benefits Defendants by providing expert public health \nguidance as DOC navigates this challenging public health crisis.   \nThe panel will include two people selected by DOC; two people selected by Plaintiffs; and \na fifth person chosen by consensus, who cannot be currently employed by DOC.  Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel does not intend for the panel members it selects to be currently employed by DOC.  \nAccordingly, the panel will consist of—at most—two members out of five who are currently \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 13 of 33\nemployed by DOC, and thus the majority of the panel will be independent of DOC.  \nThe panel’s role is to serve as an ombudsman for the duration of the Agreement.  The \nAgreement directs it to make recommendations to aid DOC’s response to COVID-19, both in terms \nof complying with the CDC guidelines, and incorporating “evolving public health guidance that \nmay require a change to DOC’s COVID-19 response.”  Settlement Agreement ¶ 5.  Within that \nbroad mandate, the panel is to focus on DOC’s strategy for mass testing; quarantining; and \nsanitation.  Id.  \nTo facilitate its independence, the panel will be able to devise its own procedures for \nmonitoring the Agreement.  Not only will it be given access to all materials and staff required to \ndo its job, but it will also be given onsite access to DOC facilities.  Panel members will be \ncompensated for their time over the course of the Agreement with a flat $15,000 fee.     \nIn the Amended Settlement Agreement signed on June 26, 2020, the parties agreed that the \nreports produced by the panel are to be public documents.  Plaintiffs’ counsel intends to facilitate \ntheir provision to class members, as requested.    \nTesting  \nThird, DOC has agreed to provide a COVID-19 viral test to every person in its custody.  \nThe only exceptions are if a person refuses testing, or has already been tested within 14 days.  \nDefendants have agreed to report the numbers of those tested by facility, and the results of those \ntests, on an ongoing basis.13  \nThe  “Testing”  provisions  of  the  Agreement  also  contain  mandates  for  quarantining.  \nDefendants  have  agreed  to  quarantine  those  newly  admitted  to  custody  for  14  days,  with \n \n13 Plaintiffs’ counsel (and their outside medical experts) view mass testing as a vital component of the \nAgreement.  At the outset of this lawsuit and well into May, DOC was doing no mass testing.  DOC began \nconducting mass testing shortly before the parties began negotiations. \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 14 of 33\nmonitoring for symptoms throughout.  Defendants have also agreed to medically isolate those who \ntest positive for COVID-19.  For those who are symptomatic, Defendants have further agreed to \nrobust medical monitoring that includes twice daily checks for temperature, respiratory rate, heart \nrate, and blood oxygen saturation levels, as well as a daily blood pressure check.  \nThese  provisions  are  intended  to  respond  to  class  members’  concerns  regarding \ncomprehensive quarantining procedures, as well as medical monitoring for those who have \nsymptomatic infections.  The quarantining and medical monitoring provisions put into place also \nreflect the recommendations of Plaintiffs’ outside medical and infectious disease experts.14  \nFinally, Defendants have agreed that “placement in medical monitoring, medical isolation \nand medical quarantine units shall not be considered punitive isolation.”  Settlement Agreement \n¶ 14.  In addition, DOC will make best efforts to return people who are medically isolated to their \npre-isolation facilities, jobs, and programs.  These provisions are intended to respond to common \nconcerns from class members regarding the conditions of medical isolation employed by DOC, \nparticularly in April and early May.  There was significant concern (as reflected in many of the \nresponses to the Agreement from class members) that medical isolation was indistinguishable from \npunitive isolation, and that people were being placed in segregation-like conditions, particularly \nin Northern Correctional Institution.  As alleged in the motion for a preliminary injunction, fear of \nbeing placed in a “punitive” status, as well as fear of losing housing, job, or programming status, \ncreated a strong disincentive for reporting symptoms.  \nSanitation \nAt the filing of this suit in late April, class members were highly concerned about sanitation \n \n14 While some class members have objected to the lack of a post-quarantine follow-up COVID-19 test \nbefore someone is returned to the general population, this was not the recommendation of Plaintiffs’ outside \nexperts—and is not recommended by the CDC.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 15 of 33\nin their facilities; access to soap; and their ability to sanitize their living areas.  The seven \n“Sanitation” provisions reflect public health guidance on minimizing risk of transmission of \nCOVID-19, and are intended to memorialize, standardize, and build upon the varying policies in \neffect across DOC facilities during the pendency of this lawsuit.  They include:  \n•  Free distribution of two bars of soap to every person in custody, each week;  \n•  Cleaning of all common areas of all facilities twice per shift on first and second \nshift;  \n•  Provision of both “sufficient disinfectant cleaning agents not diluted in excess of \nmanufacturers’ specifications” and equipment to clean cells, cubicles, or sleeping \nareas at least twice per week; and \n•  A mandate that all people in custody be allowed to shower in running water at least \nevery other day, “regardless of COVID-19 symptoms, test results, or housing.”  \nPlaintiffs’ counsel considered this important because during this lawsuit, many \nclass members were not allowed to shower for weeks at a time while quarantined.  \nIn addition, Defendants have agreed to provide two masks to each person in custody for \nthe duration of the Agreement, with one mask able to be exchanged, weekly, for a new mask.  This \nis contingent on DOC’s production abilities.  Finally, “[s]taff in correctional facilities will be \nrequired to wear masks when social distancing is not possible” and they “may be exempted from \nthis only if medically necessary.”  Settlement Agreement ¶ 23.  Notably, in response to the \nAgreement a number of incarcerated people voiced concerns about inconsistent mask-wearing by \nstaff.  The Agreement, if approved, will make mask wearing mandatory in many correctional \nsettings when staff interact with class members.   \nDiscretionary Release of Prisoners \nThe Defendants have agreed that—in the context of exercising statutory power to release \nclass members on a discretionary basis—the Commissioner of Correction will prioritize for \nconsideration those prisoners who are 65 or older, or if they have a medical score of 4 or 5.  \nDispute Resolution Mechanism \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 16 of 33\nSeparate and apart from the oversight of the independent monitoring panel, Defendants \nhave agreed to a specific dispute resolution mechanism to address any potential non-compliance \nwith the Agreement.  “If, while this Agreement is in effect, Plaintiffs’ Counsel have reasonable \ngrounds to believe that there is a systemic pattern or practice of non-compliance with this \nAgreement in one or more DOC Facilities, or if DOC proposes or enacts revisions or changes to \nits COVID-19 policies and procedures that are materially inconsistent with the Agreement and the \nCDC guidelines, and to the detriment of the class,” Plaintiffs’ counsel may initiate a dispute \nresolution procedure before Judge Garfinkel.  Settlement Agreement ¶ 40-44.  If mediation with \nJudge  Garfinkel  is  unsuccessful,  Plaintiffs’  counsel  may  seek  specific  performance  of  the \nAgreement through the Court.  Id. ¶ 44.  Plaintiffs’ counsel have agreed that they will not be able \nto seek any attorneys’ fees for their efforts to ensure compliance with the Agreement.  \nTermination of Agreement \nThe Agreement will terminate on December 31, 2020, “provided that upon the mutual \nconsent of the parties, it may be extended.”  Settlement Agreement ¶ 28.  \nAttorneys’ Fees  \nThe Agreement provides for $40,000 in attorneys’ fees.  This number represents a very \nsmall fraction of the costs and approximately $900,000 in District of Connecticut rates that \nPlaintiffs’ counsel put into the case, and to which they would be entitled should they prevail on \nthe class’ claims.  \nDismissal and Release of Claims \nThe Agreement contains a release of claims on behalf of the class that is as narrowly drawn \nas possible.  It is the “parties’ stated and undisputed intent to release only the class members’ \nclaims for injunctive relief against the defendants.”  See McReynolds v. Richards-Cantave, 588 \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 17 of 33\nF.3d 790, 803 (2d Cir. 2009) (upholding agreement for injunctive relief in class action on this \nbasis).  In other words, the release is limited to actions “for non-monetary relief arising from acts \nor omissions alleged in the Complaint, or from acts or omissions that could have been litigated by \nthe class in this action.”  Settlement Agreement ¶ 30.  The Agreement thus has no effect on any \nclass member’s claim for money damages on the basis of COVID-19 infection, exposure, or \nconditions.  For the sake of clarity, the Agreement also contains explicit language stating that it \nhas no effect on “criminal proceedings within the courts of the State of Connecticut” (such as \nsentence modifications or bond modifications); or on class members’ ability to “seek and/or \nqualify for discretionary release.”  It also explicitly exempts any pending habeas case related to \nCOVID-19, as counsel were aware of several pending habeas cases at the time of the Agreement’s \nsigning and in no way wanted to affect them.  \nRelease or no release, the law of preclusion means the barring of similar actions for \ninjunctive relief would be the likely product of any settlement in this case.  The Agreement does \nthis, and no more, for a very limited period of time.   \nLEGAL STANDARD \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e) provides that “the court may approve [a proposed \nsettlement] only after a hearing and on finding that it is fair, reasonable, and adequate.”  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(e)(2).  If the parties negotiate a settlement before “class certification, as is the case here, \nit is subject to a higher degree of scrutiny in assessing its fairness.”  D’Amato v. Deutsche Bank, \n236 F.3d 78, 85 (2d Cir. 2001).  In these circumstances, the court examines “both the negotiation \nprocess and the settlement’s substantive terms to determine its fairness.”  Id.   \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE  HARD-FOUGHT  NEGOTIATION  THAT  RESULTED  IN  THE \nPROPOSED SETTLEMENT WAS PROCEDURALLY FAIR \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 18 of 33\n“To  determine  procedural  fairness,  courts  examine  the negotiating process leading  to \nthe settlement.”  In re Sturm, Ruger, & Co., Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 3:09CV1293 VLB, 2012 WL \n3589610, at *3 (D. Conn. Aug. 20, 2012) (citation omitted).  “A ‘presumption of fairness, \nadequacy, and reasonableness may attach to a class settlement reached in arm’s-length negotiations \nbetween experienced, capable counsel after meaningful discovery.’”  Wal–Mart Stores, Inc. v. Visa \nU.S.A. Inc., 396 F.3d 96, 116 (2d Cir. 2005). \nIn this case, there is no question that “the litigation was hard-fought and the settlement \nnegotiations . . . were extended and involved the Court.”  Ingles v. Toro, 438 F. Supp. 2d 203, 213 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2006) (approving injunctive class settlement in prisoner lawsuit).  Intense negotiations \nbetween the parties in this action began on Friday, May 22, and continued near-daily for two \nweeks.    During  the  extensive  negotiation  process,  the  parties  exchanged  multiple  drafts  of \nsettlement proposals and “engaged in a vigorous exchange regarding their respective claims and \ndefenses,” Johnson v. Brennan, No. 10-CIV-4712, 2011 WL 4357376, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 16, \n2011) (approving class settlement), speaking to Judge Garfinkel’s chambers and/or to each other \nmultiple times per day.  As Judge Garfinkel can attest, these exchanges were highly adversarial—\nunderscoring the arm’s-length nature of the process.  In re Austrian & German Bank Holocaust \nLitig., 80 F. Supp. 2d 164, 174 (S.D.N.Y. 2000), aff’d sub nom. D’Amato v. Deutsche Bank, 236 \nF.3d 78 (2d Cir. 2001) (approving class settlement as the product of arms-length negotiations, \nwhere “at points the negotiations were extremely contentious”).  \nMoreover, the settlement negotiations began on the eve of an evidentiary hearing on the \nplaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.  Between the filing of this case on April 20, 2020, \nand the commencement of negotiations on May 22, 2020, the parties condensed months’ worth of \nlitigation, pleadings, and trial preparation into a few weeks.  Negotiations commenced hours before \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 19 of 33\nan evidentiary hearing for which both sides had prepared extensively.  See Wal–Mart, 396 F.3d at \n117 (noting that district court held that “there could not be any better evidence of procedural \nintegrity than the aggressive litigation . . . and the impassioned settlement negotiations that \nproduced an agreement on the brink of trial”).  At that juncture, counsel for Plaintiffs had reviewed \nthree productions of documents from Defendants in response to multiple sets of discovery \nrequests—comprising more than 100 policies, procedures, memoranda, and other materials—in \naddition to the hundreds of exhibits filed on the docket by both parties (much of which were first-\nhand testimony in the form of declarations).  They also had conducted depositions of Defendant \nCook and Dr. Byron Kennedy.  Finally, they had worked extensively with seven lay witnesses in \npreparation for their testimony.  Defendants, in turn, had deposed two medical experts retained by \nPlaintiffs and had provided declarations for a number of witnesses they intended to present at the \nhearing. \nAgainst this backdrop, “[b]oth the Court and the parties had a substantial evidentiary basis \nfor evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of plaintiffs’ claims and defendants’ defenses.”  \nIngles, 438 F. Supp. 2d at 213.  Given the record developed at the point of negotiation, and their \ninvestigation of the facts against a shifting legal and factual landscape, counsel were not drafting \nthe Agreement on a blank canvas.  To the contrary, they had a “clear view of the strengths and \nweaknesses of their cases and of the adequacy of the settlement.”  In re Sturm, Ruger, & Co., Inc. \nSec. Litig., 2012 WL 3589610, at *5 (internal citation omitted).  “This factor therefore also \nsupports approval of the settlement,” as a strong indication that the negotiation was procedurally \nfair.  Id.  \nII.  THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IS SUBSTANTIVELY FAIR, \nREASONABLE,  AND  ADEQUATE  BASED  ON  ASSESSMENT  OF  THE \nGRINNELL FACTORS \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 20 of 33\nThe Agreement also is substantively fair, reasonable, and adequate.  When determining \nwhether a settlement agreement is substantively fair, reasonable, and adequate, courts consider the \nfollowing factors, commonly referred to as the Grinnell factors:  \n \n1)  the complexity, expense, and likely duration of the litigation;  \n2)  the reaction of the class to the settlement;  \n3)  the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed;  \n4)  the risks of establishing liability;  \n5)  the risks of establishing damages;  \n6)  the risks of maintaining a class action through trial;  \n7)  the ability of defendants to withstand greater judgment;  \n8)  the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of the best possible \nrecovery;  \n9)  the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of the attendant risks of \nlitigation. \nCity of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp., 495 F.2d 448, 463 (2d Cir. 1974), abrogated on other grounds \nby Goldberger v. Integrated Res., Inc., 209 F.3d 43 (2d Cir. 2000); see also O’Connor v. AR Res., \n2012 WL 12743 at *2 (D. Conn. Jan. 4, 2012).  Where, as here, the plaintiffs seek declaratory and \ninjunctive relief rather than money damages, courts need not examine the last three factors.  \nE.g., Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 185 F.R.D. 152, 162 (S.D.N.Y.1999) (“The court will not review the \nlast three [Grinnell] criteria as they are applicable only in actions for damages, and will examine \nthe fifth criteria in light of establishing remedies instead of damages.”).  “For a settlement to be \nsubstantively fair, not every factor must weigh in favor of settlement, rather, the court should \nconsider the totality of these factors in light of the particular circumstances.”  Kemp-DeLisser v. \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 21 of 33\nSaint Francis Hosp. & Med. Ctr., 2016 WL 6542707, at *7 (D. Conn. Nov. 3, 2016) (internal \ncitations and quotation marks omitted). \n  Each of the six applicable Grinnell factors is analyzed below.   \na.  The Length, Complexity, and Duration of the Litigation Set Against the \nBackdrop of the Pandemic Weighs in Favor of Approving the Proposed \nSettlement \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants are contravening the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments \nby failing to arrest the spread of the COVID-19 pathogen within Connecticut prisons.  The legal \nquestions posed by the three-count complaint reduce to whether the COVID-19 virus poses an \nobjective  threat  to  human  health;  whether  Defendants’  knowledge,  actions,  and  inaction \ndemonstrates a deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs’ serious medical need, and, for the pre-trial \ndetainee Plaintiffs, whether the conditions in Defendants’ prisons bears no rational relationship to \na legitimate governmental objective.  Defendants deny that they violated the Constitution or that \nthey acted with indifference, particularly in light of the unique challenges of managing the \npandemic in a correctional setting. \nThe factual proof of Plaintiffs’ claims—at the preliminary injunction stage alone, which is \nwhere the parties had reached at the time of their agreement—required significant evidence.  \nPlaintiffs had designated two physician experts to testify at a preliminary injunction hearing, as \nwell as seven people with firsthand knowledge of conditions within Defendants’ prisons, Pls.’ \nFinal Ex. & Witness List (ECF No. 74) at 17, and planned to introduce more than one hundred \ndocuments showing Defendants’ action or inaction.  Id. 1-16.  Defendants anticipated introducing \nfifty documents, Defs.’ Ex. & Witness List (ECF No. 77) at 1-3 , as well as three experts and four \nlay witnesses who would defend DOC’s conduct.  Id. at 1.   \nAlthough the Court had allotted one day on which to hear evidence (ECF No. 81), and held \nan additional day in reserve, it seems likely that the presentation and arguments would exceed \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 22 of 33\nthose parameters.  And if Plaintiffs were to prevail after a pre-trial evidentiary hearing, Defendants \nlikely would file an immediate appeal of challenging any preliminary relief ordered by the Court. \nAs against a trial, the length and complexity of preliminary proceedings in this litigation \ndo not seem onerous.  However, Plaintiffs are working against the clock in a conditions case such \nas this one, in which each week that the litigation remained unresolved increased risk to inmates \nand staff alike.  Cf. Rodriquez v. It’s Just Lunch Int’l, 2020 WL 1030983, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 2, \n2020) (finding the Grinnell durational factor satisfied by the possibility of an ultimate liability \ndecision being “years away”).  So, for Plaintiffs, reaching an agreement in the near term that \nprovides for much of the relief that they sought is greatly preferable to obtaining a court order, \nperhaps defending an appeal, and then facing the possibility of additional discovery, summary \njudgment, trial, and another appeal.  The speed at which relief—in whatever form—was required \nin the face of the pandemic merits approval of the proposed settlement. \nb.  The Reaction of the Class Members Does Not Weigh Against Approval \n  The second Grinnell factor, the class’s reaction to the settlement, “is perhaps the most \nsignificant factor to be weighed in considering its adequacy.”  O’Connor, 2012 WL 12743, at *4 \n(citing In re Am. Bank Note Holographics, Inc., 127 F. Supp. 2d 418, 425 (S.D.N.Y. 2001)).  \nNamed class members were consulted about and consented to the Agreement before it was signed.  \nMost of the more than 9,700 class members received notice of the settlement.  The deadline for \nclass members to respond and/or object to the Agreement was July 13, 2020.  Since the posting of \nNotice within each DOC facility, approximately 450 class members have submitted responses to \nthe Agreement.15  Responses have been sent either directly to Plaintiffs’ counsel and/or transmitted \n \n15 Some individuals have submitted multiple responses. Some class members have also signed \nonto other individuals’ responses.   \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 23 of 33\ndirectly to the clerk’s office to be placed on the case docket.  For full transparency and fairness to \nclass members, Plaintiffs’ counsel has docketed all responses received to date.  They have also \nreviewed every response, and have summarized them for the Court.  (ECF No. 160.)  Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel appreciates the many class members who took time to respond to the Agreement. \nThe number of responses (from approximately 450 of 10,000 class members) is not \ndispositive, as the “the amount of opposition to the proposed settlement does not compel its \nrejection.”  Isby v. Bayh, 75 F.3d 1191, 1200 (7th Cir. 1996) (upholding approval of settlement \nwhere 13% of the class of incarcerated people submitted written objections in response to the \nnotice of settlement); see also Stoetzner v. U.S. Steel Corp., 897 F.2d 115, 118–19 (3d Cir. 1990) \n(“only” 10% of the class had objected, which “strongly favors settlement”); Boyd v. Bechtel Corp., \n485 F. Supp. 610, 624 (N.D. Cal.1979) (16% of the class objecting was deemed “persuasive” of \nthe adequacy of the settlement).  \nNor does the substance of the responses weigh against approval.  Many responses were not \nobjections to the Agreement per se.  Rather, these responses detailed class members’ difficult and \ntraumatic experiences in prison during the pandemic, including conditions prior to the filing of the \nlawsuit, or during the pendency of the lawsuit.  Other responders described their health conditions \nand care by DOC, and argued that these weighed in favor of their being released from custody.  \nWhile Plaintiffs’ counsel acknowledge the seriousness of these allegations (echoed in their \nhundreds of conversations with class members over the course of the litigation), “an individual \ninmate’s objections regarding his own care are not directly relevant to the Court’s inquiry into the \nfairness of the Settlement Agreement,” Austin v. Pa. Dep’t of Corr., 876 F. Supp. 1437, 1459 (E.D. \nPa. 1995), particularly where the mitigation measures entailed by the Agreement are not yet in \neffect.  Again, these experiences speak to the utility and necessity of this Agreement.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 24 of 33\nIn addition, many objections involved confusion with the terms of the Agreement or its \ntiming, based on incorrect information or a lack of understanding of the Agreement.  These \nobjections do not speak to the fundamental fairness of the Agreement.  See Gaddis v. Campbell, \n301 F. Supp. 2d 1310, 1315 (M.D. Ala. 2004) (approving settlement for injunctive relief in prison \nsuit where “[m]any of the objections filed in this case are based on incorrect information or a lack \nof understanding of the settlement agreement,” including that the Agreement “lack[ed] provisions \nthat it actually contains”).   \nFirst, many class members stated that DOC was not in current compliance with the terms \nof the Agreement, and provided details on that non-compliance.  These objections are addressed \nby the fact that DOC is not required to comply with the Agreement unless and until the Agreement \nis approved by the Court (and they further, underscore the need for the Agreement to be so \napproved).  Second, many class members were upset that they would not receive money damages \nfrom this lawsuit.  These included class members who asked to “opt out” of the class on this basis.  \nHowever, Plaintiffs never sought money damages in this action, and the Agreement expressly does \nnot waive any individual damages claims that members of the Settlement Class may have with \nrespect  to  harms  incurred  as  a  result  of  being  subjected  to  COVID-19  while  incarcerated.  \nSettlement Agreement ¶ 30 (limiting the release of claims to those for “non-monetary relief arising \nfrom acts or omissions alleged in the Complaint”).  Class members will not, by way of the \nAgreement, be barred from bringing their own lawsuits for money damages based on COVID-19-\nrelated allegations, their infection with COVID-19, or anything else.  See Stinson v. City of New \nYork, 256 F. Supp. 3d 283, 292–93 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (approving a settlement involving improperly \nissued summonses where it did not release any class members’ individual damage claims of \nexcessive  force  arising  from  the  same  incident).    Plaintiffs’  counsel  is  in  the  process  of \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 25 of 33\ncommunicating this to objecting class members, and will continue to convey this widely to all \nmembers of the class.  \nAnother subset of objections—brought by an attorney representing 50 objectors—involved \na lengthy list of demands unrelated to and beyond the scope of this case.  (ECF No. 135.)  These \ninclude reducing the state’s incarceration expenditures by 50 percent in 2020; establishing an \nindependent body to review the sentence modification process; and creating an independent \ngrievance process and investigative body for alleged misconduct by DOC and other state agencies.  \nMany of these proposals are for relief that could not have been achieved through this case, whether \nby way of settlement or Court order—not least because of the stringent dictates of the PLRA’s \nprovisions on “narrowly drawn” injunctive relief.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(1).  \nAs to enforceability concerns, it is noteworthy that the “Settlement Agreement contains a \ndispute resolution mechanism that Class Counsel can invoke if serious complaints continue to arise \nregarding these matters.”  Decoteau v. Raemisch, 2016 WL 8416757, at *7 (D. Colo. July 6, 2016) \n(approving settlement for injunctive relief in prison suit).  This is in addition to the outside \nmonitoring provided by independent monitoring panel.  Thus, while acknowledging that “[s]ome \nof the comments filed predict that the Corrections Department will not actually follow the terms \nof the settlement,” the fact that “the agreement provides for monitoring by an independent contract \nmonitor”  provides  significant  reassurance.    Gaddis,  301  F.  Supp.  2d  at  1315  (approving \nsettlement).  \nThe remaining objections involved specific suggestions on the substance of the Agreement \nand have been summarized for the Court.  (See ECF No. 160 (detailing, among others, objections \nregarding duration of Agreement and categories of persons fast-tracked for discretionary release \nconsideration).)  Some, while considered, had to give way to competing concerns or practicality \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 26 of 33\nconsiderations.    For  example,  given  the  uncertainties  around  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and \nfrequently changing conditions on the ground, Plaintiffs’ counsel was cognizant of barring future \nindividual or systemic litigation for non-monetary relief, and wanted to do so for the shortest \npossible period of time.  Cf. W. v. City of New York, 2016 WL 4367969, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. \n12, 2016) (finding injunctive consent decree unfair and unreasonable based, in part, on “the \nextraordinary length of time for which the parties propose to bar further systemic litigation”).  To \nthis  end,  the  Agreement  balances  the  need  to  get  specific,  expert-recommended  mitigation \nmeasures in place in the near-future, with the desire not to stand in the way of class members’ \nability to pursue other remedial litigation.  Similarly, DOC does not have a system-wide listing of \neach person’s specific health conditions, and therefore no obvious way to systemically review \neveryone in custody for chronic health conditions posing COVID-19 risk.  Using DOC medical \nrisk scores as a stand-in for health conditions posing COVID-19 risk, while admittedly imperfect, \nis an efficient way to determine who might warrant priority consideration for discretionary relief \non the basis of medical vulnerability.   \nFinally, while other specific suggestions contained in the objections were well-taken—in \nparticular,  prioritizing  a  greater  range  of  people  for  discretionary  release  consideration,  or \nmandating release of certain class members, particularly the medically vulnerable—they were \nsimply not achievable through the hard-fought negotiation process.  Given the substantial risks of \nmoving forward with this case, as detailed below, these modifications do not outweigh the \nsignificant argument for approving the Agreement.  See, e.g., Charron v. Wiener, 731 F.3d 241, \n254 (2d Cir. 2013) (upholding approval of settlement agreement notwithstanding that the scope of \nrelief “leaves much to be desired from the standpoint of” certain class members” given the greater \ncontext and risks of pursuing the class’ claims); see also Riker v. Gibbons, 2010 WL 4366012, at \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 27 of 33\n*7 (D. Nev. Oct. 28, 2010) (approving settlement for injunctive relief in prison medical suit, over \nclass member objections, because “[a]n adverse decision on the merits of plaintiffs’ claims would \nresult in not only denial of declaratory relief, but would deprive plaintiffs of the relief guaranteed \nby the settlement agreement, to wit, improvement in ESP’s delivery of medical care”). \nc.  The Amount of Discovery Completed Was Substantial and Allowed the \nParties to Sufficiently Investigate the Claims in This Case \n  Given the extraordinary circumstances of this case, the third factor, the stage of the \nproceedings and amount of discovery completed, weighs heavily in favor of approval.  When \nweighing this factor, the Court “need not find that the parties have engaged in extensive discovery. \n. . .  Instead, it is enough for the parties to have engaged in sufficient investigation of the facts to \nenable the Court to intelligently make an appraisal of the Settlement.”  In re Austrian & German \nBank Holocaust Litig., 80 F.Supp.2d at 176 (internal quotations and citations omitted). \nBetween April 20 and June 6, 2020, the parties engaged in substantial discovery on an \naccelerated schedule.  Among other things, the parties: \n•  Conducted  the  depositions  of  Defendant  Commissioner  Cook  and  Dr.  Byron \nKennedy, Defendants’ proffered expert witness; \n•  Exchanged expert witness declarations; \n•  Conducted depositions of two plaintiff experts, Dr. Joe Goldenson (correctional \nhealth) and Dr. Robert Murphy (infectious diseases); \n•  Engaged in formal written discovery, including propounding and responding to \ndozens of interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission, as \nwell as informal discovery; \n•  Exchanged hundreds of pages of documents over multiple productions; and \n•  Exchanged witness and exhibit lists ahead of a preliminary injunction hearing; \nAs this Court is aware, the parties worked around the clock for six weeks to discover as \nmuch information as they could and efficiently assess the claims and defenses to prepare for the \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 28 of 33\npreliminary injunction hearing.  Plaintiffs requested and reviewed information about policies in \nplace to halt the spread of COVID-19 in DOC facilities, descriptions of those facilities and \ninformation  about  population  density,  and  deposed  Commissioner  Cook  in  real  time  about \nevolving standards by which the DOC attempted to implement measures to contain the virus.  The \nparties questioned expert witnesses on the central topics in this case, including the transmission of \nthe virus, what should be done to prevent infection, and why correctional facilities are uniquely \nconducive to its spread.  There is no question that this intensive discovery process was “sufficiently \nadversarial that [it is] not designed to justify a settlement . . .  [,but] an aggressive effort to ferret \nout facts helpful to the prosecution of the suit.”  Martens v. Smith Barney, Inc., 181 F.R.D. 243, \n263 (S.D.N.Y. 1998).  Thus, this factor weighs heavily in favor of approval.   \nd.  The  Risks  of  Establishing  Liability  Are  High  and  Could  Prevent  a \nSufficient Mitigation Response to COVID-19 \n  The risks of establishing liability also weigh in favor of approval.  The primary risk is that \nPlaintiffs do not establish liability on their allegations that conditions of Connecticut prisons during \nthe COVID-19 pandemic violate their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  As discussed \nabove in Section II.a., Plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that COVID-19 poses an objective \nthreat  to  human  health;  that  Defendants’  knowledge,  actions,  and  inaction  demonstrates  a \ndeliberate indifference to the Plaintiffs’ welfare; and, for the pre-trial detainee plaintiffs, whether \nthe conditions in the DOC facilities bears no rational relationship to a legitimate governmental \nobjective.  Establishing liability on these issues typically is a very high bar.  Here, Plaintiffs are \naware that they would encounter difficulty establishing that Defendants showed a deliberate \nindifference to Plaintiffs’ welfare and/or medical need in light of the piecemeal mitigation that \nDOC did implement (though those measures varied widely across facilities) and deposition \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 29 of 33\ntestimony from Commissioner Cook that he was taking the pandemic seriously and was making \nreal efforts to take actions to the best of the DOC’s capabilities. \nA second risk of establishing liability lies in the formidable obstacles any prisoner, or class \nof incarcerated people, faces in attempting to assert constitutional rights through litigation.  It is a \nsad reality that “prisoners have not fared well at trial,” Ingles, 438 F. Supp. 2d at 213, whether in \nthis Circuit or elsewhere.  As with most prison cases, Plaintiffs’ case rests on testimony from class \nmembers—i.e, incarcerated people who, in this case, would have to testify remotely from various \nfacilities.  While Plaintiffs’ counsel is confident that class members would be testifying truthfully \nand accurately about the conditions in their respective facilities, as the parties prepared for a \npreliminary injunction hearing, the challenges of not being able to present live, in-person testimony \nfrom class members became apparent.  Coupled with the credibility issues incarcerated people are \nfaced with any time they testify, and the contradictory testimony Defendants submitted (and \nintended to present), the hill to establishing liability becomes that much steeper.  \nA final risk of establishing liability is the shifting factual and legal landscape.  The state of \nthe pandemic, along with the state of DOC facilities, changed day-to-day and even hour-to-hour \nover the course of this litigation.  Changes within DOC, in particular, often appeared to be in \nresponse to allegations made or declarations filed in this litigation (and Defendant Cook testified \nto that effect).  Each time Plaintiffs built their case, the facts on the ground would change (e.g., \nDefendants were sending people who had tested positive to Northern, then they were not; testing \nwas not widely available in Connecticut, then it was; class members did not have access to masks, \nthen they did, then they did not).  The rapid shifts in the facts, in the national case law, and even \nin the science (for example, whether there is aerosolized transmission of COVID-19) create a \nmoving target for proving liability that significantly increases Plaintiffs’ burden and risk.     \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 30 of 33\nGiven these considerations, there is a real risk that Plaintiffs will not prevail on liability \nbefore a jury.  That result would foreclose the possibility of implementing the kind of mitigation \nmeasures across all facilities provided for in the Agreement.  This, again, is a huge risk of \nestablishing liability that weighs in favor of approval.  Finally, as we have all painfully learned \nover the last several months, a delayed response to COVID-19 greatly increases the risk of \ntransmission and puts people at risk.  Protracted and uncertain litigation would not have served the \nbest interests and the health of the class members.    \ne.  The Risks of Establishing Damages and Obtaining Relief Also Are High \nand Weigh in Favor of Approval \nLikewise, there is a substantial risk of establishing damages and obtaining relief at trial.  \nAs this Court has seen, the proposed Agreement provides very specific requirements for mitigating \nthe spread of COVID-19 within the facilities, which is crucial to saving lives both in DOC and the \nwider Connecticut community.  The parties drafted the proposal with input from public health \nexperts on both sides.  Based on this input, the Agreement contains precise requirements for \nmeasures such as testing, quarantining, and distribution of masks and soap.  The Agreement also \ntakes into account the fact that guidelines for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 are rapidly \nchanging.  In the absence of an independent monitoring panel, there would be no way to assess \nwhether, for example, hygienic practices continually conformed to current CDC guidelines.  Given \nthe scope of the proposed settlement agreement and the important public health considerations \nguiding it, it is apparent that the risks of obtaining relief at trial, which would not allow the parties \nto negotiate these important issues on a granular level, would be high. \nMoreover, given the rapidly evolving public health crisis and the grave risk of death to \nthose who contract COVID-19, it is critical that “implementation of these measures will begin \nimmediately.”  Ingles, 438 F. Supp. 2d at 214.  So “[e]ven if plaintiffs were to prevail on liability \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 31 of 33\nat trial, the process of litigating the scope of relief and the details thereof surely would have taken \nmonths.”  Id.  But months of “litigating the scope of relief” would be too late:  without immediate \nmitigation measures, the virus surely will spread throughout DOC facilities not only to inmates, \nbut to employees, and those in the broader Connecticut community with whom employees come \nin contact.  This is a significant risk none of the parties would like to take.  \nFinally,  the  Medically  Vulnerable  Subclasses  would  have  a  particular  challenge  in \nobtaining  relief.    Because  many  of  these  class  members’  status  as  Medically  Vulnerable \nnecessitates that they establish a certain preexisting health condition, it would be expected that \nDefendants would comb through those class members’ medical records to dispute their Medically \nVulnerable status, as they did in the CCDLA suit.  This type of review can devolve into a battle of \nexperts and likely preclude relief for some Medically Vulnerable subclass members who actually \nneed it depending on how a jury credits expert testimony about whether records establish a \npreexisting condition.  See, e.g., In re Am. Bank Note Holographics, Inc., 127 F.Supp.2d 418, 426–\n27 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (discussing the risk of establishing damages where this aspect of trial would \ninvolve a “battle of the experts” and uncertainty about how a jury may be swayed by one expert or \nanother).  This is on top of the need to show that these conditions mandate release, whether through \na habeas theory or a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 theory (which could, potentially, entail additional PLRA \nbars).  Thus, because the risks of establishing damages and obtaining relief is high, this factor also \nweighs in favor of approving the settlement.   \nf.  As Approval Would Remove the Need for Plaintiffs to Continually Defend \nthe Class Form, the Final Applicable Grinnell Factor Counsels Granting It \nPlaintiffs also face sufficient risks in maintaining their class certification through a final \njudgment in this litigation, such that a resolution is preferable.  Plaintiffs remain confident that the \nclass did and does satisfy the Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) prerequisites, yet Defendants could conceivably \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 32 of 33\ncontest the class on the basis of their being spread across fourteen different prisons with their own \narchitecture, capacity, and infection rates.  Additionally, as with so many facets of their lives while \nimprisoned, Plaintiffs are not in control of facts that could tend to cause the Defendants to \neventually claim a lack of standing if the infection numbers and declining prison population nearly \nconverged.  Or, Defendants could continue to attempt to pick off named Plaintiffs by arranging for \nrelease through one of the discretionary programs they control.  Whatever the ultimate outcome of \nsuch arguments, approval of a resolution at this stage removes the effort and duration of the \nPlaintiffs’ having to overcome challenges to their class form.  See deMunecas v. Bold Food, LLC, \n2010 WL 3322580, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 23, 2010) (holding that the Grinnell class risk factor \npoints towards approval where granting it would “eliminate[] the risk, expense, and delay inherent \nin” a either contested certification or a later motion for decertification).  The Court should \naccordingly conclude that the sixth Grinnell factor points towards approval. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the forgoing reasons, this Court should grant this motion and approve the parties’ \nproposed Settlement Agreement.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169   Filed 07/17/20   Page 33 of 33\n \nRespectfully submitted,    \n/s/ Will W.

On April 7, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, along with a memorandum of law\nin support. FN3Thereafter, on April 8, 2020, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which adds Kerri\nDirgo and Joshua Wilcox as additional plaintiffs, and which includes additional allegations and changes\nto some previous allegations. FN4\nIn the amended complaint, the plaintiffs ask the court to issue a writ of mandamus compelling the\ndefendants to (a) “immediately release all people having the CDC heightened risk factors for serious\nillness or death from COVID-19, to an appropriate medical facility where necessary”; (b) “immediately\nand meaningfully reduce the population density at each and every facility in which they confine people”;\n(c) “submit for the court’s review and ongoing monitoring a plan: (1) to provide adequate sanitation and\nsocial distancing in prisons so as\nto prevent the spread of COVID-19, including by taking all measures for screening, cleaning, hygiene\nand social distancing that the CDC recommends for correctional facilities; (2) to diagnose and treat\npeople showing symptoms of COVID-19 in accordance with contemporary standards of care, (3) to\napprove, within seven days, community or private residences to those qualified for release to such via\n[General Statutes] § 18-100, (4) to approve, within seven days, residences for any prisoner or detainee\nwho is now eligible for release but for the defendant’s approval of a residence, and (5) to sufficiently\nfund transitional housing for the duration of the pandemic; and (d) undertake any other task necessary to\ndischarge their duties to those in their custody during the pandemic, including by working with other\narms of state government to expedite their handling of requests for release, and ensuring consideration\nof relief for all incarcerated people who can safely return to their communities.”\nThe defendants assert in their motion to dismiss that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this\naction on the basis that the defendant CCDLA lacks standing because it fails the classical aggrievement\ntest and because it cannot assert third party standing on behalf of the individual plaintiffs. They also\nassert that the individual plaintiffs lack standing because they do not have any right to be released prior\nto the end of their lawful sentences and because their constitutional claims are based on alleged injuries\nthat are too speculative. The defendants also assert that the plaintiffs’ claims are nonjusticiable political\nquestions. Finally, the defendants contend that the plaintiffs’ request for the court to order the defendants\nto submit a plan for the court’s review is barred by sovereign immunity to the extent that such a plan\ncalls for the defendants to sufficiently fund transitional housing for the duration of the pandemic because\nsuch a plan would amount to an award of damages from the state, which has not consented to be sued.\nOn April 13, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion and the defendants\nfiled a reply, along with a declaration of Cary Freston. Arguments on this motion were heard before this\ncourt on the record on April 15, 2020. Counsel for all parties participated by telephone.\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 1 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169-1   Filed 07/17/20   Page 3 of 10\nDISCUSSION\n“[A] motion to dismiss . . . properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the\nplaintiff cannot as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court.”\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.)

Burton v.\nDominion Nuclear Connecticut, Inc., 300 Conn. 542, 550, 23 A.3d 1176 (2011).\n“It is well established that [a] party must have standing to assert a claim in order for the court to have\nsubject matter jurisdiction over the claim. . . . Standing is the legal right to set judicial machinery in\nmotion. One cannot rightfully invoke the jurisdiction of the court unless he has, in an individual or\nrepresentative capacity, some real interest in the cause of action, or a legal or equitable right, title or\ninterest in the subject matter of the controversy. . . . [Our Supreme Court] has often stated that the\nquestion of subject matter jurisdiction, because it addresses the basic competency of the court, can be\nraised by any of the parties, or by the court sua sponte, at any time. . . . Where a party is found to lack\nstanding, the court is consequently without subject matter jurisdiction to determine the cause. . . .\n“Standing is no mere procedural technicality. As the United States Supreme Court has explained, ‘[t]he\npower to declare the rights of individuals and to measure the authority of governments . . . is legitimate\nonly in the last resort, and as a necessity in the determination of real, earnest and vital controversy.’ . . .\nValley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S.\n464, 471, 102 S. Ct. 752, 70 L. Ed. 2d 700 (1982). As a result, ‘[t]he exercise of judicial power, which\ncan so profoundly affect the lives, liberty, and property of those to whom it extends, is therefore\nrestricted to litigants who can show [an injury] resulting from the action which they seek to have the\ncourt adjudicate.’ . . . Id., 473. The standing requirement further evinces a proper regard for the judicial\nbranch’s relationship with coequal branches of government under our constitutional structure. Thus, ‘[i]t\nis the role of courts to provide relief to claimants, in individual or class actions, who have suffered, or\nwill imminently suffer, actual harm; it is not the role of courts, but that of the political branches, to shape\nthe institutions of government in such fashion as to comply with the laws and the Constitution.’ Lewis v.\nCasey, 518 U.S. 343, 349, 116 S. Ct. 2174, 135 L. Ed. 2d 606 (1996).” (Citations omitted; footnotes\nomitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Johnson v. Rell, 119 Conn. App. 730, 735–37, 990 A.2d 354\n(2010).\nThe defendants argue that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiffs lack standing\nto pursue their claims in this mandamus action. In support of their position, they argue that none of the\nplaintiffs are classically aggrieved because they have not alleged any direct injury. They also maintain\nthat the plaintiffs have failed to allege facts to meet the other standing requirements applicable to each of\nthe plaintiffs.\n1. Associational Standing as to the CCDLA\nWith regard to the CCDLA, the defendants first argue that the CCDLA lacks standing because the\ncomplaint sets forth no allegations of any injury to the CCDLA or its members; the plaintiffs allege only\npotential injury to some clients of its members. They further maintain that the CCDLA cannot\nsuccessfully assert associational standing because such standing requires the plaintiffs to allege that the\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 2 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169-1   Filed 07/17/20   Page 4 of 10\nCCDLA has suffered or will suffer some direct injury in its own right. They note that no such allegations\nare included in the complaint. In opposition, the plaintiffs argue that the CCDLA may avail itself of\nassociational standing to bring this action on behalf of its members because they meet the requirements\nfor such standing. Specifically, they maintain that its members suffer an injury in fact and therefore\nwould otherwise have standing to maintain this action in their own right because they face the threat of\ncoronavirus infection when visiting their clients who are “cycling in and out of DOC custody.” They\nfurther assert that the interests they seek to protect are germane to the CCDLA’s purpose, which is to\nsupport its members in their defense of people accused of violating the law. Finally, they assert that\nparticipation of the individual members would not be required. In their reply, the defendants assert that\nthe plaintiffs’ assertions of injury in their memorandum in opposition are not a substitute for allegations\nin their operative complaint, which do not allege any such injuries, and argue that the CCDLA members\nhave no rights under the eighth or fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and are not\nrequired to enter prisons to represent their clients. They also argue that because the plaintiffs do not\nallege that CCDLA members represent inmates in any actions asserting conditions of confinement\nclaims, they fail to satisfy the “germaneness” prong of the associational standing test.\nThe court agrees with the defendants that the plaintiffs have not alleged facts demonstrating that the\nCCDLA meets the requirements for such standing. Specifically, the plaintiffs have not alleged that the\nCCDLA or any of its members have suffered any injury. In the amended complaint, the plaintiffs allege\nthat the CCDLA “is a nonprofit Connecticut organization comprising lawyers who represent people\naccused of crimes in the state,” it “has approximately 300 members statewide,” “[i]ts members represent\nclients held in each of the facilities controlled by the Connecticut Department of Correction,” and it\n“engages in education and advocacy for the fair treatment of those accused of crimes, and for positive\nchanges in Connecticut’s criminal and motor vehicle code,” and “also serves as an amicus curiae to\nConnecticut’s appellate courts.” (Amended complaint, entry #114, ¶¶ 1-4.) The CCDLA is not\nmentioned in anywhere else in the complaint, and these allegations fail to assert that it has suffered or\nwill suffer any direct injury.\n“An organization may file suit on its own behalf ‘to seek judicial relief from injury to itself and to\nvindicate whatever rights and immunities the organization itself may enjoy.’ Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S.\n490, 511, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 45 L. Ed. 2d 343 (1975). In order to do so, however, an organization must\nsatisfy the constitutional minimum of standing by demonstrating an ‘injury in fact’; a causal connection\nbetween the injury and the conduct of which the party complains; and that it is ‘likely’ a favorable\ndecision will provide redress.” Juvenile Matters Trial Lawyers Assn. v. Judicial Dept., 363 F. Supp. 2d\n239, 244 (D. Conn. 2005). Without any allegation of an injury in fact to the CCDLA, it fails to meet the\nrequirements of associational standing. In Juvenile Matters Trial Lawyers Assn. v. Judicial Dept., supra,\n363 F. Supp. 2d 245, an organization of attorneys who provided legal services to juveniles and their\nfamilies brought an action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against the Judicial Department and\nseveral individual defendants. In opposing a motion to dismiss asserting lack of standing, the plaintiff\nargued that it had standing to bring this action in its own right, on behalf of its members, and on behalf\nof the clients represented by the member attorneys. As in the present case, the complaint in that case did\nnot include any allegation of injury to the association itself. Accordingly, the District Court determined\nthat the plaintiff lacked standing to bring the action on its own behalf in that action. That same reason\napplies here. As the plaintiffs have not alleged any injury to the CCDLA, it lacks standing to assert any\nclaim on its own behalf.\nMoreover, any injury on behalf of the CCDLA that might be inferred from the complaint would be too\nindirect to demonstrate the CCDLA’s standing because any such injury would be suffered by individual\nclients of individual members of the CCDLA. In Connecticut State Medical Society v. Oxford Health\nPlans (CT), Inc., 272 Conn. 469, 481–82, 863 A.2d 645 (2005), the plaintiff had argued that it had\nsufficiently alleged an injury suffered by the plaintiff in that it alleged that its members had suffered\ninjury by the defendant’s failure to make timely and complete payments to those members, which, in\nturn, resulted in the plaintiff suffering injury because the defendants’ actions caused the plaintiff to\nexpend resources and to suffer a reduction in revenue from its members. The court upheld the trial\ncourt’s decision dismissing the action for lack of standing because the plaintiff’s injuries “derive solely\nand exclusively from the harm allegedly visited upon the plaintiff’s members by the defendant. In other\nwords, none of the harm that the plaintiff allegedly suffered as a result of the defendant’s conduct is\ndirect.” (Emphasis in original.) Id., 479. As the defendants in the present case correctly note, the injuries\nasserted in this case are one step further removed; any injuries would affect the inmates, not the CCDLA\nor its members. For this reason as well, the CCDLA does not have associational standing.\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 3 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169-1   Filed 07/17/20   Page 5 of 10\n2. Third Party Standing of the CCDLA\nThe court must next address whether the plaintiffs’ allegations support the plaintiffs’ argument that the\nCCDLA has third party standing to assert claims on behalf of third party inmates. The defendants assert\nthat the CCDLA cannot assert third party standing on behalf of inmates because the three requirements\nfor such standing are not satisfied in the present case. Specifically, they argue that the complaint sets\nforth no allegation of an injury suffered by the CCDLA or its members, that the CCDLA’s relationship\nwith the third party inmates is not sufficiently close, and that there is no hindrance to the third parties’\nability to protect their own interests.\nThe plaintiffs counter that the CCDLA satisfies the requirements for third party standing, specifically\nthat the CCDLA’s relationship with third party inmates is sufficiently close and that there is a hindrance\nto the third party inmates’ ability to protect their own interests. The plaintiffs do not directly address the\ndefendants’ argument that the CCDLA fails to allege an injury to itself for purposes of third party\nstanding, but contend that members of the public may bring mandamus actions to enforce a public right\npursuant to Practice Book § 23-45 (a) FN5 without the need to demonstrate any interest in the outcome\nof the matter. Moreover, they maintain, the CCDLA is in a better position to represent the interests of its\nmembers’ clients than the individual inmates themselves because of the limited resources available to\nthe courts to review the petitions of numerous individual inmates seeking to obtain release due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nThe United States Supreme Court has “recognized the right of litigants to bring actions on behalf of\nthird parties, provided three important criteria are satisfied: The litigant must have suffered an ‘injury in\nfact,’ thus giving him or her a ‘sufficiently concrete interest’ in the outcome of the issue in dispute . . .\nthe litigant must have a close relation to the third party . . . and there must exist some hindrance to the\nthird party’s ability to protect his or her own interests.” (Citations omitted.) Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S.\n400, 410–11, 111 S. Ct. 1364, 113 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1991); see also State v. Bradley, 195 Conn. App. 36,\n51, 223 A.3d 62 (2019) (listing “injury” as one of three requirements that must be satisfied in order to\nbring actions on behalf of third parties), cert. granted on other grounds, 334 Conn. 925, 223 A.3d 379\n(2020).\nAs discussed elsewhere in this decision with regard to associational standing, the plaintiffs have not\nalleged any injury to the CCDLA or its members. As such an injury is required in order to bring a claim\non behalf of third parties, the plaintiffs’ claim of third party standing as to the CCDLA fails. Moreover,\nthe plaintiffs’ contention that such an injury or direct interest is not required where a plaintiff brings a\nmandamus action to enforce a public right is unpersuasive. Practice Book § 23-45 (a) provides: “An\naction of mandamus may be brought in an individual right by any person who claims entitlement to that\nremedy to enforce a private duty owed to that person, or by any state’s attorney to enforce a public\nduty.” (Emphasis added.) The CCDLA is alleged to be an association of criminal defense attorneys, not\nstate’s attorneys. The one Connecticut case cited by the plaintiffs in support of their position, State ex\nrel. E. Color Printing Co. v. Jenks, 150 Conn. 444, 190 A.2d 591 (1963), was brought by a state’s\nattorney and is therefore inapposite. Although it is therefore not necessary to address the other\nrequirements of third party standing, the court further notes that the plaintiffs’ contention that it meets\nthe third requirement, that the third parties must be hindered in protecting their own rights, is belied by\nthe fact that the individual plaintiffs in this action are members of the group whose interests the CCDLA\nseeks to protect. For all of these reasons, the CCDLA lacks standing to assert claims on behalf of third\nparties in this action. Accordingly, the motion is granted and the action is dismissed with regard to the\nCCDLA.\n2. Standing: Individual Plaintiffs\nThe court next turns to the issue of whether the individual plaintiffs have standing to maintain this\naction. The defendants argue that the individual plaintiffs lack standing because they have not alleged\nany injury as they do not have any right to be released before the end of their sentences. They maintain\nthat the individual plaintiffs have no statutory right to early release and that the statutes providing for\nearly release provide discretion to the executive officials charged with carrying out their provisions. In\nsupport, they further argue that the eighth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution\ndo not provide a remedy for the individual plaintiffs because they do not provide for early release; rather,\nthey relate to deliberate indifference to health and safety and the provision of medical care. They further\nmaintain that the risk of harm posed by the individual plaintiffs remaining incarcerated is too speculative\nto support the plaintiffs’ claims. Finally, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs’ failure to allege that the\ndefendants have the requisite level of mental culpability for purposes of a deliberate indifference claim\ndeprives them of standing.\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 4 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169-1   Filed 07/17/20   Page 6 of 10\nIn opposition, the plaintiffs counter that the defendants’ knowledge of the dangers of COVID-19, and the\ndefendants’ failure to take appropriate measures to prevent its spread in their facilities, amount to an\neighth and fourteenth amendment violation because the individual plaintiffs’ conditions of confinement\nare likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering. They argue that they have alleged the\ndefendants’ deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs’ exposure to COVID-19 by their failure to take\nadequate steps to prevent exposure to the virus. Moreover, the plaintiffs maintain, their allegations\npertaining to the defendants’ mental state are adequate because they need only to have alleged that the\ndefendants acted “recklessly” with regard to the safety of the individual plaintiffs who have been\nsentenced and that the defendants knew or should have known of the excessive risk to health or safety\nwith regard to the individual plaintiffs who have not yet been sentenced. The plaintiffs further argue that\nclaims of deliberate indifference do not require the plaintiffs already to have been exposed to the risk of\ninfection. They maintain that the complaint adequately alleges that people incarcerated in DOC facilities\nare held in conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm. Finally, the plaintiffs argue that their\ninjuries are redressible by this court without regard to whether a particular statute or administrative\nscheme establishes a remedy to address the risks posed by the COVID-19 crisis and that, even if the\ncourt were limited only to the remedies already provided by the executive and legislative branches, the\ndefendants already have the authority “to alter every existing textual form of relief such that their\nfeigned helplessness divests them of a defense.” Essentially, the plaintiffs argue that the court has broad\ndiscretion to structure appropriate relief in this mandamus action such that the plaintiffs have injuries\nthat are redressible in this action.\nAs a threshold matter, the court rejects the defendants’ argument that the issue of whether the individual\nplaintiffs have a right to be released from custody is dispositive of the issue of whether they have\nstanding to maintain this action. Although the defendants have cited federal case law stating that “if the\nplaintiff’s claim has no foundation in law, he has no legally protected interest and thus no standing to\nsue”; Claybrook v. Slater, 111 F.3d 904, 907 (D.C. Cir. 1997); research reveals no appellate authority in\nConnecticut applying the concept of standing that broadly. To the contrary, our Supreme Court has\nconsistently retained a distinction between standing and the plaintiff’s “legal interests.” “The\nfundamental aspect of [statutory] standing . . . [is that] it focuses on the party seeking to get his\ncomplaint before [the] court and not on the issues he wishes to have adjudicated. . . . When standing is\nput in issue, the question is whether the person whose standing is challenged is a proper party to request\nan adjudication of the issue and not whether the controversy is otherwise justiciable, or whether, on the\nmerits, the plaintiff has a legally protected interest that the defendant’s action has invaded. . . . The\nconcepts of standing and legal interest are to be distinguished. The legal interest test goes to the merits,\nwhereas standing concerns the question whether the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is\narguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional\nguarantee in question.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Lazar v. Ganim, 334 Conn. 73, 85–86, 220\nA.3d 18 (2019), quoting Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, Inc. v. Gill, 175 Conn. 483, 491–92, 400 A.2d\n726 (1978). Accordingly, the court will not grant the defendants’ motion on ground that the plaintiffs\nhave no injury simply because they have no right to be released from custody. Nevertheless, the court\nmust consider whether the plaintiffs otherwise have failed to allege an injury as a result of the\ndefendants’ handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n“An allegation of injury is both fundamental and essential to a demonstration of standing. Under\nConnecticut law, standing requires no more than a colorable claim of injury; a plaintiff ordinarily\nestablishes his standing by allegations of injury. . . . As long as there is some direct injury for which the\nplaintiff seeks redress, the injury that is alleged need not be great. . . . Furthermore, an allegation of\ninjury is a prerequisite under federal law to the maintenance of an action under § 1983. See, e.g.,\nColombo v. O’Connell, 310 F.3d 115, 117 (2d Cir. 2002) (‘[t]o state a claim under [§] 1983, a plaintiff\nmust allege facts indicating that some official action has caused the plaintiff to be deprived of his or her\nconstitutional rights—in other words, there is an injury requirement to state the claim’), cert. denied, 538\nU.S. 961, 123 S. Ct. 1750, 155 L. Ed.2d 512 (2003); Ciambriello v. County of Nassau, 292 F.3d 307,\n323 (2d Cir. 2002) (‘[i]n order to state a claim under § 1983, a plaintiff must allege that he was injured\nby either a state actor or a private party acting under color of state law’).” (Emphasis in original;\nfootnotes omitted.) Johnson v. Rell, supra, 119 Conn. App. 735–38.\n“The eighth amendment, which applies to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth\namendment to the United States constitution . . . prohibits detention in a manner that constitutes cruel\nand unusual punishment. . . . Cruel and unusual punishment refers to punishment that involves the\nunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain or is grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime. . . .\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 5 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169-1   Filed 07/17/20   Page 7 of 10\nUnder the eighth amendment, prison officials must ensure that inmates receive adequate food, clothing,\nshelter, and medical care, and must take reasonable measures to guarantee the safety of the inmates . . .\n.” (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Fuller v. Commissioner of Correction, 75 Conn.\nApp. 133, 136, 815 A.2d 208 (2003).\n“In challenging the conditions of confinement, the prisoner must meet two requirements. First, the\nalleged deprivation of adequate conditions must be objectively, sufficiently serious . . . such that the\npetitioner was denied ‘the minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities . . . .’ . . . Wilson v. Seiter, 501\nU.S. 294, 298, 111 S. Ct. 2321, 115 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1991). Second, the official involved must have had a\nsufficiently culpable state of mind described as ‘deliberate indifference’ to inmate health or safety.\nFarmer v. Brennan, [511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994)]. In that context,\nsubjective deliberate indifference means that ‘a prison official cannot be found liable under the [e]ighth\n[a]mendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official knows of and\ndisregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety . . . .’ Id., 837. (Citations omitted; internal\nquotation marks omitted.) Fuller v. Commissioner of Correction, supra, 75 Conn. App. 136–37.\nIn the present case, the plaintiffs have not alleged facts satisfying these two requirements. First, the\nplaintiffs have not alleged facts showing that the defendants have deprived the plaintiffs of the minimal\ncivilized measure of life’s necessities by failing to release a sufficient number of prisoners from\nconfinement in order to mitigate the risk of the spread of infection. Although Helling v. McKinney, 509\nU.S. 25, 113 S. Ct. 2475, 125 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1993), supports the plaintiffs’ position that exposure to\nfuture harm can present an eighth amendment violation, the facts of that case are distinguishable from\nthose alleged in the present case. In Helling, the United States Supreme Court held that the plaintiff in\nthat case stated a cause of action under the eighth amendment by alleging that prison officials “have,\nwith deliberate indifference, exposed [the plaintiff inmate] to levels of [environmental tobacco smoke]\nthat pose an unreasonable risk of serious damage to his future health.” Id., 35. Although the court held\nthat the fact that the plaintiff had not yet suffered any adverse health consequences from his exposure to\nsmoke was not fatal to his claim, the plaintiff had asserted that he was presently and directly exposed to\nthe dangerous condition, in that he was presently being exposed to smoke by being forced to share a cell\nwith another prisoner who was smoking five packs of cigarettes per day. Id., 28. In the present case, the\nplaintiffs have not alleged analogous facts. For example, the plaintiffs do not allege that any of them are\nhoused with or otherwise directly exposed to individuals with COVID-19. Rather, they allege that the\npreventative steps that the defendants have taken have not been and will not be adequate to address the\npandemic because the plaintiffs will be subjected to a heightened risk of exposure to the coronavirus in\nthe future as a result of inadequate steps taken to mitigate the risks.\nEven assuming, arguendo, that the conditions to which the plaintiffs are being or will be exposed do rise\nto the level of a “serious risk to health or safety,” the plaintiffs have not alleged facts to satisfy the\nsecond requirement, that is, to show that the defendants have acted or will act with “deliberate\nindifference” to the risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. To the contrary, the plaintiffs describe the\ndefendants’ conduct in the amended complaint as “commendable, but unfortunately insufficient to\ncomply with their constitutional and statutory obligation to ensure the safety of those in their custody.”\n(Amended complaint, entry #114, ¶ 92.) Allegations that the defendants’ actions have been or will be\n“insufficient” do not rise to the level of a conscious disregard of an excessive risk to inmate health or\nsafety.\n“The second requirement follows from the principle that only the unnecessary and wanton infliction of\npain implicates the Eighth Amendment. . . . To violate the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, a\nprison official must have a sufficiently culpable state of mind. . . . In prison-conditions cases that state of\nmind is one of ‘deliberate indifference’ to inmate health or safety . . . .” (Citations omitted; internal\nquotation marks omitted.) Farmer v. Brennan, supra, 511 U.S. 834. The United States Supreme Court\nhas explained that “deliberate indifference describes a state of mind more blameworthy than\nnegligence.” Id., 835. It further explained that this standard “requires more than ordinary lack of due\ncare for the prisoner’s interests or safety.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. “It is, indeed, fair to\nsay that acting or failing to act with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to a\nprisoner is the equivalent of recklessly disregarding that risk.” Id., 836. In further clarifying what is\nmeant by “recklessly” in this context, the court in Farmer explained that “a prison official cannot be\nfound liable under the Eighth Amendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement\nunless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must\nboth be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm\nexists, and he must also draw the inference.” (Emphasis added.) Id., 837. “The Eighth Amendment does\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 6 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169-1   Filed 07/17/20   Page 8 of 10\nnot outlaw cruel and unusual ‘conditions’; it outlaws cruel and unusual ‘punishments.’ An act or\nomission unaccompanied by knowledge of a significant risk of harm might well be something society\nwishes to discourage, and if harm does result society might well wish to assure compensation. The\ncommon law reflects such concerns when it imposes tort liability on a purely objective basis. . . . But an\nofficial’s failure to alleviate a significant risk that he should have perceived but did not, while no cause\nfor commendation, cannot under our cases be condemned as the infliction of punishment.” (Citations\nomitted.) Id., 837–38.\nIn the present case, the plaintiffs have not alleged facts demonstrating that the defendants had or have the\nrequisite mental state with respect to the risks identified in the complaint. Although the allegations in the\namended complaint do demonstrate that the defendants are aware of the seriousness of the risks posed\nby COVID-19 generally, the complaint does not allege facts demonstrating that the defendants are acting\nwith deliberate indifference with regard to those risks. Rather, the plaintiffs assert in their amended\ncomplaint that the defendants, in failing to release prisoners from confinement to reduce prison\npopulation density, have not done enough to protect inmates from the risk of infection. As the defendants\ncorrectly assert, these allegations sound in negligence, not recklessness. Our Supreme Court has\n“described recklessness as a state of consciousness with reference to the consequences of one’s acts. . . .\nIt is more than negligence, more than gross negligence. . . . The state of mind amounting to recklessness\nmay be inferred from conduct. But, in order to infer it, there must be something more than a failure to\nexercise a reasonable degree of watchfulness to avoid danger to others or to take reasonable precautions\nto avoid injury to them. . . . Wanton misconduct is reckless misconduct. . . . It is such conduct as\nindicates a reckless disregard of the just rights or safety of others or of the consequences of the action.”\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.) Matthiessen v. Vanech, 266 Conn. 822, 832–33, 836 A.2d 394\n(2003). As the allegations in the amended complaint do not sound in recklessness, the plaintiffs have\nfailed to allege an eighth amendment injury and, accordingly, the individual plaintiffs lack standing to\nmaintain this action.\nB\nPolitical Question Doctrine\nAlthough it is not necessary to reach the other grounds asserted in the defendants’ motion, as the court\nhas already determined that none of the plaintiffs have standing to maintain this action and it must,\ntherefore, be dismissed, the court will address the political question doctrine as an alternative basis for\nits decision. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs’ action presents nonjusticiable political questions\nand must be dismissed because the plaintiffs’ requests for relief in this mandamus action seek to impose\nthe judgment of the court in place of the discretion vested in coordinate branches of government. In\nessence, they contend that by seeking mandamus relief that would limit or override the discretion\notherwise vested in the legislative and executive branches of government, the plaintiffs’ action presents\nnonjusticiable political questions. The plaintiffs counter that the plaintiffs’ claims do not involve\npolitical questions because the court has the power to provide mandamus relief from reckless exposure\nto illness or death as a result of the spread of COVID-19 in their facilities. They maintain that enforcing\nthe protections of the United States constitution against cruel and unusual punishment is within this\ncourt’s authority. They argue that the defendants’ duty to safeguard the health and wellbeing of the\ninmates in custody are not discretionary. In response, the defendants further argue that the question of\nhow any violations of the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights would be rectified should be left to the\ndiscretion of the legislative and executive branches. They maintain that because the plaintiffs seek relief\nthat calls for the exercise of discretion by executive branch officials, and seeks no alternative relief such\nas a declaratory judgment that the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights are being violated, this case presents\nnonjusticiable political questions and must be dismissed.\n“The political question doctrine itself is based on the principle of separation of powers . . . as well as the\nnotion that the judiciary should not involve itself in matters that have been committed to the executive\nand legislative branches of government. . . . [I]n considering whether a particular subject matter presents\na nonjusticiable political question, we have articulated [six] relevant factors, including: a textually\ndemonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of\njudicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding\nwithout an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of\na court’s undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate\nbranches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already\nmade; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments\non one question. Unless one of these formulations is inextricable from the case at bar, there should be no\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 7 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169-1   Filed 07/17/20   Page 9 of 10\ndismissal for nonjusticiability on the ground of a political question’s presence.” (Citations omitted;\ninternal quotation marks omitted.) Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc. v. Rell,\n295 Conn. 240, 255-56, 990 A.2d 206 (2010).\nApplying these factors to the present case, the plaintiffs’ claims involve nonjusticiable political questions\nand should be dismissed for that reason as well. The plaintiffs seek mandamus relief compelling the\ndefendants to release inmates with heightened risk factors for COVID-19 to “to an appropriate medical\nfacility where necessary”; “immediately and meaningfully reduce the population density at each and\nevery facility in which they confine people” by taking specific steps specified by the plaintiffs in their\ncomplaint; and to “submit for the Court’s review and ongoing monitoring a plan” regarding certain\naspects of the defendants’ efforts to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, providing medical care to\ninmates, approval of residences for qualified inmates, and to sufficiently fund transitional housing for the\nduration of the pandemic; and to undertake other necessary tasks. If the court were to compel the\ndefendants to take these actions, such an order would necessarily be made without “judicially\ndiscoverable and manageable standards”; would not be possible “without an initial policy determination\nof a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion”; would not be possible “without expressing lack of the\nrespect due coordinate branches of government . . . .” See Id.\nAs the defendants correctly note, the statutes governing release and transfer of inmates in DOC custody\nprovide discretion to the executive branch officials with regard to the transfer or release of inmates. For\nexample, General Statutes § 18-100 (e) provides in relevant part that “the commissioner may transfer\nany person from one correctional institution to another or to any public or private nonprofit halfway\nhouse, group home or mental health facility or, after satisfactory participation in a residential program,\nto any approved community or private residence. . . .” (Emphasis added.) Similarly, General Statutes §\n18-100c provides that an inmates with a sentence of two years or less “may be released pursuant to\nsubsection (e) of section 18-100 or to any other community correction program approved by the\nCommissioner of Correction.” (Emphasis added.) General Statutes § 18-52a (a) provides in relevant\npart: “Any person committed to the custody of the Commissioner of Correction who is confined in a\ncorrectional facility and requires hospitalization for medical care may be transferred by the department\nto any hospital having facilities for such care. . . .” (Emphasis added.) These statutes necessarily entail\nthe use of discretion and judgment by the department of correction in determining whether to release or\ntransfer an inmate. Accordingly, application of the above factors indicates that the action should be\ndismissed based on the political question doctrine.\nBy contrast, in Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc., the court determined that\nthe plaintiffs’ claims in that case did not present a nonjusticiable political question. In reaching its\nconclusion, the court summarized the reasoning set forth in an earlier decision, Seymour v. Region One\nBoard of Education, 261 Conn. 475, 482–84, 803 A.2d 318 (2002). In both cases, the court relied, in\npart, on the forms of relief sought by the plaintiffs in determining that the case did not present a\nnonjusticiable political question. Specifically, it noted: “If we were to construe the complaint as\nrequesting only that a court, having determined that the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims are meritorious,\norder the [school] district to establish itself as a taxing district, and set the taxing powers and standards\nsuggested by the plaintiffs, we would have grave doubts about the justiciability of the claim, as the\ndefendant suggests. In that case, it is very likely that the claim would fall within one or more of the\ncategories of nonjusticiability.” Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc. v. Rell,\nsupra, 295 Conn. 261. The court further explained: “Although the plaintiffs do seek, in part, such an\norder from the court, and although the text of the complaint presents such a remedy as the only way to\nvindicate the plaintiffs’ rights, a separate prayer for relief is simply ‘[t]hat judgment be entered declaring\nthat . . . [General Statutes] § 10–51 (b) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied by [the board].’” Id.\nIt further explained: “This latter prayer for relief is susceptible of an interpretation that would leave the\nformulation of the appropriate remedy to the legislative branch, rather than requiring the judicial branch\nto entangle itself in what probably would be the nonjudicial function of establishing a taxing district.\nFurthermore, there is precedent for this court, having determined that a particular legislative scheme is\nunconstitutional, to leave the remedy to the legislative branch, at least initially. . . . We, therefore,\nconsider the question of justiciability on the premise that the plaintiffs seek a declaration of the\nunconstitutionality of § 10–51 (b), with the remedy that they propose to be considered by the legislative\nbranch.” Id., 261-62.\nApplying this reasoning to the present action yields a different result. In the present case, the plaintiffs’\nprayers for relief leave no room for an interpretation that the plaintiffs seek a mere declaration as to the\nconstitutionality of the defendants’ actions with respect to the COVID-19 crisis. Although the plaintiffs’\nUWYCV206054309S    4/24/2020 Page 8 of 9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 169-1   Filed 07/17/20   Page 10 of 10\nclaims would depend, in part, on a determination that the individual plaintiffs’ constitutional rights are\nbeing violated, the plaintiffs do not seek declaratory relief. They ask that the court order mandamus\nrelief, specifically the release and relocation of inmates and the reduction in prison populations.\nMoreover, the nature of the action itself, mandamus, demonstrates that the nature of relief sought in this\naction is to compel specific actions on the part of the defendants, actions that are governed by statutes\ngranting the defendants discretion with regard to how to carry out their responsibilities. Accordingly, this\naction presents nonjusticiable political questions and must be dismissed.\nC\nSovereign Immunity\nWith regard to the defendants’ sovereign immunity argument, the motion will not be granted on that\nbasis. “The Supreme Court . . . has taught that sovereign immunity is not invoked simply because\nprospective injunctive relief ultimately results in a diminution of state funds.” In re Dairy Mart\nConvenience Stores, Inc., 411 F.3d 367, 375 (2d Cir. 2005), citing Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651,\n668, 94 S. Ct. 1347, 39 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1974) (although state officials, “in order to shape their official\nconduct to the mandate of the Court’s decrees, would more likely have to spend money from the state\ntreasury than if they had been left free to pursue their previous course of conduct” such “an ancillary\neffect on the state treasury is a permissible and often an inevitable consequence of the principle” that\nprospective injunctive relief is not barred by the eleventh amendment to the United States constitution).\nAs the plaintiffs correctly assert, therefore, sovereign immunity does not bar the present action.\nAccordingly, the motion is not granted on sovereign immunity grounds. Nevertheless, for the reasons\ndiscussed elsewhere in this decision, the court nevertheless lacks subject matter jurisdiction, which\nrequires that the motion be granted.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the defendants’ motion to dismiss is hereby granted.\nFootnotes\n1 As noted elsewhere in this decision, Kerri Dirgo and Joshua Wilcox were added as plaintiffs on April\n8, 2020. Accordingly, references to the “individual defendants” refer to them as well.\n2 On April 8, 2020, the plaintiffs also filed a supplemental motion for temporary order of mandamus to\nconform to the amended complaint that was filed on that date.\n3 On April 7, 2020, the defendants also filed an objection to the motion for temporary order of\nmandamus, with several exhibits.\n4 On April 8, 2020, this court, Bellis, J., issued an order stating in relevant part: “By agreement of the\nparties, and with the court’s permission, Kerri Dirgo and Joshua Wilcox are added as party plaintiffs,\nAmended Complaint entry #114 filed on today’s date is the operative complaint, and Motion to Dismiss\nentry #112 is directed to said Amended Complaint.”\n5 Practice Book § 23-45 (a) provides: “An action of mandamus may be brought in an individual right by\nany person who claims entitlement to that remedy to enforce a private duty owed to that person, or by\nany state’s attorney to enforce a public duty.” (Emphasis added).\n421277\nJudge: BARBARA N BELLIS\nThis document may be signed or verified electronically and has the same validity and status as a document with a physical\n(pen-to-paper) signature.

Background and History of the Case \n \n  In late April, the incarcerated plaintiffs filed suit against Connecticut’s governor and correction \ncommissioner  in  their  official  capacities,  alleging  that  the  latter  contravened  their  Eighth  and \nFourteenth Amendment rights with their acts or omissions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. \nThroughout the proceedings the defendants have denied any and all allegations of unconstitutional \nconduct, and instead have maintained their claims and defenses, including their claim that the practices \nof the Connecticut Department of Correction meet or exceed CDC guidelines, and in fact, are \nexemplary.  After the defendants’ motion to dismiss was denied, the Court oversaw a brief period of \ndiscovery leading up to a scheduled June 10th hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction. The parties also engaged in discussions to resolve the parties’ dispute on a classwide basis.  \n  On June 6, 2020, following mediation with the Hon. William I. Garfinkel, the parties agreed \non a settlement which, in relevant part, jointly defines the plaintiff class as “all persons who were \nincarcerated in a DOC facility from March 1, 2020, or are incarcerated, or in the future will be so \nincarcerated,  until  the  termination  date  of  this  Agreement,  December  31,  2020.”  The  parties  \nrespectfully  seek certification of such a class in contemplation of notice to the class and a Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(e) fairness hearing.  \n   \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 104-1   Filed 06/11/20   Page 2 of 6\n2.  The Plaintiffs meet all of the prerequisites for (b)(2) class certification  \n \nHere the parties jointly seek to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(2), and therefore they must \ndemonstrate that “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply \ngenerally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate \nrespecting the class as a whole.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). “The party seeking class certification bears \nthe burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that each of Rule 23’s requirements has \nbeen met.” Myers v. Hertz Corp., 624 F.3d 537, 547 (2d Cir. 2010).1  \nHere, the parties have reached a settlement agreement with broad systemic non-monetary relief \nregarding, inter alia, sanitation practices in DOC facilities, testing of all inmates for SARS-CoV-2 \nvirus,   protocols for management of inmates who are positive for the virus, protocols for handling inmates \nwith COVID-19—a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2—in accordance with CDC guidelines, and the \nformation of a five-person monitoring panel to ensure ongoing compliance with CDC Guidelines, and the \nprovisions of the Agreement.  The parties jointly agree and stipulate that this broad-based systemic relief \nwill apply generally to the class, and that the class definition makes sense here where all persons who are \nincarcerated or will be incarcerated will be included in the class.  “Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a \nsingle injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class. It does \nnot  authorize  class  certification  when  each  individual  class  member  would  be  entitled  to \na different injunction or declaratory judgment against the defendant.” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, \n564 U.S. 338, 360(2011). Here, the proposed class would be provided relief from the parties’ \nagreement. \n \n1 Here, pursuant to their Agreement the parties jointly move for class certification, and for purposes \nof settlement the Defendants assume, without waiving any future challenges to a class certification \nmotion, that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) and (b) are met.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 104-1   Filed 06/11/20   Page 3 of 6\nBefore approving a class settlement, this Court must decide “whether the requirements for class \ncertification in Rule 23(a) and (b) have been satisfied,” In re American Int’l Grp., Sec. Litig., 689 F.3d \n229, 238 (2d Cir. 2012); Waggoner v. Barclays PLC, 875 F.3d 79, 86 n.5 (2d Cir. 2017).  The parties \nagree  and  submit  that  for  purposes  of  settlement,  the  proposed  class  satisfies  the  numerosity, \ncommonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation standards in Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1)-(4).2  \nThere is no dispute the class meets numerosity requirements,   and commonality, typicality and \nadequacy of representation  standards are also  met here where injunctive relief is appropriate for the \nclass as a whole.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  As all four elements of Rule 23 (a) have been satisfied the \nCourt should certify the proposed settlement class. \n  Here, the proposed class satisfies the numerosity requirement because the class comprises  \nmore than 10,000 people,3 and our Circuit presumes numerosity exists in classes of larger than forty \nmembers.  E.g., Pennsylvania Pub. Sch. Employees’ Ret. Sys. v. Morgan Stanley & Co., 772 F.3d 111, \n120 (2d Cir. 2014).  The commonality requirement is similarly met, because the proposed class \nmembers all raise the same issues of fact surrounding the defendants’ response to the COVID-19 \noutbreak in the prisons in which they are held.  E.g., Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372, 376 (2d Cir. \n1997) (“The commonality requirement is met if plaintiffs’ grievances share a common question of law \nor of fact.”).  The proposed class members also share typicality, because the Complaint alleges that \nthe defendants’ response to the pandemic violated the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment rights of all \nincarcerated people.  E.g., In re Drexel Burnham Lambert Grp., 960 F.2d 285, 291 (2d Cir. 1992) \n(holding that typicality exists when “each class member makes similar legal arguments to prove the \n \n2 By joining in this motion,  Defendants do not waive and reserve their right to challenge class \ncertification if the Agreement is not approved, or for any reason, or in in any future litigation. \n3 See Exhibit A to declaration of Michelle DeVeau [ECF # 59-24] at 1. \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 104-1   Filed 06/11/20   Page 4 of 6\ndefendant’s liability”).4  Lastly, the proposed class is adequately represented by the named plaintiffs, \nbecause there is no conflict between them and the rest of the class, and because their conduct to date \nhas assured the class “of vigorous prosecution” of the claims.  Irvin v. Harris, 944 F.3d 63, 71 (2d Cir. \n2019). “Rule 23(a)(4) requires that plaintiffs demonstrate that ‘class counsel is qualified, experienced, \nand generally able to conduct the litigation.’ In re Drexel Burnham Lambert, 960 F.2d at 291.”  \nMarisol A. v. Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372, 378 (2d Cir. 1997). Throughout the hard-fought negotiations \nunder the supervision of Magistrate Judge Garfinkel, the parties agree, and the Magistrate Judge’s \nremarks confirm, that plaintiffs’ attorneys have demonstrated their qualifications and experience to \nconduct class-action litigation, and that the Settlement is fair, adequate and reasonable.  See Transcript, \nECF Doc. #103. \n  Secondly, the plaintiffs’ allegations demonstrate that “final injunctive relief or corresponding \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  The \ninjunction sought by the plaintiffs in the Complaint and motion for a preliminary injunction would \naddress  the  common  deficiencies  alleged  by  the  plaintiffs,  without  necessitating  individualized \ninjunctions for each plaintiff.  See Amara v. CIGNA Corp., 775 F.3d 510, 522 (2d Cir. 2014).  In \naccordance with those commonalities, the proposed class settlement includes relief extending to the \n \n4 The parties recognize that for class certification purposes the Court may arguendo accept the \nallegations  of  the  complaint;  however,  the  parties  also  jointly  agreed  and  stated  in  their \nagreement, in part, that the Connecticut Department of Correction (“DOC”) has begun the mass \ntesting of prisoners confined in DOC facilities, a program that exceeds the current CDC \nguidelines; the parties acknowledge DOC’s many efforts to comply with the CDC guidelines \nand, where appropriate, to obtain clarification or guidance from the Connecticut Department of \nPublic Health (“DPH”); and  the parties recognize DOC’s significant efforts to combat COVID-\n19, including, but not limited to, increasing sanitation and hygiene, testing, and releasing \nprisoners safely and appropriately to the community, which has resulted, in combination with \nprisoners having reached their end of sentence dates, in the prison population declining to \nnumbers not seen in decades. \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 104-1   Filed 06/11/20   Page 5 of 6\nentire class, such as a monitoring panel and systemwide mitigation measures.  Accordingly, the Court \nshould certify the plaintiff class as proposed by the parties in their Settlement Agreement.  \n3.  Conclusion \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court should certify the plaintiff class  pursuant to Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(b)(2) and the class shall be defined as “all persons who were incarcerated in a DOC facility \nfrom March 1, 2020, or are incarcerated, or in the future will be so incarcerated, until the termination \ndate of this Agreement, December 31, 2020.” \nPLAINTIFFS           DEFENDANTS \nTre McPherson et Al.

The conditions of confinement at DOC facilities across the state create \na heightened and unreasonable risk of COVID-19 for any person confined at the jail and a \nsubstantial risk of severe illness or death for those who are older and/or medically vulnerable to \nCOVID-19.  Plaintiffs bring this class action seeking immediate release of all individuals 50 and \nolder and those with medical conditions that place them at heightened risk of severe illness or \ndeath from COVID-19.  These individuals are members of the “Medically Vulnerable Pre-\nadjudication Subclass” or the “Medically Vulnerable Post-adjudication Subclass.”  Release will \nremove  the  Medically  Vulnerable  Subclasses  from  a  life-threatening  situation  and  allow \nDefendants-Respondents to implement social distancing measures and other CDC public-health \nguidelines for those remaining in DOC facilities.  Plaintiffs also seek injunctive relief on behalf of \ntwo classes that together comprise all individuals currently held in DOC facilities:  the Pre-\nadjudication Class of those incarcerated people held while awaiting adjudication of their charges, \nand the Post-adjudication Class of those incarcerated people who are serving a criminal sentence.  \nPlaintiffs ask the Court to order Defendants-Respondents to comply with the safety and health \nguidelines that prevent or minimize the spread of the virus for those confined in DOC facilities.  It \nis unconscionable that Defendants-Respondents have not yet implemented CDC guidelines to \nmaximize social distancing, increased hygiene, access to personal protective equipment (“PPE”), \nand appropriate medical treatment for those infected.  Indeed, Defendant-Respondent Cook’s \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 3 of 37\nresponse to the crisis has been to simply transfer members of the Classes who had tested positive \nfor COVID-19 to isolation units in Northern Correctional Institution (“Northern”), a “supermax” \nprison not intended or designed to serve as a medical correctional facility.  He then failed to \nconfirm that transferred class members would receive the level of care recommended by the CDC \nand failed to take steps to provide adequate hygiene, sanitation, or social distancing for the \nremaining incarcerated people in DOC facilities.    \n2.  Prisons  and  jails  are  quickly  becoming  the  epicenter  of  COVID-19  in  cities \nthroughout the country, including New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia.  DOC is quickly joining \nthese ignoble ranks due to the inherent congregate nature of its facilities, as exacerbated by its \nreactive, haphazard, and inconsistent approach to dealing with the virus.  As demonstrated by the \nexponential spread of COVID-19 throughout DOC facilities over the past three weeks, current \nconditions continue to create an extreme risk for rapid, uncontrollable spread of COVID-19 \nthroughout  the  system  with  grave  outcomes  for  both  the  incarcerated  population  and  the \nsurrounding  communities.    Although  in  April,  DOC  began  moving  COVID-19-positive \nincarcerated people to Northern to isolate the positive cases from the rest of the incarcerated \npopulation, these efforts are insufficient.  Pervasive fear of Northern has deterred people from \nreporting symptoms; not all COVID-19-positive incarcerated people have been transferred; some \nhave not been transferred immediately; others have been returned prematurely; and those left \nbehind have not been screened, quarantined, or otherwise protected.  Meanwhile, people detained \nin other DOC facilities remain unable to comply with CDC guidelines to practice social distancing, \nmaintain proper personal hygiene, frequently disinfect their spaces, or use appropriate PPE.  In \nfact, responsive measures within DOC continue to differ not only day by day, but facility by \nfacility, building by building, and block by block. \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 4 of 37\n3.  A substantial number of people currently held at DOC facilities—members of the \nMedically Vulnerable Subclasses—face serious risks of life-threatening illness due to their age \nand/or underlying medical conditions.  Plaintiffs seek writs of habeas corpus for members of the \nMedically Vulnerable Subclasses.  Habeas relief is essential and proper to prevent unnecessary \nloss of life. \n4.  For all individuals held in DOC facilities—the Classes—Defendants-Respondents \nmust substantially alter conditions to comply with the CDC guidelines for social distancing and \nenhanced sanitation and hygiene practices.  Plaintiffs ask the Court to certify the Class and to order \nDefendants-Respondents to implement a plan that allows DOC facilities to comply with CDC \nguidelines for social distancing, hygiene and sanitation practices, PPE, and adequate medical care.  \nTo aid the Court in enforcing this order, Plaintiffs ask the Court to appoint a public-health expert \nto 1) evaluate the Defendants-Respondents’ proposed program, and 2) to confirm that Defendants-\nRespondents properly identify and release members of the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses. \n5.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs, on behalf of the Classes and the Medically Vulnerable \nSubclasses, bring this action and request immediate release of all members of the Medically \nVulnerable Subclasses.  Plaintiffs and the Classes also ask this Court to order Defendants-\nRespondents to cure the unsafe conditions at DOC facilities by implementing procedures that \ncomply with CDC guidelines.  If this Court does not grant immediate release to the Medically \nVulnerable Subclasses and injunctive relief to the Classes, Plaintiffs request a hearing as soon as \npossible.  Given the rapid exponential spread of COVID-19, there is no time to spare. \nI.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  Plaintiffs bring this putative class action pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 2241, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983, and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202, for relief from both detention and conditions of confinement \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 5 of 37\nthat violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n7.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over these claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2241 (habeas corpus), 28 U.S.C. § 1651 (All Writs Act), 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a) (civil rights \njurisdiction), and 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction).  \n8.  This Court is the appropriate venue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because the \nevents and omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in the District of Connecticut. \nII.  PARTIES \n9.  Plaintiff Tre McPherson is a pretrial detainee at Bridgeport Correctional Center \nheld for lack of a $5,100 bond.  Defendants-Respondents house him in an open dormitory with \nfifty-seven other men.  Many men in his dormitory have reported symptoms similar to a head cold, \nincluding Mr. McPherson, who recently also lost his sense of smell.  These are symptoms of \nCOVID-19.  At least one other man was very sick and removed from the dormitory. \n10.  Plaintiff  Pattikate  Williams-Void  is  a  pretrial  detainee  at  York  Correctional \nInstitute held for lack of a $75,000 bond.  She has hypertension and has been diagnosed as pre-\ndiabetic.  These underlying medical conditions put Ms. Williams-Void at a high risk of life-\nthreatening complications should she contract COVID-19. \n11.  Plaintiff John Doe is above the age of 70 and is a prisoner serving a sentence of \nincarceration.  He has HIV and hepatitis C, and requires regular dialysis for kidney disease.  These \nunderlying medical conditions put Mr. Doe at high risk of life-threatening complications should \nhe contract COVID-19.  In disregard of these risk factors, Defendants-Respondents house Mr. Doe \nwith a cellmate.   \n12.  Plaintiff John Roe is above the age of 50 and is a prisoner serving a sentence of \nincarceration.  He has HIV, which, along with his age, puts him at high risk of life-threatening \ncomplications should he contract COVID-19.  In disregard of these risk factors, Defendants-\n5 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 6 of 37\nRespondents house Mr. Roe in an open dormitory with more than ninety other people sleeping in \nbunkbeds in close proximity to one another. \n13.  Plaintiff  Thomas  Caves  is  a  prisoner  serving  a  sentence  of  incarceration  at \nCorrigan-Radgowski Correctional Institute.  Defendants-Respondents house him with a cellmate \nand his cell is not cleaned.  Mr. Caves shares showers, phones, and common space with more than \neighty other men housed in his unit.  One person who contracted COVID-19 and fell ill in Mr. \nCaves’ unit was simply locked in his cell, with his cellmate, for 15 days.   \n14.  Defendant-Respondent Ned Lamont is the governor of state of Connecticut.  He is \nsued in his official capacity.  Governor Lamont and the state of Connecticut control and operate \nthe DOC facilities through Defendant-Respondent Commissioner Rollin Cook.  The state of \nConnecticut currently has immediate custody over Plaintiffs McPherson, Williams-Void, Doe, \nRoe, Caves, and all other putative class members.  \n15.  Defendant-Respondent  Rollin  Cook  is  the  commissioner  of  the  Connecticut \nDepartment of Correction.  Defendant-Respondent Cook currently has immediate custody over \nPlaintiffs-Petitioners McPherson, Williams-Void, Doe, Roe, Caves, and all other putative class \nmembers.  Defendant-Respondent Cook is a policymaker for the state of Connecticut.  Defendant-\nRespondent Cook is sued in his official capacity. \nIII.

In many people, COVID-19 causes fever, cough, and shortness of breath.16  Most \npeople in high-risk categories who develop serious illness will need advanced support.17  This \nrequires highly specialized equipment that are in limited supply, such as ventilators, and an entire \nteam of care providers, including 1:1 or 1:2 nurse to patient ratios, respiratory therapists, and \nintensive care physicians.18 \n22.  The need for care, including intensive care, and the risk of death, is much higher \nfor COVID-19 infection than for influenza.19  According to recent estimates, the fatality rate of \npeople infected with COVID-19 is about ten times higher than a severe seasonal influenza, even \nin advanced countries with highly effective health care systems.20 For people in the highest-risk \n  \npopulations, the fatality rate of COVID-19 infection is about 15 percent.21  Patients who do not \ndie from serious cases of COVID-19 may face prolonged recovery periods, including extensive \nrehabilitation from neurologic damage, loss of digits, and loss of respiratory capacity.22 \n \n15 Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), World Health \nOrganization (Feb. 28, 2020), at 12, https://cutt.ly/xtEokCt. \n16 Golob Decl. ¶ 5. \n17 Id. at ¶ 8. \n18 Id. \n19 Id. at ¶ 4. \n20 Id.

People in congregate environments—places where people live, eat, and sleep in \nclose proximity—face increased danger of coronavirus infection and COVID-19, as already \nevidenced by the rapid spread of the virus on cruise ships23 and in nursing homes.24  It is virtually \nimpossible for people who are confined in prisons, jails, and detention centers to engage in the \nnecessary social distancing and hygiene required to mitigate the risk of transmission of the \ndisease.25  \n24.  “Correctional settings increase the risk” of contracting COVID-19 because in \nprison, “there are high numbers of people with chronic, often untreated, illnesses housed in a \nsetting with minimal levels of sanitation, limited access to personal hygiene, limited access to \nmedical care, and no possibility of staying at a distance from others,” 26 such that “there are more \npeople susceptible to getting infected congregated together in a context in which fighting the \nspread of an infection is nearly impossible.”27 \n25.  This increased risk is present and apparent in the DOC facilities.  As elsewhere, \n \n23 The CDC is currently recommending that travelers defer cruise ship travel worldwide.  “Cruise ship \npassengers are at increased risk of person-to-person spread of infectious diseases, including COVID-19.” \nCOVID and Cruise Ship Travel, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, https://cutt.ly/7tEEQvT. \n24 The CDC notes that long-term care facilities and nursing homes pose a particular risk because of “their \ncongregate nature” and the residents served.

In addition, Connecticut’s prison population is aging.  Five hundred ninety-six of \nthe people in state custody are 50 or older and therefore are at a higher risk for severe complications \n \n28 See, e.g., The Center for Prisoner Health and Human Rights, Chronic and Infectious Diseases in Justice-\nInvolved Populations (2020), https://cutt.ly/nt4uO2F; Vera Institute of Justice, On Life Support: Public \nHealth in the Age of Mass Incarceration (2014), available at https://cutt.ly/Ft4uAIJ. \n29 Laura M.

At the same time, the high risk presented to older people by \nCOVID-19 is “of particular concern for inmate populations, since prisoners’ physiological age \naverages 10 to 15 years older than their chronological age.”35   \n27.  Generally, it has proven difficult to implement CDC guidelines in a correctional \nsetting, and incarcerated people already are dying nationwide as a result.36  This is demonstrated \nby dramatic outbreaks at Rikers Island in New York City and at the Cook County Jail in Chicago, \nwhere the transmission rate for COVID-19 is estimated to be the highest in the world.37  The CDC \nalso warns of “community spread”: where the virus spreads easily and sustainably within a \ncommunity where the source of infection is unknown.38 \n28.  Flu outbreaks regularly occur in jails; during the H1N1 epidemic in 2009, jails and \nprisons had a disproportionately high number of cases.39 \n \n34 See Exhibit D, Affidavit of Brie M.

Risk mitigation is the only viable strategy to combat the spread of COVID-19 and \nprevent serious harm or death to class members.49  Even with the most comprehensive plan to \naddress the spread of COVID-19 in detention facilities, a key part of an effective risk mitigation \nstrategy is the release of individuals at high risk of severe disease if infected with COVID-19.   \nImmediate  release  of  the  medically  vulnerable  population  not  only  protects  them  from \ntransmission of COVID-19, but also mitigates risk for people in the DOC facilities.  A population \ndecrease would allow for better social distancing and increased availability of hygiene products, \nPPE, and access to medical care for those who remain, all of which decreases the COVID-19 risks \n \n40 Golob Decl. ¶¶ 13–14. \n41 Rich Decl. ¶¶ 15–17.   \n42 Kelan Lyons, Elderly Prison Population Vulnerable to Potential Coronavirus Outbreak, CONN.

She told the Hartford Courant on \nMarch 11 that, “[w]e’re all just holding our breath and hoping this passes us by.”66 \n38.  Initially, DOC’s only plan to address COVID-19 was a repurposed 2007 policy for \nflu outbreaks.67  On March 11, spokesperson Karen Martucci doubled down on the outdated plan \nin a press interview.  “This isn’t new for us.  We quarantine for the flu every year,” she said.  “We \ndidn’t have to create a pandemic plan.

As  these  numbers  illustrate,  immediate  release  of  the  Medically  Vulnerable \nSubclasses remains a necessary public health intervention79 because DOC’s plan for preventative \nmeasures are insufficient to minimize the spread of the virus.  For example, the DOC’s plan permits \nrecreation and programming to take place in groups of up to fifty incarcerated people, ten times \nthe number of people permitted by the Governor’s executive order.80  Most importantly, the DOC’s \nplan does not—and cannot—account for the physical infrastructure of DOC facilities, where \nthousands of people continue to live in dormitory or double-celled settings that house up to 140 \npeople in a single building, sharing phones, showers, tables, toilets, bunk beds, and cells, with no \nability to socially distance.   \n45.  Similarly,  the  DOC’s  recent  decision  to  transfer  all  COVID-19-positive \nincarcerated people to Northern is still insufficient to prevent the spread of coronavirus to the rest \nof the population in DOC facilities.81  Steven Wales, a correction officer at DOC facility Corrigan-\nRadgowski Correctional Center and union steward for Local 1565 of the American Federation of \nState, County and Municipal Employees, has stated that only incarcerated people who have tested \npositive are being moved; there are incarcerated people who are showing symptoms and are \nquarantined, but have not been tested yet.82  Mr. Wales still has concerns about the conditions at \nDOC facilities, and bluntly observed that the DOC has “a long way to go.”83  Meanwhile, \nhealthcare workers at DOC facilities have stated publicly that many aspects of DOC’s handling of \n \n79 See Public Health Expert Declarations, supra notes 40–48. \n80 Compare Conn.

Transfers also do not eliminate the risk of the virus spreading in all other DOC \nfacilities.  Incarcerated people and staff members who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic can \nstill infect others, especially while incarcerated people are unable to practice CDC-recommended \nsocial distancing and personal hygiene practices.  While DOC officials wait for a positive test, \nwhich takes days, members of the Classes are quarantined in their cells or in medical facilities that \ndo not comply with the CDC guidelines; therefore, fellow class members are still subject to \ninfection.  This continued risk is evidenced by the fact that the number of incarcerated people and \nDOC staff members testing positive continues to grow despite the transfer of most COVID-19-\npositive incarcerated people.85 \n47.  Further, the transfer of COVID-19-positive members of the Classes to Northern is \nonly worsening the COVID-19 crisis in DOC facilities.  Northern is the polar opposite of a hospital \nsetting.  Built in 1995 as Connecticut’s first and only supermax prison, Northern formerly housed \nincarcerated people on death row before the state abolished the death penalty.  Since then, Northern \nhas been used as a solitary confinement facility to “manage those inmates who have demonstrated \n \n84 Kelan Lyons, Shifting Plans and a COVID-19 Outbreak at a Connecticut Prison, CONN.

Northern’s conditions of confinement are singularly oppressive.  Six units housing \nprisoners radiate outwards from a long, sloped, windowless corridor, meant to give the impression \nof walking underground.  Light and sound reverberate off the concrete walls and mirrored \nwindows, which are purposefully arranged at irregular angles to create a disorienting kaleidoscopic \neffect.  \n49.  Each unit at Northern is identical in configuration, with two levels (“tiers”) on \nwhich cells are located.  The cells at Northern are 7 feet by 12 feet.88  They are made of concrete, \nand are designed to exacerbate Northern’s complete sensory deprivation.  The only daylight and \nview outdoors comes through a narrow 4-inch by 3-inch slot at the back of each cell, which cannot \nbe opened.  The cell doors are solid steel, with a small “trap” through which Northern staff can \nshove food or cuff prisoners.  While the cells have intercoms, they frequently do not work or are \nignored.  \n50.  Solitary  confinement  at  Northern  is  not  the  same  as  the  medical  isolation \nrecommended by the CDC.

Worse  yet,  fear  of  Northern  is  pervasive  among  the  incarcerated  population.  \nSending people to Northern simply because they test positive for COVID-19 is thus dangerous, as \nit deters others from reporting symptoms in an attempt to avoid the punitive conditions at \nNorthern.91  As public health experts attest, “[t]his avoidance of reporting symptoms or illness will \nnot only accelerate the spread of infection within facilities but also increase the likelihood of \nprisoner deaths due to lack of treatment.”92  This is especially so given that—notwithstanding its \ncurrent use as the designated COVID-19-positive facility—DOC also continues to use Northern \nas a place for punishment.  As recently as April 4, 19 incarcerated people at DOC’s Carl Robinson \nCorrectional Institution were transferred to Northern as punishment for protesting DOC’s COVID-\n19 response.93  \n52.

Finally, some of those who are being transferred to Northern are being returned to \ntheir original facilities after a few days—so long as they are not febrile—without being retested \nfor COVID-19 and without any accompanying quarantining or sanitation measures.   \n  The Current Conditions of Confinement at DOC Facilities Exacerbate the \nExtreme and Imminent Danger Faced by Class Members of Contracting and \nPossibly Dying from COVID-19 \n54.  Even in the best of times, DOC facilities, like many correctional settings, are beset \nwith health problems and staffing challenges.  Ominously, however, officials have exacerbated \nand increased the risks to the health and life of members of the Classes during the current pandemic \nby maintaining unconstitutional conditions of confinement that increase the risk of COVID-19 \ncases at DOC facilities. \n55.  Though everyone entering a Connecticut correctional facility is required to have a \nwellness screening, including a temperature check, recent data suggests that around 60% of \nCOVID-19 cases are asymptomatic.94  As a result, fevers are not a reliable indicator of whether \nsomeone is a carrier.95  The prevalence of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic COVID-19 carriers \nalso belie Defendant-Respondent Governor Lamont’s claim that moving prisoners around inside \nthe same sealed buildings will prevent the spread of infection. \n56.  Further, while DOC is transferring members of the Classes who test positive for \nCOVID-19, there is a constant risk of transmission through DOC staff members.  “Prisons and \njails are not actually isolated from our communities: hundreds of thousands of correctional officers \n \n94 Jane Qiu, Covert Coronavirus Infections Could Be Seeding New Outbreaks, NATURE (Mar. 20, 2020), \navailable at https://cutt.ly/bt3VhFs. \n95 Rich Decl. ¶ 9.   \n \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 24 of 37\nand correctional healthcare workers enter these facilities every day, returning to their families and \nto our communities at the end of their shifts, bringing back and forth to their families and neighbors \nand to incarcerated patients any exposures they have had during the day.”96  As of April 20, 2020, \n202 DOC staff members have tested positive for COVID-19.97  DOC staff are further vectors of \nthe virus: like incarcerated people, they may be asymptomatic but still contagious.  This presents \na daily risk of coronavirus infection in DOC facilities.  Upon information and belief, DOC is taking \nstaff members’ temperature upon their entrance to the facilities, but the high rates of asymptomatic \ntransmission means that monitoring fever is inadequate to identify all who may be infected and \nthereby reduce the risk of transmission.98  This also is true because not all individuals infected \nwith COVID-19 present with fever in early stages of infection.99  \n57.  Similarly, DOC’s plan to transfer members of the Classes who have tested positive \nto Northern does not mitigate the risk of the infection spreading further in the DOC facilities.    \nThere are still incarcerated people at other DOC facilities who are showing symptoms, but have \nnot yet been tested.100  And given high rates of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission, \nit is impossible for DOC to transfer everyone to Northern quickly enough to prevent infection: \nonce someone is symptomatic and/or tests positive, is it already too late.

Meanwhile, class members in DOC facilities—aside from those transferred to \nNorthern—continue to live in dormitory or double-celled settings, where they sleep, eat, bathe, \nand recreate within inches of tens or hundreds of others.  Many continue to eat a foot apart.  They \ncontinue to use dayrooms alongside hundreds of other people.  They continue to share the same \nfew phones.  They continue to share toilets, sinks, and showers.  \n59.  The sanitation practices inside DOC prisons continue to be lacking in light of the \ndanger posed by COVID-19.101  Sanitation practices vary dramatically by facility, building, and \nunit.  Class members in certain facilities do not have adequate access to soap.  While some are \nbeing given credit card-sized bars of soap, others must purchase it through the commissary.  No \ncleaning supplies are available for purchase in the commissary.  Hand sanitizer is banned.  \n60.  Some class members are given supplies with which to disinfect their cells once a \nweek.  Others are given none, and have attempted to clean their living quarters with bars of soap \nor shampoo.  In certain facilities, class members are given one bottle of bleach to last a 100-person \ndormitory for a week.  In others, class members are given only diluted bleach or diluted Lemonall.  \nCommon areas and showers are shared by tens or hundreds of people and are being cleaned only \nonce a day.  In certain facilities, handcuffs are used to move people out of cell.  Handcuffs are not \nsanitized between uses.  \n61.  When a class member tests positive for COVID-19 and is transferred, he is required \nto move his belongings to the facility’s property unit.  No cleaning is done of his personal space \n \n101 Rich Decl. ¶ 10.   \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 26 of 37\nafter he has been transferred.  Those who live around the COVID-19-positive person are not \nprovided any special cleaning supplies.  Nor are they screened for COVID-19 symptoms.  No \nconsistent  temperature  screening  has  been  performed  in  any  facility,  even  those  that  have \nexperienced significant outbreaks of COVID-19. \n62.  Class members in most DOC facilities were not given masks until April 1; others \nreceived them as late as April 10.  The masks are made of a cloth material.  They rip easily and \nare not replaced.  When laundered, they develop mildew.  Class members are punished if they \nattempt to fashion their own masks.  They are not given gloves.    \n63.  Some correctional officers wear masks or gloves, and others do not.  As recently as \nthe beginning of April, some medical staff were not wearing gloves to hand out medication.  \nCorrectional staff have continued to state that they do not have proper protective equipment.102  In \ncertain facilities, correctional staff continue to “shake down” units by going through peoples’ \npersonal belongings with their hands regularly.  \n64.  Even when carriers are successfully identified and quarantined, additional space \nwithin  a  facility  does  not  address  the  threat  of  potentially  airborne  diseases  within  sealed \nbuildings,103 which is only exacerbated by the poor ventilation in DOC facilities.104   \n65.  Defendants-Respondents also fail to adequately treat and quarantine individuals \npresenting with COVID-19 symptoms.  Some members of the Classes have simply been locked in \ntheir cells for 14 days and not let out, even to shower or call relatives to say they are sick.  \n \n102 Kelan Lyons, Shifting Plans and a COVID-19 Outbreak at a Connecticut Prison, CONN.

When someone \ntests positive, there is no screening of others with whom that person is housed—that is, there are \nno daily temperature checks or other attempts to monitor symptoms.  \n66.  Finally, incarcerated people in Connecticut, like their counterparts nationwide, are \ngiven almost all of their medical treatment in the same facility in which they are housed, rather \nthan in a dedicated medical facility such as a clinic or hospital.  DOC has announced no special \nCOVID-19 medical capabilities or staffing, other than the one dedicated provider at Northern.  \nDOC’s documented medical staffing shortages make it unlikely that any special or dedicated \nmedical care is being provided.105   \n67.  Defendants-Respondents have failed to respond to and manage the continued risk \nof harm posed by the COVID-19 outbreak by following public health guidelines from the CDC.106  \nTo remedy these unsafe conditions and comply with CDC guidelines, Defendants-Respondents \nmust implement a plan that allows DOC facilities to comply with CDC guidelines for social \ndistancing, hygiene and sanitation practices, personal protective equipment (“PPE”), and adequate \nmedical care.    \n68.  Members of the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses are at an increased risk of \ndeveloping  serious  complications  from  coronavirus  infection  and  COVID-19  due  to  their \nunderlying medical conditions.107  Release is necessary not only to prevent irreparable harm to \nmembers of the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses, but also to reduce the incarcerated population \n \n105 Giftos Decl. ¶ 12. \n106 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease \n2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities, https://cutt.ly/et4kBga. \n107 Rich Decl. ¶ 12.   \n \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 28 of 37\nat all DOC facilities enough to ensure proper social distancing, which will reduce the likelihood \nof infection for the Classes, staff at the DOC facilities, and the broader public.108  \n69.  In short, even if those who have tested positive are transferred to a separate facility, \nit is unrealistic to assume that “screening, social distancing, and quarantining measures can be \nsufficiently employed with correctional settings to combat the spread of COVID-19,”109 because \n“[t]here are too many structural limitations, and correctional health care can only do so much.”110  \n“Decreasing the incarcerated population so there is more ability to physically distance within the \nfacility, fewer people who can contract the virus inside the facility, and more medical care for \nthose who need it is the only way to prevent the complications from surging.”111 \nIV.  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n70.  Plaintiffs  McPherson,  Williams-Void,  Doe,  Roe,  and  Caves  bring  this  action \npursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a class of \nsimilarly situated individuals.  \n71.  Plaintiffs McPherson and Williams-Void seek to represent a class of all people held \nin pretrial custody, including for alleged violations of probation or parole, at DOC facilities (“Pre-\nadjudication Class”).  The Pre-adjudication Class includes a subclass of all persons who, by reason \nof age or medical condition, are particularly vulnerable to injury or death from COVID-19 \n \n108 Id ¶¶ 16, 17 (“[U]rgent decarceration is imperative to flatten the curve of Covid-19 cases among \nincarcerated populations and to limit the impact of transmission both inside correctional facilities and in \nthe community.”).  Further, in the prison context, the American Bar Association (ABA) urges that, \n“Governmental authorities in all branches in a jurisdiction should take necessary steps to avoid crowding \nthat… adversely affects the … protection of prisoners from harm, including the spread of disease.”  ABA \nStandard on Treatment of Prisoners 23-3.1(b). \n109 Giftos Aff. ¶ 25. \n110 Id. ¶ 26. \n111 Id.  \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 29 of 37\n(“Medically Vulnerable Pre-adjudication Subclass”).  Plaintiff Williams-Void is a representative \nand member of the Medically Vulnerable Pre-adjudication Subclass. \n72.  Plaintiffs Doe, Roe, and Caves seek to represent a class of all people held in post-\nadjudication custody in a DOC facility, including those serving a term of incarceration pursuant to \nan adjudicated violation of probation or parole, at DOC facilities (“Post-adjudication Class”).  The \nPost-adjudication Class includes a subclass of persons who, by reason of age or medical condition, \nare particularly vulnerable to injury or death from COVID-19 (“Medically Vulnerable Post-\nadjudication Subclass”).  Plaintiffs Doe and Roe also are representatives and members of the \nMedically Vulnerable Post-adjudication Subclass.   \n73.  The Medically Vulnerable Subclasses include all people 50 or older who are in \ncustody at DOC facilities and all people in custody at DOC facilities who have been diagnosed \nwith: (a) lung disease, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., bronchitis \nor emphysema), or other chronic conditions associated with impaired lung function; (b) heart \ndisease, such as congenital heart disease, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease; (c) \nchronic liver or kidney disease (including hepatitis and dialysis patients); (d) diabetes or other \nendocrine disorders; (e) epilepsy; (f) hypertension; (g) compromised immune systems (such as \nfrom cancer, HIV, receipt of an organ or bone marrow transplant, as a side effect of medication, \nor other autoimmune disease); (h) blood disorders (including sickle cell disease); (i) inherited \nmetabolic disorders; (j) history of stroke; (k) a developmental disability; and/or (l) a current or \nrecent (last two weeks) pregnancy.   \n74.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action \nunder  Federal  law.    It  satisfies  the  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality,  and  adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 30 of 37\n75.  Joinder is impracticable because (1) the classes are numerous; (2) the classes \ninclude unidentifiable future members; and (3) the class members are incarcerated, which limits \ntheir ability to file and pursue individual lawsuits, particularly in light of the cessation of legal \nvisitation and court closures in the state of Connecticut. \n76.  On information and belief, there are at least 11,840 people in the proposed Classes.  \nThe information as to the exact size of the Classes and Subclasses and the identity of the \nindividuals therein are in the exclusive control of the Defendants-Respondents. \n77.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the proposed Classes: \nall have the right to conditions of confinement that do not put them at increased risk of infection \nand complications from COVID-19.  \n78.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the members of the Classes because Plaintiffs and \nall class members are injured by the same wrongful acts, omissions, polices, and practices of \nDefendants-Respondents as described in this Complaint.  Plaintiffs’ claims arise from the same \npractices and courses of conduct that give rise to the claims of the class members, and are based \non the same legal theories. \n79.  Plaintiffs McPherson, Williams-Void, Doe, Roe, and Caves have the requisite \npersonal interest in the outcome of this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests \nof the class.  They have no interests adverse to the interests of the proposed Classes.  They retained \npro bono counsel with experience and success in the prosecution of civil rights litigation.  Counsel \nfor Plaintiffs know of no conflicts among members of the Classes or between counsel and members \nof the Classes. \n80.  Defendants-Respondents  have  acted  on  grounds  generally  applicable  to  all \nmembers of the Classes, and this action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs therefore \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 31 of 37\nseek class certification under Rule 23(b)(2). \n81.  In  the  alternative,  the  requirements  of  Rule  23(b)(1)  are  satisfied,  because \nprosecuting separate actions would create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with \nrespect to individual class members that would establish incompatible standards of contact for the \nparty opposing the proposed Classes. \nV.  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nUnconstitutional Punishment in Violation of the  \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n42 U.S.C. § 1983/28 U.S.C. § 2241  \nPre-adjudication Class versus All Defendants \n \n82.  The Fourteenth Amendment provides greater due process protections to persons in \npretrial custody, and prohibits punishment as part of their detention.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, \n535 n.16 (1979).  A defendant has punished plaintiffs when the conduct is either not rationally \nrelated to a legitimate, non-punitive governmental purpose or excessive in relation to that purpose. \n83.  Even assuming that Defendants-Respondents’ spacing and provision of medical \nservices inside DOC facilities normally serve the legitimate, non-punitive purpose of health and \nsafety of detained persons, the current operation of the DOC facilities during this pandemic \nestablishes that Defendants-Respondents are unable to sufficiently comply with public health \nguidelines to prevent an outbreak of COVID-19.  Therefore, continuing to detain members of the \nPre-adjudication Class under conditions of confinement that are inconsistent with COVID-19-\nspecific guidance from public health experts is not rationally related to, and excessive in relation \nto, that purpose. \n84.  Accordingly,  Defendants-Respondents  have  violated  the  rights  of  the  Pre-\nadjudication Class under the Fourteenth Amendment. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 32 of 37\nUnconstitutional Confinement in Violation of the \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n42 U.S.C. § 1983/28 U.S.C. § 2241 \nPre-adjudication Class versus All Defendants \n \n85.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, corrections officials are required to provide for \nthe reasonable health and safety of persons in pretrial custody.  Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. \n307, 315–16, 324 (1982).  Correctional officials thus have an affirmative obligation to protect \npersons in their custody from infectious disease.  The protection due to detainees under the \nFourteenth  Amendment  is  even  greater  than  the  protection  due  to  those  incarcerated  after \nadjudication, because pretrial detainees are “entitled to more considerate treatment and conditions \nof  confinement  than  criminals  whose  conditions  of  confinement  are  designed  to  punish.”  \nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 321–22.  Thus, the “Fourteenth Amendment affords pretrial detainees \nprotections ‘at least as great as the Eighth Amendment protections available to a convicted \nprisoner.’”  Id. (quoting City of Revere v. Mass. Gen. Hosp., 463 U.S. 239, 244 (1983)).   \n86.  The DOC has failed to comply with public health guidelines to manage an outbreak \nof COVID-19 and has not provided for the safety of the Pre-adjudication Class.  Defendants-\nRespondents’ actions and inactions result in the confinement of members of the Pre-adjudication \nClass in facilities where they do not adequately test for, treat, or prevent COVID-19 outbreaks, \nwhich violates Plaintiffs’ rights to treatment and adequate medical care. \n87.  Accordingly,  Defendants-Respondents  have  violated  the  rights  of  the  Pre-\nAdjudication Class under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 33 of 37\nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nUnconstitutional Conditions of Confinement in Violation  \nof the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n42 U.S.C. § 1983/28 U.S.C. § 2241  \nPost-adjudication Class versus All Defendants-Respondents \n88.  Officials  violate  incarcerated  individuals’  rights  when  they  are  deliberately \nindifferent to conditions of confinement that are likely to cause them serious illness and that pose \nan unreasonable risk of serious damage to their future health.  Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, \n33–34 (1993).  The Supreme Court held in Helling v. McKinney that the government violates the \nEighth Amendment when it crowds prisoners into cells with others who have “infectious maladies” \nor otherwise exposes prisoners “to a serious, communicable disease.”  509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993) \n(citing Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 682 (1978)).  This is true “even though the possible infection \nmight not affect all of those exposed.”  Id.  \n89.  DOC facilities, as currently operated, are unable to comply with public health \nguidelines to prevent an outbreak of COVID-19, and Defendants-Respondents have not and cannot \nprovide for the safety of the Post-adjudication Class.  This remains true despite DOC’s recent \ntransfer of COVID-19-positive incarcerated people to a separate facility, because Defendants-\nRespondents have not taken appropriate steps to test for, treat, and prevent further COVID-19 \noutbreaks, and Defendants-Respondents are unable to protect the Medically Vulnerable Post-\nadjudication Subclass from serious harm caused by COVID-19, in violation of their constitutional \nobligation to provide humane conditions of confinement. \n90.  Accordingly,  Defendants-Respondents  have  violated  the  rights  of  the  Post-\nadjudication Class under the Eighth Amendment. \nVI.  REQUEST FOR RELIEF \n91.  Plaintiffs  McPherson,  Williams-Void,  Doe,  Roe,  Caves,  and  Class  Members \nrespectfully request that the Court order the following: \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 34 of 37\n1.  Certification of this Petition as a Class Action. \n2.  A preliminary injunction, permanent injunction, and/or writs of habeas corpus requiring \nDefendants-Respondents to identify all Medically Vulnerable Subclass Members in both \nthe Pre-adjudication and Post-adjudication Classes within six (6) hours of the Court’s order \nand release—within twenty-four (24) hours of submission of the list—all such persons \nabsent proof of judicially-recorded findings by clear and convincing evidence that the \nindividual poses such a serious risk of flight or danger to others that no other conditions \ncan mitigate; and ordering that Defendants-Respondents provide these individuals with \neducational resources on COVID-19, including instructions that they should self-isolate \nfor the CDC-recommended period of time (currently 14 days) following release. \n3.  Following immediate release of all Medically Vulnerable Subclass Members, a plan, to be \nsubmitted to the Court in three (3) days and overseen by a qualified public health expert \nagreed upon by the parties or ordered by the Court pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 706, which \noutlines: \na.  Specific mitigation efforts, consistent with CDC guidelines, to significantly reduce \nthe risk of COVID-19 for all class members who remain in DOC custody; and \nb.  An evaluation of whether release of the members of the Medically Vulnerable \nSubclasses permits social distancing by those who remain in DOC custody, or \nwhether DOC must release additional members of the Classes to be in compliance \nwith CDC guidelines. \n4.  A preliminary injunction, permanent injunction, and/or writ of habeas corpus requiring \nDefendants-Respondents to: \na.  Continue to release via habeas or transfers to home confinement, all Medically \n34 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 35 of 37\nVulnerable Subclass members absent proof of judicially-recorded findings by clear \nand convincing evidence that the individual poses such a serious risk of flight or \ndanger to others that no other conditions can mitigate; \nb.  Report weekly on the population of persons in DOC facilities who are Medically \nVulnerable as defined in this action; \nc.  Follow the terms of the public health expert plan submitted pursuant to Fed. R. \nEvid. 706; \nd.  Release via habeas, or transfer to home confinement, additional members of the \nClasses, including those not considered “Medically Vulnerable,” as needed to \nensure  that  all  remaining  persons  incarcerated  in  DOC  facilities  are  under \nconditions consistent with CDC and public health guidance to prevent the spread \nof COVID-19.112 \n5.  If immediate release is not granted on the basis of this Petition alone, then expedited review \nof the Petition, including an evidentiary hearing and/or oral argument, via telephonic or \nvideoconference if necessary. \n6.  A  declaration  that  Defendants-Respondents’  policies  and  actions  have  created \nunconstitutional conditions of confinement and punishment that violate the Eighth and \nFourteenth Amendments. \n7.  An award of Plaintiffs’ attorney fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, 42 U.S.C. § 12205, \nand other applicable law. \n \n112 If, after granting habeas writs and/or transfer orders to home confinement as outlined above, additional \nrelease orders are required to comply with the public health expert plan submitted pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. \n706, Plaintiffs would anticipate moving the Court to convene a three-judge panel pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \n§ 326(a)(3). \n35 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 36 of 37\n8.

JONATHAN LOUIS GOLOB \nI, Jonathan Louis Golob, declare as follows: \n1. I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan School of Medicine in Ann \nArbor, Michigan, where I am a specialist in infectious diseases and internal medicine. I \nam also a member of the Physicians for Human Rights. At the University of Michigan \nSchool of Medicine, I am a practicing physician and a laboratory-based scientist. My \nprimary subspecialization is for infections in immunocompromised patients, and my \nrecent scientific publications focus on how microbes affect immunocompromised people. \nI obtained my medical degree and completed my residency at the University of \nWashington School of Medicine in Seattle, Washington, and also completed a Fellowship \nin Internal Medicine Infectious Disease at the University of Washington. I am actively \ninvolved in the planning and care for patients with COVID-19. Attached as Exhibit A is a \ncopy of my curriculum vitae. \n2.  COVID-19 is an infection caused by a novel zoonotic coronavirus SARS-COV-2 that has \nbeen identified as the cause of a viral outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China in \nDecember 2019. The World Health Organization has declared that COVID-19 is causing \na pandemic. As of April 2, 2020, there are over 800,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 \nworldwide. COVID-19 has caused over 45,000 deaths, with exponentially growing \noutbreaks occurring at multiple sites worldwide, including within the United States in \nregions like New York, New Jersey, Louisiana, Michigan and Illinois. \n3.  COVID-19 makes certain populations of people severely ill. People over the age of fifty \nare at higher risk, with those over 70 at serious risk. As the Center for Disease Control \nand Prevention has advised, certain medical conditions increase the risk of serious \nCOVID-19 for people of any age. These medical conditions include: those with lung \ndisease, heart disease, diabetes, or immunocompromised (such as from cancer, HIV, \nautoimmune diseases), blood disorders (including sickle cell disease), chronic liver or \nkidney disease, inherited metabolic disorders, stroke, developmental delay, or pregnancy. \n4.  For all people, even in advanced countries with very effective health care systems such as \nthe Republic of Korea, the case fatality rate of this infection is about ten fold higher than \nthat observed from a severe seasonal influenza. In the more vulnerable groups, both the \nneed for care, including intensive care, and death is much higher than we observe from \ninfluenza infection: In the highest risk populations, the case fatality rate is about 15%. \nFor high risk patients who do not die from COVID-19, a prolonged recovery is expected \nto be required, including the need for extensive rehabilitation for profound \nPage 1 of 4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1-1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 3 of 11\ndeconditioning, loss of digits, neurologic damage, and loss of respiratory capacity that \ncan be expected from such a severe illness. \n5.  In most people, the virus causes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. In high-risk \nindividuals as noted above, this shortness of breath can often be severe. Even in younger \nand healthier people, infection of this virus requires supportive care, which includes \nsupplemental oxygen, positive pressure ventilation, and in extreme cases, extracorporeal \nmechanical oxygenation. \n6.  The incubation period (between infection and the development of symptoms) for \nCOVID-19 is typically 5 days, but can vary from as short as two days to an infected \nindividual never developing symptoms. There is evidence that transmission can occur \nbefore the development of infection and from infected individuals who never develop \nsymptoms. Thus, only with aggressive testing for SARS-COV-2 can a lack of positive \ntests establish a lack of risk for COVID-19. \n7.  When a community or institution lacks a comprehensive and rigorous testing regime, a \nlack of proven cases of COVID-19 is functionally meaningless for determining if there is \na risk for COVID-19 transmission in a community or institution. \n8.  Most people in the higher risk categories will require more advanced support: positive \npressure ventilation, and in extreme cases, extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation. Such \ncare requires highly specialized equipment in limited supply as well as an entire team of \ncare providers, including but not limited to 1:1 or 1:2 nurse to patient ratios, respiratory \ntherapists and intensive care physicians. This level of support can quickly exceed local \nhealth care resources. \n9.  COVID-19 can severely damage the lung tissue, requiring an extensive period of \nrehabilitation and in some cases a permanent loss of respiratory capacity. The virus also \nseems to target the heart muscle itself, causing a medical condition called mycocarditis, \nor inflammation of the heart muscle. Myocarditis can affect the heart muscle and \nelectrical system, which reduces the heart's ability to pump, leading to rapid or abnormal \nheart rhythms in the short term, and heart failure that limits exercise tolerance and the \nability to work lifelong. There is emerging evidence that the virus can trigger an \nover-response by the immune system in infected people, further damaging tissues. This \ncytokine release syndrome can result in widespread damage to other organs, including \npermanent injury to the kidneys (leading to dialysis dependence) and neurologic injury. \nPage 2 of 4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1-1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 4 of 11\n10. There is no cure and vaccine for this infection. Unlike influenza, there is no known \neffective antiviral medication to prevent or treat infection from COVID-19. Experimental \ntherapies are being attempted. The only known effective measures to reduce the risk for a \nvulnerable person from injury or death from COVID-19 are to prevent individuals from \nbeing infected with the COVID-19 virus. Social distancing, or remaining physically \nseparated from known or potentially infected individuals, and hygiene, including washing \nwith soap and water, are the only known effective measures for protecting vulnerable \ncommunities from COVID-19. \n11. Nationally, without effective public health interventions, CDC projections indicate about \n200 million people in the United States could be infected over the course of the epidemic, \nwith as many as 1.5 million deaths in the most severe projections. Effective public health \nmeasures, including social distancing and hygiene for vulnerable populations, could \nreduce these numbers. \n12.I n early March, the highest known person-to-person transmission rates for COVID-19 \nwere in a skilled nursing facility in Kirkland, Washington and on afflicted cruise ships in \nJapan and off the coast of California. More recently, the highest transmission rates have \nbeen recorded in the Rikers Island jail complex in New York City, which is over seven \ntimes the rate of transmission compared to the spread in New York City. To illustrate, the \nnumber of confirmed cases among inmates soared from one to nearly 200 in the matter of \n12 days. \n13. This is consistent with the spread of previous viruses in congregate settings. During the \nH1N1 influenza (\"Swine Flu\") epidemic in 2009, jails and prisons were sites of severe \noutbreaks of viral infection. Given the avid spread of COVID-19 in skilled nursing \nfacilities and cruise ships, it is reasonable to expect COVID-19 will also readily spread in \ndetention centers such as prisons and jails, particularly when residents cannot engage in \nsocial distancing measures, cannot practice proper hygiene, and cannot isolate themselves \nfrom infected residents or staff With new individuals and staff coming into the detention \ncenters who may be asymptomatic or not yet presenting symptoms, the risk of infection \nrises even with symptom screening measures. \n14. This information provides many reasons to conclude that vulnerable people, people over \nthe age of 50 and people of any age with lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, or \nimmunocompromised (such as from cancer, HIV, autoimmune diseases), blood disorders \n(including sickle cell disease), chronic liver or kidney disease, inherited metabolic \ndisorders, stroke, developmental delay, or pregnancy living in an institutional setting, \nsuch as a prison, or jail, or an immigration detention center, with limited access to \nPage 3 of 4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1-1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 5 of 11\nadequate hygiene facilities, limited ability to physically distance themselves from others, \nand exposure to potentially infected individuals from the community are at grave risk of \nsevere illness and death from COVID-19. \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746,1 declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and \ncorrect. \nExecuted this ,3 day in April, 2020 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. \nDr. Jonathan Louis Golob \nPage 4 of 4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1-1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 6 of 11\nJonathan Louis Golob, M.D. Ph.D. \nAssistant Professor \n206 992-0428 (c) 734-647-3870 (o) \ngolobj@med.umich.edu jonathan@golob.org \n\t\nEducation and Training \n6/1997 – 6/2001  Bachelor of Science, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD \nDual degree in Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science \nconferred June 2001. \n \n7/2001 – 6/2011  MSTP MD/PhD Combined Degree, University of Washington, \nSeattle, WA.  \nPh.D. on the basic science of embryonic stem cells, specifically \nepigenetic regulation of differentiation \nPh.D. conferred in June 2009.  \nMD conferred in June 2011.  \n \n6/2011 – 6/2013  Internal Medicine Residency, University of Washington, \nSeattle, WA \n \n6/2013 – 6/2017  Infectious Diseases Fellowship, University of Washington, \nSeattle, WA \n \nCertifications and Licensure \nBoard Certifications \n  2014  Diplomate in Internal Medicine, American Board of Internal Medicine. \n  2016  Diplomate in Infectious Disease, American Board of Internal Medicine. \n \nCurrent Medical Licenses to Practice \n  2013   Washington State Medical License, Physician, MD60394350 \n  2018  Michigan State Medical License, Physician, 4301114297 \n\t\nAcademic, Administrative, and Clinical Appointments  \nAcademic \n6/2014 – 6/2018   Senior Fellow, Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred \nHutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA  \n \n8/2016 – 6/2018   Joel Meyers Endowment Fellow, Vaccine and Infectious \nDisease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, \nSeattle, WA \n \n8/2017 – 6/2018  Research Associate, Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, \nFred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA  \n \n8/2017 – 6/2018  Acting Instructor, Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, \nDepartment of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA \n \n8/2018 – Present  Assistant Professor, Division of Infectious Diseases, \nDepartment of Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, \nMI \nJonathan\tLouis\tGolob\tM.D.\tPh.D.\t January\t24\t2020\t Page\t1\tof\t6\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1-1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 7 of 11\n \n\t\nClinical \n12/2015 – 12/2016   Infectious Disease Locums Physician, Virginia Mason Medical \nCenter, Seattle, WA \n \n7/2017 – 6/2018  Hospitalist Internal Medicine Physician, Virginia Mason \nMedical Center, Seattle, WA \n \n8/2017 – 6/2018  Attending Physician, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, WA \n \n8/2017 – 6/2018  Attending Physician, Division of Allergy and Infectious \nDiseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, \nSeattle, WA \n \n8/2018 – Present  Attending Physician, Division of Infectious Diseases, \nDepartment of Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, \nMI \n \n\t\nResearch Interests \n1.  I am primarily interested in understanding how the human gut microbiome \nmechanistically affects how patients respond to treatments. I have a particular focus on \npatients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplant, who are at risk for recurrence of their \nunderlying disease, treatment-related colitis (from both conditioning and graft versus host \ndisease), and infection. In human observational trials the human gut microbiome \ncorrelates with each of these aspects. My research program uses advanced stem-cell \nbased in-vitro models of the human colonic mucosa to verify if the correlations in \nobservational trials can cause similar effects in vitro, and then determine by which \npathways (e.g. receptors) and broad mechanisms (e.g. epigenetics) the microbes affect the \nhost. \n \n2.  Host-microbiome interactions are contextual. A beneficial interaction in health can turn \npathologic. For example, my ongoing work focused on the microbial metabolite butyrate. \nButyrate enhances the health of heathy and intact colonic epithelium, acting as a substrate \nfor cellular respiration and through receptor-mediate processes reduces cellular \ninflammation. However, butyrate also blocks the ability of colonic stem cells to \ndifferentiate into mature epithelium. Thus, in colitis that results in a loss of colonic \ncrypts, an intact and butyrogenic gut microbiome results in colonic stem cells being \nexposed to butyrate and inhibits recovery. My ongoing work uses a primary stem-cell \nbased model of the human colonic mucusa to establish how butyrate blocks the \ndifferentiation of colonic stem cell with a hope of generating new treatments for patients \nwith steroid-refractory colitis. \n \n3.  I am interested in validating and improving computational tools for biological research. I \nhave a computer science and biomedical engineering background that combined with my \nclinical and molecular biology training positions me optimally to understand both major \naspects of computational biology: what are the needs to make biological inferences from \nbig data, and how can tools specifically be improved to achieve such inferences.  \n \nJonathan\tLouis\tGolob\tM.D.\tPh.D.\t January\t24\t2020\t Page\t2\tof\t6\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1-1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 8 of 11\nGrants \nPresent and Active \nASBMT New Investigator Award J.

I am a doctor duly licensed to practice medicine in the State of New York. I am board-\ncertified in internal medicine and addiction medicine. I received my Bachelor of Science\ndegree from Boston College, and my Medical Degree from Mount Sinai School of\nMedicine.\n2. I am currently the Medical Director, Addiction Medicine & Drug User Health at Project\nRenewal and a Clinical Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine at Albert\nEinstein College of Medicine.\n3. Between August 2016 and January 2020, I was an Attending Physician and the Clinical\nDirector of Substance Use Treatment for NYC Health & Hospitals, Division of\nCorrectional Health Services at Rikers Island. During this time, I provided primary\nmedical care to detainees and sentenced patients, and supervised the nation’s oldest and\nlargest jail-based opioid treatment program. I successfully led an effort to remove non-\nclinical barriers to opioid treatment program enrollment in 2017, which dramatically\nexpanded treatment access from 25% to over 80%, while also reducing post-release\nmortality for people with opioid use disorder.\n4. I have extensive experience working with vulnerable populations such as the incarcerated\nand those experiencing homelessness.\n5. In the course of my duties as Clinical Director of Substance Use Treatment for NYC\nHealth & Hospitals, Division of Correctional Health Services at Rikers Island, I entered\nevery facility in the New York City Department of Correction. I have firsthand\nknowledge of the various housing types—from dormitory housing to single-cell units—in\ncorrectional facilities.\nThe Coronavirus Pandemic\n6. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the rapidly spreading\noutbreak of COVID-19, a respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus, is a\npandemic, announcing that the virus is both highly contagious and deadly. To date, the\nvirus is known to spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets, close\npersonal contact, and from contact with contaminated surfaces and objects. The CDC also\nwarns of “community spread” where the virus spreads easily and sustainably within a\ncommunity where the source of the infection is unknown.\n7. There is currently no vaccine or cure. The primary focus is on preventing the spread of\nthe virus at this juncture. To prevent new infections, the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention strongly recommend the following actions: thorough and frequent\nhandwashing, cleaning surfaces with EPA-approved disinfectants, keeping at least six\n1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1-2   Filed 04/20/20   Page 3 of 7\nfeet of space between people, and avoiding group settings. Social distancing has also \nbeen encouraged to slow the rate of COVID-19 infections so that hospitals have the \nresources to address infected individuals with urgent medical needs. In correctional \nsettings, such sanitation, social distancing, and self-quarantining measures are nearly \nimpossible.  \n \n8.  Experts continue to learn more about the transmission of novel coronavirus. Recent \nevidence has aided scientists and healthcare professionals in understanding why COVID-\n19 spreads so rapidly and dangerously. While it is well-known that symptomatic people \ntransmit the virus, two additional transmission categories are essential to understanding \nthe alarming rate of infection linked with the novel coronavirus: (1) asymptomatic \ntransmission, or people who are infected and contagious but never display the symptoms \nassociated with COVID-19, and (2) presymptomatic transmission, or people who are \ncontagious before they begin to show symptoms.  \n \n9.  On April 1, 2020, the CDC published a critically important study finding evidence of \npresymptomatic transmission.1 In it, the CDC warned that “[t]he potential for \npresymptomatic transmission underscores the importance of social distancing, \nincluding the avoidance of congregate settings, to reduce COVID-19 spread” \n(emphasis added).2  \n \n10.  Given what we now know about how the novel coronavirus spreads and how often \ntransmission occurs when an infected person is not displaying any symptoms whatsoever, \neven robust efforts to screen symptoms and isolate presumed positives are not enough to \nprevent transmission. Any system that relies on such a screening model will not stop the \nspread of the virus. From what we have learned, a combination of genuine and strict \nsocial distancing, handwashing, sanitation, and widespread testing and contact tracing are \nthe measures effective to protect populations from rapid infection.  \n \n11.  The Centers for Disease Control have identified two groups of people at higher risk of \ncontracting and succumbing to COVID-19: adults over 60 years old and people with \nchronic medical conditions. COVID-19 is more dangerous to persons in these high-risk \ngroups than to the general population. Older people who contract COVID-19 are more \nlikely to die than people under the age of 60. It has been found that older people \ndiagnosed with COVID-19 are more likely to be very sick and require hospitalization to \nsurvive because the acute symptoms include respiratory distress, cardiac injury, \narrhythmia, septic shock, liver dysfunction, kidney injury and multi-organ failure. Access \nto a mechanical ventilator is often required. People with chronic medical conditions (no \nmatter their age) are also at significantly greater risk from COVID-19 because their \nalready-weakened systems are less able to fight the virus. These chronic medical \nconditions include lung disease, cancer, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal \n \n1 Presymptomatic Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 — Singapore, January 23–March 16, 2020. \nMMWR.

Those \nwith pre-existing medical conditions have a higher probability of death if infected. \n \nCOVID-19 Within Correctional Settings \n \n12.  Based on my years of providing medical care at Rikers Island, I know that correctional \nsettings increase the risk of contracting an infectious disease like COVID-19. This is \nbecause there are high numbers of people with chronic, often untreated, illnesses housed \nin a setting with minimal levels of sanitation, limited access to personal hygiene, limited \naccess to medical care, and no possibility of staying at a distance from others. \n \n13.  Correctional facilities house large groups of inmates together, and move inmates in \ngroups to eat, bathe, and recreate. They frequently have insufficient medical care for the \npopulation, and, in times of crisis, even those medical staff cease coming to the facility. \nHot water, soap, disinfectants, and paper towels are frequently in limited supply, and \ninmates, rather than professional cleaners, are responsible for cleaning the facilities.  \nAs a result, there are more people susceptible to getting infected congregated together in \na context in which fighting the spread of an infection is nearly impossible. \n \n14.  Indeed, outbreaks of the flu regularly occur in jails, and during the H1N1 epidemic in \n2009, many jails and prisons dealt with high numbers of cases. In the current outbreak, \nRikers Island went from just one confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 18 to 231 \nconfirmed cases in just two weeks.3  \n \nCOVID-19 and the Physical Infrastructure of Prison \n \n15.  I understand that Connecticut correctional settings are a mix of dormitory settings and \nsingle-cell settings. Both settings pose significant challenges to the ability of staff and \nincarcerated people alike to abide by CDC guidelines. \n \n16.  Dorm housing areas are particular breeding grounds for COVID-19. Beds in these units \nare typically in one room, and far less than six feet apart. People housed in dorms must \nshare common sinks, toilets, showers, phones, tables and chairs.  \n \n17.  Adequately sanitizing a space with those characteristics would require constant diligence \nand a continuous abundance of cleaning supplies. Cleaning once a day, or even a few \ntimes a day, would not prevent transmission of the virus. Social distancing, even at \nsignificantly reduced capacity, is virtually impossible due to the physical realities of the \nshared spaces in the dorms and the difficulty of adequately sanitizing a space inhabited \nby a constantly rotating population of incarcerated people and staff.  \n \n3 Compare As Testing Expands, Confirmed Cases of Coronavirus in N.Y.C.

Single-cell housing areas also pose elevated risk of transmitting the virus. Though single \ncell units are typically equipped with a toilet and sink, incarcerated people must leave the \ncell for many reasons: to use a shared shower, or to go to the clinic, or potentially to use a \nshared phone or perform a job. Meals are still prepared and delivered from other parts of \nthe jail. Incarcerated people housed in single cells are also subject to exposure from the \nmyriad operational characteristics endemic in the jail setting, described below. All of \nthese factors demonstrate the difficulty of effective social distancing and sanitation even \nin more isolated single-cell units.  \n \nCOVID-19 and the Operational Characteristics of Prison \n \n19.  My experience in correctional health also exposed me to the limitations of correctional \nhealth care. Similar to an outpatient primary care clinic, correctional health care is \ndesigned to provide urgent care for ailments that are non-life threatening. It is not capable \nof providing the type of care one receives in a hospital, let alone in an intensive care unit. \nAs a result, when an incarcerated person requires hospitalization or intensive care, they \nare transferred to a hospital in the community. During my time at Rikers Island, we \nroutinely transferred incarcerated people to community hospitals to receive care that we \ncould not provide at the facility.  \n \n20.  For prison systems that are already understaffed, staffing shortages will only increase as \nemployees need to stay home to care for children whose schools are closed, elderly \nfamily members, and—if infected or exposed to infection—themselves. With fewer staff, \ncorrectional officers are even less able to monitor prisoners’ health.  \n \n21.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, these limitations in correctional health care have \nimportant public health implications not just for incarcerated populations, but for the \ngeneral population as well. According to the most recent estimates, at least 15% of people \nwho contract COVID19 will require hospitalization, and 5% will require intensive care. \nBased on the vulnerability of the incarcerated population, it is likely that these numbers \nwould be at least as high, if not higher, within a correctional setting. \n \n22.  A person who contracts COVID-19 in jail or prison and requires hospitalization will need \nto be transferred to a community hospital. As a result, the problem of a prison outbreak of \nCOVID-19 infections cannot and will not be contained within the institution itself. \nInstead, it will explode into the community, increasing the pressure on our already taxed \ncommunity hospitals. \n \n23.  Even at baseline, ICU beds and ventilators in our community hospitals are a scarce \ncommodity. A recent analysis by the Harvard Global Health Institute indicates that under \nmost scenarios, “vast communities in America are not prepared to take care of the \nCOVID-19 patients” that require hospital care. An outbreak of COVID-19 at a jail or \nprison, which would likely require numerous transfers to a community hospital, could \npush a hospital even further past its breaking point. Specifically, a surge in COVID-19 \n4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1-2   Filed 04/20/20   Page 6 of 7\ninfections in a correctional setting could mean that ICU beds in the community hospital \nwould no longer be available to everyone who needed them. \n \n24.  A final characteristic of prison that must be considered in the instant health crisis is the \ninevitable operational gaps in a system of Connecticut’s size and the risks that those gaps \npose to staff and people in custody. DOC’s filings contain descriptions of policies that \nwould certainly play a critical role in reducing the harm from the COVID-19 pandemic: \nfrequent and thorough cleaning and sanitizing regimens, ongoing health education, and \nadequate provision of soap, sinks, and cleaning supplies. In order to be effective, of \ncourse, policies must be implemented with fidelity and require adequate staffing levels to \ndo so. In my time in correctional health, I witnessed many instances in which execution \nof policies relating to sanitation, provision of basic items, and other requirements fell \nshort. When staffing levels are short and the numbers of those infected continue to rise, I \nremain gravely concerned that people in custody do not have the supplies and \nenvironmental controls  necessary to protect them and staff from the pandemic, \nnotwithstanding effort to create policies to address this problem.  \n \nCorrectional Settings Cannot Be Equipped to Keep People Safe from COVID-19 \n \n25.  Every effort should be made to reduce chances of exposure to COVID-19. However, \nbased on my experience in correctional health, I do not believe that screening, social \ndistancing, and quarantining measures can be sufficiently employed within correctional \nsettings to combat the spread of COVID-19.  \n \n26.  Correctional settings simply cannot be equipped to keep people safe during this \npandemic. There are too many structural limitations, and correctional health care can only \ndo so much. Decreasing the incarcerated population so that there is more ability to \nphysically distance within the facility, fewer people who can contract the virus inside the \nfacility, and more medical care for those who need it is the only way to prevent the \ncomplications from surging. Otherwise, the unchecked transmission of COVID-19 in jail \nor prison will have serious, and fatal, implications for the broader community. \n \n27.  Decreasing the incarcerated population will also decrease the necessary staffing for the \nfacility and protect staff from exposure. Reducing the number of needed correctional \nofficers and healthcare workers will, in turn, reduce the number of people entering and \nexiting the facility on a daily basis. This too will reduce the spread of COVID-19 to the \nbroader community. \n \n28.  It is my professional opinion that these steps are both necessary and urgent, and that \nreducing population via standard, one-by-one mechanisms will fall far short of what is \nrequired to prevent a public health crisis. The infection rate inside Rikers is now eight \ntimes higher than the infection rate in New York City. I understand that Connecticut has \ngone from one incarcerated person testing positive to 182 positive tests in two weeks, \nalong with 118 staff. These surging numbers mean that, without immediate action, \nConnecticut will likely follow the same trajectory.  \n \n5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1-2   Filed 04/20/20   Page 7 of 7\nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \nExecuted on April ____, 2020 in New York, New York.  \n__________________________________ \nJonathan Giftos, M.D. \n6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1-3   Filed 04/20/20   Page 1 of 18\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT C \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1-3   Filed 04/20/20   Page 2 of 18\nDeclaration of Dr. Josiah Rich, M.D., MPH \n \n1.  I am a doctor duly licensed to practice medicine in the state of Rhode Island.  \n2.  I am currently Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at The Warren Alpert \nMedical School of Brown University, and the Director and Co-founder of The Center for \nPrisoner Health and Human Rights at The Miriam Hospital.  \n3.  I have been a practicing Infectious Disease Specialist since 1994. I provide \nclinical care at The Miriam Hospital Immunology Center, as well as at the Rhode Island \nDepartment of Corrections, where I care for prisoners with HIV infection and work in the \ncorrectional setting doing research.  \n4.  My primary field and area of specialization and expertise is in the overlap \nbetween infectious diseases and illicit substance use, the treatment and prevention of HIV \ninfection, and the care and prevention of disease in addicted and incarcerated individuals. I am \nan elected member of the National Academy of Medicine and I have served as an expert for the \nNational Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, and many others. I have also been \nappointed by Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo to the Overdose Prevention and \nIntervention Task Force Expert Team. I have published close to 190 peer-reviewed publications, \npredominantly in the overlap between infectious diseases, addictions, and incarceration.  \n5.  The matters that I discuss below are proceeding at a rapid pace across the country. \nI have published about these urgent concerns in the New England Journal of Medicine, the \nWashington Post, and elsewhere. I attach copies of those articles to this affidavit.    \n \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1-3   Filed 04/20/20   Page 3 of 18\nThe extreme challenges Covid-19 poses for Connecticut’s prison system.  \n6.  As we are quickly seeing throughout the United States and the world, highly \ntransmissible novel respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2—the virus that causes Covid-\n19—create a perfect storm for correctional settings.   \n7.  First, correctional settings are ideal for rapid spread of viruses that are transmitted \nperson-to-person, especially those passed by droplets through coughing and sneezing. When \npeople must share dayrooms, bathrooms, showers, and other common areas, the opportunities for \ntransmission are great. And while there continues to be disagreement about whether SARS-CoV-\n2 is an airborne virus, in the context of limited information, we must assume that it is. In that \ncase, the poor ventilation systems within correctional facilities will ensure maximal opportunities \nfor transmission.  \n8.  When viruses are transmitted from person to person, the best initial strategy is to \npractice social distancing. Yet social distancing is extremely challenging in correctional settings. \nEven when facilities are locked down and use of common space are limited, there is inevitably \nfrequent contact among prisoners, and especially between prisoners and staff. Even a quick cell \nchange or shower involves multiple opportunities for contact with others. Accordingly, no matter \nwhat measures we take, correctional facilities are congregate settings that are poorly designed to \nprevent the inevitable rapid and widespread dissemination of this virus.  \n9.  I understand that Connecticut, like other systems, has suspended visitation and \nfacility transfers, and has taken certain other measures to try to limit infection. Irrespective of \nthese interventions, however, infected persons—especially staff members—will inevitably \ncontinue to enter correctional settings. It is essential to understand that, despite being physically \nsecure, jails and prisons are not isolated from the community. Rather, the boundaries between \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1-3   Filed 04/20/20   Page 4 of 18\ncorrectional institutions and the communities in which they sit are extremely porous. Staff, \nvisitors, contractors, and vendors pass between communities and facilities and can bring \ninfectious diseases into facilities. Moreover, population turnover means that people cycle \nbetween facilities and communities. And people often need to be transported to and from \nfacilities, including for disciplinary and/or quarantining purposes. All of this is problematic in \nthe context of this pandemic: While entry temperature checks may be effective screening \nmechanisms for symptomatic infections, they are ineffective with SARS-CoV-2 due to high rates \nof asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infection.  \n10.  Moreover, there are reduced prevention opportunities in prisons. During an \ninfectious disease outbreak, free people can protect themselves by washing hands. Correctional \nfacilities do not provide adequate opportunities to exercise necessary hygiene measures, such as \nfrequent handwashing or use of alcohol-based sanitizers when handwashing is unavailable. \nThese facilities are often under-resourced and ill-equipped with sufficient hand soap and alcohol-\nbased sanitizers for both people detained in and working in these settings. High-touch surfaces \n(doorknobs, light switches, etc.) should also be cleaned and disinfected regularly with bleach to \nprevent virus spread, but bleach is often unavailable, and cleaning agents used by correctional \nsettings may not have been shown to effectively neutralize this virus, particularly in the diluted \nform commonly employed. There may also be a lack of people available to perform necessary \ncleaning procedures, which is exacerbated as people fall ill and movement is restricted.  \n11.  A containment strategy for this virus requires both widespread screening and that \npeople who are symptomatic be immediately isolated. It also requires that correctional officers \nand caregivers have access to personal protective equipment, including gloves, masks, gowns, \nand face shields. Yet correctional settings are often under-resourced and ill-equipped to provide \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1-3   Filed 04/20/20   Page 5 of 18\nsufficient personal protective equipment for people who are incarcerated and caregiving staff, \nincreasing the risk for everyone in the facility where an outbreak is occurring. Correctional \nsettings are also unlikely to be able to perform the widespread screening and contact-tracing \nnecessary to prevent further infection.  \n12.  All of the above is compounded by the fact that half of all incarcerated people in \nthe United States have at least one chronic disease. With limited ability to protect themselves and \nothers by self-isolating, thousands of susceptible people are at heightened risk for severe illness.  \n \nLessening the spread of Covid-19 requires urgent, scaled-up decarceration. \n13.  The more preemptive measures taken by legal, public health, and correctional \nhealth partnerships, the lighter the burden the correctional facilities and their surrounding \ncommunities will bear. The global context offers some precedent here. Iran, for example, \nresponded to its escalating pandemic by releasing 70,000 prisoners, something that may have \nhelped “bend the curve” of that country’s epidemic. Conversely, failure to calm incarcerated \npopulations in Italy led to widespread rioting in Italian prisons.  \n14.  At minimum, Connecticut must be prepared to isolate and separate incarcerated \npersons who are infected and those who are under investigation for possible infection from the \ngeneral prison population; to hospitalize those who are seriously ill; and to cope with the high \nburden of disease and severe staff shortages that are likely to come. \n15.  But this won’t be enough. I understand that as of April 15, 2020, there were 199 \nconfirmed positive COVID-19 cases among incarcerated people in Connecticut, and 139 \nconfirmed positive cases among DOC staff. I also understand that Connecticut is transitioning \npeople who test positive to the state’s maximum security prison. This raises the concern that \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1-3   Filed 04/20/20   Page 6 of 18\nincarcerated people will be deterred from reporting symptoms of COVID-19 or seeking medical \nattention. It is also not clear to me how a maximum security prison is positioned to provide the \nlevel of medical care and observation that COVID-19 patients may require, including a low \nprovider-to-patient ratio and specialized medical equipment. While the initial presentation of \nCOVID-19 may seem mild, I have seen from firsthand experience that patients can \ndecompensate rapidly, requiring intubation and ICU-level care in a matter of hours.  Finally, \nwhile current guidelines by the CDC recommend that patients be quarantined for 14 days or 72 \nhours without symptoms, whichever is longer, we know that some patients continue to shed the \nvirus for as long as 30 days.  \n16.  As shown by the drastic surge in COVID-19 positive cases within DOC in a very \nshort period of time, it is imperative to scale up efforts to “decarcerate,” or release, as many \npeople as possible, including those detained on bail. Each person needlessly infected in a \ncorrectional setting who develops severe illness will be one too many. And public safety will be \nat even greater peril if we fail to mitigate risks associated with confining too many people in \ncorrectional facilities during a pandemic. \n17.  It is my strong opinion that urgent decarceration is imperative to flatten the curve \nof Covid-19 cases among incarcerated populations and to limit the impact of transmission both \ninside correctional facilities and in the community. The abrupt onset of severe Covid-19 \ninfections among incarcerated individuals will require mass transfers to local hospitals for \nintensive medical and ventilator care—highly expensive interventions are already in very short \nsupply. Each severely ill patient coming from the Department of Correction who occupies an \nICU bed may mean others may die for inability to obtain care. These are preventable infections, \nand we should act to prevent them.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1-3   Filed 04/20/20   Page 7 of 18\n \n \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and \ncorrect.  \n \nExecuted on April ____, 2020 in _____________________________.  \n \n \n__________________________________ \nDr. Josiah Rich \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1-3   Filed 04/20/20   Page 8 of 18\n NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL   MEDICINE\nThe of\nPerspective\n \n  \n \nFlattening the Curve for Incarcerated Populations —  \nCovid-19 in Jails and Prisons\nMatthew J.

As the country prepares for further spread of the\npandemic, authorities should take immediate steps to limit the risk posed by mass\nconfinement, including releasing those detained on bail, along with elderly\nprisoners who pose little danger to the public.\nEarly on in this pandemic, we learned that, as with other closed spaces such as\ncruise ships and nursing homes, the covid-19 coronavirus spread rapidly in Chinese\ncorrectional facilities.

People continuously enter and leave,\nincluding multiple shifts of corrections staff; newly arrested, charged and sentenced\nindividuals; attorneys; and visitors. Even if this flow is limited to the extent\npossible, correctional facilities remain densely populated and poorly designed to\nprevent the inevitable rapid and widespread dissemination of this virus.\nAt the same time, jails and prisons house individuals at higher risk than in other\nsettings, such as schools and restaurants, that have been closed to mitigate\ncontamination. Although corrections facilities cannot be closed, they must be\nincluded in any plan aimed at slowing the surge in infections and protecting public\nsafety.\nReassessing security and public health risks and acting immediately will save the\nlives of not only those incarcerated but also correctional staff and their families and\nthe community at large. There are several steps that authorities should implement\nas quickly as possible.\nAD\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/17/we-must-release-prisoners-lessen-spread-coronavirus/ 2/8\n\n4/20/2020 Case 3:20-cv-0W0e 5m3us4t -reJleBaAse   p rDisoonecrus mto leesnste n1 t-h3e  s p rFeailde odf  c0or4on/2av0ir/u2s 0- T  h eP Waagshein 1gt3on  oPof s1t8\nThey must screen incoming individuals to prevent and delay infected individuals\nfrom entering facilities. They must rapidly identify cases and isolate exposed groups\nto limit the spread, as well as quickly transfer seriously ill patients to appropriate\nfacilities.\nBut that won’t be enough. Authorities should release those who do not pose an\nimmediate danger to public safety, while also reducing arrests and delaying\nsentencings. These moves carry inherent political risks, but they are for the greater\ngood of the public at large. The abrupt onset of severe covid-19 infections among\nincarcerated individuals will require mass transfers to local hospitals for intensive\nmedical and ventilator care — highly expensive interventions that may soon be in\nvery short supply. Each severely ill patient coming from corrections who occupies\nan ICU bed will mean others may die for inability to obtain care.\nOur ability to release people rapidly will vary by type of facility and jurisdiction.\nThose being held in jails simply due to their inability to afford bail, or for minor\ninfractions or violations, can generally be released promptly by the judiciary or even\nthe local sheriff. Some jurisdictions are already discussing such mitigation efforts.\nAD\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/17/we-must-release-prisoners-lessen-spread-coronavirus/ 3/8\n\n4/20/2020 Case 3:20-cv-0W0e 5m3us4t -reJleBaAse   p rDisoonecrus mto leesnste n1 t-h3e  s p rFeailde odf  c0or4on/2av0ir/u2s 0- T  h eP Waagshein 1gt4on  oPof s1t8\nAlready sentenced individuals pose a greater challenge — one compounded by the\npunitive policies of the past few decades (mandatory minimum sentences, three\nstrikes and life without parole) that have led to a large, aging incarcerated\npopulation especially vulnerable to severe disease. Additionally, half of all\nincarcerated people suffer from at least one chronic illness, which means even more\nwill be at risk of a poor prognosis if they become infected.\nThose eligible for parole can and should be released. Provisions for “compassionate\nrelease/parole” exist in every state; however, that process is typically slow,\nunderutilized and very limited. Fortunately, the people at highest risk for severe\ncomplications of covid-19 who are incarcerated (the aging and chronically ill), are,\non average, the least likely to commit a new crime or need to be re-incarcerated. In\nsome states, governors have the ability to commute sentences or pardon\nindividuals, as does the president in the federal system.\nOn the federal level as well, there is a parallel public health danger lurking in the\nimmigration detention system, where thousands of people are being held in jail-like\nconditions that pose similar risks. The Trump administration could, if it wished,\ninstitute a simple and even temporary policy change to release those individuals\ninto the community rather than contain them in an environment where rapid\nspread is likely. As unlikely as this may be given the administration’s approach to\nimmigration detention, this may be the easiest fix, given the broad discretion of the\nDepartment of Homeland Security to change policy.\nAD\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/17/we-must-release-prisoners-lessen-spread-coronavirus/ 4/8\n\n4/20/2020 Case 3:20-cv-0W0e 5m3us4t -reJleBaAse   p rDisoonecrus mto leesnste n1 t-h3e  s p rFeailde odf  c0or4on/2av0ir/u2s 0- T  h eP Waagshein 1gt5on  oPof s1t8\nThe spread of the coronavirus may only be the tipping point for what can happen\nwhen we fail to consider all the costs and consequences of our system of mass\nincarceration.

I am a doctor licensed to practice medicine in the State of California.  \n2.  I  am  currently  a  Professor  of  Medicine  at  the  University  of  California,  San \nFrancisco  (“UCSF”)  in  the  Geriatrics  Division,  Director  of  UCSF’s  Amend:  Changing \nCorrectional Culture Program, as well as Director of UCSF’s Criminal Justice & Health Program. \nIn that capacity, my clinical research has focused on improved responses to disability, cognitive \nimpairment, and symptom distress in older or seriously ill prisoners; a more scientific development \nof compassionate release policies; and a broader inclusion of prisoners in national health datasets \nand in clinical research.  I have developed new methods for responding to the unique health needs \nof criminal justice-involved older adults—including an evidence-based approach to reforming \ncompassionate release policies and the design of a new tool to assess physical functioning in older \nprisoners.  I was previously a consultant for the California Department of Corrections and \nRehabilitation, as well as for other state prison systems.    \n3.  I have extensive experience working with vulnerable populations, in particular the \nincarcerated and the elderly.  \nThe Risk of Infection and Accelerated Transmission of COVID-19 within Jails and Prisons \nis Extraordinarily High. \n \n4.  Prisons and jails are not actually isolated from our communities: hundreds of \nthousands of correctional officers and correctional healthcare workers enter these facilities every \nday, returning to their families and to our communities at the end of their shifts, bringing back \nand forth to their families and neighbors and to incarcerated patients any exposures they have \nhad during the day.  Access to testing for correctional staff has been “extremely limited,” \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 1-4   Filed 04/20/20   Page 3 of 8\n \nguards—including, as I understand, those in Connecticut—have reported a very “short supply” \nof protective equipment, and prisons are not routinely or consistently screening correctional \nofficers for symptoms.1 \n5.  The risk of exposure is particularly acute in pre-trial facilities where the inmate \npopulations shift frequently.2  For example, despite the federal government’s guidance to stay \ninside and many states’ stay-in-place orders, many prosecutors are still arresting individuals and \nseeking detention.3   Pre-trial detention facilities are still accepting new inmates who are coming \nfrom communities where COVID-19 infection is rampant.   \n6.  Because inmates live in close quarters, there is an extraordinarily high risk of \naccelerated transmission of COVID-19 within jails and prisons.  Inmates share small cells, eat \ntogether and use the same bathrooms and sinks.  In dorm settings, they eat together at small tables \nthat are cleaned only irregularly.  Some are not given tissues or sufficient hygiene supplies.4  \n \n1 Keegan Hamilton, Sick Staff, Inmate Transfers, and No Tests: How the U.S. Is Failing Federal Inmates as \nCoronavirus Hits, Vice (Mar. 24, 2020), https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/jge4vg/sick-staff-inmate-transfers-and-\nno-tests-how-the-us-is-failing-federal-inmates-as-coronavirus-hits. \n \nSee also Daniel A.

Jails and prisons are fundamentally ill-equipped to handle a pandemic.  Medical \ntreatment capacity is not at the same level in a correctional setting as it is in a hospital.  Some \ncorrectional facilities have no formal medical ward and no place to quarantine sick inmates, other \nthan the facilities’ Special Housing Unit (SHU).20  While the cells in the SHU often have solid \ndoors to minimize the threat of viral spread in otherwise overcrowded facilities, they rarely have \nintercoms or other ways for sick inmates to contact officers in an emergency.21  This is particularly \ndangerous for those with COVID-19 infection since many patients with COVID-19 descend \nsuddenly and rapidly into respiratory distress.22 \n15.  Even those facilities that do have healthcare centers can only treat relatively mild \ntypes of respiratory problems for a very limited number of people.23  This means that people who \nbecome seriously ill while in prisons and jails will be transferred to community hospitals for care.  \nAt present, access to palliative care in prison is also limited. \n16.  Corrections officers may also be particularly vulnerable to coronavirus due to \ndocumented high rates of diabetes and heart disease.24  Multiple prison staff in Connecticut, like \nthose in Pennsylvania, Michigan, New York and Washington state, among others, have tested \n \n20 MCC New York COVID 19 Policy Memo, Mar. 19, 2020, https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6818073-\nMCC-New-York-COVID-19-Policy-Memo.html; Danielle Ivory, ‘We Are Not a Hospital’: A Prison Braces for the \nCoronavirus, N.Y.

Four of the named Petitioners are \nlawfully incarcerated inmates held by the Connecticut Department of Correction (DOC).  One \nproposed class is comprised of inmates currently serving sentences imposed by judges of the \nConnecticut Superior Court.  The other class is comprised of pre-trial detainees held on bonds set \nby Superior Court judges.  Within each of the two putative classes, Petitioners propose \nsubclasses of “medically vulnerable” inmates who have a greater risk should they contract the \nCOVID-19 virus.  Respondents are the Governor of Connecticut, Ned Lamont, and \nCommissioner of Correction Rollin Cook.   \n  Respondents respectfully submit that the Court should deny the Petitioners’ Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction.  As set forth herein, and maintaining Respondents’ challenges to this \nCourt’s jurisdiction, Petitioners have failed to meet the high burden of a mandatory injunction.   \nPetitioners have failed to establish a “clear” or “substantial” showing of likelihood of success on \nthe merits in that they cannot establish either Respondent has violated the Eighth or Fourteenth \nAmendment rights of any putative class members.  Even if Petitioners could meet this heavy \nburden, their reckless request to release thousands of inmates en masse with no method of \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 2 of 42\nmonitoring them, no plan for their housing or medical care, and no plan for when, if, or how they \nwould be returned to custody, is so inimical to the public interest as to warrant denial on these \ngrounds alone.   \nI.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n \nA.  Petitioners seek the mass release of inmates in both their Petition and their \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction. \n \nOn April 20, 2020, Petitioners filed the current action against Respondents.  In their \nPetition (Doc. #1) the individually named Petitioners identify themselves as inmates held in \nvarious DOC facilities, and some allege that they have pre-existing health conditions or are \notherwise in an age group that places them at “significantly higher risk of severe disease and \ndeath if they contract [COVID-19].”  (Doc. #1 at 2, ¶1.)  They seek the “immediate release” of \nnumerous, indeed potentially thousands, of inmates who are “50 and older and those with \nmedical conditions that place them at heightened risk of severe illness or death from COVID-\n19.”  (Id.)  Critically, the Petition and the motion papers lack any allegations or requests for relief \nthat would suggest how any putative class1 members would be managed or cared for if released \nto the community.2  They also make no allegation or requests explaining how, when or even if, \nthese released inmates would be returned to custody. \n \n1 There is no motion pending for class certification, and Respondents will oppose class certification as the individual \npublic safety risk issues that pertain to each offender, and the unique health concerns would necessarily require that \nthe individual issues would predominate over the common issues to the putative class. Further, it is impossible to \ndetermine who is medically “vulnerable” and thus it would be impossible to determine who would be in the class and \nwho would be excluded.  \n2 Although unclear, it appears that Petitioners envision a state court process for reviewing individuals subject to \nrelease so that the State can hold in custody those individuals for whom there are “judicially-recorded findings by \nclear and convincing evidence that the individual poses such a serious risk of flight or danger to others that no other \nconditions can mitigate.”  (Doc. #1 at 34.)  Nowhere in their Petition or motion papers do they cite authority for the \nproposition that the State, its courts or any of its criminal justice agencies bear such a burden of proof anywhere and \nin any context.  Nor do they explain how a state court would have jurisdiction to decide whether previously \nsentenced inmates “pose such a serious risk of flight or danger to others that no other conditions can mitigate.”  The \nstate courts have already made such determinations in the first instance. \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 3 of 42\nOn May 10, 2020, Petitioners filed a motion for preliminary injunction.  (Doc. #43.)  \nPetitioners seek a mandatory, permanent injunction compelling Respondents to release state \ninmates from custody and to submit for court review certain plans for mitigating risk of \ninfection.  (Doc. #43 at 46, ¶¶1-3.)  Petitioners make no effort to accommodate the significant \nand obvious public safety risks of releasing inmates into the community.  In particular, their \ndemand that certain class members be released “within twenty-four hours” is so cavalier as to be \ndangerous to the community at large. \nB.  The DOC has taken extraordinary steps to combat COVID-19 by \nimplementing CDC recommendations for incarcerated individuals.  \n \nThe DOC operates fourteen separate correctional facilities around the state, serving \ndifferent inmate populations and providing housing options that vary greatly from facility to \nfacility.  Each facility is assigned a security level score ranging from 2 to 5, with a level 2 facility \nhousing minimum security inmates and the level 5 facility designed to house maximum security \ninmates.3  These facilities, their inmate counts, and their respective housing accommodations \nappear in the following chart: \nINMATE  INMATE  NUMBER OF \nNUMBER OF \nFACILITY  COUNT AS OF  COUNT AS OF  DORMITORY \nCELL BEDS \n3/1/20  5/18/20  BEDS \nBrooklyn CI  426  355  0  456 \nCarl Robinson CI  1314  907  32 beds/16 cells  1480 \nCorrigan-\nRadgowski CC  1189  985  839  456 \nMacDougall-\nWalker CI  1938  1898  2218  0 \nNew Haven CC  679  636  419  328 \n \n3 As discussed infra, the DOC chose the level 5 facility, Northern Correctional Institution, to house inmates placed \nin medical isolation due to Covid-19 infection.  DOC made this decision for a number of reasons unrelated to the \nhigh security level of the facility.  (Declaration of Robert Richeson (Ex. A) at 1-2, ¶¶4-10; Declaration of Dr. Byron \nKennedy (Ex. B) at 2-3, ¶¶10, 12.) \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 4 of 42\n577 (564 minus \nRHU and infirmary \nNorthern CI  78  182  beds)  0 \nCheshire CI  1151  1125  1520  128 \nWillard-Cybulski \nCI  1079  613  0  1148 \n301 which includes \nrestrictive housing \n(22 beds).

This is especially true of Brooklyn, Carl Robinson, Willard-\nCybulski, Osborn and York, the facilities with significant population of inmates held in \ndormitory housing.  (Declaration of Warden Faucher (Ex. C) at 1-2, ¶¶5-6; Declaration of \nWarden Caron (Ex. D) at 1-2, ¶5; Declaration of Warden Garcia (Ex. E) at 2, ¶¶5-6; Declaration \nof Warden Rodriguez (Ex. F) at 1, ¶5; Declaration of Warden Dougherty (Ex. G) at 1-2, ¶¶4, 6.)  \nThese significant population decreases have allowed custody staff to quarantine new admits and \nseparate sick inmates from the remainder of the prison population while undergoing further \nevaluation for COVID-19.  (Ex. B at 3-4, ¶¶18, 20.) \nThe following chart shows the number of COVID-19 positive inmates, by facility: \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 5 of 42\nTotal  DOC  COVID -19  Positives/Recovered  by  Facility \nTotal  Offenders  Positive  526  Total  Offenders  Recovered  419 \nTotal  Offender  Deaths  6 \nlnn1ates  from  Facility  to  NCI  Tol:aJ  Inmates  Ret.....-ned  to  Facility  Total \nBridgeport  CC  62  Sridgepon  CC  59 \nBrooklyn  CJ  0  Brooklyn  Cl  12 \nCheshi.-e  Cl  17  Cheshire  Cl  10 \nCorrigan-Radgowskl  102  Cor,igan-Radgo w ski  74 \nGamer  Cl  0  Ga,nerCj  0 \nHartford  CC  35  Hartford  CC  31 \nMacDougall-Walker  3  M acDougall-Walker  5 \nManson  0  Manson  0 \nNew  Haven  CC  S2  New  t-tave-n  CC  47 \nNorthem  Cl  0  North ern  Cl  73 \nOsborn  Cl  123  Osborn  Cl  75 \nCarl  Rob in son  Cl  72  Carl  Robinson  Cl  5S \nWillard<ybu lsk i  60  Willard-Cybulski  53 \nYork  Cl  0  York  Cl  0 \nHospital  11 \nDischarged  15 \nParole  0 \n \nDOC’s three specialized facilities, York (females), MYI (21 and younger) and Garner \n(mental health) have had no reported inmate infections.  Moreover, while Northern Correctional \nInstitution (“NCI”) houses individuals who have tested positive for the COVID-19 virus and are \nunder quarantine or medical isolation, DOC officials have successfully managed their quarantine \nunits to prevent the spread to other inmates at NCI .   \nOn March 23, 2020 the Center for Disease Control (CDC) provided guidance to \ncorrectional and detention facilities.  (Ex. B at 7-33.)  In response, DOC cancelled social visits, \nquarantined new admissions, limited inmate transfers, cancelled volunteers, and limited \ncontractor access.  (Ex. B at 3-4, ¶18.)  All staff members have their temperatures checked prior \nto entry.  (Id.)  If any staff member has a temperature greater than 100.4 or exhibits any \nsymptoms, they are denied entry.  (Id. at 4, ¶19.)  If a staff member is exhibiting symptoms \nduring their shift, they are immediately isolated and sent home, a review of who they have come \ninto contact with is conducted, and those individuals are monitored for symptoms.  (Ex. B at 5, \n¶25.)  These areas are then cleaned and disinfected.  (Id.)  Soap and cleaning supplies are widely \ndistributed, common areas and frequently touched surfaces are cleaned and disinfected, and \nrecreation was modified to increase social distancing measures.  (Id. at 4, ¶20.)  Where feasible, \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 6 of 42\ninmates have been provided their meals in their cells to increase social distancing.  (Id.)  Inmates \nhave been provided hygiene education via posters and/or memos handed to them.  (Id. at 5, ¶26.)  \nDOC has created a COVID-19 Tracker and placed it online.4  The tracker is updated \ndaily.  As of May 15, 2020, there have been 598 total inmates who have contracted SARS-CoV-\n2 with 444 of them being medically cleared and returned to their original facility.  369 staff \nmembers have contracted the virus with 299 being medically cleared to return to work.  66 \ninmates are currently being medically isolated at NCI.   \nDOC implemented protocols for the quarantine of possible infections and the medical \nisolation of those testing positive or exhibiting symptoms.  (Ex. B at 4-5, ¶¶22-23.)  As of April \n7, 2020, NCI was designated as the medical isolation unit.  (Id. at 2, ¶10.)  NCI was chosen \nbecause it has single cells with individual bathroom facilities, solid walls and doors, and separate \nairflow from other parts of the facility, all in accordance with CDC Guidelines.  (Ex. A at 1-2, \n¶¶4-10; Ex. B at 2-3, ¶¶10, 12.)  Prior to returning any inmate who had COVID-19 from NCI to \ntheir original housing facility, they must be fever free for at least 72 hours, their symptoms must \nhave improved, and at least 14 days must have passed since the beginning of symptoms, which is \nlonger than what CDC suggests.  (Ex. B at 3, ¶15; see CDC Guidelines at 17.)   \nWardens across DOC have implemented measures to comply with the CDC guidelines.  \nFor example, Warden Butricks at Cheshire has increased the opportunities for social distancing \nby modifying outdoor recreation to 50 inmates at a time, not allowing certain sports such as \nbasketball due to the chance of contact between players, and cancelling congregate programming \nin lieu of individualized instruction.  (Declaration of Warden Butricks (Ex. H) at 2, ¶7.)  \nCheshire has placed posters around the facility educating inmates about proper hygiene practices.  \n \n4 https://portal.ct.gov/DOC/Common-Elements/Common-Elements/Health-Information-and-Advisories \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 7 of 42\n(Id. at 2, ¶8)  This information is reinforced by constant oral reminders by staff.  (Id.)  At \nBrooklyn CI, which has dorm style units, Warden Faucher has increased social distancing by \nallowing only one dorm at a time to go to outside recreation.  (Ex. C at 2, ¶6.)  Only five inmates \nmay attend addiction programming at one time and all of them must be from the same housing \nunit.  (Id.)  Sanitation has been ramped up, phones are cleaned daily, and cleaning supplies are \navailable for inmates to clean the phones between each use.  (Id. at 3, ¶11.)  At Corrigan-\nRadgowski, which has a mix of dorm style housing and cells, common areas are cleaned after \nevery group of inmates is released to use the showers with frequently touched areas such as \nrailings, doors, and handles cleaned constantly.  (Declaration of Warden Martin (Ex. I) at 3, ¶8.)  \nAnd inmates are provided supplies to clean the phones after each use.  (Id.)   \nC.  DOC, along with the State Judicial Branch and the Board of Pardons and \nParoles, has significantly reduced the inmate population in response to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. \n \nThe most recent monthly report of data collected by the Criminal Justice Policy and \nPlanning Division of the State of Connecticut Office of Policy and Management demonstrates \nthat the prison population has been reduced significantly.  As of April 1, 2020, the state prison \npopulation stood at 11,854, the lowest since 1993.5  Since Governor Lamont declared a state of \nemergency on March 10, 2020, the daily prison count has declined from 12,366 to 10,556, a total \nreduction of 1,810 or 14.6% in a period of just over 2 months.6 \nThis reduction stems from a number of factors.  First, arrests have declined and the courts \nare setting lower bonds.7  Second, there has recently been a significant increase of inmates \n \n5 See OPM Criminal Justice Policy & Planning Division, Monthly Indicators Report April 2020 at p. 1, \nhttps://portal.ct.gov/OPM/CJ-About/CJ-SAC/SAC-Sites/SAC-Homepage (last accessed on 5/17/20) \n6 See OPM, Daily Population Count, https://portal.ct.gov/OPM/CJ-About/CJ-SAC/SAC-Sites/SAC-Homepage (last \naccessed on 5/18/20) \n7 Id. \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 8 of 42\ndischarging from custody on discretionary release prior to completing their sentences.  In March, \n522 inmates were discharged from custody early—an increase of more than 70% from \nFebruary—which was the second highest month on record in terms of early releases.8  Of the 759 \ninmates released from DOC custody in March, 522, or 68%, left prison early under some form of \ndiscretionary release.9  The April 2020 OPM Monthly Indicators Report further demonstrates \nthat the Superior Courts remains open to handle criminal matters.  Specifically, the monthly \nreport shows that, during March 2020, 1,749 arraignments took place.10    \nD.  DOC has made concerted efforts to evaluate inmates eligible and suitable for \nearly release by utilizing a multi-factored, individualized, risk-assessment \nprocess, including consideration of likelihood of recidivism, the availability of \nan appropriate residence, and the safety and rights of victims. \n \nDOC’s current discretionary release process considers a number of factors which ensure \nthat offenders released early have a stable home plan and supervision if necessary, to reduce \nrecidivism and give offenders the best chance of success when released. (Declaration of Gavin \nGalligan (Ex. J) at 4-8, 14, ¶¶ 21-36, 65.)  This risk assessment process is critical because a \nstable release plan results in a lower risk of recidivism and is particularly important at this time, \nwhen many community social services are unavailable.  (Id. at 14-15, ¶¶65-66.)   \nIn response to COVID-19, DOC has taken extensive steps to increase discretionary \nreleases.  Specifically, DOC has expedited the application process by conducting sponsor \ninterviews remotely.  (Id. at 8, ¶ 36.)  DOC has identified inmates who were previously denied \nrelease for various reasons and assisted them in either completing facility programming, locating \na sponsor, or re-reviewing release plans.  (Id. at 9-10, ¶¶ 42-45.)  For example, DOC identified \ninmates who had previously been approved for release but were not due to lack of a stable home \n \n8 Id. at 1-2.  \n9 Id. at 2. \n10 Id. at 2. \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 9 of 42\nplan, and assisted them in locating a sponsor or residence, allowing approximately 20% of the \ncases without a sponsor to identify one.  (Id. at 10, ¶ 44.)  DOC also identified inmates who may \nnot have been eligible due to a restrictive status, disciplinary issues, or temporary ineligibility for \nreview, to be reviewed for release.  (Id. at 9, ¶ 41.)   \nDOC has also identified “high risk” inmates according to CDC Guidelines, reviewed all \nfor eligibility, and prioritized their applications for release.  (Id. at 9, ¶ 40.)  DOC has also been \nworking closely with the Board of Pardons and Paroles (BOPP) to identify these inmates and the \nmost appropriate release mechanism for them.  (Id.)  The Commissioner expanded furloughs for \noffenders for Transitional Supervision, which the Community Release Unit (CRU) has utilized to \nrelease an additional 119 offenders prior to their release date.  (Id. at 10, ¶ 46.)  These redoubled \nefforts have resulted in the discretionary release of nearly 1,500 inmates since March 1, 2020, \nwith 326 inmates scheduled for release in the next 60 days.  (Id. at 17, ¶¶ 84-85.) \nThe current discretionary release process also involves victims and evaluates victim \nimpact prior to making release decisions.  (Id. at 15, ¶¶71-72.)  There are currently 1,883 inmates \nage 50 and older.  (Id. at 16, ¶74.)  Within this group, 69 are serving life sentences for murder.  \n(Id. at 13, ¶60.)  As of April 2020, there are approximately 2,800 inmates with a Victim \nNotification flag, meaning that there is a registered victim who would require notification upon \napplication for community release.  (Declaration of Kristan Mangiafico (Ex. K) at 1, ¶4.)  Out of \nthe 1,883 offenders, the DOC has on file with its Victim Services Unit at least 515 confidential \nregistered victims.  (Ex. J at 16, ¶77.)   \nThe number of victims contacting VSU has greatly risen during the COVID-19 crisis.  \n(Id. at 16, ¶79.)  These victims have expressed great concern about whether the DOC was going \nto release their assailants without their opposition being heard.  (Id.)  The DOC’s Victim \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 10 of 42\nServices Administrator reports that victims have “begged” her not to release her rapist or the \nman who killed their father.”  (Ex. K at 2, ¶10.) \n  DOC is particularly concerned about the victims of domestic violence.  (Ex. J at 15, ¶71.)  \nThe Office of Policy Management Criminal Justice Policy & Planning Division reports that \n“between March and April, domestic related calls for service to the Hartford Police Department \nincreased by 23%, comprising almost one-quarter of all calls.”  (Id. at 16, ¶72.)   \n  Despite DOC’s significant efforts to properly evaluate and release those inmates who are \nmost suitable, there is concern that inmates who have been released are not abiding by the terms \nof that release, let alone recommended social distancing practices.  (Id. at 15, ¶68.)  \nApproximately 281 offenders have violated release terms since March 1, 2020.  (Id. at 15, ¶69.)  \nThese include technical violations, criminal offenses, escapes, and absconding from supervision.  \n(Id.)  Some of these offenders have been returned, while others remain at large.  (Id.) \nII.  ARGUMENT \n \nA.  Mandatory injunctive relief is an extreme and disfavored remedy, requiring \nlitigants to meet an especially heavy burden, particularly when sought \nagainst state government officials and even more so against prison officials. \n \n“Interim injunctive relief ‘is an extraordinary and drastic remedy, one that should not be \ngranted unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.’”  Reiske v. \nBruno, No. 13CV1089 JBA, 2014 WL 496686, at *1 (D.

May 6, 1988) (Harris v. \nWilters, 596 F.2d 678 (5th Cir.1979)).  “A mandatory injunction, like a mandamus, is an \nextraordinary remedial process, which is granted, not as a matter of right, but in the exercise of a \nsound judicial discretion.  It issues to remedy a wrong, not to promote one.”  Morrison v. Work, \n266 U.S. 481, 490 (1925). \nPetitioner’s recognize that they seek a mandatory injunction in that they concede their \nrequested relief would be “altering the status quo. . .”  (Doc. #43 at 25.)  However, Petitioners \nmisstate and minimize their burden by suggesting  they only “must show (1) irreparable harm in \nthe absence of immediate relief, (2) that relief is in the public interest, and (3) either a substantial \nlikelihood of success on the merits, or, that there are sufficiently serious questions on the merits \nrendering them fair for litigation and a balance of hardships decidedly pointing toward relief.”  \n(Id) (emphasis added).  This is incorrect.  See Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 690 (2008) (“A \ndifficult question is . . . of course, no reason to grant a preliminary injunction.”); Winter v. \nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 19 (2008) (vacating preliminary injunction \nentered on the basis of lower court finding “serious question” regarding interpretation of \nenvironmental regulations). \nTo support this novel test, Petitioners cite two cases:  Trump v. Vance, 941 F.3d 631, 639 \n(2d Cir. 2019) cert. granted, 140 S. Ct. 659 (2019) and N. Am. Soccer League, LLC, 883 F.3d at \n36–37.  But Trump is a case where “the President sought injunctive relief in federal court to \nrestrain enforcement of [a] subpoena [seeking his personal tax returns].”  941 F.3d at 634.  The \ninjunction would not have changed the status quo and the Court did not treat it as such.  In N. \nAm. Soccer League, the plaintiff sought a preliminary injunction ordering the defendant to \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 14 of 42\ndesignate it as the “Division II league” of men’s professional soccer.  883 F.3d at 34.  That case \nturned entirely on whether to apply the “heightened standard” of “a clear or substantial \nlikelihood of success on the merits.”  Id. at 37.  The Court held the heightened standard did apply \nbecause the plaintiff was seeking to alter the status quo and affirmed the district court’s denial \nbecause they had not shown a “clear likelihood of success on the merits.”  Id. at 45. \nThere is no support for Petitioner’s formulation of the standard here.  This Court cannot \noverrule the Second Circuit and adopt Petitioner’s test.  Petitioners cannot meet their heavy \nburden here and their efforts to manipulate the law to avoid it should be rejected by this Court.  \nB.  Petitioners cannot meet their burden because their alleged harm is \nspeculative, their likelihood of success is minute, and the public interest is not \nserved by recklessly releasing inmates with no plan or mechanism for their \ncare, housing, monitoring, or return to confinement.  \n \n1.  Petitioners cannot show irreparable harm because they merely \nspeculate that their likelihood of contracting SARS-CoV-2 is higher \nwhile confined than in the community and the mortality rate based on \nthe best available data is magnitudes lower than in the community. \n \n“Although a showing that irreparable injury will be suffered before a decision on the \nmerits may be reached is insufficient by itself to require the granting of a preliminary injunction, \nit is nevertheless the most significant condition that must be demonstrated.”  Cerilli, 2010 WL \n1330998, at *1 (quoting Citibank, N.A. v. Citytrust, 756 F.2d 273, 275 (2d Cir.1985)).  “To \ndemonstrate irreparable harm, plaintiff must show an ‘injury that is neither remote nor \nspeculative, but actual and imminent and that cannot be remedied by an award of monetary \ndamages.’”  Id. (quoting Forest City Daly Hous., Inc. v. Town of N. Hempstead, 175 F.3d 144, \n153 (2d Cir. 1999)).  District courts across the country have held that fear of COVID-19 is not \nenough to warrant the release of prisoners.11     \n \n11 See e.g. Riggs v. Louisiana, No. CV 3:20-0495, 2020 WL 1939168, at *2 (W.D.

Respondents \nhave never taken the position, and do not now, that the pandemic is anything less than a \nsignificant medical crisis.  However, Petitioners assume that inmates are inherently at greater \nrisk of both infection and worse health consequences as a result of infection than the community \nat large.  (Doc. #43 at 10.)  This is a speculative conclusion.   \nIt cannot be gainsaid that COVID-19 is a novel health crisis and the facts of this \npandemic, including infection and mortality rates, are constantly fluctuating.

(CDC notes that data on “excess dates” \nrelated to COVID-19 are “incomplete,” “should be treated with caution,” and that “Connecticut” has “historically \nlow levels of completeness.”). \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 16 of 42\namong the non-inmate population of Connecticut, particularly where Petitioners themselves \nallege “that around 60% of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic.”  (Doc. #1 at 23, ¶55.)  Indeed, \nPetitioners’ own recently disclosed expert Dr. Goldenson estimates that “80% of [COVID-19] \ncases are selflimited and generally mild” and points out that “95% of those who tested positive \n[at an Ohio prison] were asymptomatic and would otherwise not have been tested.”  (Declaration \nof Dr. Goldenson (Ex. L) at 1, 7; ¶¶7, 32.)   \nThus, Petitioners cannot simply posit that releasing inmates into the community makes \nthem less likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, especially here where Petitioners make no allowances \nfor where or how Petitioners will live when they are released.  Providing inmates—some of \nwhom have been serving life sentences—a piece of paper instructing them “that they should self-\nisolate” for 14 days (Doc. #43 at 46, ¶6) would be comically naïve if it were not so dangerous.  \nAs James Madison presciently observed, “if men were angels, no government would be \nnecessary.”  Federalist No. 51, p. 349.  But people, including and especially Petitioners, are not \nangels and their proposed injunction will most likely increase, rather than decrease, the risk to \nboth them and the public at large.  (Ex. J at 15-16, ¶¶67-73.)  They cannot show irreparable harm \nbased on such speculation and unavoidably murky facts and they certainly cannot meet their \nheavy burden in the context of a mandatory injunction.   \nEven if all of the numbers here were as accurate as a study conducted after this crisis had \npassed, there are still insufficient facts to show that the DOC is unable to properly manage the \ncurrent health crisis.  Per the US Census, Connecticut has approximately 3,565,000 residents.13  \nAs of May 15, 2020, Connecticut has 37,419 people who have tested positive for the COVID-19 \n \n13 https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/CT \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 17 of 42\nvirus, with 3,408 COVID-19 associated deaths.14  That translates to a 1% positive infection rate \nwith a mortality rate of 9.1% of those infected.   \nAs of May 15, 2020, the total population of DOC facilities stands at 10,55615, with 598 \ntotal inmates testing positive for the COVID-19 virus with 6 COVID-19 related deaths.16  That \ntranslates to a 5.6% infection rate, but just a 1% mortality rate.  So comparing the DOC to the \ngeneral community, while there is a greater infection rate, there is a significantly lower mortality \nrate.  Additionally, 444 inmates who had COVID-19 and were thus quarantined at NCI, have \nbeen medically cleared in accordance with CDC guidelines and returned to their original \nfacilities.17  That is a recovery rate of 74% and the numbers of inmates who have recovered is \nincreasing significantly by the day, as evidenced by the dramatic drop of inmates housed at NCI, \nwhich currently stands at 66.   \nBased on the available data, a DOC inmate who does unfortunately contract SARS-CoV-\n2, has a 99% chance of survival and the vast majority of inmates have already recovered \npursuant to CDC guidelines.  Given these circumstances, Petitioners cannot show a substantial \nrisk of serious harm in the form of death or serious illness.  Put simply, if one has a 1% risk of \ndeath, one cannot argue he faces a “substantial” risk, particularly when juxtaposed against the \n9.1% mortality rate in the general community where he seeks to be released.  Nor can one argue \nthat he faces a “substantial” risk of serious illness, where inmates are making full recoveries—as \ndetermined by following CDC guidelines—at a rapid pace.   \nRespondents are not minimizing this crisis.  Even Petitioners’ designated expert avers \nthat this virus has a “mild” impact on the vast majority of those infected and Petitioners \n \n14 https://portal.ct.gov/coronavirus \n15 https://cjis-dashboard.ct.gov/CJPPD_Reports/rdPage.aspx?rdReport=Extracted_Data \n16 https://portal.ct.gov/DOC/Common-Elements/Common-Elements/Health-Information-and-Advisories \n17 https://portal.ct.gov/DOC/Common-Elements/Common-Elements/Health-Information-and-Advisories.  \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 18 of 42\nthemselves allege that 60% of these cases are asymptomatic.  (Ex. L at 1, ¶7; Doc. #1 at 23, ¶55.)  \nThe harm itself must be “serious” and the risk “substantial.”  Based on the available data, it is at \nleast arguable that neither is true.  And since it is arguable, it cannot be said that Petitioners’ have \nmet their heavy burden to show irreparable harm, a burden that applies to all factors of the \nmandatory injunction test.  Bergamaschi, 2020 WL 1910754, at *6 (required to “carry the burden \nof persuasion by a clear showing for each factor.”).  \n2.  Petitioners cannot show that they are far more likely to succeed than \nnot. \n \nPetitioners “must show ‘a clear and substantial likelihood of success on the merits.’”   \nBergamaschi, 2020 WL 1910754, at *5 (quoting N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit \nAuth., 684 F.3d 286, 294 (2d Cir. 2012)).  “This requires proof ‘that their cause is considerably \nmore likely to succeed than fail.’”  Id. (quoting Abdul Wall v. Coughlin, 754 F.3d 1015, 1026 (2d \nCir. 1985), overruled on other grounds, O’Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342 (1987)); see \nalso Eng v. Smith, 849 F.2d 80, 81 (2d Cir.1988).  “It is not enough for a plaintiff seeking a \nmandatory injunction to demonstrate just a ‘likelihood of success on the merits;’ and it is \ncertainly not a enough for him to demonstrate the existence of a ‘serious questions on the merits \nand a balance of hardships decidedly favoring the moving party,’ which has traditionally been an \nalternative to a likelihood of success on the merits in this Circuit.”  Id. (citing N. Am. Soccer \nLeague, LLC, 883 F.3d at 37). \n“When courts refer to ‘a probability of success,’ they are presumably using the word \n‘probability’ (or its cognate ‘probable’) in the sense of a substantial degree of likelihood, rather \nthan in the sense of some ratio of the likelihood of a particular outcome to a number of possible \noutcomes.”  Mohammed v. Reno, 309 F.3d 95, 101 (2d Cir. 2002).  A party seeking a prohibitory \ninjunction “need only make a showing that the probability of his prevailing is better than fifty \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 19 of 42\npercent.”  Eng, 849 F.2d at 82 (quoting Abdul Wall, 754 F.3d at 1025).  Therefore, in practical \nterms, Petitioners must meet a burden greater than a mere preponderance of the evidence.  See C \nTennant, Sons & Co of New York v. Dill, 158 F. Supp. 63, 69 (S.D.N.Y. 1957) (noting that the \nplaintiff had failed to meet the “clear and convincing” standard “which would seem to be \nnecessary to warrant a grant of a mandatory injunction”); see also Bristol Tech., Inc. v. Microsoft \nCorp., 42 F. Supp. 2d 153, 175 (D. Conn. 1998) (Judge Hall denying mandatory injunction \nbecause “[a]lthough the record currently supports the conclusion that [the plaintiff] is more likely \nthan not to succeed . . . it cannot be said that a clear showing has been made. . .”). \nPetitioners are not merely seeking a preliminary injunction.  They are not even just \nseeking a mandatory injunction.  Petitioners are seeking a mandatory injunction compelling state \nprison officials, to not only correct supposedly deficient conditions of confinement, but to \nrelease potentially thousands of inmates, including six dozen murderers.  Petitioners are asking \nthis Court to ignore federalism, separation of powers, the Prison Litigation Reform Act, Second \nCircuit and Supreme Court precedent, the rights of crime victims under the Connecticut \nConstitution, common sense, and the safety of Connecticut’s law-abiding citizens, to do \nsomething that no court has ever done in American history: order the Governor to release \nnumerous inmates with no plan for monitoring, housing or return, prior to trial, and despite the \nfact that they have not even attempted to exhaust their state court or administrative remedies, and \ndespite the fact that there has been no violation of any interim court order to address \nunconstitutional conditions.  It is no exaggeration to submit that Petitioners face the highest \npossible burden a litigant could face when requesting preliminary injunctive relief.  They cannot \nmeet this properly onerous burden. \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 20 of 42\na.  Petitioners cannot meet the deliberate indifference standard. \n \ni.  Petitioners do not describe in what way Respondents \nare failing to “provide appropriate medical care.” \n \n“To state a claim for deliberate indifference to safety or failure to protect him from harm, \n[an inmate] must show that the conditions of his confinement posed a substantial risk of serious \nharm and that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his safety.”   Llewellyn v.

Taylor, \n698 F. Supp. 2d 351, 357 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (explaining that defendants must be aware of facts \nsupporting an inference that the harm would occur and must actually draw that inference).

Feb. 5, 2018), aff’d, 794 F. \nApp’x 8, 11 (2d Cir. 2019) (citing Salahuddin, 467 F.3d at 280).  “For cases involving a claimed \ndelay in treatment, ‘the seriousness inquiry is narrower’ . . .”  Id.  (quoting Salahuddin, 467 F.3d \nat 280).  Thus, to determine whether any delay in receiving appropriate treatment was an \nunreasonable delay, the court must evaluate whether the delay exacerbated the injury or \ncondition.  Washington v. Artus, 708 F. App’x 705, 709 (2d Cir. 2017) (citing Smith, 316 F.3d at \n185).  “In considering whether a delay caused a risk of harm, a court may consider the absence of \nadverse medical effects or demonstrable physical injury.”  Valdiviezo v. Boyer, 752 F. App’x 29, \n32 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nCourts have found that a plaintiff’s allegations fail to meet the objective prong where the \nalleged “delay in providing medical attention is neither the underlying cause of a plaintiff’s \ncondition nor contributed to a worsening in the condition. . .”  Cuffee v.

Setting aside whether an allegation of providing “inappropriate” medical care even \nstates a deliberate indifference claim, Petitioners make no allegations about any inmates who \nsought specific care and were denied or provided alternative care.  (Doc. #43 at 15-18.)  \nPetitioners instead allege that there is an “utter lack of medical staffing at DOC facilities.”  (Id. at \n17.)  But Petitioners make no argument as to how the supposed lack of staffing has actually \nimpacted any of them and the numbers they rely on for their contentions of inadequate staffing \nare all based on unsworn hearsay.18   \n \n18 Litigants are permitted to submit hearsay in preliminary injunction motions.  See Mullins v. City of New York, 626 \nF.3d 47, 52 (2d Cir. 2010) (“The admissibility of hearsay under the Federal Rules of Evidence goes to weight, not \npreclusion, at the preliminary injunction stage.”).  However, in the preliminary injunction context, “there is a \npreference for live testimony regarding disputed issues of fact.”  Flores v. Town of Islip, No. 218CV3549ADSGRB, \n2019 WL 1515291, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 8, 2019).  Petitioners make liberal use of unsworn and unverified \nnewspaper articles throughout their papers.  “It is well-established that ‘newspaper articles offered for the truth of \nthe matters asserted therein are inadmissible hearsay. . .’”  Outerbridge v. City of New York, No. 13 CIV. 5459 \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 23 of 42\nThe closest Petitioners come are allegations of delay: “[p]eople are kept in their \ncongregate housing units for days or even weeks after reporting COVID-19 symptoms and \nrequesting medical care. Some are refused medical care altogether. The first prisoner to die from \nCOVID-19 in custody had reportedly had a fever of 101 degrees and been begging to be seen \nbefore he finally was transferred to a hospital.”  (Doc. #43 at 22-23.)  But to support these \nallegations, Petitioners rely on hearsay.   \nFor example, the support for the allegation that “some are refused medical care \naltogether” comes from the affidavit of Marcus Champagne.  But he simply says “I’ve seen 3 or \n4 people sick with coronavirus symptoms, and only 2 have gone to medical. One of those people \nhad been asking repeatedly for the entire day. Both of the people who have been to medical \ndidn’t come back to the dorm.”  (Doc. #43-7 at 3, ¶10.)  He does not name these inmates or the \nDOC officials they spoke with, what kind of symptoms they had, whether the “3 or 4” all had \neven asked to go to medical, whether they submitted a grievance or written request, and what \nkind of treatment they received once these phantom people were seen by medical.  This \nillustrates the problem with relying on this kind of hearsay when trying to meet the heavy burden \nof a mandatory injunction.   \nPetitioners can submit hearsay, but this Court is not required to accept it without \nquestion.  Indeed, even properly sworn affidavits are insufficient to settle a disputed issue of fact.  \nSee Davis v. N.Y.C. Hous. Auth., 166 F.3d 432, 437-48 (2d Cir. 1999) (“We note for purposes of \nremand that while affidavits may be considered on a preliminary injunction motion, motions for \npreliminary injunction should not be resolved on the basis of affidavits that evince disputed \n \n(AT/DCF), 2015 WL 5813387, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2015) (quoting Odom v. Matteo, 772 F.Supp.2d 377, 404 \n(D. Conn. 2011))  Given this fact, Respondents submit that Petitioners’ overreliance on inadmissible media reports, \noften containing hearsay within hearsay, be discounted or “be afforded little or no weight.”  Flores, 2019 WL \n1515291, at *3. \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 24 of 42\nissues of fact.  When a factual issue is disputed, oral testimony is preferable to affidavits.”) \n(citation omitted).  Petitioners cannot make vague allegations based on unverifiable and \nunconfronted claims to satisfy their heavy burden for a preliminary injunction.  Based on their \nsubmissions, there is no likelihood of success on the merits, let alone a substantial one. \nCOVID-19 likely is a “serious medical condition” to the 20% of people Petitioners allege \n“will have more severe disease requiring medical intervention and support.”  (Ex. L at 1, ¶7.)  \nBut as to the remaining 80% of cases that Petitioners assert are “mild,” this cannot be a serious \nmedical condition.  See Salaam v. Adams, No. 03-cv-517, 2006 WL 2827687, at *10 (N.D.N.Y. \nSept. 29, 2006) (medical condition was not serious where, among other things, the plaintiff’s \ncomplaints “to medical staff were sporadic and moderate or mild in nature (i.e., not characterized \nby [the p]laintiff as ‘severe,’ ‘extreme,’ ‘agonizing,’ ‘excruciating,’ etc.)”). \nPetitioners also cannot meet their burden to demonstrate deliberate indifference to \nmedical needs simply by saying a condition generally exists in DOC facilities.  If they are \nclaiming a lack of treatment, they must explain how, why, and to whom that has happened.  If \nthey are claiming delay in treatment, Petitioners must explain the length of the delay and what, if \nany, negative health consequences resulted therefrom.  Petitioners have the burden here and it is \nnot incumbent on Respondents to prove that they are providing “appropriate” medical care, \nespecially where Petitioners offer only vague allegations to the contrary. \nii.  Petitioners cannot demonstrate that Respondents have \nthe requisite mental state for deliberate indifference \nunder either the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments. \n \n“To satisfy the subjective prong of the deliberate indifference standard, ‘the official must \nhave acted with the requisite state of mind, the equivalent of criminal recklessness.’”  James v. \nSuffolk Cty. Corr. Facility, No. 13CV2344JFBSIL, 2018 WL 3966688, at *12 (E.D.N.Y. June \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 25 of 42\n26, 2018), report and recommendation adopted, No. 13CV2344JFBSIL, 2018 WL 3966241 \n(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 17, 2018) (quoting Collazo v. Pagano, 656 F.3d 131, 135 (2d Cir. 2011)).  Thus, \nan allegation of “mere negligen[t]” conduct is insufficient.  See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 835.   \n“In the case of pretrial detainees, ‘the subjective prong (or mens rea prong) ... is defined \nobjectively.’”  Harris v. Viau, No. 17-CV-9746 (KMK), 2019 WL 1331632, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. \nMar. 25, 2019) (quoting Darnell v. Pineiro, 849 F.3d 17, 35 (2d Cir. 2017)).  “After Darnell, \npretrial detainees asserting conditions of confinement claims under the Fourteenth Amendment \nmust allege ‘that the defendant-official acted intentionally to impose the alleged condition, or \nrecklessly failed to act with reasonable care to mitigate the risk that the condition posed to the \npretrial detainee even though the defendant-official knew, or should have known, that the \ncondition posed an excessive risk to health or safety.’”  Id.  (quoting Darnell, 849 F.3d at 35).  \nDespite the application of an objective standard, deliberate indifference still requires more than \nmere negligence.  See Charles v. Orange Cty., 925 F.3d 73, 87 (2d Cir. 2019) (holding that \n“something more than mere negligence” or “mere medical malpractice,” is necessary to establish \ndeliberate indifference in the Fourteenth Amendment context). \n“Because mere negligence will not support a Section 1983 claim, not all lapses in prison \nmedical care constitute a constitutional violation.”  Reddick v. Lantz, 2010 WL 1286992, at *4–5 \n(quoting Smith v. Carpenter, 316 F.3d 178, 184 (2d Cir.2003)).  “In addition, inmates are not \nentitled to the medical treatment of their choice.”  Id. (citing Dean v. Coughlin, 804 F.2d 207, \n215 (2d Cir.1986)).  “Mere disagreement with prison officials about what constitutes appropriate \ncare does not state a claim cognizable under the Eighth Amendment.”  Id.  “So long as the \ntreatment given is adequate, the fact that a prisoner might prefer a different treatment does not \ngive rise to an Eighth Amendment violation.”  Id. (quoting Chance v. Armstrong, 143 F.3d 698, \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 26 of 42\n703 (2d Cir.1998)).  “The conduct complained of must ‘shock the conscience’ or constitute a \n‘barbarous act.’”  Id. (quoting Hathaway v. Coughlin, 99 F.3d 550, 553 (2d Cir.1996)). \n“Medical judgment usually is not sufficient to support an Eighth Amendment violation.”  \nId. (citing Hernandez v. Keane, 341 F.3d 137, 146–47 (2d Cir.2003) (deliberate indifference \nclaim rejected where relying on delay in providing risky treatment), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1093 \n(2005); see also Revels v. Corr. Med. Care, Inc., 2018 WL 1578157, at *4 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, \n2018) (“A mere disagreement with a prescribed course of treatment is not sufficient to establish a \nviolation of the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment.”).  “The judgment of prison doctors is \npresumed valid unless the prisoner provides evidence that the decision was ‘such a substantial \ndeparture from accepted professional judgment, practice or standards as to demonstrate that the \nperson responsible actually did not base the decision on such judgment.’”  Reddick, 2010 WL \n1286992, at *4–5 (quoting White v. Napoleon, 897 F.2d 103, 113 (3d Cir.1990)).   \n“In addition, physicians can and do differ in their diagnoses and their determinations of \nthe appropriate treatment for a particular patient.  That difference of opinion does not establish a \nclaim of deliberate indifference.”  Id. (citing Estelle, 429 U.S. at 107 (holding that questions of \ndiagnosis and treatment implicating medical judgment are at most medical malpractice, not \ndeliberate indifference to serious medical needs)).  “Thus, the mere fact that treating physicians \nconsidered two possible diagnoses does not establish deliberate indifference to serious medical \nneeds.”  Id.; see also Brown v. Beard, 445 F. App’x 453, 455 (3d Cir. 2011) (“A professional \ndisagreement between doctors as to the best course of treatment does not establish an Eighth \nAmendment violation.”).  “A difference of opinion between a prisoner and prison officials \nregarding medical treatment does not, as a matter of law, constitute deliberate indifference.” \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 27 of 42\nReddick, 2010 WL 1286992, at *4–5 (citing Chance, 143 F.3d at 703 (“It is well-established that \nmere disagreement over the proper treatment does not create a constitutional claim.”)). \nPetitioners fail the subjective prong.  Petitioners acknowledge that Respondents have \nbeen taking steps to combat COVID-19, but they simply characterize these steps as “inadequate” \nor “insufficient.” (Doc. #43 at 1, 9, 12, 22.)  Allegations of inadequate treatment sound in \nnegligence and are therefore insufficient to state a deliberate indifference claim, whether under \nthe Fourteenth or Eighth Amendments.  See Pettus v. Lemmott-Taylor, 219 F. App’x 81, 82 (2d \nCir. 2007) (State prisoner’s allegations that medical personnel rendered inadequate medical care, \nat most, claimed mere negligence, which was insufficient to state a claim of deliberate \nindifference). \nAs has been the case since this litigation began in the state court, Petitioners’ issue with \nRespondents is not that they have taken no actions or that they have ignored this pandemic.  It is \nthat Respondents have not taken the actions Petitioners prefer, namely mass release of inmates.  \nBut allegations that Respondents have not done enough to combat COVID-19 is insufficient to \nsatisfy the subjective prong of the deliberate indifference test, under either the Eighth or \nFourteenth Amendments.   \nThe CDC Guidelines do not anticipate or recommend the release of any number of \ninmates from prison as a method of addressing COVID-19.  (Ex. B, CDC Guidelines.)  Indeed, \nthe only mentions of releasing any inmates in the Guidelines have to do with the limitations \nprison officials should place on inmates leaving prisons.  (See Id. at 12 (“Consider suspending \nwork release programs and other programs that involve movement of incarcerated/detained \nindividuals in and out of the facility”), Id. at 14 (“Screen all releasing individuals for COVID-19 \nsymptoms and perform a temperature check . . . If an individual does not clear the screening \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 28 of 42\nprocess, follow the protocol for a suspected COVID-19 case-including putting a face mask on \nthe individual, immediately placing them under medical isolation, and evaluating them for \npossible COVID-19 testing), Id. at 17 (“If an incarcerated/detained individual who is a COVID-\n19 case is released from custody during their medical isolation period, contact public health to \narrange for safe transport and continuation of necessary medical care and medical isolation as \npart of release planning.”)  Petitioners do not simply disagree with DOC’s plan.  They disagree \nwith the CDC as well.  Either way, this is not enough to prove deliberate indifference. \nThe best example of this mere disagreement is Petitioners’ complaints about NCI.  (Doc. \n#43 at 18-21.)  Petitioners must acknowledge that Respondents have been using NCI for medical \nisolation cases.  However, Petitioners object to the use of NCI as a medical isolation site, mainly \nbecause they contend that its “inherently punitive nature” make inmates less likely to report their \nsymptoms.  (Id. at 21.)  There are naturally significant factual disputes between the parties as to \nthe conditions at NCI, disputes that can only be settled at a hearing.  But these disputes \nultimately do not matter because at best Petitioners submit opinions from their experts \ndisagreeing with the use of NCI as a medical isolation facility.   \nRespondents did not choose NCI on a whim or in an effort to “punish” people for \ncontracting SARS-CoV-2.  They did so based on the considered advice of medical professionals, \nconsidering such factors as space, ventilation, availability of medical staff, and most importantly, \nthe guidance of the CDC for managing incarcerated individuals.  (Ex. A at 1-2, ¶¶4-10; Ex. B at \n2-3, ¶¶10, 12.)  Per the CDC Guidelines, facilities should place suspected confirmed cases under \nmedical isolation individually.  (Ex. A at 2, ¶5; CDC Guidelines at 15.)  The Guidelines also \nsuggest single cells should have solid walls and doors and a private bathroom.  (Id.; CDC \nGuidelines at 16.)  NCI also has a ventilation system which helps minimize the risk of airborne \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 29 of 42\nspread of the virus.  (Id. at 2, ¶7; Ex. B at 2-3, ¶12.)  NCI is the best fit to accomplish all goals \nfor medical isolation during this pandemic.  Respondents made their choices based on the \nguidance of their medical experts, upon whom they are entitled to rely.  See Terbush v. Mitchell, \nNo. 3:15CV01339(SALM), 2017 WL 663198, at *6 (D. Conn. Feb. 17, 2017) (holding that a \nsupervisory official is “generally entitled to delegate medical responsibility to medical staffs and \n[is] entitled to rely on the opinion of medical staff concerning the proper course of treatment.”); \nsee also Graham v. Wright, No. 01-CV-9613, 2003 WL 22126764, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 12, \n2003) (“supervisory officials are generally entitled to delegate medical responsibility to facility \nmedical staffs and are entitled to rely on the opinion of medical staff concerning the proper \ncourse of treatment.”). \nTherefore, Petitioners’ complaints at best boil down to a dispute between doctors as to \nthe best way to manage this entirely novel and dynamic crisis.  Petitioners and their experts \ndisagree with the conclusions of Dr. Kennedy, Robert Richeson and the Respondents, and \ncontend that the efforts of DOC have been “insufficient,” while at the same time ignoring the \nimpressive recovery and mortality rates of COVID-19 within DOC.  They are entitled to this \ndisagreement, but Petitioners are not entitled to the extraordinary relief of a mandatory injunction \nbased on this disagreement.  See Gumns et. al. v. Edwards, et. al., No. 20-231-SDD-RLB, 2020 \nWL 2510248, at *15 (M.D. La. May 15, 2020) (denying inmates’ request for TRO prohibiting \ntheir transfer from jails to a state prison, holding “the existence of an alternative plan–even a \nbetter plan–is not evidence that the challenged plan is unconstitutional or illustrative of \ndeliberate indifference.”). \nPrison officials, particularly medical personnel, are given breathing room and discretion \nunder ordinary circumstances.  See Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 321 (1972) (stating that prison \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 30 of 42\nofficials must be afforded latitude in administering prison affairs); Vega v. Lantz, No. \n3:04CV1215(DFM), 2005 WL 8166179, at *1 (D. Conn. July 27, 2005); Gonzalez v. Narcato, \n363 F. Supp. 2d 486, 493 (E.D.N.Y. 2005) (“it is not the job of the federal courts to engage in \ndetailed supervision of the prisons”).  It would be a distortion of this well-held principle to rob \nprison officials of their due deference in the midst of a crisis, where the medical facts and \nevidence are changing daily, and there is no settled knowledge regarding this disease, its spread, \nor its treatment. \nIt is also important to keep in mind the nature of the relief sought.  Petitioners are seeking \nrelease of inmates.  However, there is nothing in the CDC Guidelines for incarcerated individuals \nthat anticipates the mass release of inmates as a method of combating COVID-19.  On the \ncontrary, the Guidelines make it clear that they are flexible and recognize the need for prisons \nand the need to incarcerate individuals, even in the midst of COVID-19.  Furthermore, even if \nPetitioners could demonstrate that Respondents are somehow failing to meet the CDC Guidelines \nby refusing to simply fling open the prison doors, they cannot demonstrate how mere failure to \nmeet professional guidelines, despite best efforts, could constitute anything other than \nnegligence.  The mere fact that the CDC Guidelines do not anticipate, nor recommend releasing \ninmates proves that the Respondent’s refusal to do so cannot be “‘such a substantial departure \nfrom accepted professional judgment, practice or standards as to demonstrate that the person \nresponsible actually did not base the decision on such judgment.’”  Reddick, 2010 WL 1286992, \nat *4–5 (quoting White v. Napoleon, 897 F.2d 103, 113 (3d Cir.1990)).   \nAs the Fifth Circuit recently observed in an almost identical context, it is error to treat \n“inadequate measures as dispositive of the Defendants’ mental state.”   Valentine v. Collier, 956 \nF.3d 797, 802–03 (5th Cir. 2020).  “Such an approach resembles the standard for civil \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 31 of 42\nnegligence, which Farmer explicitly rejected.”  Id.  “Though the district court cited the \nDefendants’ general awareness of the dangers posed by COVID-19, it cited no evidence that they \nsubjectively believe the measures they are taking are inadequate. To the contrary, the evidence \nshows that TDCJ has taken and continues to take measures—informed by guidance from the \nCDC and medical professionals—to abate and control the spread of the virus.”  Id.  So too here. \nPetitioners may disagree with Respondents. They may object to Respondents’ policy \ndecision made based on medical advice, a balancing of risks, and due consideration for the safety \nof all of Connecticut’s people.  They are free to do so in a republic.  But they cannot invoke the \nfederal courts to force Respondents to reverse their policy decisions, especially when the best \nthey can do is demonstrate a disagreement amongst doctors as to the proper course of action. \nb.  Petitioners cannot show a substantial likelihood of success on \ntheir Substantive Due Process claim, because there is clearly no \nintent to punish and the presence of COVID-19 does not \nrender confinement in and of itself as “excessive.” \n \n“[S]ubstantive due process is violated if the pretrial conditions are punitive.”  Caves v. \nPayne, No. 3:20-CV-15 (KAD), 2020 WL 1676916, at *6 (D. Conn. Apr. 6, 2020) (quoting Bell \nv. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 (1979)).  “In considering such a claim, the ‘court must decide \nwhether the [condition] is imposed for the purpose of punishment or whether it is but an incident \nof some other legitimate governmental purpose.’”  Id. (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 538).  Absent \nevidence of an “expressed intent to punish on the part of detention facility officials, that \ndetermination generally will turn on ‘whether an alternative purpose to which the restriction may \nrationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the \nalternative purpose assigned to it.’”  Id. (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 538).  “[I]f a restriction or \ncondition is not reasonably related to a legitimate goal—if it is arbitrary or purposeless—a court \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 32 of 42\npermissibly may infer that the purpose of the governmental action is punishment that may not \nconstitutionally be inflicted upon detainees qua detainees.”  Id. (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 539).  \n“Conversely, ‘if a particular condition or restriction of pretrial detention is reasonably \nrelated to a legitimate governmental objective, it does not, without more, amount to \n‘punishment.’”  Id. (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 539).  “Legitimate government objectives include \n‘maintain[ing] security and order at the institution and mak[ing] certain no weapons or illicit \ndrugs reach detainees,’ ‘ensuring the detainees’ presence at trial,’ and managing the facility \nwhere the detainee is held.”   Id. (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 539).  It is well-held that “public \nsafety” is a legitimate government objective.  See, e.g., Marcavage v. City of N.Y., 689 F.3d 98, \n104 (2d Cir. 2012) (recognizing City’s “significant interest in keeping its public spaces safe”); \nUnited for Peace and Justice v. City of N.Y., 243 F.Supp.2d 19, 29 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (describing \nthe “significant government interest of public safety”).  In the current context, ensuring the \nhealthcare infrastructure of Connecticut not be overwhelmed, preventing a second wave of \ninfections, preventing recidivism, and protecting the rights of victims in accordance with the \nConnecticut Constitution are all “legitimate governmental objectives” as well. \nPetitioners give lip service to this argument, essentially repeating their points about \ndeliberate indifference.  (Doc. #43 at 32.)  The only law they cite to support this is from District \nCourt decisions dealing with civil immigration detainees.  But all of these cases are inapposite \nfor the same reason Petitioners’ argument ultimately fails.  They do not involve people accused \nof crimes and who have consequently been ordered incarcerated on bond, and therefore do not \nconsider the public safety risk associated with releasing numerous criminal detainees en masse.   \nPetitioners also make no mention of how any of the detainees they seek to release will be \nmonitored, whether they have housing, whether they have access to medical care, and whether \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 33 of 42\nthey would ever return to confinement.  Thus, Petitioners do not grapple with the very real risk \nthat releasing people that they specifically allege may be asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 \nmight not abide by the “instructions” to self-quarantine.  They do not consider that these inmates \nmay not have the ability to self-quarantine.  Perhaps they have no place to live or perhaps the \nonly place they can go would require them to live with many other people.  Petitioners’ facile \nplan demonstrates the many legitimate government interests in keeping detainees confined, while \neither reconsidering their status on a case-by-case basis, or allowing the state courts to do the \nsame, as they have been since the beginning of this crisis.  Indeed, Petitioner Void-Williams had \na hearing for a bond reduction and was denied 2 weeks before bringing this case.  (Transcript of \nApr. 3, 2020 bond reduction hearing in State v. Williams-Void (Ex. M.); Void-Williams’ Motion \nfor Bond Reduction dtd Mar. 24, 2020 (Ex. N.))  Petitioner McPherson also had such a hearing \nand was actually released. \nFinally, Petitioners do not consider that the Connecticut Constitution has robust \nprotections for victims and therefore Respondents have a legitimate interest in upholding those \nlaws.  This will be discussed in further detail infra.  There is no good faith argument that refusing \nto massively release thousands of inmates in an effort to ensure public safety is “arbitrary or \npurposeless.”  Petitioners cannot meet their heavy burden on their Substantive Due Process claim \nand the injunction should therefore not issue. \nc.  The PLRA bars this Court from ordering the relief sought by \nPetitioners. \n \n“Running a prison is an inordinately difficult undertaking that requires expertise, \nplanning, and the commitment of resources, all of which are peculiarly within the province of the \nlegislative and executive branches of government.”  Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 84-85 (1987). \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 34 of 42\nFederal courts may order prospective relief “in any civil action with respect to prison \nconditions,” provided the relief “extend[s] no further than necessary to correct the violation of \nthe Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A).  Should this \ncourt deem such relief necessary it must be narrowly tailored or proportional to the scope of the \nviolation and extending no further than necessary to remedy the violation. Brown v. Plata, 563 \nU.S. 493, 530 (2011). A court should not issue “remedial orders that unnecessarily reach out to \nimprove prison conditions other than those that violate the Constitution.” Id. \nPetitioners request habeas relief and the release of thousands of inmates. However, the \nPLRA, 18 U.S.C. § 3626, titled “Appropriate remedies with respect to prison conditions,” places \nstrict limits on Courts’ ability to order the release of inmates “in any civil action with respect to \nprison conditions,” and precludes a single district judge from doing so.  Id. § 3626(a)(3)(A)-(B). \nThat law applies to “any civil proceeding arising under Federal law with respect to the conditions \nof confinement or the effects of actions by government officials on the lives of persons confined \nin prison, but does not include habeas corpus proceedings challenging the fact or duration of \nconfinement in prison.” Id. § 3626(g)(2).  \nIn such a suit, the Court “may enter a temporary restraining order or an order for \npreliminary injunctive relief,” but such injunctive relief “must be narrowly drawn, extend no \nfurther than necessary to correct the harm the court finds requires preliminary relief, and be the \nleast intrusive means necessary to correct that harm.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2). Under Section \n3626, a “prisoner release order”—which “includes any order, including a temporary restraining \norder or preliminary injunctive relief, that has the purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the \nprison population, or that directs the release from or nonadmission of prisoners to a prison,” 18 \n34 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 35 of 42\nU.S.C. § 3626(g)(4)—may “be entered only by a three-judge court,” id. § 3626(a)(3)(B), and \nthen only if certain conditions have been met.  \nAmong other requirements, “no court shall enter a prisoner release order unless—(i) a \ncourt has previously entered an order for less intrusive relief that has failed to remedy the \ndeprivation of the Federal right sought to be remedied through the prisoner release order; and (ii) \nthe defendant has had a reasonable amount of time to comply with the previous court orders.” Id. \n§3626(a)(3)(A).   \nCongress enacted the PLRA “to oust the federal judiciary from day-to-day prison \nmanagement.” Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Rouse, 129 F.3d 649, 655 (1st Cir. 1997); see \nalso Benjamin v. Jacobson, 172 F.3d 144, 182 (2d Cir. 1999) (en banc) (Calabresi, J., \nconcurring) (“The in banc majority argues at length that Congress meant to get the federal courts \nout of the business of running jails, and it cites any number of congressional statements to that \neffect.”). “Congress intended the PLRA to revive the hands-off doctrine,” which was “a rule of \njudicial quiescence derived from federalism and separation of powers concerns.” Gilmore v. \nCalifornia, 220 F.3d 987, 991, 997 (9th Cir. 2000). “Courts must be sensitive to the State’s \ninterest in punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation, as well as the need for deference to \nexperienced and expert prison administrators faced with the difficult and dangerous task of \nhousing large numbers of convicted criminals.” Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 511 (2011). \nSection 3626 thus “restrict[s] the equity jurisdiction of federal courts,” Gilmore, 220 F.3d \nat 999, and, “[b]y its terms . . . restricts the circumstances in which a court may enter an order \n‘that has the purpose or effect of reducing or limiting the prison population.’” Plata, 563 U.S. at \n511 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)). The PLRA’s “requirements ensure that the ‘last resort \nremedy’ of a population limit is not imposed ‘as a first step.’” Plata, 563 U.S. at 514 (quoting \n35 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 36 of 42\nInmates of Occoquan v. Barry, 844 F.2d 828, 843 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). “The release of prisoners in \nlarge numbers . . . is a matter of undoubted, grave concern.” Plata, 563 U.S. at 501.  \nSection 3626 prevents this Court from granting Petitioners’ requested relief.  Under \nSection 3626, “[t]he authority to order release of prisoners as a remedy to cure a systemic \nviolation of the Eighth Amendment is a power reserved to a three-judge district court, not a \nsingle-judge district court.” Plata, 563 U.S. at 500 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)); 18 U.S.C. § \n3626(a)(3)(B) (“In any civil action in Federal court with respect to prison conditions, a prisoner \nrelease order shall be entered only by a three-judge court.”).  \nMoreover, such an order may not be entered unless “(i) a court has previously entered an \norder for less intrusive relief that has failed to remedy the deprivation of the Federal right sought \nto be remedied through the prisoner release order; and (ii) the defendant has had a reasonable \namount of time to comply with the previous court orders.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3)(A).  And even \na three-judge court may only order prisoners released to remedy unconstitutional prison \nconditions “only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence” that “crowding is the \nprimary cause of the violation” and “no other relief will remedy [it].” Id. § 3626(a)(3)(E)(i)-(ii). \nHere, there can be no dispute that the instant lawsuit is a “civil action with respect to prison \nconditions” governed by §3626, which defines “civil action with respect to prison conditions” \nbroadly to mean “any civil proceeding arising under Federal law with respect to the conditions of \nconfinement or the effects of actions by government officials on the lives of persons confined in \nprison, but [that term] does not include habeas corpus proceedings challenging the fact or \nduration of confinement in prison.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(2). \nOne court recently reached this conclusion in an identical case.  In Money v. Pritzker, \nNos. 20- CV-2093 & 20-CV-2094, 2020 WL 1820660 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 10, 2020), inmates from \n36 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 37 of 42\nvarious Illinois Department of Correction facilities brought purported class action lawsuits \nseeking release of over 12,000 prisoners in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Court held that \nthe PLRA prevented it from entering the relief requested.  Id. at, *14; see also Jones v. Smith, \n720 F.3d 142, 145 n. 3 (2d Cir. 2013) (assuming that the PLRA applies to conditions of \nconfinement habeas claims brought under Section 2241). \nClearly, a mass release of all DOC inmates, or a subclass thereof including Petitioners, is \none of the least narrowly drawn and most intrusive means imaginable.  Thus, Petitioners’’ \nrequested relief is barred by statute.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2); see also Jones, 720 F.3d 142, \n145 n. 3 (2d Cir. 2013) (assuming that the PLRA applies to conditions of confinement claims \nbrought under Section 2241).  Even if Petitioners could somehow show a substantial likelihood \nof irreparable harm and success on the merits, their requested relief is barred. \n3.  The balance of equities and public interest weigh strongly in favor of \nRespondents. \n \n“A balance of hardships tipping decidedly toward the party requesting a preliminary \ninjunction means that, as compared to the hardship suffered by other party if the preliminary \ninjunction is granted, the hardship suffered by the moving party if the preliminary injunction is \ndenied will be so much greater that it may be characterized as a ‘real hardship.’”  Doe v. Zucker, \nNo. 117CV1005GTSCFH, 2019 WL 111020, at *6 (N.D.N.Y. Jan. 4, 2019) (emphasis added) \n(quotation omitted).  “‘A balance of equities tipping in favor of the party requesting a \npreliminary injunction’ means a balance of the hardships against the benefits.”  Id. (citing Ligon \nv. City of New York, 925 F. Supp. 2d 478, 539 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (characterizing the balancing \n“hardship imposed on one party” and “benefit to the other” as a “balanc[ing] [of] the equities”);  \n“[A] preliminary injunction is ‘in the public interest’ if the preliminary injunction would \nnot ‘cause harm to the public interest.’”  Doe, 2019 WL 111020, at *7 (quoting SEC v. Citigroup \n37 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 38 of 42\nGlobal Mkts. Inc., 673 F.3d 158, 163 n.1 (2d Cir. 2012).  “The ‘public interest’ is defined as \n‘[t]he general welfare of the public that warrants recognition and protection,’ and/or \n‘[s]omething in which the public as a whole has a stake[,] esp[ecially], an interest that justifies \ngovernmental regulation.’”  Id. (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary at 1350 (9th ed. 2009)). \nAs argued supra, given the uncertainty regarding the actual infection rate in the \ncommunity and the corresponding uncertainty as to the actual mitigation of any risk of infection \nin the community, the benefit of the injunction to Petitioners is likewise uncertain.  At first \nglance, an order releasing Petitioners from confinement seems beneficial to Petitioners.  But the \ncomplete lack of any plan to address their housing and/or their medical care contradicts that.  \nPetitioners cannot simply argue that the Court has “broad” power to fashion a remedy, ask for a \nmass release and leave all of the practical issues to this Court.  They carry a heavy burden.  \nPetitioners are bound by what they are actually requesting, which is mass release. \nThe harm to Respondents and the public are myriad and also largely overlap.  The risks \nto public safety are obvious.  Once released, inmates could re-offend.  (Ex. J at 15, ¶69.)  A mass \nrelease of inmates could overwhelm the healthcare system at a time when the State is just \npreparing to loosen lockdown procedures.  Inmates could refuse to abide by the “instructions” to \nself-quarantine and thereby further spread COVID-19.  This presents even more logistical \nproblems.  Who will set conditions of release and monitor releasees for compliance?  What \nhappens if an inmate does refuse to self-quarantine?  Would he be re-arrested and confined \nagain?  If so, by state authorities or federal authorities?  Where would be confined this time?  \nPetitioners are completely silent as to all of these very serious logistical and practical issues.  \nIndeed, based on the actual language of their requests for relief, Petitioners are seeking the \nrelease of sentenced inmates with no mention of their return to DOC custody.  Petitioners are \n38 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 39 of 42\nseeking a de facto pardon of a huge number of convicted felons, including six dozen murderers \nserving life sentences.  It would undoubtedly not be in the public interest for a federal court to \ninvalidate well over one thousand convictions and sentences issued by the state courts.  \nThe one thing Petitioners offer is a requirement that Respondents prove via “judicially-\nrecorded findings by clear and convincing evidence that the individual poses such a serious risk \nof flight or danger to others that no other conditions can mitigate.”  (Doc. #43 at 40.)  Petitioners \nare silent as to what this means.  The state courts would have no jurisdiction to re-evaluate “risk \nof flight or danger” of already sentenced inmates.  Petitioners are also taking contrary positions \nregarding bond arguments.  They asserted in opposition to Respondents’ motion to dismiss that \nthe state courts were effectively “closed,” despite two of them had already had bond reduction \nhearings, one of which was successful.  Now they suggest Respondents go to these same courts \nthey argue, incorrectly, are “closed” to get a lightning fast evaluation of potentially thousands of \ninmates, their risk of flight, and the danger they pose to the public.  Petitioners inconsistent \napproach to an essential element of releasing offenders into the community severely undercuts \nany claim that the balance of hardships weighs in their favor. \nFurthermore, there is a large segment of the population that has gone ignored during the \ncourse of this litigation: the hundreds of registered victims who have substantial rights under the \nconstitution and laws of the State of Connecticut.  Conn. Const. art. I, § 8b; Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ \n54-227, 52-230, 54-230a, 54-231.  No one has considered their rights to be notified or consulted, \nto make a statement, or to register their fears or objections that one or more of their attackers is \nabout to be released into the community.  The harm in granting the mandatory injunction to this \nclass of individuals is massive, and as is the case with all the other practical realities of what they \nseek, this goes completely unaddressed by Petitioners.  Indeed, the victims are already suffering \n39 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 40 of 42\nintense anxiety simply as a result of this litigation and the confusion Petitioners’ broad and \nillegal requested relief has caused.  The Victim Services Administrator attests to this: “when a \nvictim calls me and begs me to not let out the monster who viciously raped and beat her or \nbrutally killed their father because that’s what they’re ‘hearing on the news’ I do my best to \nreassure them, that yes although the Department of Correction is reviewing potential releases; \nthey need not worry.”  (Ex. K at 2, ¶10.)  If the injunction is granted, these reassurances will \nhave proven false.  The Petitioners are not the only people that have rights. \nRespondents are fulfilling their duties to inmates, including by thoughtfully evaluating \nwho can be released early and implementing a plan designed by the medical director that \ncomplies with CDC guidelines.  The plan is working.  Any death is tragic, but DOC has kept the \nmortality rate nine times lower than in the community.  Almost 75% of those infected have \nalready recovered and returned from NCI to their original facilities.   \nRespondents also have a duty to every citizen of Connecticut.  Petitioners’ plan to mass \nrelease inmates, without accounting for monitoring, housing, or if they will return, and without \neven contacting the victims is ill-conceived, reckless, and dangerous.  It would thwart \nRespondents’ ability to do right by all of Connecticut’s citizens.  Petitioners have not met their \nheavy burden to demonstrate the equities weigh in their favor and that the public interest would \nbe best served by granting their Motion.  Therefore, this Court must deny Petitioners’ request. \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor all the foregoing reasons the Respondents respectfully request this Court deny the \nPetitioners’ motion for Preliminary Injunction.  \n \n  \n40 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 59   Filed 05/18/20   Page 41 of 42\nRESPONDENTS, \nNED LAMONT, et al, \n  \nWILLIAM TONG \nATTORNEY GENERAL \n \nBY:   \n ________________                \nJames M.

CDC GUIDELINES \n \n1.  DOC will continue to make best efforts to implement CDC guidelines and to adapt them \nbased on best practices, recommendations from DPH, and based on individual facilities’ \nphysical space, staffing, population, operations, and other resources and conditions. \n \nB.  MONITORING \n \n2. A five person, independent Agreement Monitoring Panel (“AMP”) shall be established. \n \n3. The AMP shall be formed within four (4) weeks of the signing of this Agreement and \nconsist of five persons with appropriate knowledge and expertise in correctional \nhealth care and managing infectious disease in a correctional setting or in the \nmanagement of correctional systems. \n4.  The panel shall be selected as follows: two people chosen by defendants, who may be \nemployed by the DOC, two people chosen by plaintiffs, and one person who does not \ncurrently work for the DOC, who is an expert in the management of correctional \nsystems, and is chosen by a consensus of those persons already selected. The individuals \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 4 of 17\non the AMP (other than the DOC employees) will be paid by the State through order of \nthe court. The total fees for the duration of the agreement shall be capped at $15,000 per \npanel member. \n \n5.  The AMP shall make recommendations to aid DOC in continued compliance with the \nCDC guidelines, as well as evolving public health guidance that may require a change \nto DOC’s COVID-19 response. Its areas of focus shall include:  \na.  mass testing strategy;  \nb.  Quarantining/cohorting; and  \nc.  Sanitation/sanitization.  \n6.  The AMP shall devise procedures for the monitoring of this Agreement. In doing so, it \nshall apply professionally acceptable public health, epidemiological, and correctional \nhealthcare standards for correctional facilities in responding to COVID-19, with the \nrecognition that these will evolve over time. \n7.  Upon due notice to DOC, the AMP should be given access to DOC facilities to conduct \nonsite visits. Upon due notice, the AMP shall also have access to all DOC policies, \nprocedures and records detailing its COVID-19 response, as well as access to all staff \nand consulting physicians and experts with respect to DOC’s COVID-19 response. The \nindividuals on the AMP must sign a confidentiality agreement prior to being provided \nwith any documents that implicate safety and security, or medical privacy, or any other \nconfidential documents. The confidentiality agreement shall further prohibit \nredissemination of such documents and public comment on their work for the AMP.   \n  3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 5 of 17\nThe final reports of the AMP shall be public records as defined in Conn. Gen. Stat. § 1-\n200(5).1 \n8.  The AMP shall provide the defendants and counsel for the parties with a monthly report, \nfor the first three months, in a format to be agreed upon by the AMP and the parties. \nThese may be reduced to quarterly reports upon mutual agreement of the parties and the \nAMP. \n9.  The AMP may not alter, amend or change the provisions of the Agreement. \n \nC.  TESTING \n \n10. DOC agrees to continue to conduct mass testing of all prisoners incarcerated in \ncorrectional facilities, to the extent such tests remain available to the DOC, public health \nofficials from DPH in consultation with DOC’s Chief Medical Officer agree that this \ntesting strategy is appropriate and necessary, and subject to the informed agreement and \nconsent of the person being tested for active COVID-19 infection, until it has completed \nmass testing in all of its correctional facilities at least once. For purposes of this \nagreement, the term “mass testing” shall mean a test as described in Paragraph 11 below \nthat is offered on an opt-out basis to all prisoners housed in a correctional institution on \na single day or series of days that are close in time. People who recently tested positive \n(i.e. within the last 14 days) may be excluded from being offered mass testing. \n11. DOC may use any widely accepted, medically sanctioned COVID-19 viral testing \nmethod for these purposes. \n12. Unless otherwise recommended by the AMP, DOC will quarantine people newly \nadmitted to a correctional facility for 14 days. In this context, “quarantine” shall refer \n \n1  The Agreement has been modified by this writing, on June 26, 2020, by deleting the previous last sentence in \nparagraph 7, and by mutual written agreement pursuant to paragraph 27, the above stated language is substituted.  \n  4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 6 of 17\nto keeping these individuals separate from the general population in a unit where they \nare monitored for COVID-19 symptoms and tested if they develop any such \nsymptoms. \n13. Those who test positive for COVID-19 infection will be isolated as medically \nappropriate. Those who test positive for COVID-19 infection and are symptomatic \nwill be isolated as medically appropriate and shall be checked twice per day for \ntemperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation levels; and have \nblood pressure taken once per day. The parties acknowledge that this exceeds the \ncommunity standard of medical care. \n14. In accordance with CDC Guidelines, placement in medical monitoring, medical isolation \nand medical quarantine units shall not be considered punitive isolation. Regarding prisoners \nwho have been medically isolated and subsequently cleared of COVID-19 according to CDC \nGuidelines and thus released from medical isolation, DOC will continue to make best efforts \nto return such prisoners to their pre-medical isolation facility unless there are safety and \nsecurity concerns, or health concerns with this return. DOC will also make best efforts to \nreinstate such prisoners who previously held jobs or were in programs to these assignments, \nrecognizing that this may not always be possible due to safety and security concerns, health \nconcerns, available space, and other correctional management issues. DOC will continue to \nmake best efforts to communicate to prisoners this policy when moving prisoners to medical \nisolation. \n15. DOC will make best efforts to encourage all staff members to get regular COVID-19 \nviral testing. Recognizing the need for DOC and individual DOC facilities to remain \nflexible and adaptable to developing health and security concerns, DOC will continue \nto make best efforts to screen staff and any others entering DOC facilities consistent \n  5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 7 of 17\nwith CDC guidelines. \n16. Defendants agree to report to Plaintiffs’ counsel, every month, the total cumulative \nnumber of prisoners tested since the start of the pandemic by facility and the results \nof those tests. The first such report shall be required on the first business day of the \nmonth that follows the effective date of this settlement agreement. \nD.  SANITATION \n \n17. DOC will distribute soap to each person housed in a DOC facility (“Facility”) once a week \nwithout asking, and upon request, within 24 hours, provided that the person does not \nalready have 2 bars of soap in their possession. \n18. All common areas of Facilities, including but not limited to bathrooms, dayrooms, and \nshowers, shall be cleaned no less frequently than twice per shift on first and second shift \nfor bathrooms, dayrooms, and showers. This is intended to ensure a uniform minimum \nlevel of cleaning systemwide. This may be suspended for reasons consistent with \nParagraph 47 below. \n19. Prisoners will be provided (1) sufficient   disinfectant cleaning agents not diluted in \nexcess of manufacturers’ specifications, and (2) equipment, for the purpose of cleaning \ntheir cells, cubicles, or sleeping areas, no less frequently than twice per week. This may be \nsuspended for reasons consistent with Paragraph 47 below. \n20. All people in DOC custody shall be allowed to shower—in running water—no less than \nonce every other day, regardless of COVID-19 symptoms, test results, or housing. This \nmay be suspended for reasons consistent with Paragraph 47 below, or for maintenance \nissues. \n21. DOC will provide cleaning supplies to allow all prisoners in its custody in correctional \nfacilities to wipe down phones before they use them. \n  6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 8 of 17\n22. DOC will provide a minimum of two cloth or other barrier masks per person, and allow \nfor one mask to be exchanged each week for a new mask (or upon request, if a mask \nbecomes torn or otherwise damaged). This is contingent on the DOC being able to \ncontinue the production of cloth or barrier masks within its facilities; this ability to \nproduce masks could be interrupted or ceased due to various unforeseen circumstances, \nincluding lack of incarcerated workers, lack of correctional staff, lack of supplies due to \nsupply chain issues, lockdowns, riots, or other emergency circumstances. Prisoners will \nbe allowed to wear their masks for work assignments, and will be provided with gloves \nfor those assignments as needed. \n23. Staff in correctional facilities will be required to wear masks when social distancing is not \npossible. They may be exempted from this only if medically necessary. \nE.  DISCRETIONARY RELEASE OF PRISONERS \n \n24. Defendant Cook2 shall continue to examine his statutory powers to release prisoners to \nthe community and shall determine whether to exercise them on a case-by-case basis. \nNothing in this Settlement Agreement shall be interpreted to alter, limit, or otherwise change \nDefendant Cook’s statutory discretion over decisions regarding the release of people to the \ncommunity. Prisoners being considered shall be prioritized for consideration for community \nrelease if they are 65 and older or if they have a medical score of 4 or 5.  \n25. Defendants shall make best efforts to effectuate the staffing resources necessary to \nmaximize prompt and comprehensive consideration of discretionary releases. \nand Counsel for the Plaintiffs, on a monthly basis, as follows: (l) the number of \nindividuals reviewed for discretionary release; (2) the number of individuals granted \ndiscretionary release; and (3) the number of individuals denied discretionary release. \n2 \nReferences to Defendant Cook are intended to include members of his staff. \n \n  7 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 9 of 17\n \n26. For the duration of this Agreement, Counsel for the Defendants shall report to the \nCourt  \nF.  MODIFICATION OF THE AGREEMENT \n \n27. This Agreement may be modified only by the mutual written agreement of all parties. \n \nThe Court shall be notified in writing of all such modifications but need not approve \nsuch modifications. \nG. TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT \n \n28. The parties intend that this Agreement will remain in place until December \n31, 2020, provided that upon the mutual consent of the parties, it may be \nextended. The Agreement may also be terminated by mutual consent of the \nparties.  \n29. Upon termination, without the need for any further order of any state or federal \ncourt, all jurisdiction of any court to enforce this Agreement shall end. In the event \nany motions or proceedings are pending on or after December 31, 2020, the Court \nshall be bound to dismiss any such motions or proceedings. \nH. GENERAL RELEASE OF CLAIMS \n \n30. The named plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of their heirs, beneficiaries, \nsuccessors and assigns, in consideration of the benefits of this Agreement, release \nand forever discharge the defendants, Ned Lamont, Governor, State of Connecticut, \nand Rollin Cook, Commissioner of the Department of Correction, the State of \nConnecticut, all agencies of the State of Connecticut, all present and former officers, \nemployees and agents of the State of Connecticut, (including all current and former \n  8 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 10 of 17\nemployees of the State of Connecticut, Department of Correction and the University \nof Connecticut Health Center), in both their official and individual capacities, their \nheirs, successors and assigns, from all actions, causes of action, suits, claims, or \ncontroversies arising from acts or omissions alleged in the Complaint. Said liability \nincludes such actions as may have been or may in the future be brought in the federal \ncourts, the courts of the State of Connecticut, any state or federal administrative \nagency, or before the Claims Commissioner pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat.§ 4-141, et \nseq.  Furthermore, all class members as defined in paragraph 35 of this Agreement, \nindividually and on behalf of the Class, their heirs, beneficiaries, successors and \nassigns, in consideration of the benefits of this Agreement, release and forever \ndischarge the defendants, Ned Lamont, Governor, State of Connecticut, and Rollin \nCook, Commissioner of the Department of Correction, the State of Connecticut, all \nagencies of the State of Connecticut, all present and former officers, employees and \nagents of the State of Connecticut, (including all current and former employees of \nthe State of Connecticut, Department of Correction and the University of \nConnecticut Health Center), in both their official and individual capacities, their \nheirs, successors and assigns, from all actions, causes of action, suits, claims, or \ncontroversies for any and all forms of non-monetary relief arising from acts or \nomissions alleged in the Complaint, or from acts or omissions that could have been \nlitigated by the class in this action. Said liability includes such actions as may have \nbeen or may in the future be brought in the federal courts, the courts of the State of \nConnecticut, any state or federal administrative agency, or before the Claims \nCommissioner pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat.§ 4-141, et seq. Notwithstanding the \n  9 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 11 of 17\nprior sentence, this release does not include criminal matters, meaning motions for \nsentence modifications or bond modifications. This release does not apply to the \nability of class members to seek and/or qualify for discretionary release due to \nCOVID-19 under Defendants’ discretionary authority or to seek release due to \nCOVID-19 in criminal proceedings within the courts of the State of Connecticut. \nThis release does not apply to any habeas corpus petition seeking any relief due to \nthe COVID 19 pandemic that is pending as of the date of this Agreement.  However, \nthis release does apply to any and all class members’ habeas corpus cases seeking \nany relief due to the COVID 19 pandemic which may be brought during the time this \nAgreement is in effect.   In addition, this release applies to any motions seeking any \nrelief due to the COVID 19 pandemic which may be filed in a pending habeas corpus \npetition during the time this Agreement is in effect. \nI.  NO ADMISSION OF LIABILITY \n \n31. The Parties represent and warrant to each other that the parties specifically \nunderstand and agree that this Agreement is a settlement and compromise of their \ndifferences to resolve any and all claims that were raised in this action and is a \ncompromise of disputed claims without any adjudication of the rights, claims and \ndefenses of the parties. \n32. The existence of this Agreement shall not be construed as an admission of liability or \nof the truth of the allegations, claims, or contentions of any party. There are no \ncovenants, promises, undertakings, or understandings between the parties outside of \nthis Agreement except as specifically set forth herein. \n33. This Agreement is not a consent decree and shall not be incorporated into any \n  10 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 12 of 17\njudgment of the Court. To the contrary, this is a settlement agreement which the \nparties respectfully submit is a fair, reasonable and adequate resolution of this \ncase. \n34. The State agrees not to contest this Settlement Agreement as non-compliant with 18 \nU.S.C. § 3626. \nJ.  CLASS CERTIFICATION AND STIPULATED DISMISSAL \n \n35. The plaintiffs shall file a consent motion for certification of the plaintiff class within five \ndays of this agreement being executed. The class shall be defined as “all persons who were \nincarcerated in a DOC facility from March 1, 2020, or are incarcerated, or in the future \nwill be so incarcerated, until the termination date of this Agreement, December 31, 2020.” \n36. Within three days of the consent motion for class certification being granted, Plaintiffs \nand Defendants shall jointly sign and file a Fed. R. Civ. P. 41 Stipulated Dismissal of this \naction, with prejudice and without costs, together with their motion  for  an Order to Give \nNotice, and for a fairness hearing, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). On the date counsel \nfor the Plaintiffs sign this Agreement, Plaintiffs shall also withdraw CCDLA v. Lamont, \nDOCKET  NO.  UWY  CV-20-6054309-S  (April  23,  2020);  appeal  pending,    SC  20470  \nConnecticut Criminal Defense Lawyers Association Et Al. v. Ned Lamont, Et Al., without \ncosts to any party.  \n37. Throughout the duration of the Agreement, the parties agree to resolve disputes, and \nplaintiffs may seek to enforce the Agreement, only pursuant to the procedures outlined \nin Section J of this Agreement (“Dispute Resolution”). The parties understand and agree \nthat, if approved, and the Court consents, the Court will maintain jurisdiction of this \naction throughout the duration of the Agreement to resolve any disputes which cannot \n  11 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 13 of 17\nbe amicably resolved between the parties pursuant to the Dispute Resolution procedures \nset forth in Section J. If the parties are unable to resolve any such disputes with the \nassistance of the Settlement Judge, despite the Stipulated Dismissal, the Court may \nretain jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of the Agreement and the Plaintiffs may \nseek specific performance of the Agreement. \n38. The parties also agree that, if the Court approves this Agreement, after Notice to the \nclass, and a fairness hearing pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 23(e), the Court will order \na dismissal with prejudice pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 41 (a). The Court will not \nincorporate this Agreement into any Order of Dismissal, but will nevertheless remain \navailable to the parties to resolve disputes, and if necessary, to order specific \nperformance, after all of the procedures of Section J have been exhausted. \nK. DISPUTE RESOLUTION \n \n39. The parties agree to attempt an informal and private dispute resolution mediation with \nthe Honorable William I. Garfinkel, United States Magistrate Judge (“Settlement \nJudge”) to resolve any disputes that may arise arising under this Agreement. \n40. If, while this Agreement is in effect, Plaintiffs’ Counsel have reasonable grounds to \nbelieve that there is a systemic pattern or practice of non-compliance with this \nAgreement in one or more DOC Facilities, or if DOC proposes or enacts revisions or \nchanges to its COVID-19 policies and procedures that are materially inconsistent with \nthe Agreement and the CDC guidelines, and to the detriment of the class, Plaintiffs’ \nCounsel  will  provide  the  DOC  with  a  written  detailed  notice  of  potential \nnoncompliance, setting forth the factual basis for such claim. This notice will identify, \nwith particularity, the basis of the claim that the DOC is not in compliance; why such \n  12 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 14 of 17\nfacts constitute a systemic pattern or practice of non-compliance; and the specific \nmaterial provision of the Agreement or CDC guidelines that is implicated. \n41. Within twenty calendar days of receipt of the notification, the DOC shall provide a \ngood faith written response to the Plaintiffs' notification with a full factual explanation \nas to why the DOC believes it is in compliance with the specified material provisions, \nan explanation of the DOC's plans to achieve full compliance with the specified \nmaterial provisions, or an explanation of the bona fide medical, security, or other \nreasons for the alleged non-compliance. \n42. It is understood between the parties that certain unforeseeable events or conditions, \nincluding  but  not  limited  to  long-term  lockdowns  in  the  DOC,  and  changes  to \nestablished treatment practices and the standard of care for treatment of COVID-19 \ninfection, may prevent compliance with this Agreement. If so, the DOC shall notify \nPlaintiffs’ counsel of the event or condition, and the parties shall enter into good-faith \ndiscussions to resolve the issues. \n43. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within ten calendar days of DOC’s \nresponse, the parties shall notify the Settlement Judge. The Settlement Judge may, in \nthe Court’s discretion, establish such mediation procedures the Court deems \nappropriate. \n \n44. Plaintiffs’ Counsel may seek intervention from the Court only after all efforts for \nresolving  the  dispute  with  the  assistance  of  the  Settlement  Judge  have  been \nunsuccessful. They may do so by filing a motion for specific performance of the \nmaterial provision identified. The Court may, after appropriate notice, filing of moving \nand opposing papers, submission of evidence and an evidentiary hearing, order specific \nperformance of the material provision specified in the notice upon a showing that the \n  13 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 15 of 17\nDOC is in substantial and systemic non-compliance with that material provision. \n45. Plaintiffs agree they shall not file a motion for contempt. The Court may not entertain a \nmotion for contempt and the Court may not grant any remedial relief in the nature of \na contempt of court finding against Defendants. If Plaintiffs prevail on their claim of \nnon-compliance, the sole remedy shall be specific performance of this Agreement. \n46. The plaintiffs agree not to seek any attorneys’ fees and/or costs for any time spent in \nany portion of dispute resolution, including, but not limited to, the drafting and sending \nof the notice of noncompliance, reviewing DOC’s response, dispute resolution with \nthe Settlement Judge, or any motion filed with the court for specific performance of \nthe Agreement. \n \nL.  GENERAL PROVISIONS \n \n47. The provisions of this Agreement may be suspended or modified in part or in entirety at a \nspecific DOC facility only if the defendants or their designees determine that a “genuine \nemergency”  exists  at  that  DOC  facility.  Genuine  emergency  means  any  special \ncircumstances under which it is reasonable to conclude that there is any actual or potential \nthreat to the security of that DOC facility, or to the safety of the staff, prisoners or other \npersons within such facility. If a “genuine emergency” lasts longer than twenty-four hours, \nor occurs more than once in a one-week period, defendants shall report to plaintiffs’ \ncounsel, within forty-eight hours except for good cause, the date of the emergency, the \nnature of the emergency, and what provisions of this Agreement have been temporarily \nsuspended. \n \n \n  14 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 16 of 17\nM. ATTORNEYS’ FEES \n \n48. The defendants will pay to counsel for the plaintiff class the sum of $40,000.00, all in \nfull and final settlement of this action. This sum shall include all claims of any kind \nfor monetary payments of any kind for attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses related to \nthis litigation of any kind that could be claimed in this action, either now or in the \nfuture, including but not limited to attorneys' fees, costs and expenses, from the \nbeginning of the world to the end of time. \n49. Plaintiffs’ counsel further agrees not to seek any prospective fees and/or costs for any time \nspent in any future work on this case of any kind, including, but not limited to the portion \nrelated to dispute resolution. \n \nPLAINTIFFS, \nTRE MCPHERSON, PATTIKATE WILLIAMS-VOID, \nTHOMAS CAVES, MR.

CDC GUIDELINES \n \n1.  DOC will continue to make best efforts to implement CDC guidelines and to adapt them \nbased on best practices, recommendations from DPH, and based on individual facilities’ \nphysical space, staffing, population, operations, and other resources and conditions. \n \nB.  MONITORING \n \n2. A five person, independent Agreement Monitoring Panel (“AMP”) shall be established. \n \n3. The AMP shall be formed within four (4) weeks of the signing of this Agreement and \nconsist of five persons with appropriate knowledge and expertise in correctional \nhealth care and managing infectious disease in a correctional setting or in the \nmanagement of correctional systems. \n4.  The panel shall be selected as follows: two people chosen by defendants, who may be \nemployed by the DOC, two people chosen by plaintiffs, and one person who does not \ncurrently work for the DOC, who is an expert in the management of correctional \nsystems, and is chosen by a consensus of those persons already selected. The individuals \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 4 of 17\non the AMP (other than the DOC employees) will be paid by the State through order of \nthe court. The total fees for the duration of the agreement shall be capped at $15,000 per \npanel member. \n \n5.  The AMP shall make recommendations to aid DOC in continued compliance with the \nCDC guidelines, as well as evolving public health guidance that may require a change \nto DOC’s COVID-19 response. Its areas of focus shall include:  \na.  mass testing strategy;  \nb.  Quarantining/cohorting; and  \nc.  Sanitation/sanitization.  \n6.  The AMP shall devise procedures for the monitoring of this Agreement. In doing so, it \nshall apply professionally acceptable public health, epidemiological, and correctional \nhealthcare standards for correctional facilities in responding to COVID-19, with the \nrecognition that these will evolve over time. \n7.  Upon due notice to DOC, the AMP should be given access to DOC facilities to conduct \nonsite visits. Upon due notice, the AMP shall also have access to all DOC policies, \nprocedures and records detailing its COVID-19 response, as well as access to all staff \nand consulting physicians and experts with respect to DOC’s COVID-19 response. The \nindividuals on the AMP must sign a confidentiality agreement prior to being provided \nwith any documents that implicate safety and security, or medical privacy, or any other \nconfidential documents. The confidentiality agreement shall further prohibit \nredissemination of such documents and public comment on their work for the AMP.   \n  3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 5 of 17\nThe final reports of the AMP shall be public records as defined in Conn. Gen. Stat. § 1-\n200(5).1 \n8.  The AMP shall provide the defendants and counsel for the parties with a monthly report, \nfor the first three months, in a format to be agreed upon by the AMP and the parties. \nThese may be reduced to quarterly reports upon mutual agreement of the parties and the \nAMP. \n9.  The AMP may not alter, amend or change the provisions of the Agreement. \n \nC.  TESTING \n \n10. DOC agrees to continue to conduct mass testing of all prisoners incarcerated in \ncorrectional facilities, to the extent such tests remain available to the DOC, public health \nofficials from DPH in consultation with DOC’s Chief Medical Officer agree that this \ntesting strategy is appropriate and necessary, and subject to the informed agreement and \nconsent of the person being tested for active COVID-19 infection, until it has completed \nmass testing in all of its correctional facilities at least once. For purposes of this \nagreement, the term “mass testing” shall mean a test as described in Paragraph 11 below \nthat is offered on an opt-out basis to all prisoners housed in a correctional institution on \na single day or series of days that are close in time. People who recently tested positive \n(i.e. within the last 14 days) may be excluded from being offered mass testing. \n11. DOC may use any widely accepted, medically sanctioned COVID-19 viral testing \nmethod for these purposes. \n12. Unless otherwise recommended by the AMP, DOC will quarantine people newly \nadmitted to a correctional facility for 14 days. In this context, “quarantine” shall refer \n \n1  The Agreement has been modified by this writing, on June 26, 2020, by deleting the previous last sentence in \nparagraph 7, and by mutual written agreement pursuant to paragraph 27, the above stated language is substituted.  \n  4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 6 of 17\nto keeping these individuals separate from the general population in a unit where they \nare monitored for COVID-19 symptoms and tested if they develop any such \nsymptoms. \n13. Those who test positive for COVID-19 infection will be isolated as medically \nappropriate. Those who test positive for COVID-19 infection and are symptomatic \nwill be isolated as medically appropriate and shall be checked twice per day for \ntemperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation levels; and have \nblood pressure taken once per day. The parties acknowledge that this exceeds the \ncommunity standard of medical care. \n14. In accordance with CDC Guidelines, placement in medical monitoring, medical isolation \nand medical quarantine units shall not be considered punitive isolation. Regarding prisoners \nwho have been medically isolated and subsequently cleared of COVID-19 according to CDC \nGuidelines and thus released from medical isolation, DOC will continue to make best efforts \nto return such prisoners to their pre-medical isolation facility unless there are safety and \nsecurity concerns, or health concerns with this return. DOC will also make best efforts to \nreinstate such prisoners who previously held jobs or were in programs to these assignments, \nrecognizing that this may not always be possible due to safety and security concerns, health \nconcerns, available space, and other correctional management issues. DOC will continue to \nmake best efforts to communicate to prisoners this policy when moving prisoners to medical \nisolation. \n15. DOC will make best efforts to encourage all staff members to get regular COVID-19 \nviral testing. Recognizing the need for DOC and individual DOC facilities to remain \nflexible and adaptable to developing health and security concerns, DOC will continue \nto make best efforts to screen staff and any others entering DOC facilities consistent \n  5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 7 of 17\nwith CDC guidelines. \n16. Defendants agree to report to Plaintiffs’ counsel, every month, the total cumulative \nnumber of prisoners tested since the start of the pandemic by facility and the results \nof those tests. The first such report shall be required on the first business day of the \nmonth that follows the effective date of this settlement agreement. \nD.  SANITATION \n \n17. DOC will distribute soap to each person housed in a DOC facility (“Facility”) once a week \nwithout asking, and upon request, within 24 hours, provided that the person does not \nalready have 2 bars of soap in their possession. \n18. All common areas of Facilities, including but not limited to bathrooms, dayrooms, and \nshowers, shall be cleaned no less frequently than twice per shift on first and second shift \nfor bathrooms, dayrooms, and showers. This is intended to ensure a uniform minimum \nlevel of cleaning systemwide. This may be suspended for reasons consistent with \nParagraph 47 below. \n19. Prisoners will be provided (1) sufficient   disinfectant cleaning agents not diluted in \nexcess of manufacturers’ specifications, and (2) equipment, for the purpose of cleaning \ntheir cells, cubicles, or sleeping areas, no less frequently than twice per week. This may be \nsuspended for reasons consistent with Paragraph 47 below. \n20. All people in DOC custody shall be allowed to shower—in running water—no less than \nonce every other day, regardless of COVID-19 symptoms, test results, or housing. This \nmay be suspended for reasons consistent with Paragraph 47 below, or for maintenance \nissues. \n21. DOC will provide cleaning supplies to allow all prisoners in its custody in correctional \nfacilities to wipe down phones before they use them. \n  6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 8 of 17\n22. DOC will provide a minimum of two cloth or other barrier masks per person, and allow \nfor one mask to be exchanged each week for a new mask (or upon request, if a mask \nbecomes torn or otherwise damaged). This is contingent on the DOC being able to \ncontinue the production of cloth or barrier masks within its facilities; this ability to \nproduce masks could be interrupted or ceased due to various unforeseen circumstances, \nincluding lack of incarcerated workers, lack of correctional staff, lack of supplies due to \nsupply chain issues, lockdowns, riots, or other emergency circumstances. Prisoners will \nbe allowed to wear their masks for work assignments, and will be provided with gloves \nfor those assignments as needed. \n23. Staff in correctional facilities will be required to wear masks when social distancing is not \npossible. They may be exempted from this only if medically necessary. \nE.  DISCRETIONARY RELEASE OF PRISONERS \n \n24. Defendant Cook2 shall continue to examine his statutory powers to release prisoners to \nthe community and shall determine whether to exercise them on a case-by-case basis. \nNothing in this Settlement Agreement shall be interpreted to alter, limit, or otherwise change \nDefendant Cook’s statutory discretion over decisions regarding the release of people to the \ncommunity. Prisoners being considered shall be prioritized for consideration for community \nrelease if they are 65 and older or if they have a medical score of 4 or 5.  \n25. Defendants shall make best efforts to effectuate the staffing resources necessary to \nmaximize prompt and comprehensive consideration of discretionary releases. \nand Counsel for the Plaintiffs, on a monthly basis, as follows: (l) the number of \nindividuals reviewed for discretionary release; (2) the number of individuals granted \ndiscretionary release; and (3) the number of individuals denied discretionary release. \n2 \nReferences to Defendant Cook are intended to include members of his staff. \n \n  7 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 9 of 17\n \n26. For the duration of this Agreement, Counsel for the Defendants shall report to the \nCourt  \nF.  MODIFICATION OF THE AGREEMENT \n \n27. This Agreement may be modified only by the mutual written agreement of all parties. \n \nThe Court shall be notified in writing of all such modifications but need not approve \nsuch modifications. \nG. TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT \n \n28. The parties intend that this Agreement will remain in place until December \n31, 2020, provided that upon the mutual consent of the parties, it may be \nextended. The Agreement may also be terminated by mutual consent of the \nparties.  \n29. Upon termination, without the need for any further order of any state or federal \ncourt, all jurisdiction of any court to enforce this Agreement shall end. In the event \nany motions or proceedings are pending on or after December 31, 2020, the Court \nshall be bound to dismiss any such motions or proceedings. \nH. GENERAL RELEASE OF CLAIMS \n \n30. The named plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of their heirs, beneficiaries, \nsuccessors and assigns, in consideration of the benefits of this Agreement, release \nand forever discharge the defendants, Ned Lamont, Governor, State of Connecticut, \nand Rollin Cook, Commissioner of the Department of Correction, the State of \nConnecticut, all agencies of the State of Connecticut, all present and former officers, \nemployees and agents of the State of Connecticut, (including all current and former \n  8 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 10 of 17\nemployees of the State of Connecticut, Department of Correction and the University \nof Connecticut Health Center), in both their official and individual capacities, their \nheirs, successors and assigns, from all actions, causes of action, suits, claims, or \ncontroversies arising from acts or omissions alleged in the Complaint.

To the contrary, this is a settlement agreement which the \nparties respectfully submit is a fair, reasonable and adequate resolution of this \ncase. \n34. The State agrees not to contest this Settlement Agreement as non-compliant with 18 \nU.S.C. § 3626. \nJ.  CLASS CERTIFICATION AND STIPULATED DISMISSAL \n \n35. The plaintiffs shall file a consent motion for certification of the plaintiff class within five \ndays of this agreement being executed. The class shall be defined as “all persons who were \nincarcerated in a DOC facility from March 1, 2020, or are incarcerated, or in the future \nwill be so incarcerated, until the termination date of this Agreement, December 31, 2020.” \n36. Within three days of the consent motion for class certification being granted, Plaintiffs \nand Defendants shall jointly sign and file a Fed. R. Civ. P. 41 Stipulated Dismissal of this \naction, with prejudice and without costs, together with their motion  for  an Order to Give \nNotice, and for a fairness hearing, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). On the date counsel \nfor the Plaintiffs sign this Agreement, Plaintiffs shall also withdraw CCDLA v. Lamont, \nDOCKET  NO.  UWY  CV-20-6054309-S  (April  23,  2020);  appeal  pending,    SC  20470  \nConnecticut Criminal Defense Lawyers Association Et Al. v. Ned Lamont, Et Al., without \ncosts to any party.  \n37. Throughout the duration of the Agreement, the parties agree to resolve disputes, and \nplaintiffs may seek to enforce the Agreement, only pursuant to the procedures outlined \nin Section J of this Agreement (“Dispute Resolution”). The parties understand and agree \nthat, if approved, and the Court consents, the Court will maintain jurisdiction of this \naction throughout the duration of the Agreement to resolve any disputes which cannot \n  11 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 13 of 17\nbe amicably resolved between the parties pursuant to the Dispute Resolution procedures \nset forth in Section J. If the parties are unable to resolve any such disputes with the \nassistance of the Settlement Judge, despite the Stipulated Dismissal, the Court may \nretain jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of the Agreement and the Plaintiffs may \nseek specific performance of the Agreement. \n38. The parties also agree that, if the Court approves this Agreement, after Notice to the \nclass, and a fairness hearing pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 23(e), the Court will order \na dismissal with prejudice pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 41 (a). The Court will not \nincorporate this Agreement into any Order of Dismissal, but will nevertheless remain \navailable to the parties to resolve disputes, and if necessary, to order specific \nperformance, after all of the procedures of Section J have been exhausted. \nK. DISPUTE RESOLUTION \n \n39. The parties agree to attempt an informal and private dispute resolution mediation with \nthe Honorable William I. Garfinkel, United States Magistrate Judge (“Settlement \nJudge”) to resolve any disputes that may arise arising under this Agreement. \n40. If, while this Agreement is in effect, Plaintiffs’ Counsel have reasonable grounds to \nbelieve that there is a systemic pattern or practice of non-compliance with this \nAgreement in one or more DOC Facilities, or if DOC proposes or enacts revisions or \nchanges to its COVID-19 policies and procedures that are materially inconsistent with \nthe Agreement and the CDC guidelines, and to the detriment of the class, Plaintiffs’ \nCounsel  will  provide  the  DOC  with  a  written  detailed  notice  of  potential \nnoncompliance, setting forth the factual basis for such claim. This notice will identify, \nwith particularity, the basis of the claim that the DOC is not in compliance; why such \n  12 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 14 of 17\nfacts constitute a systemic pattern or practice of non-compliance; and the specific \nmaterial provision of the Agreement or CDC guidelines that is implicated. \n41. Within twenty calendar days of receipt of the notification, the DOC shall provide a \ngood faith written response to the Plaintiffs' notification with a full factual explanation \nas to why the DOC believes it is in compliance with the specified material provisions, \nan explanation of the DOC's plans to achieve full compliance with the specified \nmaterial provisions, or an explanation of the bona fide medical, security, or other \nreasons for the alleged non-compliance. \n42. It is understood between the parties that certain unforeseeable events or conditions, \nincluding  but  not  limited  to  long-term  lockdowns  in  the  DOC,  and  changes  to \nestablished treatment practices and the standard of care for treatment of COVID-19 \ninfection, may prevent compliance with this Agreement. If so, the DOC shall notify \nPlaintiffs’ counsel of the event or condition, and the parties shall enter into good-faith \ndiscussions to resolve the issues. \n43. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within ten calendar days of DOC’s \nresponse, the parties shall notify the Settlement Judge. The Settlement Judge may, in \nthe Court’s discretion, establish such mediation procedures the Court deems \nappropriate. \n \n44. Plaintiffs’ Counsel may seek intervention from the Court only after all efforts for \nresolving  the  dispute  with  the  assistance  of  the  Settlement  Judge  have  been \nunsuccessful. They may do so by filing a motion for specific performance of the \nmaterial provision identified. The Court may, after appropriate notice, filing of moving \nand opposing papers, submission of evidence and an evidentiary hearing, order specific \nperformance of the material provision specified in the notice upon a showing that the \n  13 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 15 of 17\nDOC is in substantial and systemic non-compliance with that material provision. \n45. Plaintiffs agree they shall not file a motion for contempt. The Court may not entertain a \nmotion for contempt and the Court may not grant any remedial relief in the nature of \na contempt of court finding against Defendants. If Plaintiffs prevail on their claim of \nnon-compliance, the sole remedy shall be specific performance of this Agreement. \n46. The plaintiffs agree not to seek any attorneys’ fees and/or costs for any time spent in \nany portion of dispute resolution, including, but not limited to, the drafting and sending \nof the notice of noncompliance, reviewing DOC’s response, dispute resolution with \nthe Settlement Judge, or any motion filed with the court for specific performance of \nthe Agreement. \n \nL.  GENERAL PROVISIONS \n \n47. The provisions of this Agreement may be suspended or modified in part or in entirety at a \nspecific DOC facility only if the defendants or their designees determine that a “genuine \nemergency”  exists  at  that  DOC  facility.  Genuine  emergency  means  any  special \ncircumstances under which it is reasonable to conclude that there is any actual or potential \nthreat to the security of that DOC facility, or to the safety of the staff, prisoners or other \npersons within such facility. If a “genuine emergency” lasts longer than twenty-four hours, \nor occurs more than once in a one-week period, defendants shall report to plaintiffs’ \ncounsel, within forty-eight hours except for good cause, the date of the emergency, the \nnature of the emergency, and what provisions of this Agreement have been temporarily \nsuspended. \n \n \n  14 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 119-1   Filed 06/26/20   Page 16 of 17\nM. ATTORNEYS’ FEES \n \n48. The defendants will pay to counsel for the plaintiff class the sum of $40,000.00, all in \nfull and final settlement of this action. This sum shall include all claims of any kind \nfor monetary payments of any kind for attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses related to \nthis litigation of any kind that could be claimed in this action, either now or in the \nfuture, including but not limited to attorneys' fees, costs and expenses, from the \nbeginning of the world to the end of time. \n49. Plaintiffs’ counsel further agrees not to seek any prospective fees and/or costs for any time \nspent in any future work on this case of any kind, including, but not limited to the portion \nrelated to dispute resolution. \n \nPLAINTIFFS, \nTRE MCPHERSON, PATTIKATE WILLIAMS-VOID, \nTHOMAS CAVES, MR.

      "text": "Case 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 172   Filed 07/20/20   Page 1 of 4\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nDISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT \nTRE  MCPHERSON,  PATTIKATE  WILLIAMS-\nVOID,  JOHN  DOE,  JOHN  ROE,  and  THOMAS  Civil No. 3:20cv534 (JBA) \nCAVES, on behalf oft hemselves and all others similarly \nsituated,  July 20, 2020 \nPlaintiffs, \nV. \nNED LAMONT and ROLLIN COOK, in their official \ncapacities, \nDefendants. \nORDER DENYING POST-NOTICE OPT-OUT AND INTERVENOR MOTIONS \nBefore the Court are various motions (\"Post-Notice Motions\") related to the Parties Rule \n23(c)(2)(A) notice to the Class, which is composed of individuals incarcerated in Connecticut \nDepartment of Correction facilities, and their proposed settlement. \nOn June 19, 2020, the Court granted the parties' Joint Motion for Fairness Hearing and for \nOrder Approving Notice to the Class. ([Doc.# 112].) The Court determined that the parties' notice \nto the Class was \"reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties \nof the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections and also \nafford a reasonable time for those interested to do so.\" (Id. at 1 (c iting  Weinberger v. Kendrick,698 \nF.2d 61, 71 (2d Cir. 1982).) \nSubsequent to the issuance of this notice, some Class Members submitted motions and \nrequests for various forms of relief related to this action. (Rupert Thompson Mot. to Intervene \n[Doc.# 127]; Objs. to Settlement and Request to Opt-Out by Fifty Class Members [Docs.## 135, \n153]; Objs. to Settlement and Request to Opt-Out by Seven Class Members [Doc.# 137]; Derrick \nTaylor Mots. to Intervene and for Ext. Time to Appeal Settlement [Doc.# 152]; Glen Sharkany \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 172   Filed 07/20/20   Page 2 of 4\nMot. to Stop Payout to ACLU Attorneys [Doc.# 154]; Glen Sharkany Mot. to Dismiss [Doc.# 155]; \nShakee Galberth. Not. Opt-Out [Doc.# 158]; Not. Opp. and Request to Opt-Out by Three Class \nMembers [Doc.# 159]; Tyrone Rosa and Angel Dethomas Nots. Opt-Out [Doc.# 164].) Generally, \nthese  Class Members  register  objections  to  the  settlement and seek to withdraw from  the \nsettlement or intervene in a manner that would allow them to alter the terms of the settlement. For \nexample, an objection motion, submitted by Class Member Derrick Taylor, registers complaints \nabout the sanitation conditions at MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution, describes his \ndifficulties in communication with Class Counsel, and states that he \"personally need[s] time to \ndetermine whether to appeal the impending settlement\" in this case. (Derrick Taylor Mots. to \nIntervene and for Ext. Time to Appeal Settlement at 8.) Another objection motion, submitted by \nfifty Class Members, makes \"demands\" for the State of Connecticut to \"offer a public apology to \nincarcerated people and their families for its history of human rights abuses.\" \"releas[ e] at least \n50%  of incarcerated people before  the  end of 2020,\"  and  \"reduce public  expenditures  on \nincarceration by 50% in 2020,\" among other things. (Objs. to Settlement and Request to Opt-Out \nby Fifty Class Members at 4-5.) These objectors ask the Court to use its discretion to \"allow [these] \nindividuals to opt-out of membership in [this] class action, even\" though it is \"a mandatory Rule \n23(b)(2) class action.\" (Id. at 5 (citing McReynolds v. Richards-Cantave, 588 F.3d 790, 800 (2d Cir. \n2008)).) \nDefendants oppose these requests for relief and ask the Court to deny \"all pending motions \nto opt out\" and \"all motions to intervene.\" (Def.'s Opp. to All Pending Mots. to Opt-Out and \nIntervene [Doc. # 170] at 7.) Defendants contend that \"claims for individualized relief ... do not \nsatisfy Rule 23(b)(2).\" (Def.'s Opp. at 2 (footnote omitted).) Defendants note that the approved \nRule 23 \"Notice did not advise the class members that they have a right to opt out, as that would \n2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 172   Filed 07/20/20   Page 3 of 4\nnot have been a reasonable interpretation of the law pertaining to (b )(2) classes, and it would not \nhave been a 'neutral' notice.\" (Id. at 3 (emphasis omitted).) Defendants further observe Plaintiffs' \nComplaint raises claims that are injunctive in nature and \"contains no prayer for relief of monetary \ndamages,\" rendering this case \"easily distinguishable\" from the discretionary opt-out cases upon \nwhich objectors rely, as those \"involved monetary compensation for class members.\" (Id.  at 6.) \nDefendants assert that this case is instead governed by the principles articulated in Messier v. \nSouthbury Training School, 183 F.R.D. 350, 355 (D. Conn. 1998), which explained that \"ordering \nopt-outs could be counterproductive in a suit for declaratory or injunctive relief.\" Defendants also \nsuggest that opting out of this Rule 23(b )(2) action would have \"little practical value or effect\" on \nthe objecting Class Members because those \"who opted out could not avoid the effects of the \nSettlement Agreement, and would enjoy the benefits of the Agreement,\" but such opt-outs would \nultimately \"deprive the defendants of the benefit of their bargain.\" (Def.'s Opp. at 6.) \nFollowing a review of objectors' requests for relief, the Court agrees with Defendants that \ndenial is proper. As the Supreme Court has explained, Rule 23 \"provides no opportunity for (b) ( 1) \nor (b)(2) class members to opt out, and does not even oblige the District Court to afford them \nnotice of the action.\" Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338,362 (2011).1 That is because the \n\"key to the (b )(2) class is the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted \nthe notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the \nclass members or as to none of them.\" Id. at 360 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n1 The Court notes that each of the cases cited by the fifty objectors in support of their opt \nout request was issued prior to the Supreme Court's ruling in Dukes. \n3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 172   Filed 07/20/20   Page 4 of 4\nAccordingly, the Court DENIES the Post-Notice Motions [Docs.## 127,135,137,152 153, \n154, 155, 158, 159, 164] insofar as they request individualized relief. The substance of the objections \nto the Settlement Agreement voiced in these motions will generally be reviewed at the July 20, 2020 \nFairness Hearing. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \ns \nJanet Bond Arterton, U.S.D.J. \nDated at New Haven, Connecticut this 20th day of July 2020. \n4 ",

Although the coronavirus outbreak has moved across the globe with a speed and ferocity \nthat has rendered photographs of pre-pandemic life in Connecticut quaint in just six weeks, the \ndefendants interpose jurisdictional objections seeming like relics of another era and suggestive of \na shell game.  They contend that the proposed plaintiff Classes may not break the glass and pull \nthe fire alarms of either § 2241 or § 1983 without first spending months or years in the state courts \nor a minimum of ninety days writing grievances to their jailers, respectively.  They also advance \nthe theory that the Court should abstain from passing judgment, in deference to a state suit filed \nagainst them by some Class members in which they successfully convinced the state court that it \nlacked subject matter jurisdiction. \n  The buck stops here.  The exhaustion that defendants argue is required of § 2241 petitions \nis a prudential consideration, not a jurisdictional one.  The Court may find it inapplicable where-\nas here-the state judiciary's capacity has been squeezed to a trickle as a natural consequence of \nCOVID restrictions shuttering twenty-eight seats of court, operating the remaining six only three \ndays a week at reduced hours, and prioritizing all but a short list of matters excluding habeas \npetitions.  Likewise, the administrative exhaustion that the defendants raise as an affirmative \ndefense to the Classes' § 1983 claims fails in the face of the Classes' inability to complete the \ndefendants' three-month grievance procedure, and the defendants' inability to provide anyone who \nhas managed to grieve with the necessary remedies to prevent further COVID infection.  And \nfinally, the Younger abstention that defendants suggest has no applicability in a litigation like this \none, where the Classes have not asked the Court to enjoin a pending state proceeding.  The Court \nmust accordingly deny the defendants' motion to dismiss in its entirety  \n.\n1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34   Filed 05/03/20   Page 4 of 27\n \nARGUMENT \nI.  THIS  COURT  HAS  JURISDICTION  TO  CONSIDER  THE  MEDICALLY \nVULNERABLE SUBCLASSES’ CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 2241.  \nA.  Section 2241 is the Appropriate Mechanism for Relief.   \nDefendants believe this Court should treat the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses’ request \nfor release as “a Petition for a writ of habeas corpus by state inmates via § 2254.”  (Mot. at 4.)  To \nbe clear, Plaintiffs and the putative subclasses challenge the fact of their detention in these \nexceptional circumstances and ask for habeas relief under § 2241.  No Plaintiff or putative class \nmember challenges the lawfulness of a sentence through this petition.  Section 2241 is a fail-safe \nhabeas guarantee that applies when a prisoner “is in custody under or by color of the authority of \nthe United States” or “is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United \nStates.”  28 U.S.C. § 2241(a), (c)(1), (c)(3). Therefore, § 2241 expressly grants this Court \njurisdiction to entertain a federal habeas petition from incarcerated people who allege that the fact \nof continued custody violates federal law, and seek temporary release due to the significant health \nrisks they face due to their continued detention in unlawfully unsafe conditions.  \nB.  There  is  no  Mandatory  or  Statutory  Exhaustion  Requirement  for  Claims \nBrought  Under  §  2241,  and  the  Court  May  Exercise  Jurisdiction  without \nRequiring  Plaintiffs  and  the  Subclasses  to  Exhaust  Administrative  or  State \nRemedies.  \nDefendants wrongly believe that § 2241 requires Plaintiffs to exhaust administrative and \nstate court remedies before this Court may hear merits of the Petition.  Defendants acknowledge, \nhowever, that § 2241 does not expressly require exhaustion of state court or administrative \nremedies before a court may consider a petition for relief. Defs.’ Mot. At 6. This differentiates § \n2241 from § 2254, which does have a mandatory exhaustion requirement.1  To the extent courts \n \n1 Courts within the Second Circuit have repeatedly affirmed a futility exception even in the more standard \n§ 2254 context. See, e.g., Aparicio v. Artuz, 269 F.3d 78, 90 (2d Cir. 2001) (exhaustion waived for futility \n2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34   Filed 05/03/20   Page 5 of 27\n \nhave required petitioners to exhaust before bringing a § 2241 habeas claim, this requirement is \nexclusively judge-made and not statutory.  See Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Kentucky, \n410 U.S. 484, 490 (1973) (describing the exhaustion doctrine in § 2241 cases as a “judicially \ncrafted instrument which reflects a careful balance between important interests of federalism and \nthe need to preserve the writ of habeas corpus as a ‘swift and imperative remedy in all cases of \nillegal restraint or confinement’”) (citation omitted).  The distinction is crucial: whereas § 2254’s \nstatutory exhaustion requirement is mandatory, the prudential exhaustion requirement for § 2241 \npetitions is discretionary and non-jurisdictional.  Beharry v. Ashcroft, 329 F.3d 51, 56-57 (2d Cir. \n2003); see also Mihailovich v. Berkebile, No. 3:06-CV-1603-N, 2007 WL 942091, at *6 (N.D. \nTex. Mar. 28, 2007) (“Although prisoners generally must exhaust their administrative remedies \nprior to filing a § 2241 action, exhaustion of such remedies is not a jurisdictional requirement.”).  \n  The exhaustion bar Defendants ask this Court to impose is therefore prudential.  Courts \nthat have imposed prudential exhaustion rules on § 2241 petitioners have done so because \npetitioners sought modifications to confinement conditions rather than discharge.  Fan v. Williams, \n3:17-cv-630, 2017 WL 1652547 (D. Conn. Apr. 28, 2017); Anderson v. Williams, 3:15-cv-1364, \n2017 WL 855795 (D. Conn Mar. 3, 2017); Clark v. Zickefoose, 3:08-cv-1555, 2009 WL 2195113 \n(D. Conn July, 23, 2009). The concerns that animate such prudential restrictions—the existence of \nparallel statutes with exhaustion requirements—do not apply to those seeking discharge.  Here, by \ncontrast, the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses seek COVID-19-based temporary release, and the \n \nwhen unexhausted claim is procedurally barred); Mercado v. Rockefeller, 502 F.2d 666, 672 (2d Cir. 1974) \n(“We hold that appellants, in order to present to federal courts their claim . . . are not required to present \nthis claim to the New York courts first, for it is evident that under the prevailing law of that state such a \npresentation would only be an exercise in futility”); Pope v. Lord, No. 00-CV-6530 (JBW), 2003 WL \n21812455, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. July 23, 2003) (“Attempts to exhaust now would be futile because petitioner \nhas already made the one request for leave to appeal to which she is entitled”). \n3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34   Filed 05/03/20   Page 6 of 27\n \nCourt should not require these at-risk plaintiffs to exhaust remedies before seeking federal habeas \nrelief under § 2241. \nThere are three additional reasons why the Court should accept jurisdiction, and not dismiss \nthe § 2241 Petition for failure to exhaust.  First, the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses face \nirreparable harm if they do not get immediate relief.  Second, it would be futile for the Medically \nVulnerable Subclasses to seek relief from Connecticut state courts that are not operating at full \ncapacity during the pandemic, and therefore cannot provide expedient relief.  Third, it also would \nbe futile to seek relief from Connecticut state courts that are not currently giving “prompt \nattention” to habeas requests.     \n1.  The Court Should Accept Jurisdiction over This § 2241 Petition Without \nRequiring Exhaustion, Because the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses Are \nLikely to Suffer Irreparable Injury without Immediate Judicial Relief.  \nThe Court may accept jurisdiction without requiring exhaustion of state and administrative \nremedies “when (1) available remedies provide no genuine opportunity for adequate relief; (2) \nirreparable injury may occur without immediate judicial relief; (3) administrative appeal would be \nfutile; and (4) in certain circumstances a plaintiff has raised a substantial constitutional question.”  \nBeharry, 329 F.3d at 62; see also Duckworth v. Serrano, 454 U.S. 1, 3 (1981) (no exhaustion if \nstate corrective process “is so clearly deficient as to render futile any effort to obtain relief”); Gates \nv. Henderson, 568 F.2d 830, 840 (2d Cir. 1977) (“It may further be that even where the state \nprovides the process but in fact the defendant is precluded from utilizing it by reason of an \nunconscionable breakdown in that process, the federal intrusion may still be warranted.”).    \nDefendants assume that that this Court will apply § 2254’s exhaustion requirements, \nspending at least two and a half pages on Plaintiffs’ purported failure to exhaust state court \nremedies before summarily waving off potential exceptions to the requirement.  Defendants barely \nacknowledge, let alone appreciate, that human lives are at stake and, in fact, this case falls squarely \n4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34   Filed 05/03/20   Page 7 of 27\n \nwithin at least two related exceptions:  Plaintiffs likely will suffer an irreparable injury without \nimmediate judicial relief, and it would be futile to seek state relief.  Beharry, 329 F.3d at 62.    \nExhaustion  is  considered  futile  where  the  petitioner  “must  choose  one  of  several  intricate \nprocedures with little guidance as to which is the appropriate remedy . . . or when there has been \ninordinate delay between petitioner’s application for state relief and the final disposition thereof.” \nHarvard Law Review Ass’n, Developments in the Law—Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv. L. Rev. \n1038, 1098 (1970); see also Turner v. Bagley, 410 F.3d 718, 725 (6th Cir. 2005) (“A habeas \npetitioner . . . who makes ‘frequent but unavailing requests to have his appeal processed’ in state \ncourt is ‘not required to take further futile steps in state court in order to be heard in federal court,’ \neven if the state court subsequently decides his appeal.” (quoting Simmons v. Reynolds, 898 F.2d \n865, 867-68 (2d Cir. 1990)).  Particularly in the case of a fast-moving pathogen, “delay may geld \nstate procedures so as to render the exhaustion requirement meaningless.”  Shelton v. Heard, 696 \nF.2d 1127, 1128 (5th Cir. 1983).2 \nIt is beyond dispute that irreparable injury will occur without immediate judicial relief.  As \nPlaintiffs set forth in detail in their Complaint and Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, the \nCOVID-19 pandemic is the biggest public health crisis of our time.  The virus is so deadly and \nspreads so rapidly that each day matters, particularly for the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses.  \nWithout immediate relief, Plaintiffs could contract the virus and, within days, suffer severe \nphysical injury, illness, or even death, harm that certainly would be irreparable.  COVID-19 is \nexactly the kind of scenario for which this exception exists, and any exhaustion requirement should \n \n2 Courts reviewing § 2241 petitions have employed this logic when considering administrative remedies, \nas well. See United States v. Basciano, 369 F. Supp. 2d 344, 348 (E.D.N.Y. 2005) (excusing failure to \nexhuast for a § 2241 petition brought by a prisoner held in a special housing unit, and noting that “the court \nmay excuse exhaustion if it appears that an administrative appeal would be futile, or because the appeals \nprocess is shown to be inadequate to prevent irreparable harm to the defendant”). \n5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34   Filed 05/03/20   Page 8 of 27\n \nbe excused.  See e.g., Granberry v. Greer, 481 U.S. 129, 134 (1987) (acknowledging that courts \nmay dispense with exhaustion in “rare cases where exceptional circumstances of peculiar urgency \nare shown to exist” (quoting Ex Parte Hawk, 321 U.S. 114, 117 (1944)); Atkins v. Michigan, 644 \nF.2d 543, 549 (6th Cir. 1981) (describing the right to pretrial release as one that, “if not asserted \nimmediately at the time it is infringed, is irremediably lost”); 2 R. Hertz & J. Liebman, Federal \nHabeas Corpus Practice and Procedure § 23.4[a][ii], 1322-26 (7th ed. 2015) (collecting cases in \nwhich federal courts have consistently found state corrective process to be ineffective when \n“requiring exhaustion would cause irreparable damage to the petitioner’s federal rights,” for \nreasons “including that undue delay in the state courts risks mooting the petitioner’s federal rights \nbefore he reaches the federal courts”).  The Southern District of New York recently applied a \nsimilar  standard  excusing  failure  to  exhaust  administrative  remedies  before  granting \ncompassionate release due to the emergency of COVID-19. See Order at 5, United States v. Perez, \n17-cr-513-3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 1, 2020) [attached as Exhibit 1] (concluding in the case of a prisoner \nwith  serious  chronic  health  conditions  that  “delaying  release  amounts  to  denying  relief \naltogether”).   \n2.  Connecticut’s State Courts are Not Operating at Full Capacity or on a \nConsistently Expedient Schedule and Cannot Provide Relief to Plaintiffs. \nHere, the available state court processes would render the Medically Vulnerable Subclass’ \nrequest for relief moot given the pace at which the virus is raging through DOC facilities and how \nslowly Connecticut courts are operating.  That “the courts are open and are currently hearing and \nprocessing inmate requests for release via a variety of judicial mechanisms” (Mot. at 10) tells only \nhalf the story.   \nOnly  six  courts  across  the  state  are  currently  operating.  \nhttps://jud.ct.gov/HomePDFs/Reduced_Days_Courthouses.pdf.  Their hours are severely reduced: \n6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34   Filed 05/03/20   Page 9 of 27\n \nthey are open only for several hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and are closed on \nTuesdays and Thursdays. https://jud.ct.gov/HomePDFs/Reduced_Days_Courthouses.pdf. \nThere are no longer any criminal hearings other than arraignments, Connecticut Judiciary, \nCOVID-19 Information from the Connecticut Judicial Branch (Mar. 12, 2020) (explaining that the \nsole criminal business to be transacted by the courts will be “[c]riminal arraignments of defendants \nheld in lieu of bond and all arraignments involving domestic violence cases”), and all hearing dates \nfor criminal cases in which the defendant is incarcerated have been continued en masse from when \nthe pandemic began in March to the end of May or beginning of June.  Email from Ralph Dagostine \nto  Chris  Rapillo,  Chief  Public  Defender  (Apr.  23,  2020)  [attached  as  Exhibit  2].    Under \nConnecticut law, modifications for sentences three years and over are heard only if a state’s \nattorney agrees.  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 53a-39(b).  But sentence modification hearings simply are not \nhappening during this pandemic.  For example, Aaron Romano, a criminal defense attorney Courts \nhave  flatly  refused  to  hear  motions  for  sentence  modification,  even  emergency  ones.  See \nDeclaration of Aaron Romano at ¶¶ 5-6 (May 3, 2020) [attached as Exhibit 3] (including e-mail \nfrom court stating).  Mr. Romano represents an immunocompromised inmate with asthma and \nreports that on April 28 he filed a motion for sentence modification due to the pandemic.  The \ncourt responded that the motion would not be heard “until courts open up for regular business” \nbecause sentence modifications “are not priority 1 matters.”  Declaration of Aaron J. Romano, \nEsq., at ¶¶ 5-6. This is but one example of a court system that is largely shut down due to the \npandemic.  The state courts simply cannot give Plaintiffs and the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses \nthe expeditious review needed right now, when time is of the essence.   \n \n \n7 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34   Filed 05/03/20   Page 10 of 27\n \n3.  Connecticut Courts Are Not Providing “Prompt Attention” to Habeas \nPetitions. \nDefendants grossly overstate the ability or appetite of the Connecticut state courts to \nprovide “exceedingly prompt attention to emergency motions, including but not limited to, habeas \npetitions and emergency motions seeking release or, in criminal matters, emergency reductions in \nbond, and requests for PTA’s, due to COVID-19.”  (Mot. at 11.)   \nEven before the COVID-19 pandemic, Connecticut’s habeas courts were an inefficient \nmechanism of relief for incarcerated people.  To address this problem, and at the urging of the \nAttorney General’s office, the Connecticut General Assembly established a task force to “Promote \nEfficiencies in the Filing of Habeas Corpus Matters” in June 2018.3  In July 2019, there were 1,472 \npending habeas cases in the state; 48% of those cases had been pending for over two years.4  \nConditions of confinement petitions take, on average, three years to get to trial.5  Medical concerns \ncomprise 68.7% of the pending habeas cases on conditions of confinement. 6  With a three-year \nwait for habeas petitions to be disposed of before the pandemic, there is no reason to believe that \n \n3 See also 2018 Conn. Acts. 18 (Spec. Sess.); see also Conn. Gen.

Petitions generally are placed in two groups: post-conviction relief, \nand conditions of confinement.  \n4  See  State  of  Conn.

Defendants highlight three \nhabeas petitions docketed on April 29, 2020 as supposed proof that the state courts are open and \ncan provide swift relief.  (Mot. at 11 n.12.)  Defendants fail to mention, however, that these three \npetitions are the only habeas petitions opened in the entire state of Connecticut since March 12, \n2020—i.e., since the pandemic began. See Declaration of Elizabeth Dolbeare (attached as Exhibit \n4) (attesting, as of April 23, 2020, that no new habeas petitions had been docketed in the state of \nConnecticut).7  This is notwithstanding the fact that, for the past ten years, the habeas court has \nopened an average of 50-60 new cases per month,8 and there currently is a substantial “volume” \nof mail arriving at the Hartford courthouse, where habeas cases are now forwarded.  See e-mail \nexchange with Habeas Clerk Kathryn Stackpole (attached as Exhibit 5).9  \nMoreover, the three petitions were filed weeks before they were docketed, and it will be \nmore weeks until they are decided.  Boyd filed his petition on April 15, Murphy filed his on April \n13, and Nunn filed a petition April 9.  See Dockets (Defs’ Mot. Ex. I).  In all three cases, Judge \nBhatt has set a deadline of May 13 for respondents simply to file a responsive pleading—\napproximately one month after each petition was filed. This hardly qualifies as “exceedingly \n \n7 All three were also docketed on a single day, April 29, notably after Plaintiffs filed their Complaint (April \n20) and Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (April 24).     \n8See \nhttps://www.cga.ct.gov/jud/tfs/20190729_Habeas%20Corpus%20Matters%20Task%20Force/20190717/\nHabeas%20Case%20Analysis-Judicial%20Branch%20Statistics%20&%20Performance%20Mgmt.pdf \n(dividing average of new cases per year—679—by 12 months) \n9 It is unsurprising that only three habeas cases have been docketed in the past month and a half, given that \nthe closure of the state court system means the process now involves: mailing a petition to the (closed) \nRockvillle courthouse; having it forwarded from Rockville to Hartford, again via mail, at which point a \nclerk will review it on a Wednesday or Friday between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. and then—assuming it has been \nmarked on the envelope as an “emergency”—a judge may review it to determine whether a hearing should \nbe held. See Defs.’ Mot. Ex. C; E-mail exchanged with Kathryn Stackpole (Exhibit 5). \n9 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34   Filed 05/03/20   Page 12 of 27\n \nprompt attention” under any standard.   \nIn addition to the three habeas cases docketed in nearly two months, Defendants identified \none emergency motion for release (Grimes) that has been docketed on an existing habeas case.10   \nOnce again, the facts of this emergency motion undercut Defendants’ argument.  The petitioner, \nwho had a habeas petition pending since January, filed a “motion for immediate release” on \nmedical grounds on April 14.  Defendants filed an objection to his motion on April 23; as of today, \nthe court has taken no action on this emergency motion in spite of the fact that DOC has assigned \nhim a medical acuity level of 4 (out of 5) and admitted that he has a condition that puts him at risk \nfor serious complications should he contract COVID-19.  Id.  This, too, fails to establish that the \nstate courts are acting quickly enough to spare the most vulnerable.   \nDefendants also offer the cases of Daniel Greer and Robert Day as proof that the state \ncourts are actively providing relief in light of COVID-19.  (Mot. at 11.)  But these cases are the \nobvious—and only—exceptions, not the norm.11  Mr. Day, who has multiple medical conditions \nthat would put him at risk of severe illness from COVID-19, first filed a habeas petition in July \n2017.  See Declaration of Andrew O’Shea, Apr. 16, 2020, attached hereto as Exhibit 6.  Beginning \nin early April 2020, Mr. Day’s attorney made multiple attempts to obtain relief for his client in \nlight of his health status and the fact that the chief physician at his DOC facility was himself \nadamant that Mr. Day be released.  See Exhibit 7, Petition for Bond Pending Habeas. Yet his \nemergency motion for bond pending habeas, filed April 13, was denied for failure to demonstrate \nlikelihood of prevailing on the underlying habeas claim. See Defs.’ Mot. Ex. E.  Mr. Greer’s \n \n10  See  Grimes  v.  Commissioner,  Dkt.  No.  TSR-CV20-5000478-S \nhttp://civilinquiry.jud.ct.gov/CaseDetail/PublicCaseDetail.aspx?DocketNo=TSRCV205000478S. \nPlaintiffs’ counsel have not identified any others, aside from Mr. Day’s (technically a motion for bond \npending habeas).  \n11 Again, Plaintiffs’ counsel have identified no other such cases.  \n10 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34   Filed 05/03/20   Page 13 of 27\n \ncounsel similarly had represented him zealously for months, making the first of three motions to \nsecure bond pending appeal in December 2019.  His case had reached the Appellate Court by the \ntime the pandemic began, which ultimately remanded to the Superior Court.  It is telling that these \nare the only examples of medically vulnerable sentenced prisoners obtaining a release-related \nhearing in state court since the COVID-19 crisis began. See also Declaration of Darcy McGraw, \nMay 3, 2020 (Exhibit 14).  \nAs with the above examples, the facts relating to the state court mandamus action in \nCCDLA v. Lamont only highlight the grave difficulty Plaintiffs and the Class Members face in any \n“emergency” proceeding in the state court system.  Defendants stress that the court took only 21 \ndays to make its initial—jurisdictional—ruling.  Yet each day is a lifetime in COVID-19 terms: \non April 3, the day the state action was filed, 8 people incarcerated in DOC facilities and 16 staff \nmembers had been confirmed positive for COVID-19.  See State Court Complaint, Exhibit 8. By \nthe time the state court reached its decision, those numbers had risen to 338 confirmed positive \nincarcerated people (one of whom had died) and 256 positive staff members.12  As of May 1, those \nnumbers are 443 incarcerated people, 335 staff, and 3 deaths.13  \nFar from painting a portrait of a robust, functioning court system willing and able to pay \n“prompt attention” to medically vulnerable prisoners’ urgent pleas for release, the evidence \nDefendants offer demonstrates the opposite. It remains virtually impossible for incarcerated \npeople—particularly those who do not have already engaged, active lawyers on their longstanding \ncases, and even those who do—to obtain relief in state court.  With state court exhaustion futile \n \n12 See Connecticut State Department of Correction, Health Information and Advisories: Coronavirus \nInformation, available at https://cutt.ly/xyr57np (as accessed Apr. 25, 2020). \n13 See Connecticut State Department of Correction, Health Information and Advisories: Coronavirus \nInformation, available at https://cutt.ly/xyr57np (as accessed May 1, 2020). \n11 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34   Filed 05/03/20   Page 14 of 27\n \nand time of the essence, this Court can, and should, consider Plaintiffs’ claims for relief under \n§ 2241.14   \nC.  This Court Has Jurisdiction Over the Pre-adjudication Medically Vulnerable \nSubclass’ Claims Under § 2241 Because Exhaustion Is Not Required. \nSimilar to the Post-adjudication Class, this Court has jurisdiction over the Pre-adjudication \nMedically Vulnerable Subclass’ claims because the prudential exhaustion requirement under \n§ 2241 is discretionary and subject to the same exceptions.  Defendants again simply say that the \npretrial detainees have not initiated proceedings and therefore this Court should not hear these \nclaims, but these arguments fail for the reasons discussed above.  It is not possible for the \nMedically Vulnerable Pre-adjudication Subclass to get expedient state-court relief when those \ncourts are for all intents and purposes shut down and not prioritizing bail reduction or habeas \nhearings.    \n  Defendants’ assertion that Plaintiffs ignored the bond reduction process—and should thus \nbe precluded from bringing a habeas action—is misguided.  First, a motion for bond reduction \ndoes not provide a litigant the opportunity to demand improved jail conditions or to seek release \non behalf of those most likely to face serious illness under the COVID-19 threat.  \n  Second, bond modifications are proceeding in a haphazard fashion.  Although the CSSD is \nmaking efforts to identify those incarcerated on bond who might be appropriate for relief, the \nprimarily paper system employed by state’s attorneys, and the widespread closures of courthouses \nin which files are held, have meant that standard mechanisms for moving things through are simply \n \n14  Defendants  include  substantial argument about  the  compassionate release mechanism  for  federal \nprisoners pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582 as amended by the First Step Act (Mot. at 12-13), which contains \nan exhaustion requirement.  Because Plaintiffs do not seek relief under § 3582, cases Defendants cite do \nnot apply here. Nonetheless, courts in this District have waived the exhaustion requirements under that \nstatute. U.S. v. Peters, No. 3:18-CR-188, 2020 WL 2092617 (D. Conn. May 1, 2020) (noting that \n“[n]umerous courts within the Second Circuit, however, have waived the exhaustion requirement during \nthe COVID-19 pandemic,” doing so, and collecting cases). \n12 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34   Filed 05/03/20   Page 15 of 27\n \ninoperable.  See E-mail from Chief State’s Attorney Rich Colangelo (Apr. 24, 2020), attached as \nExhibit 9 (laying out multi-step process to attempt to discuss criminal cases, including for those \ncurrently detained, necessitating requests to supervisor retrieve files from closed courthouses, \nassignment of state’s attorney, and parking lot transfer of file to assigned attorney, all before \nconversations can occur between defense counsel and prosecutors; further explaining that “[p]lease \nunderstand that with closed courts it will take time to get the files.”)  For pretrial detainees, nearly \nany delay by the state systems to hear their constitutional claims renders those proceedings \ninadequate, because of the inherent transitory nature of pretrial detention, in so far as “the length \nof pretrial custody cannot be ascertained at the outset” and may end before the petitioner can \nvindicate the right to pretrial release in state court. Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 111 n.11 \n(1975).  Delays in this context also cause irreparable harm, both to an individual’s ability to defend \nagainst the charges and to the individual’s safety. \n   Finally, members of the Pre-adjudication Class subject to parole or special parole holds are \nineligible for release via a bond reduction under Connecticut law. See Liistro v. Robinson, 365 \nA.2d 109, 115 (Conn. 1976) (no right to bail while awaiting parole revocation hearing).  Since the \npandemic began, parole revocation hearings are not happening, at all.  See Declaration of Elisa \nVilla, attached as Exhibit 10.  Class members in this situation are in indefinite custody and have \nno means of obtaining relief.  \nII.  THIS COURT HAS JURISDICTION OVER PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS UNDER \nTHE PLRA. \nA.  Exhaustion Is an Affirmative Defense.  \n  The Supreme Court is clear that under the PLRA, courts must “regard exhaustion as an \naffirmative defense,” not a jurisdictional pleading requirement.  Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 212 \n(2007) (“The PLRA itself is not a source of a prisoner’s claim; claims covered by the PLRA are \n13 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34   Filed 05/03/20   Page 16 of 27\n \ntypically brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which does not require exhaustion at all . . . This is \nstrong evidence that the usual practice should be followed, and the usual practice under the Federal \nRules is to regard exhaustion as an affirmative defense.”) (citing Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., \n457 U.S. 496, 516 (1982)).15 At least one court has issued a preliminary injunction in the COVID-\n19 prison context absent a decision on exhaustion because “there is both a factual dispute regarding \nwhether and to what extent grievance forms were available to inmates to voice their concerns about \nCOVID-19 at [the jail] and a legal dispute regarding whether this type of administrative exhaustion \nmay be considered ‘unavailable’ because of exigent circumstances.”  Swain v. Junior, No. 1:20-\nCV-21457-KMW, 2020 WL 2078580, at *13 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 29, 2020).  Such  an  order  is \ndoubly appropriate given that “the PLRA contains nothing expressly foreclosing courts from \nexercising their traditional equitable power to issue injunctions to prevent irreparable injury \npending exhaustion of administrative remedies.”  Jackson v. District of Columbia, 254 F.3d 262, \n267–68 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (emphasis added).  In Jackson, the D.C. Circuit acknowledged that the \nPLRA does not contain a textual exemption to exhaustion—except, as confirmed by Ross v. Blake, \nwhen it is “unavailable,” and thus does not apply—but explained that “the court had inherent power \nto protect the prisoners while they exhausted prison grievance procedures,” Jackson, 254 F.3d at \n268, and the district court whose actions it reviewed had properly done so.   \nB.  Plaintiffs Have Attempted to File Grievances.16  \n \n15 In expedited briefing in response to Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order, Defendants have \nasked that their opposition be styled as a motion to dismiss, though it is not clear that the Court granted \nthem leave to do so, nor intended procedurally to decide such a motion prior to a decision on Plaintiffs’ \nmotion for a temporary restraining order.  It is also unclear whether Defendants intend to seek to raise \nfurther Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) arguments.  \n16 For purposes of a putative class action, a single plaintiff’s allegation regarding exhaustion “satisfies the \nrequirement as to all members.” Barfield v. Cook, No. 3:18-CV-1198 (MPS), 2019 WL 3562021, at *8 (D. \nConn. Aug. 6, 2019).  \n14 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34   Filed 05/03/20   Page 17 of 27\n \n  Plaintiff Roe attempted to file a grievance regarding the circumstances that led to his \ninfection with COVID-19 and subsequent custody, but was told there were no forms available and \n“we don’t do those” here. Declaration of Mr. Roe ¶ X (Exhibit 11). Courts in this Circuit have \nfound  these  circumstances  sufficient  to  support  a  claim  that  the  grievance  procedure  was \nunavailable. See Smith v. City of New York, 2013 WL 5434144, *14-16 (S.D.N.Y., Sept. 26, 2013) \n(holding evidence prisoner was told by prison staff, “We are not able to deal with this,” and to \n“Wait  it  out.  See  what  comes.  Calm  down,”  supported  claim  that  grievance  process  was \nunavailable); see also Scott v. Westchester Cty., No. 18 CV 7203, 2020 WL 364251, at *5 \n(S.D.N.Y.  Jan.  22,  2020)  (allegations  that  plaintiff  “repeatedly  requested  assistance  writing \na grievance but was either ignored or told someone would help him” “plausibly suggest prison \nadministrators thwarted plaintiff from taking advantage of the grievance system”). \n  Plaintiff Doe represented to undersigned counsel that he has filed an initial grievance,17 but \nDefendants represent that they do not have a record of it. See Defs.’ Motion at Ex. D. In this \ninstance, too, courts have found grievance procedure unavailable. See, e.g., Carter v. Revine, No. \n3:14-CV-01553, 2017 WL 2111594, at *12 (D. Conn. May 15, 2017) (“The Court cannot render \nsummary judgment for the Defendants on the basis of their contention that Carter did not \nfile grievances when Carter claims that he did,” and finding testimony “sufficient for the Court to \nconclude that it was practically impossible to pursue his grievance”); Terry v. Hulse, No. 16-CV-\n252 (KMK), 2018 WL 4682784, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2018) (finding that where plaintiff \nsubmitted grievances but officials had no record, grievance procedure was “unavailable,” and \ncollecting cases); see also A.T. by & through Tillman v. Harder, 298 F. Supp. 3d 391, 410 \n(N.D.N.Y. 2018) (holding that where requests to grievance officer  to  initiate process went \n \n17 Given the expedited briefing schedule, Plaintiffs were unable to have Mr. Doe sign a declaration to this \nend in time for this filing, but will do so as soon as possible.  \n15 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34   Filed 05/03/20   Page 18 of 27\n \nunanswered, exhaustion defense was insufficient to defeat class certification).  “Because prisoners \nare not required to plead compliance with prison grievance procedures in their complaints, courts \nin this Circuit have denied motions to dismiss based on exhaustion where ambiguity exists as to \nwhether a plaintiff exhausted his administrative remedies.”  Huggins v. Schriro, No. 14 CV 6468, \n2015 WL 7345750, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 19, 2015), report and recommendation adopted, No. 14 \nCV 06468, 2016 WL 680822 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 18, 2016) (“Where a prisoner indicates that he has \ntaken some steps toward exhaustion, district courts will normally not infer from his silence that he \nfailed to take the remaining steps that full exhaustion would require.”). \nC.  When No Remedy Is Available, There Is Nothing to Exhaust.  \n  Most importantly for the present context, the Supreme Court has been clear that the PLRA \ndoes not demand exhaustion where no remedy can be achieved.  See Ross v. Blake, 136 S. Ct. \n1850, 1850 (2016) (A remedy is considered unavailable if administrative processes are not \n“‘capable of use’ to obtain ‘some relief for the action complained of.’”) (citing Booth v. Churner, \n532 U.S. 731, 738 (2001)). This reasoning aligns with the Second Circuit’s pre-Ross reasoning in \nAbney v. McGinnis, 380 F.3d 663 (2d Cir. 2004), in which it explained that the PLRA requires \nexhaustion of only those remedies that are “available” to a person, that is, that afford the possibility \nof some relief for the action of which the individual complains.  Abney, 380 F.3d at 667. \n  In Ross, the Court held that the statutory text and history of the PLRA’s exhaustion \nrequirement  foreclose  “special  circumstances”  exceptions  to  the  exhaustion  requirement.18 \nHowever, as the Ross court explained, “the PLRA contains its own, textual exception to mandatory \nexhaustion”: an individual “must exhaust available remedies, but need not exhaust unavailable \n \n18 The particular “special circumstances” examined by the Supreme Court in Ross did not involve timing, \nbut rather whether a person who “reasonably, even though mistakenly, believed he had sufficiently \nexhausted his remedies.” 136 S. Ct. at 1853.  \n16 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34   Filed 05/03/20   Page 19 of 27\n \nones.”  Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1859.  The court then provided three examples of “circumstances in \nwhich an administrative remedy, although officially on the books, is not capable of use to obtain \nrelief.”  Id.  First, an administrative remedy may be unavailable when “it operates as a simple dead \nend—with  officers  unable  or  consistently  unwilling  to  provide  any  relief  to  aggrieved \ninmates.”   Id.   This  is  because  “some  redress  for  a  wrong  is  presupposed  by  the  statute’s \nrequirement of an available remedy; where the relevant administrative procedure lacks authority \nto provide any relief, the inmate has ‘nothing to exhaust.’”  Id. (internal citation omitted).19  \nSecond, “an administrative scheme might be so opaque that it becomes, practically speaking, \nincapable  of  use.”   Id.   And  third,  an  administrative  remedy  may  be  unavailable \n“when prison administrators thwart inmates from taking advantage of a grievance process through \nmachination, misrepresentation, or intimidation.”  Id. at 1860.  The Second Circuit has construed \nthese examples as non-exhaustive. Williams v. Correction Officer Priatno, 829 F.3d 118, 123–24 \n(2d Cir. 2016) (finding that exhaustion was “unavailable”). \n  Unlike some other correctional systems, Connecticut’s DOC does not have an emergency \ngrievance procedure.20  Cf. Thornton v. Snyder, 428 F.3d 690, 694 (7th Cir. 2005) (explaining that \nsomeone in custody of Illinois Department of Corrections “can request that a grievance be handled \non an emergency basis by submitting the grievance directly to the warden,” and if it involves \n“substantial risk of imminent personal injury or other serious or irreparable harm, the grievance is \nto be handled on an emergency basis”) (citing 20 Ill. Admin. Code § 504.840).   \nUnsurprisingly, Connecticut’s grievance procedure also does not anticipate the full-out \n \n19 Defendants argue that “futility of the remedy is not an excuse for failing to exhaust.”  But this is distinct \nfrom when a remedy is unavailable—in that case, there is no need for an excuse; rather, there is nothing to \nexhaust.  \n20 Previous iterations of the policy appear to have had one. E.g., Melendez v. Gomez, No. 3:06CV964 \n(WWE), 2010 WL 3034292, at *2 (D. Conn. July 28, 2010) (discussing emergency exception in AD 9.6).  \n17 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34   Filed 05/03/20   Page 20 of 27\n \ncrisis scenario of a global pandemic, and its mandated timelines are thoroughly unsuited for this \ncontext. Exhausting the grievance process in Connecticut takes a minimum of 75 business days, \nand up to 105 business days for a grievance that “challenges Department level policy.” Conn. \nDep’t of Correction Administrative Directive (“AD”) 9.6(6)(L) (attached as  Ex. 15). First, before \neven filing a grievance, a person must attempt informal resolution of the matter. AD 9.6(6)(A). \nThis includes filing an Inmate Request Form and waiting 15 business days for a response.  Id.; see \nalso AD 9.6(6)(C) (a person must attach the response to the next step of the process, or explain \nwhy it is not attached).  The next step is to file a Level 1 grievance on a designated form.  Id.  DOC \nstaff have 30 business days to respond before a person may appeal by filing a Level 2 grievance.  \nAD 9.6(6)(I).  Once the person files a Level 2 grievance, DOC staff have another 30 business days \nto respond before a person may appeal.  Id.  And if a person does not receive a Level 2 response \nin 30 business days, or if the decision challenges a departmental policy,21 another 30-business-day \nperiod will elapse before DOC must respond and the grievance procedure is completed. AD \n9.6.(6)(L).  Even if a person never receives a response from DOC, a person may not appeal to the \nnext grievance “level” unless the requisite time period has elapsed.22  \n  Assuming even a 60-business-day turnaround, in order to have exhausted this procedure as \nof today, Plaintiffs would have had to file their initial grievance on February 24—two weeks before \nthe  first  case  of  coronavirus  was  reported  in  Connecticut.23    Assuming  a  90-business-day \n \n21 This phrase is neither elaborated upon nor defined in the Administrative Directives.  \n22 This is notable given that at least one litigant in this Court has alleged that DOC was “flooded with \nrequests and grievances concerning COVID-19” and was thus told by his warden that “it might be a while” \nfor an answer to his grievance. Rogers v. Lamont, 3:20-cv-00474-JCH, Complaint, ECF No. 1 (April 8, \n2020).  \n23 Office of Gov. Ned Lamont, Press Release: Governor Lamont Announces First Positive Case of Novel \nCoronavirus  Involving  a  Connecticut  Resident,  Mar.  8,  2020,  https://portal.ct.gov/Office-of-the-\nGovernor/News/Press-Releases/2020/03-2020/Governor-Lamont-Announces-First-Positive-Case-of-\nNovel-Coronavirus-Involving-a-Connecticut-Resident.  \n18 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34   Filed 05/03/20   Page 21 of 27\n \nturnaround, Plaintiffs would have had to file their initial grievance on January 13, before the first \ncase was reported in the United States.24  And waiting the full 105 days would require an initial \ngrievance filed in December, before the first cases of coronavirus were confirmed in Wuhan, \nChina.  The absurdity of these dates underlines the unavailability of the grievance procedure in the \ncontext of a pandemic, and the fact that taking the time to exhaust administrative procedures \nrenders any remedy moot.  Not only are administrative procedures unable to offer the only effective \nrelief, but attempting to navigate them would take months in a pandemic where people can die \nwithin days of exposure to the virus.  Therefore, the administrative procedures in place are dead \nends and not “available” to Plaintiffs within the meaning of the PLRA.  See Ross, 136 S. Ct at \n1858. \n  Availability can encompass the present context. “If a prisoner has been placed in imminent \ndanger of serious physical injury by an act that violates his constitutional rights, administrative \nremedies that offer no possible relief in time to prevent the imminent danger from becoming an \nactual harm can’t be thought available.”  Fletcher v. Menard Correctional Center, 623 F.3d 1171, \n1173 (7th Cir. 2010).  Put another way: “If it takes two weeks to exhaust a complaint that the \ncomplainant is in danger of being killed tomorrow, there is no ‘possibility of some relief’ and so \nnothing for the prisoner to exhaust.”  Id.  See also Laboy v. Semple, 3:19-cv-307-JCH, Ruling on \nMotion for Summary Judgment, ECF. No. 55 (Dec. 5, 2019) [attached as Exhibit 12] (holding that, \nafter the plaintiff gave birth, there was “no remedy within the power of the jail to grant” regarding \nthe conditions of her prenatal care, and thus, section 1997e’s exhaustion requirement did not \napply).  \n \n24 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Press Release: First Travel-related Case of 2019 Novel \nCoronavirus Detected in United States, Jan. 21, 2020, https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0121-\nnovel-coronavirus-travel-case.html.  \n19 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34   Filed 05/03/20   Page 22 of 27\n \n  Finally, and in the alternative, if Plaintiffs’ complaint is construed—as it appears to be by \nDefendants—to primarily seek release, it is outside the purview of the grievance system altogether. \nThe grievance system can receive requests directed “to any aspect of an inmate’s confinement,” \nAD 9.6(1) (emphasis added), but does not purport to address the very fact thereof.  If the grievance \nprocess has no authority to release people from prison, and if there is no meaningful relief that can \nbe granted to the medically vulnerable subclasses in the present crisis short of release, cf. Booth, \n532 U.S. at 731, then there is no “available” remedy. See also Handberry v. Thompson, 92 \nF.Supp.2d 244, 247 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (holding that prisoners need not grieve failure to deliver \neducational services because the issues were out of Department of Correction’s control), aff’d in \npart, vacated in part, and remanded on other grounds, 446 F.3d 335 (2d Cir. 2006).   \nIII.  YOUNGER ABSTENTION IS IRRELEVANT BECAUSE THE CLASSES DO \nNOT SEEK TO ENJOIN ANY STATE PROCEEDING. \n  Lastly, the Defendants cite Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), and ask this Court to \nstay its hand in favor of a state litigation being pursued against them, even though they successfully \nconvinced the state court that it lacked jurisdiction over that case;25 they also intimate that this \naction would intrude on pending criminal proceedings.  However, Cook and Lamont make their \ngambit without the sine qua non of Younger abstention: a federal plaintiff seeking to enjoin a state \nproceeding.  Their motion must be denied. \n  “The doctrine established by Younger v. Harris and its successors forbids federal courts \nfrom enjoining ongoing state proceedings,” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino, 380 F.3d 83, 100 \n(2d Cir. 2004) (emphasis added).  Accord Kirschner v. Klemons, 225 F.3d 227, 238 (2d Cir. 2000) \n(describing “unacceptable interference with the ongoing state proceeding” as “the evil against \n \n25 See Order on Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, Connecticut Criminal Defense Lawyers’ Ass’n v. Lamont, \nNo. UWY-CV-20-6054309-S (Conn. Super. Ct.

Younger is “inapplicable” to a parallel litigation in which the \nfederal plaintiff “has not asked that any state proceeding be enjoined.”  Williams v. Lambert, 46 \nF.3d 1275, 1282 (2d Cir. 1995) (vacating Younger stay).  As a matter of practicality, a ruling from \nthis Court may preempt a pending state court action by having preclusive effect upon it.  But \n“[a]bstention is not in order simply because a pending state-court proceeding involves the same \nsubject matter.”  Sprint Communications v. Jacobs, 571 U.S. 69, 72 (2013).  Accord Lambert, 46 \nF.3d at 1282 (explaining that the possibility of preclusion arising during parallel litigation “does \nnot present the issues of state and federal comity with which Younger is concerned”). \nPlaintiffs have not asked this Court to enjoin any ongoing state proceeding.  See Complaint \n¶ 91.  They have asked only that the Court enjoin certain acts of the Defendants, as well as to \ndeclare that Defendants’ acts violate the Constitution.  Id.  That ends the Younger analysis.26 \nDefendants do not address the absence of a request by the Classes for an injunction against \na state proceeding, but cite outdated precedent to suggest a broader reach of Younger than now \nexists.  In 2013, the Supreme Court pared the doctrine back to “three exceptional categories . . . \ndefin[ing] Younger’s scope”: those in which the requested federal injunction would intrude on \neither (1) “ongoing state criminal prosecutions,” (2) “certain civil enforcement proceedings . . . \n \n26   See Omar v. 1 Front St. Grimaldi, Inc., No. 16-cv-5824, 2019 WL 1322614, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 8, \n2019) (declining to apply Younger “because no one is trying to enjoin” the state labor investigation that the \nfederal defendants alleged to be in progress); Helms Realty Corp. v. City of New York, 320 F. Supp. 3d 526, \n538 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (declining to apply Younger to action between parties with pending state litigation \n“[s]ince Plaintiff does not in the federal action seek to enjoin or otherwise supervise the state courts”); \nWilmington Trust v. Estate of McClendon, 287 F. Supp. 3d 353, 363 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (same where \n“[n]othing Plaintiff seeks” would “result in enjoining state proceedings or invalidating a state court order”) \n(internal quotations omitted); Dubin v. Nassau County, 277 F. Supp. 3d 366, 380-81 (E.D.N.Y. 2017) (same \nwhere plaintiffs with pending municipal traffic cases “d[id] not seek to enjoin cases” but asked to bar the \nmunicipality from tacking an additional fee on to dismissed tickets); Lamont v. Farucci, No. 16-cv-7746, \n2017 WL 6502239, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 18, 2017) (same where “Plaintiff is not seeking to enjoin the \nongoing Family Court proceedings” about which he complained); Torres v. DeMatteo Salvage Co., 34 F. \nSupp. 3d 286, 287 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (same where plaintiff brought federal claims but did not seek to enjoin \npending state court action, in which he himself was the plaintiff). \n21 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34   Filed 05/03/20   Page 24 of 27\n \nakin to a criminal prosecution” that have been “initiated to sanction the federal plaintiff,” or (3) \n“pending civil proceedings involving certain orders . . . uniquely in furtherance of the state courts’ \nability to perform their judicial functions.”  Sprint Communications, 571 U.S. at 78-79 (internal \nquotations omitted).27   \nNone of the three types is at issue in this action.  The Classes do not ask this Court to alter \nthe state courts’ civil rules.  And, of course, Defendants Cook and Lamont are the defendants in \nthe state action, which seeks to regulate their behavior, not that of any Class members.  See id. at \n80 (explaining that state civil action initiated by “[a] private corporation” against a state agency \ndid not fall into second Younger category).28 \nNor do the Classes challenge a rule or procedure of the state superior court that led to their \ncurrent predicament such that their request for relief poses the specter of “interruption of state \nproceedings to adjudicate assertions of noncompliance by petitioners” comprising “an ongoing \nfederal audit of state criminal proceedings.”  O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 500 (1974).  But \nO’Shea stands for the proposition that “[o]ngoing, case-by-case oversight of state courts” is to be \n \n27 The court also expressly overruled use of the factors relied upon by the defendants on page 16 of their \nmemo.  “Divorced from their quasi-criminal context,” the court explained, the very considerations put forth \nby the defendants “would extend Younger to virtually all parallel state and federal proceedings, at least \nwhere a party could identify a plausibly important state interest,” which is “irreconcilable with our dominant \ninstruction that . . . abstention from the exercise of federal jurisdiction is the exception, not the rule.”  Sprint, \n571 U.S. at 81-82 (internal quotation omitted). \n28 Beyond the state case not falling into any of the three Younger categories, Cook and Lamont have further \nproblems.  They forfeited their ability to claim that the state action is necessary for them to vindicate “an \nimportant state interest” in that venue, Mot. at 18, because they argued the opposite there.  See Mot. at 1, \nConnecticut Criminal Defense Lawyers’ Ass’n v. Lamont [attached as Exhibit 13] (contending that the \nsuperior  court  “lacks  subject  matter  jurisdiction,”  and  that  the  claims “are non-justiciable  political \nquestions”).  If the state action were vital to their vindicating quasi-criminal state interests, they should not \nhave had it dismissed.  If, on the other hand, the interest they lay claim to is a state court’s lack of jurisdiction \nover their federal constitutional violations, that is not a consideration bearing any significance here.  U.S. \nConst. art. 6, cl. 2; see also Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159-60 (1908) (denying habeas petition of state \nofficial who filed state enforcement action in defiance of federal injunction, and explaining that “[t]he state \nhas no power to impart to him any immunity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the United \nStates.”).  Their arguments in favor of deference to their decision-making go to the merits of the Classes’ \nclaims rather than this Court’s remit to ensure compliance with the national constitution. \n22 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34   Filed 05/03/20   Page 25 of 27\n \navoided, not that executive branch officials’ actions should not be ordered to conform to the \nconstitution.  Disability Rights New York v. New York, 916 F.3d 129, 136 (2d Cir. 2019) (abstaining \nfrom entertaining federal challenges to the New York courts’ guardianship proceedings).  The \nClasses’ challenge to their conditions of confinement does not implicate O’Shea because it does \nnot invite wholesale federal supervision of the state superior court or its orders, and does not \npropose to supplant their judgments of conviction.  Defendants’ protests that sentenced Class \nmembers are subject to a state court order—a “mittimus”—committing them to prison only \nexpresses a truism of Connecticut law: there is only one way to get into a Connecticut prison, “by \ncommitment to the custody of the Commissioner of Correction.”  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 54-92a.  If \nthe Court orders enlargement of their confinement to bail or other alternative measure designed to \nphysically space Class members from one another it will not negate the fact of their having been \nconvicted and committed to the defendants’ custody \nThe Classes’ dispute is with the conditions in which the Defendants are subjecting them to \nthe coronavirus pathogen during the pandemic.  A ruling here in the Classes’ favor would not alter \nthe way that Superior Court judges set bail or try cases in any now-pending or future criminal \ncases.  Instead, it would command the Defendants—none of whom are state judicial officers—to \nallay the unconstitutional conditions in which people incarcerated in their custody currently find \nthemselves.  Worse for the defendants, much of the relief that the Classes seek is not, and was \nnever, within the purview of the superior court’s criminal division.  That forum has no control over \nCOVID-19 prevention efforts in prisons, proper sanitation, or sufficient medical care.  See Compl. \n¶ 91.

Counsel for the State \nSelf-Rep~esented (Pro Se)  Counsel for Petitioner \nPER CURIAM \nSENTENCES AFFIRMED \nBY THE DIVISION \nPetitioner Michael Young was convicted after a jury trial of Assault of Public \nSafety Personnel in violation of§ 53a-167c (exposing him to a maximum of ten years in \njail), Committing a Crime (the felony assault of a police officer) While on Pretrial \nRelease in violation of§ 53a-40b (exposing him to a maximum of ten years in jail), \nInterfering with an Officer in violation of§ 53a..,167a (exposing him to a maximum of one \nyear in jail), and a second count of Committing a Crime (this time, the interfering with an \nofficer) While on Pretrial Release in violation of §53a-40b (exposing him in this instance \nto up to one year in jail).  His total exposure at sentencing was twenty-two years in jail. \n1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-12   Filed 07/07/20   Page 29 of 51\nThe sentencing court (Hon. Hunchu Kwak, J.) imposed a sentence of five years \nin jail followed by five years of special parole as to the assault on an officer; five years to \nserve for committing that crime while on pretrial release; one year to serve for interfering \nwith an officer; and one year to serve for committing that crime while on pretrial release. \nEach sentence was imposed consecutively to one another, for a total effective sentence \nof twelve years in jail followed by five years of special parole (out of the twenty-two \nyears in jail to which the petitioner was exposed). \nThe review division only has the discretion to modify sentences that are \n\"inappropriate or disproportionate in the light of the nature of the offense, the character \nof the offender, the protection of the public interest, and the deterrent, rehabilitative, \nisolative, and denunciatory purposes for which the sentence was intended.\"  Practice \nBook §43-28.  In this case, the sentencing court offered a detailed articulation of each \nsentence that it imposed.  Sentencing Transcript (hereinafter \"Tr.\") at 15 - 21:  Upon \ncareful review of the entire record, including the arguments presented by the parties at \nthe sentence review hearing, and with particular attention to§ 51-196 of the General \nStatutes and§ 43-28 of the Practice Book, the review division determines that the \nsentences should stand; thus, the imposed sentences here~y are AFFIRMED. \n2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-12   Filed 07/07/20   Page 30 of 51\nAC  40801  '(TSR-CV-14-4006214-S) \nMICHA8L  A.YOUNG  S'T'l\\'rE  OF  CONNECTICUT \nv._  APPELATE  COURT \n\\,vl\\RDEN  STArrE  !?RISON  NOVEMBER  \\0,2017 \n/VlOTION  .FOR1'sr11AY1'AND''EMERGENCY11TEMPORARY11STAY11WI'I'H11ORDER11OF  RELEASE \n---------·- -, ·- --------.. ~--------·---·--··- ... -,,•··-··----····--·  -~-·••>,••·---·--····----·---·---···------.-... --\nAs  set forth by11S'l1AY11provisions of C.P.B.§61-13 made\"PROPERLY\"applfoable to\"TJIIS  CASE\" \nby\"ONLAWFUL11crirninal conviction and sentence here pursuant C, P .B.§61-13 (d)  petitii±mer. \"NOW\" \n1 \nexplicitly request11'I'IUS  COURT\"issue''ST/\\Y'.'of  criminal11JUDGMENT'.'and11EMERGE11JCY\"ternporari'STAY'1 \non unexecuted  portion of11ILLEGAL\"sentence,with\"ORDER11of\"RELEASE\"pending\"FINl\\LITY11in above \n\"UlTITLED''matterl ! !

So  -- so,  Mr. \n17  Young,  here's  the  situation.

We  need  to  sort  out,  urn, \n?2  the  status  of  the  other  file  to  which  you  are \n23  currently  self-represented.  So  here,s  what  we're \n24  d,aing.  On  the  file  ending  in  99206,  I'm going  to \n25  have  pro  forma  not  guilty pleas .with  a  jury  election. \n26  Urn,  I  will  have  a  conversation  with Attorney  Channing \n27  about  these  matters  going  forward.  So  I've  entered \nJune  6,  2011 \n\n6 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-5   Filed 07/07/20   Page 6 of 7\n1  another  report.

He  has  filed \n12  some,  uh,  pro  se  motions  to  preserve  evidence. \n13  Spoken  to  the  state.  They've  indicated that  they \n14  already  --\n15  ATTY.

PATTIS:  My  understanding  is  the  state \n26  will  seek  to  prove,  potentially through  a  clerk of \n27  the  court,  that  Mr.  Young  was  on  release  at  the  time \n\n2 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-6   Filed 07/07/20   Page 5 of 34\n1  that  he  engaged  in  the  acts  resulting  in  his \n2  conviction  of  interfering  and  assault  on  a  public \n3  safety or  emergency medical  personnel. \n4  I~~ior draft  o~ the  charge, _the  Court  had \n5  listed the  charges  that  he  was  on  release  from,  and  I \n6 \n_  ___.,....__,.,....-c.. . ,. ........ ..____~.,..,.~\"\" ........ ~~.,_, ...~  ~·. . \"\"~ ........ ...,. .....  ,.,~~~~~---.... ~-~ ...... -----~-:-~~. \n7  because  of  its  danger  for  prejudice  or  its \n8  prejudicial  impact. \n9  The  state  has  handed  me  two  proposed  exhibits \n- ••------..____  _.,_.-•~,...,, --~-_ ....... .,-~----~--.___.., ... ___,,~-,.. -w~-•• \n10  that  would  bri~-toth-;--jury' s  fi1J-nd  those  very \n-....... ._. ______ ,,...,_....,_,,....\"\"\"''\"\"-' . ....., •..~ ........,......_,·=~-...---·\"'\" ..., .,....-=_.,.;<\"' .. \"'''\"'~ -.:<':'='•  -~,.,~-...,..,~.-..----...... __. .. _~ ~ • \n11  charges;  and  so  I'm requesting  that  those  charges \n12  themselves  not  be  identified,  to  wit,  assault  in the \n13  third  degree,  threatening  second  degree,  unlawful \n( \n14  restraint  first  degree,  strangulation  second  degree, \n15  and  breach  of  peace  second  degree. \n16  I  think  it's sufficient  for  this  jury  to  decide \n17  whether  he  was  on  release  from  custody  with  criminal \n18  charges  pending  against  him,  and  that  simple  question \n19  is  the  only  one  that's  really  relevant.  So  I'm \n20  asking  that  the  Court  limit  the  state's proof  to \n21  eliminate  the  naming  of  the  charges  that  he  was  on \n22  release  for. \n23  THE  COURT:  Attorney  Durham. \n24  ATTY.

If \nI \n\\  J4 .'±A   we  don'L  challenge  it,  there'd be  no  reason  to \n15  dispute  it. \n16  We're  not  going  to  argue  that  the  name \n17  Michael  Young  is  so  common,  it must  have  been  some \n18  other Michael  Young;  and  that may  or may  not  address \n19  the  state's  concerns. \n20  THE  COURT:  Okay. \n21  Attorney  Durham,  anything  else? \n22  ATTY.

If that's  the  case,  then  I'm \n25  going  to  exclude  that  information  from  the  jury. \n26  Obviously,  if you  challenge  any  of  the  information, \n27  then  I'm  going  to  have  to  let that  in. \n\n4 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-6   Filed 07/07/20   Page 7 of 34\n1  ATTY.  PATTIS:  Okay.  And,  Judge,  one  -- thank \n2  you,  sir. \n3  One  final  motion,  judge;  Mr.  Young  has  asked  me \n4  to  ask  that  the  Court  enter  judgments  of  acquittal  as \n5  to  the  interfering  charge  and  the  assault  charge  on \n6  the  grounds  that  the  state  failed  to  eliminate \n7  reasonable  doubt  in  the  jury's mind. \n8  Given  its  failure  of proof  as  to  the  assault \n9  charge,  there  were  inconsistencies,  both  in  the \n10  location  of  the  alleged  kick,  the  portion  of  the  body \n11  part  hurt,  whether  there  was  injury,  as  a  matter  of \n12  law,  and  not  to mention  all  of  the  inconsistencies \n13  surrounding  the  arrest  itself. \n14  For  example,  we  never  heard  from  any  officer who \n15  actually  applied  handcuffs  to  Mr.  Young.  This, \n16  compounded  with  the  state's  failure  to  preserve  the \n17  evidence  we  requested,  creates  an  essentially \n18  speculative  portrait  of  the  arrest,  and  as  a  result, \n19  we  think  an  acquittal  should  enter,  similarly with \n20  respect  to  the  interfering charge. \n21  There  was  a  dispute  in  the  testimony  about \n22  whether  Mr.  Young  was  ever  informed he  was  under \n23  arrest  or  whether  he  was  simply  jumped.  If he  was \n24  simply  jumped,  Judge,  he  might  have  had  a  valid \n25  self-defense  claim  as  against  the  people,  as  against \n26  officer~,  even  reasonably  identifiable  officers,  and \n27  some  brief period  of  struggle may  have  been \n\n~  .· \n5 \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-6   Filed 07/07/20   Page 8 of 34\n1  justified. \n2  For  those  reasons,  Judge,  at  Mr.  Young's \n3  request,  I  ask  that  those  charges  -- that ·the  Court \n4  enter  judgments  of  acquittal  as  to  those  charges, \n5  thus  making  moot  the  Part  B  proceeding  in  this  case. \n6  THE  COURT:  Okay. \n7  Attorney  Durham. \n8  ATTY.  DURHAM:  Your  Honor,  I'd ask  that  the \n9  motion  be  denied.  The  state  presented  six  law \n10  enforcement  witnesses,  all who  testified  regarding \n11  the  defendant's  behavior  after he  was  informed  that \n12  he  was  going  to  be  placed  under  arrest;  that  he \n13  refused  to  comply  with  any  orders,  tried to  escape \n( \n14  their  grasp,  made  a  swinging  motion  towards \n~ \n15  Officer  Begley,  had  to  be  taken  down  to  the  ground  by \n16  multiple  officers. \n17  Once  on  the  ground,  again,  consistent  testimony \n18  from  all  of  the  law  enforcement  professionals  on \n19  scene  that  he  refused  to  give  up  his  hands.  He  was \n20  trying  to  hide  them  underneath  his  body,  had  to  be \n21  forcibly  pulled  out  before  he  could be  placed  into \n22  handcuffs  and  into  custody. \nI  don't  believe  it would  be  necessary  for  the \n24  state  to  prove  who  applied  the  handcuffs  in  order  to \n25  establish  the  charge  of  interfering  with  a  police \n( \n>\\   26  officer. \n27  Additionally,  regarding  the  assault  of  a  police \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-6   Filed 07/07/20   Page 9 of 34 6 \n-----··-----~-------------------·-·-------------------\n1  officer,  multiple  law  enforcement  witnesses,  all \n2  testifying to  seeing the  defendant  kick \n3  Trooper  Barrows. \n4  Certainly,  there  is  some  minor  variation  in  the \n5  testimony  as  to  exactly what  they saw.  They  all \n6  testified,  a  very  chaotic  situation.  They  all \n7  testified that  they  saw  the  defendant  kick \n8  Trooper  Barrows.  So  I  would  submit  there  was \n9  sufficient  evidence  for  the  jury to  reach  this \n10  finding. \n11  As  to  counsel's  point  regarding  self-defense,  he \n12  certainly  could  have  attempted  to  bring  such  a \n13  defense,  and  he  didn't.  So  I  don't  know  that  it's \n14  fair  to  speculate  on  any  such  defense  now. \n15  So  I'd ask  that  the  motion  be  denied. \n16  THE  COURT:  Okay.  Thank  you. \n17  Based  on  the  testimony presented during  trial, \n18  the  Court  deems  that  there  was  sufficient  evidence \n19  for  the  jury to  decide  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that \n20  the  defendant,  Mr.  Young,  committed  the  offenses  of \n21  interfering with  an  officer,  as  well  as  an  assault  on \n22  a  public  safety personnel;  therefore,  your  motion  to \n23  dismiss  is  denied. \n24  All  right.  Anything  else? \n25  ATTY.  PATTIS:  Nothing  from  the  defense,  sir. \n26  THE  COURT:  Okay.

In  a \n20  few  moments,  the  Court  will  instruct  regarding  this  offense \n21  for  committing  a  crime  while  out  on  release.  And  there  are \n22  two  elements  that  need  to  be  met.  And,  of  course,  it's the \n23  judge's  instruction that  counts. \n24  But  just  for  the  purpose  of my  argument,  I'll \n25  tell you  the  two  elements.  One  is  that  there  is  a  current \n26  conviction,  that  the-defendant  has  been  convicted  of  a \n27  crime.  And  the  Court· will  tell you  that  the  verdict  that \n\n4 ..  .  . 6. :  '· :  6. : \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-6   Filed 07/07/20   Page 20 of 34\n17 \n1  you  reached  on  Friday  satisfies  this  element. \n2  And  the  second  element  is  that  the  defendant  was \n3  on  release  for  an  arrest  pending  -- and  that  that  case  was \n4  pending  against  him  at  the  time  of  the  new  case. \n5  And  you  just  heard  testimony  from \n6  Trooper  Utermarck  that  he  arrested  the  defendant \n7  January  10,  2011  for  a  separate  incident,  and  in  that  case, \n8  a  bond  was  set. \n9  And  Ms.  Dagostino  testified regarding  that  --\n10  that  bond,  that  the  bond  was  posted  the  following  date;  the \n11  defendant  was  released  from  custody,  and  that  that  case \n12  remained  pending  and  was  pending  on  May  10,  2011,  when  the \n13  defendant  was  again  arrested  by  Trooper  Utermarck. \n14  I  will  submit  to  you  that  that  is  all  the \n15  evidence  that  you  need  to  find  the  defendant  guilty  of  this \n16  charge.  Thank  you. \n17  THE  COURT:  Attorney  Pattis. \n18  CLOSING  ARGUMENT  OF  ATTY.  PATTIS: \n19  Good  morning.  I  guess  you  know  I  lied when  I \n20  said  you  didn't  have  to  hear  from  me  again.  I'll be  brief. \n21  Now  you  know  why  they  threw  the  book  at  Mike  in \n22  this  case,  the  state with  the  seven  charges.  You've \n23  acquitted  him  of  five.  We  hoped  for  an  acquittal  on  all \n24  seven.  We  didn't  get  that.  Thank  you  for  your  hard  work, \n25  nonetheless. \n26  We're  asking  you  to  return  a  not  guilty  verdict \n27  as  to  what's  called the  Part  B  information.  What  happened, \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-6   Filed 07/07/20   Page 21 of 34\n18 \n--~-·-------------------·  ------------------\n1  you  heard,  in  this  case  was  there  was  a  report  of  a \n2  domestic.  You  had  reasons  to  doubt  that  it occurred.  Mike \n3  has  always  pled  not  guilty to  that. \n4  Officers  knew  who  he  was.  You  heard  from  one  of \n5  them  who made  an  arrest  before.  He  says  it was  Mike;  he \n6  arrested  him.  Maybe  it was;  maybe  it wasn't.  I  don't  think \n7  there's  a  whole  lot of  doubt  about  that. \n8  But  you  as  a  jury have  a  right  that has \n9  historically been  the  right  of  jurors:  in this  case,  to \n10  either  accept  or  not  the  jurors'  case. \n11  I  read  this  story about  a  man  named \n12  John  Peter  Zenger.  Before  the  country's  founding,  it used \n13  to  be  a  crime  to  seek  guilt  of  the  government.  Zenger  was \n14  prosecuted  for  that  crime.  He  was  prosecuted,  and  he \n15  admitted  that he  said  those  things.  But  his  lawyer  said, \n16  look;  the  truth  ought  to  be  a  defense  to  this  charge.  And \n17  the  jury acquitted,  even  though  that  was  at  odds  with  the \n18  law. \n19  I'm  asking  you  to  do  the  same'thing here,  to \n20  acquit  even  though  your  verdict  might  arguably  be  at  odds \n21  with  the  law. \n22  The  reason  for  that  is  when  Mike  was  arrested, \n23  he  wanted  the  whole  story  told  to  the  jury.  He  asked  for \n24  tapes  to  be  recorded  so  that  you  could  see  what  happened  to \n25  him  that  night,  and  he  still hasn't  seen  them.  He  never \n26  will  see  them,  and  he  never  will  see  them  because  the  state \n27  police  didn't  keep  them. \n\n4 ..  ... :  ... :  ... : \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-6   Filed 07/07/20   Page 22 of 34\n19 \n1  So  you  heard  part  of  his  story  here,  and  the \n2  story  you  heard  was  tro~bling enough  to  convict  him  on  the \n3  two  counts;  and  we'll  have  to  live  with  the  consequence  of \n4  that. \n5  I'm  forbidden  by  the  law  to  tell you  why  the \n6  state  is  bringing  a  Part  B  information,  but  you  know  it \n7  isn't here  to  help  Mike;  it's here  to  hurt  him.  I  say  he's \n8  been  hurt  enough.  Please  return  a  verdict  of  not  guilty. \n9  THE  COURT:  Attorney  Durham. \n10  REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ATTY.  DURHAM: \n11  Ladies  and  gentlemen,  the  facts  of  the \n12  underlying  case  are  not  at  issue  with  this  charge;  and \n13  contrary to  counsel's  request,  your  duty  as  jurors  is  to \nII   14  follow  the  law,  the  law  as  ~-ulli.e instructs  you,  and  not \n\\ \n~-..----..........---,...,  -~~.,;.,.·::.;:~.,. \n15  take  the  law  into  your  own  hands. \n'--.--.,.,,..,. . ,,,,,,.,.. ........ ~. . ....,___._,__-----·-----...,-M,_~---~-·-· •,,>O'o''' , .. ,o• •'' '·'•'''-'~ '''''''\"••' .,. 0 \n16  The  question before  you  is  a  factual  question  as \n17  to  whether  the  state  presented  evidence  to  show  the \n18  defendant  was  on  release  at  the  time  that  he  committed  the \n19  crime  for  which  you've  convicted  him. \n20  That's  the  only  thing  you  need  to  decide,  and  I \n21  would  ask  you  to  find  that  the  defendant  is  guilty  of \n22  committing  a  crime  while  on  release.  Thank  you. \n23  THE  COURT:  Okay. \n___ \n24  JUROR:  Can  I  ask  a  question?  Am  I  allowed? \n_ \n.....~.  -~~---~ ... .............,  ..._ ___. .....  ...... --·--~· \n25  THE  COURT:  You've  got  to  -- you  have  to  write \n26  down  your  question;  okay. \n27  JUROR:  Okay. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-6   Filed 07/07/20   Page 23 of 34\n20 \n1  But  why  don't  -- I'm  going  to  charge \n2  you  first;  okay? \n3  JUROR:  Okay. \n4  THE  COURT:  And  then  if you  have  a  specific \n5  qu~stion,  the  jury  foreperson  needs  to  write  it down, \n6  very  specific,  with  the  time  and  date,  with  a \n7  signature.  Okay?  All  right. \n8  INSTRUCTIONS  TO  THE  JURY  BY  THE  COURT: \n9  Ladies  and  gentlemen,  if you  recall  from  my  --\n10  last  Friday's  jury  instruction,  that  still applies;  okay. \n11  But  this  applies  specifically to  the  Part  B  information. \n12  In  the  second  part  of  the  information,  the \n13  defendant  has  been  charged  with  committing  a  crime  while  on \n( \n14  release. \n\\ \n15  A  person  is  guilty of  commi t.ting  a  crime  while \n16  on  release  when  he  commits  a  crime  after  he  has  been \n17  released  from  custody  following  an  arrest  and  there  are \n18  criminal  charges  pending  against  him. \n19  For  you  to  find  the  defendant  guilty of  this \n20  charge,  the  state must  prove  the  following  elements  beyond  a \n21  reasonab~~ do..,.ub-t,__,, \"') \n7\n.  \"~fo.v'  n;.~!l)  J-  ~,. \n22  V'i\\.~xc.~(~.y·f~OElement  one,  current  conviction.  The  first \n~t\\ ~ \n23  element  is  that  the  defendant  has  been  convicted  of  a  crime \n24  in  this  case.  The  verdict  you  just rendered  Friday  finding \n25  the  defendant  guilty  of  interfering with  an  officer  and \n26  assault  on  public  safety or  emergency  medical  personnel \n27  satisfies  this  element. \n\ni. :  4. : \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-6   Filed 07/07/20   Page 24 of 34\n21 \n1  Element  two,  on  release.  The  second  element  is \n2  that  at  the  time  the  defendant  committed  the  crime  of \n3  interfering with  an  officer  and  assault  on  public  safety  or \n4  emergency  medical  personnel,  he  was  on  release.  This  means \n5  that  he  had  been  arrested  and  was  released  from  custody, \n6  with  criminal  charges  pending  against  him. \n7  In  summary,  the  state must  prove  beyond  a \n8  reasonable  doubt  that  the  defendant  has  been  convicted  of  a \n9  crime  and  that  he  was  on  release. \n10  You  will  now  return  to  the  deliberations  room  to \n11  consider  this  question.  I  am  sending  in  with  you  a  form  on \n12  which  to  record  your  answer.  Your  decision must  be \n13  unanimous.  Your  foreperson  should  check  the  appropriate \n( \n14  answer  and  sign  and  date  the  form. \n15  Please  refer back  to  and  use  instructions  I \n16  previously  gave  you  on  burden  of  proof,  which  is  on  the \n17  state,  the  presumption  of  innocence  of  the  defendant,  and \n18  reasonable  doubt.  You  are  going  to  get  a  copy  of  this  --\n19  okay  -- so  you  can  refer  back  to  it. \n20  Any  exceptions? \n21  ATTY.  DURHAM:  No,  Your  Honor. \n22  ATTY.  PATTIS:  No,  sir.  I'm  sorry,  sir.  I \n23  apologize. \n24  THE  COURT:  Okay.  Thank  you. \n25  Ail  right.  With  that  -- again,  don't  start \n( \n26  deliberating  until  you  have  the  exhibits  and  all  six \n27  of  you  are  in  the  deliberations  room.  Okay.

Is  that  -- did  you  say \n( \n14  it was  a  Monday,  sir? \n\\ \n15  THE  COURT:  Yes. \n16  ATTY.  PATTIS:  And,  Judge,  can  the  Court  -- can \n17  we  be  heard  on  the  question  of  an  appeal  bond?  I \n18  think  it's academic,  but  I'd like  nonetheless  to  have \n19  a  number  set,  if the  Court  is  inclined  to  give  one. \n20  THE  COURT:  Certainly, \n21  ATTY.  PATTIS:  We  would  ask  that  a  bond  be  set. \n22  We  think  that  there  are  arguments  as  to  the \n23  admissibility  of  certain  evidence. \n24  The  state's  destruction  of  material  that  we \n25  asked  to  be  preserved  prevented Mr.  Young  from \n(  l'~~ D \\'!i P C~~\\- ~\" l'  ~~  \n26  presenting  powerful  circumstant'i·al  evidence  of  what \n27  the  officers  did  to  him  at  the  time  of  the  arrest. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-6   Filed 07/07/20   Page 29 of 34\n26 \n1  We're  asking  for  an  appeal  bond  in  the  amount  of \n2.  $100-thousand,  Judge. \n3  THE  COURT:  Attorney  Durham. \n4  ATTY.  DURHAM:  Your  Honor,  presently,  I  believe \n5 \n6  THE  COURT:  Yeah.  What  is  it now? \n7  ATTY.  DURHAM:  -- 270-thousand  cash  bond.  So \n8  they're  asking  for  a  substantial  reduction  despite \n9  the  fact  that  the  defendant  is now  exposed  to \n10  twenty-two  years  of  incarceration. \n11  So  I  would  object  to  lowering  the  bond  at  this \n12  time. \n13  THE  COURT:  Madam  Clerk,  what  is  the  bond  now? \n( \n14  THE  CLERK:  It's thirty-thousand  cash, \n15  Your  Honor. \n16  THE  COURT:  Thirty-thousand  cash. \n17  ATTY.  DURHAM:  On  this  file,  Your  Honor. \n18  THE  COURT:  Okay. \n19  ATTY.  DURHAM:  He's  still being  held  on  bond  on \n20  his  eight  other  cases.  During  the  pendency  of  this \n21  case,  the  defepdant  had  gone  to  Florida  for  a  period \nI \n22  of  time,  missing  a  court  date. \n23  He  has,  frankly,  limited ties  to  the  state at \n24  this  point,  and  he  does  not  hold  a  permanent  address. \n25  He  sleeps  at  a  friend's  house  and  in  a  camper.  He's \n26  sometimes  at  job  sites  in Massachlisetts. \n27  The  state's  fear  is  that  if he  were  to  post  a \n\n.4.  6.  6. :  4. : \nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-6   Filed 07/07/20   Page 30 of 34\n27 \n1  bond,  he  would  flee.  And  he's  indicated  in  the  past, \n2  he'd  like  to  start  fresh  in  Florida.  So  that  is  the \n3  state's  concern,  as  well. \n4  ATTY.  PATTIS:  Had  he  wanted  to  do  so,  he  could \n5  have  done  so  after  any  of  the  preceding  eight  or  nine \n6  arrests,  and  he  didn't  do  so. \n7  What  he  did  was  came  back  to  this  court  with \n8  bond  each  and  every  time  he  could make  it and  said, \n9  look;  I  want  to meet  this  cases  at  trial.  He  also \n10  said,  look;  I'd like  you  to  preserve  the  best \n11  evidence  of  what  happened  so  that  I  can  have  a  fair \n12  fight  at  trial. \n13  The  state  failed  to  do  that,  now  accuses  him  of \n14  wanting  to  flee;  he  never  has.  If he  was  going  to \n15  flee,  he  wouJ.d  have  done  so  after  the  first  file. \n16  As  to  his  limited  ties  to  the  state,  I'm  unaware \n17  of  family  elsewhere.  The  fact  that  he  has  no  fixed \n18  residence  merely means  that  he~s economically \n19  unfortunate,  not  that  he  intends  to  flee. \n20  ATTY.  DURHAM:  Your  Honor,  I'd dispute  the \n21  suggestion  he's  economically  unfortunate,  given  the \n22  amount  of  bonds  that  he's  posted  throughout  the \n23  pendency  of  these  cases. \n24  There  was  -- initially,  roughly  $400-thousand  in \n25  surety bonds  had  been  posted  plus  an  additional \n( \n\\  26  thirty-thousand  dollars  in  cash  bonds  that  was  posted \n27  after bonds  were  increased  based  on  crimes  he \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 132-6   Filed 07/07/20   Page 31 of 34\n28 \n1  committed  while  on  release. \n2  ATTY.  PATTIS:  Attorney  Durham may  be \n3  independently  wealthy.  My  client  is  not.  He  has \n4  been  bled  dry. \n5  We're  asking  for  a  reasonable  bond,  Judge,  in \n6  the  event  his  family  can  help  him. \n7  THE  COURT:  Attorney  Durham,  what's  your \n8  recommendation  for  bond? \n9  ATTY.  DURHAM:  Your  Honor,  I'd ask  the  bond \n10  remain  as  set. \n11  THE  COURT:  Okay. \n12  Anything  else,  Attorney  Pattis? \n13  ATTY.  PATTIS:  No,  Judge. \n·. .  14  THE  COURT:  All  right.  The  defendant  has  been \n15  convicted  of  four  separate  crimes.  There's  no  longer \n16  a  presumption  of  innocence;  therefore,  the  bonds  will \n17  remain  as  set. \n18  ATTY.  PATTIS:  Thank  you,  Judge. \n19  THE  COURT:  And  if he  is  to  make  bond,  he  is  to, \n20  first  of  all,  turn  in  his  passport  to  the  Clerk's \n21  Office,  _and  he  will  be  on  electronic monitoring \n22  twenty-four  hours;  and  he  is  not  to  leave  the  state. \n23  Any  other  conditions  of  release?  All  right. \n24  ATTY.·  DURHAM:  None  from  the  state,  Your  Honor. \n25  THE  COURT:  Okay. \n26  All  right.  Is  there  anything  else? \n27  ATTY.

CV 17-4008971-S  SUPERIOR COURT \nROBERT DAY \nJUDICIAL DISTRICT \nOF TOLLAND \nV. \nCOMMISSIONER OF CORRECTION  APRIL 20, 2020 \nMEMORANDUM OF DECISION \nON PETITIONER'S EMERGENCY MOTION TO ADMIT PETITIONER TO BAIL \nThe petitioner, currently incarcerated to serve a thirty year sentence, has a pending \npetition for writ of habeas corpus. Due to the ongoing global pandemic caused by the SARS-\nCoV-2 virus, the petitioner has filed an emergency motion seeking to be released on bail, citing \nhis significant medical issues. The respondent objects. Since the habeas court's authority to \ngrant release to a petitioner is extremely limited to circumstances that are not present in this \ncase, the motion must be denied. \nI.  FACTUALBACKGROUND \nThe petitioner was sentenced on February 19, 2014, to thirty years' incarceration. His \ndirect appeal became final in 20 18. State v. Day, 171  Conn. App. 784, 158 A.3d 323 (20 17), \ncert. denied, 330 Conn. 924,  194 A.3d 776 (20 18). The petitioner then filed a habeas corpus \npetition raising claims of actual innocence, ineffective assistance of counsel and a violation of \ndue process. A trial in this matter commenced on March 3, 2020. The trial was suspended at \nthe end of the day in the midst of the testimony of trial counsel. It is expected that the \npetitioner will call a significant number of additional witnesses to testify once the trial resumes. \nThe petitioner has filed the instant motion and attached to it several medical records \nand a letter dated April 6, 2020 from Dr. Omprakash Pillai, the principal physician at \nMacDougall Cl, where the petitioner is housed, written to Carleton Giles, the chairperson of \n1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-7   Filed 05/01/20   Page 6 of 10\nthe Board of Pardons and Parole, in connection with the petitioner's application for release on \nmedical parole. The letter lists the extent and severity of the petitioner's medical condition and \nrecommends that he be released in light of his high risk of mortality. The Board of Pardons and \nParole has scheduled a hearing on the petitioner's request for medical parole on May 27, 2020. \nThe petitioner is in the infirmary at MacDougall Cl and requires twenty-four hour medical \nassistance. The respondent does not contest the severity of the petitioner's medical condition. \nII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  lurisdiction \nPreliminarily, this court must determine whether it has jurisdiction to consider the \npetitioner's motion to be released on bail. \"Our Supreme Court has held that in the context of \na habeas corpus proceeding, the Superior Court may, in the exercise of its discretion, admit a \npetitioner to bail.\" Guadalupe v. Commissioner of Correction, 68 Conn. App. 376, 387, 791 \nA.2d 640, 648 (2002), citing Carino v. Watson, 171  Conn. 366, 371, 370 A.2d 950 ( 1976) and \nWinnick v. Reilly,  I 00 Conn. 291,  123 A. 440 ( 1924). See also Rose v. Nickerson, 29 Conn. \nSupp. 81, 271  A.2d 855 ( 1970) (holding that superior court has authority to release habeas \npetitioner on bail while petition is pending in case where petition filed after conviction \nchallenging parole violation). In Connecticut, \"[t]he power to admit to bail after conviction is \nnot a statutory but a common-law power; the constitutional provision does not apply; bail is \nthen a matter of absolute discretion, to be exercised by the court, however, with great caution, \nand rarely to be allowed when the crime is serious.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation \nmarks omitted.) Carino v. Watson, supra, 171  Conn. 368-69. While \"the power to admit to bail \nis inherent in the court so long as the prisoner is in its custody; that is, until he is taken in \nexecution [. ..]  where, as in this state, a review of the judgment by a court of errors is a matter \n2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-7   Filed 05/01/20   Page 7 of 10\nof right, there must be power in the courts to stay execution, and, if the special circumstances \nof the case justify it, to admit to bail.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) ld. \n369. \nNone of these cases, however, involve the factual scenario present in this case: a \npetitioner who, validly convicted and serving his sentence, nevertheless seeks release on bail \nwhile his petition for writ of habeas corpus has not yet been decided by the habeas trial court. \nCarino v. Watson and Winnick v. Reilly both involved a petition for writ of habeas corpus \nchallenging the legality of extradition proceedings to New Jersey and in both those cases the \npetitioners sought release on bail while their challenge to extradition was resolved. In \nGuadalupe v. Commissioner of Correction, the petitioner sought to be released on bail from \nhis Connecticut conviction so that he may be transferred to federal custody. However, in \nGuadalupe, the court assumed, without deciding, that a habeas court has the authority to \nrelease a petitioner on bail. As noted above, Rose v. Nickerson involved a habeas corpus \nchallenge to the petitioner's detention on a parole violation. \nWhile there is no case precisely on point in Connecticut, federal courts have a well \ndeveloped body of caselaw on this subject, which provides appropriate guidance. \"The question \nof whether the federal courts have inherent power to grant bail in any case where they may \nproperly assert jurisdiction (whether it be criminal or involving alien deportation) is by no \nmeans a novel one. In fact, it has divided the federal courts for over a century.\" Mapp v. Reno, \n241  F.3d 221, 224-25 (2d Cir. 200 I). \"One of the inherent powers of the judiciary with regard \nto proceedings before it has been the admission of a prisoner to bail where, in the exercise of \nhis discretion, the judge deems it advisable. It is clear that at common law courts had the \ninherent power to grant bail. See, e.g., Queen v. Spilsbury. ( 1898) 2 Q.B. 615, 620. This \n3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-7   Filed 05/01/20   Page 8 of 10\nauthority was exercised in habeas corpus cases pending decision on the merits. In re Kaine, [ 14 \nHow.  I 03, 133, 55 U.S.  I 03,  133,  14 L. Ed. 345 ( 1852)] (dissent); Barth v. Clise, [ 12 Wall. 400, \n402, 79 U.S. 400, 402, 20 L. Ed. 393 ( 1870)]; 16 English & Empire Digest 268 ( 1923). Our \nFederal judiciary has consistently recognized that at common law this inherent power existed. \nSee, e.g., United States ex rei. Carapa v. Curran, [297 F. 946, 954, (2d Cir. 1924)]; United States \nv. Evans, C. C., [2 F.  147, 152 ( 1880)]; Ewing v. United States, [240 F. 241, 248 (6th Cir. 1917)].\" \nlohnston v. Marsh, 227 F.2d 528, 531  (3d Cir. 1955).1 \nIn Mapp v. Reno, the Second Circuit reaffirmed that the federal courts have inherent \nauthority to release habeas petitioners on bail pending disposition of the federal petition. See \nalso Ostrer v. United States, 584 F.2d 594, 596 n.  I (2d Cir.l978);  Calley v. Callaway, 496 F.2d \n70 I, 702 (5th Cir.l974) (per curiam); Baker v. Sard, 420 F.2d  1342, 1343 (D.C.Cir.l969) (per \ncuriam ) (\"[r]elease is available in a habeas corpus action\"); lohnston v. Marsh,  supra, 227 F.2d \n531  (\"[o]ne of the inherent powers of the judiciary with regard to proceedings before it has \nbeen the admission of a prisoner to bail where, in the exercise of his discretion, the judge \ndeems it advisable.\"); Mitchell v. Bell, 458 F. Supp. I 044,  I 049 (M.D. Ala. 1978) (\"It is firmly \nestablished that it is within the inherent power of the court to authorize bail pending hearing \nand decision on a petition for writ of habeas corpus.\"); Principe v. Ault, 62 F. Supp. 279, 281  (D. \nOhio 1945) (collecting cases). \n1 In lohnston v. Marsh, the Third Circuit briefly considered, but did not decide, whether the \nfollowing language in 28 U.S.C. § 2243 gave courts the statutory right to set bail in pending \nhabeas corpus petitions: \"The court shall summarily hear and determine the facts, and dispose \nof the matter as law and justice require.\" This language is closely analogous to that found in \nConn. Gen. Stat. §52-470, which directs that \"(a) The court or judge hearing any habeas corpus \nshall proceed in a summary way to determine the facts and issues of the case, by hearing the \ntestimony and arguments in the case, and shall inquire fully into the cause of imprisonment and \nthereupon dispose of the case as law and justice require.\" \n4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-7   Filed 05/01/20   Page 9 of 10\nBased on the foregoing, this court concludes that it has the authority to consider the \npetitioner's motion. \nB.  Standard \nThe habeas court's ability to set bail while the petition for writ of habeas corpus has not \nyet been adjudicated is to be exercised with \"great caution,\" only when \"special circumstances\" \nrequire it and \"rarely\" when the \"crime is serious.\" \"The standard for bail pending habeas \nlitigation is a difficult one to meet.\" Grune v. Coughlin, 913 F.2d 41, 44 (2d Cir. 1990). A \npetitioner must demonstrate two things: first, that \"the habeas petition raise[s] substantial \nclaims\" and second, \"that extraordinary circumstances exist[ ] that make the grant of bail \nnecessary to make the habeas remedy effective.\" ld. Thus, bail pending adjudication of a habeas \ncorpus petition may be granted \"only when the petitioner has raised substantial constitutional \nclaims upon which he has a high probability of success, and also when extraordinary or \nexceptional circumstances exist which make the grant of bail necessary to make the habeas \nremedy effective.\" Calley v. Callaway, supra, 496 F.2d 702; Mapp v. Reno, supra, 241  F.3d 226. \nJ. \nSee also Aronson v. May, 85 S. Ct. 3,  13 L. Ed. 2d 6 ( 1964) (Doug/as,  on application for bail) \n(special reason for granting bail requires showing that \"the pending appeal presents substantial \nquestions\" and also that \"there is some circumstance making this application exceptional and \ndeserving of special treatment in the interests of justice.\"); Benson v. State of California, 328 \nF.2d  159, 162 (9th Cir. 1964) (\"It would not be appropriate for us at this stage of the \nproceeding to enlarge this petitioner on bail even if we found that the allegations of his petition \nfor habeas corpus made out a clear case for his release. Something more than that is required \nbefore we would be justified in granting bail.\"). \n5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-7   Filed 05/01/20   Page 10 of 10\nThe petitioner cannot show that there is a high probability of success or that the \npetition raises substantial claims. The petitioner has made serious allegations in his petition for \nwrit of habeas corpus, but the court cannot determine, based on the pleading or the limited \ntestimony it heard on the first day of trial, that the petition has \"raised substantial constitutional \nclaims upon which he has a high probability of success.\" The petitioner's claims are dependent \non fact-finding by this court based on its credibility determination of witnesses who have not \nyet testified. Compare Boyer v. City of Orlando, supra, 402 F.2d 966, in which Boyer was \nsentenced to serve a 120 day sentence and claimed that he had not been represented by \ncounsel in the underlying proceedings and had not waived his constitutional right to counsel and \nMapp v. Reno, supra, 241  F.3d 221, in which the petitioner claimed that \"that § 440( d) of the \n[Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act] could not be applied to aliens whose \nconvictions preceded the effective date of that statute.\" In those cases, extensive fact-finding \nbased on credibility determinations was not required to determine whether there existed a \nhigh probability of success. \nThe court recognizes that, generally speaking, the current pandemic presents \nextraordinary circumstances. Cf. Calley v. Callaway, supra, 96 F.2d 702 (\"examples of \nextraordinary circumstances are serious deterioration of the petitioner's health while \nincarcerated ... \"). However, without a showing of a high probability of success on the merits of \nhis petition, this court cannot grant bail. \nThe motion must be denied. \nIs/ JN. 439590 \nBhatt, J. \n6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-8   Filed 05/01/20   Page 1 of 4\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-8   Filed 05/01/20   Page 2 of 4\nNNH-CR17-0177934-T  SUPERIOR COURT \nSTATE OF CONNECTICUT  JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF NEW HAVEN \nV.  AT NEW HAVEN \nDANIEL GREER  APRIL 24, 2020 \nORDER \nThe defendant has filed a motion entitled \"renewed emergency motion for release on \nbond based on pandemic health threat\" dated April 16, 2020 in which he asks to be released from \ncustody due to the presence of COVID-19 in the Connecticut prison system.  The defendant \nspecifically asks that he be released on bond pending his appeal of his criminal conviction or, in \nthe alternative, that he be temporarily released under house arrest conditions for a period of at \nleast thirty days, subject to periodic review as the emergency situation evolves.  The State has \nfiled a response objecting to the defendant's request. \nThe defendant is 79 years old and has chronic asthma.  His age and his medical condition \nresult in a higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.  See \nhttps:// www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/20 19-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html \n(last accessed April23, 2020).  The virus is present in the Connecticut prison system at a rate \nsubstantially higher than in the state's general population. See https://portal.ct.gov/ \n/media/DOC/Pdf/Coronavirus-3-20/COVID-19-Memo-from-Commissioner-PPEs-\n04142020.pdf?la=en (last accessed April23, 2020).  Moreover, the congregate nature of the \nhousing makes consistent social distancing, which is a recognized method of curtailing the \nspread of the virus, impractical.  At present, the Department of Correction also apparently lacks \nan adequate supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) for its staff, including masks, a \nshortfall which further impedes its ability to limit the infection rate of the virus.  See \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-8   Filed 05/01/20   Page 3 of 4\nhttps :// potial.ct. gov I -/media!DOC/Pdf/Coronavirus-3-20/CO VID-19-Memo-from \nCommissioner-PPEs-04142020.pdf?la=en (last accessed April23, 2020). \nI previously denied the defendant's request for a bond pending appeal because I was \nconvinced that there existed a serious and substantial risk that the defendant would flee during \nthe appeal process. That risk remains, though it has been lessened to some degree by the stay-at \nhome orders issued in Connecticut and in the tri-state area and by current domestic and \ninternational flight restrictions. \nWe live in extraordinary times.  Extraordinary times require extraordinary measures. \nGiven the present high incident of COVID-19 within Connecticut's prisons and the current lack \nof sufficient PPE for its staff, the defendant's advanced age and underlying medical condition \nwarrant his temporary release from prison until the crisis abates.  Accordingly, I hereby order the \ntemporary release of the defendant from incarceration on a conditional promise to appear with \nthe following conditions: \n•  Intensive pretrial supervision. \n•  Electronic monitoring through GPS and/or RF monitoring by the Office of Adult \nProbation. \n•  House arrest except that the defendant may, with prior approval by the probation officer \nor bail commissioner, travel to his attorney's office, medical appointments, and religious \nservices.  The synagogue must be disclosed to the bail commissioner who will verify that \na synagogue is located at that address.  The synagogue must be located in the greater \nNew Haven area.  Any other exceptions must by pre-approved by the probation officer or \nbail commissioner and are limited to essential and unforeseen needs  not previously \noutlined. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 26-8   Filed 05/01/20   Page 4 of 4\nDo not travel outside the greater New Haven area. \n•  Surrender passport to Office of Adult Probation or the Bail Commissioner. \n•  No contact with male children under the age of 16 years old. \n•  Do not violate the criminal law. \nThe temporary release of the defendant will continue for 45 days until June 8, 2020, unless \nextended or terminated by the court. \nBY THE COURT \n408383 \nJOt~ rv1.

That tragedy will have far-reaching effects not only for the \nthousands of Connecticut residents who live and work in correctional facilities, their families and \ncommunities, but also for the population of the state as a whole. Connecticut’s healthcare system \nsimply does not have the capacity to treat a massive outbreak in the incarcerated population at the \nsame time as it treats patients throughout the rest of the state. As jails and prisons become \nflashpoints for infection, the outbreak will overwhelm already limited state healthcare resources.  \n \nConnecticut has days, not weeks, to chart a different future. Under current conditions, in \nwhich there is no cure and no widespread testing, the thousands of Connecticut residents who live \nand work in correctional facilities are simply unable to practice the most effective method of \nprevention: social distancing. To create the requisite spacing of 6 feet between individuals, the \nState must (a) rapidly decrease the density of its prisons, jails, and halfway houses and (b) \n  1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-8   Filed 05/03/20   Page 142 of 157\nimplement humane and evidence-based approaches to protect the health of incarcerated individuals \nand staff alike. Success is possible but will require coordinated, urgent action among all relevant \nagencies, including the Department of Correction, the judiciary, the Chief State’s Attorney, law \nenforcement, the Department of Public Health, and the Connecticut Department of Housing. We \ncall upon you to use the full powers of your office to lead the way through this public health \nemergency.  \n \nI.  The Public Health Perspective \nCOVID-19 is a highly infectious disease. Due to its novelty, there exist few tools for \ncontainment and even fewer for treatment. The scientific community currently lacks a vaccine or \ncure. Neither the United States nor the state of Connecticut possesses sufficient resources to screen \nor test individuals, and projections show that, absent extreme intervention, infections will rapidly \noutpace available healthcare resources. We commend that your office has already taken decisive \naction to limit exposure among most state residents by ordering one of the few proven prevention \nmethods: social distancing. As already seen in the reduced rates of new infections, social \ndistancing works. \nUnfortunately,  effective  social  distancing  is  impossible  under  typical  conditions  in \nConnecticut’s correctional facilities. In Connecticut’s jails and lower security level prisons, \nincarcerated people sleep within feet of each other and use communal bathrooms, mess halls, \ndayrooms, and showers. Even in maximum security facilities, many people are double-celled and \nshare spaces to eat, bathe, and recreate. Further, while the Department of Correction has already \ntaken important actions, such as suspending visitors and volunteers, there is still a steady flow of \npeople  into  and  among  facilities.  Staff,  officers,  contractors,  and  vendors  are  still  moving \nthroughout and between facilities and they all link the facilities with surrounding communities. \nThese individuals can introduce the virus into the facility or contract it themselves and transmit it \nto others in the community. \nThe Department of Correction has stated that it is employing standard measures used to \ncontain other communicable diseases, such as the flu, but these are inadequate in the face of the \nnovel coronavirus. COVID-19 is estimated to be nearly 3 times more contagious than the flu and \nis deadlier. Furthermore, we are learning more about this novel coronavirus every day and it is \nbecoming increasingly clear that a significant percent of infections are transmitted by people even \nbefore they develop symptoms, meaning that there is no screening practice (checking temperatures \nor asking about symptoms) that is adequate. Additionally, whereas the flu is transmitted only by \nlarge droplets (i.e., 6 feet of distancing protects people), COVID-19 is now known to be passed in \nthe air as well. Under these circumstances, even heightened hygiene practices—frequent washing \nof hands with soap, regular bleaching and disinfection of public surfaces, and the like—are \ninsufficient. Further, proper containment and treatment of the novel coronavirus will require \nfacilities to quarantine people and will surely put a strain on the already understaffed healthcare \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-8   Filed 05/03/20   Page 143 of 157\nsystem in the Department of Correction. At Yale-New Haven Hospital, we have already seen that \nas more people have become sick, staff have become sick as well, and we are struggling to develop \nadequate staffing plans. Sick individuals will need to be sent to community-based hospitals, which \nthemselves are already struggling to provide adequate care to others.  \nWhile more must be done in the coming weeks and months, as a starting point, we suggest \nthe following immediate actions:  \n  1. To the maximum extent possible, reduce the number of people entering and re-\nentering the system. We applaud the state for already making efforts to mitigate dangers in this \narea, as announced in the Department of Correction’s March 24 release. Police and State’s \nAttorneys should decline to arrest or prosecute individuals except where an individual poses a \nserious threat to public safety. Parole officers should halt the reincarceration of people on technical \nparole violations.  \n  2. Immediately release, to the maximum extent possible, people detained pretrial. As \nof today, we estimate that there are 2,905 unsentenced (mostly pretrial) people in custody, 95 of \nwhom are 60 or older. For the duration of the pandemic, people should be presumptively released \non personal recognizance, absent a showing of a compelling threat to public safety. \n  3. Immediately release all people convicted of nonviolent offenses who are scheduled \nto  be  released  in  90  days,  all  people  who  are  eligible  for  parole  and  community \nsupervision/release, and anyone incarcerated for a technical parole, probation violation, or \nconditional discharge. As of today, we estimate that there are 4,112 people in custody with fewer \nthan 90 days left on their sentences, 201 of whom are 60 or older. Additionally, we estimate that \n1,503 people are currently in custody for violation of probation or conditional discharge, 51 of \nwhom are 60 or older. The state should continue to exercise the use of transitional supervision \nmore aggressively to facilitate the release of people with shorter sentences. Additionally, the \nConnecticut Board of Pardons and Parole should expedite the release of people already found \nsuitable for release on parole, expedite all review processes for people eligible for parole, exercise \nits power to commute sentences, and use its discretion to grant compassionate parole release. The \nBoard should refrain, however, from requiring transitional housing as part of that process, in order \nto prevent the spread of COVID-19 within these congregate settings.  \n  The advantage of releasing the populations outlined above lies in the fact that most have \nspent less time incarcerated and are more likely to have maintained social bonds with their \ncommunities outside of prison. Their families and communities are better equipped to aid them in \nself-quarantine than are prisons, jails, and halfway houses. Individuals who fit the above criteria \nfor release should be screened to determine if they have somewhere to live in the community where \nthey can self-isolate if necessary. Individuals with such available housing should be prioritized for \nimmediate release. \n  3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-8   Filed 05/03/20   Page 144 of 157\n  We note that the goal here is to thin the incarcerated population—by the most expeditious \nmeans possible, including releasing the healthy—to allow for social distancing. In some cases, \nsick individuals may have a more difficult time finding a safe place to live upon release, not least \nbecause of the lack of medical capacity in the state.  \n  We are very appreciative of the significant efforts you have already made to ensure people \nwho are released have safe accommodations in the community, and to ensure that no one is \nreleased to homelessness.  \n  4. Transition older adults and medically vulnerable individuals to medical and \ncommunity settings. Finally, we note that U.S. Attorney General William Barr, in response to \nrequests from Congress for a plan to mitigate the risk of widespread COVID-19 infection in federal \nprisons, has recommended that the federal Bureau of Prisons release certain at-risk individuals—\nincluding individuals with certain medical conditions and individuals over 60 years old. We agree \nthat this would be a worthy step to pursue in Connecticut, but we also emphasize that time is of \nthe essence here. We do not yet have a COVID-19 outbreak in our correctional facilities, but we \nmust act now to thin these populations out, social distance, and attempt to prevent one. That means \nreleasing whoever can be released most quickly and safely now. The next step would be to address \nthese at-risk populations. Many of the people who are most vulnerable will also be more \nchallenging to discharge: those without housing and those who, due to medical complexity, require \nmore  comprehensive  medical  discharge  planning.  The  state  must  nonetheless  work  toward \nreleasing older adults and other medically vulnerable inmates, who pose the least public safety risk \nand are most at-risk of COVID-19 complications. To that end, we, the Yale Transitions Clinic, \nhave created a hotline that DOC reentry coordinators and medical discharge planners can use to \nrefer people to us, and we will figure out the medical discharge follow-up. \nWe are eager to work with your office to facilitate any of these critical efforts for the public \nhealth of our state. We would also be glad to work with you in convening public health experts \nand physicians to further assess these issues, and the appropriate medical and public health \nprotocols for this population, as the pandemic evolves. \nThank you for your leadership on these issues thus far. \n \nSincerely, \n \n        \nEmily Wang, MD, MAS       \n  4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-8   Filed 05/03/20   Page 145 of 157\n   \nLisa Puglisi, MD \n \n \n \nAbbe R.

See Sentencing Tr. 9:8–18, ECF No. 74.  Although Perez’s \nphysicians directed that he receive follow-up care, such care was repeatedly delayed or difficult to \nobtain.  See id. 10:22–12:17.  He continues to suffer from pain and persistent vision problems.  \nBecause Perez has been detained since his arrest on September 27, 2017, ECF No. 17, his prison \nsentence is set to terminate on April 17, 2020, Def. Letter at 1. \n\nCaCsaes e3 :12:01-7c-vc-r0-00503541-3J-BAAT      DDooccuummeenntt  3948- 1   F  iFleidle d0 40/50/10/32/02 0   P  aPgaeg e2  3o fo 8f 9\nPerez requests release in advance of that date because he is at risk of contracting, and \nexperiencing serious complications from, COVID-19 if he remains at the MDC.  Id. at 1–2.  He \nspends most of each day with a cellmate in a small cell “that is barely large enough for a single \noccupant,” where he is “breathing recirculated air” and “unable to practice proper hygiene.”  Id. at 1.  \nAdditionally, Perez “is in pain and not receiving pain medication.”  Id.  The Federal Bureau of \nPrisons (the “BOP”) acknowledges that COVID-19 is present within the MDC.  See COVID-19 \nTested Positive Cases, Federal Bureau of Prisons, https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/.  The \nGovernment does not object to Perez’s release on the merits, conceding that Perez has a “heightened \nrisk of serious illness or death from COVID-19 due to his pre-existing medical issues,” and that “he \nhas less than a month remaining on his sentence.”  Gov’t Letter at 3.  But the Government questions \nthe Court’s authority to act on Perez’s application, arguing that he has not exhausted the \nadministrative remedies under § 3582(c)(1)(A), which requires that a defendant seeking \ncompassionate release present his application to the BOP and then either (1) administratively appeal \nan adverse result if the BOP does not agree that his sentence should be modified, or (2) wait for 30 \ndays to pass.  Gov’t Letter at 3–4. \nOn March 26, 2020, Perez submitted to the BOP his application for a sentence modification.  \nECF No. 96 at 4.  To date, the BOP has not acted on that request.  The Court holds, however, that \nPerez’s exhaustion of the administrative process can be waived in light of the extraordinary threat \nposed—in his unique circumstances—by the COVID-19 pandemic.  And the Court agrees with the \nparties that this threat also constitutes an extraordinary and compelling reason to reduce Perez’s \nsentence to time served.  Accordingly, Perez’s motion is GRANTED. \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCaCsaes e3 :12:01-7c-vc-r0-00503541-3J-BAAT      DDooccuummeenntt  3948- 1   F  iFleidle d0 40/50/10/32/02 0   P  aPgaeg e3  4o fo 8f 9\nDISCUSSION \nAs amended by the First Step Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A) authorizes courts to modify \nterms of imprisonment as follows: \nThe court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except \nthat—in any case—the court, upon motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or \nupon  motion  of  the  defendant  after  the  defendant  has  fully  exhausted  all \nadministrative rights to appeal a failure of the Bureau of Prisons to bring a motion on \nthe defendant’s behalf or the lapse of 30 days from the receipt of such a request by the \nwarden  of  the  defendant’s  facility,  whichever  is  earlier,  may  reduce  the  term  of \nimprisonment (and may impose a term of probation or supervised release with or \nwithout conditions that does not exceed the unserved portion of the original term of \nimprisonment), after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent \nthat they are applicable, if it finds that-- \n \n(i)  extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a reduction . . . and that \nsuch a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the \nSentencing Commission. \n \nAccordingly, in order to be entitled to relief under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A)(i), Perez must \nboth meet the exhaustion requirement and demonstrate that “extraordinary and compelling \nreasons” warrant a reduction of his sentence.  The Court addresses these requirements in turn. \nI.  Exhaustion \nSection 3582(c)(1)(A) imposes “a statutory exhaustion requirement” that “must be strictly \nenforced.”  United States v. Monzon, No. 99 Cr. 157, 2020 WL 550220, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, \n2020) (citing Theodoropoulos v. I.N.S., 358 F.3d 162, 172 (2d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks \nand alterations omitted)).1  The Court may waive that requirement only if one of the recognized \nexceptions to exhaustion applies. \n“Even where exhaustion is seemingly mandated by statute . . . , the requirement is not \nabsolute.”  Washington v. Barr, 925 F.3d 109, 118 (2d Cir. 2019) (citing McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 \n \n1 The Court need not decide whether § 3582(c)’s exhaustion requirement is a jurisdictional requirement or merely a \nmandatory claim-processing rule.  See Monzon, 2020 WL 550220, at *2 (describing split between courts on that \nquestion).   \n3 \n \n\nCaCsaes e3 :12:01-7c-vc-r0-00503541-3J-BAAT      DDooccuummeenntt  3948- 1   F  iFleidle d0 40/50/10/32/02 0   P  aPgaeg e4  5o fo 8f 9\nU.S. 140, 146–47 (1992)).2  There are three circumstances where failure to exhaust may be excused.  \n“First, exhaustion may be unnecessary where it would be futile, either because agency \ndecisionmakers are biased or because the agency has already determined the issue.”  Id.  Second, \n“exhaustion may be unnecessary where the administrative process would be incapable of granting \nadequate relief.”  Id. at 119.  Third, “exhaustion may be unnecessary where pursuing agency review \nwould subject plaintiffs to undue prejudice.”  Id. \nAll three of these exceptions apply here.  “[U]ndue delay, if it in fact results in catastrophic \nhealth consequences, could make exhaustion futile.  Moreover, the relief the agency might provide \ncould, because of undue delay, become inadequate.  Finally, and obviously, [Perez] could be unduly \nprejudiced by such delay.”  Washington, 925 F.3d at 120–21; see also Bowen v. City of New York, \n476 U.S. 467, 483 (1986) (holding that irreparable injury justifying the waiver of exhaustion \nrequirements exists where “the ordeal of having to go through the administrative process may trigger \na severe medical setback” (internal quotation marks, citation, and alterations omitted)); Abbey v. \nSullivan, 978 F.2d 37, 46 (2d Cir. 1992) (“[I]f the delay attending exhaustion would subject \nclaimants to deteriorating health, . . . then waiver may be appropriate.”); New York v. Sullivan, 906 \nF.2d 910, 918 (2d Cir. 1990) (holding that waiver was appropriate where “enforcement of the \nexhaustion requirement would cause the claimants irreparable injury” by risking “deteriorating \nhealth, and possibly even . . . death”).  Here, even a few weeks’ delay carries the risk of catastrophic \nhealth consequences for Perez.  The Court concludes that requiring him to exhaust administrative \n \n2 The Supreme Court has stressed that for “a statutory exhaustion provision . . . Congress sets the rules—and courts have \na role in creating exceptions only if Congress wants them to.”  Ross v. Blake, 136 S. Ct. 1850, 1857 (2016).  Even when \nfaced with statutory exhaustion requirements, however, the Supreme Court has allowed claims to proceed \nnotwithstanding a party’s failure to complete the administrative review process established by the agency “where a \nclaimant’s interest in having a particular issue resolved promptly is so great that deference to the agency’s judgment is \ninappropriate,” so long as the party presented the claim to the agency.  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 330 (1976).  \nThat reasoning explains the Second Circuit’s holding that even statutory exhaustion requirements are “not absolute.”  \nWashington, 925 F.3d at 118.  Perez has presented his claim to the BOP, see ECF No. 96 at 1, so the situation here is \nanalogous. \n4 \n \n\nCaCsaes e3 :12:01-7c-vc-r0-00503541-3J-BAAT      DDooccuummeenntt  3948- 1   F  iFleidle d0 40/50/10/32/02 0   P  aPgaeg e5  6o fo 8f 9\nremedies, given his unique circumstances and the exigency of a rapidly advancing pandemic, would \nresult in undue prejudice and render exhaustion of the full BOP administrative process both futile and \ninadequate.  \nTo be sure, “the policies favoring exhaustion are most strongly implicated” by challenges to \nthe application of existing regulations to particular individuals.  Pavano v. Shalala, 95 F.3d 147, 150 \n(2d Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks, citation, and alterations omitted).  Ordinarily, requests for a \nsentence reduction under § 3582(c) would fall squarely into that category.  But “courts should be \nflexible in determining whether exhaustion should be excused,” id. at 151, and “[t]he ultimate \ndecision of whether to waive exhaustion . . . should also be guided by the policies underlying the \nexhaustion requirement.”  Bowen, 476 U.S. at 484. The provision allowing defendants to bring \nmotions under § 3582(c) was added by the First Step Act, Pub. L. No. 115-391, 132 Stat. 5194 \n(2018), in order to “increas[e] the use and transparency of compassionate release.”  132 Stat. 5239.  \nRequiring exhaustion generally furthers that purpose, because the BOP is best situated to understand \nan inmate’s health and circumstances relative to the rest of the prison population and identify \n“extraordinary and compelling reasons” for release.  18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A)(i).  In Perez’s case, \nhowever, administrative exhaustion would defeat, not further, the policies underlying § 3582(c).   \nHere, delaying release amounts to denying relief altogether.  Perez has less than three weeks \nremaining on his sentence, and pursuing the administrative process would be a futile endeavor; he is \nunlikely to receive a final decision from the BOP, and certainly will not see 30 days lapse before his \nrelease date.  Perez asks that his sentence be modified so that he can be released now, and not on \nApril 17, 2020, because remaining incarcerated for even a few weeks increases the risk that he will \ncontract COVID-19.  He has had two surgeries while incarcerated, and continues to suffer severe side \neffects such as ongoing pain and persistent vision problems.  ECF No. 96 at 4.  As the Government \n5 \n \n\nCaCsaes e3 :12:01-7c-vc-r0-00503541-3J-BAAT      DDooccuummeenntt  3948- 1   F  iFleidle d0 40/50/10/32/02 0   P  aPgaeg e6  7o fo 8f 9\nconcedes, Perez faces a “heightened risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19 due to his pre-\nexisting medical issues.”  Gov’t Letter at 3.  Requiring exhaustion, therefore, would be directly \ncontrary to the purpose of identifying and releasing individuals whose circumstances are \n“extraordinary and compelling.”  \nAccordingly, the Court holds that Perez’s undisputed fragile health, combined with the high \nrisk of contracting COVID-19 in the MDC, justifies waiver of the exhaustion requirement.3 \nII.  Extraordinary and Compelling Reasons for Release \nThe Court also finds that Perez has set forth “extraordinary and compelling reasons” to reduce \nhis sentence to time served.  18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A)(i).  The Government does not dispute that \nPerez has done so.  Gov’t Letter at 3.  And Perez’s medical condition, combined with the limited time \nremaining on his prison sentence and the high risk in the MDC posed by COVID-19, clears the high \nbar set by § 3582(c)(1)(A)(i). \nThe authority to define “extraordinary and compelling reasons” has been granted to the \nUnited States Sentencing Commission, which has defined that term at U.S.S.G. § 1B1.13, comment \nn.1.  See United States v. Ebbers, No. 02 Cr. 11443, 2020 WL 91399, at *4–5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 8, \n2020).  Two components of the definition are relevant.  First, extraordinary and compelling reasons \nfor modification exist where “[t]he defendant is . . . suffering from a serious physical or medical \ncondition . . . that substantially diminishes the ability to provide self-care within the environment of a \ncorrectional facility and from which he or she is not expected to recover.”  U.S.S.G. § 1B1.13 \n \n3 A number of courts have denied applications for sentence modification under § 3582(c)(1)(A) brought on the basis of \nthe risk posed by COVID-19 on the ground that the defendants failed to exhaust administrative remedies.  See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Zywotko, No. 2:19 Cr. 113, 2020 WL 1492900, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 27, 2020); United States v. Garza, \nNo. 18 Cr. 1745, 2020 WL 1485782, at *1 (S.D. Cal. Mar. 27, 2020); United States v. Eberhart, No. 13 Cr. 00313, 2020 \nWL 1450745, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 25, 2020); United States v. Hernandez, No. 19 Cr. 834, 2020 WL 1445851, at *1 \n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 25, 2020); United States v. Gileno, No. 19 Cr. 161, 2020 WL 1307108, at *3 (D. Conn. Mar. 19, 2020).  \nBut in several of those cases, the defendant was not in a facility where COVID-19 was spreading, and in none of them did \nthe defendant present compelling evidence that his medical condition put him at particular risk of experiencing deadly \ncomplications from COVID-19.  In this case, unlike those, Perez has established that enforcing the exhaustion \nrequirement carries the real risk of inflicting severe and irreparable harm to his health. \n6 \n \n\nCaCsaes e3 :12:01-7c-vc-r0-00503541-3J-BAAT      DDooccuummeenntt  3948- 1   F  iFleidle d0 40/50/10/32/02 0   P  aPgaeg e7  8o fo 8f 9\ncomment n.1(A)(ii).  Perez’s recent surgeries, and his persistent pain and vision complications, \nsatisfy that requirement.  Confined to a small cell where social distancing is impossible, Perez cannot \nprovide self-care because he cannot protect himself from the spread of a dangerous and highly \ncontagious virus.  And although he may recover in the future from the surgeries and their \ncomplications, there is no defined timeline for that recovery; certainly, he is not expected to recover \nwithin the remainder of his sentence. \nThe Honorable Lorna G. Schofield recently granted an application for sentence reduction \nunder § 3582(c) under similar circumstances.  See United States v. Campagna, No. 16 Cr. 78-01, \n2020 WL 1489829, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2020).  Judge Schofield approved the request of a \ndefendant confined to the Brooklyn Residential Reentry Center (the “RCC”) stating that his \n“compromised immune system, taken in concert with the COVID-19 public health crisis, constitutes \nan extraordinary and compelling reason to modify [d]efendant’s sentence on the grounds that he is \nsuffering from a serious medical condition that substantially diminishes his ability to provide self-\ncare within the environment of the RCC.”  Id. at *3 (citing U.S.S.G. § 1B1.13 comment. n.1(A)). The \nsame justifications apply here. \nSecond, U.S.S.G. § 1B1.13 comment. n.1(D) authorizes release based on “an extraordinary \nand compelling reason other than, or in combination with, the [other] reasons described.”  Perez \nmeets this requirement as well, because he has weeks left on his sentence, is in weakened health, and \nfaces the threat of a potentially fatal virus.  The benefits of keeping him in prison for the remainder of \nhis sentence are minimal, and the potential consequences of doing so are extraordinarily grave. \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Perez has demonstrated extraordinary and compelling \nreasons justifying his release. \n \n7 \n \n\nCaCsaes e3 :12:01-7c-vc-r0-00503541-3J-BAAT      DDooccuummeenntt  3948- 1   F  iFleidle d0 40/50/10/32/02 0   P  aPgaeg e8  9o fo 8f 9\nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, Perez’s motion for a reduction of his term of imprisonment \npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A) is GRANTED.  Perez’s term of imprisonment is reduced to \ntime served.  It is ORDERED that Perez be released immediately to begin his two-year term of \nsupervised release.   \nThe Clerk of Court is directed to terminate the motion at ECF No. 92. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: April 1, 2020 \n            New York, New York \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-2   Filed 05/03/20   Page 1 of 4\n \n \n \n \nExhibit 2 \n\nFW: Priority 1 Business Function Procedure -

I represent a client named Marcus Champagne who is serving a sentence of \nincarceration in Connecticut suffers from asthma and is immunocompromised. \n4.  Based on the materials I have read from the Centers for Disease Control, Mr. \nChampagne’s autoimmune condition puts him at high risk for serious \ncomplications should he become ill with the novel coronoavirus. \n5.  On April 28, 2020, I filed in the Connecticut Superior Court in New Britain for a \nsentence modification for Mr. Champagne on an expedited basis on account of \nhis condition. \n6.  On the next day, court staff emailed to convey that Mr. Champagne’s motion will \nnot be heard “until courts open up for regular business” because sentence \nmodifications “are not Priority 1 matters.” \n7.  I have attached that email as an exhibit to this declaration. \n8.  I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \n \n__/s/ Aaron J.

I am a paralegal in the Connecticut Innocence Project/Post-Conviction Unit within the \nDivision of Public Defender Services. \n2.  As part of my duties, I process all habeas petitions that the Division of Public Defender \nServices receives from the superior court. The process is as follows: First, the clerk’s \noffice receives a petition from a petitioner. If the petition meets all the guidelines (correct \nnumber of copies, signatures, notarized, and a claim that can be docketed), the petition is \ngiven a docket number and then referred to our office for an eligibility determination, if it \nis a petition where the person is entitled to counsel.    \n3.  Nearly all habeas cases in Connecticut are heard in the Judicial District of Tolland at \nRockville. That courthouse has been closed since March 27.  \n4.  To my knowledge, all open habeas cases have been continued indefinitely since that time.  \n5.  The last habeas petition I received from the superior court was on March 12, 2020 \n(CV20-5000554-S). I have not received anything since then from the Rockville clerk’s \noffice.  \n6.  Rockville cases are technically being referred to the Hartford GA courthouse—I \nunderstand the mail is forwarded from Rockville to Hartford—but I have not heard or \nreceived anything from the Hartford clerk’s office.  \n7.  If a habeas petition related to COVID-19 were considered a conditions of confinement \nclaim (for which someone is not entitled to counsel), it would not be forwarded to our \noffice. However, habeas claims for conditions of confinement claims are typically \ndocketed, sequentially, alongside all other habeas claims.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-4   Filed 05/03/20   Page 3 of 3\n8.  As far as I can tell, habeas petitions are not being docketed. According to the Judicial \nBranch Website, the last petition CV20-5000557-S was docketed and declined on March \n12, 2020. Docket number CV20-5000558-S does not yet exist. \n  I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct     \n         \n               \n              ___________________________________ \n              Elizabeth Dolbeare \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-5   Filed 05/03/20   Page 1 of 2\n \n \n \n \nExhibit 5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 34-5   Filed 05/03/20   Page 2 of 2\nFrom: Stackpole, Kathryn\nTo: Elana Bildner; Pickett, Gina\nSubject: Re: Habeas filings - questions\nDate: Thursday, April 16, 2020 10:31:33 AM\nGood morning Elana,\nCourt operations has mandated that matters that are not priority 1 are on hold. Habeas\nmatters are not considered priority 1 and are currently on hold.  However, emergency\npetitions or motions will be reviewed by a judge and the judge will determine whether a\nhearing will be held. Habeas petitions should be mailed to GA 19 at 20 Park Street in Rockville.\nAll GA 19 mail is being sent to Hartford. Because of the volume of mail being sent to Hartford,\nyou may wish to make a notation on the envelope that it is an emergency habeas petition. \nHope that helps.

There are almost three million confirmed cases \nof COVID-19 worldwide, and hundreds of thousands have died.  As a result, millions, perhaps \nbillions, of people are under orders to practice “social distancing” to avoid spreading the disease.  \nJails in urban centers such as New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia have been overrun with \ninfection and COVID-19 cases, and Connecticut Department of Correction (“DOC”) facilities are \nno exception.  Indeed, DOC has already reported that 484 of the people in its custody (and 361 \nstaff) have been infected with COVID-19 in the past month. Six people have died, and it is highly \nprobable that more will follow.   \nUnlike the general population in Connecticut and other communities around the world, \nPlaintiffs-Petitioners (“Plaintiffs”) and the classes they seek to represent have been subjected by \nDefendants-Respondents (“Defendants”) to conditions of confinement that prevent them from \navailing themselves of the basic social distancing and other public health guidelines that are \nmandated or recommended for everyone else in society.  These conditions of confinement pose a \nserious and imminent threat of severe disease and death for Plaintiffs and others in Defendants’ \ncustody.  Judicial intervention is necessary to protect their health and their lives.   \nThe conditions of confinement at DOC facilities are shockingly insufficient to protect \nPlaintiffs from infection, serious complications, or death from COVID-19.  Pandemic or no, people \ncontinue to live in crowded open dormitories and double-celled units.  The sanitation practices of \nDefendants in DOC facilities are inadequate; Defendants deny Plaintiffs and other prisoners even \nthe most basic hygiene products; and they have not sufficiently complied with guidelines from the \nCenters  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (“CDC”)  directing  correctional  institutions  to \nimplement mitigation efforts like social distancing and other best practices.  Instead, Defendants’ \nprimary response to the outbreak at DOC facilities has been to transfer members of the Classes \n1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43   Filed 05/10/20   Page 8 of 47\n \nwho have tested positive for COVID-19 to Northern Correctional Institution (“Northern”), a Level \n5 prison designed exclusively to punish, not to serve as a medical facility. Not only has this move \nbeen roundly condemned by scores of public health experts—who say it will exacerbate, not \nmitigate, the virus’s rampage through DOC facilities—but, tellingly, no other jurisdiction in the \nUnited States has resorted to putting people suffering from a novel, highly fatal illness in a \nsupermax prison.  And notwithstanding the use of Northern, many of those who show symptoms \nof COVID-19 simply continue to be denied medical care, or moved from facility to facility, \nmeaning that Defendants recklessly expose those who are not symptomatic to those who are.  At \nbottom, the conditions at DOC facilities have created a rapid, uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 \nwith grave outcomes for both the incarcerated population and the surrounding communities.   \nThe stakes here could not be higher:  lives are on the line.  Courts have acknowledged the \ngravity of the situation and relied on their equitable powers to protect people held at prisons and \ndetention  facilities  during  this  once-in-a-lifetime  pandemic.    Indeed,  given  that  large-scale \noutbreaks at DOC facilities are spilling over into the surrounding communities and spreading \ninfection throughout Connecticut, Plaintiffs’ requested preliminary relief is more than justified and \nwould impose a minimal burden on Defendants and the public at large.   \nFor these reasons and those discussed below, Plaintiffs have sought emergency preliminary \nrelief.  Pursuant to Plaintiffs’ representations during the Court’s telephonic scheduling conference \non May 7, 2020,1 Plaintiffs convert their motion for a temporary restraining order, filed on April \n27, 2020,2 to this motion for a preliminary injunction. \n \n1 See Docket No. 15. \n2 See Docket No. 40. \n2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43   Filed 05/10/20   Page 9 of 47\n \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nThe nation and the world are in the grips of the most significant pandemic in generations, \ncaused by COVID-19—a fast-moving virus that has infected millions and upended life in every \ncorner of the globe, country, and state.3  This Court is doubtless aware of the devastating effects \nCOVID-19 is having on the state of Connecticut.4  As of May 7, 2020, 3,815,561 cases have been \nconfirmed globally, with 1,245,622 of those cases in the United States.5  Over 74,000 Americans \nhave died.6  Connecticut alone has reported 31,784 cases of COVID-19, and 2,797 deaths.7  The \nvirus continues to spread exponentially.

The first positive test of an incarcerated \nperson at a DOC facility was announced on March 30.32  In a little over a month, that number has \nrisen to 484 confirmed positive incarcerated people; 361 positive staff members;33 and six deaths. \n  The speed at which COVID-19 has overtaken DOC is staggering. On April 2, three days \nafter the first positive test, 16 DOC staff members and 8 incarcerated people had tested positive for \nCOVID-19.  By April 6, both those numbers more than doubled, to 32 DOC staff members and 21 \nincarcerated people.  By April 7, they had grown exponentially: 41 DOC staff members and 44 \nincarcerated people, with 53 prisoner test results still pending.34  \n  On April 8, DOC announced it had begun transferring people who had tested positive to \nNorthern; as of that day, the number of incarcerated people at DOC facilities who tested positive \nhad grown to 46 across 13 different DOC facilities.35  But DOC’s use of Northern has in no way \nstopped the surge in positive cases.  As of April 13, they stood at 104 staff and 166 incarcerated \npeople.36  That day, the first incarcerated person died of COVID-19; another person followed, and \nothers have died immediately after being released from custody.37  \nAs of this writing, May 7, 361 staff and 484 prisoners have tested positive for COVID-\n19—meaning that DOC has gone from one infected prisoner to nearly 900 people infected across \nthe system a little over a month.

As public health \nexperts have said for weeks, correctional facilities like those run by DOC are the exact type of \ncongregate environment—where people live, eat, bathe, and sleep in close proximity—in which \nCOVID-19 infection thrives.39  This increased risk is present in every prison, given the nature of \nprison.40  People incarcerated in these facilities are forced into close contact with each other and \nprison staff, including corrections officers.41  They cannot achieve the requisite social distancing \nneeded to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19.42  They likely share or touch objects used \noften by others and cleaned infrequently.43  In addition to eating, sleeping, recreating, and living \nclose to each other, they have to share bathroom facilities—showers, toilets, and sinks—without \nadequate cleaning between uses.44  Insufficient medical treatment capabilities also make it nearly \nimpossible to treat infected people properly, let alone prevent the further spread of COVID-19 \nthroughout the incarcerated population.45     \n  Additionally, about 40 percent of incarcerated people nationally are estimated to have at \nleast one chronic illness, including Plaintiffs Williams-Void, Doe, and Roe.46  Many of these \n \n38 Declaration of Jane Roe ¶ 4 (Apr. 23, 2020) (“Roe Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit B.   \n39 Giftos Decl. ¶ 13; Affirmation of Brie Williams, M.D., Compl.

THE CURRENT CONDITIONS IN WHICH DEFENDANTS HAVE CONFINED \nPLAINTIFFS AND CLASS MEMBERS ONLY EXACERBATE THE ALREADY \nEXTREME AND IMMINENT DANGER THEY FACE OF CONTRACTING AND \nPOSSIBLY DYING FROM COVID-19. \nAs detailed in the Complaint, Defendants’ response to the pandemic has been fatally \npiecemeal and reactive.55  As of mid-March, DOC spokespeople were boldly proclaiming that \nthere was no need to plan specifically for COVID-19; the department could simply recycle a 2007 \ninfluenza outline.56  Even today, Defendants’ response is neither uniform nor comprehensive, but \na grab-bag of aspirational half-measures that does not provide constitutionally adequate conditions \nof confinement.  Declarations submitted in support of Plaintiffs’ motion reveal a dangerous \ncombination of close proximity, conflicting and loose standards, and dire lack of sanitation and \nmedical resources—so much so that the DOC’s own staff continues to issue urgent, public pleas \nfor assistance.57  The disparities between what the CDC recommends, the policies DOC has put in \nplace, and what is actually happening in prisons are stark.  \nThe declarations from Plaintiffs and other incarcerated people that are attached to this \nmotion document the multiple ways Defendants defy CDC recommendations by continuing to \nforce those in their custody to sleep, eat, recreate, bathe, and use the phone in close proximity, \nwith minimal efforts to minimize the spread of COVID-19.58  These declarations also document \n \n54 Golob Decl. ¶ 12.   \n55 See Compl. ¶ 12.   \n56  Kelan  Lyons,  Elderly  Prisoners  in  Connecticut  Vulnerable  to  Potential  Coronavirus  Outbreak, \nHARTFORD COURANT (Mar. 11, 2020), https://cutt.ly/4ysyKVY. \n57 Mike Savino, DOC Workers Rally Outside Headquarters, Demanding Better Conditions, EYEWITNESS \nNEWS 3 (WFSB) (Apr. 24, 2020), https://cutt.ly/OysyCvG (describing rally by DOC staff for more \nprotective equipment, minimizing contact with prisoners, and ability to work remotely).   \n58 See generally Declarations of Pattikate Williams-Void (Apr. 24, 2020) (“Williams-Void Decl.”), attached \nhereto as Exhibit C; Thomas Caves (Apr. 17, 2020) (“Caves Decl.”), attached hereto Exhibit D; William \n11 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43   Filed 05/10/20   Page 18 of 47\n \nthe deleterious effect of Defendants’ refusal to act in a coordinated, comprehensive, systematic \nfashion by revealing just how much pandemic response measures vary by facility, building, and \neven unit.

Defendants Have Taken Insufficient Steps to Limit the Spread Of COVID-19 \nin DOC Facilities. \nDefying public health experts’ urgent recommendation that they take concerted, wide-scale \naction to de-densify DOC facilities, and notwithstanding the unprecedentedly dangerous nature of \nthis global pandemic, Defendants have consistently refused to take steps to release anyone from \ntheir custody outside of routine, one-by-one mechanisms meant for a non-emergency context.59  \n \nBruno (Apr. 14, 2020) (“Bruno Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit E; Angel Caballero (Apr. 22, 2020) \n(“Caballero Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit F; Marcus Champagne (Apr. 23, 2020) (“Champagne \nDecl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit G; Alex Flemming (Apr. 21, 2020) (“Flemming Decl.”), attached hereto \nas Exhibit H; Tyquwane Gilchrest (Apr. 23, 2020) (“Gilchrest Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit I; Chaz \nGulley (Apr. 8, 2020) (“Gulley Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit J; Zain Hussain (Apr. 17, 2020) \n(“Hussain Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit K; Roger Johnson (Apr. 17, 2020) (“Johnson Decl.”), attached \nhereto as Exhibit L; Frank Kelly (Apr. 16, 2020) (“Kelly Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit M; Austin Kerr \n(Apr. 20, 2020) (“Kerr Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit N; Kezlyn Mendez (Apr. 15, 2020) (“Mendez \nDecl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit O; Robert Miller (Apr. 20, 2020) (“Miller Decl.”), attached hereto as \nExhibit P; Luis Pagan (Apr. 8, 2020) (“Pagan Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit Q; Jonathan Pape (Apr. \n22, 2020) (“Pape Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit R; Kyle Lamar Paschal-Barros (Apr. 17, 2020) \n(“Paschal-Barros Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit S; Chad Petitpas (Apr. 22, 2020) (“Petitpas Decl.”), \nattached hereto as Exhibit T; Ken Pierce (Apr. 15, 2020) (“Pierce Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit U; \nDarien Rosario (Apr. 24, 2020) (“Rosario Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit V; Christopher Russell (Apr. \n22, 2020) (“Russell Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit W; Tyrone Spence (Apr. 16, 2020) (“Spence Decl.”), \nattached hereto as Exhibit X; Anthony Toscano (Apr. 14, 2020) (“Toscano Decl.”), attached hereto as \nExhibit Y; Joshua Wilcox (Apr. 23, 2020) (“Wilcox Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit Z; Tre McPherson \n(Apr. 24, 2020) (“McPherson Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit AA. \n59 DOC’s touted numbers of releases are both incomplete and misleading.  For example, that the state’s \nprison population was lower at the outset of this pandemic than in past years has nothing to do with whether \nDOC has released anyone because of the pandemic’s dangers.  DOC has similarly glossed over whether \nrecent releases have anything to do with the pandemic, rather than people maxing out on their sentences or \nfewer people entering the prison system.

Hartford Correctional Center, which has seen outbreaks in nearly \nevery building, houses around 900 people.  Willard-Cybulski Correctional Institution, which has \nsimilarly seen mass outbreaks, houses around the same number. \nAlthough Defendants now transfer people who test positive for COVID-19 to Northern,62 \nDefendants have not leveraged the resulting additional capacity to implement recommended and \nnecessary social distancing measures.  Notwithstanding seven weeks’ worth of executive orders \nDefendant Lamont has issued to protect public health during the a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic—\nwhich repeatedly highlight the particular threat COVID-19 poses to institutional and congregate \nhousing63—Defendants still force those in their custody to live and breathe “on top of one another,” \nby the dozens or hundreds.64   \nMany DOC facilities have dormitory-style housing in which up to 120 people live side-by-\nside in one room.  Pandemic notwithstanding, these remain unchanged, with dozens or hundreds \nof people still sleeping on bunk beds a few feet apart.65    \n \n60 Conn. Dep’t of Correction, Connecticut Correctional Facility Population Counts, https://cutt.ly/8yxIF6P \n(last accessed May 5, 2020).  \n61 In early April, DOC stopped reporting facility-by-facility numbers of people who had tested positive.  It \nalso stopped reporting the number of incarcerated people who have been tested for COVID-19.  \n62 See infra Section III.C.  \n63 See Lamont Exec. Order Nos. 7–7FF. \n64 Russell Decl. ¶ 4.  \n65 See, e.g., Toscano Decl. ¶ 2 (unit at Willard-Cybulski Correctional Institution holds about 100 people, \nsleeping two feet apart); Champagne Decl. ¶¶ 2, 5 (120 people housed in unit at Hartford Correctional \nCenter who sleep 4 feet away from each other); McPherson Decl. ¶¶ 5–6 (unit at Bridgeport Correctional \nCenter houses 48 people in bunkbeds who can “reach over and touch” next bed); Bruno Decl. ¶¶ 1, 3 (114 \npeople in dormitory at Brooklyn Correctional Institution, sleeping 2 feet apart); Miller Decl. ¶ 1 (90 people \nin unit at Carl Robinson Correctional Institution). \n13 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43   Filed 05/10/20   Page 20 of 47\n \nOther DOC facilities hold incarcerated people two to a cell in close quarters.  Social \ndistancing in a cell is impossible: cellmates sleep in bunk beds and share a desk, a toilet, and a sink \nin each cell.66  And like their dormitory counterparts, DOC facilities with double cells hold \nupwards of 80 people in each unit.67  Any time people in double-celled units are out of their cells, \nthey share each and every inch of physical space with their entire unit in common areas.  \nThe risks of continuing to house a large number of people in a dormitory or double-celling \npeople during a global pandemic are apparent and defy logic.  DOC’s dormitories and cells are too \nsmall for people to stand inside and remain six feet away from each other, as the CDC has urged—\nif not ordered—hundreds of millions of Americans to do.  There simply is no way for someone to \npractice social distancing while confined to a dormitory or cell with other people.68 \nDefendants do not allow those in their custody any opportunity to practice social distancing \neven outside of their cells.  Multiple times a day, people receive their meals together and take them \nto sit “shoulder-to-shoulder and knee-to-knee” at tables in their unit’s common areas.69  Needless \nto say, this is far more than the five-person limit Connecticut has placed for any congregation of \npersons.70  Even those who receive meals to eat on individual bunks or in cells are unable to avoid \nproximity to others, as they must stand “right next to each other in the line” to get them,71 or their \nbunks are so close together that there are still “10 people within four feet of each” other.72   \n \n66 See, e.g., Pape Decl. ¶ 5 (he and his cellmate are “always bumping into each other when we walk[] around \nthe cell at the same time”); Spence Decl. ¶ 4 (his cell is “cramped, and it is impossible to stay more than \nfive feet away from one another”).  \n67 See Spence Decl. ¶ 2 (90 people housed in E dorm at Garner); Caves Decl. ¶ 1 (82 or 83 people housed \nin B pod at Corrigan); Rosario Decl. ¶ 2 (150 housed in E unit at Osborn).   \n68 See e.g., Hussain Decl. ¶ 11; Bruno Decl. ¶ 3; Russell Decl. ¶ 4. \n69 Petitpas Decl. ¶ 5; see also Russell Decl. ¶ 4; Hussain Decl. ¶ 11; Toscano Decl. ¶ 5; Spence Decl. ¶ 5; \nMendez Decl. ¶ 5. \n70 See Lamont Exec.

Those in DOC custody share phones with \ntheir entire units.  Because visitors have been prohibited since mid-March, telephone calls are the \nonly lifeline to friends and family.  As a result, the telephone bays frequently are crowded, and \npeople must jam shoulder-to-shoulder next to each other.73  Phones are shared among tens or \nhundreds of people every day.74   \nFinally, all those in DOC custody share showers—and in dormitory settings, toilets and \nsinks—with their entire unit.75  Like phones, showers are sometimes sanitized and sometimes \nnot.76  Given these conditions, incarcerated people have described themselves as “lab rat[s] trapped \nin a small place waiting to get sick.”77   \nB.  Defendants Maintain Dangerous, Unsanitary Conditions at DOC Facilities \nand Do Not Provide Appropriate Medical Care. \nDefendants also do not use sanitary procedures sufficient to promote proper personal \nhygiene or ensure that common areas shared by many incarcerated people remain clean.  Many in \nDOC custody have observed no changes to cleaning protocols during the pandemic.78  For \nexample, Defendants do not sanitize or clean the unit showers between uses, even though tens or \nhundreds  of individuals share them.79  Most other routine items, such as “[h]andcuffs and \nshackles[,] are used repeatedly throughout the day, and are not sanitized between uses.”80  Whether \n \n73 See Caves Decl. ¶ 6 (explaining “you’re right next to the next person” when using phones).   \n74 Toscano Decl. ¶ 7 (6 phones shared with 75 people); Rosario Decl. ¶¶ 2, 8 (4 phones shared with 150 \npeople); McPherson Decl. ¶¶ 5, 8 (phones shared with 48 people); Pagan Decl. ¶¶ 2, 8 (4 phones shared \nwith 40 people); Gulley Decl. ¶¶ 2, 6 (1 phone shared with 48 people).  \n75 See e.g., Toscano Decl. ¶ 7 (9 showers shared with 75 people); Rosario Decl. ¶¶ 2, 8 (4 showers with 150 \npeople).

Although regular, frequent handwashing is vital \nfor limiting the spread of COVID-19, and CDC guidance establishes that prisons should “[p]rovide \na no-cost supply of soap to incarcerated/detained persons, sufficient to allow frequent hand \nwashing,” Defendants still have not provided many people in their custody with soap.83  In that \ncase, those who cannot afford soap do not clean their hands.84  Some incarcerated people have \nbeen provided soap only when they complained,85 while others have received small amounts only \nrecently.86  Notwithstanding the lack of soap, “alcohol based sanitizer,” which Defendant Lamont \nand the CDC have concluded greatly reduces the spread of COVID-19,87 is prohibited to prisoners \nin his custody.88   \n  CDC guidance provides that doorknobs, light switches, sink handles, countertops, toilets, \ntoilet handles, recreation equipment, kiosks, and telephones be cleaned “several times a day.”89  \nYet in most facilities, Defendants have made no effort to increase cleaning of common spaces, \n \n81 See Spence Decl. ¶ 8 \n82 Toscano Decl. ¶¶ 2, 7 (6 phones shared with 75 people, sanitized once per day); Rosario Decl. ¶¶ 2, 8 (4 \nphones shared with 150 people, wiped down once); Williams-Void Decl. ¶ 9 (wipes down shared phone \nwith a personal rag because she does not think it has been cleaned); McPherson Decl. ¶¶ 5, 8 (phones shared \nwith 48 people and cleaned only between rec shifts); Kelly Decl. ¶ 6 (phones not cleaned between use).  \n83 See Mendez Decl. ¶ 6; Flemming Decl. ¶ 10; Spence Decl. ¶ 6; Pierce Decl. ¶¶ 7, 9.  \n84 Petitpas Decl. ¶ 10.   \n85 Pierce Decl. ¶ 7 (one bar of soap since he complained). \n86 Caves Decl. ¶ 3 (one small bar a week ago); Champagne Decl. ¶ 5 (two bars of soap in past month); \nToscano Decl. ¶ 6 (less than two weeks ago, staff started giving out soap consistently).   \n87 Gov.

Special \nRapporteur on Torture, Nils Melzer, condemned conditions at Northern as “purposefully inflicting \nsevere pain or suffering, physical or mental, which may well amount to torture.”110  \nDefendants’ decision to use a maximum security prison as a de facto COVID-19 treatment \nfacility astounded even DOC employees.111  DOC medical staff reported that they were left with \ntheir “mouths wide open” by DOC’s lack of any “concrete plan,” and that “staff at Northern were \ntold to construct the COVID-19 unit just hours before sick individuals were set to arrive.”112  Those \nwho already were incarcerated at Northern began observing stacks of mattresses carried into the \n2-West unit at Northern one afternoon, after which sick people “looking like they were hurting” \nbegan arriving throughout the night.113  There have been so many COVID-19 patients at Northern \nthat staff had to open a second 100-person unit.114  They are using both 2-West and 3-West.115   \nNorthern is not a medical facility and its COVID-19 unit cannot and does not provide \nspecialized medical care.116  According to the medical staff who work there, there are “only two \n \n107 DOC has five security levels: “level 5, maximum security; level 4, high security; level 3, medium \nsecurity;  level  2,  minimum  security,”  and  level  1,  community release.

Rather than seek treatment, \nincarcerated people desperately try to hide symptoms because they are terrified of being sent to \nNorthern.137  Defendants’ use of Northern thus exacerbates the risks to Plaintiffs and the Class \nMembers.

Defendants  Do  Not  Properly  Screen,  Test,  or  Quarantine  Persons  with \nCOVID-19 Exposure.  \nEven  considering  their  use  of  Northern,  Defendants’  measures  to  screen,  test,  and \nquarantine are woefully inadequate.  Not only do symptomatic people wait days for medical care, \nbut Defendants have made no efforts to identify and isolate individuals at high risk for serious \nillness, those with potential exposure to the virus, or those with symptoms consistent with COVID-\n19.  To the contrary—and notwithstanding high rates of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic \ntransmission—they recklessly transfer those who have been exposed to COVID-19 to other \npopulations and facilities.   \nMost troubling is the abject failure to treat symptomatic individuals.  People are kept in \ntheir congregate housing units for days or even weeks after reporting COVID-19 symptoms and \nrequesting medical care.140  Some are refused medical care altogether.141  The first prisoner to die \nfrom COVID-19 in custody had reportedly had a fever of 101 degrees and been begging to be seen \n \n138 David Cloud, et al., The Ethical Use of Medical Isolation—Not Solitary Confinement—to Reduce \nCOVID-19 Transmission in Correctional Settings (Apr. 9, 2020).   \n139 See Miller Decl. ¶¶ 5–9 (detailing how he was transferred to Northern after refusing a meal in order to \nprotest lack of cleaning supplies and sanitation and hygiene measures).  \n140  Rosario  Decl.  ¶ 10  (symptomatic  people  only  quarantined  after  four  days);  Gilchrest  Decl.  ¶ 5 \n(symptomatic for two weeks “before anyone did anything,” despite requests to staff).   \n141 Champagne Decl. ¶ 10 (person asked repeatedly to go to medical but refused, though two others were \ntaken).  \n22 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43   Filed 05/10/20   Page 29 of 47\n \nbefore he finally was transferred to a hospital.142  \nDefendants also have recklessly moved people from place to place, including those \nexposed to COVID-19.143  Officials at Osborn, for example, reintegrated quarantined inmates into \nthe broader facility.144  People who seek to be tested are kept alongside those who are ill, even \nbefore they themselves test positive.145  One person who felt ill was kept in a cell at Bridgeport \nwith three other people who had tested positive, though he himself was never tested.146  He was \nunable to make phone calls or shower, and he was not given sheets, so he slept on a bare \nmattress.147  The staff with whom he interacted during this time were not wearing masks.

Plaintiffs and the Proposed Classes (including the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses) \nwill face the immediate, serious, and apparent risk of severe illness and possible death unless the \nCourt  intervenes.168    This  is  not  a  speculative  harm.    Cases  of  COVID-19  are  growing \nexponentially.  As of the time of this filing, 985,374 cases have been reported in the United States, \nwith 25,269 cases and 1,924 deaths in Connecticut.  More than 600 of these cases and two deaths \nare attributable to Defendants Lamont and Cook’s failures.   \nGiven the serious and often lethal nature of this disease, and the overwhelming strain it has \ncaused to our healthcare system, Plaintiffs and the Proposed Classes have established a serious \nrisk that, without the requested relief, they will be infected by coronavirus and develop COVID-\n19.  Members of the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses may die if not released.  Even those \nPlaintiffs and Proposed Class members who get infected and survive still face the prospect of a \nprolonged and painful recovery, including the need for extensive rehabilitation for profound \nreconditioning, loss of digits, neurological damage, and the loss of respiratory capacity.169  The \n \n166 Faiveley Transp.

Earlier this month, the \nDistrict of Maryland recognized that “once COVID-19 is introduced into a detention facility, it \nspreads  like  wildfire,”  creating  “a  high  likelihood  of  irreparable  health  consequences”  for \nincarcerated people “that could not be alleviated without release.”171  The court explained that \nplacing incarcerated people with COVID-19 symptoms in isolation “does not remove the risk that \nthe virus will spread quickly once inside the facility,” which creates an increased “risk of death or \nserious  illness”  for  “high-risk  detainees,”  like  those  members  of  the  Medically  Vulnerable \nSubclasses.172   \nThis risk is even more apparent when, as here, correctional settings have not adopted the \nmitigation efforts recommended by the CDC.  For instance, the Western District of New York \nobserved that when facilities do not “isolate higher risk individuals,” do not test “all incoming \ndetainees or the staff that comes and goes” for COVID-19, do not provide prisoners with masks or \nother PPE, and allow prisoners to “eat their meals in communal settings and share bathing \nfacilities,” the “imminent risk” to prisoners’ “health, safety, and lives” constitutes irreparable \n \n170 Compl. ¶¶ 23–70; see also supra at Section I.

Plaintiffs  are  Substantially  Likely  to  Prevail  on  Their  Claim  that  the \nGovernment is Deliberately Indifferent to their Serious Medical Needs. \nThe Post-adjudication Class’ claim in Count 3 of the Complaint presents the Court with \nthe question of whether a failure to take medically necessary steps to prevent widespread COVID-\n19 infection in Connecticut prisons constitutes deliberate indifference to serious medical need.  \nThe evidence demonstrates that Plaintiffs will prevail. \n“[W]hen the state takes a person into custody” pursuant to a sentence of incarceration, thus \n“severely limiting his ability to care for himself, and then is deliberately indifferent to his medical \nneeds, the Eighth Amendment’s proscription against the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain \nis violated.”175  The same constitutional right exists for pretrial detainees and civil detainees, \nalthough their protection springs from the Fourteenth Amendment and does not depend on a \ndefendant’s awareness of the danger’s existence.176   \nIn the case of either class of incarcerated people, a plaintiff “must show that the conditions, \neither alone or in combination, pose an unreasonable risk of serious damage to his health.”177  The \nunreasonable risk is actionable whether it results in damage occurring at the time of pleading, or, \n \n173 Jones v.

COVID-19 is a Lethal Threat to Human Health, as are the Pathogenic \nBreeding Conditions in the Defendants’ Prisons and Jails. \nFirst, Defendants cannot traverse the objective inquiry common to both Classes: that \nCOVID infection poses an unreasonable risk of serious harm to health.  Plaintiffs’ medical \nevidence, and common sense, demonstrate that the risk that Plaintiffs seek to avoid “is not one that \ntoday’s society chooses to tolerate.”182   \nMedical experts are in unanimous agreement that COVID-19 is an unprecedented, and \nunprecedentedly dangerous, mix of contagious and fatal, and doubly so for those locked inside \ncells.183 Further, there is no question, as Dr. Golob attests, that medically vulnerable people or \nthose over age 50 “are at grave risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19.”184  Not \n \n178 Helling v.

By Refusing to Protect Class Members from COVID-19, the Defendants are \nPunishing the Pre-adjudication Class in Violation of Substantive Due Process. \n   Lastly, the Pre-adjudication Class raises in Counts 1 and 2 of the Complaint, and has amply \ndemonstrated, that Defendants’ inaction in the face of the pandemic constitutes punishment to \nwhich they—as pretrial detainees—may not be subjected. \nThe Substantive Due Process Clause guarantees that “a detainee may not be punished prior \nto an adjudication of guilt in accordance with due process of law.”195  When deciding whether \nchallenged conditions of confinement amount to punishment, courts ask “whether the [restriction] \nis imposed for the purpose of punishment or whether it is but an incident of some other legitimate \ngovernmental purpose.”196  If a restriction or condition is not reasonably related to a legitimate \ngoal, the court “may infer that the purpose of the government action is punishment that may not \nconstitutionally be inflicted upon detainees qua detainees.”197   \nHere, the conditions of confinement imposed on Plaintiffs and other pretrial detainees at \nDOC  facilities  amount  to  punishment  because  the  conditions  place  those  detainees  at  a \nsignificantly  increased  risk  of  COVID-19  and  are  not  reasonably  related  to  any  legitimate \ngovernment objective.  As discussed above, DOC facilities place detainees at an even greater and \nimmediate risk of contracting COVID-19 than members of the public-at-large.  Yet, the current \nconditions of confinement fail to protect Plaintiffs and pretrial detainees from this risk.

Without a Viable Way to Safely Detain Plaintiffs, Injunctive Relief Releasing \nMedically Vulnerable Class Members Is the Only Option.  \nAs outlined in both the Giftos and Rich declarations, the medical standard of care to reduce \nthe risk of death from COVID-19 to vulnerable people is the transfer of the Medically Vulnerable \nSubclasses and additional Class Members to alternative custody such as home confinement.  Such \nremediation also creates physical distancing for those remaining in prisons.202  In addition to the \nimmediate release of all Medically Vulnerable Subclass Members, the DOC must provide the \nadditional conditions outlined by the CDC (e.g., physical distancing, quarantine, hygiene, medical \ncare, personal protective equipment, public health information, etc.); including granting further \nrelease for additional class members to ensure sufficient physical distancing, if public health \nexpertise so requires.  \nWith more than 11,000 incarcerated people in DOC facilities across the state, over 300 \nDOC employees already infected, the general unavailability of personal protective equipment and \nhygienic supplies for both staff and incarcerated people, and the difficulty implementing social \nand physical distancing for incarcerated people and employees, DOC  cannot do the things \nnecessary to protect incarcerated people, employees, and the larger Connecticut community \nagainst the racing spread of COVID-19.  Thus, (1) immediate release of the most medically \nvulnerable persons, followed by (2) frequent reporting, improved health protocols, and—if public \nhealth still mandates—(3) further release of additional Class Members, are the necessary and least \nintrusive  means  of  vindicating  Class  Members’  constitutional  rights  and  preventing  grave \nirreparable harm for the proposed Classes and the greater Connecticut community. \n \n202 Giftos Decl. ¶¶ 26–28 (“There are too many structural limitations [in correctional facilities to keep \npeople safe], and correctional health care can only do so much.  Decreasing the incarcerated population . . \n. is the only way to prevent the complications from surging.”); Rich Decl. ¶¶ 16–17 (“It is my strong opinion \nthat  urgent  decarceration  is  imperative  to  flatten  the  curve  of  Covid-19  cases  among  incarcerated \npopulations.”).   \n34 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43   Filed 05/10/20   Page 41 of 47\n \nDespite the unquestionable risk posed by COVID-19 to Plaintiffs, Class Members, and by \nextension, the public at large and its healthcare providers who will be required to care for more \nand more incarcerated people who become seriously ill from COVID-19, Defendants have not \ntaken such steps.  These facts easily support “an inference of deliberate indifference.”   \nE.  The Balance of Equities Favors Granting Relief to the Proposed Classes. \nWhen weighing the balance of equities, this Court “must consider the effect on each party \nof the granting or withholding of the requested relief.”203  In this dispute, the balance of equities \nweighs heavily in favor of granting Plaintiffs relief, as an injunction in their favor will not \n“substantially injure other interested parties.”204   \nRather, given the nature of the circumstances here and the COVID-19 pandemic in general, \nnot issuing preliminary relief would cause significant injury to the parties and the general public.  \nBeyond the fact that “[t]he balance of the equities tips sharply” in favor of Plaintiffs and the \nProposed Classes, especially given that they face “irreparable harm to their constitutional rights \nand health,”205 the public interest clearly favors granting preliminary relief because Connecticut \nas a whole escapes further COVID-19 spread by stamping out each infection hotspot wherever it \nmay occur.   \nBy contrast, Defendants’ countervailing interest in indefinitely detaining Plaintiffs and the \nProposed Classes in obviously dangerous conditions is weak, at best.  State officials already have \nshown a willingness to release other prisoners in an effort to stem the spread of coronavirus.  There \nis no compelling or even rational reason to deny the same treatment to these incarcerated people, \n \n203 Amoco Production Co. v. Vill. of Gambell, 480 U.S. 531, 542 (1987).   \n204 Doe v.

Indeed, Defendants could undertake a particularized inquiry to identify and release \nthose who are at increased risk of serious complications from COVID-19, and to the extent \ncountervailing  penal  interests  favor  continued  incarceration  for  certain  at-risk  individuals, \nDefendants could release other individuals to reduce population at DOC facilities and allow those \nwho remain to comply with CDC guidelines.206  Further, other than the administrative burden of \nenacting requested policies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 throughout DOC—which, frankly, \nDefendants should already be doing—there is no other “harm” to Defendants should this Court \nissue preliminary relief. \nAny burden on Defendants is far outweighed by what is at stake for Plaintiffs, the Proposed \nClasses, and the public-at-large should preliminary relief be denied.  People are dying.  This Court \nshould do its part to help prevent Plaintiffs and the Proposed Classes from becoming another \nstatistic in this horrific chapter of our nation’s history. \nF.  The Public Interest Is Best Served by Minimizing the Spread of COVID-19 \nthrough  Social  Distancing  and  Hygiene  Practices,  but  Those  Steps  Are \nDifficult to Implement at DOC Facilities. \nFinally, the public’s interest weighs in favor of granting Plaintiffs’ injunction.  As in this \ncase, where Plaintiffs have demonstrated that Defendants have violated their and the Proposed \nClasses’ constitutional rights, injunctive relief always is in the public interest.207  That interest—\nfaithful enforcement of the Constitution—alone justifies the requested injunctive relief.  Moreover, \n \n206 To this end, Plaintiffs seek release of all members of the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses.  If Defendants \nseek to retain individual class members in custody for a purported penal interest, the Court should require \nDefendants to offer proof of judicially-recorded findings—by clear and convincing evidence—that the \nindividual poses such a serious risk of flight or danger to others that no conditions of release can mitigate.  \n207 See Sajous v. Decker, 2018 WL 2357266, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. May 23, 2018) (“The public interest is best \nserved by ensuring the constitutional rights of persons within the United States are upheld.”) (citing Mitchell \nv.

With no vaccine or cure, each new infection breeds \nexponentially more infected persons.  Healthcare professionals accordingly agree that the most \ncritical actions that can be taken are preventive measures such as self-isolating, maintaining a \ndistance of six feet from other persons, and frequent disinfection.  These measures are lacking at \nDOC facilities, as detailed above, thus warranting immediate action from this Court.  But even \nwith the best intentions, high-risk persons like members of the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses \ncannot avoid the risk of infection.  The only viable mitigation tactic for those incarcerated people \nis release.   \nThe virus is spreading throughout the incarcerated population and cannot be contained \nwithin DOC’s walls.  COVID-19 has already spread across DOC staff members who have contact \nwith communities outside of the DOC.210  Cases of infected staff members will only increase while \nthe contagion sweeps throughout the prisoner population.  DOC staff has and will continue to, \nperhaps unknowingly, spread infection among the surrounding communities.  The only certain \nway to significantly hinder further spread of the virus within DOC facilities—and then from DOC \n \n208 See Grand River Enters. Six Nations, Ltd. v.

Recent data show that in the most \nlikely infection scenarios, Connecticut hospitals will face a critical bed shortage in a matter of \nweeks.211  A large-scale infection at DOC will cause spillover into supporting hospitals, not to \nmention increase the number of sick individuals in the community needing prompt and critical \nmedical care.212  The public interest is best served by taking all necessary steps to reduce infection, \nslow the spread of the virus, and provide all necessary and available support to prevent the collapse \nof the Connecticut hospital network. \nFinally, it cannot be overstated that the public interest is served by protecting those at \nelevated risk and with particular medical vulnerabilities from the ruthless nature of the virus.  On \nthe whole, populations like those detained at DOC face heightened risk of exposure and infection \nbecause of overcrowding and other problems existing at every detention facility across the country; \nsuch risks are even higher for the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses.  And the risk is not limited \nonly to incarcerated people, given the close proximity with which DOC staff members interact \nwith DOC population.  The release of individuals most vulnerable to COVID-19 thus reduces the \noverall health risk for DOC prisoners and staff alike.  By decreasing the number of prisoners, DOC \ncan institute greater and safer social distancing practices and prevent the need for increased \n \n211 Alex Putterman & Emily Brindley, Connecticut’s COVID-19 Peak Could be Two Weeks Away; The \nState Won’t Have Enough Hospital Beds or ICU Options When That Happens, Model Predicts, HARTFORD \nCOURANT (Apr. 3, 2020), available at https://bit.ly/3a2e6Ji. \n212 See Williams Aff. ¶ 4, 17 (explaining that in a world-wide pandemic, “correctional health is public \nhealth,” and thus, “The Entire Community is at Risk if Prison Populations Are Not Reduced”).   \n38 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43   Filed 05/10/20   Page 45 of 47\n \nnumbers of staff on a given shift.  Immediate release of the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses thus \nnot  only  imposes  minimal  harm  to  the  government,  it  also  furthers  the  public  interest  in \nmaintaining a healthy and orderly environment throughout this crisis. \nUnsurprisingly, courts acknowledge the weighty public interest when granting injunctive \nrelief where incarcerated people face similarly grave threats to their health.  At bottom, “[t]he \npublic has a critical interest in preventing the further spread of the coronavirus.”213  Further \noutbreak at DOC facilities, like the detention center in Castillo, would “endanger all of us—[the \nfacility] detainees, [the facility] employees, residents [of the surrounding community], residents \nof the State . . . , and our nation as a whole,”214 and would “quickly overwhelm the already strained \nhealth infrastructure within the facility,” given the drastic health staff vacancies, “which would \nthen  place  strain  on  the  surrounding  community  hospitals.”215    Decreasing  the  DOC’s \npopulation—particularly by ordering immediate release of the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses—\nwould mean that “the tinderbox scenario of a large cohort of people getting sick all at once is less \nlikely to occur, and the peak volume of patients hitting the community hospital would level out.”216  \nThis Court should follow suit and take immediate action to minimize the spread of COVID-19 \nthroughout the DOC and the Connecticut community. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should grant the proposed Classes’ Petition for writs \nof habeas corpus and grant the proposed Classes’ request for an injunction against Defendants: \n \n213 Castillo v.

That tragedy will have far-reaching effects not only for the \nthousands of Connecticut residents who live and work in correctional facilities, their families and \ncommunities, but also for the population of the state as a whole. Connecticut’s healthcare system \nsimply does not have the capacity to treat a massive outbreak in the incarcerated population at the \nsame time as it treats patients throughout the rest of the state. As jails and prisons become \nflashpoints for infection, the outbreak will overwhelm already limited state healthcare resources.  \n \nConnecticut has days, not weeks, to chart a different future. Under current conditions, in \nwhich there is no cure and no widespread testing, the thousands of Connecticut residents who live \nand work in correctional facilities are simply unable to practice the most effective method of \nprevention: social distancing. To create the requisite spacing of 6 feet between individuals, the \nState must (a) rapidly decrease the density of its prisons, jails, and halfway houses and (b) \n  1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-1   Filed 05/10/20   Page 3 of 6\nimplement humane and evidence-based approaches to protect the health of incarcerated individuals \nand staff alike. Success is possible but will require coordinated, urgent action among all relevant \nagencies, including the Department of Correction, the judiciary, the Chief State’s Attorney, law \nenforcement, the Department of Public Health, and the Connecticut Department of Housing. We \ncall upon you to use the full powers of your office to lead the way through this public health \nemergency.  \n \nI.  The Public Health Perspective \nCOVID-19 is a highly infectious disease. Due to its novelty, there exist few tools for \ncontainment and even fewer for treatment. The scientific community currently lacks a vaccine or \ncure. Neither the United States nor the state of Connecticut possesses sufficient resources to screen \nor test individuals, and projections show that, absent extreme intervention, infections will rapidly \noutpace available healthcare resources. We commend that your office has already taken decisive \naction to limit exposure among most state residents by ordering one of the few proven prevention \nmethods:  social  distancing.  As  already  seen  in  the  reduced  rates  of  new  infections,  social \ndistancing works. \nUnfortunately,  effective  social  distancing  is  impossible  under  typical  conditions  in \nConnecticut’s correctional facilities. In Connecticut’s jails and lower security level prisons, \nincarcerated people sleep within feet of each other and use communal bathrooms, mess halls, \ndayrooms, and showers. Even in maximum security facilities, many people are double-celled and \nshare spaces to eat, bathe, and recreate. Further, while the Department of Correction has already \ntaken important actions, such as suspending visitors and volunteers, there is still a steady flow of \npeople  into  and  among  facilities.  Staff,  officers,  contractors,  and  vendors  are  still  moving \nthroughout and between facilities and they all link the facilities with surrounding communities. \nThese individuals can introduce the virus into the facility or contract it themselves and transmit it \nto others in the community. \nThe Department of Correction has stated that it is employing standard measures used to \ncontain other communicable diseases, such as the flu, but these are inadequate in the face of the \nnovel coronavirus. COVID-19 is estimated to be nearly 3 times more contagious than the flu and \nis deadlier. Furthermore, we are learning more about this novel coronavirus every day and it is \nbecoming increasingly clear that a significant percent of infections are transmitted by people even \nbefore they develop symptoms, meaning that there is no screening practice (checking temperatures \nor asking about symptoms) that is adequate. Additionally, whereas the flu is transmitted only by \nlarge droplets (i.e., 6 feet of distancing protects people), COVID-19 is now known to be passed in \nthe air as well. Under these circumstances, even heightened hygiene practices—frequent washing \nof hands with soap, regular bleaching and disinfection of public surfaces, and the like—are \ninsufficient. Further, proper containment and treatment of the novel coronavirus will require \nfacilities to quarantine people and will surely put a strain on the already understaffed healthcare \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-1   Filed 05/10/20   Page 4 of 6\nsystem in the Department of Correction. At Yale-New Haven Hospital, we have already seen that \nas more people have become sick, staff have become sick as well, and we are struggling to develop \nadequate staffing plans. Sick individuals will need to be sent to community-based hospitals, which \nthemselves are already struggling to provide adequate care to others.  \nWhile more must be done in the coming weeks and months, as a starting point, we suggest \nthe following immediate actions:  \n  1. To the maximum extent possible, reduce the number of people entering and re-\nentering the system. We applaud the state for already making efforts to mitigate dangers in this \narea, as announced in the Department of Correction’s March 24 release. Police and State’s \nAttorneys should decline to arrest or prosecute individuals except where an individual poses a \nserious threat to public safety. Parole officers should halt the reincarceration of people on technical \nparole violations.  \n  2. Immediately release, to the maximum extent possible, people detained pretrial. As \nof today, we estimate that there are 2,905 unsentenced (mostly pretrial) people in custody, 95 of \nwhom are 60 or older. For the duration of the pandemic, people should be presumptively released \non personal recognizance, absent a showing of a compelling threat to public safety. \n  3. Immediately release all people convicted of nonviolent offenses who are scheduled \nto  be  released  in  90  days,  all  people  who  are  eligible  for  parole  and  community \nsupervision/release, and anyone incarcerated for a technical parole, probation violation, or \nconditional discharge. As of today, we estimate that there are 4,112 people in custody with fewer \nthan 90 days left on their sentences, 201 of whom are 60 or older. Additionally, we estimate that \n1,503 people are currently in custody for violation of probation or conditional discharge, 51 of \nwhom are 60 or older. The state should continue to exercise the use of transitional supervision \nmore aggressively to facilitate the release of people with shorter sentences. Additionally, the \nConnecticut Board of Pardons and Parole should expedite the release of people already found \nsuitable for release on parole, expedite all review processes for people eligible for parole, exercise \nits power to commute sentences, and use its discretion to grant compassionate parole release. The \nBoard should refrain, however, from requiring transitional housing as part of that process, in order \nto prevent the spread of COVID-19 within these congregate settings.  \n  The advantage of releasing the populations outlined above lies in the fact that most have \nspent less time incarcerated and are more likely to have maintained social bonds with their \ncommunities outside of prison. Their families and communities are better equipped to aid them in \nself-quarantine than are prisons, jails, and halfway houses. Individuals who fit the above criteria \nfor release should be screened to determine if they have somewhere to live in the community where \nthey can self-isolate if necessary. Individuals with such available housing should be prioritized for \nimmediate release. \n  3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-1   Filed 05/10/20   Page 5 of 6\n  We note that the goal here is to thin the incarcerated population—by the most expeditious \nmeans possible, including releasing the healthy—to allow for social distancing. In some cases, \nsick individuals may have a more difficult time finding a safe place to live upon release, not least \nbecause of the lack of medical capacity in the state.  \n  We are very appreciative of the significant efforts you have already made to ensure people \nwho are released have safe accommodations in the community, and to ensure that no one is \nreleased to homelessness.  \n  4.  Transition  older  adults  and  medically  vulnerable  individuals  to  medical  and \ncommunity settings. Finally, we note that U.S. Attorney General William Barr, in response to \nrequests from Congress for a plan to mitigate the risk of widespread COVID-19 infection in federal \nprisons, has recommended that the federal Bureau of Prisons release certain at-risk individuals—\nincluding individuals with certain medical conditions and individuals over 60 years old. We agree \nthat this would be a worthy step to pursue in Connecticut, but we also emphasize that time is of \nthe essence here. We do not yet have a COVID-19 outbreak in our correctional facilities, but we \nmust act now to thin these populations out, social distance, and attempt to prevent one. That means \nreleasing whoever can be released most quickly and safely now. The next step would be to address \nthese  at-risk  populations.  Many  of  the  people  who  are  most  vulnerable  will  also  be  more \nchallenging to discharge: those without housing and those who, due to medical complexity, require \nmore  comprehensive  medical  discharge  planning.  The  state  must  nonetheless  work  toward \nreleasing older adults and other medically vulnerable inmates, who pose the least public safety risk \nand are most at-risk of COVID-19 complications. To that end, we, the Yale Transitions Clinic, \nhave created a hotline that DOC reentry coordinators and medical discharge planners can use to \nrefer people to us, and we will figure out the medical discharge follow-up. \nWe are eager to work with your office to facilitate any of these critical efforts for the public \nhealth of our state.

My name is Pattikate Williams-Void, and I am sixty-two years old. \n2.  I have hypertension, and I also have post-traumatic stress disorder that raises my \nblood pressure.  I am borderline diabetic. \n3.  I am being held at the York Correctional Institution in Niantic, Connecticut on a \nbond. \n4.  I have been here since March 6, 2020. \n5.  I was supposed to have a court date in my case on April 9th, but it was canceled \nand the court has not set a new date. \n6.  I am housed in 4 South, which is a medical unit, where I sleep in a room with one \nother person; my room contains a sink, a toilet, and a shower. \n7.  When we are in our beds, each person is less than six feet from the other. \n8.  My room is cleaned every two weeks.  I am not able to get any disinfectant to \nclean any more frequently. \n9.  The common areas are cleaned once a day.  I do not drink out of the water \nfountains because I do not think that they are clean.  I wipe the telephone down \nwith a rag before I use it because I do not think it has been cleaned. \n10.  The correctional officers do not regularly wear masks.  Some nurses wear masks \nand some don’t. \n11.  My unit has been locked down because of the COVID virus, and we only get \naround fifteen minutes outside of our rooms each day depending on which \ncorrectional officer is working that day. \n12.  I have to eat all of my meals in my room. \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-3   Filed 05/10/20   Page 3 of 3\n13.  Although we are supposed to each have fifteen minutes to use the telephones, we \nhave been forced to split one fifteen minute shift between everyone who gets out \nto make a call that day. \n14.  There are people who have been taken into my unit for fourteen-day quarantine \nbecause they are suspected of having the virus.   \n15.  After my lawyer filed this lawsuit, medical staff began to take my temperature \nevery day.  Before that, they were not doing so.  \n16.  I make these statements under the penalties of perjury, and I would testify to \nthem in court if I were called to do so. \n17.

I have been incarcerated at Corrigan-Radgowski Correctional Institution \nsince March 22, 2019. I am 26 years old. I am housed in B pod of the Corrigan building. \nTo my knowledge, there are 82 or 83 people housed in my unit, on two tiers. \n2.  Our facility has been on lockdown for 16 days. We get 30 minutes out of \nour cells per day. During that time, I have to choose between showering or making phone \ncalls.  \n3.  One other person lives in my cell. Our sleeping area is not cleaned or \nsanitized by staff. I was given one small medicine cup of cleaner and a few paper towels, \nonce, to clean out my cell over the past 16 days. Correctional officers also passed out a \nsmall bar of soap per person about a week ago. \n4.  They are now cleaning the railings. But every time I come out of my cell, I \nsupposed to put my hands up against the wall, and they don’t clean the walls. And there’s \nno sink out here to wash your hands.  \n5.  I eat my meals in in my cell. Since we’ve been on lockdown, trash has \nbeen piling up outside our cell doors. Some staff will let people out to clean, but others \nuse cleaning as a bargaining tool.  \n6.  I do not have a shower in my cell. I share showers with the other 82 or 83 \npeople housed in my unit. I also share 9 phones with everyone in the unit. They just \nstarted having a laundry worker or tierman (unit worker) rub down the phones between \npeople. But when you use the phones, you’re right next to the next person.  \n7.  Within the last week, more staff have started to wear blue masks. It seems \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-4   Filed 05/10/20   Page 3 of 4\n \nlike it is at their discretion—some people were wearing masks and some weren’t. I don’t \nknow if staff temperatures are being checked. Our temperatures have not been checked.  \n8.  One person in my block got sick and he was quarantined in his cell for 14 \ndays. His cellmate was also quarantined in there with him. They weren’t allowed out, \neven to take a shower. At the end of the 14 days, they took the temperature of the first \nperson and he went to medical. They didn’t test his cellmate or do anything like that. \nThey then moved them both to another cell, together, four cells down.   \n9.  Nobody in my block has been sent to Northern yet. Northern is a punitive, \nthreatening place. I’ve never been there. I know that people with symptoms will be afraid \nto say anything because god forbid you get transferred to Northern.  \n10.  I have asthma and stomach issues. Medical care here is really poor. In \nnormal days, you’ll submit a request and it will take between two weeks and a month to \nget it back. Then you will be seen within two or three weeks. I dropped in a request for \nmy friend recently that said it was urgent and he has yet to be seen.  \n11.  Since June of last year, I’ve been writing requests to medical to be seen \nfor severe stomach pain and certain foods that set me off. I was just put on an antibiotic \nyesterday.  \n12.  I want to give credit where credit is due. We are getting our two extra \nphone calls from Securus, and commissary gave out extra envelopes. But what’s \nhappening inside does not line up with what they are saying. I hear them talking about \ncleaning all shifts—that’s definitely not happening. I am now on a hunger strike with five \nother people in my unit. They are striking for better conditions and better medical care. I \nfeel like if people on the outside are advocating for us, we should do our part. DOC staff \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-4   Filed 05/10/20   Page 4 of 4\n \nhave now threatened to take our commissary and our food for not taking our trays.  \n13.  It feels like we’re being punished because DOC had no adequate measures \nin place. We’ve been on lockdown for 16 days. It’s not good for anyone’s psychological \nwell-being. People are started to lose it. \n14.  I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I \nwould testify to the same statements above if called to do so in court. \n15.  I have authorized Elana Bildner to affix my signature to this affidavit for \nme, because I am incarcerated, and it would take a minimum of seven days for me to \nreceive a document in the mail, sign it in front of a notary, and return it by mail. \n \n  Executed this 17 day of April, 2020. \n \n                Thomas Caves_________ \n                by         ______________ \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-5   Filed 05/10/20   Page 1 of 4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT E \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-5   Filed 05/10/20   Page 2 of 4\nDeclaration of William Bruno \n \nI, William Bruno, declare as follows:\t\n1.  I have been incarcerated at Brooklyn Correctional Institution for almost four \nyears. I am fifty years old. I am housed in D Dorm of Brooklyn CI. To my \nknowledge, there are 114 people housed in my dorm. \n2.  D Dorm has been in lockdown for about a month. The lockdown means that we \ndon’t leave D Dorm anymore to eat lunch with other dorms or to go to rec. We \nstill go outside once or twice per day. Other than that, we spend pretty much all of \nour time inside D Dorm.  \n3.  D Dorm is one big, open area. It has a single dayroom, which we can use from \n8:00am to 11:00pm every day. That means that all 114 of us are in the dayroom at \nonce. We play cards there and watch TV. Usually, we are about 1-2 feet away \nfrom each other. I have never been told by CDOC to “social distance” from other \npeople, or to keep 6-8 feet between me and every other person. Even if I was told \nto do that, it wouldn’t be possible because there is not enough space. I believe the \ntotal size of D Dorm is 120 feet by 65 feet. This includes sleeping areas and the \nday room, but not the showers. I believe these are the dimensions because the tiles \non the floor are each twelve-inch squares, and I counted the tiles.   \n4.  In D Dorm, we do not have cells. Instead, we sleep in “cubes.” “Cubes” are \nseparated from the day room by walls that are about eight feet high, and that leave \na gap of around six or seven feet between the top of the walls and the ceiling. \nEach cube sleeps six people on three bunk beds. When we sleep, we are probably \n2-3 feet apart from the people in the other bunks. There’s probably about an arm’s \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-5   Filed 05/10/20   Page 3 of 4\nlength between the people who share a bunk bed. These measurements are my \nbest guesses. \n5.  CDOC gave each of the prisoners in D Dorm two masks. The masks are made of \na tan cloth that looks to me kind of like the “inmate prison tans,” and are lined \nwith cotton. CDOC told us that we can use the masks at our own discretion. I only \nwear mine when I go out of D Dorm for medical visits, or when I am talking on \nthe phone. I don’t wear my mask when I am inside D Dorm. Most other prisoners \ndon’t either. I would guess that maybe 5% of people wear their masks when they \nare inside D Dorm. \n6.  The prison gives me soap. Usually, prisoners have to buy soap, but for about the \nlast three weeks, the prison has been giving us bars of soap for free. They have \ntold us to wash our hands often. I probably wash my hands a dozen times a day. I \nsee other people in D Dorm washing their hands often as well.   \n7.  D Dorm is cleaned three times per day by prison workers. They are supposed to \nclean the table tops too, but they can’t because they don’t have supplies. I clean \non the third shift. I am still expected to do my job right now. If I refused to work, \nI would probably be written up for that. \n8.  Most of the guards wear masks all of the time, but some do not. Their masks are \nblue, but I think they are made from the same material as ours. A lot of staff wear \ngloves. I also see them using hand sanitizer from machine dispensers. Prisoners \nare not allowed to use the dispensers. Staff have also told us that they have their \ntemperatures taken every day before they come into the prison. But I cannot \nverify that. \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-5   Filed 05/10/20   Page 4 of 4\n9.  I have been on medicine for Hepatitis C, so, luckily, I am allowed to go up to \nmedical every day. But for everyone else, it is taking longer than usual right now \nto get seen by medical. For example, we’ve been waiting for our flu shots for \nabout three months, and we still haven’t gotten them. The medical staff has told \nus that they haven’t had time to give us all flu shots because they have been busy \nwith other things. I do not know what the things are that they are busy with.  \n10. To my knowledge, I have not come into contact with anyone who has tested \npositive for coronavirus. I have not noticed anyone in my dorm with cough, fever, \ndiarrhea, nausea, and / or vomiting. But I have heard that so far there have been \nseven people in B Dorm who have symptoms.  \n11. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I would \ntestify to the same statements above if called to do so in court. \n12. I have authorized Sophia Angelis to affix my signature to this affidavit for me, \nbecause I am incarcerated, and it would take a minimum of seven days for me to \nreceive a document in the mail, sign it in front of a notary, and return it by mail.  \n \nExecuted this 14 day of April, 2020. \n \n                __W_i_ll_ia_m__ _B_r_u_n_o_`_____________ \n                by_________________________ \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-6   Filed 05/10/20   Page 1 of 6\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT F \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-6   Filed 05/10/20   Page 2 of 6\nDeclaration of Angel Caballero  \n \nI, Angel Caballero, declare as follows: \n1.  I have been incarcerated at Corrigan for a little over a year. I am 44 years \nold. I am housed in Bravo Pod (“B Pod”) of Corrigan Correctional Institution. To my \nknowledge, there are 96 people housed in my unit. \n2.  Our facility has been on lockdown since approximately April 1. That’s \nwhen I started keeping track. For a few days when the lockdown first began, we got 15 \nminutes out of our cell for rec. Beginning Friday, April 3rd we got no time out of cell for \na few days after COs got into an altercation with an inmate. \n3.  Now we get at most 30 minutes of rec. Outside of our cells. \n4.  During rec, inmates can either take a shower or use the phone. There’s \nusually no time for both. People have to choose between getting in touch with their loved \nones and taking a shower. If you’re not using the phone or the shower, then you can’t \ncome out of the cell. \n5.  On my pod, people are housed two-to-a-cell. They’re allowing six people \nto take rec at once, releasing six people from three cells at a time. My cellmate and have \nbeen taking rec with the same group of four inmates every weekday since at least April 5.  \n6.  Since April 5, I’ve been coming into contact with about 13 people daily. \nThis includes my cellmate, the four other inmates we encounter during rec, and then \napproximately eight different COs. There are four COs per shift, and they take three \nshifts every 24 hours. \n7.  I share my cell with one other person. It’s six feet by nine feet. We sleep \napproximately three feet apart. We sleep in a regular bunk; I’ve got the top bunk and he’s \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-6   Filed 05/10/20   Page 3 of 6\ngot the bottom. There are two chairs inside the cells so everything is really tight. The \nfurthest amount of distance that we can have between us while in the cell is nine feet. \nThat would require one person to sleep on the floor by the door. \n8.  COs pass our meals through the door. We eat all of our meals in our cell. \n9.  Inmate workers mop the dayroom, but it doesn’t seem to get very clean. \nThey’ll mop it once during the first shift and once during the second shift. They don’t \nusually mop during the third shift. The dayroom floors are only mopped sometimes. \nThere’s often still garbage left all over the tier. \n10.  We’ve been asking the COs for cleaning detergent and we haven’t gotten \nany. We’ve been asking for two weeks now, and they’ve only given us a bar of soap to \nwash our hands with. We have to use this bar of soap to clean our living quarters as well. \n11.  It’s a small bar of soap. I try to keep my cell clean by ripping pieces of \nfabric from my towel and using soap or shampoo to clean the floors. \n12.  The staff passed out soap on April 1st and on April 6th. They pass out a \nbar of soap about once a week. The last time I got soap was last week, the week of April \n13. \n13.  The staff passed out one mask April 1st and another mask about a week \nlater, on April 6th. The masks are made out of cloth. Today the COs exchanged our old \nmasks for new ones. I wash my mask every day using the bar of soap using the sink in \nmy cell. \n14.  Only some of the staff wear masks, and they only wear masks sometimes. \nThose that wear masks, wear masks made out of cloth. I don’t see staff members washing \ntheir hands regularly, and they don’t seem to carry hand sanitizer. They wear latex \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-6   Filed 05/10/20   Page 4 of 6\ngloves. \n15.  The inmates on our unit share six showers. They don’t clean the showers \nafter each use, and I don’t know how often the showers are cleaned.  \n16.  There are three phones per pole, and inmates can only stand about two feet \naway from each other when using the phones. The phones are not regularly cleaned. \nSometimes inmates will wipe the phone down with a paper towel between uses, and I \nknow that sometimes COs will direct an inmate worker to wipe the phone down using a \nwatered down solution.  \n17.  The staff has not provided medical services. I have several medical \nconditions: asthma, fatty liver disease, mild liver fibrosis, and high cholesterol. Since \nbeing at Corrigan, I have not received one of my preventative asthma medications. I have \nbeen trying to see a doctor for two months, and have filed a grievance. I still have not \nbeen able to see a doctor, and I have not gotten my preventative asthma medication. \n18.  At the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, we received a staff memo \nthat basically instructs us not to contact medical services unless we’re showing symptoms \nof COVID-19. \n19.  I understand that I’m at higher risk because of my asthma and other \nchronic health conditions. I have repeatedly asked multiple staff members--the warden, \nunit manager, my counselor, and lieutenants--what kind of precautions they’re taking for \npeople like me, who have asthma and health conditions. No one has given me a response. \n20.  There are two people on my tier who I believe have had COVID-19. They \nshare a cell and they began to get sick around April 2 or April 3. Since they began to get \nsick, they were forbidden to leave their cell. They were forbidden to shower, to make \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-6   Filed 05/10/20   Page 5 of 6\nphone calls, or to even clear the trash out of their cell. The only treatment that I could see \nis that a staff member would come in once per shift to take their temperature. They were \nin this isolation for two weeks, and have recently been released back onto the tier. \n21.  I regularly spoke to these guys when they were isolated in their cell. The \ncell in which they were isolated was very close to the phones. You could easily speak to \nthem through an opening at the bottom of the door. I know that one of the guys actually \ntested positive for coronavirus, and so I assume that his cellmate also had it. \n22.  I spoke to the COs about their bad treatment of these sick guys. I argued \nthat those guys should get showers, and that what the COs were doing was wrong. No \none made any changes.  \n23.  I have not been tested for coronavirus, and as far as I know, no one else on \nthe tier has been. \n24.  I am very stressed because I don’t want to get sick. I have asthma so I’m \nat risk, and I don’t want to bring anything home to my moms and get her sick. When I \nask staff members what they’re doing to protect us, they tell me not to worry about it \nbecause I’m getting out in about 30 days. I don’t want to go home in a body bag. \n25.  I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I \nwould testify to the same statements above if called to do so in court. \n26.  I have authorized Faith Barksdale to affix my signature to this affidavit for \nme, because I am incarcerated, and it would take a minimum of seven days for me to \nreceive a document in the mail, sign it in front of a notary, and return it by mail. \n \n  Executed this 22 day of April, 2020. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-6   Filed 05/10/20   Page 6 of 6\n \n                s/Angel Caballero____________ \n                by Faith Barksdale______________ \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-7   Filed 05/10/20   Page 1 of 4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT G \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-7   Filed 05/10/20   Page 2 of 4\n \nDeclaration of Marcus Champagne \n \n1.  I, Marcus Champagne, declare as follows: \n2.  I have been incarcerated at Hartford Correctional Center (HCC) since February 20th, \n2020. I am 24 years old. I am housed in Dorm 4 of HCC. To my knowledge, there are \n120 people housed in my unit, 60 on each side. \n3.  I have severe asthma, and multiple immune disorders (psoriasis, eczema, and \nalopecia). \n4.  Our facility has been on lockdown every day for about a month. During this period of \nlockdown, I can only leave the dorm to shower and use the phone. \n5.  I sleep approximately 4 feet above and approximately 4 feet away from the people in \nthe next beds over. Our sleeping area is not cleaned or sanitized by staff. Two inmates \nhave left to go to medical with fevers and the staff did not wipe down their areas. We \ndo not get provided cleaning supplies other than two bars of soap in the past month. \nMost recently, we received a bar of soap on April 13th, 2020. \n6.  I eat my meals in my dorm, and the CO who passes them out doesn’t wear gloves or a \nmask. \n7.  I share 4 showers with approximately 60 other people. The showers are not sanitized, \nthey are only cleaned with hot water. \n8.  Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, I have observed staff re-using gloves \nand gloves and failing to wear masks. CO’s have told me that they are scared, \nbecause they are not provided with masks and have to bring their own. They haven’t \nbeen able to find enough at stores. \n9.  Staff have provided me with one mask made out of cloth. The vast majority of \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-7   Filed 05/10/20   Page 3 of 4\n \ninmates have been wearing the same cloth mask for the past 2 weeks without washing \nit. \n10. I have come into contact with someone in my facility who has tested positive for the \ncoronavirus. The prison staff did not go through proper precautions to clean \nafterward. They sprayed his bunk one time with water, but no bleach. In addition, \npeople have been sick and asking to go to medical and have been denied. I’ve seen 3 \nor 4 people sick with coronavirus symptoms, and only 2 have gone to medical. One of \nthose people had been asking repeatedly for the entire day. Both of the people who \nhave been to medical didn’t come back to the dorm.  \n11. Right now, I am sleeping two bunks away from someone who tested positive for \nCOVID-19 and was sent to Northern, then moved back to Hartford CC after two \ndays. He was quarantined at Hartford for 16 days, he told me. I feel nervous about \nsleeping so close to someone who tested positive. \n12. I feel like I’m a lab rat trapped in a small place waiting to get sick. \n13. The Commissioner has been saying that the CO’s are getting the proper amount of \ngloves and disinfectants, but from what I see, they’re not getting anything at all. \n14. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I would \ntestify to the same statements above if called to do so in court. \n15.

To my knowledge, there are \n6 people housed on my tier.  \n3.  Approximately 40-50 people were transferred into my unit as a whole around early April. \nI was given a new cell-mate who was transferred in, but he was transferred to a different \ncell after one day. I was told he would be placed back in my cell again if he was found to \nbe on special parole. Since then he has been transferred back to my cell. \n4.  I have a heart condition called Supraventricular tachycardia as well as a right branch \nbundle blockage, and I have to take heart medication twice daily. \n5.  I get recreation one hour per day Monday through Friday. Sometimes they cheat you and \nonly give you 40 minutes. I get rec in an individual cage. There are three individual cages \nseparated by fences with holes in them, and when they first started taking coronavirus \nseriously, they left the middle cage empty. Since they have started getting more transfers, \nthey have been filling up all the cages again. I would be close enough to touch the person \nin the next cage over if there wasn’t a fence. I do not go to rec with the same people \nevery day, sometimes it’s people from other tiers. \n6.  The conditions here at Northern are brutal. I saw an inmate being assaulted by two \ncorrectional officers. The inmate was escorted by one officer and when he reached the \nblind spot, where the camera couldn’t see them, the other officer joined in and they beat \nhim. He couldn’t defend himself because he had his hands cuffed behind him. I had to \nwalk to end to the shower because I didn’t want to view the image anymore. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-8   Filed 05/10/20   Page 3 of 5\n \n7.  I do not have a cellmate. My cell is not cleaned nor sanitized by staff. We are each \nprovided a dustpan, broom, lemonall, and some paper towels. They give you one small \nstyrofoam cup of lemonall two times a week, which is double from before the \ncoronavirus, but it’s still not enough to clean every time a correctional officer enters my \ncell. \n8.  I eat my meals in my cell. \n9.  The water is not drinkable here. I don’t drink it because it bothers my stomach a lot. \nOther inmates have told me it’s been like this for a long time. I only drink the milk and \norange juice provided to me. \n10. The staff do not provide us with soap. I asked for soap and was denied, I was told that I \nhave to be indigent to be provided with soap. When I’ve needed soap in the past two \nweeks, I’ve gotten it from the commissary for a fee. I do not have access to hand \nsanitizer. \n11. I do not have a shower in my cell. I share a shower with approximately 20 other people, \nincluding people on my tier, people from neighboring tiers, and the inmates who are \nallowed to clean the building. I also share 4 phones with half of the facility. \n12. Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, I have observed staff wearing masks. They \nhave said they check temperatures of staff members before they come in but I have no \nway to confirm this. \n13. Staff have not provided me with guidance about how to protect myself and others from \ncoronavirus transmission. They just gave notice that we would have to use the phones \nfaster and have two people at a time in the rec cages instead of three – though that lasted \nonly a week before they started filling the middle cage again. They have provided me \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-8   Filed 05/10/20   Page 4 of 5\n \nwith one mask made out cloth of in approximately the beginning of April. \n14. We have been requesting that they clean the ventilation systems because we all share the \nsame air. Prisoners from Corrigan came to clean Northern around March 22 , 2020, but \nnd\nthey did not clean the ventilation. We have not gotten any response about cleaning the \nventilation. \n15. When I seek treatment for a medical condition, it usually takes me a week to two weeks \nto see a doctor. Sometimes if it’s really urgent you can request to be pulled out of your \ncell right away, but they get to decide how urgent it is. I requested treatment for two \nconfirmed cavities, and was supposed to get treatment in February, but it still hasn’t \nhappened. \n16. There have been a few times that they haven’t had my heart medications, but they marked \nit as me refusing my medication in their records. This has happened before and after the \npandemic. I had a doctor I really liked who prescribed the heart medication for me to \nhave in my cell with me, because it’s important for my health. But he has been gone since \nmid-March, and I no longer have my medication in my cell with me. \n17. They are no longer running mental health groups at Northern. There is really no mental \nhealth counseling happening anymore unless someone writes to a mental health counselor \nasking to be pulled out of their cell because they are imminently suicidal. There is also a \nbuzzer to press but no one really answers those. \n18. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I would testify to \nthe same statements above if called to do so in court. \n19. I have authorized Madeline Batt to affix my signature to this affidavit for me, because I \nam incarcerated, and it would take a minimum of seven days for me to receive a \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-8   Filed 05/10/20   Page 5 of 5\n \ndocument in the mail, sign it in front of a notary, and return it by mail. \n \n  Executed this 21  day of April, 2020. \nst\n \n                Alex Flemming________________ \n                by        ______________ \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-9   Filed 05/10/20   Page 1 of 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT I \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-9   Filed 05/10/20   Page 2 of 3\n(cid:0)\n(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:18)(cid:9)(cid:5)(cid:4)(cid:19)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:20)(cid:8)(cid:0)\n(cid:0)\n(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:28)(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:31) (cid:0)!\"#$%&\"’((cid:24)(cid:0)) $#(cid:30)& (cid:0)(cid:30)’(cid:0)*+##+(cid:29)’,(cid:0)\n&)\n-(cid:22)(cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:30).(cid:0)$(cid:28)&& (cid:31)(#(cid:26)(cid:0)\"(cid:31)$(cid:30)&$ &(cid:30)( )(cid:0)(cid:30)((cid:0)/&\")0 1+&((cid:0)2+&& $(\"+(cid:31)(cid:30)#(cid:0)2 (cid:31)( &(cid:24)(cid:0)(cid:29)% & (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)%(cid:30)3 (cid:0)4  (cid:31)(cid:0)\n\"(cid:31)$(cid:30)&$ &(cid:30)( )(cid:0)’\"(cid:31)$ (cid:0)5 $(cid:0)-6(cid:24)(cid:0)-7(cid:21)8(cid:22)(cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:30).(cid:0)-9(cid:0)(cid:26) (cid:30)&’(cid:0)+#)(cid:22)(cid:0)\n6(cid:22)(cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)#\"3 (cid:0)\"(cid:31)(cid:0):+&(%(cid:0);\"(cid:31)0(cid:0)\"(cid:31)(cid:0)/ )(cid:0)2(cid:21)6(cid:22)(cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)#\"3 (cid:0)\"(cid:31)(cid:0)(cid:30)(cid:0))+&.(cid:0)(cid:29)\"(%(cid:0)(cid:30)4+(cid:28)((cid:0)9<(cid:0)4(cid:28)(cid:31)=’(cid:24)(cid:0)-(cid:0)1 +1# (cid:0)1 &(cid:0)\n4(cid:28)(cid:31)=(cid:22)(cid:0)(cid:25)% (cid:26)(cid:0)(cid:29) & (cid:0)*(cid:28)##(cid:0)(cid:28)(cid:31)(\"#(cid:0)(cid:30)&+(cid:28)(cid:31))(cid:0).\")>#(cid:30)( (cid:0)?(cid:30)&$%(cid:24)(cid:0)4(cid:28)((cid:0)(cid:31)+(cid:29)(cid:0)\"((cid:0)*  #’(cid:0)=\"(cid:31))(cid:0)+*(cid:0) .1((cid:26)(cid:0)\n4 $(cid:30)(cid:28)’ (cid:0)’+(cid:0).(cid:30)(cid:31)(cid:26)(cid:0)1 +1# (cid:0)%(cid:30)3 (cid:0)4  (cid:31)(cid:0)’\"$=(cid:22)(cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)’#  1(cid:0)(%&  (cid:0)*  ((cid:0)(cid:30)(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:26)(cid:0)*&+.(cid:0)(% (cid:0)1 &’+(cid:31)(cid:0)\"(cid:31)(cid:0)(% (cid:0)\n4 )(cid:0)$#+’ ’((cid:0)(+(cid:0).

I, Chaz Gulley, declare as follows: \n2. I have been incarcerated at Corrigan-Radgowski Correctional Center since May 2019. I \nam 35 years old. I am housed in the restrictive housing unit, which houses inmates from \nboth the Corrigan and Radgowski buildings of my facility. To my knowledge, there are \n48 people housed in my unit. \n3. My facility has been on lockdown every day since approximately March 31st, after people \n​\n​\nwithin the facility started testing positive for COVID-19. During this period of lockdown, \nI usually get 15-minute showers on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. I’ve been told I \ncan choose between half an hour of rec and half an hour phone call each day, and I’ve \nalways chosen the phone call, but sometimes they don’t allow phone calls at all.  That is \nthe only time I am allowed out of my cell. I eat meals in my cell. \n4.  I don’t have a cell-mate. My sleeping area is not cleaned nor sanitized by staff. I am not \nprovided cleaning supplies to clean my own cell. I can request someone to come clean \nmy cell, but that won’t happen during lockdowns.  \n5. The staff provide us with soap when we request it. I do not have access to hand sanitizer.  \n6. Our unit shares approximately 2 showers for 48 people. I also share 1 phone with the \nentire unit. Handcuffs are not sanitized between uses, and anyone who comes out of cell \nin my unit has to wear handcuffs.  \n7. Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, I have observed staff wearing masks and \ngloves, but not consistently. It depends on the day how many staff are actually wearing \nprotective equipment. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-10   Filed 05/10/20   Page 3 of 3\n \n8. Staff have provided me with a memo of guidance about how to protect myself and others \nfrom coronavirus transmission, and one mask made out of cloth. \n9. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I would testify to \nthe same statements above if called to do so in court. \n10.I have authorized Madeline Batt to affix my signature to this affidavit for me, because I \nam incarcerated, and it would take a minimum of seven days for me to receive a \ndocument in the mail, sign it in front of a notary, and return it by mail. \n \nExecuted this 8th day of April, 2020. \n​\n​\n \nChaz Gulley \nBy                  _____________ \n​\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-11   Filed 05/10/20   Page 1 of 4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT K \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-11   Filed 05/10/20   Page 2 of 4\n \nDeclaration of Zain Hussain \n \n  I, Zain Hussain, declare as follows: \n1.  I have been incarcerated at Cybulski since June 1, 2018. I am 43 years old. \nI am housed in E block, which houses the Second Chance Program. I have completed all \nthe programming they have asked me to and more. To my knowledge, there are close to \n100 housed in this block.  \n2.  I am a kitchen worker at Northern. I have done this job for 19 months. I \nusually wake up at 3:30 a.m. and go in to Northern from 4 a.m. until 11 a.m., seven days \na week. Last June, I switched to second shift, which is 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., also seven days \nper week.  \n3.  After Sunday, March 29, we stopped going to work at Northern. When we \nwere leaving to go to Northern that day on second shifft, a kitchen worker was coming \nback from first shift and sweating bullets. They took his temperature, which was 103.7. \nThey still sent us to work at Northern that day, but that was our last day of work.   \n4.  The first people to get sick in E block were taken out on March 30. There \nwas one guy taken out with a fever of 104. He was really sick. They started moving them \nfrom E block to another block, H block, which is usually the intake block at Cybulski. \nEven though they were sick, they made them clean out the block. They then put them in \nseg, two to a cell. They were in there for days, unable to take a shower. Then they moved \nthem to Northern.  \n5.  People continue to be taken out of my block because they are sick. There \nwere a couple people taken out of E block in the last week. The two people that they took \nout last Friday, April 10, were pretty bad. They had fevers and looked like death. I know \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-11   Filed 05/10/20   Page 3 of 4\n \nsome people have been hospitalized at UCONN.  \n6.  They were doing temperature checks for a week, checking temperatures \nonce per day, but then they stopped. The last time they did it was April 11.   \n7.  I asked a medical worker if I could be tested for COVID-19. She said I \ncould, but that if I wanted to get tested, I would have to pack up my stuff and go wait in \nH block with everyone else who had been tested to wait for the test results. So I would be \nput in with a bunch of other people who are definitely sick with fever, while I waited for \nmy result. I decided not to.  \n8.  A guy yesterday had chest pains and got a rapid test. He works for the \nlaundry department here. He said he wasn’t scared of Northern. In 10 minutes they told \nhim he had the antibodies but you’re not positive any more. He’s back in the block now.  \n9.  There have been 10 or 11 guys so far who have come back from Northern. \nThey haven’t been retested for COVID-19, to my knowledge. They just bring them back \nwhen their symptoms are gone and don’t have fevers. Some people still haven’t come \nback.  \n10.  I have asthma and diabetes. I have two asthma inhalers. I had pneumonia \ntwice in 2017. I have never been higher than a Level 2 inmate here.  \n11.  There’s no social distancing here. If I use the microwave or toilet, \nsomeone goes and uses it right after me. They are serving food to us right in the block. \nWe eat on our bunks or on tables. The block is one big room with cubes for sleeping \naround the outside. There are 15 cubes, with eight guys to a cube. Each cube has four \nbunk beds, about four feet apart. We share one bathroom with three urinals and four \nstalls. We share six or seven showers. The tiermen clean twice a day. If I use the phone, I \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-11   Filed 05/10/20   Page 4 of 4\n \nclean it with stuff that looks like windex.  \n12.  COs started wearing masks after a couple of them caught the virus. I wear \nmy mask most of the time, but I wonder what the point is because you can’t social \ndistance in here. The mask is a tan material, the same as our pants.  \n13.  I understand we all broke the law. The in people here are trying. They \ngave us some bleach for a time, then lemonall products and glass cleaner for the phones. \nBut what is the point of keeping us in here like this when we’re all on top of each other. \nPut us on an ankle monitor and let us out. I have a house to go to. I have a home where \nmy fiancee has never been in trouble, in Connecticut, and a job waiting for me.  \n14.  I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I \nwould testify to the same statements above if called to do so in court. \n15.  I have authorized Elana Bildner to affix my signature to this declaration \nfor me, because I am incarcerated, and it would take a minimum of seven days for me to \nreceive a document in the mail, sign it in front of a notary, and return it by mail, \nassuming I could do so. \n \n  Executed this 17th day of April, 2020. \n \n                Zain Hussain________________ \n                by                     ______________ \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-12   Filed 05/10/20   Page 1 of 6\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT L \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-12   Filed 05/10/20   Page 2 of 6\n \nDeclaration of Roger Johnson \n \nI, Roger Johnson, declare as follows: \n1.  I am incarcerated in the E dorm of Cybulski. I will be 55 on April 29 of \nthis year.  \n2.  In prison, I work as a detail worker at Northern, meaning I am transported \nfrom Cybulski to Northern in order to clean that prison.  \n3.  When I was cleaning in March, I was not protected at all. I had a pair of \nrubber gloves, but no mask or hazmat suit or anything.  \n4.  March 28 was my last day of work at Northern. One of the kitchen \nworkers in Northern had tested positive for COVID-19, so they stopped taking us to \nwork. \n5.  They checked my vital signs back at Cybulski on March 30. I had a high \nfever. The nurse looked at me strangely and left. I stayed in the unit for a few hours. A \ncouple hours later I was called out with two other individuals. We took COVID tests and \nthen sat there for hours waiting.  \n6.  After a few hours, we were moved to H dorm at Cybulski. We had to \nmove our stuff out ourselves. Then they sent us down to H dorm with bleach and forced \nus to clean it out ourselves, even though we were all sick. This made no sense. They \nknew this virus was coming and they knew this would happen way ahead of time. They \ncould have done this weeks ago. Instead, they waited until it actually occurred and then \nsent sick people down to clean up the dorm.  \n7.  The three of us from E dorm were in H dorm for a week. Once we tested \npositive, they put us in seg. It’s a small cell behind the captains’ and lieutenants’ \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-12   Filed 05/10/20   Page 3 of 6\n \nbuilding. The ventilation system there is really bad. I was put in seg with another guy \nfrom E dorm. The cell had mold all over the ceiling. I started to complain—I have \nrespiratory issues and it was terrible. There was a toilet in the cell, but I was in there with \nanother guy and there was no privacy. We weren’t allowed to leave to use the phone to \ncall, not even to call and our emergency contact that we were sick. The COs were trying \nto avoid the area. The nurses were calling us “little Covies” even before we got our test \nresults. There were guys who had gotten sick before us in E dorm, and they were stuck in \na seg cell for 10 days. \n8.  I started to get upset. I made two requests to mental health before they \nfinally came. A person from mental health came with the nurse and two lieutenants. As I \nwas expressing my concern, she said “People are dying. People are dying.” I said, “well, \nyou’re trying to kill me.” The lieutenant told me you requested to speak to mental health \nbecause of this? I said of course, look at the conditions. It was like a joke to her. I just felt \nlike an animal, the way they did this. And even though it was a quarantine area, staff kept \ncoming through to see who was in the cell and breaking the quarantine.   \n9.  The nurse told me I would be leaving soon. I was transferred to Northern \nthe night of April 7, around 10:30 p.m. I was transported in a regular van, with a bunch of \nother people.  \n10.  When I got to Northern, they took our vital signs—temperature and blood \npressure. Then they put us each in a cell for five days, in 2West. I was put in cell 202. We \nweren’t allowed to leave our cells at all, except for one phone call.  \n11.  There were guys close to me from Cybulski. There were guys downstairs \nfrom Corrigan and Radgowski. There were some from HCC and Cheshire, all around the \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-12   Filed 05/10/20   Page 4 of 6\n \nstate. There were people in all the cells. I think 2W and 3W were both full.  \n12.  I heard coughing. Some guys were taken out on stretchers and \nwheelchairs. It was a really sad situation. Staff were wearing hazmat suits. \n13.  There were two nurses on each shift who took vitals. There was a CO who \nwent around every 30 minutes. That was it. There was no specialized medical care or \nanything that I saw. I had my property with me. They didn’t give us any cleaning \nsupplies—just whatever you already had. I didn’t take a shower for two weeks. When I \nasked why I couldn’t take a shower, they said if we took a shower we would get the virus \nin the air.   \n14.  People starting kicking their doors trying to get a phone call. After three \ndays, they finally let us have one call. I called my mom. That was the only time I got out \nof my cell when I was at Northern. \n15.  I was in Northern for a total of five days. After five days, we were told \nthat we would be going back to H dorm at Cybulski. We were also told that before we got \nback, they would test everyone in E dorm for COVID-19 with new tests. We were \nsupposed to leave Monday, but they took us out early, on Sunday, after taking our \ntemperature. \n16.  Instead, when we got back to Cybulski, they put us back in E dorm. They \ntold the other people in E dorm we were “cleared,” but we didn’t have another COVID-\n19 test, or test negative, or anything like that. Everyone was worried about us being back \nhere. Right now, there are 112 guys in the block and they are not practicing social \ndistancing. You can’t.  \n17.  When we got out of quarantine at Northern, there were people already \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-12   Filed 05/10/20   Page 5 of 6\n \ncoming in to take our spots.  \n18.  When I got back to E dorm, guys were taking Tylenol and aspirin to try to \nhide fevers so they wouldn’t get moved out to Northern. Nobody wants to go there. \nMeanwhile, a lot of guys I know are telling me they probably have the virus because their \nbodies are aching, they lost their smell and taste, but they don’t want to get tested. Still \ntoday, in here, you got guys doing a lot of coughing. There’s one guy who is overweight, \nhe doesn’t look good at all.  \n19.  Recently, staff actually stopped bringing in aspirin so people can’t take it \nany more. But they also stopped taking our temperatures. So everyone is still in here, no \nvital signs, nothing. There’s still no special cleaning. They stopped giving us bleach—\njust some stuff that looks like bleach. Whoever feels like cleaning, cleans.  \n20.  The officers have a desk here that’s right near the counselor’s office. They \nput up tape so that we stay six feet away from it, even though they’re sitting up high on \nan elevated platform. But that just takes six feet of space away from us, so we’re all \ncloser together.  \n21.  I’m trying to stay on my bunk and stay away from other people, but it’s \nhard. I wear my mask all the time. It’s giving me a sore on my nose. While I was sick, I \nhad a cough for two days and the fever. I am feeling better, trying to get my lungs back, a \nlittle weak. I heard someone died. This is scary situation for me. I’m at the end of my bid. \nTo experience this now, it’s scary. I don’t know what’s going to happen next. \n22.  As we speak, a guy is moving out of my dorm. He requested to be tested \nand they just moved him to H block. He just packed up his stuff and walked down the \nhall. There was another guy last night who requested to be tested and they said it came up \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-12   Filed 05/10/20   Page 6 of 6\n \npositive for antibodies, but they put him back in the unit. This guy is still walking around \nthe cube, with no mask.  \n23.  It’s clear to me that DOC did not have a plan for this. They didn’t know \nhow to deal with this. It is just crazy.  \n24.  I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I \nwould testify to the same statements above if called to do so in court. \n25.

To my knowledge, there are \ncurrently approximately 25 people housed in my unit, but the number of people fluctuates \ndaily.  \n3. I get at most one hour out of cell per day. When people in my unit leave\ntheir cells, they are escorted by an officer. The officers hold people’s arms while \nescorting them. The officers wear gloves, but many do not change their gloves between \neach person they escort. The officers also use handcuffs while escorting some people. \nThey do not sanitize the handcuffs each time they place them on someone new. Wearing \na mask is optional, and most officers do not wear them. Sometimes officers place \nmultiple people in recreation “cages” at the same time so that they are within six of feet \nof one another.  \n4. I do not share my cell with anyone else. My sleeping area is not cleaned\nnor sanitized by staff. I am only provided supplies to clean my own cell once per week. I \nam provided with diluted cleaning supplies to clean. I do not have access to hand \nsanitizer.  \n5. I am only allowed to shower three times per week. I do not have a shower\nin my cell. I share approximately five showers with everyone in the unit. \n6. I also share two phones with my entire unit. I am allowed to make three\n15-minute phone calls per week. The phones are not always cleaned in between calls.\n7. There is one person who is responsible for cleaning the entire unit,\nincluding the common area, outside recreation area, counselors’ units, phone booths, \n1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-13   Filed 05/10/20   Page 3 of 3\nshowers, and individual cells after people are transferred. He cannot clean the unit \nsufficiently each day. \n8. Staff have provided guidance about how to protect myself and others from\ncoronavirus transmission by placing posters in the unit. They have also provided me with \ntwo masks made out of the same material used for our uniforms. \n9. Some staff members have tested positive for COVID-19. I have no way of\nknowing if I have come into contact with them. \n10. I have been diagnosed with asthma.

I, Austin Kerr, declare as follows: \n2.  I have been incarcerated at Corrigan Correctional Center since approximately September \n2019. I am 22 years old. I am housed in B pod at Corrigan. To my knowledge, there are \napproximately 100 people housed in my unit. \n3.  Around two or three weeks ago, I started experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. I felt a \nheadache and a sore throat. \n4.  I told correctional staff about my symptoms the same night I felt them, because I didn’t \nwant to get anyone sick on my recreation. \n5.  Correctional staff seemed appalled. They quickly distanced themselves from me, and \nthey said my cell-mate and I couldn’t go for recreation. I called the CO using my buzzer, \nand told them they couldn’t take away our rec, so they sent me to medical. \n6.  At medical, they took my temperature and as far as I know I didn’t have a fever. They \nsent me back to my cell. I remained in my cell that night and my cell-mate and I were \npermitted to shower but not to go to rec. \n7.  The next morning, my cell-mate (who was not symptomatic) and I were quarantined \ntogether in a cell in our unit. Approximately 9 days after I was quarantined, I was told I \ntested positive for COVID-19 by Correctional Officers. Medical staff did not \ncommunicate with me about my test. When I asked them, they said they would let me \nknow the results after a few days, but they never did. \n8.  In total, I was in isolation for 15 days. I was not allowed out of my cell at all during that \ntime. \n9.  I was not permitted to shower or go to recreation. I did not have access to the phone, even \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-14   Filed 05/10/20   Page 3 of 4\n \nfor legal calls. No one was coming to collect garbage until I complained repeatedly about \nthe trash piling up. After that they collected the garbage once, and I believe that was the \nonly time it was collected while I was isolated. \n10. I repeatedly expressed discontent with my conditions to staff, including lieutenants, but \nno one did anything. I covered my cell window and flooded my cell to try and get \nconditions to change, but nothing changed even after staff came to deal with those \nsituations. \n11. I was not provided with any healthcare to alleviate my symptoms while I was isolated. \nMedical staff came to take my vitals twice a day, and one time they came because I said I \nwas having trouble breathing. They checked my breathing and said I was good. \n12. The staff who I interacted with were wearing gloves, masks, and gowns.  \n13. This form of isolation negatively affected my mental health. I had trouble sleeping and \nfelt depressed. I felt like I was losing it, because I was in seg without having done \nanything wrong. The worst part was that I couldn’t call my family. I could have died in \nthere without anyone knowing. \n14. I was let out of isolation after 15 days. I don’t know why I was let out on that day. I did \nnot receive any additional COVID-19 test before being let out of isolation. \n15. Before I went into isolation, people in my unit at Corrigan were still getting normal rec in \ngroups of about 20 people. Now people go out to rec for 30 minutes in groups of 2 or 3.  \n16. Before and after isolation, I have shared 6 showers with approximately 100 other people \nin the unit. I also share 9 phones with my entire unit.  \n17. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I would testify to \nthe same statements above if called to do so in court. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-14   Filed 05/10/20   Page 4 of 4\n \n18.

To my knowledge, there are around 66 \npeople housed in N pod. \n3. We are not on lockdown, but our movement is restricted. We get three hours and\n30 minutes total out of cell per day. We use our time out of cell to shower and use the phone. We \ncan also play cards, chess, and dominoes. We are allowed to go outside and play basketball. \nThere is no social distancing when we are out of our cells.  \n4. I am in a cell by myself. My sleeping area is not cleaned or sanitized by staff. I\nam provided with diluted cleaning supplies to clean my own space. \n5. We eat meals in the dayroom of the unit. During mealtimes, we are spaced about\na foot apart. \n6. The staff do not provide us with soap. When I have needed soap in the past two\nweeks, I have gotten it from commissary for a fee. I sometimes cannot buy other items I need \nfrom commissary so that I can afford soap. I do not have access to hand sanitizer.  \n7. I do not have a shower in my cell. I share eight showers with approximately 12\nother people. On the tier below me, roughly 40 people share eight showers. The showers are \ntypically cleaned three times per day. The showers are cleaned with diluted cleaner. The showers \nare not sufficiently clean.   \n8. I also share eight phones with my entire unit. The phones sometimes get used\nabout 50 times in between cleanings. I put a sock over the phone before I use it to protect against \ngerms.  \n1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-15   Filed 05/10/20   Page 3 of 3\n9.

Several staff members in my facility have tested positive for COVID-19. I saw\none of these staff members standing within a foot of someone who was incarcerated. \n12. Staff have not provided me with guidance about how to protect myself and others\nfrom coronavirus transmission. They provided me with a used cloth mask about two weeks ago. \n13. I have not come into contact with anyone who has tested positive for the\ncoronavirus.

I was incarcerated at Carl Robinson Correctional Institution from \nDecember 2018 until April 3, 2020. I am 34 years old. At Carl Robinson, I was housed in \n3B (building 3, on the B side). To my knowledge, there are 180 people in each building: \n90 on A side and 90 on B side. It’s a dormitory setting: We share showers, toilets, \nphones, tables, everything.  \n2.  Before I left Carl Robinson, we were struggling to get the proper cleaning \nproducts. In March, the warden had come to talk to us and said we would get extra soap \nand bleach to use for cleaning because of the virus. But three weeks later, we still hadn’t \ngotten anything. We were cleaning the dorm with our own toilet paper—we each get only \none roll per week—and our own soap. We had to decide between using soap to clean our \nbodies or to clean our areas. So on March 24, we wrote a letter to our counselor \nsupervisor saying that we were not able to clean our environment properly. We were \nasking to clean and being told they didn’t have paper towels, or being denied spray \nbottles. The detail workers were able to clean the phones, bathrooms, and the vents on \ntheir designated shifts, but they weren’t cleaning the floors, bunks, lockers and walls. \nWhy did DOC not give us ways to clean anything? It was clearly hazardous. \n3.  There were other issues too. Medical would hand us pills without gloves \non. When we complained, they told us they didn’t have to wear gloves or masks. I wrote \na request about it. They also started giving us “off” portions of food, and old food, about \na month ago—we would get a lunch portion of food for dinner: two slices of bread, two \nslices of baloney, one slice of cheese, a little coleslaw, a small bag of chips, and milk. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-16   Filed 05/10/20   Page 3 of 6\n \nWhen they did clean the phones and the bathrooms, they would kick out the whole \nbuilding and put us all in the gym together, or put half of us in there at a time. Despite the \nvirus, COs continued to shake down peoples’ areas, usually three bunks a day, but \nsometimes up to a whole section. Even if they were coughing or sick, they would go \nthrough all our stuff thoroughly, touching everything. One of the COs in our block \nalready had tested positive for COVID at that point. And they weren’t wearing masks \nuntil recently. The warden is did address certain issues but the COs did not do what she \nsaid.   \n4.  On Wednesday, April 1, we got word that A side was not going to eat \nlunch in protest of the conditions. Everybody on B side decided that if A side wasn’t \neating, we wouldn’t either. I later heard that it went from building to building. We all \nshared whatever food we had; I gave a guy the last soup I had in my locker. Then when \ntime came to get our trays—we had to go outside to get them, no matter what the weather \nwas—and the correctional officer asked whether we were going down to get them, \neveryone says no. We didn’t scream, yell, or throw things. We just said no, we weren’t \ngoing to eat that one meal.  \n5.  At the time, all the staff was on A side. Then the warden, deputy warden,  \nlieutenants and other officers started to leave the building. Then when they heard we \nweren’t eating, they came to see us. We all sat on our bunks and had a conversation: We \ntold them everything that was going on, and how we hadn’t gotten bleach or any cleaning \nproducts that we were supposed to get. We also explained the issues with the food, which \nwas rancid, old, and often moldy. One of the captains said he didn’t believe us. The \nconversation ended and the officers left. The next day, nothing happened. We just called \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-16   Filed 05/10/20   Page 4 of 6\n \nour families and told them about it.  \n6.  That Friday, a correctional officer came and told me I needed to go down \nto the processing area (A&D) and get a new ID. Instead, when I got there, a bunch of \ncorrectional officers rushed me and threw me against the wall. They put me in shackles \nand twisted my arms up. Then they put me in a van and took me to Northern. They told \nme I was under investigation. They didn’t say what for.  \n7.  When I got to Northern, they strip searched me and threw me back in \nshackles and put me in a cell. I didn’t have my morning medication. I had to beg them to \ngive me my albuterol inhaler, because I have asthma. My body was also starting to go \nnumb. I was lying on the floor, wheezing, and calling for help. I pressed the intercom in \nthe cell for help but was told multiple times to stop pressing the button. The COs just kept \nignoring me when they walked by. My lungs were getting tight and painful. I yelled to \nthe person two cells down to get help. When I was able to speak to a CO, I asked them to \ncall a “code white,” which is a medical emergency. They refused.  \n8.  I also take a medication named neurotin in the mornings. If I don’t take it, \nmy left side will go numb and I’m unable to walk or to use my hand. I didn’t get the pill \nthat morning. After hours went by, a CO on second shift finally brought me to medical, \nand he had to help me get up and walk. They helped with my asthma, but I didn’t get the \nneurotin until later that night.   \n9.  I was put in Northern just to silence me. I can’t afford to take a ticket for \nsomething I did not do. If we don’t feel like going to chow, we don’t have to. A hunger \nstrike is technically missing six meals; we just turned down food once.  \n10.  Here at Northern, I am in 1West in a cell the size of a closet by myself. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-16   Filed 05/10/20   Page 5 of 6\n \nOther people are here, including some from Robinson. I still haven’t had a hearing for my \nticket. I’m past my amount of seg days. I’m only allowed to go shower three times a \nweek for 15 minutes each. I’m not allowed to order commissary or have my TV or \nhotpot.  \n11.   Outside my window, by the entry to 2West, I’ve seen tons of people \ngetting transported in here in shackles, with workers wearing Hazmat suits. Some of the \npeople getting transported were doing badly and looked like they were hurting. The first \nnight I was here, people were coming in all night long. Earlier that day I saw them bring \nin maybe 50 mattresses to the same building. They now have a tent set up there. I’ve \nheard ambulances coming by. One of the tiermen said that they had to open another block \nbecause they had too many people with COVID-19 here, and that it was already over \n100.  \n12.  They have continued to bring people in. They are doing it at night with the \nlights off. Some of the COs have been wearing hazmat suits and some are not. Some are \nwearing normal clothes and others are not. When I look outside my window, I can see \ndebris all over – gloves, hair nets, shoe covers, a broken pallet, and hangers.  \n13.  The ventilation in here is crazy. The air is either hot and muggy or \nfreezing. When it’s cold here, it’s really cold. In order to sleep, I need to sleep with \nsweatpants, a sweatshirt, thermals, and a T-shirt, under the blanket, and it’s still too cold \nto sleep. And if it’s not freezing, it’s too hot and muggy.     \n14.  The COs here are giving us a Styrofoam cup of Lemonall and paper \ntowels to clean. There are showers on the tier but you have to go half-naked. You can’t \nclean the showers before you get in, and you’re transported there and back in handcuffs \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-16   Filed 05/10/20   Page 6 of 6\n \nthat aren’t cleaned.  \n15.  You can only make three phone calls per week. I was taken here on April \n3 and now I’m still here. Nobody is telling me anything. They aren’t testing anyone in \nthis part of Northern for COVID-19. I put in a sick call on April 9, and I was just seen on \nthe 19. I told them I needed a refill of my inhaler because my asthma feels like it’s \ngetting worse and I feel like I’ve had a cold for weeks.  All he did was check my vitals.  \n16.  I understand this is prison, but even still there’s a way it should be run and \na way it should not be. At Robinson, they were letting us stay up late at night and keeping \nthe TVs on and phone and extra channels, all to keep us calm. But they weren’t letting us \ndo what we needed to do to protect ourselves from this virus. They turned a blind eye to \nus.   \n17.

Since the \npandemic started, they’ve added 2 people who were transferred in from Walker to my \nrec, and now it is 8 people at a time. Rec takes place in 3 cages, one of which is \napproximately 5 feet by 9 feet, and 2 of which are smaller. 4 people are in the larger cage \nand 2 in each smaller cage at the same time.  \n4. I don’t have a cell-mate, but 2-3 officers enter my cell per day to take me to rec, the \nphone, or the showers. It is not the same 2-3 officers each day. \n5. My sleeping area is not cleaned nor sanitized by staff. We are provided cleaning supplies \nto clean our own spaces on Saturdays, though it is not enough supplies to last throughout \nthe week because the officers keep coming in and out of my cell. \n6. I eat my meals in my cell. The guards who bring my food are wearing gloves, but they do \nnot change their gloves between holding our food and touching unsanitized handcuffs. \n7. The staff have provided us with one bar of soap since the pandemic started. Other than \nthat, when I’ve needed soap in the past two weeks, I’ve gotten it from the commissary for \na fee. I do not have access to hand sanitizer.  \n8. I do not have a shower in my cell. I share a shower with approximately 40 other people in \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-17   Filed 05/10/20   Page 3 of 4\n \nthe tier. There’s a single slot in the shower that everyone’s towels sit on, and towels are \nnot laundered between showers. I also share 4 phones with my entire unit. Handcuffs and \nshackles are used repeatedly throughout the day, and are not sanitized between uses. \n9. Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, I have observed staff wearing masks and \ngloves, but not gowns. My temperature has been taken a few times in response to an \nunrelated infection, but staff are not consistently taking inmates’ temperatures despite the \nfact that I was informed by a correctional officer that a kitchen worker at Northern has \ntested positive for COVID-19. \n10.Staff have provided me with guidance about how to protect myself and others from \ncoronavirus transmission. They have provided me with two pieces of paper encouraging \nus to wash our hands and clean our cells. However, it is difficult to follow the advice \nabout sanitizing because we don’t always have Lemonall, the provided cleaning material, \nand correctional officers are constantly coming in and out of our cells. They have \nprovided me with one mask made out of cloth on approximately April 1st.  \n​\n​\n11.I have come into contact with approximately 6 correctional officers in the past week who \nhave been coughing and sneezing. They have continued to work as normal and told me \n“it’s just allergies.” \n12. People at my facility have tried raising concerns with prison staff about their handling of \nthe coronavirus. They ask for more cleaning supplies, they ask staff to wear the \nDOC-issued masks instead of the smaller, thinner ones many are wearing, and they ask \nstaff to change their gloves. Prison staff have responded by refusing to give more \ncleaning supplies, saying that it’s too hot to wear the larger masks, and refusing to change \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-17   Filed 05/10/20   Page 4 of 4\n \ntheir gloves. As a result, many inmates are refusing to leave their cells, including to \nshower, because they are concerned about the staff’s gloves.  \n13.When I seek treatment for a medical condition, it is usually a significant wait to see a \ndoctor. When I sought treatment for a root canal, it took from September to January to \nsee a doctor. I’m currently waiting to see a doctor for knee pain and a lump in my knee. \nIt’s been a month and half since I first started requesting treatment and I haven’t received \ntreatment yet.  \n14.People are no longer being pulled out of cell for mental health counseling, which \npreviously happened once per week for people receiving mental health treatment. \n15.I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I would testify to \nthe same statements above if called to do so in court. \n16.I have authorized Madeline Batt to affix my signature to this affidavit for me, because I \nam incarcerated, and it would take a minimum of seven days for me to receive a \ndocument in the mail, sign it in front of a notary, and return it by mail. \n \nExecuted this 8th day of April, 2020. \n​\n​\n \nLuis Pagan

3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-20   Filed 05/10/20   Page 1 of 7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT T \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-20   Filed 05/10/20   Page 2 of 7\nDeclaration of Chad Petitpas  \n1. I, Chad Petitpas, declare as follows:  \n2. I have been incarcerated at Brooklyn CI for approximately six years. I am  \n40 years old. I am housed in D Dorm of Brooklyn CI. There are four dorms at  \nBrooklyn CI. To my knowledge, there are 114 people housed in each dorm.  \n3. Our facility has been on a kind of “soft lockdown” for the past seven or so  \nweeks. This started when someone in B Dorm tested positive for coronavirus. When  \nthat happened, they quarantined B Dorm. But they still let the other dorms—including  \nmine— go to outdoor rec, and move around freely inside the dorm.  \n4. As I said, there are around 114 people in each dorm, and everyone is split  \ninto 19 cubes. A cube is essentially a room with no roof and no front wall. There are a  \ntotal of three bunks in each cube. When you’re on your bunk, you’re probably about three  \nfeet away from the people in the bunk above or below you, and the bunks adjacent to  \nyou.  \n5. When we are not in our cubes, we are in the open social area. This social  \narea has eight tables. Normally, four people sit at each table, but sometimes, people pull  \nextra chairs around, so that each table can fit six. When people do that, everyone  \nis shoulder-to-shoulder and knee-to-knee.  \n6. No one at the prison has told us to “socially distance” or keep six to eight  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-20   Filed 05/10/20   Page 3 of 7\nfeet away from each other. I have seen those recommendations on TV, but I know that  \nthose safety guidelines are not for us. That is because “socially distancing” is impossible  \n \nhere.  \n7. We have access to the social areas and the bathrooms all day long. That is  \nonly interrupted during counts, which happen twice per day. During the counts,  \nprisoners have to be in their cubes, and other prisoners, who are employed by the prison,  \nclean the social area. They also clean the social area once at night, but this is more of a  \nquick sweep. The tabletops are wiped down once per day with cleaning liquid. I don’t  \nbelieve the chairs are ever cleaned.  \n8. The showers are cleaned once per day. Because we can shower whenever  \nwe like, I would guess that 95 or 100 people shower every day. Nearly all of us use  \nshowers that have not been disinfected.  \n9. The phones are also cleaned one time per day. There are a total of six  \nphones, and every inmate is allowed up to six calls a day. I would guess that  \naround 80-90 people make calls every day, so that is about 13-14 people using the  \nsame phone in a row, before it is disinfected.  \n10. The prison has provided us with a free bar of soap two times. The first  \ntime was about five weeks ago. The second time was about two weeks ago. Because  \nwe usually do not get free soap from the prison, we have to buy it on our own from the  \ncommissary. It costs $0.90. That might not sound like a lot, but to put it in context,  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-20   Filed 05/10/20   Page 4 of 7\nweekly wages for people who are employed by DOC is around $5.50. That means that a  \nbar of soap is equal to almost twenty percent of our weekly salary. Even so, I  \nhave noticed that prisoners who have the means to are cleaning their hands more  \noften than normal. Of course, some cannot afford soap, so they can’t clean their  \nhands.  \n11. The staff have masks, but very few wear them. I would guess that out of  \n100 officers, there are maybe 5 who will wear a mask. The rest of them are adamantly  \nopposed to it. The staff have told me that the masks are not what they were promised,  \nand that they won’t be effective in protecting against the virus. They compare what they  \nhave to putting a t-shirt over their face.  \n12. Because staff refuse to wear the masks, prisoners don’t see the point in  \nwearing them, either. DOC gave every prisoner in my dorm two masks, about two  \nweeks ago. The masks are made of an odd khaki material, similar to our uniform shirts.  \nThe majority of the inmates don’t wear them, because most people have little confidence  \nthat the masks will make a difference. It’s been explained to us on the news and through  \nstaff, that if the virus is contracted it will be because it is brought in by a staff member.  \nSo if the staff aren’t protecting us by wearing masks, we don’t understand what  \ndifference it makes if we, the prisoners, wear them.  \n13. I am also concerned for myself and for other people about what will  \nhappen if we test positive for coronavirus. Brooklyn CI mostly houses people who have a  \ncurrent conviction or a history with a sexual component. A lot of the people here \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-20   Filed 05/10/20   Page 5 of 7\nwould rather not be transferred to Corrigan or Northern. In fact, in the past, those  \nfacilities have been used as a threat. Now, the prison is saying that if a person tests  \npositive, they will be sent to Northern or Corrigan.  \n14. At one point, around five days ago, a number of people made clear that  \neven if they weren’t feeling well, they wouldn’t report their symptoms, because they  \nare afraid of being transferred. The warden heard about this, and so he came down and  \nhad everyone’s temperature taken. According to the digital thermometer, my  \ntemperature was 97.1 degrees. But the thermometer read the temperature of another guy  \nas being 95.7 degrees. I’m pretty sure that if that was his actual temperature, he would  \nbe dead. So I don’t have much confidence that the prison’s procedures are working to  \nscreen out symptomatic staff from coming into the building.  \n15. I am also concerned about what will happen to the many people in my  \ndorm who are close to the end of their sentences. Like I said, I have been at Brooklyn CI  \nfor six years, and over that time I have kind of taken on the role of helping people get  \nset up with homeless shelters, food pantries, and other kinds of services for their release.  \nThis isn’t an “on the books” job, it’s just something I do to help people. So a lot of  \npeople who are close to the end of their sentences come and talk to me. I would guess  \nthat right now, in my dorm, there are about 20 people who are within 60 days of their  \nend-of-sentence date.  \n16. DOC has not announced any procedures in place for an inmate who is at  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-20   Filed 05/10/20   Page 6 of 7\nthe end of his sentence and has a higher than normal temperature. But a number of staff  \nhave told me that what will happen is that DOC is going to take 20-30 days of their \ngood  \ntime away, send them to Corrigan or Northern until the temperature goes down to normal.  \nThis makes me sad, and angry. People have earned their good time. And DOC should not  \nbe able to take it away because they have, and continue to, mismanage their response to  \nthe coronavirus.  \n17. DOC has the discretion to release the people on furlough when they are at  \nthe end of their sentence. Our dorm is at nearly full capacity, and there are many people  \n \nwho are near the end of their sentences, but not one has been released on furlough. I  \n \nthink this is because DOC has an unstated policy of not approving people for community  \n \nrelease who have a sex offense on their records. I am in discovery with DOC on a federal  \n \ncase that is related to this. I believe from what I have learned through this discovery that  \nseven people with sex offences have been approved for community release in the last five  \nyears. I think that this is unjustifiable even in normal times, and I am very discouraged  \nthat DOC won’t even consider behaving differently during a global pandemic.  \n18. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I  \nwould testify to the same statements above if called to do so in court.  \n19. I have authorized Sophia Angelis to affix my signature to this affidavit for  \nme, because I am incarcerated, and it would take a minimum of seven days for me  \nto receive a document in the mail, sign it in front of a notary, and return it by mail.  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-20   Filed 05/10/20   Page 7 of 7\nExecuted this 22 day of April, 2020.  \nChad Petitpas________________  \nby_Sophia Angelis___________  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-21   Filed 05/10/20   Page 1 of 6\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT U \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-21   Filed 05/10/20   Page 2 of 6\nDeclaration of Ken Pierce \n \nI, Ken Pierce, declare as follows:\t\n1.  I have been incarcerated at Carl Robinson Correctional Institution since around \nDecember 2018. I am 39 years old. I was in dorm 3A until about a week ago. \nNow I am in dorm 5D. To my knowledge, there are around 90 people housed in \nthis dorm, and that is the same for all dorms. \n2.  Two days ago, a guy in the dorm was removed because he had symptoms of \ncoronavirus. Yesterday, the Lieutenant came in and announced to the whole dorm \nthat the guy had tested negative, but then he said that the prison authorities were \nputting our dorm on quarantine anyways. So our quarantine just started yesterday, \nApril 14, 2020.  \n3.  I feel skeptical that the Lieutenant was telling the truth when he said that the guy \nthey removed because he had symptoms tested negative. That’s because \nyesterday, two more people were removed from the dorm because they had \nsymptoms, too. I was talking to one of them before he was removed. He looked \nreally sick. I see him every day, so I know how he normally looks, and he really \ndifferent. He was sweaty and pale. I could tell something was not right. I told him \nthat he should tell the guards that he was sick and that they should remove him. \nHe said he had gone to the guard station several times already and told them this, \nand that eventually, they agreed to remove him from the dorm. He was sitting \nthere with his things packed, ready to go. He said he wanted to leave as quickly as \npossible so that he wouldn’t get other people sick. But he had to wait for the staff, \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-21   Filed 05/10/20   Page 3 of 6\nand so he sat in the dorm for a few hours while he was symptomatic. I do not \nknow if he tested positive for coronavirus. \n4.  I feel like it is just a matter of time until we all get infected with the virus. Like I \nsaid, there are 90 people in one big, open dorm, and we all sleep in bunks. Being \nin quarantine means that we usually don’t leave the dorm anymore. For example, \nnow we eat on our laps, sitting on our bunks, instead of going to the cafeteria, \nwhere we normally eat with people from other dorms, because of the quarantine. \nBut even so, we are close together all the time. You can count the tiles on the \nfloor to see how close we are to each other, because the tiles are each 12-inch \nsquares. Me and some of the other guys with bunks near mine recently counted \nthe tiles around our bunk beds. By our count, there are 10 people within four feet \nof each of us every time we go to sleep. When we’re not in our bunks, we can \neither walk around the dorm, or go to the little dayroom that is attached. But there \nis not much more space where we can go.  \n5.  I have not observed any efforts to make the dorm more sanitized since the \nbeginning of the outbreak. We haven’t been given extra cleaning supplies; we get \nthe same amount of cleaning stuff every week as we have before the pandemic, \nand the inmate workers still clean the dorm three times per day. The inmates are \ndoing their best on their own to keep the dorm as clean as possible, but it’s hard to \ndo with 90 guys packed in one room. The one exception is that some guards have \nbought Lysol themselves, I believe with their own money, and brought it in for us \nto use. I don’t think this has been very effective, though, because a staff member \nhas to supervise inmates while they use it, so that rarely happens.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-21   Filed 05/10/20   Page 4 of 6\n6.  I have not observed any changes to the protocols for cleaning showers. We have \nseven shower stalls. They are cleaned three times per day. But the showers are not \ncleaned after each use, so people use showers that have not been disinfected.  \n7.  We also usually do not free soap. The staff has told us that we have to pay for \nsoap from the commissary so long as we have any money in our accounts. I got \none free bar of soap because I complained about it. If I hadn’t complained, I don’t \nthink I would have gotten the bar of soap for free.  \n8.  Every person in my dorm was given one mask. The masks are made of cloth. The \nouter part is the same material that they use to make our “prison tans,” and the \ninner part is made of a t-shirt material. We haven’t been ordered to use them; we \nare told to use them at our own discretion. I would guess that about five or six \npeople in the dorm use the masks, out of 90 guys.  \n9.  The guards also have masks. I would guess that about 85% of the guards wear \nmasks and gloves. I also see them using hand sanitizer really often, either inside \nthe guard station or in bottles attached to their belts. I am not allowed to use hand \nsanitizer, because I am an inmate. I have also been told that the guards have their \ntemperatures checked before they come into the prison every day, though I do not \nsee this. \n10. The only guidance I have received from staff about how to protect myself from \ncoronavirus is rom informational flyers. Those flyers say, if I remember correctly, \nthat we should wash our hands and cover our mouths and noses when we sneeze \nor cough. I have not been told to keep a distance of 6-8 feet between me and other \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-21   Filed 05/10/20   Page 5 of 6\npeople, or to “socially distance.” I assume this is because it would be impossible, \nbecause the dorm is so crowded.    \n11. I am worried about what will happen if I get sick with coronavirus and need to \nseek medical treatment. In my experience, it can take months to see a doctor, even \nwhen there is not a global pandemic going on. For example, I have a bad ear \ncanal, so sometimes it gets infected and bleeds. Last year, my ear got infected and \nstarted bleeding. I tried to see someone from medical, but no one would see me \nfor two days. So I had to spend two days in the dorm with a bleeding ear. After \nthat, a nurse gave me antibiotics, but I have still never seen an ENT doctor, even \nthough I requested it. I have watched other guys wait for months to see a doctor. \nSometimes, you never see a doctor.  \n12. I worry about my family.  For example, my mother is a doctor in the ER in \nMiddlesex Hospital. I am worried that she will get infected while I am still in \nprison.  \n13. I am in prison because I committed a non-violent crime. I have been approved for \nrelease to a halfway house since October 16, 2019, but now I have been told that \nthe halfway houses are not accepting people from prison, so I can’t be released to \none. I know I committed a crime, and that’s why I’m here. But I also feel like I \nearned my release date. I think there are about ten people in my dorm who were \napproved for release and are in prison for non-violent offenses, but now, they’re \nstuck in here, just like me. If they let us go, like they are approved to do, it would \nmake more space for everyone else, and the other prisoners and the staff would be \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-21   Filed 05/10/20   Page 6 of 6\nsafer. Right now, I feel like I am just sitting here waiting to get sick, and there is \nnothing I can do to protect myself. \n14. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I would \ntestify to the same statements above if called to do so in court. \n15.

To my knowledge, there are \napproximately 150 people housed in my unit. \n3.  I live in a cell. I get 45 minutes out of cell two times per day to use the phone and to take \na shower. \n4.  We are no longer doing recreation at Osborn. We stopped doing recreation 1-2 weeks \nago. \n5.  I have one cell-mate, and we sleep approximately 3 feet apart. Our sleeping area is not \ncleaned or sanitized by staff. We have cleaning supplies to clean our own spaces, but \nbecause only my cell-mate is a tier-man and has access to cleaning supplies. I don’t think \nwe would get cleaning supplies otherwise. \n6.  I eat my meals in my cell. We have to go line up to get the meals outside of our cells, and \nwe’re right next to each other in the line. We wear our masks but are not kept socially \ndistant from each other. \n7.  The staff have provided me with one bar of soap, around March 13 , since the pandemic \nth\nstarted. When I’ve needed additional soap, I’ve gotten it from the commissary for a fee.  \n8.  I do not have a shower in my cell. I share 4 showers with the entire unit. The showers are \ncleaned once per day. I also share 4 phones with my entire unit. Previously, my unit \ncould use both phones on both sides of the facility, so had access to 8 phones, but now \nwe’re restricted to the 4 phones on our side of the facility. The phones are wiped down \nbefore rec, but not between uses.  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-22   Filed 05/10/20   Page 3 of 3\n \n9.  Before last week, it was not common to see staff wearing masks or gloves. Starting last \nweek, they are wearing masks consistently. Inmates also are all wearing masks now, \nbecause they put a rule in a place last week requiring it. Before some were wearing masks \nand some weren’t.  \n10. I have come into contact with multiple people in my facility who have tested positive for \nthe coronavirus. They took them out of the unit and quarantined them, but only after \nabout four days of them showing symptoms. \n11. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I would testify to \nthe same statements above if called to do so in court. \n12. I have authorized Madeline Batt to affix my signature to this affidavit for me, because I \nam incarcerated, and it would take a minimum of seven days for me to receive a \ndocument in the mail, sign it in front of a notary, and return it by mail. \n \n  Executed this 24  day of April, 2020. \nth\n \n                Darien Rosario_______________ \n                By         ______________ \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-23   Filed 05/10/20   Page 1 of 4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT W \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-23   Filed 05/10/20   Page 2 of 4\n \nDeclaration of Christopher Russell \n \n1.  I, Christopher Russell, declare as follows: \n2.  I have been incarcerated at Northern Correctional Institution since Monday, April 20th. \nPrior to that I had been incarcerated at Bridgeport Correctional Center since \napproximately the 21  of January. I am 29 years old. I am housed in a block at Northern \nst\nthey are using for medical isolation, in a cell by myself. 6 people were transferred with \nme from Bridgeport to Northern. \n3.  At Bridgeport, prior to coming to Northern, I was in a cell block that housed 20 people. \nWe slept less than 6 feet apart from one another, probably 3 or 4 feet. \n4.  We ate meals all together in the dayroom, less than 3 feet apart. All 20 of us were on top \nof one another. \n5.  Since the coronavirus started, we had our cells cleaned once. Our cells were supposed to \nbe cleaned every Monday, but they weren’t. We would ask for spray bottles and paper \ntowels to wipe down tables and they wouldn’t give us those. \n6.  Correctional officers had masks, but were wearing them around their necks. We were told \nthey were optional and the correctional officers didn’t have to wear them.  \n7.  After my mother had told me the news was reporting that there were COVID-19 cases in \nthe Department of Correction, I asked Correctional Officers at Bridgeport about it. They \ntold me it wasn’t true, and the news was lying. \n8.  I started feeling symptoms last Thursday, April 16 , and I told my block officer. He \nth\nrepeatedly told me he would call me down to medical but he never did. I was not sent to \nmedical until Sunday, April 19 . \nth\n9.  When I was sent to medical, they took my temperature. I had a fever but they didn’t test \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-23   Filed 05/10/20   Page 3 of 4\n \nme for COVID-19. However, they sent me to a cell at Bridgeport with two people who \nhad already tested positive. They left me in the cell for twenty-four hours with the two \nCOVID-positive people.  \n10. After 24 hours in the cell, I was sent to Northern. I still had not been tested. \n11. A day after arriving at Northern, April 21 , I was tested for COVID-19. They have not \nst\nyet told me the results. When I asked the medical staff, they did not respond. They pretty \nmuch just looked at me and walked away. \n12. At Northern, I am in a cell by myself. I get 30 minutes out of cell per day to make two \nphone calls. \n13. I can’t shower at all while I’m here. I have no access to recreation. I have no access to my \nproperty. I cannot order commissary. I feel like they are punishing us for having COVID-\n19. \n14. I was given a care package of a toothbrush and toothpaste, soap, and shampoo when I \narrived at Northern. But it’s not very useful because we can’t shower. If we want to wash, \nwe have to do so in the sink, which is not clean. \n15. At Northern, the CO’s are wearing masks. \n16. The cells are disgusting and dirty. The toilets and sinks are all grimy. There’s toilet paper \nwith urine on it on the floor of my cell. It looks like the cells have not been cleaned in a \nwhile.  \n17. The cells are made of solid concrete and freezing cold. This has made it hard for me to \nsleep and breathe. I have asthma and the cold air makes it hard to breathe. \n18. When I arrived at Northern, I did not have my inhaler. I only got it back last night after I \nwoke up in the middle of night and told them I couldn’t breathe. There is a buzzer I can \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-23   Filed 05/10/20   Page 4 of 4\n \npress in the cell, but I couldn’t get up to press it because I couldn’t move or breathe. I \ncouldn’t do anything until a CO came around on tour. I asked him to call medical, but he \ndidn’t do so immediately. Medical didn’t come until after his next tour, fifteen minutes \nlater. \n19. The only medical care I receive here is Tylenol and Mucinex. Neither of them help. They \ntake my temperature and blood pressure twice per day. They have not told me what \nwould happen if my fever was too high. \n20. Medical staff have told me I can leave Northern 14 days after arriving. \n21. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. I would testify to \nthe same statements above if called to do so in court. \n22. I have authorized Madeline Batt to affix my signature to this affidavit for me, because I \nam incarcerated, and it would take a minimum of seven days for me to receive a \ndocument in the mail, sign it in front of a notary, and return it by mail. \n \n  Executed this 22  day of April, 2020. \nnd\n \n                Christopher Russell \n                by       _____________ \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-24   Filed 05/10/20   Page 1 of 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT X \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-24   Filed 05/10/20   Page 2 of 3\nDeclaration of Tyrone Spence \n \n1.  I am an adult.  \n2.  I have been incarcerated at Garner Correctional Institution since \nSeptember 2019. I am 28 years old. I am housed in Echo Unit. To my knowledge, there \nare approximately 90 people currently housed in my unit. \n3.  My unit is not on lockdown, but we are confined to the unit. We get about \n3 hours and 30 minutes of out-of-cell time per day. During this time, we can lift weights \nor play ping pong, chess, or cards. Sometimes, ten or fifteen people use equipment during \none recreation period, and equipment is not cleaned in between each person’s use. Some \npeople use gloves, but they are not used consistently.  \n4.  One other person lives in my cell. We sleep in bunkbeds. The cell is \ncramped, and it is impossible to stay more than five feet away from one another. Our \nsleeping area is not cleaned or sanitized by staff. We have cell clean-up once per week, at \nwhich time we are provided a broom, mop, and cleaner. The cleaner is diluted. If I want \nto clean my cell any other day of the week, I usually use shampoo.  \n5.  I eat my lunch and dinner in the common area of the unit. Each table has \nfour seats. Everyone sitting at a table is within arm’s length of one another. \n6.  The staff do not provide us with soap. I do not have access to hand \nsanitizer. I recently requested that my family send me hand sanitizer, but the prison staff \nwould not allow it.  \n7.  I do not have a shower in my cell. I share six showers with the entire unit. \nThe showers are typically cleaned twice per day. They are also cleaned with diluted \ncleaner. \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-24   Filed 05/10/20   Page 3 of 3\n8. I share six phones with the entire unit. The phones are not cleaned\nbetween each person’s phone calls. I usually place a sock over the phone or put the phone \ninside my t-shirt to protect against germs.  \n9. I have not observed many staff members wearing masks or gloves or\nwashing their hands more often. I have not observed staff checking temperatures of \nincoming persons or staff on a daily basis.  \n10. Staff have placed posters on the wall providing information about what the\nfacility is doing to prevent against transmission of the virus. They have also provided us \nwith two masks made out of the same cloth that our uniforms are made out of.  \n11. One person in my unit had a fever. He was taken off of his work\nassignment in the kitchen, but remained in the unit. Another person in my unit said he \nwas having trouble breathing. He went to medical briefly before being sent back to the \nunit.  \n12. I have been diagnosed with asthma.\n13. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

I, Anthony Toscano, declare as follows: \n2. I have been incarcerated at Willard-Cybulski Correctional Institution since November \n2019. I am 30 years old. I am housed in A dorm of Willard-Cybulski. To my knowledge, \nthere are 75 people housed in my unit. Usually, my unit holds a little over 100 people, but \nmany people have been transferred out recently, a lot of whom have been sick. \n3. Right now, I get 20 minutes out of the dorm per day of outdoor recreation with 9 other \npeople. I also use shared phones and showers that are located in the dorm. \n4.  In my dorm, we sleep approximately 2 feet apart. Our sleeping area is not cleaned nor \nsanitized by staff. We can request cleaning supplies to clean our own spaces.  \n5. I eat my meals in my dorm. During mealtimes, we are spaced less than six feet apart. \n6. The staff initially did not provide us with enough soap, but less than two weeks ago \nstarted giving us soap more consistently and now I have enough. \n7. I share 9 showers with approximately 75 other people in the unit. I also share 6 phones \nwith my entire unit. The phones and showers are typically sanitized once per day. \n8. Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, I have observed staff wearing masks and \ngloves, though not all of the staff wear them.  \n9. Staff have provided me with a one-page pamphlet guidance about how to protect myself \nand others from coronavirus transmission. They have provided me with two masks made \nout of cloth in approximately the first week of April. \n10.I have come into contact with at least 3 people in my facility who have shown symptoms \nof coronavirus. They were removed from the facility, but none of their spaces were \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-25   Filed 05/10/20   Page 3 of 3\n \ncleaned.

I have been incarcerated at Cheshire Correctional Institution since January \n2020. I am 27 years old. My sentence ends on May 27, 2020.  \n2.  I was housed in South Block-5, a general population unit, until Monday. \nTo my knowledge, there are about 100 people housed in my unit. \n3.  South Block-5 is double-celled, with two tiers. We are in our cells 22 \nhours a day. We get out once first shift and once second shift. When we get out, we are \nallowed to use phones or take a shower. We share 12 to 13 phones spread out around the \ndayroom. They usually aren’t sanitized between uses, but they started giving us Lemonall \nand letting us clean them between uses.  \n4.  The cleaning regimen in my unit is pretty much the same as it was before, \nexcept they don’t let us do cell cleanup anymore. They usually would come in every \nweek to let us clean out our cells, but since the pandemic, they don’t let us do that \nanymore. Usually, on Wednesdays and Fridays, we were on lockdown for training \npurposes, and we would be able to clean out our cells during that time, but since the \npandemic they stopped doing that.   \n5.  We share six showers among the whole unit. Nothing is really sanitized \nafter everyone uses it. There were a couple COs that had COVID-19 in Cheshire, but \nnobody in my block was sick that I’m aware of.  \n6.  At the beginning of April, they passed out a bar of soap per person. As of \nMonday, they had not done it again. You can buy soap from the commissary but it’s not \nantibacterial. It’s the same price as it was before.  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00534-JBA   Document 43-26   Filed 05/10/20   Page 3 of 3\n7.  On April 2, they passed out masks. The warden had come in earlier and \nsaid we could all get gloves, but the COs said no, so we don’t have gloves. We got a \nsecond mask about a week and a half ago. Some people are wearing them and some \npeople are not. \n8.  About the half the COs are wearing blue cloth masks. The rest are not.  \n9.  We still don’t have any social visits. We are getting two extra phone calls.  \n10.  I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

The telephones are only cleaned between rec shifts. \n9.  In this dorm, we get three rec shifts a day when we can go to a dayroom. \n10.  The corrections officers and nurses are wearing masks now. \n11.  All of our meals are brought to our dorm and we eat all meals sitting on our \nbunks. \n12.
