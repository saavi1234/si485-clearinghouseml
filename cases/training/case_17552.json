    "summary": "<p>On March 17, Michelle Ferrigno Warren, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, filed an action against the Colorado Secretary of State in the Denver District Court, seeking a court order to put her name on the primary ballot. She argued that COVID-19, and the resulting state of emergency, prevented her from collecting the required 1500 signatures before the deadline of March 7. The plaintiff had collected 5383 signatures of the 10,500 required and had only collected enough signatures in one of the state&rsquo;s districts. She further argued that she had demonstrated substantial compliance under the unprecedented circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The trial court ordered the plaintiff to be put on the June 30 Democratic primary ballot for U.S. Senate on April 21, finding that she had substantially complied with the signature threshold. The court found that a 50% threshold was reasonable, and that &ldquo;strict adherence to the signature requirement for primary petitions must yield to this unprecedented public health emergency.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The defendant appealed to the Colorado Supreme Court. On May 4, the Colorado Supreme Court held that the plaintiff did not collect the required signatures from each district and reversed the order of the district court. 462 P.3d 1081. They reasoned that the &ldquo;legislature alone has the authority to change the minimum signature requirements set out in the Election Code.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Assemb., 1st Leg. Sess. (Colo. 2020) ..... 8, 12, 20 \n \nviii \n \n\nPetitioner Jena Griswold, in her official capacity as Colorado \nSecretary of State (“the Secretary”), asks this Court to review the \nDenver District Court’s decision under § 1-1-113, C.R.S.1 (“Section \n113”).  \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe Court should accept jurisdiction over this appeal and reverse \nthe district court’s decision ordering the Secretary to place Michelle \nFerrigno Warren’s name on the June 2020 primary election ballot as a \nDemocratic candidate for U.S. Senate.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren filed a \nSection 113 action challenging the Secretary’s determination that she \nfailed to meet the valid signature threshold and distribution \nrequirements under the Election Code.2  The district court found Ms. \nFerrigno Warren’s signature gathering efforts were adversely impacted \nby the COVID-19 epidemic and concluded that she satisfied this Court’s \nthree-part substantial compliance test because she made a good faith \n \n1 All citations are to the 2019 version of the Colorado Revised Statutes, \nunless otherwise indicated. \n2 Uniform Election Code of 1992, § 1-1-101, et seq., C.R.S. (2019) \n(“Election Code”). \n1 \n \n\neffort to comply with Colorado’s longstanding ballot access laws.  In \ndoing so, the district court erred as a matter of law by focusing on the \ngood faith effort factor to the exclusion of the factors requiring a court to \nmeasure both the extent of noncompliance and determine whether the \npurpose of the valid signature threshold and distribution requirements \nwas substantially achieved despite the noncompliance. \nHere, the extent of Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s noncompliance with the \nElection Code is significant: she failed to obtain 1,500 valid signatures \nin six of seven congressional districts, collected only 21 to 39% of the \n1,500 valid signatures needed in four of seven congressional districts, \nand collected just over half of the total 10,500 valid signatures needed \nstatewide.  Due to these serious shortfalls, the purpose of the Election \nCode’s valid signature threshold and distribution requirements—which \nis to ensure that each candidate who appears on the primary ballot for \nan important federal office—has a significant modicum of statewide \nsupport, has not been substantially achieved.  Under this Court’s \nprecedent, these factors should have been dispositive, especially where, \nas here, the candidate’s plan to fully comply with those requirements \n2 \n \n\nwas speculative and flawed in its assumptions even absent the specter \nof COVID-19. \nBy elevating a candidate’s subjective intent to comply with the law \nabove her actual and significant degree of noncompliance with the law, \nthe district court’s decision disrupts well-established substantial \ncompliance precedent in the important ballot access context.  And \nstretching the substantial compliance standard so far as to allow a \ncandidate who fell so short of the mark to access the primary election \nballot is unfair to candidates who earned such access through full \ncompliance with the Election Code, as well as those who fell short but \nchose not to pursue litigation to circumvent Colorado’s ballot access \nrequirements.  Because most Section 113 actions are finally settled by \ndistrict courts, if this decision stands uncorrected, it could confuse ballot \naccess cases for years to come.  \n \n \n3 \n \n\nISSUE PRESENTED \n \nWhether a major party candidate may petition onto the primary \nballot for U.S. Senate under a substantial compliance standard if she \nfailed to obtain 1,500 valid signatures in six of seven congressional \ndistricts, collected only 21 to 39% of the 1,500 valid signatures needed \nin four of seven congressional districts, and collected just over half of \nthe total 10,500 valid signatures needed statewide. \nDECISION BELOW \n \nThe Secretary seeks review of the district court’s April 21, 2020 \ndecision in Ferrigno Warren v. Griswold, Denver District Court No. \n20CV31077.  App. H.  \nJURISDICTION \n \nThis Court has jurisdiction under Section 113(3), which permits a \nparty to seek review of a district court’s decision under Section 113(1) \n“within three days after the district court proceedings are terminated[.]” \n§ 1-1-113(3).  If this Court declines to accept jurisdiction, “the decision \nof the district court shall be final and not subject to further appellate \nreview.”  Id.  The district court issued its decision on April 21, 2020; this \n4 \n \n\napplication is timely filed within three days after the district court \nproceedings terminated.    \nEXISTENCE OF OTHER CASES \n \nThere are no other pending cases in which this Court has granted \ncertiorari review on the same legal issue.  The Secretary is aware of a \npending district court case, Bray v. Griswold, Denver District Court No. \n2020CV195 (Baumann J., presiding), involving a different Democratic \ncandidate for U.S. Senate and the same legal questions.  Although not \nyet filed as of the date and time of this filing, the Secretary understands \nthat a third unsuccessful Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, Lorena \nGarcia, will be filing a Section 113 action.    \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n \nI.  Legal framework for primary ballot access  \n \nA.  Major party candidates  \n \nIn Colorado, major party candidates may qualify for the primary \nballot through the traditional party caucus and assembly process, § 1-4-\n601, C.R.S., or by gathering signatures of electors on a petition. § 1-4-\n801, C.R.S.  To secure a nomination for the primary ballot for U.S. \n5 \n \n\nSenate as a member of a major political party by petition, a candidate \nmust collect at least 1,500 valid signatures of registered electors who \nshare the same party affiliation from each of Colorado’s seven \ncongressional districts, for a total of 10,500 valid signatures. § 1-4-\n801(2)(c)(II), C.R.S.  These are referred to throughout as the “threshold” \nand “distribution” requirements.  “[N]o petition is legal that does not \ncontain the requisite number of names of eligible electors[.]”  § 1-4-\n902(1), C.R.S. \nOnly eligible electors may sign candidate petitions. § 1-4-904(1), \nC.R.S.  To be eligible, an elector must be a registered elector and \naffiliated with the major political party named in the petition.  § 1-1-\n104(16), C.R.S.  In signing a petition, the elector must affirm he or she \nhas been affiliated with such party for at least twenty-nine days and \nhas not signed any other candidate petition for the same office.  § 1-4-\n904(2)(a), C.R.S. \nCandidates for statewide office must file their petition sections \nwith the Secretary.  § 1-4-907, C.R.S.  Upon receiving a candidate \npetition, the Secretary “review[s] all petition information and verif[ies] \n6 \n \n\nthe information against the registration records[.]” § 1-4-908(1), C.R.S. \nThe Secretary must notify the candidate of any errors or insufficiencies \nregarding circulator affidavits; a candidate then has five days to cure \nthe errors and insufficiencies described in the notice. § 1-4-912, C.R.S.  \nWhen verifying individual petition entries, the Secretary’s staff or \ndesignee checks each entry against the information in the statewide \nvoter registration database, known as “SCORE,” and either accepts or \nrejects petition entries according to the specific procedures set forth in \nthe Secretary’s Election Rule 15.1.  See 8 C.C.R. 1505-1, Rule 15.1.4; see \nalso § 1-4-908(1.5)(a), C.R.S.  The Secretary also compares each \nsignature on a statewide candidate’s petition “with the signature of the \neligible elector stored in the statewide voter registration system,” and \n“may use a signature verification device” to do so.  § 1-4-908(1.5)(a), \nC.R.S.   \nIf the Secretary determines “that the signature on the petition \ndoes not match the signature of the eligible elector stored in [SCORE],” \na second review must be undertaken by a member of her staff or her \ndesignee who is trained in signature verification.  § 1-4-908(1.5)(b)(I), \n7 \n \n\nC.R.S.  The Secretary must provide the candidate with notice of and an \nopportunity to cure within three days any signatures determined to be \nnon-matching after this second review.  § 1-4-908(1.5)(b)(I) and (II), \nC.R.S.  \nAfter completing her review of a candidate petition, the Secretary \nmust notify the candidate of the number of valid signatures and \nwhether the candidate appears to be sufficient or insufficient.  § 1-4-\n908(3), C.R.S.  Along with this statement regarding sufficiency, the \nSecretary provides each candidate with the master record of each \naccepted and rejected entry, along with the reason code for each rejected \nentry—which lists the date on which each signature was collected—that \nher staff is required to create and maintain as part of the review \nprocess.  8 C.C.R. 1505-1, Rule 15.1.4(b).   \nThe deadline for major party candidates to file their petitions with \nthe Secretary was March 17, 2020.  § 1-4-801(5)(a), C.R.S. (“[P]etitions \nmust be filed no later than the third Tuesday in March”).  The Secretary \nmust deliver the June 30 Primary Election ballot order and content to \ncounty clerks by May 7, 2020.  § 1-5-203(1)(c)(I), C.R.S.  The county \n8 \n \n\nclerks must transmit ballots to military and overseas voters by May 16 \nfor the June 30 Primary Election.  § 1-8.3-110(1), C.R.S.  This deadline \nis driven by the federal Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act, \n52 U.S.C. § 20302(a)(8)(A), and is not flexible.  Between May 7 and 16, \nColorado’s county clerks will work, often with sophisticated ballot \nprinters, on a near-round-the-clock basis to print and mail thousands of \nballots to achieve compliance with deadlines under state and federal \nlaw.         \nB.   House Bill 20-1359 \nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the General Assembly \npassed House Bill 20-1359, titled “An Act Concerning Modifications to \nParty Candidate Designation Requirements to Accommodate Public \nHealth Concerns,” which the Governor signed into law on March 16, \n2020.  See App. B, EX B (H.B. 20-1359, 73rd Gen. Assemb., 1st Leg. \nSess. (Colo. 2020)).  While an earlier version of the bill would have \nextended the deadline for filing major party candidate petitions by 14 \ndays “due to public health concerns,” App. B, EX C, the legislature voted \ndown the amendment in question and that provision was not included \n9 \n \n\nin the final version of the bill.  App. B, EX B.  Instead, the enacted \nversion of H.B. 20-1359 provides that, in 2020, the Secretary of State \nmay extend the filing deadline for a petition only if she “is unable to \naccept the filing because of closures or restrictions due to public health \nconcerns” except that “a signature gathered after the third Tuesday in \nMarch[, the statutory deadline for candidate petitions,] is invalid and \nshall not be counted.”  Id.  \nC.   Section 113 petitions and the substantial compliance \nstandard \n \nIf the Secretary “determines that a petition is insufficient, the \ncandidate named in the petition may petition the district court within \nfive days for a review of the determination pursuant to section 1-1-113.”  \n§ 1-4-909(1.5), C.R.S.  Section 113 is the “exclusive method for the \nadjudication of controversies arising from a breach or neglect of duty or \nother wrongful act that occurs prior to the day of an election.”  § 1-1-\n113(4), C.R.S.  Under Section 113, the reviewing trial court may only \nconsider claims that “a person charged with a duty under [the Election \nCode] has committed or is about to commit a breach or neglect of duty \nor other wrongful act[.]”  § 1-1-113(1), C.R.S.  After “notice to the official \n10 \n \n\nwhich includes an opportunity to be heard,” if the district court finds \ngood cause to conclude that the Secretary “has committed or is about to \ncommit a breach or neglect of duty or other wrongful act,” then it “shall \nissue an order requiring substantial compliance with the provisions of \n[the Election Code].”  Id.  \nThe Secretary must adhere to a technical compliance standard \nwhen carrying out her duties under the Election Code, which in the \ncandidate petition context means that she cannot lower the total \nthreshold signature amount, cannot waive the distribution requirement, \nand cannot count any invalid signatures toward either requirement.  \nBut a reviewing court with jurisdiction under Section 113 is authorized \nto apply a less rigorous “substantial compliance” standard under which \nit may liberally construe the Election Code in favor of ballot access.  § 1-\n1-103(1) & (3), C.R.S. (“[s]ubstantial compliance with the provisions or \nintent of [the Election Code] shall be all that is required”) (emphasis \nadded)).  A court considers the following nonexclusive list of factors in \ndetermining whether a party has substantially complied with statutory \nrequirements: \n11 \n \n\n(1)  the  extent  of  noncompliance;  (2)  the  purpose  of  the \napplicable  provision  and  whether  that  purpose  is \nsubstantially  achieved  despite  the  noncompliance;  and  (3) \nwhether there was a good-faith effort to comply or whether \nnoncompliance is based on a conscious decision to mislead the \nelectorate. \n \nFabec v. Beck, 922 P.2d 330, 341 (Colo. 1996) (citing Loonan v. Woodley, \n882 P.2d 1380, 1384 (Colo. 1994)).  These are referred to herein as the \nLoonan factors.    \nII.  Facts and procedural history \nA.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s candidate petition \nMs.  Ferrigno Warren is a candidate for U.S. Senate who sought \nnomination by petition to the Democratic primary election ballot.  App. \nH, p 5.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren notified the Colorado Secretary of State of \nher decision to seek access to the primary election ballot via the petition \nprocess on January 5, 2020.  Id.  Under the Election Code, candidates \nseeking nomination by petition to the 2020 primary ballot had 57 days \n(from January 21, 2020 until March 17, 2020) to gather petition \nsignatures.  See § 1-4-801(5)(a), C.R.S. (2020), and H.B. 20-1359.  App \nH., p 6. \n12 \n \n\nMs. Ferrigno Warren and approximately 100 volunteer circulators \nbegan gathering signatures on the first day of the nearly two-month \ncollection window.  Id. at 6; see also App. F.  Volunteer circulator efforts \nfocused on the 1st, 2nd, and 6th congressional districts.  App. G, TR \n4/16/2020, p 17:4–10.  She retained a political petition circulation firm, \nGround Organizing for Latinos, to use paid circulators to gather one-\nhalf of the required signatures between March 5, 2020 and the deadline \nof March 17, 2020.  App. H, p 6; App. G, TR 4/16/2020, pp 45:23–46:1.  \nTo that end, her campaign entered into a $40,000 contract for the firm a \ntotal of 10,000 signatures with the apparent assumption that these \nsignatures would account for at least  half of the total 10,500 valid \nsignatures needed statewide.  Ex. H, p 6.  Paid circulators planned to \ncollect signatures from 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 7th congressional districts \nbetween March 5 and 17.  Id.; App. G, TR 4/16/2020, p 69:13–17.   \n  John Edward Soto, the owner of Ground Organizing for Latinos, \nadvised Ms. Ferrigno Warren, that based on past experience, he \nexpected the process to follow a “hockey stick” model: collection would \nstart at a slow pace in the first two months and then increase \n13 \n \n\nsignificantly during the final two weeks before the filing deadline.  App. \nH, p 6.  Mr. Soto’s model was based, in part, on the fact that signature \ncollection in colder months like January and February can be hampered \nby the weather and fewer potential electors being outdoors.  App. H, pp \n6–7.  In addition, Mr. Soto was unable to hire a large number of \ncirculators until after “Super Tuesday” (March 3, 2020) because many \ncampaign staff in the state were working for other better-funded \ncampaigns and being paid three to four times the average rate of pay.  \nAppx. H, p 7.  He admitted that 2020 was the first year in which \nColorado participated in Super Tuesday, App. G, TR 4/16/2020, p 67:23–\n25, so its effect on signature collection efforts was unpredictable.  This \nuncertainty existed regardless of COVID-19. \nAs the district court found, Ms. Ferrigno Warren also admitted \nthat there were risks unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic in waiting \nuntil the last two weeks to gather half of her signatures and submit her \npetition for review on the last day of the collection period.  App. H, p 7.  \nThese risks included collecting signatures from registered electors who \nwere ineligible to sign her petition due to having signed another \n14 \n \n\ncandidate’s petition for the same office (which under Rule 15.1.4 would \nbe invalidated on her petition even if it was signed first in time if it was \nturned-in for review after the other candidate’s petition), or events like \na blizzard that could impede travel and keep potential signers indoors.  \nSee App. H, p 7; App. G, TR 4/16/2020, pp 45:23–47:13.   \nFurther, there is additional evidence in the record, not cited by the \ndistrict court opinion, that Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s strategy was highly \nspeculative.  She testified that she retained Mr. Soto’s firm to gather \nhalf the number of valid signatures needed between March 5 and 17, \nsee App. G, TR 4/16/2020, pp 77:4–10, 45:23–46:1, based on her \nassumption that she would have succeeded in collecting the other half \nusing volunteer circulators before March 5.  But the record reflects that \nher campaign, in fact, had collected under one-third of the 10,500 total \nvalid signatures needed statewide before March 5.  App. B (showing \nonly 3,134 valid signatures collected through March 4, 2020); see also \nApp. G, TR 4/16/2020, p 99:25–100:6.  Even if Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s \nplan to collect 5,250 valid signatures between March 5 and 17 had come \n15 \n \n\nto fruition, she still would have fallen short of the 10,500 threshold \nneeded to secure placement on the ballot.  \nOn March 5, 2020, Mr. Soto’s paid circulators began working for \nMs. Ferrigno Warren’s campaign to collect signatures.  App. H, p 3.  As \nthe district court found, Ms. Ferrigno Warren asserts that starting the \nweekend of March 7 and accelerating after Governor Jared Polis’s \ndeclaration of a State of Emergency on March 10, multiple circulators \n(both paid and volunteer) quit her campaign and a few volunteers who \nhad collected signatures said they refused to turn them into the \ncampaign for fear of exposure.  App. H, p 4.  In addition, Ms. Ferrigno \nWarren asserts some of her volunteers and staff began to exhibit \nsymptoms or had family members with symptoms of COVID-19.  Id.  \nMs. Ferrigno Warren thus began to scale back her circulation efforts on \nMarch 13th and 14th.  Id.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren maintains she also \nreduced her circulation efforts due, in part, to being informed on or \nabout March 12 by the Secretary and the Colorado Democratic Party of \npending legislation in the Colorado General Assembly that might \ninclude a remedy to allow petitioning candidates additional time for \n16 \n \n\nsignature collection.  App. G, TR 4/16/2020, pp 31:15–41:17; App. H, pp \n8–9.  As a separate issue, Mr. Soto testified that prior to March 8, the \npaid circulation was proceeding well, but that beginning on March 8, \nseveral paid circulators stopped circulating petitions due to concerns \nabout exposure to COVID-19, and those that continued circulating \nfound it more difficult to gather signatures because potential electors \nwere not inclined to open their doors or engage with circulators.  App. \nH, p 8.  \nMs. Ferrigno Warren ultimately decided to suspend circulation on \nthe afternoon of March 14 even though she had gathered less than the \nrequired number of signatures.  Id. at 9. \nB.  The Secretary’s Statement of Insufficiency  \nMs. Ferrigno Warren submitted her petition to the Secretary for \nreview on March 17, 2020.  App. E.  The Secretary determined Ms. \nFerrigno Warren submitted 8,378 reviewable signature lines.  Id.  After \nthe Secretary completed the required petition review, the Secretary \nissued a Statement of Insufficiency, on April 15, 2020, finding Ms. \nFerrigno Warren submitted only 5,383 valid signatures.  Id.  This \n17 \n \n\nrepresents only 51.2% of the total number of valid signatures required \nstatewide by § 1-4-801(2)(c)(II), C.R.S.  App. H, p 9.  As demonstrated \nbelow, Ms. Ferrigno Warren collected much less than 51.2% of the \nsignatures required on a district-by-district basis in four of seven \ncongressional districts. \nIn addition, the Secretary provided Ms. Ferrigno Warren with the \nmaster record of each accepted and rejected signature entry.  App. F.  \nThe master record contains the reason code for each rejected entry and \nthe date on which the signature was collected.  See id.  \nThe Statement of Insufficiency includes a breakdown of the valid \nsignatures gathered from each congressional district.  The statement \ndemonstrates that Ms. Ferrigno Warren gathered:  \n•  1st congressional district: 1,036 valid signatures or 69% of \nthe required number of valid signatures; \n•  2nd congressional district: 1,502 valid signatures, satisfying \nthe required number of signatures;  \n•  3rd congressional district: 315 valid signatures, or 21% of \nthe required number of valid signatures;  \n18 \n \n\n•  4th congressional district: 313 valid signatures, or 20.8% of \nthe required number of valid signatures;  \n•  5th congressional district 490 valid signatures, or 32.6% of \nthe required number of valid signatures;  \n•  6th congressional district: 1,139 valid signatures, or 75.9% of \nthe required number of valid signatures; and  \n•  7th congressional district 588 valid signatures, or 39.2% of \nthe required number of valid signatures. \nApp. H, p 10; App. E.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren submitted less than 1,500 \nvalid signatures in six of seven congressional districts.  App. H, p 10; \nApp. E.  Under the Election Code, a candidate must gather at least \n1,500 valid signatures in each congressional district to access the \nprimary election ballot.  §§ 1-4-801(2)(c)(II) and -902(1). \nC.  The district court proceedings and order placing Ms. \nFerrigno Warren on the ballot \n \nMs. Ferrigno Warren’s Section 113 petition: The same day she \nsubmitted her candidate petition sections to the Secretary, Ms. Ferrigno \nWarren filed a petition under §§ 1-4-909 and 1-1-113, C.R.S., alleging \nthat the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting State of Emergency \n19 \n \n\ndeclared by the Governor of Colorado prevented her from gathering \nsufficient signatures to be placed on the ballot.  App. A.  She asked the \nCourt to order the Secretary to do so under a substantial compliance \ntheory.3  Id.  Upon receiving the petition, the district court ordered pre-\nhearing briefing and conducted an evidentiary hearing on April 16, \n2020.  App. G. \nThe  proposed discount-rate formula:  In the Secretary’s hearing \nbrief and at the hearing, she urged the district court to utilize a \nmathematical formula that is capable of being applied neutrally and \nconsistently to Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s and other candidate petitions \nthat may have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to determine \nwhether the substantial compliance standard has been met.  App. B, p \n10–14.  Specifically, the Secretary argued the court should calculate and \napply a discount-rate to determine whether a candidate substantially \ncomplied based on the following factors:   \n \n3 Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s Section 113 petition also asked for additional \ntime to collect signatures after the State of Emergency ends and \nasserted an equal protection claim.  These issues are not before the \nCourt on appeal.  \n \n20 \n \n\na.  The 10,500 signatures and 1,500 signatures per congressional \ndistrict requirements:  Ms. Ferrigno Warren was required to \ngather at least 1,500 valid signatures from each of Colorado’s \nseven congressional district, for a total of at least 10,500 valid \nsignatures.  § 1-4-801(2)(c)(II).   \n  \nb.  The 57-day statutory period for signature gathering: Under the \nElection Code, candidates had 57 days, beginning January 21, \n2020 through and including March 17, 2020, to gather petition \nsignatures.  § 1-4-801(5)(a) (2020); H.B. 20-1359.   \n  \nc.  Time period during which COVID-19 obstructed signature \ncollection:  The court should make a factual finding as to the date \non which Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s ability to collect signatures was \nlimited by COVID-19.  \n  \nd.  The requirement that only eligible (i.e., registered) electors may \nsign a candidate petition.  § 1-4-904(1).   \n \nSee App. B, p 11.   \n \nThe Secretary proposed that the court then calculate a discount-\nrate using the following three-step formula:4  (1) divide the total \namount of valid signatures required (10,500) by the total number of \ndays permitted for signature collection (57) to determine the per-day \naverage number of valid signatures to be collected statewide (185); (2) \nthen divide that number by seven to determine the per-day average \n \n4 Rounding up to whole numbers. \n21 \n \n\nnumber of valid signatures to be collected in each congressional district \n(27); and (3) then multiply that number by the total number of calendar \ndays on which the Court finds that COVID-19 obstructed the signature \ncollection process.  Id. at 11–12.  That total is the discount-rate to be \nsubtracted from the 1,500 valid signatures required from each \ncongressional district as a substantial compliance allowance.  Id. at 12.  \nAs set forth in the Secretary’s brief, and discussed in detail below at pp \n39–44, this discount-rate formula is consistent with the Loonan \nsubstantial compliance factors.    \n  The district court’s opinion:  \nAt the April 16, 2020 evidentiary hearing, Ms. Ferrigno Warren \npresented her own testimony and testimony by Mr. Soto, the owner of \nGround Organizing for Latinos.  App. G.  The Secretary presented \ntestimony by Joel Albin, Ballot Access Manager for the Secretary.  Id.    \nThe district court issued a decision on April 21, 2020 holding that \nMs. Ferrigno Warren substantially complied with the signature \nthreshold and distribution requirements of the Election Code finding \n22 \n \n\neach factor of Loonan, 882 P.2d 1380 (Colo. 1994), weighs in favor of \nallowing Ms. Ferrigno Warren ballot access.  App. H, pp 24–29.   \nThe district court declined to adopt the Secretary’s proposed \ndiscount-rate formula, concluding it did not account for Ms. Ferrigno \nWarren’s “hockey stick” model of signature collection which focused on \nthe last twelve days of the signature gathering window.  Id. at 26.  \nConcluding that Ms. Ferrigno Warren substantially complied with the \nElection Code’s signature threshold, distribution, and validity \nrequirements, the Court ordered the Secretary of State to place Ms. \nFerrigno Warren on the 2020 Democratic primary ballot as a candidate \nfor United States Senate. Id. at 28.  The Secretary now seeks review \nand reversal of the district court’s decision.  \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  Standard of review and preservation \n \nIn reviewing a district court’s order, this Court defers to a district \ncourt’s findings of fact if they are supported by the record and reviews \nthe district court’s legal determinations de novo.  Kuhn v. Williams, 418 \nP.3d 478, 483 (Colo. 2018) (citing Jones v. Samora, 318 P.3d 462, 467 \n23 \n \n\n(Colo. 2014); Hanlen v. Gessler, 333 P.3d 41, 48 (Colo. 2014)).  “Whether \na statute requires strict or substantial compliance is a question of \nstatutory construction ... which [the Court] review[s] de novo.”  Colorow \nHealth Care, LLC v. Fischer, 420 P.3d 259, 261–62 (Colo. 2018) (citing \nFinnie v. Jefferson Cty. Sch. Dist. R–1, 79 P.3d 1253, 1255–58 (Colo. \n2003); Lewis v. Taylor, 375 P.3d 1205, 1208 (Colo. 2016)).  Where “the \ntrial court rules sua sponte on an issue, the merits of its ruling are \nsubject to review on appeal, whether timely objections were made or \nnot.”  Rinker v. Colina-Lee, 452 P.3d 161, 168 (Colo. App. 2019).   \nThe issues presented herein were preserved below.  See App. B, p \n10–14; App. G, TR 4/16/2020, pp 98:6–107:25; App. H, p 21–29.  \nII.  The Court must determine whether the substantial \ncompliance standard applies here.  \n \nAlthough the Secretary is bound by a technical compliance \nstandard, in a Section 113 proceeding, a court “upon a finding of good \ncause … shall issue an order requiring substantial compliance with the \nprovisions of this code.”  § 1-1-113(1).  Further, the Election Code \nprovides it is to be “liberally construed” and “[s]ubstantial compliance \n24 \n \n\nwith the provisions or intent of [the Election Code] shall be all that is \nrequired for the proper conduct of an election[.]”  § 1-1-103(1), (3). \nHowever, the Secretary recognizes that under this Court’s \nprecedent, a substantial compliance analysis does not apply to every \nrequirement under the Election Code.  Most recently in Kuhn, 418 P.3d \nat 488 n.4, the Court held “residency is not a mere technical \nrequirement that is subject to substantial compliance…. A person either \nis a resident for purposes of the Election Code or he is not.”  See also \nLoonan, 882 P.2d at 1385 (applying substantial compliance analysis but \nholding that proponents could not substantially comply with 1993 law \nwhere petition sections failed include circulator affidavit required by \n1993 amendments).  Similarly, even where the legislature provides that \nsubstantial compliance applies, strict compliance may apply to \nmandatory or jurisdictional components of a statute.  See E. Lakewood \nSanitation Dist. v. Dist. Ct. In and For County of Jefferson, 842 P.2d \n233, 235-36 (Colo. 1992) (substantial compliance analysis applies to \ncontents of claimants’ notice but strict compliance applies to statute’s \njurisdictional requirement that such notice be filed within 180 days).  \n25 \n \n\nThis Court recently held that “[t]he key question we must answer in \ndeciding between strict and substantial compliance is which standard \nbetter effectuates the General Assembly’s purpose.”  Colorow, 420 P.3d \nat 264.   \nIn light of the legislative intent stated in § 1-1-103(1) and (3), the \nSecretary agrees that a substantial compliance standard applies to a \ncandidate whose ability to comply with the requirements of §§ 1-4-\n801(2)(c)(II) and -902(1) were negatively impacted by COVID-19.  But to \nthe extent this Court disagrees, it may reverse the district court on the \nalternate grounds that strict compliance with §§ 1-4-801(2)(c)(II) and  \n-902(1) is required here.  See C.A.R. 1(d) (an appellate “court may in its \ndiscretion notice any error appearing of record” whether or not it was \nraised below).    \nIII.  Because Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s petition does not \nsubstantially comply with the threshold and \ndistribution requirements of § 1-4-801(2)(c)(II), the \ndistrict court order conflicts with this Court’s \nprecedent. \n \nA good faith effort alone does not amount to substantial \ncompliance.  By crediting a candidate’s subjective efforts to comply with \n26 \n \n\nthe law, to the exclusion other substantial compliance factors requiring \na court to measure both the extent of noncompliance and determine \nwhether the purpose of the law was substantially achieved despite the \nnoncompliance, the district court’s order conflicts with this Court’s \nprecedent on substantial compliance.  Because the extent of Ms. \nFerrigno Warren’s noncompliance was significant and the purpose of \nElection Code’s signature threshold and distribution requirements were \nnot substantially achieved, the district court erred in concluding that \nMs. Ferringo Warren substantially complied with the Election Code.    \nA.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s noncompliance is extensive. \n \nThe district court erred by failing to properly assess the extent of \nMs. Ferrigno Warren’s noncompliance.  That failure led the district \ncourt to misapply Loonan’s first factor, which supports reversal. \nIn assessing the extent of non-compliance, courts should \ndistinguish between “isolated examples of … oversight and what is \nmore properly viewed as systematic disregard of [a statute’s] \nrequirements[.]”  Bickel v. City of Boulder, 885 P.2d 215, 227 (Colo. \n1994).  This Court has characterized compliance as substantial when it \n27 \n \n\nis “considerably more than minimal, but less than absolute.” Woodsmall \nv. Regl. Transp. Dist., 800 P.2d 63, 68 (Colo. 1990) (emphasis added).  \n“Substantial” is defined as “[c]onsiderable in extent, amount, or value; \nlarge in volume or number,” BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1728 (11th ed. \n2019), and as “…to a large degree or in the main” and “of or relating to \nthe main part of something,” WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL \nDICTIONARY 2280 (2002).  In short, to substantially comply, a candidate \nmust comply in large part.   \nUnder § 1-4-801(2)(c)(II), Ms. Ferrigno Warren was required to \ncollect a total of 10,500 valid signatures.  The statute is very specific \nabout the composition of those 10,500 signatures: they must include at \nleast 1,500 valid signatures of registered electors who share the same \nparty affiliation from each of Colorado’s seven congressional districts.  \n§ 1-4-801(2)(c)(II), C.R.S.  In examining the extent of non-compliance, \nthe district court determined Ms. Ferrigno Warren gathered 51.2% of \nthe total number of valid signatures required by section 1-4-\n801(2)(c)(II).  App. H, p  24.  The district court found she collected \nsignificantly less than 50% of the required signatures in four of the \n28 \n \n\nseven districts:  21% in the 3rd congressional district; 20.8% in the 4th \ncongressional district; 32.6% in the 5th congressional district; and \n39.2% in the 7th congressional district.  Id.  But the district court \nminimized the significance of her shortfall in these four districts, \nreasoning that Ms. Ferrigno Warren had a “well planned strategy to use \npaid circulators during the final twelve days of the collection window to \ngather signatures” in those districts.  Id.  In so reasoning, the district \ncourt improperly discounted the severity of her non-compliance. \nMs. Ferrigno Warren’s noncompliance with the valid signature \nthreshold and distribution requirements is significant.  The fact that \nshe gathered just over half of the 10,500 valid signatures needed \nstatewide is closer to a “systematic disregard” of § 1-4-801(2)(c)(II)’s \nrequirements rather than an “isolated example[ ] of … oversight[.]”  \nBickel, 885 P.2d at 227.  Likewise, her collection only 21%–39% of the \n1,500 signatures required from each district demonstrates a \nfundamental failure to comply with the distribution requirement.   \nThe district court discounted the severity of this failure based on \nthe extrapolation that, had Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s chosen strategy of \n29 \n \n\nwaiting until the last two weeks of the nearly two-month collection \nperiod to gather fully half of the 10,500 valid signatures needed \nstatewide gone as planned, she would have collected the 1,500 valid \nsignatures needed in each district.  App. H, p 26.  This guesswork must \nbe rejected, as must the district court’s improper crediting of her ability \nto shoot closer to the mark in three districts over her significant \nundershooting in the four remaining districts.  To allow this flawed \nreasoning to stand is inconsistent with § 1-4-801(2)(c)(II)’s requirement \nthat candidates gather 1,500 signatures from each district.  The district \ncourt’s reasoning is further flawed because while Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s \ngood faith is relevant to the third Loonan factor, it is not grounds for \nminimizing the extent of her noncompliance under the first factor.  By \ndownplaying the high degree of her noncompliance in that way, the \ndistrict court misapplied this Court’s Loonan test. \nMs. Ferrigno Warren’s noncompliance with § 1-4-801(2)(c)(II) is \nsignificant and weighs strongly against a conclusion of substantial \ncompliance here.  Her failure to gather more than 21%–39% of the \nrequired number of signatures in four of seven congressional districts, \n30 \n \n\nand just over half of the total signatures needed statewide, cannot be \ncharacterized as compliance in large part with the Election Code’s \nsignature and distribution requirements.  In short, 50% does not \nachieve substantial compliance, and 20% is not even close.  \nB.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s petition fails to substantially \nachieve the purpose of Colorado’s ballot access laws. \n \nLoonan’s second factor examines the purpose of the applicable \nstatutory provision and determines whether that purpose is \nsubstantially achieved despite noncompliance.  Loonan, 882 P.2d at \n1384.  Here, the purpose of the valid signature threshold and \ndistribution requirements is two-fold: (1) to ensure that a candidate \nappearing on the primary ballot has a “significant modicum of support,” \nUtah Republican Party v. Cox, 892 F.3d 1066, 1089 (10th Cir. 2018) \n(quotations omitted); and (2) that such support exists throughout the \nentire State.  Indeed, the district-by-district distribution requirement \nprovides the yardstick by which that modicum of statewide support is \nmeasured.  The second Loonan factor requires these purposes to be \nsubstantially achieved despite Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s failure to fully \ncomply, which is fatal to her Section 113 action. \n31 \n \n\nColorado is not the only State that requires the gathering of \nsignatures throughout the State to make the ballot.  In the initiative \ncontext, half of the states with initiatives imposed a geographic \ndistribution requirement on petition signatures as of 2012.  Angle v. \nMiller, 673 F.3d 1122, 1135 (9th Cir. 2012).  Geographic distribution \nrequirements like Colorado’s “reflect[ ] the view that ‘[such \nrequirements] … are important because they force initiative proponents \nto demonstrate that their proposal has support statewide, not just \namong the citizens of the state’s most populous region.’”  Id. (quoting a \n2010 National Conference of State Legislatures webpage)5; see also \nMass. Pub. Interest Research Group v. Secretary of Commonwealth, 375 \nN.E.2d 1175, 1183 (Mass. 1978) (suggesting that a geographic \ndistribution requirement “guard[ed] against the proliferation of ballot \nquestions that are essentially local in effect”); Petition of Berg, 713 A.2d \n1106, 1109 (Pa. 1998) (identifying “[t]he state’s interest in managing \n \n5 The webpage quoted by Angle is no longer available, but a version \nupdated in 2012 is available at https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-\nand-campaigns/signature-requirements.aspx (last visited April 23, \n2020). \n32 \n \n\nthe ballot size and ensuring statewide support for candidates” as the \nbasis for a geographic distribution requirement). \nCandidates for the U.S. Senate, like Ms. Ferrigno Warren, seek to \nrepresent not two or three of Colorado’s congressional districts, but all \nseven of them.  This reality underscores the importance of carefully \ncrafting the substantial compliance standard here to achieve the two-\nfold purpose of the signature threshold and distribution requirements.  \nHere, the district court concluded that “a 50% threshold [of the total \n10,500 signatures required] is a reasonable line to draw” to determine \nsubstantial compliance.  App. H, p 25.  But this 50% threshold is not \ncarefully crafted because it is contrary to the plain meaning of the word \n“substantial.”  Indeed, complying halfway with any numeric threshold is \nnot compliance “to a large degree or in the main.”  WEBSTER’S, at 2280.    \nAdditionally, the district court did not apply its own standard \nconsistently.  Rather, it applied the 50% threshold only to the total \nnumber of signatures Ms. Ferrigno Warren must obtain statewide, but \nnot to the number of signatures she was required to obtain in each \ndistrict.  When examining Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s signature collection \n33 \n \n\ndistrict-by-district, the court below emphasized her “honest effort to \ncollect signatures in every congressional district.”  Id. at 26.  But as \nwith the first Loonan factor, Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s “honest effort” \ncannot serve to minimize her petition’s failure to substantially achieve \nthe purpose of the signature threshold and distribution requirements. \nFurther, Ms. Ferrigno Warren satisfied the district court’s 50% \nthreshold in only three of seven districts, which comprise far less than \nhalf of Colorado.  She also obtained less than 40% of the required \nsignatures in the remaining four districts and fell as low as 21% in two \nof those four districts.  When the district court’s 50% threshold is \napplied consistently, Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s petition falls well short of \nsubstantially achieving the district-by-district purpose of Colorado’s \ndistribution requirement. \n Where, as here, the statutory requirement “directly and clearly” \naddresses the issue and Ms. Ferrigno Warren failed to even approach \ncompliance, the second Loonan factor is “dispositive.”  See Bickel, 885 \nP.2d at 236–37.  Here, the purpose of the applicable statutory \nrequirements is clearly and directly stated: a candidate must collect \n34 \n \n\nenough signatures to demonstrate a significant modicum of support in \nevery congressional district.  Because Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s petition \nfailed achieve this purpose both as a whole and within every district, \nthe district court erred in concluding that she substantially complied \nwith the Election Code.  \nC.  The district court improperly weighted the third \nLoonan factor; good faith effort alone is insufficient. \n   \nThe district court improperly elevated the third Loonan factor \nabove the first and second in concluding that a good faith strategy to \ncomply constitutes substantial compliance.  This holding conflicts with \nthis Court’s established precedent under which a good faith effort alone \nis insufficient.  See Bickel, 885 P.2d at 236–37 (holding that second \nLoonan factor was “dispositive” despite finding that city acted in “good \nfaith”).  If not reversed, the district court’s holding could greatly confuse \nother Colorado courts regarding proper application of the Loonan \nfactors. \nUnder the third Loonan factor, a court considers “whether it can \nreasonably be inferred that the [party] made a good faith effort to \ncomply or whether the [party’s] noncompliance is more properly viewed \n35 \n \n\nas the product of an intent to mislead the electorate.”  Loonan, 882 P.2d \nat 1384 (quotations and citations omitted).  This Court has never held \nthat a showing of “good faith” alone is sufficient to demonstrate \nsubstantial compliance where the first two factors weigh heavily \nagainst a such a conclusion.  Instead, this Court has held on numerous \noccasions that a party acting in good faith failed to substantially \ncomply, either due to the extent of non-compliance or because the \nstatutory purpose was not achieved despite the non-compliance.  See \nBickel, 885 P.2d at 236-37 (holding that second Loonan factor was \n“dispositive” despite finding that city acted in “good faith”); Erickson v. \nBlair, 670 P.2d 749, 752, 757 (Colo. 1983) (holding contradictory and \ndeficient absentee voter affidavits did not substantially comply with \nElection Code, although  “no person involved in the election had \nengaged in fraud or other wrongdoing”); see also Buckley v. Chilcutt, 968 \nP.2d 112, 114 (Colo. 1998) (reversing district court’s placement of \ninitiative on ballot and directing the Secretary to conduct a line-by-line \nreview of signatures, notwithstanding Secretary’s good faith efforts to \ncomply with law).  As the Supreme Court of Texas held, “it is clear that \n36 \n \n\na person’s good faith is not enough for substantial compliance when \nessential statutory requirements ... are not met.”  Edwards Aquifer \nAuth. v. Chem. Lime, Ltd., 291 S.W.3d 392, 403 (Tex. 2009).    \nIndeed, this Court has only given more weight to the third factor \nwhen the trial court record reflects that a party intentionally violated \nthe law or engaged in fraud.  See Loonan, 882 P.2d at 1386 (holding \nthat the second factor was dispositive, but also holding that the third \nfactor weighed against substantial compliance where party \n“disregarded” and “did not read [controlling] laws much less understand \nthem”); see also Erickson, 670 P.2d at 753–54 (indicating “substantial \ncompliance” standard not appropriate where a showing of “fraud, undue \ninfluence, or intentional wrongdoing” is made).  This Court’s precedent \nindicates that while a finding of fraud might be dispositive of the \nsubstantial compliance analysis, a finding of good faith alone is not.   \nContrary to this settled precedent, the district court here allowed \nits finding of Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s good-faith intent to direct its \nultimate holding that her petition substantially complied with the \nElection Code.  The district court improperly applied a “good faith” \n37 \n \n\noverlay to the first two Loonan factors, elevating the third factor above \nthe first two.  Despite finding that Ms. Ferrigno Warren gathered only \nbetween 20% and 39% of the 1,500 needed signatures in a majority of \ncongressional districts and just over half of the 10,500 total signatures \nneeded statewide, the district court discounted the severity of the \nnoncompliance because Ms. Ferrigno had a “well-planned strategy” to \ngather those signatures absent COVID-19.  And with regard to the \nsecond factor, the district court emphasized Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s \n“honest effort” to comply with the law, avoiding the conclusion dictated \nby its factual findings that the purpose of § 1-4-801(2)(c)(II) was not \nsubstantially achieved despite the extent of noncompliance.6  App. H, p \n24-25.  Because the district court’s decision conflates a sound signature-\ncollecting strategy with substantial compliance, it must be reversed.  \nGood faith alone does not amount to substantial compliance.   \n \n \n6 As explained in the Statement of the Case above, Ms. Ferrigno Warren \nfailed to collect half of the required signatures by March 5, despite her \nplan to do so and prediction that she would.  So even absent COVID-19, \nher chosen strategy was unlikely to have been successful. \n38 \n \n\nD.  The Secretary’s formula provides the best means of \nassessing substantial compliance. \n \nColorado has been in a declared state of disaster emergency since \nMarch 10, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  But notably, other \ncandidates—including at least one other Democratic candidate for U.S. \nSenate—have successfully petitioned onto the primary ballot through \nstrict compliance with the Election Code’s signature threshold, \ndistribution, and validity requirements.  As a result, the COVID-19 \npandemic alone does not justify granting blanket ballot access to others \nwho tried and failed to do the same.  If the signature threshold can be \nsatisfied using substantial instead of strict compliance, the district \ncourt’s inconsistently-applied 50% threshold is not the best standard \nbecause it is contrary to the plain meaning of  the word “substantial” \nand fails to comport with this Court’s settled precedent. In contrast, the \nSecretary’s discount-rate formula provides the best yardstick by which \nthis and other courts measure substantial compliance during the \nCOVID-19 outbreak. \nThe substantial compliance standard applied here should promote \nfairness and meaningful compliance with the Election Code.  Colorado \n39 \n \n\ncandidates rely on the clear requirements in the Election Code when \nthey determine, for example, whether to seek qualification for the \nprimary ballot through the party assembly process or through \nsignature-gathering on a petition.  The district court’s 50% threshold is \narbitrary, does not account for a candidate’s individual circumstances \n(e.g., how many days a campaign was adversely affected by COVID-19), \nand negates the district-by-district distribution requirement.  Such a \nstandard would disadvantage candidates who chose the party assembly \nprocess or who collected more signatures than Ms. Ferrigno Warren but \nchose not to litigate despite also being unsuccessful.  The only way to \ntreat all similarly situated candidates fairly is to adopt the Secretary’s \nformula. \nThe Secretary urged the court below to do so because it is capable \nof being applied neutrally and consistently to this and other candidate \npetitions that may have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in \ndetermining whether the substantial compliance standard has been \nsatisfied.  This formula is outlined in detail above, at pp 20–22.  Here, \nthe district court determined that Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s signature \n40 \n \n\ncollection effort was affected by COVID-19, at the earliest, on March 7, \n2020.  Therefore, her campaign was adversely affected by COVID-19, at \nmost, for 11 days.  Under the Secretary’s formula, this results in a \nCOVID-19 discount rate of 324 signatures per congressional district.  \nThus, Ms. Ferrigno Warren would need to gather at least 1,176 valid \nsignatures per congressional district, for a total of at least 8,232 valid \nsignatures statewide in order to satisfy the substantial compliance \nstandard.    \nApplying the Secretary’s discount-rate is consistent with the \nsubstantial compliance factors set forth by Loonan, 882 P.2d at 1384.  \nUnder that precedent, a court considers the following non-exclusive list \nof factors in determining whether a party has substantially complied \nwith statutory requirements: \n(1)  the  extent  of  noncompliance,  (2)  the  purpose  of  the \napplicable  provision  and  whether  that  purpose  is \nsubstantially  achieved  despite  the  alleged  noncompliance, \nand (3) whether there was a good-faith effort to comply or \nwhether noncompliance is based on a conscious decision to \nmislead the electorate. \n  \nFabec, 922 P.2d at 341 (citing Loonan, 882 P.2d at 1384).   \n41 \n \n\n Here, the Secretary’s proposed formula would allow the Court to \nassess each factor.  First, the extent of each candidate’s noncompliance \nwith the signature threshold and distribution requirements will vary, \nbut the proposed formula measures it based on a neutral per-day \naverage number of valid signatures to be collected in each congressional \ndistrict and fairly discounts the days on which signature gathering \nactually was obstructed by COVID-19.  Moreover, the same formula can \nbe applied neutrally to different candidates and is easily adapted to \napply to candidates for offices with different signature threshold or \ndistribution requirements.  Here, Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s noncompliance \nis significant because she failed to collect the reduced requirement of \n1,176 valid signatures per congressional district in six of seven \ncongressional districts (and failed to collect anywhere near 50% of the \nreduced threshold in three of the seven districts).  See App. E.   \nSecond, the proposed formula is consistent with the purpose of the \napplicable signature threshold, distribution, and validity provisions: to \nensure that each candidate appearing on the primary ballot has \n“significant modicum of support.” Cox, 892 F.3d at 1089  (internal \n42 \n \n\ncitations omitted).  As the Tenth Circuit recently held, states have \nsignificant interests in “regulating the manner in which a candidate \nmay qualify for an election ballot[;]” “avoiding confusion, deception, and \neven frustration of the democratic process” in elections; “protecting the \nintegrity of their political processes from frivolous or fraudulent \ncandidacies[;]” “ensuring that their election processes are efficient[;]” \nand “avoiding voter confusion caused by an overcrowded ballot.”  Cox, \n892 F.3d at 1089–90 (internal citations omitted).  The Secretary’s \nproposed formula allows the Court to substantially achieve those \nimportant state interests by requiring candidates to comply with the \nstatutory purpose by demonstrating significant public support before \naccessing the primary ballot, while still relaxing the statutorily-\nrequired level of support due to COVID-19.  As demonstrated above, \nbecause Ms. Ferrigno Warren has not met the discount-rate formula in \nsix of seven congressional districts, she has not substantially complied \nwith the threshold and signature requirements.  \nAnd third, the Secretary’s proposed formula enables the Court to \nassess whether each candidate made a good-faith effort to comply with \n43 \n \n\nthe signature threshold, distribution, and validity requirements of the \nElection Code.  For each candidate petition review that her office \ncompletes, the Secretary must “notify the candidate of the number of \nvalid signatures and whether the petition appears to be sufficient or \ninsufficient.”  § 1-4-908(3), C.R.S.  Here, there is no dispute that Ms. \nFerrigno Warren acted with good-faith intentions, but she did choose to \nadopt a strategy that backloaded her collection efforts onto the final two \nweeks. Further, there is evidence in the record that other factors, such \nas Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s campaign budget, the retention of paid \npetition circulators by other campaigns, and winter weather prevented \nher from collecting signatures throughout the 57-day collection window.   \nBecause the first two Loonan factors weigh strongly against a \nfinding of substantial compliance here—even if this Court finds Ms. \nFerrigno Warren acted in good faith—the Court should reverse the \ndistrict court’s order requiring the Secretary to certify Ms. Ferrigno \nWarren to the primary election ballot.  \n \n \n44 \n \n\nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Secretary respectfully requests that \nthis Court accept this appeal and reverse that the district court’s order \ndirecting the Secretary to place Ms. Ferrigno Warren on the 2020 \nprimary election ballot as a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate. \n \nAPPENDIX \n \nA.

(2019), because she made a good \nfaith effort to collect signatures during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nWhile  substantial compliance  is  the  standard for technical deficiencies in  the \nelection law context, the Election Code’s minimum-signature mandate requires \nstrict compliance. \n\nBecause Ferrigno Warren did not meet the threshold signature requirement, \nthe Secretary properly declined to place her on the ballot. \nAccordingly, the order of the district court is reversed.\n \n \n\n \n \n \nThe Supreme Court of the State of Colorado \n2 East 14th Avenue • Denver, Colorado 80203 \n \n2020 CO 34 \n \nSupreme Court Case No. 20SA140 \nAppeal Pursuant to § 1-1-113(3), C.R.S.

One of the unfortunate impacts of the virus, and \nthe one at issue before us, is that it made it unexpectedly difficult for candidates \nseeking to place their names on the June Democratic primary ballot by petition to \ncollect signatures during the final weeks of the signature collection time period.  \nMichelle Ferrigno Warren, a candidate for the United States Senate, was unable to \ncollect  the  statutorily  required  1,500  signatures  in  six  of  the  seven  required \ncongressional districts.   \n¶2  Ferrigno Warren now argues that her name should nevertheless be placed \non  the  ballot  because,  under  these  unprecedented  circumstances,  her  efforts \ndemonstrate “substantial compliance” with the Election Code’s requirements.  The \nSecretary of State disagrees, arguing that “substantial compliance” should be \ndetermined  by  the  application  of  a  mathematical  formula  that  discounts  the \nsignature requirement by the number of days signature collection was impeded \nby  the  pandemic.    While  we  recognize  the  uniqueness  of  the  current \ncircumstances, we conclude that the legislature alone has the authority to change \nthe  minimum  signature  requirements  set  out  in  the  Election  Code.    That  a \ncandidate  must  obtain  1,500  signatures  from  each  of  Colorado’s  seven \ncongressional districts in order to be placed on the primary ballot as a candidate \nfor U.S. Senate is a mandate requiring strict compliance.  Because Ferrigno Warren \n3 \n \n\ndid not meet the threshold signature requirement, the Secretary properly declined \nto place her on the ballot.  We therefore reverse the district court’s order. \nI.  Facts and Procedural History \n¶3  Ferrigno Warren announced her candidacy for U.S. Senate in August 2019.  \nDuring the ensuing months she raised campaign funds, participated in debates \nand forums, and raised her profile on social media.  In January 2020, she informed \nthe Secretary of State, Jena Griswold, that she intended to seek access to the \nprimary ballot as a Democratic candidate through the petition process provided \nfor in Colorado’s Election Code.   \n¶4  Under the Code, candidates seeking nomination by petition had 57 days, \nfrom  January  21  to  March  17,  2020,  to  gather  petition  signatures.    See \n§ 1-4-801(5)(a), C.R.S. (2019).  Candidates for the U.S. Senate are required to collect \n1,500  signatures  from  each  of  the  state’s  seven  congressional  districts.  \n§ 1-4-801(2)(c)(II).  Ferrigno Warren began collecting signatures on January 21, \n2020, using a combination of volunteer and paid signature collectors.  The firm she \nhired to handle the paid collection, Ground Organizing for Latinos, planned to \nconduct  minimal  signature  collection  before  the  March  3,  2020  presidential \nprimary election and to do most of its work between March 5 and the March 17 \ndeadline.   \n4 \n \n\n¶5  Unfortunately for Ferrigno Warren, COVID-19 interfered with these plans.  \nOn March 5, 2020, Colorado officials announced the first two positive cases of \nCOVID-19 in the state.  On March 10, 2020, Governor Jared Polis declared a state \nof emergency due to the virus, and on March 13, 2020, the first Colorado death \nrelated to COVID-19 was announced.      \n¶6  Ferrigno Warren reports that fears about the highly contagious COVID-19 \nvirus caused multiple signature collectors—both paid and volunteer—to quit her \ncampaign.  Some volunteers who had collected signatures were unwilling to turn \nthem in to her office because they feared exposure.  Ferrigno Warren slowed her \nsignature collection efforts on March 13 and stopped them entirely on March 14. \n¶7  On March 17, 2020, Ferrigno Warren filed her petition sections, containing \na total of 8,378 signatures, with the Secretary of State’s office.  The Secretary \nreviewed the signatures as required by section 1-4-908, C.R.S. (2019), to determine \nhow many complied with the statutory requirements.  After completing that \nreview, the Secretary issued a Statement of Insufficiency on April 15, finding that \nFerrigno Warren had submitted only 5,383 valid signatures.  The Statement of \nInsufficiency  also  broke  the  valid  signatures  down  by  congressional  district, \ndemonstrating that Ferrigno Warren had collected: \n•  1,036 valid signatures in the 1st congressional district; \n•  1,502 valid signatures in the 2nd congressional district; \n5 \n \n\n•  315 valid signatures in the 3rd congressional district; \n•  313 valid signatures in the 4th congressional district; \n•  490 valid signatures in the 5th congressional district; \n•  1,139 valid signatures in the 6th congressional district; and \n•  588 valid signatures in the 7th congressional district.     \nIn sum, she reached the 1,500-vote threshold in only one of seven congressional \ndistricts. \n¶8  On  the  same  day  that  Ferrigno  Warren  submitted  her  petition  to  the \nSecretary for review, she filed an action in Denver District Court pursuant to \nsection 1-1-113, C.R.S. (2019), alleging that COVID-19 and the resulting state of \nemergency prevented her from collecting the required signatures.  She asked the \ncourt to order the Secretary to put her name on the ballot on the theory that the \nsignatures  on  her  petition  represented  “substantial  compliance”  with  the \nminimum signature requirements of section 1-4-801(2)(c)(II). \n¶9  The district court ordered briefing and held a hearing on April 16, 2020.  \nFerrigno Warren argued that she had made a good faith effort to comply with the \nsignature requirement and that the Election Code must be liberally construed to \npermit  ballot  access.    The  Secretary  agreed  with  Ferrigno  Warren  that  only \nsubstantial compliance with the signature requirement was necessary but argued \nthat Ferrigno Warren had not substantially complied.  The Secretary proposed a \nmathematical  “discount-rate”  formula  for  determining  substantial  compliance \n6 \n \n\nthat could be applied to evaluate not only Ferrigno Warren’s signature collection \nefforts, but also those of the other candidates whose signature collections may \nhave been hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n¶10  The Secretary’s proposed discount-rate formula would have the court first \ndivide the total number of valid signatures required by the total number of days \npermitted for collection to establish a per-day average number of valid signatures \nto be collected.  That number would then be multiplied by the total number of \ncalendar days on which the court finds that COVID-19 interfered with signature \ncollection.    The  remaining  total  would  be  the  “discount  rate”  that  could  be \nsubtracted from the 1,500 required signatures in each congressional district as a \n“substantial compliance allowance.” \n¶11  On April 21, 2020, the district court issued its order, directing the Secretary \nto place Ferrigno Warren’s name on the Democratic primary ballot.  In a detailed \nand thoughtful opinion, the district court acknowledged that the language of the \nElection Code requiring 1,500 signatures to be collected from each congressional \ndistrict “is clear and unequivocal and perhaps should end the Court’s inquiry right \nhere.”  Ferrigno Warren v. Griswold, No. 20CV31077, p. 21 (Denver Dist. Ct. Apr. 21, \n2020) (Order Regarding Petition for Declaratory Relief) (“District Court Order”).  \nHowever, because the Secretary had not made that argument and had instead \nconceded that the signature requirement was subject to a substantial compliance \n7 \n \n\nanalysis, the district court evaluated whether Ferrigno Warren had substantially \ncomplied.  Id. at pp. 21–27. \n¶12  In doing so, the court looked to our decisions in Loonan v. Woodley, 882 P.2d \n1380 (Colo. 1994), and Fabec v. Beck, 922 P.2d 330 (Colo. 1996).  In those opinions, \nwe  explained  that  a  district  court  evaluating  substantial  compliance  should \nconsider the following factors: (1) the extent of the noncompliance; (2) the purpose \nof the provision and whether that purpose was substantially achieved in spite of \nthe  lack  of  compliance;  and  (3)  whether  there  was  a  good  faith  effort  to \ncomply.  Fabec, 922 P.2d at 341; Loonan, 882 P.2d at 1384.  Applying these factors, \nthe court concluded that (1) Ferrigno Warren had collected more than 50 percent \nof the statewide total signature requirement of 10,500; (2) the purpose of requiring \n1,500 signatures from each congressional district is to demonstrate that a candidate \nhas a “significant modicum” of support and that the support comes from around \nthe state; (3) Ferrigno Warren did have some signatures from every congressional \ndistrict, demonstrating support around the state; and (4) Ferrigno Warren made a \ngood  faith  effort  to  comply  with  the  law  in  entirely  unprecedented  and \nunforeseeable circumstances.  District Court Order, pp. 24–27. \n¶13  While  acknowledging  that  the  Secretary’s  proposed  formula  is  “well \nthought out and easily applied in this case and others,” the court declined to use \nthat formula because of “the reality that signature collection often starts slow and \n8 \n \n\nbuilds in intensity as the deadline nears.”  Id. at p. 26.  The court concluded that a \nformula that treated every day of the signature collection period equally was \nflawed.  Id. at pp. 26–27.  Instead, the court concluded that, under all of the \ncircumstances,  and  considering  the  Loonan  factors,  Ferrigno  Warren  had \n“substantially  complied”  with  the  Election  Code’s  minimum  signature \nrequirements.  Id. at p. 28. \n¶14  The Secretary filed an application for review pursuant to section 1-1-113(3) \non April 24, 2020.  We accepted jurisdiction, and because the Secretary is required, \npursuant to section 1-5-203(1)(c)(I), C.R.S. (2019), to deliver the June 30 primary \nelection ballot order and content to county clerks by May 7, 2020, we directed \nFerrigno Warren to respond by April 30.  We are now asked to determine whether \nthe district court erred in finding that Ferrigno Warren substantially complied \nwith the signature requirement.1 \n \n \n \n1 We exercised jurisdiction to address the following issue: \nWhether a major party candidate may petition onto the primary \nballot for U.S. Senate under a substantial compliance standard if \nshe  failed  to  obtain  1,500  valid  signatures  in  six  of  seven \ncongressional districts, collected only 21 to 39% of the 1,500 valid \nsignatures needed in four of seven congressional districts, and \ncollected just over half of the total 10,500 valid signatures needed \nstatewide. \n9 \n \n\nII.  Analysis \n¶15  We  begin  by  setting  out  the  applicable  standard  of  review.    Next,  we \nconsider whether a substantial compliance standard can be applied to reduce the \nnumber of signatures a candidate must collect to petition onto the ballot below the \nminimum number mandated by the Election Code.  We conclude that it cannot.  \nThe Election Code mandates that the petition of a candidate for U.S. Senate “must \nbe  signed  by  at  least  one  thousand  five  hundred  eligible  electors  in  each \ncongressional  district.”    § 1-4-801(2)(c)(II).    That  minimum  requires  strict \ncompliance.  Because Ferrigno Warren’s petition did not include the requisite \nnumber of valid signatures from each district, the Secretary properly refused to \nadd her name to the Democratic primary ballot. \nA.  Standard of Review \n¶16  We review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.  Blooming Terrace \nNo. 1, LLC v. KH Blake St., LLC, 2019 CO 58, ¶ 11, 444 P.3d 749, 752.  In construing \na statute, our goal is to ascertain and give effect to the General Assembly’s intent.  \nMcCoy v. People, 2019 CO 44, ¶ 37, 442 P.3d 379, 389.  “To do so, we look first to the \nlanguage of the statute, giving its words and phrases their plain and ordinary \nmeanings.”  Id.  We read these words and phrases in context, and “we construe \nthem according to the rules of grammar and common usage.”  Id.  “If the statutory \n10 \n \n\nlanguage  is  clear  and  unambiguous,  we  apply  it  as  written—venturing  no \nfurther.”  Blooming Terrace No. 1, LLC, ¶ 11, 444 P.3d at 752. \nB.  The Election Code’s Minimum Signature Provision \nRequires Strict Compliance \n¶17  Three provisions of Colorado’s Election Code are relevant to our analysis.  \nFirst, in order to secure a place on the ballot as a candidate for U.S. Senator by \npetition, a candidate’s petition “must be signed by at least one thousand five \nhundred  eligible  electors  in  each  congressional  district.”    § 1-4-801(2)(c)(II).  \nSecond, “no petition is legal that does not contain the requisite number of names \nof eligible electors.”  § 1-4-902(1), C.R.S. (2019).  Third, “Substantial compliance \nwith the provisions or intent of this code shall be all that is required for the proper \nconduct of an election to which this code applies.”  § 1-1-103(3), C.R.S. (2019).  We \nmust resolve whether the substantial compliance provision—and our case law \nrelevant thereto—allows the petition signature requirement to be met with fewer \nthan the statutorily prescribed minimum number of signatures.    \n¶18  In our most recent analysis of the Election Code, we noted that there are \nsome  aspects  of  the  Code  that  simply  cannot  be  subject  only  to  substantial \ncompliance.  See Kuhn v. Williams, 2018 CO 30M, ¶ 54 n.4, 418 P.3d 478, 488 n.4.  In \nthat case, we considered whether a petition signature collector who was not a \nColorado resident, but intended to one day become a Colorado resident, could \nlegally collect signatures for a candidate petition.  Id. at ¶¶ 5–6, 418 P.3d at 480–81.  \n11 \n \n\nWe concluded that he could not because the Election Code at that time specified \nthat signature collectors had to be residents of Colorado.  Id. at ¶¶ 49–54, 418 P.3d \nat 487–88.  In reaching this conclusion, we noted that “residency is not a mere \ntechnical requirement that is subject to substantial compliance.  A person either is \na resident for purposes of the Election Code or he is not.”  Id. at ¶ 54 n.4, 418 P.3d \nat 488 n.4 (citation omitted).2 \n¶19  Like the residency requirement, the mandate that a U.S. Senate candidate’s \npetition include 1,500 signatures from each congressional district is more than \nsimply a “technical requirement.”  Rather, it is the minimum threshold that the \nlegislature has declared “must” be met for a candidate to petition onto the ballot.  \nThe  mandatory  nature  of  this  threshold  is  further  emphasized  by  the  clear \nstatement  in  section  1-4-902(1)  that,  although  a  petition  can  be  submitted  in \nmultiple sections to permit for signature collection by multiple people at one time, \n \n \n \n2 In other contexts, we have similarly concluded that even a statute subject to a \nsubstantial  compliance  standard  requires  strict  compliance  with  mandatory \nprovisions.  Compare Woodsmall v. Reg’l Transp. Dist., 800 P.2d 63, 68–69 (Colo. \n1990)  (holding  that  the  notice  requirement  in  the  Colorado  Governmental \nImmunity Act required only substantial compliance), with E. Lakewood Sanitation \nDist. v. Dist. Court, 842 P.2d 233, 236 (Colo. 1992) (holding that the 180-day time \nperiod for filing notice required strict compliance). \n12 \n \n\n“no petition is legal that does not contain the requisite number of names of eligible \nelectors.” \n¶20  Even  when  we  adopted  our  framework  for  evaluating  substantial \ncompliance in Loonan, we recognized a specific statutory command could not be \nignored in the name of substantial compliance.  Loonan, 882 P.2d at 1384–86.  That \ncase involved a challenge to signatures collected for a petition to put an initiative \nonto the ballot.  Id. at 1382.  The circulators who had collected the signatures had \nsigned circulator affidavits that “did not include the statement that the circulator \n‘has read and understands the laws governing the circulation of petitions’ as \nrequired by [statute].”  Id. (citation omitted).  The appellants argued that their \nsignatures should be deemed “substantially compliant” because their petition \nwas, in all other respects, compliant with the statutory requirements.  Id. at 1383.  \nThis court concluded that the statutory requirement that the omitted language be \nincluded was “clear, direct and specific” and that failure to include the language \nmeant that they did not “substantially comply” with the Election Code.  Id. at \n1384–86. \n¶21  There  certainly  are  circumstances  in  which  review  for  substantial \ncompliance can save signatures on a petition that were initially struck by the \nSecretary.  For example, in 2016, Ryan Frazier sought inclusion on the Republican \nprimary  ballot  as  a  U.S.  Senate  candidate.    See  Frazier v.  Williams, \n13 \n \n\nNo. 2016CV31574, p. 1 (Denver Dist. Ct. May 4, 2016) (Order Regarding Ryan \nFrazier).  The Secretary determined that Frazier had not obtained the statutory \nminimum number of signatures required to be included on the primary ballot.  Id. \nat p. 2.  Frazier challenged the Secretary’s determination as to a number of different \nindividual  signatures  and  signature  sections  collected  by  particular  signature \ncollectors.  Id. at p. 3.  With regard to four of the petition circulators, for example, \nthe Secretary had rejected their petition sections because the address provided on \nthe circulator affidavit did not match the address on file with the Secretary for \nvoter registration purposes.  Id. at pp. 3–4.  The district court concluded that the \nsections  were  substantially  compliant  because  the  circulators  in  fact  met  the \nstatutory requirements that they be Colorado residents registered as Republican, \neven  though  that  was  not  demonstrated  directly  by  the  information  on  the \npetition.  Id.  It is this kind of “technical requirement”—that circulators include on \ntheir affidavits the address at which they are registered to vote—that is more \nappropriately subject to a substantial compliance analysis.3 \n¶22  In reaching this conclusion, we note that other state courts whose election \nlaws are generally subject to the substantial compliance standard have similarly \n \n \n \n3  Ferrigno  Warren  did  not  make  this  kind  of  challenge  to  the  Secretary’s \ndetermination as to individual signatures in this action. \n14 \n \n\nconcluded  that  minimum signature  requirements  must be  reviewed  for strict \ncompliance.  As the Illinois Supreme Court explained when confronted with a \nsimilar  signature  shortfall,  permitting  substantial  compliance  in  this  context \nwould “require us to disregard the clear, unambiguous and mandatory language \nof the statute and graft onto it exceptions and limitations the legislature did not \nexpress.”  Jackson-Hicks v. E. St. Louis Bd. of Election Comm’rs, 28 N.E.3d 170, 179 (Ill. \n2015); see also D’Agostino v. Superior Court, 39 Cal. Rptr. 2d 112, 118 (Cal. Ct. App. \n1995) (“In the instant case the lack of 500 valid signatures is not a  ‘technical \ndeficiency’  but  rather  noncompliance  with  a  substantive  requirement  for \nqualification  for  the  ballot.”).    The  Illinois  Supreme  Court  summarized  the \ncircumstances that it confronted then in a manner that speaks aptly to what we \nconfront today in concluding that a candidate either meets the minimum signature \nthreshold or does not: \n[T]he case before us does not involve a situation where the candidate \nmet  the  basic  requirements  of  the Election Code,  but  did  so  in  a \ntechnically deficient manner.  Here, the candidate failed to meet a \nthreshold requirement completely.  While the signature requirement \nmay have been aimed at showing candidate initiative and minimum \nvoter  appeal,  showing  candidate  initiative  and  minimum  voter \nappeal is not, itself, the standard.  As we have explained, the clear and \nunambiguous standard adopted by the General Assembly requires \ncompliance with a specific numerical threshold determined according \nto a specific mathematical formula.  A candidate either meets that \nminimum threshold or does not.  There is no close enough.   \nJackson-Hicks, ¶ 37, 28 N.E.3d at 179–80. \n15 \n \n\n¶23  The same is true here: the General Assembly, in unambiguous terms, has \nmandated the collection of 1,500 signatures from each congressional district in \norder to petition onto the ballot as a candidate for U.S. Senate.  As the district court \nrecognized, this language is “clear and unequivocal.”  District Court Order, p. 21.  \nIt must be complied with strictly. \n¶24  While we recognize that the circumstances that made signature collection \nmore difficult this year are unprecedented, we do not have the authority to rewrite \nthe Election Code in response to the COVID-19 virus.  Only the General Assembly \ncan do that.  Indeed, the General Assembly passed an emergency election measure \nto address some of the challenges posed to the election season by the pandemic.  \nOn March 14, 2020, the General Assembly passed House Bill 20-1359, titled “An \nAct Concerning Modifications to Party Candidate Designation Requirements to \nAccommodate Public Health Concerns.”  See H.B. 20-1359, 73rd Gen. Assemb., 1st \nReg. Sess. (Colo. 2020).  The Governor signed that measure into law on March 16, \n2020.  With regard to the process for petitioning onto the ballot, the emergency \nmeasure provides that the Secretary may extend the time for filing petitions if she \ncannot accept the petitions as a result of “closures or restrictions due to public \nhealth concerns.”  Ch. 23, sec. 6, § 1-4-801, 2020 Colo. Sess. Laws 82, 85.  But, \nsignificantly,  that  law  did  not  alter  the  minimum  signature  requirements  or \nsuggest that they could be altered by the Secretary or a court.  In the absence of \n16 \n \n\nlegislative change, even when a worldwide pandemic has changed so much, the \nminimum signature requirements are fixed.   \n¶25  Ferrigno Warren submitted her petition to the Secretary, and the Secretary \nfound that it contained valid signatures from 1,500 eligible electors in only one of \nthe  seven  congressional  districts.    Ferrigno  Warren’s  petition  was  therefore \ninsufficient. \nIII.  Conclusion \n¶26  The  Election  Code’s  minimum  signature  mandate  requires  strict \ncompliance.  Ferrigno Warren did not collect the required 1,500 signatures from \neach congressional district.  We therefore reverse the order of the district court \ndirecting the Secretary of State to place Ferrigno Warren’s name on the Democratic \nprimary ballot.  \n17 \n ",

      "text": "District Court, City and County of Denver, Colorado \nCity and County Building, Room 256 \n1437 Bannock Street  DATE FILED: April 21, 2020 1:25 PM \nDenver, CO 80202  CASE NUMBER: 2020CV31077\n \n   \nPetitioner:  MICHELLE FERRIGNO WARREN   \n   \nv.   \n   \nRespondent:    JENA  GRISWOLD,  in  her  official  COURT USE ONLY \ncapacity as Colorado Secretary of State  Case Number:  20CV31077 \n   \n  Division               Courtroom 280 \nORDER REGARDING PETITION FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \nThis matter comes before the Court on a Petition for Declaratory Relief filed by Michelle \nFerrigno Warren (“Petitioner” or “Ms. Ferrigno Warren”) on March 17, 2020.  Ms. Ferrigno \nWarren seeks to be on the upcoming 2020 Democratic primary ballot as a candidate for United \nStates Senate.  To be on the ballot, Ms. Ferrigno Warren is required either to collect by petition \nat least 1,500 valid signatures from each of Colorado’s seven congressional districts (for a total \nof at least 10,500 valid signatures) or to proceed through the Democratic Party’s caucus and \nassembly process.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren chose to proceed by petition.  As such, the deadline for \nsubmitting her petition to the Colorado Secretary of State (“Respondent” or “Secretary”) was \nMarch 17, 2020.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren timely filed her petition that day but the petition \ncontained only 8,378 “reviewable signature lines.”  Knowing she presented a deficient number of \nsignatures, Ms. Ferrigno Warren filed for declaratory relief the same day.  The Secretary \nsubsequently reviewed the petition and issued a Statement of Insufficiency on April 15, 2020.  \nThe Statement reveals Ms. Ferrigno Warren collected 5,383 valid signatures.   \nIn her Petition for Declaratory Relief, Ms. Ferrigno Warren asserts that the COVID-19 \npandemic and the resulting state of emergency declared by Governor Jared Polis on March 10, \nPage 1 of 28 \n \n\n2020, prevented her from gathering the required number of signatures.  Accordingly, Ms. \nFerrigno Warren asks the Court for the following relief:  1) to suspend the petition process and \nextend the filing deadline for one week after Governor Polis lifts the state of emergency; or 2) to \nfind she has substantially complied with the petition requirements based on the number of \nsignatures she submitted and order the Secretary to place her name on the primary ballot.  Ms. \nFerrigno Warren argues she made a good faith effort to comply with the signature requirement \nand that technical or strict compliance is not required and runs counter to the statutory \nrequirement that the Election Code be liberally construed to permit ballot access.1  See § 1-1-\n103(1), C.R.S.  In response, the Secretary filed a Hearing Brief on March 30, 2020.  In her brief, \nthe Secretary asserts the following:  1) the Court does not have jurisdiction to resolve this dispute \nunder section 1-1-113, C.R.S., because in the face of an obvious deficiency in the number of \npetition signatures the Secretary’s determination of insufficiency is required by the Election \nCode and, thus, does not amount to a breach or neglect of her duties or other wrongful act under \nthe Code; and 2) if the Court does have jurisdiction to hear this matter, the Court should utilize a \nproposed mathematical formula that is capable of being applied neutrally and consistently to this \nand other candidate petitions that may have been affected by the pandemic to determine whether \nsubstantial compliance has been met.  With these arguments in mind, the Court held an \nevidentiary hearing on April 16, 2020.  The deadline for filing any additional challenges to the \nStatement of Insufficiency expired yesterday (April 20, 2020) without any new filings by Ms. \nFerrigno Warren.  The Court, having received and considered the various filings, the testimony \nof the witnesses, admitted exhibits, arguments presented by counsel, and applicable law, finds \nand orders as follows: \n                                                 \n1 The Court notes Ms. Ferrigno Warren also asserts an equal protection claim in her Petition for Declaratory Relief \nbut she has withdrawn the claim.  See Reply at page 12.   \nPage 2 of 28 \n \n\nBACKGROUND \nIn August 2019, Ms. Ferrigno Warren entered the race for United States Senate.  During \nher campaign, Ms. Ferrigno Warren has raised over $100,000.00, participated in many debates \nand forums, and compiled a distribution list of more than 30,000 individuals with several more \nthousand contacts on social media.  On January 5, 2020, Ms. Ferrigno Warren notified the \nSecretary of State of her decision to seek access to the primary election ballot as a Democratic \ncandidate for United States Senate via the petition process.  Under the Election Code, candidates \nseeking nomination by petition to the 2020 primary ballot had 57 days (from January 21, 2020 \nuntil March 17, 2020) to gather petition signatures.  See § 1-4-801(5)(a), C.R.S. (2020), and H.B. \n20-1359.  To be nominated to the ballot, Ms. Ferrigno Warren must obtain valid signatures of at \nleast 1,500 registered Democratic electors in each of the seven congressional districts in \nColorado (for a total of 10,500 valid signatures).  To this end, Ms. Ferrigno Warren utilized \nvolunteer and paid circulators to gather signatures.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren also retained the \nprofessional political firm Ground Organizing for Latinos in the hope that paid and experienced \ncirculators would be able to gather at least one-half of the required signatures between March 5, \n2020 and the deadline of March 17, 2020.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren maintains most of these \nexperienced circulators were unavailable until after “Super Tuesday” (i.e. March 3, 2020) \nbecause nearly all circulators in Colorado were working for large and wealthy campaigns such as \nthose for Michael Bloomberg and John Hickenlooper and were being paid far above standard \nindustry rates.  On March 5, 2020, these experienced circulators finally were able to work for \nMs. Ferrigno Warren’s campaign and began to collect signatures in earnest.  Such efforts, \nhowever, were short lived as the novel coronavirus had found its way to Colorado. \nPer their Joint Statement of Stipulated Facts (“Stipulation”) filed on April 10, 2020, Ms. \nFerrigno Warren and the Secretary agree to the following facts concerning the pandemic for \nPage 3 of 28 \n \n\npurposes of resolving this dispute:  1) on December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization \nreceived its first report of a pneumonia of unknown cause, which later came to be known as \nCoronavirus (COVID-19); 2) on March 5, 2020, Colorado officials announced the first two \npositive cases of COVID-19 in our state; 3) on March 10, 2020, Governor Polis declared a state \nof emergency due to COVID-19; 4) on March 13, 2020, Colorado reported its first death related \nto COVID-19; and 5) on March 25, 2020, Governor Polis issued a statewide “stay at home” \norder.  In light of these events, Ms. Ferrigno Warren asserts that starting the weekend of March \n7th and greatly accelerating after the Governor’s declaration on March 10th multiple circulators \n(both paid and volunteer) quit her campaign and a few volunteers who had collected signatures \nrefused to turn them in for fear of exposure.  In addition, Ms. Ferrigno Warren asserts some of \nher volunteers and staff began to exhibit symptoms or had family members with symptoms of \nCOVID-19.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren thus began to scale back her circulation efforts on March 13th \nand 14th due to these possible exposures and the health risks to her, her staff, the circulators, and \nthe community.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren maintains she also reduced her circulation efforts due, in \npart, to being informed on or about March 12th by the Secretary and the Colorado Democratic \nParty of pending legislation in the Colorado General Assembly that would include a remedy for \npetitioning candidates.2  Ms. Ferrigno Warren ultimately decided to suspend circulation on the \nafternoon of March 14th even though she had gathered less than the required number of \nsignatures. \nOn March 17, 2020, Ms. Ferrigno Warren submitted her petition to the Secretary for \nreview.  The Secretary’s initial review of the petition showed 7,734 reviewable signature lines.  \nAfter completing a closer review of the petition, the Secretary determined Ms. Ferrigno Warren \n                                                 \n2 The final product of this pending legislation is House Bill 20-1359.  Governor Polis signed the bill at 5:29 p.m. on \nMarch 16, 2020.  The bill is attached as Exhibit B to the Secretary’s Hearing Brief.   \nPage 4 of 28 \n \n\nactually submitted 8,378 reviewable signature lines.  Per section 1-4-908(1), C.R.S., the \nSecretary subsequently reviewed all petition information and compared it against the voter \nregistration records.  On April 15, 2020, after the Secretary completed the required petition \nreview, the Secretary notified Ms. Ferrigno Warren of the number of valid signatures and issued \na “Statement of Insufficiency.”  These results are described below.  In addition, on the same day, \nthe Secretary provided Ms. Ferrigno Warren with the master record of each accepted and \nrejected signature entry.  The master record contains the reason code for each rejected entry and \nthe date on which the signature was collected.   \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n1.  The Court adopts the stipulated and admitted facts set forth in the Joint Statement \nof Stipulated Facts filed by the parties on April 10, 2020, as established facts in this matter. \n2.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren is the policy/advocacy director for a non-profit organization.  \nAlthough Ms. Ferrigno Warren has never sought elective office before, she has considerable \nexperience working within the political system.   \n3.  Family, friends and colleagues encouraged Ms. Ferrigno Warren to run for United \nStates Senate in the upcoming 2020 election.  On August 6, 2019, Ms. Ferrigno Warren entered \nthe race for United States Senate.  During her campaign, Ms. Ferrigno Warren has worked seven \ndays a week for a total of 40-50 hours per week just on her campaign, has raised over \n$100,000.00, participated in many debates and forums, and compiled a distribution list of more \nthan 30,000 individuals with several thousand more contacts on social media. \n4.  On January 5, 2020, Ms. Ferrigno Warren notified the Secretary of State of her \ndecision to seek access to the primary election ballot as a Democratic candidate for United States \nSenate via the petition process.  Under the Election Code, candidates seeking nomination by \nPage 5 of 28 \n \n\npetition to the 2020 primary ballot had 57 days (from January 21, 2020 until March 17, 2020) to \ngather petition signatures.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren took a two-month leave of absence from her job \nduring this window to focus on her campaign and collecting signatures.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren \nmust obtain valid signatures of at least 1,500 registered Democratic electors in each of the seven \ncongressional districts in Colorado (for a total of 10,500 valid signatures).  Ms. Ferrigno Warren \nand approximately 100 volunteers thus began collecting signatures on the first day of the \ncollection window (i.e. on January 21, 2020). \n5.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren and her campaign team developed a sound strategy for \ncollecting the required number of signatures.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren planned to use a combination \nof both volunteers and paid circulators to collect signatures.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren decided to use \nthe paid circulators to help gather signatures in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 7th congressional districts \ngiven she had a large group of volunteers to gather signatures in the other three districts. \n6.  In mid-December 2019, Ms. Ferrigno Warren consulted with John Edward Soto \nabout hiring his firm to gather signatures.  Mr. Soto is the owner of Ground Organizing for \nLatinos, a field and petition company that specializes in collecting signatures for ballot initiatives \nand for candidates in national, state, and local elections.  Mr. Soto is experienced in such \ncollection efforts as he has been providing this service since at least 2004.    \n7.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren and Mr. Soto entered into a $40,000.00 contract for Mr. \nSoto’s firm to acquire 10,000 valid signatures.  Mr. Soto advised Ms. Ferrigno Warren that based \non his professional experience he expected the signature collection to follow a “hockey stick” \nmodel – collection would start at a slow pace in the first two months and then increase \nsignificantly during the final two weeks before the filing deadline.  This model is based, in part, \non the fact that signature collection in colder months like January and February can be tempered \nPage 6 of 28 \n \n\nby the weather and fewer potential electors being outdoors.  In addition, Mr. Soto was unable to \nhire a large number of circulators until after “Super Tuesday” (March 3, 2020) because most paid \ncirculators in the state were working for other campaigns (such as Michael Bloomberg, Bernie \nSanders, and John Hickenlooper) and being paid three to four times the average rate of pay. \n8.  During her testimony, Ms. Ferrigno Warren acknowledges she had between \nJanuary 21, 2020 and March 17, 2020, to gather signatures and that there were risks unrelated to \nthe COVID-19 pandemic in waiting until the last two weeks to gather most of her signatures, \nincluding the risk an elector would sign her petition after signing an earlier petition (which \nwould invalidate the signature on her petition) or a blizzard hitting Colorado and impeding \ntravel, keeping electors indoors, and inhibiting public gatherings. \n9.  Based on his past experience with other campaigns, Mr. Soto nonetheless \nexpected to gather at least one-half of the required signatures during the last two weeks before \nthe deadline.  To accomplish this goal, Mr. Soto planned to use 39-40 circulators on Ms. \nFerrigno Warren’s campaign beginning March 5, 2020.  \n10.  A circulator working for Mr. Soto is compensated for each signature he or she \nobtains.  On average, a circulator is able to gather 80 signatures per day.  Accordingly, on any \ngiven day with 39 paid circulators, Mr. Soto expected to gather approximately 3,120 signatures.  \nOver the course of the twelve days between March 5, 2020 and March 17, 2020, Mr. Soto could \nexpect to gather over 37,000 signatures.  Some of these signatures, of course, likely would be \ndeclared invalid by the Secretary during her review but given the volume of signatures expected \nto be collected Mr. Soto and Ms. Ferrigno Warren believed they would gather more than enough \nvalid signatures to meet the requirement. \n11.    Mr. Soto provides credible and unchallenged testimony that collection efforts on \nPage 7 of 28 \n \n\nthe Thursday through Saturday (March 5th through March 7th)  following “Super Tuesday” \n(March 3rd) proceeded as planned, i.e. circulators collected an average of 80 signatures per day.  \nCircumstances, however, began to change for the worse on Sunday (March 8th).  On Sunday, Mr. \nSoto spoke with one of his circulators about a possible exposure to COVID-19.  This and other \ncirculators employed by Mr. Soto had worked on the campaign of Reverend T. Hughes in his bid \nfor a House seat in the Colorado General Assembly.  Unfortunately, Reverend Hughes had been \ndiagnosed with the virus and was in the intensive care unit.   \n12.  Mr. Soto and some of the circulators gathering signatures for Ms. Ferrigno \nWarren had been in direct contact with Reverend Hughes and all were concerned they may have \nbeen exposed to the virus.  On Sunday (March 8th), Mr. Soto told his circulators about his \npossible exposure.  Many of the circulators began expressing safety concerns for themselves and \ntheir families, especially circulators who were at a higher risk of complications from exposure \n(i.e. older circulators and those with underlying health conditions) or who had family members at \na higher risk.  As a result, about one-half of the circulators working for Mr. Soto “said no more” \nand stopped working.  Mr. Soto ultimately lost 24 or 25 out of 39 circulators. \n13.  Per the credible testimony of Mr. Soto, on Sunday (March 8th) his best circulators \nwere only able to gather 20-25 signatures apiece because potential electors were not opening \ntheir doors, especially since the circulators were wearing face masks.  In addition, Mr. Soto \ncredibly describes how on the following Saturday (March 14th) one of his very best circulators \nwas working the City Market parking lot in Pueblo and gathered only 12 signatures in four \nhours.  This particular circulator routinely collected about 125 signatures per day. \n14.  Exhibit 1 reveals that on the following Friday (March 13th) at 10:57 a.m., Jeffrey \nMustin, the Petitions Lead for the Elections Division for the Secretary of State, emailed Ms. \nPage 8 of 28 \n \n\nFerrigno Warren regarding pending legislation, i.e. HB 20-1359, that if passed in its current form \nwould “push back the statutory deadline for major party candidate petitions 14 days.”  According \nto the credible testimony of Ms. Ferrigno Warren, the email and the possibility of an extension \nallowed her and her team to “pause and exhale” and to think about how to move forward.   \n15.  On Saturday (March 14th), however, Ms. Ferrigno Warren learned there would be \nno “remedy” in the legislation that would give her additional time beyond the current deadline to \ncollect signatures.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren thus decided to continue her circulation efforts but \ndescribed “bad dynamics” that weekend given the Governor’s declared state of emergency the \nprevious Wednesday (March 10th) and the public’s concern with getting food, toilet paper, etc. \n16.  On Saturday (March 14th) Ms. Ferrigno Warren decided to “pull the plug” and \nsuspend her circulation efforts out of concern for the health of her staff, her volunteers, the \ncirculators, and the community.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren also was concerned about her own health \nand the health of her son since both have asthma. \n17.  On March 17, 2020, Ms. Ferrigno Warren timely filed her petition with the \nSecretary.  The Secretary reviewed the petition in accordance with § 1-4-908(1), C.R.S. \n18.  The Secretary issued a Statement of Insufficiency on April 15, 2020.  The \nStatement shows Ms. Ferrigno Warren gathered a total of 5,383 valid signatures from across the \nstate.  This represents 51.2% of the total number of valid signatures required by § 1-4-\n801(2)(c)(II), C.R.S. \n19.  The Statement further shows there were 35 “signature mismatches” on the \npetition that Ms. Ferrigno Warren may cure by affidavits filed before 5:00 p.m. on April 20, \n2020.   \n20.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren submitted 2,995 invalid signatures.  Per § 1-4-909(1.5), \nPage 9 of 28 \n \n\nC.R.S., Ms. Ferrigno Warren “may petition the district court within five days for a review of the \n[insufficiency] determination pursuant to section 1-1-113.”  Such a review may reveal that some \nof the invalid signatures are, in fact, valid signatures.  However, even if all invalid signatures \nwere somehow declared to be valid (thus bringing the total number of valid signatures to 8,378), \nMs. Ferrigno Warren would still need to collect an additional 2,122 valid signatures to meet the \nthreshold set forth in § 1-4-801(2)(c)(II), C.R.S.      \n21.  The Statement provides a breakdown of valid signatures from each congressional \ndistrict: 1) 1,036 in the 1st congressional district; 2) 1,502 in the 2nd congressional district; 3) 315 \nin the 3rd congressional district; 4) 313 from the 4th congressional district; 5) 490 from the 5th \ncongressional district; 6) 1,139 from the 6th congressional district; and 7) 588 from the 7th \ncongressional district. \n22.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren collected the required number of valid signatures in one of \nseven congressional districts (i.e. the 2nd congressional district).  In the 1st congressional district \nMs. Ferrigno Warren collected 69% of the required number of valid signatures; in the 3rd \ncongressional district 21%; in the 4th congressional district 20.8%; in the 5th congressional \ndistrict 32.6%; in the 6th congressional district 75.9%; and in the 7th congressional district 39.2%. \n23.  The Statement further reveals that Ms. Ferrigno Warren submitted less than 1,500 \nsignatures (whether valid or invalid) in six of the seven congressional districts. \n24.  The Secretary’s deadline to deliver the June 30, 2020 primary election ballot \norder and content to the county clerks is May 7, 2020.  The county clerks’ deadline to transmit \nballots to military and oversees voters is May 16, 2020. \n \n \nPage 10 of 28 \n \n\nAPPLICABLE LAW \nPursuant to section 1-1-102 of the Colorado Revised Statutes, the “Uniform Election \nCode of 1992” applies to primary elections.  Section 1-1-103(1) of this Code states, “This code \nshall be liberally construed so that all eligible electors may be permitted to vote and those who \nare not eligible electors may be kept from voting in order to prevent fraud and corruption in \nelections.”  In addition, section 1-1-103(3) states, “Substantial compliance with the provisions or \nintent of this code shall be all that is required for the proper conduct of an election to which this \ncode applies.”  The Colorado Secretary of State is charged with the duty to “supervise the \nconduct of primary, general, congressional vacancy, and statewide ballot issue elections” and to \n“enforce the provisions of [the election] code.”  See § 1-1-107, C.R.S.  When a dispute regarding \nthe application and enforcement of the Election Code arises section 1-1-113 is implicated.  This \nstatute provides in part: \n(1)  When any controversy arises between any official charged with any \nduty or function under this code and any candidate, or any officers or \nrepresentatives  of  a  political  party,  or  any  persons  who  have  made \nnominations or when any eligible elector files a verified petition in a district \ncourt of competent jurisdiction alleging that a person charged with a duty \nunder this code has committed or is about to commit a breach or neglect of \nduty or other wrongful act, after notice to the official which includes an \nopportunity to be heard, upon a finding of good cause, the district court shall \nissue an order requiring substantial compliance with the provisions of this \ncode.  The order shall require the person charged to forthwith perform the \nduty or to desist from the wrongful act or to forthwith show cause why the \norder should not be obeyed.  The burden of proof is on the petitioner.  \n. . .  \n \n(4)  Except as otherwise provided in this part 1, the procedure specified in \nthis  section  shall  be  the  exclusive  method  for  the  adjudication  of \ncontroversies arising from a breach or neglect of duty or other wrongful act \nthat occurs prior to the day of an election. \n \n \nPage 11 of 28 \n \n\nPursuant to section 1-4-103, “All candidates for nominations to be made at any primary \nelection shall be placed on the primary election ballot either by certificate of designation by \nassembly or by petition.”  Section 1-4-502(1) provides in part, “[N]ominations for United States \nsenator . . . may be made by primary election under section 1-4-101 or by assembly or \nconvention under section 1-4-702 by major political parties, by petition for nomination as \nprovided in section 1-4-802, or by a minor political party as provided in section 1-4-1304.”  \nSection 1-4-603 states, “Candidates for major political party nominations for the offices \nspecified in section 1-4-502(1) that are to be made by primary election may be placed on the \nprimary election ballot by petition, as provided in part 8 of this article.”  Section 1-4-801 \nprovides in pertinent part that “Candidates for political party nominations to be made by primary \nelection may be placed on the primary election ballot by petition. . . . (2) The signature \nrequirement for the petition are as follows . . . (c)(II) Every petition in the case of a candidate for \nthe office of governor or the office of United States senator must be signed by at least one \nthousand five hundred eligible electors in each congressional district. . . .”  The Court notes the \nGeneral Assembly recently revised portions of this statute in response to the COVID-19 \npandemic.  House Bill 20-1359 was signed by Governor Polis on March 16, 2020, and provides \nin part: 3 \n  1-4-801.  Designation of party candidates by petition – repeal. \n(5)(a) Party petitions shall not be circulated nor any signatures be obtained \nprior to  the third Tuesday in  January.   EXCEPT AS  PROVIDED  IN \nSUBSECTION (5)(b)(I) OF THIS SECTION, petitions must be filed no \nlater than the third Tuesday in March. \n \n  (b)(I)  NOTWITHSTANDING  SUBSECTION  (5)(a)  OF  THIS \nSECTION,  IN  2020,  IF  THE  DESIGNATED  ELECTION  OFFICIAL \nWITH WHOM A PETITION IS TO BE FILED IS UNABLE TO ACCEPT \nTHE FILING BECAUSE OF CLOSURES OR RESTRICTIONS DUE TO \nPUBLIC  HEALTH  CONCERNS,  THE  DESIGNATED  ELECTION \n                                                 \n3 As noted at the bottom of the first page of the bill itself, capital letters indicate new material added to existing law. \nPage 12 of 28 \n \n\nOFFICIAL MAY EXTEND THE DEADLINE TO FILE THE PETITION \nOR DESIGNATE AN ALTERNATE LOCATION FOR FILING THE \nPETITION OR BOTH; EXCEPT THAT A SIGNATURE GATHERED \nAFTER THE THIRD TUESDAY IN MARCH IS INVALID AND SHALL \nNOT BE COUNTED. \n \n  (II)  THIS  SUBSECTION  (5)(b)  IS  REPEALED,  EFFECTIVE \nDECEMBER 31, 2020. \n \n  The Court notes the following provisions also are relevant to this dispute and remain \nunchanged by House Bill 20-1359.  First, section 1-4-902(1) states, “The signatures to a petition \n[for candidacy] need not all be appended to one paper, but no petition is legal that does not \ncontain the requisite number of names of eligible electors whose names do not appear on any \nother petition previously filed for the same office under this section.”  Second, section 1-4-907 \nprovides, “The petition, when executed and acknowledged as prescribed in this part 9, shall be \nfiled . . . [w]ith the secretary of state if it is for an office that is voted on by the electors of the \nentire state . . . .”  Third, section 1-4-908 describes the review and notification process the \nSecretary must execute once she receives the petition.  Finally, section 1-4-909 states: \n(1) A petition or certificate of designation or nomination that has been \nverified and appears to be sufficient under this code shall be deemed valid \nunless a petition for a review of the validity of the petition pursuant to \nsection 1-1-113 is filed with the district court within five days after the \nelection official’s statement of sufficiency is issued, or, in the case of a \ncertificate  of  designation,  within  five  days  after  the  certificate  of \ndesignation is filed with the designated election official. \n \n(1.5) If the election official determines that a petition is insufficient, the \ncandidate named in the petition may petition the district court within five \ndays for a review of the determination pursuant to section 1-1-113. \n \n(2) This section does not apply to any nomination made at a primary \nelection. \n        \nWith these statutes in mind, the Court highlights two particular cases it considered in \nresolving this dispute.  First, both parties cite to Loonan v. Woodley, 882 P.2d 1380 (Colo. 1994).  \nPage 13 of 28 \n \n\nIn Loonan, the appellees (which included Peggy Loonan) brought an action to challenge the \nsufficiency of initiative petitions circulated by the appellants (William Woodley and Patricia \nMiller, hereinafter collectively “Woodley”) that would require parental notification of an \nunemancipated minor’s decision to have an abortion.  The sole contention of Loonan was that \nWoodley collected an insufficient number of valid signatures to include the initiative on the \nNovember 1994 ballot because the affidavits submitted by Woodley’s circulators did not include \nthe statement that the circulator “has read and understands the laws governing the circulation of \npetitions” as required by statute.  Notwithstanding the failure to include this language on the \naffidavits, the Secretary of State found the signatures collected by circulators using deficient \naffidavits were still valid and issued a statement of sufficiency in Woodley’s favor.  The district \ncourt, however, vacated the Secretary’s determination.  On appeal to the Colorado Supreme \nCourt, Woodley asserted that compliance with election regulations must be judged using a \n“substantial compliance” standard rather than according to the strict compliance standard used by \nthe district court.  Id., at 1383.  The Supreme Court agreed with Woodley concerning the \nappropriate standard (i.e. substantial compliance not strict compliance is required), but \nnonetheless affirmed the ruling of the district court to the detriment of Woodley.   \nIn doing so, the Supreme Court stated, “[T]he right to vote and right of initiative have in \ncommon the guarantee of participation in the political process. . . . In light of the nature and \nseriousness of these rights, we have held that constitutional and statutory provisions governing \nthe initiative process should be liberally construed so that the constitutional right reserved to the \npeople may be facilitated and not hampered by either technical statutory provisions or technical \nconstruction thereof, further than is necessary to fairly guard against fraud and mistake in the \nexercise by the people of this constitutional right.”  Loonan, 882 P.2d at 1383-84 (internal \nPage 14 of 28 \n \n\nquotations omitted).  The Supreme Court further said, “In the voting rights context we have held \nthat the rule of ‘substantial compliance’ provides the appropriate level of statutory compliance to \n‘facilitate and secure, rather than subvert or impede, the right to vote.”  Loonan, 882 P.2d at \n1384, citing Meyer v. Lamm, 846 P.2d, 862, 875 (Colo. 1993).  The Supreme Court ultimately \nheld that “[g]iven the similar nature of the right to vote and the right of initiative and referendum, \nand the common statutory goal of inhibiting fraud and mistake in the process of exercising these \nrights . . . substantial compliance is the appropriate standard to apply in the context of the right to \ninitiative and referendum.”  Id.   \nThe Supreme Court in Loonan recognized several factors to determine whether a party \nhas substantially complied with statutory requirements:  1) the extent of non-compliance; 2) the \npurpose of the applicable provision and whether that purpose is substantially achieved despite \nthe non-compliance; and 3) whether there was a good faith effort to comply or whether non-\ncompliance is based on a conscious decision to mislead the electorate.  Id.; see also Fabec v. \nBeck, 922 P.2d 330 (Colo. 1996).  When applying these factors to the facts of its case, the \nSupreme Court found the second factor was dispositive “because the 1993 statutory amendment \n[requiring a statement on the affidavit from a circulator that he or she has read and understands \nthe laws governing the circulation of petitions] is so clear, direct and specific, and because the \nappellants made no attempt to comply with it.”  It is worth noting that Woodley used circulator \naffidavits based upon an accepted form used in previous petition campaigns (which apparently \nwere acceptable in all other respects besides not containing the new language required by the \n1993 amendment) and there were no other deficiencies cited by the Supreme Court that rendered \nthe petition or signatures invalid.  Rather, the Supreme Court focused on the omitted language as \nproof that the appellants “disregarded or were unaware of the 1993 amendments” and, thus, may \nPage 15 of 28 \n \n\nhave been unaware “of their important role in implementing all of the statutory safeguards and in \nassuring the validity of the signatures they collect.”  Loonan, 882 P.2d at 1385.  In short, the \n“substantial compliance” standard did not insulate Woodley from his failure to comply with “the \nvery particular requirements as to form, procedure, and disclosures that must be followed by the \nproponents of a petition.”  Id.  With this in mind, this Court observes from the result in Loonan \nthat while Ms. Ferrigno Warren suggests the “substantial compliance” standard is a more \nforgiving standard that favors the candidate in an election dispute, application of the standard by \nthe Colorado Supreme Court indicates the standard is still a rigorous one that can just as easily \nbe used as a sword to strike down a petition as opposed to a shield to protect it. \nThe Colorado Supreme Court’s more recent decision in Kuhn v. Williams, 418 P.3d 478 \n(Colo. 2018) further demonstrates this point.  In Kuhn, incumbent Representative Doug Lamborn \nsought access to the 2018 primary election ballot in the Fifth Congressional District as a \nRepublican candidate for United States House of Representatives.  Mr. Lamborn chose to \nproceed by petition.  To be on the ballot, Mr. Lamborn was required to collect 1,000 valid \nsignatures from registered Republicans in the district.  The campaign for Mr. Lamborn hired an \norganization to circulate petitions and collect signatures which were later submitted to the \nSecretary of State for review and verification.  The Secretary ultimately determined the \ncampaign submitted 1,269 valid signatures and issued a “Statement of Sufficiency.”  This \ndetermination was challenged in the district court by several registered voters of the Fifth \nCongressional District pursuant to sections 1-1-113(1) and 1-4-909(1), C.R.S. (2017).  The \nprotestors argued that several of the circulators were not Colorado residents as required by \nsection 1-4-905(1) of the Election Code and, therefore, the signatures collected by them should \nhave been declared invalid by the Secretary.  The district court held an evidentiary hearing and \nPage 16 of 28 \n \n\nthe argument focused on two particular circulators.  The district court concluded one circulator \nwas not a Colorado resident and invalidated the 58 signatures he collected.  No party appealed \nthat ruling.  The district court concluded the second circulator was a Colorado resident and \nvalidated the 269 signatures he collected.  As such, with these 269 valid signatures, the district \ncourt found Mr. Lamborn had collected enough signatures to satisfy the statutory threshold and \nupheld the Secretary’s finding of sufficiency.  The protestors appealed this ruling to the Colorado \nSupreme Court and the Court reversed.   \nIn a per curiam opinion with no dissent, the Supreme Court concluded that because the \nsecond circulator was not a Colorado resident and, thus, did not meet the statutory requirements \nto be a circulator, all signatures collected by this circulator should have been declared invalid by \nthe Secretary.  By declaring these 269 signatures invalid, Mr. Lamborn was left with only 942 \nvalid signatures – 58 signatures short of the threshold.  The Supreme Court held that because Mr. \nLamborn collected fewer than 1,000 valid signatures the Secretary could not certify him to the \nprimary ballot.  In reaching this result, the Court acknowledged the outcome in Loonan – \n“upholding order vacating the Secretary’s determination of sufficiency and enjoining the \nSecretary from certifying proposed initiative to the ballot due to circulator’s failure to comply \nwith statutory requirements” – and stated in a footnote that “residency is not a mere technical \nrequirement that is subject to substantial compliance.”  Kuhn, 418 P.3d at 489, n.4, citing \nLoonan, 882 P.2d at 1382.  At the end of its opinion, the Supreme Court pointedly stated, “We \nrecognize the gravity of this conclusion, but Colorado law does not permit us to conclude \notherwise,”  Kuhn, 418 P.3d at 489, suggesting again to this Court that the “substantial \ncompliance” standard set forth in Loonan may not be as forgiving as Ms. Ferrigno Warren \nasserts it to be, and signifying that the signature threshold itself is not a simple technical \nPage 17 of 28 \n \n\nrequirement, is inflexible by law, and a “substantial compliance” analysis cannot save a petition \nwith a deficient number of valid signatures.  With that said, this Court notes the United States \nDistrict Court in Goodall v. Williams, 324 F.Supp.3d 1184 (D. Colo. 2018) later issued a \npreliminary injunction ordering the Secretary of State (Wayne Williams at that time) to certify \nMr. Lamborn to the ballot because the residency requirement for circulators likely violated the \nFirst Amendment.  The United States District Court eventually entered a permanent injunction \nenjoining the Secretary from enforcing those provisions of section 1-4-905(1) that require \npetition circulators to be registered voters and residents of Colorado.  See Goodall v. Griswold, \n369 F.Supp.3d 1144 (D. Colo. 2019).     \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \nA.   Jurisdiction   \nThe Court first addresses the jurisdictional challenge raised by the Secretary in her \nHearing Brief.  As noted above, the Secretary asserts the Court does not have jurisdiction to \nresolve this dispute under section 1-1-113, C.R.S., because in the face of an obvious deficiency \nin the number of petition signatures collected by Ms. Ferrigno Warren the Secretary’s \ndetermination of insufficiency is required by the Election Code and, therefore, does not amount \nto a breach or neglect of her duties or other wrongful act under the Code.   In essence, the \nSecretary maintains that because she properly applied a technical compliance standard in \nreviewing the petition her “Determination of Insufficiency” is unreviewable under the Election \nCode.  The Court disagrees.  In doing so, the Court again looks to the decision of Kuhn v. \nWilliams, 418 P.3d 478 (Colo. 2018) for guidance.  In Kuhn, the Colorado Supreme Court \naddressed a somewhat similar “technical compliance” jurisdictional issue in deciding whether \nthe protestors could challenge the embattled circulator’s residency in a section 1-1-113 \nproceeding.  In framing the issue, the Supreme Court first stated, “Here, the protestors do not \nPage 18 of 28 \n \n\ndispute that the Secretary followed the appropriate verification procedures to do a facial \nverification of [the circulator’s] information.  Instead, they look to the courts for vindication.  So, \nwe must address whether judicial review of the Secretary’s decision is allowed under section 1-\n1-113.”  Id., at 485.  The Supreme Court further stated, “Here, the Secretary properly relied on \nthe circulator affidavit and information in the voter registration database to conclude that the \nLamborn Campaign’s petition appeared sufficient.  Thus, the question becomes whether the \nSecretary has another relevant duty he might be ‘about to’ breach or neglect, or some other \nrelevant wrongful act in which he might be ‘about to’ engage.”  Id.   \nIn resolving this question, the Supreme Court first recognized that “Section 1-4-908(3) \nstates that upon determining the petition is sufficient, the Secretary ‘shall certify the candidate to \nthe ballot.’  [This statute] thus imposes a separate duty on the Secretary to place a candidate’s \nname on the ballot.”  Id.  The Supreme Court then considered the language of section 1-4-909(1) \nthat allows for filing a protest of designations and nominations within five days after the \nSecretary’s statement of sufficiency is issued.  In light of these two statutes, the Supreme Court \nsaid, “[T]he Election Code expressly contemplates that, within a narrow, five-day window after \nthe election official issues a statement of sufficiency, a challenge to the ‘validity of the petition’ \nmay be brought through a proceeding under section 1-1-113, before the election official certifies \na candidate to the ballot.  Should the court determine that the petition is not in compliance with \nthe Election Code, the election official would certainly ‘commit a breach or neglect of duty or \nother wrongful action,’ § 1-1-113(1), to nonetheless certify that candidate to the ballot under \nsection 1-4-908(3).”  Id.   \nFrom this Court’s perspective, the opposite side of this jurisdictional coin is implicated in \nthe present case.  Section 1-4-909(1.5) provides, “If the election official determines that a \nPage 19 of 28 \n \n\npetition is insufficient, the candidate named in the petition may petition the district court within \nfive days for a review of the determination pursuant to section 1-1-113.”  Ms. Ferrigno Warren \nalleges her petition is not insufficient and substantially complies with the Election Code despite \ncontaining a deficient number of signatures.  While the merits of this argument are subject to \nfurther analysis by the Court, were the Court to agree with Ms. Ferrigno Warren that her petition \nis sufficient, the Secretary would commit a breach or neglect of her duty by not certifying the \ncandidate to the ballot.  As such, the Court finds Ms. Ferrigno Warren is not precluded by the \nElection Code from bringing the issue before the Court.  This conclusion is consistent with the \nbroad language of section 1-1-113 that provides, in part, “When any controversy arises between \nany official charged with any duty or function under this code and any candidate . . . alleging \nthat a person charged with a duty under this code has committed or is about to commit a breach \nor neglect of duty or other wrongful act . . . upon a finding of good cause, the district court shall \nissue an order requiring substantial compliance with the provisions of this code.”  (Emphasis \nadded).  As emphasized above, Ms. Ferrigno Warren has alleged the Secretary is in violation of \nthe Election Code.  Therefore, based on this allegation, the Court has jurisdiction to hear and \nresolve the dispute.   \nFinally, although Ms. Ferrigno Warren filed her Petition for Declaratory Relief before the \nSecretary issued her Statement of Insufficiency, the Court sees no reason to require Ms. Ferrigno \nWarren to file a second lawsuit raising the same or similar issues in order to somehow trigger a \nreview under section 1-1-909(1.5) and section 1-1-113.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s filing on March \n17, 2020 properly anticipated the Secretary’s insufficiency determination and in no uncertain \nterms informed the Court and the Secretary that a review of that forthcoming determination was \nbeing requested.  Accordingly, the Court finds the Petition for Declaratory relief is a timely filing \nPage 20 of 28 \n \n\nthat requires district court review of the insufficiency determination in accordance with section \n1-1-909(1.5) and section 1-1-113.   \nB.  One-Week Extension \nThe Court next considers Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s request to suspend the petition process \nand extend the filing deadline for one week after Governor Polis lifts the state of emergency.  \nThe Court rejects this request.  In doing so, the Court first notes Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s \nstatement in her Reply that “she is still willing to accept an Order granting an additional seven \ndays in order to complete petition signature gathering, however, she recognizes that there is little \nlikelihood of the [Governor’s State of Emergency and Stay at Home] Order(s) being lifted prior \nto the statutory ballot deadline.”  (Reply, page 12).  The Court agrees with this assessment.  \nMore importantly, however, the Court notes that House Bill 20-1359 specifically precludes this \ntype of relief.  Per the bill, section 1-4-801(5)(b)(I), C.R.S. (2020), now provides in pertinent part \nthat “a signature gathered after the third Tuesday in March is invalid and shall not be counted.”  \nThe Colorado General Assembly could not have been more clear in this regard. \nC.  Substantial Compliance \nThe crux of this dispute is whether the Court should order the Secretary to place Ms. \nFerrigno Warren on the 2020 Democratic primary ballot as a candidate for United States Senate \neven though she failed to collect the required number of valid signatures to petition onto the \nballot.  The Court has struggled with this question.  As an initial matter, section 1-4-902(1), \nC.R.S., says “no petition is legal that does not contain the requisite number of names of eligible \nelectors whose names do not appear on any other petition previously filed for the same office \nunder this section.”  This language is clear and unequivocal and perhaps should end the Court’s \ninquiry right here.  The Secretary herself, however, does not make this argument but instead \nPage 21 of 28 \n \n\nasserts that “a reviewing court with jurisdiction under Section 113 is authorized to apply a less \nrigorous ‘substantial compliance’ standard under which it may liberally construe the Election \nCode in favor of ballot access.”  (Hearing Brief, page 7).  In short, the Secretary appears to \naccept that the signature threshold in section 1-4-801(2)(c)(II) is not an inflexible requirement, \nthat section 1-4-902(1) is not fatal to Ms. Ferrigno Warren’s petition, and that further inquiry by \nthe Court is warranted.   \nThe Court, therefore, continues its analysis by considering Colorado Supreme Court \nprecedent in this area.  In going down this road, the Court is not sure whether the Supreme \nCourt’s decision in Kuhn v. Williams, 418 P.3d 478 (Colo. 2018), is a speedbump or a brick wall \nto further inquiry.  The decision could be read by this Court to find that the signature threshold is \ninflexible by law and cannot withstand a “substantial compliance” analysis.  In other words, no \nfurther inquiry is needed.  Again, however, the Secretary does not make this argument but \ninstead asks the Court to utilize a proposed mathematical formula that would require candidates \nlike Ms. Ferrigno Warren “to still demonstrate significant public support before accessing the \nprimary ballot, while still relaxing the statutorily required level of support due to COVID-19.”  \n(Hearing Brief, page 13).  The Court observes that the Secretary cites Kuhn in her Hearing Brief \nfor the proposition that a district court in a section 1-1-113 proceeding lacks jurisdiction to \nconsider the constitutionality of state laws but does not rely on the opinion to argue Ms. Ferrigno \nWarren should be excluded from the primary ballot because she provided a deficient number of \nsignatures.   \nIn light of the position taken by the Secretary, the Court continues its analysis but with \nsome reservation.  The plain language of section 1-4-902(1), C.R.S., and the Supreme Court \nprecedent considered above, give the Court pause whether further inquiry is permissible.  The \nPage 22 of 28 \n \n\nCourt, however, is mindful that it is reading and interpreting the Election Code and Colorado \nSupreme Court precedent in a nearly empty courthouse while a global pandemic is unfolding \noutside its windows.  By almost any measure, ordinary life for the citizens of this state has been \naltered by the arrival of COVID-19 to our community.  How and when life returns to normal are \nstill open questions as the Court writes this order.  This case shows the political process is not \nimmune from the virus.  Candidates, voters, and government officials have encountered a \nprimary election season unlike any other in our history.   It is within these circumstances, and in \nlight of the arguments presented by Ms. Ferrigno Warren and the Secretary, that the Court \nconcludes strict adherence to the signature requirement for primary petitions must yield to this \nunprecedented public health emergency.  To interpret and apply the Election Code with a \nbusiness-as-usual mindset seems injudicious at a time when our community and its citizens have \nbeen asked to adapt in profound ways to this new and (hopefully) temporary reality.   \nFortunately, the Election Code by its own terms contemplates some level of flexibility in \nits application.  First, section 1-1-103(1) of the Code states, “This code shall be liberally \nconstrued so that all eligible electors may be permitted to vote and those who are not eligible \nelectors may be kept from voting in order to prevent fraud and corruption in elections.”  In \naddition, section 1-1-103(3) states, “Substantial compliance with the provisions or intent of this \ncode shall be all that is required for the proper conduct of an election to which this code applies.”  \nWith that said, the Court recognizes that even though the Election Code may not require its \nprovisions to be applied in a rigid manner during an election dispute, the flexibility the Code \naffords is not unrestrained as evidenced by the Colorado Supreme Court decisions of Loonan v. \nWoodley, 882 P.2d 1380 (Colo. 1994) and Fabec v. Beck, 922 P.2d 330 (Colo. 1996).  The \nSupreme Court in Loonan requires a district court to consider the following factors to determine \nPage 23 of 28 \n \n\nwhether a party has substantially complied with the Code’s statutory requirements:  1) the extent \nof non-compliance; 2) the purpose of the applicable provision and whether that purpose is \nsubstantially achieved despite the non-compliance; and 3) whether there was a good faith effort \nto comply or whether non-compliance is based on a conscious decision to mislead the electorate.  \nLoonan, 882 P.2d at 1384; Fabec, 922 P.2d at 341.  The Court addresses each of these factors in \nturn. \nFirst, concerning the extent of non-compliance in this matter, Ms. Ferrigno Warren \ncollected a total of 5,383 valid signatures from across the state.  This represents 51.2% of the \ntotal number of valid signatures required by section 1-4-801(2)(c)(II).  Ms. Ferrigno Warren \ncollected the required number of valid signatures in one of seven congressional districts (i.e. the \n2nd congressional district).  In the 1st congressional district Ms. Ferrigno Warren collected 69% \nof the required number of valid signatures; in the 3rd congressional district 21%; in the 4th \ncongressional district 20.8%; in the 5th congressional district 32.6%; in the 6th congressional \ndistrict 75.9%; and in the 7th congressional district 39.2%.  The Court is mindful that Ms. \nFerrigno Warren had a well planned strategy to use paid circulators during the final twelve days \nof the collection window to gather signatures in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 7th districts.  She planned to \nuse a large group of volunteers to gather signatures in the other three districts.  To this end, Ms. \nFerrigno Warren and Mr. Soto entered into a $40,000.00 contract for Mr. Soto’s firm to acquire \n10,000 valid signatures.  Unsurprisingly, the numbers lag in the four districts that stood to benefit \nthe most from the circulation efforts cut short by the pandemic. \n  Second, concerning whether the purpose of the signature requirement was substantially \nachieved despite the non-compliance, the Court is mindful that Ms. Ferrigno Warren had to \ncollect petition signatures in the shadow of a global pandemic and looming public health \nPage 24 of 28 \n \n\nemergency.  While a persuasive argument could be made that in more tranquil times collecting \njust over half the required number of valid signatures is not enough to show a candidate vying to \nappear on a primary ballot has a “significant modicum of support,” Utah Republican Party v. \nCox, 892 P.3d 1066, 1089 (10th Cir. 201), the Court would be remiss to ignore the on-the-ground \nand in-the-street realities of signature collection during this pandemic.  Per the credible \ntestimony of Ms. Ferrigno Warren, signature collection is a “very personal activity” and potential \nelectors were “more cautious” about interacting with circulators beginning about one week \nbefore Governor Polis declared a state of emergency.  In the best of times, engaging strangers in \npublic, holding their attention, and acquiring their signatures on a petition is challenging.  In a \nclimate of social distancing to mitigate the spread of a communicable disease, it is even more so.  \nDuring a declared state of emergency, it becomes almost futile.   \nNonetheless, despite the changing social dynamics associated with the pandemic and \nforegoing three days of circulation (which included a Sunday), Ms. Ferrigno Warren still \nmanaged to gather more than 50% of the required total number of valid signatures.  This \nachievement suggests Ms. Ferrigno Warren has a “significant modicum” of support for her \ncandidacy.  In the Court’s judgment, a 50% threshold is a reasonable line to draw in this \nparticular case as it strikes a balance between still requiring Ms. Ferrigno Warren to demonstrate \nsignificant public support and acknowledging that through no fault of her own Ms. Ferrigno \nWarren was forced to operate within an environment much more onerous to contacting (let alone \npersuading) potential electors to express that support.  The Court recognizes this 50% standard \nhas its shortcomings when applied to a campaign that has collected a lot more than 1,500 valid \nsignatures in only one or a handful of congressional districts while collecting a minimal amount \nof signatures in the remaining districts.  In such a situation, a candidate could claim to have \nPage 25 of 28 \n \n\nsubstantially complied with the petition requirements by gathering at least 5,250 valid signatures \nwhile garnering little or no support in some districts.  In short, a candidate could inflate the \nnumbers by loading up on signatures in his or her home district while ignoring the other districts.  \nSuch is not the case in the present matter.  Ms. Ferrigno Warren met the district minimum in only \nthe Second Congressional District, and she exceeded that minimum by just two votes.  She \ncollected slightly more than 1,000 signatures in each of two other districts.  In the remaining \ndistricts – the districts she planned to use paid circulators in the final twelve days of the \ncollection window – she collected a comparable number of valid signatures in each district (i.e. \n315, 313, 490, and 588).  These results demonstrate that as a candidate for statewide elective \noffice, Ms. Ferrigno Warren made an honest effort to collect signatures in every congressional \ndistrict, obtained legitimate support for her candidacy in each district, and when combined \ndemonstrates a “significant modicum” of support across our electorate.           \nThe Court declines to utilize the mathematical formula proposed by the Secretary.  The \nCourt notes the proposed formula is well thought out and easily applied in this case and others.  \nThe Court also understands why the Secretary would want all district courts in our state to utilize \nthe same formula.  However, the formula does not account for the reality that signature \ncollection often starts slow and builds in intensity as the deadline nears.  This is the “hockey \nstick” model that Mr. Soto describes using in previous elections with success.  The “per-day \naverage” analysis proposed by the Secretary is the converse of this model and in the Court’s \njudgment unfairly penalizes Ms. Ferrigno Warren for having to wait to hire most of her paid \ncirculators until after “Super Tuesday” and for settling on a signature collection strategy that \ncould not anticipate the havoc COVID-19 would wreak in our community.  To the extent Ms. \nFerrigno Warren should have anticipated and planned for a potential disruption to her collection \nPage 26 of 28 \n \n\nefforts during the final two weeks of the collection window (e.g. the March blizzard), the Court \nnotes such a “typical” disruption usually impacts our community for no more than a day or two \nand then life returns to normal.  By contrast, the arrival of COVID-19 to our state has disrupted \nour community much more deeply and for much longer than anyone could have predicted.  \nBottom line, the Court is not convinced the proposed “one size fits all” mathematical formula is \nthe proper method to judge whether this candidate under these circumstances has substantially \ncomplied with the provisions of the Election Code.                       \nFinally, concerning whether there was a good faith effort to comply or whether non-\ncompliance was based on a conscious decision to mislead the electorate, the Court is convinced \nMs. Ferrigno Warren made a good faith effort to comply with the signature requirements.  Ms. \nFerrigno Warren and her campaign team developed a sound strategy for collecting the required \nnumber of signatures.  In mid-December 2019, Ms. Ferrigno Warren consulted with Mr. Soto \nabout hiring his firm to gather signatures and they entered into a $40,000.00 contract for Mr. \nSoto’s firm to do so.  Although most paid circulators in the state were working for other \ncampaigns and unavailable to Ms. Ferrigno Warren until after “Super Tuesday,” she did not wait \nuntil the final two weeks to begin her collection efforts.  Rather, Ms. Ferrigno Warren and \napproximately 100 volunteers began collecting signatures on the first day of the collection \nwindow (i.e. on January 21, 2020).  This shows Ms. Ferrigno Warren was eager to get into the \ncommunity and start collecting signatures, and the Court has heard nothing in this proceeding to \nsuggest this enthusiasm or effort waned during the collection window.  To the contrary, Ms. \nFerrigno Warren provided credible testimony she took a two-month leave of absence from her \njob during this time and worked 40-50 hours per week just on her campaign, all with the obvious \npurpose of meeting the signature requirement and getting on the ballot. \nPage 27 of 28 \n \n\nCONCLUSION \nAfter considering the three factors set forth in Loonan v. Woodley, 882 P.2d 1380 (Colo. \n1994) and Fabec v. Beck, 922 P.2d 330 (Colo. 1996), the Court finds all three factors weigh in \nfavor of granting the relief requested by Ms. Ferrigno Warren.  The Court thus concludes that \nMs. Ferrigno Warren has substantially complied with the Election Code’s signature threshold, \ndistribution, and validity requirements.  Accordingly, the Court orders the Secretary of State to \nplace Ms. Ferrigno Warren on the 2020 Democratic primary ballot as a candidate for United \nStates Senate. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED on this Tuesday, April 21, 2020.       \n \nBY THE COURT: \n   \n              _________________________ \n              Christopher J.
