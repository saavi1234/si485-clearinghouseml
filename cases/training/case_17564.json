The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and private counsel, alleged that regulations issued by ED \"sharply limit educational institutions' obligations to respond to reports of sexual harassment and assault\" and therefore contravened Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief and alleged that ED's rulemaking process violated the Administrative Procedure Act. Judge Richard D. Bennett was assigned the case.</p>\r\n<p>The complaint argued that ED's regulations ran counter to both the spirit and intent of Title IV by narrowing the definition of sexual harassment, directing university officials to ignore Title IV reports of off-campus conduct, and holding schools accountable only when they were \"deliberately indifferent\" to sexual assault and harassment. These policies, the plaintiffs contended, created a higher standard for race- or national origin-based discrimination and a lower one for sex-based discrimination. As a result, the plaintiffs alleged that ED's rulemaking process violated the Administrative Procedure Act because it was \"arbitrary and capricious\" for failing to adequately consider important aspects of sexual harassment and assault problems.</p>\r\n<p>On July 31, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that the Plaintiffs lacked Article III standing.</p>\r\n<p>Later that year, on October 20, the court granted the motion to dismiss. To establish standing, a plaintiff must show (1) an &ldquo;injury in fact,&rdquo; (2) a sufficient &ldquo;causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of,&rdquo; and (3) a &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; that the injury &ldquo;will be redressed by a favorable decision.&rdquo; In this case, the court held that none of the plaintiffs established an injury in fact because their alleged injuries were too speculative or would be based on their own choices in response to what the defendants did instead of being directly caused by the defendants. The case was dismissed without prejudice. 2020 WL 6150935.</p>\r\n<p>This case is now closed.</p>",

DEVOS, in her official capacity as  DECLARATORY AND \nUnited States Secretary of Education; KENNETH L.  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  \nMARCUS, in his official capacity as Assistant Secretary \nfor Civil Rights at the United States Department of \nEducation; and UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF \nEDUCATION, \n  \nDefendants. \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  Nearly half a century since the passage of Title IX of the Education Amendments \nof 1972 (“Title IX”), sexual harassment and assault remain a widespread problem for students of \nall ages. In 1972, Congress delegated to Defendant U.S. Department of Education (“ED” or “the \nAgency”) the power and responsibility to hold educational institutions receiving federal funds \naccountable for their responses to sex discrimination. Since 1997, the Agency has set standards \ngoverning the responsibilities of funding recipients to address sexual harassment, including \nsexual assault, and to take steps to prevent it. Under statutes imposing virtually identical \nobligations, schools that receive federal funding have also been required to respond to and \nprevent harassment and assault on the basis of race, national origin, and disability.1 Until now, \n                                                           \n1 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VI”); Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \n(“Section 504”); Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“Title II”). Compare Title VI, 42 \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 2 of 46\nED has imposed the same responsibilities on recipients to respond to harassment based on sex \nthat it imposes on them to respond to harassment based on race, national origin, and disability. \nWith the promulgation of the Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or \nActivities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance regulation (RIN 1870-AA14, Docket No. ED-\n2018-OCR-0064) (the “Rule”), however, the Agency has radically reduced the responsibility of \nschools to respond to complaints of sexual harassment and assault, creating an arbitrary and \nwholly unexplained disparity between its treatment of sex discrimination on the one hand, and \nrace, national origin, and disability discrimination on the other.  \n2.  Defendant ED Secretary Elisabeth DeVos has discarded decades of ED’s \nexperience addressing sexual harassment and assault by promulgating regulatory provisions that \nsharply limit educational institutions’ obligations to respond to reports of sexual harassment and \nassault. If allowed to be implemented at educational institutions nationwide, these provisions will \nmake the promise of equal educational opportunities irrespective of sex even more elusive. This \nis true for all students, including students of color, LGBTQ students, and students with and \nwithout disabilities, in grade school, high school, and higher education. \n3.  Public statements by ED Secretary DeVos and former Deputy Assistant Secretary \nCandice Jackson echo the historical justifications and stereotypes that once animated the second-\n                                                           \nU.S.C. § 2000d (“No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”); with Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 (“No person \nin the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, \nor be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity.”); and Section 504, 29 U.S.C. \n§ 794(a) (“No otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his \ndisability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”); and Title II, 42 \nU.S.C. § 12132 (“[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be \nexcluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public \nentity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”). \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 3 of 46\nclass legal treatment of women’s and girls’ accounts of sexual harassment or assault and enabled \nthese accounts to be dismissed, belittled, and ignored. \n4.  For example, Jackson, who also led the Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) as the \nActing Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, said that in most investigations, there is “not even an \naccusation that these accused students overrode the will of a young woman. Rather, the \naccusations—90 percent of them—fall into the category of ‘we were both drunk,’ ‘we broke up, \nand six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that \nour last sleeping together was not quite right.’”2  \n5.  Secretary DeVos similarly suggested that Title IX reports of sexual harassment \nare often frivolous: “Too many cases involve students and faculty who have faced investigation \nand punishment simply for speaking their minds or teaching their classes. Any perceived offense \ncan become a full-blown Title IX investigation. But if everything is harassment, then nothing \nis.”3 \n6.  Despite Secretary DeVos and former Deputy Assistant Secretary Jackson’s \npurported anecdotal evidence, neither ED nor public comments submitted in response to the \nAgency’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“Proposed Rule”) cite evidence to support the notion \nthat false accusations are common or that Title IX investigations are routinely used to police \nspeech. In fact, the government data, research studies, and personal accounts presented to ED in \nresponse to the Proposed Rule show that the real problem is not false reports, which the Agency \n                                                           \n2 Erica L.

This new federal effort to weaken Title IX makes it more difficult for victims of \nsexual harassment or sexual assault to continue their educations and needlessly comes amid a \nglobal pandemic—wherein tens of millions of students across the United States are already \nstruggling to learn despite the closure of schools, a shift to online learning, and numerous other \ndisruptions caused by COVID-19. Instead of focusing on how to help these students, the Agency \nhas prioritized gutting protections against sexual harassment and assault that many of them \ncurrently rely on. \n8.  Nearly 12% of university students have reported nonconsensual sexual touching \nor penetration by force or incapacitation since enrolling at their school.5 Elementary, middle, and \nhigh school students also experience sexual harassment and assault at alarming rates, with 21% \nof middle schoolers in one study reporting they had been pinched, touched, or grabbed in a \nsexual way.6 Students of color; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (“LGBTQ”) \n                                                           \n4 Ann Cahill, Comment on Proposed Rule (ED-2018-OCR-0064-10709) (citing Christine H.

The impact of sexual harassment and violence can be severe and long-term, with \nconsequences including declines in grades, missed classes, increased risk of dropping out, \nwithdrawal from academic and social life, depression, anxiety, and suicidality.  \n10.  Recognizing this impact, ED previously worked with institutions to prevent and \nredress sexual harassment and assault by issuing guidance and enforcement letters over the past \ntwo decades. It did so, moreover, in a manner that treated as parallel the obligations on schools to \nrespond to harassment based on sex, race, national origin, and disability equally, imposing \nsimilar standards for each. \n11.  The newly issued Rule, however, includes several provisions that are contrary to \nboth the language and spirit of Title IX, and depart significantly not only from consistent past \npractice, but create a double standard, in which educational institutions have dramatically \ndifferent obligations to respond to harassment based on sex, on the one hand, and race, national \norigin, and disability on the other. Despite issuing a 2,000 page “preamble,” ED never \nadequately explains why it is treating sexual and racial/national origin/disability harassment \ndifferently, despite similar statutory prohibitions. This double standard will have a devastating \neffect on survivors of sexual harassment and assault and their educations. These provisions will \nalso result in fewer institutions taking much-needed affirmative steps to prevent sexual \nharassment and assault before it happens. These unlawful provisions include:  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 6 of 46\na.  Redefining sexual harassment to exclude many instances of misconduct \nthat currently fall within the Agency’s definition, and that continue to fall \nunder the Agency’s definition of harassment based on race, national \norigin, and disability (see ¶¶ 64-75; 83-86);  \nb.  Directing schools to ignore many Title IX reports of sexual assault that \noccur off campus/school grounds, including in off-campus housing or \nduring study abroad, regardless of the effect they have on-campus and on \nsurvivors’ educations (see ¶¶ 76-82); \nc.  Relieving colleges and universities of the obligation to address sexual \nharassment unless reports of sexual harassment are made to a limited \nnumber of school officials, while requiring those same officials to respond \nto all harassment on the basis of race, national origin, or disability of \nwhich they knew or should have known (see ¶¶ 87-97);  \nd.  Permitting, and in some cases requiring, schools to apply a higher standard \nof proof in sexual harassment hearings than has been required in hearings \ninvolving other forms of harassment committed by students (see ¶¶ 106-\n111); and  \ne.  Holding schools accountable for their failed responses to sexual \nharassment only when they are “deliberately indifferent,” while requiring \nschools to “take prompt and effective steps reasonably calculated to end \nharassment, eliminate the hostile environment, prevent its recurrence, and \nremedy its effects” in cases of harassment based on race, national origin, \nor disability (see ¶¶ 98-105). \n12.  None of the reductions in schools’ responsibility to respond to sexual harassment \napplies to the schools’ parallel responsibilities to respond to harassment and assault based on \nrace, national origin, or disability. ED anticipates the Rule will result in a significant reduction in \nthe number of sexual harassment and assault-related investigations by schools.7  \n13.  Throughout the Rule, the Agency excuses the dramatic limits it places on Title \nIX’s applicability by noting that schools may in their discretion address sexual misconduct under \n                                                           \n7 U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities \nReceiving Federal Financial Assistance 1985 (Doc. No. 2020-10512) (May 12, 2020), \nfederalregister.gov/d/2020-10512 (scheduled to be published May 19, 2020) [hereinafter Rule]; see \nNondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial \nAssistance, 83 Fed. Reg. 61,462, 61,487 (Proposed Nov. 29, 2018) [hereinafter Proposed Rule].  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 7 of 46\ntheir own codes of conduct. But that is equally true of racial, national origin-based, and \ndisability-based incidents. The Agency never adequately explains why schools have lower civil \nrights obligations to address sexual harassment than racial, national origin-based, and disability-\nbased harassment. \n14.  Through these provisions, ED has now imposed uniquely reduced responsibilities \nto investigating reports of sexual harassment, without making any meaningful effort to explain \nthe double standard beyond asserting that it believes such a distinction is lawful. This \ninadequately explained double standard recalls a time when reports of sexual assault and rape \nwere legally discarded unless they met demanding standards that were not applied to other \ncomplaints. \n15.   Plaintiffs Know Your IX, a project of Advocates for Youth, Council of Parent \nAttorneys and Advocates, Inc., Girls for Gender Equity, and Stop Sexual Assault in Schools are \norganizations that directly or through their members are dedicated to helping students who \nexperience sexual harassment and assault continue their educations. Many of them provide \ntechnical assistance to institutions about how to address sexual harassment and assault, engage in \npolitical advocacy on behalf of survivors, and raise public awareness about the impact of sexual \nviolence on students. The organizations or their members advocate on behalf of K–12, college, \nand/or graduate and professional students, including students of color, students with disabilities, \nand LGBTQ and nonbinary students, affected by sexual harassment and violence in education. \nPlaintiffs raised numerous concerns about the Rule (in its proposed form) to the Department in \ntheir comments on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, but ED failed to adequately address \nthose concerns. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 8 of 46\n16.  The provisions of the Rule that Plaintiffs challenge are contrary to Title IX, \nunreasonable departures from longstanding ED policy and practice, and create an arbitrary, \ncapricious, and insufficiently explained double standard, enabling institutions to ignore sexual \nharassment and assault that they could not ignore if the same alleged harassment were based on \nrace, national origin, or disability. They also fail to address alarming evidence presented during \nthe comment period about the impact these provisions would have on survivors of sexual \nharassment and assault and their educations. \n17.  The above provisions dramatically reduce schools’ responsibility to respond to \nsexual harassment and assault and should be declared invalid. By promulgating them, the \nAgency has thwarted its mandate to ensure that every student has equal educational opportunity \nregardless of sex. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n18.  This Court has jurisdiction over the claims alleged in this Complaint pursuant to 5 \nU.S.C. §§ 701–706 (Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”)), 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal \nquestion), 28 U.S.C. § 2201 (declaratory relief), and 28 U.S.C. § 2202 (injunctive relief). \n19.  ED’s issuance of the Rule on May 6, 2020, constitutes an agency action within the \nmeaning of the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704, and therefore, the Rule is judicially reviewable.

Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the \nbasis of sex in educational institutions receiving federal funds. It is predicated on the proposition \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 11 of 46\nthat the prevalence of sexual harassment and assault in educational settings requires ED, and \nschools themselves, to respond appropriately so that those experiencing such violence are not \ndenied educational opportunities based on sex.  \nI.  Widespread Sexual Harassment and Assault in Education \n30.  National studies, local surveys, and individual accounts confirm that sexual \nharassment in education is widespread. Students of all ages and across institutions are regularly \nsubjected to sexual harassment, undermining their equal access to educations.  \n31.  In 2015, the Association of American Universities (“AAU”) found that between \n48% and 74% of women undergraduates reported they had been sexually harassed without \nphysical contact,8 and 13% to 30% responded that they had been raped or sexually assaulted \nthrough physical force, violence, or incapacitation.9  \n32.  An Associated Press review of sexual assault reports from state education \nagencies and federal databases identified roughly 17,000 official reports of peer sexual assault in \ngrades K–12, filed between fall 2011 and spring 2015.10 More than 85% of those reporting \nsexual assault were girls.11  \n                                                           \n8 Am.

Girls and women are sexually harassed and assaulted at school more often than \nboys and men, and the rates of sexual harassment and assault are even higher among students of \ncolor, students with disabilities, LGBTQ students, and non-binary students. A 2013 study found \nthat among Black women in school, 16.5% reported being raped in high school and 36% \nreported being raped in college.12 At the university level, the 2015 AAU survey showed that \n31.6% of undergraduate women with disabilities reported nonconsensual sexual contact \ninvolving physical force or incapacitation, compared to 18.4% of undergraduate women without \na disability.13 A national school-based survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention with state, territorial, and local education and health agencies and tribal governments \nfrom 2007 to 2017 found that LGBTQ students are at greater risk for violence, including being \nthreatened or feeling unsafe at school and being forced to have sex.14 \nII.  Reporting of Sexual Harassment and Assault, and Dismissive or Punitive Responses \nby Schools \n34.  Research consistently demonstrates that students experiencing sexual harassment \nand assault rarely file official reports.15  \n35.  In a qualitative study of college students at a Midwestern college, the most \ncommonly cited reason for not seeking help from campus resources or reporting a sexual assault \n                                                           \n12 Carolyn M.

Numerous studies have found that stereotypes in the minds of decision-makers \noften result in disbelief or punitive responses toward sexual harassment complaints. \n37.  At the same time that students of color, students with disabilities, and LGBTQ \nand non-binary students experience sexual harassment and assault at higher rates than their peers, \nthey are also less likely to report or to be believed when they do report.  \n38.  Students of color “may avoid reporting incidents of sexual misconduct because of \na lack of trust in adjudicatory systems.”17 Such mistrust is widespread, even at institutions where \nstudents of color are the majority. Black girls and women who tried to defend themselves against \nsexual harassment or assault are more likely than their white peers to be punished when seeking \nschool support after sexual harassment or assault, in part because of stereotypes that they are \n“angry” or “aggressive.”18  \n39.  Students with disabilities are less likely to report because of concerns about being \n“less likely to be taken seriously when they make a report of sexual assault or abuse,” \n                                                           \n16 Am.

One study found that a majority of LGBTQ students harassed or assaulted at \nschool did not report these incidents to school staff because of concerns that school officials \nwould not help, that reporting would make the situation worse, and that “they would be \nmistreated, disbelieved, or blamed for their own assault, often because of discriminatory school \npolicies or practices.”21 \nIII.  Impact of Sexual Harassment in Schools on Students’ Educations and Lives \n41.  Sexual harassment profoundly undermines students’ educations and lives.  \n42.  Students who have experienced sexual harassment and violence have higher rates \nof withdrawal from school—34% drop out of college22—and lower GPAs than those who have \n                                                           \n19 Council of Parent Attorneys & Advocates, Comment on Proposed Rule (ED-2018-OCR-0064-104680). \nSee also The Leadership Council on Civil and Human Rights, Comment on Proposed Rule (ED-2018-\nOCR-0064-12002) (citing National Council on Disabilities, Not on the Radar: Sexual Assault of College \nStudents with Disabilities (Jan. 2018)). \n20 Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, Comment on Proposed Rule (ED-2018-OCR-0064-14977). \n21 Lambda Legal, Comment on Proposed Rule (ED-2018-OCR-0064-18240) (citing Tyler Kingkade, \nWhen Colleges Threaten to Punish Students who Report Sexual Violence, Huffington Post (Sept. 9, 2015), \nhttps://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sexual-assault-victims-\npunishment_us_55ada33de4b0caf721b3b61c; Sandy E.

According to one report, 68% of survivors struggle to \nfocus in class.23  \n43.  In the K–12 context, estimates demonstrate that upwards of 60% of girls who \nhave been pushed out of school are victims of rape or the threat of rape.24 Further, in the 2010–\n11 school year, 30% of students in grades 7–12 experienced online harassment; of these, 18% \nreported that it made them not want to go to school; 13% found it hard to study; and 17% had \ntrouble sleeping.25  \n44.  LGBTQ students who had been harassed had lower GPAs, were more than three \ntimes as likely to have missed school in the month prior, were almost twice as likely to report \nthat they did not plan on pursuing a secondary education, and experienced lower self-esteem and \nhigher levels of depression than their counterparts.26 \n45.

Students with limited access to financial resources who experience sexual \nharassment and violence are particularly disadvantaged. They often bear the immediate financial \nstress of sexual harassment, such as the cost of counseling, lost course credits or scholarships, \nand moving residences.29 Over a lifetime, the estimated financial cost of sexual assault to the \nindividual victim is between $87,000 and $240,776.30 This estimate includes the costs of lower \neducational attainment, lost wages, and job instability.  \nTITLE IX AND THE AGENCY’S GUIDANCE AND ACTIONS  \nON SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT \n47.  Title IX provides: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under \nany education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .” 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1681(a).

Title IX was modeled on Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000d et seq., which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in \nprograms receiving federal funding. Title IX and Title VI are generally interpreted in pari \nmateria, and until it issued this Rule, ED consistently imposed parallel obligations on schools to \nrespond to claims of harassment based on sex and race.  \n49.  Most colleges and universities, grades K–12 public schools, and many other \neducational and vocational programs are recipients of federal funding (“recipients” or \n“institutions”), and therefore are subject to Title IX and Title VI’s mandates. The U.S. Supreme \nCourt has explained that: “Title IX, like its model Title VI [] sought to accomplish two related, \nbut nevertheless somewhat different, objectives. First, Congress wanted to avoid the use of \nfederal resources to support discriminatory practices; second, it wanted to provide individual \ncitizens effective protection against those practices. Both of these purposes were repeatedly \nidentified in the debates on the two statutes.”31  \n50.  As the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized, sexual assault and sexual harassment \nare forms of sex discrimination under Title IX.32 \n51.  Sexual harassment and assault have long impeded educational opportunities and \nprofessional advancement of students, especially girls and women. The impact of this harassment \nand violence on students can be severe and long-term, including declines in grades, missed \n                                                           \n31 Cannon v.

Since 1997, the Agency has set standards governing the responsibilities of \nrecipients to address sexual harassment and assault to ensure their institutions do not tolerate sex \ndiscrimination. \n53.  Through guidance and enforcement documents spanning twenty years and \nmultiple administrations, the Agency articulated consistent standards under Title IX governing \nthe definition of sexual harassment, the requirements for what constitutes notice of harassment to \nrecipients, the standard of proof applicable in disciplinary hearings, and the obligation of \ninstitutions to take prompt and effective steps to end harassment, eliminate the hostile \nenvironment and its effects, prevent recurrence, and as appropriate, remedy its effects.33 These \n                                                           \n33 See U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Sexual Harassment Guidance: Peer Sexual Harassment, Draft Document and \nRequest for Comments, 61 Fed.

Informal resolution agreements regularly provide for changes in \ninstitutions’ policies, such as dissemination of information, training, climate assessments, \ncomplaint tracking, formation of a campus-based committee, as well as provision of remedies to \ncomplainants, such as counseling services, academic and living accommodations, reimbursement \nfor reasonably related expenses such as the cost of books and registration fees, and assurances \nthat retaliation is prohibited. The same process is used for enforcement of Title VI, Title II, and \nSection 504. \n55.  If recipients fail to comply and the noncompliance cannot be corrected by \ninformal means, the Agency may seek the suspension or termination of federal funding. \n34 C.F.R. § 100.8. To the best of Plaintiffs’ knowledge, in its history of Title IX enforcement, \nthe Agency has only once taken the ultimate step of suspending an institution’s funding based on \na recipient’s response to sexual harassment, and that suspension only affected part of the \nrecipient’s funding.  \nCURRENT ADMINISTRATION’S CHANGE IN TITLE IX POLICY  \n56.  On September 22, 2017, the Agency withdrew guidance documents that it had \nissued in 2011 and 2014 and released a new Dear Colleague Letter and Q & A on Campus \nSexual Misconduct. The 2017 guidance documents articulated radically different views on the \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 20 of 46\nstandard of evidence to be used in grievance proceedings and the obligation of institutions to \ninvestigate off-campus sexual harassment from those held by the Agency in the prior decades.  \n57.  On November 29, 2018, the Agency published its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n(“Proposed Rule”) titled “Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or \nActivities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance.” See 83 Fed. Reg. 61,462.  \n58.  The Agency received 124,196 comments during the comment period on the \nProposed Rule, which closed on February 15, 2019. \n59.  Since the close of the comment period more than a year ago, the education system \nin the United States, at both the K–12 and university level, has experienced the largest disruption \nand transformation in its history as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost every recipient \nor institution in the nation has dramatically shifted its operations to entirely remote, virtual \nclassrooms and communities. \n60.  On May 6, 2020, the Agency released the Rule. \nCHALLENGED PROVISIONS OF THE RULE \n61.  As stated previously, the Rule includes several provisions that are contrary to \nTitle IX and arbitrary and capricious.  \n62.  These provisions are a significant departure from ED’s prior standards and create \na double standard, treating sexual harassment less seriously than harassment on the basis of race, \nnational origin, and disability. \n63.  Moreover, the Agency failed to adequately consider important aspects of the \nproblem and provided justifications that were contrary to the evidence before it. \nI.  Definition of Sexual Harassment to Which Institutions Must Respond \n64.  Sections 106.30, 106.44, and 106.45 of the Rule arbitrarily limit the definition of \nsexual harassment to which institutions must respond in ways that exclude conduct ED \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 21 of 46\nhistorically recognized as denying equal access to education because of sex and in the face of \nsubstantial evidence that institutions have not sufficiently responded to reports.  \n65.  Section 106.30 of the Rule limits “sexual harassment” to conduct on the basis of \nsex that amounts to: “(1) An employee of the recipient conditioning the provision of an aid, \nbenefit, or service of the recipient on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct; \n(2) Unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and \nobjectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient’s education \nprogram or activity; or (3) ‘Sexual assault’ as defined in 20 U.S.C. 1092(f)(6)(A)(v), ‘dating \nviolence’ as defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(10), ‘domestic violence’ as defined in 34 U.S.C. \n12291(a)(8), or ‘stalking’ as defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(30).” § 106.30 (emphasis added).  \n66.  Sexual assault is defined in 20 U.S.C. § 1092(f)(6)(A)(v) as: “an offense \nclassified as a forcible or nonforcible sex offense under the uniform crime reporting system of \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation.” This definition does not include unwelcome physical \ntouching unless it is “[t]he touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of \nsexual gratification.” See Rule at 42 (“In these final regulations, the Department retains \nreference to sexual assault under the Clery Act . . . .” (emphasis added)); Rule at 447 n.631 \n(“Under the Clery Act (referring to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting system), fondling is a \nsex offense that means the ‘touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose \nof sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim[.]’” (emphasis and alteration in \noriginal)). \n67.  Sections 106.44 and 106.45 of the Rule further limit sexual harassment to which \nrecipients must respond to conduct that occurred in an “education program or activity” of the \ninstitution and “against a person in the U.S.” See also § 106.8(d). \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 22 of 46\nA.  Severe, Pervasive, and Objectively Offensive \n68.  Section 106.30 of the Rule limits the conduct that gives rise to institutions’ \nresponsibilities to act by changing the definition of harassment from a disjunctive list of “severe, \npervasive, or objectively offensive”—consistently used by the Agency since 1997—to a \nconjunctive list by replacing “or” with “and,” thus requiring all three conditions to be satisfied as \na condition of administrative enforcement for the first time since Title IX’s passage in 1972. \n \n69.  The Rule further orders institutions that they “must dismiss” Title IX complaints \nthat do not meet this heightened threshold. § 106.45(b)(3).  \n70.  Moreover, ED added an express preemption provision, § 106.6(h), compelling \nschools to dismiss Title IX complaints of sexual harassment that do not meet the Agency’s \ndefinition, even if it qualifies as harassment under state or local law.  \n71.   The new standard is also inconsistent with the definitions used for racial, national \norigin, and disability harassment, which use the disjunctive rather than the conjunctive. This \nensures many fewer incidents of sexual harassment will trigger schools’ responsibility to respond \ncompared to these other forms of harassment.\n \n72.  In an express acknowledgment of the different standards imposed on complaints \nof sexual harassment but not racial or other forms of harassment, ED gives institutions the choice \nof standards to apply in cases involving harassment based on both sex and race, but it requires \ninstitutions to use the heightened standard in cases involving harassment based on sex alone. \nRule at 1590.  \n73.  Requiring institutions to respond only when conduct is “severe” and “pervasive” \nand “objectively offensive” allows recipients to ignore a substantial range of conduct that causes \na student to be “denied the benefits of” education or “subjected to discrimination” because of \nsex. 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). Institutions would not have to respond to—and indeed, “must dismiss” \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 23 of 46\nTitle IX complaints filed on the basis of—repeated harassing comments or conduct that are \npervasive but might not be severe, or conduct that is severe but not pervasive. For example, in \nsome K–12 schools, students hit the body parts of other students regularly as part of what they \nrefer to as “Titty Tap Tuesday” or “Slap-ass Friday.” Because each separate incident may not be \nconsidered severe or pervasive, depending on the nature of the touching or how often any \nparticular student was touched, schools would have no obligation to address this misconduct \nunder Title IX.  \n74.  Section 106.30 permits institutions to ignore complaints of a range of physical \ntouching. It excludes unwanted touching, even of “private body parts,” for any reason other than \nsexual gratification, such as to humiliate, threaten or exert power, from its definition of sexual \nharassment, unless it is “severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive.” An institution would thus \nnot be obligated to investigate if a student complained that their peer had touched her breast \nwhile mocking her, because that would arguably not be for “sexual gratification.”  \n75.  Mandating that recipients “must dismiss” formal Title IX complaints where the \nharassment does not qualify as “severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive” allows institutions \nto ignore sexual harassment at early stages, before it escalates and causes greater harms to \nstudents and the educational community. In effect, it will enable schools to dismiss multiple \ncomplaints of “severe” and “objectively offensive” harassment, even if, considered together, they \nestablish a pattern or practice that is “pervasive.” And it denies victims of these forms of \nharassment recourse to the full panoply of remedies offered by their institutions in connection \nwith Title IX. \nB.  Off-Campus Conduct and Study Abroad \n76.  Sections 106.44 and 106.45 limit sexual harassment to which a school must \nrespond to conduct that occurred in its “education program or activity,” meaning that a school \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 24 of 46\n“must dismiss” many Title IX reports of assault that happen off campus without taking into \naccount the on-campus effects on its students. In conjunction with Section 106.30’s definition of \nsexual harassment, these provisions direct schools to ignore under Title IX the effect of many \ninstances of sexual harassment or assault that are perpetrated off campus, despite ED’s noting a \nstudy showing that over 40% of sexual assaults at the university level occur off campus. \n77.  Previous guidance made clear that institutions had the obligation to respond to a \nhostile environment that exists at school or on campus even where some of the conduct that \nculminated in that environment occurred off campus.34  \n78.  The Rule’s approach requires schools to ignore conduct when assessing a hostile \nenvironment under Title IX and is a change in Agency policy.35 \n79.  It is estimated that only 8% of all sexual assaults involving middle school, high \nschool, and college students occur on school property.36 Approximately 87 percent of college \nstudents live off campus, and many college sexual assaults occur at off-campus parties.37 One \n                                                           \n34 U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Q&A on Campus Sexual Misconduct (Sept. 2017), \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/qa-title-ix-201709.pdf; see also 2011 Dear Colleague \nLetter at 14 (“Schools may have an obligation to respond to student-on-student sexual harassment that \ninitially occurred off school grounds, outside a school’s education program or activity. . . . Because \nstudents often experience the continuing effects of off-campus sexual harassment in the educational \nsetting, schools should consider the effects of the off-campus conduct when evaluating whether there is a \nhostile environment on campus.”); 2014 Q&A (“[A] school must process all complaints of sexual \nviolence, regardless of where the conduct occurred, to determine whether the conduct occurred in the \ncontext of an education program or activity or had continuing effects on campus or in an off-campus \neducation program or activity.”). \n35 The impact of off-campus harassment on on-campus learning in settings controlled by the recipient was \nthe topic of many comments to the Rule, as required to bring an APA claim. See, e.g., The City Univ. of \nN.Y. (CUNY), Comment on Proposed Rule (ED-2018-OCR-0064-11739); Girls Inc., Comment on \nProposed Rule (ED-2018-OCR-0064-11341). \n36 End Rape on Campus, Comment on Proposed Rule (ED-2018-OCR-0064-104527); Equal Rights \nAdvocates, Comment on Proposed Rule (ED-2018-OCR-0064-104091). \n37 See Equal Rights Advocates, Comment on Proposed Rule (ED-2018-OCR-0064-104091); Legal Voice, \nComment on Proposed Rule (ED-2018-OCR-0064-102843). \n \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 25 of 46\nstudy found that 38% of women undergraduates experienced sexual harassment and assault while \nstudying abroad.38 These assaults often have continuing effects when students return to campus \nthat can limit or deny a student’s equal access to education. Yet many are precluded from \nconsideration by the challenged sections. \n80.  Although the Agency itself recognized that approximately 41% of college sexual \nassaults occur off campus, 83 Fed. Reg. at 61,487 n.27, it did so only in considering the cost \nsavings for institutions resulting from having to conduct fewer investigations.39 It did not address \nthe impact on the victims of these off-campus sexual assaults if their claims were not \ninvestigated. Despite many comments criticizing this aspect of the Proposed Rule, ED has not \nsufficiently explained how reducing the number of sexual assaults that institutions are required to \ninvestigate, only because they include some off-campus conduct, is consistent with Title IX. \n81.  The Agency also completely excluded sexual harassment committed abroad from \nTitle IX protections, requiring that it be perpetrated “against a person in the United States.” \n§§ 106.44(a), 106.8(d) (“[R]equirements . . . apply only to sex discrimination occurring against a \nperson in the United States.”). Its explanation for this exclusion is inadequate, particularly \nbecause the Agency has interpreted Title VI to apply to discriminatory conduct outside the \nUnited States in some situations.40  \n                                                           \n38 Am. Soc’y of Criminology, Div. of Women & Crime, Comment on Proposed Rule (ED-2018-OCR-\n0064-6883). \n39 83 Fed. Reg. at 61,487 & n.27. \n40 U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Title VI Legal Manual, Section V: Defining Title VI 6 (Sept. 27, 2016) (“Title VI \nmay apply to discriminatory conduct outside the United States in certain narrow circumstances, \ndepending on how much control the recipient exercises over the overseas operation and how integral the \noverseas operation is to the recipient’s program in the U.S.”). \n \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 26 of 46\n82.  Allowing institutions to ignore hostile environments in their educational programs \nsimply because they may stem from off-site harassment or assault, or from study abroad, is \ncontrary to Title IX. OCR recently found that a Chicago public school violated Title IX based on \nits insufficient response to a student’s report that she was raped by schoolmates while walking \nhome from school.41 Under sections 106.44 and 106.45, the school could entirely ignore the \nsame report today with no adverse consequences to the school, despite ED’s conclusory assertion \nto the contrary. Similarly, institutions could ignore reports of sexual harassment committed in \nprograms they sponsor abroad, even when they exercise substantial control over both the \nrespondent and the context in which the sexual harassment occurs. The educational \nconsequences to the students of having their reports ignored do not appear to have been \nadequately considered by the Agency when it adopted the Rule. \nC.  Unlawful Departure from Consistent Definitions of Harassment \n83.  Section 106.30 defines “sexual harassment” under Title IX differently than \nharassment based on race, national origin, and disability under analogous civil rights laws. \nDespite receiving comments to this effect, ED has not sufficiently explained its rationale for this \ndouble standard or for its adoption of this double standard for the first time in the history of Title \nIX. \n84.  ED consistently defines harassment on the basis of characteristics other than sex \n(such as race, national origin, and disability) to include conduct that is “sufficiently severe, \n                                                           \n41 OCR Case #05-15-1178 and 05-17-1062 (Sept. 12, 2019), \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/05151178-a.pdf (“The evidence \nestablishes that the District violated Title IX when it failed to conclude the investigation of the complaint \nthat Student B had been raped by XXX male XXXX students [while walking home from school], assess \nthe potential danger to the XXXX community raised by Student B’s complaint and take action as \nnecessary to ensure the community’s safety, and provide appropriate support services to Student B as she \nstruggled to continue her education.”). \n \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 27 of 46\npervasive, or persistent so as to interfere with or limit a student’s ability to participate in or \nbenefit from the services, activities, or opportunities offered by” an educational institution.42  \n85.  Section 106.30’s different definition of sexual harassment means ED requires \ninstitutions to address some conduct if based on race, national origin, or disability, but not if \nbased on sex. \n86.  Moreover, Title VII and the Fair Housing Act define harassment, including sexual \nharassment, to reach conduct that is severe or pervasive.43 Recipients are subject to all three \nstatutes because they act as educators and employers and housing providers. For the first time, \nthe Rule subjects them to divergent definitions of sexual harassment under Title IX than under \neither Title VII or the Fair Housing Act, which would lead to different consequences and \nobligations for the exact same conduct. \nII.  Notice to the Institution \n87.  Sections 106.30 and 106.44 of the Rule allow colleges and universities to ignore \ncomplaints of sexual harassment unless they are made to one of a very limited number of \n                                                           \n42 See, e.g., U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Investigative Guidance on Racial Incidents and Harassment Against \nStudents (Mar. 10, 1994), https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/race394.html [hereinafter 1994 \nRacial Harassment Guidance]; U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 2000 Dear Colleague Letter, Prohibited Disability \nHarassment (July 25, 2000), https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/disabharassltr.html \n[hereinafter 2000 Dear Colleague Letter]. \n43 See Meritor Sav. Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 67 (1986) (sexual harassment is actionable when it is \n“sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter or the conditions of the victim’s employment”) \n(emphasis added and internal quotation marks, alterations, and citation omitted); 24 C.F.R. § 100.600 \n(HUD defines harassment to include “unwelcome conduct that is sufficiently severe or pervasive” \n(emphasis added)). \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 28 of 46\nindividuals. As a practical matter, this means that reports made to the vast majority of a higher \neducation institution’s staff will never be investigated—a result that ED itself predicts. \n88.  Section 106.44(a) provides that “[a] recipient with actual knowledge of sexual \nharassment in an education program or activity of the recipient against a person in the United \nStates, must respond promptly in a manner that is not deliberately indifferent.” (emphasis added).  \n89.  Section 106.30 provides that: \nActual knowledge means notice of sexual harassment or allegations \nof sexual harassment to a recipient’s Title IX Coordinator or any \nofficial of the recipient who has authority to institute corrective \nmeasures on behalf of the recipient, or to any employee of an \nelementary and secondary school. Imputation of knowledge based \nsolely on vicarious liability or constructive notice is insufficient to \nconstitute actual knowledge. This standard is not met when the only \nofficial of the recipient with actual knowledge is the respondent. The \nmere ability or obligation to report sexual harassment or to inform a \nstudent about how to report sexual harassment, or having been \ntrained to do so, does not qualify an individual as one who has \nauthority to institute corrective measures on behalf of the recipient. \n“Notice” as used in this paragraph includes, but is not limited to, a \nreport of sexual harassment to the Title IX Coordinator as described \nin § 106.8(a). \n90.  Sections 106.30 and 106.44(a) specify that a recipient is required to respond to \nsexual harassment only if it has “actual knowledge.”  \n91.  Under these provisions, a college or university would be deemed to have actual \nknowledge only if notice is provided to its Title IX Coordinator or any official with the authority \nto institute corrective measures on behalf of the institution. The result of this requirement is that \ncolleges and universities would have no obligations under federal law to address even egregious \nexamples of misconduct—such as the sexual abuse by Larry Nassar reported to athletic coaches. \nIn the elementary and secondary school context, but not colleges and universities, “actual \nknowledge” includes notice to any employees.  \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 29 of 46\n92.  The requirement that college and graduate students contact the “right” employee \nbefore an institution has any obligation is a sharp departure from prior ED guidance.  \n93.  The Agency previously required a recipient to respond to sexual harassment if \n“the school knows or should have known of the harassment,” including harassment the school \nwould have found out about through a “reasonably diligent inquiry.”44 Under the prior standard, \ninstitutions could be on notice if students reported the conduct to trusted adults such as a campus \nsecurity officer, professor, or athletic coach, if staff themselves witnessed the harassment, or if \nthe incident was publicized in the media or flyers about the incident widely posted at the \ncollege.45 No longer. \n94.  The new notice requirement creates a disincentive for higher education \ninstitutions to learn about possible harassment on campus because without “actual knowledge,” \nthey can avoid liability for failure to respond at all, let alone adequately.46  \n95.  The narrow definition of who must receive notice is also inconsistent with \ninstitutions’ obligations under analogous civil rights statutes. ED continues to require recipients \nto respond to claims of racial, national origin, or disability harassment where the institution \n“knows or reasonably should know of possible” harassment.47 \n                                                           \n44 1997 Guidance, 62 Fed. Reg. at 12,039–12,040, 12,042. \n45 Id.; 2010 Dear Colleague Letter at 2. \n46 The City Univ. of N.Y.

The “actual notice” requirement makes institutions less responsible for addressing \nsexual harassment committed against students than against its adult employees under Title VII.48 \n97.  ED failed to adequately consider evidence that students are unlikely to report \nsexual harassment and assault, and if they report at all they report to adults that they have \nrelationships with, regardless of whether that adult has the authority to institute corrective \nmeasures.49 This is especially true for students with disabilities. \nIII.  Deliberate Indifference Provision \n98.  Section 106.44 of the Rule dramatically limits institutions’ obligations to respond \nto conduct that constitutes sexual harassment by allowing them to act in a manner that is \nunreasonable, as long as they are not “deliberately indifferent.”  \n99.  This provision heightens the level of indifference to sexual harassment and assault \nthat a school must exhibit before it violates Title IX; it also eliminates, or at least changes, \ninstitutions’ obligations to address certain circumstances of sexual assault, including when the \neffect of sexual harassment is campus-wide. This reduction in institutional accountability is not \nadequately explained, even though these concerns were raised in the comments before the \nagency.  \nA.  Heightened Level of Indifference  \n100.  Under Section 106.44(a), “A recipient with actual knowledge of sexual \nharassment in an education program or activity of the recipient against a person in the United \nStates, must respond in a manner that is not deliberately indifferent. A recipient is deliberately \n                                                           \n48 See 29 C.F.R. § 1604.11(d). \n49 See, e.g., Am. Psychological Ass’n, Comment on Proposed Rule (ED-2018-OCR-0064-30626). \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 31 of 46\nindifferent only if its response to sexual harassment is clearly unreasonable in light of the known \ncircumstances.”  \n101.  Under prior guidance, recipients were affirmatively obligated to “take immediate \nand appropriate steps to investigate or otherwise determine what occurred and take steps \nreasonably calculated to end any harassment, eliminate a hostile environment if one has been \ncreated, and prevent harassment from occurring again . . . [I]n appropriate circumstances, the \nschool [was] also . . . responsible for taking steps to remedy the effects of the harassment on the \nindividual student or students who were harassed.” 1997 Guidance, 62 Fed. Reg. at 12,042.50 \n102.  By providing that even if a recipient has actual knowledge of sexual harassment, \nit need only respond in a manner that is not “deliberately indifferent,” the Rule imposes a much \nmore lenient standard on institutions than is applicable in other types of harassment cases. \nB.  Campus-Wide Effects \n103.  The Rule removes the prior obligation on institutions to address a hostile \nenvironment beyond the effects on an individual complainant or respondent without \nacknowledgement or good reason.  \n                                                           \n50 See also 2001 Guidance at 14 (listing factors OCR would review when receiving complaints about \nschool’s treatment of sexual harassment including whether “the school appropriately investigated or \notherwise responded to allegations of sexual harassment; and [whether] the school had taken immediate \ncorrective action.”); 2006 Dear Colleague Letter (“[A]n educational institution’s responsibility, as a \ncondition of receiving Federal financial assistance, to take immediate and effective steps to end sexual \nharassment when it occurs, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects.”); 2008 Q&A at 11; 2010 Dear \nColleague Letter at 2.  \n  Under the Rule, a school faces the Department’s intervention not when its actions fail to be \n“appropriate” or “effective,” and not even when its response to sexual harassment and assault is \n“unreasonable,” but only when its actions are so grossly below acceptable conduct that they were “clearly \nunreasonable.”  \n \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 32 of 46\n104.  The Agency has long instructed institutions that they must take steps “to eliminate \nany hostile environment that has been created,” which may include interventions for an entire \nclass “to repair the educational environment” or for an “entire school or campus.”  \n105.  The Rule, by contrast, imposes no obligation on institutions to remedy a hostile \neducational environment beyond providing specific remedies for an individual student who files \na complaint.51 This is inconsistent with Title VI, Title II, and Section 504. \nIV.  Evidentiary Standard  \n106.  Section 106.45(b)(1)(vii) of the Rule allows institutions to adopt a “clear and \nconvincing evidence” standard of proof, more stringent than typically required when evaluating \ncomplaints brought under other civil rights laws, including private damages actions under Title \nIX. This places a heavier burden on those alleging sexual harassment than on students who allege \nother forms of harassment. Moreover, in some situations, the provision will force schools to use \na “clear and convincing evidence” standard for sexual harassment claims, even though they will \nbe free to use “preponderance of the evidence” for harassment based on race, national origin, or \ndisability.  \n107.  Section 106.45(b)(1)(vii) requires institutions to “[s]tate whether the standard of \nevidence to be used to determine responsibility is the preponderance of the evidence standard or \nthe clear and convincing evidence standard, apply the same standard of evidence for formal \ncomplaints against students as for formal complaints against employees, including faculty, and \napply the same standard of evidence to all formal complaints of sexual harassment.”  \n                                                           \n51 See, e.g., Ass’n of Title IX Adm’rs (ATIXA), Comment on Proposed Rule (ED-2018-OCR-0064-\n104725). \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 33 of 46\n108.  Institutions are now free to adopt a clear and convincing evidence standard for \ncases involving sexual harassment and assault even if they employ a preponderance of the \nevidence standard in all other kinds of proceedings. Moreover, institutions are now required to \nadopt the higher standard if they use it for sexual harassment complaints against faculty. \n§ 106.45(b)(1)(vii). Many institutions are required to use the clear and convincing standard for \nfaculty disciplinary proceedings under collective bargaining agreements or other employment \ncontracts.52 The Rule now selectively requires uniformity across the employment and student \ndisciplinary contexts for sexual harassment, but not other forms of harassment. \n109.  This provision breaks with twenty years of prior policy by effectively requiring \nthat institutions use a “clear and convincing” standard of proof in many circumstances. The \nAgency has failed to provide good reasons for this dramatic shift.  \n110.  Promoting the use of a clear and convincing standard of proof for sexual \nharassment complaints is internally inconsistent with other provisions of the Rule that require \nthat institutions “[t]reat complainants and respondents equitably,” § 106.45(a)(1)(i), and adopt \ngrievance procedures that provide for an “equitable resolution” of student complaints, § 106.8(c). \nOCR interpreted the Title IX regulations to mandate recipients’ use of the preponderance of the \nevidence standard for “equitable resolution” of sexual harassment complaints as early as 1995.53  \n111.  Under the clear and convincing evidence standard, institutions have no obligation \nto provide complainants remedies that might impact a respondent, such as a transfer in \n                                                           \n52 See, e.g., The City Univ. of N.Y. (CUNY), Comment on Proposed Rule (ED-2018-OCR-0064-11739); \nMass. Dep’t of Higher Educ., Comment on Proposed Rule (ED-2018-OCR-0064-17538); Nat’l Ass’n of \nClery Compliance Officers & Prof’ls, Comment on Proposed Rule (ED-2018-OCR-0064-104911). \n53 U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Investigation Letter in Evergreen State College Case. No. 10922064, at 9 (Apr. 4, \n1995), https://www.ncherm.org/documents/193-EvergreenStateCollege10922064.pdf. \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 34 of 46\nclassrooms or dormitories, where it is more likely than not that the respondent sexually harassed \nor assaulted a complainant.  \nV.  Cumulative Effect of Challenged Provisions  \n112.  Taken together, the provisions described above radically undermine Title IX’s \nmandate that institutions prevent and respond to sexual harassment that interferes with students’ \neducational opportunities. Collectively, they impose radically different and reduced \nresponsibilities on schools to address sexual harassment than to address harassment based on \nrace, national origin, and disability, despite the fact that the governing statutes treat these forms \nof harassment and assault equally. ED has offered no adequate explanation for any of the \ndifferential standards, much less for their cumulative impact.  \n113.  While each of the challenged provisions on its own impermissibly reduces the \nresponsibility of institutions to respond to sexual harassment and assault, their cumulative effect \nexacerbates the violation.  \n114.  Under these provisions, institutions may wholly ignore reports of sexual \nharassment that interfere with a student’s educational opportunities unless the following \nconditions are satisfied: (a) the sexual harassment takes place on campus or school grounds (or in \nan education program, excluding study abroad); (b) the harassment could qualify as “severe, \npervasive, and objectively offensive”; and (c) the student reports the harassment to an \nenumerated school official. Even where all of those criteria are met, the institution may be \nindifferent to the student’s report and need only avoid being “deliberately indifferent.” In other \nwords, the new standard allows institutions to respond unreasonably to reports of sexual \nharassment. And the further indirect requirement that many schools adopt the demanding “clear \nand convincing evidence” standard means that complainants of sexual harassment may face a \nstandard imposed on no others. They will also no longer be entitled to the full range of remedies \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 35 of 46\nthat they may need to continue their education free from discrimination, even where it is more \nlikely than not that sexual harassment or assault occurred. \n115.  The combination of challenged provisions also vastly changes the incentives of \ninstitutions to prioritize preventing and deterring sexual harassment. Under the challenged \nprovisions, an institution’s failure to effectively prevent and promptly respond to sexual \nharassment will be much less likely to carry any consequences than its failure to effectively \nprevent and promptly respond to any other kind of harassment. \nVI.  ED’s Explanations Are Arbitrary and Capricious Because They Are Contrary to \nEvidence and Fail to Adequately Consider Important Aspects of the Problem \n116.  The challenged provisions are particularly arbitrary and capricious because they \nreduce recipients’ responsibilities to address sexual harassment in the face of compelling \nevidence of the enormous, well-documented problem of underreporting of sexual harassment and \nassault. The challenged provisions will result in a large percentage of students with bona fide \ncomplaints of sexual harassment and assault being turned away or ignored by their institutions.54 \n117.  ED admitted there would be a reduction in investigations of approximately 32 \npercent. Rule at 1985; Proposed Rule, 83 Fed. Reg. at 61,487. \n118.  ED also fails to adequately respond to the concern that the reduction in \ninvestigations will chill reporting, and thus undermine institutions’ ability to offer educational \nprograms free from sex discrimination. ED fails to respond to the concern that already there is an \nunderreporting of assaults55 and thus ongoing unaddressed discrimination. \n                                                           \n54 See, e.g., Ass’n of Title IX Adm’rs (ATIXA), Comment on Proposed Rule (ED-2018-OCR-0064-\n104725). \n55 See, e.g., Futures Without Violence, Comment on Proposed Rule (ED-2018-OCR-0064-123900); Ctr. \nfor Survivor Agency & Justice, Comment on Proposed Rule (ED-2018-OCR-0064-31005); Ctr. for Am. \nProgress, Comment on Proposed Rule (ED-2018-OCR-0064-31283); Bonnie S. Fisher et al., The Sexual \nVictimization of College Women, Nat’l Inst. of Justice, BJS Research Report (2000), \n \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 36 of 46\n119.  The Agency further fails to adequately address the consequences on the \neducational opportunities of students whose complaints of sexual harassment are improperly \ndismissed or discouraged by the challenged provisions.56  \n120.  ED also failed to justify the net costs of the Rule, which are significant: between \n$48.6 and $62.2 million over the next ten years. The Agency’s previous conclusion in the \nProposed Rule was that the Rule would result in net savings of $286.4 to $367.7 million. It now \nrecognizes some of the costs of the Rule, but reaches the unreasonable and arbitrary conclusion \nthat these costs are justified. \n121.  According to ED, the supposed purpose of the Rule is to make it easier for those \nexperiencing sexual harassment or assault to come forward, with “the goal of encouraging more \nstudents to turn to their schools for support in the wake of sexual harassment.” 83 Fed. Reg. at \n61,462. Evidence submitted in the comments to the Rule overwhelmingly shows that the \nchallenged provisions will in fact have the opposite chilling effect, and ED fails to adequately \nrespond to these concerns.57 \n                                                           \nhttps://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/182369.pdf; Am.

If allowed to take effect, the provisions challenged here will inflict significant \nharm on students who experience sexual harassment or assault and those who advocate on their \nbehalf, including Plaintiffs. The challenged provisions dramatically undermine students’ civil \nrights and will limit their ability to access measures that enable them to continue with their \neducations. The challenged provisions’ erosion of schools’ obligations will also result in fewer \ninstitutions taking proactive measures to prevent, investigate, and address sexual harassment and \nassault.   \n123.  Plaintiffs, themselves or their members, are harmed by the barriers that the \nchallenged provisions erect against students seeking to report sexual harassment and assault and \nto receive supportive measures. Even before issuance of the final rule, the threat that ED would \nroll back civil rights protections for students began forcing Plaintiffs to divert resources from \ntheir planned activities, thereby undermining their missions and impairing their daily operations \nand resource allocation. \n124.  Know Your IX, a project of Advocates for Youth, works directly with high school \nand college students in multiple capacities, such as: creating toolkits and resources about Title \nIX; providing technical assistance and resources and referrals to student survivors; and \nconducting in-person and online trainings on a variety of topics. Additionally, Know Your IX \nengages in advocacy to enact proactive policies and defeat harmful measures at the campus, \nlocal, state, and federal levels. Know Your IX works with students to build campaigns for policy \nreform at their schools. Know Your IX also helps run multiple networks of legal and non-legal \ncoalition partners that work to combat sexual harassment in education. In this role, Know Your \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 38 of 46\nIX leads calls, facilitates sharing of resources and connections between different stakeholders, \nand provides webinar trainings.  \n125.  Following the Agency’s issuance of the 2017 Q & A, which rescinded prior \nguidance and previewed ED’s plan to engage in rulemaking on sexual misconduct, Know Your \nIX experienced an uptick in inquiries from students, including individuals seeking advice about \nhow the regulatory changes would affect their cases and student leaders requesting school \ntrainings. In anticipation of the Rule, Know Your IX received a spike in training requests for \nSpring 2020. \n126.  Know Your IX expects the number of calls and training requests to increase \nfurther now that the Rule has been released. This requires Advocates for Youth’s Know Your IX \nproject manager to divert core resources to conduct additional trainings, particularly online \ntrainings for national audiences, explaining the Rule and its implications for students wanting to \nreport sexual harassment and assault. Because the challenged provisions reduce schools’ \nobligations to respond to sexual harassment and assault, Know Your IX must devote increased \nresources to training, to minimize the risk that some students’ bona fide complaints will be \ndismissed for failure to meet the challenged provisions’ standards. Moreover, advising each \nstudent about their rights to have an education free from sex discrimination, and specifically their \nrights to accommodations, will be more onerous and time-intensive given that some schools will \noffer parallel grievance proceedings to handle sexual misconduct complaints that fall outside the \nRule’s scope. In addition to planning post-Rule trainings for students, Know Your IX has been \nworking with partners to develop a training for state legislators to discuss proactive measures \nstates can take to protect student survivors’ legal rights as is necessitated by the Rule’s rescission \nof protections at the federal level. \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 39 of 46\n127.  The demand for national trainings on the Rule’s content will necessitate a \nreduction in Know Your IX’s current efforts related to COVID-19 and institutions’ moves to \ndistance learning. Presently, Know Your IX is providing support, letter templates, local \nresources, and organizing strategies to individual students and student groups about what to do if \ntheir Title IX cases are being impacted during this period, with, for example, indefinite delays in \nresolving outstanding complaints and failures to provide, or to facilitate the provision of, \nsupportive measures (e.g., counseling services while off-campus). Now that the Rule has been \nreleased, Know Your IX will have to reduce the advocacy it is doing on these subjects. It will \nalso have to dedicate additional time to determining whether the Rule’s requirements apply to \npreexisting Title IX complaints that have been put on hold.  \n128.  Even before the Rule’s release, Know Your IX had to dedicate time to developing \nresources in anticipation of the final Rule. These resources include materials about which \nprovisions of the Rule are mandatory or permissive for schools to implement and a guide for \nindividuals looking to shortly file a complaint. With the Rule now issued, Know Your IX expects \nto shift a significant amount of time to recreating its library of educational materials. \n129.  In order to meet the increased work demands presented by the Rule’s challenged \nprovisions, Advocates for Youth will have to spend time that it otherwise would not have to \napplying for additional grants for Know Your IX and engaging in greater fundraising efforts so \nas to hire additional Know Your IX staff to lead the trainings that are now necessary.  \n130.  To respond to the increase in student outreach, to conduct trainings, and to create \neducational materials about the final Rule, Know Your IX will need to forgo many of its planned \nactivities for 2020, including Fall 2020 regional trainings focused on building local resource \nnetworks for students and translation of its resources into five languages and Braille. For \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 40 of 46\nexample, Know Your IX had recently begun a new project on creating financial and legal \neducation resources for survivors experiencing retaliation. Because of the Rule, members of the \nKnow Your IX team will reduce the time and effort spent on this new project from what was \nplanned.  \n131.  COPAA’s work centers on the protection of the rights of students with \ndisabilities, who are far too often the targets of sexual harassment and assault. COPAA’s \nmembers who advocate on behalf of students will be injured by the challenged provisions of the \nRule. One of COPAA’s members whose work will be negatively affected is a Michigan attorney \nwho joined COPAA in 2018. Her private practice primarily entails representing K–12 and \ncollege students, as well as higher education staff and faculty, in Title IX proceedings and \nadvocating on behalf of K–12 special education students seeking services in their public schools. \nShe also takes family and employment law cases. \n132.  Because of the changes in the Rule, student complainants will face more hurdles \nand be less likely to succeed in the Title IX administrative proceedings. As a result, this COPAA \nmember will file fewer administrative complaints. Those she pursues will be more difficult and \ntake more time to resolve.  \n133.  Since the changes to Rule provisions reduce clients’ incentives to pursue \nadministrative relief, this COPAA member will likely focus more on seeking relief in court. Due \nto the more resource-intensive nature of litigation, this COPAA member will be forced to take on \nfewer clients, particularly, fewer pro bono representations.  \n134.  Because this COPAA member’s Title IX work will demand increased time and \nresources under the Rule, she will have to take on fewer cases in her other practice areas. The \ndecrease she anticipates in her special education caseload is especially troubling because she is \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 41 of 46\none of the few attorneys representing students with disabilities in her geographic area and in \nMichigan more broadly. This trade-off between dedicating resources to Title IX and special \neducation matters runs counter to COPAA’s mission, including through legal representation, that \nstudents with disabilities receive high-quality educational services. \n135.  A core part of GGE’s work is to end gender-based and racialized violence within \nschools, to ensure institutions adopt policies that are responsive to student needs, and to equip \nstudents to support one another and combat these endemic problems. To that end, for over 16 \nyears, GGE has worked with middle and high school students of all genders, to identify their \nneeds and concerns regarding, in part, their public school educations. GGE has overseen two \nparticipatory research processes involving young people, which confirmed the prevalence of \nsexual harassment of students in public schools, the inadequacy of school responses, and the \nneed to empower students to advocate for themselves. GGE also runs programs for young \nstudents: (a) to develop self-care and healthy relationship practices following sexual abuse \n(Sisters in Strength); and (b) to have the tools and opportunities to locally implement their policy \nrecommendations, including those related to Title IX (Young Women’s Advisory Council). \nFinally, GGE has led efforts to reform the sexual misconduct policies and practices of the New \nYork City Department of Education (NYC DOE), the nation’s largest public school district. \nGGE’s multi-year organizing efforts culminated in secured funding for the district to hire seven \nmore Title IX coordinators, where previously the school district employed only one.  \n136.  Given the diminished responsibility under federal law for schools to respond to \nreports of sexual harassment and assault under the challenged provisions of the final Rule, GGE \nwill need to dedicate additional staff time and resources to advocate at the local and state levels \nfor measures that are proven to prevent the occurrence of sexual harassment and assault, such as \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 42 of 46\ncomprehensive sex education with an emphasis on consent, and educating NYC school district \nadministrators about their continued obligations to provide educational environments free from \nsex discrimination under more protective state and local policies. As part of its advocacy pushing \nthe NYC DOE to develop a clear reporting pathway for sexual misconduct, GGE will rely more \nheavily on its partners in the New York City Council and their ability to hold the district \naccountable.  \n137.  SSAIS’s educational advocacy takes many forms. SSAIS personnel regularly \nadvise and provide technical assistance to K–12 student survivors and their parents/guardians as \nthey contemplate taking and pursuing remedial action through their schools, the OCR process, or \nthe courts. SSAIS offers K-12 students and families toolkits and resources that promote \nunderstanding of their schools’ Title IX responsibilities to address sexual harassment, and what \nresponsive measures families can take should schools fail to meet those obligations. And SSAIS \ncollaborates with K–12 administrators to improve their schools’ sexual misconduct policies and \npractices and disseminates best practices to schools nationwide. As one of the few advocacy \norganizations focused exclusively on the impact of sexual violence for students in K–12, SSAIS \nhas launched media campaigns, such as #MeTooK12, to draw attention to this often-overlooked \npopulation. Journalists, educational administrators, and federal policymakers consult SSAIS for \nits expertise on issues pertaining to addressing K–12 sexual harassment and assault.  \n138.  Following issuance of the Rule, SSAIS must now dedicate a substantial amount of \ntime to analyzing the Rule (particularly how it applies to cyberharassment in light of the \nprevalence of distance learning), assessing existing or needed state or local parallel protections to \nfill in gaps created by the challenged provisions of the Rule, recreating educational materials, \nand providing technical assistance to students, families, educators, and journalists. While SSAIS \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 43 of 46\nintends to recreate many of its materials, it may not be able to recreate them all, such as its \neducational film, Sexual Harassment: Not in Our School!, absent added funding. \n139.  This diversion of resources means that SSAIS will lack the capacity and time to \npursue projects it had planned to accomplish in 2020. For example, SSAIS will no longer be able \nto develop and distribute a restorative justice policy, expand its advocacy on behalf of private \nschool students, start a new project to investigate Title IX compliance nationwide, or launch a \nprotocol on creating gender equity clubs in high schools.  \n140.  These reallocations of resources and the burdens of the additional work that \nPlaintiffs must undertake to combat the harmful effects of the Rule frustrate their missions. \n141.  All Plaintiffs have already had to divert staff time and resources from their core \nwork in order to draft comments to the Proposed Rule, organize comment-writing efforts, meet \nwith Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs personnel, prepare to challenge the Rule in \ncourt, and/or prep for the Rule’s aftermath. These activities represent shifts from the \norganizations’ typical activities, especially since Plaintiffs Know Your IX/Advocates for Youth, \nGGE, and SSAIS have never commented on a federal rulemaking or participated as a plaintiff in \nlitigation.  \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nSections 106.8, 106.30, 106.44, and 106.45 of the Rule Are Contrary to Law, and Arbitrary, \nCapricious, and an Abuse of Discretion \n(Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)) \n142.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 141 are incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 44 of 46\n143.  Sections 106.8, 106.30, 106.44, and 106.45 of the Rule are contrary to law, in \nviolation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), because they conflict with \nTitle IX by narrowing the meaning of discrimination that is prohibited under Title IX. \n144.  Sections 106.8, 106.30, 106.44, and 106.45 are also arbitrary, capricious, and an \nabuse of discretion in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) because \nthey do not serve Title IX’s objectives; they single out sexual harassment of students for less \nprotection and force students to face higher barriers than students alleging harassment on the \nbasis of race, national origin, and disability, and they break with longstanding policy without \ngood reasons.  \n145.  The Agency failed to consider important aspects of the problem before it, and its \njustifications for the challenged provisions were contrary to the evidence before it and/or are \nimplausible. \n146.  The Agency failed to conduct an adequate regulatory impact analysis reflecting \nthe considerable costs to students as evinced by the rulemaking record, pursuant to Executive \nOrder 12,866, 58 Fed. Reg. 51,735, and instructions from the Office of Management and \nBudget’s Circular A-4 on Regulatory Analysis (2003). \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiffs pray that this Court: \n1.  Declare that the following provisions of the Rule are contrary to law, arbitrary and \ncapricious, and an abuse of discretion, and therefore invalid: \na.

The provisions specifying that a recipient is only required to respond to sexual \nharassment if it has “actual knowledge” (§§ 106.30, 106.44(a)); \nc.  The provisions holding an institution accountable under Title IX only for \n“deliberate indifference” (§ 106.44(a)-(b)); and \nd.  The provision allowing institutions to use a “clear and convincing evidence \nstandard” and requiring that standard if used for formal complaints of sexual \nharassment against employees (§ 106.45(b)(1)(vii)); \n2.  Enter vacatur as appropriate;  \n3.  Enter injunctive relief as appropriate;  \n4.

Specifically, they contend that \nthose provisions of the Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or \nActivities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance regulation, 85 Fed. Reg. 30,026 (May 19, \n2020)  (to  be  codified  at  34  C.F.R.  pt.  106)  (‘Rule”),  contravene  the  Administrative \nProcedures Act (“APA”).  (Compl. For Decl. & Inj. Relief ¶¶ 142-46, ECF No. 1.)  Plaintiffs \nseek an order declaring the Rule violates the APA, as well as vacatur of the Rule and \ninjunctive  relief  as  appropriate.    (Id.  at  45-46.)    Defendants,  Elisabeth  D.  Devos,  U.S. \nSecretary  of  Education,  Kenneth  L.  Marcus,  Assistant  Secretary  for  Civil  Rights  at  the \nDepartment of Education, and the U.S. Department of Education have filed a Motion to \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 43   Filed 10/20/20   Page 2 of 19\nDismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint on the grounds that each of the Plaintiffs lack standing.1  \nThree of the Plaintiffs have no independent Article III standing.  Supreme Court precedent \nprovides that in a case of multiple Plaintiffs, only one must establish standing.  Thus, all four \nPlaintiffs in this case must look to the standing of the lead Plaintiff Know Your Title IX, \nwhich  has  not  adequately  alleged  facts  to  establish  its  standing  to  bring  this  action.  \nAccordingly, for the reasons that follow, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED and \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. \nBACKGROUND \n  Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 provides that “[n]o person in the \nUnited States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the \nbenefits  of,  or  be  subjected  to  discrimination  under  any  education  program  or  activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  The Supreme Court has held \nthat sexual harassment and sexual assault may constitute unlawful sex discrimination.  See, \ne.g., Davis v. Monroe Cty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629 (1999).  In May 2020, the U.S. Department \nof Education (“ED”) promulgated a rule that clearly defines behavior constituting sexual \nharassment under Title IX, as well as sets forth procedures for addressing such misconduct.  \nSee Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving \nFederal Financial Assistance, 85 Fed. Reg. 30,026 (May 19, 2020) (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. \npt. 106) (“Rule”).  This is the first time the ED has issued regulations that treat such acts as \nunlawful sex discrimination as well.   \n \n1 The pending Motion to Intervene as Defendants (ECF No. 20) by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, \nthe Independent Women’s Law Center, and Speech First, Inc. is DENIED AS MOOT in light of this Court’s Dismissal \nof this case. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 43   Filed 10/20/20   Page 3 of 19\nPlaintiffs Know Your Title IX, a project for Advocates for Youth; Council of Parent \nAttorneys and Advocates, Inc. (“COPAA”); Girls for Gender Equity (“Gender Equity”); \nand  Stop  Sexual  Assault  in  Schools  (“SSAIS”)  (collectively,  “Plaintiffs”)  challenged  the \npromulgation of the Rule.  The Plaintiffs are nonprofits dedicated to eliminating the barriers \ncreated by sexual violence and harassment to equal educational access through education, \nresource and service support, and advocacy on behalf of students who have experienced \nsexual harassment and assault.  (See Compl. For Decl. & Inj. Relief ¶¶ 22-25, ECF No. 1.)  \nThe  Plaintiffs  filed  suit  against  the  ED  and  Secretary  Elisabeth  DeVos  and  Assistant \nSecretary  for Civil  Rights  Kenneth  L.  Marcus,  in  their official capacities, in  May  2020, \narguing  that  the  Rule  “radically  reduced  the  responsibility  of  schools  to  respond  to \ncomplaints of sexual harassment and assault, creating an arbitrary and wholly unexplained \ndisparity between its treatment of sex discrimination on the one hand, and race, national \norigin, and disability discrimination on the other.”  (Compl. For. Decl. & Inj. Relief ¶ 1, ECF \nNo. 1.)   \nThe ED has previously issued various “guidance” explaining how it believed schools \nshould resolve allegations of sexual harassment (including sexual assault).  See, e.g., 66 Fed. \nReg. 5512-01 (Jan. 19, 2001).  In 2014, the ED announced it would engage in rulemaking on \nthe subject.  Dear Colleagues Letter from Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights (Sept. 22, 2017), \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-title-ix-201709.pdf.      The \nED released its proposed rule on November 29, 2018.  83 Fed. Reg. 61,462 (Nov. 29, 2018) \n(NPRM).  The final Rule was released publicly on the ED’s website on May 6, 2020, and it \nwas formally published in the Federal Register on May 19, 2020.  85 Fed. Reg. 30,026 (May \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 43   Filed 10/20/20   Page 4 of 19\n19, 2020).  The Plaintiffs allege that the Rule includes several provisions that are contrary to \nboth the language and spirit of Title IX, and not only depart significantly from consistent \npast  practice,  but  create  a  “double  standard”  in  which  educational  institutions  have \ndramatically different obligations to respond to different forms of discrimination.  (Compl. \nFor. Decl. & Inj. Relief ¶ 11, ECF No. 1.)  The unlawful provisions, the Plaintiffs allege, \ninclude: \na.  Redefining sexual harassment to exclude many instances of misconduct \nthat currently fall within the ED’s definition, and that continue to fall \nunder the ED’s definition of harassment based on race, national origin, \nand disability (34 C.F.R. § 106.30(a)) \n \nb.  Excluding off-campus incidents from the definition of sexual harassment \n(Id. § 106.44(a)) \n \nc.  Limiting  the  category  of  school  officials  who  are  obligated  to  report \nallegations of sexual harassment (Id. § 106.30(a)) \n \nd.  Permitting and in some cases requiring a clear and convincing evidence \nstandard in sexual harassment hearings (Id. § 106.45(b)) \n \ne.  Imposing  a  deliberate  indifference  standard  on  schools  charged  with \npreventing and ending sexual harassment (Id. § 106.2(h)) \n \nThe Plaintiffs complain that these provisions are arbitrary and capricious and an \nabuse of discretion under the APA.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  On July 31, 2020, the Defendant \nfiled a Motion to Dismiss, arguing that all four Plaintiffs lack standing to bring this suit.  (See \nECF No. 34-1.) \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n  Article III of the U.S. Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to actual \n“Cases” and “Controversies.”  U.S. Const. art. III, § 2.  One element of this case and \ncontroversy requirement is that plaintiffs must demonstrate that they have standing to sue.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 43   Filed 10/20/20   Page 5 of 19\nClapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 408 (2013).  Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure permits a defendant to challenge the court’s subject matter jurisdiction over \nthe  plaintiff’s suit.   Under  Rule  12(b)(1),  the plaintiff  bears  the burden of proving,  by \npreponderance of evidence, the existence of subject matter jurisdiction.  See Demetres v. E. W. \nConst., Inc., 776 F.3d 271, 272 (4th Cir. 2015).   \n“A defendant may challenge subject-matter jurisdiction in one of two ways: facially or \nfactually.”  Beck v. McDonald, 848 F.3d 262, 270 (4th Cir. 2017).  A facial challenge involves \nthe  allegation  “that  a  complaint  simply  fails  to  allege  facts  upon  which  subject  matter \njurisdiction can be based.”  Kerns v. United States, 585 F.3d 187, 192 (4th Cir. 2009) (quoting \nAdams v. Bain, 697 F.2d 1213, 1219 (4th Cir. 1982)).  Accordingly, the plaintiff is “afforded \nthe same procedural protection as she would receive under a Rule 12(b)(6) consideration,” \nwherein “the facts alleged in the complaint are taken as true,” and the defendant’s challenge \n“must  be  denied  if  the  complaint  alleges  sufficient  facts  to  invoke  subject  matter \njurisdiction.”    Id.    By  contract,  in  a  factual  challenge,  the  defendant  argues  “that  the \njurisdictional  allegations  of  the  complaint  [are]  not  true,”  providing  the  trial  court  the \ndiscretion to “go beyond the allegations of the complaint and in an evidentiary hearing \ndetermine if there are facts to support the jurisdictional allegations.”  Id. (first alteration in \noriginal)  (quoting  Adams,  697  F.2d  at  1219).    Thus,  with  a  factual  challenge,  “the \npresumption of truthfulness normally accorded a complaint’s allegations does not apply.”  Id.  \nThe Court should only grant a Rule 12(b)(1) motion based on a factual challenge to subject \nmatter jurisdiction if the facts are not in dispute and the moving party is entitled to prevail as \na matter of law.  See Na’tl Fed’n of the Blind v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 407 F. Supp. 3d 524, 530 (D. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 43   Filed 10/20/20   Page 6 of 19\nMd. 2019) (internal citations omitted).  In this case, the Government challenges standing “on \nthe  pleadings,”  therefore  this  Court  will  “accept  as  true  all  material  allegations  of  the \ncomplaint and construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.”  Deal v. Mercer \nCnty. Bd. of Educ., 911 F.3d 183, 187 (4th Cir. 2018). \nANALYSIS \nArticle III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to “Cases” and \n“Controversies.”  U.S. Const. art. III, § 2.  The doctrine of standing gives meaning to these \nconstitutional  limits  by  “identify[ing]  those  disputes  which  are  appropriately  resolved \nthrough the judicial process.”  Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 157 (2014) \n(quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).  “The law of Article III standing, \nwhich is built on separation-of-powers principles, serves to prevent the judicial process from \nbeing used to usurp the powers of the political branches.”  Clapper, 568 U.S. at 408.  To \nestablish Article III standing and invoke federal jurisdiction, a plaintiff must show (1) an \n“injury in fact,” (2) a sufficient “causal connection between the injury and the conduct \ncomplained of,” and (3) a “likelihood” that the injury “will be redressed by a favorable \ndecision.”  Susan B. Anthony List, 157-58 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61).  The party \ninvoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing standing.  Id. at 158.  “[E]ach \nelement must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears \nthe burden of proof, i.e., with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive \nstages of the litigation.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  At the pleading stage, general factual \nallegations of injury resulting from the defendant’s conduct may suffice, for on a motion to \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 43   Filed 10/20/20   Page 7 of 19\ndismiss we “presum[e] that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary \nto support the claim.”  Id. (citing Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 883-89 (1990)). \nThe Court’s standing decisions make clear that “standing is not dispensed in gross.”  \nDavis v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 554 U.S. 724, 734 (2008).  To the contrary, “a plaintiff must \ndemonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press and for each form of relief that is \nsought.”  Id.  However, this does not mean that in the case of multiple plaintiffs, each \nplaintiff must prove his own standing.  “[T]he Supreme Court has made it clear that ‘the \npresence of one party with standing is sufficient to satisfy Article III’s case-or-controversy \nrequirement.’”  Bostic v. Schaefer, 760 F.3d 352, 370 (4th Cir. 2014) (quoting Rumsfeld v. Forum \nfor Acad. & Inst’l Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 52 n.2 (2006)); see also Town of Chester, N.Y. v. Laroe \nEsts., Inc., 137 S. Ct. 1645, 1650-51 (2017); Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, 445 (2009) (quoting \nSummers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 491-94) (“Here, as in all standing inquires, the \ncritical question is whether at least one petitioner has ‘alleged such a personal stake in the \noutcome of the controversy as to warrant his invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.’”).  \nTherefore, in this case, this Court must find at least one plaintiff with standing in order for \nthe Plaintiffs’ case to survive the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.  If it does so, this Court \nneed not analyze Defendants’ arguments regarding the remaining Plaintiffs.  See Am. Coll. of \nObstetricians & Gynecologists v. U.S. Food & Drug Admin., 2020 WL 3960625, at *8 (D. Md. July \n13, 2020) (analyzing only whether one plaintiff has standing). \nThere are two specific types of standing relevant to this case: organizational standing \nand associational standing.  Organizational standing provides that an organization may claim \nstanding in its own right by adequately alleging the standing requirements as they apply to \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 43   Filed 10/20/20   Page 8 of 19\nindividuals, namely that the organization itself has suffered an injury in fact that is fairly \ntraceable to the challenged action of the defendant and is likely redressable by a favorable \ndecision  from  the  court.    S.  Walk  at  Broadlands  Homeowner’s  Ass’n,  Inc.  v.  OpenBand  at \nBroadlands,  LLC,  713  F.3d  175,  182  (4th  Cir.  2013).    By  contrast,  associational  standing \n(sometimes called “representational standing”) allows an organization to establish standing \n“only as [a] representative[ ] of [its] members who have been injured in fact, and thus could \nhave brought suit in their own right.”  Id. at 183-84 (quoting Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rts., 426 \nU.S. 26, 40 (1976)).  To plead associational standing: \nan organization must allege that ‘(1) its own members would have standing to \nsue in their own right; (2) the interests the organization seeks to protect are \ngermane to the organization’s purpose; and (3) neither the claim nor the relief \nsought requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.’ \n \nId. at 184 (quoting Summers, 555 U.S. at 498).  The Supreme Court has clarified that to show \nthat  its  members  would  have  standing,  an  organization  must  “make  specific  allegations \nestablishing that at least one identified member had suffered or would suffer harm.”  Summers, \n555 U.S. at 498.   \nThree  of  the  Plaintiffs  in  this  case  have  no  independent  Article  III  standing.  \nSpecifically, COPAA, Gender Equity, and SSAIS have no independent Article III standing \nand  must  look  to  the  standing  of  Know  Your  Title  IX.    That  lead  Plaintiff  has  not \nadequately alleged facts to establish its standing to bring this action. \nI.  Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, Inc. (“COPAA”) \nCOPAA is a nonprofit membership organization that aims to protect and enforce the \nlegal and civil rights of students with disabilities and their families.  (Compl. For Decl. & Inj. \nRelief  ¶  23,  ECF  No.  1.)  Through the  provision of  education,  training,  and  technical \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 43   Filed 10/20/20   Page 9 of 19\nassistance to professionals and laypersons, COPAA works to secure high-quality educational \nservices  for  students  with  disabilities  and  to  promote  excellence  in  special  education \nadvocacy.  (Id.)  Some of COPAA’s attorneys and advocate members represent complainants \nand respondents, including students with disabilities, in Title IX processes.  (Id.)   \nCOPAA alleges associational standing, arguing that it has standing as an organization \non the basis of its representation of one of its members, who was injured in fact and, \ntherefore, could have brought suit in her own right.  (Id. at ¶¶ 131-34.)  The Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint alleges generally that COPAA’s members who advocate on behalf of students will \nbe injured by challenged provisions of the Rule.  (Id. at ¶ 131.)  The Complaint then points \nto a specific member of COPAA, a Michigan attorney later identified as Elizabeth Abdnour, \nwho joined COPAA in 2018.  (Id.)  COPAA provides that Ms. Abdnour’s “private practice \nprimarily entails representing K-12 and college students, as well as higher education staff and \nfaculty, in Title IX proceedings and advocating on behalf of K-12 special education students \nseeking services in their public schools.”  The Complaint alleges that because changes in the \nRule will cause student complaints to face “more hurdles and be less likely to succeed,” this \nattorney will have fewer administrative complaints to file, and the cases she does pursue “will \nbe more difficult and take more time to resolve.”  (Id. at ¶ 132.)  The Complaint further \nalleges that the changes to the Rule will “reduce clients’ incentives to pursue administrative \nrelief,” forcing Ms. Abdnour to focus her efforts on seeking relief in court. (Id. at ¶ 133.)  \nThese changes will demand from the attorney “increased time and resources” and prohibit \nher from taking as many cases.  (Id. at ¶ 133-34.)  The Defendants argue that Ms. Abdnour \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 43   Filed 10/20/20   Page 10 of 19\nwould lack standing in her own right, and, therefore, COPAA lacks standing as well.  (ECF \nNo. 34-1 at 20.)  This Court agrees.   \nFirst, the Plaintiff’s theory is too speculative and does not establish an “actual or \nimminent” injury.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  It relies on numerous assumptions, including how \nmany clients will seek her services; what sorts of claims such individuals might have; and \nhow expensive or difficult the cases she gets may be.  Further, even if COPAA’s predictions \nabout the effect on Ms. Abdnour’s personal legal practice are correct, COPAA’s argument \nseems to “hinge[ ] on an attorney’s desire to assist her clients in a regulatory environment \nthat she prefers.”  (See ECF No. 34-1 at 20.)  Attorneys do not suffer a recognizable injury in \nfact  under  Article  III  whenever  the  law  causes  changes  to  their  docket  or  “they  take \nmeasures  to  protect  their  clients’  rights  or  alter  their  litigation  strategy  amid  legal \nuncertainty.”  Habeas Corpus Res. Ctr. v. U.S. Dep’t of Just., 816 F.3d 1241, 1250 (9th Cir. 2016).   \nAdditionally, even if COPAA’s claim for injury is instead characterized as economic, \nrather than merely a shift in the difficulty or composition of the attorney’s law practice, the \ninjury remains speculative, as well as outside the zone of interests that Congress sought to \nprotect in Title IX.  Under the APA, a plaintiff must show that she is either “suffering a legal \nwrong because of agency action” or “adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within \nthe meaning of a relevant statute.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  A party claiming the latter, such as \nCOPAA  here, must establish  that  the injury it complains  of  “falls  within the  ‘zone of \ninterests’ sought to be protected by the statutory provisions whose violation forms the legal \nbasis  for  his  complaint.”    Lujan,  497  U.S.  at  883.   As  the  Plaintiffs  recognize  in  their \nComplaint,  Congress’s  goals  in  enacting  Title  IX  were  to  (1)  avoid  the  use  of  federal \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 43   Filed 10/20/20   Page 11 of 19\nresources to support discriminatory practices and (2) provide individual citizens effective \nprotection against those practices.  (Compl. For Decl. & Inj. Relief ¶ 17.)  Congress was not \nconcerned with the revenue flow of private attorneys.  An attorney does not gain standing \nany time a change in the law causes her legal practice to shift or become less lucrative.  Ms. \nAbdnour does not have a recognizable injury in fact under Article III that would allow her to \nbring suit in her own right, and therefore, neither does COPAA. \nII.  Girls for Gender Equity (“Gender Equity”) \nGender Equity is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation founded to create opportunities \nfor,  and  to  remove  systematic  barriers  from,  the  development  of  girls  (cisgender  and \ntransgender) and non-binary youth of color.  (Compl. For Decl. & Inj. Relief ¶ 24, ECF No. \n1.)  It carries out this mission through direct service, policy advocacy and organizing, and \ncultural change.  (Id.)  Gender Equity claims to have organizational standing to bring this suit.  \nThe Complaint provides that: \n[g]iven the diminished responsibility under federal law for schools to respond \nto reports of sexual harassment and assault under the challenged provisions of \nthe final Rule, [Gender Equity] will need to dedicate additional staff time and \nresources to advocate at the local and state levels for measures that are proven \nto prevent the occurrence of sexual harassment and assault . . . . \n \n(Id. at ¶ 138.)  In other words, Gender Equity seems to claim that because the Rule is bad \npolicy, it will have to spend more of its time and resources lobbying to have this policy \nchanged.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has rejected this type of \nclaim. \nIn in Lane v. Holder, 703 F.3d 668, 671 (4th Cir. 2012), a gun-rights organization \nwhose activities included  advocacy  as  well  as  “education, research,  publishing  and  legal \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 43   Filed 10/20/20   Page 12 of 19\naction,” challenged a federal firearm statue.  The group alleged that it had suffered an Article \nIII injury because it needed to divert resources in order to help its members navigate the \nnew law, and thus could not spend those funds on other goals.  Id.  The Fourth Circuit held \nthat voluntary “budgetary choices” are not cognizable injuries under Article III.  Id. at 675.  \n“To determine that an organization that decides to spend its money on educating members, \nresponding to members’ inquiries, or undertaking litigation in response to legislation suffers \na  cognizable  injury  would  be  to  imply  standing  for  organizations  with  merely  ‘abstract \nconcern[s] with a subject that could be affected by an adjudication.’”  Id. (quoting Simon v. E. \nKy. Welfare Rts. Org., 426 U.S. 26 40 (1976)).   \nIn CASA de Maryland, Inc. v. Trump, 971 F.3d 220, 238-41 (4th Cir. 2020) the Fourth \nCircuit examined Lane and held that a voluntary reallocation of resources is insufficient to \nestablish organizational standing.  The Fourth Circuit, “to put a finer point on it,” explained \nthat “it is not relevant for Article III purposes whether [the plaintiff] felt moved to act in a \nparticular manner.”  Id. at 238.  As the Court found, “[m]any statutes and regulations may \nspur private organizations to react to them in some fashion.”  Id. at 239 (citing Lujan, 504 \nU.S. at 561-62).  “[A] voluntary budgetary decision, however well-intentioned, does not \nconstitute Article III injury, in no small part because holding otherwise would give carte \nblanche for any organization to ‘manufacture standing by choosing to make expenditures’ \nabout its public policy of choice.”  Id. (quoting Clapper, 568 U.S. at 402).  Even if Gender \nEquity’s decision to expend more resources to advocate against the ED’s new policies is \nwell-intentioned, it is still a voluntary spending decision that does not create a recognizable \ninjury in fact under Article III.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 43   Filed 10/20/20   Page 13 of 19\nIn  support  of  their  claim  for  injury,  the  Plaintiffs  cite  this  Court’s  decision  in \nKnowledge Ecology Int’l v. Nat’l Insts. of Health, 2019 WL 1585285 (D. Md. Apr. 11, 2019).  In \nthat case, Judge Messitte of this Court did in dicta note that a “diversion of resources away \nfrom the organization’s primary mission in order to address an allegedly improper action \nmay suffice to establish standing.”  Id. at *4.  However, as in this case, the plaintiffs, like \nGender Equity, could not show such injury.  The plaintiffs argued that they had expended \nresources  on their  suit against  the defendant, National  Institute  of  Health, to  advocate \nagainst a private license granted by the organization.  Id. at *6.  This Court held that such \ninjury  was  “the  very  type  of  manufactured  injury  that  is  not  recognized  for  standing \npurposes.”  Id.  Judge Messitte continued, explaining that the plaintiff’s “core purpose” as an \norganization was “pursuing precisely the type of advocacy it undertook” and that resources \nspent on litigating the case in front of the court were “very much in line with [the plaintiff’s] \ncore mission rather than a diversion of resources away from it.”  Id. \nThe same is true in the case at hand.  Gender Equity claims that its core mission is \ncarried  out  through  policy  advocacy.    If  this  Court  were  to  allow  a  party  whose \norganizational mission is to engage in policy advocacy to claim injury on the basis of a need \nto engage in that exact activity, any advocacy group could find standing to challenge laws \nwhen there are changes in policy.  To hold in such way would be contradictory to Knowledge \nEcology International, as well as the longstanding principle that the doctrine of standing limits \nthe  jurisdiction  of  the  courts  by  “identify[ing]  those  disputes  which  are  appropriately \nresolved through the judicial process.”  Susan B. Anthony List, 573 U.S. at 157.  Gender \nEquity’s alleged injury is “no more than a mere disagreement with the policy decisions” of \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 43   Filed 10/20/20   Page 14 of 19\nthe ED, Md. Shall Issue, Inc. v. Hogan, 963 F.3d 356, 362 (4th Cir. 2020), and therefore, is \ninsufficient to provide Gender Equity with standing to bring this suit. \nIII.  Stop Sexual Assault in Schools (“SSAIS”) \nSSAIS is a nonprofit education and advocacy organization.  (Compl. For Decl. & Inj. \nRelief ¶ 25, ECF No. 1.)  Its mission is to prevent sexual harassment and assault in K-12 \nschools  by  educating  students,  families,  and  schools  about  K-12  students’  right  to  an \neducation free from sex discrimination.  (Id.)  SSAIS’s claims are similar to that of Gender \nEquity.  The Complaint alleges that “[f]ollowing issuance of the Rule, SSAIS must now \ndedicate a substantial amount of time to analyzing the Rule . . . , assessing existing or needed \nstate or local parallel protections to fill in gaps created by the challenged provisions of the \nRule,  recreating  educational  materials,  and  providing  technical  assistance  to  students, \nfamilies, educators, and journalists.”  (Id. at ¶ 138.)  SSAIS claims that such “diversion of \nresources” will cause SSAIS to “lack the capacity and time to pursue projects it had planned \nto accomplish in 2020.”  (Id.)  It also claims that because of the “confusing and contradictory \npolicy landscape” created by the Rule, it will have to update its informational and training \nmaterials and “engage in the resource-draining task of recreating itself as an expert in state \nand local policies.”  (ECF No. 38 at 33.)   \nAgain, this Court finds the Plaintiffs’ arguments to be in conflict with CASA de \nMaryland.  As the Fourth Circuit held, “it is not relevant for Article III purposes whether [the \nplaintiff] felt moved to act in a particular manner.”  CASA, 971 F.3d at 238.  SSAIS’s \nresource reallocations, although they may be motivated by sincere policy preferences, “are \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 43   Filed 10/20/20   Page 15 of 19\nnot  cognizable  organizational  injuries  because  no  action  by  the  defendant  has  directly \nimpaired the organization’s ability to operate and to function.”  Id. at 239. \nAdditionally, even if SSAIS could allege some recognizable injury, it cannot show \nhow such injury was caused by the ED’s alleged violation of the APA, or how it “will be \nredressed by a favorable decision.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  SSAIS’s argument is that it has \nsuffered injury by having to read the Rule and tell people what it says.  Even if the ED had \nissued a Rule that SSAIS preferred, it presumably would still need to “dedicate a substantial \namount of time to analyzing the Rule . . . , assessing existing or needed state or local parallel \nprotections  .  .  . ,  recreating  educational  materials, and  providing technical  assistance  to \nstudents, families, educators, and journalists.”   (Id. at ¶ 138.)   Further, if the ED’s policies \nwere to change as a result of this litigation, SSAIS would then presumably have to once again \nedit its materials in order to accommodate the changes.  Any alleged violations of the APA \nare not the legal cause of SSAIS’s alleged injury.  See Comcast Corp. v. Nat’l Ass’n of Af. Am.-\nOwned Media, 140 S. Ct. 1009, 1014 (2020) (describing but-for causation as the idea that “a \nplaintiff must demonstrate that, but for the defendant’s unlawful conduct, its alleged injury \nwould not have occurred”).  There is no remedy this Court can provide to redress SSAIS’s \nharm.  SSAIS lacks Article III standing to bring this suit.   \nIV.  Know Your Title IX \nPlaintiff  Know  Your  Title  IX  is  a  survivor-and-youth  project  of  Advocates  for \nYouth.  (See Compl. For Decl. & Inj. Relief ¶ 22, ECF No. 1.)  The organization’s goal is “to  \nempower  high  school  and  college  students  to  end  sexual  and  dating  violence  in  their \nschools”  through  “legal  rights  education;  training,  organizing,  and  supporting  student-\n15 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 43   Filed 10/20/20   Page 16 of 19\nsurvivor activists; and advocating for campus, state, and federal policy change.”  (Id.)   Like \nGender Equity and SSAIS, Know Your Title IX argues that it has organizational standing, \nclaiming that the injury it has suffered is one to Know Your Title IX itself.  (See ECF No. 38 \nat 18.)  Know Your Title IX claims that “[t]he Rule’s provisions directly frustrate Know \nYour Title IX’s mission.”  (Id.)  The organization claims that the Rule depresses the number \nof survivors who can access Title IX remedies.  (Id. at 18-19.)  For example, Know Your \nTitle IX claims that the Rule reduces the number and types of conduct or events that may be \ninvestigated by schools in Title IX proceedings through both its narrowed definition of \n“sexual harassment” and effective exclusion of off-campus incidents.  (Id.)  Therefore, the \nPlaintiffs’ claim, the Rule reduces the number of survivors who will be eligible for remedies \nto help them complete their education that are only available through these proceedings.  \n(Id.)    Know  Your  Title  IX  alleges  that  because  of  the  resulting  overall  reduction  in \ncomplaints, the Rule’s provisions “stand in the way of Know Your Title IX’s . . . goal of \nbringing greater attention to survivors’ actual experiences and ensur[ing] their stories are not \nburied.”  (Id.)   \nIn sum, Know Your Title IX alleges that the Rule runs “at cross-purpose” with the \norganization’s objectives.  (Id.)  This general conflict allegedly inflicts practical harm on \nKnow Your Title IX’s work as an organization.  Know Your Title IX claims that the Rule \n“requires” the organization to make fundamental changes in the way it prepares students to \nengage in school-based advocacy and to support survivors, and accordingly, that Know Your \nTitle IX will have to redraft documents and training plans, which  will require “a huge \nreallocation of staff time and budget, away from activities it had planned to embark on this \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 43   Filed 10/20/20   Page 17 of 19\nyear.”  (Id. at 20.)  It is true that an organization like Know Your Title IX “may suffer an \ninjury in fact when a defendant’s actions impede its efforts to carry out its mission.”  CASA, \n971 F.3d at 237 (citing Lane, 703 F.3d at 674).  However, again, this Court finds that the \nPlaintiffs’ arguments are rejected under Lane and CASA de Maryland.  The Fourth Circuit has \nsquarely held that “[r]esource reallocations motivated by the dictates of preference, however \nsincere, are not cognizable organizational injuries because no action by the defendant has \ndirectly impaired the organization’s ability to operate and to function.”  Id. at 239.   \nKnow Your  Title IX  does attempt to distinguish its own case from that of the \nplaintiffs in Lane and CASA de Maryland.  In the Complaint, Know Your Title IX alleges that \nin anticipation of the Rule, it received a “spike in training requests” for Spring 2020, and \nfurther, that it “expects the number of calls and training requests to increase further now \nthat the Rule has been released.”  (Compl. For Decl. & Inj. Relief ¶ 126, ECF No. 1.)  This \nclaim differs slightly from their other arguments related to Know Your Title IX’s frustration \nof purpose and general voluntary spending changes, but as presently alleged,  Know Your \nTitle  IX  has  not  sufficiently  alleged  any  facts  that  reflect  and  support  an  increased \nexpenditure of resources as a result of the promulgation of the Rule.   \nIn SurvJustice Inc. v. DeVos, No. 18-cv-00535-JSC, 2018 WL 4770741, at *4 (N.D. Cal. \nOct. 1, 2018), order amended on reconsideration, No. 18-CV-00535-JSC, 2010 WL 1434144 (N.D. \nCal. Mar. 29, 2019), the plaintiffs were three non-profit advocacy organizations and, like \nKnow Your Title IX, claimed that an ED action would require a diversion of resources that \nwould impede their various daily operations and frustrate their organizational missions.  The \ncourt  did  find  standing  on  such  grounds.    Id.  at  *6.    The  plaintiffs  argued  that,  as \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 43   Filed 10/20/20   Page 18 of 19\norganizations that advocated for survivors of sexual harassment, a “chilling effect” on the \nfiling of sexual harassment and sexual violence complaints made it increasingly difficult for \nthem to fulfill their organizational missions.  Id.  While the defendants in SurvJustice argued \nthat this chilling effect was merely “subjective” and “speculative,” the court noted that the \nallegations were instead “observed”—the Plaintiffs produced details of decreases in the filing \nof student complaints   Id.  The plaintiffs further alleged that, when asked, their clients \ndirectly attributed their hesitancy in filing to the ED action at issue.  Id.   \nIn this case, Know Your Title IX has not alleged the same observable change in \nresponse to the Rule.  The Plaintiffs have not provided any details about the number or \nnature of the pre-Rule requests (Compl. For Decl. & Inj. Relief ¶ 125, ECF No. 1), nor \nwhether the alleged increase occurred as expected (Id. at ¶ 126).  At this point, Know Your \nTitle IX’s concerns about an increase in the number of calls and training requests that it will \nreceive in reaction to the Rule are merely speculative.  While the Supreme Court has held \nthat “threatened injuries” may be sufficient to meet the requirements for injury in fact under \nArticle III, Clapper, 568 U.S. at 408, the Supreme Court has also been clear that such threats \nmust  be  “certainly  impending”  in  order  to  “ensure  that  the  alleged  injury  is  not  too \nspeculative for Article III purposes,” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564 n.2.  Know Your Title IX has \nnot yet sufficiently alleged any uptick in calls in response to the Rule.  Furthermore, under \nthe Fourth Circuit’s decisions in Lane and CASA de Maryland, it would still need to show \ncausation, namely, how such uptick would cause an involuntary reallocation of resources and \nthat the ED’s actions “ha[ve] directly impaired the organization’s ability to operate and to \nfunction.”  CASA, 971 F.3d at 239.   \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01224-RDB   Document 43   Filed 10/20/20   Page 19 of 19\nKnow Your Title IX’s standing theory grounded in the frustration of its mission and \ndiversion of resources cannot create standing for all the Plaintiffs because it is insufficient at \nthis time to meet the injury in fact requirement for Article III standing.  Know Your Title IX \nhas not demonstrated that the Rule forced the organization to take action as a matter of law.  \nIts  “unilateral  and  uncompelled  response  to  the  shifting  needs  of  its  members  cannot \nmanufacture an Article III injury.”  See id. at 238. \nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  reasons  stated  above,  the  Motion  to  Intervene  by  Intervenor \nDefendants Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, Independent Women’s \nLaw  Center,  and  Speech  First,  Inc.  (ECF  No.  20)  is  DENIED  AS  MOOT.  \nDefendants’  Motion  to  Dismiss  (ECF  No.  34)  is  GRANTED  and  this  case  is \nDISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
