Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sued the governor and secretary of state of Connecticut under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, alleging violations of their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The plaintiffs challenged two Connecticut laws: the Ballot Access law, which required candidates to collect in-person signatures to access the ballot for the August 11, 2020 primary elections, and the Absentee Ballot law, which required in-person voting, allowing for mail-in absentee voting for few exceptions. The plaintiffs alleged that Connecticut's ballot access law (\"Ballot Access\") was unsafe and impossible amid a pandemic and that Connecticut's absentee ballot law (\"Absentee Ballot\") inappropriately restricted access to the voting process and treated similarly situated voters differently. The case was assigned to Judge Janet C. Hall.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on May 12, adding two named plaintiffs and including the governor's newly issued Executive Order No. 7LL, arguing that although the order addressed the Ballot Access claim, it did not solve the constitutional deficiencies. That same day, they filed a motion for preliminary or permanent injunction with respect to their Ballot Access claim.</p>\r\n<p>On May 18, the plaintiffs moved to certify the class as to the Ballot Access claim.</p>\r\n<p>The Democratic State Central Committee moved to intervene on June 1 and on June 2, the defendants and the proposed intervenors separately filed memoranda in opposition to the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.</p>",

INTRODUCTION \n \nThe State of Connecticut has a compelling state interest in conducting orderly, fair, and \ntransparent elections.  Eu v. San Francisco Democratic Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 233 (1989).  To \nachieve this state interest it may craft regulations that maintain electoral integrity, minimize voter \nconfusion at the ballot box, maintain the integrity of petition circulation, maintain the stability of \nits political parties, discourage party splintering and factionalism, discourage cross party raiding \nand manipulation, and ensure electoral finality. Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 730 (1974) \n(noting “substantial regulation” of elections is necessary to ensure they are fair, honest, and \norderly); see also Castine v. Zurlo, 756 F.3d 171, 177 (2d Cir. 2014); Lerman v. Bd. of Elections \nof City of New York, 232 F.3d 135, 151 (2d Cir. 2000).   \nNotwithstanding  these  compelling  state  interests,  the  State’s  ability  to  advance  its \ninterests  is  not  limitless  and  must  balance  against  the  rights  of  individuals  and  political \norganizations.  When the State seeks to regulate the internal operations of a political party, as, for \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 2 of 33\nexample, Connecticut regulates the Connecticut state branches of the Democratic and Republican \nparties by, inter alia, requiring those parties hold primary elections, it must do so in a manner \nthat respects their First Amendment associational rights and that of its individual members.  This \nis because political parties are comprised of like-minded individuals who seek to associate to \nadvance political speech and policy goals and, therefore, have their own independent First \nAmendment rights.  Eu, 489 U.S. at 224.  The party’s selection of its preferred standard bearer is \nat the core of these associational rights.  Id., at 223-225 (ban on party endorsements affects \nspeech at the core of the electoral process).  Thus, states’ regulation of a party’s nomination of \ncandidates cannot exceed what is necessary to ensure “fair and orderly” elections.  Id., at 233.  \nMoreover, the state need not, and ought not, seek to protect the political parties from themselves, \nincluding by making their party selection process more open.  The membership of a political \nparty is fully capable of reaching those decisions on their own terms. \nHere, the State of Connecticut has sought to advance its interest in a fair and orderly \nmajor party candidate selection process by permitting no less than three opportunities for a \ncandidate to gain the party’s nomination.  Exhibit 1, Bromley Decl. ¶11.  This process has the \napproval of the parties themselves and, in the case of the Democratic Party, is a direct reflection \nof the party’s own written party rules.  Bromley Decl. ¶8, Exhibit A (Democratic Party Rules).  \nPlaintiffs — three current or former Democratic candidates for office Andy Gottlieb, Jason W. \nBartlett, and Richard Lacourciere (collectively “Plaintiff Candidates”) and the former campaign \ntreasurer  for  Mr.  Gottlieb,  Lorna  Chand  —  seek  the  extraordinary  relief  of  a  preliminary \ninjunction mandating further State encroachment upon the parties’ First Amendment rights to \nselect their candidate in the manner they prefer and control.  See ECF No. 8, Plaintiffs’ First \nAmended Class Action Complaint for Declaratory & Injunctive Relief (“Compl.”), pp.16-17, \n2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 3 of 33\nECF No. 9, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary or Permanent Injunctive & Declaratory Relief as \nto First Claim (Ballot Access) (“Motion for PI”), p.3.  Such relief, even if available over the \nobjection of the political parties, one of whom has sought intervention, ECF No. 26, Connecticut \nDemocratic State Central Committee’s Motion to Intervene as Defendant (“Democrats’ Motion \nto Intervene”), is both foreclosed by controlling U.S. Supreme Court precedent, New York State \nBd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U.S. 196 (2008) (“Lopez Torres”) and not even required \nunder any measure of fairness.  Major party challengers in Connecticut have a fair opportunity to \nbecome the major party standard bearer in the November general election under the current \nsystem; indeed, they have ample opportunity.  The State’s overall statutory scheme, which is the \nproper context in which to assess this third petitioning option, LaRouche v. Kezer, 990 F.2d 36 \n(2d Cir. 1993), provides candidates several paths to the party’s nomination.  First, a candidate \ncan seek the endorsement at the convention, and if they cannot achieve that goal they have two \nmore chances to override the party endorsement through a showing of 15% support among \ndelegates at the convention or garnering signatures of as few as 9 enrolled party members in a \ndistrict.  Bromley Decl. ¶¶10-11, 34-36.  That these Plaintiffs fail to capitalize on these multiple \navenues to ballot access, or build the requisite support among their fellow party members, does \nnot render Connecticut’s primary system unconstitutional and certainly does not satisfy the \nextremely high bar for mandatory injunction relief in the midst of an election cycle.  \nConnecticut’s three paths to the major party’s nomination: 1) win the endorsement at the \nconvention; 2) win the support of at least 15% of the delegates at the convention; 3) petition on \nthe ballot with the signatures of only 5% of the enrolled party members in the candidate’s \ndistrict,    Bromley  Decl.  ¶10-11,  is  so  generous  that  it  alone  could  be  dispositive  of  any \nconstitutional inquiry.  However, the constitutional inquiry is made even simpler by Supreme \n3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 4 of 33\nCourt precedent directly on point.  The Supreme Court has held that the State is not required to \ntreat a challenger candidate as favorably as Connecticut does.  Neither the State nor the parties \nare constitutionally required to provide a candidate with the fullest opportunity to win a party’s \nnomination or even a “realistic chance,” Lopez Torres, 552 U.S. at 204–205, these matters are \nlargely within the purview of the parties and the individuals who set their internal rules, often by \nvote.  See Kozin Decl. ¶12. \nAlthough perhaps Connecticut could mandate the system Plaintiffs seek, and that is \nhardly a given considering the objection of the political parties, ECF No. 26, Democrats’ Motion \nto Intervene, that “is a far cry from saying that the Constitution demands it.”  Lopez Torres, 552 \nU.S.  at  204-205.    Even  though  a  “fair  shot”  at  winning  the  party’s  nomination  is  not \nconstitutionally required, id., Connecticut’s overall electoral scheme nonetheless provides it.  It \neven, for many candidates, including Mr. Bartlett, Bromley Decl. ¶22, funds their political \nspeech with taxpayer money once they have attained ballot access for the primary.  Conn. Gen. \nStat. §§ 9-700 to 9-759 (Citizens’ Election Program). \nThe COVID-19 public health crisis does not alter the analysis and it certainly does not \ncompel this Court to step in to impose a primary ballot access requirement more lenient than that \napproved by the parties or required by the State.  Having already considered the burden imposed \non candidates by the public health crisis, the State determined that it was appropriate to reduce \nthe number of signatures required for primary ballot access by 30%  and permit electronic \ncirculation, collection, and submission of petitions by candidates, which it accomplished by \nexecutive order.  The parties have not objected to this relaxation of the rules applicable to them.  \nKozin  Decl.  ¶15.    Indeed,  they  have  sought  intervention  to  defend  Connecticut’s  electoral \nscheme and the Executive Order.  ECF No. 26, Democrats’ Motion to Intervene. \n4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 5 of 33\nEven if the State were required to facilitate a candidate’s “fair shot” at winning the \nparty’s nomination, which it is not, any assertion that the accommodations provided by the State \nin the Executive Order are insufficient is speculative at this point.  Plaintiffs have not provided \nany evidence to this Court that they have attempted to gather a single signature using the \nadditional methods now permitted or of their efforts at the convention to gain the endorsement or \nthe support of 15% of the delegates.  Plaintiffs bear the burden in this case and on this motion.  \nEven if Lopez Torres did not foreclose Plaintiffs’ claims, they would still have to meet the high \nbar of a clear and substantial showing that the overall electoral scheme severely burdens their \nability to gain access to the ballot.  Their incomplete and speculative factual record renders such \na conclusion inappropriate. \nThe petitioning process is not a stand-alone path to the ballot but is part of an integrated \nstatutory scheme.  See LaRouche v. Kezer, 990 F.2d at 39.  As noted, the major parties in \nConnecticut afford candidates three avenues to appear on the ballot.  Prior to even ascertaining \nwhether any of the Plaintiff Candidates would be able to attain ballot access via the more direct \navenues, Plaintiffs brought this action challenging the validity of the third, and final, avenue to \nprimary ballot access- petitioning.  Indeed, candidates for state and district office could not even \nrequest primary petitioning forms until May 26, 2020 — two weeks after Plaintiffs filed their \nMotion for Preliminary Injunctive Relief with this Court.  Bromley Decl. ¶12.  As such, the \nCourt has no basis to conclude that a candidate could not successfully attain primary ballot \naccess in Connecticut in 2020.   \n  Given the right of the Democratic Party to establish its own requirements for attaining the \nparty’s nomination, the multiple ways in which Plaintiffs could gain ballot access for a major \nparty, and the failure of Plaintiffs to provide more than cursory speculation as to the difficulty of \n5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 6 of 33\nsatisfying their party’s requirements, Plaintiffs have not established at this time that they are \nentitled to the extraordinary relief of an injunction preventing the operation a provision of \nConnecticut’s  overall  electoral  scheme  that  facilitates  orderly  and  fraud  free  elections  and \nrespects the major parties’ right to determine which candidates best represent the platform of the \nparty and should appear on the ballot under the party banner.  Lopez Torres, 552 U.S. at 204–\n205, Almontaser v. New York City Dep't of Educ., 519 F.3d 505, 508 (2d Cir. 2008). \nII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n \nA.  CONNECTICUT’S OVERALL ELECTORAL SCHEME AFFORDS MAJOR \nPARTY CANDIDATES MULTIPLE WAYS TO ATTAIN ACCESS TO THE \nPRIMARY BALLOT. \nConnecticut’s overall election scheme is generous, as are the rules of the major parties, \nincluding  those  provisions  that  apply  to  primary  ballot  access  for  major  party  challenger \ncandidates.  That the State and the parties set the bar so far below the constitutional minimum \nshould not be used as a sword to require them to make the third path to the nomination even \neasier.  In 2018 there were Democratic primaries for 26 offices and Republican primaries for 15 \noffices, with a combined total of 49 candidates qualifying for primary ballot access without \nreceiving their party’s endorsement.  Bromley Decl. ¶17, Exhibit D (Table 2- 2016 & 2018 \nPrimary History).  Of those candidates, 18 attained ballot access through the petitioning process.  \nId. at ¶18, Exhibit D.  In the six prior election years, 2006-2016, the number of primaries ranged \nfrom 17 to 47, with the vast majority of primaries held for the Democratic Party.  Bromley Decl., \nExhibits D,  E (Table 3- Primary  History 2006-2014).   This is a  far  cry from the  “highly \ndoubtful” primary ballot access system that Plaintiffs attempt to portray to this Court.   ECF No. \n9-1, Pl. Br., p.3. \nAlthough the major parties are in many respects self-governing, the requirements for \ncandidates to attain ballot access are codified in Connecticut’s statutes.  Pursuant to statute, a \n6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 7 of 33\ncandidate seeking to run for state or district office under the banner of a major party has three \navenues to attain ballot access, each requiring a different showing of support among party \nmembers for the candidate: 1) party endorsement, 2) 15% of delegate votes, or 3) petitioning.  \nBromley Decl. ¶11, Kozin Decl. ¶2.  \nMajor parties in Connecticut are given flexibility in their ability to organize at the local \nlevel with some, usually in larger municipalities, electing town committees and others using \ncaucuses.  Bromley Decl. ¶4, Exhibits A (Democratic Party Rules), B (Republican Party Rules); \nKozin Decl. ¶4 (Democratic Party requires town committees for all municipalities).  In turn, \nthose town committees and caucuses select delegates to nominating conventions for state and \ndistrict offices.1  Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 9-390, 9-391, Kozin Decl. ¶5.  For the 2020 election, \nselection of delegates to state and district conventions were made by party town committees or \ncaucuses between March 24 and March 31, 2020, and certification of such selections were \nrequired to be delivered to the town clerks no later than April 1, 2020.  Bromley Decl. ¶9.  It is \nthose delegates to whom the local major party members entrust selection of which candidates \nwill best represent the party on the ballot.  Id. at ¶10, Kozin Decl. ¶5,6.   \nIn light of the role that nominating convention delegates play in selecting the major \nparties’ standard bearers, it is no surprise that the primary path to ballot access for most major \nparty candidates is party endorsement at a nominating convention.  Kozin Decl. ¶9.  To be \nendorsed by a major party for a state or district office, a candidate must secure a majority of the \n \n1 The ballot access rules in Connecticut vary based on whether the office represents a single town \n(municipal office) or all or part of multiple towns (district office).  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-372.  \nParty endorsements for municipal office are made at a town level by the party town committee or \nby a caucus of enrolled party members in the town, which were required to be held between May \n19 and May 26, 2020.  Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 9-390, 9-391.  Due to the differences in nominating \nprocedure, candidates for municipal office must either secure the party endorsement or petition \nfor ballot access.  None of the Plaintiff Candidates, however, are attempting to attain ballot \naccess for municipal office. \n7 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 8 of 33\nvotes of the party delegates at a state or district nominating convention, which were required to \nbe held between May 5 and May 26, 2020 for this election cycle.  Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 9-382, 9-\n383, Kozin Decl. ¶7.  Certifications of party endorsement must be filed with the Secretary of the \nState within 14 days of the nominating convention.  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-388, Kozin Decl. ¶8.  If \nno other candidate attains access to the primary ballot, the endorsed candidate appears on the \nballot for the general election.  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-416.  \nRespecting the fact that nominating convention delegates may not be unanimous in their \nendorsement of a candidate, a candidate for state or district office who fails to garner enough \nsupport to achieve party endorsement may still appear on the August primary ballot if they make \na modest showing of support from those selected by their party to nominate candidates.  Kozin \nDecl. ¶¶6, 7, 10.  To do so, a candidate must garner 15% of the votes of convention delegates in \nany roll call vote on endorsement of a candidate for the office sought.   Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-400, \nKozin Decl. ¶10.  A candidate must file a signed certification with the Secretary of the State with \nan attestation by the presiding officer or secretary of the convention that the candidate received \n15% of the votes within 14 days of the convention.  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-400. \nFinally, even if a candidate is not the endorsed candidate, and cannot garner a modest \nshowing of support from the delegates to a state or district nominating convention, the candidate \nmay attain primary ballot access if they can evidence a sufficient showing of support from their \nenrolled party members at large.  To make such a showing the candidate must petition for \nprimary ballot access.  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-400, Kozin Decl. ¶11.  For United States Congress, \nthe petition signature requirement is 2% of enrolled party members in the district.  Conn. Gen. \nStat. § 9-400.  For the remaining offices on the 2020 ballot, other than United States President, \n8 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 9 of 33\nthe petition signature requirement is 5% of the enrolled party members in the district or town.2  \nConn. Gen. Stat. § 9-400.  The first day that candidates may seek petition forms coincides with \nthe final day for nominating conventions, May 26, 2020.  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-404a.  Candidates \nhave 14 days, until June 9, 2020, to secure signatures and file their petitions with the registrars of \nvoters of the towns in which the petition pages were circulated.  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-400.  The \nregistrars of voters must then certify the signatures on each petition page against the enrolled \nparty members and file the certification with the Secretary of the State by June 16, 2020.  Conn. \nGen. Stat. § 9-404c. \nThe deadline for submission of petition forms is not arbitrary.  Bromley Decl. ¶¶58-60.  \nImmediately after the certification process is complete, and all primary challengers have been \nidentified, the town clerks must begin arranging to have the absentee ballots printed for the \nprimary.  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-135b(a).  For the 2020 primary, military and overseas ballots must \nbe sent out by the town clerks on June 27, 2020, only 16 days after the original deadline to \nsubmit petitions, and 18 days before Plaintiffs would like this Court to extend their petitioning \ndeadline.  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-158c; Motion for PI, p.3 (seeking deadline of July 15, 2020).  \nAbsentee ballots must be available to voters on July 21, 2020.  Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 9-135, 9-\n140(f); Bromley Decl. ¶59.  The primary election is scheduled for August 11, 2020.  Bromley \nDecl. ¶59. \nB.  GOVERNOR  LAMONT’S  EXECUTIVE  ORDER  MODIFYING  THE \nPRIMARY PETITIONING PROCESS ADEQUATELY ADDRESSES ANY \nBURDEN IMPOSED ON MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATES IN GAINING \nBALLOT ACCESS DUE TO COVID-19 \nDefendants do not dispute that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on \nour nation and our state.

Stat. § 9-406. \n9 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 10 of 33\nnecessary to combat spread of the virus, has impacted almost every aspect of our society and \naltered the ways in which we, as a community, interact with one another.  Nonetheless, the virus \nhas not required cessation of all civic activities.  Both public and private entities are learning to \nadapt to the need to socially distance by engaging in forms of interaction other than face to face \nmeetings, from tele-visits with doctors to town meetings conducted on video-meeting platforms.  \nSee, e.g. Executive Order 7B, Mar. 14, 2020 (suspending in person open meeting requirements, \npermitting videoconferencing as alternative); Executive Order 7F, Mar. 18, 2020 (expanding \nMedicaid telehealth coverage to audio-only telephone).3  As in other areas, Connecticut should \nnot simply abandon its long-standing regulation of ballot access in the face of the health crisis or \nits balanced approach to the major party candidate selection process that respects the First \nAmendment rights of the parties.   \nAccording to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) the first reported \ncase of COVID-19 in the United States was on January 24, 2020.  See CDC, Cases in the U.S., \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html (last visited June 1, \n2020).  On March 8, 2020, Governor Lamont announced that the first Connecticut resident had \ntested positive for COVID-19.  Press Release: Governor Lamont Announces First Positive Case \nof  Novel  Coronavirus  Involving  a  Connecticut  Resident,  Mar.  8,  2020,  available  at \nhttps://portal.ct.gov/Office-of-the-Governor/News/Press-Releases/2020/03-2020/Governor-\nLamont-Announces-First-Positive-Case-of-Novel-Coronavirus-Involving-a-Connecticut-\nResident.   \n \n3  All  Connecticut  Executive  Orders  related  to  the  emergency  declaration  can  be  found  at \nhttps://portal.ct.gov/Coronavirus/Pages/Emergency-Orders-issued-by-the-Governor-and-State-\nAgencies. \n10 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 11 of 33\nIn response to the positive cases of COVID-19 in Connecticut, the high risk of infection, \nand the current understanding of the fatality rate, Governor Lamont issued a declaration of civil \npreparedness and public health emergency on March 10, 2020, which shall remain in effect until \nSeptember 9, 2020 unless terminated earlier by the governor.  Declaration of Civil Preparedness \nand  Public  Health  Emergencies  (“Emergency  Declaration”),  available  at \nhttps://portal.ct.gov/Coronavirus/Pages/Emergency-Orders-issued-by-the-Governor-and-State-\nAgencies.  The declaration itself did not impose any restrictions.  Id.  Since that date, Governor \nLamont has issued numerous executive orders to protect the health of the state’s residents based \nupon guidance from public health experts including the CDC.  Admittedly, to decrease virus \nspread, some of the orders seek to curtail activities that would not permit safe social distancing, \nas recommended by the CDC and other public health experts.  See, e.g. Executive Order 7, Mar. \n12, 2020 (prohibiting social gatherings larger than 250 people).  Other orders, however, seek to \npermit time-sensitive or ongoing matters to safely proceed within the social distancing guidelines \nby eliminating or modifying certain statutory requirements.  See, e.g. Executive Order 7K, Mar. \n23, 2020 (authorizing remote notarization).  \nAs previously noted, for the 2020 election cycle, the major parties held their nominating \nconventions between May 5 and May 26, 2020.  Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 9-382, 9-383.  Party \nendorsements and certifications that candidates received at least 15% of the delegate votes were \nrequired to be filed within 14 days of each nominating convention.  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-388.  \nThe first day the Secretary of the State could issue nominating petition forms for major party \ncandidates  was May 26, 2020.  Bromley Decl. ¶12.   The original deadline for submitting \npetitions for this election cycle was June 9, 2020.  Id. at ¶14.  \n11 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 12 of 33\nOn May 11, 2020, prior to the first possible day a major party candidate could request a \npetitioning form, Governor Lamont issued Executive Order 7LL, Bromley Decl. ¶31, Exhibit F, \nwhich altered the petitioning process and associated deadlines.  As it relates to major party \ncandidates, the order reduced the number of signatures required by 30% - from 2% of enrolled \nparty members to 1.4% for United States Congress and from 5% of enrolled party members to \n3.5% for all other offices.  Bromley Decl. ¶33.  The order extended the deadline to submit \npetitions from June 9th to June 11th, also moving the deadline for the registrars of voters to \nsubmit verified signature pages to the Secretary of the State by two days, from June 16th to June \n18th.  Id. at ¶¶32, 59.  The order also amended the signature collection process by eliminating the \nin person signature requirement, permitting a registered voter to mail a signed petition form to \nthe candidate, and also permitting a registered voter to scan or otherwise photograph a signed \npetition form and email it to a candidate.  Id. at ¶38. \nThe petitioning requirements set forth in the Executive Order afford many more avenues \nof circulation than previously permitted by statute.  Bromley Decl. ¶¶38-45.  Although the statute \ngoverning nominating petition forms has not been amended, as made clear in guidance issued by \nthe Secretary of the State, Bromley Decl. ¶40, Exhibit H, candidates may submit the petition \napplication by mail or electronically by email to the Secretary or registrar of voters.  Id. at ¶41.  \nThe Secretary of registrar of voters will promptly review the application received and send the \npetitioning forms to the candidate directly by mail or electronically.  Id.  Guidance also makes \nclear that a candidate may distribute petition forms to voters in a variety of ways that were \npreviously not permitted: mailing petition forms to voters, emailing petition forms to voters, \nposting the petition form on a campaign website where voters can print the form, and posting the \npetition form on social media sites such as Facebook.  Id. at ¶42.  The candidate is not required \n12 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 13 of 33\nto personally distribute the petition forms—other individuals may do so on the candidate’s \nbehalf.  Id. at ¶43.  Candidates are also able to seek signatures in person consistent with current \nsocial distancing requirements.  Id. at ¶42. \nThanks to the social distancing measures taken by Connecticut residents, and where \nnecessary  mandated  by  state  executive  order,  the  rate  of  infection  and  the  number  of \nhospitalizations due to COVID-19 has declined for the past several weeks.  Executive Order 7PP, \nMay 18, 2020 (noting decline in hospitalizations).  Therefore, the State has begun the steps \nnecessary to reduce the restrictions imposed to enforce social distancing measures.  On May 20, \n2020,  prior  to  the  earliest  possible  date  to  begin  primary  petitioning,  many  nonessential \nbusinesses were permitted to reopen with certain restrictions.  Id.  For example, in addition to \ndelivery and take-away service, restaurants may now offer outside dining and nonessential retail \nbusinesses may open with reductions in maximum occupancy consistent with those already in \nplace for essential retail.  Id.  If hospitalization rates and other measures related to the virus \ncontinue to track favorably, the State anticipates further reducing restrictions imposed to prevent \nspread of COVID-19. \nIn contrast to minor party and unaffiliated candidates, some of whom had begun the \npetitioning  process  prior  to  or  during  the  peak  of  the  COVID-19  public  health  crisis,  the \npetitioning process for major party candidates  began after the State had already begun the \nprocess of “reopening.”  Further, major party candidates seeking to petition on to the primary \nballot have had the benefit of being aware of and able to prepare in advance to utilize the \nadditional signature gathering methods permitted by Executive Order 7LL.  Kozin Decl. ¶15. \nAccording to their affidavits, Mr. Bartlett intends to seek ballot access as the Democratic \ncandidate for the 10th State Senate District and Mr. Lacourciere intends to seek ballot access as \n13 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 14 of 33\nthe Democratic candidate for the 24th State Assembly District.

ECF No. 9-2, Gottlieb Aff. ¶5.  As of June 1, of the Plaintiffs only Mr. Bartlett and \nMr. Lacourciere have taken out petitioning papers, for the 10th State Senate District and the 24th \nState Senate District.  Bromley Decl. ¶¶25, 26, Exhibit C (Table 1- 2020 Primary Petition \nCandidates).  As a result of Executive Order 7LL, the number of signatures necessary to secure \nprimary ballot access for Mr. Bartlett is 1,028 and for Mr. Lacourciere is 192.  Id. at ¶¶25, 26, \nExhibit C.  In addition to Mr. Barlett and Mr. Lacourciere, 6 candidates have taken out primary \npetitioning papers—2 Republicans and 4 Democrats—including Plaintiffs’ lawyer, Alex Taubes, \nfor the 11th State Senate District.  Id., Exhibit C.  Their signature requirements range from as few \nas 89 signatures for a state assembly district to a high of 3,546 for United States Congress.  Id.  \nAs of June 1, 2020, seven candidates—4 Democrats and 3 Republicans—have also submitted \ncertifications that they received at least 15% of the delegate votes at a nominating convention.  \nId. \nGiven the multiple avenues for major party candidates to attain ballot access provided by \nConnecticut’s  overall  electoral  scheme,  the  substantial  modifications  to  the  petitioning \nrequirements made by the State in response to COVID-19, and the ability of candidates to take \nsteps to prepare to use the new methods of signature gathering now permitted, the facts, as \nalleged by the Plaintiffs, do not satisfy the high burden required for the type of extraordinary \nmandatory injunctive relief they seek.  \n \n14 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 15 of 33\n \nIII.  STANDARD \n \nA preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary remedy.”  UBS Fin. Servs. v. W. Va. Univ. \nHosps., Inc., 660 F.3d 643, 648 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, \nInc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008)); see also Sussman v. Crawford, 488 F.3d 136, 139 (2d Cir. 2007) \n(describing preliminary injunction as “extraordinary and drastic remedy”).  A movant must \nshow, beyond “irreparable” harm or injury, a “likelihood of [ultimate] success” where, as here, \nthe  preliminary  injunction  would  affect  “governmental  action  taken  in  the  public  interest \npursuant to a statutory or regulatory scheme.”  Red Earth LLC v. United States, 657 F.3d 138, \n143 (2d Cir. 2011).  That “likelihood of success” standard is heightened further to a “clear” or \n“substantial” showing of such a likelihood of ultimate success where, as here, plaintiffs seek a \nmandatory  preliminary  injunction  that  would  “alter,  rather  than  maintain,  the  status  quo.”  \nAlmontaser v. New York City Dep’t of Educ., 519 F.3d at 508.  And that heightened standard of \nlikelihood  of  ultimate  success  becomes  even  higher  where,  again,  as  here,  the  preliminary \ninjunction “(1) would provide the plaintiff with ‘all the relief that is sought and (2) could not be \nundone by a judgment favorable to defendants on the merits at trial.”  Citigroup Global Mkts., \nInc. v. VCG Special Opportunities Master Fund Ltd., 598 F.3d 30, 35 (2d Cir. 2010) (citations \nomitted).  Finally, the preliminary injunction movant must also show “that the public’s interest \nweighs in favor of granting an injunction.” Red Earth LLC, 657 F.3d at 143.  The decision to \neither grant or withhold equitable relief “rests in the sound discretion of the court.”  Petrol. Expl., \nInc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n of Ky., 304 U.S. 209, 218 (1938).   \nPlaintiffs’  request  for  mandatory  preliminary  injunctive  relief  is  based  on  a  flawed \nunderstanding of the law and an entirely inadequate factual record.  Plaintiffs fundamentally \n15 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 16 of 33\nmisunderstanding the role of the State in the determination of a party’s standard bearer, asserting \nthat the State has a duty to guarantee them a fair shot at becoming their party’s candidate where \nno such duty exists.   Plaintiffs factual record is pure speculation.  At the time of their affidavits, \nit was still speculation whether Plaintiff Candidates would fail to achieve endorsement by their \nparty and that they would not even be able to attain the support of 15% of party delegates.  \nAlthough those events have since come to pass, on the basis of the affidavits provided by \nPlaintiffs in support of their motion, it is still speculation as to how difficult it will be to gather \nsignatures under the relaxed petitioning requirements of Executive Order 7LL.  Such speculation \nfalls far short of the heightened showing necessary for mandatory preliminary injunctive relief—\na clear or substantial likelihood of ultimate success and proof that the public’s interest requires \nthe injunction.  Nor is it even clear that denial of a preliminary injunction at this point will result \nin irreparable injury, with more than half of the window remaining for candidates to gather \nsignatures.  Further, in the absence of even a single attempt to gather a signature, it is remarkable \nthat the Plaintiffs come to this Court and claim that they have suffered an injury that is actual and \nimminent, and not remote.  They clearly have failed to demonstrate anything beyond their own \nself-serving and carefully tailored conjecture and speculation of what is likely to occur if they \nwere to diligently attempt to comply with the relaxed petitioning requirements.  See Rodriguez \nex. Rel. Rodriguez v. DeBuono, 175 F.3d 227, 234 (2d Cir. 1999).   \nIV.  DISCUSSION \n \nA.  THE  STATE  OF  CONNECTICUT  IS  NOT  CONSTITUTIONALLY \nREQUIRED  TO  REGULATE  THE  MAJOR  PARTIES’  INTERNAL \nCANDIDATE SELECTION TO IMPROVE THE PROSPECTS OF PARTY \nCHALLENGERS, EVEN DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. \n \nThe State of Connecticut may regulate the candidate selection process of Connecticut \npolitical  parties  to  the  extent  necessary  to  ensure  “fair  and  honest”  elections.    Eu  v.  San \n16 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 17 of 33\nFrancisco Democratic Comm., 489 U.S. at 231 (noting that a state’s interest in “fair and honest” \nelections is a subset of the state’s interest in electoral integrity) (citing Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. \nat 724, 730).  To achieve this goal, it is permitted to regulate access to the ballot and to require \npolitical parties to hold primary elections so as to permit enrolled party members—and not just \nconvention delegates—to have a say in selecting the party’s nominee.  Eu v. San Francisco \nDemocratic Comm., 489 U.S. at 231.  However, while a state may structure and monitor the \nmethods  of  political  parties  to  select  their  candidates  by,  for  example,  requiring  primary \nelections, Clingman v. Beaver, 544 U.S. 581, 586 (2005) (upholding state ban on cross-party \nprimary  voting),  it  may  not  unduly  encroach  upon  the  party’s  control  of  its  own  internal \noperations and candidate selection process.  Cal. Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 572 \n(2000) (striking down a blanket primary—an election permitting unaffiliated voters to cast a vote \nin a party’s primary— as unconstitutional because it violated political parties’ right to “not \nassociate” with members of other political parties).  In light of the State interest in maintaining \nparty stability, Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. at 736, it need not effectively promote intra-party \nchallengers, such as Plaintiffs, which the party may properly seek to regulate internally.  Eu v. \nSan Francisco Democratic Comm., 489 U.S. at 227; see Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New \nParty, 520 U.S. 351, 368 (1997) (states have an interest in preventing “splintered parties and \nunrestrained  factionalism”  to  avoid  “significant  damage  to  the  fabric  of  government”  by \nundermining the stability of their political systems and the integrity of the ballot). Kozin Decl. ¶¶ \n2, 9, 12, 16, 17. \nRecent Supreme Court decisions make increasingly clear, and with growing force, that a \nstate may not encroach upon the parties’ candidate selection process.  Although a state may \nrequire parties to conduct primary elections or conventions, Cal. Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 \n17 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 18 of 33\nU.S. at 572, American Party of Tex. v. White, 415 U.S. 767, 779- 781 (1974), it cannot dictate all \nfacets of the nomination process.  Eu v. San Francisco Democratic Comm., 489 U.S. at 229.  \nStates may not regulate the manner in which parties select nominating convention delegates and \npresidential electors.  Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U.S. at 359 (citing Cousins v. \nWigoda,  419  U.S.  477  (1975)).    States  may  not  require  political  parties  to  associate  with \nunaffiliated voters by opening their primaries to all registered voters.  Cal. Democratic Party v. \nJones,  530  U.S.  567.    States  also  may  not  prohibit  political  parties  from  associating  with \nunaffiliated voters in the party’s primary election if the party wishes to do so.  Tashjian v. \nRepublican Party of Conn., 479 U.S. 208 (1986) (finding an unconstitutional violation of the \nstate Republican Party’s right of political association by a state law that prohibited the party from \nallowing independent voters to participate in the party primary).  In short, Connecticut’s political \nparties have a First Amendment right to limit their membership as they wish and to establish a \ncandidate-selection  process  that  best  achieves  their  parties’  participation  and  policy  goals.  \nDemocratic Party of U.S. v. Wisconsin ex rel. La Follette, 450 U.S. 107, 122 (1981); Cal. \nDemocratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. at 574–575; Lopez Torres, 552 U.S. at 202–03.  The First \nAmendment does not give party members lacking a base of support within the party itself the \nright to compel the State to do their bidding and encroach further upon the party’s rights so as to \nprovide them with a more hospitable political environment. \nIn the context of these well-established party rights and limitations on state regulation of \nthe party candidate selection process, it is unsurprising that the Supreme Court rejected an \nanalogous claim in Lopez Torres, namely, that a state must impose upon the parties a candidate \nselection process “more favorable to insurgents.”  Lopez Torres, 552 U.S. at 205.  “To be sure, \n[the Supreme Court has] permitted States to set their faces against ‘party bosses’ by requiring \n18 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 19 of 33\nparty-candidate selection through processes more favorable to insurgents, such as primaries.”  Id.  \nBut permitting states to do so “is a far cry from saying that the Constitution demands it.”  Id.  \nCourts should refrain from imposing their judgment as to whether a party challenger has a “‘fair \nshot’ at winning the party’s nomination.”  Id. 552 U.S. at 206.  The determination of what \nconstitutes a ‘fair shot’ is a legislative one, which courts should “accept so long as it does not too \nmuch infringe upon the party’s associational rights.”  Id.  Indeed, in the context of general \nelection ballot access, the Supreme Court has noted that there is no “constitutional imperative \n[for states] to . . . ‘handicap’ an unpopular candidate to increase the likelihood that the candidate \nwill gain access to the general election ballot.”  Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U.S. 189, \n198 (1986).  The same logic applies with equal, if not greater, force to the state’s role in \ndetermining the process for a political party to select its chosen candidate.  \nPlaintiffs entirely ignore Lopez Torres, instead relying almost exclusively on an older \nDistrict of Connecticut case, Campbell v. Byziewicz, 213 F.Supp.2d 152 (D. Conn. July 23, \n2002).  Campbell is not binding on this Court nor is it even clear that it is the correct application \nof the law in light of the Supreme Court’s subsequent holding in Lopez Torres.  Further, even if \nthis Court were to look to Campbell, it is not “essentially indistinguishable” from this case, as \nPlaintiffs contend.  Pl. Br., p. 2.  In the years since Campbell, numerous candidates have attained \nprimary ballot access each election through both the 15% delegate requirement that was deemed \ninsufficient by the court in Campbell and the subsequently enacted petitioning requirement, \nincluding for state offices like governor and attorney general.  Bromley Decl. ¶17, Exhibits D, E.  \nThis is far from the record before the court in Campbell.  Campbell v. Byziewicz, at 156 (noting \nthat only one person had successfully navigated the primary ballot access system against an \nincumbent for U.S. House of Representatives, U.S. Senate, Governor, or Secretary of the State in \n19 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 20 of 33\n47 years); see also LaRouche v. Kezer, 990 F.2d at 39 (where state affords more than one method \nto attain ballot access, under “the totality approach if either alternative would be constitutional \nstanding alone, the other must be viewed as broadening the opportunities for ballot access and is \nfortiori constitutional.”).  So even if Campbell were entitled to the heavy weight Plaintiffs accord \nit, which is doubtful in light of Lopez Torres, Connecticut’s current electoral scheme compares \nfavorably with the holdings of Campbell. \nBy ignoring Lopez Torres, Plaintiffs also ignore the Supreme Court’s admonition that \nwhen a state regulates the manner in which a political party selects its candidates, it is “the \nparty’s associational rights [that] are at issue (if at all).”  Lopez Torres, 552 U.S. at 203.  \nIndividuals, such as Plaintiffs, who wish to be their party’s chosen candidate may only assert \n“their own claimed associational right” and there is no basis in law to conclude that their \nindividual associational right requires the State to ensure that they can “not only join, but to have \na certain degree of influence in, the party.”  Id. at 203-204 (emphasis in original).  Nor do \nPlaintiffs have a right as voters to see a candidate appear on the ballot in a primary under the \nbanner of a particular political party.  See, e.g. Maslow v. Bd. of Elections in City of New York, \n658 F.3d 291, 297–98 (2d Cir. 2011), cert. denied, 565 U.S. 1275 (2012).  Looking at the entire \nballot access scheme, Plaintiffs, and the voters they purport to represent as a class, “still retain[] \ntheir right to express their political views by supporting other Democratic nominees, even if they \ncould not nominate [a specific candidate]” nor was there anything to prevent any of the Plaintiffs \nfrom timely changing their party affiliation and following the ballot access requirements to attain \nballot access under another party’s banner, or as an unaffiliated candidate, whereby voters could \nstill vote for them on the ballot.”  LaRouche v. Fowler, 152 F.3d 974, 993-94 (D.C. Cir. 1998). \n20 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 21 of 33\nThe changes to Connecticut’s primary process enacted in Executive Order 7LL do not \nalter the conclusion that Connecticut’s primary ballot access requirements are permissible and \nconstitutional.  The order was a rational response to the COVID-19 crisis and preserved the \nability of challenger candidates to seek ballot access for the primary.  Kozin Decl. ¶15.  Mindful \nof  the  limitations  social  distancing  impose  on  the  way  people  interact,  the  order  affords \ncandidates additional avenues to secure petition signatures by eliminating the need for in person \ncirculation of petitions, permitting candidates to distribute petitions through mail, email, and \nother electronic medium, and permitting voters to return signed petitions by mail or email to \ncandidates.  Bromley Decl. ¶¶38-40.  The order also reduces the signature requirements by 30%, \nfrom 2% to 1.4% for United States Congress and from 5% to 3.5% for all other state and district \noffices.  Id. at ¶33.  Further, the order provided two additional days for candidates to secure \nsignatures.  Id. at ¶32.  Although this does not seem like a significant amount of time, each \nadditional day shortens the period of time available to the registrars of voters to validate petition \nsignatures, return the results to the Secretary of the State, and for the town clerks to then print \nand  mail  overseas  ballots.    Id.  at  ¶¶58-59.    Moreover,  the  new  electronic  process  means \ncandidates are not required to travel to government buildings and spend time submitting and \nverifying petition pages during regular business hours.  Id. at ¶46.  That time can now be spent \ngathering petition signatures in person and online, with people available to be online 24 hours a \nday.   \nPlaintiffs’ argument that a few states have made it even easier for candidates to attain \nprimary ballot access in response to COVID-19, Pl. Br., p.10, is unavailing.  Even if this Court \nwere to consider other state’s responses to COVID-19, which is unnecessary in the context of \nmajor party primary ballot access, Plaintiffs provide no meaningful analysis of other state’s \n21 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 22 of 33\nresponses, ignoring entirely the states, such as Massachusetts, that have not permitted the online \ncollection of digital signatures, and failing to consider whether the states that do permit such a \nprocess, such as “docu-sign,” during the COVID-19 crisis already had those systems in place, \nmaking the transition for ballot access petitioning a “minimal burden” for them.  See Goldstein v. \nSecretary of the Commonwealth, 484 Mass. 516 (Sup. Jud. Ct. Apr. 17, 2020) (permitting a \nsignature gathering process almost identical to Connecticut).   \nAlthough Lopez Torres demonstrates that the state and parties need not accord a “fair \nshot” to candidates, Connecticut does so and the Executive Order continues to afford a candidate \nmore than a fair shot.  In the election years from 2006 to 2018, no fewer than 17 primaries were \nheld in any election year, with fewer primaries typically held in years with fewer state offices on \nthe ballot.  Bromley Decl. ¶¶17-18, Ex. D, E. In 2018, 49 candidates successfully attained \nprimary ballot access by garnering 15% of the delegate votes or petitioning, including five \ngubernatorial candidates, three attorney general candidates, one United States Senate candidate, \nand  three  United  States  Congressional  candidates,  all  of  which  have  far  greater  signature \nrequirements than the offices for which Plaintiffs seek ballot access.  Id. at ¶18, Ex. D.  Indeed, \ncandidates also have attained primary ballot access for the office of governor in 2006, 2010, and \n2014; for United States Senate in 2006, 2010, and 2012; for United States Congress in 2006, \n2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014.  Id., Ex. E.  For the 2020 election, there are no state offices or \nUnited States Senate offices on the ballot.  Nonetheless, 7 candidates – 4 Democrats and 3 \nRepublicans – have already attained primary ballot access by garnering 15% of the delegates \nvotes for the relevant office at a nominating convention.  Id., Ex. C.  Because the last date on \nwhich  a  primary  could  beheld  was  May  26,  2020,  and  candidates  have  14  days  to  file \ncertification of having attained 15% of delegate votes, it is too soon to know whether any \n22 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 23 of 33\nadditional candidates attained primary ballot access with 15% of delegate votes.  Further, with \nthe deadline for submitting petition signatures to the registrars of voters still 9 days away, and \nthe deadline for the registrars of voters to submit the certified petitions to the Secretary of the \nState 16 days away, it is far too soon to know how many candidates seeking to attain primary \nballot access by petitioning will succeed. \nThe Tenth Circuit recently applied the reasoning of Lopez Torres and found that Utah \ncould  permissibly  require  its  two  minor  parties  to  hold  primaries  for  their  candidates,  a \nrequirement Connecticut does not have, and that petitioning thresholds for those primaries were \nnot unduly burdensome.  Utah Republican Party v. Cox, 892 F.3d 1066, 1079 (10th Cir. 2018), \ncert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 1290 (2019).  Similarly, the Ninth Circuit applied Lopez Torres and \nupheld Alaska’s mandatory direct primary system, noting that while the state could require a \nprimary system, rather  than nominating conventions, the political parties had “considerable \nfreedom” under Alaskan law “to determine who may vote to select their nominee.”  Alaskan \nIndependence Party v. Alaska, 545 F.3d 1173, 1174 (9th Cir. 2008). Utah Republican Party and \nAlaskan Independence Party demonstrate that while a state may have latitude to exert even \ngreater control over a party’s nomination process than Connecticut does, it is not constitutionally \nmandated to do so.   \nB.  PLAINTIFFS FAIL TO PROVIDE THIS COURT WITH ANY EVIDENCE \nOF  THE  BURDEN  IMPOSED  ON  THEM  BY  APPLICATION  OF \nCONNECTICUT  GENERAL  STATUTES  §§  9-400  &  9-404B,  AS \nMODIFIED BY EXECUTIVE ORDER 7LL \nEven  if  this  Court  were  to  consider  whether  §§  9-400  &  9-404b,  as  modified  by \nExecutive Order 7LL, give Plaintiffs a “fair shot” at primary ballot access, which it is not \nrequired  to  do,  Plaintiffs  cannot  establish  that  candidates,  such  as  Mr.  Bartlett  and  Mr. \nLacourciere, would be unable to attain ballot access in 2020.  It is not yet determined whether \n23 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 24 of 33\nPlaintiffs,  or  any  other  major  party  candidates,  will  succeed  in  availing  themselves  of  the \nopportunities Connecticut’s overall electoral scheme provides to them.  Prestia v. O’Connor, 178 \nF.3d  86  (2d  Cir.  1999).    In  the  absence  of  this  showing,  they  can  hardly  demonstrate  a \nconstitutional harm warranting injunctive relief.  Person v. New York State Bd. of Elections, 467 \nF.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir. 2006) (affirming denial of preliminary injunction and noting an array of \nconstitutional ballot access restrictions). \nAt its core, Plaintiffs’ argument is that the ballot access requirements for major party \ncandidates in Connecticut are difficult in the best of times, and even more so now.  The former \nfinds no support outside of Plaintiff Candidates’ own subjective experience with campaigning.  \nThe latter is pure speculation. \nPlaintiffs would like this Court to assume that their own experience is representative of \nall major party candidates, going so far as to seek class certification, and suggest that the primary \nballot access statutes are unconstitutional even absent the current public health crisis, Pl. Br., p.3, \nand that they place “severe burdens on the rights of candidates and voters.”  Gottlieb Aff. ¶3.   \nMr. Lacourciere does not attest to any previous political experience, providing no basis for his \nopinions on the difficultly of attaining primary ballot access.4  Lacourciere Aff. ¶¶9-10.  Mr. \nBartlett served as campaign manager for numerous candidates, dating as far back as 1999, and \nhas run many successful petition campaigns.  Bartlett Aff. ¶9.  Plaintiffs even go so far as to tout \nhim as “one of the most sophisticated political operatives” in Connecticut.  Pl. Br. p.4, Bromley \nDecl. ¶19.  Mr. Gottlieb attempted to attain primary ballot access for a state senate seat by \n \n4 Plaintiffs title all three Plaintiff Candidates’ affidavits as “Verified Affidavit and/or Expert \nReport.”  Bartlett Aff. p.1, Gottlieb Aff. p.1, Lacourciere Aff. p.1.  Absent any mention of prior \npolitical or petitioning experience, it is unclear what subject Plaintiffs believe Mr. Lacourciere is \nan expert of or his qualifications.  Averring to one prior unsuccessful primary petition campaign, \nGottlieb Aff. ¶5, it is also unclear what subject Mr. Gottlieb is offered as an expert on. \n24 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 25 of 33\npetitioning in 2018, but “fell just short of the signatures required.”  Gottlieb Aff. ¶5.  In 2018 \nthere were Democratic primaries for 26 offices and Republican primaries for 15 offices, with a \ncombined total of 49 candidates qualifying for primary ballot access without receiving their \nparty’s endorsement.  Bromley Decl. ¶18, Ex. D.  Of those candidates, 18 attained ballot access \nthrough the petitioning process.  Id. at ¶18, Ex. D.  The 2018 primary election included primaries \nfor, among other offices, governor, attorney general, and United States senate, all of which have \npetition signature requirement far greater than for a state senate seat.  Id., Exhibits D, G (2020 \nPrimary Signature Requirements).   From 2006 to 2016, there were no fewer than 17 primaries in \nany election year.  Id. at ¶17, Ex. D, E.  Far from an insurmountable hurdle to ballot access, the \nhistory of Connecticut primaries and Mr. Bartlett’s own experience show that the major party \npetitioning requirements are routinely satisfied by candidates.   \nPlaintiffs’ contention that as a result of the COVID-19 public health crisis the petitioning \nrequirements, as modified by Executive Order 7LL, are impossible to satisfy is pure speculation.  \nWhen they filed their motion, Plaintiff Candidates did not even know if they would need to \npetition to attain ballot access and the first date to request petitioning papers had not passed.  \nThey were poised to concede failure before their conventions even opened.  Therefore, Plaintiffs \nhad not attempted to gather a single signature when they sought this Court’s intervention.   \nEven now, almost half-way through the petitioning period, of the Plaintiffs only Mr. \nBartlett and Mr. Lacourciere have taken out petitioning papers.  Bromley Decl. ¶¶25-27.  Mr. \nBartlett is an experienced political operator having both successfully run for office and served as \ncampaign  manager  to  numerous  Democratic  candidates  who  sought  ballot  access  through \npetitioning.  Bartlett Aff. ¶¶4, 9.  Indeed, Mr. Bartlett is the elected Democratic state central \ncommittee member representing New Haven and West Haven for the 10th State Senate District.  \n25 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 26 of 33\nId. at ¶4, see Kozin Decl. ¶3 (noting that state central committee is “the governing body of the \nConnecticut Democratic Party”).  Nonetheless, because Mr. Bartlett worked for former New \nHaven Mayor Toni Harp and local party leadership supported her opponent, Mr. Bartlett now \nbelieves that his only path to primary ballot access is petitioning.  Bartlett Aff. ¶¶6-8.  Although \nMr. Lacourciere has no prior political experience, his petitioning threshold is also much lower; to \nsuccessfully petition he only must secure 192 signatures. Bromley Decl. ¶26, Exhibit C. \nPlaintiffs essentially wish for this Court to take their word that petitioning will be too \ndifficult without providing any evidence that anyone has attempted to attain a single signature \nusing the additional signature gathering methods now permitted.  Mr. Lacourciere does not attest \nto having ever worked on a candidate’s petitioning campaign.  Lacourciere Aff. ¶¶7-8.  Mr. \nGottlieb’s affidavit is no better.  He speculates, without any evidence, that requiring voters to \nsign a petition and then either mail the signed petition or scan and email it “puts the process out \nof reach for all but the most determined and well-resourced voters.”  Gottlieb Aff. ¶28.   \nAlthough Mr. Bartlett has far more political experience than the other Plaintiffs, his \naffidavit too is nothing more than speculation and flawed assumptions.  First, Mr. Bartlett \nincorrectly assumes that in person petitioning is “impossible” at this time.  Bartlett Aff. ¶10.  \nThis is simply incorrect.  Although in person petitioning may require different measures than in \nprior election cycles, none of the executive orders issued in response to COVID-19 prohibit in \nperson petitioning.  As of May 20, 2020, Connecticut has begun “reopening.”  Individuals should \nstill maintain a safe distance from one another, and wear a mask, but there is nothing prohibiting \ncandidates or volunteers from holding an in person conversation with voters.  So long as a single \npetitioner  signs  their  name  to  a  petition  form,  the  normal  requirements  for  circulators  to \npersonally witness the signature and attest to that fact do not apply.  Bromley Decl. ¶¶38-39.  \n26 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 27 of 33\nThus, a candidate or volunteer is no longer required to be in close proximity to the voter when he \nor she signs a petition form.  Id. at ¶39.  Presumably, there are any number of ways in which an \nindividual could make available petition forms to voters and the voter could return the form, \nwithout physically passing the form back and forth.  Id. at ¶48.  For example, forms could be \navailable at a table with a box with a slot in the lid to place the completed form in, with the \ncirculator sanitizing the table and pens after each signature.  The mere fact that the in person \ninteraction would look different than in prior years is not evidence that it would be ineffective.  \nMoreover,  it  is  undisputable  that  political  action  and  civil  engagement  never  ceased  in \nConnecticut.    See,  e.g.  https://ctmirror.org/2020/04/06/a-noisy-protest-then-prison-chief-\nconfirms-he-has-been-reducing-inmate-population/ (last viewed June 1, 2020).  In recent days, \nthousands of people have come together to in cities across Connecticut to speak out on important \nmatters  of  public  concern.    See  https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-news-george-\nfloyd-connecticut-protest-84-20200531-20200531-iqrb2lcypvewddnaqgg6wysxmu-\nstory.html#nt=oft-Double%20Chain~Flex%20Feature~homepage-main-\nchain~centerpiece~~1~yes-art~curated~curatedpage (last viewed June 1, 2020).   \nEven if this Court were to conclude that in person signature gathering is too burdensome \ndue to COVID-19, candidates are not limited to in person signature gathering.  Bromley Decl. \n¶¶42, 44.  Mr. Bartlett devotes a single paragraph to his explanation of the burden imposed by \nthe additional signature gathering methods now permitted by Executive Order 7LL.  Bartlett Aff. \n¶17.  In doing so, he avers that “[t]he supposed alternative to an in-person paper petition drive \nrequires the voter to be either mailed a petition or requires candidates to email the petition to the \nvoter, which is unlikely because voters’ email addresses are rarely provided in applications to \nregister to vote and are therefore not public information,”  Id.  Mr. Bartlett’s interpretation of the \n27 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 28 of 33\npetitioning requirements is far narrower than the language in the Executive Order, as evidenced \nby the guidance offered by the Secretary of the State.  Bromley Decl., Exhibit H.  In addition to \nmail and email, a candidate may also make their petitioning form available to voters on a \ncampaign website or through social media.  Bromley Decl. ¶42, Exhibit H.  A candidate serious \nabout attaining primary ballot access would use as many options as possible to secure signatures.  \nParticularly for offices with low petitioning thresholds, it is perfectly reasonable to assume that a \ndiligent candidate would attempt to contact enrolled party members in the relevant district in as \nmany ways as possible. Id. at ¶51-52.  Candidates, and volunteers on their behalf, may send mail, \nemail, or engage in online outreach during at any hour of the day or night from any location.  Id. \nat ¶¶43-43, 51-52.  Concededly, electronic circulation and collection of signatures has not been \ncommon within the context of ballot access petitions prior to 2020.  However, the use of mail, \nemail, websites, and social media by political parties is far from novel.  Even the United States \nCensus may be completed online.  See my2020census.gov.  Households may also respond to the \nCensus  by  mailing  back  the  questionnaire  sent  to  each  home  or  by  phone.    See \nhttps://www.2020census.gov/en/ways-to-respond/responding-by-mail.html.   \nMr. Bartlett also assumes that candidates will be unable to learn the email addresses of \nenrolled party members.  Bartlett Aff. ¶17.  In making this assumption, Mr. Bartlett ignores the \nability of candidates and volunteers to reach out to voters personally known to them to solicit \nsupport. Bromley Decl. ¶¶51-52.   A candidate or volunteer could provide the petition form to \nthe voter in a number of ways after speaking with them: directing them to a website where they \nmight download the petition, mailing the form to them, or even leaving the form at the voter’s \ndoor.  The volunteer could also follow up if the form is not returned.  There is no limit on the \nnumber of volunteers a candidate may use and without the in person requirement volunteers do \n28 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 29 of 33\nnot even need to be in Connecticut to reach out to voters.  Id. at ¶52.  Even for offices with \nhigher signature thresholds, a small number of volunteers could easily divide the labor and attain \nsufficient signatures.  Id. at ¶¶54-57.  For a candidate like Mr. Bartlett, who has a long history of \nparticipation  with  the  Democratic  Party  in  Connecticut,  including  having  worked  for  the \nprevious  mayor  of  New  Haven,  and  who  is  currently  an  elected  Democratic  state  central \ncommittee member, it strains credulity that he would have no support in his petition campaign \nand no means of contacting party members in his district. \nMr. Bartlett also incorrectly concludes that a candidate may only submit hard copies of \npetition pages to his or her registrar of voters, which would require a candidate to print each \nsigned petition received electronically, along with the associated email.  Bartlett Aff. ¶17.  This \nis simply incorrect.  The Secretary’s guidance on this has been posted since May 14, 2020 and \ncould not be clearer on this point.  Bromley Decl.¶40, Exhibit H.  A candidate may submit \nsigned petitions received via email to the registrar of voters in an email; the candidate is only \nrequired to submit original hard copies of petition pages that were returned to the candidate in \nhard copy.  Bromley Decl. ¶46.  That Plaintiff Bartlett would so willfully ignore this guidance in \norder to assert a hardship is revealing of the likely contrived nature of his purported “irreparable” \nharm.  In light of the numerous incorrect assumptions made by Mr. Bartlett, this Court should \naccord no weight to the vague statement that the “new process is cumbersome and costly.”  \nBartlett Aff. ¶17. \nPlaintiffs also contend that they are harmed because “a ballot access method takes time to \nplan for and organize.”  Pl. Br., p.8.  The need to plan, however, does not establish irreparable \nharm.  Kozin Decl. ¶¶9, 15.  Indeed, just the opposite is true because Plaintiffs have had \nadequate time to plan for the additional methods of signature gathering permitted by Executive \n29 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 30 of 33\nOrder 7LL.  Plaintiffs had over two weeks to plan and organize for an electronic petitioning \ndrive from when Executive Order 7LL was issued.  The order was issued on May 11, 2020; \npetitions became available for primary candidates on May 26, 2020.  That was more than a two-\nweek period to begin gathering email and physical addresses for registered Democrats in their \ndistricts, training campaign volunteers and any paid campaign workers, and doing outreach to \ninform the community of the new process.  Plaintiffs could have used that time to line up \nsupporters so that they were ready to sign the petition or help with petitioning on the very first \nday.  Indeed, Plaintiffs likely knew well before May 11, 2020 that the additional petitioning \nmethods were a real possibility in Connecticut in 2020.  Massachusetts had gone a similar route \nfor primary petitions on April 17, 2020.  See Goldstein v. Secretary of the Commonwealth, 484 \nMass. 516 (Sup. Jud. Ct. Apr. 17, 2020).  Plaintiffs also should have been aware as early as \nMarch 10, 2020 when the governor declared a public health emergency, that signature gathering \nwould require a different approach for the 2020 election due to COVID-19.  With that awareness \nthey could have begun planning for a petitioning campaign months before the petitioning period \nbegan while, at the same time, doing their upmost to attain ballot access through either of the \nmethods that would avoid the need for signature gathering at all- party endorsement or 15% of \nthe delegate votes.  Kozin Decl. ¶9.  Their evidence does not address whether they undertook \nthese reasonable and diligent efforts to adapt to the new “normal” that everyone is experiencing \nright now. \nIn essence, Plaintiffs cannot meet their high burden to demonstrate that the reduced \nnumber of petition signatures using the additional circulation methods authorized by Executive \nOrder 7LL, combined with the existing methods of attaining ballot access through endorsement \nor delegate support, are so burdensome at this time as to prevent a candidate from attaining ballot \n30 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 31 of 33\naccess  because  they  have  not  even  attempted  to  comply  with  the  requirements.    In  their \nspeculative opinion, any attempt to comply with the requirements would simply divert their \nresources from “being able to plan for a meaningful alternative form of ballot access,” Bartlett \nAff. ¶21, or, in other words, the form of ballot access that they believe is better for them.   \nPlaintiffs’ claim of a First Amendment harm to voters, including themselves, resulting \nfrom Executive Order 7LL is equally speculative and attenuated.  Voters’ First Amendment right \nto associate with a “field of candidates” typically refers to a right at the general election, and not \na right implicated by the “field vying for a party’s nomination.”  Maslow v. Bd. of Elections in \nCity of New York, 658 F.3d at 297–98 (citing Lopez Torres, 552 U.S. at 207); Norman v. Reed, \n502 U.S. 279 (1992); Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U.S. 189 (1986); Anderson v. \nCelebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 782 (1983); American Party of Tex. v. White, 415 U.S. 767 (1974); \nJenness v. Fortson, 403 U.S. 431 (1971); Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23 (1968).  Here, there is \nno  evidence  that  enrolled  party  members  did  not  have  the  ability  to  associate  with  these \ncandidates at the nominating conventions, either as delegates or supporters to assist them in \nachieving the endorsement or at least 15% of the delegate votes.  Nor is there any evidence that a \nsingle enrolled party member interested in supporting one of the candidates was prevented from \nsigning a petition using any of the many methods now permitted by Executive Order 7LL. \nIt is beyond dispute that although states may regulate to some extent the manner in which \nparties  select  their  candidates,  including  requiring  primaries,  a  state  is  not  constitutionally \nrequired to impose upon the parties a candidate selection process “more favorable to insurgents,” \nor even one that affords candidates a “fair shot.”  Lopez Torres, 552 U.S. at 205.  Nonetheless, in \nresponse to the COVID-19 public health crisis, Connecticut has both reduced the threshold \nnecessary to gain ballot access for petitioning primary candidates and afforded candidates their \n31 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28   Filed 06/02/20   Page 32 of 33\n“fair shot” through additional avenues to seek petition signatures.  Plaintiffs entirely ignore \nLopez  Torres,  and  instead  wish  for  this  Court  to  supplant  both  the  Democratic  Party’s \ndetermination of how it wishes to select its candidates and the State’s reasoned determination of \nthe modifications necessary due to COVID-19 with Plaintiffs’ self-serving opinion as to what \nprimary access method would be optimal for them.  Plaintiffs must do more than speculate about \nthe  effectiveness  of  the  available  paths  to  ballot  access  in  order  to  justify  the  removal  of \nConnecticut from the regulation of its own elections and of the Democratic Party from the \ndetermination of its own candidates.  They do not even aver that they have attempted to collect a \nsingle signature using the methods permitted by Executive Order 7LL.  As such, they fall far \nshort of meeting their burden to establish that they are substantially likely to prevail on the merits \nof their claims.  Almontaser v.

BROMLEY \nI, Theodore E. Bromley, hereby declare as follows: \n1.  I submit this Declaration in support of Defendants Secretary of the State Denise \nMerrill (“the Secretary”) and Governor Ned Lamont (“the Governor”) in Gottlieb v. Lamont, No. \n3:20-cv-00623 (JCH).  I have compiled the information in the statements below through personal \nknowledge, the Connecticut Secretary of the State (“SOTS”) personnel who assisted me in \ngathering the information from our agency, or on the basis of documents I have reviewed.  I also \nhave familiarized myself with the allegations in Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint and Motions for \nPreliminary Injunction as to Count 1 in this case in order to understand them and how the relief \nsought by Plaintiffs will impact SOTS, voters, candidates and other election officials in the \nadministration of the 2020 elections.  See ECF Nos. 8 and 9  \n2.  I am the Director of Elections at SOTS.  The Secretary is the chief election \nofficial for the State of Connecticut.  SOTS is the lead agency for administering and overseeing \nelections in Connecticut.  I have worked at SOTS since 2001 in the Legislative, Elections \n-1- \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 3 of 116\nAdministration Division, which administers statewide elections in Connecticut and advises local \nelection officials on election matters.  I was promoted to Director of Elections in August 2019, in \nwhich capacity I manage a staff of thirteen.   \nI.  Overview of Connecticut’s System of Ballot Access for Major Party Primary \nCandidates During Ordinary Times \n \n3.  The  endorsement  and  nomination  of  Major  Party  candidates  in  Connecticut  is \ngoverned by both the State or Local Party rules of the respective Party and the Connecticut General \nStatutes.   \nA.  The Major Party Rules \n4.  The United States Supreme Court has recognized that “a political party has a First \nAmendment right to limit its membership as it wishes, and to choose a candidate-selection \nprocess that will in its view produce the nominee who best represents its political platform.”  \nNew York State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U.S. 196, 202 (2008).  The two Major \nParties in Connecticut, the Democratic and Republican Parties, have exercised that right and \nadopted party rules that govern the manner in which they will choose their candidates for public \noffice.  The Democratic Party’s Rules are attached hereto as Exhibit A, and the Republican \nParty’s  Rules  are  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  B.    The  rules  also  are  available  online:  \nhttps://portal.ct.gov/-/media/SOTS/ElectionServices/Party-Rules/CT-Democratic-State-Party-\nRules.pdf?la=en  and  https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/SOTS/ElectionServices/tcrules/RSCC-Rules-\nand-Bylaws-5-22-18.pdf?la=en. \n5.  As reflected in the rules, both of the Major Parties initially endorse their preferred \ncandidate at a State or District convention, depending on the office.  See, e.g., Exh. A, Art. III, \nsections 13-15; Exh. B., Art. II and III.  The Democratic Party’s rules provide that the candidate \n-2- \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 4 of 116\nendorsed at the convention shall run as the “party-endorsed” candidate in any primary that may be \nheld.  \n6.  The Democratic Party’s rules also specifically address the procedures that apply for \nsomebody to primary the party-endorsed candidate.1  They provide that a challenger is eligible to \nprimary the party-endorsed candidate only if: (1) he or she receives at least 15% of the delegate vote \nat the convention; or (2) obtains valid signatures from at least 5% of the registered party members in \nthe district for the offices of state senate, assembly and judge of probate, and at least 2% for \nstatewide and congressional offices.  Exh. A, Art. III, section 13. \n7.  The  Democratic  Party  rules  expressly  state  that  “[t]he  nominations  of  the \nDemocratic Party to all public offices and the election to a town committee and delegates to \nconventions shall be made in all respects in accordance with the State Party Rules,” and that “no \nperson may contest in a primary for any State or District office unless such person has received at \nleast fifteen percent (15%) of the votes of the convention delegates . . . or such person has received \n[the required number] of valid signatures” specified in the rules. \n8.  At least with regard to the Democratic Party, therefore, the Party’s rules themselves \nindependently require candidates to obtain the specified amount of support at the convention or to \ncollect the requisite number of signatures before being eligible to primary.  That is a choice that the \nDemocratic Party has made, and it reflects that Party’s exercise of its own First Amendment right to \n“choose  a  candidate-selection  process  that  will  in  its  view  produce  the  nominee  who  best \nrepresents its political platform.”  Lopez Torres, 552 U.S. at 202. \n \n \n \n1   The Republican Party’s rules do not specifically address primary procedures. \n-3- \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 5 of 116\nB.  State Law \n9.  Connecticut requires Major Parties to hold primaries in accordance with state law \nand party rules.  Because it is the Parties themselves that have a First Amendment right to choose \nhow their candidates will be selected, the State’s main interest in regulating primaries is simply \nto ensure orderly and fair elections.  As a result, the statutes relating to primaries largely track \nand mirror the rules that the Major Parties have adopted, and in many places specifically identify the \nparty rules as the governing authority on how the process will work.  See, e.g., Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-\n383  (providing  that  the  time  and  place  of  conventions  “shall  be  fixed  by  the  state  central \ncommittee or other authority of the party holding such convention, in accordance with the rules \nof such party”); Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-384 (providing that conventions “shall originate . . . in \naccordance with the rules of such party”); Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-386 (providing that any tie votes \nfor endorsement at a convention “shall be dissolved in the manner prescribed in the applicable \nstate or district rules of the party selecting such candidate”); Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-387 (providing \nthat “[t]he state rules of each party shall prescribe the manner in which any dispute as to the \nendorsement by such party of a candidate . . . shall be resolved”); Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-390 \n(relating to selection of party-endorsed candidates for municipal office); Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-\n393 (regarding selection of town committee members and delegates); Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-394 \n(regarding selection of district delegates). \n10.  State law provides that Parties must choose their preferred candidates for nomination \nat a state or district convention, town committee meeting or caucus held in accordance with party \nrules.  Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 9-382 and 9-391.  The candidate chosen at those events runs as the \nparty-endorsed candidate in any primary that may be held. \n-4- \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 6 of 116\n11.  As with the party rules, state law provides three ways in which a candidate may get \non a primary ballot to be nominated as the Party’s candidate at the general election: (1) by becoming \nthe party-endorsed candidate; (2) by submitting a certificate to SOTS attesting that the candidate \nreceived at least 15% of the delegate vote at the convention; or (3) by submitting petition forms with \nvalid signatures from at least 5% of enrolled party members in the district for district offices, and at \nleast 2% of the enrolled party members for state offices.  Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 9-400, 9-406 and 9-\n415. \n12.  To obtain a place on a primary ballot by petitioning, the candidate first must obtain \npetition forms from SOTS or the Registrar of Voters, depending on the office.  The date when \npetition forms become available differs depending on the office.  For statewide and congressional \noffice, the forms became available on April 28, 2020.  For all other offices the forms became \navailable on May 26, 2020.  See Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 9-404a and § 9-409.  SOTS informs \ncandidates how many signatures they need to obtain and includes the number on the issuance \nletter that accompanies the primary petition issued to the candidate.  Candidates can immediately \nbegin gathering signatures as soon as they receive the forms.  \n13.  Primary petition pages may be circulated to voters only by enrolled party members. \nSimilarly, only enrolled party members from the district in which the candidate seeks office may \nsign a petition.  The circulator must attest to the veracity of the signature of each person signing.  \nConn. Gen. Stat. §§ 9-404b and 9-410.  Candidates can obtain a certified copy of the party \nenrollment list for the municipality or district from the Registrar of Voters.  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-\n413a. \n14.  Once a candidate has collected the required number of signatures, he or she must \nsubmit all signature pages to the Registrar of Voters, who will then review the signatures to \n-5- \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 7 of 116\ndetermine whether they are valid and submit the valid signatures to SOTS.  Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 9-\n400; 9-404c and 9-412.  In 2020, the deadline for candidates seeking the offices of state senator, \nstate representative and judge of probate to submit their primary petition forms to the Registrar \nordinarily would have been 63 days prior to the date of the primary, which in 2020 is June 9, 2020.  \nConn. Gen. Stat. §§ 9-400, 9-405 and 9-406.  As discussed below, however, the Governor extended \nthat deadline to June 11, 2020, through Executive Order 7LL, attached hereto as Exhibit F.  Once \nSOTS receives the signatures from the Registrars of Voters, staff review and tabulate the number of \nvalid signatures to determine whether the candidate met the requirements.  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-\n404c. \n15.  The signature verification process can be done on a rolling basis, so there is no \nneed for a candidate to wait until the deadline, or even close to the deadline, to submit their \npetition pages.  Further, SOTS makes the petitioning process easier for candidates by routinely \nallowing them to cure defects in petition documents they have submitted so long as the deadline \nhas not passed.  Once the deadline is past, SOTS does not typically allow curing without a court \norder because the Secretary interprets her duties to be mostly mandatory and not discretionary.  I \ncan think of literally hundreds of times we have allowed a candidate to come back into the office \nto fix a mistake on a form so long as there was more time left before the deadline. \n16.  The primary petitioning process described above is a relatively new process when it \ncomes to primaries for Major Parties.  Prior to 2003, there were no procedures under state law or \nparty rules for candidates to petition onto the ballot for a primary for multi-town districts, and such \ncandidates could therefore obtain a place on the primary ballot only by becoming the party-endorsed \ncandidate or by obtaining 15% of the delegate vote at the convention.  This Court struck that \n-6- \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 8 of 116\nframework down in Campbell v. Bysiewicz, 242 F. Supp. 2d 164 (D. Conn. 2003).  The legislature \namended state law after Campbell to permit the petitioning process described above. \n17.  Candidates historically have had success obtaining a place on the primary ballot \nthrough these post-Campbell procedures, as there have been between 17 and 49 non-endorsed \ncandidates who participated in primaries during each election cycle since 2006.  See Tables 1 \nthrough 3, attached hereto as Exhibits C, D and E.  By contrast, during the pre-Campbell election \ncycles in 1998 and 2002 there were only 19 and 13 primaries, respectively. \n18.  Of the 49 candidates who participated in primaries held in 2018, they enjoyed \nsuccess at obtaining ballot access through both the 15% requirement (31 candidates) and the \npetitioning requirement (18 candidates).  See Exhibit D.  Similarly, of the 17 candidates who \nparticipated in primaries held in 2016, there were 10 candidates who petitioned onto the ballot and 7 \ncandidates who obtained ballot access through the 15% requirement.  Id. \nII.  Plaintiff Jason Bartlett’s Prior Ballot Access \n19.  Plaintiff Jason Bartlett is an experienced political candidate who previously has \nrun for and been elected to public office. \n20.  Mr. Bartlett ran for the office of State Representative in 2002 and 2004, but \nnarrowly lost to his Republican challenger in both instances. \n21.  In 2006, Mr. Bartlett was elected as the State Representative for the 2nd Assembly \nDistrict, defeating his Republican challenger with 4,112 votes, which was 54% of the total vote. \nMr. Bartlett was re-elected to a second term for that same office in 2008, obtaining 5,966 votes \nwhich was again 54% of the total vote. \n22.  In 2012, Mr. Bartlett ran for the office of State Senator for the 24th Senate \nDistrict, but again lost by a very small margin to his Republican challenger.  During that election \n-7- \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 9 of 116\nMr. Bartlett participated in the Citizens’ Election Program (“CEP”), which is Connecticut’s \npublic  campaign  financing  program.    To  qualify  for  a  CEP  grant,  candidates  must  raise \nqualifying contributions of less than $100 from individual donors, with the amount of required \ncontributions varying by office.  It is my understanding, based on records of the State Elections \nEnforcement Commission, that in the 2012 election cycle, Mr. Bartlett raised a total of 408 \ncontributions from different individuals, which included 332 contributions from individuals who \nresided  in  the  district.    Of  those  332  contributions,  300  were  qualifying  contributions  for \npurposes of obtaining a CEP grant.  The fact that Mr. Bartlett was able to raise that many \ncontributions from individual donors within his district—which is more of an imposition on the \nindividual than simply signing a petition page—illustrates that Mr. Bartlett has been able to \ngarner political support in the past and could do so again for any primary petition drive. \n23.  In addition to running for these offices, to the best of my knowledge Mr. Bartlett \nalso has past political experience in Connecticut serving as the campaign manager for New Haven \nMayor Toni Harp, and also for Mary Jane Foster in Bridgeport.  He also states in his declaration that \nhe is the elected State Central Committee member representing the Cities of New Haven & West \nHaven for State 10th State Senate District within the Connecticut Democratic Party.  ECF No. 9-\n3, ¶ 4.  In addition, Mr. Bartlett admits that he has “years of experience obtaining ballot petition \nsignatures” as the campaign manager for numerous candidates, including “successful petition \naccess campaigns for James Newton, Democratic candidate for Mayor of New Haven in 1999, \nState Senator Martin Looney, Democratic candidate for Mayor of New Haven in 2001, Mary \nJane Foster, Democratic candidate for Mayor of Bridgeport in 2011, and then-Sen. Toni Harp, \nDemocratic candidate for Mayor of New Haven 2013.”  It is therefore apparent that Mr. Bartlett \n-8- \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 10 of 116\nhas significant experience with, support from and contacts within the Democratic Party, both as a \ncandidate and in other political capacities. \n24.  In  the  current  election  cycle,  Mr.  Bartlett  sought  the  Democratic  Party’s \nendorsement for the office of State Senator in the 10th Senate District, but my understanding from \nhis counsel in this case is that he only received 11% of the delegate vote at the convention.  \nAlthough that was not enough to secure the Party’s endorsement or to obtain ballot access with 15% \nof the vote, it shows that Mr. Bartlett still has support among members of the Party.   \n25.  Because he did not qualify for the primary ballot at the convention, Mr. Bartlett took \nout primary petition forms on or about May 26, 2020.  He ordinarily would have been required to \ncollect 1,469 signatures to qualify for the ballot.  As discussed below, however, that number has \nnow been reduced to 1,028 as a result of Executive Order 7LL. \nIII.  Plaintiff Richard Lacourciere’s Ballot Access \n26.  Plaintiff Richard Lacourciere currently is seeking ballot access for a primary for \nthe office of State Representative in the 24th Assembly District.  Because he did not obtain a \nplace on the ballot at the convention, Mr. Lacourciere also took out primary petition forms on \nMay 27, 20202.  Mr. Lacourciere ordinarily would have been required to collect 273 signatures to \nqualify for the primary ballot.  That number has now been reduced to just 192 as a result of \nExecutive Order 7LL. \nIV.  Plaintiff Andy Gottlieb’s Ballot Access \n27.  Plaintiff Andy Gottlieb suggests in his declaration that he is considering running \nfor office during the 2020 election cycle, but does not identify which office and does not indicate \nthat he has decided to run for any office.  ECF No. 9-2.  As of the date of this declaration, Mr. \nGottlieb has not taken out any primary petition forms, the Party did not endorse him for any \n-9- \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 11 of 116\noffice, and he did not receive 15% of the delegate vote for any office.  Regardless of what he \npotentially may decide to do in the future, therefore, at this time he is not formally seeking ballot \naccess for any office during the August primary. \nV.  The COVID-19 Pandemic and its Impact on the 2020 Elections \n28.  The Governor declared a public health emergency  to combat the COVID-19 \npandemic  on  March  10,  2020.    Since  that  time,  the  Governor,  the  Secretary  and  other \ngovernment officials involved in the election process have taken a number of steps to mitigate \nthe impacts of COVID-19 and ensure that the 2020 elections are conducted in a proper and fair \nmanner that maximizes the ability of voters and candidates to participate in the electoral process.  \n29.  For example, in an effort “to protect the health and safety of voters, poll workers, \nand the most vulnerable members of our population,” the Governor modified General Statutes         \n§ 9-464 and postponed the Presidential primary until August 11, 2020.  He also modified \nGeneral Statutes § 9-135 and other statutes to permit voters to vote by absentee ballot if they are \nunable to appear at a polling place because of the COVID-19 sickness.  See Executive Orders \n7G,  7BB  and  7QQ,  available  at  https://portal.ct.gov/Office-of-the-Governor/Governors-\nActions/Executive-Orders/Governor-Lamonts-Executive-Orders (last viewed May 21, 2020); see \nalso ECF No. 19-1. \n30.  The Secretary similarly has taken steps to protect the electoral process during the \npandemic.  For example, the Secretary released and is implementing a comprehensive plan to ensure \nthat the 2020 elections will be conducted in a manner that is safe, secure and accessible for all \nvoters.    See  https://authoring.ct.gov/-/media/SOTS/ElectionServices/2020-Voting-Plan-FINAL-\nDRAFT-May-2-715-PM.pdf?la=en (last visited May 20, 2020).  She also recently issued an opinion \nabout the meaning of General Statutes § 9-135 that will ensure that those individuals with a \n-10- \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 12 of 116\npreexisting illness that may be adversely impacted by COVID-19 can vote by absentee ballot.  See \nhttps://portal.ct.gov/SOTS/Press-Releases/2020-Press-Releases/Secretary-of-the-State-Denise-\nMerrill-on-her-Official-Interpretation-of-Absentee-Ballot-Statute (last visited May 20, 2020). \n31.  In addition to all of these steps, the Governor recently issued Executive Order 7LL \n(“the Order”), Exhibit F, which substantially modifies the petitioning process described above.  In \ndoing so, the Governor acknowledged that COVID-19—and some of the social distancing measures \nthat have been implemented to combat it—will adversely impact the ability of some candidates to \ncollect the number of signatures that ordinarily would be required.  At the same time, the Governor \nalso recognized that “the process of qualifying for ballot access through in-person petitioning as \nrequired under Title 9 of the General Statutes is a basic and vital requirement of our state \nconstitution and our election laws, the purpose of which is to ensure that voters have the \nopportunity to choose among viable candidates who have qualified for the ballot based on a \nminimum threshold of support, and to promote an election that is orderly, fair and transparent.”  \nThe Order seeks to achieve that state interest while at the same time making it easier for \ncandidates to comply with the petitioning requirements.  It does so primarily in three ways. \n32.  First, the Order extends the deadline for candidates to submit the required signatures \nby two days, until June 11, 2020.  \n33.  Second, the Order reduces by 30% the number of signatures a petitioning candidate \nmust collect to obtain ballot access.  Exhibit G to this declaration identifies the number of signatures \na candidate must collect for certain federal and state offices, both before and after this 30% \nreduction is taken into account.   \n-11- \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 13 of 116\n34.  The highest number of signatures that a candidate will have to collect to appear on \nthe August primary ballot are for the Congressional Districts, which require between 6,591 and \n2,597 signatures. \n35.  For the office of State Senator, the number of required signatures is significantly \nlower, ranging from only 72 for a Republican primary in Senate District 10 to at most 1,233 for a \nDemocratic primary in Senate District 2.  There are 5 Senate Districts that require 200 or fewer \nsignatures; 8 more that require less than 400 signatures; and 10 more that require less than 500 \nsignatures.   \n36.  The required number of signatures for the office of State Representative is even less, \nranging from between just 9 signatures for a Republican primary in Assembly District 7 to a high of \n352 in the 15th Assembly District.  There are 8 Assembly District primaries that require less than 20 \nsignatures, 20 more that require 50 signatures or less, and 31 more that only require a total of less \nthan 100 signatures. \n37.  As discussed above, the modified number of signatures that Mr. Bartlett and Mr. \nLacourciere now must collect is 1,028 and 192, respectively.  I do not know how many of these \nrequired  signatures  Mr.  Bartlett  or  Mr.  Lacourciere  already  have  collected  for  these  offices.  \nHowever, Mr. Bartlett and Mr. Lacourciere already have obtained primary petition forms.  If they \nhave been diligent, therefore, it is entirely possible that they already have collected a substantial \nnumber of the required signatures. \n38.  Third, in addition to reducing the number of required signatures, the Order also \nmakes it significantly easier for candidates to obtain those signatures.  It does so first by eliminating \nthe requirement that petitions must be circulated, and that signatures must be collected, submitted \nand attested to, by an eligible circulator under General Statutes §§ 9-400 and 9-410.  Under the \n-12- \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 14 of 116\nOrder, enrolled party members may now send the signed petition forms directly to the candidate \nwithout the need for a circulator, and the candidate can then compile all signatures and send them \ndirectly to the Registrar of Voters by the June 11 deadline.   \n39.  The Order also provides that “a petitioning signature shall be accepted as valid” if \nit: (1) is mailed to the candidate and then to the Registrar of Voters by the applicable deadline; or \n(2) it is “scanned or photographed electronically, and returned to the candidate by electronic mail \nand later to the Registrar of Voters by the applicable deadline along with a copy of the email \ndemonstrating the electronic transmission of the petition by the registered voter.”  This latter \nchange is significant, as it permits electronic signature gathering that does not require any in \nperson interaction whatsoever, and makes it much easier for candidates to gather the required \nsignatures.  The Order further provides that these changes are in addition to, and not in lieu of, \nthe procedures that already exist, which candidates may continue to use in accordance with any \nsocial distancing measures that may exist between now and the June 11 petitioning deadline.   \n40.  The Secretary has issued Guidance about how the petitioning process will work after \nthe  Order,  which  is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  H;  and  available  online  at \nhttps://portal.ct.gov/SOTS/Election-Services/Nominating-Petitions/Nominating-Petitions  (last \nvisited June 1, 2020).   \n41.  As reflected in the Guidance, each candidate can obtain the application for petition \nforms online, fill it out and sign electronically, and return it electronically or by mail to SOTS or the \nRegistrar of Voters.  The contact information for both SOTS and the Registrars is specifically \nidentified in the Guidance.  SOTS or the Registrars will promptly review all applications received \nand send the petition forms directly to the candidate, also by mail or electronically. \n-13- \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 15 of 116\n42.  Once candidates receive the petition forms, they no longer need to rely on circulators \nto send the forms to prospective registered voters, or to collect and verify the signatures.  Rather, \ncandidates can send the forms directly to enrolled party members through a variety of means, \nincluding by: (1) regular mail; (2) email; (3) online through the campaign’s website; (4) online \nthrough social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter or other such social media services; or \n(5) in person consistent with whatever social distancing protocols may be in place at the time.   \n43.  Candidates can still rely on supporters to help with this electronic outreach to \nvoters, and need not do it all themselves.  \n44.  Once a registered voter receives the petition form through any of the methods \ndescribed above, he or she has numerous options for signing and returning it to the candidate.  \nFor example, the voter may:  \na.  Sign the petition in ink and return the signed original signature to the candidate \nvia regular mail; \nb.  Sign the petition by printing the petition page, signing in ink and re-scanning to \nreturn to the candidate by electronic mail; \nc.  Sign the petition by inserting an electronic image of the voter’s actual signature \non an electronic copy of the petition page where a voter signature is intended to \nbe placed and return to the candidate, either by mail or electronically; or  \nd.  Sign the petition by using a stylus or other similar device to insert an electronic \nimage of a voter’s actual signature on an electronic copy of the petition page \nwhere a voter signature is intended to be placed and return to the candidate, again \neither by mail or electronically.  \n-14- \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 16 of 116\n45.  Remote notarizations also can now be used to the extent a petition must be \nnotarized because it is signed by more than one registered voter.  \n46.  Once a candidate has collected the required number of signatures in the manner \ndescribed above, the candidate then compiles all signatures received via electronic or regular mail \nand can submit them directly to the Registrar of Voters, either by regular or electronic mail. \n47.  Given all of the above, it should not be difficult for any candidate to obtain the \nrequired number of signatures.  Again, the signature requirements are extremely modest, ranging \nfrom between just 9 and 352 for State Representative, between 72 and 1,233 for State Senate, and \nbetween 2,597 and 6,591 for Representative in Congress. \n48.  Candidates have just under two and a half weeks to collect their required signatures \nusing the procedures authorized by the Order.  Those procedures do not require candidates or \ncirculators to stand outside of public places or go knocking on doors, although candidates still may \ndo so as long as they comply with the social distancing requirements in place at the time.  For \nexample, candidates could, if they so choose, go door to door with an IPad with cellular service, \nknock and stand an appropriate distance back, and ask the person to sign a petition form that the \ncandidate will leave at the residence without any in person contact.  Or if such an approach \nconcerns some voters, the candidate could ask to email the voter a petition form to be signed and \nreturned later.  The candidate would then have the voter’s email address and could follow up \nwith the voter if they do not send in a signed petition page.  Even if it is not as efficient as before, \ngathering signatures through traditional methods should still be possible for diligent candidates \nas long as they are careful and take appropriate precautions. \n49.  That is especially true given that candidates can procure a list of eligible party \nmembers from SOTS or the Registrar of Voters and specifically target those voters.  This greatly \n-15- \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 17 of 116\nreduces the number of extra signatures that a candidate must obtain.  In my experience, using \nexisting lists of enrolled party members that are readily available from local Registrars of Voters \ncan make a petition drive much more efficient. \n50.  Plaintiffs speculate that voters will not be willing to participate in these traditional \npetitioning methods given the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures in place.  \nHowever, I have reviewed Plaintiffs’ declarations in this case, ECF Nos. 9-2 through 9-4, and \nthere is nothing in those declarations to suggest that any Plaintiff has even attempted to collect \nsignatures during this election cycle using traditional methods.  As a result, their fears are based \non nothing more than speculation and conjecture.  Nobody knows how voters will respond to \ntraditional  petition  gathering  methods  in  these  times  if  candidates  are  careful  and  take \nappropriate precautions. \n51.  Even if Plaintiffs are correct that in person signature gathering will not be possible in \nthe current climate, that is not their only option.  Rather, candidates can now quickly and easily \nreach a much larger number of prospective registered voters—in a much shorter amount of time and \nwith significantly less effort, funding and volunteer resources—by skipping the door knocking and \nsimply posting the petition forms on the candidate’s or the Party’s website, posting them on the \ncandidate’s or the Party’s various social media pages, by sending emails to the Party’s own list of \nenrolled members, or by emailing a broader distribution list of registered voters that the Party or \ncandidate may obtain from other sources.  Reasonably diligent candidates can obtain both a list of \nenrolled party members as well as email addresses of those party members.  Lists of enrolled party \nmembers for the district and towns for which a candidate is seeking office are available from a \nvariety of sources, including SOTS, the Registrars of Voters, and private companies.  Using these \nlists will virtually eliminate the need to gather excess signatures on any petition drive.  A perfect \n-16- \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 18 of 116\nexample of this is the David Stemmerman Campaign for Governor in 2018.  His competitors \ncollected in excess of 12,000 signatures, but Mr. Stemmerman collect just 7,000 because he targeted \nhis efforts at voters on the Party’s enrolled member list. \n52.  Further,  candidates  can  enlist  unlimited  volunteers  to  assist  with  all  of  these \nactivities, including volunteers or paid consultants with experience on social media and other \nelectronic platforms.  Those volunteers can be of any age and can come from any location within or \noutside the State.  These are significantly easier methods of petitioning than existed before, and \nthere is no reason why a reasonably diligent candidate with a modicum of support could not collect \nthe small number of signatures required for the offices for which they seek ballot access.  \n53.  Plaintiffs also complain in their papers that the more generous signature gathering \nmechanisms provided by the Order still are not workable.  But they again base that complaint on \nnothing  more  than  abstract  speculation  and  conjecture  about  how  they  personally  think  the \nprocedures will be costly and cumbersome.  They provide no indication about how much it will cost \nto conduct a petition drive using these methods, and provide no evidence about how successful \nonline or mail-in petition drives are generally, much less in the particular context of a grassroots \nelection campaign.  Moreover, they once again give no indication that they have even thought about \nhow an effective electronic or mailing petition drive could be conducted, much less attempted to \nimplement one.  I do not understand how Plaintiffs can credibly claim that the procedures impose \ntoo severe a burden on their rights when they have not even attempted or planned to comply with \nthem. \n54.  Contrary to Plaintiffs’ unsubstantiated fears, I would fully expect that a grassroots \neffort with engaged campaign volunteers emailing petition forms to friends, family and other \npersonal contacts in the district, which contacts could then pass on the petition forms to their \n-17- \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 19 of 116\nown friends, family and contacts at no additional cost or effort to the candidate, would be an \neffective way to gather signatures in a short amount of time.  And that does not even begin to \naccount for other grassroots petition efforts that candidates can now engage in through social \nmedia and direct mailing. \n55.  This is especially true for candidates, like Mr. Bartlett, who have a history of \nrunning for and being elected to public office.  Indeed, Mr. Bartlett himself claims that he “is one \nof the most sophisticated political operatives in the state.”  ECF No. 9-1 at 4.  Mr. Bartlett’s \nhistory of electoral success as a candidate, and also with gathering signatures as a campaign \nmanager for numerous campaigns, illustrates that he has long term support, experience and \nrelationships with both voters and officials within the Democratic Party.  Presumably he could \nleverage those relationships and connections to conduct an effective signature drive even in these \ndifficult times.  \n56.  For example, Mr. Bartlett has 16 days to collect the required 1,028 signatures \nthrough any of the methods authorized by the Order, including by direct mail, electronically or in \nperson.  If you divide the 1,028 signatures by 16, that means that he would have to collect on \naverage 64 signatures a day.  If Mr. Bartlett has just 10 volunteers helping him get signatures—\nwhether in person, by emailing friends, family and other contacts, or through any of the other \nelectronic and social media methods discussed above—that would mean that each volunteer \nwould only have to acquire 6.4 signatures a day.  For somebody who claims to be “one of the \nmost sophisticated political operatives in the state” and who presumably has a wide base of \npotential supporters to call upon to help gather signatures, ECF No. 9-1, at 4, if he is diligent he \nshould be able to acquire that many signatures with the assistance of 10 or more volunteers.   \n-18- \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 20 of 116\n57.  In fact, I am aware of testimony in prior litigation challenging Connecticut’s \nelection laws in which a candidate and experienced signature gatherer testified that individuals \nwith experience circulating petitions can collect about 8 to 10 signatures per hour using the more \nburdensome and time consuming in person collection methods.  That being the case, there is no \nreason why a reasonably diligent candidate should not be able to collect at least that many \nsignatures  using  all  of  the  various  methods  authorized  by  the  Order  and  the  Secretary’s \nGuidance, even under current conditions.   \nVI.  The State’s Interest In Requiring Petition Forms To Be Submitted By June \n11, 2020 \n \n58.  Finally, in addition to challenging the new signature gathering procedures authorized \nby the Order, I am aware that Plaintiffs also challenge the 16 day window that the Order provides to \ncollect those signatures.  The State has a strong interest in maintaining that window in order to \nensure orderly elections, and extending it beyond the two days it already has been extended could \nsignificantly interfere with the broader election calendar. \n59.  Specifically, the state election calendar is defined by state statute and is developed \nby providing a series of date certains that are calculated using dates for both the general and \nprimary elections.  Built into these deadlines and dates are necessary windows of time that allow \nSOTS and local election officials to complete the necessary tasks that allow for the verification \nand placement of candidates on the ballot.  For example, using August 11, 2020 as the state \nprimary date, the following statutorily imposed deadlines are necessary to allow sufficient time \nfor the processing of primary petitions and placing candidates on the ballot: \na.  June  11, 2020 is the  deadline  for  submission of  primary petitions  pursuant to \nExecutive Order 7LL. \n-19- \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 21 of 116\nb.  Local Registrars of Voters must submit verified signature pages to SOTS by June \n18, 2020.  By statute, therefore, this means that the local Registrars of Voters only \nhave 7 days to check any signatures that are filed with them by June 11, 2020.  It \nis important to remember that these dates are not set to accommodate the smallest \nof the offices on the ballot, but are set to accommodate the largest offices such as \nstatewide offices where candidates collect tens of thousands of signatures.  The \nRegistrars require sufficient time to review all of those signatures by the statutory \ndeadline. \nc.  Military and overseas ballots become available on June 27, 2020.  This date is set \nby both state statute and federal law.  Because SOTS does not receive the verified \nsignatures from the Registrars until June 18, this means that SOTS only has 9 \ndays to receive, review and calculate the signature totals of all statewide and \ndistrict  offices  contested  by  primary  petition  and  to  report  back  to  each \nmunicipality those candidates who have successfully obtained ballot access.  This \nalso must be done in enough time to allow the local officials to prepare the \nmilitary and overseas ballots that will be issued to those applicants.   \nd.  Regular absentee ballots become available on July 21, 2020.  Once military and \noverseas ballots are sent by the local officials, they must immediately begin the \npreparation of regular absentee ballots.  This means that they must design and \nprepare the absentee ballot consistent with the requirements of state law and also \nprovide  the  selected  printer  enough  time  to  print  the  appropriate  number  of \nabsentee ballots for each municipality and then package and deliver such ballots \nback to each municipality.  This step is important because absentee ballots must \n-20- \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 22 of 116\nbe  identical to the bnllots used at  the polling places on August 11, 2020.  This \nmeans that the entire bnllot to be used  in the August primary must be essentially \nset in stone by July 21, 2020. \n60.  SOTS and  local election officials use and require all of the available time in the \nelection calendar discussed above.  Further, it bears emphasis that not only do state and local \nelection officials use this time, but they have to build enough time into the election calendar to \nensure that all of the paper ballots can be printed early enough to be used in the State's paper \nballot voting system, and that there is enough time to program and test each voting machine to \nread any printed ballot.  Extending the deadline for candidates to submit signatures beyond the 2 \ndays it already has been extended could have a significant impact on election officials' ability to \nmeet the rest of statutory deadlines in the election calendar. \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, I, Theodore Bromley, state under penalty of perjury that the \nforegoing declaration is true and accurate to the best ofmy knowledge, information and belief. \nL  Thei:£.~ \nExecuted: June  2020 \nDirector of Elections, \nOffice of Secretary of the State \n-21-\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 23 of 116\n \nEXHIBIT A \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 24 of 116\nAMENDMENT \nSection 2:  Composition of State Central Committee Members \nB.

and \n \nWHEREAS, pursuant to such declaration, I have issued thirty-eight (38) executive orders to \nsuspend or modify statutes and to take other actions necessary to protect public health and safety \nand to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; and \n \nWHEREAS, COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that spreads easily from person to person and \nmay result in serious illness or death; and \n \nWHEREAS, the World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic; \nand \n \nWHEREAS, the risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19 is higher for individuals who \nare 60 or older and for those who have chronic health conditions; and \n \nWHEREAS, to reduce the spread of COVID-19, the United States Centers for Disease Control \nand  Prevention  and  the  Connecticut  Department  of  Public  Health  (DPH)  recommend \nimplementation of community mitigation strategies to increase slow transmission of the virus, \nincluding cancellation of gatherings of ten people or more and social distancing in smaller \ngatherings; and \n \nWHEREAS, public health experts have determined that it is possible to transmit COVID-19 even \nbefore a person shows symptoms and through aerosol transmission; and \n \nWHEREAS, there exists a compelling interest in reducing the risk of transmission of COVID-19 \namong candidates seeking election, their supporters who are seeking to contact potential voters \nand the public at large; and  \n \nWHEREAS, the process of qualifying for ballot access through in-person petitioning as required \nunder Title 9 of the General Statutes is a basic and vital requirement of our state constitution and \nour election laws, the purpose of which is to ensure that voters have the opportunity to choose \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 28-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 98 of 116\namong viable candidates who have qualified for the ballot based on a minimum threshold of \nsupport, and to promote an election that is orderly, fair and transparent; and \n \nWHEREAS, the COVID-19 pandemic may make it more difficult for candidates to meet the \nexisting statutory petitioning requirements because fewer people are going outside or to public \nplaces and some people may be less willing to have in-person interactions with candidates or their \nsupporters; and \n \nWHEREAS, reducing the number of in-person interactions that might otherwise occur if no \nmodifications were made to the existing petitioning statutes may help further reduce the potential \ntransmission of COVID-19 during the ongoing public health emergency; \n \nNOW, THEREFORE, I, NED LAMONT, Governor of the State of Connecticut, by virtue of the \nauthority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the State of Connecticut, do hereby \nORDER AND DIRECT for purposes of primary and general elections conducted in 2020: \n \n1.

Plaintiffs request an audience with this Court as soon \nas possible to address this matter of paramount constitutional importance. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 State of Connecticut, By His Excellency Ned Lamont, Executive Order No. 7LL (May 11, \n2020), available at https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Office-of-the-Governor/Executive-\nOrders/Lamont-Executive-Orders/Executive-Order-No-7LL.pdf?la=en (last acc. May 12, 2020). \n  1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-1   Filed 05/12/20   Page 2 of 12\n  Petitions will be made available for candidates by Defendant Merrill beginning May 26 \nand candidates will be given only 16 days to collect signatures under Defendant Lamont’s order. \nTime is therefore particularly of the essence as to Plaintiff’s First Claim regarding ballot access \nfor the August 11, 2020 primary election. The key facts in support of this motion are verified as \nset forth in the attached executed Affidavits and Expert Reports of Plaintiffs, Andy Gottlieb \n(Exhibit A), Jason W. Bartlett (Exhibit B), and Richard Lacourciere (Exhibit C).  \nARGUMENT \n  Plaintiffs respectfully submit that the four well-settled factors for consideration of a \npreliminary injunction, Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008), weigh \nheavily in their favor, as follows. \n1.  Plaintiffs are Highly Likely to Succeed on the Merits of Their First Claim, \nBecause This Case is Essentially Indistinguishable from Campbell v. \nBysiewicz                   \n \n  Almost twenty years ago this Court held that Connecticut’s “15%-delegate-vote rule,” \nthen the only method for candidates to gain access to the primary ballot for state offices, “far \nexceeds a means to a legitimate end, the screening out of candidates who lack a significant \nmodicum of support,” Campbell v. Bysiewicz, 213 F.Supp.2d 152, 157 (D.Conn. July 23, 2002) \n(Dorsey, J.), finding that “[t]his system ha[d] systematically denied Connecticut voters over the \nlast 47 years a direct primary for district and state offices,” Id. Without this Court’s immediate \naction Connecticut voters will again be systematically denied their First Amendment free \nassociational rights by requirements that again far exceed any legitimate State interest, and again \nserve only to insulate incumbent officeholders from legitimate competition. \n  The legislature’s remedy for the constitutional violation identified in Campbell was \nPublic Act 03-241, effective January 1, 2004, creating another method for candidates to gain \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-1   Filed 05/12/20   Page 3 of 12\naccess to the primary ballot: collecting in-person petition signatures. See Conn. Gen. Stat. Secs. \n9-404a-404c. It is highly doubtful that Public Act 03-241 was ever an adequate constitutional \nremedy for the violations identified in Campbell. See Exhibit A (Affidavit of Andy Gottlieb) at \n¶¶ 10 (“Gathering the valid signatures of five percent of all registered Democrats in my district is \na challenge, but it could be done. Doing so in an arbitrary two-week window in late May and \nearly June is what makes it nearly impossible.”), ¶ 1, 11-13 (candidate went door to door \n“nonstop in scorching heat and through torrential downpours” and rallied volunteers, but fell \nshort of the signatures required to qualify); see Campbell, 213 F.Supp.2d at 155 (testimony from \ncandidates of the “considerable effort to access the primary ballot . . . goes to show a \nburdensome primary ballot access system.”).  \nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic, as Defendant Lamont has admitted by issuing \nExecutive Order No. 7LL, supra note 1, the requirements in Public Act 03-241 are \nunquestionably an unconstitutionally undue severe burden on candidates’ and voters’ First \nAmendment rights to run for office and to vote for the candidate of their choice. Amended \nComplaint, ECF No. 8, at ¶¶ 3-7 (Defendant Lamont’s admissions of the extraordinary \ncircumstances). Defendant Lamont’s cumbersome new executive order, id. at ¶¶ 8-13, however, \nfails to remedy the First Amendment harm that motivated it, and continues to inflict a severe \nundue burden on the First Amendment rights of Plaintiffs and all Connecticut voters. Id. at ¶¶ 8-\n13, 33-37, 57-59. \nAs Mr. Gottlieb’s affidavit and report demonstrates, Defendant Lamont’s new executive \norder fails even to “begin to address the magnitude of the present situation,” Ex. A at ¶ 22, the \napplication of Public Act 03-241 to the COVID-19 pandemic. A Democratic candidate in Mr. \nGottlieb’s senate district would need to collect over 700 valid signatures from registered \n  3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-1   Filed 05/12/20   Page 4 of 12\nDemocrats to qualify for the ballot. Id. at ¶ 23. The number will be significantly higher in \ndistricts with more Democrats, like Mr. Bartlett’s. Id. As Mr. Gottlieb notes, the order would \nrequire petition signers “to print out, sign, scan, and email the petition,” which would exclude \n“all but the most determined and well-resourced voters,” id. at ¶ 28, or require mailing a form \nback and forth in the U.S. Mail, which will be an undue severe burden at least unless Secretary \nMerrill sends every voter a self-addressed stamped envelope as she is planning to do for absentee \nballot application forms, id. at ¶ 29.  \nMr. Gottlieb – who has knowledge, training, and experience running a petition signature \ndrive, id. at ¶¶ 5-9 – concludes that it is “completely impossible” to access the ballot using the \nmechanism created by Defendant Lamont’s executive order, id. at ¶ 24. The severity of the \nrestrictions, such as the mere two-day extension to use the order’s cumbersome new mechanism \nintroduced yesterday, id., causes Mr. Gottlieb to conclude, reasonably, that the purpose of the \norder was “to exclude those disfavored by the party establishment.” ¶ 25. He further concludes \nthat a reasonable system would require fewer signatures with more time to obtain them, ¶ 26, \nobtained through a web form created by the Secretary that is straightforward and secure, ¶ 30.  \nMr. Lacourciere and Mr. Bartlett – candidates presently running for state representative \nin the 24th House District and state senator in the 10th Senate District, respectively – concur in \nMr. Gottlieb’s judgment regarding the severe violation of First Amendment rights imposed by \nDefendant Lamont’s order. Mr. Bartlett is one of the most sophisticated political operatives in \nthe state, with decades of success running petition signature drives. Ex. B at ¶ 9 (ran multiple \nsuccessful petition signature drives as campaign manager). However, as Plaintiff Bartlett \nconcludes in his affidavit and report, “[t]he executive order fails to provide a meaningful \n  4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-1   Filed 05/12/20   Page 5 of 12\nalternative” for accessing the ballot in the state party primary. Id. at ¶ 16. As Plaintiff Bartlett \nexplains: \nUnder the executive order, I would still need to obtain 3.5% of the registered \nmembers of the Democratic Party in my state senate district, a number that likely \nexceeds 1,000 registered Democrats. . . . [T]he voter to be either mailed a petition, or \nrequires candidates to email the petition to the voter, which is unlikely because voters’ \nemail addresses are rarely provided in applications to register to vote and are therefore \nnot public information. The voter must then sign and mail the petition back to the \ncandidate, or print and sign the petition then upload the petition by photograph or \nscanner to their computer and email it back to the candidate. The candidate must then \nprint out all of the emails and petitions, one petition and the email that it came with per \nvoter,  to  the  registrar  of  voters  of  the  voter’s  municipality.  This  new  process  is \ncumbersome and costly and the executive order only gives two additional days to \ncomplete it. \n[And] [u]nlike applications for absentee ballots, which are being mailed to every \nvoter by the Secretary of the State, petitions will not be mailed to any voters. . . .  \nPetitions are routinely circulated online through websites such as Change.org but \nGovernor Lamont’s order requires people to not only have computers, but also printers \nand scanners. The total number of steps and new paperwork created by the Governor’s \nnew order will increase the time spent by either candidates going door-to-door to canvas \nfor the signatures, volunteers, or voters leaving their homes to print or scan documents. \n. . .  \nGiven my knowledge, training, and experience running campaigns and collecting \nsignatures, I can easily conclude within a reasonable degree of professional certainty \nthat unless the number of signatures required is capped at 500, and a substantial amount \nof additional time is provided, there is essentially no way that anyone will qualify for \nthe ballot under the Governor’s cumbersome new system for collecting signatures. It is \nabsurd, and demonstrates that the Governor has little concern for candidates’ and voters’ \nFirst Amendment rights. \n \nId. at ¶¶ 16-20. Mr. Lacourciere, running for the office of state representative albeit a relative \nnewcomer to politics, agrees, see Ex. C, and concludes that a severe reduction in the number of \nsignatures and a significant expansion of the amount of time required to obtain them is needed to \nprotect voters’ and candidates’ constitutional rights to meaningful democratic participation. Id. at \n¶¶ 7-8. \nWithout meaningful alternatives to the party convention system, the present case is \nessentially indistinguishable with Campbell v. Bysiewicz: effectively, once again, “[t]o get on a \n  5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-1   Filed 05/12/20   Page 6 of 12\npolitical party's primary ballot for state or district offices, a candidate must either receive the \npolitical party endorsement or else obtain at least 15% of the delegate votes to that political \nparty's state or district convention.” 213 F.Supp.2d at 153. No other option at all existed then; no \nrealistic option exists now. Thus, this Court must once again act to safeguard First Amendment \nrights by entering a preliminary injunction.  \nThe record observations of the district court in Campbell – that, inter alia, only one \nperson ever successfully navigated the convention delegate system against an incumbent \ncongressperson, senator, governor, or secretary of the state in 47 years of modern democracy – \nare directly applicable to this case, where once again the convention delegate system will be the \nonly meaningful method for candidates to access the August 11, 2020 primary ballot for \ncongress, state senate, or state representative, absent action by this Court. The district court’s \nobservations “strongly suggest[ed] an overly burdensome primary ballot access system” then, id. \nat 156, and they still do now.  \nIn light of Plaintiffs’ “sufficient and persuasive evidence of an overly burdensome \nsystem,” 213 F.Supp.2d at 157, the governor’s executive order must be considered “severe” \nrestrictions, which “must be narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling \nimportance.” Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992). \n  In Campbell, the state offered “no real analysis in support” of the convention-delegate \nsystem for ballot access. 213 F.Supp.2d at 156. Defendant Lamont’s executive order puts forth \ntwo possible interests in the continued severity of Connecticut’s ballot access restrictions: \nensuring “viable” candidates qualify for the ballot “based on a minimum threshold of support,” \nand “to promote an election that is orderly, fair and transparent.” See supra note 1 at pp. 1-2. But \nthe Defendant’s executive order, like the statutory scheme in Campbell, “far exceeds a means to \n  6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-1   Filed 05/12/20   Page 7 of 12\na legitimate end, the screening out of candidates who lack a significant modicum of support,” \n213 F.Supp.2d at 157, and instead imposes an overly severe restriction on Plaintiffs’ and all \nvoters First Amendment rights.  \nThe restrictions imposed by Defendant Lamont’s executive order are far more severe than \nnecessary to guarantee a significant modicum of support. Defendant Lamont’s executive order \nfails to justify the severity of the restrictions – requiring 3.5% of party members’ signatures to be \ncollected in 16 days under a cumbersome new mechanism without a direct online portal – by any \ncompelling state interest. Defendants, meanwhile, will be unable to show that the relief requested \nby Plaintiffs would “encumber the ballot with the names of frivolous candidates,” allow \n“distortion of the electoral process by the device of ‘party raiding,’” or that the restrictions on \naccess are related to any other legitimate state goals. Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 788 \nn.9 (giving examples of legitimate reasons for restrictions). As in Campbell, “[v]oters \ncomprising a candidate’s significant modicum of support should not be disenfranchised by an \noverly burdensome primary ballot process that bars their candidate from appearing on the \nprimary ballot.” 213 F.Supp.2d at 157. \nPlaintiffs have shown that significant numbers of voters would be disenfranchised by \nConnecticut’s primary ballot access process which, absent this Court’s action, will likely bar \nthem both from appearing on the primary ballot and from voting for the full range of candidates \nof their choice. See generally Exhibits A-C. Plaintiffs therefore show a very high likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of their First Claim. \n2.  Plaintiffs are Suffering, and Will Continue to Suffer, Harm to their First \nAmendment Rights if the Injunction is Denied, Harm That is Severe and \nIrreparable                   \nThe severe restrictions imposed by Connecticut’s ballot access requirements are causing \nat least three forms of irreparable harm to Plaintiffs, Connecticut candidates and voters.  \n  7 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-1   Filed 05/12/20   Page 8 of 12\nFirst, as shown in Mr. Gottlieb’s affidavit, they harm Plaintiffs as potential candidates, \nby deterring them from running for office in the first place, even if they desire to do so and have \na significant modicum of support. Exhibit A at ¶ 6 (“I’ve been asked many times since my 2018 \nstate senate campaign whether I will ever run again. I always say, ‘Yes I will! I just don’t know \nwhen I might be able to get on the ballot.’”). This “chilling” of the right to speak, petition, and \nrun for office is cognizable First Amendment injury of the utmost importance justifying entrance \nof declaratory relief and a preliminary injunction. \nSecond, also shown in Mr. Gottlieb’s affidavit, the restrictions harm Plaintiffs as voters, \nby restricting the number of candidates to choose from and denying voters the ability to vote for \ncandidates of their choice. Exhibit A at ¶¶ 15-16 (“I’m a registered Democrat in a blue state who \nvotes a straight-party ticket in November . . . But in the four state elections I’ve been eligible to \nvote in since I turned 18, not once has there been a primary in either my state representative or \nmy state senate district.”); ¶ 20 (“Collecting signatures moves from nearly impossible to \nabsolutely impossible under social distancing measures, . . . .”). Ms. Chand is also a Plaintiff \nbeing denied her rights as a voter. The injury to voters from overly restrictive ballot access \nrequirements is cognizable First Amendment injury. See Rockefeller v. Powers, 74 F.3d 1367 (2d \nCir. 1995) (voters have standing to challenge ballot access requirements). \nThird, as shown in Mr. Bartlett and Mr. Lacourciere’s affidavits, the restrictions harm \nPlaintiffs if they choose to run for office, as Mr. Bartlett and Mr. Lacourciere have, as \ncandidates, because for candidates who are not incumbent officeholders, no available method for \nqualifying for the ballot is practicable under the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic. This \ninjury is compounded every day because any ballot access method takes time to plan for and \norganize. Even with the governor’s new executive order, the ballot access requirements under \n  8 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-1   Filed 05/12/20   Page 9 of 12\nConnecticut state law continue to place a severe undue burden on candidates seeking to qualify \nfor the primary ballot, as explained supra, pp. 2-7. These harms are irreparable and Plaintiffs \nhave no adequate remedy at law, because, as it is well-settled, harms to their First Amendment \nrights cannot be repaired by money damages. \n “[T]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, \nunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.” Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976); \nMurphy v. Zoning Comm’n of the Village of New Milford, 148 F.Supp.2d 173, 180-81 (D. Conn. \n2001). Plaintiffs are suffering irreparable damage because candidates who would challenge \nincumbent public officials will not run for office—or even if they do, like Mr. Bartlett and Mr. \nLacourciere, qualifying for the ballot will be impossible. Plaintiffs are also suffering as voters, \nbecause they will be unable to choose from a full range of candidates when they cast their \nballots. \nPlaintiffs’ irreparable injury will only compound as the petitions are issued on May 26, \nthe petitioning deadline approaches 16 days later on June 11, and the August 11, 2020 primary \ncomes closer. Plaintiffs have reached out to Defendants to confer about settlement, but have been \ntold that in light of the executive order they now have no other recourse than this Court. At some \npoint, as this Court has observed, there no longer is “sufficient time to permit Plaintiffs access to \nthe ballot.” Campbell, 213 F.Supp.2d at 159 (rejecting state’s argument there was insufficient \ntime as of July 23 to permit access for September 10 primary). Plaintiffs seek immediate action \nnow to prevent, for example, ballots from needing to be re-printed should this case take weeks or \nlonger to resolve. \n \n \n  9 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-1   Filed 05/12/20   Page 10 of 12\n3.  The Balance of the Harms Favors Plaintiffs Because They Will Be Severely \nHarmed Without Action by This Court, and They Request Readily Available \nRelief from Defendants                 \n \nAny speculative harm to the Defendants is far outweighed by the harm that the Plaintiffs \nwould suffer by being deprived of their constitutional freedoms to petition and to speak, in the \ndistinct ways identified above and in their affidavits and expert reports. \nInjunctive and declaratory relief here, meanwhile, would simply require Defendants to \nmake reasonable modifications to their election procedures in light of the pandemic as a number \nof states have voluntarily done.  \nThis Court can take notice that, as demonstrated by other states, there is minimal burden \nassociated with protecting the rights of petition and speech in this case: \nThe Arizona Secretary of State has provided an online petitioning mechanism for \ncandidates since 2015;2 \nOn March 19, 2020, the Governor of New Jersey issued an executive order to the \nSecretary of State to implement online petitioning and signature collection;3 \nOn April 2, 2020 Florida’s Secretary of State signed an emergency order allowing for the \ncollection of petition signatures online;4 \nIt is evident, therefore, that narrowly-tailored options that protect both the health of the \ngeneral public as well as their constitutional rights are readily available and have been \nimplemented without any harm to any legitimate State interests. Thus far, however, Connecticut \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n2 Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Commission, E-Qual, available at \nhttps://www.azcleanelections.gov/E-Qual. \n3 New Jersey Executive Order No. 105, available at \nhttps://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/assets/pdf/candidate/EO-105.pdf \n4 Florida Certification of Department of State Emergency Rule, 11SER20-2 – Candidate Petition \nProcess, available at https://dos.myflorida.com/media/702874/1ser20-2.pdf \n  10 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-1   Filed 05/12/20   Page 11 of 12\nhas failed to follow suit, which this Court can and should remedy. Plaintiffs’ relief is therefore \nreasonable in light of the impossibility of gathering in-person petition signatures and the balance \nof the harms favors Plaintiffs.  \n4.  Granting the Relief Requested Will Serve the Public Interest, Because \nVindicating First Aendment Rights is Always in the Public Interest   \n     \n“Vindicating First Amendment freedoms is clearly in the public interest.” Pacific \nFrontier v. Pleasant Grove City, 414 F.3d 1221, 1237 (10th Cir. 2005). See also Am. Civil \nLiberties Union of Georgia v. Miller, 977 F.Supp. 1228, 1235 (N.D. Ga. 1997) (“No long string \nof citations is necessary to find that the public interest weighs in favor of having access to a free \nflow of constitutionally protected speech.”) (quotation and citation omitted). “[I]njunctions \nprotecting First Amendment freedoms are always in the public interest.” Am. Civil Liberties \nUnion of Illinois v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583, 590 (7th Cir. 2012).  \n“The impact of candidate eligibility requirements on voters implicates basic \nconstitutional rights.” Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 786 (1983). “The exclusion of \ncandidates also burdens voters’ freedom of association, because an election campaign is an \neffective platform for the expression of views on the issues of the day, and a candidate serves as \na rallying point for likeminded citizens.” Id. at 787-88. “The right to associate with the political \nparty of one’s choice is an integral part of . . . basic constitutional freedom.” Tashjian v. \nRepublican Party of Conn., 479 U.S. 208, 214 (1986). The right to “the political franchise of \nvoting . . . is regarded as a fundamental political right, because [it is] preservative of all rights.” \nYick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 370 (1886). \nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons stated above, Plaintiffs motion should be granted, and an order in the \nnature of the relief requested in the Motion, at pp. 2-3 (prayer for relief), should be issued.  \n  11 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-1   Filed 05/12/20   Page 12 of 12\nDated: May 12, 2020        Respectfully Submitted, \nPLAINTIFFS, ANDY GOTTLIEB, \nLORNA CHAND, JASON BARTLETT, \nAND RICHARD LACOURCIERE, FOR \nTHEMSELVES AND THE PROPOSED \nCLASS OF CONNECTICUT VOTERS   \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nBy:_____/s/_______________ \nAlexander T.

I am 26 years old and a registered Connecticut voter in Guilford. \n2.  I bring this case because Connecticut’s ballot access laws, even with Governor \nLamont’s new executive order, place an undue burden on candidates seeking access to the primary \nballot and on voters seeking to vote for the candidate of their choice. \n3.  Connecticut’s ballot access laws placed severe burdens on the rights of candidates \nand voters before COVID-19. Before COVID-19, even candidates with a significant modicum of \nsupport were confronted with very substantial obstacles in obtaining access to the ballot. The \nthreshold was much more difficult to surmount than is reasonably necessary to achieve the \nlegitimate purpose of screening out candidates with no real support and systematically denied \nConnecticut voters the chance to be heard.  \n4.  Now, with COVID-19, the magnitude of the burdens placed by Connecticut’s ballot \naccess laws have increased even further, and Governor Lamont’s new executive order fails to begin \nto address the magnitude of the present situation. Thus, as a potential candidate for office and as a \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-2   Filed 05/12/20   Page 2 of 6\nConnecticut voter, I feel compelled to bring this action, and the urgency of this matter compels me \nto urge this Court’s issuance of an emergency order. In this affidavit, I explain why I am bringing \nthis case and why I believe it requires immediate action by this Honorable Court. \nA.  Potential Candidate \n5.  As alleged in the Complaint in this action, I ran for the office of state senate in \n2018, and fell just short of the signatures required to qualify for the primary ballot. In 2018, the \nseat was vacant – an “open seat” – but the seat is now occupied by an incumbent Democrat. \n6.  I’ve been asked many times since my 2018 state senate campaign whether I will \never run again. I always say, “Yes, I will! I just don’t know when I might be able to get on the \nballot.” Given that it was next-to-impossible to run for even an open seat, I know that running \nagainst an incumbent would be even more quixotic.  \n7.  Being denied ballot access is not an easy loss to accept, precisely because it’s not \neven a defeat. It feels more like one’s candidacy is put in suspended animation, with voters never \ngetting to weigh in one way or another.  \n8.  As heartbreaking as it would be, I could accept defeat at the polls, because that \nwould have democratic legitimacy. But Connecticut’s ballot access laws make a mockery of those \nideals. A group of party insiders selecting a group of party insiders to be delegates to decide on \nthe nominee (knowing that whoever doesn’t make the cut will be thrown to the wolves in the \npetition process) echoes the worst of closed political systems. \n9.  As far as I can tell, the state has an interest in ensuring that only serious candidates \nmake it onto the ballot. I understand and agree with that proposition, but Connecticut’s laws go \nwell beyond that of almost any other state. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-2   Filed 05/12/20   Page 3 of 6\n10.  Gathering the valid signatures of five percent of all registered Democrats in my \ndistrict is a hefty challenge, but it could be done. Doing so in an arbitrary two-week window in \nlate May and early June is what makes it nearly impossible. Again, I can understand why the state \nwould have a deadline to turn in signatures, but I will never grasp the rational basis of having a \nstart date a mere fourteen days beforehand.  \n11.  In  most  other  states,  I  would  be  given  months  to  gather  such  a  quantity  of \nsignatures. I did my utmost to meet the requirements in 2018, knocking on thousands of doors, \nalong with my volunteers. I certainly demonstrated the earnestness of my candidacy. \n12.  I (rather dangerously) lost seven pounds over two weeks of nonstop petitioning, \ngoing door to door in scorching heat and through torrential downpours.  \n13.  The overwhelming majority of people I spoke with were willing to sign, seeing \nballot access as essential to democracy. \nB.   Voter \n14.  I also believe the ballot access laws violate my rights as a voter.  \n15.  I’m a registered Democrat in a blue state who votes a straight-party ticket in \nNovember. My only real choice could come in a primary.  \n16.  But in the four state elections I’ve been eligible to vote in since I turned 18, not \nonce has there been a primary in either my state representative district or my state senate district.  \n17.  I know firsthand how difficult the process is, and I’m certain that more people \nwould step up to run (and succeed in doing so) if only a viable path existed to getting on the ballot. \n18.  I also desire a way to vote absentee without meeting one of the six narrow excuses \nallowed under current law. Voting is one of our most fundamental rights and should be accessible \nto all citizens, not dependent on one’s physical availability on a single day in August or November. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-2   Filed 05/12/20   Page 4 of 6\nC.  Urgency \n19.  The indefensibility of Connecticut’s ballot access and absentee voting laws has \nbeen brought to the fore by the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n20.  Collecting signatures moves from nearly impossible to absolutely impossible under \nsocial distancing measures, closing off any avenue to candidates not backed at party conventions. \nSimilarly, voting in person goes against social distancing measures. Common sense dictates that \nvoting by mail is the only safe way to conduct an election in the near future.  \n21.  While I was prepared earlier to give the state time to respond to our Complaint, \nafter speaking with Jason Bartlett about the unfair pressures his candidacy is facing due to ballot \naccess uncertainty, I believe that action is required immediately to give candidates a reasonable \nmethod of attaining a spot in their primary. \nD.  The Governor’s New Executive Order \n22.  Reducing the number of signatures by 30% and adding two days to the petition \nperiod does not begin to address the magnitude of the present situation. \n23.  A  Democratic  candidate  in  my  senate  district,  for  instance,  would  still  need \napproximately 700 valid signatures to make the primary ballot. This would be substantially more \nin a district with higher concentrations of registered Democrats, such as the 10th Senate District \nwhere Jason Bartlett is running. \n24.  Corralling  that  many  registered  voters  without  going  door-to-door  would  be \nextraordinarily difficult; a mere 16 days to collect that many signatures under fast-changing \ncircumstances would be completely impossible. Requiring it is completely irrational.  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-2   Filed 05/12/20   Page 5 of 6\n25.  I cannot comprehend why Governor Lamont would insist on such a high standard \nfor a candidate to make the primary ballot, except to exclude those disfavored by the party \nestablishment. \n26.  A reasonable standard would be at least a month to gather petition signatures, along \nwith a reduction of the needed signatures by at least 80% or simply a fixed number of signatures, \nsuch as 100 for state senate candidates and 50 for state representative candidates. This would be \nsufficient to prove that the candidate has a significant modicum of voter support.  \n27.  The use of electronic signatures could ameliorate the burden somewhat, but the \nexecutive order makes it as cumbersome as possible. \n28.  Requiring potential petition signers to print out, sign, scan, and email the petition \nform puts the process out of reach for all but the most determined and well-resourced voters.  \n29.  The only other option, of mailing in the form, also places an undue burden on the \nvoter – unless Secretary Merrill decides to send every registered voter a petition form with a self-\naddressed stamped envelope, as she is planning on doing for absentee ballot application forms. \n30.  A reasonable standard would be for the Secretary to set up a web form, similar to \nthe very successful one already used for registering to vote or checking a voter’s registration. A \nvoter could simply type in their name, town, and birthdate, and be presented with a dropdown of \npetitioning candidates in their district. The voter could then select which candidates they would \n“sign” for and submit directly to the Secretary. The procedure would be straightforward and secure.  \n31.  Keep in mind that party convention candidates’ delegates are being allowed to \nappear via Zoom to ratify their choices in this year’s conventions, and it is likely that no incumbent \noffice-holder in the State of Connecticut will be required to collect any petition signatures at all, \nbecause they will be nominated by the party convention.  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-2   Filed 05/12/20   Page 6 of 6\n32.  Each day that passes without action causes greater irreparable injury placing an \never-greater undue burden on candidates seeking access to the primary ballot and, by discouraging \nthem, on voters seeking to vote for the candidate of their choice. \n* * * \nI swear under penalty of perjury, pursuant to Title 28, § 1746 of the United States Code, \nthat the foregoing is true, correct, and within my personal knowledge. \n \n/s/Andy Gottlieb       \nAndy Gottlieb \nDated this 7th day of May, 2020 \n \nNOTARIZATION \n \nSubscribed to and sworn before me, this 11th day of May, 2020, through Communication \nTechnology pursuant to the terms of Governor Lamont’s Executive Order No. 7Q (3). \n \n/s/         \nAlexander T.

Plaintiffs request an audience with this Court as soon \nas possible to address this matter of paramount constitutional importance. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 State of Connecticut, By His Excellency Ned Lamont, Executive Order No. 7LL (May 11, \n2020), available at https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Office-of-the-Governor/Executive-\nOrders/Lamont-Executive-Orders/Executive-Order-No-7LL.pdf?la=en (last acc. May 12, 2020). \n  1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-1   Filed 05/12/20   Page 2 of 12\n  Petitions will be made available for candidates by Defendant Merrill beginning May 26 \nand candidates will be given only 16 days to collect signatures under Defendant Lamont’s order. \nTime is therefore particularly of the essence as to Plaintiff’s First Claim regarding ballot access \nfor the August 11, 2020 primary election. The key facts in support of this motion are verified as \nset forth in the attached executed Affidavits and Expert Reports of Plaintiffs, Andy Gottlieb \n(Exhibit A), Jason W. Bartlett (Exhibit B), and Richard Lacourciere (Exhibit C).  \nARGUMENT \n  Plaintiffs respectfully submit that the four well-settled factors for consideration of a \npreliminary injunction, Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008), weigh \nheavily in their favor, as follows. \n1.  Plaintiffs are Highly Likely to Succeed on the Merits of Their First Claim, \nBecause This Case is Essentially Indistinguishable from Campbell v. \nBysiewicz                   \n \n  Almost twenty years ago this Court held that Connecticut’s “15%-delegate-vote rule,” \nthen the only method for candidates to gain access to the primary ballot for state offices, “far \nexceeds a means to a legitimate end, the screening out of candidates who lack a significant \nmodicum of support,” Campbell v. Bysiewicz, 213 F.Supp.2d 152, 157 (D.Conn. July 23, 2002) \n(Dorsey, J.), finding that “[t]his system ha[d] systematically denied Connecticut voters over the \nlast 47 years a direct primary for district and state offices,” Id. Without this Court’s immediate \naction Connecticut voters will again be systematically denied their First Amendment free \nassociational rights by requirements that again far exceed any legitimate State interest, and again \nserve only to insulate incumbent officeholders from legitimate competition. \n  The legislature’s remedy for the constitutional violation identified in Campbell was \nPublic Act 03-241, effective January 1, 2004, creating another method for candidates to gain \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-1   Filed 05/12/20   Page 3 of 12\naccess to the primary ballot: collecting in-person petition signatures. See Conn. Gen. Stat. Secs. \n9-404a-404c. It is highly doubtful that Public Act 03-241 was ever an adequate constitutional \nremedy for the violations identified in Campbell. See Exhibit A (Affidavit of Andy Gottlieb) at \n¶¶ 10 (“Gathering the valid signatures of five percent of all registered Democrats in my district is \na challenge, but it could be done. Doing so in an arbitrary two-week window in late May and \nearly June is what makes it nearly impossible.”), ¶ 1, 11-13 (candidate went door to door \n“nonstop in scorching heat and through torrential downpours” and rallied volunteers, but fell \nshort of the signatures required to qualify); see Campbell, 213 F.Supp.2d at 155 (testimony from \ncandidates of the “considerable effort to access the primary ballot . . . goes to show a \nburdensome primary ballot access system.”).  \nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic, as Defendant Lamont has admitted by issuing \nExecutive Order No. 7LL, supra note 1, the requirements in Public Act 03-241 are \nunquestionably an unconstitutionally undue severe burden on candidates’ and voters’ First \nAmendment rights to run for office and to vote for the candidate of their choice. Amended \nComplaint, ECF No. 8, at ¶¶ 3-7 (Defendant Lamont’s admissions of the extraordinary \ncircumstances). Defendant Lamont’s cumbersome new executive order, id. at ¶¶ 8-13, however, \nfails to remedy the First Amendment harm that motivated it, and continues to inflict a severe \nundue burden on the First Amendment rights of Plaintiffs and all Connecticut voters. Id. at ¶¶ 8-\n13, 33-37, 57-59. \nAs Mr. Gottlieb’s affidavit and report demonstrates, Defendant Lamont’s new executive \norder fails even to “begin to address the magnitude of the present situation,” Ex. A at ¶ 22, the \napplication of Public Act 03-241 to the COVID-19 pandemic. A Democratic candidate in Mr. \nGottlieb’s senate district would need to collect over 700 valid signatures from registered \n  3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-1   Filed 05/12/20   Page 4 of 12\nDemocrats to qualify for the ballot. Id. at ¶ 23. The number will be significantly higher in \ndistricts with more Democrats, like Mr. Bartlett’s. Id. As Mr. Gottlieb notes, the order would \nrequire petition signers “to print out, sign, scan, and email the petition,” which would exclude \n“all but the most determined and well-resourced voters,” id. at ¶ 28, or require mailing a form \nback and forth in the U.S. Mail, which will be an undue severe burden at least unless Secretary \nMerrill sends every voter a self-addressed stamped envelope as she is planning to do for absentee \nballot application forms, id. at ¶ 29.  \nMr. Gottlieb – who has knowledge, training, and experience running a petition signature \ndrive, id. at ¶¶ 5-9 – concludes that it is “completely impossible” to access the ballot using the \nmechanism created by Defendant Lamont’s executive order, id. at ¶ 24. The severity of the \nrestrictions, such as the mere two-day extension to use the order’s cumbersome new mechanism \nintroduced yesterday, id., causes Mr. Gottlieb to conclude, reasonably, that the purpose of the \norder was “to exclude those disfavored by the party establishment.” ¶ 25. He further concludes \nthat a reasonable system would require fewer signatures with more time to obtain them, ¶ 26, \nobtained through a web form created by the Secretary that is straightforward and secure, ¶ 30.  \nMr. Lacourciere and Mr. Bartlett – candidates presently running for state representative \nin the 24th House District and state senator in the 10th Senate District, respectively – concur in \nMr. Gottlieb’s judgment regarding the severe violation of First Amendment rights imposed by \nDefendant Lamont’s order. Mr. Bartlett is one of the most sophisticated political operatives in \nthe state, with decades of success running petition signature drives. Ex. B at ¶ 9 (ran multiple \nsuccessful petition signature drives as campaign manager). However, as Plaintiff Bartlett \nconcludes in his affidavit and report, “[t]he executive order fails to provide a meaningful \n  4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-1   Filed 05/12/20   Page 5 of 12\nalternative” for accessing the ballot in the state party primary. Id. at ¶ 16. As Plaintiff Bartlett \nexplains: \nUnder the executive order, I would still need to obtain 3.5% of the registered \nmembers of the Democratic Party in my state senate district, a number that likely \nexceeds 1,000 registered Democrats. . . . [T]he voter to be either mailed a petition, or \nrequires candidates to email the petition to the voter, which is unlikely because voters’ \nemail addresses are rarely provided in applications to register to vote and are therefore \nnot public information. The voter must then sign and mail the petition back to the \ncandidate, or print and sign the petition then upload the petition by photograph or \nscanner to their computer and email it back to the candidate. The candidate must then \nprint out all of the emails and petitions, one petition and the email that it came with per \nvoter,  to  the  registrar  of  voters  of  the  voter’s  municipality.  This  new  process  is \ncumbersome and costly and the executive order only gives two additional days to \ncomplete it. \n[And] [u]nlike applications for absentee ballots, which are being mailed to every \nvoter by the Secretary of the State, petitions will not be mailed to any voters. . . .  \nPetitions are routinely circulated online through websites such as Change.org but \nGovernor Lamont’s order requires people to not only have computers, but also printers \nand scanners. The total number of steps and new paperwork created by the Governor’s \nnew order will increase the time spent by either candidates going door-to-door to canvas \nfor the signatures, volunteers, or voters leaving their homes to print or scan documents. \n. . .  \nGiven my knowledge, training, and experience running campaigns and collecting \nsignatures, I can easily conclude within a reasonable degree of professional certainty \nthat unless the number of signatures required is capped at 500, and a substantial amount \nof additional time is provided, there is essentially no way that anyone will qualify for \nthe ballot under the Governor’s cumbersome new system for collecting signatures. It is \nabsurd, and demonstrates that the Governor has little concern for candidates’ and voters’ \nFirst Amendment rights. \n \nId. at ¶¶ 16-20. Mr. Lacourciere, running for the office of state representative albeit a relative \nnewcomer to politics, agrees, see Ex. C, and concludes that a severe reduction in the number of \nsignatures and a significant expansion of the amount of time required to obtain them is needed to \nprotect voters’ and candidates’ constitutional rights to meaningful democratic participation. Id. at \n¶¶ 7-8. \nWithout meaningful alternatives to the party convention system, the present case is \nessentially indistinguishable with Campbell v. Bysiewicz: effectively, once again, “[t]o get on a \n  5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-1   Filed 05/12/20   Page 6 of 12\npolitical party's primary ballot for state or district offices, a candidate must either receive the \npolitical party endorsement or else obtain at least 15% of the delegate votes to that political \nparty's state or district convention.” 213 F.Supp.2d at 153. No other option at all existed then; no \nrealistic option exists now. Thus, this Court must once again act to safeguard First Amendment \nrights by entering a preliminary injunction.  \nThe record observations of the district court in Campbell – that, inter alia, only one \nperson ever successfully navigated the convention delegate system against an incumbent \ncongressperson, senator, governor, or secretary of the state in 47 years of modern democracy – \nare directly applicable to this case, where once again the convention delegate system will be the \nonly meaningful method for candidates to access the August 11, 2020 primary ballot for \ncongress, state senate, or state representative, absent action by this Court. The district court’s \nobservations “strongly suggest[ed] an overly burdensome primary ballot access system” then, id. \nat 156, and they still do now.  \nIn light of Plaintiffs’ “sufficient and persuasive evidence of an overly burdensome \nsystem,” 213 F.Supp.2d at 157, the governor’s executive order must be considered “severe” \nrestrictions, which “must be narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling \nimportance.” Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992). \n  In Campbell, the state offered “no real analysis in support” of the convention-delegate \nsystem for ballot access. 213 F.Supp.2d at 156. Defendant Lamont’s executive order puts forth \ntwo possible interests in the continued severity of Connecticut’s ballot access restrictions: \nensuring “viable” candidates qualify for the ballot “based on a minimum threshold of support,” \nand “to promote an election that is orderly, fair and transparent.” See supra note 1 at pp. 1-2. But \nthe Defendant’s executive order, like the statutory scheme in Campbell, “far exceeds a means to \n  6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-1   Filed 05/12/20   Page 7 of 12\na legitimate end, the screening out of candidates who lack a significant modicum of support,” \n213 F.Supp.2d at 157, and instead imposes an overly severe restriction on Plaintiffs’ and all \nvoters First Amendment rights.  \nThe restrictions imposed by Defendant Lamont’s executive order are far more severe than \nnecessary to guarantee a significant modicum of support. Defendant Lamont’s executive order \nfails to justify the severity of the restrictions – requiring 3.5% of party members’ signatures to be \ncollected in 16 days under a cumbersome new mechanism without a direct online portal – by any \ncompelling state interest. Defendants, meanwhile, will be unable to show that the relief requested \nby Plaintiffs would “encumber the ballot with the names of frivolous candidates,” allow \n“distortion of the electoral process by the device of ‘party raiding,’” or that the restrictions on \naccess are related to any other legitimate state goals. Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 788 \nn.9 (giving examples of legitimate reasons for restrictions). As in Campbell, “[v]oters \ncomprising a candidate’s significant modicum of support should not be disenfranchised by an \noverly burdensome primary ballot process that bars their candidate from appearing on the \nprimary ballot.” 213 F.Supp.2d at 157. \nPlaintiffs have shown that significant numbers of voters would be disenfranchised by \nConnecticut’s primary ballot access process which, absent this Court’s action, will likely bar \nthem both from appearing on the primary ballot and from voting for the full range of candidates \nof their choice. See generally Exhibits A-C. Plaintiffs therefore show a very high likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of their First Claim. \n2.  Plaintiffs are Suffering, and Will Continue to Suffer, Harm to their First \nAmendment Rights if the Injunction is Denied, Harm That is Severe and \nIrreparable                   \nThe severe restrictions imposed by Connecticut’s ballot access requirements are causing \nat least three forms of irreparable harm to Plaintiffs, Connecticut candidates and voters.  \n  7 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-1   Filed 05/12/20   Page 8 of 12\nFirst, as shown in Mr. Gottlieb’s affidavit, they harm Plaintiffs as potential candidates, \nby deterring them from running for office in the first place, even if they desire to do so and have \na significant modicum of support. Exhibit A at ¶ 6 (“I’ve been asked many times since my 2018 \nstate senate campaign whether I will ever run again. I always say, ‘Yes I will! I just don’t know \nwhen I might be able to get on the ballot.’”). This “chilling” of the right to speak, petition, and \nrun for office is cognizable First Amendment injury of the utmost importance justifying entrance \nof declaratory relief and a preliminary injunction. \nSecond, also shown in Mr. Gottlieb’s affidavit, the restrictions harm Plaintiffs as voters, \nby restricting the number of candidates to choose from and denying voters the ability to vote for \ncandidates of their choice. Exhibit A at ¶¶ 15-16 (“I’m a registered Democrat in a blue state who \nvotes a straight-party ticket in November . . . But in the four state elections I’ve been eligible to \nvote in since I turned 18, not once has there been a primary in either my state representative or \nmy state senate district.”); ¶ 20 (“Collecting signatures moves from nearly impossible to \nabsolutely impossible under social distancing measures, . . . .”). Ms. Chand is also a Plaintiff \nbeing denied her rights as a voter. The injury to voters from overly restrictive ballot access \nrequirements is cognizable First Amendment injury. See Rockefeller v. Powers, 74 F.3d 1367 (2d \nCir. 1995) (voters have standing to challenge ballot access requirements). \nThird, as shown in Mr. Bartlett and Mr. Lacourciere’s affidavits, the restrictions harm \nPlaintiffs if they choose to run for office, as Mr. Bartlett and Mr. Lacourciere have, as \ncandidates, because for candidates who are not incumbent officeholders, no available method for \nqualifying for the ballot is practicable under the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic. This \ninjury is compounded every day because any ballot access method takes time to plan for and \norganize. Even with the governor’s new executive order, the ballot access requirements under \n  8 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-1   Filed 05/12/20   Page 9 of 12\nConnecticut state law continue to place a severe undue burden on candidates seeking to qualify \nfor the primary ballot, as explained supra, pp. 2-7. These harms are irreparable and Plaintiffs \nhave no adequate remedy at law, because, as it is well-settled, harms to their First Amendment \nrights cannot be repaired by money damages. \n “[T]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, \nunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.” Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976); \nMurphy v. Zoning Comm’n of the Village of New Milford, 148 F.Supp.2d 173, 180-81 (D. Conn. \n2001). Plaintiffs are suffering irreparable damage because candidates who would challenge \nincumbent public officials will not run for office—or even if they do, like Mr. Bartlett and Mr. \nLacourciere, qualifying for the ballot will be impossible. Plaintiffs are also suffering as voters, \nbecause they will be unable to choose from a full range of candidates when they cast their \nballots. \nPlaintiffs’ irreparable injury will only compound as the petitions are issued on May 26, \nthe petitioning deadline approaches 16 days later on June 11, and the August 11, 2020 primary \ncomes closer. Plaintiffs have reached out to Defendants to confer about settlement, but have been \ntold that in light of the executive order they now have no other recourse than this Court. At some \npoint, as this Court has observed, there no longer is “sufficient time to permit Plaintiffs access to \nthe ballot.” Campbell, 213 F.Supp.2d at 159 (rejecting state’s argument there was insufficient \ntime as of July 23 to permit access for September 10 primary). Plaintiffs seek immediate action \nnow to prevent, for example, ballots from needing to be re-printed should this case take weeks or \nlonger to resolve. \n \n \n  9 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-1   Filed 05/12/20   Page 10 of 12\n3.  The Balance of the Harms Favors Plaintiffs Because They Will Be Severely \nHarmed Without Action by This Court, and They Request Readily Available \nRelief from Defendants                 \n \nAny speculative harm to the Defendants is far outweighed by the harm that the Plaintiffs \nwould suffer by being deprived of their constitutional freedoms to petition and to speak, in the \ndistinct ways identified above and in their affidavits and expert reports. \nInjunctive and declaratory relief here, meanwhile, would simply require Defendants to \nmake reasonable modifications to their election procedures in light of the pandemic as a number \nof states have voluntarily done.  \nThis Court can take notice that, as demonstrated by other states, there is minimal burden \nassociated with protecting the rights of petition and speech in this case: \nThe Arizona Secretary of State has provided an online petitioning mechanism for \ncandidates since 2015;2 \nOn March 19, 2020, the Governor of New Jersey issued an executive order to the \nSecretary of State to implement online petitioning and signature collection;3 \nOn April 2, 2020 Florida’s Secretary of State signed an emergency order allowing for the \ncollection of petition signatures online;4 \nIt is evident, therefore, that narrowly-tailored options that protect both the health of the \ngeneral public as well as their constitutional rights are readily available and have been \nimplemented without any harm to any legitimate State interests. Thus far, however, Connecticut \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n2 Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Commission, E-Qual, available at \nhttps://www.azcleanelections.gov/E-Qual. \n3 New Jersey Executive Order No. 105, available at \nhttps://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/assets/pdf/candidate/EO-105.pdf \n4 Florida Certification of Department of State Emergency Rule, 11SER20-2 – Candidate Petition \nProcess, available at https://dos.myflorida.com/media/702874/1ser20-2.pdf \n  10 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-1   Filed 05/12/20   Page 11 of 12\nhas failed to follow suit, which this Court can and should remedy. Plaintiffs’ relief is therefore \nreasonable in light of the impossibility of gathering in-person petition signatures and the balance \nof the harms favors Plaintiffs.  \n4.

Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 786 (1983). “The exclusion of \ncandidates also burdens voters’ freedom of association, because an election campaign is an \neffective platform for the expression of views on the issues of the day, and a candidate serves as \na rallying point for likeminded citizens.” Id. at 787-88. “The right to associate with the political \nparty of one’s choice is an integral part of . . . basic constitutional freedom.” Tashjian v. \nRepublican Party of Conn., 479 U.S. 208, 214 (1986).

I am 26 years old and a registered Connecticut voter in Guilford. \n2.  I bring this case because Connecticut’s ballot access laws, even with Governor \nLamont’s new executive order, place an undue burden on candidates seeking access to the primary \nballot and on voters seeking to vote for the candidate of their choice. \n3.  Connecticut’s ballot access laws placed severe burdens on the rights of candidates \nand voters before COVID-19. Before COVID-19, even candidates with a significant modicum of \nsupport were confronted with very substantial obstacles in obtaining access to the ballot. The \nthreshold was much more difficult to surmount than is reasonably necessary to achieve the \nlegitimate purpose of screening out candidates with no real support and systematically denied \nConnecticut voters the chance to be heard.  \n4.  Now, with COVID-19, the magnitude of the burdens placed by Connecticut’s ballot \naccess laws have increased even further, and Governor Lamont’s new executive order fails to begin \nto address the magnitude of the present situation. Thus, as a potential candidate for office and as a \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-2   Filed 05/12/20   Page 2 of 6\nConnecticut voter, I feel compelled to bring this action, and the urgency of this matter compels me \nto urge this Court’s issuance of an emergency order. In this affidavit, I explain why I am bringing \nthis case and why I believe it requires immediate action by this Honorable Court. \nA.  Potential Candidate \n5.  As alleged in the Complaint in this action, I ran for the office of state senate in \n2018, and fell just short of the signatures required to qualify for the primary ballot. In 2018, the \nseat was vacant – an “open seat” – but the seat is now occupied by an incumbent Democrat. \n6.  I’ve been asked many times since my 2018 state senate campaign whether I will \never run again. I always say, “Yes, I will! I just don’t know when I might be able to get on the \nballot.” Given that it was next-to-impossible to run for even an open seat, I know that running \nagainst an incumbent would be even more quixotic.  \n7.  Being denied ballot access is not an easy loss to accept, precisely because it’s not \neven a defeat. It feels more like one’s candidacy is put in suspended animation, with voters never \ngetting to weigh in one way or another.  \n8.  As heartbreaking as it would be, I could accept defeat at the polls, because that \nwould have democratic legitimacy. But Connecticut’s ballot access laws make a mockery of those \nideals. A group of party insiders selecting a group of party insiders to be delegates to decide on \nthe nominee (knowing that whoever doesn’t make the cut will be thrown to the wolves in the \npetition process) echoes the worst of closed political systems. \n9.  As far as I can tell, the state has an interest in ensuring that only serious candidates \nmake it onto the ballot. I understand and agree with that proposition, but Connecticut’s laws go \nwell beyond that of almost any other state. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-2   Filed 05/12/20   Page 3 of 6\n10.  Gathering the valid signatures of five percent of all registered Democrats in my \ndistrict is a hefty challenge, but it could be done. Doing so in an arbitrary two-week window in \nlate May and early June is what makes it nearly impossible. Again, I can understand why the state \nwould have a deadline to turn in signatures, but I will never grasp the rational basis of having a \nstart date a mere fourteen days beforehand.  \n11.  In  most  other  states,  I  would  be  given  months  to  gather  such  a  quantity  of \nsignatures. I did my utmost to meet the requirements in 2018, knocking on thousands of doors, \nalong with my volunteers. I certainly demonstrated the earnestness of my candidacy. \n12.  I (rather dangerously) lost seven pounds over two weeks of nonstop petitioning, \ngoing door to door in scorching heat and through torrential downpours.  \n13.  The overwhelming majority of people I spoke with were willing to sign, seeing \nballot access as essential to democracy. \nB.   Voter \n14.  I also believe the ballot access laws violate my rights as a voter.  \n15.  I’m a registered Democrat in a blue state who votes a straight-party ticket in \nNovember. My only real choice could come in a primary.  \n16.  But in the four state elections I’ve been eligible to vote in since I turned 18, not \nonce has there been a primary in either my state representative district or my state senate district.  \n17.  I know firsthand how difficult the process is, and I’m certain that more people \nwould step up to run (and succeed in doing so) if only a viable path existed to getting on the ballot. \n18.  I also desire a way to vote absentee without meeting one of the six narrow excuses \nallowed under current law. Voting is one of our most fundamental rights and should be accessible \nto all citizens, not dependent on one’s physical availability on a single day in August or November. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-2   Filed 05/12/20   Page 4 of 6\nC.  Urgency \n19.  The indefensibility of Connecticut’s ballot access and absentee voting laws has \nbeen brought to the fore by the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n20.  Collecting signatures moves from nearly impossible to absolutely impossible under \nsocial distancing measures, closing off any avenue to candidates not backed at party conventions. \nSimilarly, voting in person goes against social distancing measures. Common sense dictates that \nvoting by mail is the only safe way to conduct an election in the near future.  \n21.  While I was prepared earlier to give the state time to respond to our Complaint, \nafter speaking with Jason Bartlett about the unfair pressures his candidacy is facing due to ballot \naccess uncertainty, I believe that action is required immediately to give candidates a reasonable \nmethod of attaining a spot in their primary. \nD.  The Governor’s New Executive Order \n22.  Reducing the number of signatures by 30% and adding two days to the petition \nperiod does not begin to address the magnitude of the present situation. \n23.  A  Democratic  candidate  in  my  senate  district,  for  instance,  would  still  need \napproximately 700 valid signatures to make the primary ballot. This would be substantially more \nin a district with higher concentrations of registered Democrats, such as the 10th Senate District \nwhere Jason Bartlett is running. \n24.  Corralling  that  many  registered  voters  without  going  door-to-door  would  be \nextraordinarily difficult; a mere 16 days to collect that many signatures under fast-changing \ncircumstances would be completely impossible. Requiring it is completely irrational.  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-2   Filed 05/12/20   Page 5 of 6\n25.  I cannot comprehend why Governor Lamont would insist on such a high standard \nfor a candidate to make the primary ballot, except to exclude those disfavored by the party \nestablishment. \n26.  A reasonable standard would be at least a month to gather petition signatures, along \nwith a reduction of the needed signatures by at least 80% or simply a fixed number of signatures, \nsuch as 100 for state senate candidates and 50 for state representative candidates. This would be \nsufficient to prove that the candidate has a significant modicum of voter support.  \n27.  The use of electronic signatures could ameliorate the burden somewhat, but the \nexecutive order makes it as cumbersome as possible. \n28.  Requiring potential petition signers to print out, sign, scan, and email the petition \nform puts the process out of reach for all but the most determined and well-resourced voters.  \n29.  The only other option, of mailing in the form, also places an undue burden on the \nvoter – unless Secretary Merrill decides to send every registered voter a petition form with a self-\naddressed stamped envelope, as she is planning on doing for absentee ballot application forms. \n30.  A reasonable standard would be for the Secretary to set up a web form, similar to \nthe very successful one already used for registering to vote or checking a voter’s registration. A \nvoter could simply type in their name, town, and birthdate, and be presented with a dropdown of \npetitioning candidates in their district. The voter could then select which candidates they would \n“sign” for and submit directly to the Secretary. The procedure would be straightforward and secure.  \n31.  Keep in mind that party convention candidates’ delegates are being allowed to \nappear via Zoom to ratify their choices in this year’s conventions, and it is likely that no incumbent \noffice-holder in the State of Connecticut will be required to collect any petition signatures at all, \nbecause they will be nominated by the party convention.  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-2   Filed 05/12/20   Page 6 of 6\n32.

BARTLETT \n \nI, Jason W. Bartlett, hereby declare this 11th day of May, 2020 based on facts within my \npersonal knowledge: \n1.  I am a registered Connecticut voter at 22 Howard Ave., New Haven, CT 06519. \n2.  I  have  filed  paperwork  with  the  Connecticut  State  Elections  Enforcement \nCommission (SEEC) to become a candidate for the 10th State Senate District of the Connecticut \nGeneral Assembly and have filed the legal candidate committee paperwork to raise funds in the \nexploratory designation for such office.   \n3.  I have obtained the paperwork to transition to an official State Senate candidate \ncommittee according to SEEC guidelines and Connecticut law and intend to officially file that \npaperwork the day before the Democratic Party State Senate Convention for the 10th State Senate \nDistrict.  I am following the rules and guidelines as written by the SEEC in order to run for State \nSenate and to abide by the laws of the State of Connecticut in order to receive public financing \nmonies to support my campaign. \n4.  I am a former member of the Connecticut House of Representatives, having served \nin the General Assembly from 2007 to 2011 for the 2nd State House District serving parts of the \n  1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-3   Filed 05/12/20   Page 2 of 6\ntowns of Danbury, Bethel and Redding.  I have also served the former Mayor of New Haven, Toni \nHarp, 2014-2020, as the Director of Youth Services and Liaison to the New Haven Board of \nEducation.  I am also the elected State Central Committee member representing the Cities of New \nHaven & West Haven for State 10th State Senate District within the Connecticut Democratic Party. \n5.  My  experiences  as  an  active  elector,  legislator  and  municipal  employee  and \ncommunity activist enables my desire to serve the people of New Haven as their next State Senator \nfrom the 10th State Senate District.  \n6.  When I decided to run for State Senate in the 10th Senate District, a Democratic-\nmajority voter district, I understood that it would be a challenge to obtain the necessary votes from \nthe delegates who would be appointed by New Haven’s Democratic Party Chair, who had opposed \nthe election campaign of my former employer, Toni Harp, and had opposed my election to the \nState Central Committee two years ago. I knew, based on my knowledge and experience in New \nHaven Democratic Party politics, that New Haven’s Democratic Party Chair would make it highly \nimprobable for me to qualify for the ballot by state party state senate convention.  \n7.  In fact, the New Haven Democratic Party Chair chose the delegates for the state \nparty state senate convention himself.  \n8.  Knowing it was highly improbable that I would qualify for the ballot by state party \nstate senate convention, I ran for office, believing that I would not be precluded from obtaining \nballot access because I could petition my way onto the ballot in a Democratic Party Primary.   \n9.  I have years of experience obtaining ballot petition signatures, because I was \nsuccessful as a campaign manager in charge of obtaining the necessary petitions for a variety of \ncandidates for office and ensuring they achieved ballot access in the State of Connecticut. This \nexperience  includes  successful  petition  access  campaigns  for  James  Newton,  Democratic \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-3   Filed 05/12/20   Page 3 of 6\ncandidate for Mayor of New Haven in 1999, State Senator Martin Looney, Democratic candidate \nfor Mayor of New Haven in 2001, Mary Jane Foster, Democratic candidate for Mayor of \nBridgeport in 2011, and then-Sen. Toni Harp, Democratic candidate for Mayor of New Haven \n2013. I believed, when I began planning to run for office, because of my experience, that I would \nbe able to collect enough signatures from electors to qualify for the ballot in a Democratic Party \nPrimary. \n10.  However, due to COVID-19 and the continuing shelter-at-home orders issued by \nGovernor Lamont, going door-to-door will be impossible to obtain legal signatures in person.  I \nam aware that Governor Lamont issued an executive order allowing for remote notarization to be \nlegal and legitimate with a proper attestation so I have theorized that we could do an electronic \nsignature on petitions. \n11.  Conventions for political office in the Democratic Party are scheduled to begin by \nthe Connecticut Democratic Party on May 10th.  The State Senate Conventions for the City of \nNew Haven are scheduled for May 19, 2020. Time is of the essence. \n12.  Based on my knowledge, training, and experience, I know that political campaigns \nthat challenge incumbent political leaders require foresight, planning, and organization. \n13.  By the time this case was filed, as a candidate for public office challenging a public \nofficial, guidance should have been provided by the Secretary of the State’s office or the Governor \nregarding the establishment of procedures and guidelines to obtain and legally attest electronic \nsignatures for the office I and other candidates seek. \n14.  The  Secretary  of  the  State  and  the  Governor's  office  had  already  articulated \nstrategies to ensure that the Presidential Primary Election delegates have access to the democratic \nsystem months in advance of the elections, but no strategy for Connecticut residents who seek to \n  3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-3   Filed 05/12/20   Page 4 of 6\nobtain access to the ballot in order to represent our Cities, towns and communities in which we \nlive and to hold incumbent officeholders accountable was announced until today. \n15.  I have reviewed the Secretary of the State and the Governor’s new executive order, \nwhich is supposedly meant to provide an alternative to paper petition signatures for candidates \nwho, like me, are unlikely to receive the support of the local party insiders at convention has placed \nan undue burden on my candidacy seeking access to the primary ballot. \n16.  The executive order fails to provide a meaningful alternative to paper petition \nsignatures. Under the executive order, I would still need to obtain 3.5% of the registered members \nof the Democratic Party in my state senate district, a number that likely exceeds 1,000 registered \nDemocrats.   \n17.  The supposed alternative to an in-person paper petition drive requires the voter to \nbe either mailed a petition, or requires candidates to email the petition to the voter, which is \nunlikely because voters’ email addresses are rarely provided in applications to register to vote and \nare therefore not public information. The voter must then sign and mail the petition back to the \ncandidate, or print and sign the petition then upload the petition by photograph or scanner to their \ncomputer and email it back to the candidate. The candidate must then print out all of the emails \nand petitions, one petition and the email that it came with per voter, to the registrar of voters of the \nvoter’s municipality. This new process is cumbersome and costly and the executive order only \ngives two additional days to complete it. \n18.  Unlike applications for absentee ballots, which are being mailed to every voter by \nthe Secretary of the State, petitions will not be mailed to any voters. \n19.  The City of New Haven is doing distance learning, and it is well known that \nbetween 5 to 7 thousand children do not have a computer to be able to do the online learning. \n  4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-3   Filed 05/12/20   Page 5 of 6\nPetitions are routinely circulated online through websites such as Change.org but Governor \nLamont’s order requires people to not only have computers, but also printers and scanners. The \ntotal number of steps and new paperwork created by the Governor’s new order will increase the \ntime spent by either candidates going door-to-door to canvas for the signatures, volunteers, or \nvoters leaving their homes to print or scan documents. \n20.  Given my knowledge, training, and experience running campaigns and collecting \nsignatures, I can easily conclude within a reasonable degree of professional certainty that unless \nthe number of signatures required is capped at 500, and a substantial amount of additional time is \nprovided, there is essentially no way that anyone will qualify for the ballot under the Governor’s \ncumbersome new system for collecting signatures. It is absurd, and demonstrates that the Governor \nhas little concern for candidates’ and voters’ First Amendment rights. \n21.  Every hour and day that passes without being able to plan for a meaningful \nelectronic petition signature gathering effort that we could actually achieve – or some other \nalternative form of ballot access – irreparably harms my ability to exercise my First Amendment \nright to run for office. I can never get that time back. The time lost due to the failure of the Governor \nand the Secretary of the State put me at a competitive disadvantage in my race challenging my \nincumbent State Senator. \n22.  The extreme difficulty of the Governor’s executive order, and the absurdly little \namount of time given to complete its requirements – two extra days – can leave me with no other \nconclusion than that Governor Lamont is intentionally discriminating against candidates for office \nwho are challenging incumbent office-holders. Although I can understand the chief executive’s \ndesire to curry legislative support, I believe it is inconsistent with voters’ First Amendment rights. \n  5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-3   Filed 05/12/20   Page 6 of 6\n23.  In my opinion, if an order from this Court does not issue, time will run out and \nirreparably harm the ability of myself and other candidates for office to meaningfully access the \nballot, unless they are well-connected and have the support of someone like the New Haven \nDemocratic Party Chair. \n24.  This case isn’t just about me. It’s about the voters of New Haven and West Haven, \ntowns dominated by the Democratic Party, who will only have a realistic voice in the selection of \ntheir elected representatives if they can choose from a full range of candidates in the state party \nprimary. Unless candidates are given reasonable access to the ballot in the state party primary, \nDemocratic Party insiders will be able to maintain a political monopoly over many state senate \nand state representative districts in our state.  Unless this Court takes action, the ballot access \nrestrictions in the Governor’s order will deny thousands of voters in cities across Connecticut the \nFirst Amendment right to vote for the candidate of their choice, including candidates with \nsignificant support.  \n* * * \nI declare under penalty of perjury, pursuant to Title 28, § 1746 of the United States Code, \nthat the foregoing is true, correct, and within my personal knowledge. \n/s/Jason W.

I am over 18 years old and a registered Connecticut voter. \n2.  At the heart of politics is person-to-person connection, whether it be door-to-door \ncanvassing, signature collection, or fundraisers.  \n3.  I am running for State Representative in the 24th House District of the Connecticut \nGeneral Assembly as a Democrat.  \n4.  The current COVID-19 pandemic has struck not only at the heart of politics, but \nalso the democratic process we all believe in and fight for. \n5.  Now, more than ever, it is incumbent on those with the power to allow democracy \nto do so. \n6.  I have reviewed the Governor’s Executive Order on ballot access. It does not go far \nenough. \n7.  A reasonable system for ballot access would reduce the number of signatures \nrequired by 80% and greatly expand the window in which to collect them, an extension of 3 weeks. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-4   Filed 05/12/20   Page 2 of 2\n8.  Another possibility is to allow the number of in-district donations as the threshold \nfor being on the ballot, as this can primarily be done online. \n9.  People who know me, know my enthusiasm when it comes to speaking with my \nneighbors and community and under any other circumstances I am more than happy to do so and \nlook forward to it. \n10.  But under the current circumstances, where it is inadvisable to go visit my younger \ncousins, it is also unwise to spend so much time going door-to-door and to be forced by those in \npower to do this to engage in our democratic process running for office. \n11.  It is the responsibility of those in power to use that power correctly and not force \nthose without it to give up their rights and put themselves in harm’s way to have a voice in our \ndemocracy. \n12.  For all of these reasons, I join the above-titled lawsuit and ask that this Honorable \nCourt take the immediate action required by Plaintiffs. \n*\t*\t*\t\nI declare under penalty of perjury, pursuant to Title 28, § 1746 of the United States Code, \nthat the foregoing is true, correct, and within my personal knowledge. \n/s/Richard Lacourciere       \nRichard Lacourciere \nDated this 11th day of May, 2020 \n \nNOTARIZATION \n \nSubscribed to and sworn before me, this 11th day of May, 2020, through Communication \nTechnology pursuant to the terms of Governor Lamont’s Executive Order No. 7Q (3). \n/s/             \nAlexander T.

State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, \n552 U.S. 196, 204 (2008). “The State’s power cannot be used, for example, to create barriers that \nunduly burden a person’s right to participate in a state-mandated . . . primary.” Yang v. Kosinski, \nNo. 20-1494-CV, 2020 WL 2820179, at *7 (2d Cir. June 1, 2020). “[V]oter-plaintiffs have an \nassociational right to vote in political party elections,” Price v. New York State Bd. of Elections, \n540 F.3d 101, 108 (2d Cir. 2008) (citing Lopez-Torres & Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U.S. 51, 57-58 \n(1973)). \nThe State Defendants (Governor Lamont and Secretary of the State Merrill) and the \nDemocratic State Central Committee mistakenly rely almost entirely on Lopez-Torres, 552 U.S. \nat 202, a case in which the plaintiffs “sought a declaration that New York’s convention system for \nselecting  Supreme  Court  Justices  violates  their  First  Amendment  rights,  and  an  injunction \nmandating the establishment of a direct primary election to select party nominees for Supreme \nCourt Justice.” Id.   \n  1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31   Filed 06/02/20   Page 2 of 12\nBut this case is different from Lopez-Torres. Here the State Defendants will hold a primary \nfor state offices on August 11, 2020, but it is alleged that the barriers to ballot access for that \nprimary, imposed by statute and executive order, unduly and unjustifiably burden voter-plaintiffs’ \nFirst Amendment right to participate. States may or may not be required to hold a primary. But \nwhen they do, voter-plaintiffs argue that the primary must be held consistent with the First \nAmendment by not unjustifiably restricting participation. Plaintiffs here challenge no “internal \nparty processes,” as State Defendants and the Democratic State Central Committee seem to \ncontend,  but  instead  challenge  a  “public  electoral  function”  of  the  State  of  Connecticut, \nquintessential state action. Jacobson v. Kings Cty. Democratic Cty. Comm., 788 F. App'x 770, 774 \n(2d Cir. 2019) (rejecting claim based on allegedly illegal procedures of party convention). This \ncase is therefore governed by the same well-settled Anderson-Burdick test that governed Campbell \nv. Bysiewicz, 213 F.Supp.2d 152 (D.Conn. July 23, 2002), a standard completely unaddressed by \nthe State Defendants. \nThe  State  Defendants  omit  Anderson-Burdick  from  their  brief,  despite  it  being  the \nprevailing First Amendment standard “for courts to utilize when faced with a First Amendment \nchallenge to a state election law:” \nA court considering a challenge to a state election law must weigh the character \nand magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the First and \nFourteenth Amendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate against the precise \ninterests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its \nrule, taking into consideration the extent to which those interests make it necessary \nto burden the plaintiff's rights. . . . \n \nThe standards for review are clear. If the plaintiffs' rights are severely burdened, \nthe  statute  is  subject  to  strict  scrutiny.  If  the  burden  is  minor,  but  non-\ntrivial, Burdick’s balancing test is applied. . . . Nonetheless, . . . where the burden \nimposed by the law is non-trivial, we must weigh the State’s justification against \nthe burden imposed. \n \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31   Filed 06/02/20   Page 3 of 12\nPrice, 540 F.3d at 108-09 (citations omitted). The record in this case demonstrates that the state \ncannot justify the burdens imposed on voter-plaintiffs, especially given COVID-19. \nA. Connecticut’s Ballot Access Laws – Even as Modified by Governor Lamont’s \nExecutive Order – Impose Severe Burdens on Voters’ Associational Rights \n \nEven the State Defendants’ evidence shows the severe burden of Connecticut’s Ballot \nAccess Laws on voter-plaintiffs. This year, a total of 192 districts will elect State Representatives, \nState  Senators,  and  U.S.  Representatives  in  Connecticut.1  Only  one  district  has  a  primary \nchallenger that received a party endorsement, only six have a primary challenger that obtained \n15% of the delegates at a convention, and only seven districts have a candidate even trying to \naccess the ballot by petition. ECF No. 28-1 at 87 of 116 (Ex. C Tbl. 1). Thus, a total of 178 \nincumbent officeholders, or more than 92% of the State Representatives, State Senators, and U.S. \nRepresentatives in Connecticut, will face no primary challenger this year. Over 92% of the “orderly \nand fair elections” Connecticut purportedly seeks to protect on August 11, 2020 will likely be one-\ncandidate elections where voters have no choice on the ballot. \nState Defendants put forward evidence of only two people ever petitioning onto the ballot \nfor a primary for the office of State Senate in Connecticut history, both in 2018 before COVID-\n19, and in neither did so against an incumbent. ECF No. 28-1 at 89-95 of 116. In 2016, not a single \ncandidate in either party petitioned onto the ballot for a primary for the office of State Senate. Id. \nat 91 of 116. State Defendants’ evidence from 2006-2014 fails to differentiate between primaries \ntriggered by a 15% vote at convention or by petition, but the facts demonstrate the severe burden \nto access the ballot by petition or by party convention for the office of State Senate: \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 This Court can take judicial notice of Connecticut’s 151 House Districts, 36 Senate Districts, \nand 5 Congressional Districts. \n  3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31   Filed 06/02/20   Page 4 of 12\nConnecticut State Senate \nMajor Party Primaries  \nby Petition or Convention \n2006-2016 \n \nYear  Democratic Party  Republican Party \nPrimaries  Primaries \n2006  0/36 Districts  0/36 Districts \n2008  3/36 Districts  1/36 Districts \n2010  1/36 Districts  1/36 Districts \n2012  3/36 Districts  0/36 Districts \n2014  4/36 Districts  0/36 Districts \n2016  3/36 Districts  0/36 Districts \n \nECF No. 28-1 at 89-91 of 116 (Ex. D. Tbl. 2). In 2020, the only three candidates petitioning for \nthe ballot for a State Senate primary are Plaintiff Bartlett, the undersigned counsel, and Lee \nSamowitz Jr., Esq. in Bridgeport. Id. at 87 of 116, Ex. C. Tbl. 1. \n  The State Defendants present evidence of 16 candidates petitioning for primary ballot \naccess for the office of State Representative in all of Connecticut since the passage of Public Act \n03-241. Id. at 89-91 of 116. Given that 151 State Representatives are up for re-election every year, \nand the major parties potentially nominate over 300 candidates each year, this shows significant \nlack of ballot access in Connecticut. State Defendants put forth evidence that only three candidates \nhave petitioned for primary ballot access for the office of Governor since 2004, and State \nDefendants fail to show evidence of even one candidate who has petitioned for access to the \nprimary ballot for the office of U.S. Representative in Connecticut history. Id. Not one. This \nfollows 47 years without any primary elections for the office of U.S. Representative leading up to \nBysiewicz v. Campbell, a fact the district court found significant in concluding that the restrictions \non ballot access were overly severe. 213 F.Supp.2d at 156. \n  Indeed, as Plaintiff Gottlieb says in his supplemental affidavit, he has voted in nearly every \nelection in the Town of Guilford since he became eligible to vote at the age of 18, including party \n  4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31   Filed 06/02/20   Page 5 of 12\nprimaries, as a registered Connecticut Democrat. Supplemental Declaration and Expert Report of \nAndy Gottlieb (Exhibit 1) at ¶¶ 7, 12. In none of these elections has Plaintiff Gottlieb ever had the \nopportunity to choose from more than one candidate for the offices of State Representative or State \nSenator in the party primary. Id. at ¶ 14. Not once. When Plaintiff Gottlieb attempted to access the \nballot himself, he personally faced the severe burdens of Connecticut’s Ballot Access Laws. Id. at \n¶¶ 2-4, 6. He collected signatures himself each and every day, and marshaled the support of many \nvolunteers who volunteered hours of their time to help him. Id. But even with their tireless efforts, \nthey fell short, because of the severe burden imposed by Connecticut’s Ballot Access Laws. Id. \n  All of this evidence demonstrates the severity of the burden on voter-plaintiffs even before \nCOVID. With the onset of the pandemic, however, it is evident that Connecticut’s restrictions – \neven with the slight modifications made by Governor Lamont – are severely burdensome.  \nAs the attached declarations demonstrate, Plaintiffs’ fears about petitioning in the time of \ncoronavirus have come to fruition. The task of gathering signatures, as expected, has become \nsignificantly more difficult. See Supplemental Declaration of Jason Bartlett (Exhibit 2) at ¶¶ 4-11; \nDeclaration of Sergio Rodriguez (Exhibit 3) at ¶¶ 6-10. Mr. Bromley says that he is “aware of \ntestimony” that “individuals with experience circulating petitions can collect 8 to 10 signatures per \nhour.” ECF No. 28-1 at ¶ 57. This vague statement should be given little weight, even at the \npreliminary injunction stage. But assuming it is true, the ease with which individuals could gather \nsignatures before COVID-19 only shows the difficulty that candidates face now. Campaigners \nhired or volunteering to go door-to-door are collecting dramatically fewer signatures than they \nwere able to collect prior to the pandemic. Ex. 3 at ¶¶ 6-10. It is more difficult to hire individuals \nor find volunteers to go door-to-door in the first place. Ex. 2 at ¶¶ 10. Additional evidence of the \n  5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31   Filed 06/02/20   Page 6 of 12\ndifficulty gathering petition signatures was presented to the state prior to the filing of its brief, on \nThursday, May 28. See Declarations of Tawana Galberth and Renee Brown (Exhibits 4 & 5). \n   The State Defendants’ only response to COVID’s unique and extraordinary circumstances \nis that plaintiffs’ contentions are “nothing more than speculation and conjecture.” ECF No. 28-1 \nat ¶ 50. Not so. To begin, plaintiffs had significant experience gathering petition signatures that \nrender their opinions about the feasibility of petition signature gathering reasonable and worthy of \nconsiderable weight. ECF No. 9-2 (Gottlieb Report), 9-3 (Bartlett Report). A plaintiff with \ncommon sense (let alone knowledge, training, and experience running campaigns) to know that a \nproposed plan of action will be burdensome, costly, or even dangerous to his or her health need \nnot put him or herself (and others) at risk simply in order to prove that their opinions are not \nspeculative.  \nWe are living in a pandemic and the human risks at play here should not be taken lightly. \nIt is obvious and known to everybody, including the State Defendants, that the deadly pandemic \nmakes it more logistically difficult to engage in an intensive petition signature gathering drive. \nSimply labeling the concern “speculative” is an abdication of the responsibility to engage with a \nsensitive reality and fails to address plaintiffs’ argument that the conditions of the pandemic \nseriously “chill” petition drives from occurring in the first place. ECF No. 9 at 8. Moreover, the \nState Defendants were given evidence of the difficulty faced by campaign workers collecting \nsignatures, on Thursday, but still maintained in their brief yesterday that no efforts were being \nmade. See Exs. 4-5 (produced to the State Defendants May 28, 2020). \n  The  State  Defendants’  arguments  about  the  ease  of  collecting  signatures  using  new \nmethods is, in fact, nothing more than conjecture. Mr. Bromley appears to have no experience \nrunning petition signature drives as a candidate or a campaign manager, but speculates that \n  6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31   Filed 06/02/20   Page 7 of 12\ncandidates can now “quickly and easily” use new methods created by the Governor’s executive \norder to sign petitions electronically. ECF No. 28-1 at ¶ 51. Mr. Bromley provides no evidentiary \nfoundation for this speculation. He says candidates should use party lists, but provides no evidence \nthat candidates can “obtain . . . a list of . . . email addresses of . . . party members” as he postulates. \nId. Mr. Bromley speaks of “emailing petition forms to friends, family and other personal contacts,” \nid. at ¶ 54, but omits the requirements for individuals to (1) print out the petitions, (2) sign them \nand provide sensitive information on them including date of birth, (3) scan them back into their \ncomputer system, and (4) email them back to the candidate, steps which he concedes would require \n“follow up,” id. at ¶ 48, and an added layer of verification.  \nMr. Bromley is unrealistic. He omits that voters in a household must sign each petition \nseparately on a separate piece of paper before scanning it back and emailing it to the candidate or \nelse the signatures will not be counted. He omits that many voters lack printers or other electronic \ndevices required for the new mechanisms. Ex. 3 at ¶ 11 (“[S]ome friends could not even print the \npetition form for signing.”); Ex. 4 at ¶¶ 27-33 (explaining that digital options impose barriers on \nlow-income voters). Mr. Bromley’s idea that candidates “post[] [petitions] on . . . various social \nmedia pages,” ECF No. 28-1 at ¶ 51, fails to account for the various off-line tasks that are required \nof individuals who want to download the petition off of a social media page (if they somehow find \nit): print the petition out or use some unnamed software to sign it electronically, and then return \nthe petition by email or by having the campaign individually come pick it up. Ex. 3 at ¶ 11. As \nPlaintiff Gottlieb points out, Mr. Bromley and the Democratic State Central Committee’s evidence \ncontain factual errors and are misleading. Ex. 1 at ¶¶ 1-11. \nMr. Bromley never avers to have engaged in such an effort himself—but in fact, nobody \nhas before this election. One individual who has tried is proposed Plaintiff Sergio Rodriguez. Ex. \n  7 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31   Filed 06/02/20   Page 8 of 12\n3 at ¶ 11. Mr. Rodriguez has sent over 500 emails and has sent his petition to over 1,000 followers \non Facebook. Id. Out of 500 emails, Mr. Rodriguez has obtained only 8 petition signatures, a \nresponse rate of under 2%. Id. From Facebook, he has only obtained 2 signatures, a response rate \nof under 1%. Id. Overall he has secured only 3.3% of the signatures he has gathered using online \nmethods. Id. at ¶¶ 10-11. An experiment by an enthusiastic volunteer on the undersigned’s State \nSenate campaign, Ms. Antonia Oglesby, returned an even lower response rate for text messaging \nto obtain petition signatures—0.005% to even acknowledge receiving a text. See Declaration of \nAntonia Oglesby (Exhibit 6) at ¶¶ 1-7. Mr. Bartlett has also made efforts to gather signatures using \nonline methods and social media, see https://bartlett4senate.com/ (offering Democratic Party \nmembers  of  New  Haven  an  online  signature  petition  portal  created  by  Plaintiff  Bartlett’s \ncampaign), but he still believes that an order must issue in order to make access to the ballot \npossible for the August 11, 2020 primary election. Ex. 2 at ¶¶ 11-12.  \nAs the State Defendants concede, “electronic circulation and collection of signatures has \nnot been common within the context of ballot access petitions prior to 2020.” Mem. at 28. The \nState goes on to give the example of a government-created website, my2020census.gov, to show \nthat it isn’t a novel technique—but that makes plaintiffs’ point, because a government-created \nsecure and trusted web portal for submitting signatures is one part of plaintiffs’ requested relief. \nECF No. 9 at 3. \nMr. Bromley points to the petition signature gathering drive of a self-funded millionaire, \nDavid Stemerman, to make his point, ¶ 51, which refutes itself. If only millionaires can afford to \nrun for office, Connecticut’s system can hardly be considered constitutionally sufficient. See Mark \nPazniokas, Stemerman pledges another $10M to his self-funded campaign, CONNECTICUT MIRROR \n  8 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31   Filed 06/02/20   Page 9 of 12\n(Jun.  25,  2018),  available  at  https://ctmirror.org/2018/06/25/stemerman-pledges-another-10-\nmillion-self-funded-campaign/ (last accessed June 2, 2020).  \nConnecticut’s few party primaries show that the requirements for accessing the ballot in \nthis state are severely burdensome. More than 90% of officeholders face no primary year after year \nand many voters, such as Plaintiff Gottlieb, Ex. 1 at ¶¶ 12-13, never see any primaries for important \nstate offices. This is strong evidence that Connecticut’s Ballot Access Laws “unduly ‘limit the \nfield of candidates from which voters might choose,’” Maslow v. Bd. of Elections in City of New \nYork, 658 F.3d 291, 297 (2d Cir. 2011) (citing and quoting Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, \n786–87 (1983)); Campbell v. Bysiewicz, supra, violating the First Amendment. \nWith the COVID-19 pandemic, the burden is even more severe, as shown by the evidence \nsubmitted by Plaintiffs. See Exs. 2-3. At the very least, it cannot be said that a requirement to \ncollect over 1,000 signatures in under 20 days is “trivial” warranting the type of deference upon \nwhich the State Defendants insist. Price, 540 F.3d at 110 (finding state law election burdens on \nprimary voters “not trivial” and applying Anderson-Burdick). Thus, this Court should weigh the \nseverity of the restrictions against the State’s offered reasons for them and resolve this case under \nthe Anderson-Burdick test. \nB. The State’s Reasons Fail to Justify the Restrictions \n \nThe State Defendants put forward one “main interest” in regulating primary ballot access, \n“simply to ensure orderly and fair elections.” ECF No. 28-1 at ¶ 9.2 Given that the regulations \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n2 The Democratic State Central Committee, through its executive director, says that it opposes \nfurther changes to the petitioning requirements in Connecticut, but falls short of saying that it \nbelieves any change expanding ballot access would violate the party’s constitutional rights. The \ndirector simply says that she believes Governor Lamont’s changes are “reasonable” and no \nfurther action is needed. ECF No. 29 at 9, 40 of 43.  \n   The director further says that “disband[ing] endorsement convention process would harm \nthe DSCC’s ability to manage its own party,” id., but plaintiffs seek no such thing. Plaintiffs seek \n  9 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31   Filed 06/02/20   Page 10 of 12\nchallenged here prevent a primary election from even occurring over 90% of the races for State \nRepresentative or State Senator, it is hard to see how the state is advancing the purpose it purports \nto advance with its Ballot Access Laws. The State further fails to justify how plaintiffs’ proposed \nremedies would in any way undermine its admittedly great interest in orderly and fair elections. \nPlaintiffs – candidates and voters – obviously share an interest with the State Defendants in orderly \nand fair elections. They simply want orderly and fair elections to take place, with voter and \ncandidate participation. They simply want elections to take place with more than one choice of \ncandidate on the ballot. They want the voters—members of the Democratic Party of Connecticut—\nto decide, instead of smoke-filled – or smoke-free – rooms of party insiders. \nThe  only  concrete  complaint  the  State  Defendants  put  forward  about  the  plaintiffs’ \nproposed relief is in maintaining the 16-day window that Governor Lamont’s order imposes on the \ncollection of signatures, a 16-day window ending June 11, 2020. The State says it must maintain \nthat deadline because “extending it beyond the two days it already has been extended could \nsignificantly interfere with the broader election calendar.” ECF No. 28-1 at 20 of 116.  \nBut the State’s own evidence shows this not to be the case: Mr. Bromley’s declaration \nstates that Registrar of Voters must be given seven days to verify the signature pages submitted by \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nballot access to a party primary run by the state. State law restrictions on party primaries are state \naction to be adjudicated under the standards of the Anderson-Burdick test. The Supreme Court \nhas held that overly burdensome requirements to access the primary ballot can be \nunconstitutional even where avenues of ballot access for the general election are available. \nBullock v. Carter, 405 U.S. 134, 146–47 (1972) (“[W]e can hardly accept as reasonable an \nalternative that requires candidates and voters to abandon their party affiliations in order to avoid \nthe burdens of the filing fees imposed by state law.”). \n  As Plaintiff Bartlett points out, it is unclear whether the executive director and counsel \nfor the DSCC have authority from the committee to intervene in the lawsuit on the side of the \nState Defendants, Ex. 2 at ¶¶ 15-19, because the DSCC never held a vote. Id. \nAnd although the director says the nominating process “reflects the will of the people,” \nECF No. 29 at 7 of 43, what could reflect the will of the people better than a vote of the party \nmembers themselves? Ex. 2 at ¶ 19. \n  10 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31   Filed 06/02/20   Page 11 of 12\ncandidates before they can be required to submit them to the Secretary of the State, who in turn \nneeds an additional nine days to review and calculate the total numbers of signatures and report \nback to the towns who has obtained ballot access. Id. \nMr. Bromley admits “that these dates are not set to accommodate the smallest of the offices \non the ballot, but are set to accommodate the largest offices such as statewide offices where \ncandidates collect tens of thousands of signatures.” Id. ¶ 59b. But this is a significant admission \nbecause, in 2020, no statewide offices are up for election. The State therefore leaves unexplained: \nWhy do Registrars of Voters and the Secretary of the State need as much time – sixteen days – to \ncount and verify the signatures, as the candidates need to collect them? It is not said what steps the \nRegistrars or the Secretary must take in order to verify, review, count, or calculate, or why they \nwould require sixteen days. It is therefore the State Defendants’ pure speculation that extension of \nthe deadline to collect signatures would in any way “disturb the election calendar.” It would not.  \n  Under the governing Anderson-Burdick standard, plaintiffs have easily shown a severe \nburden on voters’ associational rights imposed by Connecticut’s Ballot Access Laws, even as \nmodified by Governor Lamont’s executive order. The State Defendants fail to justify the severe \nburdens imposed by Connecticut’s Ballot Access Laws with anything besides the vague invocation \nof “orderly and fair elections,” an interest that plaintiffs and the undersigned share with State \nDefendants. Contrary to the State Defendants’ contentions, the weight of the State Defendants’ \nand the Plaintiffs’ evidence demonstrate a very high likelihood of success on the Plaintiffs’ First \nClaim. The State Defendants’ memorandum fails to address the other three factors weighed by \ncourts considering preliminary injunctions, such as irreparable harm and the public interest. \n  11 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31   Filed 06/02/20   Page 12 of 12\nAs a result, and for the reasons stated above, Plaintiffs’ motion should be granted, and an order \nin the nature of the relief requested in the Motion, ECF No. 9 at pp. 2-3 (prayer for relief), should \nbe issued.  \nDated: June 2, 2020        Respectfully Submitted, \nPLAINTIFFS, ANDY GOTTLIEB, \nLORNA CHAND, JASON BARTLETT, \nAND RICHARD LACOURCIERE, FOR \nTHEMSELVES AND THE PROPOSED \nCLASS OF CONNECTICUT VOTERS   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \nBy:_____/s/_______________ \nAlexander T.

The State of Connecticut’s brief and the Democratic State Central Committee’s brief are \nboth misleading and inaccurate in multiple respects. \n2.  The State alleges that “Connecticut’s overall election scheme is generous.” From my \nexperience as a petitioning candidate in 2018 who did my utmost to get on the Democratic \nprimary ballot for state Senate and was still unsuccessful, I can attest that this is not true.  \n3.  From my research, only Connecticut and New York maintain such severely restrictive \nballot access laws for party primaries; other states require a smaller number of signatures (with a \nmuch longer petitioning period than 14 days) for comparable offices or the payment of a token \nfiling fee to get on the ballot. \n4.  The State maintains that “the candidate may attain primary ballot access if they can \nevidence a sufficient showing of support from their enrolled party members at large.” Permitting \nvoters to sign petitions only within an artificially cramped 14-day window (or even 16 days, per \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 2 of 5\nExecutive Order 7LL) does not allow the enrolled party members a realistic amount of time to \nshow their support.  \n5.  The vast majority of party members I encountered in my 2018 campaign were willing to \nsign my petition.  \n6.  Ted Bromley makes certain assertions about the ease of Plaintiff Bartlett being able to \nattain ballot access given the constraints of 1,028 needed signatures and 10 volunteers within 16 \ndays. I can attest that, in my 2018 campaign, I needed 1,014 signatures and had eight volunteer \npetition circulators (in addition to myself) to collect them in 14 days. Under those conditions, it \nwas next to impossible to secure ballot access. I petitioned every single day, averaging roughly \neight hours a day. Other volunteers’ time commitments varied when available, from \napproximately eight hours to two hours on a particular day. My campaign, working up until the \nlast minute to gain and deliver signatures by the 4:00 PM deadline on the 14th day, submitted \n1,120 signatures, of which 982 were ruled valid by town registrars, falling 32 signatures short of \naccess. I cannot imagine how we could have put in any more effort in such a limited timespan. \n7.  The DSCC alleges that “[T]he lead plaintiff in this case, Andy Gottlieb, in 2018 returned \nto his hometown at age 24, joined the Guilford Democratic Town Committee and announced in \nlate April that he would seek the party endorsement for State Senate.” This is factually incorrect. \nI have lived in Guilford my entire life (and have always been registered to vote there as a \nDemocrat), only temporarily residing elsewhere for college at Wesleyan University, graduate \nschool and various internships (including for Connecticut Democrats’ own Senator Chris \nMurphy in Washington). I resumed living in Guilford full-time in 2017 and started attending \nGuilford Democratic Town Committee (DTC) meetings in June 2017, at the age of 23. Later that \nyear, I became a full member of the DTC, in recognition of my extraordinary efforts supporting \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 3 of 5\nthe Democratic slate in that year’s municipal elections. I performed many of the tasks listed by \nthe DSCC as necessary for party participation, including attending all town committee meetings, \nmaking phone calls and going door to door to hand out campaign literature. I also helmed the \ntown party’s campaign headquarters on at least one occasion. I even canvassed alongside our \nFirst Selectman nominee, who ultimately prevailed in the election, flipping control from \nRepublican to Democratic. \n8.  The DSCC states that, “If some do not want to contribute to the party structure, it may \nmake more sense for them to run outside the Democratic Party… In order to maintain its \nlegitimacy, the Democratic Party must actively discourage party splintering [and] minimize voter \nconfusion at the ballot box.” This is entirely contradictory, both on the facts and in my \nexperience. I have been a duly registered Democrat since I turned 18, and desire the ability to \nmeaningfully participate in the electoral processes of my party. By attempting to run in the party \nprimary, I sought to avoid the possibility of splintering the party by running as an independent \ncandidate in the general election, which could split Democrats’ votes in a first-past-the-post \nelectoral system. The only “voter confusion at the ballot box” I encountered in 2018 was the \ninexplicable lack of a primary for state Senate, even as there were primaries that August for other \nstate offices.  \n9.  Even after what I viewed as a deeply unfair primary process (or lack thereof) in 2018, I \ncontinued volunteering my time to the party, including many hours canvassing to support the \nDemocratic nominee for state Senate in the general election. My party loyalty has never been in \nquestion. \n10.  Being known to the local Democrats in my town, I attempted to go through the party \nstructure in 2018 immediately after the incumbent state senator announced his retirement. When \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 4 of 5\nI contacted local party officials, I was either ignored or, in one case, threatened with political \nreprisal. And in 2020, I was told by a leading party official that the local DTC would endeavor to \nforever keep me off the ballot. \n11.  Jacqueline Kozin states that, “I do know that in the past, the named Plaintiffs in this case \nsought seats that were not open, but rather already held by Democratic incumbents.” This is also \nfactually incorrect. I sought an open state Senate seat in 2018, after the announced retirement of \nthe Democratic incumbent. \n12.  I voted in the following municipal, state and federal elections (minus budget referenda): \n•  August 2012 Democratic Primary for U.S. Senate \n•  November 2012 General Election \n•  November 2014 Midterm Election \n•  April 2016 Democratic Presidential Primary \n•  November 2016 General Election \n•  November 2017 Municipal Election \n•  August 2018 Democratic Primary for Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney \nGeneral and Treasurer \n•  November 2018 Midterm Election \n•  November 2019 Municipal Election \n13.  In all those years of voting, I was never able to vote in a Democratic primary for the \nGeneral Assembly (House District 98 and Senate District 12).  \nI declare under penalty of perjury, pursuant to Title 28, § 1746 of the United States Code, \nthat the foregoing is true, correct, and within my personal knowledge. \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31-1   Filed 06/02/20   Page 5 of 5\n/s/Andy Gottlieb     \nAndy Gottlieb \nDated this 2nd day of June, 2020 \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31-2   Filed 06/02/20   Page 1 of 3\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nDISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT \n \nANDY GOTTLIEB, et al.,      : \n            :    Case No. 3:20-cv-623 \n  Plaintiffs,        : \n            : \n  v.          : \n            : \nNED LAMONT, et al.,      :   \n            : \n  Defendants.        :    June 2, 2020 \n \nDECLARATION AND/OR \n EXPERT REPORT OF JASON W. BARTLETT \n \nI, Jason W. Bartlett, hereby declare this 11th day of May, 2020 based on facts within my \npersonal knowledge: \n1.  I stand by the affidavit that my attorney filed in Court with our motion for a \npreliminary injunction. \n2.  As I expected, although I had significant support, I fell short of the 15% of the \ndelegates necessary to qualify for access to the ballot for the 10th Senate District Democratic Party \nPrimary on August 11, 2020. I received 6 votes out of the total of 53 delegates. \n3.  My  affidavit  also  said  that  going  door-to-door  will  be  impossible.  It  is  not \nimpossible but nearly so, much more difficult than it has been in other years.  \n4.  I went out in my neighborhood today to collect signatures. \n5.  In order for anyone to actually know who I was from walking my dogs or being \nseen in the neighborhood in the last four years, I had to pull my mask down so they could see my \nface.  \n6.  One individual asked me to throw my clipboard with petition across her deck so \nneither of us had to get too close. She did sign. \n  1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31-2   Filed 06/02/20   Page 2 of 3\n7.  Another individual wanted to sign, but went inside to get her own pen because she \nwas worried that someone else had already touched the pen that I was providing.  \n8.   Another individual was just incensed that I was going door-to-door in-person in \nthe time of COVID-19 and refused to even consider signing a petition. \n9.  Theories of how COVID-19 spreads and how it affects a person’s health are \ndifferent and vary from household to household. \n10.  It has been difficult to recruit trained individuals to volunteer or even be hired to \ncollect petition signatures because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n11.  I have also made other efforts to collect petition signatures, such as emailing and \ntexting the petitions, posting them on social media, and posting them on my website.  \n12.  With all of my efforts, I have been able to collect over 150 signatures so far. I will \ncontinue working as diligently as I can with as many individuals as I can to collect as many \nsignatures as I can. However I still believe that if an order from this Court does not issue, time will \nrun out and irreparably harm the ability of myself and other candidates for office to meaningfully \naccess the ballot, unless they are well-connected and have the support of someone like the New \nHaven Democratic Party Chair and can qualify through party convention. \n13.  I have authorized my attorney to settle this case if the number of signatures is \nreduced to one percent of the total number of registered party members in the district and the \nnumber of days is extended by five days to an extra week. I believe that this is more than fair and \nprotects the voters’ First Amendment rights. \n14.  This case is about the voters of New Haven and West Haven and other towns across \nConnecticut, voters in towns dominated by one party or another, voters who will only have a \nrealistic voice in the selection of their elected representatives if they can choose from a full range \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31-2   Filed 06/02/20   Page 3 of 3\nof candidates in the state party primary. Unless candidates are given reasonable access to the ballot \nin the state party primary, Democratic Party insiders will be able to maintain a political monopoly \nover many state senate and state representative districts in our state.  Unless this Court takes action, \nthe ballot access restrictions in the Governor’s order will deny thousands of voters in towns and \ncities across Connecticut the First Amendment right to vote for the candidate of their choice, \nincluding candidates with significant support.  \n15.  The Democratic State Central Committee has supposedly intervened in this lawsuit.  \n16.  As a former State Central Committee member as recently as last month, I know that \nfor a decision like whether to intervene in a lawsuit, State Central Committee members should \nhave been queried and provided a forum as to the question of whether intervention was an \nappropriate response. \n17.  Neither I nor any current member of the Democratic State Central Committee was \nafforded a voice in whether the State Central Committee should be involved in this lawsuit. \n18.  I would argue that the best way to determine the will of the members of the \nDemocratic Party is by having primary elections where the voters are the members of the \nDemocratic Party. \n19.  I want to know why the State Central Committee would not want all Democrats to \nexpress their desires in this time of COVID-19.  \n* * * \nI declare under penalty of perjury, pursuant to Title 28, § 1746 of the United States Code, \nthat the foregoing is true, correct, and within my personal knowledge. \n/s/Jason W.

I am a registered Connecticut voter in New Haven, Connecticut and member of the \nConnecticut Democratic Party. \n2.  I have filed paperwork to run for the office of Registrar of Voters for the City of \nNew Haven.   \n3.  I have experience running campaigns and petition signature drives. I have run four \nprimary campaigns for alderman, five general election campaigns for alderman, one primary for \nState Representative, and one city-wide primary for City Town Clerk. In 2013, I successfully \nsecured over 3,400 signatures of registered Democrats in New Haven for City Town Clerk. That \ntook 18 trained volunteers working every day for ten days.  \n4.  I need to collect over 1,429 signatures of registered Democrats in New Haven to \nqualify for the August 11, 2020 primary. \n5.  I  currently  have  four  people  working  eight  to  nine  hours  per  day  gathering \nsignatures. They have been working since the middle of last week.  \n  1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31-3   Filed 06/02/20   Page 2 of 3\n6.  It has been difficult finding individuals who want to go out and interact with the \npublic due to the COVID-19 crisis so door-to-door canvassing is not producing the same numbers \nas in previous elections. \n7.  There aren’t as many outdoor events that provide large numbers of people, which \nwas a significant contributing factor in my successful petition signature gathering in the past, other \nthan sustained door-to-door efforts. \n8.  Outdoor  concerts,  street  fairs,  community  barbecues,  events  at  New  Haven’s \nInternational Festival of Arts & Ideas, neighborhood community summer popups, Cityseed and \nother farmers’ outdoor markets are simply not being held the way they have been held in the past. \nWithout any open air events that provide significant numbers, it appears we may be unable to get \nthe 1,429 signatures needed to qualify for the August primary. \n9.  This process has been extremely challenging. Many members of the public are \nfrightened to open the door, touch a pen, or interact with anyone coming to the door wearing a \nmask.  \n10.  I have managed to obtain almost 300 signatures so far but I am not sure how many \nare valid yet.  \n11.  I am also trying to get signatures electronically. I have sent over 500 emails with \nonly 8 petitions returned and posted petition on facebook with over 1000 friends and only two \nreturns. I would not consider this an effective or efficient way of collecting signature; some friends \ncould not even print the petition form for signing. The democratic voter list provided by the current \nRegistrars office does not include emails or phone numbers to be able to reach out to voter who \nare democrats; this also contributes to the challenge of getting signatures to be placed on the ballot.  \n12.  I am available to answer any questions the Court may have about my experience.  \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31-3   Filed 06/02/20   Page 3 of 3\n13.  I would like to be added as a plaintiff to this case, so that the requirements for ballot \naccess for my campaign are reduced, as requested in plaintiffs’ motion. \n* * * \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury, pursuant to Title 28, § 1746 of the United States Code, \nthat the foregoing is true, correct, and within my personal knowledge. \nSergio Rodriguez       \nSergio Rodriguez \nDated this 2nd day of June, 2020 \n \n  3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31-4   Filed 06/02/20   Page 1 of 6\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nDISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT \n \nANDY GOTTLIEB, et al.,      : \n            :    Case No. 3:20-cv-623 \n  Plaintiffs,        : \n            : \n  v.          : \n            : \nNED LAMONT, et al.,      :   \n            : \n  Defendants.        :    May 28, 2020 \n \nVERIFIED AFFIDAVIT AND/OR \n EXPERT REPORT OF TAWANA GALBERTH \n \nI, TAWANA GALBERTH, hereby declare this 28TH day of May, 2020 based on facts \nwithin my personal knowledge: \n1.  I am a registered Connecticut voter who resides in New Haven, Connecticut. \n2.  I am the campaign manager for Alex Taubes for CT Senate for the 11th Senate \nDistrict.   \n3.  With Governor Lamont’s order, our campaign needs to collect 1,016 signatures in \nsixteen days, starting on May 26 with a deadline of June 11, 2020 at 4:00pm. \n4.  I have over twenty years of experience working with the Democratic Party with \npetitions and getting signatures. \n5.  Recently, I worked on the Joe Ganim for Governor Campaign in 2018, during \nwhich time the campaign petitioned onto the ballot for the office of Connecticut Governor. To get \non the ballot we needed thousands of signatures, but we were able to successfully get the signatures \nin the required amount of time. \n  1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31-4   Filed 06/02/20   Page 2 of 6\n6.  It is impossible for a candidate to do everything himself. In order for someone to \nget as many signatures as 1,000 or more, a candidate needs to have a dedicated field team of \nworkers who are motivated to work long hours day after day until all of the signatures are collected. \n7.  I have over twenty years of experience putting together teams to collect signatures \non a mass basis, for offices ranging from City Alderman to President of the United States. \n8.  In  my  knowledge,  training,  and  experience,  and  to  a  degree  of  professional \ncertainty, a highly-skilled campaign worker who works hard for seven hours during the day can \ncollect up to 80 or more valid Democratic Party registered voter signatures in New Haven. \n9.  On Tuesday, May 26, the petitions for Eleventh Senate District were finally made \navailable by the Secretary of the State’s Office. We got them on the first day that they were \navailable. \n10.  On every day since then, we have launched with workers to collect signatures so \nthat Alex can qualify for the ballot in the Eleventh Senate District. \n11.  I have recruited, trained, and worked side-by-side with a crew of paid workers to \ncollect the signatures for Alex. \n12.  Among the people who I have recruited to collect signatures is Renee Brown. In \nmy knowledge, training, and experience, Ms. Brown is among the most highly-skilled at collecting \npetition signatures of anybody I have worked with in my twenty years of experience. I have worked \nwith her on campaigns in the past, most recently Toni Harp for Mayor in 2019.  \n13.  In an average seven hour shift, in my knowledge, training, and experience, to a \ndegree of professional certainty, Ms. Brown is able to collect at least 80 valid signatures.  \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31-4   Filed 06/02/20   Page 3 of 6\n14.  COVID-19 has affected everything in our society. Petition signature gathering is \nno exception. In fact, petition signature gathering has become much much more difficult and is \nnow unfair because of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n15.  On Wednesday and Thursday, Ms. Brown put in seven hour shifts and worked hard \nboth days. She walked highly populated areas of Fair Haven within the Eleventh Senate District \nwhere I have experience collecting many hundreds of signatures over the years.  \n16.  On those two days, Ms. Brown was only able to collect a grand total of 12 \nsignatures. Normally I would expect Ms. Brown to collect more than 80 in that time.  \n17.  I personally observed that Ms. Brown was working hard throughout her seven hour \nshifts. Lack of diligence was not the reason for the lack of signatures. \n18.  Another worker I have recruited to collect signatures is Anthony. In my experience \npetitioning on the Ganim campaign, Anthony could collect over 100 signatures in a day. He even \nwon awards for his signature gathering.  \n19.  Anthony worked a seven-hour shift today and was able to collect 13 signatures. \n20.  On the Ganim campaign, it was a reliable shorthand that it cost the campaign about \n$1 to $2 per signature, with workers earning $60-80 per day on a good day. But at the rate that \nhighly-skilled paid petition signature gatherers are collecting signatures during COVID, it will cost \ncampaigns $10 or more per signature, if workers are earning the same $60-80 per day at an hourly \nrate. \n21.  The reason for the lack of signatures – and the added costs and time imposed on \ncandidates – is simple: COVID-19. \n22.  People don’t want to answer their doors because of COVID-19. Not everyone, of \ncourse, but most people. \n  3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31-4   Filed 06/02/20   Page 4 of 6\n23.  Other people don’t even believe that there will be an election because they haven’t \nseen any outreach from our elected leaders about their plans for the coming year. \n24.  Other people are unwilling to sign because they are afraid of getting infected. \n25.  While Ms. Brown was collecting signatures in an apartment building, I received a \ncomplaint from the building manager saying that she was not allowed to go door-to-door. The \nreason given was the COVID-19 pandemic. Alex has a lot of support in the building because he \nlives there. In normal times, multifamily housing is the most accessible place to collect signatures, \nespecially in inclement weather, because the hallways are covered and protected from the rain.  \n26.  The next most accessible place is large gatherings such as festivals, carnivals, \nparades—the type of events that are banned by the Governor’s executive orders and by our Mayor \nright now. Normally in Fair Haven we would have a lot more people on the streets. \n27.  I have been told that people are expected to sign the petitions electronically or by \nmail. \n28.  In my experience, we have never required a person to have a physical home address \n– let alone a computer, an internet connection, and the knowledge to be able to use them – in order \nto participate in elections. I feel that that is unfair practices. \n29.  Also, as a human service worker, I realize that every home does not have a \ncomputer or a phone in it.  \n30.  So how can we fairly expect a person to sign a petition electronically or through \nthe mail, if they do not have a home or a computer or knowledge on how to use these new electronic \nmethods? I do not know how to electronically sign a petition under the Governor’s order and I \nhave been doing this for over twenty years. It is unfair to assume that people have either a computer \nor a mailing address also.  \n  4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31-4   Filed 06/02/20   Page 5 of 6\n31.  Social distancing makes going door-to-door extremely difficult. It also is making \npeople less aware of what’s going on in their community, like how they are going to get out and \nvote. Word of mouth is the most effective GOTV method. But word is not getting out because of \nCOVID. In my twenty years of experience I am noticing things are different because of COVID. \n32.   Organizing the petition signature drive itself has become more difficult because of \nCOVID. I cannot do job interviews for new recruits. I cannot go door-to-door in a group anywhere, \nwhich is something we often do to introduce ourselves to the community. I cannot even take \nvolunteers in a group to train them at getting signatures, because it would require so much close \nin-person interaction. I cannot even take the candidate out walking door-to-door to meet the people. \n33.  We have made strong attempts to put our petition online, on social media, and to \nsend it to people by e-mail and we have followed up. But the sheer number of tasks involved – \nprinting,  signing,  taking  a  picture,  emailing  it  back  –  make  it  time-consuming  and  almost \nimpossible. And we can only get one at a time that way. Door-to-door is much more efficient. That \nis why we do door-to-door. \n34.  Office space is more difficult to get because of the pandemic. Stores we frequent \nduring campaigns – like Staples – are closed or have restricted hours because of the pandemic, \nwhich requires us to drive longer distances to access anything we need for the campaign. \nEverything is being made harder and keeping requirements substantially the same is very unfair. \n35.  The Governor’s order reduces the signatures required by 30% and gives us 2 extra \ndays. Unless he reduces it further, and gives us more time, he will be making it impossible for \npeople like Alex – who have a significant amount of support – to make it on the ballot and be heard \non Election Day. \n  5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 31-4   Filed 06/02/20   Page 6 of 6\n36.  Daily I am receiving phone calls from people who want to work on this campaign \nwho don’t know how it’s going to work because of social distancing. We started planning in \nJanuary and every week and every month things are changing making it impossible to plan \nanything. \n37.  I pray that this Honorable Court will issue a ruling that will protect the voters’ rights \nduring this pandemic, prior to Election Day, so that we have a chance in this.  \n* * * \nI declare under penalty of perjury, pursuant to Title 28, § 1746 of the United States Code, \nthat the foregoing is true, correct, and within my personal knowledge. \n/s/Tawana Galberth     \nSigned Electronically With Assistance of Alex Taubes \nDated this 28th day of May, 2020 \nNOTARIZATION \n   \nSubscribed to and sworn before me, this 28th day of May, 2020, personally, before me. \n \n/s/       \nAlexander T.

I am over 18 years old and a registered Connecticut voter. \n2.  At the heart of politics is person-to-person connection, whether it be door-to-door \ncanvassing, signature collection, or fundraisers.  \n3.  I am running for State Representative in the 24th House District of the Connecticut \nGeneral Assembly as a Democrat.  \n4.  The current COVID-19 pandemic has struck not only at the heart of politics, but \nalso the democratic process we all believe in and fight for. \n5.  Now, more than ever, it is incumbent on those with the power to allow democracy \nto do so. \n6.  I have reviewed the Governor’s Executive Order on ballot access. It does not go far \nenough. \n7.  A reasonable system for ballot access would reduce the number of signatures \nrequired by 80% and greatly expand the window in which to collect them, an extension of 3 weeks. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-4   Filed 05/12/20   Page 2 of 2\n8.  Another possibility is to allow the number of in-district donations as the threshold \nfor being on the ballot, as this can primarily be done online. \n9.  People who know me, know my enthusiasm when it comes to speaking with my \nneighbors and community and under any other circumstances I am more than happy to do so and \nlook forward to it. \n10.  But under the current circumstances, where it is inadvisable to go visit my younger \ncousins, it is also unwise to spend so much time going door-to-door and to be forced by those in \npower to do this to engage in our democratic process running for office. \n11.  It is the responsibility of those in power to use that power correctly and not force \nthose without it to give up their rights and put themselves in harm’s way to have a voice in our \ndemocracy. \n12.  For all of these reasons, I join the above-titled lawsuit and ask that this Honorable \nCourt take the immediate action required by Plaintiffs. \n*\t*\t*\t\nI declare under penalty of perjury, pursuant to Title 28, § 1746 of the United States Code, \nthat the foregoing is true, correct, and within my personal knowledge. \n/s/Richard Lacourciere       \nRichard Lacourciere \nDated this 11th day of May, 2020 \n \nNOTARIZATION \n \nSubscribed to and sworn before me, this 11th day of May, 2020, through Communication \nTechnology pursuant to the terms of Governor Lamont’s Executive Order No. 7Q (3). \n/s/             \nAlexander T.

Celebrezze, 460 U.S. \n780, 787-88 (1983). See also Esshaki v. Whitmer, No. 20-1336, 2020 WL 2185553, at *1 (6th Cir. \nMay 5, 2020) (denying stay of Anderson injunction prohibiting enforcement of ballot access laws \nbecause of COVID-19, but staying district court’s specific remedy).  \nThis action is filed on behalf of all Connecticut voters, all of whom are harmed when \nburdensome state law requirements unjustifiably exclude candidates from ballot access, as they \nthreaten for the August 11, 2020 primary elections. Common questions of both law and fact \npervade this matter, and Defendants have acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable \nto the class as a whole. Simply put, this is the quintessential civil rights class action, and class \ncertification should be granted. \nThe requirements of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b) are amply met. The \nclass is indisputably numerous. The question at the heart of this case binds together all members \nof the class: do Connecticut’s ballot access requirements, as modified by Defendant Lamont’s \n  1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 14-1   Filed 05/18/20   Page 2 of 7\nrecent  executive  order,  severely  and  unjustifiably  burden  voters’  First  Amendment  rights? \nPlaintiffs’ claims are typical of absent class members and their counsel will adequately and \nvigorously represent the class. Finally, Rule 23(b)(2) is satisfied because Defendant Lamont’s \nexecutive order – and his refusal to take further action – is “on grounds that apply generally to the \nclass” and applies to all voters, as would any injunction or declaration providing relief. \nI.  PROPOSED CLASS DEFINITION \nAll registered voters in Connecticut. \nII.  PROPOSED CLASS REPRESENTATIVES \n  The proposed class representatives are the Plaintiffs, active Connecticut registered voters. \nTheir allegations and their affidavits are incorporated by reference. See ECF 8, 9. \nIII.  ARGUMENT \n  Plaintiffs  seek  class  certification  under  Rule  23,  which  requires  determination  of \ncertification “[a]t an early practicable time.” Rule 23(c)(1)(A). “By its terms, [Rule 23] creates a \ncategorical rule entitling a plaintiff whose suit meets the specified criteria to pursue his claim as a \nclass action.” Shady Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393, 398 (2010). \nThese criteria are met here, so class certification should be granted. \n  Civil rights actions like this case are particularly amenable to class action treatment. Rule \n23 was enacted to “facilitate the bringing of class actions in the civil-rights area.” 7A Wright & \nMiller, Federal Practice & Procedure §1775 (3d ed. 2018). The arguments are particularly strong \nfor class action where individuals are unlikely to pursue claims individually. That is this case. \nVoters are unlikely to bring their own individual claims against to fight onerous state law ballot \naccess requirements. See Campbell v. Bysiewicz, 213 F.Supp.2d 152, 157 (D.Conn. July 23, 2002) \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 14-1   Filed 05/18/20   Page 3 of 7\n(noting that the ballot access laws had “systematically denied Connecticut voters over the last 47 \nyears a direct primary for district and state offices.”).  \nFor these reasons, courts routinely certify voting rights classes comprising all candidates, \npotential candidates, voters, and potential voters in cases such as this seeking injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief from onerous restrictions on the franchise. E.g., Paul v. Indiana Election Bd., \n743 F. Supp. 616, 618 (S.D. Ind. 1990) (certifying class of all potential candidates, voters, and \npotential voters in the State of Indiana in voting case). The challenge of bringing individual cases \nis exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, making class action all the more appropriate.  \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Claim Meets the Prerequisites of Rule 23(a) \n  1.  The proposed class is so numerous that joinder would be impractical. \n  Although there is no “magic number” for numerosity, the Second Circuit has held that a \nproposed class with as few as 40 class members should raise a presumption that joinder is \nimpracticable based on numbers alone. See, e.g., Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 936 (2d Cir. \n1993) (citing cases and treatise). See also NEWBERG ON CLASS ACTIONS (5th. ed. 2018) §3.12. \nNumerosity is easily met here, where the class will exceed 1 million Connecticut voters. \n  2.  The proposed class will be adequately represented.  \nTo show adequacy, Plaintiffs and their counsel must show they will “fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the class.” Rule 23(a)(4). For Plaintiffs, that means showing that their \ninterests are not in conflict with the class. “In order to defeat a motion for certification . . . the \nconflict must be fundamental.” In re Flag Telecom Holdings, Ltd. Sec. Litig., 574 F.3d 29, 35 (2d \nCir. 2009). See also Charron v. Wiener, 731 F.3d 241, 251 (2d Cir. 2013). Alleged conflicts must \nalso not be speculative or hypothetical. In re Olsten Corp. Sec. Litig., 3 F. Supp. 2d 286, 296 \n(E.D.N.Y. 1998), opinion adhered to on reconsideration sub nom. In re Olsten Corp., 181 F.R.D. \n  3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 14-1   Filed 05/18/20   Page 4 of 7\n218 (E.D.N.Y. 1998). (“The court finds that this alleged conflict is speculative and hypothetical, \nand should not prevent [appointment of class representatives].”). No conflicts exist here. Plaintiffs’ \nclaims are typical. \n  In addition, counsel must show that they are qualified, experienced, and able to vigorously \nconduct this proposed litigation. That is the case here. The plaintiffs have retained Alexander T. \nTaubes, Esq., a graduate of Yale Law School, who has significant experience in Election Law, \nClass Actions, and Civil Rights. For those reasons and others counsel satisfy the requirements of \nRule 23(g) and should be appointed class counsel. \n  3.  The plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the class. \nTo satisfy typicality, “a class representative must be part of the class and possess the \nsame interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.” Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, \n457 U.S. 147, 156 (1982). Typicality is not a demanding standard: “When it is alleged that the \nsame unlawful conduct . . . affected both the named plaintiff and the class . . . the typicality \nrequirement is usually met irrespective of minor variations in the fact patterns underlying \nindividual claims.” Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 936–37 (2d Cir. 1993). While numerosity \nand commonality “identify the characteristics that make representative litigation appropriate,” \ntypicality, like adequacy of representation, “focus[es] on the desired attributes of the class’s \nrepresentative.” NEWBERG ON CLASS ACTIONS § 3:28 (5th ed.). The requirement is intended “to \nensure that the interests of the class representative[s] are closely aligned with those of the class, \nso that by pursuing [their] own interests the class representative will also promote those of the \nclass.” Id. at § 3:32 (5th ed.). \nHere typicality is easily met. The class representatives are Connecticut voters suffering \nthe same injury as class members—diminished choices at the ballot box, because potentially \n  4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 14-1   Filed 05/18/20   Page 5 of 7\nviable candidates are being excluded from the state party primary. Their First Amendment claim \nis typical – indeed, identical – to all Connecticut voters.  \n  4.  Common issues pervade this litigation \n  Rule 23(a)(2) requires that “questions of law or fact” be “common to the class.” Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(a)(2). Commonality requires the identification of an issue that by its nature “is capable \nof classwide resolution—which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue \nthat is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.” Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, \nInc., 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011). A single common issue is sufficient to establish commonality. Id. \nat 359 (“We quite agree that for purposes of Rule 23(a)(2) even a single common question will do. \n. . .”) (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citations omitted). \nThe named plaintiffs’ claims satisfy the commonality requirement because “each class \nmember’s claim arises from the same course of events, and each class member makes similar legal \narguments to prove the defendant’s liability.” Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas \nHealth and Welfare Fund v. Merck-Medco Managed Care, LLC, 504 F.3d 229, 245 (2d Cir. 2007). \nThe common claim is that the ballot access laws, as modified by Defendant Lamont’s executive \norder, violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Many common issues of law \nand fact predominate over the common claim: the extent to which the ballot access laws, as \nmodified by the order, burden First Amendment rights; the state interests justifying the restrictions; \nwhether to apply strict scrutiny or a lesser scrutiny to the regulations; whether and to what extent \nthe COVID-19 pandemic affects the First Amendment analysis; and many other legal and fact \nquestions are common among Plaintiffs and all Connecticut voters. \nOf course there are differences among Connecticut voters. Some people eligible to vote \nmay prefer not to vote, while others are enthusiastic about voting, for example. But as courts have \n  5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 14-1   Filed 05/18/20   Page 6 of 7\nrepeatedly recognized, even under the more stringent standards applicable to class actions that seek \ndamages under Rule 23(b)(3), class action treatment is appropriate despite the existence of \nindividual differences among class members. Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo, --- U.S. ---, 136 \nS.Ct. 1036, 1045 (2016) (“When one or more of the central issues in the action are common to the \nclass and can be said to predominate, the action may be considered proper under Rule 23(b)(3) \neven though other important matters will have to be tried separately, such as damages or some \naffirmative defenses peculiar to some individual class members.”) (internal quotation marks and \ncitations omitted). Where as here, the commonalities are readily apparent, Rule 23 is amply \nsatisfied.  \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Claim Meets the Requirements of Rule 23(b)(2)  \n  Plaintiffs’ claim fits within Rule 23(b)(2), which applies when “the party opposing the class \nhas acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, so that final injunctive \nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate with respect to the class as a whole.” The \n“prime examples” of Rule 23(b)(2) cases, Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 614 \n(1997), are civil rights cases like this one, where the defendants have engaged in unlawful behavior \ntoward a defined group. The rule applies, moreover, where “a single injunction or declaratory \njudgment would provide relief to each member of the class” (as opposed, for example, to cases in \nwhich each class member would need an individual injunction or declaration, or in which each \nclass member would be entitled to an individualized award of money damages). Dukes, 564 U.S. \nat 360-61.  \n  Plaintiffs’  First  Claim,  on  which  they  seek  class  certification  today,  satisfies  these \nrequirements. Defendants have engaged in unconstitutional behavior toward the entire class. Every \nmember of the class is at risk of being denied “an effective platform for the expression of views \n  6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 14-1   Filed 05/18/20   Page 7 of 7\non the issues of the day,” Anderson, supra p. 1, because Defendants’ activities will prevent \nlegitimate candidates from accessing the ballot for the August 11, 2020 primary elections. And, \nbecause every member of the class is entitled to relief from this unconstitutional conduct, an \nappropriate injunction or declaration will provide relief on a class-wide basis. “The key to the \n(b)(2) class is the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted – the notion \nthat the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class \nmembers or as to none of them.” Dukes, 564 U.S. at 360. That is this case. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n  Class  certification  should  be  granted,  Plaintiffs  should  be  appointed  as  class \nrepresentatives, and the undersigned should be appointed as class counsel.  \nDated: May 18, 2020          Respectfully Submitted, \nPLAINTIFFS, ANDY GOTTLIEB, \nLORNA CHAND, RICHARD \nLACOURCIERE, AND JASON \nBARTLETT, FOR THEMSELVES AND \nTHE PROPOSED CLASS   \n       \nBy:    /s/     \nAlexander T.

This is a civil rights action challenging Connecticut state law requirements to  \n(1) collect in-person signatures to access the ballot for the August 11, 2020 primary election; \nand (2) use in-person ballots for the August 11 primary and the November 3 general elections, \nwith few exceptions that exclude Plaintiffs and thousands of other voters. Plaintiffs, for \nthemselves and a class of all Connecticut voters whose rights are at risk, seek a declaratory \njudgment that the requirements are violations of the Constitution of the United States, especially \ngiven COVID-19, and seek injunctive relief should Defendants fail to remedy the alleged \nconstitutional violations promptly.  \n2.  Connecticut is facing the worst pandemic in modern history. Connecticut has \namong the strictest ballot access and absentee voting laws in the country. Without action by \nDefendants or this Court’s intervention, the combination of Connecticut’s strict ballot access \nand absentee voting laws and the COVID-19 pandemic will place an unconstitutional severe \nundue burden on voters seeking to vote for the candidate of their choice. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 1   Filed 05/06/20   Page 2 of 13\n3.  Unless remedied, Plaintiffs and thousands of Connecticut voters will have their \nchoice of primary candidate unduly and unjustifiably restricted by Connecticut’s Ballot Access \nLaws, infra pp. 4-6, which can require thousands of signatures on paper petitions for candidates \nto access the ballot.  \n4.  Unless remedied, Connecticut’s Absentee Ballot Laws, infra p. 6, will give \nPlaintiffs and thousands of Connecticut voters a stark choice in the primary and general \nelections: either risk infection from a dangerous disease by voting in person; vote by mail \nutilizing the excuses provided for under state law and risk criminal prosecution for false \nstatement; or be disenfranchised. \n5.  Recent events in Wisconsin demonstrate the disarray and voter confusion that \nresults from inadequately planned elections held during a pandemic. As the Supreme Court of \nthe United States has stated, “lower federal courts should ordinarily not alter the election rules \non the eve of an election.” Republican Nat'l Comm. v. Democratic Nat'l Comm., 140 S. Ct. \n1205, 1207 (2020) (citing Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1 (2006) (per curiam)). Plaintiffs, \nConnecticut voters, thus file this suit to force action at the earliest possible time. \nA.  Parties \n6.  Plaintiff Andy Gottlieb is a citizen of the State of Connecticut and a registered \nvoter. Plaintiff Gottlieb wants to vote for a wider variety of candidates, but he is restricted from \ndoing so by Connecticut’s Ballot Access Laws. Plaintiff ran for state senate in 2018 but he fell \nshort of ballot access by 32 signatures because of the Ballot Access Laws. Plaintiff would likely \nrun again for state representative or state senator, but for the existence and likely enforcement of \nthe Ballot Access Laws.  Plaintiff Gottlieb also believes it is his duty as a conscientious citizen \n \n2 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 1   Filed 05/06/20   Page 3 of 13\nto protect his own safety and the safety of others by voting by mail, but he is restricted from \ndoing so by Connecticut’s Absentee Ballot Laws. \n7.  Plaintiff Lorna Chand is a citizen of the State of Connecticut and a registered \nvoter. Plaintiff Chand wants to vote for a wider variety of candidates, but she is restricted from \ndoing so by Connecticut’s Ballot Access Laws. Plaintiff Chand was Plaintiff Gottlieb’s \ntreasurer in the 2018 election, and was prevented from voting for the candidate of her choice, \nPlaintiff Gottlieb, because of the Ballot Access Laws. Plaintiff Chand is a frontline essential \nworker and believes it is her duty to protect her own safety and the safety of others by voting by \nmail, but she is restricted from doing so by Connecticut’s Absentee Ballot Laws.  \n8.  Defendant Ned Lamont is the Governor of the State of Connecticut and its chief \nexecutive officer. Because he has declared a public health emergency, he has the right to modify \nor suspend any Connecticut statute, Conn. Gen. Stat. Sec. 28-9, but his emergency powers may \nexpire before the November election, id. He is sued in his official capacity. \n9.  Defendant Denise Merrill is the Secretary of the State of Connecticut. She is \nConnecticut’s chief election official and is responsible for causing petitions for access to the \nballot to issue under Connecticut State Law. She is sued in her official capacity. \nB.   Jurisdiction \n10.  Because this action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, jurisdiction is \ninvoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n11.  Venue is proper in this Court by virtue of 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because the events \ngiving rise to the claims occurred in the District of Connecticut and the defendants reside in the \nDistrict of Connecticut. \n \n3 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 1   Filed 05/06/20   Page 4 of 13\n12.  Plaintiffs’ action for declaratory and injunctive relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201, 2202, as well as by Rules 23, 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nC.   Factual Allegations \na)  Ballot Access Laws \n13.  Connecticut General Statutes Section 9-400 allows a candidate for the office of \nstate representative or state senator to qualify for the ballot for a political party’s primary \nelection in two ways: by receiving at least 15% of the votes of the delegates at a convention \nheld by that political party; or by circulating a petition and obtaining the signatures of five \npercent of the enrolled members of the party in the district.  \n14.  The gathering of petition signatures is governed by Connecticut General Statutes \nSections 9-404a to 9-404c, inclusive. Candidates are given until 4:00p.m. on the fourteenth day \nafter petitions are made available to collect and submit signatures from five percent of the party \nmembers in the district.  \n15.  In 2018, Plaintiffs were the candidate and the treasurer, respectively, of a \ncampaign for state senate that failed to qualify for the ballot by convention and was required to \ncollect the signatures of 1,014 registered Democrats, five percent of the registered Democrats in \nthe district. \n16.   Plaintiffs’ campaign turned in 1,120 signatures, of which 982 were found to be \nvalid, 32 signatures short of ballot access.1 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Plaintiffs were 32 signatures short, according to the count of the registrars of voters in the \nmunicipalities of the district in which they were seeking office, Connecticut’s Twelfth Senate \nDistrict, comprising the towns of Madison, Guilford, Killingworth, Durham, Branford, and \nNorth Branford. However, upon information and belief, employees of Defendant Merrill sought \nto disqualify additional signatures, because the back of some of the pages of the petitions were \nallegedly incorrectly filled out by one of Plaintiffs’ petition circulators. \n \n4 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 1   Filed 05/06/20   Page 5 of 13\n17.  Plaintiffs would have had enough signatures to run for governor of Ohio, \nmember of Congress from Pennsylvania, or U.S. Senator from Oregon, but Plaintiffs were \ndenied ballot access in the party primary. As a result, the candidate endorsed at convention ran \nunopposed. \n18.   Plaintiffs seek to prevent the unconstitutional operation of the Ballot Access \nLaws from again denying voters the right to vote for the candidate of their choice. Time is short. \nIn the upcoming election, currently, petitions will be made available by the Secretary of the \nState on May 26, and must be turned in to the Secretary of the State’s office by June 9 at \n4:00p.m. \n19.   The difficulty of obtaining so many signatures in so short a time is compounded \nby other arcane elements of Connecticut’s ballot access laws. As one example, no page of any \npetition may contain the names of enrolled political party members residing in different towns, \nrequiring petition circulators to carry around separate packs of paper for each of the towns in \nmulti-town districts. Conn. Gen. Stat. Sec. 9-404b(c).  \n20.  And crucially for this case, petition circulators must attest, under penalties of \nfalse statement, “that each person whose name appears on the page signed the petition in person \nin the presence of the circulator, . . . .” Id (emphasis added). \n21.  The Ballot Access Laws do not burden all political groups equally.  \n22.  Because incumbents have a well-developed network of campaign contributors, \nsupporters well-versed in the process, the loyalty of party bosses, and the advantages of their \nofficial office, they almost always garner more than 15% of the delegates at state conventions \nand rarely need to gather signatures at all.  \n \n5 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 1   Filed 05/06/20   Page 6 of 13\n23.  On the other hand, new candidates who are either challenging incumbents or \nrunning for a vacant seat – and who already face an uphill battle in getting on the ballot – must \noften collect thousands of signatures in order to qualify for ballot access. \n24.  Because incumbents, in particular, are advantaged by the Ballot Access Laws, \nvoters’ right to vote for the candidate of their choice is severely restricted. When incumbents are \nmore difficult to challenge, more run unopposed. Unopposed elections are very common in \nConnecticut, much more common than in places with less restrictive Ballot Access Laws. \nb)  Absentee Ballot Laws \n25.  Connecticut voters are allowed to vote by mail-in absentee ballot only under six \nspecific circumstances outlined in Connecticut statute: (1) active military service; (2) absence \nfrom one’s town of residence “during all of the hours of voting,” which in Connecticut is \n6:00a.m. to 8:00p.m.; (3) his or her illness; (4) his or her physical disability; (5) religious \nreasons; or (6) service as a poll worker other than in one’s town. Conn. Gen. Stat. Sec. 9-135.  \n26.  Neither Plaintiff is eligible for absentee voting under the statute.  \n27.  False statement on an application for an absentee ballot is a class D felony under \nConnecticut law. Conn. Gen. Stat. Sec. 9-359a.   \nc)  COVID-19  \n28.   “Social distancing” measures will likely remain in effect in some form at the \ntime of the May 26—June 9, 2020 petition gathering period, at the time of the August 11, 2020 \nprimary, and at the time of the November 3, 2020 general election. Even if federal, state, and \nlocal “social distancing” protocols are lifted, public health officials warn that in all likelihood \nsuch protocols could be re-imposed during another wave of COVID-19. \n \n6 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 1   Filed 05/06/20   Page 7 of 13\n29.   Public health researchers have concluded that there will be significant barriers to \nwide-scale in-person voting even in August and November 2020. \n30.  Defendant Lamont has postponed Connecticut’s presidential primary from April \n28, 2020 to August 11, 2020, an admission of the severe burden that COVID-19 imposes on \nvoters and the impossibility of maintaining a free and fair election without the ability to vote by \nmail, which most voters, like the Plaintiffs, cannot do because of the Absentee Ballot Laws. \n31.   Defendant Merrill has announced that she will mail an absentee ballot \napplication to every voter in advance of the August 11, 2020 primary election.  \n32.  Additionally, Defendant Merrill has requested that Defendant Lamont use his \nemergency powers to modify the Absentee Ballot Laws, but as of the time of this filing, he has \nfailed to do so. But upon information and belief, Defendant Merrill has not made any public \nrequest regarding the Ballot Access Laws. \n33.  As Defendant Merrill has admitted, “[w]e are on the precipice of disaster” \nregarding the conduct of the upcoming elections. Plaintiffs bring this action to guarantee the \nright to vote for themselves and their fellow citizens amid the chaos and uncertainty of the \npandemic.  \n34.  Circulating petitions for signature is not listed as an “essential business” under \nany of Defendant Lamont’s emergency public health orders. The health crisis coupled with the \nDefendant’s stay-at-home orders make it impossible to gather enough signatures in enough time \nfor candidates with significant support to access the ballot unless they attain the support of 15% \nof party delegates at a convention. This will, unless remedied, severely restrict the ability of \nPlaintiffs and other voters to vote for the candidate of their choice. \n \n \n7 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 1   Filed 05/06/20   Page 8 of 13\nd)   Special Grounds for Injunctive Relief \n35.  This Court concluded, almost twenty years ago, that the 15% convention \ndelegate requirement, standing alone, likely fails to protect rights of free association of voters \nseeking to vote for the candidate of their choice. Campbell v. Bysiewicz, 213 F. Supp. 2d 152 \n(D.Conn. 2002) (Dorsey, J.). The remedy in that case came when the General Assembly created \nthe ability to gather petition signatures. But the health crisis renders that remedy meaningless \nwithout further relief.  \n36.  Without action, nearly every voter in Connecticut will face a legally significant \nincreased burden on their voting rights and their associational rights amid the COVID-19 \npandemic. Defendants’ continued inaction will force voters to choose from a more restricted set \nof candidates. Defendants’ continued inaction will force voters to choose risking infection or \nbeing disenfranchised. \n37.  This case must proceed quickly before the Purcell deadline established by the \nSupreme Court. Each day that passes increases the risk of voter confusion in the August 11 and \nNovember 3 elections. Plaintiffs, from their experience in 2018, understand close calls and the \nneed for urgent action. A real and actual controversy exists between the parties, Plaintiffs have \nno actual remedy at law other than this action, and Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm until \nthey obtain relief from this Court.  \nD.  Class Allegations \n  38.  Plaintiffs bring this case on their own behalf and on behalf of a class of all \nConnecticut voters, including a subclass of voters ineligible to receive absentee ballots under \nthe Absentee Ballot Laws. \n \n8 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 1   Filed 05/06/20   Page 9 of 13\n  39.  The class consists of over a million people and is so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable. \n  40.  Plaintiffs’ claims are common to and typical of the class and subclass, that is, the \nability of all members of the class to vote for candidates of their choice is burdened by \nConnecticut’s Ballot Access Laws, and all the right to vote of all members of the subclass is \nburdened by Connecticut’s Absentee Ballot Laws. \n  41.  Plaintiffs and their counsel will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nclass and subclass. No conflicts of interest exist between Plaintiffs or their counsel and the class \nor subclass. Plaintiffs’ counsel, Attorney Alexander T. Taubes, Esq., has done substantial work \nin identifying and investigating potential claims in this action; has experience in handling class \nactions, Noble v. Northland, UWY-CV16-6033559-S (Conn. Super. Ct.) (class counsel through \ninvestigation, discovery, motion practice, class certification, and settlement of class action on \nbehalf of approximately 1,000 former residents of a New Haven public housing complex), other \ncomplex litigation, and the types of claims asserted in the action, Pereira v. State Elections \nEnforcement Commission, HHB-CV19-6054160-S (Conn. Super. Ct.) (declaratory judgment \naction regarding Connecticut campaign finance law); has knowledge of the applicable law; and \nresources that he will commit to representing the class and subclass. \n  42.  Defendant Lamont and Defendant Merrill have acted or refused to act on \ngrounds that apply generally to the class and subclass, so that final injunctive relief or \ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class and subclass as a whole. \n \n \n \n \n9 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 1   Filed 05/06/20   Page 10 of 13\nD.   Claims for Relief \nFirst Claim: Unconstitutional Abridgment of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nConstitution of the United States by Defendants Lamont and Merrill, pursuant to  \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Campbell v. Bysiewicz, for Enforcement of the Ballot Access Laws \n  43.  The allegations above are incorporated as if included fully here.  \n44.  Even without the circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic, \nConnecticut’s ballot access laws unduly burden and violate Plaintiffs’ right to petition, speech, \nand free association protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of \nthe United States, including by having a “chilling effect” on the ability of individuals such as \nPlaintiff Gottlieb to run for office in the first place.   \n45.  Under the circumstances of the pandemic, enforcement of the Ballot Access \nLaws will violate the Constitution as applied. The requirements of the Ballot Access Laws are \nnot only difficult to achieve on their face, but unsafe and impossible amid the pandemic. If \nundisturbed, enforcement of the Ballot Access Laws will unduly and unjustifiably restrict \nPlaintiffs’ First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. \n46.  The Ballot Access Laws trigger strict scrutiny because of the burden they impose \non Plaintiffs’ associational rights, scrutiny that the Ballot Access Laws cannot survive. But \nunder the circumstances of this case, including federal, state, and local shelter-in-place orders \namid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ballot Access Laws fail even rational basis review.   \nSecond Claim: Unconstitutional Abridgment of the First and Fourteenth Amendment to \nthe Constitution of the United States by Defendants Lamont and Merrill, pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983, for Enforcement of the Absentee Ballot Laws \n  47.  The allegations above are incorporated as if included fully here.  \n48.  Voting and participating in the electoral process is a form of expression which is \nthe ultimate form of political speech. In light of the Supreme Court’s cases giving strong First \n \n10 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 1   Filed 05/06/20   Page 11 of 13\nAmendment protection to campaign funds spent to influence voters, the voters and their votes \nthemselves can hardly be entitled to less protection.  \n49.  As a restriction on free speech and association, the Absentee Ballot Laws must \ntherefore be judged under the standard of strict scrutiny, a scrutiny that the Absentee Ballot \nLaws cannot survive under ordinary circumstances, much less under the extraordinary \ncircumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n  50.  Restricting access to absentee ballots only to the six identified categories in \nConnecticut law is not necessary or narrowly-tailored to any compelling state interest.  \nThird Claim: Violation of Procedural Due Process for Vagueness in Violation of the \nFourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States by Defendants Lamont \nand Merrill, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for Enforcement of the Absentee Ballot Laws \n  51.  The allegations above are incorporated as if included fully here.  \n  52.  Should Defendant Lamont fail to act to expand absentee ballot eligibility, \nthousands of voters will be mailed absentee ballot applications by Defendant Merrill, which \nthey will be ineligible to complete. Completing the applications falsely could subject the voters \nto criminal prosecution.  \n  53.  A restriction to the right to vote due to the vagueness of a statutory provision \ncreates conditions on the right to vote that violates voters’ Due Process rights. \n54.  The Absentee Ballot Laws violate Plaintiffs and other voters’ Due Process rights \nbecause the law, under the circumstances, fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence with a \nreasonable opportunity to understand whether or not they are permitted to vote by mail during \nthe COVID-19 pandemic. \n55.  The Absentee Ballot Laws also violate Plaintiffs and other voters’ Due Process \nrights because the confusion that results amid the pandemic may encourage arbitrary and \n \n11 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 1   Filed 05/06/20   Page 12 of 13\ndiscriminatory enforcement, bar access to the right to vote, and increase the risk of criminal \nprosecution.  \nFourth Claim: Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates by Defendants Lamont and Merrill, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for Enforcement \nof the Absentee Ballot Laws \n  56.  The allegations above are incorporated as if included fully here.  \n57.  The Absentee Ballot Laws violate the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection \nClause because the state allows some voters to access absentee ballots but not others, treating \nsimilarly situated voters differently. Because of the pandemic, Plaintiffs are similarly situated to \nvoters who are eligible for absentee ballots, but Plaintiffs are denied eligibility to vote absentee \nby Connecticut’s Absentee Ballot Laws.  \n58.   No rational interest exists in putting citizens’ health at risk in voting, rendering \nthe state’s activities in enforcing the Absentee Ballot Laws unconstitutional.  \nE.   Prayer for Relief \nWHEREFORE, the plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief: \nA. Certification under 28 U.S.C. §2403 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.1 that the constitutionality of \na state statute has been questioned; \nB.  Certification of a class and subclass under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2); \nC.  Declaratory judgment that enforcement of the Absentee Ballot Laws and Ballot Access \nLaws described above violate the Plaintiffs’ rights under the Constitution of the United \nStates as guaranteed by 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and an order allowing Defendants a \nreasonable but prompt amount of time to correct the violations; \n \n12 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 1   Filed 05/06/20   Page 13 of 13\nD. In the event that a reasonable time elapses and no action is taken, an order in the nature \nof an injunction relieving the unconstitutionally unacceptable burdens imposed by the \nenforcement of the Absentee Ballot Laws and Ballot Access Laws; \nE.  Attorney’s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and costs; and  \nF.  Such other and further relief as the Court may deem proper. \nDated: May 6, 2020        Respectfully Submitted, \nPLAINTIFFS, ANDY GOTTLIEB AND \nLORNA CHAND, FOR THEMSELVES \nAND ALL OTHERS SIMILARLY \nSITUATED   \n \n \n \n       \nBy:_____/s/_______________ \nAlexander T.

      "text": "Case 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 8   Filed 05/12/20   Page 1 of 18\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nDISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT \n \nANDY GOTTLIEB, et al.,      : \n            :    Case No. 3:20-cv-623-JCH \n  Plaintiffs,        : \n            : \n  v.          : \n            : \nNED LAMONT, et al.,      :   \n            : \n  Defendants.        :    May 12, 2020 \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  \nFOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n1.  This civil rights class action was brought May 6, 2020 to address impending \nviolations of the First Amendment by Defendants’ threatened enforcement, despite the COVID-\n19 pandemic, of Connecticut’s strict state law requirements to (1) collect in-person petition \nsignatures for ballot access and (2) vote in-person at polling places unless voters meet one of six \nstatutory “excuses” that exclude thousands of voters including Plaintiffs.  \n2.  On May 11, 2020, Defendant Governor Ned Lamont issued Executive Order \n7LL, making changes to Connecticut’s petitioning process for ballot access, but not the process \nfor obtaining absentee ballots. \n3.  As Defendant Lamont’s executive order says, COVID-19 is a highly contagious \nrespiratory disease that has caused a pandemic resulting in mass severe illness and death, \nespecially for individuals who are 60 or older or for those with chronic health conditions, and \npublic health experts have concluded that it is possible to transmit COVID-19 even before a \nperson shows symptoms and through aerosol transmission. \n4.  As Defendant Lamont further stated, to reduce the spread of COVID-19, the U.S. \nCDC and the CT DPH have recommended implementation of community mitigation strategies \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 8   Filed 05/12/20   Page 2 of 18\nto slow transmission of the virus, including cancellation of gatherings of ten people or more and \nsocial distancing in smaller settings. \n5.   Defendant Lamont further stated that there exists a compelling interest in \nreducing the risk of transmission of COVID-19 among candidates seeking election, their \nsupporters who are seeking to contact potential voters, and the public at large. \n6.  Defendant Lamont admitted that the COVID-19 pandemic makes it more \ndifficult for candidates to meet the existing statutory petitioning requirements to qualify for \nballot access because fewer people are going outside or to public places and some people may \nbe less willing to have in-person interactions with candidates or their supporters. Defendant \nLamont omitted that his “stay home, stay safe” executive orders also fail to list petition \nsignature gathering as an essential business or activity. \n7.  Defendant Lamont admitted that in-person interactions needed under the \npetitioning statutes may further the potential transmission of COVID-19 during an ongoing \npublic health emergency. \n8.  However, Defendant Lamont’s executive order fails to remedy the problem that \nit recognizes. In fact, it requires candidates to handle thousands of additional pages of \npaperwork in order to qualify for the ballot, more paper than candidates would have required if \nthe old petitioning requirements were left in place. \n 9.  Defendant Lamont’s order introduces a cumbersome new mechanism for \ncollecting in-person petition signatures that are still required to be signed by hand and will \nrequire hundreds of in-person interactions or a massive mailing using U.S. mail that would cost \nthousands of dollars and still risk meeting the deadline, which has been extended only two days. \n \n2 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 8   Filed 05/12/20   Page 3 of 18\n10.  Specifically, Defendant Lamont’s cumbersome new mechanism requires the \nfollowing: \n (i) an enrolled party member signs a petition containing only his or her signature \nthat is mailed by U.S. mail to the candidate and later to the registrar of the \nmunicipality by the applicable deadline; or (ii) an enrolled party member signs a \npetition containing only his or her signature, which signature may be scanned or \nphotographed electronically and sent by electronic mail to the candidate and later \nto the registrar of the municipality by the applicable deadline along with a copy of \nthe email demonstrating the electronic transmission of the petition by the enrolled \nparty member. Any petition submitted in accordance with subdivisions (i) or (ii) \nof this subsection shall contain the information required under sections 9-404a \nthrough 9-404c, and 9-406, 9-409 and 9-410 of the General Statutes and shall \ninclude a statement by the enrolled party member attesting to his or her identity, \nqualification as an elector and enrolled party member and shall be signed under \nthe penalties of false statement.\tIf more than one signature is on a petition page, \nall the requirements of sections 9-404b and 9-410 of the General Statutes must be \nsatisfied,  provided  that  any  existing  Executive  Orders  governing  remote \nnotarizations may be utilized. Nothing in this Order shall preclude petitioning by \nany  other  means  set  forth  in  sections  9-404a  through  9-404c  of  the  General \nStatutes.   \n11.   This cumbersome new mechanism requires petitions to be mailed or dropped off \nat voters’ homes unless the candidate has the email address of a voter with a printer and a \nscanner or photographic device with email capability. Voters are then required to mail, scan and \nemail, or leave the signed petition at their homes for candidates to pick up. Each voter must use \ntheir own piece of paper for their own petition, resulting in an explosion of paper forms not \npreviously required to be individually printed for each voter. This procedure is more difficult \nthan it was to go door-to-door to collect signatures before COVID-19. It is a mess. \n12.  Although this cumbersome new mechanism was introduced just days before \npetition signatures are required to be collected, the number of signatures required has been \nreduced only thirty percent under Defendant Lamont’s order, a paltry discount given the \ndifficulties the order necessarily entails. For candidates running for the district offices of state \nrepresentative or state senator, that will be 3.5% of all registered party members in the district, \n \n3 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 8   Filed 05/12/20   Page 4 of 18\ndown from 5% of all registered party members under the old system. This will still require in \nexcess of 500 signatures from registered Democrats in many districts. It is likely impossible. \n13.  The governor’s order gives candidates only two extra days to collect the petitions \nof 3.5% of all registered party members in the district. Plaintiffs would need at least an extra \nmonth to gather so many signatures given (1) COVID-19, (2) Defendant Lamont’s “stay home, \nstay safe” orders, and (3) the cumbersome new mechanism for obtaining the signatures under \nthe latest executive order. It is completely unreasonable. \n14.  After Defendant Lamont issued his order, counsel for the Defendants emailed it \nto counsel for the Plaintiffs. Counsel then met and conferred by phone regarding the instant \nlitigation. Counsel for the Defendants represented that Defendant Lamont’s order was final, and \nrepresented that this Court was the only available avenue for Plaintiffs to seek relief, inviting \nthis amended complaint and emergency motion practice.  \n15.  Without this Court’s intervention, Connecticut’s still-strict ballot access laws as \nwell as its absentee voting laws—which remain unchanged—will place an unconstitutional \nsevere undue burden on candidates running for office and voters seeking to vote for the \ncandidate of their choice, given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. \n16.  Recent events in Wisconsin demonstrate the disarray and voter confusion that \nresults from inadequately planned elections held during a pandemic. As the Supreme Court of \nthe United States has stated, “lower federal courts should ordinarily not alter the election rules \non the eve of an election.” Republican Nat'l Comm. v. Democratic Nat'l Comm., 140 S. Ct. \n1205, 1207 (2020) (citing Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1 (2006) (per curiam)). Plaintiffs, \nConnecticut voters, thus file this suit to force action at the earliest possible time. \n \n \n4 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 8   Filed 05/12/20   Page 5 of 18\nA.  Parties \n17.  Plaintiff Andy Gottlieb is a citizen of the State of Connecticut and a registered \nvoter. Plaintiff Gottlieb wants to vote for a wider variety of candidates, but he is restricted from \ndoing so by Connecticut’s Ballot Access Laws, even as modified by Defendant Lamont’s \nexecutive order. Plaintiff ran for state senate in 2018 but he fell short of ballot access by 32 \nsignatures because of the Ballot Access Laws. Plaintiff would likely run again for state \nrepresentative or state senator, but for the existence and likely enforcement of the Ballot Access \nLaws as modified by Defendant Lamont’s executive order.  Plaintiff Gottlieb also believes it is \nhis duty as a conscientious citizen to protect his own safety and the safety of others by voting by \nmail, but he is restricted from doing so by Connecticut’s Absentee Ballot Laws. \n18.  Plaintiff Lorna Chand is a citizen of the State of Connecticut and a registered \nvoter. Plaintiff Chand wants to vote for a wider variety of candidates, but she is restricted from \ndoing so by Connecticut’s Ballot Access Laws as modified by Defendant Lamont’s executive \norder. Plaintiff Chand was Plaintiff Gottlieb’s treasurer in the 2018 election, and was prevented \nfrom voting for the candidate of her choice, Plaintiff Gottlieb, because of the Ballot Access \nLaws. Plaintiff Chand is a frontline essential worker and believes it is her duty to protect her \nown safety and the safety of others by voting by mail, but she is restricted from doing so by \nConnecticut’s Absentee Ballot Laws.  \n19.  Plaintiff Jason W. Bartlett is a citizen of the State of Connecticut and a registered \nvoter. Plaintiff Bartlett is a candidate for the 10th State Senate District of the Connecticut \nGeneral Assembly with significant support, but he is unlikely to obtain ballot access by state \nparty convention. Because he is unlikely to obtain ballot access by convention, and Defendant \nLamont’s executive order fails to relieve the significant burden of gathering in-person petition \n \n5 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 8   Filed 05/12/20   Page 6 of 18\nsignatures, Plaintiff Bartlett will be precluded from ballot access unless action is taken by this \nCourt. Each day that passes without action hinders Plaintiff Bartlett’s campaign for public \noffice, because even if an alternative form of petition gathering is created, the time for planning \nand organizing the logistics of a significant ballot access drive is limited in advance of the \nAugust 11 primary, and rapidly elapsing.  \n20.  Plaintiff Richard Lacourciere is a citizen of the State of Connecticut and a \nregistered voter. Plaintiff Lacourciere is a candidate for the 24th State Representative District of \nthe Connecticut General Assembly with significant support, but he is unlikely to obtain ballot \naccess by state party convention. Because he is unlikely to obtain ballot access by convention, \nand Defendant Lamont’s executive order fails to relieve the significant burden of gathering in-\nperson petition signatures, Plaintiff Lacourciere will be precluded from ballot access unless \naction is taken by this Court. Each day that passes without action hinders Plaintiff Lacourciere’s \ncampaign for public office, because even if another alternative form of petition gathering is \ncreated, the time for planning and organizing the logistics of a significant ballot access drive is \nlimited in advance of the August 11 primary, and rapidly elapsing. \n21.  Defendant Ned Lamont is the Governor of the State of Connecticut and its chief \nexecutive officer. Because he has declared a public health emergency, he has the right to modify \nor suspend any Connecticut statute, Conn. Gen. Stat. Sec. 28-9, but his emergency powers may \nexpire before the November election, id. He is sued in his official capacity. \n22.  Defendant Denise Merrill is the Secretary of the State of Connecticut. She is \nConnecticut’s chief election official and is responsible for causing petitions for access to the \nballot to issue under Connecticut State Law. She is sued in her official capacity. \n \n \n6 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 8   Filed 05/12/20   Page 7 of 18\nB.   Jurisdiction \n23.  Because this action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, jurisdiction is \ninvoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n24.  Venue is proper in this Court by virtue of 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because the events \ngiving rise to the claims occurred in the District of Connecticut and the defendants reside in the \nDistrict of Connecticut. \n25.  Plaintiffs’ action for declaratory and injunctive relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201, 2202, as well as by Rules 23, 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nC.   Factual Allegations \na)  Ballot Access Laws \n26.  Connecticut General Statutes Section 9-400 allows a candidate for the office of \nstate representative or state senator to qualify for the ballot for a political party’s primary \nelection in two ways: by receiving at least 15% of the votes of the delegates at a convention \nheld by that political party; or by circulating a petition and obtaining the signatures of five \npercent of the enrolled members of the party in the district.  \n27.  The gathering of petition signatures is governed by Connecticut General Statutes \nSections 9-404a to 9-404c, inclusive. Candidates are given until 4:00p.m. on the fourteenth day \nafter petitions are made available to collect and submit signatures from five percent of the party \nmembers in the district.  \n28.  In 2018, Plaintiff Gottlieb and Plaintiff Chand were the candidate and the \ntreasurer, respectively, of a campaign for state senate that failed to qualify for the ballot by \nconvention and was required to collect the signatures of 1,014 registered Democrats, five \npercent of the registered Democrats in the district. \n \n7 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 8   Filed 05/12/20   Page 8 of 18\n29.   Plaintiff Gottlieb’s 2018 campaign turned in 1,120 signatures, of which 982 were \nfound to be valid, 32 signatures short of ballot access.1 \n30.  Plaintiff Gottlieb would have had enough signatures to run for governor of Ohio, \nmember of Congress from Pennsylvania, or U.S. Senator from Oregon, but Plaintiff Gottlieb \nwere denied ballot access in the party primary. As a result, the candidate endorsed at convention \nran unopposed, and Plaintiffs Gottlieb and Chand were denied the opportunity to vote for the \ncandidate of their choice, a candidate with significant support. \n31.  Defendant Lamont’s executive order, described above, supra, paragraphs 2-13, \nfails to eliminate the undue burden of Connecticut’s Ballot Access Laws. Thus, Plaintiffs seek \nto modify Defendant Lamont’s Executive Order No. 7LL, which will otherwise deny candidates \nwith significant support access to the primary ballot and deny voters the right to vote for the \ncandidate of their choice. Time is short. In the upcoming election, currently, petitions will be \nmade available by the Secretary of the State on May 26, and must be turned in to the Secretary \nof the State’s office by June 11 at 4:00p.m. under Defendant Lamont’s order. \n32.  The Ballot Access Laws, as modified by Defendant Lamont’s executive order, \ndo not burden all political groups equally.  \n33.  Because incumbents have a well-developed network of campaign contributors, \nsupporters well-versed in the process, the loyalty of party bosses, and the advantages of their \nofficial office, they almost always garner more than 15% of the delegates at state conventions, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Plaintiffs were 32 signatures short, according to the count of the registrars of voters in the \nmunicipalities of the district in which they were seeking office, Connecticut’s Twelfth Senate \nDistrict, comprising the towns of Madison, Guilford, Killingworth, Durham, Branford, and \nNorth Branford. However, upon information and belief, employees of Defendant Merrill sought \nto disqualify additional signatures, because the back of some of the pages of the petitions were \nallegedly incorrectly filled out by one of Plaintiffs’ petition circulators. \n \n8 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 8   Filed 05/12/20   Page 9 of 18\nrarely need to gather signatures at all, and need not worry about Defendant Lamont’s \ncumbersome new mechanism for ballot access.  \n34.  On the other hand, new candidates who are either challenging incumbents or \nrunning for a vacant seat – and who already face an uphill battle in getting on the ballot – will \nneed to collect hundreds of signatures in order to qualify for ballot access, amid a pandemic, \nusing a cumbersome new method and only two days of extra time. \n35.  Because incumbents, in particular, are advantaged by the Ballot Access Laws as \nmodified by Defendant Lamont’s order, voters’ right to vote for the candidate of their choice is \nseverely restricted. When incumbents are more difficult to challenge, more run unopposed. \nUnopposed elections are very common in Connecticut, much more common than in places with \nless restrictive Ballot Access Laws. \n36.  Because Defendant Lamont’s executive order was intentionally tailored to \nprevent candidates with significant support from accessing the ballot, it constitutes an \nintentional violation of Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights. \nb)  Absentee Ballot Laws \n37.  Connecticut voters are allowed to vote by mail-in absentee ballot only under six \nspecific circumstances outlined in Connecticut statute: (1) active military service; (2) absence \nfrom one’s town of residence “during all of the hours of voting,” which in Connecticut is \n6:00a.m. to 8:00p.m.; (3) his or her illness; (4) his or her physical disability; (5) religious \nreasons; or (6) service as a poll worker other than in one’s town. Conn. Gen. Stat. Sec. 9-135.  \n38.  Neither Plaintiff is eligible for absentee voting under the statute.  \n39.  False statement on an application for an absentee ballot is a class D felony under \nConnecticut law. Conn. Gen. Stat. Sec. 9-359a.   \n \n9 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 8   Filed 05/12/20   Page 10 of 18\nc)  COVID-19  \n40.   “Social distancing” measures will likely remain in effect in some form at the \ntime of the May 26—June 9, 2020 petition gathering period, at the time of the August 11, 2020 \nprimary, and at the time of the November 3, 2020 general election. Even if federal, state, and \nlocal “social distancing” protocols are lifted, public health officials warn that in all likelihood \nsuch protocols could be re-imposed during another wave of COVID-19. \n41.   Public health researchers have concluded that there will be significant barriers to \nwide-scale in-person voting even in August and November 2020. \n42.  Defendant Lamont has postponed Connecticut’s presidential primary from April \n28, 2020 to August 11, 2020, an admission of the severe burden that COVID-19 imposes on \nvoters and the impossibility of maintaining a free and fair election without the ability to vote by \nmail, which most voters, like the Plaintiffs, cannot do because of the Absentee Ballot Laws. \n43.   Defendant Merrill has announced that she will mail an absentee ballot \napplication to every voter in advance of the August 11, 2020 primary election.  \n44.  Additionally, Defendant Merrill has requested that Defendant Lamont use his \nemergency powers to modify the Absentee Ballot Laws, but as of the time of this filing, he has \nfailed to do so. Defendant Merrill has also made repeated requests regarding the Ballot Access \nLaws, but Defendant Lamont’s action is inadequate, as summarized above. \n45.  As Defendant Merrill has admitted, “[w]e are on the precipice of disaster” \nregarding the conduct of the upcoming elections. Plaintiffs bring this action to guarantee the \nright to vote for themselves and their fellow citizens amid the chaos and uncertainty of the \npandemic.  \n \n10 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 8   Filed 05/12/20   Page 11 of 18\n46.  Circulating petitions for signature is not listed as an “essential business” under \nany of Defendant Lamont’s emergency public health orders. The health crisis coupled with the \nDefendant’s inadequate executive order make it impossible to gather enough signatures in \nenough time for candidates with significant support to access the ballot unless they attain the \nsupport of 15% of party delegates at a convention. This will, unless remedied, severely restrict \nthe ability of Plaintiffs and other voters to vote for the candidate of their choice. \nd)   Special Grounds for Injunctive Relief \n47.  This Court concluded, almost twenty years ago, that the 15% convention \ndelegate requirement, standing alone, likely fails to protect rights of free association of voters \nseeking to vote for the candidate of their choice. Campbell v. Bysiewicz, 213 F. Supp. 2d 152 \n(D.Conn. 2002) (Dorsey, J.). The remedy in that case came when the General Assembly created \nthe ability to gather petition signatures. See Public Act 03-241 (creating petitioning system). But \nthe health crisis and Defendant Lamont’s inadequate executive order render that remedy \nmeaningless without further relief.  \n48.  Without action, nearly every voter in Connecticut will face a legally significant \nincreased burden on their voting rights and their associational rights amid the COVID-19 \npandemic. Defendants’ failure to take adequate action will force voters to choose from a more \nrestricted set of candidates. Defendants’ continued inaction with regard to absentee ballots will \nforce voters to choose risking infection or being disenfranchised. \n49.  This case must proceed quickly before the Purcell deadline established by the \nSupreme Court. Each day that passes increases the risk of voter confusion in the August 11 and \nNovember 3 elections. Plaintiffs, from their past experiences in the political process, understand \nclose calls and the need for urgent action. A real and actual controversy exists between the \n \n11 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 8   Filed 05/12/20   Page 12 of 18\nparties, Plaintiffs have no actual remedy at law other than this action, and Plaintiffs will suffer \nirreparable harm until they obtain relief from this Court.  \nD.  Class Allegations \n  50.  Plaintiffs bring this case on their own behalf and on behalf of a class of all \nConnecticut voters, including a subclass of voters ineligible to receive absentee ballots under \nthe Absentee Ballot Laws. \n  51.  The class consists of over a million people and is so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable. \n  52.  Plaintiffs’ claims are common to and typical of the class and subclass, that is, the \nright of all members of the class to vote for candidates of their choice is burdened by \nConnecticut’s Ballot Access Laws as modified by Defendant Lamont’s executive order, and the \nright to vote of all members of the subclass is burdened by Connecticut’s Absentee Ballot Laws. \n  53.  Plaintiffs and their counsel will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nclass and subclass. No conflicts of interest exist between Plaintiffs or their counsel and the class \nor subclass. Plaintiffs’ counsel, Attorney Alexander T. Taubes, Esq., has done substantial work \nin identifying and investigating potential claims in this action; has experience in handling class \nactions, Noble v. Northland, UWY-CV16-6033559-S (Conn. Super. Ct.) (class counsel through \ninvestigation, discovery, motion practice, class certification, and settlement of class action on \nbehalf of approximately 1,000 former residents of a New Haven public housing complex), other \ncomplex litigation, Nat'l Ass’n for Advancement of Colored People v. Merrill, 939 F.3d 470, \n473 (2d Cir. 2019) (argued and briefed Defendants’ unsuccessful interlocutory appeal on \njusticiability grounds in novel reapportionment claim), and the types of claims asserted in the \naction, Pereira v. State Elections Enforcement Comm’n, HHB-CV19-6054160-S (Conn. Super. \n \n12 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 8   Filed 05/12/20   Page 13 of 18\nCt.) (declaratory judgment action regarding Connecticut campaign finance law); has knowledge \nof the applicable law; and resources that he will commit to representing the class and subclass. \n  54.  Defendant Lamont and Defendant Merrill have acted or refused to act on \ngrounds that apply generally to the class and subclass, so that final injunctive relief or \ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class and subclass as a whole.  \nE.   Claims for Relief \nFirst Claim: Unconstitutional Abridgment of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nConstitution of the United States by Defendants Lamont and Merrill, pursuant to  \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Campbell v. Bysiewicz, for Enforcement of the Ballot Access Laws as \nModified by Defendant Lamont’s Executive Order 7LL \n  55.  The allegations above are incorporated as if included fully here.  \n56.  Even without the circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic, \nConnecticut’s ballot access laws unduly burden and violate Plaintiffs’ right to petition, speech, \nand free association protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of \nthe United States, including by having a “chilling effect” on the ability of individuals such as \nPlaintiff Gottlieb to run for office in the first place.   \n57.  Defendant Lamont’s Executive Order No. 7LL, while containing admissions of \nthe severe burden on petition signature gathering imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, \ncontinues to unduly burden and violate Plaintiffs’ right to petition, speech, and free association \nprotected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, as \napplied. The requirements of the Defendant’s executive order are not only difficult to achieve \non their face, but unsafe and impossible amid the pandemic. If undisturbed, enforcement of \nDefendant Lamont’s executive order will unduly and unjustifiably restrict Plaintiffs’ First and \nFourteenth Amendment rights. \n \n13 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 8   Filed 05/12/20   Page 14 of 18\n58.  Defendant Lamont’s executive order triggers strict scrutiny because of the \nburden they impose on Plaintiffs’ associational rights, scrutiny that the order cannot survive. \nBut under the circumstances of this case, including federal, state, and local shelter-in-place \norders amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the executive order fails even rational basis review.   \nSecond Claim: Unconstitutional Abridgment of the First and Fourteenth Amendment to \nthe Constitution of the United States by Defendants Lamont and Merrill, pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983, for Enforcement of the Absentee Ballot Laws \n  59.  The allegations above are incorporated as if included fully here.  \n60.  Voting and participating in the electoral process is a form of expression which is \nthe ultimate form of political speech. In light of the Supreme Court’s cases giving strong First \nAmendment protection to campaign funds spent to influence voters, the voters and their votes \nthemselves can hardly be entitled to less protection.  \n61.  As a restriction on free speech and association, the Absentee Ballot Laws must \ntherefore be judged under the standard of strict scrutiny, a scrutiny that the Absentee Ballot \nLaws cannot survive under ordinary circumstances, much less under the extraordinary \ncircumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n  62.  Restricting access to absentee ballots only to the six identified categories in \nConnecticut law is not necessary or narrowly-tailored to any compelling state interest. In fact, a \ncompelling interest exists in reducing the in-person interactions required by mass in-person \nvoting. \nThird Claim: Violation of Procedural Due Process for Vagueness in Violation of the \nFourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States by Defendants Lamont \nand Merrill, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for Enforcement of the Absentee Ballot Laws \n  63.  The allegations above are incorporated as if included fully here.  \n  64.  Should Defendant Lamont fail to act to expand absentee ballot eligibility, \nthousands of voters will be mailed absentee ballot applications by Defendant Merrill, which \n \n14 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 8   Filed 05/12/20   Page 15 of 18\nthey will be ineligible to complete. Completing the applications falsely could subject the voters \nto criminal prosecution.  \n  65.  A restriction to the right to vote due to the vagueness of a statutory provision \ncreates conditions on the right to vote that violates voters’ Due Process rights. \n66.  The Absentee Ballot Laws violate Plaintiffs and other voters’ Due Process rights \nbecause the law, under the circumstances, fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence with a \nreasonable opportunity to understand whether or not they are permitted to vote by mail during \nthe COVID-19 pandemic. \n67.  The Absentee Ballot Laws also violate Plaintiffs and other voters’ Due Process \nrights because the confusion that results amid the pandemic may encourage arbitrary and \ndiscriminatory enforcement, bar access to the right to vote, and increase the risk of criminal \nprosecution.  \nFourth Claim: Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates by Defendants Lamont and Merrill, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for Enforcement \nof the Absentee Ballot Laws \n  68.  The allegations above are incorporated as if included fully here.  \n69.  The Absentee Ballot Laws violate the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection \nClause because the state allows some voters to access absentee ballots but not others, treating \nsimilarly situated voters differently. Because of the pandemic, Plaintiffs are similarly situated to \nvoters who are eligible for absentee ballots, but Plaintiffs are denied eligibility to vote absentee \nby Connecticut’s Absentee Ballot Laws.  \n70.   No rational interest exists in putting citizens’ health at risk in voting, rendering \nthe state’s activities in enforcing the Absentee Ballot Laws unconstitutional.  \n \n \n15 \n\t\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 8   Filed 05/12/20   Page 16 of 18\nF.

The DSCC has intervened in this case to protect its First \nAmendment right of association as a political party and oppose the plaintiffs’ Motion for \nPreliminary or Permanent Injunction.  The plaintiffs’ amended complaint alleges that Executive \nOrder 7LL issued by Governor Ned Lamont on May 11, 2020 violates their First Amendment \nrights with regard to access to the primary ballot.  The amended complaint, in fact, also \nchallenges the DSCC’s primary ballot access process.  The DSCC’s primary ballot access \nprocess is an essential part of the Connecticut Democratic Party’s core purpose: to select \ncandidates to represent its interests in government. \n  The DSCC operates in accordance with the Connecticut General Statutes and its State Party \nRules (attached hereto as Exhibit A).  The State Party Rules are filed with the Secretary of the \nState and are available online. Declaration of Jacqueline Kozin, Executive Director of the DSCC, \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 29   Filed 06/02/20   Page 2 of 43\n¶13 (attached hereto as Exhibit B).  The State Party Rules may be approved and amended only \nby a majority vote of the delegates at the biannual State Convention. Kozin, Decl. ¶12.   \nThe Connecticut Democratic Party is a democratically run organization with elections \nheld every two years where its members elect representatives to the town committees for each of \nthe 169 towns, 72 representatives to the State Central Committee, and hundreds of \nrepresentatives to federal and state conventions.  Throughout the Connecticut Democratic Party, \nthe leaders volunteer their time to help the party pursue its objectives and support its policies. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption to many facets of society and Governor \nLamont recognized that this includes gathering signatures to access election ballots.  It is our \nposition that the modifications included in Executive Order 7LL properly compensate for the \nadditional burden that the pandemic places on candidates gathering signatures for the August \nprimary. \nThe primary in August is not an election to determine who represents the voters of \nConnecticut.  It is an election to determine who represents Connecticut Democrats in the \nNovember election to determine who represents the voters of Connecticut.  As discussed below, \nthe government has a role in regulating and overseeing primaries but that role has limits.  \nLowering the requirements to access the primary ballot could undermine the work that the \nparty’s members do as part of the candidate-selection process.  If the requirements are too low, \nthen candidates could choose to skip the arduous work of working on town committees, dropping \nliterature, making telephone calls, stuffing envelopes, reaching out to town committee members \nor delegates to ask for support for their candidacies or their candidates.  If that becomes the case, \none has to wonder why people would volunteer their time and put the effort into working on \nbehalf of the party.  This is how the ballot-access requirements are linked inextricably to the \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 29   Filed 06/02/20   Page 3 of 43\nviability of the party.  \nFor that reason, we carefully analyze and consider proposed changes to ballot-access \nrequirements.  In this instance, we recognize that the pandemic will alter or otherwise impact the \npetitioning process.  We submit that modifications in Executive Order 7LL fairly compensate for \nthe current conditions.  We strenuously oppose any further lowering of the ballot-access \nrequirements and oppose plaintiff’s Motion for a Preliminary and Permanent Injunction.1   \nI.  ARGUMENT \na.  A Political Party Has a First Amendment Right to a Candidate-Selection \nProcess and That Process Is Its Core Function \n \n“[A] political party has a First Amendment right to limit its membership as it wishes, and \nto choose a candidate-selection process that will in its view produce the nominee who best \nrepresents its political platform.”  New York State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U.S. 196, \n202 (2008).  The idea behind a political party is that a group of similarly minded people join \ntogether to support and elect candidates to represent their interests on the local, state, and federal \nlevels of government.  The party structure is the means by which the members become a \ncohesive group able to achieve this purpose.   \nThe party structure has to ensure, above all else, that it creates and maintains a process to \nselect the candidates that the membership supports.  The candidate-selection process is why a \nparty exists and it determines whether the party continues to exist.  Therefore, a political party \nhas a right to choose a candidate-selection process that will in its view produce the nominee who \nbest represents its political platform. Democratic Party of United States v. Wisconsin ex rel. La \nFollette, 450 U.S. 107, 122 (1981); California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 574-\n \n1 The DSCC will defer to Defendants Lamont and Merrill’s argument on discussing the appropriate standard for \ninjunctive relief rather than repeat them in this memorandum. \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 29   Filed 06/02/20   Page 4 of 43\n575 (2000).  The candidates are essential to express the views of the members, to enact the \npolicies that the members support and to oppose the policies its members oppose.  Necessarily \nthe process by which the party selects its candidates is of paramount importance. \nb.  The Connecticut Democratic Party Operates Within a Structure and With an \nEngaged Membership and in accordance with Democratic Principles \n \nA political party starts with individuals who want to work together to promote their \nposition on public matters and issues.  The party grows as others choose to join it.  Today if a \nperson eligible to vote wants to join the Democratic Party in Connecticut, that person simply \nchecks a box on the voter registration card filed with the municipality’s Registrar of Voters.  \nThere is no barrier to entry: no ideology test, no fee, no obligation to attend meetings, work on \ncampaigns or to contribute money.  Each individual decides his or her level of involvement. \nFor an established party, such as the Connecticut Democratic Party, the challenge is to \nremain vibrant, unified, and relevant.  As more members join, the debate to find consensus \nbecomes more complex and more important.  Tension among factions within the party over \nissues, policies and personalities are inevitable and the only antidote is for the party to adhere to \na fair and democratic process.  The smoke-filled room of party bosses from the 1900’s could not \nsurvive in today’s world.  Instead, the Connecticut Democratic Party has to rely on its \ndemocratic process that allows individuals and groups a fair chance to participate, campaign and \nmake the case for their positions and candidates.  These individuals or their candidates may not \nprevail but there is a process that gives them a fair opportunity to do so.   \nIt is important to understand what a Connecticut political party actually is in 2020 as \nopposed to the outdated image of party-bosses sitting back in smoke-filled rooms doling out \npatronage positions and, through that, asserting their influence.   The foundation of the \nConnecticut Democratic Party today is the town committee.  Each of the 169 towns in this state \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 29   Filed 06/02/20   Page 5 of 43\nhas one.  Every two years, the Democrats in each town meet to elect people to serve on the town \ncommittee.  It is known as a caucus. Kozin, Decl. ¶4.  The outgoing town committee leadership \nis required to publish a public notice detailing the date and time of the caucus.  The sole \neligibility to participate in the caucus or for election to serve on the town committee is that you \nare a registered voter and member of the party.  That is it.   \nThe town committees of the Connecticut Democratic Party have several fundamental \nresponsibilities.  These include the following: \n•  meeting to discuss issues of importance; \n•  determining the committee’s position on those issues; \n•  finding candidates who will support its position on those important issues; and \n•  helping those candidates get elected to office. \nThe town committee’s ultimate objective is the nomination of a candidate for each general \nelection.  In the pursuit of that objective, the party’s core role is the endorsement process.   \nc.  The Connecticut Democratic Party Endorsement Process \nPer Title 9 of the Connecticut General Statutes and the State Party Rules, Connecticut \nDemocrats may endorse their candidates for office in one of the following three ways: \n1.  Town Committee; \n2.  Caucus; or \n3.  Convention  \nConn. Gen. Stat. §9-309a; Democratic State Party Rules Article III.  The first two methods are \nused for local offices and state legislative districts that comprise only one municipality.2  For a \ntown committee endorsement, the members of the town committee that reside in the district may \n \n2 Conn. Gen. Stat. §9-372(7) defines such offices as “municipal offices” which can cause some confusion. \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 29   Filed 06/02/20   Page 6 of 43\nvote to endorse.3 Democratic State Party Rules, Article VII.  For a caucus endorsement, all \nDemocrats residing in the district, which tend to be smaller municipalities, may vote to endorse.  \nFor both town committee and caucus endorsements, the winning candidate must receive a \nmajority of those present and voting.   \nThe third method of endorsement is a convention.  Delegates elected either by their town \ncommittees or caucuses may vote to endorse at conventions. Democratic State Party Rules, \nArticle III, Section 6.c.; Kozin, Decl. ¶5.  The election of delegates by a town committee is \ndetermined by a vote of each town committee member who resides in the district that the \ncandidate would represent.  Each delegate to the respective conventions also must reside in the \ndistrict that the candidate would represent. Democratic State Party Rules, Article III, Section 8.  \nA delegate must receive a majority of those town committee members present and voting. \nDemocratic State Party Rules, Article III, Section 14.c.  The town committee publishes a list of \nthe delegates to all of the convention. Democratic State Party Rules, Article III, Section 14.b. \n  The convention endorsement process is fair and accessible. Kozin, Decl. ¶9.  Candidates \nseeking the endorsement will typically network with the delegates before the conventions, \nworking to gain the delegates’ support. Kozin, Decl. ¶9.  Any candidate may attempt to win the \nendorsement and the first step is to simply be nominated and seconded at a convention. Kozin, \nDecl. ¶9.  A candidate wins the endorsement upon gaining a majority vote of all delegates \npresent and voting. Kozin, Decl. ¶7. \n \n3\nIn some towns, there is competition to serve on a town committee and in others there are vacancies that will go \nunfilled for the two-year term.  Some town committees are highly active, others are not.  In smaller towns, the town \ncommittee often will be the sole entity raising and spending money to support the election of its municipal \ncandidates in odd number years.  In some towns, the town committee members put substantial hours volunteering \nfor the candidates in their towns.  In other, the town committee members do not participate much in the campaigns.  \nIn short, the engagement of town committees differs from town to town. \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 29   Filed 06/02/20   Page 7 of 43\nIn even-numbered years when the state legislature is up for election, the endorsement \nprocess begins in March when the town committees meet for the start of their two-year term.  \nTown committee meetings to endorse candidates, caucus meetings to endorse candidates and \nconventions to endorse candidates are held over a period of time in May of the election year as \nset forth in statute.  See Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 9-382, 9-383.   \nAfter organizing themselves by electing officers, the town committees’ next order of \nbusiness is to elect delegates to the conventions.  The election of delegates takes place several \nweeks before the conventions.  The town committees publish the names of all delegates.  This \nallows candidates and other advocates the opportunity and the time to ask the delegates for their \nsupport in advance of the convention. \n  The DSCC values its First Amendment rights of free speech and association. Jacqueline \nKozin, DSCC Executive Director, Decl. ¶16.  The nominating convention process is the means \nby which the Democratic Party shows support for its candidates.  It reflects the will of the people \nthat comprise the Democratic Party’s membership. Kozin, Decl. ¶16.  The party exercises its free \nspeech in the endorsement process itself, and upon the nomination of a specific candidate for a \nparticular office, it also exercises its freedom of association by determining which candidates to \nrepresent the party and promote the Democratic Party’s platform. Kozin, Decl. ¶16.  \nThere are certain similarities and also notable differences between the town committee or \ncaucus primary ballot access processes and the convention primary ballot access process.  One \nsimilarity is that all three require that a candidate receive a nomination and a second in order to \nparticipate in the endorsement vote.  Another similarity is that all three require a majority vote of \nthose present and voting to obtain the endorsement.  \nA notable difference between the three is that there are two ways to get on a primary \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 29   Filed 06/02/20   Page 8 of 43\nballot under the town committee or caucus endorsement process. Democratic State Party Rules, \nArticle III, Section 13.  The first is to win the endorsement by receiving a majority of those \npresent and voting.  The second is to collect the statutorily required number of signatures on \npetitions.  Democratic State Party Rules, Article III, Section 13.  The convention endorsement \nprocess adds an additional mechanism.  At a convention, a candidate “that receives 15% on any \nannounced, final or accepted roll call vote shall be eligible to primary.”  Democratic State Party \nRules, Article III, Section 13.4 \nPer the State Party Rules and the Connecticut General Statutes, a candidate who fails win \na convention or to receive at least 15% of the delegates present and voting may still gain access \nto the primary ballot by collecting the required number of signatures from enrolled party \nmembers. Democratic State Party Rules, Article III, Section 13; Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-400.  The \npercentage of signatures differs depending on the office the candidate is seeking.5 6  The first day \nthat candidates may seek petition forms coincides with the final day for nominating conventions.  \nConn. Gen. Stat. § 9-404a.  Candidates have fourteen days to secure signatures and file their \npetitions with the registrars of voters of the towns in which the petition pages were circulated.  \nConn. Gen. Stat. § 9-400.  The registrars of voters must then certify the signatures on each \npetition page against the enrolled party members and file the certification with the Secretary of \n \n4 In N.Y. State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U.S. 196 (2008) the Court unanimously held that “[s]election \nby convention has never been thought unconstitutional, even when the delegates were not selected by primary but by \nparty caucuses . . . . Selection by convention has been a traditional means of choosing party nominees.  While a \nState may determine it is not desirable and replace it, it is not unconstitutional.”  Id. at 202.   In 2003, Connecticut \namended its election laws to permit the petitioning process for primary and general ballots after a ruling by the \ndistrict court concluded that the state’s primary ballot access system was unconstitutional.  Campbell v. Bysiewicz, \n213 F. Supp.2d 152 (Conn. 2002). \n \n5 For United States Congress, the petition signature requirement is 2% of enrolled party members in the district.  For \nthe remaining offices on the 2020 ballot, other than United States President, the petition signature requirement is 5% \nof the enrolled party members in the district or town.  Conn. Gen. Stat. §9-400.  For municipal offices there is more \nflexibility: the signature requirement is 5% or “such lesser number of electors as such party by its rules prescribes.”  \nConn. Gen. Stat. § 9-406. \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 29   Filed 06/02/20   Page 9 of 43\nthe State.  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-404c. \nThe ballot access provisions as modified by Executive Order 7LL in light of the COVID-\n19 pandemic are reasonable. Kozin, Decl. ¶15.  A state may demand a minimum degree of \nsupport for candidate access to a ballot, see Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U.S. 431, 442 (1971).  The \nquestion ultimately before the court is what level of support ought to be required to allow a \ncandidate access to a primary ballot.  This necessarily also means protecting the political party’s \nrole in the candidate-selection process which the First Amendment grants it.  The plaintiffs’ \ndemand that the First Amendment be used to impose additional competition in the parties' \nnominee-selection process relies on an implausible reading of the First Amendment that should \nbe rejected. \nII. The State Has a Role to Monitor Intraparty Competition to Ensure Fairness but the \nRole Is Subject to Limits Set by the Constitution \n \nA political party’s First Amendment freedom to gather in association for the purpose of \nadvancing shared beliefs is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment from infringement by any \nState. Wisconsin ex rel. La Follette, 450 U.S. at 122, citing Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U.S. 51, \n57; Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23, 30-31. See also NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 \nU.S. 449, 460.  This freedom to associate necessarily includes the right to identify the people \nwho constitute the association, and to limit the association to those people only.  Interference \nwith a political party means interference with the will of its members.  Sweezy v. New \nHampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 250 (1957); Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., \n489 U.S. 214 (1989). \nWhile it is well settled that states “have a major role to play in structuring and monitoring \nthe election process, including primaries” to assure the intraparty process adheres to democratic \nprinciples (California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 572, citing Burdick v. Takushi, \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 29   Filed 06/02/20   Page 10 of 43\n504 U.S. 428 (1992); Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479 U.S. 208, 217 (1986); \nAmerican Party of Tex. v. White, 415 U.S. 767 (1974)), “the processes by which political parties \nselect their nominees are not wholly public affairs that states may regulate freely.  Id. at 572-573.  \nThe government’s “power to prescribe party use of primaries or conventions to select nominees \nfor the general election is not without limits.” N.Y. State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 \nU.S. 196 (2008); California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 577.  Put simply, when a \nstate regulates parties' internal processes, they must act within limits imposed by the \nConstitution. See, e. g., Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U.S. 214 \n(1989); Democratic Party of United States v. Wisconsin ex rel. La Follette, 450 U.S. 107 (1981).  \nWhen a state regulates the manner in which a political party selects its candidates, it is “the \nparty’s associational rights [that] are at issue . . . .”  N.Y. State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, \n552 U.S. at 203.    \nThe Connecticut Democratic Party’s constitutional right to association is inextricably \nlinked to the petitioning process for primary ballot access.  Lowering the requirements for \nprimary ballot access too much undermines the party because it lessens the importance of acting \nwithin the party structure.  There is a reason candidates, activists and others dedicate the time \nand make the effort to participate within the party.  This includes attending town committee \nmeetings, making endless phone calls, serving in leadership, working at conventions, raising \nmoney, going door to door to hand out campaign literature, and numerous other activities that are \nnecessary for a political party function.   \nThese efforts are also examples of the necessary steps one should take in order to build \nsupport within a party to become a town committee member, a delegate, a chair or a candidate.7  \n \n7 In contrast to this approach, the lead plaintiff in this case, Andy Gottlieb, in 2018 returned to his hometown at age \n24, joined the Guilford Democratic Town Committee and announced in late April that he would seek the party \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 29   Filed 06/02/20   Page 11 of 43\nIf some do not want to contribute to the party structure, it may make more sense for them to run \noutside the Democratic Party.  One may want to have its cake and eat it too but there is no \nconstitutional right to it. \nIn order to maintain its legitimacy, the Democratic Party must actively discourage party \nsplintering, minimize voter confusion at the ballot box, maintain the integrity of the petition \nprocess, and discourage cross party raiding and manipulation. See Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, \n730 (1974).   \nIII.  Executive Order 7LL Modifies the Petitioning Process for Primary Ballot Access \nin Light of the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Manner That Is Fair \n \nGovernor Lamont issued Executive Order 7LL on May 11th, modifying the petitioning \nprocess for primary ballot access in three substantive ways.  Executive Order 7LL is a recognition \nand response to the fact that social distancing measures implemented to respond to the pandemic \nwill make collecting signatures more difficult for certain candidates.  This Order also acknowledges \nthat “the process of qualifying for ballot access through in-person petitioning as required under \nTitle 9 of the General Statutes is a basic and vital requirement of our state constitution and our \nelection laws, the purpose of which is to ensure that voters have the opportunity to choose among \nviable candidates who have qualified for the ballot based on a minimum threshold of support, \nand to promote an election that is orderly, fair and transparent.”   \nBelow are the three modifications to the petitioning process contained within Executive \nOrder 7LL: \n1.  Extends the deadline for candidates to submit the required signatures by two days, until \nJune 11, 2020; \n \n2.  Reduces by 30% the number of signatures a petitioning candidate must collect to obtain \nballot access; and \n \nendorsement for State Senate.  He received one vote at the 2018 12th State Senate Convention.  See April 20, 2018 \nPress Release from Andy Gottlieb (attached hereto as Exhibit C). \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 29   Filed 06/02/20   Page 12 of 43\n \n3.  Makes it easier for candidates to obtain those signatures by allowing the option of \nelectronic signature, allows the signature to be sent directly to the candidate (who may \ncompile the signatures and then send them to the Registrar of Voters)8, and eliminates \nthe need for a circulator.9 \n \nThe modification to permit electronic signatures is especially significant because it eliminates the \ntime and effort necessary to walk streets and climb stairs to knock on doors to solicit signatures – all \nwithin the limited time period available to candidates and campaigns (typically daylight hours and \nlater in the day when people are home from work).  Per Executive Order 7LL, candidates and \ncampaigns may solicit signatures by email, social media, digital advertising, etc.  Done \nelectronically, this may be done at any time of the day, not just during a limited window. \n  In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, Executive Order 7LL attempts to balance the \ninterests and obligations of the state regarding ballot access with the varied rights of the political \nactors.  The DSCC does not object to Executive Order 7LL because we do not believe that it will \nunnecessarily reduce the requirements to access the primary ballot.  We would also argue that the \nplaintiffs lack a compelling argument that the Order leaves them with a higher burden to access \nthe primary ballot.  \nConclusion \n  Diminishing the meaning of the party’s endorsement undermines the reason that some \npeople dedicate so much time and effort volunteering for the party.  You cannot separate \ndiminishing the meaning of the party’s endorsement from diminishing the member’s First \n \n8\nExecutive Order 7LL provides that “a petitioning signature shall be accepted as valid” if it: (1) is mailed to the \ncandidate and then to the Registrar of Voters by the applicable deadline; or (2) it is “scanned or photographed \nelectronically, and returned to the candidate by electronic mail and later to the Registrar of Voters by the applicable \ndeadline along with a copy of the email demonstrating the electronic transmission of the petition by the registered \nvoter.”   \n \n9Conn. Gen. §§ 9-400 and 9-410 require that petitions must be circulated, and that signatures must be collected, \nsubmitted, and attested to, by an eligible circulator.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 29   Filed 06/02/20   Page 13 of 43\nAmendment rights.   \nThe plaintiffs seek a level of influence in the Democratic Party through this lawsuit because \nthey either could not or do not believe they otherwise could attain such influence.  The First \nAmendment does not give party members lacking a base of support within the party itself the right \nto compel the state to do their bidding and encroach further upon the party’s rights so as to provide \nthem with a more hospitable political environment.  In NY Board of Elections v. Lopes Torres, the \nSupreme Court held that “we have, as described above, permitted States to set their faces against \n\"party  bosses\"  by  requiring  party-candidate  selection  through  processes  more  favorable  to \ninsurgents, such as primaries. But to say that the State can require this is a far cry from saying that \nthe Constitution demands it.  New York State Bd. of Elections v.

The time and place for all public meetings of the Democratic Party in Connecticut on \nall levels should be publicized fully and in such a manner as to assure timely notice to all \ninterested persons.  Such meetings must be held in places accessible to all Party members \nand large enough to accommodate all interested persons.   \n  \n4.

The Democratic Party in Connecticut should publicize fully and in such manner as to \nassure notice to all interested parties a full description of the legal and practical procedures \nfor selection of Democratic Party officers and representatives on all levels.  Publication of \nthese procedures should be done in such fashion that all prospective and current members of \nthis State Democratic Party will be fully and adequately informed of the pertinent procedures \nin time to participate in each selection procedure at all levels of the Democratic Party \norganization.  \n  \n6.

State Central Committee Members must reside in the district \nfrom which they were elected for their entire term.  If the State Central Committee Member \nmoves from the district from which he or she was elected during the elected term, his or her \nseat will be declared vacant by the State Chair and shall be filled under Article I, Section 4.   \nB. In addition to the above paragraph, the State Chair, in consultation with the Connecticut \nYoung Democrats, shall nominate two representatives, one man and one woman, for election \nto the State Central Committee.  Additional nominations of Young Democrats may be made \nfrom the floor at the State Central meeting and the two representatives shall then be chosen \nby a majority of the members present and voting.  Members chosen under this paragraph, \nshall be elected after the State Central Committee meeting to elect the State Chair and shall \nserve for a term to expire with the term of the State Chair.  Members must be residents of the \nState of Connecticut.

The remaining representative on the State Central Committee from said \nsenatorial district shall set a time and place for said meeting and written notice of said \nmeeting shall be sent to each state convention delegate, in good standing, from said \nsenatorial district and the vacancy shall be filled by a majority vote of those present and \nvoting at said meeting.  \n  \nIn order to be eligible to be a participant in the special meeting, the State Convention \ndelegates must be in good standing, which is defined as being a valid Democratic elector, \nresiding in the district at the time the special meeting occurs.  A delegate in good standing \nmay appoint an alternate for such special meeting, subject to the provisions of Article I, \nSection 9. If a delegate is not in good standing, his or her alternate to the prior State \nConvention, if in good standing and if appointed prior to the adjournment of the State \nConvention, shall participate in his or her place.

The chair of the town committee may cast a vote on such endorsement to break a tie, but \nthis provision shall not affect his or her right to cast any vote, as a member of the town \ncommittee, to which he or she is otherwise entitled.

By a convention of delegates chosen by the enrolled Democratic electors of the \nmunicipality in a manner prescribed in the local party rules of each municipality.  \n  \n 3.   By the Democratic town committee at a meeting called in the same manner as a town \ncommittee meeting for selecting party endorsed candidates as provided in Section 12 of Article \nVIII of these rules, or as provided in local party rules.  \n  \nIn any municipality in which the town committee has not so adopted and filed such rules or \namendments, the chair of the town committee in any municipality consisting of one voting \ndistrict, or in the event of his or her failure to act, the Vice Chair, shall call a caucus within \ntwenty (20) days upon filing with the Registrar of Voters of such party in such municipality a \npetition signed by at least five percent (5%), but no more than five hundred (500), of its enrolled \nparty members, to take action on such petition.  \n  \nIn all other municipalities, the chair of the town committee, or, in the event of his or her failure \nto act, the Vice Chair, shall call a convention within twenty (20) days upon the filing with the \nRegistrar of Voters of such party in such municipality of a petition signed by at least five percent \n(5%), or at least five hundred (500) (whichever is less), of its enrolled party members, to take \naction on such petition.  \n  \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 29   Filed 06/02/20   Page 35 of 43\nSuch convention shall consist of three (3) delegates from each voting district elected at a caucus \nof the enrolled party members of that district.

The State Central Committee, at a \nmeeting duly called for such purpose, by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of its entire \nmembership, may make such amendments and only such amendments, as may be made \nnecessary by changes in the laws of the United States or the State of Connecticut or by the \nNational Democratic Party Rules. Any changes or amendments made by the State Central \nCommittee shall be in force only until the next succeeding State Convention, at which they must \nbe submitted for ratification or rejection.  \n  \nSection 2: \n \nNothing herein shall be construed to permit the State Central Committee to alter the basis of \nrepresentation at conventions as provided in Section 3 of Article III of these rules unless such \nalteration be required by change in the laws of the United States or of the State of Connecticut or \nby the National Democratic Party Rules.  \n  \nARTICLE XIII ROBERT'S RULES GOVERNING  \n  \nRobert's Rules of Order (newly revised) shall be construed as applicable, controlling and \nconclusive on parliamentary issues, except as herein otherwise provided.  \n  \nAmendments:  Amended July, 1986 Amended July, 1994 Amended July, 1996 Amended July, \n2000 Amended May, 2004 Amended May, 2008 Amended May, 2010 Amended May, 2012 \nAmended May, 2014 Amended May, 2016    \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 29   Filed 06/02/20   Page 36 of 43\nEXHIBIT B \n \n \nTHE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT \n \n \nANDY GOTTLIEB, et al.  :  CIVIL ACTION NO.  3:20-CV-00623(JCH) \n  : \n   Plaintiffs,  : \n  :    \n          v.  :   \n  : \nNED LAMONT, GOVERNOR OF THE  : \nSTATE OF CONNECTICUT, and  : \nDENISE MERRILL, SECRETARY OF  : \nTHE STATE OF CONNECTICUT  : \n   Defendants  :  JUNE 2, 2020 \n \n \n \nDECLARATION OF JACQUELINE KOZIN \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C.§ 1746, I, Jacqueline Kozin, hereby declare as follows: \n1.  I submit this Declaration in support of potential intervenor Defendant Connecticut \nDemocratic State Central Committee, Defendant Governor Ned Lamont, and Defendant \nSecretary of the State Denise Merrill.   I am the Executive Director of the Connecticut \nDemocratic State Central Committee, which is the Democratic Party of the State of Connecticut \n(hereinafter the “DSCC” or “Connecticut Democratic Party”), a position I have held since \napproximately January, 2019.  In that capacity, I am responsible for managing the day to day \noperations of the entire organization, including planning and organizing nominating conventions. \n2.  Nominating conventions are the process by which the Democratic Party in the \nState of Connecticut determines what candidate for any particular office becomes the party-\nendorsed candidate for the primary election.  Although such endorsement essentially deems the \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 29   Filed 06/02/20   Page 37 of 43\ncandidate the “party favorite” (in colloquial terms), a party-endorsed candidate can still certainly \nface a primary challenger (by virtue of a petitioning candidate who collects a sufficient number \nof signatures, or a candidate who merely garners 15% of the delegate votes at a convention).   \n3.  The State Central Committee is the governing body of the Connecticut \nDemocratic Party (akin to the DSCC’s board).   It is composed of seventy-two members total, \ndrawing two representatives, one man and one woman, from each state senate district.  The State \nCentral Committee sets the date, time, and location of the nominating conventions (which are at \nleast partially the subject matter of this lawsuit). \n4.  Democratic town committees are the Democratic Party apparatus of the \nmunicipalities.  Town committee members themselves are elected by a caucus open to all \nregistered Democrats in a Connecticut town.  Every municipality in Connecticut has a \nDemocratic town committee; therefore there are 169 Democratic town committees in \nConnecticut.    \n5.  Delegates to a convention come from the municipalities that are represented by \nthe office up for election (be it a state assembly district, state senate district, U.S. congressional \ndistrict, etc.).  These delegates are elected prior to the conventions either by a caucus  open to all \nregistered Democrats in a municipality or by a meeting of their Democratic town committees. \n6.  Nominating conventions are held within a window of time established by statute \nbefore the primary election in order to endorse candidates for each particular office, including \nstate representative, state senator, judge of probate, all five Connecticut constitutional officers \n(Governor, Lt. Governor, Secretary of the State, Treasurer and Attorney General), as well as for \nfederal offices including U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator.  The mechanics of a convention \nvary somewhat from one to the next, but all adhere to state party rules, follow Roberts Rules of \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 29   Filed 06/02/20   Page 38 of 43\nOrder, and the following protocol.  First, a convention is opened by a temporary chair and a \ntemporary secretary, and then a permanent chair and permanent secretary are nominated (never \nby one’s self, but by others), then voted on by all delegates present and voting to run the \nconvention.  A permanent chair and permanent secretary are then elected by a majority vote of \nall delegates present and voting.  The permanent chair then calls for nominations for the \nrespective elected office(s).  An individual cannot nominate one’s self; rather, one must be \nnominated by another.  Such nomination must then be seconded, by yet another, different \nindividual (that is, the initial nominator and seconder cannot be the same person).  Any registered \nDemocrat who is otherwise qualified to hold a particular office can seek the party nomination \nsimply by being nominated and seconded, including the Plaintiffs in this case. There can be and \noften are numerous candidates nominated for endorsement to a particular office.  Additionally, \nnominations may always be made spontaneously from the floor of the convention (as long as the  \nnominations period remains open).  Furthermore, before nominations are closed by the chair – \nwhich itself must done by a motion from the delegates and seconded - the chair of the convention \nliterally calls out – “are there any other nominations,” providing the final opportunity for \nanyone to throw their hat into the ring and ensuring no would-be candidates seeking the party \nendorsement are missed or otherwise overlooked.   \n7.  In order to be the “party-endorsed candidate” one must win a majority of votes \nfrom those delegates present and voting.  When there is a contentious convention with numerous \ncandidates vying for the party endorsement, and on the first round of voting, no candidate wins a \nmajority of  delegate votes (of those delegates present and voting), multiple rounds of voting will \noccur, where delegates vote numerous times for the various candidates before one candidate \nultimately wins a majority of votes present and voting.   \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 29   Filed 06/02/20   Page 39 of 43\n8.  Once the party-endorsed candidate  is elected, then the convention, by motion, \nsecond, and vote of the delegates, is closed.  The convention chair or secretary also completes a \ncertificate of endorsement, signifying that the candidate is the party-endorsed candidate, which is \nfiled with the Secretary of the State.  \n9.  The process of endorsing a candidate is fair and accessible.  People seeking \nendorsement for the elected office typically network with the convention delegates well before \nthe conventions, working collaboratively to obtain the delegates’ support and reaching out to the \ndelegates early and often.  Furthermore, any serious contenders can attempt to become the party-\nendorsed candidate simply by being nominated and seconded at a convention and use their own \npolitical capital and personal contacts to develop their base of support.  In any event, the most \nsuccessful convention candidates are typically those who have tirelessly planned and sought the \nwidespread support of their local Democratic electorate.   \n10.  The fact that a candidate only needs 15% of the delegate votes to automatically \nqualify for the primary ballot underscores the reasonableness of the nomination process.    \n11.  Even if a candidate does not win 15% of the delegate votes at a convention, they \nare not precluded from participating in the primary.  Under both state party rules and the state \nstatute – which not coincidentally mirrors the state party rules - one can employ the petitioning \nprocess by obtaining petition signatures from 5% of the registered Democrats in a district.  See \nConnecticut Democratic State Party Rules, Art. III, Section 13(2), found here: \nhttps://ctdems.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2018-DSCC-Party-Rules-2.pdf \n12.  The Democratic State Party Rules are democratically determined, with the rules \nthemselves and any subsequent amendments voted on by the delegates at the State Convention.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 29   Filed 06/02/20   Page 40 of 43\nIt takes a majority vote of the delegates present and voting in order to adopt the rules and any \namendment to the rules. \n13.  State Party rules are filed with The Secretary of the State and available online.   \nThe State gives much deference to the state party to determine its own pre-primary processes, \nincluding endorsements, which is an inherently political task best determined by the party \nstructure.  \n14.  In light of the Covid-19 global pandemic, Governor Lamont’s May 11, 2020 \nExecutive Order 7LL reduced the required number of signatures required of a candidate for \nnomination by a political party to a state, district, or municipal office by thirty percent (30%).  It \nalso allowed for signatures to be obtained via electronic mail and eased the attestation \nrequirements found in statute. \n15.  Executive Order 7LL, to which the DSCC does not object, was reasonable given \nthe Covid-19 global pandemic and lowered the statutory and party-rules based bar for petitioning \ncandidates like Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs would have known about Executive Order 7LL prior to the \ncommencement of this year’s petitioning timeframe.  For that matter, the DSCC does not \npresently contemplate how many candidates are petitioning under Executive Order 7LL, much \nless how many of these potential petitioning candidates will be successful in gaining ballot \naccess through the petitioning process under Executive Order 7LL.   \n16.  The DSCC values its First Amendment rights of free speech and association.  The \nnominating convention process is the means by which the Democratic Party shows support for its \nendorsed candidates and it reflects the will of the people that comprise the Democratic Party’s \nmembership.  The party exercises its free speech in the nominating process itself, and upon the \nnomination of a specific candidate for a particular office, it also exercises its freedom of \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 29   Filed 06/02/20   Page 41 of 43\nassociation in determining which candidates it has chosen to best represent the Party and \npromote the Democratic Party’s platform.    \n17.  The endorsement process is also how the Connecticut Democratic Party as a \nwhole develops unity and coalesces its early support behind the candidates of its members’ \ndemocratic choosing.  To disband endorsement convention process would harm the DSCC’s \nability to manage its own party – that is, its own self.   \n18.  I have no knowledge of how many candidates who have challenged Democratic \nParty incumbents obtained 15% of the delegate votes at a convention.  I also have no knowledge \nof how many candidates petitioned in the past, or in 2020 specifically.  Nor do I have any \nknowledge of how many candidates qualified for the ballot by petitioning to challenge \nDemocratic incumbents.    \n19.  I do know that in the past, the named Plaintiffs in this case sought seats that were \nnot open, but rather already held by Democratic incumbents.  To the best of my knowledge, \ninformation and belief, I also understand that the named Plaintiffs in this case are/were not \ncollecting signatures or otherwise attempting to be petition candidates at the time this suit was \nfiled.   \n20.  I declare under penalty of perjury, that the foregoing is true and correct.   \n \nExecuted: June 2, 2020           \n                  JACQUELINE KOZIN \n                  Executive Director \n                  Democratic State Central Committee \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 29   Filed 06/02/20   Page 42 of 43\n                    EXHIBIT C \nGuilford Democrat Andy Gottlieb Joins \n12th District State Senate Race  \n•  Press Release from Andy Gottlieb \n•  Apr 20, 2018  \nAndy Gottlieb, a 24-year-old progressive Democrat from Guilford, announced today his \ncandidacy for the open 12th District Senate seat. \n“This country and this state are in crisis,” said Gottlieb. “Now more than ever, we need a \nDemocratic Party that lives up to its values and delivers for the working and middle class \nin Connecticut.” \nGottlieb is a proud graduate of the Guilford public schools, and was his high school \nclass’ co-valedictorian. He graduated from Wesleyan University, and received his \nmaster’s in international relations and economics from the Johns Hopkins School of \nAdvanced International Studies. He interned for Senator Chris Murphy in Washington, \nand was a Robert Schuman Trainee at the European Parliament in Brussels, where he \nwas posted to the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee. He currently \nstudies electoral reform under former Senator Russ Feingold at the Yale Policy Lab. \nLocally, Gottlieb is a member of the Guilford Democratic Town Committee, Shoreline \nIndivisible’s Connecticut Politics Action Team and the Guilford Land Conservation Trust’s \nWestwoods Trails Committee. \n“My biggest priority as state senator will be to fight back against the short-sighted \nausterity budgets that have been enacted in recent years. Connecticut is one of the \nwealthiest states in the nation and has nearly unparalleled income inequality. Instead of \ncutting services for the most vulnerable, we should ensure that the wealthy pay their fair \nshare of taxes, including closing the carried interest tax loophole.” \nOther priorities will include safeguarding and expanding the right to vote, protecting the \nenvironment, equitable education funding, criminal justice reform and improving public \ntransit. \n“The scheduled cuts to Shore Line East are outrageous.

We must also \nensure that children in Bridgeport can receive just as good an education as children in \nBranford.” \n“Andy is a smart, thoughtful leader who’s going to take the General Assembly by storm,” \nsaid Alex Taubes, the 2014 Democratic nominee for state representative in Madison and \nDurham. “He’s built for this.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n ",

BARTLETT \n \nI, Jason W. Bartlett, hereby declare this 11th day of May, 2020 based on facts within my \npersonal knowledge: \n1.  I am a registered Connecticut voter at 22 Howard Ave., New Haven, CT 06519. \n2.  I  have  filed  paperwork  with  the  Connecticut  State  Elections  Enforcement \nCommission (SEEC) to become a candidate for the 10th State Senate District of the Connecticut \nGeneral Assembly and have filed the legal candidate committee paperwork to raise funds in the \nexploratory designation for such office.   \n3.  I have obtained the paperwork to transition to an official State Senate candidate \ncommittee according to SEEC guidelines and Connecticut law and intend to officially file that \npaperwork the day before the Democratic Party State Senate Convention for the 10th State Senate \nDistrict.  I am following the rules and guidelines as written by the SEEC in order to run for State \nSenate and to abide by the laws of the State of Connecticut in order to receive public financing \nmonies to support my campaign. \n4.  I am a former member of the Connecticut House of Representatives, having served \nin the General Assembly from 2007 to 2011 for the 2nd State House District serving parts of the \n  1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-3   Filed 05/12/20   Page 2 of 6\ntowns of Danbury, Bethel and Redding.  I have also served the former Mayor of New Haven, Toni \nHarp, 2014-2020, as the Director of Youth Services and Liaison to the New Haven Board of \nEducation.  I am also the elected State Central Committee member representing the Cities of New \nHaven & West Haven for State 10th State Senate District within the Connecticut Democratic Party. \n5.  My  experiences  as  an  active  elector,  legislator  and  municipal  employee  and \ncommunity activist enables my desire to serve the people of New Haven as their next State Senator \nfrom the 10th State Senate District.  \n6.  When I decided to run for State Senate in the 10th Senate District, a Democratic-\nmajority voter district, I understood that it would be a challenge to obtain the necessary votes from \nthe delegates who would be appointed by New Haven’s Democratic Party Chair, who had opposed \nthe election campaign of my former employer, Toni Harp, and had opposed my election to the \nState Central Committee two years ago. I knew, based on my knowledge and experience in New \nHaven Democratic Party politics, that New Haven’s Democratic Party Chair would make it highly \nimprobable for me to qualify for the ballot by state party state senate convention.  \n7.  In fact, the New Haven Democratic Party Chair chose the delegates for the state \nparty state senate convention himself.  \n8.  Knowing it was highly improbable that I would qualify for the ballot by state party \nstate senate convention, I ran for office, believing that I would not be precluded from obtaining \nballot access because I could petition my way onto the ballot in a Democratic Party Primary.   \n9.  I have years of experience obtaining ballot petition signatures, because I was \nsuccessful as a campaign manager in charge of obtaining the necessary petitions for a variety of \ncandidates for office and ensuring they achieved ballot access in the State of Connecticut. This \nexperience  includes  successful  petition  access  campaigns  for  James  Newton,  Democratic \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-3   Filed 05/12/20   Page 3 of 6\ncandidate for Mayor of New Haven in 1999, State Senator Martin Looney, Democratic candidate \nfor Mayor of New Haven in 2001, Mary Jane Foster, Democratic candidate for Mayor of \nBridgeport in 2011, and then-Sen. Toni Harp, Democratic candidate for Mayor of New Haven \n2013. I believed, when I began planning to run for office, because of my experience, that I would \nbe able to collect enough signatures from electors to qualify for the ballot in a Democratic Party \nPrimary. \n10.  However, due to COVID-19 and the continuing shelter-at-home orders issued by \nGovernor Lamont, going door-to-door will be impossible to obtain legal signatures in person.  I \nam aware that Governor Lamont issued an executive order allowing for remote notarization to be \nlegal and legitimate with a proper attestation so I have theorized that we could do an electronic \nsignature on petitions. \n11.  Conventions for political office in the Democratic Party are scheduled to begin by \nthe Connecticut Democratic Party on May 10th.  The State Senate Conventions for the City of \nNew Haven are scheduled for May 19, 2020. Time is of the essence. \n12.  Based on my knowledge, training, and experience, I know that political campaigns \nthat challenge incumbent political leaders require foresight, planning, and organization. \n13.  By the time this case was filed, as a candidate for public office challenging a public \nofficial, guidance should have been provided by the Secretary of the State’s office or the Governor \nregarding the establishment of procedures and guidelines to obtain and legally attest electronic \nsignatures for the office I and other candidates seek. \n14.  The  Secretary  of  the  State  and  the  Governor's  office  had  already  articulated \nstrategies to ensure that the Presidential Primary Election delegates have access to the democratic \nsystem months in advance of the elections, but no strategy for Connecticut residents who seek to \n  3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-3   Filed 05/12/20   Page 4 of 6\nobtain access to the ballot in order to represent our Cities, towns and communities in which we \nlive and to hold incumbent officeholders accountable was announced until today. \n15.  I have reviewed the Secretary of the State and the Governor’s new executive order, \nwhich is supposedly meant to provide an alternative to paper petition signatures for candidates \nwho, like me, are unlikely to receive the support of the local party insiders at convention has placed \nan undue burden on my candidacy seeking access to the primary ballot. \n16.  The executive order fails to provide a meaningful alternative to paper petition \nsignatures. Under the executive order, I would still need to obtain 3.5% of the registered members \nof the Democratic Party in my state senate district, a number that likely exceeds 1,000 registered \nDemocrats.   \n17.  The supposed alternative to an in-person paper petition drive requires the voter to \nbe either mailed a petition, or requires candidates to email the petition to the voter, which is \nunlikely because voters’ email addresses are rarely provided in applications to register to vote and \nare therefore not public information. The voter must then sign and mail the petition back to the \ncandidate, or print and sign the petition then upload the petition by photograph or scanner to their \ncomputer and email it back to the candidate. The candidate must then print out all of the emails \nand petitions, one petition and the email that it came with per voter, to the registrar of voters of the \nvoter’s municipality. This new process is cumbersome and costly and the executive order only \ngives two additional days to complete it. \n18.  Unlike applications for absentee ballots, which are being mailed to every voter by \nthe Secretary of the State, petitions will not be mailed to any voters. \n19.  The City of New Haven is doing distance learning, and it is well known that \nbetween 5 to 7 thousand children do not have a computer to be able to do the online learning. \n  4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-3   Filed 05/12/20   Page 5 of 6\nPetitions are routinely circulated online through websites such as Change.org but Governor \nLamont’s order requires people to not only have computers, but also printers and scanners. The \ntotal number of steps and new paperwork created by the Governor’s new order will increase the \ntime spent by either candidates going door-to-door to canvas for the signatures, volunteers, or \nvoters leaving their homes to print or scan documents. \n20.  Given my knowledge, training, and experience running campaigns and collecting \nsignatures, I can easily conclude within a reasonable degree of professional certainty that unless \nthe number of signatures required is capped at 500, and a substantial amount of additional time is \nprovided, there is essentially no way that anyone will qualify for the ballot under the Governor’s \ncumbersome new system for collecting signatures. It is absurd, and demonstrates that the Governor \nhas little concern for candidates’ and voters’ First Amendment rights. \n21.  Every hour and day that passes without being able to plan for a meaningful \nelectronic petition signature gathering effort that we could actually achieve – or some other \nalternative form of ballot access – irreparably harms my ability to exercise my First Amendment \nright to run for office. I can never get that time back. The time lost due to the failure of the Governor \nand the Secretary of the State put me at a competitive disadvantage in my race challenging my \nincumbent State Senator. \n22.  The extreme difficulty of the Governor’s executive order, and the absurdly little \namount of time given to complete its requirements – two extra days – can leave me with no other \nconclusion than that Governor Lamont is intentionally discriminating against candidates for office \nwho are challenging incumbent office-holders. Although I can understand the chief executive’s \ndesire to curry legislative support, I believe it is inconsistent with voters’ First Amendment rights. \n  5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-3   Filed 05/12/20   Page 6 of 6\n23.  In my opinion, if an order from this Court does not issue, time will run out and \nirreparably harm the ability of myself and other candidates for office to meaningfully access the \nballot, unless they are well-connected and have the support of someone like the New Haven \nDemocratic Party Chair. \n24.  This case isn’t just about me. It’s about the voters of New Haven and West Haven, \ntowns dominated by the Democratic Party, who will only have a realistic voice in the selection of \ntheir elected representatives if they can choose from a full range of candidates in the state party \nprimary. Unless candidates are given reasonable access to the ballot in the state party primary, \nDemocratic Party insiders will be able to maintain a political monopoly over many state senate \nand state representative districts in our state.  Unless this Court takes action, the ballot access \nrestrictions in the Governor’s order will deny thousands of voters in cities across Connecticut the \nFirst Amendment right to vote for the candidate of their choice, including candidates with \nsignificant support.  \n* * * \nI declare under penalty of perjury, pursuant to Title 28, § 1746 of the United States Code, \nthat the foregoing is true, correct, and within my personal knowledge. \n/s/Jason W.

Simply put, this is the quintessential civil rights class action, and class \ncertification should be granted. \nThe requirements of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b) are amply met. The \nclass is indisputably numerous. The question at the heart of this case binds together all members \nof the class: do Connecticut’s ballot access requirements, as modified by Defendant Lamont’s \n  1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 14-1   Filed 05/18/20   Page 2 of 7\nrecent  executive  order,  severely  and  unjustifiably  burden  voters’  First  Amendment  rights? \nPlaintiffs’ claims are typical of absent class members and their counsel will adequately and \nvigorously represent the class. Finally, Rule 23(b)(2) is satisfied because Defendant Lamont’s \nexecutive order – and his refusal to take further action – is “on grounds that apply generally to the \nclass” and applies to all voters, as would any injunction or declaration providing relief. \nI.  PROPOSED CLASS DEFINITION \nAll registered voters in Connecticut. \nII.  PROPOSED CLASS REPRESENTATIVES \n  The proposed class representatives are the Plaintiffs, active Connecticut registered voters. \nTheir allegations and their affidavits are incorporated by reference. See ECF 8, 9. \nIII.  ARGUMENT \n  Plaintiffs  seek  class  certification  under  Rule  23,  which  requires  determination  of \ncertification “[a]t an early practicable time.” Rule 23(c)(1)(A). “By its terms, [Rule 23] creates a \ncategorical rule entitling a plaintiff whose suit meets the specified criteria to pursue his claim as a \nclass action.” Shady Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393, 398 (2010). \nThese criteria are met here, so class certification should be granted. \n  Civil rights actions like this case are particularly amenable to class action treatment. Rule \n23 was enacted to “facilitate the bringing of class actions in the civil-rights area.” 7A Wright & \nMiller, Federal Practice & Procedure §1775 (3d ed. 2018). The arguments are particularly strong \nfor class action where individuals are unlikely to pursue claims individually. That is this case. \nVoters are unlikely to bring their own individual claims against to fight onerous state law ballot \naccess requirements. See Campbell v. Bysiewicz, 213 F.Supp.2d 152, 157 (D.Conn. July 23, 2002) \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 14-1   Filed 05/18/20   Page 3 of 7\n(noting that the ballot access laws had “systematically denied Connecticut voters over the last 47 \nyears a direct primary for district and state offices.”).  \nFor these reasons, courts routinely certify voting rights classes comprising all candidates, \npotential candidates, voters, and potential voters in cases such as this seeking injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief from onerous restrictions on the franchise. E.g., Paul v. Indiana Election Bd., \n743 F. Supp. 616, 618 (S.D. Ind. 1990) (certifying class of all potential candidates, voters, and \npotential voters in the State of Indiana in voting case). The challenge of bringing individual cases \nis exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, making class action all the more appropriate.  \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Claim Meets the Prerequisites of Rule 23(a) \n  1.  The proposed class is so numerous that joinder would be impractical. \n  Although there is no “magic number” for numerosity, the Second Circuit has held that a \nproposed class with as few as 40 class members should raise a presumption that joinder is \nimpracticable based on numbers alone. See, e.g., Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 936 (2d Cir. \n1993) (citing cases and treatise). See also NEWBERG ON CLASS ACTIONS (5th. ed. 2018) §3.12. \nNumerosity is easily met here, where the class will exceed 1 million Connecticut voters. \n  2.  The proposed class will be adequately represented.  \nTo show adequacy, Plaintiffs and their counsel must show they will “fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the class.” Rule 23(a)(4). For Plaintiffs, that means showing that their \ninterests are not in conflict with the class. “In order to defeat a motion for certification . . . the \nconflict must be fundamental.” In re Flag Telecom Holdings, Ltd. Sec. Litig., 574 F.3d 29, 35 (2d \nCir. 2009). See also Charron v. Wiener, 731 F.3d 241, 251 (2d Cir. 2013). Alleged conflicts must \nalso not be speculative or hypothetical. In re Olsten Corp. Sec. Litig., 3 F. Supp. 2d 286, 296 \n(E.D.N.Y. 1998), opinion adhered to on reconsideration sub nom. In re Olsten Corp., 181 F.R.D. \n  3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 14-1   Filed 05/18/20   Page 4 of 7\n218 (E.D.N.Y. 1998). (“The court finds that this alleged conflict is speculative and hypothetical, \nand should not prevent [appointment of class representatives].”). No conflicts exist here. Plaintiffs’ \nclaims are typical. \n  In addition, counsel must show that they are qualified, experienced, and able to vigorously \nconduct this proposed litigation. That is the case here. The plaintiffs have retained Alexander T. \nTaubes, Esq., a graduate of Yale Law School, who has significant experience in Election Law, \nClass Actions, and Civil Rights. For those reasons and others counsel satisfy the requirements of \nRule 23(g) and should be appointed class counsel. \n  3.  The plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the class. \nTo satisfy typicality, “a class representative must be part of the class and possess the \nsame interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.” Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, \n457 U.S. 147, 156 (1982). Typicality is not a demanding standard: “When it is alleged that the \nsame unlawful conduct . . . affected both the named plaintiff and the class . . . the typicality \nrequirement is usually met irrespective of minor variations in the fact patterns underlying \nindividual claims.” Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 936–37 (2d Cir. 1993). While numerosity \nand commonality “identify the characteristics that make representative litigation appropriate,” \ntypicality, like adequacy of representation, “focus[es] on the desired attributes of the class’s \nrepresentative.” NEWBERG ON CLASS ACTIONS § 3:28 (5th ed.). The requirement is intended “to \nensure that the interests of the class representative[s] are closely aligned with those of the class, \nso that by pursuing [their] own interests the class representative will also promote those of the \nclass.” Id. at § 3:32 (5th ed.). \nHere typicality is easily met. The class representatives are Connecticut voters suffering \nthe same injury as class members—diminished choices at the ballot box, because potentially \n  4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 14-1   Filed 05/18/20   Page 5 of 7\nviable candidates are being excluded from the state party primary. Their First Amendment claim \nis typical – indeed, identical – to all Connecticut voters.  \n  4.  Common issues pervade this litigation \n  Rule 23(a)(2) requires that “questions of law or fact” be “common to the class.” Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(a)(2). Commonality requires the identification of an issue that by its nature “is capable \nof classwide resolution—which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue \nthat is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.” Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, \nInc., 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011). A single common issue is sufficient to establish commonality. Id. \nat 359 (“We quite agree that for purposes of Rule 23(a)(2) even a single common question will do. \n. . .”) (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citations omitted). \nThe named plaintiffs’ claims satisfy the commonality requirement because “each class \nmember’s claim arises from the same course of events, and each class member makes similar legal \narguments to prove the defendant’s liability.” Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas \nHealth and Welfare Fund v. Merck-Medco Managed Care, LLC, 504 F.3d 229, 245 (2d Cir. 2007). \nThe common claim is that the ballot access laws, as modified by Defendant Lamont’s executive \norder, violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Many common issues of law \nand fact predominate over the common claim: the extent to which the ballot access laws, as \nmodified by the order, burden First Amendment rights; the state interests justifying the restrictions; \nwhether to apply strict scrutiny or a lesser scrutiny to the regulations; whether and to what extent \nthe COVID-19 pandemic affects the First Amendment analysis; and many other legal and fact \nquestions are common among Plaintiffs and all Connecticut voters. \nOf course there are differences among Connecticut voters. Some people eligible to vote \nmay prefer not to vote, while others are enthusiastic about voting, for example. But as courts have \n  5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 14-1   Filed 05/18/20   Page 6 of 7\nrepeatedly recognized, even under the more stringent standards applicable to class actions that seek \ndamages under Rule 23(b)(3), class action treatment is appropriate despite the existence of \nindividual differences among class members. Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo, --- U.S. ---, 136 \nS.Ct. 1036, 1045 (2016) (“When one or more of the central issues in the action are common to the \nclass and can be said to predominate, the action may be considered proper under Rule 23(b)(3) \neven though other important matters will have to be tried separately, such as damages or some \naffirmative defenses peculiar to some individual class members.”) (internal quotation marks and \ncitations omitted). Where as here, the commonalities are readily apparent, Rule 23 is amply \nsatisfied.  \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Claim Meets the Requirements of Rule 23(b)(2)  \n  Plaintiffs’ claim fits within Rule 23(b)(2), which applies when “the party opposing the class \nhas acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, so that final injunctive \nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate with respect to the class as a whole.” The \n“prime examples” of Rule 23(b)(2) cases, Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 614 \n(1997), are civil rights cases like this one, where the defendants have engaged in unlawful behavior \ntoward a defined group. The rule applies, moreover, where “a single injunction or declaratory \njudgment would provide relief to each member of the class” (as opposed, for example, to cases in \nwhich each class member would need an individual injunction or declaration, or in which each \nclass member would be entitled to an individualized award of money damages). Dukes, 564 U.S. \nat 360-61.  \n  Plaintiffs’  First  Claim,  on  which  they  seek  class  certification  today,  satisfies  these \nrequirements. Defendants have engaged in unconstitutional behavior toward the entire class. Every \nmember of the class is at risk of being denied “an effective platform for the expression of views \n  6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 14-1   Filed 05/18/20   Page 7 of 7\non the issues of the day,” Anderson, supra p. 1, because Defendants’ activities will prevent \nlegitimate candidates from accessing the ballot for the August 11, 2020 primary elections. And, \nbecause every member of the class is entitled to relief from this unconstitutional conduct, an \nappropriate injunction or declaration will provide relief on a class-wide basis. “The key to the \n(b)(2) class is the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted – the notion \nthat the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class \nmembers or as to none of them.” Dukes, 564 U.S. at 360. That is this case. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n  Class  certification  should  be  granted,  Plaintiffs  should  be  appointed  as  class \nrepresentatives, and the undersigned should be appointed as class counsel.  \nDated: May 18, 2020          Respectfully Submitted, \nPLAINTIFFS, ANDY GOTTLIEB, \nLORNA CHAND, RICHARD \nLACOURCIERE, AND JASON \nBARTLETT, FOR THEMSELVES AND \nTHE PROPOSED CLASS   \n       \nBy:    /s/     \nAlexander T.

I am 26 years old and a registered Connecticut voter in Guilford. \n2.  I bring this case because Connecticut’s ballot access laws, even with Governor \nLamont’s new executive order, place an undue burden on candidates seeking access to the primary \nballot and on voters seeking to vote for the candidate of their choice. \n3.  Connecticut’s ballot access laws placed severe burdens on the rights of candidates \nand voters before COVID-19. Before COVID-19, even candidates with a significant modicum of \nsupport were confronted with very substantial obstacles in obtaining access to the ballot. The \nthreshold was much more difficult to surmount than is reasonably necessary to achieve the \nlegitimate purpose of screening out candidates with no real support and systematically denied \nConnecticut voters the chance to be heard.  \n4.  Now, with COVID-19, the magnitude of the burdens placed by Connecticut’s ballot \naccess laws have increased even further, and Governor Lamont’s new executive order fails to begin \nto address the magnitude of the present situation. Thus, as a potential candidate for office and as a \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-2   Filed 05/12/20   Page 2 of 6\nConnecticut voter, I feel compelled to bring this action, and the urgency of this matter compels me \nto urge this Court’s issuance of an emergency order. In this affidavit, I explain why I am bringing \nthis case and why I believe it requires immediate action by this Honorable Court. \nA.  Potential Candidate \n5.  As alleged in the Complaint in this action, I ran for the office of state senate in \n2018, and fell just short of the signatures required to qualify for the primary ballot. In 2018, the \nseat was vacant – an “open seat” – but the seat is now occupied by an incumbent Democrat. \n6.  I’ve been asked many times since my 2018 state senate campaign whether I will \never run again. I always say, “Yes, I will! I just don’t know when I might be able to get on the \nballot.” Given that it was next-to-impossible to run for even an open seat, I know that running \nagainst an incumbent would be even more quixotic.  \n7.  Being denied ballot access is not an easy loss to accept, precisely because it’s not \neven a defeat. It feels more like one’s candidacy is put in suspended animation, with voters never \ngetting to weigh in one way or another.  \n8.  As heartbreaking as it would be, I could accept defeat at the polls, because that \nwould have democratic legitimacy. But Connecticut’s ballot access laws make a mockery of those \nideals. A group of party insiders selecting a group of party insiders to be delegates to decide on \nthe nominee (knowing that whoever doesn’t make the cut will be thrown to the wolves in the \npetition process) echoes the worst of closed political systems. \n9.  As far as I can tell, the state has an interest in ensuring that only serious candidates \nmake it onto the ballot. I understand and agree with that proposition, but Connecticut’s laws go \nwell beyond that of almost any other state. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-2   Filed 05/12/20   Page 3 of 6\n10.  Gathering the valid signatures of five percent of all registered Democrats in my \ndistrict is a hefty challenge, but it could be done. Doing so in an arbitrary two-week window in \nlate May and early June is what makes it nearly impossible. Again, I can understand why the state \nwould have a deadline to turn in signatures, but I will never grasp the rational basis of having a \nstart date a mere fourteen days beforehand.  \n11.  In  most  other  states,  I  would  be  given  months  to  gather  such  a  quantity  of \nsignatures. I did my utmost to meet the requirements in 2018, knocking on thousands of doors, \nalong with my volunteers. I certainly demonstrated the earnestness of my candidacy. \n12.  I (rather dangerously) lost seven pounds over two weeks of nonstop petitioning, \ngoing door to door in scorching heat and through torrential downpours.  \n13.  The overwhelming majority of people I spoke with were willing to sign, seeing \nballot access as essential to democracy. \nB.   Voter \n14.  I also believe the ballot access laws violate my rights as a voter.  \n15.  I’m a registered Democrat in a blue state who votes a straight-party ticket in \nNovember. My only real choice could come in a primary.  \n16.  But in the four state elections I’ve been eligible to vote in since I turned 18, not \nonce has there been a primary in either my state representative district or my state senate district.  \n17.  I know firsthand how difficult the process is, and I’m certain that more people \nwould step up to run (and succeed in doing so) if only a viable path existed to getting on the ballot. \n18.  I also desire a way to vote absentee without meeting one of the six narrow excuses \nallowed under current law. Voting is one of our most fundamental rights and should be accessible \nto all citizens, not dependent on one’s physical availability on a single day in August or November. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-2   Filed 05/12/20   Page 4 of 6\nC.  Urgency \n19.  The indefensibility of Connecticut’s ballot access and absentee voting laws has \nbeen brought to the fore by the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n20.  Collecting signatures moves from nearly impossible to absolutely impossible under \nsocial distancing measures, closing off any avenue to candidates not backed at party conventions. \nSimilarly, voting in person goes against social distancing measures. Common sense dictates that \nvoting by mail is the only safe way to conduct an election in the near future.  \n21.  While I was prepared earlier to give the state time to respond to our Complaint, \nafter speaking with Jason Bartlett about the unfair pressures his candidacy is facing due to ballot \naccess uncertainty, I believe that action is required immediately to give candidates a reasonable \nmethod of attaining a spot in their primary. \nD.  The Governor’s New Executive Order \n22.  Reducing the number of signatures by 30% and adding two days to the petition \nperiod does not begin to address the magnitude of the present situation. \n23.  A  Democratic  candidate  in  my  senate  district,  for  instance,  would  still  need \napproximately 700 valid signatures to make the primary ballot. This would be substantially more \nin a district with higher concentrations of registered Democrats, such as the 10th Senate District \nwhere Jason Bartlett is running. \n24.  Corralling  that  many  registered  voters  without  going  door-to-door  would  be \nextraordinarily difficult; a mere 16 days to collect that many signatures under fast-changing \ncircumstances would be completely impossible. Requiring it is completely irrational.  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-2   Filed 05/12/20   Page 5 of 6\n25.  I cannot comprehend why Governor Lamont would insist on such a high standard \nfor a candidate to make the primary ballot, except to exclude those disfavored by the party \nestablishment. \n26.  A reasonable standard would be at least a month to gather petition signatures, along \nwith a reduction of the needed signatures by at least 80% or simply a fixed number of signatures, \nsuch as 100 for state senate candidates and 50 for state representative candidates. This would be \nsufficient to prove that the candidate has a significant modicum of voter support.  \n27.  The use of electronic signatures could ameliorate the burden somewhat, but the \nexecutive order makes it as cumbersome as possible. \n28.  Requiring potential petition signers to print out, sign, scan, and email the petition \nform puts the process out of reach for all but the most determined and well-resourced voters.  \n29.  The only other option, of mailing in the form, also places an undue burden on the \nvoter – unless Secretary Merrill decides to send every registered voter a petition form with a self-\naddressed stamped envelope, as she is planning on doing for absentee ballot application forms. \n30.  A reasonable standard would be for the Secretary to set up a web form, similar to \nthe very successful one already used for registering to vote or checking a voter’s registration. A \nvoter could simply type in their name, town, and birthdate, and be presented with a dropdown of \npetitioning candidates in their district. The voter could then select which candidates they would \n“sign” for and submit directly to the Secretary. The procedure would be straightforward and secure.  \n31.  Keep in mind that party convention candidates’ delegates are being allowed to \nappear via Zoom to ratify their choices in this year’s conventions, and it is likely that no incumbent \noffice-holder in the State of Connecticut will be required to collect any petition signatures at all, \nbecause they will be nominated by the party convention.  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00623-JCH   Document 9-2   Filed 05/12/20   Page 6 of 6\n32.  Each day that passes without action causes greater irreparable injury placing an \never-greater undue burden on candidates seeking access to the primary ballot and, by discouraging \nthem, on voters seeking to vote for the candidate of their choice. \n* * * \nI swear under penalty of perjury, pursuant to Title 28, § 1746 of the United States Code, \nthat the foregoing is true, correct, and within my personal knowledge. \n \n/s/Andy Gottlieb       \nAndy Gottlieb \nDated this 7th day of May, 2020 \n \nNOTARIZATION \n \nSubscribed to and sworn before me, this 11th day of May, 2020, through Communication \nTechnology pursuant to the terms of Governor Lamont’s Executive Order No. 7Q (3). \n \n/s/         \nAlexander T.
