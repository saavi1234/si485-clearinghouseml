    "summary": "<p>On April 23, 2020, an Illinois State Representative filed this lawsuit suit in the Clay County Circuit Court. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiff sued the Governor of Illinois under state law, asserting that the governor lacked authority under the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act (the Act) to extend the state's stay at home order through the end of April. The plaintiff sought a declaration that the extended stay at home order was \"in excess of the authority granted . . . under the act.\" The plaintiff also sought to enjoin the Governor from enforcing the extended stay at home order against the plaintiff.</p>\r\n<p>This case arose from Illinois' response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 9, 2020, the Governor issued a proclamation under the Act declaring that the COVID-19 pandemic was a public health emergency rising to the level of a disaster. The Act conferred on the Governor emergency powers for 30 days following the declaration. Under his emergency powers, the Governor issued an executive order on March 20 requiring that Illinois residents only leave their home for essential activities or business. This executive order was effective until April 8. On April 1, the Governor declared that the COVID-19 pandemic was a \"continuing public health emergency\" and issued an executive order extending the stay at home requirement until April 30.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff asserted that under the Act, the Governor lacked the authority to extend the March 20 executive order beyond April 8, which was 30 days after the initial disaster declaration. The plaintiff further alleged that the executive order \"limit[ed] [the plaintiff's] constitutionally protected freedoms in that it ordered him to stay at home, or at his place of residence, as well as limited his ability to travel within the state.\"</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), asserting that the executive order was causing irreparable harm by ordering him to stay at home and avoid travel.</p>\r\n<p>The same day, Judge Michael McHaney granted the the plaintiff's motion for a TRO and enjoined the Governor from enforcing the stay at home order against the plaintiff. Judge McHaney found that the plaintiff \"has a clearly ascertainable right in need of immediate protection, namely his liberty interest to be free from [defendant's] executive order of quarantine in his own home.\" Judge McHaney also concluded that the plaintiff had a reasonable likelihood of succeeding on the merits, would suffer irreparable harm if a TRO were not issued, and had no adequate remedy at law.</p>\r\n<p>The Governor immediately appealed to the Fifth District Appellate Court and filed an emergency motion for direct appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court. Before the appellate court could rule, the plaintiff consented to the vacating of the TRO, and the matter was remanded to the circuit court on May 1.</p>\r\n<p>On May 13, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The plaintiff maintained his argument that the Governor exceeded his authority in extending the stay at home order. In addition, the plaintiff asserted that the April 30 disaster proclamation was void because the continuing public health emergency failed to meet the statutory definition of a disaster. The plaintiff further argued that the governor \"had no Illinois constitutional authority to restrict citizen's movement or activities and/or forcibly close the business premises\" and that this authority was delegated to the Department of Health.</p>\r\n<p>On May 18, the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment.</p>\r\n<p>On May 21, the Governor removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. He asserted that the district court had federal question jurisdiction because the \"action seeks redress for alleged deprivations of [plaintiff's] federal constitutional rights caused by actions taken under color of state law.\" He asserted that the action sought to redress the \"alleged deprivation of [plaintiff's] . . . First Amendment right to free exercise of religion, his Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process, his right to interstate travel, and the right to a Republican Form of Government conferred by Article IV, Section 4 of the United States Constitution.\" The case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Gilbert C. Sison.</p>\r\n<p>Later that day, the plaintiff filed an emergency motion to remand the case. The plaintiff argued that the matter raised \"nothing but questions concerning Defendant's authority under certain Illinois statutes\" and asserted that the defendant was \"intent on forum shopping and want[ed] nothing more than to derail state court proceedings.\" Plaintiff further contended that \"Whether or not Defendant&rsquo;s actions infringe on rights existing under the United States Constitution is irrelevant to and mentioned nowhere in Plaintiff&rsquo;s complaint or first amended complaint\" and that \"the core of Plaintiff&rsquo;s causes of action, is not 'capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the federal-state balance.'&rdquo; Plaintiff additionally sought expedited relief and attorneys' fees.</p>\r\n<p>A day later, on May 22, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a statement of interest supporting the plaintiff's motion \"because the plaintiff makes no federal claim.\" First, the DOJ asserted that the defendant misread the amended complaint and that \"plaintiff has elected to proceed on only state law claims, and removal is thus improper.\" Moreover, the DOJ contended that the Governor exceeded his authority when issuing the executive orders. Lastly, the DOJ argued that while the case had federal implications, these implications were not sufficient to support removal.</p>\r\n<p>On June 29, 2020, Judge Sison remanded the case. While calling the decision \"a close call,\" Judge Sison reasoned that the \"most straightforward reading\" of the amended complaint was that the plaintiff sued under the Illinois declaratory judgment statute seeking resolution of state-law questions about the extent of the Governor's power; any implicit federal constitutional issues were \"not central\" to the case. Judge Sison also rejected the Governor's argument that 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1343(a)(3) (a largely defunct statute that allows civil rights plaintiffs to sue in federal court regardless of the amount in controversy, useful decades ago when 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1331 had an amount in controversy requirement) conferred broader jurisdiction than &sect; 1331. However, Judge Sison rejected the plaintiff's motion for fees, finding that removal was non-frivolous since the complaint referred to constitutional rights. 2020 WL 3498428.</p>\r\n<p>Three days later, Judge McHaney granted partial summary judgment for the plaintiff. Judge McHaney declared that the Governor's second and third disaster proclamations were void because they arose from the same \"occurrence or threat\" that gave rise to the first proclamation yet extended beyond the Act's 30-day limit. Judge McHaney also declared that the proclamations' substantive provisions were invalid because the Act did not give the Governor \"any authority to restrict a citizen's movement or activities.\" In addition, Judge McHaney held that the decision applied to all citizens of Illinois. But he declined to issue an injunction and denied summary judgment on the plaintiff's claims that COVID-19 did not meet the Act's definition of a disaster.</p>\r\n<p>On July 7, the Governor moved to dismiss the plaintiff's remaining claim that COVID-19 was not a disaster under the Act.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the plaintiff felt that the Governor had not complied with the circuit court's summary judgment ruling. So, he filed a motion to hold the Governor in civil contempt on August 5, 2020. In response, the circuit court on August 7 issued the Governor a show cause order. The Governor sought a supervisory order from the Illinois Supreme Court, which stayed the contempt hearing on August 11 but refused to issue a supervisory order. Instead, the Court ordered this case consolidated with <em>Craig v. Pritzker</em>, No. 20 MR 589, in the Sangamon County Circuit Court before Judge Raylene D. Grischow.</p>\r\n<p>After consolidation, the Governor promptly filed a motion to vacate the Clay County Circuit Court's July 2 summary judgement decision for lack of jurisdiction. That motion is pending as of October 12, 2020; the case is ongoing.</p>",

      "text": "Case 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 29   Filed 06/15/20   Page 1 of 4   Page ID #472\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS \nEAST ST. LOUIS DIVISION \n \nDARREN BAILEY,   \n   \nPlaintiff,   \nv.   \n  No. 3:20-cv-00474-GCS \nGOVERNOR JB PRITZKER, in his official   \ncapacity,  Magistrate Judge Gilbert C. Sison \n \nDefendant. \n \nGOVERNOR’S SUR-REPLY TO BAILEY’S REPLY \n \nBailey’s reply, like his many filings since removal (ECF 7, 8, 9, 16, 18, 25, 27), still does \nnot confront the primary basis for removal here—the plain text of 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3), which \ngrants federal courts “original jurisdiction of any civil action authorized by law . . . [t]o redress \nthe deprivation, under color of any State law… of any right, privilege or immunity secured by \nthe Constitution of the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) (emphasis added). Instead, Bailey \ncontinues to maintain, without citing authority, that the Court should evaluate its jurisdiction \nsolely under the standard set by § 1331. (ECF 25 (“Reply”) at 2, 3, 7–8, 9–10.) But § 1331 is not \nat issue here. \nAnd rather than unequivocally disclaim and remove his allegations pertaining to rights \nsecured by the U.S. Constitution (ECF 24 at 5 n.2), Bailey doubles down by stating: “Does \nPlaintiff claim [the Governor has] restrict[ed] his ability to travel, ability to associate with others, \nand practice his faith? He absolutely does . . . .” (Reply at 4.) This admission, coupled with the \nplain language of § 1343(a)(3), should end the inquiry. \nBailey’s reply points to dicta in Myles v. U.S., 416 F.3d 551 (7th Cir. 2005), to argue that \n§ 1343(a)(3) was impliedly repealed through the removal of the amount-in-controversy \n  1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 29   Filed 06/15/20   Page 2 of 4   Page ID #473\nrequirement from § 1331. (Reply at 2, 7–8, 9–10.) That argument ignores binding Supreme Court \nprecedent rejecting repeals by implication. (ECF 24 at 20.)1 Bailey also ignores that after Myles, \nthe Seventh Circuit has accepted the ongoing vitality of § 1343(a)(3). See, e.g., Canen v. \nChapman, 847 F.3d 407, 409 n.1 (7th Cir. 2017).  \nBailey then insists that “the only plausible explanation” for the outcome in Spaulding v. \nMingo Bd. Of Educ., 897 F. Supp. 284 (S.D.W. Va. 1995), is that the court “found ‘embedded’ \nfederal claims that conferred jurisdiction,” an approach Bailey asserts was invalidated in Grable \nv. Darue, 545 U.S. 308 (2005). (Reply at 9.) Bailey is wrong for two reasons. First, the \n“explanation” for Spaulding is in the Spaulding opinion itself, not in a strawman created by \nBailey: federal “original jurisdiction [exists] pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1343(a)(3)” where a party has \n“alleged a deprivation under color of state laws, statutes, and regulations of rights secured under \nthe Constitution of the United States,” whether or not that party brings claims that arise under \nfederal law. 897 F. Supp. at 289.  \nSecond, Bailey misdescribes the ruling in Grable. (Reply at 9.) Grable focused on the \nmeaning of a specific phrase in 28 U.S.C. § 1331: “arising under the Constitution, laws, or \ntreaties of the United States,” 545 U.S. at 312, and then addressed when a court may accept \njurisdiction of state-law claims under § 1331. Grable does not mention § 1343(a)(3). Thus, \nGrable does not affect Spaulding’s analysis or the scope of jurisdiction under § 1343(a)(3). As \ndiscussed in the Governor’s opposition to remand, § 1343(a)(3) is not limited to claims “arising \n \n1 Bailey’s implied repeal argument fails for another reason: § 1343(a)(3) was enacted before \n§ 1331. (ECF 24 at 8.) When Congress enacted § 1343(a)(3) it could not have known that \n“federal question” jurisdiction would ever be authorized with or without an amount in \ncontroversy requirement. The creation of federal question jurisdiction with an amount-in-\ncontroversy requirement, and the subsequent elimination of that requirement, thus did not affect \nthe scope of § 1343(a)(3), which is plainly not “subsumed” into § 1331. (Reply at 8.) Section \n1343(a)(3) is an independent jurisdictional grant that stands on its own, unrelated to § 1331. \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 29   Filed 06/15/20   Page 3 of 4   Page ID #474\nunder” federal law. Because Congress has shown that it can limit jurisdiction using “arising \nunder” language when it wishes to, Congress’ decision to extend § 1343(a)(3) to “any civil \naction authorized by law” must be respected. (ECF 24 at 7–10.)2  \nFinally, Bailey tries to evade the decision in Rodriguez v. Comas, 888 F.2d 899 (1st Cir. \n1989), by claiming that there “the plaintiff specifically stated a cause of action under [§] 1983.” \n(Reply at 10.) Bailey misreads the case. While one plaintiff, Jose Rodriguez, asserted a § 1983 \nclaim, the portion of the ruling cited by the Governor concerns state-law claims for “emotional \ndistress” brought by his wife, Irma Rodriguez. Rodriguez, 888 F.2d at 903. The Court ruled that \nthe trial court properly exercised jurisdiction over Irma’s state-law emotional distress claims \nbecause § 1343(a)(3) is “a broadly worded jurisdictional grant,” and “is open-ended—applying \nto any person and over any civil action.” Id. at 906 (emphasis added). Thus, Rodriguez shows \nthat § 1343(a)(3) means exactly what it says—it is an independent basis for federal jurisdiction \nthat is apart from, and can apply to a broader range of claims than, § 1331.  \nAs he has freely admitted, and despite his attempts to evade federal jurisdiction through \nartful pleading, Bailey seeks redress for alleged constitutional deprivations under color of state \nlaw. Based on the plain text of § 1343(a)(3) the Court has jurisdiction of this case. Bailey’s \nmotion to remand should be denied. \nDated: June 15, 2020  Respectfully Submitted, \n   \nKWAME RAOUL  /s/ Thomas J. Verticchio       \nAttorney General of Illinois   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n \n2 Bailey’s reliance on Merrell Dow v. Thompson, 478 U.S. 804 (1986), and Caterpillar v. \nWilliams, 482 U.S. 386 (1987), is similarly misplaced. (Reply at 3.) Both cases concern § 1331 \n“arising under” jurisdiction; neither decision mentions § 1343(a)(3).  \n  3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 29   Filed 06/15/20   Page 4 of 4   Page ID #475\n   \n   \nR.

      "text": "Case 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 11   Filed 05/22/20   Page 1 of 5   Page ID #269\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS \nEAST ST. LOUIS DIVISION \n \nDARREN BAILEY,   \n   \nPlaintiff,   \n   \nv.  No. 3:20-cv-00474-GCS \n   \nGOVERNOR JB PRITZKER, in his official  Magistrate Judge Gilbert C. Sison \ncapacity, \n \nDefendant. \n \nGOVERNOR’S MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION  \nTO EXPEDITE HEARING ON EMERGENCY MOTION TO REMAND \n \nGovernor JB Pritzker, by his attorney, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, \nrespectfully submits this memorandum in opposition to Plaintiff Darren Bailey’s Motion To \nExpedite Hearing On Emergency Motion To Remand. (ECF 9.) The Court should reject Bailey’s \nrequest for the Court to remand the case sua sponte without even allowing the Governor to \nrespond on the merits of removal. Bailey provides no basis for expediting a hearing on his \nremand motion. To the contrary, his actions in this litigation bely any claim of an emergency. He \nvacated the TRO he previously obtained in state court, delayed two weeks before filing an \namended complaint and, after filing it, did not seek emergency relief or an expedited hearing.  \nThat said, the Governor will be prepared to respond on the merits of Bailey’s remand \nmotion by Friday, June 5, 2020, or on a date set by the Court. In the meantime, the Governor’s \ncounsel acknowledge the Court’s status call on May 26, 2020, at 1 p.m. and will be on that call. \nProcedural Background \n1.  On April 23, 2020, Bailey sued the Governor in the Circuit Court for the Fourth \nJudicial Circuit in Clay County, Illinois (the “State Court”), challenging the Governor’s authority \nto issue executive orders in the fight against the COVID-19 public health emergency. (ECF 1 at \n  1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 11   Filed 05/22/20   Page 2 of 5   Page ID #270\nEx. E.) Bailey followed with a motion for a temporary restraining order that was heard on April \n27, 2020. (ECF 1 at Ex. B.) On April 27, 2020, the State Court granted Bailey’s motion for a \nTRO, but after the Governor appealed, Bailey requested that the TRO be vacated, which the \nIllinois appellate court did on April 30, 2020. (ECF 1 at Ex. I.) \n2.  On Friday, May 15, 2020, the State Court granted Bailey leave to file an amended \ncomplaint, and then, sua sponte, set a one-week schedule for summary judgment briefing. On \nMonday, May 18, 2020, Bailey filed a motion for summary judgment, then filed a brief in \nsupport of his motion the next day. Bailey did not seek a temporary restraining order, a \npreliminary injunction, or any other form of expedited or emergency briefing schedule or relief \nin connection with his amended complaint or summary judgment motion. (ECF 8 at 4.) \n3.  On May 21, 2020, for the reasons stated in the Notice of Removal, the Governor \nremoved this matter to this Court. (ECF 1.)  \n4.  Later on May 21, 2020, Bailey filed papers styled an “Emergency Motion To \nRemand” (ECF 7), “Memorandum In Support Of Emergency Motion To Remand” (ECF 8), and \n“Motion To Expedite Hearing On Emergency Motion To Remand” (ECF 9). Consistent with \nLocal Rule 7.1, the court automatically gave the Governor until June 25, 2020 to respond to the \nremand motion. (ECF 7.) Bailey has requested that the Court waive Local Rule 7.1, consider his \n“Emergency Motion To Remand” on an expedited basis, remand the case “sua sponte,” and “not \neven give [the Governor] the benefit of time to respond” to Bailey’s remand motion. (ECF 9 ¶ 5.) \nOn May 22, 2020, the Court set a telephonic status conference for May 26, 2020. (ECF 10.) \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 11   Filed 05/22/20   Page 3 of 5   Page ID #271\nBailey’s request for expedited remand without time to respond should be denied. \n5.  There is no emergency that would require the Court to waive the federal rules of \ncivil procedure and this Court’s Local Rules, and decide Bailey’s remand motion on an \nexpedited basis without granting the Governor time to respond in writing.  \n6.  Bailey bases his demand for “emergency” consideration of his remand motion on \na professed “exigency of the circumstances, including the prior scheduling of a motion hearing.” \n(ECF 9 ¶ 6.) There was no emergency in the removed action. Bailey had not filed any emergency \nmotion on his amended complaint, and he had previously voluntarily vacated the TRO he was \ngranted on April 27, 2020. See Bailey v. Pritzker, 2020 WL 2116566, *1 (Ill. App. Ct. 2020). His \nconduct belies his claim of an emergency now.  \n7.  Bailey further asserts this matter should be expedited because “federal jurisdiction \nis non-existent in this case, and it is not even a close call.” (ECF 9 ¶ 5.) This assertion prejudges \nthe merits of the Governor’s removal and Bailey’s remand motion. Bailey’s request is contrary to \nthe rules of civil procedure, the Local Rules of the Court, and court precedent. See Darnell v. \nHoelscher Inc., 2011 WL 2461951, *1 (S.D. Ill. 2011) (allowing legal issues relating to removal \nto be fully briefed and denying remand, notwithstanding plaintiff’s “emergency motion to \nremand”). \nFor each of these reasons, the Governor respectfully requests that the Court deny Bailey’s \nMotion To Expedite Hearing On Emergency Remand. Although the Court has already set June \n25, 2020 for the Governor’s response to the remand motion consistent with Local Rule 7.1, the \nGovernor will be prepared to respond within 14 days from today, by June 5, 2020, or on another \ndate set by the Court, even though no emergency justifies expedited briefing. \nDated: May 22, 2020  Respectfully Submitted, \n   \nKWAME RAOUL  /s/ R.

(ECF 1-1, \nEx.  E.) Bailey alleged that the Governor’s executive order issued on March 20, 2020 “limit[ed] \nBailey’s constitutionally protected freedoms in that it ordered him to stay at home, or at his place \nof residence, as well as limited his ability to travel within the state.” (Id. ¶ 12.) Bailey further \nalleged that the Governor continued to deprive him of these “constitutionally protected \nfreedoms” by issuing an additional executive order on April 1, 2020, that “acted to restrain \nBailey within his residence, as well as limit his travel.” (Id. ¶ 19.) To redress these deprivations, \nBailey sought a declaratory judgment finding, inter alia, “that any further emergency executive \norders in response to the COVID-19 continuing disaster . . . ordering Bailey remain within the \nconfines of his home, as well as limit his travel . . . are void ab initio.” (Id. ¶ 34(E).) Bailey also \nsought an injunction enforcing that declaratory judgment. (Id. ¶¶ 35–40.) \nThe State Court grants Bailey a temporary restraining order to protect Bailey’s \n“constitutionally protected freedoms,” but Bailey vacates the TRO. \nOn April 24, 2020, Bailey served on the Governor a motion for temporary restraining \norder and preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Governor from enforcing any COVID-19 \n  1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24   Filed 06/05/20   Page 3 of 23   Page ID #344\nexecutive orders against him. (ECF 1-1, Exs. C, F, G.) That motion was heard on April 27, 2020. \n(ECF 1-1, Ex. B.) \nThe State Court granted Bailey his requested TRO. Following the presentation of Bailey’s \nargument, the State Court ruled that irreparable harm existed on federal constitutional grounds, \nnoting that “every second this Executive Order is in existence . . . the Bill of Rights is being \nshredded. That is irreparable harm.” (Ex. A, at 60:17–21, Apr. 27, 2020 Report of Proceedings \n(“Apr. 27, 2020 Tr.”).) In addition, the State Court also found a likelihood of success on the merits \nfor Bailey’s claims on federal constitutional grounds: \nThe court is guided by, among other things, the following: There is no pandemic \nexception to the fundamental liberties the constitution safeguards. Indeed, individual \nrights secured by the constitution do not disappear during a public health crisis. That’s In \nRe: Abbott, A-b-b-o-t-t, Federal 3d, 2020 West Law 1685929. That’s a Fifth Circuit \nappellate opinion. These individual rights, including the protections in the Bill of Rights \nmade applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, are always in force and \nrestrain government action. At the same time, the constitution does not hobble \ngovernment from taking necessary temporary measures to meet a genuine emergency. \nAccording to our United States Supreme Court, in every well-ordered society charged \nwith the duty of preserving, conserving the safety its members, the rights of the \nindividual in respect of his liberty may, at times, under the pressure of great dangers, be \nsubjected to such restraint, to be enforced by reasonable regulations, as the safety of the \ngeneral public may demand, and that is the Jacobson case which was also cited by the \nAttorney General. The settled rule from Jacobson, the Fifth Circuit recently explained, \nallows the state to restrict, for example, one’s right to peaceably assemble, to publicly \nworship, to travel, and even to leave one's home. Courts owe substantial deference to \ngovernment actions, particularly when exercised by states and localities under their police \npowers during a bona fide emergency. The Supreme Court also has instructed courts to \nintervene if a statute purporting to have been enacted to protect the public health or the \npublic safety has no real or substantial relation to those objects, or is, beyond all question, \na plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law. That is also a quote \nfrom Jacobson . . . .  \n \nThe issue before me now is whether the Governor can ignore the Illinois and United \nStates Constitutions for more than 30 days. This court rules that the answer to that \nquestion is a resounding no. \n  \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24   Filed 06/05/20   Page 4 of 23   Page ID #345\n(Id. at 64:12–66:19.)1 At no time did Bailey dispute the federal constitutional basis for Bailey’s \nTRO, or the State Court’s ruling. In fact, when the State Court asked Bailey to show why Bailey \nshould not be required to post bond for the TRO, Bailey’s counsel replied “[w]hat showing \nwould the court require for bond sufficient for my client to be able to continue with his \nconstitutional rights . . . ?” (Id. at 68:5–7.) And the State Court TRO, which was drafted by \nBailey and entered by the State Court without substantive revision, expressly stated “Plaintiff has \nshown he has a clearly ascertainable right in need of immediate protection, namely his liberty \ninterest to be free from Pritzker’s executive order.” (ECF 1-1, Ex. B ¶ 5.) The Governor \nimmediately appealed to the Illinois Appellate Court. Rather than defend the TRO on appeal, \nBailey voluntarily vacated the TRO, and the case returned to the trial court. (ECF 1-1, Ex. I.) \nBailey amends his complaint, but continues to seek redress for deprivations under color of \nstate law of rights secured by the United States Constitution. \nOn May 15, 2020, Bailey received leave to file an amended complaint. Although Bailey \nremoved references to the Constitution, Bailey’s amended complaint remained predicated on his \nprior allegations that the Governor’s executive orders deprived him of rights, under color or state \nlaw, that are secured by the U.S. Constitution. First, Bailey reiterated his allegations that the \nGovernor violated his “liberty interest.” (Compare, e.g., ECF 1-1, Ex. A ¶¶ 105–107 (seeking \nredress for Governor’s alleged “utilization of the police powers of the State” to “[r]estrict a \ncitizen’s movement or activities”) with ECF 1-1, Ex. E ¶ 12 (Governor allegedly “limit[ed] \nBailey’s constitutionally protected freedoms in that it ordered him to stay at home, or at his place \nof residence.”).) Second, Bailey reiterated his allegation that the Governor violated his right to \n \n1 The State Court’s ruling was fundamentally flawed, and entirely inconsistent with the authority \nthe State Court cited. Given that this memorandum is focused on the Court’s jurisdiction and not \nthe merits of Bailey’s claims, however, the Governor will not comment further here on the State \nCourt’s erroneous ruling. \n  3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24   Filed 06/05/20   Page 5 of 23   Page ID #346\nfreedom of travel. (Compare, e.g., ECF 1-1, Ex. A, ¶¶ 105–110 (seeking redress for Governor’s \nalleged actions “restrict[ing] . . . citizen’s [sic] movement”) with ECF 1-1, Ex. E ¶ 12 (Governor \nallegedly “limit[ed] Bailey’s constitutionally protected freedoms in that [he] . . . limited his \nability to travel within the state”).  \nIn addition, Bailey’s amended complaint included allegations of two additional \ndeprivations under color of state law of rights or privileges secured by the U.S. Constitution. \nBailey added allegations that the Governor is violating his right to free exercise of religion. (ECF \n1-1, Ex. A, ¶ 71, seeking redress for Governor’s alleged actions “preventing Bailey from \nattending worship services.”) Bailey also added allegations that the Governor seized “unilateral \ncontrol over the movement and livelihood of every citizen in the State. The legislative branch \nduring this period of executive rule under the emergency powers has been rendered \nmeaningless.” (Id. ¶¶ 84–85.) This alleges a violation of Article IV, § 4 of the U.S. Constitution, \nwhich provides that “[t]he United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a \nRepublican Form of Government.”  \nThe Governor removes this action to federal court, and Bailey seeks remand. \nOn May 21, 2020, the Governor removed this action to this Court based on federal \njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3). (ECF 1.) Bailey filed an “Emergency Motion To \nRemand” (ECF 7), “Memorandum In Support Of Emergency Motion To Remand” (ECF 8), and \n“Motion To Expedite Hearing On Emergency Motion To Remand” (ECF 9). On May 22, 2020, \nthe Governor filed an opposition to Bailey’s request for the Court to remand the case sua sponte \nwithout granting the Governor the opportunity to respond. (ECF 11.)  Separately, the United \nStates Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a Statement of Interest (“DOJ Statement”). (ECF 15.) \n  4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24   Filed 06/05/20   Page 6 of 23   Page ID #347\nNeither Bailey’s filings nor the DOJ Statement substantively address the scope of federal \njurisdiction under Section 1343(a)(3). (ECF 7, 8, 9, 15.)  \nAlthough Bailey asserts in his remand motion that his requested relief is not predicated \non alleged deprivations of his constitutional rights (e.g., ECF 8 at 3), Bailey separately continues \nto contend that the Governor “has issued orders which control Plaintiff’s activities, travel, and \nassociation with others” (ECF 18 ¶ 10). As shown below, this Court has jurisdiction to redress \nthese alleged deprivations of constitutional rights.2    \nArgument \nThis Court has jurisdiction over this action under the plain language of 28 U.S.C. § \n1343(a)(3) because Bailey seeks redress based on allegations that the Governor, acting under \ncolor of state law, has deprived him of rights secured by the U.S. Constitution. \nI.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3). \nA. The plain language of 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) provides district courts with \njurisdiction over actions seeking redress for alleged deprivations under color of \nState law of rights secured by the United States Constitution.  \n \nThe Governor removed this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a) based on the Court’s \noriginal jurisdiction provided by 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) (ECF 1), which states: \nThe district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action authorized by \nlaw to be commenced by any person . . . To redress the deprivation, under color of \nany State law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any right, \nprivilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States . . . . \n \nThe Governor removed solely based on Section 1343(a)(3), and not based on “arising under” \njurisdiction provided by 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Bailey’s and the DOJ’s arguments based on Section \n \n2 Bailey could have submitted an amended complaint that deleted all references to, and expressly \ndisavowed seeking redress for, alleged deprivations of rights secured by the U.S. Constitution, \nbut he has not done so. \n  5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24   Filed 06/05/20   Page 7 of 23   Page ID #348\n1331 are therefore misplaced. The plain language of 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) provides that \nSection 1343(a)(3) jurisdiction encompasses actions (such as that brought by Bailey) seeking \nredress for alleged deprivations of constitutional rights under color of state law.  \nIn construing a statute, “a court’s proper starting point lies in a careful examination of the \nordinary meaning and structure of the law itself. Where . . . that examination yields a clear \nanswer, judges must stop.” Food Mktg. Inst. v. Argus Leader Media, 139 S. Ct. 2356, 2364 \n(2019) (internal citations omitted); see also Moskal v. United States, 498 U.S. 103, 108 (1990). \nThe plain language of Section 1343(a)(3) provides that federal district courts have original \njurisdiction over “any civil action authorized by law” commenced by any person: (a) “to redress \nthe deprivation . . . of any right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United \nStates” that (b) occurs “under color of any State law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or \nusage.” 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) (emphasis added). \nInterpreting this language, the First Circuit Court of Appeals observed that Section \n1343(a)(3) is “a broadly worded jurisdictional grant.” Rodriguez v. Comas, 888 F.2d 899, 906 \n(1st Cir. 1989). More specifically, the First Circuit instructed that: \n[T]he grant of jurisdiction is over ‘any civil action authorized by law to be commenced by \nany person ...’ (emphasis added). 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a). In contrast to [other jurisdictional \ngrants], the jurisdictional statute here is open-ended—applying to any person and over \nany civil action. \nId. (emphasis added, citations in the original). The First Circuit’s decision in Rodriguez \nconfirmed what the Fifth Circuit previously observed: jurisdiction exists under Section \n1343(a)(3) if a party brings a claim under either federal civil rights causes of action, “or other \nappropriate legal authority.” Campbell v. Gadsden Cty. Dist. Sch. Bd., 534 F.2d 650, 655 n.3 (5th \nCir. 1976); see also Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528, 538 (1974) (Section 1343(a)(3) \n“unquestionably authorize[s] federal courts to entertain suits to redress the deprivation, under \n  6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24   Filed 06/05/20   Page 8 of 23   Page ID #349\ncolor of state law, of constitutional rights. It is also plain that the complaint formally alleged such \na deprivation.”); Spaulding v. Mingo Cty. Bd. of Educ., 897 F. Supp. 284, 288 (S.D.W. Va. 1995) \n(finding Section 1343(a)(3) jurisdiction existed over state law claims removed to federal court \nbecause “the substance and essence of the Complaint . . .  alleged a deprivation under color of \nstate laws . . . of rights secured under the Constitution of the United States”). \nBy its terms, and as interpreted by at least two federal appellate courts and one federal \ndistrict court, Section 1343(a)(3) allows a district court to exercise original jurisdiction over \ncauses of action that assert non-federal claims, to the extent that those claims are predicated on \nand seek to “redress the deprivation . . . of any right, privilege or immunity secured by the \nConstitution of the United States” under color of state law. This is in contrast to actions brought \n(or removed) under Section 1331, which covers only claims that “arise under” federal law. \nAccordingly, and consistent with the plain language of Section 1343(a)(3), Bailey’s state law \nclaims are subject to the original jurisdiction of the Court because they were “commenced” to \n“redress the deprivation of” at least four rights secured by the U.S. Constitution (Bailey’s liberty \ninterest, right to travel, right to worship, and right to a republican form of government).   \nB.  Section 1343(a)(3), read in the context in which it was passed into law and together \nwith related statutes, grants federal jurisdiction here. \n“[W]hen deciding whether the language is plain, we must read the words in their context \nand with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme. [A court’s] duty, after all, is to \nconstrue statutes, not isolated provisions.” King v. Burwell, 135 S. Ct. 2480, 2489 (2015) \n(internal citations and quotation marks omitted); see also Samantar v. Yousuf, 560 U.S. 305, 319 \n(2010) (“we do not . . . construe statutory phrases in isolation; we read statutes as a whole.”).  \nThe scope of Section 1343(a)(3) is apparent when read, as the Supreme Court has \nrequired, in the context of the statute in which it became law: Chapters 3 and 7 of Title XIII of \n  7 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24   Filed 06/05/20   Page 9 of 23   Page ID #350\nthe Revised Statutes of the United States of 1874 (the “Revised Statutes”).3 Chapman v. Houston \nWelfare Rights Org., 441 U.S. 600, 608–09 (1979) (“In 1874, Congress enacted the Revised \nStatutes of the United States,” including the language “now found in [Section 1343(a)(3)].”). \nWhen the Revised Statutes became law, Congress had not yet authorized federal courts to \nexercise “federal question” jurisdiction—the language that is now codified at 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \nwould not be passed until 1875. See Act of March 3, 1875, § 1, 18 Stat. 470. Instead, through the \nRevised Statutes, Congress authorized various federal courts to exercise original jurisdiction over \nclaims in nearly twenty specific areas. See Revised Stat., Ex. B, at passim.  \nCongress drafted the jurisdictional grants in the Revised Statutes with care in response to \nthe historical context of the recently concluded Civil War and the ongoing Reconstruction of \nformer Confederate states, in which a federal forum could provide recognition and protection of \nthe rights recently recognized in the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments. Where \nCongress wished to limit federal court jurisdiction in some area to cases “arising under” or \n“under” federal law, it said so clearly and definitively. For example, Congress authorized federal \ncourts to exercise jurisdiction over “all crimes and offenses cognizable under the authority of the \nUnited States,” “all cases arising under any act for the punishment of piracy,” “all suits for \npenalties and forfeitures incurred under any law of the United States,” “all suits for the recovery \nof any forfeiture or damages under section thirty-four hundred and ninety,” “all causes of action \narising under the postal laws of the United States,” “all suits at law or in equity arising under the \n \n3 The jurisdictional grants in the Revised Statutes, including those quoted here, were divided \nbetween the two intertwined systems of federal trial courts that existed in 1874: circuit courts \nand district courts. See Revised Stat., Ex. B, at 2, 5. The current system, in which circuit courts \nserve as courts of appeals and district courts serve as trial courts, did not come into existence \nuntil later. See Judicial Code of 1911, Pub. L. 61–475, 36 Stat. 1087 et seq. \n  8 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24   Filed 06/05/20   Page 10 of 23   Page ID #351\npatent or copyright laws of the United States, and “all suits and proceedings arising under section \nfifty-three hundred and forty-four.” See Revised Stat., Ex. B, at 2, 8, 9.  \nThe jurisdictional provision now codified in Section 1343(a)(3), however, was different. \nSee Revised Stat., Ex. B, at 3, 8. Unlike most other jurisdictional grants in the Revised Statutes, \nwhat is now Section 1343(a)(3) contained no limitation to suits “arising under” or “under” \nfederal law. Instead, Congress provided that federal courts would have jurisdiction over “all suits \nat law or in equity authorized by law . . . to redress the deprivation, under color of any law . . . of \nany State, of any right . . . secured by the Constitution.”4 Id. at 3 (emphasis added). Section \n1343(a)(3) therefore fell into a small group of jurisdictional grants through which Congress \ncreated room for federal courts to exercise jurisdiction over state law claims. See, e.g., id. at 8 \n(authorizing federal jurisdiction over “all suits arising under any law relating to the slave trade”).   \nThe pattern in the Revised Statutes is clear. Where Congress intended to limit a \njurisdictional grant to claims “arising under” or “under” federal law—restricting a jurisdictional \ngrant to federal claims—it knew how to do so, and did so clearly. Congress could have easily \nlimited 1343(a)(3) jurisdiction to suits “arising under” the Constitution of the United States, just \nas it did in so many other jurisdictional grants included in the very same statute. It did not. The \nlegal effect of this deliberate congressional decision is inescapable. Interpreted in “context and \nwith a view to [its] place in the overall statutory scheme,” King, 135 S. Ct. at 2489; Samantar, \n560 U.S. at 319, the jurisdiction conferred by Section 1343(a)(3) is not limited to exclusively \nclaims arising under federal law. \n \n4 The slight changes in wording seen in the modern codification of this statute did not change the \nmeaning, and are related to the 1938 abolition of any formal distinction between courts of law \nand equity in the federal system. See Rex R. Perschbacher & Deborah Bassett, The Revolution of \n1938 and Its Discontents, 61 Oᴋʟᴀ. L. Rᴇᴠ. 275, 282–83 (2008). \n  9 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24   Filed 06/05/20   Page 11 of 23   Page ID #352\nThe scope of jurisdiction provided by Section 1343(a)(3) is equally apparent when \nevaluated in the context of the modern “statutory scheme” governing original jurisdiction. King, \n135 S. Ct. at 2489. As in the Revised Statutes, modern laws conferring jurisdiction on district \ncourts usually explicitly require that the causes of action for which they confer jurisdiction arise \nunder or relate directly to the Constitution or a federal statute or rule. For example: \n•  28 U.S.C. § 1331 provides that a federal court has jurisdiction over “all civil actions \narising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States” (emphasis added). \n•  28 USC § 1343(a)(1) provides that a federal court has jurisdiction over civil actions \nregarding “any act done in furtherance of any conspiracy mentioned in section 1985 of \nTitle 42” (emphasis added). \n•  28 USC § 1343(a)(2) provides that a federal court has jurisdiction over civil actions “[t]o \nrecover damages from any person who fails to prevent or to aid in preventing any wrongs \nmentioned in section 1985 of Title 42” that the person knew of and could have prevented \n(emphasis added). \n•  28 USC 1343(a)(4) provides that a federal court has jurisdiction over civil actions “[t]o \nrecover damages or to secure equitable or other relief under any Act of Congress \nproviding for the protection of civil rights, including the right to vote” (emphasis added). \nOnce again, the plain language of Section 1343(a)(3) contains no such limitation. In keeping \nwith the basic principles of statutory construction, these differences must be treated as \nmeaningful. United States v. Heon Seok Lee, 937 F.3d 797, 816 (7th Cir. 2019) (“A material \nvariation in terms suggests a variation in meaning.”) (citations and quotation marks omitted) \n(quoting ANTONIN SCALIA AND BRYAN A. GARNER, READING LAW: THE INTERPRETATION OF \nLEGAL TEXTS 270 (2012)); see also United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 538–39 (1955) (“It \nis our duty to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.”). The words used by \nCongress mean that this Court has jurisdiction over the state-law claims at issue because Bailey \nuses those claims to seek redress for deprivations of rights secured by the U.S. Constitution.   \n  10 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24   Filed 06/05/20   Page 12 of 23   Page ID #353\nC. Section 1343(a)(3) jurisdiction over state law claims for deprivations of \nconstitutional rights under color of state law is consistent with fundamental \nconstitutional principles. \nReading Section 1343(a)(3) to grant federal courts jurisdiction over state claims brought \nfor the purpose of redressing violations of constitutional rights under color of state law does not \ntransgress the bounds of the jurisdiction Congress may bestow under Article III. As the Supreme \nCourt has ruled, “Article III ‘arising under’ jurisdiction is broader than federal question \njurisdiction under § 1331.” Verlinden B.V. v. Cent. Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, 495 (1983); \nInt’l Union Operating Eng’rs v. Ward, 563 F.3d 276, 281 (7th Cir. 2009) (“Although the \nlanguage of § 1331 is similar to that of Article III, courts have interpreted § 1331 much more \nnarrowly than its constitutional counterpart.”); Patrickson v. Dole Food Co., 251 F.3d 795, 799 \n(9th Cir. 2001) (“[A]ny federal ingredient may be sufficient to satisfy Article III”). A claim \npredicated on, and seeking redress for, the deprivation of a right guaranteed in the U.S. \nConstitution certainly has the necessary “federal ingredient.” Patrickson, 251 F.3d at 799. \nSection 1343(a)(3) is therefore constitutional under longstanding Article III jurisprudence. Id. \nD. The only federal court to squarely consider this issue determined that causes \nasserting non-federal claims and seeking to redress deprivations under color of \nState law of rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution are subject to federal \njurisdiction under Section 1343(a)(3) and may be removed to federal court. \nFederal jurisdiction over this case is confirmed by the ruling in Spaulding v. Mingo Cty. \nBd. of Educ., 897 F. Supp. 284 (S.D.W. Va. 1995). The plaintiffs in Spaulding brought an action \nin state court asserting state-law claims for “tortious acts of assault and battery, infliction of \nsevere emotional distress, negligent supervision and training, false imprisonment, \nmisrepresentation and fraud, and retaliation” in violation of state common law, violations of the \nWest Virginia Constitution, and violations of at least two West Virginia statutes. Id. at 286. The \ndefendants removed to federal court based on 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3), because the “factual \n  11 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24   Filed 06/05/20   Page 13 of 23   Page ID #354\nallegations apparent on the face of the Complaint allege, under color of state laws and \nregulations, deprivations of rights secured by the Constitution of the United States.” Id. Like \nBailey here, the plaintiffs in Spaulding objected to removal, arguing that no federal jurisdiction \nexisted because “no cause of action arising under the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United \nStates is contained in the Complaint.” Id. \nThe Spaulding court rejected plaintiffs’ argument that no federal jurisdiction existed. \nAcknowledging that a plaintiff is typically “master of his claim,” the court nevertheless \ndetermined that, in the context of removal pursuant to the court’s original jurisdiction under \nSection 1343(a)(3), “[a]n exception to this principle arises when the claim, although ostensibly \nasserted under state law, is in fact a federal law claim but by artful pleading is misrepresented in \norder to defeat defendant’s right to a federal forum.” Id. at 287–88 (internal quotation marks \nomitted). On that basis, the court reasoned:  \nthe Court looks to the substance and essence of the Complaint and finds the Plaintiffs \nhave purposely omitted reference to the Constitution of the United States, federal laws, \nand federal statutes through artful pleading. The Court concludes it has original \njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1343(a)(3) because Plaintiffs have alleged a \ndeprivation under color of state laws, statutes, and regulations of rights secured under the \nConstitution of the United States . . . . \nId. at 288–89.5 The court thus made clear that even where an asserted right or privilege may be \nconcurrently protected by the U.S. Constitution and a state constitutional or statutory provision, \nthe action is within the scope of the jurisdiction conferred by Section 1343(a)(3) where the \n \n5 The Spaulding court ultimately remanded the case based on a version of 28 U.S.C. § 1441(c) \nthat has since been revised. Compare Spaulding, 897 F. Supp. at 286 n.5 (quoting then-existing \nversion of Section 1441(c)) with 28 U.S.C. § 1441(c). Under the current version of Section \n1441(c), the court must sever claims that are not within the court’s original or supplemental \njurisdiction, but as discussed above, this requirement does not apply here where the court has \noriginal federal jurisdiction over state-law claims commenced to seek redress for deprivations \nunder color of state law for alleged violations of the U.S. Constitution. \n  12 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24   Filed 06/05/20   Page 14 of 23   Page ID #355\n“substance and essence” of a complaint is founded on allegations of a deprivation under color of \nstate law of rights secured by the U.S. Constitution.6 Precisely what Bailey did here.  \nII.  This Court has jurisdiction because Bailey seeks to redress alleged deprivations \nunder color of state law of rights secured by the United States Constitution. \n \nBailey’s pleadings and the proceedings before the State Court demonstrate that Bailey \nseeks redress for claims that the Governor, under color of state law, is depriving Bailey of rights \nsecured by the U.S. Constitution, making his state-law claims subject to federal jurisdiction \nunder Section 1343(a)(3) and properly removed pursuant to Section 1441(a).7  \nBailey cannot dispute that he is a “person” for the purposes of Section 1343(a)(3), and \nthat his complaint and amended complaint both allege the Governor took unlawful actions under \ncolor of state law. (See, e.g., ECF 1-1, Ex. A ¶ 72(E), alleging “Bailey has a right to insist \nPritzker not engage in activities designed to circumvent limitations on his authority imposed by \nthe legislature” by issuing various executive orders). The only question before the Court is \nwhether Bailey “commenced” this action “[t]o redress the deprivation, under color of any State \nlaw . . . of any right . . . secured by the Constitution of the United States,” irrespective of whether \n \n6 For it to be true that a right secured by Illinois law is automatically outside the jurisdictional \nreach of Section 1343(a)(3), the Court would have to conclude that the Illinois Constitution of \n1970 had the effect of modifying the scope of jurisdiction conferred by a federal statute passed in \n1874. But any such conclusion would violate a bedrock principle of American federalism: “the \nact of [a state] . . . cannot be permitted to prejudice the question” of the “jurisdiction of the courts \nof the union.” United States v. Peters, 9 U.S. 115, 136 (1809) (Marshall, CJ, writing for the \nmajority). Moreover, it would mean that Section 1343(a)(3) jurisdiction would vary from district \ncourt to district court, depending on the state in which each district court sits, and whether the \nstate constitution of that state protects all the rights also secured by the U.S. Constitution. Such a \nresult is absurd, and must be rejected. \n7 Under the general removal statute codified at 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a), removal is proper if the \ndistrict court has original jurisdiction over an action, as it does here.  \n  13 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24   Filed 06/05/20   Page 15 of 23   Page ID #356\nhe did so by pleading federal or state law claims. Rodriguez, 888 F.2d at 906; Spaulding, 897 F. \nSupp. at 288; 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3). The answer to that question is yes.8  \nA. Bailey’s pleadings show he commenced and continued this action to redress \ndeprivation of rights secured by the federal constitution. \nBailey’s complaint alleged that the executive order issued by the Governor on March 20, \n2020 “limit[ed] Bailey’s constitutionally protected freedoms in that it ordered him to stay at \nhome, or at his place of residence, as well as limited his ability to travel within the state.” (ECF \n1-1, Ex. E ¶ 12.) Bailey further alleged that the Governor continued to deprive him of these \n“constitutionally protected freedoms” by issuing an additional executive order on April 1, 2020, \nthat “acted to restrain Bailey within his residence, as well as limit his travel.” (Id. ¶ 19.) These \nallegations of a purported deprivation of rights secured by the federal constitution formed the \npredicate of Bailey’s claims, and Bailey’s action was unquestionably “commenced” to redress \nthose alleged deprivations. Id. \nAs discussed in the Governor’s Notice of Removal (ECF 1), Bailey’s amended complaint \nnever abandoned these alleged violations of his constitutional rights. Indeed, it expanded on \nthem. In his amended complaint, Bailey continued to seek redress for alleged violations of his \nliberty interest.9 (ECF 1-1, Ex. A, ¶¶ 105–107, seeking redress for Governor’s alleged \n“utilization of the police powers of the State” to “restrict a citizen’s . . . activities or seizing \n \n8 Bailey has on numerous occasions publicly confirmed that he commenced this suit to redress \nalleged constitutional violations. See, e.g., Rebecca Anzel, AG to appeal judge’s ruling halting \nstay-at-home order against lawmaker, PEORIA JOURNAL STAR, Apr. 28, 2020,  \nwww.pjstar.com/news/20200428/ag-to-appeal-judges-ruling-halting-stay-at-home-order-against-\nlawmaker (last visited June 5, 2020).  \n9 This “liberty interest” is secured by the U.S. Constitution. See, e.g., Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 \nU.S. 307, 315 (1982); Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 600 (1979). The Fourteenth Amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution prohibits a “state” from “depriv[ing] any person of life, liberty, or property, \nwithout due process of law[.]” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1 (emphasis added). \n  14 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24   Filed 06/05/20   Page 16 of 23   Page ID #357\ncontrol of . . . business premises”; ¶¶ 32–49, discussing quarantine procedures). Bailey also \nrepeated his allegation that the Governor has violated his right to freedom of travel. (Id. ¶¶ 105–\n07, seeking redress for Governor’s alleged actions “restrict[ing] a citizen’s movement”).  \nBailey’s amended complaint adds alleged deprivations of two additional rights or \nprivileges secured by the U.S. Constitution: Bailey’s allegation that the Governor is violating his \nright to free exercise of religion (id. ¶ 71, seeking redress for the Governor’s alleged actions \n“preventing Bailey from attending worship services”), and Bailey’s allegation that the Governor \nhas somehow seized “unilateral control over the movement and livelihood of every citizen in the \nState,” rendering the legislature “meaningless” (id. ¶¶ 84–85). These new allegations seek \nredress for an alleged violation of the First Amendment and also Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. \nConstitution, which provides that “[t]he United States shall guarantee to every State in this \nUnion a Republican Form of Government.”  \nIn sum, although Bailey assiduously removed the word “constitution” from his amended \ncomplaint, the “substance and essence” of Bailey’s action continues to be that the Governor is \nacting under color of state law to deprive him of the same constitutional rights (and more) \naddressed in his initial complaint. (ECF 1-1, Ex. A.) The DOJ itself recognizes the federal \nconstitutional predicates and implications of Bailey’s amended complaint, writing: \nIf Bailey is correct that these executive orders are wholly without authorization under \nIllinois law, then the Orders’ imposition of broad and intrusive restrictions on the people \nof Illinois would raise real questions about whether the people of Illinois have been \ndeprived of their liberties without constitutionally adequate process.  \n (ECF 15 at p. 15–19.) Because “the substance and essence” of Bailey’s complaint, like the \ncomplaint in Spaulding, alleges deprivations under color of state laws “of rights secured under \nthe Constitution of the United States,” this Court has original jurisdiction under Section \n1343(a)(3). Spaulding, 897 F. Supp. at 288–89. \n  15 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24   Filed 06/05/20   Page 17 of 23   Page ID #358\nB.  Proceedings in the State Court show that Bailey is seeking to redress alleged \ndeprivations of rights secured by the United States Constitution. \nThe State Court itself acknowledged and confirmed that Bailey commenced this action to \nredress deprivations of rights secured by the U.S. Constitution. On April 27, 2020, when the State \nCourt granted Bailey’s motion for a TRO (that Bailey then moved to vacate to avoid defending it \non appeal), the court based its ruling on irreparable harm on federal constitutional grounds, ruling \nthat “every second this Executive Order is in existence . . . the Bill of Rights is being shredded. \nThat is irreparable harm.” Ex. A, Apr. 27, 2020 Tr. at 60:17–21. In addition, the State Court found \na likelihood of success on the merits for Bailey’s claims on federal constitutional grounds, stating: \n“there is no pandemic exception to the fundamental liberties the constitution safeguards . . . . \nindividual rights secured by the constitution do not disappear during a public health crisis . . . . \nThese individual rights, including the protections in the Bill of Rights made applicable to the states \nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment, are always in force and restrain government action . . . . the \nrights of the individual in respect of his liberty may, at times, under the pressure of great dangers, \nbe subjected to such restraint . . . as the safety of the general public may demand . . . The Supreme \nCourt also has instructed courts to intervene if a statute purporting to have been enacted to protect \nthe public health or the public safety has no real or substantial relation to those objects, or is, \nbeyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law.” Id. at \n64:12–66:19.  \nThe State Court justified its ruling by noting “[t]here is a vast difference between being \nallowed to ask the federal government for disaster loans for farmers in a flood and an executive \norder that shuts down my right, my constitutional right to work, to travel, to exist . . . . [D]oes the \nGovernor have the right to shred the constitution for longer than 30 days? That’s the issue, isn't \n  16 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24   Filed 06/05/20   Page 18 of 23   Page ID #359\nit?” Id. at 39:25-40:14. The judge further stated that “there’s that pesky little thing called the \nconstitution that’s going to have to be dealt with.” Id. at 47:17–18. \nBailey plainly concurred in the State Court’s assessment of the constitutional nature of his \naction. During argument over bond, Bailey’s counsel asked “[w]hat showing would the court \nrequire for bond sufficient for my client to be able to continue with his constitutional rights . . . ?” \n(Id. at 68:5–7.) And Bailey submitted a draft TRO order, which the State Court entered without \nsubstantive revision. (ECF 1-1, Ex. B.) That order provided that Bailey had “shown he has a clearly \nascertainable right in need of immediate protection, namely his liberty interest to be free from \nPritzker’s executive order.” (Id. ¶ 5.)  \nIII.  Bailey and the DOJ’s arguments for remand are irrelevant to the issue at hand \nbecause they address federal jurisdiction under Section 1331, not Section 1343(a)(3). \nThe DOJ acknowledges that “[i]f Bailey is correct that these executive orders are wholly \nwithout authorization under Illinois law, then the Orders’ imposition of broad and intrusive \nrestrictions on the people of Illinois would raise real questions about whether the people of \nIllinois have been deprived of their liberties without constitutionally adequate process.” (ECF 15 \nat 15–19.) Despite this acknowledgment, the DOJ (and Bailey) argue the Court lacks jurisdiction \nover this case because Bailey’s claims do not allege a federal claim and do not come within the \n“slim category” of state law cases that nonetheless give rise to original jurisdiction under Section \n1331 in the federal courts because they arise under federal law. (ECF 15 at 5–6, quoting Gunn v. \nMinton, 568 U.S. 251, 258 (2013); ECF 8 at 5.) This is a strawman. The question here is not \nwhether Bailey overtly asserted a federal claim giving rise to “federal question” jurisdiction \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1331. He has not. The question is whether Bailey’s state law claims seek \nredress for violations under color of state law of rights protected by the U.S. Constitution. That \nhe has plainly done in a manner that triggers federal jurisdiction under Section 1343(a)(3). \n  17 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24   Filed 06/05/20   Page 19 of 23   Page ID #360\nBailey and the DOJ largely ignore that the Governor has invoked federal jurisdiction on \nthe basis of 28 U.S.C. §1343(a)(3), not Section 1331. With the exception of a single footnote in \nthe DOJ Statement (in which the DOJ misquotes and misstates the relevant law), not a single \ncase cited by Bailey or the DOJ relates to Section 1343(a)(3) jurisdiction. Instead, Bailey and the \nDOJ have relied entirely on cases construing the requirements of Section 1331. (ECF 7, 8, 15, \nciting Gunn v. Minton, 568 U.S. 251 (2013) (addressing § 1331 with no mention of § \n1343(a)(3)); Grable & Sons Metal Prod., Inc. v. Darue Eng'g & Mfg., 545 U.S. 308 (2005) \n(same); Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386 (1987) (same); Merrell Dow Pharm. v. \nThompson, 478 U.S. 814 (1986) (same); Webb v. Fin. Indus. Regulatory Auth., Inc., 889 F.3d \n853 (7th Cir. 2018) (same); Citadel Sec., LLC v. Chicago Bd. Options Exch., Inc., 808 F.3d 694 \n(7th Cir. 2015) (same); Hartland Lakeside Joint No. 3 Sch. Dist. v. WEA Ins. Corp., 756 F.3d \n1032 (7th Cir. 2014) (same); Manning v. Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner & Smith, 772 F.3d 158 \n(3d Cir. 2014) (same); Williams v. Aztar Indiana Gaming Corp., 351 F.3d 294 (7th Cir. 2003) \n(same); Ctr. For Wildlife Ethics, Inc. v. Clark, 325 F. Supp. 3d 911 (N.D. Ind. 2018) (same); \nKrause v. Phila. Soul, 2009 WL 1175625 (E.D. Pa. 2009).)10 \nBailey’s memorandum fails to meaningfully address the substance of Section 1343(a)(3), \nand the DOJ’s sole reference to Section 1343(a)(3) appears in a footnote on page 6 of its filing. \nIn that footnote, the DOJ attempts to limit the scope of Section 1343(a)(3) by claiming that it \nextends “‘only to rights that are granted in terms of equality and not to the whole gamut of \n \n10 Bailey’s discussion of Compagnie Francaise de Navigation a Vapeuer v. State Bd. Of Health, \n186 U.S. 380 (1902) also misses the mark (ECF 8 at 7), as it is based on the inaccurate claim that \nBailey has not argued the Governor has violated the U.S. Constitution. See disc. supra at 1–4. \nAnd neither DOJ nor Bailey can fairly dispute that Compagnie Francaise stands for the \nproposition that federal courts have jurisdiction over actions challenging alleged ultra vires \npublic health measures on the grounds that they transgress the U.S. Constitution.  \n  18 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24   Filed 06/05/20   Page 20 of 23   Page ID #361\nconstitutional rights.’” (ECF 15 at 6, n.2, quoting Chapman, 441 U.S. at 622.) There are two \nproblems with this assertion, both fatal to the DOJ’s argument.  \nFirst, the passage from Chapman that the DOJ quotes refers specifically to 28 U.S.C. § \n1443, a removal statute with language different from Section 1343(a)(3).11 Second, even if the \nChapman Court intended that its holding should extend to similar language in Section 1343, the \nholding still would not reach this case. To be sure, one category of cases encompassed by \nSection 1343(a)(3) is civil actions to redress violations of rights “secured by . . . any Act of \nCongress providing for equal rights of citizens or of all persons within the jurisdiction of the \nUnited States.” The Governor, however, has not removed on those grounds. Instead, he has \nremoved on the basis that Section 1343(a)(3) gives this Court jurisdiction over civil actions to \nredress deprivations of rights “secured by the Constitution of the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § \n1343(a)(3); see also Roberge v. Philbrook, 313 F. Supp. 608, 610 (D. Vt. 1970) (noting the “two \nseparate jurisdictional grants” under Section 1343(a)(3), one for deprivation of rights secured by \nthe constitution, and one for deprivation of rights secured by federal statutes providing for equal \nprotection). Chapman’s holdings on that score are limited to the “statutory” prong of Section \n1343(a)(3), and are not relevant to the current jurisdictional dispute.  \nThe DOJ’s conclusory, unsupported assertion that Section 1343(a)(3) is “largely defunct” \n(EDF 15 at 6 n.2) is wishful thinking. DOJ does not and cannot seriously contend that the \nremoval of the amount-in-controversy requirement from 28 U.S.C. § 1331 caused Section \n1343(a)(3) to be repealed. Section 1343(a)(3) was, after all, a central element of Congress’s \neffort to provide federal forum for the recognition and protection of the rights recently \n \n11 DOJ attempts to yoke Section 1343 to Section 1443 by describing the latter as Section \n1343(a)(3)’s “parallel removal statute.” DOJ is flat wrong. Because Section 1343(a)(3) grants \noriginal jurisdiction to federal courts, Section 1441(a) is the appropriate removal statute.  \n  19 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24   Filed 06/05/20   Page 21 of 23   Page ID #362\nrecognized in the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments following the Civil War \nand during Reconstruction. See Revised Stat., Ex. B, at passim. As the Supreme Court has held, \n“repeals by implication are not favored” and when “two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is \nthe duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to \nregard each as effective.” Maine Cmty. Health Options v. United States, 140 S. Ct. 1308, 1323 \n(2020) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). That is particularly true here, where the \njurisdictional statute in question is among the most historic Congress has ever enacted.  \nThe DOJ also cites to dicta in Myles v. United States, 416 F.3d 551, 554 (7th Cir. 2005), \nin which the court criticized the design of a form designed for prisoner-plaintiffs in Indiana.12 \nThat dicta aside, courts across the country have continued to recognize Section 1343(a)(3) as \ngood law, and a valid basis for federal jurisdiction. See, e.g., Jhagroo v. Brown, 2020 WL \n419450, *1 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (citing § 1343(a)(3) as basis for court’s jurisdiction); Willis v. \nTejeda, 2019 WL 498952, *1 (N.D. Ill. 2019) (same); Correction Officers’ Benevolent Ass'n, \nInc. v. City of New York, 415 F. Supp. 3d 464, 466–67 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (same). This Court \nshould do the same and reject Bailey’s motion to remand this case to state court. \nCONCLUSION \nFor each of these reasons, the Governor requests that the Court deny Bailey’s Emergency \nMotion To Remand. \nDated: June 5, 2020  Respectfully Submitted, \n   \nKWAME RAOUL  /s/ Thomas J. Verticchio       \nAttorney General of Illinois   \n \n12 The court criticized the form because it erroneously classified Section 1983 as a jurisdictional \nstatute, and because the court thought Section 1331 jurisdiction was most appropriate in the \ncontext of prisoner litigation.

We've got some\n2 preliminary matters before we begin. First, obviously\n3 the public is in this courtroom. To the extent that\n4 that could be viewed as contravention of our\n5 Administrative Order governing the Fourth Circuit or a\n6 violation of the Governor's stay-at-home order, I and I\n7 alone take full responsibility for any ramifications for\n8 either of those.\n9 The public has an absolute right to access to\n10 the courts and transparency. I cannot imagine anything\n11 more unjust than to deprive the citizens the right to\n12 view the process in which this court is asked to\n13 drastically potentially alter their lives. Therefore,\n14 you're here. However, you are here as directed by the\n15 sheriff of Clay County, who has done a phenomenal job\n16 preparing for this with respect to social distancing and\n17 our Fourth Circuit Administrative Order. Thank you,\n18 Sheriff.\n19 In that vein, while you're here, there will be\n20 no public outbursts, no displays. Anybody disrupting\n21 this proceeding will be removed immediately, and, at the\n22 conclusion of this hearing, you will leave as directed\n23 by the Clay County Sheriff.\n24 I'm now going to call 20-CH-6, Bailey versus\n25 Pritzker.

WURL: My name is Dan Wurl of Heyl Royster\n22 Law Firm in Champaign, Illinois, and we are serving as\n23 local counsel for the Illinois Health and Hospital\n24 Association.\n25 MR. OURTH: I'm Joe Ourth, Saul, Ewing, Arnstein\n3\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 5 of 72   Page ID #369\n1 & Lehr, on behalf of the Illinois Health and Hospital\n2 Association and on behalf of the 200 members of the\n3 hospitals who are members of the Hospital Association.\n4 THE COURT: And, for the record, you have filed\n5 an Amicus brief; is that correct?\n6 MR. WURL: That's correct, Your Honor.\n7 THE COURT: Both parties received a copy of\n8 that?\n9 MR. VERTICCHIO: Yes, Judge.\n10 MR. DeVORE: Yes, Judge. I got it on the way\n11 down here, sir.\n12 THE COURT: Any objection?\n13 MR. VERTICCHIO: None from the Governor, Your\n14 Honor.\n15 MR. DeVORE: Judge, we would have an objection\n16 at this point, especially at the proceeding of a\n17 temporary restraining order. From what I understand of\n18 looking at their document, it appears to be, and, again,\n19 reading it as we were driving down here, me not driving,\n20 of course, sir, some kind of balancing of the equities\n21 or some, something of the nature that if the court would\n22 find that the Governor's Order is beyond his authority,\n23 that that would cause some undue harm within the\n24 hospitals.\n25 To me, at this stage of the proceeding, that\n4\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 6 of 72   Page ID #370\n1 issue is not in front of the court. I believe it will\n2 cloud what otherwise is a temporary restraining order\n3 hearing on the pleadings of the parties. I believe once\n4 the court gets into this and sees some of the\n5 documentation, that it will find, that even if this\n6 court would find that the Order exceeded his authority,\n7 that there are measures already in place.\n8 So, to the extent that that would over-\n9 complicate what otherwise is a statutory construction\n10 and a constitutional issue, I don't believe that the\n11 Amicus brief provides any helpful insight at this time\n12 to the court. Thank you.\n13 MR. VERTICCHIO: May I, Your Honor?\n14 THE COURT: Yeah.\n15 MR. VERTICCHIO: On behalf of the Governor,\n16 we're here on a TRO and, as you know from the briefing,\n17 Your Honor, one of the issues that the court will\n18 consider, provided that the plaintiff meets his original\n19 four requirements, is the balancing of the harms and the\n20 hardship due upon the public in the event that the Order\n21 is entered and relief granted. It appears to me that\n22 there could be no more relevant, sadly, there could be\n23 no more relevant viewpoint for the court to consider on\n24 the balancing of the harms and damage to the public than\n25 the view of the Amicus hospital, Health and Hospital\n5\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 7 of 72   Page ID #371\n1 Association.\n2 I briefly looked at the brief and declaration\n3 attached and it bears directly upon the issue of\n4 balancing the harms and the hardship upon the public.\n5 We respectfully request that the Motion be granted.\n6 THE COURT: I will allow the filing of the\n7 Amicus brief, although you're not parties but you, of\n8 course, may observe.\n9 MR. WURL: Thank you, Your Honor.\n10 MR. VERTICCHIO: Thank you, Judge.\n11 THE COURT: All right.\n12 MR. VERTICCHIO: Then procedurally, Your Honor,\n13 I don't know how the court wants to proceed in terms of\n14 the order. We have filed a 2-615 Motion to Dismiss the\n15 Complaint. Granted it, by and large, goes to the\n16 likelihood of success on the merits.\n17 THE COURT: It does. They're intertwined.\n18 MR. VERTICCHIO: Maybe for that reason it makes\n19 sense for Mr. DeVore to present his Motion with the\n20 understanding that I will then present my 2-615 in\n21 response to the Motion for temporary restraining order\n22 if that makes sense for the court.\n23 THE COURT: Makes sense to me.\n24 MR. DeVORE: Your Honor, I would ask the\n25 court -- I agree with my colleague that the arguments\n6\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 8 of 72   Page ID #372\n1 raised in the, you know, not as much the Motion to\n2 Dismiss but in their opposition brief I will call it, it\n3 does take on the issue of likelihood of success on the\n4 merits as it relates to the temporary restraining order.\n5 If they are successful in that argument, the TRO doesn't\n6 issue, but as to the issue of the Motion --\n7 THE COURT: Anybody that's got a cell phone, if\n8 that goes off again, the sheriff is going to confiscate\n9 it and you're out of here. Go ahead.\n10 MR. DeVORE: Thank you, Your Honor. Your Honor,\n11 the Motion to Dismiss was filed and the Notice of\n12 Hearing on that Motion to Dismiss was received by our\n13 office roughly an hour ago. Local Rule 501(d) says that\n14 Notice of Hearing has to be presented to the opposing\n15 party no later than the second court date preceding the\n16 hearing. So I would ask the court merely to entertain\n17 the likelihood of success on the merits issue as it\n18 relates to the TRO and then, regardless of whether the\n19 court grants or denies, I believe the governor's Motion\n20 to Dismiss could be taken up at a later date where we\n21 can address those issues fully.\n22 MR. VERTICCHIO: Your Honor, this is an\n23 emergency proceeding. The Motion was -- the Complaint\n24 was filed on Friday. We were served with it on Friday,\n25 the Motion to Dismiss filed Monday morning. We are on\n7\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 9 of 72   Page ID #373\n1 the fast track as we all know. As a matter of fact, I\n2 received a supplemental brief last night from\n3 plaintiff's counsel, don't hold me to the precise time,\n4 but I think it was 1:05 a.m. Monday morning. There's a\n5 lot going on.\n6 It seems to me that the Motion to Dismiss is\n7 directly tied to the likelihood of success. It's the\n8 same arguments on the legal issues --\n9 THE COURT: Yeah. Basically the same argument.\n10 All right. I'm going to find I can walk and chew gum at\n11 the same time. I'm going to consider them both and the\n12 whole giant argument and we'll sort it out later. You\n13 may proceed, Petitioner.\n14 MR. DeVORE: Understood, sir. Your Honor, my\n15 client brought this cause of action under declaratory\n16 judgment and request for preliminary injunction and\n17 temporary restraining order. The temporary restraining\n18 order request is verified and it was filed in this\n19 court.\n20 As the court is aware and my colleague is aware,\n21 there's four elements that are required in order for a\n22 temporary restraining order to issue. They are a right\n23 in need of protection, they are irreparable injury, they\n24 are no adequate remedy at law, and likelihood of success\n25 on the merits. I would like to address each one of\n8\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 10 of 72   Page ID #374\n1 those individually for the court. I'm going to leave\n2 likelihood of success on the merits for last because, as\n3 the court is aware, that is one of the most complicated\n4 ones.\n5 As to the issue of right in need of protection,\n6 as was brought up briefly on, which is now in the record\n7 of the court on their request for a continuance, the\n8 right in need of protection is a liberty interest. It\n9 is a liberty interest as pled in this case of my client\n10 but it's also the same liberty interest of every citizen\n11 of this state. But as to Mr. Bailey, the liberty\n12 interest of him being ordered by the executive branch of\n13 this state to stay in his home unless he is engaged in\n14 an essential activity that the Governor's office has\n15 also defined what's essential with someone, we don't\n16 know who, and, if he does that, if he doesn't follow\n17 that order, he could be subject to some prosecution,\n18 persecution, whatever we want to call it, we don't\n19 really know, we haven't seen that yet, but ultimately\n20 some mechanism by which my client could be sanctioned\n21 for not staying at home unless it's an essential task or\n22 work or food, it's been defined by the same executive\n23 branch. That is a right in need of protection, one of\n24 which I'm not sure there could be a greater right in\n25 need of protection for this court to consider.\n9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 11 of 72   Page ID #375\n1 Now, there's been some -- I want to throw this\n2 in just briefly. There's been some response by the\n3 Governor's office that says, well, Mr. Bailey hasn't\n4 adhered to that so he's really not subject to this stay-\n5 at-home order. If my client has chosen to leave his\n6 home not for an essential task, he has, at least as we\n7 sit right now in the state of the executive order,\n8 potentially subjecting himself to punishment. That's\n9 the right in need of protection here, Judge, not whether\n10 you choose to peacefully disobey, which I would call\n11 that, the fact that the order has been issued that says\n12 if you do this, you could be subject to violation of\n13 this order. That's the right, Judge, and we would ask\n14 the court to find that that, there's really no contest\n15 that my client has raised a right in need of protection.\n16 The issue of irreparable injury is next, which\n17 is kind of coupled with that, is what injury, should\n18 this court not enter a temporary retraining order, would\n19 Mr. Bailey suffer? Again, briefly argued to this court\n20 in the motion to continue by the state, by the\n21 Governor's office was that there is no prejudice. Every\n22 day that goes by that this Executive Order has been in\n23 effect is irreparable to my client. To be told by the\n24 executive branch of this state that if he does not stay\n25 in his house, unless you leave it for a reason I say you\n10\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 12 of 72   Page ID #376\n1 can leave, every day that goes by, that is an\n2 irreplaceable violation of his liberty interest. You\n3 can't get that back.\n4 Maybe my client chose to want to go peacefully\n5 go to his neighbor's house and see how his friend's\n6 doing. I don't know what he does for a living, or what\n7 he does for entertainment, but that's a violation,\n8 Judge, and it's irreparable. You cannot get that back.\n9 So I would ask the court to find that there's really no\n10 contest as to that one.\n11 Adequate remedy at law. That's where we're at\n12 right now. The executive branch has said, and I think\n13 they've said in their response that they filed with this\n14 court, that the Governor has the constitutional power to\n15 use the police power any way he sees fit. And as we sit\n16 here today, and I'm saddened on behalf of my client and\n17 the rest of the people of this state, that the\n18 legislature has not done a thing. They haven't met\n19 since May (sic) 5th.\n20 The first proclamation of disaster was entered\n21 on March 9th. Four days before that was the last day\n22 they convened. They have not convened since. I've\n23 asked my representatives, Mr. Bailey should probably ask\n24 his, why are you not convening? We don't know. But is\n25 there a remedy in the legislature? I don't think we\n11\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 13 of 72   Page ID #377\n1 need to look to it for that, but I would just point out\n2 to the court that if, in fact, my client's case is found\n3 to have merit by this court, part of that merit is the\n4 fact that the legislature has sat by idly and watched\n5 the executive branch usurp its authority and has not\n6 done anything.\n7 So my client's only adequate remedy at law is to\n8 come to the third branch of government, which is this\n9 court, and ask them for redress. That's the only choice\n10 he has.\n11 THE COURT: But the attorney general is going to\n12 argue he does have an adequate remedy of law. It's\n13 already passed. The Governor can pass these continuing\n14 disaster proclamations every 30 days or beyond.\n15 MR. DeVORE: That's what he's going to argue.\n16 Yeah.\n17 THE COURT: You've got an adequate remedy right\n18 there.\n19 MR. DeVORE: The remedy being the executive\n20 branch?\n21 THE COURT: Yeah. That's what he's going to do.\n22 MR. DeVORE: He's going to try, I'm sure. So as\n23 to the adequate remedy at law, my client's position is\n24 for a court to find that the Governor's orders that he\n25 is issuing exceed his authority.\n12\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 14 of 72   Page ID #378\n1 THE COURT: Let's just get down to it.\n2 MR. DeVORE: Yes.\n3 THE COURT: What's your arguing is the Governor\n4 can do what he did for 30 days and that's it absent\n5 further legislative approval. Isn't that what you're\n6 saying?\n7 MR. DeVORE: Under the Illinois Emergency\n8 Management Act, yes. Under the Department of Public\n9 Health Act, I would say it's different.\n10 THE COURT: Yeah. It's vastly different there\n11 because there, Attorney General, you get a lawyer. You\n12 get judicial review. You can't do this stuff longer\n13 than 48 hours until you go to court.\n14 MR. DeVORE: That's what we're getting to. Yes,\n15 sir.\n16 THE COURT: Anyway.\n17 MR. DEVORE: Yes, sir. I agree with the court.\n18 So, again, after the adequate remedy at law, again,\n19 there is a law that we're getting to on the likelihood\n20 of success on the merits. My client has to prove to\n21 this court today, not that he can succeed on the merits,\n22 which is why I would ask the court, at least for the\n23 record, to find I still have an objection to hearing the\n24 Motion to Dismiss because my burden on the TRO today is\n25 merely likelihood of success, which is different than\n13\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 15 of 72   Page ID #379\n1 the Motion to Dismiss for stated claim, but I just want\n2 that noted, Judge.\n3 Likelihood of success on the merit, has my\n4 client put forth enough information in front of this\n5 court to say, yes, there is a chance here of some merit\n6 that he is going succeed, at what? Succeed that the\n7 Governor exceeded his authority to force him, through an\n8 Executive Order, to stay in his house.\n9 Now, what I think is interesting about this,\n10 Judge, is, in their response, the Governor takes the\n11 position that -- because we cite the Illinois Department\n12 of Public Health rules and regulations and the act that\n13 talks about isolation and quarantine. The Governor\n14 takes the position in this court that, well, telling\n15 someone to stay at home but they can leave for these\n16 reasons I said they can leave is not tantamount to a\n17 quarantine. That's some interesting mental gymnastics,\n18 Judge, and I would ask the court not to entertain that.\n19 Telling someone that they can't leave their house except\n20 for these reasons is tantamount to a quarantine. I'll\n21 get to that.\n22 Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act, 20\n23 ILCS 3305/2, the court has it, the court has read it.\n24 The language of it is not ambiguous. As my colleague on\n25 behalf of the Governor would say, he believes there's\n14\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 16 of 72   Page ID #380\n1 ambiguity so I would like to go to the statute, and I\n2 have it in front of me, and the statute, by our\n3 legislature, in Section 2, subsection (a)(2), it does\n4 intend to confer upon the Governor and upon the\n5 principal executive officer the powers provided herein.\n6 So something herein the legislature intended to grant\n7 that power to the Governor. It was a delegation of some\n8 legislative authority to the executive branch, and we\n9 have to look at see what those are.\n10 Before -- I'm going to go through the statute as\n11 it reads, Judge. The first thing before certain powers\n12 are triggered, as the court has read and the attorneys\n13 here know, we have to have a disaster. What is a\n14 disaster? The statute helps us with that. A disaster,\n15 and I'm going to parse the language because, as we all\n16 know, it's written by lawyers and there's a lot of\n17 words, but I've parsed it out, a disaster means an\n18 occurrence.\n19 THE COURT: Aren't you conceding there's a\n20 disaster?\n21 MR. DeVORE: Yes, but there's a point to make,\n22 Judge. Yes. A disaster means an occurrence, which it\n23 could include loss of life from any natural cause\n24 requiring emergency action to avert is what the language\n25 says, a public health emergency. So if the Governor\n15\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 17 of 72   Page ID #381\n1 chooses to issue a disaster proclamation under COVID-19,\n2 that's what he would look at, and he did that on\n3 March 9th. It's not been contested that I'm aware of.\n4 My client is not contesting that in this court today.\n5 That was issued on March 9th, Your Honor.\n6 If I flip to Section 6, it talks about certain\n7 powers that the Governor has about preparing plans and\n8 doing things to help keep people, you know, with other\n9 agencies, and that's not really in front of the court\n10 today, but Section 7 is where we get to, Your Honor.\n11 THE COURT: That's 30 days.\n12 MR. DeVORE: Emergency powers of the governor,\n13 and I want to parse this really close if I may, sir.\n14 And just for the court's clarification, the government\n15 has taken the position that this language is ambiguous\n16 somehow. In the event --\n17 THE COURT: Are you?\n18 MR. VERTICCHIO: Not at all, Your Honor.\n19 THE COURT: I didn't think he was either. I\n20 thought he said -- he's saying it's clear that the\n21 Governor can just issue these 30-day proclamations as\n22 long as he wants.\n23 MR. DeVORE: True, which would be an\n24 interpretation. I'm sorry, sir. Go ahead.\n25 MR. VERTICCHIO: As long as it's declared a\n16\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 18 of 72   Page ID #382\n1 disaster.\n2 THE COURT: All right.\n3 MR. DeVORE: Fair enough. Let's talk about\n4 that, Judge. In the event of a disaster as defined in\n5 Section 4, which we just went through, and I think -- I\n6 don't believe there's a dispute in this court, and I'm\n7 asking the court not to find there's a dispute, that\n8 that disaster proclamation on March 9th was COVID-19.\n9 Okay.\n10 So, in the event that disaster was proclaimed,\n11 the Governor declared a disaster exists. Upon such\n12 proclamation is the language, the Governor shall have\n13 and may exercise for a period not to exceed 30 days the\n14 following emergency powers. I'm going to go on in a\n15 lower part of the statute before I come back to the 30,\n16 Judge, because when we're talking about whether they can\n17 be, and I use the language on behalf of my client, re-\n18 energized with a new proclamation, et cetera, provided,\n19 however, that the lapse of the emergency powers shall\n20 not, as regard to any act committed within the 30 days,\n21 deprive any person of any rights they may have.\n22 So what that was saying and what the legislature\n23 is saying is, upon lapse, you still have certain rights\n24 as people. So I would ask the court to consider that\n25 the legislature obviously recognized that after 30 days\n17\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 19 of 72   Page ID #383\n1 there would be a lapse in the power at least as it\n2 relates to the disaster that was promulgated at the\n3 onset.\n4 The Governor, when he -- and, again, going\n5 through these powers, Judge, we have the power that, it\n6 seems fair to say, the Governor is trying to invoke\n7 here, to control ingress and egress to and from a\n8 disaster area, the movement of persons within the area,\n9 and the occupancy of premises therein. The Governor,\n10 again, has interpreted that language, that that means he\n11 can tell every person within the whole state to stay at\n12 home, not arguing -- I'm asking the court just to\n13 consider that in its totality. We're certainly not here\n14 today arguing that that Executive Order exceeded that\n15 language. We're arguing that it exceeded the 30 days,\n16 because I wanted to point that out to the court that\n17 there has been an interpretation that that language says\n18 you can make people stay at home.\n19 Now here's the clever part, Judge, of the\n20 March 19th order that I would ask the court to look at.\n21 The disaster proclamation of March 9th said that\n22 COVID-19, and I have it here in front of me,\n23 proclamation, the proclamation of March 9th, Your Honor,\n24 I just had to go to it, where it has all of the\n25 whereases that the court can see, based on the\n18\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 20 of 72   Page ID #384\n1 foregoing, the circumstances surrounding COVID-19\n2 constitute a public health emergency under Section 4.\n3 Then you flip to the -- he does the Executive\n4 Order, and the Executive Order refers to, and I want to\n5 point this out because my colleague, I believe from his\n6 brief, is going to come to a constitutional argument,\n7 therefore, under the Executive Order of March 20th that\n8 we're arguing about, by the powers vested in me as\n9 Governor of the State of Illinois, and pursuant to\n10 Sections 7(1), 7(2), 7(8), 7(10) and 7(12) of the\n11 Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act, 20 ILCS 3305,\n12 so that's where he cites the Emergency Management Act,\n13 and -- this is going to get a little bit interesting\n14 later, Your Honor -- and consistent with the powers in\n15 public health laws.\n16 So the Governor, in this Executive Order\n17 restraining my client in his home, says I'm doing that\n18 under the Emergency Management Act and within the powers\n19 of public health laws. And then he goes on to issue the\n20 stay-at-home order in that March 20th Executive Order.\n21 That March 20th Executive Order, Your Honor, was by, on\n22 its face, I'm going to flip back to it, on its face I\n23 believe was set to expire on the 7th of April. I want\n24 to make sure that I provide that paragraph to the court.\n25 Here it is, Judge, under first page, March 21st at 5:00\n19\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 21 of 72   Page ID #385\n1 for the remainder of the duration of the Gubernatorial\n2 Disaster Proclamation, which currently and through\n3 April 7, 2020. So this order was set to expire on\n4 April 7th.\n5 Now the Governor, when he issued the first\n6 proclamation of a disaster --\n7 MR. VERTICCHIO: Your Honor, I'm sorry, but if\n8 the record is going to reflect that counsel is quoting\n9 from the order, it doesn't say and, it says extend.\n10 MR. DeVORE: Could you clarify that, counsel?\n11 Where at?\n12 MR. VERTICCHIO: You just read it, counsel.\n13 Which currently extends through April 7th.\n14 MR. DeVORE: Okay. Currently extends through\n15 April 7th.\n16 MR. VERTICCHIO: Thank you.\n17 MR. DeVORE: Now the proclamation that was\n18 entered on March 9th, interestingly enough, Your Honor,\n19 had a 30-day time frame in the disaster proclamation.\n20 There's nothing in the statute that says disaster\n21 proclamations have a 30-day limitation. It just says\n22 you can issue a disaster proclamation. Nonetheless, the\n23 Governor put in a 30-day limitation on that\n24 proclamation. And, again, this order of March 20th that\n25 he entered ordering stay in place of my client through\n20\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 22 of 72   Page ID #386\n1 the Emergency Management Act, and presumably consistent\n2 with the powers in the public health laws, extended\n3 through April 7th.\n4 Absent some argument that this order, before\n5 April 1st when we have the new proclamation ordering my\n6 client to stay at home, would not be through the\n7 Emergency Management Act as we're here today but it\n8 could be through the public health laws because the\n9 Governor cites that as authority.\n10 Now, getting to the April 1st proclamation,\n11 Judge, is where the power being exerted by the Governor\n12 through the Emergency Management Act becomes a lot more\n13 precarious and I believe can no way be reconciled with\n14 the plain language of the statute.\n15 The Governor, in this he calls the proclamation\n16 of the COVID-19 virus a continuing disaster. He doesn't\n17 call it a new disaster. He doesn't say the disaster has\n18 migrated in one way or another. He calls it a\n19 continuing disaster, which I believe this court can say\n20 and I believe makes sense with just interpreting of\n21 language, it was the same disaster, it just was still\n22 ongoing at that point in time. Why the Governor chose\n23 to, again, put 30 days on the first disaster and have it\n24 and that proclamation and then have a new proclamation\n25 that just says, oh, yeah, it's continuing, I don't know\n21\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 23 of 72   Page ID #387\n1 why he added the temporary restraining order change.\n2 THE COURT: How about because he knew he only\n3 had a 30-day limit?\n4 MR. DeVORE: I'm going to present that to the\n5 court as probably why but, again, I'm not going to\n6 speculate on the good intentions of the Governor.\n7 So when this new proclamation gets entered on\n8 April 1st, Your Honor, saying we have a continuing\n9 disaster, a new one, we all know it's the same disaster,\n10 the Governor obviously contemporaneously with that\n11 issues another Executive Order pushing his emergency\n12 powers down another 30 days to the end of April.\n13 Now, statutory construction, I would ask the\n14 court to consider this: If the legislature of the state\n15 of Illinois intended to let the Governor have some sort\n16 of emergency power, whether that power includes making\n17 you stay at home or not, let's set that aside for a\n18 second, if you were going to let the Governor have\n19 emergency powers that extended for the duration of a\n20 disaster, they could have written that. They could have\n21 written in there that these emergency powers will last\n22 so long as the COVID-19 disaster is still a public\n23 health emergency. That would have been pretty easy.\n24 Now whether or not that exceeded their delegation of\n25 authority from a constitutional perspective, we're not\n22\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 24 of 72   Page ID #388\n1 at that today.\n2 All we're saying is they clearly, when they\n3 wrote this statute, didn't intend in any way to allow a\n4 Governor, the office of Governor, I'm not even using our\n5 current Governor's name, an office of Governor to\n6 exercise these emergency powers into perpetuity by\n7 merely bootstrapping new proclamations every 30 days for\n8 the same disaster. I mean the disaster is the disaster,\n9 and that's what the Governor, in his Emergency Manage-\n10 ment Act proclamations, is doing.\n11 THE COURT: While we're on that subject,\n12 Attorney General, the speaker of the house, Illinois\n13 house, could propose an amendment to this Emergency\n14 Management Act and grant the authority the Governor\n15 seeks in perpetuity or as long as the Governor deems\n16 there to be a disaster and he could pass that in a New\n17 York minute, couldn't he?\n18 MR. VERTICCHIO: Well, I think the speaker of\n19 the house could bring that to the floor and --\n20 THE COURT: Exactly, for which then there could\n21 be debate and an up or down vote and transparency so the\n22 citizens could see who was voting for this and who\n23 isn't. That could be done.\n24 MR. VERTICCHIO: Sure. And, Your Honor, we're\n25 here today to talk about what was done. What did the\n23\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 25 of 72   Page ID #389\n1 legislature do.\n2 THE COURT: I get that.\n3 MR. VERTICCHIO: Not what they might do.\n4 THE COURT: I'm just saying that in response to\n5 something in your brief that says if I dissolve this, or\n6 if I grant this TRO, we're going to kill millions of\n7 people. Okay. Go ahead.\n8 MR. DeVORE: Thank you very much, Your Honor.\n9 What the court just suggested -- and I understand my\n10 colleague's response that what we're here for today is\n11 what happened and not what could happen, but what could\n12 happen -- I still think the court can use that analysis\n13 of its significant time of experience to say I know what\n14 was meant by this statute and those were the things that\n15 can happen.\n16 Now, granted, if the legislature would do what\n17 the court is talking about and grant that authority in\n18 public on the floor, people see how they vote, citizens\n19 still could seek reprieve in a court saying that was an\n20 excessive delegation of legislative authority.\n21 THE COURT: That argument is for another day.\n22 MR. DeVORE: Absolutely, sir. So as it relates\n23 to the Illinois Emergency Management Act, again, Your\n24 Honor, once the order of April 1st, the Executive Order\n25 which then re-energized the 30 days of power under the\n24\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 26 of 72   Page ID #390\n1 Emergency Management Act according to the Governor by\n2 his actions, I would ask the Court to find there's a\n3 likelihood of success on the merits that there's no\n4 language in the act as it's written that supports that\n5 proposition and, as a matter of fact, as the court's\n6 aware from statutory construction, if we, as jurists in\n7 courts, interpret language of the statute that vitiates\n8 completely one of its provisions, that's not something\n9 we should do.\n10 So if the court chose and decides to say, yes,\n11 there is a proper -- again, I'm calling them serial\n12 proclamations -- they could arguably give the Governor\n13 the authority to use these emergency powers until COVID\n14 is over. I'm not even here suggesting to the court\n15 that's a good or bad idea, whether or not that best\n16 serves the people. That's all a different issue. The\n17 act can't be read to suggest that because, if it does,\n18 the words of lapse and the words that they shall not,\n19 you know, exceed 30 days, those are rendered meaning-\n20 less. They don't mean anything anymore and the\n21 emergency powers could continue forever.\n22 So as to the Emergency Management Act, that is\n23 where we believe we have presented a likelihood of\n24 success on the merits that the Governor exceeded the\n25 delegated authority granted him under the Illinois\n25\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 27 of 72   Page ID #391\n1 Emergency Management Act.\n2 The supplemental brief that we provided to the\n3 court tells, and some of the cases my colleague provided\n4 the court in response gives some history and some\n5 authority to this court that, when I read it -- I'm a\n6 50-year-old person, Judge, and I thought, man, this is a\n7 new issue. I've got to figure this out. This almost\n8 identical issue existed in the halls of our courts\n9 100 years ago as to people being ordered to stay at home\n10 and whether or not that was a proper exercise of\n11 authority. The law now has -- what I have in front of\n12 me is the Department of Public Health Act. Let me grab,\n13 Your Honor, and this is a significant issue that I hope\n14 I do service, Your Honor. This act, Your Honor, is in\n15 some of the case law, again, that my colleague cited on\n16 behalf of the Governor.\n17 This Department of Public Health Act must go\n18 back, again, at least as early as 1922 when our Supreme\n19 Court rendered an opinion that is significant. So I\n20 have the, and I've provided it to the court, 20 ILCS\n21 2305, Department of Public Health Act, and it has some\n22 language within it that I think the court should\n23 consider and it also has the Pandemic Influenza\n24 Preparedness and Response Plan. Those pieces of\n25 information, along with the cites that have been given\n26\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 28 of 72   Page ID #392\n1 in these cases, I believe the court will find, when this\n2 is over today and I'm done presenting it, that not only\n3 did the Governor exceed his authority under the Illinois\n4 Emergency Management Act, regardless of that and\n5 independent of that, he never had any authority in the\n6 first place as it relates to quarantine and isolation.\n7 He didn't have any. I would like to -- again, let me go\n8 through and get my documents here and I'm going to\n9 provide that to the court. 20 ILCS 2305, Powers. The\n10 State Department of Public Health has general\n11 supervision of the interests of the health and lives of\n12 the people of the State. Next sentence, Judge. It, the\n13 Department of Public Health, has supreme authority in\n14 matters of quarantine and isolation, and may declare and\n15 enforce quarantine and isolation when none exists.\n16 The legislature, the police making the laws, you\n17 know, police laws that they made gave that authority,\n18 not to the Governor. I mean we have two statutes here\n19 the court is considering. One I've argued he exceeded\n20 in the Emergency Management Act. There is no specific\n21 delegation of quarantine in the Emergency Management\n22 Act. It talks about how he can control the movement of\n23 people within a disaster area. I would suggest to the\n24 court that's probably not quarantine.\n25 Our legislature, exercising its police powers,\n27\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 29 of 72   Page ID #393\n1 which they have, gave that to a completely independent\n2 body. Now they're under the Governor's office, but when\n3 I get done presenting this to the court, I'm interested\n4 to see how this gets responded to by the Governor.\n5 Attached to the document that we've given you,\n6 Judge, with the statute is a copy of, and it's required\n7 by the statute, and I want to provide this to the court\n8 and pray I do it justice, to the concerns of the people\n9 of the state, maybe people in this room, that if this\n10 court finds this order to be excess of his authority\n11 that people's lives are at risk. They're not, Judge,\n12 and I would tell the court they're not because this\n13 issue has been reduced to a 120-page plan by the State\n14 Department of Public Health Pandemic Influenza\n15 Preparedness and Response Plan. It's right here for the\n16 court to see. I've got some pages of it that I want to\n17 cite. It refers to the statute and it's promulgated\n18 under the statute, and what I think the court will find\n19 interesting is that seven days before our Governor\n20 issued his first proclamation of disaster, they made\n21 some ministerial changes to this document, nothing\n22 significant. They added our new director, Miss Ezike,\n23 to it. This document was being circulated through when\n24 the COVID-19 was an issue for our country and right\n25 before the proclamation.\n28\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 30 of 72   Page ID #394\n1 The court has it there. I'm going to start\n2 where the issues that I think are relevant to the court\n3 start on about page 66. In these rules, again, Judge,\n4 which are grounded in the authority granted the\n5 Department of Public Health by our legislature who holds\n6 the police powers of this state, Restriction of Movement\n7 or Activities to Control Disease Spread. There's a\n8 whole section in here about that that the Department of\n9 Public Health has, and it talks about quarantines and it\n10 talks about the different types of quarantines.\n11 Quarantine is not effective in controlling multiple\n12 influenza outbreaks in large, and it goes on to talk\n13 about, even if quarantine on a grand scale might be\n14 effective in controlling influenza in large populations,\n15 it would damage the economy by reducing the work force.\n16 That's in their own plan.\n17 The issue of how do they enforce this.\n18 THE COURT: Are you arguing that we don't need\n19 the Executive Order to save millions of lives? If we\n20 just follow that, we're all going to be just fine. Is\n21 that what you're saying?\n22 MR. DeVORE: I'm saying that that's what this\n23 document was prepared for this issue, and I have two\n24 Supreme Court cases that took this issue on 60 and a\n25 hundred years ago that said the legislative branch and\n29\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 31 of 72   Page ID #395\n1 the Department of Public Health controls isolation and\n2 quarantine and they are better served -- I want to read\n3 some of this on the record if I could -- they are better\n4 served as a board to legislate through the delegation by\n5 the legislature to do that than one person. Our Supreme\n6 Court a hundred years ago, Judge, and I want to get to\n7 that, says that one person making these decisions is not\n8 what this country is all about and I will get to that,\n9 but what I'm saying is, yes, sir, I'm saying this 120-\n10 page document -- and you know what it says, Your Honor?\n11 It says in here that these decisions, and I called on\n12 county health departments, but the decisions of\n13 quarantine and isolation, and you know what else,\n14 closure of businesses is controlled through the\n15 legislature through the Illinois Department of Public\n16 Health down to every county health department within the\n17 102 counties that we have.\n18 That's what the law says, and it's in here and\n19 they've had it and they were inside of it making\n20 ministerial changes seven days before the proclamation\n21 was entered.\n22 THE COURT: That document, that provides right\n23 to counsel, judicial review and all of that, correct?\n24 MR. DeVORE: The plan cites the statute and the\n25 statute says, here's what it says, it says if the, and I\n30\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 32 of 72   Page ID #396\n1 can tell you, I had to go ask, communicable, that's a\n2 big word, disease nurse, Bond County is where I live,\n3 sir. There's a communicable disease nurse, and I don't\n4 want to say her name, if you were believed to have any\n5 contagious disease ever, not just COVID-19, she has the\n6 ability to go to our administrator and our administrator\n7 will then send a letter to that person, the notice. You\n8 know what, the statute requires a notice to that person\n9 that says we have determined you have this disease and\n10 we need you to either voluntarily quarantine or not and,\n11 if you don't, the board can go to our state's attorney,\n12 whose name is Dora Mann, and it says they can get an\n13 order from the judge saying you have to quarantine and\n14 giving them 48 hours to appear with counsel to be heard.\n15 That's in place, Judge. That's always been in place.\n16 THE COURT: I get that. What if, instead of\n17 COVID-19, what if this was a mutation of Ebola with a\n18 hundred percent kill rate? Isn't that what this\n19 Emergency Management Act is designed to prevent and what\n20 these Executive Orders are designed? There's no time\n21 under that act to do what you're saying. There's no\n22 time. You've got to socially isolate and shut this\n23 place down or everybody is going to die.\n24 MR. DeVORE: I agree with you 100 percent, and\n25 you know what this plan says, Judge? It says that\n31\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 33 of 72   Page ID #397\n1 decision, the legislative branch of our state has\n2 delegated that decision making to the Illinois\n3 Department of Public Health, not to the executive branch\n4 of Governor.\n5 THE COURT: But they did in the Emergency\n6 Manage- ment Act.\n7 MR. DeVORE: They're trying to say that they\n8 did. Correct. Yeah.\n9 THE COURT: All right.\n10 MR. DeVORE: And -- well, I'm going to point\n11 that out, too, Judge, because I'm interested to hear\n12 what my colleague says, is that they have now in their\n13 response said that their authority was grounded in not\n14 only the Illinois Emergency Management Act but it's\n15 grounded in the constitution. Now, I went back and\n16 looked to make sure I didn't miss anything, and in the\n17 proclamations and orders that were entered, it\n18 specifically says we have issued these orders pursuant\n19 to these sections of the Illinois Emergency Management\n20 Act and it's consistent with public health laws. It's\n21 not consistent with this public health law, Judge.\n22 It completely contradicts it. Not only does it\n23 contradict it and usurp it, it strips the fundamental\n24 due process rights away from every citizen, including\n25 Mr. Bailey. For those reasons, Judge, we believe that\n32\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 34 of 72   Page ID #398\n1 the mechanisms that are in place, they've been in place,\n2 and I want to end this -- I have one case that my\n3 colleague cited, Judge, that I would like to hand the\n4 court and I would like the record to reflect -- I want\n5 the court to appreciate -- may I, sir?\n6 THE COURT: Yeah.\n7 MR. DeVORE: That this issue -- this was a\n8 typhoid issue of 1922 I believe is when the case was\n9 issued, Judge, but this was a writ of habeas corpus to\n10 where a citizen of our state said that they were being\n11 held against their will for all intents and purposes.\n12 This was, and I'm on page 4 of 13, this lady's name was\n13 Jennie Barmore, and she filed in the court an\n14 application for writ of habeas corpus, in English that\n15 means I'm being held against my will, stating that she\n16 was unlawfully restrained of her liberty at her home in\n17 Chicago by the commissioner of health. It goes on and\n18 talks about the health of the people is unquestionably\n19 an economic asset and social blessing and the science of\n20 public health is of great importance.\n21 Now here when I get to page 6 is where this case\n22 law that I would ask the court to consider, the\n23 preservation of the public health is one of the duties\n24 devolving upon a state as a sovereign power will not be\n25 questioned. It is. The health of the people in our\n33\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 35 of 72   Page ID #399\n1 state is, it is important. Among the objects sought to\n2 be secured by governmental laws, none is more important\n3 than the preservation of the public health. The duty to\n4 preserve the public health finds ample support in the\n5 police power, which this is the part of the case I\n6 believe my, the Governor cites, which is inherent in the\n7 state, and which the state cannot surrender. That's\n8 true, too. Every state has acknowledged power to pass\n9 and enforce quarantine, health and inspection laws,\n10 quarantine, health and inspection laws to prevent the\n11 introduction of disease, et cetera, and such laws must\n12 be submitted to by individuals.\n13 So what that says, Your Honor, is that under\n14 these circumstances through the powers given to certain\n15 departments by the legislature, is that we, as citizens,\n16 sometimes may have to yield. We understand that and I\n17 think my client understands that. Generally speaking,\n18 what laws or regulations are necessary to protect public\n19 health and secure public comfort is a legislative\n20 question, and appropriate measures intended and\n21 calculated to accomplish these ends are not subject to\n22 judicial review, and what that goes on to say is that\n23 when someone eventually makes it to your court saying\n24 that they've been held in violation of their rights,\n25 this court would apply an arbitrary and capricious\n34\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 36 of 72   Page ID #400\n1 standard of whether or not they have been restrained.\n2 Next paragraph, Judge. The legislature may, in\n3 the exercise of the police power of the state, create\n4 ministerial boards, Illinois Department of Public\n5 Health, with power to prescribe rules and impose\n6 penalties for their violation and provide for the\n7 collection of such penalties.\n8 So there's been a lot of conversation that the\n9 court may have heard, well, how does a governor enforce\n10 this? That's a good question. Here's how the Illinois\n11 Department of Public Health enforces it and it's right\n12 here, the exercise of the police power is a matter\n13 resting in the discretion of the legislature or the\n14 board or tribunal to which the power is delegated and\n15 the courts will not interfere with this exercise unless\n16 it's arbitrary or capricious. This is a 1922 case,\n17 Judge, and I'm going to come to the end of something\n18 that this case says, that this court said. The\n19 legislature has granted the power to appoint a board of\n20 health and to prescribe its duties and powers. A board\n21 of health must necessarily consist of more than one\n22 person and powers. Many authorities contend that the\n23 administration of public health should be vested in an\n24 individual, and that that individual may be trained in\n25 the science of public health. This contention is based\n35\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 37 of 72   Page ID #401\n1 on the ground that this form of administration of the\n2 health laws is productive and efficient.\n3 Please bear with me, Judge. This is so\n4 important. The same argument might have been made in\n5 favor of an absolute monarchy, but the experience of the\n6 world has been that other forms of government, perhaps\n7 more cumbersome and less efficient, insure to the people\n8 a more reasonable and less arbitrary administration of\n9 the laws. Whatever may be best, legislature of Illinois\n10 has said that the public health shall be regulated and\n11 guarded by the board of health. Until the legislature\n12 grants to cities, this was a city case, the power, they\n13 must contend with the board of health. That's what this\n14 case said, Judge, a hundred years ago, and that's what\n15 I'm asking this court to say today.\n16 We have an Emergency Management Act. Does it or\n17 does it not give the Governor the power at all to\n18 quarantine people? I would say it's in -- I think the\n19 act for the Department of Public Health is clear. It\n20 says we are the supreme power. I don't know how many\n21 times I may have seen you have the supreme power. If\n22 the court is looking at these two statutes, I think it's\n23 clear to say the Department of Public Health statute is\n24 more specific.\n25 Coming back to the Illinois Emergency Manage-\n36\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 38 of 72   Page ID #402\n1 ment Act, did it grant the Governor the power to\n2 quarantine, not just save people from going into a\n3 disaster area? If we had a nuclear disaster, the\n4 Governor saying who can go in there and who can't go in\n5 there, that's important movement of people, but to take\n6 it to the point of moving a people, being quarantining\n7 the whole state, I think if the court looks at the plan\n8 that we have here, it actually says that those aren't\n9 really good ideas because it's hard to enforce and would\n10 damage the economy. Their own plan, Judge, vitiates the\n11 actions of the Governor.\n12 So I'm asking the court to say Illinois\n13 Department of Public Health Act, the legislature who\n14 holds the ultimate police power, has given that to the\n15 Board of Health. We have a mechanism in place through a\n16 120-page Pandemic Influenza Response. Every county in\n17 our state has something in place right now. That's the\n18 protection that our legislature has set up to handle\n19 these matters. The Illinois Emergency Management Act\n20 clearly gave the Governor the ability to enter some kind\n21 of orders within 30 days. He has now used a serial\n22 proclamation to try to do that. That doesn't appear to\n23 be required, or allowed by the statute itself, and, even\n24 if the court might get that far, which I'm asking it not\n25 to, that interpretation should not exceed the express\n37\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 39 of 72   Page ID #403\n1 and clear legislative mandate of the Illinois Department\n2 of Public Health. Thank you very much, sir.\n3 THE COURT: What say you, Mr. Attorney General?\n4 MR. VERTICCHIO: Thank you, Your Honor. Your\n5 Honor, the Illinois General Assembly passed the\n6 Emergency Management Agency Act and, when it did, in the\n7 introduction, here's what it said as to why the act was\n8 passed, quote, to insure the state will be prepared to\n9 and will adequately deal with any disasters, preserve\n10 the lives and property of the people of this state and\n11 protect the public peace, health and safety in the event\n12 of a disaster.\n13 Section (2)(a), the Act also grants the Governor\n14 the authority to declare by proclamation that a disaster\n15 exists and to exercise emergency powers pursuant to that\n16 disaster proclamation.\n17 THE COURT: That preamble there just said to\n18 protect property, is that right?\n19 MR. VERTICCHIO: That's one of the things.\n20 Lives, property, peace, health.\n21 THE COURT: This Executive Order is absolutely\n22 destroying people's property. It's killing them. It is\n23 keeping them from working, making a living. How is that\n24 preserving property?\n25 MR. VERTICCHIO: Well, it's a judgment to be\n38\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 40 of 72   Page ID #404\n1 made, Your Honor, and it's a judgment that's being made\n2 not only in Illinois but across the country, indeed, the\n3 world and lives --\n4 THE COURT: Well, with respect to that, how\n5 about the couple of states who never shut down in the\n6 first place? How about the states right now who are\n7 opening?\n8 MR. VERTICCHIO: And that's the judgment that\n9 the governors of those states made within their\n10 executive power. In Illinois, Governor Pritzker made a\n11 different judgment. He made a judgment that he had the\n12 right to make under the act, and what's interesting\n13 about the act and the proclamation and, in fact, the\n14 30-day successive, multiple orders is that since the\n15 decades that the act was passed, Governors Rauner,\n16 Quinn, Pritzker, have passed successive and multiple,\n17 made successive and multiple proclamations and then, on\n18 that proclamation, issued executive orders regarding the\n19 declaration of a disaster.\n20 THE COURT: Aren't you talking about flooding?\n21 MR. VERTICCHIO: Several of them were flooding,\n22 Your Honor.\n23 THE COURT: There is --\n24 MR. VERTICCHIO: One of them was H1N1.\n25 THE COURT: There is a vast difference between\n39\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 41 of 72   Page ID #405\n1 being allowed to ask the federal government for disaster\n2 loans for farmers in a flood and an executive order that\n3 shuts down my right, my constitutional right to work, to\n4 travel, to exist, isn't there?\n5 MR. VERTICCHIO: Well, excepting, Your Honor,\n6 the issue that the plaintiff brings is under this\n7 statute, does the Governor have the right to make\n8 multiple or successive declarations of a disaster and,\n9 therefore, upon that proclamation, trigger emergency\n10 powers for a period of 30 days, and the history of this\n11 act with multiple governors is yes, and now --\n12 THE COURT: Does the Governor -- does the\n13 Governor have the right to shred the constitution for\n14 longer than 30 days? That's the issue, isn't it?\n15 MR. VERTICCHIO: Well, the legislature\n16 promulgated the act and gave the Governor vast powers.\n17 THE COURT: They certainly are vast.\n18 MR. VERTICCHIO: They are. They are, and I\n19 think the key section is the one that counsel pointed\n20 out. It's Section 7. That's what we're here about\n21 today.\n22 THE COURT: I'm glad you brought that up.\n23 Section 7 says, and I'm reading it here, let me find\n24 this here, the Governor shall have and may exercise for\n25 a period not to exceed 30 days. It doesn't say you can\n40\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 42 of 72   Page ID #406\n1 do multiple declarations. It says you got 30 days to do\n2 whatever you want, even if it shreds the constitution\n3 but, after that, party over.\n4 MR. VERTICCHIO: Respectfully, Your Honor,\n5 that's not what it says.\n6 THE COURT: Please tell me what it does say.\n7 MR. VERTICCHIO: I'm going to read Section 7.\n8 Quote, Emergency Powers of the Governor. In the event\n9 of a disaster, as defined in Section 4, and we have no\n10 dispute that there is a disaster here, the Governor may,\n11 by proclamation declare that a disaster exists.\n12 Continuing, upon such proclamation, what proclamation?\n13 The proclamation that a disaster exists, upon such\n14 proclamation, the Governor shall have and may exercise\n15 for a period not to exceed 30 days the following\n16 emergency powers.\n17 So what triggers the 30 days? The proclamation.\n18 Upon such proclamation. When the Governor, under the\n19 clear reading of the act, it's the language they use,\n20 when the Governor, present tense, declares a disaster\n21 through proclamation, which he did in this case on\n22 March 9th and then again on April 1st, that declaration,\n23 through proclamation, triggers the next clause or\n24 sentence. Upon such proclamation, the Governor shall\n25 have and may exercise for a period not to exceed 30 days\n41\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 43 of 72   Page ID #407\n1 the following emergency powers. It's a clear sentence.\n2 So the triggering event is the proclamation and\n3 then the 30 days. If there's another proclamation, then\n4 there's another trigger, and, if there's another\n5 proclamation, then there's another trigger. What's the\n6 guardrail? What's the guardrail because this can't go\n7 on forever? Well, the guardrail is that the Governor is\n8 required under the act to declare a disaster.\n9 THE COURT: What's to stop him from keeping on\n10 declaring a disaster for the next five years?\n11 MR. VERTICCHIO: Cases like this, Your Honor.\n12 Cases like this. Mr. Bailey could bring a case and say\n13 his declaration of disaster was not taken in good faith,\n14 and that's the standard.\n15 THE COURT: I'm sure we'll get to that in the\n16 next lawsuit.\n17 MR. VERTICCHIO: Well, we may, but what we've\n18 heard today is we're not disputing there's a disaster\n19 and how could we? How could we dispute that? My notes\n20 for today, Your Honor, said that there's been almost\n21 42,000 cases of COVID-19 in Illinois and 1,843 deaths.\n22 I realized coming down here this morning my notes were\n23 wrong because I heard on the radio that there were 59\n24 deaths yesterday. There's a disaster.\n25 THE COURT: And zero in Clay County and zero in\n42\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 44 of 72   Page ID #408\n1 numerous other downstate counties.\n2 MR. VERTICCHIO: That's an interesting point,\n3 Your Honor, because in Jasper County right next door\n4 there's 42 cases.\n5 THE COURT: In a nursing home.\n6 MR. VERTICCHIO: In a nursing home. In Marion\n7 County, I looked last night, I think there were\n8 26 cases. So this is not -- this is not a Northern\n9 Illinois only problem because in southern counties, too,\n10 the issue exists. Jasper County, 42 cases, less than\n11 10,000 residents in the county. As a result, it suffers\n12 one of the highest per capita infection rates in\n13 Illinois. Its rates are doubling every three days.\n14 Jefferson County is one of the few to exceed\n15 Jasper. Its rates double every two and a half days.\n16 Randolph County, one of the fastest doubling rates in\n17 the state. The point is we can't really dispute it was\n18 a disaster. It is a disaster.\n19 THE COURT: With respect to these statistics\n20 you're throwing out here and all of that, isn't it true\n21 that if I die in a car wreck and I happen to test\n22 positive for COVID-19, my cause of death for purposes of\n23 what this Governor is doing is COVID-19?\n24 MR. VERTICCHIO: I don't know. I don't know how\n25 that particular method is, Your Honor.\n43\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 45 of 72   Page ID #409\n1 THE COURT: All right.\n2 MR. VERTICCHIO: So, under the act, that\n3 sentence is clear, and it's interesting to note that\n4 counsel goes on in Section 7 to read that, well, wait a\n5 minute, provided, however, that the lapse of emergency\n6 powers shall not and, therefore, the conclusion is,\n7 well, it must contemplate a lapse, but you have to read\n8 the rest of the section. The rest of the sentence makes\n9 it very clear that that clause concerns payment,\n10 reimbursement and compensation of people who contracted\n11 to provide services doing the 30-day period. It simply\n12 has nothing to do with whether the Governor has the\n13 ability to then proclaim a disaster again and then, upon\n14 such proclamation, another 30 days triggers.\n15 In our case, March 9th came and Governor\n16 Pritzker declared a disaster existed. March 20 the\n17 first Executive Order exercised the emergency powers\n18 that were to extend through April 7th as we learned,\n19 30 days from the original. Then on April 1st, present\n20 tense, declared a disaster existed thereby, upon that\n21 proclamation, was able to exercise his emergency powers\n22 through the same day Executive Order on April the 1st\n23 through April the 30th.\n24 There are no limitations in the act with regard\n25 to his ability or any governor's ability to declare\n44\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 46 of 72   Page ID #410\n1 multiple and successive proclamations, and that's what\n2 he did on March 9 and that's what he did on April 1.\n3 The act is clear and unambiguous on that issue.\n4 THE COURT: There's also nothing in the act that\n5 says you get to keep doing this every 30 days whenever\n6 you want. That ain't in there either, is it?\n7 MR. VERTICCHIO: Well, what the legislature\n8 said, the general assembly said is that, if you declare\n9 a disaster, then upon that proclamation, you've got\n10 30 days, and the guardrails again are was it a good\n11 faith exercise of the declaration of a disaster, and\n12 maybe some day there will be that case, but for today's\n13 purposes, I don't think anybody can dispute that we have\n14 a disaster and, more importantly, nobody is disputing\n15 it.\n16 Where Mr. Bailey, the plaintiff's construction\n17 gets confused is that he triggers and links the 30-day\n18 period of emergency powers to a particular disaster, but\n19 the 30-day limitation isn't linked to a particular\n20 disaster. Under the clear language of the legislature,\n21 it's linked to the proclamation of a present tense\n22 disaster.\n23 So it's pretty clear, Your Honor, that given the\n24 sequence of events, Governor Pritzker conducted the\n25 proclamation and the executive orders specifically\n45\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 47 of 72   Page ID #411\n1 within the language of the statute. Declare, then upon\n2 the declaration, 30 days emergency power. And when the\n3 statute's looked at as a whole, it's apparent that that\n4 plain language means exactly what it was intended to\n5 mean, because when you look at the limitations section\n6 of the statute, Section 3, it has no limitations on the\n7 Governor on this issue. In fact, the only mention of\n8 the Governor in Section 3 is that the act shall not be\n9 construed to constrain the Governor's ability to, quote,\n10 proclaim martial law or exercise any other powers vested\n11 in the Governor under the constitution, statutes, or\n12 common law of this state. There are no limitations on\n13 this 30-day issue.\n14 So you look further in the statute. Well, did\n15 the legislature, the general assembly put limitations on\n16 somebody else regarding this issue, this timing issue\n17 about declaring a disaster? And the answer is yes. In\n18 Section 11, the general assembly dealt with the issue of\n19 a local disaster, local disaster, and it gave local\n20 political bodies the ability and, in particular, the\n21 executive of a local subdivision, the ability to declare\n22 a disaster, but here's what it said in that regard.\n23 That the local disaster declaration, quote, this is\n24 Section 11, quote, shall not be continued or renewed for\n25 a period in excess of seven days except by or with the\n46\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 48 of 72   Page ID #412\n1 consent of the governing board of the political\n2 subdivision.\n3 In that instance, same statute, same issue, the\n4 general assembly determined we're going to confine the\n5 local subdivision to seven days unless it gets consent\n6 of the governing body of the subdivision. The precise\n7 same issue with regard to the Governor, that limitation\n8 is not there. In other words, when the legislature\n9 wanted to put a limitation on this ability to declare a\n10 disaster in terms of timing, it did. Fair inference, it\n11 didn't place that restriction on the Governor. None\n12 exists.\n13 THE COURT: Well, I get that, and for 30 days --\n14 the legislature, aren't they saying, look, we get it.\n15 You can't spend all of this time -- you've got 30 days\n16 to make this state safe and do what you've got to do,\n17 but, after that, there's that pesky little thing called\n18 the constitution that's going to have to be dealt with.\n19 MR. VERTICCHIO: Well, Your Honor, there's a\n20 couple things on that. That construction, and that's\n21 certainly Mr. Bailey's construction, that construction\n22 presumes that every disaster will either be over in\n23 30 days or the legislature is going to do something, but\n24 when passing the act, the general assembly determined\n25 that that's not the guardrail we're going to put on the\n47\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 49 of 72   Page ID #413\n1 Governor. We're not saying in this act you can only do\n2 it for 30 days and then we're going to do something.\n3 That's not what the ACT says. The general assembly,\n4 when passing the ACT, said, Governor, if you declare a\n5 disaster, the law says he has to do it in good faith,\n6 but if you declare a disaster by proclamation, upon that\n7 proclamation, you have emergency powers for 30 days.\n8 That's all it said. It could have gone on to say and,\n9 thereafter, the legislature will convene. It doesn't\n10 say that. It doesn't say that at all, but under Mr.\n11 Bailey's construction of the statute, the 30 days\n12 triggers a stop. Stop. If you do something past\n13 30 days, it's void, it's invalid, it's illegal he'll\n14 tell you.\n15 But then what? What if the general assembly\n16 isn't in a position to convene? Sometimes that could be\n17 the case. Some would argue it's the case now. The\n18 determination of the general assembly was the guard-\n19 rails would be the declaration of a disaster. In that\n20 event, if there is a present-tense disaster, the\n21 Governor declares, proclaims 30 days and, yes, it was\n22 floods, although Governor Rauner's I believe was also\n23 H1N1, multiple successive orders under the act.\n24 THE COURT: H1N1 is the flu, also, right?\n25 MR. VERTICCHIO: Certainly a virus.\n48\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 50 of 72   Page ID #414\n1 THE COURT: And that governor certainly didn't\n2 shut down the state and destroy people's lives and\n3 property for H1N1.\n4 MR. VERTICCHIO: No question about it. H1N1 is\n5 nothing -- I can't say it's nothing. It clearly was\n6 significant, but, compared to COVID-19, it's not, it's a\n7 different world.\n8 MR. DeVORE: Judge, I just want to put on the\n9 record for clarification that counsel is not giving\n10 medical professional advice.\n11 THE COURT: I get that.\n12 MR. DeVORE: Thank you.\n13 MR. VERTICCHIO: I will stipulate to that, Your\n14 Honor.\n15 MR. DeVORE: Thank you, sir.\n16 MR. VERTICCHIO: But there's legal consequence\n17 to the history of three different governors, successive,\n18 multiple executive orders, proclamations of disaster,\n19 30 days continued, another 30, another 30, and there's\n20 legal consequence of the legislature not coming in and\n21 saying, time out, you can't do that. You can't do that.\n22 Why do I say there's legal consequence?\n23 Well, we cited the case, Your Honor. It was the\n24 Pielet Brothers case. Here's what the court said: A\n25 reasonable interpretation of a statute by an agency\n49\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 51 of 72   Page ID #415\n1 charged with enforcement of that statute is entitled to\n2 great weight. Such a construction is even more\n3 persuasive if consistent, long-continued, and in\n4 conjunction with legislative acquiescence on the\n5 subject. Such acquiescence appears where the\n6 legislature, presumably aware of the administrative\n7 interpretation in question, has amended other sections\n8 of the act since that interpretation but left untouched\n9 the sections subject to the administrative\n10 interpretation, and that is precisely the situation we\n11 have here.\n12 We have multiple governors under Section 7 of\n13 the ACT making multiple or successive proclamations and,\n14 upon such proclamation, exercising emergency powers for\n15 the 30-day period. We have the legislature, the general\n16 assembly, during these several decades, on 11 separate\n17 occasions amended the act and not once did anyone in the\n18 general assembly even suggest, wait a minute, those\n19 successive and multiple declarations and proclamations,\n20 he can't do that. We need to amend the act to make this\n21 clear.\n22 The Pielet court tells us that's very persuasive\n23 evidence of acquiescence and validates the\n24 interpretation given by the Governor in this case. All\n25 of that the plaintiff ignores, disregards the plain\n50\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 52 of 72   Page ID #416\n1 language, the plain language of Section 7, adds\n2 restrictions where none exists. There are -- there's no\n3 restriction there. The one place where there is a\n4 restriction on this issue is in Section 11, and the\n5 general assembly was very clear there, and ignores those\n6 clear limitations that were placed upon the\n7 subdivisions.\n8 Mr. Bailey says, well, by permitting successive\n9 and multiple disaster proclamations, you rendered the\n10 30-day limitation meaningless. Not true. The 30-day\n11 limitation triggers upon the declaration of the disaster\n12 and then a subsequent proclamation. It has meaning\n13 because the Governor has to, at the end of the 30 days\n14 or before the 30 days, if he is under the judgment that\n15 another proclamation is in order and another declaration\n16 is required, he's under the good faith obligation to\n17 make a declaration of disaster and renew the emergency\n18 powers and that's exactly what happened here.\n19 THE COURT: Hold on. Who governs whether it's\n20 good faith? Where does the petitioner get to go to\n21 judge that?\n22 MR. VERTICCHIO: Right here, and that's a\n23 situation, Your Honor, better left in the hands of\n24 people like you. Not to suggest that it's an easy\n25 determination, but that's where it's left.\n51\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 53 of 72   Page ID #417\n1 THE COURT: For the record, I'm bound to follow\n2 the law and the law requires me to give deference to the\n3 executive branch and the legislative branch and I so do.\n4 Go ahead.\n5 MR. VERTICCHIO: Thank you, Your Honor.\n6 Finally, Your Honor, on the issue of the statutory\n7 interpretation, the interpretation pressed by the\n8 plaintiff would lead to absurd and, frankly, in this\n9 case, dangerous results because, as a result of a\n10 finding that the Governor, despite the clear language of\n11 the act, does not have the authority under the act to\n12 issue successive and multiple proclamations triggering\n13 the emergency powers, the requested relief says,\n14 therefore, after April 7th, everything that the Governor\n15 implemented through the Executive Order of April 1st is\n16 void. There's the -- and we've -- most of the executive\n17 orders are cited in the exhibits to the plaintiff's\n18 complaint. Procurement of medical supplies, personal\n19 protective equipment. There's executive orders\n20 protecting state government operations, home evictions,\n21 Department of Corrections regulations, health workers,\n22 county jails, Illinois schools, repossession of\n23 vehicles, regulation of bars and restaurants,\n24 unemployment insurance, open meetings act issues,\n25 federal funds, social distancing, protection of health,\n52\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 54 of 72   Page ID #418\n1 all of those executive orders, every one of them,\n2 according to Mr. Bailey, are void and invalid as of\n3 April 7th.\n4 THE COURT: They already happened. I mean that\n5 horse left the barn, didn't it?\n6 MR. VERTICCHIO: But what happens to the work\n7 that's being done pursuant to all of those? Everyone is\n8 now free to do what they want. Health care workers are\n9 no longer protected. The Amicus brief comes to mind,\n10 Your Honor. They're all void, and they were all taken\n11 by the Governor under the specific authority of the act\n12 to protect the health and safety of citizens, of the\n13 citizens of Illinois.\n14 MR. DeVORE: Judge, could counsel clarify\n15 whether he's referring to Section 6 or 7 as to these\n16 measures?\n17 MR. VERTICCHIO: Section 7 is the trigger. As I\n18 said, Your Honor, these restrictions have been in place\n19 now, first on March 20 then renewed based upon a new\n20 declaration on April 1st and, even with the\n21 restrictions, 42,000 cases, now almost 1900 deaths.\n22 If they are removed, if the court determines\n23 they're invalid, they're removed, things are going to\n24 get worse, things are going to get worse, and the\n25 general assembly's determination that this act was to\n53\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 55 of 72   Page ID #419\n1 protect the health and safety of the people of the state\n2 of Illinois will be frustrated.\n3 THE COURT: All they've got to do is convene and\n4 make a motion to amend this Emergency Management Act to\n5 give the Governor, not 30 days, 60, 90, 120.\n6 MR. VERTICCHIO: There's no question, Your\n7 Honor, but we're here to determine what did they already\n8 do? The legislature has already made that\n9 determination.\n10 THE COURT: I get you.\n11 MR. VERTICCHIO: So for all of those reasons,\n12 the clear construction of the act, the statutory\n13 construction rules, they all clearly land on 30 days as\n14 triggered by the proclamation, the declaration of the\n15 disaster. There was nothing, nothing about either of\n16 the proclamations, and specifically the April 1\n17 proclamation, that went afoul of the specific language\n18 of the legislature.\n19 And, beyond that, there's the constitutional\n20 issue. Counsel said to the court, well, there's no\n21 evidence in the orders that they were done pursuant to\n22 some constitutional authority in addition to the act,\n23 but I'm looking, for example, at, it's Exhibit 2 to the\n24 plaintiff's complaint, the therefore clause that counsel\n25 read part of. Therefore, quote, by the power vested in\n54\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 56 of 72   Page ID #420\n1 me as Governor of the State of Illinois and, now I'm\n2 paraphrasing, pursuant to the act and health laws, I'm\n3 invoking these emergency powers. So it's pretty clear\n4 that it was pursuant to the act and pursuant to the\n5 powers as Governor of the State of Illinois. Well,\n6 those are his constitutional powers.\n7 When you consider that he has the constitutional\n8 powers in the situation at hand, it's clear that he, he\n9 being Governor Pritzker, properly exercised those powers\n10 here for three very simple reasons. We've heard about\n11 the state's police powers. They exist under the\n12 constitution to protect public health and safety.\n13 That's a truism. Secondly, the general assembly has\n14 done nothing, nothing to restrict the Governor in the\n15 exercise of his constitutional authority to protect\n16 health and safety. As a matter of fact, we now actually\n17 in the Emergency Management Act, the general assembly\n18 specifically said the constitutional authority of the\n19 Governor is preserved. We don't seek to limit that in\n20 any way and, finally, three, also undeniable, COVID-19\n21 presents a situation of urgent circumstances that\n22 requires prompt action, and that gets to the point that\n23 you made.\n24 You said it a couple of times. There's no time.\n25 There's no time. There's no time to go to the health\n55\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 57 of 72   Page ID #421\n1 department. There's no time for everyone in this room,\n2 everyone in this county, everyone in this state to get\n3 right to counsel, have a hearing, determine whether some\n4 kind of stay at home is required. There's no time.\n5 And I know Your Honor commented upon the line in\n6 the brief about millions dying, and I think, I think I\n7 heard a snicker from the back, but it's no joke. Again,\n8 I'm driving down this morning from my home, 59 people in\n9 Illinois died yesterday. This is no joke.\n10 The constitutional --\n11 THE COURT: Counsel, I couldn't agree with you\n12 more that it's no joke and, while we're on that subject\n13 since you brought it up, at a recent press conference,\n14 this Governor was asked by a reporter what about easing\n15 restrictions in counties in Illinois that don't have\n16 COVID or don't need it, and his response was, wait for\n17 it, laughter. I agree. It ain't funny. Go ahead.\n18 MR. VERTICCHIO: Couldn't agree more, Your\n19 Honor. So the constitutional authority is also clear,\n20 and counsel read the probative language, the relevant\n21 language from the Barmore court case, among all, quote,\n22 among all of the objects sought to be secured by\n23 governmental laws, none is more important than the\n24 preservation of public health. The duty to preserve the\n25 public health finds ample support in the police power,\n56\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 58 of 72   Page ID #422\n1 which is inherent in the state. The power can't be\n2 denied and the circumstances could not be more grave and\n3 the circumstances require prompt action. As you said,\n4 Your Honor, there's no time.\n5 The Governor issued the executive orders.\n6 They're tailored to the situation, and there's nothing\n7 inconsistent in them under the statute and they are\n8 within his constitutional power.\n9 THE COURT: Hold on. When you say tailored to\n10 the situation, that's a whole different argument and a\n11 whole different standard, is it not?\n12 MR. VERTICCHIO: Well, the executive orders are\n13 certainly broad in terms of coverage.\n14 THE COURT: Broad? You could drive a Mack truck\n15 through this thing.\n16 MR. VERTICCHIO: They're broad. They're broad\n17 given the situation.\n18 THE COURT: Tailored to the situation? How in\n19 the world does me not being allowed to fish at Forbes\n20 Lake promote COVID-19 but panic buying at Walmart\n21 doesn't? That ain't tailored to nothing.\n22 MR. VERTICCHIO: If, by the question, Your\n23 Honor, you're wondering out loud whether someone will\n24 bring that lawsuit to question whether it was a good\n25 faith exercise in the finding of a disaster, I don't\n57\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 59 of 72   Page ID #423\n1 know. I don't know, but under the law and under the\n2 facts that are alleged in the Complaint, the statutory\n3 action was proper, legal within the terms of the\n4 statute. The constitutional action was proper within\n5 the constitutional authority of the Governor.\n6 For that reason, and, again, this goes to the\n7 likelihood of success requirement, but it also goes to\n8 the 2-615 Motion. There's no way, given the facts as we\n9 know them, given the facts that are already pled, that\n10 Mr. Bailey can amend the Complaint in any way to cure\n11 the situation. The statute says what it says. The\n12 Complaint should be dismissed with prejudice on the\n13 2-615 Motion, and the Motion for Temporary Restraining\n14 Order, in any event, should be denied because there's\n15 virtually no likelihood of success. There is no\n16 likelihood of success. Given the burden undertaken by\n17 the defendant in a 2-615 Motion, everything he says is\n18 accepted as true and he simply doesn't state a claim,\n19 and the TRO Motion fails for other reasons, too.\n20 Mr. Bailey was obligated, in the TRO Motion, to\n21 make a showing of irreparable harm and the showing had\n22 to be supported by facts. Here's what the Capstone case\n23 said, Your Honor, as quoted in our brief, quote, a TRO\n24 is an extraordinary remedy and the party seeking it must\n25 meet the high burden of demonstrating, through well-pled\n58\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 60 of 72   Page ID #424\n1 facts, that he is entitled to the relief sought.\n2 Continuing quote, to be considered well-pleaded, a\n3 party's factual allegations must be supported by\n4 allegations of specific facts.\n5 On the injury, not only injury, but the\n6 irreparable injury, what do we know? Not much. We\n7 don't know -- we don't know where Mr. Bailey wants to go\n8 that he's not allowed to go. Counsel made a statement,\n9 well, we haven't seen it yet. Well, respectfully,\n10 plaintiff has an obligation to plead the facts. We\n11 haven't seen it yet doesn't cut it. We know virtually\n12 nothing about an injury to Mr. Bailey because all we\n13 have in the pleading, and that's all we can have on a\n14 TRO Motion, is his conclusion.\n15 THE COURT: Are you seriously trying to argue\n16 that this Executive Order has not caused serious injury?\n17 MR. VERTICCHIO: I'm seriously trying to argue\n18 that, with regard to Darren Bailey, who, as a result of\n19 him being an elected public official, is specifically\n20 exempt from the Executive Order.\n21 THE COURT: He didn't sue as a public official.\n22 He sued as a private citizen. For all I know, he's\n23 running a non-essential business, which also, for all I\n24 know, is now bankrupt because of this Executive Order.\n25 MR. VERTICCHIO: That's the point, Your Honor.\n59\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 61 of 72   Page ID #425\n1 You said it. For all I know. We don't know. You don't\n2 know. I don't know. No one looking at this record\n3 knows. Why not? Because it's not in the Complaint.\n4 It's not in the Motion. It's not in this record\n5 anywhere. Maybe he was irreparably harmed. I don't\n6 know. You don't know. It's not in the pleadings, and\n7 the question on a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order\n8 on the harm issue is, we cited you the cases, why does\n9 this order need to issue today? What is your\n10 irreparable harm now? And the flip side, why can't this\n11 case just proceed at a pace that every other case?\n12 Pursuant to the rules of civil procedure, the case will\n13 go on. If not, what about it requires the order be\n14 issued today that so irreparably harms the plaintiff?\n15 And you said it. We don't know. That's a requirement\n16 that it was his burden to carry. He didn't carry it.\n17 THE COURT: What we do know is that every second\n18 this Executive Order is in existence, the Illinois\n19 Constitution, numerous sections of it are being violated\n20 and the Bill of Rights is being shredded. That is\n21 irreparable harm.\n22 MR. VERTICCHIO: We're here, Your Honor, not on\n23 political questions. We're here on --\n24 THE COURT: That's got nothing to do with\n25 politics.\n60\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 62 of 72   Page ID #426\n1 MR. VERTICCHIO: I mean political question in\n2 the legal sense, Your Honor, not politics. We are here\n3 on whether Mr. Bailey has carried his burden and he\n4 hasn't and, even if he did somehow convince the court\n5 that there was irreparable harm, the court then must\n6 look at the balancing of hardships and, when you look at\n7 the balancing of hardships, what damage to the public,\n8 it's laid out in our brief, Your Honor.\n9 The Executive Orders with the safeguards, the\n10 situation hopefully is getting under control, you take\n11 them all off and things are going to get worse. The\n12 public is going to be damaged.\n13 The Amicus brief, I looked at the declaration of\n14 Dr. Michael Wahl, W-a-h-l. He lays out in great detail\n15 the damage to public health care workers, hospital\n16 workers if the regulations are deemed to be void, to use\n17 the plaintiff's terminology. And so the balance of\n18 harms isn't even close. On one side of the ledger, you\n19 have what Dr. Wahl talks about and everything that's in\n20 our brief. On the other side of the ledger, you have\n21 the damage to Mr. Bailey. And as to that damage, we\n22 don't know.\n23 Finally, Your Honor, just a word about the\n24 supplemental brief and the health care issue, the\n25 Department of Public Health and the Public Health Act.\n61\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 63 of 72   Page ID #427\n1 The supplemental brief raises not only a legal theory\n2 that is not in the temporary restraining order papers, a\n3 legal theory that was raised at one o'clock this\n4 morning, but, more importantly, I think, it raises facts\n5 that are no where in the Complaint or, for that matter,\n6 anywhere in this record. There's simply no evidence,\n7 because I think there can't be, that Mr. Bailey is\n8 subject to a quarantine, a quarantine.\n9 So for that reason alone, the shifting of gears,\n10 let's talk about the health act now. It doesn't work\n11 because the pleading means something, the allegations\n12 mean something. They are not so nimble, particularly\n13 when you're asking a court to issue emergency injunctive\n14 relief, the pleadings mean something. Beyond that, the\n15 quarantine authority to the Department of Public Health\n16 is, as the act itself says, it's in our response to the\n17 supplement, Your Honor, supplements the Governor's\n18 authority under the Emergency Management Act. It's in\n19 Section 2. It doesn't limit it and, as you said,\n20 there's simply no time. Even if we had facts that were\n21 alleged that kind of at least put him within the scope\n22 of the act, there's no time to deal with every person,\n23 every case in the event of a COVID-19 pandemic. The way\n24 to deal with it is the Emergency Management Act. That's\n25 what the Governor did.\n62\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 64 of 72   Page ID #428\n1 And, finally, on this point, and it's also in\n2 the supplemental response, Your Honor, the construction\n3 Mr. Bailey wants to put upon the act trounces again upon\n4 the Governor's constitutional authority. So this\n5 supplemental argument raised early this morning, wrong\n6 on the facts and wrong on the law.\n7 Your Honor, I was talking with one of the\n8 sheriff's deputies before the hearing downstairs and I\n9 mentioned, we were just chatting, and I mentioned that\n10 these are strange times. I was right. They're strange\n11 but they're also sad. There's just a lot going on in\n12 this world and this state that's sad as a result of\n13 COVID-19. Is it sad that people have to be subject to\n14 an Executive Order like the Governor issued? Yes. Is\n15 it sad that people are getting the virus? Yes. Is it\n16 sad that people are dying? Yes. But the action taken\n17 by the Governor, consistent with the statutory\n18 authority, consistent with the constitution, and at the\n19 end of the day, Mr. Bailey didn't carry his burden on\n20 the TRO.\n21 The Governor respectfully requests, Your Honor,\n22 that the Complaint be dismissed with prejudice under\n23 2-615 and, in any event, the Motion for Temporary\n24 Restraining Order be denied. Thank you.\n25 THE COURT: Thank you for your excellent\n63\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 65 of 72   Page ID #429\n1 argument. All right. Petitioner, do you have anything\n2 else to add other than your argument that this is too\n3 much power in an individual, it's tyrannical, and the\n4 last time this happened a bunch of guys got on a boat\n5 and threw tea in the Boston Harbor?\n6 MR. DeVORE: That's exactly what I'm saying,\n7 Your Honor.\n8 THE COURT: All right. This court has\n9 considered all of the pleadings that have been filed,\n10 and I read everything that's been filed, including the\n11 Amicus brief.\n12 The court is guided by, among other things, the\n13 following: There is no pandemic exception to the\n14 fundamental liberties the constitution safeguards.\n15 Indeed, individual rights secured by the constitution do\n16 not disappear during a public health crisis. That's In\n17 Re: Abbott, A-b-b-o-t-t, Federal 3d, 2020 West Law\n18 1685929. That's a Fifth Circuit appellate opinion.\n19 These individual rights, including the\n20 protections in the Bill of Rights made applicable to the\n21 states through the Fourteenth Amendment, are always in\n22 force and restrain government action. At the same time,\n23 the constitution does not hobble government from taking\n24 necessary temporary measures to meet a genuine\n25 emergency. According to our United States Supreme\n64\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 66 of 72   Page ID #430\n1 Court, in every well-ordered society charged with the\n2 duty of preserving, conserving the safety its members,\n3 the rights of the individual in respect of his liberty\n4 may, at times, under the pressure of great dangers, be\n5 subjected to such restraint, to be enforced by\n6 reasonable regulations, as the safety of the general\n7 public may demand, and that is the Jacobson case which\n8 was also cited by the Attorney General.\n9 The settled rule from Jacobson, the Fifth\n10 Circuit recently explained, allows the state to\n11 restrict, for example, one's right to peaceably\n12 assemble, to publicly worship, to travel, and even to\n13 leave one's home. Courts owe substantial deference to\n14 government actions, particularly when exercised by\n15 states and localities under their police powers during a\n16 bona fide emergency.\n17 The Supreme Court also has instructed courts to\n18 intervene if a statute purporting to have been enacted\n19 to protect the public health or the public safety has no\n20 real or substantial relation to those objects, or is,\n21 beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of\n22 rights secured by the fundamental law. That is also a\n23 quote from Jacobson.\n24 Courts reviewing a challenge to a measure\n25 responding to the society-threatening epidemic of\n65\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 67 of 72   Page ID #431\n1 COVID-19 should be vigilant to protect against clear\n2 invasions of constitutional rights while ensuring they\n3 do not second-guess the wisdom or efficacy of the\n4 measures enacted by the democratic branches of\n5 government, on the advice of public health experts.\n6 Fifth Amendment of the United States\n7 Constitution states no person shall be deprived of life,\n8 liberty or property without due process of law. Our\n9 Illinois Constitution states in Section 2 no person\n10 shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without\n11 due process of law.\n12 The issue before me now, in essence, is not\n13 whether the legislature can authorize the Governor to\n14 ignore the Illinois and United States Constitutions.\n15 They did it in the Emergency Management Act. The issue\n16 before me now is whether the Governor can ignore the\n17 Illinois and United States Constitutions for more than\n18 30 days. This court rules that the answer to that\n19 question is a resounding no. Accordingly, the\n20 petitioner's request for a TRO is granted. The Motion\n21 to Dismiss under Section 2-615 is denied.\n22 Now, Petitioner, you submitted a proposed order.\n23 In that proposed order you state TRO extends for ten\n24 days. That's the part about your argument I disagree.\n25 You asked for this. You issued this. You did this with\n66\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 68 of 72   Page ID #432\n1 notice, not without notice. Therefore, the ten-day rule\n2 doesn't apply. However, that said, this TRO that\n3 extends for a lengthy period of time, in essence becomes\n4 a preliminary injunction and this ain't no preliminary\n5 injunction yet. Therefore, I'll let you go beyond ten\n6 days but not beyond 30, otherwise, I'm entering a\n7 preliminary injunction without procedural process rights\n8 required for a preliminary injunction. So pick a date\n9 while we're here with Madam Clerk for a hearing on a\n10 preliminary injunction.\n11 MR. VERTICCHIO: Can I address the court?\n12 THE COURT: Yes.\n13 MR. VERTICCHIO: Your Honor, given your ruling,\n14 this dovetails into the preliminary injunction issue,\n15 the Governor requests that the ruling be stayed.\n16 THE COURT: I will absolutely deny that request.\n17 This ruling takes effect right this second.\n18 MR. VERTICCHIO: Can I raise the issue of bond,\n19 Your Honor?\n20 THE COURT: There is no requirement for bond.\n21 Statute doesn't mandate it. There's no reason for one.\n22 There's no money that's going to be required to be\n23 refunded or returned. I don't see any reason for bond\n24 whatsoever.\n25 MR. VERTICCHIO: Well, the case law provides\n67\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 69 of 72   Page ID #433\n1 that the plaintiff is obligated to make a showing as to\n2 why the court properly exercises its discretion in\n3 issuing no bond.\n4 THE COURT: Want to make that showing?\n5 MR. DeVORE: What showing would the court\n6 require for bond sufficient for my client to be able to\n7 continue with his constitutional rights, Your Honor?\n8 THE COURT: Well, I'm not sure either. I'm not\n9 going to require bond. Anything else, AG?\n10 MR. VERTICCHIO: No, Your Honor. In terms of\n11 scheduling, can Tom and I just talk a little bit off the\n12 record and let you know?\n13 THE COURT: Absolutely. Yes.\n14 MR. VERTICCHIO: Can I suggest maybe a status\n15 hearing for a week from today?\n16 THE COURT: Whatever -- however you want to\n17 proceed is fine with me.\n18 MR. VERTICCHIO: Why don't we confer with one\n19 another, then we'll let you know within a matter of\n20 minutes.\n21 THE COURT: Would you rather do it that way?\n22 You two can get, discuss the matter between yourselves\n23 and you with the clerk can come up with a new date. Is\n24 that agreeable?\n25 MR. VERTICCHIO: That's agreeable.\n68\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 70 of 72   Page ID #434\n1 MR. DeVORE: Yes, sir.\n2 MR. VERTICCHIO: Your Honor, am I to understand\n3 that the order being entered, save for the ten-day\n4 issue, is the one that was submitted?\n5 THE COURT: It is. Have you got that? I've got\n6 it, but I want you to cross out that ten-day deal.\n7 MR. DeVORE: Yes, sir.\n8 MR. VERTICCHIO: I would like to take the order\n9 if the court is going to enter it today if that's\n10 possible.\n11 THE COURT: Yes. I think you should. Take out\n12 that ten-day deal and put for the future date to be\n13 determined by counsel after consultation with the\n14 circuit clerk.\n15 MR. DeVORE: Not to exceed 30 days?\n16 THE COURT: Yes.\n17 MR. DeVORE: Got it. Thank you, sir.\n18 THE COURT: I will enter that right now after\n19 you make that amendment.\n20 MR. DeVORE: Yes, sir.\n21 MR. VERTICCHIO: I'm sure we'll be able to work\n22 a date out, but, if not, we'll get your guidance.\n23 THE COURT: Yeah. If you can't, let me know.\n24 MR. DeVORE: Yes, sir. May I approach, Judge?\n25 MR. VERTICCHIO: Can I see it, Tom? Your Honor,\n69\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 71 of 72   Page ID #435\n1 I mentioned the other day on the phone the plaintiff's\n2 Motion was captioned as both TRO and preliminary\n3 injunction. Is it fair to assume, counsel, that we'll\n4 be proceeding on that Motion?\n5 MR. DeVORE: On the prelim? Yes, sir.\n6 MR. VERTICCHIO: In other words, there's not\n7 going to be another filing.\n8 MR. DeVORE: Correct.\n9 THE COURT: Anything further on behalf of either\n10 party?\n11 MR. DeVORE: No, sir. Thank you, Judge.\n12 THE COURT: All right. Ladies and gentlemen, I\n13 would direct you to exit the courtroom and/or building\n14 as directed by the sheriff. We're adjourned.\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n70\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-1   Filed 06/05/20   Page 72 of 72   Page ID #436\n1 CERTIFIED SHORTHAND REPORTER'S CERTIFICATION\n2 I, LORI SIMS, Certified Shorthand Reporter for\n3 the Circuit Court of Clay County, Fourth Judicial\n4 Circuit of Illinois, do hereby certify that I reported\n5 in machine shorthand the proceedings had on the hearing\n6 in the above entitled cause; that I thereafter caused\n7 the foregoing to be transcribed into typewriting, which\n8 I hereby certify to be a true and accurate transcript of\n9 the proceedings had before the Honorable MICHAEL D.\n10 McHANEY, Judge of said Court.\n11 Dated this th day of April, 2020.\n12\n13 _____________________________\nLori Sims\n14 Official Court Reporter\nCSR #084-003424\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n71\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-2   Filed 06/05/20   Page 1 of 17   Page ID #437\n \n \n \nExhibit B \n   \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-2   Filed 06/05/20   Page 2 of 17   Page ID #438\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-2   Filed 06/05/20   Page 3 of 17   Page ID #439\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-2   Filed 06/05/20   Page 4 of 17   Page ID #440\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-2   Filed 06/05/20   Page 5 of 17   Page ID #441\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-2   Filed 06/05/20   Page 6 of 17   Page ID #442\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-2   Filed 06/05/20   Page 7 of 17   Page ID #443\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-2   Filed 06/05/20   Page 8 of 17   Page ID #444\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-2   Filed 06/05/20   Page 9 of 17   Page ID #445\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-2   Filed 06/05/20   Page 10 of 17   Page ID #446\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-2   Filed 06/05/20   Page 11 of 17   Page ID #447\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-2   Filed 06/05/20   Page 12 of 17   Page ID #448\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-2   Filed 06/05/20   Page 13 of 17   Page ID #449\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-2   Filed 06/05/20   Page 14 of 17   Page ID #450\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-2   Filed 06/05/20   Page 15 of 17   Page ID #451\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-2   Filed 06/05/20   Page 16 of 17   Page ID #452\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 24-2   Filed 06/05/20   Page 17 of 17   Page ID #453",

DeVore, Erik Hyam, and DeVore Law Offices, LLC, and for his \nMotion for Summary Judgment pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/2-1005 against the Defendant, Governor \nJay Robert Pritzker (hereinafter referred to as “Pritzker”), in his official capacity, and hereby states \nas follows: \nPROCEDURAL AND LEGAL STANDARD \nAS TO A SUMMARY JUDGMENT REQUEST \n \n1.  Any time after the opposite party has appeared or after the time within which he or she is \nrequired to appear has expired, a plaintiff may move, with or without supporting affidavits, \nfor a summary judgment in his or her favor for all or any part of the relief sought.  (See \n735 ILCS 5/2-1005 (a).)  \n2.  The judgment sought shall be rendered without delay if the pleadings, depositions, and \nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue \nas to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of \nlaw.  (See 735 ILCS 5/2-1005 (c).) \n  1 \n\n3.  Summary judgment is properly granted if the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on \nfile, together with any affidavits, show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and \nthat the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  State Farm Mutual \nAutomobile Insurance Co. v. Collins, 258 Ill.App.3d 1, 629 N.E.2d 762, 763, 196 Ill.Dec. \n217 (1st Dist. 1994). \n4.  Summary judgment “is an important tool in the administration of justice; its use in a proper \ncase is to be encouraged and its benefits inure not only to the litigants…but to the \ncommunity in avoiding congestion of trial calendars and the expenses of unnecessary trial.”  \nKimbrough v. Jewel Cos., 92 Ill.App.3d 813, 416 N.E.2d 328, 333, 48 Ill. Dec. 297 (1st \nDist. 1981). \n5.  There are no issues of material fact in this cause and the pertinent facts to this matter can \nbe found in the public records all of which are attached as exhibits in this cause.   \nREQUEST FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nAS TO COUNT I OF THE FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n6.  In the event of a disaster, as defined in Section 4 of the Illinois Emergency Management \nAgency Act (“IEMAA”), the Governor may by proclamation declare that a disaster exists.  \n(See 20 ILCS 3305/7.) \n7.  On March 09, 2020, Pritzker entered his first disaster proclamation (“Proclamation #1”) \nregarding the COVID-19 virus.  (See Exhibit 1 attached to the Complaint.)  \n8.  Proclamation #1 found COVID-19 to be a public health emergency under Section 4 of the \nIEMAA.  (See whereas #15 of Proclamation #1.)  \n9.  Pritzker stated in Proclamation #1, he issued the proclamation pursuant to the authority \ngranted him under the IEMAA.   \n  2 \n\n10.  Notwithstanding there being no provision in the IEMAA requiring the inclusion of an \nexpiration date, Pritzker set Proclamation #1 to expire 30 days from issuance.  \n11.  On April 01, 2020, Pritzker issued his second disaster proclamation (“Proclamation #2”) \nregarding the COVID-19 virus.  (See Exhibit 2 attached to the Complaint.)  \n12.  Pritzker stated in Proclamation #2, he issued the proclamation pursuant to the authority \ngranted him under the IEMAA.   \n13.  In Proclamation #2, Pritzker states: “based on the foregoing, the circumstances surrounding \nCOVID-19 constitute a continuing public health emergency under Section 4 of the Illinois \nEmergency Management Agency Act.”  (See 15th whereas clause of Proclamation #2.)  \n(Emphasis Added.)  \n14.  Notwithstanding  there  is  no  provision  in  the  IEMAA  requiring  the  inclusion  of  an \nexpiration date, Pritzker set Proclamation #2 to expire 30 days from issuance.  \n15.  On  April  30,  2020,  Pritzker  issued  his  third  and  most  recent  disaster  proclamation \n(“Proclamation #3”) regarding the COVID-19 virus.  (See Exhibit 3 attached to the \nComplaint.)  \n16.  Pritzker stated in Proclamation #3, he issued the proclamation pursuant to the authority \ngranted him under the IEMAA.   \n17.  In  Proclamation  #3,  Pritzker  acknowledges  “the  current  circumstances  in  Illinois \nsurrounding the spread of COVID-19 constitute an epidemic emergency and a public health \nemergency under section 4 of the IEMAA.”  (See whereas clause 52 in Proclamation #3.)  \n(Emphasis Added.)  \n18.  As a product of COVID#3, Pritzker issued Executive Order 2020-32 (hereinafter “EO \n32”).  (See Exhibit 4 attached to the Complaint.) \n  3 \n\n19.  Section 4 of the IEMAA defines a disaster as follows:  \n“Disaster” means an occurrence or threat of widespread or severe damage, injury \nor loss of life or property resulting from any natural or technological cause, \nincluding  but  not  limited  to  fire,  flood,  earthquake,  wind,  storm,  hazardous \nmaterials spill or other water contamination requiring emergency action to avert \ndanger or damage, epidemic, air contamination, blight, extended periods of severe \nand inclement weather, drought, infestation, critical shortages of essential fuels and \nenergy,  explosion,  riot,  hostile  military  or  paramilitary  action,  public  health \nemergencies, or acts of domestic terrorism.  (See 20 ILCS 3305/4. Emphasis \nAdded.) \n \n20.  An express requisite for Pritzker to have authority to issue a disaster proclamation under \nthe IEMAA is the existence of an ‘occurrence or threat’, and the occurrence or threat \nrequires emergency action to avert, inter alia, a public health emergency. \n21.  Pritzker expressly acknowledges in Proclamation #2 that a public health emergency existed \nprior to April 01, 2020, and that public health emergency was the very same COVID-19 \nwhich was the genesis of Proclamation #1 on March 09, 2020, so by clear definition of \nwhat constitutes a disaster under Section 4 of the IEMAA, an ‘occurrence or threat’ for \nissuing Proclamation #2 did not lie.  \n22.  As  of  April  01,  2020,  the  only  occurrence  existing  which  required  the  issuance  of \nProclamation #2 regarding COVID-19 was Pritzker’s arbitrary 30-day deadline he placed \nin Proclamation #1.  \n23.  On April 01, 2020, Pritzker did not require emergency powers to avert a public health \nemergency caused by COVID-19 given he acknowledged in Proclamation #2 an extant \npublic health emergency had existed since March 09, 2020. \n24.  Also, Pritzker expressly acknowledges in Proclamation #3 the disaster which existed on \nApril 30, 2020 was the same disaster which existed on March 09, 2020, all being due to \nthe same COVID-19 virus.  \n  4 \n\n25.  As  of  April  30,  2020,  the  only  occurrence  existing  which  required  the  issuance  of \nProclamation #3 regarding COVID-19 was Pritzker’s arbitrary 30-day deadline he had \nplaced in Proclamation #2.  \n26.  Until such time as the legislature defines an allowable “occurrence” under Section 4 of the \nIEMAA to be an arbitrary deadline which artificially terminated an otherwise allowable \ndisaster proclamation, such an occurrence does not fit the definition of a disaster under the \nlaw.  \n27.  Given no disaster existed as defined by Section 4 of the IEMAA, Pritzker had no authority \nto  issue  Proclamation  #2  and/or  Proclamation  #3  for  the  purpose  of  triggering  the \nemergency powers of Section 7 of the IEMAA. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Darren Bailey, herein request that this court enter an Order \nentering judgment in his favor against the Defendant for the following relief: \nA.  declaring Pritzker admitted in Proclamation #2 that the disaster which existed on \nApril 01, 2020 was the same disaster which existed on March 09, 2020; \nB.  declaring Pritzker admitted in Proclamation #3 that the disaster which existed on \nApril 30, 2020 was the same disaster which existed on March 09, 2020; \nC.  declaring that Section 4 of the IEMAA defines a disaster exists only when a threat \nor occurrence requires emergency powers to avert, inter alia, a public health \nemergency; \nD.  declaring the arbitrary deadlines placed in prior proclamations fail to be allowable \noccurrences  under  Section  4  of  the  IEMAA  to  authorize  the  issuance  of \nProclamation #3.    \n  5 \n\nE.  finding Proclamation #3 is void ab initio as no threat or occurrence existed on that \ndate as defined in Section 4 of the IEMAA; \nF.  finding that any emergency powers under Section 7 of the IEMAA which were \ninvoked in EO 32 by authority are null and void ab initio;  \nG.  Awarding Bailey his costs incurred in this matter as may be allowed by law;  \nH.  That the Court grant such other and further relief as is just and proper. \n \nREQUEST FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nAS TO COUNT II OF THE FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n28.  On March 09, 2020, Pritzker issued a Proclamation #1 declaring, as of that date, a disaster \nexisted within Illinois as a result of the COVID-19 virus.  (See Exhibit 1 attached to the \nComplaint.)  \n29.  COVID#1 was proclaimed in response to COVID-19 which Pritzker defines as a novel \nsevere acute respiratory illness.  (See 2nd whereas clause of Proclamation #1.)  \n30.  Pritzker’s Proclamation #1 remained in effect for only 30 days due to its express terms.  \n(See Section 11 of Proclamation #1.)  \n31.  The IEMAA contains no provision which states Proclamation #1 must have provided a \nlimit on its period of effectiveness.   \n32.  On April 01, 2020, Pritzker issued Proclamation #2 regarding COVID-19. (See Exhibit 2 \nattached to the Compliant.)  \n33.  In Proclamation #2, Pritzker states the COVID-19 virus is a novel severe acute respiratory \nillness. (See 1st whereas clause of Proclamation #2) \n  6 \n\n34.  Given Pritzker declared Proclamation #2 a continuing disaster, Pritzker further declared a \ncontinuation of his authority to wield the emergency powers of section 7 of the IEMAA.  \n(See Section 1 of Proclamation #2.) \n35.  Pritzker’s Proclamation #2 remained in effect for only 30 days due to its express terms.  \n(See Section 12 of Proclamation #2.)  \n36.  The IEMAA contains no provision which states Proclamation #2 must have provided a \nlimit on its period of effectiveness.   \n37.  On April 30, 2020, Pritzker issued Proclamation #3 regarding COVID-19.  (See Exhibit 3 \nattached to the Complaint.)  \n38.  In Proclamation #3, Pritzker states the COVID-19 virus is a novel severe acute respiratory \nillness.  (See 3rd whereas clause of Proclamation #3.) \n39.  Pritzker’s  Proclamation  #3  is  to  remain  in  effect  for  30  days.    (See  Section  12  of \nProclamation #3.)  \n40.  The IEMAA contains no provision which states Proclamation #3 must provide a limit on \nits period of effectiveness.   \n41.  Given Pritzker declared Proclamation #3 a disaster, Pritzker further declares his authority \nto wield the emergency powers of section 7 of the IEMAA.  (See Section 1 of Proclamation \n#2.) \n42.  Pritzker’s  Proclamation  #3  is  to  remain  in  effect  for  30  days.    (See  Section  12  of \nProclamation #3.)  \n43.  As a result of Proclamation #3, Pritzker issued Executive Order 2020-32 (hereinafter “EO \n32”).  (See Exhibit 4 attached to the Complaint.)  \n  7 \n\n44.  In EO 32, Pritzker cites subsections 7(1), 7(2), 7(3), 7(8), 7(9) and 7(12) of Section 7 of \nthe IEMAA as authority to exercise emergency powers.   \n45.  Upon a proclamation of disaster, the Governor shall have and may exercise for a period \nnot to exceed 30 days certain enumerated emergency powers.  (See 20 ILCS 3305/7.) \n46.  Section 4 of the IEMAA defines a disaster as follows:  \n“Disaster” means an occurrence or threat of widespread or severe damage, injury \nor loss of life or property resulting from any natural or technological cause, \nincluding  but  not  limited  to  fire,  flood,  earthquake,  wind,  storm,  hazardous \nmaterials spill or other water contamination requiring emergency action to avert \ndanger or damage, epidemic, air contamination, blight, extended periods of severe \nand inclement weather, drought, infestation, critical shortages of essential fuels and \nenergy,  explosion,  riot,  hostile  military  or  paramilitary  action,  public  health \nemergencies, or acts of domestic terrorism.  (See 20 ILCS 3305/4.) \n \n47.  The very “occurrence or threat” for which Pritzker found a disaster existed in Proclamation \n#2 and Proclamation #3 is the exact same ‘occurrence or threat, for which a disaster was \ndeclared in Proclamation #1. \n48.  The novel severe acute respiratory virus, being COVID-19, was the exact ‘occurrence or \nthreat’ in each of the three disaster proclamations.  \n49.  The only reason Proclamation #2 and Proclamation #3 issued was due to the arbitrary 30-\nday termination provision Pritzker placed in each of the disaster proclamations.   \n50.  The IEMAA is clear a Governor shall have and may exercise the emergency powers for a \nperiod not to exceed 30 days from the date of a proclamation of a disaster.  \n51.  The serial proclamations, being Proclamation #1, Proclamation #2 and Proclamation #3 \nwere a product of the exact same “occurrence or threat” which gave rise to a disaster being \ndeclared in Proclamation #1.   \n  8 \n\n52.  It should be readily apparent to this Honorable Court that Pritzker issued Proclamation #2 \nand Proclamation #3 for the sole purpose of triggering the reanimation of the emergency \npowers of Section 7 of the IEMAA. \n53.  The Attorney General’s Office acknowledged this scheme in this Honorable Court on April \n27, 2020.  \n54.  Pritzker’s arbitrary 30-day disaster proclamations, as to the expression provisions to trigger \nthe emergency powers provisions, are ultra vires efforts and beyond the powers of Section \n7 authorized by the legislature in the IEMAA.  \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Darren Bailey, herein requests that this court enter an Order: \nA) declaring Pritzker issued Proclamation #2 and Proclamation #3 for the same occurrence or \nthreat which gave rise to the issuance of Proclamation #1 on March 09, 2020; \nB) declaring the 30-days of emergency powers provided under Section 7 of the IEMAA \nprovided to the Governor to address the COVID-19 lapsed on April 08, 2020;  \nC) declaring any provision within Proclamation #2 and Proclamation #3 triggering a reset of \nthe 30-day emergency powers under Section 7 of the IEMAA be invalid;  \nD) declaring any executive orders finding their authority under the emergency powers of \nSection 7 of the IEMAA are void ab initio subsequent to April 08, 2020;  \nE)  Awarding Bailey his costs incurred in this matter as may be allowed by law;  \nF)  That the Court grant such other and further relief as is just and proper. \nREQUEST FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nAS TO COUNT III OF THE FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n55.  Section 7 of the IEMAA expressly states: “Upon such proclamation, the Governor shall \nhave and may exercise for a period not to exceed 30 days the following emergency \npowers…”  (See 20 ILCS 3305/7.)  \n  9 \n\n56.  As a result of Proclamation #3, Pritzker issued Executive Order 2020-32 (hereinafter “EO \n32”).   \n57.  Section 2, Part 1, of EO 32, ordered all citizens of the state of Illinois to stay at home, or at \ntheir place of residence, except as allowed by EO 32. (See the referenced provision of EO \n32.)  \n58.  This  stay  at  home  provision  practically  separated  and  restricted  the  movement  and \nactivities of all citizens of this state, whether they be ill or not.  \n59.  As it relates to citizens, EO 32 states “the intent of the executive order is to ensure that the \nmaximum number of people self-isolate in the places of residence…”  (See section 16 of \nEO 32.)  \n60.  Section 2, Part 2, of EO 32, ordered all “non-essential” businesses cease all activity, except \nfor minimum basis operations. (See the referenced provision of EO 32.)  \n61.  As alleged authority to issue EO 32, Pritzker relies on two sources:  \na)  Powers vested in him as the Governor of the State of Illinois; and,  \nb)  Sections 7(1), 7(2), 7(3), 7(8), 7(9) and 7(12) of the IEMAA.  \n(See the “THEREFORE” clause on page 2 of EO 32)  \n62.  In regard to Pritzker’s powers vested in him by the Illinois Constitution, he states: \n“whereas, the Illinois Constitution, in Article V, Section 8, provides that the governor shall \nhave the supreme executive power, and shall be responsible for the faithful execution of \nthe laws, and states in the Preamble, that a central purpose of the Illinois Constitution is to \nprovide for the health, and welfare of the people”  (See 2nd to last whereas clause of EO \n32.)  \n63.  The following provisions of the IEMAA are also cited as authority.   \n  10 \n\n64.  Section 7(1) states:  \n(1) To suspend the provisions of any regulatory statute prescribing procedures for conduct \nof State business, or the orders, rules and regulations of any State agency, if strict \ncompliance with the provisions of any statute, order, rule, or regulation would in any way \nprevent, hinder or delay necessary action, including emergency purchases, by the Illinois \nEmergency Management Agency, in coping with the disaster. (See 20 ILCS 3305/7(1).) \n65.  Section 7(2) states:  \n(2) To utilize all available resources of the State government as reasonably necessary to \ncope with the disaster and of each political subdivision of the State. (See 20 ILCS \n3305/7(2).) \n66.  Section 7(3) states:  \n(3) To transfer the direction, personnel or functions of State departments and agencies or \nunits thereof for the purpose of performing or facilitating disaster response and recovery \nprograms. (See 20 ILCS 3305/7(3).) \n67.  Section 7(8) states:  \n(8) To control ingress and egress to and from a disaster area, the movement of persons \nwithin the area, and the occupancy of premises therein. (See 20 ILCS 3305/7(8).) \n68.  Section 7(9) states:  \n(9) To suspend or limit the sale, dispensing, or transportation of alcoholic beverages, \nfirearms, explosives, and combustibles. (See 20 ILCS 3305/7 (9).) \n69.  Section 7(12) states:  \n(12) Control, restrict, and regulate by rationing, freezing, use of quotas, prohibitions on \nshipments, price fixing, allocation or other means, the use, sale or distribution of food, feed, \n  11 \n\nfuel, clothing and other commodities, materials, goods, or services; and perform and \nexercise any other functions, powers, and duties as may be necessary to promote and secure \nthe safety and protection of the civilian population.  (See 20 ILCS 3305/7(12).) \n70.  The Illinois Constitution does not confer upon Pritzker the power to issue EO 32 for the \npurpose of separating and restricting the movement and activities of every citizen of this \nstate, whether they be ill or not. \n71.  None of the six enumerated provisions of the IEMAA cited by Pritzker in EO 32 delegate \nauthority for him to separate and restrict the movement and activities of every citizen of \nthis state, whether they be ill or not. \n72.  The Illinois Constitution does not confer upon Pritzker the power to issue EO 32 for the \npurpose of forcibly closing every business in this state which he concluded to be non-\nessential. \n73.  None of the six enumerated provisions of the IEMAA delegate authority to Pritzker the \npower to forcibly close every business in this state which he concluded to be non-essential. \n74.  Any strained interpretation of any of the six enumerated provisions of the IEMAA which \nPritzker may argue delegated him arbitrary authority to separate and restrict the movement \nand activities of every citizen of this state, whether they be ill or not, or to forcibly close \nall businesses which he concluded to be non-essential, would be in direct contravention to \nthe supreme authority delegated to the Illinois Department of Health (“IDPH”) by the \nlegislative branch of government pursuant to 20 ILCS 2305 et seq.  \n75.  IDPH has general supervision of the interests of the health and lives of the people of the \nState.  (See 20 ILCS 2305/2(a).)  \n76.  It has supreme authority in matters of quarantine and isolation.  (See 20 ILCS 2305/2(a).)  \n  12 \n\n77.  IDPH defines quarantine as “the separation and restriction of movement or activities of \npersons who are not ill…”  (See key terms on page 66 of IDPH Pandemic Plan attached to \nthe Complaint as Exhibit 5.)  \n78.  Subject to the provisions of subsection (c), the Department may order a person or group of \npersons to be quarantined or isolated or may order a place to be closed and made off limits \nto the public to prevent the probable spread of a dangerously contagious or infectious \ndisease. (See 20 ILCS 2305/2(b).) \n79.  Except as provided in this Section, no person or a group of persons may be ordered to be \nquarantined or isolated and no place may be ordered to be closed and made off limits to \nthe public except with the consent of the person or owner of the place or upon the prior \norder of a court of competent jurisdiction.  (See 20 ILCS 2305/2(c).) \n80.  If the legislative intent of 20 ILCS 2305 et seq. is not clear enough to support the legislature \nintended to give supreme authority of quarantined, isolation and business closures to the \nIDPH, further legislative action in the county code provides additional support. (See 55 \nILCS 5/5-25001 et seq.) \n81.  The board of health of each county or multiple-county health department shall: \na)  Within its jurisdiction, and professional and technical competence, enforce and observe \nall  State  laws  pertaining  to  the  preservation  of  health…    (See  55  ILCS  5/5-\n25013(A)(6).)  \nb)  Within its jurisdiction, and professional and technical competence, investigate the \nexistence of any contagious or infectious disease and adopt measures, not inconsistent \nwith the regulations of the State Department of Public Health…  (See 55 ILCS 5/5-\n25013(A)(7).)  \n  13 \n\n82.  Nothing written in the IEMAA can be construed as an intent by our legislature to delegate \nto the executive office such extraordinary power over our people. \n83.  Our legislature in 20 ILCS 2305 et seq. and 55 ILCS 5/5-25001 et seq. has clearly given \nsupreme authority over such matters to IDPH and each local county board of health.   \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Darren Bailey, herein requests that this court enter an Order: \nA. declaring Pritzker had no Illinois constitutional authority as Governor to restrict a citizen’s \nmovement or activities and/or forcibly close business premises in EO 32; \nB.  declaring that none of the cited provisions of the IEMAA in EO 32 delegated Pritzker any \nauthority to restrict a citizen’s movement or activities and/or forcibly close business premises; \nC.  declaring the proper authority to restrict a citizen’s movement or activities and/or forcibly \nclose their business due to any public health risks has been expressly delegated to the \nDepartment of Health under the Illinois Department of Public Health Act and the County Code;  \nD. Declaring any provision of EO 32 which restrict a citizen’s movement or activities and/or \nforcibly closes business premises is void ab initio;  \nE.  Awarding Bailey his costs incurred in this matter as may be allowed by law;  \nF.  That the Court grant such other and further relief as is just and proper. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nBy: /s/ Thomas Devore  \nThomas G. DeVore  \nIL Bar Reg.

      "text": "FILED\nClay Co. Circuit Court\n4th Judicial Circuit\nDate: 4/23/2020 4:03 PM\nCrystal Ballard\n2020CH6\n\nbut not limited to fire, flood, earthquake, wind, storm, hazardous materials spill or \nother water contamination requiring emergency action to avert danger or damage, \nepidemic, air contamination, blight, extended periods of severe and inclement \nweather, drought, infestation, critical shortages of essential fuels and energy, \nexplosion, riot, hostile military or paramilitary action, public health emergencies, or \nacts of domestic terrorism.  (See 20 ILCS 3305/4) \n5.  Pritzker determined the COVID-19 pandemic to be a \"public health emergency\" (See the \nMarch 09 Proclamation) \n6.  As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Pritzker declared all 102 counties within Illinois a \ndisaster area. (See Section 1 of March 09 Proclamation) \n7.  Bailey is citizen and lawful resident of Cole County Illinois. \n8.  Subsequent to a disaster proclamation, The Act confers specific enumerated powers upon the \nGovernor of the State of Illinois.  (See 20 ILCS 3305/2(a)(2)) \n9.  Amongst those enumerated powers are thirteen (13) emergency powers as provided in \nsection 7 of The Act.  (See 20 ILCS 3305/7) \n10. Section 7 of the Act expressly states: \n\"Upon such proclamation, the Governor shall have and may exercise for a period not \nto exceed 30 days the following emergency powers .... (See 20 ILCS 3305/7) \n11. Pursuant to the statutoty authority granted Pritzker via 20 ILCS 3305/7, resulting from the \nMarch 09 Proclamation, on March 20,2020 he issued Executive Order 2020-10.  (See \nattached Exhibit 2) (hereinafter refened to as the \"March 20 Executive Order\") \n12.  The March 20 Executive Order, inter alia, limits Bailey's constitutionally protected \nfreedoms in that it ordered him to stay at home, or at his place of residence, as well as limited \nhis ability to travel within the state. (See Section 1 of the March 20 order) \n13. The March 20 Executive Order on its face was effective ft·om March 21, 2020 through April \n07, 2020.  (See the \"therefore\" clause of the March 20 Executive Order) \n2 \n\n14. On April 01, 2020 Pritzker issued a second proclamation.  (See Exhibit 3) (hereinafter \nreferred to as the \"April 01 Proclamation\") \n15. In the April 01 Proclamation, Pritzker declares the COVID-19 pandemic to be a \"continuing \npublic health emergency\".  (See the April 01 Proclamation) \n16. On that same date of April 01,2020, Pritzker issues Executive Order 2020-18. (See attached \nExhibit 4) (hereinafter referred to as the \"April 01 Executive Order\") \n17. In the April 01 Executive Order, Pritzker specifically acknowledges the March 09 \nProclamation and the April 0 I Proclamation were both in direct response to the COVID-19 \npandemic. (See the April 0 I Executive Order) \n18. The April 01 Executive Order, inter alia, extended the duration of the March 20 Executive \nOrder until April 30, 2020. (See the April 01 Executive Order) \n19. As a direct result of the April 01 Executive Order, Pritzker has acted to restrain Bailey within \nhis residence, as well as limit his travel, for a period of time from March 21, 2020 until April \n30, 2020 as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic which was declared a disaster on March \n09, 2020. \n20. Additionally, Pritzker on announced publicly on April23, 2020 on his daily 2:30P.M. press \nconference, that effective May 01,2020, he will issue another extension of the March 20, \n2020 order restrain Bailey within his residence, as well as limit his travel, within the state. \nCOUNT I \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT \n21. Plaintiff restates paragraphs 1-20 as if more fully stated herein. \n22. In relation to the specific matters raised herein, Pritzker must act within the statutmy \nauthority granted him in The Act. \n3 \n\n23. Bailey is a citizen and resident of Clay County, Illinois and as such has a right to demand the \nexecutive orders issued by Pritzker pursuant to a declaration of a disaster are within the \nconfines of the authority granted Pritzker by the legislature pursuant to The Act. \n24. Pursuant to The Act, Pritzker issued the March 09 Proclamation wherein he determined the \nCOVID-19 pandemic to be a disaster. \n25. As a result of the March 09 Proclamation, Pritzker issued the March 20 Executive Order \nwherein he, inter alia, ordered Bailey to remain within the confines of his home, as well as \nlimited his travel, absent certain specific exceptions. \n26. Assuming arguendo, the March 20 Executive Order doesn't suffer other fatal defects, The \nAct is unambiguous in that it limits Pritzker's authority to utilize such an emergency order \nfor a period of time not to exceed 30 days from the date of the declaration of said disaster. \n27. Given the proclamation of the COVID-19 disaster was March 09, 2020, the March 20 \nexecutive order was as a matter oflaw required to lapse on or before April 08, 2020. \n28. On April 01,2020 Pritzker issues the April 01 proclamation, wherein he declares COVID-19 \nto be a  \"continuing disaster\". \n29. On that same day of April 01,2020, Pritzker issued the April 01 Executive Order, and \nordered, inter alia, a continuance of his March 20 Executive Order until April 30, 2020. \n30. As such, Pritzker, under the color of authority granted him by The Act, is utilizing the \nemergency powers for more than 3 0 days from the declaration of disaster resulting fi·om the \nCOVID-19 virus which was pronounced on March 09,2020. \n31. Pritzker is issuing redundant proclamations acknowledging the same COVID-19 virus as a \n\"continuing disaster\", wherein he is reenergizing the emergency provisions of The Act for \n4 \n\nthe sole purpose of rendering the statutory 3 0-day limitation placed on his emergency powers \nmeaningless. \n32. Bailey's interests are in opposition to Pritzker's in that Bailey insists Pritzker can only issue \nemergency executive orders within the confines of his authority delegated to him by the \nlegislature under The Act. (See Bailey's Legal Brief which shall be incorporated herein by \nreference). \n3 3. An actual controversy exists between the parties in regard to the authority of Pritzker to issue \nand enforce emergency orders under The Act for more than 3 0 days as a result of the ongoing \nCOVID-19 disaster which began March 09, 2020. \n34.  An immediate and definitive determination is necessary to clarifY the rights and interests of \nthe patties. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Darren Bailey, herein request that this court enter an Order: \nA.  Entering an order finding Pritzker declared the COVID-19 pandemic a state-wide \ndisaster on March 09, 2019; \nB.  Entering an order finding the emergency powers granted Pritzker as a result of the \nMarch 09 Proclamation lapsed on April 08, 2020; \nC.  Entering an order declaring the March 20 Executive Order lapsed at the end of April \n07, 2020; \nD.  Entering a finding that Pritzker' s April 01 Emergency Order extending the effective \ndate of his March 20 Executive Order until April 30, 2020 was in excess of the \nauthority granted him under The Act; \nE.  Enter an order finding that any further emergency executive orders in response to \nthe  COVID-19  continuing  disaster,  be  it  continuations  or  otherwise,  issued \n5 \n\nsubsequent to April 08, 2020 ordering Bailey remain within the confines of his \nhome, as well as limited his travel, absent certain specific exceptions are void ab \ninitio; and \nF.  Awarding the Plaintiff his costs incurr-ed in this matter as may be allowed by law; \nG.  That the Court grant such other and further relief as is just and proper. \nCOUNT II \nREQUEST FOR INJUNCTION \n35. Plaintiff restates paragraphs 1-34 as if more fully stated herein. \n36. The Act clearly limits Pritzker's authority to issue emergency orders under The Act for a \nperiod of time not to exceed 30 days from the declaration of a disaster. \n3 7. Bailey has a right to insist Pritzker' s executive orders comport to the confines of the \nauthority delegated to Pritzker under The Act. \n38. Bailey is being irreparably harmed each and every day beyond April 08, 2020 in which he \ncontinues to be subjected to Pritzker's ultra vires executive order. \n3 9. Bailey has no adequate remedy at law to prohibit Pritzker from enforcing the executive \norders against him absent an injunction from This Court ordering the same. \n40. There is a reasonably likelihood of success on the merits in that the disaster proclamation \nresulting from the COVID-19 pandemic originated on March 09,2020 and as such any \nemergency order ofPritzker resulting from this proclaimed disaster lapsed on April 08, 2020 \nunder the clear and unambiguous language of The Act. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Dan·en Bailey, prays that this Court enter judgment in his favor and finds \nand declares that: \nA.  Finding the Plaintiff has a right to insist Pritzker's executive orders relative to this \ncause were issued within the authority delegated by the legislature. \n6 \n\nB.  Finding Bailey is irreparably harmed each day he is subjected to the executive \norders relative to this cause. \nC.  Finding Bailey has no adequate remedy at law to protect his rights against any \nunlawful orders of Pritzker beyond injunctive relief. \nD.  Finding Bailey has a likelihood of success on the merits that the April 01 Executive \nOrder extending the March 20 Executive Order until April30, 2020 is void. \nE.  Enter an injunction permanently enjoining Pritzker, or anyone under his authority, \nfrom  enforcing  the  March 20  Executive  Order  against  Bailey  fi·om  this  date \nforward. \nF.  For such other relief as this Court deems just and proper. \nRespectfully submitted, \nBy:  /s/ Thomas Devore \nThomas G. DeVore \nIL Bar Reg.

He does so even \nthough  this  action  involves  only  the  construction  of  Illinois  statutes  and  whether \nDefendant took certain actions without statutory authority to do so:  This case concerns \nnothing more, nothing less.   Plaintiff has not requested an adjudication of his federal \nconstitutional rights or other rights and interests that may exist under federal law:  \nwhether Defendant’s actions violate federally protected interests is neither here nor there \nin this context.    \nPlaintiff’s complaint, not extra-judicial statements or judicial pronouncements, \ngoverns the question of subject matter jurisdiction, and the complaint and first amended \ncomplaint at issue in this case do not so much as hint that Plaintiff is seeking vindication \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 25   Filed 06/10/20   Page 2 of 12   Page ID #455\nof his federally guaranteed rights and interests.  Instead, Plaintiff alleges only that \nDefendant  lacked  authority  to  issue  certain  of  his  proclamations,  declarations  and \nexecutive orders.     \nDefendant’s reliance on 28 U.S.C. §1343(a)(3) is entirely misplaced, and it certainly \ndoes  not  provide  an  independent  basis  for  jurisdiction.      First,  nothing  in  Section \n1343(a)(3) or cases construing it suggest that Defendant can simply rewrite Plaintiff’s \ncomplaint and insert federal claims where none exist.   Moreover, Section 1343(a)(3) is, \nindeed, a relic of an era in which federal question jurisdiction was conditioned on an \namount in controversy and parties seeking vindication of their federal rights desperately \nneeded a distinct basis for federal jurisdiction in order to seek redress.   The elimination \nof the monetary threshold in Section 1331 removed that barrier to federal jurisdiction.    \nDefendant’s ultra vires executive orders and proclamations may well be fodder for \nfuture actions under the United States Constitution, the Constitution of the State of \nIllinois, and federal statutes.   However, a complaint seeking those remedies is nowhere \nin the record, and this matter should be remanded to the Circuit Court, Clay County, \nIllinois for further proceedings and for disposition.  \n \nDISCUSSION \nI.  NEITHER  PLAINTIFF’S  COMPLAINT  NOR  HIS  FIRST  AMENDED \nCOMPLAINT ESTABLISH A BASIS FOR FEDERAL JURISDICTION. \n \nThe Defendant clearly wants Plaintiff’s complaint to be something it is not:   an \nassertion that Defendant’s actions are proscribed by either the United States Constitution \nor a federal statute.   However, there is no invocation of federally protected rights in either \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 25   Filed 06/10/20   Page 3 of 12   Page ID #456\nPlaintiff’s complaint or first amended complaint.   The absence of a federal issue in \nPlaintiff’s pleadings preclude exercise of jurisdiction here.    \nThe United States Supreme Court has unequivocally directed that the existence of \nfederal question jurisdiction hinges on the allegations in the plaintiff’s complaint. \nUnder our longstanding interpretation of the current statutory scheme, the \nquestion whether a claim \"arises under\" federal law must be determined by \nreference to the \"well-pleaded complaint.\" Franchise Tax Board, 463 U.S., at \n9-10, 103 S. Ct., at 2846-2847. A defense that raises a federal question is \ninadequate to confer federal jurisdiction. Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. \nMottley, 211 U.S. 149, 29 S.  Ct. 42, 53 L. Ed. 126 (1908). Since a defendant \nmay remove a case only if the claim could have been brought in federal \ncourt, 28 U.S.C. § 1441(b), moreover, the question for removal jurisdiction \nmust also be determined by reference to the \"well-pleaded complaint.\"  \n \nMerrell Dow Pharm. v. Thompson, 478 U.S. 804, 808,  106 S. Ct. 3229 (1986).   At the time, \nfederal law did not recognize a private right of action under the Federal Food,  Drug and \nCosmetic Act.   Thus, the complaint at issue did not contain a federal cause of action and \nfederal jurisdiction was lacking.   See also Caterpillar, Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 392, 107 \nS. Ct. 2425 (1987) (“The presence or absence of federal-question jurisdiction is governed \nby the \"well-pleaded complaint rule,\" which provides that federal jurisdiction exists only \nwhen a federal question is presented on the face of the plaintiff's properly pleaded \ncomplaint . . . The rule makes the plaintiff the master of the claim; he or she may avoid \nfederal jurisdiction by exclusive reliance on state law.”) (internal citations omitted) \n  The Complaint and First Amended Complaint in this case make it clear removal \nwas entirely improper.   In this action, Plaintiff does not so much as hint that Defendant’s \nExecutive Orders, Declarations and Proclamations infringe on Plaintiff’s rights under the \nConstitution or federal law.   They may well so infringe and be actionable under federal \n  3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 25   Filed 06/10/20   Page 4 of 12   Page ID #457\nlaw.      However,  that  is  not  what  Plaintiff  seeks  in  this  action.      Plaintiff  seeks  a \ndetermination  that  Defendant’s  actions  are  invalid,  not  because  they  infringe  on \nfundamental rights guaranteed under federal law, but instead, because they exceed \nDefendant’s authority under Illinois law.     \n  What Defendant wants is the ability to amend Plaintiff’s pleadings and insert \nclaims Plaintiff has not yet asserted.   However, as the Supreme Court admonished, \nPlaintiff is the master of his claim, and cannot be compelled to assert federal claims in \norder to legitimize a bad faith invocation of federal jurisdiction.   \n  Much as he did with his asserted authority under Illinois law, Defendant goes to \ngreat lengths to contrive federal claims and causes of action in Plaintiff’s Complaint and \nFirst Amended Complaint.   Does Plaintiff claim that Defendant’s orders, proclamations \nand declarations have the effect of restricting his ability to travel, ability to associate with \nothers, and practice his faith?   He absolutely does make those allegations.   However, the \ncrux of Plaintiff’s causes of action is Defendant’s lack of statutory authority.     \nThe Court should reject any suggestion that Plaintiff, via artful pleading, has \nshrouded  what  are  actually  federal  claims  for  the  purpose  of  defeating  federal \njurisdiction.    Plaintiff’s allegations are straightforward:   (a) Defendant issued certain \nproclamations,  executive  orders,  and  declarations;  (b)  the  proclamations,  executive \norders, and declarations had the effect of restricting Plaintiff’s ability to travel, associate \nwith others, and practice his faith; and (c) Defendant had no statutory authority to do so.   \nThere is nothing manipulative about seeking relief limited to those theories.   \n  4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 25   Filed 06/10/20   Page 5 of 12   Page ID #458\nDefendant makes much of the state court judge’s statements on the record, as well \nas Plaintiff’s extra-judicial statements and quotations, none of which can form the basis \nfor jurisdiction here.   Jurisprudence concerning federal jurisdiction makes it clear the \n“well-pleaded complaint,” and not other quotations, pronouncements or extraneous \ndocuments, governs the existence of federal jurisdiction.  Thus, Plaintiff’s statements to \nthe press are of no moment and cannot impact assessment of his motion to remand.   \nLikewise, on-the-record statements of the state court judge, quoted by Defendant in his \nopposition to remand, are not part of the calculus, and even if they could be considered, \nit is clear he reached his conclusion on the basis of Defendant’s lack of statutory authority:  \n“The issue before me now is whether the Governor can ignore the Illinois and United \nStates Constitutions for more than 30 days.  This court rules that the answer to that \nquestion is a resounding no.” Governor’s Memorandum in Opposition to Remand [Doc. 24] \nat 2.  Clearly, the state court based its decision on Defendant’s authority under Illinois \nlaw, not on the constitutionality of the Defendant’s actions.     \nFederal jurisdiction is unquestionably lacking here.    Plaintiff’s pleadings do not \nraise any claims under the United States Constitution or federal statutes.    Defendant has \ndone nothing more than rewrite the Complaint and First Amended Complaint to suit his \nneeds.    That he cannot do, and this Court should remand this case to the Circuit Court, \nClay County, Illinois for further proceedings and disposition.     \n \n \n \n  5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 25   Filed 06/10/20   Page 6 of 12   Page ID #459\n \nII.  SECTION 1343(a)(3) DOES NOT ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT BASIS \nFOR  FEDERAL  JURISDICTION,  AND  DOES  NOT  EMBRACE  THE \nALLEGATIONS IN PLAINTIFF’S PLEADINGS.     \n \nDefendant’s exegesis concerning 28 U.S.C. §1343(a)(3) is interesting, but entirely \nirrelevant in this case.  The plain language of the statute, when applied to Plaintiff’s \ncauses of action, does not provide a jurisdictional hook.  Furthermore,  Section 1343 is a \nvestige of a time when jurisdiction under Section 1331 was dependent on an amount in \ncontroversy.  Amendment of Section 1331 to remove the monetary component rendered \nSection 1343(a)(3) superfluous.   Furthermore, there is no authority whatsoever that the \nCourt should look beyond a “well-pleaded complaint” in order to assess the existence of \njurisdiction under Section 1343(a)(3).   \nSection 1343 provides that  \n[t]he  district  courts  shall  have  original  jurisdiction  of  any  civil  action \nauthorized by law to be commenced by any person . . . to redress the \ndeprivation, under color of State law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom \nor usage, of any right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of \nthe United States or by any Act of Congress providing for equal rights of \ncitizens or of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States . . . \n \n28 U.S.C. §1343(a)(3).    \nPlainly, the statute is inapplicable in the case at bar.   Yes, Plaintiff is a “person” \nwithin the contemplation of the statute, but the applicability of Section 1343(a)(3) stops \nthere. Plaintiff has not sought, in this action, redress for the deprivation of a right, \nprivilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States or by any Act of \nCongress providing for equal rights.   Plaintiff has sought nothing more than (a) a \ndeclaration that Defendant exceeded his authority under applicable Illinois statutes and \n  6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 25   Filed 06/10/20   Page 7 of 12   Page ID #460\n(b) because of lack of a statutory basis, Plaintiff should be excused from compliance with \nDefendant’s proclamations, executive orders, and declarations.    Those allegations do not \nform the basis for federal jurisdiction. \n  Defendant seems to posit that federal jurisdiction is triggered whenever state \naction infringes on a fundamental right and a plaintiff seeks relief from the state action, \nno matter the basis for the plaintiff’s claim.    Nothing in Section 1343(a)(3) or the authority \nconstruing it gives the statute such breadth.   Would an action challenging a mayor’s \nauthority under a city’s ordinances to close a street, if it impaired a person’s ability to \ntravel or attend a religious service, be removable if the state actor did not like his or her \nchances in a state court?   Of course not.    The Court should summarily reject such a \nconstruction of the statute. \nSection 1343(a)(3) is a product of a different time, and its necessity has waned.   \nMyles v. U.S., 416 F.3d 551 (7th Cir. 2005).    The Seventh Circuit noted, albeit in dicta, that \n“Section 1343(a)(3) covers only civil rights claims against state actors and has had no legal \neffect since 1976, when Congress amended §1331 to eliminate any amount-in-controversy \nrequirement.  (The point of §1343(a)(3) had been to allow civil-rights suits without regard \nto the amount in controversy . . . ).” Id. at 554.   See also Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights \nOrg., 441 U.S. 600, 99 S. Ct. 1905 (1979) (“In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals \nfirst noted that § 1983 'is not a jurisdictional statute; it only fashions a remedy . . . Nor \ncould  jurisdiction  be  founded  on  28  U.S.C.  §  1331,  the  general  federal-question \njurisdictional statute, since the amount in controversy did not exceed $10,000.”).    \n  7 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 25   Filed 06/10/20   Page 8 of 12   Page ID #461\nDefendant makes it clear he is proceeding solely under Section 1343(a)(3), and \ndisavows any reliance on “arising under” jurisdiction as contemplated in Section 1331.   \nHowever, the clear implication of Chapman and Myles is that “arising under” jurisdiction \nas contemplated in Section 1331 subsumes Section 1343(a)(3).   Thus, pursuant to the \nanalysis in Chapman and Myles, if jurisdiction is non-existent under Section 1331 it is \nlikewise lacking under Section 1343(a)(3).  Since Defendant essentially concedes this \nCourt lacks jurisdiction under Section 1331, by implication it also lacks jurisdiction under \nSection 1343(a)(3).   \nThe Defendant erroneously believes he discovered a well-spring of authority in \nSpaulding v. Mingo County Board of Educ., 897 F. Supp. 284 (S.D. W. Va. 1995).   The \nplaintiffs in that case asserted nothing but claims under various West Virginia statutes \nand West Virginia common law.   The District Court concluded that the plaintiffs “artfully \ndrafted”  their  complaint  to  avoid  asserting  federal  claims,  and,  since  claims  under \nvarious West Virginia statutes apparently ran parallel to similar federal statutes and the \nUnited States Constitution.   Ultimately, however, the Spaulding court remanded the case \nto the West Virginia state court, and did so because of the importance of the questions of \nstate law presented.     \nUnfortunately, the Spaulding court’s assessment of federal jurisdiction under \nSection 1343(a)(3) was never tested on appeal.   The court made no effort to explain why \na plaintiff who elects to assert only state law causes of action must be deemed to have \nalleged federal claims as well, and it essentially ignored long-standing authority that a \nplaintiff is the master of his complaint.    \n  8 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 25   Filed 06/10/20   Page 9 of 12   Page ID #462\nThe only plausible explanation for the Spaulding court’s decision is that it found \n“embedded” federal claims that conferred jurisdiction.    However, the court did not \nhave the benefit of the Supreme Court’s decision in Grable & Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. \nDarue Engineering & Manufacturing, 545 U.S. 308, 312 (2005).  Where federal law does \nnot create the cause of action, \"federal jurisdiction over a state law claim will [only] lie \nif a federal issue is: (1) necessarily raised, (2) actually disputed, (3) substantial, and (4) \ncapable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the federal-state balance \napproved by Congress.\" Id. at 258.  As Plaintiff explained in his Memorandum in Support \nof Emergency Motion to Remand, no federal claims are necessarily raised in this case, there \nis no actual dispute in this action concerning contravention of Plaintiff’s federal rights \n(he  seeks  only  a  determination  of  Defendant’s  authority  under  Illinois  law),  the \ninfringement of fundamental rights is not essential to a determination of Defendant’s \nauthority under state law, and construction of the Illinois Emergency Management \nAgency Act and the Illinois Department of Public Health Act, i.e., the core of Plaintiff’s \ncauses of action, is not “capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the \nfederal-state balance.”   [Doc. 8 at 5-7]. \nDefendant claims that “courts across the county have continued to recognize \nSection 1343(a)(3) as good law, and a valid basis for federal jurisdiction.” Governor’s \nMemorandum in Opposition to Remand [Doc. 24 at 20].  Defendant then provides citations \nto a smattering of cases that purport to exercise jurisdiction under Section 1343(a)(3).   \nHowever, Defendant conveniently omits that in each of the cases in his string citation the \nplaintiffs specifically stated claims under 42 U.S.C. §1983 and the courts found they had \n  9 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 25   Filed 06/10/20   Page 10 of 12   Page ID #463\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§1331 and 1343(a)(3).   See Jhagroo v. Brown, 2020 WL 419450, \n*1 (S.D.N.Y. 2020); Willis v. Tejeda, 2019 WL 498952, *1 (N.D. Ill. 2019); Correction Officers’ \nBenevolent Ass'n, Inc. v. City of New York, 415 F. Supp. 3d 464, 466–67 (S.D.N.Y. 2019).   \nOther  authorities  Defendant  relies  upon  are  completely  inapplicable  in  this \nsituation.  For example, in Rodriguez v. Comas, 888 F.2d 899 (1st Cir. 1989), the plaintiff \nspecifically stated a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. §1983 and the Court was not called \nupon to find non-existent causes of action.    Equally unhelpful to Defendant’s position is \nCampbell v. Gadsden County Dist. School Bd., 534 F.2d 650 (5th Cir. 1976).   In considering \nthe question of jurisdiction, the Fifth Circuit noted that “[f]ederal question jurisdiction \nwas also asserted under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, but the record does not affirmatively establish \nthe existence of an amount in controversy in excess of $10,000.”  Id. at 653, n. 7.   As noted \nabove, the obstacle to federal jurisdiction under Section 1331 has been removed.     \nIn sum, the Court should reject the Defendant’s assertions that Section 1343(a)(3) \nprovides an independent basis for jurisdiction in this case.    Plaintiff has alleged nothing \nbut claims that Defendant exceeded his authority under Illinois law.   There may be a day \nwhen Plaintiff (and others) seek to vindicate their rights under federal law.   However, \nthat is not this case.    \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Defendant has done nothing more than attempt to recast Plaintiff’s pleadings \nas setting forth claims that are simply not there.   In this action, Plaintiff seeks nothing \nmore than a declaration concerning Defendant’s alleged authority and an injunction \n  10 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 25   Filed 06/10/20   Page 11 of 12   Page ID #464\nrelieving  Plaintiff  from  compliance  with  certain  of  Defendant’s  executive  orders, \ndeclarations and proclamations.   None of Plaintiff’s pleadings request an adjudication \nconcerning his right under federal law.    \nAt the end of the day, Defendant is forum shopping.   He sought relief in the \nIllinois Supreme Court and was rejected there.   He filed a motion to transfer Plaintiff’s \nClay County, Illinois case to Sangamon County, and the Circuit Court denied that \nmotion.   Facing a hearing on Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment, Defendant then \nconcocted a removal to this Court.     \nFor the reasons set forth herein and in Plaintiff’s Emergency Motion to Remand \nand Memorandum in Support of Emergency Motion to Remand, the Court should (A) \nremand this case immediately to the Circuit Court, Clay County, Illinois and (B) award \nPlaintiff his attorney fees, costs and expenses associated with this matter \n \n            Respectfully submitted,  \nSILVER LAKE GROUP, LTD.  \n  \n/s/ Steven M.

De Vore, Erik Hyam, and DeV  ore Law Offices, LLC, and provides this \nmemorandum in support of his cause, and hereby states: \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  Bailey readily recognizes COVID-19 is a serious public health matter which has required \na conce1ied effort to combat and protect our state's public health interest. \n2.  Bailey's objection to  Governor  Pritzker's (\"Pritzker\")  effmis lies not solely with the \nefficacy of the unilateral decisions being made, but more with the blatant usurping of long-\nstanding legislative solutions which were already in place to manage such public health \nemergencies. \n3.  These long-standing legislative  solutions  enacted to  protect the  public health include \nnumerous statutory procedural and substantive due process protections to preserve our \npeople's individual libe1iies during these trying times, which intentionally or not, have \nbeen absolutely shredded by the executive branch over the last two months. \n1 \n\n4.  Bailey acknowledges that on March 09, 2020, COVID-19 constituted an occutrnnce or \nthreat, which rose to the level of a disaster, as it required at that time emergency measures \nto try and avert a public health emergency, all as defined in Section 4 of the IEMAA. \n5.  As of the filing of his Motion for Summaiy Judgment, Bailey offers no facts in dispute that \nas of the filing of Proclamation #3 on April 30, 2020 a public health emergency which \noriginated on March 09, 2020 still existed. \n6.  The issue of whether or not a public health emergency existed on April 30, 2020 is but a \nred-hening to deflect from the substantive matters actually present in this cause. \n7.  Bailey contends the operative provisions  of the IEMAA have been perverted by the \nexecutive office to wield emergency powers far in excess of the legislative grant to address \nany such public health emergency. \n8.  As a direct result of the unilateral action of Pritzker in response to COVID-19, our state \nand  local  economies  have  been  devastated  and  many  good  people  have  lost  their \nlivelihoods. \n9.  The economic and societal costs resulting from Pritzker' s ai·bitraiy decisions will have far \nreaching impacts lasting a generation or more. \n10. Thousands of businesses Pritzker deemed non-essential have been forced to close their \ndoors and many are staring at the stark reality of financial ruin. \n11. Our citizens wake up each day and must determine if their free will has been restrained by \nPritzker' s list of essential activities. \n12. It is undeniable a public health emergency such as this presents challenges to government, \nbusinesses and individuals, but these challenges demand a balancing of the public health \nwith all individual's God-given rights, and not just for those who have been arbitrarily \n2 \n\ndeemed essential by an administrative agency, which agency determination of essentiality \nwas beyond the purview of the watchful public eye. \n13. The rule of law forged by our forefathers, and maintained by the sacrifices of millions of \npatriots in our history, cannot be cast aside during times of crisis, as it is these ve1y times \nwhen the rule of law is needed to protect our people. \n14. Each of Bailey's three  counts for  declarat01y judgment are matters for which justice \nrequires a timely resolve via summaty judgment. \n15. There are no issues of material fact in either of the three causes. \n16. The facts and circumstances in the public record speak for themselves. \n17. Each of the tlu·ee matters which the Court is being asked to resolve only require a review \nof the public records, all of which were attached as exhibits in this cause: \n18. When the Co mt reviews all of these documents and relevant statutes, and applies current \nlegal precedent, Bailey avers that summary judgment should be granted in his favor on all \ntlu·ee counts. \nLEGAL FRAMEWORK OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION \n19. The  cai·dinal  rule  of statut01y  construction,  to  which  all  other canons  and  rules  ai·e \nsubordinate, is to asce1tain and give effect to the true intent and meaning of the legislature. \nPeople v.  Boykin (1983), 94 Ill.2d 138, 141, 68 Ill.Dec. 321, 445 N.E.2d 1174, quoting \nPeople ex rel. Hanrahan v.  White (1972), 52 Ill.2d 70, 73, 285 N.E.2d 129.) \n20. In dete1mining the legislative intent, courts should consider first the statutory language. \nBoykin, 94 Ill.2d at 141. \n3 \n\n21. Unambiguous terms, when not specifically defined, must be given their plain and ordinaiy \nmeaning. Hayes v.  Mercy Hospital &  Medical Center (1990), 136 Ill.2d 450, 455,  145 \nIll.Dec. 894, 557 N.E.2d 873. \n22. The courts presume that the  General Assembly, in passing legislation, did not intend \nabsurdity, inconvenience, or injustice and a statute will be interpreted so as to avoid a \nconstruction which would raise doubts as to its validity.  Harris v.  Manor Healthcare \nCorp., 489 N.E.2d 1374, 111Ill.2d350, 95 Ill.Dec. 510 (Ill. 1986) \n23. The courts also will avoid a construction of a statute which would render any portion of it \nmeaningless or void. Id. \n24. Under accepted and established rules of statutmy construction, when more than one act \nmight apply to a situation, the more specific provisions prevail over the more general ones \nin cases of conflict.  Winnebago County v. Davis, 509 N.E.2d 143, 156 Ill.App.3d 535, 108 \nIll.Dec. 717 (Ill. App. 1987); Board of Education v.  Carter (1983), 119 Ill. App. 3d 857, \n75 Ill.Dec. 882, 458 N.E.2d 50.; Board ofE duc. ofM  inooka Community High School Dist. \nNo. 111, Grundy, Kendall and Will Counties v. Carter, 458 N.E.2d 50, 119 Ill.App.3d 857, \n75 Ill.Dec. 882 (Ill. App. 1983) \nOTHER OPERATIVE LEGAL AUTHORITY \n25. Section 8 of article V of the Constitution does not grant a Governor the authority to \npromulgate new legal requirements via executive orders.  Buettell v.  Walker, 319 N.E.2d \n502, 59 Ill.2d 146 (Ill. 1974) \n26. An executive order can be utilized to execute an existing law but it is not a vehicle for \nestablishing a new one. Id. \n4 \n\n27. According to the Honorable Former Attorney General Lisa Madigan, a Governor does not \nhave the power to legislate by executive order, and therefore, unless authorized by law an \nexecutive order relating to matters other than executive reorganization can be no more than \na policy directive to agencies under the Governor's control. (See 2013 Ill. Att'y Gen. Op. \n002) \n28. According to  the  Honorable F01mer Attorney  General  Jim  Ryan,  emergency powers \ngranted to a Governor under Section 7 of IEMAA cannot be extended beyond 30-days \nwithout legislative approval.  (See 2001 Ill. Att'y Gen. Op. I-028) \n29. Attorney General Ryan went on to advise the act was clear in that it authorized emergency \npowers  for  30-days and constrnction of the  statute  any  other way  would  render the \nlimitation clause meaningless. Id. \n30. Ryan found fmiher suppmi for this constrnction is suppmied by references to section 9 of \nthe IEMAA, which pe1iains to the financing of disaster response measures.  Section 9 \nprovides for the Governor's use of paiiicular appropriated funds for emergency purposes, \nand, if necessaty and the General Assembly is not in session, the transfer of funds from \nother accounts or the borrowing of additional funds, but only \"until such time as a quornm \nof the General Assembly can convene in regular or extraordinaiy session\". The purpose of \nthis provision, like section 7 of the Act, is to empower the Governor to deal i111111ediately \nwith emerging emergency situations.  Id. \n31. Ryan finished by stating, even though many disaster situations could require remediation \nfor  a  period  long  in  excess  of 3 0-days,  normal  goverlllllental  processes,  including \nlegislative action, can be set in motion to meet such needs within 30-days of the occmTence. \nId. \n5 \n\n32. In the case of emergencies it is indispensable to the preservation of public health that some \nadministrative body should be clothed with authority to make adequate tules which have \nthe force of law, and to put these rules and regulations into effect promptly.  Barmore v. \nRobertson, 302 Ill. 422, 134 N.E. 815, 819 (Ill. 1922) \n33. While the courts will not pass upon the wisdom of the means adopted to restrict and \nsuppress  the  spread  of contagious  and  infectious  diseases,  they  will  interfere  if the \nregulations are arbitrary and unreasonable. Id. \n34. Health authorities cannot promulgate and enforce rules which merely have a tendency to \nprevent the spread of contagious and infectious diseases. Id. 1 \n3 5. The health authorities cannot interfere with the liberties of a citizen until the emergency \nactually exists. Id. \n36. IDPH has general supervision of the interests of the health and lives of the people of the \nState.  (See 20 ILCS 2305/2(a)) \n37. IDPH has supreme authority in matters of quarantine and isolation.  (See 20  ILCS \n2305/2(a)) \n38. IDPH defines quarantine as \"the separation and restriction of movement or activities of \npersons who are not ill .... \"  (See key terms on page 66 ofIDPH Pandemic Plan attached \nto the Complaint as Exhibit 5.) \n39. Subject to the provisions of subsection (c), the Depaiiment may order a person or group of \npersons to be quarantined or isolated or may order a place to be closed and made off limits \n1 This prohibition sounds awful shnilar to \"flattening the curve\". This is yet another exa1nple in this cause where \nIllinois Supreme Corut precedent is being ignored by Pritzker in that he is enforcing by executive fiat health \nregulations which have been deemed beyond the authority of government for a~nost a centmy. \n6 \n\nto the public to prevent the probable spread of a dangerously contagious or infectious \ndisease. (See 20 ILCS 2305/2(b)) \n40. Except as provided in this Section, no person or a group of persons may be ordered to be \nquarantined or isolated and no place may be ordered to be closed and made off limits to \nthe public except with the consent of the person or owner of the place or upon the prior \norder of a court of competent jurisdiction. (See 20 ILCS 2305/2(c ) ) \n41. If the legislative intent of20 ILCS 2305 et seq. is not clear enough to support the legislature \nintended to give supreme authority of quarantined, isolation and business closures to the \nIDPH, fmiher legislative action in the county code provides additional supp01i. (See 55 \nILCS 5/5-25001 et seq.) \n42. The board of health of each county or multiple-county health depatiment shall \na)  Within its jurisdiction, and professional and technical competence, enforce and \nobserve all State laws pertaining to the preservation of health ..... See 55 ILCS 5/5-\n25013 (A)(6). \nb)  Within its jurisdiction, and professional and technical competence, investigate the \nexistence of any contagious or infectious disease and adopt measures, not inconsistent \nwith the regulations of the State Depatiment of Public Health ... See 55 ILCS 5/5-\n25013 (A)(7). \n43. A board of health must necessarily consist of more than one person, and it generally \nconsists of several persons. Barmore, 134 N.E. at 820. \n44. Many authorities contend that the administration of public health should be vested in an \nindividual.  Id. \n7 \n\n45. This contention is based on the ground that this form of administration of the health laws \nis productive of efficiency and economy. Id. \n46. The same argument might be made in favor of an absolute monarchy, but the experience \nof the world has been that other fo1ms of government, perhaps more cumbersome and less \nefficient, insure to the people a more reasonable and less arbitrary administration of the \nlaws. Id. \n4 7. Whatever may be best, the Legislature of Illinois has said that the public health of cities \nshall be regulated and guarded by a board of health. Id. \n48. The powers given to boards of health are extraordinaiy, and the legislature was evidently \nunwilling to leave to one person the dete1mination of such important and drastic measures \nas are given to such boai·ds. Id. (Emphasis Added) \nAS TO COUNT I THE COURT SHOULD DELCARE THERE HAS BEEN ONLY ONE \nDISASTER AND AS SUCH PROCLAMATION #2 AND PROCLAMATION #3 FAILED TO \nMEET THE DEFINITION OF A DISASTER AND AS SUCH ARE INVALID \n49. In the TRO hearing on April 27, 2020, counsel for Pritzker (\"Pritzker's Counsel\") stated \nto this Court that a declaration of disaster \"triggers\" the emergency provisions of section 7 \nof the IEMAA.  (Transcript from TRO Hearing, Pg. 41, Lines 17-24) \n50. Pritzker's Counsel stated: \"so the triggering event is the proclamation and then the 30-\ndays.\" (Transcript from TRO Hearing, Pg. 42, Lines 2-3) \n51. Pritzker's Counsel stated: \"If there's another proclamation, then there's another trigger, and, \nif there's  another  proclamation,  then  there's  another  trigger.\"  (Transcript  from  TRO \nHeai·ing, Pg. 42, Lines 3-5) \n8 \n\n52. Pritzker's Counsel further stated: What's the guardrail? What's the guardrail because this \ncan't go on forever? Well, the guardrail is that the Governor is required under the act to \ndeclare a disaster. (Transcript from TRO Hearing, Pg. 42, Lines 5-8) \n53. The Court asked \"What's to stop him from keeping on declaring a disaster for the next five \nyears? (Transcript from TRO Hearing, Pg. 42, Lines 9-10) \n54. Pritzker's Counsel stated: Mr. Bailey could bring a case and say his declaration of disaster \nwas not taken in good faith, and that's the standard.  (Transcript from TRO Hearing, Pg. \n42, Lines 12-14) \n55. Notwithstanding Pritzker's Counsel's suggested standard of bad faith, Bailey would \nnever outright accuse Pritzker of arbitrarily reissuing disaster proclamations every 3 0-\ndays in bad faith merely as a ruse to attempt to maintain an executive stronghold on the \nstate, but reasonable minds might be inclined to consider such a proposition. \n56. The language of the IEMAA is clear that a disaster requires an 'occurrence or threat' which \nmeets the definition of Section 4 of the IEMAA. \n57. As for Proclamation #1, the occurrence or threat was COVID-19. \n58. While efforts were certainly taken at the onset to try and avert a public health emergency, \nby the time Proclamation #2 and Proclamation #3 were issued it was clear nothing was \nbeing aveiied anymore, and effmis were being taken to manage COVID-19. \n59. There is absolutely one occurrence, and one occurrence only, evidencing why Proclamation \n#2 and Proclamation #3 were even issued, and that was due to arbitrary and unnecessary \ntermination dates placed in the proclamations merely to reset the trigger of the emergency \npowers. \n9 \n\n60. Pritzker's Counsel at the April 27, 2020 hearing all but admitted to this Honorable Court \nthat serial proclamations were being issued merely to \"trigger\" the emergency powers. \n61. Triggering the extension of the emergency powers is not a threat or occurrence as defined \nin Section 4 of the IEMAA. \n62. Case law is clear this Court should not interpret the IEMAA in such a way as to cause \nabsurd results and this Court should always look for the true intent of the legislature. \n63. In doing so, the Court must conclude the legislature never intended for the executive branch \nto  issue  serial  disaster  proclamations  for  the  exact  same  disaster  merely  to  trigger \nemergency powers. \n64. Such an interpretation of the statute would render the express limitation on the emergency \npowers meaningless. \n65. With the facts  present, the Court could ce1iainly ente1iain the proffered standard that \nProclamation #2 and Proclamation #3 were not issued in good faith, but it would suffice \nfor the Court to merely find the legislature never intended the executive branch be allowed \nto place an arbitrary end date in a disaster proclamation merely to \"trigger\" a reset of the \nemergency powers with the issuance of a serial disaster proclamation regarding the exact \nsame occurrence or threat which gave rise to the initial disaster proclamation. \n66. The Court should find Proclamation #2 and Proclamation #3 were issued solely for the \npurpose to \"trigger\" a reset of the emergency powers of section 7 of the IEMAA. \n67. As such, Proclamation #2 and Proclamation #3  should be deemed invalid for failure to \nmeet the definition of a disaster of under Section 4 of the IEMAA. \n68. Until such time as our legislature changes the definition of disaster to include a continuing \nproclamation may issue when necessary  to  create  a  fiction  to  arbitraTily  extend the \n10 \n\nemergency powers to  the executive branch, this Comt should decline to find such an \ninjustice was intended by the legislature. \n69. If the Court is not inclined to strike down the proclamation in total, the Court ought to \ninvalidate the relevant provision of Proclamation #2 and Proclamation #3 which \"trigger\" \nthe emergency powers. \n70. Should the Court choose to invalidate just the relevant provision of Proclamation #2 which \ntriggered a reset of emergency powers, it can be found in Section 1 of Proclamation #2. \n71. Should the Co mi choose to invalidate just the relevant provision of Proclamation #3 which \ntriggered a reset of emergency powers, it can be found in Section 1 of Proclamation #3. \nAS TO COUNT II THE COURT SHOULD DELCARE THE \n30-DAY   EMERGENCY POWERS LAPSED ON APRIL 08, 2020 \n72. Upon the issuance of a proclamation of disaster, Pritzker shall have and may exercise for \na period not to exceed 3 0-days certain enumerated emergency powers. \n73. Pritzker has by devise been exercising emergency powers under Section 7 of the IEMAA \nsince March 09, 2020. \n74. Counsel  for  Pritzker stated to  this  Comi that a declaration of disaster \"triggers\" the \nemergency provisions of section 7 of the IEMAA.  (Transcript from TRO Hearing, Pg. 41, \nLines 17-24) \n75. Pritzker's Counsel fmther stated: \"If there's another proclamation, then there's another \nh·igger, and, if there's another proclamation, then there's another h·igger.\" (Transcript from \nTRO Hearing, Pg. 42, Lines 3-5) \n76. Pritzker has issued three proclamations of disaster. \n77. The first on March 09, 2020; second on April 01, 2020; lastly April 30, 2020. \n78. COVID-19 was a public health emergency at all times relevant. \n11 \n\n79. Pritzker  placed  an  arbitrary  30-day  expiration  date  m  each  of the  three  disaster \nproclamations. \n80. The IEMAA has no such requirement regarding any termination date in a proclamation of \ndisaster. \n81. Each time Pritzker issues a new proclamation in 30-day increments, he continues to wield \nthe emergency powers under Section 7 of the IEMAA for another 30-days. \n82. In each and eve1y disaster proclamation, Pritzker refers to the exact same COVID-19 virus \nas the tln·eat or occurrence present substantiating his proclamation. \n83. The documents and admissions of Pritzker' s Counsel evidence the serial proclamations of \nthe same COVID-19 disaster are for no other purpose than to trigger emergency power for \nas long as Pritzker deems prudent. \n84. The courts presume that the General Assembly, in passing legislation, did not intend \nabsurdity or injustice. \n85. The courts also will avoid a construction of a statute which would render any portion of \nsaid statute meaningless or void. \n86. It's absurd to  believe the  legislature  intended to  allow the  executive  office  to  issue \nnumerous consecutive proclamations of disaster for the exact same occurrence or tln·eat, \nwhich in this  instance  is  COVID-19,  and to  allow the  executive office to  wield the \nextraordinary emergency powers into perpetuity. \n87.  Such  an  interpretation  would  also  render  the  30-day  limit  on  emergency  powers \nmeaningless. \n88. The issue of the 30-day limitation in the IEMAA was presented to former attorney general \nJim Ryan in 2001. \n12 \n\n89. According to the Honorable  Former Attorney  General Jim Ryan,  emergency powers \ngranted to a Governor under Section 7 of IEMAA cannot be extended beyond 30-days \nwithout legislative approval. \n90. Attorney General Ryan went on to advise the act was clear in that it authorized emergency \npowers for  30-days and construction of the  statute any other way would render the \nlimitation clause meaningless. \n91. Ryan found further support by finding: \na)  This construction is suppmied by references to section 9 of the IEMAA, which pertains \nto the financing of disaster response measures. \nb)  Section  9  provides  for  the  Governor's  use  of particular  appropriated  funds  for \nemergency purposes, and, if necessary and the General Assembly is not in session, the \ntransfer of funds from other accounts or the bon-owing of additional funds, but only \n\"until such time as a quornm of the General Assembly can convene in regular or \nextraordinaiy session\". \nc)  The purpose of this provision, like section 7 of the Act, is to empower the Governor to \ndeal immediately with emerging emergency situations. \nd)  Even though many disaster situations could require remediation for a period long in \nexcess of 30-days, normal governmental processes, including legislative action, can be \nset in motion to meet such needs within 30-days of the occurrence. \n92. Former Attorney General Ryan's opinion seems consistent with the intent of the legislature \nand Bailey asks this Comi to find that saine. \nAS TO COUNT III THE COURT SHOULD DELCARE PRITZKER HAS NO \nCONSTITUTIONAL POWER OR STATUTORY POWER TO EVER ORDER \nCITIZENS TO STAY AT HOME OR TO FORCIBLY CLOSE BUSINESSES \n13 \n\n93. If those relevant paiis (stay at home and non-essential business closure) ofEO 32 are to be \nvalid, Pritzker must find the authority to execute the same either in the Illinois Constitution \nor the IEMAA. \n94. As alleged authority to issue EO 32, Pritzker relies on two sources: \na)  Powers vested in him as the Governor of the State of Illinois. \nb)  Sections 7(1), 7(2), 7(3), 7(8), 7(9) and 7(12) of the IEMAA. \n(See the \"THEREFORE\" clause on page 2 of EO 32) \n95. If the authority does not lie in at least one of those two sources, the relevant provisions of \nEO 32 are void. \nA.  Pritzker has No Constitutional Grant of Authority \n96. In EO 32, Pritzker states the following: \n\"In regard to  Pritzker's powers vested in him by  the  Illinois  Constitution, he  states: \n\"whereas, the Illinois Constitution, in Atiicle V, Section 8, provides that the governor shall \nhave the supreme executive power, and shall be responsible for the faithful execution of \nthe laws, and states in the Preamble, that a central purpose of the Illinois Constitution is to \nprovide for the health, and welfare of the people\" (See 211d to last whereas clause ofEO 32) \n97. Moreover, Pritzker's Counsel goes through great lengths at the TRO hearing on April 27, \n2020 to  convince the Comi Pritzker wields constitutional power to  issue the relevant \nprovisions of the executive orders such as those being disputed herein.  (Transcript from \nTRO Hearing, Pg.  57,  Lines 7-8)  (Transcript from TRO  Hearing, Pg.  58, Lines 4-5) \n(Transcript from TRO Hearing, Pg. 63, Lines 3-4) \n98. It needs to be crystal elem-, on April 27, 2020, it was the assertion of Attorney General \nKw  ame  Raoul's  Assistant  Chief  Deputy  that  Pritzker  lawfully  wields  Illinois \n14 \n\nConstitutional Authority to enter executive orders which restrict citizens movement and \nactivities, and also to forcibly close businesses deemed non-essential in every corner of \nthis state. \n99. The Attorney General is the state's chief!egal officer and is responsible for protecting the \npublic interest of the state and its people. \n100. Protecting the rights of the good people of this state is  an obligation of the Office of \nAttorney General. \n101. One  can  only  presume  the  Attorney  General's  Kwame  Raoul's  Office  must  have \noverlooked the penned opinion of Former Attorney General Ms. Lisa Madigan from 2013. \n102. And one must further presume the Attorney General's Office was not familiar with Illinois \nSupreme Court authority which expressly forbids the use of executive orders for reasons \nargued proper to this Honorable Court on April 27, 2020. \n103. Section 8 of miicle V of the Constitution does not grant a Governor the authority to \npromulgate new legal requirements via executive orders.  Buettell v.  Walker, 319 N.E.2d \n502, 59 Ill.2d 146 (Ill. 1974) \n104. An executive order can be utilized to execute an existing law but it is not a vehicle for \nestablishing a new one. Id. \n105.Ms. Madigan's interpretation of the authority of a Governor to legislate via executive \norder draws a stark contrast to those taken by the cunent office of Attorney General in \nthis Comt. \n106.It bem·s mentioning former Attorney General Madigan's opinion was grounded in the \nIllinois Supreme Court authority cited directly above. \n15 \n\n107. F01mer Attorney General Madigan was c1ystal clear when she wrote: \"unless authorized \nby law an executive order relating to matters other than executive reorganization \ncan be no more than a policy directive to agencies under the Governor's control\" \n108. It is fair to say EO 32 goes just a tad bit further than a policy directive to agencies. \n109. Contrary to the argument of the cu!1'ent Attorney General's Office in this Comi on April \n27, 2020, Pritzker can find no refuge in the Illinois Constitution to issue those provisions \nofEO 32 which trample upon the rights of eve1y citizen in this great state. \nNo Delegated Authority from the IEMAA \n110.None of the specifically enumerated provisions of the IEMAA expressly give Pritzker \nauthority to restrict the movement of people and their activities,  or to forcibly close \nbusinesses. \n111. Only one of the six enumerated provisions of the IEMAA cited by Pritzker could even \nremotely provide a semblance of implied power. \n112. Section 7(8) states: \n(8) To control ingress and egress to and from a disaster area, the movement of persons \nwithin the area, and the occupancy of premises therein. (See 20 ILCS 3305/7(8)) \n113. While it would be a strained interpretation to say the least, the Court need only look to \nother statutory schemes as well as relevant case law to conclude the legislature never \nintended to delegate such extraordinary power to the executive in the IEMAA. \n114. IDPH has supreme authority in matters of quarantine and isolation. \n115. IDPH defines quarantine as \"the separation and restriction of movement or activities of \npersons who are not ill .... \" \n16 \n\n116. The board of health of each county or multiple-county health department shall enforce all \nstate laws pertaining to the preservation of health. \n117. IDPH finds it authority in 20 ILCS 2305 et seq. which authority contains significant \nprocedural and substantive safeguard protections for our people and businesses. \n118. Our Illinois Supreme Court was clear almost 100 years ago that such power wielded over \nour people must be done by a board and not one person. \n119. Should the Comt find it even necessary to compare the IDPHA and the IEMAA, only one \nconclusion can be drawn, and that is the legislature created a specific statut01y scheme for \nprotecting the public health during times like these within the IDPHA. \n120. That scheme includes a board of health in every county, with the oversight of our comts \nif necessaiy, which has been entrusted by our legislature, with balancing the protection \nof the public health with the liberty interests of our people. \n121. IDPH wields the power to isolate and quarantine our citizens and to close our businesses \nwhen necessary to protect the public health. \n122. Almost 100 years ago, our Supreme Court made it clear the legislature never intended to \ndelegate such extraordinary power to one person. \n123.Let alone to delegate this power to the heavy hand of the executive branch under the \nIEMAA, which act is devoid of any procedural safeguards afforded to our citizens in the \nIDPHA. \n124. Pritzker has made no qualms about unleashing administrative agencies with \"tools\" to \nenforce his arbitraiy orders, which \"tools\" include potentially placing our citizens in \nhandcuffs and jailing them, all without due process oflaw. \n17 \n\n125. These actions by the executive branch show a complete disregard for the legislative and \njudicial branches of govemment. \n126. In this great state the rnle of law reigns supreme, and as such this Court should conclude \nthe legislature never granted the executive branch the power to issue orders to isolate and \nquarantine our citizens or to close our businesses under some implied interpretation of \nthe IEMAA. \n127. Such an interpretation would cause an injustice of inrmense proportions to our people \nand this Honorable Corui can safely presume the legislature intended no such purpose. \nRespectfully submitted, \nBy:  Isl Thomas Devore \nThomas G.

The  Illinois  Emergency  Management  Act  intended  by  device  to  delegate  certain \nenumerated powers upon the Office of Governor.  (See 20 ILCS 3305/2(a)(2)) \n7.  These certain enumerated powers with the Illinois Emergency Management Act included \ntemporaty emergency powers.  (See 20 ILCS 3305/7) \n8.  Of those enumerated temporary emergency powers delegated to the Office of Governor \nwas the power \"to control ingress and egress to and fi·om a disaster are, the movement of \npersons  within the  area,  and the occupancy  of the premises therein.  (See  20  ILCS \n3305/2(7)(8)) \n9.  The express language of the Illinois Emergency Management Act established a 30-day \nlimitation upon the emergency power provided for in 20 ILCS 3305/2(7)(8), which 30-\ndays began on the date of the proclamation of the disaster.  (See 20 ILCS 3305/7) \n10. The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the legislature's \nintent. Acme Markets, Inc. v. Callanan, 236 Ill.2d 29, 37, 337 Ill.Dec. 867, 923 N.E.2d 718 \n(2009). \n11. The best evidence of legislative intent is the language used in the statute itself, which must \nbe  given its plain and ordinaty meaning.  Roselle Police Pension Board v.  Village  of \nRoselle, 232 Ill.2d 546,552, 328 III.Dec. 942,905 N.E.2d 831 (2009); Am. Fed'n ofS tate \nv. State, Dep'tofCent. Mgmt. Servs., 33 N.E.3d 757 (Ill. App. 2015) \nARGUMENT \nI)  COVID-19 Pandemic is the disaster established on March 09,2020 \n2 \n\n12. The emergency powers granted Pritzker sprung forward as a result of his proclamation of \nthe existence of a disaster on March 09, 2020.  (See 20 ILCS 3305/7) \n13. The Illinois Emergency Management Act clearly defines a disaster: \n\"Disaster\" means an occunence or tln·eat of widespread or severe damage, injury \nor loss of life or property resulting fi·om any natural or techuological cause, \nincluding but not limited to fire, flood, earthquake, wind, storm, hazardous \nmaterials spill or other water contamination requiring emergency action to avert \ndanger or damage, epidemic, air contamination, blight, extended periods of severe \nand inclement weather, drought, infestation, critical shortages of essential fuels \nand energy, explosion, riot, hostile military or paramilitary action, public health \nemergencies, or acts of domestic tenorism.  (See 20 ILCS 3305/4) \n14. Pritzker's basis for the proclamation of March 09, 2020, is found in the last \"whereas\" \nclause wherein he  finds  the  conditions  enumerated therein regarding  the  COVID-19 \npandemic provided him legal justification of proclaiming a disaster. \n15. The Plaintiff does not contest Pritzker' s having declared that COVID-19 was a qualifying \ndisaster under the Illinois Emergency Management Act. \n16. Parsing the language of the Illinois Emergency Management Act as to what constitutes a \ndisaster under its definition in 20 ILCS 3305/4 clearly leads one to find COVID-19 was as \nof March 09, 2020 a disaster. \na)  an occunence or tin· eat \nb)  of widespread or severe damage, injury or loss of life or property \nc)  resulting from any natural or techuo1ogical cause, including but not limited to fire, \nflood, earthquake, wind, storm, hazardous materials spill or other water contamination \nd)  requiring emergency action to avert danger or damage, epidemic, air contamination, \nblight, extended periods of severe and inclement weather, drought, infestation, critical \nshortages of essential fuels and energy, explosion, riot, hostile militaty or pat·amilitaty \naction, public health emergencies, or acts of domestic tetTorism. \n3 \n\n17. The COVID-19 pandemic as of March 09, 2020 was certainly a (threat) of (widespread or \nsevere loss oflife) (resulting from a natural cause) and (requiring emergency action to avert \nan epidemic or public health emergency). \nII.  COVID-19 Pandemic is still the disaster which existed on April 01,2020 \n18. On April 01, 2020, Pritzker issued a second disaster proclamation. \n19. Pritzker acknowledges in the April 01,  2020 proclamation the basis for which he had \ndeclared a disaster on March 09, 2020 was COVID-19. \n20.  In the April 01, 2020 proclamation, declares a \"continuing disaster\" exists within the State \nof Illinois. \n21. Pritzker's basis for the proclamation of April 01, 2020, is found in the last \"whereas\" clause \nwherein he finds the conditions enumerated therein regarding the COVID-19 pandemic \nprovided him legal justification of proclaiming a disaster. \nIII) Pritzker's legislative delegation of emergency power regarding the disaster which arose \nas a result of the COVID-19 pandemic must have ceased on or before April 08, 2020. \n24) The Plaintiff does not contest Pritzker was delegated cetiain emergency powers as a result \nof the COVID-19 disaster proclamation. \n25) The COVID-19 disaster proclamation occuned on March 09, 2020. \n26) For 30-days subsequent to the disaster proclamation, Pritzker was authorized to exercise \nhis delegated authority to protect the health, safety and welfare of the people. \n27) The March 20, 2020 executive order restraining Bailey's rights of free movement within \nthe State of Illinois, regardless of substantive rights violations which may have existed, had \nto lapse on or before April 08, 2020 pursuant to the clear mandate of the legislature in the \nIllinois Emergency Management Act. \n4 \n\n28) The April 01, 2020 Proclamation declares a \"continuing disaster\" as a result of the same \nCOVID-19 pandemic. \n29) Priztker seemingly believes he can issue continuing proclamations recognizing the same \nCOVID-19 pandemic as a \"continuing disaster\" every thirty (30) days whereby he can \ncontinually invoke the emergency powers ofthe Illinois Emergency Management Act into \nperpetuity. \n30) As of April 23, 2020, at his 2:30 daily briefing to the public, Pritzker announced his \nintention to extend his emergency executive orders yet again. \n31) If the legislature intended to delegate to the Office of Governor the emergency powers for \nthe complete duration of a continuing disaster they would have written as much into the \nIllinois Emergency Management Act. \n32) The legislature intended to limit the use of the emergency powers by the Governor in the \nevent of disaster for a 30-day period as provided in the clear and unambiguous language of \nthe Illinois Emergency Management Act. \n33) The emergency powers granted to Office of Governor ensured a quick response to a disaster \nevent until such time as the legislature had ample time to convene and address whether any \nlaws need to be codified to further protect the health, safety and welfare of the people of \nthe State of Illinois. \n34) In fact, the legislature contemplated lapse of the emergency powers as provisions for such \nlapse are provided in 20 ILCS 3305/7. \n35) Relative to this cause, there has only been one disaster facing Pritzker and that is the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. \n36) Until such time as the legislature delegates continuing emergency powers to the Office of \n5 \n\nGovernor during a disaster, Bailey has a right to insist the emergency powers being utilized \nby Pritzker are limited to  the  30-days from the initial declaration of the  COVID-19 \npandemic. \n3 7) Any other interpretation of the relevant provision of the Illinois Emergency Management \nAct would render the 30-day limitation meaningless. \n3 8) Given the legislature has not acted to broaden the powers of the Office of Govemment \npursuant to the Illinois Emergency Management Act, Pritzker's powers provided therein \nhave long since lapsed. \n3 9) If additional legal safeguards are required to protect the good people of the State of Illinois \nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic, it is far past time for the legislative branch to act. \nRespectfully submitted, \nBy:  Is/ Thomas Devore \nThomas G.

On May 13, 2020, he \nfiled a first amended verified complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. \nIn his amended complaint, Bailey, a representative in the Illinois General Assembly suing \nsolely in his personal capacity as a citizen of Illinois, alleges that, by issuing continuing \ndisaster proclamations and executive orders more commonly known as “stay-home” \norders, Governor J.B. Pritzker exceeded his authority to exercise certain emergency \npowers granted to him under the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act, 20 ILCS \n§ 3305, et seq. Governor Pritzker timely removed the action to this Court on May 21, 2020, \ninvoking federal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3). Bailey immediately filed an \nemergency motion to remand (Doc. 7). The Court set an expedited briefing schedule, and \nthe matter is now fully briefed and ripe for ruling. \nPage 1 of 16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 30   Filed 06/29/20   Page 2 of 16   Page ID #477\nANALYSIS \n“Defendants may remove a ‘civil action’ from state court to the federal district \ncourt located in the place where such action is pending, as long as the federal district \ncourt had ‘original jurisdiction’ over the case.” Yassan v. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., 708 F.3d \n963, 968 (7th Cir. 2013)(quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a)). Governor Pritzker, as the party \nseeking removal, bears the burden of establishing that federal jurisdiction exists. See Doe \nv. Allied–Signal, Inc., 985 F.2d 908, 911 (7th Cir. 1993). There is a strong presumption in \nfavor of remand, and district courts must narrowly interpret removal statutes. Id. Doubts \nover jurisdiction should be resolved in favor of remand. Id. \nThe Court is guided by the principle that federal courts are courts of limited \njurisdiction, a function of the restrictions placed upon the federal judiciary both by the \nUnited States Constitution and by federal law. See Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of \nAmerica, 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994). It is a fundamental principle of federalism that federal \ncourts may hear only certain claims, such as those raising “federal questions” or “arising \nunder”  the  laws  of  the  United  States.  U.S.  CONST.  art.  III  §  2,  cl.  1.  While  “[t]his \nconstitutional grant of judicial authority is broad[,] . . . the Constitution gives Congress \nthe power to further refine the actual scope of federal jurisdiction.” International Union of \nOperating Engineers, Local 150, AFL-CIO v. Ward, 563 F.3d 276, 280 (7th Cir. 2009)(citing \nreferences and internal citations omitted). “Congress may not expand the jurisdiction of \nthe federal courts beyond the bounds established by the Constitution,” but it may impose \nstatutory limitations. See Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, 491 (1983).  \nA defendant may not remove a case to federal court unless, at the time of removal, \nPage 2 of 16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 30   Filed 06/29/20   Page 3 of 16   Page ID #478\na plaintiff’s complaint establishes that there is federal jurisdiction. See Franchise Tax Bd. of \nState of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern California, 463 U.S. 1, 10 \n(1983). Thus, the Court begins by considering the claims alleged in Bailey’s first amended \ncomplaint. Statements made or claims advanced prior to the filing of the first amended \ncomplaint, the operative complaint at the time of removal, bear no impact on whether \nfederal jurisdiction existed at the time of removal.  \nIn his first amended complaint, Bailey brings two types of claims: claims for \ndeclaratory relief and a claim for injunctive relief. He alleges that Governor Pritzker first \ndeclared the COVID-19 pandemic a disaster on March 9, 2020. The declaration, made \npursuant to the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act (“IEMAA”), labeled all 102 \ncounties in Illinois disaster areas, and, pursuant to emergency powers granted to him \nunder Illinois law, Governor Pritzker issued executive orders aimed at decreasing the \nspread of and reducing the loss of life caused by COVID-19, a severe, acute respiratory \ndisease, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus.  \nAccording to Bailey’s amended complaint, Governor Pritzker overstepped his \nauthority  by  failing  to  adhere  to  a  30-day  time  limit  on  his  authority  to  exercise \nemergency powers under the IEMAA. At the time the amended complaint was filed, \nBailey alleged that Governor Pritzker twice extended his initial disaster proclamation, \nfirst on April 1, 2020, and again on April 30, 2020, finding both times that the pandemic \nwas a continuing disaster. By mid-May, Bailey claims that the Governor had been relying \non his emergency powers for 81 days and that, in addition to exceeding the IEMAA \ntemporal limit, the exercise of powers usurped the delegation of authority by the Illinois \nPage 3 of 16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 30   Filed 06/29/20   Page 4 of 16   Page ID #479\nDepartment  of  Public  Health  to  local  health  departments  to  order  disease-related \nrestrictions like isolation and quarantines pursuant to rules promulgated under the \nIllinois Department of Public Health Act, 20 ILCS § 2305, et seq. (“IDPHA”). \nBailey seeks a declaratory judgment finding that the April 30, 2020 proclamation \nis void because, among other arguments, the IEMAA only grants Governor Pritzker the \npower to avert a public health emergency, not to manage it once it has occurred (Count \nI). He also seeks a declaratory judgment stating that Governor Pritzker had no authority \nto exercise his emergency powers under the IEMAA after April 8, 2020, the date when \nthe 30 day-period from the initial March 9, 2020 disaster proclamation ended (Count II). \nBailey further requests that a declaratory judgment be entered holding that the Illinois \nGeneral Assembly, through the IDPHA, gave supreme authority over the restriction of \ncitizens’ movements and business activity to the Department of Public Health when a \npublic health risk exists, that is, that the IDPHA alone governs when and how isolation \nand quarantine rules may be issued and enforced in Illinois (Count III). Finally, Bailey \nseeks injunctive relief preventing the Governor from issuing disaster proclamations that \ndo not comply with the IEMAA’s 30-day time limit and enjoining him from restricting \nmovement, activities, or business operations under the IEMAA (Count IV).  \nAs an initial note, this case does not take place in a vacuum. While the analysis \nmust be dispassionate, the Court recognizes the enormity of the issues raised by Bailey. \nThe Court is focused solely on the question of federal jurisdiction without consideration \nof the merits of Bailey’s claims, but the undersigned is cognizant that these are uncharted, \nturbulent times. The stakes are high on both sides of this litigation. There is no easy \nPage 4 of 16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 30   Filed 06/29/20   Page 5 of 16   Page ID #480\nbalance between protecting the public from a silent, fast-spreading, novel virus and \npreventing  great  social  upheaval  and  the  heavy  strain  of  economic  and  financial \nuncertainty. This District’s normal operations have been disrupted due to similar, albeit \nseparate, balancing concerns. Nevertheless, the Court must set all such concerns aside in \nweighing the question before it now. This is a routine function of the federal judiciary \nand one which the Court addresses daily, i.e., whether a complaint pleads a basis for \nfederal jurisdiction. That issue alone is before the Court. In this instance, in the interest of \nfederalism, the Court finds that the amended complaint does not give rise to federal \njurisdiction and that this action is best committed to the courts of the State of Illinois for \nfurther consideration. \nBailey argues that his complaint clearly raises no federal issues and vehemently \nattacks the Governor’s decision to remove this action as frivolous and taken in bad faith. \nWhile it may appear at first blush that no claim is raised under the United States \nConstitution or federal law, the question of whether federal jurisdiction exists presents a \nclose call. The amended complaint does not clearly state a statutory or constitutional basis \nfor each claim, which required the Court to expend significant time to properly categorize \neach claim.  \nTo a certain degree, the amended complaint could be read as raising constitutional \nclaims. In his reply, Bailey argues that his allegations are straightforward: “(a) Defendant \nissued certain proclamations, executive orders, and declarations; (b) the proclamations, \nexecutive orders, and declarations had the effect of restricting Plaintiff’s ability to travel, \nassociate with others, and practice his faith; and (c) Defendant had no statutory authority to \nPage 5 of 16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 30   Filed 06/29/20   Page 6 of 16   Page ID #481\ndo so.” (Doc. 25, p. 4) (emphasis added). The highlighted language demonstrates to the \nCourt that even Bailey acknowledges that at the core of his claims is an allegation that his \nconstitutional rights were violated by state action allegedly taken in violation of state law. \nHowever, the amended complaint does not single out Bailey’s rights under the Illinois \nConstitution.  Instead,  it  just  refers  to  various  rights  understood  to  be  secured  by \nconstitutional grants, both state and federal.  \nTo determine whether a complaint raises a federal issue, courts rely on the “well-\npleaded complaint” rule. That is, a plaintiff is the master of his complaint and, as such, \n“may include (or omit) claims or parties in order to determine the forum.” Garbie v. \nDaimlerChrysler Corp., 211 F.3d 407, 410 (7th Cir. 2000)(citing Caterpillar, Inc. v. Williams, \n482 U.S. 386, 392 (1987)). See also Bastien v. AT&T Wireless Servs., Inc., 205 F.3d 983, 986 \n(7th Cir. 2000)(noting that a plaintiff may “avoid federal jurisdiction by pleading only \nstate law claims[.]”). As the Supreme Court has stated, “the paramount policies embodied \nin the well-pleaded complaint rule . . . [are] that the plaintiff is the master of the complaint \n. . . and that the plaintiff may, by eschewing claims based on federal law, choose to have \nthe cause heard in state court.” Caterpillar, 482 U.S. at 398-399. To that end, it is not \nuncommon for a party to plead claims alleging violations solely of rights guaranteed by \na state’s constitution in order to avoid federal jurisdiction. But that clarity in pleading is \nmissing here, as the amended complaint references constitutional rights vaguely and in \npassing.  \nThe references to constitutional rights include rights that are recognized by both \nthe U.S. Constitution and the Illinois Constitution, and the amended complaint could, but \nPage 6 of 16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 30   Filed 06/29/20   Page 7 of 16   Page ID #482\ndoes not, specify that it seeks redress solely for violations of Bailey’s rights under the state \nconstitution. The argument that this is a case that clearly raises no federal claims is too \nconfidently stated. There is a federal right to travel secured by the U.S. Constitution, but \nthere also is a federal right to travel secured by the Illinois Constitution. See, e.g., ILCS \nCONST., Art. 1, § 2 (establishing due process protection and stating that “[n]o person shall \nbe deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law nor be denied the equal \nprotection of the laws.”). See also City of Chicago v. Morales, 687 N.E.2d 53, 64-65 (Ill. \n1997)(noting that general right to travel was protected by the due process clause). The \nFirst Amendment protects the right to free exercise of religion and the right to assemble, \nbut the Illinois Constitution protects those rights, as well. See ILCS CONST., Art. 1, § 3. \nEven  Bailey  acknowledges  that  his  allegations  are  fairly  framed  as  claiming  the \nGovernor’s alleged overreach restricted his ability to travel, associate with others, and \npractice his faith. It is a fair reading by Governor Pritzker to conclude that Bailey’s claims \nare couched in constitutional terms and may be constitutional claims.  \nThat  said,  the  Court  recognizes  that  Illinois  has  an  independent  declaratory \njudgment statute that creates a cause of action for challenging statutory or executive \noverreach. The Illinois declaratory judgment statute states:  \nThe court may, in cases of actual controversy, make binding declarations of \nrights,  having  the  force  of  final  judgments,  whether  or  not  any \nconsequential relief is or could be claimed, including the determination, at \nthe instance of anyone interested in the controversy, of the construction of \nany statute municipal,  ordinance, or other governmental regulation. \n  \n735 ILCS § 5/2-701(a). To sustain a declaratory judgment action in Illinois, courts require \na showing of “(1) a plaintiff with a legal tangible interest; (2) a defendant having an \nPage 7 of 16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 30   Filed 06/29/20   Page 8 of 16   Page ID #483\nopposing interest; and (3) an actual controversy between the parties concerning such \ninterests.” Hess v. Miller, 133 N.E.3d 1235, 1242 (Ill. Ct. App. 2019)(quoting Beahringer v. \nPage, 789 N.E.2d 1216, 1223 (Ill. 2003)). In Illinois, declaratory judgment actions are \n“purely statutory” and are “to be liberally construed.” Beahringer, 789 N.E.2d at 373. They \nalso may be brought against a governor seeking declarations that executive orders are \nunconstitutional or contrary to state law. See, e.g., Caro v. Whitaker, 898 N.E.2d 1110, 1113 \n(noting that without the governor as a defendant, the plaintiff did not allege a declaratory \njudgment action challenging his authority to act).  \nBailey does not cite the declaratory judgment statute in his amended complaint, \nand the briefs by the parties do not address it. Nevertheless, the Court finds that the most \nstraightforward reading of Bailey’s claims is that they are brought pursuant to this Illinois \nstatute and not as constitutional claims. Despite the omission of a statutory reference, \nBailey alleges the elements of a claim under the statute, namely that he and Governor \nPritzker have opposing interests related to an actual controversy and that a court has the \npower to make a declaration to resolve, at least in part, the dispute. While rights secured \nby the U.S. Constitution are impacted by the orders and proclamations at issue, they are \nnot central to any claim for a declaratory statement from the courts on the bounds of \nIllinois statutory and constitutional grants of authority to a governor under the Illinois \ndeclaratory judgment statute. The question remains, then, whether any statutory grant of \njurisdiction covers claims like those raised by Bailey for declaratory relief based on a \nviolation of state law by a state actor.  \nThe Constitution’s grant of jurisdiction, as narrowed by Congress, is codified in \nPage 8 of 16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 30   Filed 06/29/20   Page 9 of 16   Page ID #484\nvarious statutes including 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3), which Governor Pritzker invokes as the \nbasis for federal jurisdiction here. Bailey, on the other hand, argues that the principles of \n28 U.S.C. § 1331 apply.1 Despite strong arguments to the contrary, the Governor is \nadamant that the plain language of Section 1343(a)(3) provides the jurisdictional hook for \nthis action. By its plain language, Section 1343(a)(3) states: \n(a) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action \nauthorized by law to be commenced by any person:  \n. . . \n(3) To redress the deprivation, under color of any State law, statute, \nordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any right, privilege or \nimmunity secured by the Constitution of the United States or by any \nAct of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens or of all persons \nwithin the jurisdiction of the United States [.] \n \n28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3). By comparison, pursuant to Section 1331 “district courts shall have \noriginal jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of \nthe United States.” \nPrior  to  1980,  Section  1331  had  an  amount  in  controversy  requirement,  but \nCongress amended the statute and removed the requirement. See Pub. L. No. 96-486, 94 \nStat. 2369 (1980). In dicta, the Seventh Circuit explained the relationship between claims \nunder Section 1343(a)(3) and claims under Section 1331: \nSection 1343(a)(3) covers only civil rights claims against state actors and has \nhad no legal effect since 1975, when Congress amended § 1331 to eliminate \nany amount-in-controversy requirement. (The point of § 1343(a)(3) had \nbeen to allow civil-rights suits without regard to the amount in controversy. \nSee Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, 441 U.S. 600, 99 S. Ct. \n1905, 60 L.Ed.2d 508 (1979)). \n \n1   The United States of America filed a statement of interest pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 517. (Doc. 15). \nThe Court carefully reviewed the brief in support of Bailey’s motion. As the arguments raised by the United \nStates do not differ drastically in substance from those raised by Bailey, the position of the United States \nwill not be addressed separately in this Order.   \nPage 9 of 16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 30   Filed 06/29/20   Page 10 of 16   Page ID #485\n \nMyles v. United States, 416 F.3d 551, 554 (7th Cir. 2005). While the statement is dicta, it is a \nclear statement of the law that is relied upon by courts throughout this Circuit as \ndemonstrating that Section 1343 is widely understood to provide federal jurisdiction for \ncivil rights claims, as opposed to creating a jurisdictional grant over claims that are not \ncovered  by  Section  1331.  It  also  comports  with  similar  decisions  about  jurisdiction \npursuant to Section 1343 in civil rights cases. See, e.g., Hickey v. Duffy, 827 F.2d 234, 241 \n(7th  Cir.  1987)(stating  that  “Section  1983  established  a  remedy  for  state  officials’ \nviolations of law as well as violations of the Constitution, but it did not create an \nopportunity to litigate these claims in federal court. The jurisdictional provisions of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1871, now found in § 1343, were limited to claims ‘secured by the \nConstitution.’”); Roden v. American Federation of State, County, and Mun. Employees, Council \n24, No. 08-2578, 2009 WL 40001 at *2 (7th Cir. Jan. 8, 2009)(citing to Myles and stating that \nSection 1343 “grants jurisdiction to district courts to hear certain civil-rights claims” and \nprovides  “overlapping”  jurisdiction  with  §  1331  for  “civil-rights  claims”);  Savage  v. \nPremier Bank of Jacksonville, No. 19-CV-3201, 2019 WL 4418528 at *2 (C.D. Ill. Sept. 16, \n2019)(citing to Myles and stating that “Section 1343(a)(3) ‘covers only civil rights claims \nagainst state actors’” and further noting the statute has had no effect since Section 1331 \nwas amended to eliminate the amount in controversy requirement.). \n  The Governor asserts that the opinions of two federal appellate courts and one \nfederal district court support the argument that  Section 1343(a)(3) permits a district court \nto exercise original jurisdiction over causes of actions that assert non-federal claims, so \nPage 10 of 16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 30   Filed 06/29/20   Page 11 of 16   Page ID #486\nlong as those claims seek to redress the deprivation of rights secured by the Constitution. \n(Doc. 24, p. 8). This is in contrast to cases removed under Section 1331, which covers only \nclaims that arise under federal law. The Governor’s cited authorities, however, do not \nsupport such an argument. For example, the Governor references the phrase “any civil \naction authorized by law” in Section 1343(a)(3). The Governor then relies on Rodriguez v. \nComas, 888 F.2d 899 (1st Cir. 1989), where the First Circuit stated that jurisdiction under \nSection 1343(a) was “open-ended – applying to any person and over any civil action.” Id. \nat 906. However, the phrase is taken out of context, as the First Circuit merely was \ncomparing the jurisdictional scope of Section 1343(a) with that of Section 1346(b), the \nlatter of which conferred jurisdiction on the district court over certain cases where the \nUnited States was named as a defendant.  Id.   \nThe Governor also relies on Campbell v. Gadsden v. County Dist. Sch. Bd., 534 F.2d \n650 (5th Cir. 1976), but such reliance is misplaced. The Fifth Circuit noted that the phrase \n“civil  action  authorized  by  law”  in  Section  1343(a)(3)  means  that  “jurisdiction  is \nunavailable in the absence of an appropriate cause of action.” Id. at 655. The Fifth Circuit \nwent on to state that “failure to state a claim under sections 1981, 1983 and 1985 or other \nappropriate legal authority has the effect of depriving federal courts of subject matter \njurisdiction under 1343.” Id. The Fifth Circuit thus makes clear that the phrase “civil \naction authorized by law” is not as “open ended” so as to provide for a jurisdictional \ngrant over claims not covered under Section 1331, as the Governor believes it to be. \nInstead, Section 1343 requires the existence of an appropriate cause of action authorized \nby federal law, which, consistent with the authorities cited above, are limited to civil \nPage 11 of 16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 30   Filed 06/29/20   Page 12 of 16   Page ID #487\nrights claims. See, e.g., Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, 441 U.S. 600, 618 \n(1979)(noting that where the underlying statute is not a civil rights statute, Section 1983 \nneeds to be invoked in order to support jurisdiction under Section 1343). \nFurthermore, the Governor relies on Spaulding v. Mingo County Bd. of Educ., 897 F. \nSupp. 284 (S.D. W.Va. 1995) for the proposition that jurisdiction is proper under Section \n1343(a)(3) “even where an asserted right or privilege may be concurrently protected by \nthe U.S. Constitution and a state constitutional or statutory provision[.]” (Doc. 24, p. 12). \nIn Spaulding, the parents originally brought suit in West Virginia state court alleging \nviolations of the West Virginia Constitution and West Virginia Human Rights Act, as well \nas other state law claims. The parents alleged that their daughter was discriminated \nagainst based on her disability by various educational agencies and their representatives.  \nThe matter was removed to federal court and the district court addressed its jurisdiction \nunder Section 1343(a)(3). The court held that it did have jurisdiction, but it did so by \nrelying on the “artful pleading” doctrine which provides that “a plaintiff cannot defeat \nremoval by omitting an essential federal question from the complaint.” Id. at 288. The \ncourt reasoned that the parents essentially pleaded but purposely omitted federal claims \nunder the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”) and the Rehabilitation \nAct in order to defeat removal. Id. Thus, the court concluded that the two federal statutes \nprovided  the  jurisdictional  hook  it  needed  to  exercise  jurisdiction  under  Section \n1343(a)(3). This permitted the district court to exercise jurisdiction over the other state \nlaw claims pursuant to its supplementary jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367. \nPage 12 of 16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 30   Filed 06/29/20   Page 13 of 16   Page ID #488\nMore importantly, despite finding that it had jurisdiction, the court ultimately \nopted to exercise its discretion and remand the case back to state court.  See Spaulding, 897 \nF. Supp. at 289. The court noted that remand was appropriate, even if there were putative \nfederal claims, “where the crux of the action rests in the construction and application of \nstate law[.]” Id. The court relied on factors such as whether the majority of claims were \ngrounded in state law, whether the federal constitutional claims were closely related to \nstate constitutional claims, and whether the federal law claims were tied to the state law \nclaims. Id. (internal quotations and citations omitted). Accordingly, the court remanded \nthe case reasoning that the state claims predominated over any putative federal claim, \nthe claims raised complex issues of state law, the state courts had concurrent jurisdiction \nover the putative federal claims, and there was a need to respect the parents’ original \nchoice of forum. Id.  \nHere,  even  if  the  Court  found  that  jurisdiction  was  proper  under  Section \n1343(a)(3), which it does not, the same considerations for remand in Spaulding would \nlikewise apply to the instant case.  Clearly, the crux of the instant dispute is the scope of \nthe Governor’s power under the statutory scheme established by the Illinois legislature. \nAnd, although federal constitutional rights may be impacted, it is ultimately incidental \nto the issue of whether the Governor exceeded those powers, which is a matter governed \nsolely by state law.  Furthermore, to the extent that Bailey is asserting the violation of his \nfederal constitutional rights, those same rights are protected by the Illinois Constitution, \nand thus, such claims are closely related.  Finally, in the absence of any purported federal \nclaim predominating this case, Bailey’s original choice of forum should be respected.  \nPage 13 of 16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 30   Filed 06/29/20   Page 14 of 16   Page ID #489\nIn any event, despite Spaulding’s construction of Section 1343(a)(3), it is not binding \non this Court. Rather, the Court chooses to follow the interpretation of Section 1343(a)(3) \nas provided for by the Seventh Circuit in dicta in Myles and as described above. That dicta \nstates that Section 1343(a)(3) has had no legal effect since 1975, which is when Congress \neliminated the amount-in-controversy requirement from Section 1331. See Myles, 416 F.3d \nat 554. \nThe Governor responds to Myles by noting that to follow it would result in the \nimplicit repeal of Section 1343, which is disfavored in the law.  However, this is not to say \nthat Section 1343 has been repealed, by implication or otherwise. Rather, it is redundant \nnow that Section 1331 confers jurisdiction without respect to the amount in controversy, \nnegating the need for “many of the specific grants of jurisdiction.” ERWIN CHEMERINSKY, \nFEDERAL JURISDICTION 267, 267 n.5 (5th Ed. 2007)(stating that “[f]or example, 28 U.S.C. § \n1343 creates subject matter jurisdiction for civil rights cases. The jurisdictional provision \nwas important because of the difficulty of ascertaining the monetary value of civil rights \nand liberties. However, the elimination of the amount in controversy requirement in § \n1331 made § 1343 superfluous”). A broad reading of Bailey’s complaint could allow the \nCourt to find he states a claim for redress of a deprivation of a right secured by the \nConstitution, as discussed above, but the Court finds that the amended complaint stops \njust short of doing so.  \nFurther, if the broader jurisdictional grant of Section 1331 does not reach Bailey’s \nclaims, then the narrower reach of Section 1343 ought not confer federal jurisdiction \neither. Governor Pritzker raises a number of other arguments as to why Section 1343(a)(3) \nPage 14 of 16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 30   Filed 06/29/20   Page 15 of 16   Page ID #490\nconfers jurisdiction, but the Court declines to address each one individually because it is \nclear that it would be judicial overreach to read Bailey’s claims as federal civil rights \nclaims subject to Section 1343’s jurisdictional grant. To so find would expand federal \njurisdiction to cover claims against state actors for violating state laws in the absence of a \nclearly-pleaded  claim  that  the  state  action  violated  or  implicated  the  United  States \nConstitution or an Act of Congress. As such, this case shall be remanded to state court for \nadjudication.  \nREQUEST FOR JUST COSTS AND EXPENSES \nIn his emergency motion to remand, Bailey asks the Court to order the Governor \nto pay his reasonable fees and costs incurred during the period of time this action was \npending in this court. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c), “[a]n order remanding [a] case may \nrequire payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred \nas the result of the removal.” The Seventh Circuit has made clear that Section 1447(c) “is \nnot a sanctions rule; it is a fee-shifting statute, entitling the district court to make whole \nthe  victorious  party.”  Garbie  v.  DaimlerChrysler,  Corp.,  211  F.3d  407,  410  (7th  Cir. \n2000)(emphasis  in  original).  “Absent  unusual  circumstances,  courts  may  award \nattorney’s fees under § 1447(c) only where the removing party lacked an objectively \nreasonable basis for seeking removal.” Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp., 546 U.S. 132, 141 \n(2005). The Seventh Circuit directs courts to consider whether, “at the time the defendant \nfiled his notice in federal court, clearly established law demonstrated that he had no basis \nfor removal,” likening the analysis to one made under the qualified immunity doctrine. \nLott v. Pfizer, Inc., 492 F.3d 789, 793 (7th Cir. 2007).  \nPage 15 of 16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 30   Filed 06/29/20   Page 16 of 16   Page ID #491\n  Bailey vigorously argues that Governor Pritzker’s decision to remove this case was \nfrivolous and in bad faith, but the Court disagrees. The removal was timely. The face of \nthe complaint arguably seeks to vindicate constitutional rights, like the right to travel and \nthe right to free exercise of religion, without specifying that it refers only to rights secured \nby  the  Illinois  Constitution.  The  Court  seriously  considered  whether  Bailey \nunintentionally pleaded himself into federal jurisdiction by raising a claim under the \nUnited States Constitution with this lack of specificity, and the decision in his favor was \na close call. As such, the Court does not find that Governor Pritzker lacked an objectively \nreasonable basis for seeking removal. Thus, the Court will not award any fees under \nSection 1447(c).  \nCONCLUSION \n  For the above-stated reasons, Plaintiff’s emergency motion to remand (Doc. 7) is \nGRANTED. It is hereby ORDERED that, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c), this action be \nREMANDED to the Circuit Court for the Fourth Judicial Circuit, Clay County, Illinois. \nNo fees or costs are awarded. The Clerk of Court is DIRECTED to transmit a certified \ncopy of this Order to the clerk of the state court, and thereafter to CLOSE this case.  \n  IT IS SO ORDERED.  Digitally signed \nby Judge Sison \n  Dated:  June 29, 2020.  Date: 2020.06.29 \n16:57:45 -05'00'\n                ______________________________ \n                GILBERT C.

The IEMAA states: \"In the event of a disaster, as defined in Section 4, the Governor \nmay by proclamation declare that a disaster exists.\"  (See 20 ILCS 3305/7) \n6.  Section 4 of The Act defines a disaster as follows: \n\"Disaster\" means an occurrence or threat of widespread or severe damage, injury \nor loss  of life or property resulting  from  any  natural  or technological  cause, \nincluding  but  not  limited  to  fire,  flood,  earthquake,  wind,  storm,  hazardous \nmaterials spill or other water contamination requiring emergency action to avert \ndanger or damage, epidemic, air contamination, blight, extended periods of severe \nand inclement weather, drought, infestation, critical shortages of essential fuels and \nenergy,  explosion,  riot,  hostile  military  or  paramilitary  action,  public  health \nemergencies, or acts of domestic terrorism.  (See 20 ILCS 3305/4) \n7.  In COVID#l, Pritzker states the COVID-19 virus is a novel severe acute respiratory \nillness. (See 2nd whereas clause ofCOVID#l) \n8.  In COVID#l, Pritzker determined the respiratory illness not to be a disaster but to \nbe a currently existing \"public health emergency.\" (See 15th whereas clause of COVID# I.) \n9.  In COVID#l, Pritzker declared all 102 counties within Illinois a disaster area as a \nresult of COVID-19. (See Section I of COVID# I) \n10.  Under the auspices of COVID#l, Pritzker utilized his emergency powers wherein \nhe issued various executive orders. \n11.  On April 01, 2020, Pritzker issued another disaster proclamation. (See Exhibit 2 \nhereinafter referred to as \"COVID#2\") \n12.  In COVID#2, Pritzker states the COVID-19 virus is novel severe acute respiratory \nillness. (See I st whereas clause of COVID#2) \n13.  In COVID#2, Pritzker found COVID-19 is a public health emergency. (See 15th \nwhereas clause ofCOVID#2.) \n14.  As such in COVID#2, Pritzker declares the COVID-19 illness to be a  \"continuing \ndisaster\".  (See Section I of COVID#2.) \n2 \n\n15.  Because he construed COVID#2 as a continuing proclamation of disaster, Pritzker \nfurther declared a continuation of his authority to wield the emergency powers of section 7 of the \nIEMAA.  (See Section 1 ofCOVID#2.) \n16.  As  a result of COVID#2,  Pritzker utilized his emergency powers wherein he \nexecuted and continued various executive orders from that time through and including April 30, \n2020. \n17.  On April  30, 2020, Pritzker issued yet another proclamation of disaster.  (See \nExhibit 3 hereinafter referred to as COVID#3.) \n18.  In COVID#3, Pritzker states the COVID-19 virus is novel severe acute respiratory \nillness. (See 3rd whereas clause of COVID#3.) \n19.  Yet again, Pritzker acknowledges in COVID#3 that COVID-19 is a current public \nhealth emergency. (See whereas clause 52 and 53 in COVID#3.) \n20.  As  a result of COVID#3,  Pritzker utilized his emergency powers wherein he \nexecuted and continued various executive orders until May 31, 2020. \n21.  As a result ofCOVID#l, COVID#2 and COVID#3, Pritzker is attempting to wield \nthe emergency powers under the IEMAA for approximately 81 days. \n22.  The very occurrence for which Pritzker found a disaster existed in COVID#l, \nCOVID#2 and COVID#3 was the exact same novel severe acute respiratory illness. \n23.  COVID#2 and COVID#3 were both issued for exact 30-day periods. \n24.  Subsequent  to  a  proper  disaster  proclamation,  the  IEMAA  confers  specific \nenumerated powers upon the Governor of the State of Illinois.  (See 20 ILCS 3305/2(a)(2).) \n25.  Amongst  those  enumerated  powers  are  fourteen  (14)  emergency  powers  as \nprovided in section 7 of The Act.  (See 20 ILCS 3 3 05/7) \n3 \n\n26.  Section 7 of the IEMAA expressly states: \"Upon such proclamation, the Governor \nshall have and may exercise for a period not to exceed 30 days the following emergency powers .... \n(See 20 ILCS 3305/7) \n27.  As  a  result  of Proclamation  #3,  Pritzker  issued  Executive  Order  2020-32 \n(hereinafter \"EO 32\").  (See Exhibit 4) \n28.  As alleged authority to issue EO 32, Pritzker relies on two authorities: \na)  Powers vested in him as the Governor of the State of Illinois. \nb)  Sections 7(1), 7(2), 7(3), 7(8), 7(9) and 7(12) of the IEMAA. \n(See the \"THEREFORE\" clause on page 2 ofEO 32) \n29.  Pritzker further states the emergency powers exercised in EO 32 were consistent \nwith public health laws. (See the \"THEREFORE\" clause on page 2 of EO 32) \n30.  Upon information and belief,  the public health laws which Pritzker states are \nconsistent with his authority in EO 32 is assuredly the Illinois Department of Public Health Act, \nbeing 20 ILCS 2305 et seq. (hereinafter referred to as \"IDPHA\") (See the \"THEREFORE\" clause \non page 2 ofEO 32) \n31.  IDPHA provides for general supervision of the interests of the health and lives of \nthe people of the State.  (See 20 ILCS 2305/2(a)) \n32.  Under the  IDPHA,  the  Department  of Public  Health (the  \"Department\")  has \nsupreme authority in matters of quarantine and isolation.  Id. (Emphasis Added) \n33.  The Department may declare and enforce quarantine and isolation, when none \nexists, and may modify or relax quarantine and isolation when it has been established.  Id. \n34.  Subject to the provisions of subsection (c ) , the Department may order a person or \ngroup of persons to be quarantined or isolated or may order a place to be closed and made off \n4 \n\nlimits to the public to prevent the probable spread of a dangerously contagious or infectious \ndisease, including non-compliant tuberculosis patients, until such time as the condition can be \ncorrected or the danger to the public health eliminated or reduced in such a manner that no \nsubstantial danger to the public's health any longer exists. (See 20 ILCS 2305/2(b).) \n35.  The IDPHA specifically admonishes that no person or a group of persons may be \nordered to be quarantined or isolated and no place may be ordered to be closed and made off limits \nto the public except with the consent of the person or owner of the place or upon the prior order of \na court of competent jurisdiction.  (See 20 ILCS 2305/2( c) . ) \n36.  The  Department may,  however,  order  a  person  or  a group  of persons  to  be \nquarantined or isolated or may order a place to be closed and made off limits to the public on an \nimmediate basis without prior consent or court order if,  in the  reasonable judgment of the \nDepartment, immediate action is required to protect the public from a dangerously contagious or \ninfectious disease.  Id. \n37.  In the event of an immediate order issued without prior consent or court order, the \nDepartment shall, as soon as practical, within 48 hours after issuing the order, obtain the consent \nof the person or owner or file  a petition requesting a court order authorizing the isolation or \nquarantine or closure. Id. \n38.  To obtain a court order for isolation, quarantine, or closure, the Department, by \nclear and convincing evidence, must prove that the public's health and welfare are significantly \nendangered by a person or group of persons that has, that is suspected of having, that has been \nexposed to, or that is reasonably believed to have been exposed to a dangerously contagious or \ninfectious disease or by a place where there is a significant amount of activity likely to spread a \ndangerously contagious or infectious disease.  Id. \n5 \n\n3 9.  The Department must also prove that all other reasonable means of correcting the \nproblem have been exhausted and no less restrictive alternative exists. Id. \n40.  Persons who are or are about to be ordered to be isolated or quarantined and owners \nof places that are or are about to be closed and made off limits to the public shall have the right to \ncounsel. Id. \n41.  Persons who are ordered to be isolated or quarantined or who are owners of places \nthat are ordered to be closed and made off limits to the public, shall be given a written notice of \nsuch order. Id. \n42.  The written notice shall additionally include the following: (1) notice of the right \nto counsel; (2) notice that ifthe person or owner is indigent, the court will appoint counsel for that \nperson or owner; (3) notice of the reason for the order for isolation, quarantine, or closure; ( 4) \nnotice of whether the order is an immediate order, and if so, the time frame for the Department to \nseek consent or to file a petition requesting a court order as set out in this subsection; and ( 5) notice \nof the anticipated duration of the isolation, quarantine, or closure. Id. \n4 3.  Because the Department is an agency of the State of Illinois and because Pritzker \nis the chief executive officer of the State of Illinois, upon information and belief, Pritzker is \nfamiliar with and charged with knowledge of the IDPHA. \n44.  Pritzker  is  also  familiar  with  and  charged with  knowledge  of the  Plan  and \nadministrative rules of the Department attached herein.  (See Exhibits 5 and 6 respectively) \n45.  The Plan, consistent with relevant provisions of state law provides: \n\"[The Department] is authorized to order a person to be quarantined or isolated or \na place to be closed and made off limits to the public to prevent the probable spread \nof a dangerously contagious or infectious disease until such time as the condition \nmay be corrected or the danger to the public health eliminated or reduced in such a \nmanner that no substantial danger to the public's health any longer exists (20 ILCS \n2305/2(b)). No person may be ordered to be quarantined or isolated and no place \n6 \n\nmay be ordered to be closed and made off limits to the public, however, except with \nthe consent of the person or the owner of the place or upon the order of a court of \ncompetent jurisdiction (20 ILCS 2305/2( c) ). In order to obtain a court order, IDPH \nmust prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the public's health and welfare \nare  significantly endangered and  all  other reasonable means of correcting the \nproblem have been exhausted and no less restrictive alternative exists (20 ILCS \n2305/2(c)).\"  (See Page 71 of The Plan.) \n46.  The Department has explicitly delegated its authority to order isolation, quarantine \nand closure to certified local health departments. (See Page 71 of The Plan.) (Emphasis Added) \n47.  The IDPHA generally defines quarantine as restricting the movement of people or \nrestricting their activities. \n48.  IDPH's promulgated administrative rules regarding procedural safeguards must be \nfollowed when restricting the movements or activities of the people, or closing businesses, to \ncontrol disease spread.  (See Exhibit 6.). \n49.  The board of health of each county or multiple-county health department shall: \na)  Within its jurisdiction, and professional and technical competence, enforce and \nobserve all State laws pertaining to the preservation of health ..... See 55 ILCS \n5/5-25013 (A)(6). \nb)  Within its jurisdiction, and professional and technical competence, investigate \nthe existence of any contagious or infectious disease and adopt measures, not \ninconsistent with the regulations of the State Department of Public Health ... \nSee 55 ILCS 5/5-25013 (A)(7). \nCOUNT I \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT FINDING \nTHE APRIL 30 PROCLAMATION IS VOID FOR FAILING TO \nMEET THE DEFINITION OF A DISASTER AS DEFINED IN THE IEMAA \n50.  Plaintiff incorporates paragraphs 1-49 as if more fully stated herein. \n7 \n\n51.  In the event of a disaster, as defined in Section 4, the Governor may, by \nproclamation declare that a disaster exists. (See 20 ILCS 3305/7) \n52.  Section 4 defines a disaster as follows: \n\"Disaster\" means an occurrence or threat of widespread or severe damage, injury \nor loss  of life  or property resulting from any  natural  or technological  cause, \nincluding  but  not  limited  to  fire,  flood,  earthquake,  wind,  storm,  hazardous \nmaterials spill or other water contamination requiring emergency action to avert \ndanger or damage, epidemic, air contamination, blight, extended periods of severe \nand inclement weather, drought, infestation, critical shortages of essential fuels and \nenergy,  explosion,  riot,  hostile  military  or  paramilitary  action,  public  health \nemergencies, or acts of domestic terrorism.\" \n53.  Thus, under Section 4, a \"disaster\" exists only if there is an occurrence or threat \nrequiring emergency action to avert its effects. \n54.  For purposes of this action, Bailey does not dispute that on March 09, 2020 when \nPritzker issued COVID# 1 an occurrence or threat of a widespread natural cause which could cause \nloss oflife existed and as such there was a requirement of emergency action to avert a public health \nemergency. \n55.  In order to trigger executive authority under the IEMAA, the proposed emergency \naction by the executive must be necessary to avert the danger or damage or epidemic~ \n56.  However, COVID#2 which is ostensibly predicated on the same provision of the \nIEMAA, the same independent analysis applies, as only in the event of a disaster, as defined in \nSection 4, may the Governor by proclamation declare that a disaster exists. (See 20 ILCS 3305/7) \n57.  Once  again,  as  defined  in the  IEMAA,  a  disaster  by  definition must require \nemergency action to avert, inter alia, a public health emergency. \n58.  Pritzker  states  in  COVID#2  \"based  upon  the  foregoing,  the  circumstances \nsurrounding COVID-19 constitute a continuing public health emergency under section 4 of the \nIEMAA\" (See 12'h whereas of COVID #2) \n8 \n\n59.  On April 30, 2020, Pritzker signed COVID#3. \n60.  The analysis concerning the triggering of executive authority applies equally to \nCOVID#3.  In other words, the prerequisite to a disaster declaration under the IEMAA is the \nnecessity of action to avert, inter alia, a public health emergency. \n61.  As the ever-increasing amount of ink is consumed with each serial proclamation, \nthe relevant provision can be found at the  whereas clause on page 4 of COVID#3.  It states in \n9th \nrelevant part: \"the current circumstances in Illinois surrounding the spread of COVID-19 constitute \nan epidemic emergency and a public health emergency under section 4 of the IEMAA.\" \n62.  Since it purports to restrict his rights and interests, Bailey has a right to insist \nCOVID#3, which declared a disaster, was within the authority granted Pritzker by the legislature. \n63.  Contrary to Pritzker' contention in COVID#3, Section 4 of the IEMAA does not \ndefine what constitutes an epidemic or a public health emergency. \n64.  As such, the emergency powers of Section 7 of the IEMAA can only be invoked to \ntry and prevent or ward off those enumerated matters such as a public health emergency. \n65.  Pritzker admits in COVID#2 and COVID#3 that COVID-19 constitutes a then-\nexisting public health emergency. \n66.  Given Pritzker's express acknowledgment in COVID#3 on April 30, 2020 that a \npublic health emergency then existed, it is impossible for him to legally declare a disaster. \n67.  By definition, Pritzker could only declare a disaster in regard to the COVID-19 \nvirus if emergency action was required to avert a public health emergency. \n68.  Pritzker admits the public health emergency exists and makes it clear he is engaging \nin numerous efforts to manage the existing public health emergency. \n9 \n\n69.  However, Pritzker cannot declare a disaster to manage a then present public health \nemergency as such acts are beyond the powers granted him by the legislature. \n70.  Bailey has a right to insist COVID#3 which declared a disaster was within the \nauthority granted Pritzker by the legislature. \n71.  An actual controversy exists between the parties in regard to the authority of \nPritzker to issue and enforce his executive orders 'and proclamations which have the effect of \nrestricting Bailey's movements and preventing Bailey from attending worship services. \n72.  An immediate and definitive determination is necessary to clarify the rights and \ninterests of the parties. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Darren Bailey, herein requests that this court enter an Order: \nA.  declaring Pritzker admitted in COVID#2 that a public health emergency existed on \nthat date; \nB.  declaring Pritzker admitted in COVID#3 that a public health emergency existed on \nthat date; \nC.  declaring that Section 4 of the IEMAA defines a disaster exists only when it \nrequires emergency powers to avert a public health emergency; \nD.  finding COVID#3 is void ab initio as no disaster existed on that date as defined in \nSection 4 of the IEMAA; \nE.  finding that any emergency powers under Section 7 of the IEMAA which were \ninvoked in EO 32 are null and void ab initio; \nF.  Awarding Bailey his costs incurred in this matter as may be allowed by law; \nG.  That the Court grant such other and further relief as is just and proper. \n10 \n\nCOUNT II \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT FINDING PRITZKER HAD NO \nAUTHORITY TO UTILIZE EMERGENCY POWERS AFTER APRIL 08, 2020 \n73.  Bailey restates paragraphs 1-72 as if more fully stated herein. \n74.  Upon such proclamation, the Governor shall have and may exercise for a period \nnot to exceed 30 days the following emergency powers.  (See 20 ILCS 3305/7) \n75.  Pritzker has by devise been exercising emergency powers under Section 7 of the \nIEMAA since March 09, 2020. \n76.  Pritzker has issued serial proclamations from March 09, 2020 through April 30, \n2020. \n77.  Each time  he  issues  a  new proclamation,  he  contemporaneously  issues  new \nexecutive order( s) under the emergency power of section 7 of the IEMAA. \n78.  Notwithstanding there is no 30-day requirement under the IEMAA as to disaster \nproclamations,  Pritzker  has  included  arbitrary  30-day  deadlines  in  COVID#l,  COVID#2, \nCOVID#3. \n79.  In each and every disaster proclamation, Pritzker refers to the same COVID-19 \nvirus as the genesis of his proclaiming a disaster. \n80.  The  IEMAA  has  no  such  requirement  regarding  any  termination  date  m  a \nproclamation of disaster. \n81.  Upon information and belief, Governor Rauner was the first Governor who placed \narbitrary 30-day deadlines in his disaster proclamations. \n82.  Upon information and belief, Governor Rauner never issued back to back 30-day \nproclamations. \n11 \n\n83.  Upon information and belief, Pritzker is the first Governor of this state to issue \nserial proclamations back to back for the purpose of energizing the 3 0-day emergency powers to \nattempt to  seize control the movement and  activities  of the people,  and forcible  closure  of \nbusinesses, of the entire State of Illinois. \n84.  Among these emergency powers, Pritzker has taken unilateral control over the \nmovement and livelihood of every citizen in the State. \n85.  The legislative branch during this period of executive rule under the emergency \npowers has been rendered meaningless. \n86.  In this Court on April 27, 2020, the Illinois Attorney General's office, on behalf of \nPritzker, took the position that a clear reading of Section 7 leaves only one conclusion and that is \nthe proclamation gives rise to the 30 day emergency powers and that as long as a proclama,_tion is \ndone in good faith then there is no limit the duration of the emergency powers extensions that can \nbe had as long as a new proclamation issued. \n87.  That is a precarious proposition given each serial proclamation is for the exact same \noccurrence which gave rise to the initial proclamation. \n88.  What is even more precarious is an Illinois Attorney General opinion exists which \nglaringly contradicts the proposition of Pritzker.  (See Exhibit 7) \n89.  On or about July 02, 2001, Attorney General Jim Ryan was presented this very \nquestion by then acting Director of the Illinois Emergency Management Authority. \n90.  Attorney General Ryan, and his staff, properly acknowledged he must attempt to \ngive meaning to the expressed intent of the legislature and to avoid construction that would render \nany portion void.  (Pg. 5 of Exhibit 8) \n12 \n\n91.  Attorney Ryan went on to  advise that the  act was  clear in that it authorized \nemergency powers for 30 days and construction of the statute any other way would render the \nlimitation clause meaningless. Id. \n92.  He further  advised more reasonable construction, taking into  consideration the \nother provisions of the Act, is that the Governor would be required to seek legislative approval for \nthe exercise of extraordinary measures extending beyond 30 days. Id. \n93.  This construction is supported by references to section 9 of the Act (20 ILCS 3305/9 \n(West 2000)), which pertains to the financing of disaster response measures.  Section 9 provides \nfor the Governor's use of paiticular appropriated funds for emergency purposes, and, if necessary \nand the General Assembly is not in session, the transfer of funds from other accounts or the \nborrowing of additional funds, but only \"until such time as a quorum of the General Assembly can \nconvene in regular or extraordinary session\". The purpose of this provision, like section 7 of the \nAct, is to empower the Governor to deal immediately with emerging emergency situations.  Even \nthough many disaster situations could require remediation for a period long in excess of 3 0 days, \nnormal governmental processes, including legislative action, can be set in motion to meet such \nneeds within 3 0 days of the occurrence. Id. \n94.  Pritzker did not advise the Honorable Court of this analysis by Attorney General \nRyan. \n9 5.  This Attorney General opinion lays bare the overreach of the executive branch \nbeing perpetrated by this gamesmanship. \n96.  Bailey has a right to insist Pritzker not engage in activities designed to circumvent \nlimitations on his authority imposed by the legislature. \n13 \n\n97.  An actual  controversy exists between the parties in regard to  the  authority of \nPritzker to issue serial proclamations for the same disaster for the purpose of continuing to exercise \nemergency powers. \n98.  An immediate and definitive determination is necessary to clarify the rights and \ninterests of the parties. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Darren Bailey, herein requests that this court enter an Order: \nA)  declaring Pritzker issued COVID#2 and COVID#3 for the same COVID-19 virus which \ngave rise to the issuance of COVID#l on March 09, 2020; \nB)  declaring the 30-days of emergency powers provided under Section 7 of the IEMAA \nlapsed on April 08, 2020; \nC)  declaring COVID#2 and COVID#3 did not reset the 30-day emergency provisions under \nSection 7 of the IEMAA; \nD)  declaring any executive orders finding their authority under the emergency powers of \nSection 7 of the IEMAA after April 08, 2020 are void ab initio; \nE)  A warding Bailey his costs incurred in this matter as may be allowed by law; \nF)  That the Court grant such other and further relief as is just and proper. \nCOUNT III \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT FINDING THAT THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF \nHEALTH ACT GOVERNS THE CONDUCT OF STATE ACTORS IN THIS CONTEXT \n99.  Bailey restates paragraphs 1-98 as if more fully stated herein. \n100.  In relation to  the specific matters raised herein,  in order to restrict a citizen's \nmovement or activities, or close a citizen's business, Pritzker must have acted under the Illinois \nconstitutional powers vested in him as Governor, or under the powers delegated to him under The \nIEMAA by the legislative branch. \n14 \n\n101.  Nowhere in EO  32 does Pritzker identify what Illinois constitutional power is \nvested in him to restrict a citizen's movement or activities or seize control of any citizen's business \nand order the premises closed. \n102.  His suggestion of having constitutional authority is nothing but conclusory. \n103.  As Governor, he is the supreme executive of the State of Illinois. \n104.  In that role, he is charged with the faithful execution of the laws of the State and \nnot the making of laws. \n105.  Restrict a citizen's movement or activities or seizing control of citizen's business \npremises and ordering it closed is a clear utilization of the police powers of the State. \n106.  Police powers  are vested in the  sound discretion of the  legislative branch  of \ngovernment. \n107.  As such, Pritzker must find authority to restrict a citizen's movement or activities, \nor forcibly close any citizen's business premises under the cited sections of the IEMAA. \n108.  The power would have been delegated to him by the legislative branch, and ifhe \nhas none, the order restricting a citizens' movement or activities and/or closure of any citizen's \nbusiness premises would be unlawful and void. \n109.  Even under the most strained interpretation of Pritzker's cited sections 7(1), 7(2), \n7(3), 7(8), 7(9) and 7(12) of The IEMAA, nowhere can it be found where the legislative branch \ndelegated any power to Pritzker to forcibly restrict a citizen's movement or activities and/or close \nprivate businesses. \n110.  Pritzker made it clear EO 32 was not intended to alter or modify any existing State, \nCounty or local authority over restrict a citizens' movement or activities and/or ordering business \nclosures.  (See Section 19 ofEO 32) \n15 \n\n111.  Bailey does not dispute in times such as these, and at all times for that matter, the \nDepartment has the authority to restrict a citizen's movement or activities and/or forcibly close the \nbusiness premises if circumstances give rise to a public health risk. \n112.  The legislative branch in its sound discretion placed the supreme authority over \nsuch matters with the Department pursuant to the IDPHA. \n113.  Pritzker attempts to cobble together a basis for delegated authority under his cited \nsections of EO 32, should not remotely compel this Court that Pritzker's strained and desperate \ninterpretation might in anyway supersede the express supreme authority vested in the Department \nof Health by the people's lawmaking branch of our government. \n114.  The supreme authority over matters restricting a citizen's movement or activities \nand closure of businesses due to health risks is quite compelling language the legislature used \nwhen granting the Department this extraordinary power. \n115.  The Department has determined that relevant authority under the IDPHA must be \nexercised by each county's board of health in a manner consistent with state law. \n116.  Baily has aright to insist Pritzker act solely within the scope of the authority granted \nto him by the legislature, and, specifically, be constrained from acting beyond the authority granted \nto him under the IEMAA.  Among other things, Pritzker is subject to the limitations on his \nauthority under the IEMAA and must conform his actions to provisions of the IDPHA. \n117.  An actual controversy exists between the parties in regard to  the  authority of \nPritzker to enter and enforce those provisions ofEO 32 which restrict the movement and activities \nof persons, and the closure of businesses. \n118.  An immediate and definitive determination is necessary to clarify the rights and \ninterests of the parties. \n16 \n\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Darren Bailey, herein requests that this court enter an Order: \nA  declaring Pritzker had no Illinois constitutional authority as Governor to restrict a \ncitizen's movement or activities and/or forcibly close the business premises in EO \n32; \nB.  declaring that none of the cited provisions of the IEMAA in EO  32 delegated \nPritzker any authority to restrict a citizen's movement or activities and/or forcibly \nclose their business premises; \nC.  declaring the proper authority to restrict a citizen's movement or activities and/or \nforcibly  close their business due to any public health risks has been expressly \ndelegated to the Department of Health under the Illinois Department of Public \nHealth Act; \nD.  Awarding Bailey his costs incurred in this matter as may be allowed by law; \nE.  That the Court grant such other and further relief as is just and proper. \nCOUNT IV \nFOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n119.  Plaintiff restates paragraphs 1-118 as if more fully stated herein. \n120.  Bailey has the following separate and distinct rights as it relates to this cause: \na)  To insist Pritzker not exceed his authority by issuing disaster proclamations which \nfail to meet the definition of a disaster under Section 4 of the IEMAA; \nb)  To insist Pritzker not exceed his authority in arbitrarily extending the emergency \npowers of section 7 of the IEMAA beyond the 30-day limitation. \nc)  To insist Pritzker does not have any authority to restrict the movement or activities \nor  business  closures  under  the  IEMAA,  as  that  authority  was  expressly  delegated  to  the \nDepartment. \n17 \n\n121.  Bailey is being in-eparably harmed each and every day in which he continues to be \nsubjected to Pritzker's ultra vires executive order.  Among other things, Bailey is prohibited from \nattending worship services and is subject to potential enforcement actions in the event and to the \nextent he engages in activities proscribed by EO 32 and the other relevant executive orders and \ndeclarations. \n122.  Bailey has no  adequate remedy at law to prohibit Pritzker from enforcing the \nexecutive orders against him absent an injunction from this Court ordering the same.  In that \nrespect, the relevant executive orders and declarations constitute prior restraints which cannot be \nfully remedied by an award of damages. \n123.  There is a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits as COVID#3 clearly was \nnot issued pursuant to a disaster as defined by the IEMAA. \n124.  There is a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits as Pritzker has no authority \nto extend the emergency powers of section 7 of the IEMAA beyond 3 0 days. \n125.  There is a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits as Pritzker has no authority \nunder the IEMAA to restrict the movement or activities of people, or business closures. \n126.  There is  a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits because the IDPHA \ngoverns the matters at issue in connection with COVID-19, the Department has delegated its \nauthority under the IDPHA to  county public health departments for purposes of enforcement \nconsistent with applicable law, and county public health departments have not acted within the \nscope of and subject to the limitations on their authority under the IDPHA. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Dan-en Bailey, prays that this Court enter judgment in his favor \nand: \nA.  Find and determine Plaintiff has a right to insist that Pritzker act only within the scope of the \n18 \n\nauthority granted to him by the legislature. \nB.  Find and dete1mined Bailey is irreparably harmed each day he is subjected to the executive \norders relative to this cause. \nC.  Find and determine Bailey has no adequate remedy at law to protect his rights against any \nunlawful orders of Pritzker beyond injunctive relief. \nD.  Find and determine Bailey has a likelihood of success on the merits. \nE.  Enter an injunction permanently enjoining Pritzker,  or anyone  under his authority,  from \nenforcing EO 32 from this date forward. \nF.

Defendant has taken Plaintiff’s Complaint, which raises \nnothing but questions concerning Defendant’s authority under certain Illinois statutes, \nand contrived federal questions where none exist.  Given the Defendant’s prior actions \nin connection with the underlying state court case, including a request for supervisory \nreview and a specious motion to transfer venue, it is clear he is intent on forum shopping \nand wants nothing more than to derail state court proceedings.   This Court should not \ncountenance such an egregious attempt to neuter a state court.    \nIn short, the Notice of Removal is beyond frivolous and reeks of bad faith, and this \nCourt should immediately remand this matter to the Circuit Court, Clay County, Illinois \nfor disposition. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 8   Filed 05/21/20   Page 2 of 11   Page ID #256\n \n \nI.  BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff commenced his action in the Circuit Court, Clay County, Illinois on April \n23, 2020, seeking relief from certain executive orders and declarations issued by the \nDefendant in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.   Specifically, in his initial \ncomplaint, Plaintiff sought multiple forms of relief:  (1) a judgment declaring the scope of \nand limitations on the Defendant’s authority under the Illinois Emergency Management \nAgency Act (the “IEMAA”) and (2) an injunction excusing Plaintiff’s compliance with \ncertain so-called “stay at home” orders Defendant issued under the auspices of the \nIEMAA.  \nAt the conclusion of a hearing in this case on April 27, 2020, the Court entered its \ntemporary restraining order which found that Plaintiff was not subject to certain of the \n“stay  at  home”  orders  Defendant  issued.    In  that  respect,  the  Court  concluded \nDefendant’s authority to exercise emergency powers under the IEMAA terminated 30 \ndays  following  Defendant’s  March  9,  2020  disaster  declaration.  The  Defendant \nimmediately sought appellate review and further asked for direct review by the Illinois \nSupreme Court.   In tandem with his request for direct review by the Illinois Supreme \nCourt, Defendant asked the Supreme Court to issue a supervisory order concerning the \nscope of Defendant’s authority under the IEMAA. \nFollowing  Defendant’s  appeal,  Plaintiff  agreed  to  vacatur  of  the  temporary \nrestraining order, thus mooting Defendant’s request for appellate review.   However, \n  1\n2 \n1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 8   Filed 05/21/20   Page 3 of 11   Page ID #257\n \nDefendant persisted in his motion for entry of a supervisory order, and the Illinois \nSupreme Court denied that motion on May 11, 2020.    \nDefendant filed a motion to transfer the case on May 13, 2020, on the basis of forum \nnon conveniens.   The Circuit Court denied the motion to transfer and all but officially \nrecognized it as Defendant’s attempt at forum shopping.   \nIn the midst of Defendant’s procedural machinations to strip the Clay County \nCircuit  Court  of  jurisdiction,  Plaintiff  filed  his  first  amended  complaint.  The  relief \nPlaintiff seeks is precise and his requests go solely to construction of Illinois statutes: \nI.  A declaration that the Defendant’s April 30, 2020 proclamation is void for \nfailing to meet the definition of a disaster as defined in the Illinois Emergency \nManagement Agency Act;  \nII.  A  declaration  finding  that  Defendant  had  no  authority  under  the  Illinois \nEmergency Management Agency Act to utilize emergency powers after April \n8, 2020; \nIII.  A  declaration  that  the  Illinois  Department  of  Public  Health  Act  governs \nDefendant’s actions; and  \nIV.  Injunctive  relief  enjoining  Defendant  from  enforcing  the  executive  orders \ndescribed in the first amended complaint on the basis of Defendant’s lack of \nstatutory authority.  \nThe relief requested in the first amended complaint is not predicated, in any \nrespect, on alleged violations of rights conferred under the United States Constitution or \nany federal statutes.   Nor does the first amended complaint contain any suggestion by \n  1\n3 \n1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 8   Filed 05/21/20   Page 4 of 11   Page ID #258\n \nPlaintiff that his federal civil rights have been violated by Defendant’s proclamations and \nexecutive orders.   Instead, Plaintiff states only that Defendant’s proclamations and \nexecutive orders exceed authority conferred by the Illinois legislature.     \nOn May 15, 2020, the Circuit Court in Clay County directed Plaintiff to file his \nmotion for summary judgment on or before May 18, 2020, and instructed Defendant to \nfile his response no later than noon on May 21, 2020.   The Court further scheduled a \nhearing on the motion for summary judgment for May 22, 2020.     \nDefendant did not file a response to Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment, but, \ninstead, removed the action to this Court.    \n \nII.  ARGUMENT \nA. This Court Lacks Subject Matter Jurisdiction.  \nThis Court’s jurisdiction over removed cases is limited to only those matters over \nwhich it would have original jurisdiction.  28 U.S.C. §1446(a).   Because Plaintiffs' state-\nlaw claims do not \"arise under\" federal law, Merrell Dow Pharm. Inc. v. Thompson, 478 \nU.S. 804, 807 (1986), there is no federal question jurisdiction, and this case should be \nimmediately remanded.   See 28 U.S.C. §1331 (“The district courts shall have original \njurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the \nUnited States.”).  See also Merrell Dow Pharm, Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U.S. 804, 106 S. Ct. \n3229 (1986) (finding removal improper because no federal cause of action appeared in \nthe complaint).   \n  1\n4 \n1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 8   Filed 05/21/20   Page 5 of 11   Page ID #259\n \nThis case turns exclusively on Illinois law – specifically Illinois statutes and the \nauthority conferred on Defendant pursuant to those statutes.   Nowhere does Defendant \nsuggest, nor could he, that a court must refer to federal law in order to determine \nwhether Defendant’s actions exceeded the authority conferred upon him by the Illinois \nlegislature.   Instead, Defendant appears to claim that the effects of his actions impact \nPlaintiff’s rights and interests under the United States Constitution and certain Acts of \nCongress.    Thus, Defendant posits the action is properly removable.   He is wrong.    \nDefendant cannot dispute that Plaintiff’s causes of action do not arise under \nfederal law, yet he advances the canard that Plaintiff’s claims have some “embedded” \nfederal law issues that justify removal.   See Grable & Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue \nEngineering & Manufacturing, 545 U.S. 308, 312 (2005) (concerning treatment of state law \nclaims containing “embedded” federal issues).  Defendant does not grasp that only a \n\"slim category\" of cases qualify for federal jurisdiction under Grable, see Gunn v. Minton, \n568 U.S. 251, 258 (2013), and the claims here clearly do not. Where federal law does not \ncreate the cause of action, \"federal jurisdiction over a state law claim will [only] lie if a \nfederal issue is: (1) necessarily raised, (2) actually disputed, (3) substantial, and (4) \ncapable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the federal-state balance \napproved by Congress.\" Id. at 258. \nFirst, no federal claim is \"necessarily raised.\" That standard requires that the \nfederal question be an \"essential element\" of the plaintiff's \"claim.” Grable, 545 U.S. at \n315); accord Manning v. Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner & Smith, Inc., 772 F.3d 158, 163, 165 \n(3d Cir. 2014), aff'd, 136 S. Ct. 1562 (2016). The Grable exception is for state causes of \n  1\n5 \n1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 8   Filed 05/21/20   Page 6 of 11   Page ID #260\n \naction  where  the  state  rule  of  decision  turns  on  federal  law.      Here,  the  matters \nDefendant raises as predicates for federal jurisdiction are irrelevant to Defendant’s \nauthority under applicable Illinois statutes and resolution of Plaintiff’s causes of action.     \nSecond, the issue is not \"actually disputed\" because Plaintiff has not asked the \nCircuit Court to make any determination whether Defendant’s actions contravene \nPlaintiff’s federal rights.   Instead, he only asserts that Defendant’s ultra vires state law \nbased actions have the effect of restricting Plaintiff’s activities.   Once again, Plaintiff’s \ncomplaint and first amended complaint do not so much as hint that he seeks a resolution \non the basis of infringement of rights conferred under the United States Constitution.  \nThird, not only are the issues Defendant raises not “substantial” within the \ncontemplation  of  Grable,  they  are  non-existent  in  this  context.      Whether  or  not \nDefendant’s actions infringe on rights existing under the United States Constitution is \nirrelevant  to  and  mentioned  nowhere  in  Plaintiff’s  complaint  or  first  amended \ncomplaint.   In other words, a decision concerning the impact of Defendant’s actions on \nPlaintiff’s rights under the United States Constitution are neither here nor there in this \nsituation. \nFourth, any issue about the construction of the Illinois Emergency Management \nAgency Act and the Illinois Department of Public Health Act, i.e., the core of Plaintiff’s \ncauses of action, is not “capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the \nfederal-state  balance.”    In  that  respect,  Plaintiff’s  causes  of  action  are  grounded \nexclusively in and predicated on the construction of Illinois statutes.   Did Defendant have \nthe authority to take certain actions under Illinois statues?  That question goes to the heart \n  1\n6 \n1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 8   Filed 05/21/20   Page 7 of 11   Page ID #261\n \nof the interests of the State of Illinois and has no bearing on federal interest.    In short, \n\"the court must consider 'the degree to which federal law [is] in the forefront of the case \nand not collateral, peripheral or remote.'\" Krause v. Phila. Soul, No. CIV.A. 09-1132, 2009 \nWL 1175625, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 30, 2009) (quoting Merrell Dow, 478 U.S. at 814 n.11).   In \nthis case, federal law is not simply collateral, peripheral, or remote:   its appearance in \nthis case is a pure contrivance.   \nCuriously, Defendant relies on Compagnie Francaise de Navigation a Vapeur v. State \nBd. Of Health, 186 U.S. 380 (1902) for the proposition that “Federal courts have long \nexercised jurisdiction over alleged challenges to ultra vires state quarantine orders.” Notice \nof Removal at 4, ¶7.   The Defendant seems to suggest that the only matters at issue in the \ncomplaint were alleged ultra vires quarantine orders and that those orders alone.   The \nmost charitable way to describe Defendant’s reliance on that case is that it is misleading.    \nDefendant chose to conceal from this Court the actual averments at issue:   “It was averred \nthat the action of the board was not authorized by the state law, and if it was such law \nwas void because repugnant to the provision of the Constitution of the United States \nconferring upon Congress power ‘to regulate commerce with foreign nations . . .”  Id. at \n382-83.   No such allegations appear in Plaintiff’s complaint of first amended complaint. \nTherefore,  Compagnie  Francaise  de  Navigation  a  Vapeur  is  hardly  dispositive  here  as \nDefendant suggests. \nDefendant’s  reliance  on  the  Court’s  jurisdiction  under  28  U.S.C.  §1343  is \ncompletely misplaced.   The text of section 1343 demonstrates its inapplicability in the \ncase at bar.   Under section 1343, the district courts have original jurisdiction over a \n  1\n7 \n1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 8   Filed 05/21/20   Page 8 of 11   Page ID #262\n \nspecifically defined set of claims:  (a) to recover damages related to section 1985 of title \n42; (b) to redress deprivation of rights secured by the United States Constitution or an \nAction of Congress; and (c) to recover damages or secure equitable relief under federal \ncivil rights legislation.   See 28 U.S.C. §1343(a).    Not one of those jurisdictional hooks \nexist in this case, and Defendant is relying on a complaint that does not exist in the record.   \nPlaintiff has sought declaratory and injunctive relief based exclusively on limitations on \nDefendant’s authority set forth in Illinois statutes.   Neither the complaint nor the first \namended complaint make any references to the United States Constitution or Acts of \nCongress.   Defendant has done nothing more than create a roadmap for a hypothetical \ncivil rights complaint.    \n \nB.  Expedited Relief is Essential.  \nUnder § 1447(c), the Court may remand the case \"at any time\" based on the lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction. When a district court discovers a jurisdictional defect in an \nimproperly removed case, the court should remand the case immediately. Meritcare Inc. \nv. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co., 166 F.3d 214, 217 (3d Cir. 1999). Likewise, once a party raises \nby motion a failure in the predicates for removal, an immediate remand is appropriate. \nGiven this Court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction, as well as the expedited \nschedule for the state court proceeding as established by the Circuit Court, this Court \nshould remand this matter immediately, without awaiting an opposition from Defendant. \nNothing he would say could salvage this removal. \n  1\n8 \n1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 8   Filed 05/21/20   Page 9 of 11   Page ID #263\n \nAny  delay  in  resolving  this  motion  would  substantially  prejudice  Plaintiff.  \nIndeed, Defendant’s vexatious conduct has already resulted in delays and expenditure of \ntime and resources responding to calls for intervention by the Illinois Supreme Court and \nspecious motions to transfer venue.  Beyond that, Defendant notified the state court of \nhis removal just a day before the scheduled hearing on Plaintiff’s motion for summary \njudgment and mere hours before his response to the motion was due.  Defendant \nimproperly used the notice of removal to dodge what he clearly anticipated would be an \nadverse  decision  in  the  Circuit  Court,  and  this  Court  should  reject  his  dilatory \nmachinations.   \n \nC. Plaintiff is Entitled to Attorneys' Fees Under 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c) \nUnder 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c), \"[a]n order remanding the case may require payment of \njust costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the \nremoval.\"  \"Absent  unusual  circumstances,  courts  may  award  attorney's  fees  under \n§1447(c) only where the removing party lacked an objectively reasonable basis for seeking \nremoval.\" Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp., 546 U.S. 132, 139 (2005). \"Conversely, when an \nobjectively reasonable basis exists, fees should be denied.\" Id. A party seeking fees need \nnot establish that a notice of removal was frivolous. Rather, an award of attorney fees is \nentirely appropriate where \"the assertion in the removal petition that the district court \nhad jurisdiction was, if not frivolous, at best insubstantial.\" Mints v. Educ. Testing Serv., \n99 F.3d 1253, 1261 (3d Cir. 1996). \n  1\n9 \n1 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 8   Filed 05/21/20   Page 10 of 11   Page ID #264\n \nHere, Defendant’s notice of removal is far worse than insubstantial—it is frivolous.   \nHis entire theory of jurisdiction rests on the utterly false assertions that Plaintiff is seeking \nvindication of violation of his federal rights.   On that basis, this Court should assess \nPlaintiff’s attorney fees against the Defendant.     \n \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should (a) grant Plaintiff expedited relief, (b) \nremand this case immediately to the Circuit Court, Clay County, Illinois, and (c) award \nPlaintiff his attorney fees, costs and expenses associated with his response to the instant \nNotice of Removal.   \n            Respectfully submitted,  \nSILVER LAKE GROUP, LTD.  \n  \n/s/ Steven M.

No. 3:20-cv-00474 \n \nGOVERNOR JB PRITZKER, in his official \ncapacity, \n \nDefendant. \n \nNOTICE OF REMOVAL \n \nPLEASE TAKE NOTICE that Defendant Governor JB Pritzker (“Governor”) hereby \nremoves this action to this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1446 and 28 U.S.C. 1343(a)(3), because \nthe action seeks to redress an alleged deprivation of Plaintiff Darren Bailey’s rights secured by the \nConstitution of the United States, including his First Amendment right to free exercise of religion, \nhis Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process, his right to interstate travel, and the \nright to a Republican Form of Government conferred by Article IV, Section 4 of the United States \nConstitution. \n1.  On April 23, 2020, Plaintiff Darren Bailey (“Bailey”) commenced an action in the \nCircuit Court for the Fourth Judicial Circuit, Clay County, Illinois, captioned Darren Bailey v. \nGovernor Jay Robert Pritzker, in his official capacity, No. 2020 CH 6 (“State Court Action”). \nBailey served the initial complaint on the Governor on April 24, 2020. On May 15, 2020, Bailey \nreceived leave to and filed an amended complaint, which he also served on the Governor. The \nGovernor is the only defendant named in the State Court Action. Accordingly, this Notice of \nRemoval is timely under 28 U.S.C. § 1446(b)(1) and 28 U.S.C. § 1446(b)(3), as it is filed within \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 1   Filed 05/21/20   Page 2 of 7   Page ID #2\n30 days of service of both the initial pleading and the amended pleading. See Murphy Bros. v. \nMichetti Pipe Stringing, 526 U.S. 344, 350–51 (1999).  \n2.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1446(a), a copy of all process, pleadings, and orders served \non the office of Governor J.B. Pritzker relating to this action is attached as Exhibits A–I. Pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 1446(d), a copy of this Notice of Removal is being served on counsel for Bailey, \nand a copy, along with a Notice of Filing of the Notice of Removal, is today being filed with the \nClerk of the Circuit Court of Clay County, Illinois.  \n3.  The Governor removes this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) because the action \nseeks redress for alleged deprivations of Bailey’s federal constitutional rights caused by actions \ntaken under color of state law. Section 1343(a)(3) provides federal district courts with original \njurisdiction over “any civil action authorized by law” brought by any person: (a) “to redress the \ndeprivation . . . of any right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United \nStates” that (b) occurs “under color of any State law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or \nusage.” \n4.  Bailey challenges the validity of disaster proclamations and executive orders that \nthe Governor issued in his official capacity under color of Illinois law. (Am. Compl., Counts I–\nIII.) Bailey seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. In his amended complaint, Bailey alleges he \nhas standing to seek this declaratory and injunctive relief because he has suffered harm caused by \nthe Governor’s actions, including alleged harm to Bailey’s rights that are protected under the \nUnited States Constitution. (Am. Compl., ¶ 117, alleging that “An actual controversy exists \nbetween the parties in regard to the authority of Pritzker to enter and enforce those provisions of \nExecutive Order 32 which restrict the movement and activities of persons, and the closure of \nbusinesses.”) His amended complaint makes clear that through his action for declaratory judgment \n  2\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 1   Filed 05/21/20   Page 3 of 7   Page ID #3\nand injunctive relief Bailey seeks to redress the alleged deprivation under color of Illinois law of \nfour rights secured by the United States Constitution.  \n5.  First, Bailey seeks to redress an alleged violation of his “liberty interest.” (See, e.g., \nAm. Compl., Ex. A, ¶¶ 105-107, seeking redress for Governor’s alleged “utilization of the police \npowers of the State” to “restrict a citizen’s movement or activities or seizing control of . . . business \npremises”; Temporary Restraining Order, Ex. B, ¶ 5, asserting “Plaintiff has shown he has a clearly \nascertainable right in need of immediate protection, namely his liberty interest to be free from \nPritzker’s executive order.”)1 The “liberty interest” that Bailey alleges to have been violated, and \nfor which Bailey seeks redress, is secured by the United States Constitution. See, e.g., Youngberg \nv. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 315 (1982); Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 600 (1979). The Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution prohibits a “state” from “depriv[ing] any person of \nlife, liberty, or property, without due process of law[.]” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1 (emphasis \nadded).  \n6.  Bailey alleges that the executive orders issued by the Governor have deprived him \nof his liberty interest by requiring him to quarantine himself at home. (See Am. Compl., ¶¶ 32–49, \ndiscussing quarantine procedures; ¶¶ 105-107, seeking redress for actions restricting movement; \n¶  117, same.) Bailey alleges that the Governor failed to provide him with notice before subjecting \nhim to quarantine and failed to provide him with adequate procedures to challenge his alleged \nquarantine. (See Am. Compl., ¶ 41, alleging “Persons who are ordered to be isolated or quarantined \nor who are owners of places that are ordered to be closed and made off limits to the public, shall \nbe given a written notice of such order.”; id. ¶ 37, asserting that “within 48 hours after issuing the \n \n1 The Temporary Restraining Order attached hereto as Exhibit B was drafted by counsel for Bailey and was \nsigned by Judge Michael McHaney without substantive revision. See Temporary Restraining Order, Ex. B, \npassim. \n  3\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 1   Filed 05/21/20   Page 4 of 7   Page ID #4\norder,” the State had to “obtain the consent of the person” subject to quarantine “or file a petition \nrequesting a court order authorizing the isolation or quarantine.”) Bailey asserts that there are \n“procedural safeguards” that “must be followed when restricting the movements or activities of \nthe people, or closing businesses, to control disease spread.” (Am. Compl. ¶ 48.)  \n7.  Bailey’s allegations, when construed as a well-pleaded complaint, as they must be, \nassert a procedural due process claim under the Fourteenth Amendment. See Wright & Miller, 14C \nFed. Prac. & Poc. Juris. § 3722.1 (Rev. 4th ed. April 2020) (explaining that under the artful-\npleading doctrine, a corollary of the well-pleaded complaint rule, “when a cause of action in the \nplaintiff’s complaint, if properly pled, would pose a federal question and make the case removable, \nthe plaintiff will not be permitted to disguise the inherently federal cause of action, to block \nremoval”). Federal courts have long exercised jurisdiction over challenges to allegedly ultra vires \nstate quarantine orders. See, e.g., Compagnie Francaise de Navigation a Vapeur v. State Bd. of \nHealth, 186 U.S. 380, 386, 393–94 (1902) (exercising appellate jurisdiction based on due process \nprotections in the Fourteenth Amendment over challenge to allegedly ultra vires state quarantine \norder). This Court has original jurisdiction in this case because Bailey challenges an allegedly ultra \nvires quarantine order that he alleges has deprived him of his liberty interest without the procedural \ndue process to which he is entitled under the Fourteenth Amendment. 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3). \n8.  Second, Bailey seeks to redress an alleged violation of his right to free exercise of \nreligion. (See, e.g., Am. Compl., Ex. A, ¶ 71, seeking redress for Governor’s alleged actions \n“preventing Bailey from attending worship services.”) The freedom of religion that Bailey alleges \nto have been violated, and for which Bailey seeks redress, is secured by the United States \nConstitution. See U.S. Const. amend. I; Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, \n508 U.S. 520, 532 (1993). The First Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied to \n  4\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 1   Filed 05/21/20   Page 5 of 7   Page ID #5\nthe states through the Fourteenth Amendment, forbids the Governor, in his official capacity, from \nmaking  any  law  “respecting  an  establishment  of  religion,  or  prohibiting  the  free  exercise \nthereof[.]” U.S. Const. amend. I. \n9.  Third, Bailey seeks to redress an alleged violation of his right to freedom of travel. \n(See, e.g., Am. Compl., Ex. A, ¶¶ 105–110, seeking redress for Governor’s alleged actions \n“restrict[ing] . . . citizen’s movement.”) The freedom to travel that Bailey alleges to have been \nviolated, and for which Bailey seeks redress, is secured by the United States Constitution. See \nAttorney Gen. of New York v. Soto-Lopez, 476 U.S. 898, 901–02 (1986) (“Freedom to travel \nthroughout the United States has long been recognized as a basic right under the Constitution.”) \n(internal citations and quotation marks omitted) (collecting cases). \n10.  Fourth, Bailey seeks to redress an alleged violation of Article IV, Section 4 of the \nUnited States Constitution, which provides that “[t]he United States shall guarantee to every State \nin this Union a Republican Form of Government.” Bailey’s complaint alleges that the Governor, \nthrough the disaster proclamations and executive orders that Bailey seeks to void, has seized \n“unilateral control over the movement and livelihood of every citizen in the State. The legislative \nbranch during this period of executive rule under the emergency powers has been rendered \nmeaningless.” (See, e.g., Am. Compl., Ex. A, ¶¶ 84–85.) In other words, Bailey alleges that the \nGovernor’s actions have transformed the state government of Illinois to such a degree that Illinois \nno  longer  enjoys  the  “Republican  Form  of  Government”  guaranteed  by  the  United  States \nConstitution. U.S. Const. art. IV, § 4. \n11.  Because Bailey’s action seeks redress for alleged deprivation of at least four rights \nsecured by the United States Constitution, this Court has original jurisdiction over Bailey’s action \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3), and removal is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a) and § 1446. \n  5\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 1   Filed 05/21/20   Page 6 of 7   Page ID #6\nWHEREFORE, for all these reasons, the Governor removes the State Court Action to this \nCourt. \nDated: May 21, 2020  Respectfully Submitted, \n   \nKWAME RAOUL  /s/ Thomas J.

But that interest does not justify government restrictions \nimposed upon its citizens without legal authority.  Indeed, action contrary to law is likely to erode \npublic confidence in, and compliance with, legitimate efforts taken to address the COVID-19 \npandemic.  This case accordingly implicates issues of national public importance regarding the \ninterplay between a State’s compelling interest in protecting public health and safety from COVID-\n19 and the equally compelling interest in preserving civil liberties.   \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 15   Filed 05/22/20   Page 2 of 21   Page ID #281\nThe United States supports the plaintiff’s emergency motion for remand (SDIL Case 3:20-\ncv-00474-GCS, Doc. 9) and asks the Court promptly to return this matter to the Illinois Circuit \nCourt, where it belongs, because the plaintiff makes no federal claim.  Rather, he alleges that the \nGovernor has exceeded the statutory authority granted under the Illinois Emergency Management \nAgency Act.  Am. Compl., ¶¶ 69, 77, 97, & 109.  To be sure, resolution of the plaintiff’s claim \ncould  have  implications  for  federal  claims  brought  in  other  litigation.    But  mere  federal \nimplications from resolution of a state law claim have never been sufficient to justify removal to \na federal court.  \nThe federal government has an interest in preventing the limited resources of the federal \ncourts from being drawn into state-law disputes that lie outside of their jurisdiction.  True, the \nplaintiff’s argument may bear on federal due process challenges to the executive orders in other \nlitigation.  But the only claim at issue in his suit is under state law.  A timely remand is required \nto allow the Illinois courts to resolve this issue quickly, which may affect the lives of each of the \nnearly 13 million residents and business owners in the state of Illinois.  \nBACKGROUND1 \nIn passing the  Illinois Emergency Management Agency  Act, the  Illinois  Legislature \ndeclared its purpose “to insure that th[e] State w[ould] be prepared to and w[ould] adequately deal \nwith any disasters, preserve the lives and property of the people of th[e] State and protect the public \npeace, health, and safety in the event of a disaster.”  20 ILCS 3305/2(a).  The Act accordingly \n“confer[red]” upon the Governor, 20 ILCS 3305/2(a)(2), the power to “by proclamation declare \nthat a disaster exists” and, “[u]pon such proclamation, . . . [to] have and . . . exercise for a period \nnot to exceed 30 days” certain specified emergency powers.  20 ILCS 3305/7.  As relevant here, \n                                                           \n1   The United States submits this brief on the basis of the facts alleged in the complaint and reflected in the \naccompanying exhibits. \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 15   Filed 05/22/20   Page 3 of 21   Page ID #282\nthese emergency powers include the power to “control ingress and egress to and from a disaster \narea, the movement of persons within the area, and the occupancy of premises therein,” 20 ILCS \n3305/7(8); to “[c]ontrol, restrict, and regulate by . . . the use, sale or distribution of food, feed, fuel, \nclothing and other commodities, materials, goods, or services;” and to “perform and exercise any \nother functions, powers, and duties as may be necessary to promote and secure the safety and \nprotection of the civilian population,” 20 ILCS 3305/7(12).  The Act does not “[l]imit, modify, or \nabridge the authority of the Governor to proclaim martial law or exercise any other powers vested \nin the Governor under the constitution, statutes, or common law of th[e] State, independent of or \nin conjunction with any provisions of th[e] Act.”  20 ILCS 3305/3(d). \nOver the last two months, the Governor has relied upon the authority conveyed upon him \nunder the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act to restrict, in many cases significantly, the \nliberties of citizens within the State.  On March 9, 2020, the Governor proclaimed that “the \ncircumstances surrounding COVID-19 constitute a public health emergency” and “all counties in \nthe State of Illinois a[re] a disaster area.”  Am. Compl., Ex. 1.  On March 20, 2020, the Governor \nissued  an  executive  order  requiring  “all  individuals  currently  living  within  the  State  of \nIllinois . . . to stay at home or at their place of residence except” for certain specified “Essential \nActivities, Essential Governmental Functions, or to operate Essential Businesses and Operations,” \nthrough the duration of the disaster proclamation, which at that point extended through April 7, \n2020.  Am. Compl., Ex. 2.  On April 1, 2020, the Governor issued another proclamation, in which \nhe  designated  “the  circumstances  surrounding  COVID-19  [as]  a  continuing  public  health \nemergency” and asserted that the designation “continue[d] the Governor’s authority to exercise all \nof the emergency powers provided in Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency \nAct” for another 30 days.  Compl., Ex. 3.  The same day, the Governor extended Executive Order \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 15   Filed 05/22/20   Page 4 of 21   Page ID #283\n2020-10, along with numerous other Executive Orders that he had issued pursuant to his original \ndisaster proclamation, for the same 30 days.  Compl., Ex. 4. \nDarren  Bailey  (“Bailey”  or  “Plaintiff”)  filed  this  suit  on  April  23,  2020,  seeking  a \ndeclaratory judgment that the Governor’s Orders are unauthorized and related injunctive relief.  \nHe also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction the same day.  \nThe state court concluded that Bailey had established “a reasonable likelihood of succeeding on \nthe merits,” as well as irreparable harm, and issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) on April \n27, 2020, to continue not longer than 30 days and only until the Court had an opportunity to hear \na motion for preliminary injunction.  See TRO at 1-2.  Plaintiff subsequently agreed to vacatur of \nthe TRO and expedited summary judgment briefing on an amended complaint.  That amended \ncomplaint sought declaratory judgments that the Governor’s April 30, 2020, proclamation was \nvoid under state law because it did not meet the statutory definition of disaster, that the Governor \nlacked authority under the Act to exercise emergency powers after April 8, 2020, and that the \nIllinois Department of Public Health Act applied to the Governor’s actions, along with related \ninjunctive relief.  Am. Compl. ¶¶  72, 98, 118, 120.  The hearing on Plaintiff’s motion for summary \njudgment was set for May 22, 2020.  Notice of Hearing, May 18, 2020. \nOn May 21, 2020, the Governor filed a notice of removal.  SDIL Case 3:20-cv-00474-\nGCS, Doc. 1.  In that notice, he attempts to characterize the plaintiff’s purely state-law complaint \nas seeking redress for alleged deprivations of Bailey’s federal constitutional rights caused by \nactions taken under color of state law.  Doc. 1 ¶ 3.  Certainly, Bailey could have advanced those \nconstitutional claims.  But he did not.  Instead, he brought only state law claims.  And as such, the \ncase belongs in state court.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 15   Filed 05/22/20   Page 5 of 21   Page ID #284\nPlaintiff has set forth a strong case that the Orders exceed the authority granted to the \nGovernor by the Illinois legislature.  The United States also agrees with the Governor’s apparent \nrecognition that, although violations of state law do not ordinarily amount to a federal due process \nviolation, state actions that are both wholly unauthorized by state law and impose broad and \nintrusive restrictions on individual liberties may raise federal due process concerns.  But those \nfederal concerns cannot transform a complaint that presses only state-law claims into a complaint \nover which this Court has jurisdiction. \nARGUMENT \nI.  The Case Should Be Remanded to Illinois Circuit Court Because Plaintiff’s \nComplaint Does Not Arise Under Federal Law. \n \nA.  Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint Does Not Allege a Federal Cause of Action. \n \nFederal removal is governed by 28 U.S.C. § 1441.  The removing party typically bears the \nburden of showing removal is proper.  Doe v. Allied-Signal, Inc., 985 F.2d 908, 911 (7th Cir. \n1993).  “Only state-court actions that originally could have been filed in federal court may be \nremoved to federal court by the defendant.”  Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 392 (1987).  \n“The presence or  absence of  federal-question jurisdiction is governed  by the  ‘well-pleaded \ncomplaint rule,’ which provides that federal jurisdiction exists only when a federal question is \npresented on the face of the plaintiff’s properly pleaded complaint.”  Id.  To be sure, “a plaintiff \nmay not defeat removal by omitting to plead necessary federal questions.”  Citadel Sec., LLC v. \nChicago Bd. Options Exch., Inc., 808 F.3d 694, 701 (7th Cir. 2015) (citations and internal \nquotation marks omitted).  But, at all times, the plaintiff remains “the master of the claim; he or \nshe may avoid federal jurisdiction by exclusive reliance on state law.” Caterpillar, Inc., 482 U.S. \nat 392 (footnote omitted). \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 15   Filed 05/22/20   Page 6 of 21   Page ID #285\n  Federal question jurisdiction exists when the “complaint standing alone” establishes either: \n(i) “that federal law creates the cause of action”; or (ii) “that the plaintiff’s right to relief necessarily \ndepends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.”  Williams v. Aztar Indiana Gaming \nCorp., 351 F.3d 294, 298 (7th Cir. 2003) (citation omitted).2  “[F]ederal-question jurisdiction is \ninvoked by and large by plaintiffs pleading a cause of action created by federal law (e.g., claims \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983).”  Grable & Sons Metal Prod., Inc. v. Darue Eng'g & Mfg., 545 U.S. 308, \n312 (2005).  Here, however, the complaint does not allege a federal cause of action—a fact the \nGovernor does not dispute in the notice of removal.  That leaves only the second route. \nB.  The Court Lacks Jurisdiction Over Plaintiff’s State Law Claims. \n \nAlthough state law claims are generally committed to the jurisdiction of the state courts, \n“federal jurisdiction over a state law claim will lie if a federal issue is: (1) necessarily raised, (2) \nactually disputed, (3) substantial, and (4) capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting \nthe federal-state balance approved by Congress.”  Gunn v. Minton, 568 U.S. 251, 258 (2013) \n(citing Grable, 545 U.S. at 314).   \nGrable sets a high bar.  “Federal jurisdiction is rarely established on this basis.”  Webb v. \nFin. Indus. Regulatory Auth., Inc., 889 F.3d 853, 860 (7th Cir. 2018); Gunn, 568 U.S. at 258 \n(cautioning that Grable applies only to a “slim category” of cases).  It is rare for a reason: Congress \nhas only granted federal courts jurisdiction in cases “arising under” the laws of the United States, \nsee § 1331, and, by definition, state law claims rarely arise under federal law.  Nor does Grable \n                                                           \n2   The Governor purports to remove this action “under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3).”  Notice at ¶ 3.  Section \n1343(a)(3) does not authorize removal, but does have a parallel removal statute in § 1443.  Both statutes extend “only \nto rights that are granted in terms of equality and not to the whole gamut of constitutional rights.”  Chapman v. Houston \nWelfare Rights Org., 441 U.S. 600, 622 (1979) (citation and quotation marks omitted) (expressly excluding due-\nprocess-clause claims from the scope of § 1443).  This is not one of those cases, and § 1443’s specific requirements \nare not met here.  At any rate, § 1343(a)(3) is largely defunct, and the removal analysis should proceed under § 1441.  \nSee Myles v. United States, 416 F.3d 551, 554 (7th Cir. 2005) (“Section 1343(a)(3) covers only civil rights claims \nagainst state actors and has had no legal effect since 1976, when Congress amended § 1331 to eliminate any amount-\nin-controversy requirement.”). \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 15   Filed 05/22/20   Page 7 of 21   Page ID #286\nallow for removal simply because “the predominant issue concerns federal law.”  Hartland \nLakeside Joint No. 3 Sch. Dist. v. WEA Ins. Corp., 756 F.3d 1032, 1034 (7th Cir. 2014); see Webb, \n889 F.3d at 860 (explaining “an issue of federal law must be the ‘cornerstone’ of the plaintiff’s \ncomplaint”) (citation omitted).   \nThe Governor’s notice of removal asserts that this standard is met because the amended \ncomplaint allegedly asserts “harm to Bailey’s rights that are protected under the United States \nConstitution” in order to show standing.   Dkt. 1 ¶ 4.  It also allegedly seeks “redress” of those \nrights.  Id.  This misreads the amended complaint and falls far short of meeting Grable’s test.  \nFirst,  the  Governor  cannot  show  that  any  federal  issue  is  necessarily  raised  by  the \ncomplaint.  The Governor cannot, for example, “contend that the only material issue is federal” \nbecause to do so would require him to “concede” that Plaintiff has “a good claim under state law.”  \nHartland, 756 F.3d at 1033.  “Yet far from conceding this,” the Governor has so far denied that \nPlaintiff has “valid state-law claims,” id.; that is, that the Governor lacked authority under the Act.  \nAny such concession is not clear from the face of the notice of removal.  \nSecond, no reference to federal constitutional rights appears “on the face of” the amended \ncomplaint, giving rise to an actual dispute over such rights in this case.  See Caterpillar, Inc., 482 \nU.S. at 392.  Indeed, the paragraphs that the Governor cites as alleging constitutional violations \ncontain no references to the federal constitution at all:  \n•  Due Process in ¶¶ 37, 41, 48, and 105-110.  Paragraphs 37, 41, and 48 summarize the \nrequirements  of  the  Illinois  Department  of  Public  Health  Act  and  supporting \nadministrative regulations, with citations.  Paragraphs 105-110 allege that, under \nIllinois law, police powers are vested in the legislative branch, not in the executive.  \nNot one of these paragraphs references federal due process. \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 15   Filed 05/22/20   Page 8 of 21   Page ID #287\n•  Free Exercise in ¶ 71.  Paragraph 71 alleges that the challenged executive orders and \nproclamations, among other things, prevent Bailey from “attending religious services.”  \nThis example of the challenged actions’ effect contains no reference to the federal \nConstitution, nor asks for relief thereunder.  \n•  Freedom to travel in ¶¶ 105-110.  Again, these paragraphs allege that, under Illinois \nlaw, police powers are vested in the legislative branch, not in the executive.  They make \nno reference to a federal right to travel. \n•  Art. IV, § 4 in ¶ 84-85.  These paragraphs broadly describe the perceived effect of the \nGovernor’s actions on the legislative power in the State of Illinois.  To the degree these \nparagraphs make any constitutional assertions (and on their face they do not), it would \nbe under the Illinois Constitution’s provisions governing the separation of powers.  The \nparagraphs contain no reference to a federal right to a republican form of government. \nIn sum, the Governor may conceive of constitutional arguments against his course of action, but \nPlaintiff has not asserted them.  Caterpillar, Inc., 482 U.S. at 392. \nThird, Plaintiff’s motion to remand disclaims any reliance on federal constitutional rights.  \nSee SDIL Case 3:20-cv-00474-GCS Doc. 8, Pl.’s Memo. in Support at 6 (“Plaintiff’s complaint \nand first amended complaint do not so much as hint that he seeks a resolution on the basis of \ninfringement of rights conferred under the United States Constitution.”).  Indeed, he seems \nsurprised to learn that he might be implying them.  Id.  These judicial admissions will bind him \n“once the case is sent back to state court.”  Ctr. For Wildlife Ethics, Inc. v. Clark, 325 F. Supp. 3d \n911, 915-16 (N.D. Ind. 2018) (remanding even where a complaint made “seemingly superfluous \nreferences  to  the  U.S.  Constitution”  because  plaintiff  “disclaim[ed]  any  potential  federal \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 15   Filed 05/22/20   Page 9 of 21   Page ID #288\nquestions” in its motion to remand).  So there can be no federal question actually raised and \ndisposed of here. \nFourth, Plaintiff may prove standing under Illinois state law, so the Governor cannot show \nthat  any  federal  question  is  “necessarily  raised,”  “actually  disputed,”  and  “substantial”  by \nPlaintiff’s claim to standing in this case.  Gunn, 568 U.S. at 258.  Here, state law appears to provide \nan array of theories whereby Plaintiff can show redressable injury.  The procedural protections he \ncites, for  example, may be enforceable in a  way that provides him relief, and the  Illinois \nConstitution contains parallel protections for each of the federal rights the Governor says were \nasserted in the amended complaint.   \n  The Governor argues that Plaintiff’s amended complaint may only be read as alleging that \nthe Governor’s orders violate the U.S. Constitution, but that argument fails to account for the state \nConstitution.  Specifically, the Governor reads Plaintiff’s complaint as alleging that the Orders \nviolate his Fourteenth Amendment “liberty interests” because they restrict his movements and \nrequire him to quarantine in his home (Doc. 1 ¶¶ 5 & 6), violate his First Amendment right to the \nfree exercise of religion by preventing him from attending religious services (id. at ¶ 6), and restrict \nhis right to travel (id. at ¶ 8).  But of course, none of these provisions of the U.S. Constitution is \ncited in Plaintiff’s complaint, and each of these rights is likewise secured to Plaintiff by the Illinois \nConstitution.  For example, Art. 1, § 2 of the Illinois constitution guarantees that “[n]o person shall \nbe deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law nor be denied equal protection \nof the laws,” and the Illinois Supreme Court has explained that the guarantee of “liberty” in that \nconstitutional provision is coextensive with that in the federal Constitution and “is deemed to \nembrace the right of every person to be free in the use of his or her powers, faculties, and property, \nin such lawful ways as he or she may choose, ‘subject only to such restraints as are necessary to \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 15   Filed 05/22/20   Page 10 of 21   Page ID #289\nsecure the common welfare.”  People v. Shepard, 152 Ill.2d 489, 501 (Ill. 1992) (emphasis in \noriginal) (citing Ill. Const. 1970, art. 1, § 2) (case citation omitted).  Art. 1, § 3 of the Illinois \nConstitution “forever” guarantees Illinois citizens like Plaintiff “[t]he free exercise and enjoyment \nof religious profession and worship,” and the Illinois courts have interpreted the provision as \nproviding “protections of religious practice . . . [that] are coextensive with those of the United \nStates Constitution.”  Mefford v. White, 331 Ill.App.3d 167, 179 (4th Dist. 2002) (citing People v. \nFalbe, 189 Ill.2d 635, 645 (Ill. 2000)).  The right to travel is “among those protected personal \nliberties which have long been recognized” by the due process clause, City of Chicago v. Morales, \n177 Ill.2d 440, 459-60 (Ill. 1997), and is thus equally protected under the Illinois Constitution, \nColdwell Banker Residential Real Estate Services of Illinois, Inc. v. Clayton, 105 Ill.2d 389, 397 \n(Ill. 1985).   \nThe Governor also cites ¶¶ 84-85 of Plaintiff’s amended complaint to assert a violation of \nArt. IV, ¶ 4 of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees to every state a republican form of \ngovernment.  Dkt. 1, ¶ 10.  Not even a liberal construction of Bailey’s complaint, however, \nsupports the Governor’s argument that Bailey is asserting a federal constitutional claim in this \nregard.  Bailey makes his observation that “[t]he legislative branch during this period of executive \nrule under the emergency powers has been rendered meaningless” in the context of arguing that \nthe Governor has misconstrued his emergency powers under the Act—a pure issue of state law, \nnot a federal constitutional claim.  See Am. Comp. ¶¶ 73-98.  To the extent that Plaintiff’s \nassertions can be read as raising a constitutional claim, it is that the Governor’s reading of the Act \nimproperly  usurps  for  himself  “[t]he  legislative  power  [which]  is  vested  in  [the]  General \nAssembly” in violation of the Illinois Constitution.  Ill. Const., Art. 4, § 1;  see also Am. Comp. \n¶¶ 73-98. \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 15   Filed 05/22/20   Page 11 of 21   Page ID #290\n  As the plaintiff, it is well settled that Bailey is the “master[ ] of the complaint” and “may \ninclude (or omit) claims or parties in order to determine the forum.” Garbie v. DaimlerChrysler \nCorp., 211 F.3d 407, 410 (7th Cir. 2000).  Here, Plaintiff has elected to proceed on only state law \nclaims, and removal is thus improper. \nII.   Governor Pritzker’s Orders Appear Unsupported By State Law \n \nIf the Court declines to remand the case to Illinois Circuit Court, then it should find that \nthe Governor exceeded his authority when issuing the executive orders.  \nThe Constitution establishes a unique federal structure for the United States of America in \nwhich the States play a significant role.  It “establishes a National Government with broad, often \nplenary authority over matters within its recognized competence” while also “assum[ing] the \nStates’ continued existence and active participation in the fundamental processes of governance.”  \nAlden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 713 (1999) (citation omitted).  Indeed, were there any doubt about \nthe  “vital  role  reserved  to  the  States  by  the  constitutional  design,”  the  Tenth  Amendment \n“confirm[ed] the premise implicit in the original document: ‘The powers not delegated to the \nUnited States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States \nrespectively, or to the people.’”  Id. at 713-14 (quoting U.S. Const. amend. X) (citations omitted).  \nThis federal structure “preserves to the people numerous advantages.  It assures a decentralized \ngovernment that will be more sensitive to the diverse needs of a heterogeneous society; it increases \nopportunity for citizen involvement in democratic processes; it allows for more innovation and \nexperimentation in government; and it makes government more responsive by putting the States \nin competition for a mobile citizenry.”  Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 458 (1991) (citations \nomitted).   \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 15   Filed 05/22/20   Page 12 of 21   Page ID #291\nOne critical aspect of the powers reserved to the States is the “autonomy to establish their \nown governmental processes.”  See Ariz. State Legislature v. Ariz. Independent Redistricting \nComm’n, 135 S. Ct. 2652, 2673 (2015) (citations omitted); see also id. (“Whenever the States may \nchoose to substitute other republican forms, they have a right to do so.”) (citation and quotation \nmarks omitted).  Because States’ powers “proceed, not from the people of America, but from the \npeople of the several states; [these powers] remain, after the adoption of the constitution, what they \nwere before, except so far as they may be abridged by that instrument.”  Sturges v. Crowninshield, \n17 U.S. 122, 193 (1819).  And the right of a State to establish its own governmental processes is \nof fundamental importance, for it is “[t]hrough the structure of its government, and the character \nof those who exercise government authority, [that] a State defines itself as a sovereign.”  Gregory, \n501 U.S. at 460.   \nHere, Illinois has defined its governmental processes through the Illinois Emergency \nManagement Agency Act.  The Illinois Legislature recognized “the possibility of the occurrence \nof disasters” resulting from explosions, “fire, flood, earthquake, telecommunications failure, or \nother natural or technological causes.”  20 ILCS 3305/2(a).  And it decided, inter alia, “[t]o confer \nupon the Governor and upon the principal executive officer of the political subdivisions of the \nState” certain broad, but specified, powers.  20 ILCS 3305/2(a).  These powers are keyed to the \nproclamation of a disaster, which is broadly defined as follows: \n“Disaster” means an occurrence or threat of widespread or severe damage, injury \nor loss of life or property resulting from any natural or technological cause, \nincluding  but  not  limited  to  fire,  flood,  earthquake,  wind,  storm,  hazardous \nmaterials spill or other water contamination requiring emergency action to avert \ndanger or damage, epidemic, air contamination, blight, extended periods of severe \nand inclement weather, drought, infestation, critical shortages of essential fuels and \nenergy,  explosion,  riot,  hostile  military  or  paramilitary  action,  public  health \nemergencies, or acts of domestic terrorism.   \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 15   Filed 05/22/20   Page 13 of 21   Page ID #292\n20 ILCS 3305/4.  “In the event of [such] a disaster, . . . the Governor may, by proclamation declare \nthat a disaster exists.”  20 ILCS 3305/7.  “Upon such proclamation, . . . the Governor shall have \nand may exercise for a period not to exceed 30 days the [specified] powers.”  Id.  \nBut nowhere in the Act does it say that the Governor can extend a proclamation for the \nsame disaster.  Compare 20 ILCS 3305/7 with 42 U.S.C. § 247d(a) (“Any such determination of a \npublic health emergency terminates upon the Secretary [of Health and Human Services] declaring \nthat the emergency no longer exists, or upon the expiration of the 90-day period beginning on the \ndate on which the determination is made by the Secretary, whichever occurs first.  Determinations \nthat terminate under the preceding sentence may be renewed by the Secretary . . . .”).   \nThe Office of the Illinois Attorney General has, in the past, informally opined that the Act \ndoes not authorize the extension of emergency powers for a single disaster.  In 2001, the Opinions \nBureau opined, “A construction of [Subsection 7(a)(1)’s] provisions to allow the Governor to \nextend the 30 day period would render the limitation clause meaningless.  A more reasonable \nconstruction, taking into consideration the other provisions of the Act, is that the Governor would \nbe required to seek legislative approval for the exercise of extraordinary measures extending \nbeyond 30 days.”  Am. Compl. Ex. 7, Office of the Attorney General, Emergency Preparedness: \nEmergency Authority to Respond to an Outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease, July 2, 2001, at 5-6.  \nThe Bureau further noted, “Even though many disaster situations could require remediation for a \nperiod long in excess of 30 days, normal governmental processes, including legislative action, can \nbe set in motion to meet such needs within 30 days of the occurrence.”3  Id. at 6. \n                                                           \n3   The powers afforded to the Governor in the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act are broad, \nallowing the Governor to affect nearly every aspect of Illinois citizens’ lives.  They allow him, for example, “to take \npossession of, and to acquire full title or a lesser specified interest in, any personal property as may be necessary,” \nsubject to certain provisions for compensation, 20 ILCS 3305/7(4); “[t]o recommend the evacuation of all or part of \nthe population from any stricken or threatened area within the State,” 20 ILCS 3305/7(6); “[t]o control ingress and \negress to and from a disaster area, the movement of persons within the area, and the occupancy of premises therein,” \n20 ILCS 3305/7(8); to “control, restrict, and regulate by rationing, freezing, use of quotas, prohibitions on \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 15   Filed 05/22/20   Page 14 of 21   Page ID #293\nThe Governor triggered his emergency powers in his March 9, 2020, Proclamation, and 30 \ndays following that Proclamation concluded on April 8, 2020.  Although it is for the Illinois’ \ncourts, not the United States, to interpret state law, it is not clear from the face of the Act from \nwhere  the  Governor  derived  his  authority  to  issue  a  second  proclamation  of  public  health \nemergency relating to COVID-19 and, in any event, his Executive Order, which purported to \ncontinue until April 30, 2020, far exceeded the 30-day limit set forth in the Act.   \nAlthough the Governor has, in the state court, also invoked his authorities under the Illinois \nConstitution, art. V, § 8, to support the Orders, see, e.g., Mot. to Dismiss, ¶ 1, he did not rely upon \nany such authority in the Orders themselves, see Compl., Exs. 1-4.  We note, without expressing \na view on the proper interpretation or application of the Illinois Constitution, that the Supreme \nCourt of Illinois has previously declined to consider alternative assertions of authority for an \nexecutive order.  Buettell v. Walker, 59 Ill.2d 146, 154 (1974) (“The defendants have also \nsuggested that the order may be justified as a rule or regulation under section 5 of the Illinois \nPurchasing Act . . . We find it unnecessary to pursue this suggestion beyond noting that the order \non its face purports to be the exercise by the Governor of an authority independently derived from \nthe Constitution, and not the exercise of a delegated power.”).   \nMoreover, it is far from clear that such authority exists under the Illinois Constitution as \ninterpreted by the Illinois Supreme Court.  Article V, section 8, provides, “The Governor shall \nhave the supreme executive power, and shall be responsible for the faithful execution of the laws.”  \nThe Illinois Constitution does not attempt to define the executive power so conferred, People v. \n                                                           \nshipments, price fixing, allocation or other means, the use, sale, or distribution of food, feed, fuel, clothing and other \ncommodities, materials, goods, or services; and [to] perform and exercise any other functions, powers, and duties as \nmay be necessary to promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population,” 20 ILCS 3305/7(12).  \nThe breadth of these authorities may explain why the Illinois legislature, as a policy matter, may have included a 30-\nday time period. \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 15   Filed 05/22/20   Page 15 of 21   Page ID #294\nHammond, 355 Ill. Dec. 1, 16 (2011), but the Supreme Court of Illinois has previously held that \nthis power does not include the power “to formulate a new legal requirement rather than to execute \nan existing one.”  Buettell, 59 Ill.2d at 153-54.  The Attorney General of Illinois has accordingly \nopined: “[T]he Governor does not have power to legislate by executive order, and, therefore, unless \nauthorized by law, an executive order relating to matters other than executive reorganization can \nbe no more than a policy directive to agencies under the Governor’s control.  To conclude \notherwise would cede to the Governor legislative powers which he is prohibited from exercising \nby the separation of powers doctrine.”  Office of the Attorney General, Applicability of Executive \nOrders,  Administrative  Orders,  and  Directives  Limiting  the  Use  of  Appropriated  Funds  to \nExecutive Agencies Not Under the Governor’s Jurisdiction, Dec. 23, 2013, at 6.   \nIII.  This Case Has Federal Implications, But Such Implications Are Not Sufficient \nTo Support Removal. \n \nThe United States does not typically weigh in on alleged violations of state law, and it \ndefers to the Illinois courts’ resolution of such matters.  After all, it is the States, in the exercise \nof their retained sovereignty, who are tasked with remedying violations of state law.  But the \nOrders at issue are not only of critical importance to the people of Illinois, they implicate a \nbroader national issue about constitutional rights in the time of a pandemic.  As this Court is \nwell aware, the federal government, the District of Columbia, and all 50 States have declared \nstates of emergency and taken essential steps to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nSee, e.g., Proclamation on Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus \nDisease (COVID-19) Outbreak (March 13, 2020).4   \n                                                           \n4   Presidential Proclamation, Proclamation on Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel \nCoronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak, 85 F.R. 15337 (Mar. 13, 2020), available at \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-\ncoronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/ \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 15   Filed 05/22/20   Page 16 of 21   Page ID #295\nThe Constitution does not hobble States from taking necessary, temporary measures to \nmeet a genuine emergency.  According to the Supreme Court, “in every well-ordered society \ncharged with the duty of conserving the safety of its members the rights of the individual in respect \nof his liberty may at times, under the pressure of great dangers, be subjected to such restraint, to \nbe enforced by reasonable regulations, as the safety of the general public may demand.”  Jacobson \nv. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 29 (1905).  In Jacobson, for example, the Court explained that \n“[a]n American citizen arriving at an American port” who had traveled to a region with yellow \nfever “may yet, in some circumstances, be held in quarantine against his will.”  Id.  The “settled \nrule [from Jacobson],” a federal court of appeals recently concluded, “allows the state to restrict, \nfor example, one’s right to peaceably assemble, to publicly worship, to travel, and even to leave \none’s home.”  In re Abbott, 954 F.3d 772, 778 (5th Cir. 2020).5   \nFor that reason, courts generally review State action taken to preserve public health during \na pandemic under a deferential standard of review.  See, e.g., Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 28 (“Smallpox \nbeing prevalent and increasing at Cambridge, the court would usurp the functions of another \nbranch of government if it adjudged, as matter of law, that the mode adopted under the sanction of \nthe State, to protect the people at large, was arbitrary and not justified by the necessities of the \ncase.”); Compagnie Francaise de Navigation a Vapeur v. La State Bd. of Health, 186 U.S. 380, \n397 (1902) (upholding Louisiana’s quarantine of healthy passengers aboard a vessel during an \noutbreak  of  yellow  fever  against  a  Fourteenth  Amendment  challenge); Prince  v. \nMassachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166-67 (1944) (“[t]he right to practice religion freely does not \ninclude liberty to expose the community . . . to communicable disease”). \n                                                           \n5   Jacobson dealt with a state statute and county board of health regulation, and the Supreme Court thus had \nno occasion to pass upon the powers of the federal government in the context of a national public health emergency, \nnor any constitutional limitations that may apply to such powers. \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 15   Filed 05/22/20   Page 17 of 21   Page ID #296\nBut that deferential standard of review is not an abdication of judicial review.  Even in the \ncontext of a pandemic, State actions undertaken pursuant to the police power are subject to \nimportant limitations.  See Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 31, 38-39; Robinson v. Attorney Gen., 957 F.3d. \n1171, 1177 (11th Cir. 2020) (“[J]ust as constitutional rights have limits, so too does a state’s power \nto issue executive orders limiting such rights in times of emergency.”).  That is, even during a \npandemic, state actions undertaken in service of the public health cannot be divorced from that \nend and cannot clearly infringe constitutional rights.  Thus, “if a statute purporting to have been \nenacted to promote the public health, the public moral or the public safety, has no real or substantial \nrelation to those objects, or is, beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by \nthe fundamental law, it is the duty of the courts to so adjudge, and thereby give effect to the \nConstitution.”  Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 31.   \nState action may impermissibly deviate from having a “real or substantial relation” to the \npublic  health  in  a  number  of  ways.    First,  State  action  may  be  “exercised  in  particular \ncircumstances and in reference to particular persons” in “an arbitrary, unreasonable manner.”  Id. \nat 28.  For example, rules that allow recreational marijuana dispensaries to operate, but not flower \nshops, may be a sign that State action is impermissibly arbitrary and bears “no real or substantial \nrelation” to its proffered public health end.  Although “the day is gone when th[e Supreme] Court \nuses the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to strike down state laws, regulatory \nof business and industrial conditions, because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony \nwith a particular school of thought,” the Supreme Court still requires that a law be “rationally \nrelated to the public health and welfare.”  See Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma Inc., 348 \nU.S. 483, 488-89 (1955).  And when certain fundamental rights are at issue, Supreme Court \nprecedent requires more.  See, e.g., Maryvale Baptist Church, Inc. v. Beshear, 957 F.3d 610, 613 \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 15   Filed 05/22/20   Page 18 of 21   Page ID #297\n(6th Cir. 2020) (“We don’t doubt the Governor’s sincerity in trying to do his level best to lessen \nthe spread of the virus or his authority to protect the Commonwealth’s citizens . . . .  But restrictions \ninexplicably applied to one group and exempted from another do little to further these goals and \ndo much to burden religious freedom.”).   \nSecond, the Supreme Court has held that, even in a pandemic, a State may exceed the \nbounds of its police power when it “go[es] so far beyond what was reasonably required for the \nsafety of the public, as to authorize or compel the courts to interfere for the protection of such \npersons.”  Jacobson,  197  U.S.  at  28;  id.  (upholding  Massachusetts’  mandatory  vaccination \nrequirement in part because smallpox was “prevalent and increasing at Cambridge”); see also Lee \nOptical of Oklahoma, Inc., 348 U.S. at 488.     \nThird, a State action, purportedly taken pursuant to its police power, may raise federal \nconstitutional concerns in certain extraordinary cases where the action both is wholly unauthorized \nand imposes broad and intrusive restrictions on individual liberties.  After all, a pandemic does not \nexcuse a State from following its own law governing procedures to protect the public health.  See \nGerman Alliance Ins. Co. v. Hale, 219 U.S. 307, 317 (1911) (“[A]ll corporations, associations, and \nindividuals, within the jurisdiction of a state, are subject to such regulations, in respect of their \nrelative rights and duties, as the state may, in the exercise of its police power, and in harmony with \nits own and the Federal Constitution, prescribe for the public convenience and the general good.” \n(emphasis added)); Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 12 (noting that the board of health in Cambridge \npossessed the statutory authority to require and enforce the vaccination of its inhabitants).  And \nalthough “a mere error of state law is not a denial of due process,” Swarthout v. Cooke, 562 U.S. \n216, 222 (2011), the Supreme Court has also held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 15   Filed 05/22/20   Page 19 of 21   Page ID #298\nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution operates as a bulwark against arbitrary and oppressive action \nby the States, see, e.g., County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 847 (1998).   \nAlthough Bailey, as master of his complaint, elected not to press a constitutional claim—\nor, indeed, any federal claim—the arguments he makes implicate this potential limit on state \naction.  The Supreme Court has held that the “right to remove from one place to another according \nto inclination [is] an attribute of personal liberty protected by the Constitution,” Chicago v. \nMorales, 527 U.S. 41, 53 (1999), and the Orders plainly restrict that right, see Compl., Ex. 2, § 1 \n(“[A]ll individuals currently living within the State of Illinois are ordered to stay at home or at \ntheir place of residence except as allowed in this Executive Order.”).  Indeed, the Governor himself \nacknowledges numerous constitutional violations that may be implicated by Bailey’s complaint as \nresult of his Orders. Case 3:20-cv-00474-GCS, Doc. 1, Notice at ¶ 5-11 (First Amendment right \nto free exercise of religion, Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process, “liberty \ninterests” and the right to interstate travel, and the right to a Republican Form of Government \nconferred by Article IV, Section 4 of the United States Constitution). \nIf Bailey is correct that these executive orders are wholly without authorization under \nIllinois law, then the Orders’ imposition of broad and intrusive restrictions on the people of Illinois \nwould raise real questions about whether the people of Illinois have been deprived of their liberties \nwithout constitutionally adequate process.  And these constitutional claims will likely be raised in \nother litigation.  Cf. Compagnie Francaise de Navigation a Vapeur v. State Bd. of Health, 186 U.S. \n380, 393 (1902) (contrasting the quarantine law upheld against a Due Process Clause challenge in \nthat case with one not “lawfully adopted and enforced”).  But for all of the reasons discussed in \nPart I, potential implications for federal claims in other cases has never been sufficient to support \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 15   Filed 05/22/20   Page 20 of 21   Page ID #299\nremoval to a federal court.  See Gunn, 568 U.S. at 258 (emphasizing the “special and small \ncategory of cases in which arising under jurisdiction still lies”). \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should remand this matter to the Illinois Circuit Court, which is limited to the \nquestion whether the Governor has overstepped his authority under the Illinois statute.  While this \ncase is important, it does not arise under federal law and thus falls outside this Court’s jurisdiction.  \nIt is up to the Illinois courts to rule on Plaintiff’s claims, which, because of the sweeping nature of \nthe Orders, may affect millions of lives and raise significant constitutional concerns in other \nlitigation.   \nEven in the face of a pandemic—indeed, one might say especially in the face of a \npandemic—States must follow the legal processes they have established to protect their people’s \nhealth, while also protecting their people’s rights.  Such legal processes enable the States to make \nthe sensitive policy choices in a manner responsive to the people and, in doing so, both respect and \nserve the goals of our broader federal structure, including the guarantee of due process in the U.S. \nConstitution.  A remand of this matter will likewise respect our federal structure and allow those \nprocesses to unfold. \n \nDated:  May 22, 2020 \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00474-GCS   Document 15   Filed 05/22/20   Page 21 of 21   Page ID #300\n  Respectfully submitted, \n  ERIC S.
