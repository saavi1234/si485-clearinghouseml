    "summary": "<p>The plaintiff in this case was strip-searched after being arrested for a minor offense. He was not suspected of possessing drugs or weapons, and he was ultimately not charged with any crime, but the City of Chester's policy allowed police to conduct strip searches on anyone they arrested. In this lawsuit, filed by private counsel on February 25, 2019, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the plaintiff named the City of Chester and three police officers as defendants. He alleged that under 42 U.S.C. &sect;1983 the city had violated his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, as well as his rights under Pennsylvania law. He sought compensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Robert F. Kelly.</p>\r\n<p>On May 1, 2019, the plaintiff dismissed the majority of the claims in his complaint, stipulating that his Monell claim against the city would be limited to its policy and custom of strip searching detainees, and dismissing all other grounds for liability against the city (with prejudice), including his claim for punitive damages, his claim of malicious prosecution, and his state law claims. Three months later on August 1, he stipulated to the dismissal of one of the police officer defendants.</p>\r\n<p>The case was reassigned to Judge Paul S. Diamond in October 2019.</p>\r\n<p>The following year, on May 20, 2020, Judge Diamond denied the city&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment. The court held that it \"cannot conclude as a matter of law that the City&rsquo;s Policy comports with the Fourth Amendment.\" 461 F. Supp. 3d 173.</p>\r\n<p>On May 27, 2020, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, seeking class certification of a class of individuals who were, like him, arrested on minor charges and strip-searched in spite of the police having no particularized suspicion that they were carrying drugs, weapons, or other contraband. The putative class included all such people arrested from March 1, 1995 until such date as injunctive relief would be granted. This expanded complaint sought class-wide compensatory and punitive damages, a declaration that the city had violated the constitutional and statutory rights of the class members, and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief. The proposed injunction would require the city to &ldquo;establish appropriate policies and procedures for when strip-searches may be lawfully carried out,&rdquo; and would prohibit the city from conducting strip searches in minor arrests without a particularized suspicion that the suspect was concealing drugs, weapons, or other contraband. The complaint also sought attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. &sect;1988.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff moved to certify the class on September 16, 2020. While that motion was pending, the parties engaged in settlement negotiations and reached an agreement on January 27, 2021. The City agreed to revise its strip search policies and establish a settlement fund to pay out members of the class. The city also agreed to pay $25,000 to the named plaintiff, $275,000 in attorneys&rsquo; fees, administrative fees for overseeing the settlement, and $100-$1000 to each additional member of the class depending on the facts of their case. Judge Diamond conditionally approved the settlement on February 3, 2021, and granted final approval and class certification on May 19, 2021. The court retained jurisdiction to oversee the settlement, but no significant action has since been taken.&nbsp;</p>",

Alleging that the cityโs policy was a violation of his rights under Pennsylvania law and the United States Constitution, the plaintiff filed this suit as an individual on February 25, 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  In May 2020, he expanded his complaint to seek class certification for all people similarly arrested from 1995 onward. The City ultimately settled in January 2021 and agreed to revise its policies and pay $25,000 to the named plaintiff, $275,000 in attorneysโ fees, administrative fees for overseeing the settlement, and $100-$1000 to each additional member of the class.

This is a class action brought to address the deprivation by the City of Chester \n(โdefendantโ) of rights secured to Kenard Pitney (โplaintiffโ) and the proposed Class by the \nConstitution of the United States of America and the Constitution and laws of the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Since 1995, the City of Chester has enforced an illegal, \nunlawful policy requiring that all individuals placed in a holding cell must be subjected to an \nillegal,  humiliating, degrading strip search, without any consideration of the nature of the crime, \nthe circumstances of the arrest, and the particular characteristics of the arrestee.  These strip \nsearches, which include a search of the arresteesโ genitalia, are conducted despite the lack of any \nsuspicion that the arrestee may be carrying contraband.   These policies are derived from the \nwritten procedures of the City of Chester and/or the City of Chester Police Department.  They \nalso stem from the defendantโs deliberate indifference to the rights of persons detained by the \ndefendant.   \n\nCase 2:19-cv-00799-PD   Document 37   Filed 05/27/20   Page 2 of 16\n2.  The policy of the City of Chester to force all individuals who are to be placed in a \nholding cell to be subjected to a humiliating strip search, including a search of the genitalia, \ndespite the fact that those individuals may not be held with any other arrestees and are often \nbeing held for only a matter of minutes while their paperwork is processed.   Critically, these \nindividuals are stripped searched even through there is no suspicion that they might be carrying \ncontraband and without any consideration of the nature of the crime charged, the circumstances \nof the arrest or the particular characteristics of the arrestee.  In short, every citizen who is placed \nin a holding cell, even if they are to be held alone without any contact with any other detainees \nand despite the fact that they may be arrested for the most minor of offenses, is subjected to a \nhumiliating strip search including the inspection of their genitalia . \n  3.  Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of himself and a class of individuals who \nwere not only strip searched after being arrested for minor offenses, but who were strip searched \neither (a) prior to an appearance before a judge or judicial officer with authority to release the \ndetainee and/or (b) without being given a reasonable opportunity to post bail.  These searches \nwere conducted despite the fact that the individuals were not going to be placed in the general \npopulation at a correctional facility.  Blanket searches conducted in this fashion constitute a \nviolation of the Constitutional rights of plaintiff and the class members he seeks to represent.  \nSpecifically, these actions - - which were carried out pursuant to defendantโs policy - - were \ntaken against the plaintiff in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment of the United \nStatesโ Constitution.   \n  4.  Plaintiff seeks monetary damages individually and for each member of the \nproposed Class who have suffered from the wrongful actions of the defendant described herein, a \ndeclaration that defendantโs policies are unconstitutional and/or unlawful, and an injunction \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-00799-PD   Document 37   Filed 05/27/20   Page 3 of 16\nprecluding defendant from continuing to violate the rights of the persons detained and/or placed \nin its custody. \nJURISDICTION \n  5.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \nยงยง1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages and injunctive relief \nfor the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of the United States secured \nby the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1981 and 1983.  This Court also has \njurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. ยง2201, as it is filed to obtain \ndeclaratory relief relative to the constitutionality of the policies of a local government.  This \nCourt has supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffโs pendant state law claims under 42 U.S.C. \nยง1367(a) inasmuch as plaintiffโs state law claims are so related to plaintiffโs federal claims that \nthey form part of the same case or controversy as the federal claims.  \n  6.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยง1391(b)(2) because a substantial part of the \nevents or omissions giving rise to plaintiffโs and the classโ claims occurred within this judicial \ndistrict.   \nPARTIES \n  7.  Plaintiff Kenard Pitney is a resident of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and at \nall times relevant to this action was present in the City of Chester, Pennsylvania. \n  8.  Defendant, City of Chester, is a municipality of the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania and owns, operates, manages, directs and controls the Chester Police Department.  \nAt all times relevant hereto, the City of Chester, as well as its agents, servants and employees, \nwas responsible for the policies, practices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all \nmatters pertaining to the Chester Police Department, as well as for the appointment, training, \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-00799-PD   Document 37   Filed 05/27/20   Page 4 of 16\nsupervision and conduct of all Chester Police Department personnel.  In addition, at all relevant \ntimes, the City of Chester was responsible for enforcing the rules of the City of Chester and/or \nthe Chester Police Department and for ensuring the personnel employed by the City of Chester \nand the Chester Police Department obeyed the Constitution and laws of the United States and the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania.   \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n  9.  Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and (b) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure on behalf of himself and a Class of similarly situated individuals who were \narrested for misdemeanors or other minor violations and who were unlawfully and \nunconstitutionally strip-searched upon being detained and/or placed into custody by defendant. \n  10.  Specifically, the Class that plaintiff seeks to represent with regard to claims \nbrought pursuant to violations of rights protected by the United States Constitution, the \nPennsylvania Constitution and other applicable laws is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been (1) detained by and/or placed in the \ncustody of the Chester Police Department or any facility under the \nauthority of the City of Chester (2) as a result of being arrested \nand/or charged with non-indictable offenses such as: civil \nenforcement offenses, i.e., child support enforcement arrears, \ntraffic offenses, petty disorderly offenses, disorderly persons \noffenses, misdemeanors, contempt proceedings, failure to pay \nfinancial fines, penalties and/or costs in like matters as set forth \nabove; and/or failure to appear at any court proceedings on like \nmatters as set forth above; and (3) who were strip-searched upon \ntheir entry into detainment and/or custody and/or were strip-\nsearched prior to an appearance before a judge or judicial officer \nwho had the authority to release the person as referred to above \nfrom detainment and/or custody and/or (4) persons who appeared \nbefore a judge or judicial officer in the matters referred to above \nwho were not released from detainment and/or custody and who \nwere strip-searched as set forth above, and (5) the strip-search was \nconducted and/or performed according to the City of Chesterโs \nblanket strip search policy, that is, without reasonable suspicion \nand/or probable cause based on objective and articulable facts that \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-00799-PD   Document 37   Filed 05/27/20   Page 5 of 16\nthe aforesaid person or persons possessed controlled substances, \nweapons and/or other contraband.  The class includes persons who \nwere strip searched on or after March 1, 1995 and extends to the \ndate on which the City of Chester and the Chester Police \nDepartment are enjoined and/or cease to strip-search the class of \npersons referred to above. \n \n  11.  This Amended Complaint relates back to the original filing as it โasserts a claim . \n. . that arose out of the conduct, transaction or occurrence set out . . . in the original pleadingโ \nunder Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c).  No new facts need to be pled from the Complaint as filed. \n  12.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action \nunder federal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a). \n  13.  The members of the Class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable.  \nUpon information and belief there have been thousands of citizens arrested for non-felony and/or \nminor offenses who were placed into the custody of the City of Chester - - most, if not all, of \nwhom are members of the proposed Class.  Upon information and belief, the size of the proposed \nClass totals thousands of individuals, some of whom have had their civil rights violated on \nmultiple occasions. \n  14.  Upon information and belief, joinder of all of these individuals is impracticable \nbecause of the large number of Class members and the fact that the Class members are likely \ndisbursed over a large geographical area, with some members presently residing outside of \nPennsylvania and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, upon information and belief, many \nmembers of the Class are low-income persons, may not speak English, and likely would have \ngreat difficulty pursuing their rights individually.  \n  15.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class that \npredominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the Class.  The \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-00799-PD   Document 37   Filed 05/27/20   Page 6 of 16\npredominate common questions of law and fact include, without limitation, questions as to \nwhether the defendantโs written and/or de facto policies and practices of strip-searching \nindividuals who are charged with non-indictable charges or minor violations as defined in \nparagraph 10 when transferred to and/or placed into detention and/or custody of the City of \nChester, were illegal and/or  in violation of the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe United States Constitution, the Pennsylvania Constitution, Pennsylvania law and/or other \napplicable law, and whether such written and/or de facto policy and practices existed during the \nClass period.   \n  16.  Plaintiffโs claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class: Plaintiff \nand all members of the Class have sustained damages arising out of defendantโs course of \nconduct.  The harms suffered by plaintiff are typical of the harms suffered by the Class. \n  17.  The representative plaintiff has the requisite personal interest in the outcome of \nthis action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.   \n  18.  The representative plaintiff has retained counsel with substantial experience in the \nprosecution of class actions and civil rights litigation.  Plaintiffโs counsel has the resources, \nexpertise, and experience to successfully prosecute this action against the City of Chester.  No \nconflicts exist between plaintiff and members of the Class, or between counsel and members of \nthe Class. \n  19.  This action seeks, in part, declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the plaintiff \nseeks class certification under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2), in that all members of the proposed Class \nwere subjected to the same policies and acts of deliberate indifference.  In short, defendant City \nof Chester acted on grounds generally applicable to all members of the Class. \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-00799-PD   Document 37   Filed 05/27/20   Page 7 of 16\n  20.  In addition to certification under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2), and in the alternative, \nplaintiff seeks certification under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3). \n  21.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all individual members of the Class is \nimpracticable given the large number of members of the Class and the fact that they are \ndisbursed over a large geographical area.  Furthermore, the expenses and burden of individual \nlitigation will make it difficult or impossible for individual members of the Class to redress the \nwrongs done to them.  The cost to the federal court system of adjudicating thousands of \nindividual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation would also magnify the delay and \nexpense to all parties and the court system.  By contrast, the conduct of this action as a class \naction in this District presents far fewer management difficulties, conserves the resources of the \nparties and the court system, and protects the rights of each member of the Class. \n  22.  Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \ndefendantโs flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even though upon \ninformation and belief the defendant has maintained its illegal practices for many years. \n  23.  As an alternative to certification under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3), plaintiff also seeks \npartial certification under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(4).   \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nFacts Applicable To The Class Generally \n  24.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits government \nagencies and state officials, such as the defendant in this action and those it supervises, from \nperforming strip searches of arrestees who have been charged with misdemeanors or other minor \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-00799-PD   Document 37   Filed 05/27/20   Page 8 of 16\ncrimes unless there is a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing a weapon, drugs, or \nother contraband.   \n  25.  The City of Chester has instituted a written and/or de facto policy, custom or \npractice of strip searching all individuals who enter its custody and/or are detained by the \ndefendant, regardless of the nature of the individualโs charged crime and without the presence of \nreasonable suspicion to believe the individual was concealing a weapon, drugs or other \ncontraband.   \n  26.  The City of Chester knows that it may not institute, enforce or permit enforcement \nof a policy or practice of conducting strip searches without the presence of particularized, \nreasonable suspicion.  This Court and the Federal Courts of Appeal have stated repeatedly that \nstate officials may not strip search individuals charged with misdemeanors or other minor \nviolations in the absence of particularized, reasonable suspicion. \n  27.  The defendantโs written and/or de facto policy, practice and custom mandating \nwholesale strip searches of all misdemeanor and minor violation arrestees has been promulgated, \neffectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established law.  A reasonable \nsuspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from particular circumstances antecedent \nto the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, a particular characteristic of the arrestee, \nand/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n  28.  The City of Chester has promulgated, implemented, enforced and/or failed to \nrectify a written and/or de facto policy, practice or custom of strip searching all individuals \nplaced into custody and/or detained by the defendant without any reasonable suspicion, or indeed \nsuspicion of any sort, that such individuals were concealing a weapon, drugs or other contraband.  \nThis written and/or de facto policy made the strip searching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-00799-PD   Document 37   Filed 05/27/20   Page 9 of 16\nthe nature of the offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a \nparticular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of routine \nstrip searches.  The written and/or de facto policy, practice or custom of strip searching applied \nto all individuals โcharged by the Chester Police, or any other law enforcement agency with a \nviolation of law which will require that person to be placed in a locked cell or having contact \nwith others in custodyโ with the limited exception of those transported to Chester Lockup โfrom \nanother confinement facility who has remained under guard for the entire period of transport.โ   \n  29.  Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the Class, \nincluding the named plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip search upon being placed into \ncustody and/or detained by the defendant.  These searches were conducted without inquiry into \nor establishment of reasonable suspicion to support a strip search, and in fact, such searches were \nnot supported by such a reasonable suspicion.  Strip searches were and are conducted for \nindividuals arrested for, among other innocuous offenses, driving while intoxicated, harassment \nand trespassing.   \n  30.  As a direct and proximate result of unlawful strip searches conducted pursuant to \nthis written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches - - that is, each \nmember of the Class, including the named plaintiff - - has suffered and will suffer psychological \nharm, pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \nFacts Applicable To The Named Plaintiff \n  31.  Plaintiff Kenard Pitneyโs experiences are representative and corroborative of what \nmembers of the Class were subjected to.   \n  32.  As a detainee of the defendant, it is plaintiff Kenard Pitneyโs Constitutional right \nto be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-00799-PD   Document 37   Filed 05/27/20   Page 10 of 16\n  33.   On or about May 18, 2018, plaintiff visited the Harrahโs Casino located in \nDelaware County, Pennsylvania. \n  34.  At approximately 9:30 p.m., plaintiff exited the casino and went to the valet in the \ncasino parking lot.  Plaintiff instructed the valet that he wanted to retrieve some items that he left \nin the car. \n  35.  Plaintiff then walked over to where his vehicle was parked and waited for the \nvalet to arrive with his keys so that plaintiff could retrieve his items. \n  36.  After waiting for a few minutes, a security guard from Harrahโs approached the \nplaintiff and advised him  that the valet was not going to give him the keys to his vehicle as the \nvalet believed it would be best for plaintiff to either call a cab or Uber, or make other \narrangements to get home. \n  37.  Plaintiff advised the security guard that he wished to call a friend to drive him \nhome.  However, he once again told the security guard that he needed to get belongings out of \nhis vehicle.  The security guard again refused to unlock plaintiffโs vehicle door.  Plaintiff then \nasked for a supervisor. \n  38.  Within a few minutes, a supervisor did arrive on the scene and the supervisor also \nrefused plaintiffโs request to gain entry to his vehicle.  Plaintiff then asked the supervisor to call \nthe police.   \n  39.  In approximately five minutes, officers from the Chester Police Department \narrived on the scene at which time plaintiff was talking on his cell phone.  When plaintiff \nrequested a few more minutes to speak with his fiancรฉ to arrange a ride home the officers \nknocked plaintiffโs phone out of his hand and placed plaintiff in handcuffs before taking him to \nthe City of Chester police station, where he was handcuffed to a bench. \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-00799-PD   Document 37   Filed 05/27/20   Page 11 of 16\n40.  Eventually, plaintiff was placed into a holding cell by himself and strip searched \nby one of defendantโs officers.  During the course of the strip search, plaintiff was required to \nremove his clothes, and hold up his genitals so that the officer could observe the same. \n41.  The strip search was done in public and, upon information and belief, a female \nofficer may have been allowed to observe the strip search through closed-circuit television. \n42.  After approximately one and half hours at the police station, plaintiff was released \nafter being given a summons for public intoxication. \n43.  On or about July 19, 2018, the summons was dismissed. \n44.  At no time did defendant or its officers have reasonable cause to believe that \nplaintiff was concealing a weapon, drugs or other contraband, but nevertheless strip-searched \nplaintiff in conformity with its unconstitutional policy. \nCOUNT ONE \nViolation Of The United States And Pennsylvania Constitutions Under The Color \nOf State LawโUnreasonable Searches  \n  45.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation stated \nin the preceding paragraphs, as if fully set forth herein. \n  46.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens from \nunreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prevents officers from conducting strip \nsearches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or other minor violations absent some \nparticularized suspicion that the individual in question possesses either weapons, drugs or other \ncontraband. \n  47.  The actions of defendant detailed above violated plaintiffโs and the Classโ rights \nunder the United States Constitution.  Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for defendant \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-00799-PD   Document 37   Filed 05/27/20   Page 12 of 16\nto strip search plaintiff and Class members based merely on their arrest for misdemeanor or other \nminor criminal charges. \n  48.  These unlawful strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or \npractice of the City of Chester and/or the Chester Police Department.  As such, the City of \nChester is directly liable for the damages of the named plaintiff and the members of the Class. \n  49.  Upon information and belief, the City of Chester is responsible for establishing \nthe policies and procedures to be utilized by the Chester Police Department in detaining or \narresting individuals, and is responsible for the implementation of the strip-search policy and the \nunlawful practices described in this Complaint.  As such, the defendant is responsible for the \ndamages of the named plaintiff and members of the Class. \n  50.  The defendant knew that its strip search policy, practice or custom was illegal, \nand acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific intention to deprive plaintiff and members of \nthe class of their Constitutional rights.   \n  51.  This conduct of the City of Chester represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, \ngiven that its actions were undertaken under the color of state law. \n  52.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nplaintiff and members of the proposed Class have been irreparably injured and seek damages, as \nwell as declaratory and injunctive relief set out in the Prayer for Relief below. \nCOUNT TWO \nSupplemental State Law Claims  \n  53.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation stated \nin the preceding paragraphs, as if fully set forth herein. \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-00799-PD   Document 37   Filed 05/27/20   Page 13 of 16\n  54.  The acts of the defendant constitute an illegal search and seizure and intentional \nand/or negligent infliction of emotional distress under the laws of the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania, for which this Court has supplemental jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate these \nclaims. \n  55.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts as described above, \nplaintiffs have been irreparably injured and seek damages, as well as the declaratory and \ninjunctive relief set out in the Prayer for Relief below. \n \n \nCOUNT THREE \nDemand For Declaratory Judgment \n  56.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation stated \nin the preceding paragraphs, as if fully set forth herein. \n  57.  The policy, custom and/or practice of the City of Chester is clearly \nunconstitutional in that it is directing or conducting the strip search of all individuals taken into \ncustody and/or detained without any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question \npossess either weapons, drugs or other contraband. \n  58.  Plaintiff and the members of the Class request that this Court issue a declaratory \njudgment declaring the strip search policy of the City of Chester to be unconstitutional.   \nCOUNT FOUR \nDemand For Preliminary And Permanent Injunction \n59.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation stated \nin the preceding paragraphs, as if fully set forth herein. \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-00799-PD   Document 37   Filed 05/27/20   Page 14 of 16\n  60.  The policy, custom and practice of the City of Chester is clearly unconstitutional \nin that it is directing or conducting the strip search of all individuals taken into custody and/or \ndetained without any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question possess either \nweapons, drugs or other contraband.   \n  61.  Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place, with new and/or \nprospective members of the Class being subjected to the harms that have already been inflicted \nupon the named plaintiff and other members of the Class.   \n  62.  The continuing pattern of unlawfully strip-searching individuals charged with \nminor crimes will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the Class, \nfor which an adequate remedy does not exist at law. \n  63.  Plaintiff demands that the City of Chester immediately desist from strip searching \nindividuals placed into custody and/or detained by the defendant absent any particularized \nsuspicion that the individuals in question possess either weapons, drugs or other contraband, and \nseeks both a preliminary and permanent injunction from this Court ordering as much. \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n  64.  Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury as to all issues. \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \n  WHEREFORE, plaintiff Kenard Pitney, on behalf of himself and on behalf of a Class of \nothers similarly situated, requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment against defendant \nCity of Chester and grant them the following relief: \n    (a)  Enter or certify this action as a Class Action pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23, \nwith plaintiff as the Class representative; \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-00799-PD   Document 37   Filed 05/27/20   Page 15 of 16\n    (b)  A judgment against the defendant on plaintiffโs causes of actions detailed \nherein, awarding compensatory damages to the named plaintiff and each member of the proposed \nClass in an amount to be determined by a jury and/or the Court on both an individual and Class-\nwide basis; \n    (c)  A judgment in favor of plaintiff and each member of the proposed Class \njudgment against the defendant for punitive damages, in an amount to be determined by a jury \nand/or the Court on both an individual and Class-wide basis; \n \n    (d)  A judgment in favor of plaintiff and each member of the proposed Class \nfor prejudgment interest; \n    (e)  Declaratory and injunctive relief to establish appropriate policies and \nprocedures for when strip-searches may be lawfully carried out; \n    (f)  A preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining defendant from \ncontinuing to strip search individuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes absent \nparticularized, reasonable suspicion that the arrestee/detainee subjected to the search is \nconcealing weapons, drugs or other contraband; \n    (g)  A monetary award for attorneyโs fees and costs of this action, pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983 and 1988 and Fed.R.Civ.P. 23; and \n    (h)  Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:19-cv-00799-PD   Document 37   Filed 05/27/20   Page 16 of 16",
