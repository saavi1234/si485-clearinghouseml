Fin. Stability Oversight Council, 865 F.3d 661, 665 (D.C. Cir. 2017). Here, Defendants seek leave to file under seal Saint Elizabeths Hospital's Emergency Preparedness Plan (\"EPP\"). The EPP contains non -public details about operations at Saint Elizabeths Hospital and how the District plans to maintain operations during various emergency situations, including information about which kinds of patients are kept where, logistics for moving people in emergency situations, and locations of emergency supplies. The Court finds that the public interest in the disclosure of this document is low because little, if any of the EPP's contents bear on the matters being litigated in the case--the Defendants' response to COVID-19. Instead, the EPP's contents pertain to more general emergency preparedness measures. The reason for sealing, in contrast, is compelling. The EPP contains sensitive operational and security details that could be compromised by public disclosure. Accordingly, Defendants' motion for leave to file under seal, Dkt. 44, is hereby GRANTED. The EPP, Dkt. 44-1 (attached exhibits to Dkt. 44), shall be filed under SEAL. Signed by Judge Randolph D. Moss on 04/22/2020.

The extension is warranted because the public health crisis at Saint Elizabeths Hospital continues, because amici have provided the Court with their preliminary report, which supports the need for continued judicial relief, because amici will not provide their final, written report to the Court until 5:00 pm on May 11, 2020, and because the Court will need an opportunity to determine whether the TRO should be extended and/or modified in light of that report. For the reasons the Court has previously explained, Plaintiffs have established that they are likely to prevail on the merits, that they risk suffering irreparable harm in the absence of emergency relief, and that the public interest and balance of harms tip in favor emergency relief. Finally, the Court notes that these proceedings have not occurred ex parte and that the Court has had the opportunity to hear from, and to consider the views of, both Plaintiffs and Defendants.

          "description": "MINUTE ORDER: Pending before the Court is Plaintiffs' motion to file a surreply brief or, in the alternative, to strike certain arguments in Defendants' reply brief. Dkt. 116 . Defendants opposed the motion, Dkt. 119, and Plaintiffs replied, Dkt. 120 . In the parties' briefing, an entirely different dispute emerged about whether Defendants had complied with the Court's prior order that they provide Plaintiffs with jurisdictional discovery. At a hearing on January 22, 2020, the Court granted in part Plaintiffs' motion for jurisdictional discovery. See Minute Entry (Jan. 22, 2020). The Court permitted jurisdictional discovery \"as to items 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 of Exhibit 1,\" and the Court also permitted, \"[a]s to item 8 of Exhibit 1,\" Plaintiffs to \"serve a request for admission as outlined by the Court on the record.\" Id. Defendants argue that they complied with that order by denying a request for admission from Plaintiffs. Dkt. 119 at 34; Dkt. 119 -2 at 5. Plaintiffs contend that Defendants, by denying the request for admission, have complied with only one of six parts of the Court's order of jurisdictional discovery and that Plaintiffs \"are still lacking critical information\" needed to respond to Defendants' jurisdictional arguments. Dkt. 120 at 2. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that Defendants have not yet fully complied with the Court's order granting jurisdictional discovery. The Court will therefore ORDER that Defendants serve on Plaintiffs the full jurisdictional discovery outlined in the Court's prior order on or before November 16, 2020. It is hereby further ORDERED that the parties shall file a joint status report on the progress of jurisdictional discovery on or before November 16, 2020. The Court will reserve judgment on the motion to file a surreply until after the completion of jurisdictional discovery. Signed by Judge Randolph D. Moss on 10/13/2020. (lcrdm2)"

Dkt. 116 . Defendants opposed the motion, Dkt. 119, and Plaintiffs replied, Dkt. 120 . In those briefs, a separate-yet-related dispute emerged over whether Defendants had fully complied with the Court's prior order directing them to produce jurisdictional discovery. The Court thus ordered Defendants to complete jurisdictional discovery and reserved judgment on the motion to file a sur-reply until after the completion of jurisdictional discovery. The parties have now filed a joint status report, Dkt. 127, indicating that jurisdictional discovery is complete and renewing their respective positions on the necessity of the sur-reply. Upon consideration of the parties' submissions, it is hereby ORDERED that Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a sur-reply or, in the alternative, to strike arguments not previously raised, is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Plaintiffs may file a sur-reply of no more than seven pages on or before December 11, 2020. In their brief, Plaintiffs may address only (1) the applicability in this case of the voluntary cessation exemption to the mootness doctrine, in light of Defendants' contention that they ceased the challenged behavior independent of this litigation, and (2) the timeliness of Plaintiffs' motion for class certification. The Court will not, however, strike Defendants' arguments. Signed by Judge Randolph D. Moss on 12/2/2020. (lcrdm2)"

    "summary": "<p>On October 23, 2019, four individuals at Saint Elizabeths Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in D.C., filed this action in the U.S. District Court for the District of D.C. on behalf of themselves and all other patients at the hospital. Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of the D.C., Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights &amp; Urban Affairs, and private counsel, the plaintiffs sued the District of Columbia and Saint Elizabeths Hospital. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2201, alleging violations of their Fifth Amendment Due Process rights, and violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. &sect; 12131. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that Saint Elizabeths had not had safe, running water since at least September 26, 2019, the date the water supply was completely turned off. This prohibited patients and staff from routinely flushing toilets, washing their hands, showering, drinking water from water fountains, and washing their clothing. The case was initially assigned to Judge Christopher R. Cooper, but randomly reassigned to Judge. Randolph D. Moss on October 30, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on December 16, 2019, arguing that the plaintiffs had failed to state a Due Process or ADA claim and that the hospital officials were entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\r\n<p>On January 21, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class, seeking to represent \"all current and future Saint Elizabeths Hospital patients.\"</p>\r\n<p>On April 16, the plaintiffs filed a motion to amend their complaint in light of COVID-19, adding a petition for writ of habeas corpus. They alleged that although the defendants had turned the water back on in October 2019, they continued to foster conditions that exacerbated the dangers to their patients by failing to take adequate steps to protect their patients from COVID-19. Plaintiffs also asserted that, as of April 15, four patients had died of COVID-19 and that \"32 patients and 47 staff at the Hospital have tested positive for COVID-19.\" The motion was granted on April 22. 2020 WL 1935524.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order on April 18, requesting the court order the defendants to reduce the population, both by halting admission to the hospital and releasing current patients, and to develop COVID-19 mitigation measures including testing, hygiene products, social distancing, educational programming, and daily reporting. The defendants filed a motion in opposition on April 21.</p>\r\n<p>On April 25, Judge Moss granted in part the plaintiff's motion for a temporary restraining order, ordering the defendants to isolate individuals exposed to COVID-19, conduct clinical evaluations prior to releasing individuals from isolation, and produce bi-weekly reports of compliance with the order. 456 F.Supp.3d 126 (Apr. 25, 2020). Following a status conference, this order was extended until May 11.</p>\r\n<p>On May 11, Judge Moss again extended and expanded the temporary restraining order, additionally requiring defendants to complete and report the results of two baseline point prevalence surveys to determine the spread of COVID-19 among staff and residents at the facility, and to assign staff to only one unit per day. 2020 WL 2410502.</p>\r\n<p>On May 14, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction, requesting the incorporation of the current restraining order into an injunction, a reduction of the number of patients in the facility, appropriate mental health care, the appointment of an independent monitor, and reporting. The defendants filed a motion in opposition on May 19.</p>\r\n<p>The court granted the plaintiffs' motion in part on May 24, converting the temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction which required the defendants to file a status report by June 8 detailing plans for further mitigation measures in the facility. The court denied the plaintiffs' motion in all other respects. 464 F.Supp.3d 132 (May 24, 2020).</p>\r\n<p>On June 22, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. They also filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment on July 10. The plaintiffs opposed the motion to dismiss on August 14 and the defendants continued continued to submit bi-monthly notices of compliance to the court.</p>\r\n<p>On April 30, 2021 the parties filed an unopposed motion to vacate the Preliminary Injunction as it was moot, which the court granted on May 3. The parties then filed a motion to stay the litigation in the district court while they attempted to discuss possible resolution of the matter until November 9, 2021</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.</p>",

Civil Action No. 19-3185 (RDM) \n \nBARBARA J. BAZRON, et al., \n \n  Defendants. \n \n \nORDER \nFor reasons set forth in the accompanying Memorandum Opinion, Dkt. 82, the Court \nconcludes that good cause exists to extend and to expand the Temporary Restraining Order, Dkt. \n60.  Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:  \n1.  Exposed Patients.  To the extent medically and psychiatrically practicable, Defendants \nshall isolate individuals who have been exposed to COVID-19 in individual quarantine \nspaces and shall minimize movement outside of the isolation space.  When it is necessary \nfor isolated individuals to leave their rooms, Defendants shall require (to the extent \npossible and consistent medically and psychiatrically practicable) that the isolated patient \nwear a medically suitable mask.  Likewise, when it is necessary for another person to \nenter a room occupied by an isolated patient, that person shall (to the extent medically \nand psychiatrically practicable) wear suitable protective equipment, including a medically \nsuitable mask.  Isolation of a patient who has been exposed to COIVD-19 may \ndiscontinued after the patient receives two negative tests at least 24 hours apart or if the \npatient is not symptomatic for 14 days. \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 83   Filed 05/11/20   Page 2 of 3\n2.  Symptomatic Patients.  Defendants shall conduct clinical evaluations prior to \nreleasing patients suspected of having COVID-19 (i.e., symptomatic patients) from \nisolation, and, if “a higher clinical suspicion” for COVID-19 exists, Defendants shall \nadminister test-based criteria of two negative tests, at least 24 hours apart, prior to \ndiscontinuing isolation.  In determining whether the patient presents “a higher clinical \nsuspicion for COVID-19, Hospital staff shall consider the prevalence of the virus \namong patients and staff at the Hospital, among other factors.  If testing is not readily \nfeasible, Defendants shall administer the CDC recommended non-test-based strategy. \n3.  Staff Assignment Restrictions.  To the extent medically and psychiatrically practicable, \nhealth care personnel and other staff shall be assigned daily to only one unit.  If health \ncare personnel work overtime, they should be assigned to the same unit they have been \nworking on throughout the day.   \n4.  Point prevalence surveys.  By May 15, 2020, Defendants shall complete a baseline point \nprevalence survey (“PPS”) to determine the spread of COVID-19 among staff and, to the \nextent medically and psychiatrically possible, residents at Saint Elizabeths Hospital.  A \nsingle test for each staff member or patient is sufficient for purposes of the PPS.  If a \nhealth care personnel is found to be COVID positive, she must be excluded from the \nHospital for 14 days and until she is found negative on two consecutive tests, at least 72 \nhours apart.  By May 22, 2020, Saint Elizabeths shall complete a second PPS.  \nDefendants shall provide updates to the Court and Plaintiffs’ counsel regarding its efforts \nto complete point prevalent surveys on May 16, 2020, and May 23, 2020. \n5.  Data Management.  It is recommended that the D.C. Department of Health immediately \nassign a dedicated individual with appropriate epidemiological skills to oversee and be \nresponsible for the collation and analysis of all testing data, and all data pertaining to \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 83   Filed 05/11/20   Page 3 of 3\ninfection prevention and control policies and procedures.  It is recommended that this \nindividual work with on-site personnel already responsible for these functions and would, \nbased on the data, advise Hospital administrators regarding any indicated changes in \npolicy and other appropriate courses of action. \n6.  Reporting.  Defendants shall provide the Court and Plaintiffs’ counsel with reports twice \na week, commencing on Tuesday, May 12, 2020 and Friday, May 15, 2020, detailing \ntheir efforts to comply with this Order.  The report should identify every symptomatic \npatient removed from isolation and the basis for the decision to remove that individual \nfrom isolation and shall indicate the number of exposed patients subject to isolation.  \n7.  Expiration.  This Order shall expire at 11:59 pm on May 22, 2020. \n8.  Security.  The Court finds that the posting a bond is not required given the nature of the \nrelief ordered herein. \n9.  Persons and Entities Bound.  This Order is binding on Defendants, their officers, agents, \nservants, employees, and attorneys, and on other persons acting in concert with them. \nSO ORDERED. \n                                      /s/ Randolph D.

Civil Action No. 19-3185 (RDM) \n \n \nBARBARA J. BAZRON, et al., \n \n  Defendants. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \nBefore the Court are the parties’ respective positions on extending the temporary \nrestraining order (“TRO”), Dkt. 60, which is set to expire at 11:59 pm tonight.  Plaintiffs propose \nthat the Court extend the TRO until May 25, 2020 and also request that the Court expand the \nTRO in three respects.  Dkt. 74 at 1.  Defendants oppose extending or expanding the TRO.  Id. at \n6.  For the reasons explained below, the Court finds that there is good cause to extend it until \nMay 22, 2020 and to expand it in two respects.  The Court further encourages—but does not at \nthis time order—Defendants to implement amici’s other recommendations to the extent possible \nand consistent with the health and well-being of the patients (and staff) at Saint Elizabeths \nHospital. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nThe Court has recounted much of the relevant factual background and procedural history \nat length in its earlier memorandum opinion, see Costa v. Bazron, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73944, \nat *2–14 (D.D.C. Apr. 25, 2020) (“Costa I”), and will only summarize and add to that \nbackground as necessary here. \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 82   Filed 05/11/20   Page 2 of 9\nThe last time this case was before the Court, Plaintiffs had moved for a TRO seeking \nimmediate redress with respect to a number of allegedly unsafe and unconstitutional conditions \nat Saint Elizabeths Hospital resulting from the rapid spread of COVID-19 among the patients and \nstaff at the hospital.  Dkt. 39.  In the week that followed, the Court held a telephonic hearing to \naddress the Plaintiffs’ motion; requested that Plaintiffs identify the actions that, in their view, \nneeded to be redressed on the most pressing basis; ordered that the parties meet and confer, along \nwith the parties’ experts, regarding those high priority concerns; and held a second telephonic \nhearing to address the high priority concerns as to which the parties disagreed.  See Costa v. \nBazron, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73944, at *2–14.   \nUpon consideration of the parties respective positions, the briefs, and all of the relevant \nevidence before it at that time, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a TRO in part and \ndeferred ruling on the motion in part, Dkt. 59, and entered a TRO, Dkt. 60.  The TRO, which \nremains in effect at this hour, requires the hospital (1) to isolate individuals who have been \nexposed to COVID-19 in individual quarantine spaces to the extent medically and psychiatrically \npracticable; (2) to conduct clinical evaluations prior to releasing patients suspected of having \nCOVID-19 from isolation, and, if higher clinical suspicion exists, to administer the CDC-\nrecommended, two-test release protocol; and (3) to provide the Court and Plaintiffs’ counsel with \nperiodic reports detailing their efforts to comply with the Order.  Id. at 1–2.  The TRO is set to \nexpire at 11:59 pm tonight unless extended for good cause.  Id. at 2. \nThree days after the Court issued the TRO, it held a status conference and directed the \nparties to meet and confer as to the appointment of a third party (or parties) to conduct the fact-\nfinding necessary for further proceedings.  Minute Entry (Apr. 28, 2020).  The parties identified \nthree potential candidates: Dr. Ronald Waldman, an infectious disease expert with vast \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 82   Filed 05/11/20   Page 3 of 9\nexperience on advising public health entities; Joan Hebden, a specialist in infection prevention \nand control; and Dr. Patrick Canavan, a licensed psychologist, and former CEO of Saint \nElizabeths, who could advise on the mental health treatment aspects of Plaintiffs’ claims.  Dkt. \n65 at 2.  Because the parties had some disagreement about the proper scope of the fact-finding \ninquiry, the Court held another telephonic status conference to address the disputed issues.  \nMinute Entry (May 1, 2020).  After hearing from the parties, the Court appointed Dr. Ronald \nWaldman, Joan Hebden, and Dr. Patrick Canavan as amici curiae to conduct an investigation \nand to provide information to the Court relating to a list of questions relevant to Plaintiffs’ \nclaims.  Dkt. 68.   \nOn May 7, 2020, the Court held a further status conference at which the Court-appointed \namici presented their preliminary findings and recommendations.  Dkt. 77.  That same day, the \nCourt extended the TRO until May 11, 2020, at 11:59 pm, finding that good cause existed \nbecause, among other things, amici’s written report would not be finalized until May 11, 2020, \nand the Court would “need an opportunity to determine whether the TRO should be extended \nand/or modified in light of that report.”  Minute Order (May 7, 2020).  The Court was further \nconvinced, based on the preliminary report, that good cause existed for extending the TRO until \nMay 11, 2020.  The next day, the parties filed a joint status report setting forth their respective \npositions on whether the TRO should be further extended or expanded.  Dkt. 74.   \nAmici have now filed their reports with the Court summarizing their findings and \nrecommendations.  Dkt. 78; Dkt. 81.  Those reports are remarkably thorough, balanced, and \nconsidered, particularly given the very short timeframe amici had to investigate and to report on \nthe fast-evolving circumstances at Saint Elizabeths.  Amici, moreover, were uniformly impressed \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 82   Filed 05/11/20   Page 4 of 9\nwith the cooperation that the received from the staff and management at the hospital.  The Court \nextends its gratitude to amici and the hospital’s staff and management for their mutual efforts. \nII.  ANALYSIS \nA TRO expires at the earlier of 14 days after the time of its entry or the date the court \nsets, “unless before that time, the court, for good cause, extends [the TRO] for a like period or \nthe adverse party consents to a longer extension.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(2).  Although there is \nlittle case law on what constitutes “good cause,” “a showing that the grounds for originally \ngranting the [TRO] continue to exist” is sufficient, Wright & Miller, 11A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. \n§ 2953 (3d ed. Apr. 2020 Update), and courts have also found “good cause” where more time is \nneeded fully to consider the parties’ arguments and motions or “where the moving party need[s] \nadditional time to prepare and present its preliminary injunction,” SEC v. Arisebank, No. 18-cv-\n186, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 234235, at *3 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 9, 2018) (collecting cases). \nHere, Plaintiffs request that the TRO be extended until the Court “renders a decision on \n[their] forthcoming motion for a preliminary injunction.”  Dkt. 74 at 2.  Although Plaintiffs \nacknowledge that the TRO has “helped slow the spread of the virus” at Saint Elizabeths, id. at 3, \nthey also stress that the “number of [COVID-19 positive] patients and staff . . . and the number \nof fatalities has continued to climb,” id. at 2.  They note, for example, that, as of May 6, 2020, \n“the number of COVID-19 positive individuals has doubled from 36 to 72 . . ., and the number of \npatients who have died has more than tripled, from 4 to 13.”  Id. at 2.  Since filing the joint status \nreport, moreover, the Court has learned that an additional patient has died, bringing the death toll \namong a relatively small population to 14.   \nPlaintiffs also ask that the TRO be expanded in three ways.  They contend that, although \nthe hospital’s “practices have improved since the Court entered the TRO,” Defendants are still \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 82   Filed 05/11/20   Page 5 of 9\n“failing to meet professional standards” in at least three key respects identified by the amici at \nthe May 7, 2020, status conference.  Id. at 5.  First, although the hospital has tested all patients \nand staff, it has not conducted a “point prevalence testing” survey, as recommended by the CDC.  \nId.  Second, the hospital has not fully restricted cross-unit staff movement—more specifically, \nPlaintiffs contend that staff should not mix between COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative \nunits.  Id.  Third, Plaintiffs ask the Court to order that the District of Columbia Department of \nHealth assign a professional epidemiologist to assist the hospital with data management.  Id.  \nDefendants oppose any extension or expansion of the TRO.  In their view, further emergency \nrelief is not warranted because “the Hospital’s practices and protocols on infection control have \nbeen and continue to be in line with sound professional judgment.”  Id. at 6. \nHaving considered the parties’ respective positions, the final reports submitted by amici, \nDkt. 81; Dkt. 78, and the entirety of the record, the Court finds that good cause exists to extend \nthe TRO and to expand it in certain limited respects.  As a starting point, the Court finds that \ngood cause exists to extend the TRO because the parties need time to brief, and the Court needs \ntime to consider, the forthcoming motion for a preliminary injunction.  See Arisebank, 2018 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 234235, at *3.  But even setting aside that reason, the conditions at the hospital \nwarrant the extension of the TRO.  The Court recognizes, to be sure, that the hospital has taken \nan array of measures to combat the spread of infection and that the pandemic presents a \nformidable challenge that is dynamic and ongoing.  See Dkt. 81 (observing that the hospital “has \nmade a remarkable effort to cohort patients who have known infection with COVID-19”).  But \nthe infection control measures currently at issue were adopted shortly after the Court issued the \nTRO, and the good faith and conscientious compliance with the Court’s order does not \ndemonstrate that extension of the order is unwarranted.  The Court previously found that the \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 82   Filed 05/11/20   Page 6 of 9\nhospital’s pre-TRO efforts fell short in the specified respects, see Dkt. 59, and no new evidence \nsuggests that the Court’s finding was incorrect.  To the contrary, amici have endorsed the \nmeasures specified in the existing TRO and have affirmed that those measures are required as a \nmatter of sound professional judgment.   \nMoreover, as Plaintiffs observe, the public health crisis at the hospital is ongoing—“[a]s \nrecently as  May 9, 2020, . . . tests from six patients not house on COVID [positive] units and \none staff member were reported . . . positive for viral RNA.”  Dkt. 81 at 2.  As the Court \npreviously observed, this crisis presents an imminent threat to Plaintiffs and, since the Court \nissued the TRO, the spread of the virus has continued to have tragic consequences for patients at \nthe hospital.  The Court has never doubted, and does not currently doubt, that the staff and \nmanagement at the hospital are committed to protecting the health and well-being of their \npatients.  Nor does the Court doubt that the task of managing and mitigating the spread of the \ndisease at a facility like Saint Elizabeths presents extraordinary challenges.  But, despite that \ncommitment, Defendants’ efforts, and the fact that the hospitals’ staff and management have \ndone many things very well, amici report that the hospital is not adhering to CDC guidelines in at \nleast two key respects.   \nFirst, although the hospital has embarked on a point prevalence survey (“PPS”) of all \npatients, it has not included staff in its PPS as recommended for facilities with suspected or \nconfirmed cases.  Dkt. 81-1 at 6.  The CDC guidance identified by amici explains the importance \nof including staff in the PPS.  “[W]hen COVID-19 cases are identified in a [long-term care \nfacility], there are often [Health Care Practitioners (‘HCP’)] with asymptomatic [COVID-19] \ninfection present as well,” and, as a result, “HCP likely contribute to [the] introduction and \nfurther spread” of COVID-19.  CDC, Testing for Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Nursing Homes \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 82   Filed 05/11/20   Page 7 of 9\n(Apr. 30, 2020), available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/nursing-homes-\ntesting.html.  As a result, the CDC recommends that “PPS of HCP should be considered in \nfacilities with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19” as part of a test-based prevention \nstrategy.  Id.  Consistent with the CDC’s experience and given the hospital’s extensive efforts at \ncohorting, amici posit that staff is the most likely source of continued infection spread at Saint \nElizabeths.  See Dkt. 77 at 10–12.  Amici therefore stress that it was important to “at least be in \nconformance with [CDC] guidelines, if not even going beyond them on the conservative side” as \nthe crisis at the hospital is “not just starting now,” but rather has “been allowed to develop to \nwhere it is at this point.  Id. at 12.  Thus, Amici recommend that the hospital conduct a PPS that \nincludes both patients and staff and that the hospital re-test, en masse, at regular intervals.  See \nDkt. 18-1 at 6. \nSecond, amici emphasize that infection control requires reducing “traffic within the \nhospital”—specifically, reducing staff movement between COVID positive and COVID negative \nunits.  Dkt. 77 at 10–11.   Amici were “emphatic in saying that while in the past this has not been \nrespected, there should be no mixing of staff between these units.  Id.  Consistent with the \nrelevant CDC guidance, Amici recommend that staff “be assigned daily to only one unit” and if \nstaff work overtime, that it be “on the same unit they have been working throughout the day.”  \nDkt. 81-1 at 5; see also Dkt. 54-1 at 10 (CDC recommending that facilities assign dedicated HCP \nto COVID positive or suspected units, meaning “HCP are assigned to care only for these patients \nduring their shift”).   \n  Because Defendants agree that the hospital should follow CDC recommendations, see, \ne.g., Dkt. 54-2, and because amici have underscored the reasons why it is important for the \nfacility to abide by these recommendations, the Court concludes that the hospital’s unexplained \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 82   Filed 05/11/20   Page 8 of 9\nfailure to abide by the CDC guidance in this respect is not based on the exercise of professional \njudgment.  For this reason, and in light of the Court’s previously analysis, Costa I, 2020 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 73944, at *27–29 (explaining that Plaintiffs have established irreparable harm, and \nthat the balance of hardships and public interest favor injunctive relief), the Court finds that good \ncause exists to expand the scope of the TRO to require the hospital to abide by these two \nrecommendations.  \nIn contrast to those two measures, the Court is unpersuaded that, at least on the present \nrecord, Defendants’ failure to assign an epidemiologist to the facility warrants emergency relief.  \nAt the May 7, 2020, status conference, amici reported “that it would be a good idea for the \nDepartment of Health to assign an epidemiologist to the facility” to help with data management \nand that the District is apparently considering that recommendation.  Dkt. 77 at 16.  The final \nwritten report, likewise, recommends that the Court order the District “to assign a dedicated \nindividual with appropriate epidemiological skills to oversee and be responsible for the collation \nand analysis of all testing data, and all data pertaining to infection prevention and control policies \nand procedures.”  Dkt. 81 at 9.  On the present record, what is not clear to the Court, however, is \nwhether failing to do so would constitute a “substantial departure” from professional judgement \nor whether it is merely a departure from a preferred or optimal response.  Like amici, the Court \nurges Defendants to take this measure, but the Court is unconvinced that Defendants’ failure to \ndo so constitutes a violation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.  Similarly, although not yet \naddressed in the parties’ briefs, the Court also urges Defendants immediately to implement \namici’s other, significant recommendations to the extent consistent with patient health and well-\nbeing. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 82   Filed 05/11/20   Page 9 of 9\nHaving resolved issues of substance, the last issue is duration.  It is well-settled that 28 \ndays is the outer limit for the time that a TRO can remain in place without consent of the \nenjoined party, regardless of whether the TRO was issued with or without notice.  See H-D \nMichigan, LLC v. Hellenic Duty Free Shops S.A., 694 F.3d 827, 844 (7th Cir. 2012); see also \nSampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 87 (1974) (agreeing with a lower court’s conclusion that “a \ntemporary restraining order continued beyond the time permissible under Rule 65 must be \ntreated as a preliminary injunction, and must conform to the standards applicable to preliminary \ninjunctions”).  Applying that limit here, and because Defendants do not consent to any further \nextension, the TRO cannot be extended beyond May 22, 2020, at 11:59 pm. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons explained above, the Court will extend the TRO until May 22, 2020 at 11:59 \npm and will expand the TRO in the limited respects discussed above.  \nA separate order will issue. \n                                      /s/ Randolph D.

Civil Action No. 19-3185 (RDM) \n \nBARBARA J. BAZRON, et al., \n \n  Defendants. \n \n \nORDER \nFor reasons set forth in the accompanying Memorandum Opinion, Dkt. 59, the Court \nconcludes that Plaintiffs have established that they are entitled to emergency injunctive relief.  \nAccordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order, Dkt. \n39, is GRANTED in part and DEFERRED in part.  It is further ORDERED that:  \n1.  Exposed Patients.  To the extent medically and psychiatrically practicable, Defendants \nshall isolate individuals who have been exposed to COVID-19 in individual quarantine \nspaces and shall minimize movement outside of the isolation space.  When it is necessary \nfor isolated individuals to leave their rooms, Defendants shall require (to the extent \npossible and consistent medically and psychiatrically practicable) that the isolated patient \nwear a medically suitable mask.  Likewise, when it is necessary for another person to \nenter a room occupied by an isolated patient, that person shall (to the extent medically \nand psychiatrically practicable) wear suitable protective equipment, including a medically \nsuitable mask.  The parties shall meet and confer and submit to the Court a joint status \nreport on or before April 28 at 2:00 pm setting forth their respective positions about when \nto discontinue isolation of exposed persons.  In any event, isolation of a patient who has \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 60   Filed 04/25/20   Page 2 of 3\nbeen exposed to COIVD-19 may discontinued after the patient receives two negative tests \nat least 24 hours apart or if the patient is not symptomatic for 14 days. \n2.  Symptomatic Patients.  Defendants shall conduct clinical evaluations prior to \nreleasing patients suspected of having COVID-19 (i.e., symptomatic patients) from \nisolation, and, if “a higher clinical suspicion” for COVID-19 exists, Defendants shall \nadminister test-based criteria of two negative tests, at least 24 hours apart, prior to \ndiscontinuing isolation.  In determining whether the patient presents a higher clinical \nsuspicion for COVID-19, Hospital staff shall consider the prevalence of the virus \namong patients and staff at the Hospital, among other factors.  If testing is not readily \nfeasible, Defendants shall administer the CDC recommended non-test-based strategy. \n3.  Reporting.  Defendants shall provide the Court and Plaintiffs’ counsel with reports twice \na week, commencing on Tuesday, April 28, 2020 and Friday, May 1, 2020, detailing their \nefforts to comply with this Order.  The report should identify every symptomatic patient \nremoved from isolation and the basis for the decision to remove that individual from \nisolation and shall indicate the number of exposed patients subject to isolation.  \n4.  Expiration.  This Order shall expire at 11:59 pm on May 8, 2020, unless extended for \ngood cause before that time. \n5.  Security.  The Court finds that the posting a bond is not required given the nature of the \nrelief ordered herein. \n   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 60   Filed 04/25/20   Page 3 of 3\n6.

Civil Action No. 19-3185 (RDM) \n \n \nBARBARA J. BAZRON, et al., \n \n  Defendants. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \nThis case is brought by three patients indefinitely and involuntarily civilly committed to \nthe District of Columbia’s care and housed at Saint Elizabeths Hospital (“Saint Elizabeths” or \n“Hospital”), a public psychiatric facility, and a putative class of Saint Elizabeths patients.  Dkt. \n50.  Plaintiffs bring claims against the District of Columbia and two employees of Saint \nElizabeths in their individual capacities (and in one case, also in his official capacity), alleging \nthat Defendants’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic has fallen short of their constitutional \nobligations to ensure that Plaintiffs and the putative class members are held in safe conditions.  \nBefore the Court is Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”), which is \nopposed.  Dkt. 39.  For the reasons explained below, the Court will grant the motion in part and \ndefer it in part. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.       Saint Elizabeths, and COVID-19 \nSaint Elizabeths is the District of Columbia’s “only public psychiatric facility for \nindividuals with serious and persistent mental illness who need intensive inpatient care to \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 59   Filed 04/25/20   Page 2 of 18\nsupport their recovery.” Dkt. 50 at 7 (Am. Compl. ¶ 25); Dkt. 39-2 at 2 (Jones Decl. ¶ 7).  Saint \nElizabeths generally admits three categories of patients: (1) civilly committed patients, including \nthose committed voluntarily and involuntarily; (2) pre-trial patients being detained to determine \ntheir competency to stand trial or to have their competency restored; (3) and post-trial patients \nwho have been adjudicated not guilty by reason of insanity.  See Dkt. 39-1 at 14; Dkt. 42-1 \n(Candilis Decl. ¶ 3).  The Hospital has the capacity to house 292 patients in 12 different units and \nhas an average population of 275 patients.  Dkt. 42-2 at 3 (Gontang Decl. ¶ 6).  The “patients are \nhoused in one of 11 units[] or houses,” with each unit consisting of “bedrooms and commons \nspaces.”  Dkt. 50 at 8 (Am. Compl. ¶ 33).  “Each unit at the Hospital generally houses no more \nthan 27 patients, and has bedrooms, common living areas, bathrooms and showering facilities, \nand dining areas.”  Dkt. 42-2 at 3 (Gontang Decl. ¶ 6).  The twelfth unit, the Therapeutic \nLearning Center (“2TR”), is generally used to conduct group therapy, art therapy, music therapy, \ntreatment planning meetings, and other forms of congregate activities.  Dkt. 50 at 4 (Am. Compl. \n¶ 9).  According to Defendants’ counsel, the current population has been reduced to \napproximately 200 patients due to the pandemic.  Apr. 24, 2020 Hrg. Tr. (Rough at 31). \nThe COVID-19 pandemic is, by now, well-known to all, and the Court will only briefly \nrecount its history and impact as it relates to this motion.  COVID-19 a highly infectious disease \nthat has caused a global pandemic, prompting the President and governors across the nation to \ndeclare states of emergency.  See United States v. Harris, No. 19-cr-356, 2020 WL 1503444, at \n*2 (D.D.C. Mar. 27, 2020).  The Mayor of the District of Columbia has ordered the closure of all \nnonessential business and has issued a stay-at-home order, and both Congress and the D.C. \nCouncil have passed various forms of emergency legislation.  See, e.g., Mayor’s Order 2020-054 \n(Mar. 30, 2020). \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 59   Filed 04/25/20   Page 3 of 18\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) has issued guidance to help \nlong-term care facilities (“LCTFs”) mitigate the spread of the virus and to “keep patients and \nresidents safe[.]”  CDC, Coronavirus Disease 2019 Nursing Homes & Long-Term Care Facilities \n(“CDC, LTCF Guidance”), at 1 (Apr. 2, 2020), available at https://tinyurl.com/yaaj8kk6 (last \naccessed Apr. 23, 2020); see Dkt. 55-1 (CDC, Preparing for COVID-19: Long-term Care \nFacilities, Nursing Homes, Apr. 15, 2020); CDC, Key Strategies to Prepare for COVID-19 in \nLong-term Care Facilities (LTCFs) (“CDC, LTCFs Key Strategies”) (Apr. 15, 2020), available at \nhttps://tinyurl.com/y95jrlcx (last accessed Apr. 23, 2020).  Although the LTCF guidance is \ntargeted at nursing homes and similar facilities, all agree that it provides relevant guidance for \nSaint Elizabeths.  See Dkt. 42-2 at 3 (Gontang Decl. ¶ 5) (“Saint Elizabeths is unique among \nhealthcare facilities in that it is foremost a psychiatric treatment facility but also houses pre- and \npost-trial patients and shares similarities with long-term care nursing facilities.”); Dkt. 42 at 10–\n11 (citing to LTCF guidance and recommendations as the standards the Hospital has conformed \nits practices and policies to).  The CDC has also issued recommendations for health care settings \nmore generally, which the long-term care facility resources incorporate by reference.  See, e.g., \nDkt. 54-1 (CDC, Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with \nSuspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings); Dkt. \n54-2 (CDC, Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions and Disposition of Patients with \nCOVID-19 in Healthcare Settings (Interim Guidance)).  Finally, the CDC has issued guidance \nregarding managing the pandemic at correctional and detention facilities.  See Dkt. 55-2 (CDC, \nInterim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 ((COVID-19) in Correctional \nand Detention Facilities).  Each party has, at times, pointed to portions of that guidance in \nsupport of it positions. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 59   Filed 04/25/20   Page 4 of 18\nAs relevant here, the CDC recommends that long-term care facilities actively screen all \nresidents and anyone entering the building for fever and symptoms.  CDC, LCTF Key Strategies.  \nTo prevent the spread of the virus, “group activities and communal dining” should be canceled, \nsocial distancing should be enforced among residents, and residents should “wear a cloth face \ncovering . . . whenever they leave their room or are around others.”  Id.  If a resident is \nsymptomatic, the facility should isolate him and implement appropriate “transmission-based \nprecautions.” Id.  Those precautions include isolating patients who are suspected of having or \nwho have tested positive for COVID-19 “in private rooms with the door closed and with private \nbathrooms (as possible).”  Dkt. 54-1 at 2.  If the patient is COVID-19 positive, she should remain \nin isolation until either (1) fever has subsided “without the use of fever-reducing medications,” \nthe patient experiences “[i]mprovement in respiratory symptoms,” and the patient has received \n“at least two consecutive” negative tests at least “24 hours apart,” or (2) “[a]t least 3 days (72 \nhours) have passed since recovery” (meaning “resolution of fever without the use of fever-\nreducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms ”) and “[a]t least 7 days have \npassed since first symptoms appeared.”  Dkt. 54-2 at 3 (emphasis in original).  A patient who has \nnot tested positive but who is “suspected of having COVID-19” may instead be released “upon \nhaving negative results from” one test, but, if “a higher level of clinical suspicion . . . exists,” the \nfacility must “consider maintaining [medical isolation]” and performing “a second test.”  Id. at 4. \nB.         Procedural History \nPlaintiffs, Enzo Costa, Vinitia Smith, and William Dunbar, are three patients who are \nindefinitely and involuntarily civilly committed to the District’s care and housed at Saint \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 59   Filed 04/25/20   Page 5 of 18\nElizabeths.  Dkt. 36-1 at 6–7 (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 19–22).1  Plaintiffs originally brought this putative \nclass action in October 2019, asserting due process and Americans with Disability Act (“ADA”), \n42 U.S.C. §12131 et seq., claims relating to a September 2019 water outage at Saint Elizabeths \nthat interrupted their recommended therapy and subjected them to allegedly unhealthy \nconditions.  Dkt. 1.  In light of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, Plaintiffs filed an emergency \nmotion seeking leave to amend their complaint, and, after conducting a hearing and providing \nDefendants with the opportunity to file an opposition brief, the Court granted that motion.  See \nDkt. 48; Dkt. 36; Dkt. 40; Minute Entry (Apr. 17, 2020). \nAccording to the amended complaint, Saint Elizabeths has failed to protect the health and \nsafety of its patients from the virus by departing from applicable CDC guidelines in several key \nways.  Most pressingly, Plaintiffs alleged that the Hospital was not testing all symptomatic \npatients; not segregating patients who have been exposed or potentially exposed to the virus from \nother residents; see Dkt. 50 at 21–25 (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 78–108); and “cohorting” patients who \nhave tested positive or are suspected of having the virus in groups rather than medically isolating \nthem in private rooms, see Apr. 22, 2020 Hrg. Tr. (Rough at 4–5).  As of April 23, 2020, 111 \nindividuals associated with the Hospital (68 staff and 43 patients) have tested positive for the \nvirus, and, tragically, seven patients and two staff members have died.  Dkt. 53; Dkt. 58; Apr. 22, \n2020 Hrg. Tr. (Rough at 3) (indicating that, as of this morning, one of the named plaintiffs has \ntested positive).  Thus, the Hospital’s mortality rate is magnitudes higher than the mortality rate \nfor the District as a whole.  See Dkt. 53 at 3; Apr. 22, 2020 Hrg. Tr. (Rough at 45).   \n                                                 \n1   The Court dismissed the claims of a fourth named plaintiff, Stefon Kirkpatrick, pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(ii).  See Dkt. 43; Minute Order (Apr. 22, 2020).  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 59   Filed 04/25/20   Page 6 of 18\nPlaintiffs also challenge the adequacy of Defendants’ response to the virus on several \nother scores, including that the Hospital is not adequately enforcing social distancing, see Dkt. \n46 at 9–10; not taking steps to ensure that the patients receive the mental health care they require \n(such as by providing remote substitutes for group and individual therapy); not updating mental \nhealth treatment plans to account for pandemic-related stress, see Dkt. 50 at 25–26 (Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 109–16); not maintaining adequate staffing levels; id. at 26–27 (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 117–22); \ncontinuing to admit new patients; failing adequately to screen and to quarantine newly admitted \npatients; and discriminating against Plaintiffs and the putative class members in violation of the \nADA by failing to release eligible patients into community-based programming, see id. at 46 \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 228).  Overall, Plaintiffs allege that the Hospital’s inadequate response to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, like Defendants’ response to the September 2019 water outage, has fallen \nshort of its obligation to ensure that Plaintiffs and other patients at the hospital are held in \nhumane conditions and continue to receive appropriate mental health treatment.  See id. at 27–28 \n(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 123–29); Dkt. 1. \nOn April 22, 2020, the Court held a telephonic hearing on the pending motion for a \ntemporary injunction.  Given the ongoing and escalating emergency at the Hospital, the Court \nasked counsel for Plaintiffs to identify the actions that, in their view, need to be redressed “on the \nmost pressing basis.”  Apr. 22, 2020 Hrg. Tr. (Rough at 63).  Counsel indicated that the top \npriority was that the Hospital follow CDC guidance on “properly quarantining and isolating” \npatients, meaning that the Hospital should “stop cohorting suspected people” and that it should, \ninstead, place patients who have tested positive, who are suspected of having the virus, or who \nhave been exposed to the virus in private rooms for 14 days (or earlier under the appropriate \nguidelines), rather than placing them in group settings.  Id. (Rough at 43–47).  Counsel also \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 59   Filed 04/25/20   Page 7 of 18\nstressed the importance of following CDC guidelines recommending that persons in quarantine \nor isolation make appropriate use of face masks.  Id. (Rough at 49).  Finally, counsel emphasized \nthat the Hospital should test all symptomatic patients.  See id. (Rough at 44).   \nRecognizing both the need for expedition and the expertise of the Hospital’s medical and \npsychiatric staff and the parties’ experts, the Court directed that the parties meet and confer \nwithin 24 hours regarding these top priority issues and file a joint status report within hours of \ntheir meeting, notifying the Court whether the parties agree or disagree on these issues and \nexplaining the basis for any disagreement.  Id. (Rough at 65).  The Court further directed that the \nparties include their medical and psychiatric experts in those discussions.  As the Court \nunderstood the parties’ respective positions, all agreed that the Hospital should follow CDC \nguidelines.  Thus, the goal of the conferral process was to determine whether there are any \npressing areas where the Hospital is not doing so and to identify any disagreements between the \nparties regarding what the guidelines require or what the Hospital is doing.  \nOn April 23, 2020, the parties file the required joint status report.  Dkt. 53.  As reflected \nin that report, the parties now agree that individuals who have tested positive or who are \nsuspected of having COVID-19 “should be housed in their own rooms with bathrooms, and their \nmovements outside their rooms should be kept to a minimum.”  Id. at 2.  The parties were also \nable to resolve a confusion over their different uses of the term “cohorting.”  Dkt. 53 at 7.  But \nseveral points of disagreement remain.  Most notably, the parties disagree about (1) whether a \npatient who has been exposed to someone who has tested positive for the virus, but who is not \nsymptomatic, should be medically isolated, and (2) whether medically isolated patients should be \nreleased to the general population after only one negative test.  Id. at 4.  Plaintiffs also have \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 59   Filed 04/25/20   Page 8 of 18\nlingering concerns about the adequacy of the Hospital’s policies regarding social distancing, \nmask use, and the provision of psychiatric care during the crisis.  Id.  \nThe next day, the Court held another telephonic hearing to address the urgent issues as to \nwhich the parties still disagreed.  Counsel for the plaintiffs identified two.  The first is \nDefendants’ “practice[] of keeping together in the same units patients who have and have not \nbeen exposed” to the virus, and the second is the Hospital’s practice of releasing positive or \nsuspected patients back into the general population after a single negative test.  See Apr. 24, \n2020 Hrg. Tr. (Rough at 2).  As to the first issue, counsel for the Plaintiffs stressed that the \nmatter is not merely abstract and that one of the named plaintiffs had been placed in a \n“congregate setting” with other patients that “may have been exposed” and that (as the parties \nlearned early this morning) he has now tested positive for the virus.  Id. (Rough at 2–3).  When \nthe Court asked counsel for the Defendants whether the Hospital agreed that sound “professional \njudgment means that [a person exposed to the virus] ought to be closely monitored and \n. . . should be isolated to the extent practicable,” he responded that “the Hospital would agree \nwith that [proposition], [and] . . . that’s exactly what they’re doing.”  Id. (Rough at 35–36) \n(emphasis added).   \nAs to the second issue, counsel for the Plaintiffs conceded that there is no “guidance \nsaying two clean tests [are needed] for people who are exposed” and that the “heart of the \ndispute” was whether persons who are “suspected” of having the virus—that is, those who are \nsymptomatic—should be released from isolation after a single negative test.  Id. (Rough at 36–\n37).  In Plaintiffs’ view, CDC guidance recommends that those suspected of having virus (like \nthose with positive test results) remain in isolation until they receive two negative tests, at least \n24 hours apart.  Id. (Rough at 37–38).  Defendants disagree and take the position that the \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 59   Filed 04/25/20   Page 9 of 18\napplicable CDC guidance requires only one negative test result before “the quarantined \nindividual should be released from quarantine restrictions.”  Id. (Rough at 41).  Counsel for \nDefendants reported, however, that the Hospital has acquired on-site testing capacity that \n“should make [the double-test] approach” feasible to implement and that his understanding is \nthat there are ample supplies for testing.  Id. (Rough at 42–43).  That equipment, which Counsel \nreported would be imminently placed in use, will provide results within approximately fifteen \nminutes.  See Apr. 22, 2020 Hrg. Tr. (Rough at 17). \nII.  LEGAL STANDARDS \nA TRO is “an extraordinary form of relief.”  Banks v. Booth, No. 20-cv-849, 2020 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 68287, at *7 (D.D.C. Apr. 19, 2020).  A TRO is analyzed using the same “factors \napplicable to preliminary injunctive relief,” and “may only be awarded upon a clear showing that \nthe plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Id. (quoting Sibley v. Obama, 810 F. Supp. 2d 309, 310 \n(D.D.C. 2011)).  To obtain a TRO, a movant “must establish [1] that he is likely to succeed on \nthe merits, [2] that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, [3] \nthat the balance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] that an injunction is in the public interest.”  \nAamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1038 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  When seeking such relief, “the movant \nhas the burden to show that all four factors, taken together, weigh in favor of the injunction.” \nAbdullah v. Obama, 753 F.3d 193, 197 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (quoting Davis v. Pension Benefit Guar. \nCorp., 571 F.3d 1288, 1292 (D.C. Cir. 2009)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Before the \nSupreme Court’s decision in Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), courts in this circuit applied a \n“sliding-scale” approach under which “a strong showing on one factor could make up for a \nweaker showing on another.”  Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  Since \nWinter, the D.C. Circuit has hinted on several occasions that “a likelihood of success is an \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 59   Filed 04/25/20   Page 10 of 18\nindependent, free-standing requirement,” id.  at 393 (quotation omitted), but it “has not yet \nneeded to decide th[e] issue,” League of Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 7 (D.C. \nCir. 2016).  “In light of this ambiguity, the Court shall consider each of the [four] factors and \nshall only evaluate the proper weight to accord the likelihood of success if the Court finds that its \nrelative weight would affect the outcome.”  Banks, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68287, at *7. \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nA.         Likelihood of Success On The Merits \nThe Court first considers whether Plaintiffs have established a likelihood of success on \nthe merits.  For present purposes, the relevant question is whether Defendants’ response to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic violates Plaintiffs’ rights under the due process clause of the Fifth \nAmendment.  \nTo start, the Court concludes that the operative standard is the one set forth in Youngberg \nv. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982).  In Youngberg, “the Supreme Court held that the State [or, in this \ncase, the District of Columbia] has an affirmative duty to ensure the safety and general well-\nbeing of an involuntarily committed mental patient.”  Harvey v. D.C., 798 F.3d 1042, 1050 (D.C. \nCir. 2015).  Civilly committed persons have a constitutional right, protected by the due process \nclauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, in the government meeting that obligation.  \nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 319.  To determine if that right has been violated, a court must balance \nthe plaintiff’s interests “against any relevant state interests, including fiscal constraints and \nadministrative burdens.”  LaShawn A. v. Dixon, 762 F. Supp. 959, 994 (D.D.C. 1991), aff’d and \nremanded sub nom. LaShawn A. by Moore v. Kelly, 990 F.2d 1319 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (citing \nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 321).  To assess whether the government has met its obligation, the \nCourt must consider “whether [it has] exercised professional judgment in choosing what action \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 59   Filed 04/25/20   Page 11 of 18\nto undertake.”  Id.  “[L]iability may be imposed only when the decision by the professional is \nsuch a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards as to \ndemonstrate that the person responsible actually did not base the decision on such a judgment.”  \nId. (quoting Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 323).   \nDefendants concede, and Plaintiffs agree, that courts have generally applied Youngberg’s \n“professional judgment” standard to cases concerning civilly committed psychiatric patients.  See \nDkt. 42 at 31 (citing Jordan v. District of Columbia, 161 F. Supp. 3d 45, 57 (D.D.C. 2016), aff’d, \n686 F. App’x 3 (D.C. Cir. 2017)).  Plaintiffs also rely on the line of cases analyzing the \nsubstantive due process rights of pre-trial detainees, arguing that they can establish a \nconstitutional violation if “the Defendants knew or should have known that the [Hospital] \nconditions posed an excessive risk to [Plaintiffs’] health.”  Dkt. 46 at 12 (quoting Banks v. Booth, \nNo. 1:20-cv-849-CKK, ECF No. 51 (Apr. 20, 2020)).  To the extent Plaintiffs argue that the pre-\ntrial detainee standard governs because the proposed class includes pre-trial detainees, that \ncontention is premature.  Although Plaintiffs have filed a motion to certify a class consisting of \nall persons confined at the Hospital, including pre- and post-trial detainees, the Court need not \nrule on that motion at this point in the litigation.  The alleged violations impact or threaten to \nimpact each of the named plaintiffs and the requested relief, which is Hospital-wide, is necessary \nto redress their risk of serious injury.  If Plaintiffs, instead, mean that the standard also applies to \ncivilly committed individuals, they have cited no authority for that proposition and, under the \npressing time constraints of this motion, the Court has found none.  In any event, as a practical \nmatter and on the fact of this case, there is little difference between the two standards.  See \nPorter v. Illinois, 36 F.3d 684, 688 (7th Cir. 1994), abrogated on other grounds, Lapides v. Bd. \nof Regents of Univ. Sys. of Georgia, 535 U.S. 613, (2002) (“[P]rofessional judgment, like \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 59   Filed 04/25/20   Page 12 of 18\nrecklessness and gross negligence, generally falls somewhere between simple negligence and \nintentional misconduct.”). \nApplying the Youngberg test, Defendants argue that “Plaintiffs cannot point to any \ndecisions that were not based on professional judgment” because Saint Elizabeths has exercised \nappropriate judgment in deciding how to respond to the pandemic.  Dkt. 42 at 37.  Plaintiffs \nrespond that the Hospital has failed properly to implement relevant CDC guidance and that the \nHospital’s departures violate their constitutional rights.  To be sure, Plaintiffs acknowledge that \nthe Hospital is now following many CDC recommendations, but they assert that this new-found \nconformity happened only after they filed the motion for a TRO.  Dkt. 53 at 3.  And, more \nimportantly, they contend that the Hospital is still failing to follow CDC guidance in at least two \ncritical respects:  First, the Hospital is releasing persons suspected of having the virus from \nmedical isolation after only one negative test, rather than the recommended two tests.  See Apr. \n24, 2020 Hrg. Tr. (Rough at 45) (“The rub of what we’re concerned about is the idea that people \nwho are suspected could be cleared with one test.”).  Second, the Hospital is not isolating \nindividuals who have been exposed to the virus, thus risking that those individuals infect other \nnon-exposed patients or that they come into contact with other exposed individuals who are now \ncarrying the virus.  Dkt. 53 at 4. \nAs an initial matter, the Court observes that, although decisions made by professionals \nare “presumptively valid” under Youngberg, it is unclear whether that presumption applies here.  \nDefendants have not identified the person or persons who have decided to implement these \npolicies, and so the Court cannot say with any certainty that they satisfy the definition of \n“professional” articulated in Youngberg.  To be sure, there is evidence in the record that the \nHospital’s COVID-19 response is being overseen by medical professionals, including Dr. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 59   Filed 04/25/20   Page 13 of 18\nRichard Gontang, the Chief Clinical Officer, see Dkt. 42-2, Martha Pontes, the Chief Nurse, see \n42-4, and Yi-Ling Elaine Tu, the Infection Control Coordinator, 42-5.  But, even assuming, that \nthe decisions are entitled to the presumption of validity, Plaintiffs have offered compelling \nevidence (on the extremely expedited schedule governing their motion for a TRO) that the \nchallenged practices substantially depart from accepted professional standards.  \nAccording to Defendants, the Hospital has already addressed the first pressing issue that \nPlaintiffs raise—the alleged failure to isolate patients exposed to the virus—by treating all units \nas “quarantined.”  See Dkt. 53-2 at 2 (“Currently, all units other than isolation units and PUI \nunits are under quarantine”); Apr. 24, 2020 Hrg. Tr. (Rough at 13–14).  The problem with that \nassertion is that Defendants’ implementation of the quarantine does not satisfy CDC standards.  \nThe CDC recommends that long-term care facilities “[e]nforce social distancing among \nresidents,” “[e]nsure all residents wear a cloth face covering . . . whenever they leave their room \nor are around others,” and, if the virus “is identified in the facility, restrict all residents to their \nrooms[.]”  CDC, LCTFs Key Strategies.  Plaintiffs have offered ample evidence that the Hospital \nhas taken a less demanding approach to enforcing social distancing and mask use, that common \nspaces are open, and that patients are not remaining in their rooms to the extent practicable.  See, \ne.g., Dkt. 39-6 at 1 (Costa Decl. ¶¶ 4–5); Dkt. 39-9 at 1–2 (Guzman Decl. ¶ 3); Dkt. 39-10 at 1 \n(Rose Decl. ¶ 5).  As Plaintiffs’ counsel put it, the Hospital is “not insisting that [patients] stay in \ntheir rooms to the extent practicable, they’re not shutting down common areas or common \nfacilities for this population.  Mask use is still intermittent.  Social distancing enforcement is still \nintermittent.”  Apr. 24, 2020 Hrg. Tr. (Rough at 9).  Much of Defendants’ own evidence is \nconsistent with Plaintiffs’ narrative.  Staff for the Hospital attest, for example, that, although \nthere is enough space “for each patient to practice social distancing if he or she chooses to do \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 59   Filed 04/25/20   Page 14 of 18\nso,” it “is difficult to enforce without impinging on patient autonomy.”  Dkt. 42-2 at 5 (Pontes \nDecl. ¶ 10).  Defendants also attest that, although “[a]ll patients have access to face masks,” \n“[s]ome . . . choose to wear masks, others do not.”  Id. at 6 (Pontes Decl. ¶ 6).  And they assert \nthat, although patients “in quarantine units are encourage to stay in their rooms as much as \npossible,” they are “not prohibited from using common areas.”  Dkt. 53-2 at 2. \nThe Court is cognizant that there may be sound medical reasons why some of these \nmeasures should not be stringently enforced in the context of a psychiatric hospital and that the \n(fast evolving) record is not developed on this point.  Counsel for the Defendants has noted on \nmultiple occasions that the Hospital must balance the unique mental health needs of the patients \nconfined at the Hospital, and the Court understands that need.  Nor is it the Court’s place to \nmicromanage the Hospital’s hour-by-hour and patient-by-patient medical and psychiatric \ndecisions.  But Defendants have offered no explanation why patients who have been exposed to \nthe virus are not more closely monitored to ensure that they are isolated to the extent consistent \nwith patient health and well-being.  Defendants acknowledge that persons who have been \nexposed should be closely monitored and placed in “a separate observation area,” Dkt. 53-3 at 2, \nand that accepted professional judgment is that such persons should be isolated to the extent \npracticable.  Apr. 24, 2020 Hrg. Tr. (Rough at 35–36).  And yet the evidence currently before the \nCourt indicates the Hospital is not robustly implementing those measures.  As Plaintiffs’ counsel \nindicated, this is not a mere abstract disagreement; the risks to Plaintiffs are immediate and \nmanifest.  If exposed to a contagious patient, Plaintiffs may—and in one case, already has—\ncontract the virus. \nThe Hospital’s policy of “immediately” returning patients suspected of having the virus \nto the general population after a single negative test result is also contrary to accepted \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 59   Filed 04/25/20   Page 15 of 18\nprofessional standards.  See Dkt. 42-3 at 29; Dkt. 53 at 4; id. at 11 (“If the test results are \nnegative, the patient is returned to the general housing unit.”).  As a threshold matter, the parties \ndisagree about the relevant CDC guidance.  Defendants say that the guidance applicable to \nhealthcare settings should govern, Dkt. 54-2, while Plaintiffs posit that CDC guidance directed at \ndetention facilities sets forth the operative standard, Dkt. 55-2.  In Plaintiffs’ view, the latter is \nmore apt because the Hospital is a congregate setting where patients are involuntarily detained; \nby contrast, in a typical hospital setting, patients may voluntarily depart and self-quarantine at \nhome.  See Apr. 24, 2020 Hrg. Tr. (Rough at 7).  \n The Court need not decide this issue, however.  Even assuming that the guidance \nDefendants rely upon is the operative one, they are not following it.  Although that guidance \nstates that a patient suspected of having the virus can be released “upon having negative results \nfrom at least one test,” it also says that, if there is a “higher level of clinical suspicion,” it is \nrecommended that the patient remain in isolation and that a “second test” be performed.  Dkt. 54-\n2.  That guidance is consistent, moreover, with the expert testimony offered by the Plaintiffs. \nPlaintiffs offer declarations from Dr. Marc Stern, a “board-certified internist specializing” and \nformer Assistant Secretary of Health Care for the Washington State Department of Corrections. \nDkt. 39-3 at 1 (Stern Decl. ¶ 1).  Dr. Stern attests that symptomatic patients should not be \nreleased from isolation “based solely on one [negative] test” because “[t]here is a high rate of \nfalse negatives and decisions should be made based on a full clinical evaluation of the patient.”  \nDkt. 46-2 at 2 (Stern. Suppl. Decl. ¶ 7).  Defendants have offered no evidence that they are \nevaluating patients who have received a negative test for “clinical suspicion” prior to release, and \nDefendants own evidence shows that they are releasing patients “immediately” to the general \nhousing units after a single negative test.  Dkt. 42-3 at 29.  Nor have Defendants explained why \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 59   Filed 04/25/20   Page 16 of 18\nall symptomatic patients at the Hospital do not meet the higher-level-of-clinical-suspicion \nbenchmark, given the large percentage of infected patients and staff at Saint Elizabeths.  Indeed, \nout of a total patient population of between 200 and 275, at least 42 patients have tested positive \nto date, along with at least 68 staff members.  Even under the guidance relied upon by \nDefendants, the Hospital’s protocol for returning symptomatic patients to the general population \nis not consistent with CDC standards.   \nThe Court acknowledges that additional development of the record might show that \nDefendants are taking sufficient precautions not evident on the current record.  The Hospital’s \nresponse, moreover, is evolving as the crisis continues to evolve, and, indeed, the Hospital has \nindicated that it is increasing its testing capacity and has expressed an intention to abide by the \nCDC guidelines.  On the current record, however, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have established \na likelihood of success on the merits with respect to the two priority issues that it raises for \npurposes of this emergency motion. \nB.         Irreparable Harm \nPlaintiffs contend that the deprivation of constitutional rights, even for minimal period of \ntime, “unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”  Dkt. 39-1 at 34 (quoting Mills v. District \nof Columbia, 571 F.3d 1304, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2009).  And, Plaintiffs further point to the \nimminent risk to their health, which also constitutes an irreparable injury.  Defendants do not \ndispute either point and, instead, argue that Plaintiffs will not suffer irreparable injury because \n“Saint Elizabeths is already taking the overwhelming majority of the measures [P]laintiffs \nrequest.”  Dkt. 42 at 25.  But Plaintiffs have continued to pursue the issues addressed in this \nopinion precisely because Saint Elizabeths has declined to modify its protocols even after \nmeeting and conferring with Defendants to discuss their concerns.  Given the gravity of \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 59   Filed 04/25/20   Page 17 of 18\nPlaintiffs’ imminent risk of injury, and the pressing need to act to prevent that risk, the Court \nfinds that Plaintiffs have satisfied the irreparable harm requirement for issuance of a temporary \nrestraining order.  See AlJoudi v. Bush, 406 F. Supp. 2d 13, 20 (D.D.C. 2005) (“Facing requests \nfor preliminary injunctive relief, courts often find a showing of irreparable harm where the \nmovant’s health is in imminent danger.”) \nC.         Balance of Hardships and Public Interest \n  The Court moves to the final factors to be considered in granting a temporary restraining \norder—the balance of the equities and the public interest.  In this case, where the government is a \nparty to the suit, the harm to defendants and the public interest merge and “are one and the same, \nbecause the government’s interest is the public interest.”  Pursuing America’s Greatness v. FEC, \n831 F.3d 500, 511 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (emphasis in original).  The Court finds that the public \ninterest weighs in favor of granting temporary injunctive relief. \nAs a starting point, “[i]t is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a \nparty’s constitutional rights.”  Simms v. District of Columbia, 872 F. Supp. 2d 90, 105 (D.D.C. \n2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Beyond protecting Plaintiffs’ rights, ordering \nDefendants to take precautions to lower the risk of infections for Plaintiffs also benefits the \npublic health.  As the record in this case demonstrates, continued spread of the virus at Saint \nElizabeths threatens the health and lives of patients and staff.   \nOf course, the Court recognizes that there is also a “public interest in permitting the \ngovernment discretion to carry out its authorized functions,” Banks, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n68287, at *48, and that interest is acute where medical and psychiatric staff must make prompt, \nindividualized, and informed decisions about the health and well-being of their patients.  But \nhere, the burden on that interest is minimal.  Defendants have already expressed a desire to \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 59   Filed 04/25/20   Page 18 of 18\nfollow the CDC guidelines, and the Court’s order will simply require them to make good on that \naspiration.  Nor is this a case where the ordered relief will require the Defendants to expend \nresources acquiring means to comply with the order.  Just a few days ago, Defendants received a \n“rapid test machine” that will “facilitate more testing.”  Dkt. 53-2 at 2.  Moreover, by mitigating \nthe spread of infection, “Defendants actually lessen the healthcare burden that they will be facing \nin the weeks and months to come.”  Banks, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68287, at *48.  Finally, the \nCourt will tailor its order to ensure that it does not interfere with the ability of medical and \npsychiatric professionals to make decisions on-the-spot about the health and well-being of their \npatients.  The Court, accordingly, finds that the balance of the equities and the public interest \nweigh in favor of granting injunctive relief. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons explained above, the Court will grant in part and defer in part Plaintiffs’ \nmotion for a temporary restraining order.  \nA separate order will issue. \n                                      /s/ Randolph D.

Fin. Stability Oversight Council, 865 \nF.3d 661, 665 (D.C. Cir. 2017). Here, Defendants seek leave to \nfile under seal Saint Elizabeths Hospital's Emergency \nPreparedness Plan (\"EPP\"). The EPP contains non -public details \nabout operations at Saint Elizabeths Hospital and how the District \n\nplans to maintain operations during various emergency situations, \nincluding information about which kinds of patients are kept \nwhere, logistics for moving people in emergency situations, and \nlocations of emergency supplies. The Court finds that the public \ninterest in the disclosure of this document is low because little, if \nany of the EPP's contents bear on the matters being litigated in the \ncase--the Defendants' response to COVID-19. Instead, the EPP's \ncontents pertain to more general emergency preparedness \nmeasures. The reason for sealing, in contrast, is compelling. The \nEPP contains sensitive operational and security details that could \nbe compromised by public disclosure. Accordingly, Defendants' \nmotion for leave to file under seal, Dkt. 44, is hereby GRANTED. \nThe EPP, Dkt. 44-1 (attached exhibits to Dkt. 44), shall be filed \nunder SEAL.

CHASTANG, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA (Bluming, Micah) \n(Entered: 10/09/2020) \n10/13/2020     MINUTE ORDER: Pending before the Court is Plaintiffs' motion \nto file a surreply brief or, in the alternative, to strike certain \narguments in Defendants' reply brief. Dkt. 116 . Defendants \nopposed the motion, Dkt. 119 , and Plaintiffs replied, Dkt. 120 . In \nthe parties' briefing, an entirely different dispute emerged about \nwhether Defendants had complied with the Court's prior order that \nthey provide Plaintiffs with jurisdictional discovery. At a hearing \non January 22, 2020, the Court granted in part Plaintiffs' motion \nfor jurisdictional discovery. See Minute Entry (Jan. 22, 2020). The \nCourt permitted jurisdictional discovery \"as to items 1, 2, 4, 5, and \n6 of Exhibit 1,\" and the Court also permitted, \"[a]s to item 8 of \nExhibit 1,\" Plaintiffs to \"serve a request for admission as outlined \nby the Court on the record.\" Id. Defendants argue that they \ncomplied with that order by denying a request for admission from \nPlaintiffs. Dkt. 119 at 34; Dkt. 119 -2 at 5. Plaintiffs contend that \nDefendants, by denying the request for admission, have complied \n\nwith only one of six parts of the Court's order of jurisdictional \ndiscovery and that Plaintiffs \"are still lacking critical information\" \nneeded to respond to Defendants' jurisdictional arguments. \nDkt. 120 at 2. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that Defendants \nhave not yet fully complied with the Court's order granting \njurisdictional discovery. The Court will therefore ORDER that \nDefendants serve on Plaintiffs the full jurisdictional discovery \noutlined in the Court's prior order on or before November 16, \n2020. It is hereby further ORDERED that the parties shall file a \njoint status report on the progress of jurisdictional discovery on or \nbefore November 16, 2020. The Court will reserve judgment on \nthe motion to file a surreply until after the completion of \njurisdictional discovery. Signed by Judge Randolph D. Moss on \n10/13/2020.

(Banner, Kaitlin) (Entered: \n12/01/2020) \n12/02/2020     MINUTE ORDER: Still pending before the Court is Plaintiffs' \nmotion for leave to file a sur-reply or, in the alternative, to strike \narguments not previously raised. Dkt. 116 . Defendants opposed \nthe motion, Dkt. 119 , and Plaintiffs replied, Dkt. 120 . In those \nbriefs, a separate-yet-related dispute emerged over whether \n\nDefendants had fully complied with the Court's prior order \ndirecting them to produce jurisdictional discovery. The Court thus \nordered Defendants to complete jurisdictional discovery and \nreserved judgment on the motion to file a sur-reply until after the \ncompletion of jurisdictional discovery. The parties have now filed \na joint status report, Dkt. 127 , indicating that jurisdictional \ndiscovery is complete and renewing their respective positions on \nthe necessity of the sur-reply. Upon consideration of the parties' \nsubmissions, it is hereby ORDERED that Plaintiffs' motion for \nleave to file a sur-reply or, in the alternative, to strike arguments \nnot previously raised, is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. \nPlaintiffs may file a sur-reply of no more than seven pages on or \nbefore December 11, 2020. In their brief, Plaintiffs may address \nonly (1) the applicability in this case of the voluntary cessation \nexemption to the mootness doctrine, in light of Defendants' \ncontention that they ceased the challenged behavior independent of \nthis litigation, and (2) the timeliness of Plaintiffs' motion for class \ncertification. The Court will not, however, strike Defendants' \narguments. Signed by Judge Randolph D. Moss on 12/2/2020. \n(lcrdm2) (Entered: 12/02/2020) \n12/04/2020  128   NOTICE OF COMPLIANCE by BARBARA J.

Civil Action No. 19-3185 (RDM) \n \nBARBARA J. BAZRON, et al., \n \n  Defendants. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \nThis matter is before the Court on the Plaintiffs’ emergency motion for leave to file an \namended complaint.  Dkt. 36.  Defendants oppose this motion.  For the reasons explained below, \nthe Court will grant Plaintiffs’ motion.  \nI.  BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs, Enzo Costa, Vinitia Smith, and William Dunbar, are three patients who are \nindefinitely and involuntarily civilly committed to the District’s care and housed at Saint \nElizabeths Hospital.  Dkt. 36-1 at 6–7 (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 19–22).  Plaintiffs originally brought this \nputative class action in October 2019, asserting due process and Americans with Disability Act \n(“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §12131 et seq., claims relating to a September 2019 water outage at Saint \nElizabeths that interrupted plaintiffs’ recommended therapy and subjected them to allegedly \nunhealthy conditions for a period of 28 days.  Dkt. 1.  After Defendants moved to dismiss the \ncomplaint on mootness and standing grounds, Dkt. 21, the Court granted Plaintiffs the \nopportunity to conduct jurisdictional discovery and held that motion in abeyance until the \ncompletion of that discovery, see Minute Entry (Jan. 22, 2020); Minute Order (Jan. 10, 2020).  \nJurisdictional discovery is not yet complete.  See Dkt. 36 at 2. \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 48   Filed 04/22/20   Page 2 of 5\nOn April 16, 2020, Plaintiffs filed an emergency motion seeking leave to amend their \ncomplaint to add allegations regarding the ongoing COVID-19 crisis at Saint Elizabeths.  See id. \nat 3–4 (Proposed Am. Compl. ¶¶ 3–7); Dkt. 36 at 1.  The proposed amended complaint alleges \nthat, like Defendants’ response to the water outage, they have fallen short of their obligation to \nensure that Plaintiffs and other patients at the hospital continue to receive mental health \ntreatment and are held in humane conditions.  Dkt. 36-1.  Defendants oppose the motion.  Dkt. \n40. \nII.  ANALYSIS \nAlthough Plaintiffs seek leave to amend their complaint under Rule 15(a)(2), Dkt. 36, the \nCourt will construe the pleading as a motion to file a supplemental complaint pursuant to Rule \n15(d), see Hall v. C.I.A., 437 F.3d 94, 100 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (new allegations relating to matters \nthat occurred prior to the filing of the original pleading constitute amendments, whereas new \nallegations relating to matters that occurred after filing constitute supplements).  This difference \nis immaterial, however, because “[m]otions to amend under Rule 15(a) and motions to \nsupplement under Rule 15(d) are,” in the main, “subject to the same standard.”  Wildearth \nGuardians v. Kempthorne, 592 F. Supp. 2d 18, 23 (D.D.C. 2008); cf. Clean Water Action v. \nPruitt, 315 F. Supp. 3d 72, 79 (D.D.C. 2018) (observing that, although the Rule 15(d) and Rule \n15(a)(2) standards overlap, they are not identical, but not proceeding to analyze “the precise \ndifferences between the two standards” because the case fell within the overlap).   \nUnder Rule 15(d), a “court may, on just terms, permit a party to serve a supplemental \npleading setting out any transaction, occurrence, or event that happened after the date of the \npleading to be supplemented.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d).  The decision to grant a motion for leave to \nfile a supplemental pleading is “within the discretion of the district court,” Xingru Lin v. District \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 48   Filed 04/22/20   Page 3 of 5\nof Columbia, 319 F.R.D. 1, 1 (D.D.C. 2016), and should be “freely granted when doing so will \npromote the economic and speedy disposition of the entire controversy between the parties, will \nnot cause undue delay or trial inconvenience, and will not prejudice the rights of any of the other \nparties to the action,” Hall, 437 F.3d at 101.  “In the last analysis, a district court faced with a \nRule 15(d) motion must weigh the totality of the circumstances, just as it would under Rule \n15(a).”  States ex rel. Gadbois v. PharMerica Corp., 809 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2015).   \nHere, Plaintiffs seek to add allegations and claims arising from Defendants’ response to \nthe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  Because this case is still at an early stage, Plaintiffs’ new \nclaims raise pressing issues relating to health and safety, and Plaintiffs’ original claims and those \nthat they seek to add all challenge the Hospital’s failure to protect the well-being of its patients in \nresponse to public health crises, the Court concludes that “the totality of the circumstances” tip \ndecidedly in favor of permitting supplementation of the complaint. \nMost importantly, because the proposed supplemental pleading pertains to exigent and \npotentially life-threatening circumstances, Plaintiffs—and not Defendants—would be prejudiced, \nin a very real way, if the Court were to reject their motion.  Were the Court to deny the motion, \nPlaintiffs would be required to file a new complaint and would then have to wait as the new case \nis assigned, the new judge becomes familiar with the case, and a new briefing schedule is set.  In \nordinary circumstances, that lost time might be insignificant; but here, where time is of the \nessence, it imposes a significant cost.  In general, courts must construe, administer, and employ \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure “to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination \nof every action and proceeding.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  Court must also, in general, provide litigants \nwith “every opportunity to join in one lawsuit all grievances against another party regardless of \nwhen they arose.”  Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 1506 (3d ed.).  Here, the \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 48   Filed 04/22/20   Page 4 of 5\ninterest in efficiency goes beyond conserving judicial resources and promoting fairness; it is \nnecessary to protect the very safety and health interests the suit seeks to vindicate. \nNone of Defendants arguments in opposition is persuasive.  First, they contend that the \nnew allegations “radically alter the scope and nature of the case” and, in support, point to Pinson \nv. Dep’t of Justice, 246 F. Supp. 3d 211 (D.D.C. 2017).  But Pinson involved a very different \nscenario.  There, after four years of litigation, the plaintiff sought to add claims against new \ndefendants for a different type of injury that was unconnected to the existing claims.  See id. at \n231.  Here, Plaintiffs’ proposed supplemental complaint involves the same parties, the same legal \nclaims, the same general types of relief sought, and similar types of alleged injuries.  Of course, \nclaims raised in a supplemental pleading should generally relate to the original complaint, and, if \nthe supplemental pleading raises new claims, that is a factor that the Court should consider along \nwith all other relevant factors.  See Keith v. Volpe, 858 F.2d 467, 474 (9th Cir. 1988) (quoting 3 \nJ. Moore, Moore’s Federal Practice para. 15.16[3] (1985)).  But here, this factor is, at best, \nneutral.  Although Plaintiffs’ new claims arise from distinct factual premises, they are connected \nto the original claims by a common thread—both arise from Defendants’ alleged failure to plan \nand adequately to respond to events that endanger Plaintiffs’ safety and well-being while held at \nthe Hospital.  \nDefendants reliance on Caton v. Barry, 500 F. Supp. 45 (D.D.C. 1980), is also misplaced.  \nIn Canton, the motion to amend was filed after the court had already “fully resolved” the original \nclaims.  Id. at 54.  Here, in contrast, the proceeding has not advanced beyond the pleading stage.  \nCf. AEP Energy Servs. Gas Holding Co. v. Bank of Am., N.A., 626 F.3d 699, 725 (2d Cir. 2010) \n(“In determining what constitutes ‘prejudice,’ courts consider whether the assertion of the new \nclaim would, among other things, require defendant to expend significant additional resources to \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 48   Filed 04/22/20   Page 5 of 5\nconduct discovery and prepare for trial or significantly delay the resolution of the dispute.”).  As \nPlaintiffs correctly note, see Dkt. 41 at 4–5, litigating COVID-19-related issues in this suit would \nnot be more burdensome, and might be less burdensome, than litigating the same issues in a \nseparate case.  Nor did Plaintiffs delay in filing their emergency motion for leave to amend; they \nsought leave to amend within days of learning about Defendants’ allegedly deficient COVID-19 \nresponse.  Even assuming that Defendants would suffer some prejudice from granting the \nmotion, moreover, any such prejudice is more than offset by Plaintiffs’ substantial interest in the \nexpeditious adjudication of their motion for a preliminary injunction.  Finally, Defendants \nsuggest that the motion should be denied because the underlying suit is meritless.  See Dkt. 40 at \n7.  Jurisdictional discovery is not yet complete with respect to those claims, however, and it is \npremature to ask the Court to pass on a question that remains subject to discovery and briefing.  \nEven if the original water outage claims may not succeed, moreover, that is no reason to \n“needlessly remit[] [Plaintiffs] to the difficulties of commencing a new action.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n15(d), advisory committee note of 1963.    \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons explained above, it is hereby ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ motion to \nsupplement their complaint, Dkt. 36, is GRANTED, and Plaintiffs’ supplemental pleading, Dkt. 36-\n1, is deemed filed.   \nSO ORDERED. \n                                      /s/ Randolph D.

A hospital without water is not really a hospital.  Plaintiffs Enzo Costa, Vinita \nSmith, Stefon Kirkpatrick, and William Dunbar are all patients at Saint Elizabeths Hospital, the \nDistrict’s psychiatric hospital (“Saint Elizabeths” or the “Hospital”).  They are four of \napproximately 270 individuals with mental health disabilities at Saint Elizabeths Hospital.  \nPlaintiffs and other similarly situated patients are currently subject to unconstitutional and \ninhumane conditions that shock the conscience.  Saint Elizabeths Hospital has been without safe, \nrunning water since September 26, 2019, exposing these vulnerable patients to irreparable \nharmful physical, emotional, and mental health consequences.  Although there are reports that \nthe water is being turned back on (see ¶34 below), this is not the first time that government \nofficials have promised that the water will restored during this current crisis.  It is also the second \ntime in three years that Saint Elizabeths Hospital has experienced a major and extended water \noutage. \n2.  The extended water outage is directly impacting necessary patient medical care.  \nDefendants closed the Treatment Mall, the location at the Hospital where treatment planning \nmeetings are held and patients receive group therapy, art therapy, and music therapy, and they \nhave curtailed or suspended a wide variety of therapy and other forms of psychiatric care on \nwhich Plaintiffs and members of the class demand and need to manage and maintain their mental \nhealth.  Patients are confined to their units and their rooms and are unable to attend regularly \nscheduled therapy.  Patients cannot access other forms of routine medical care. \n3.  Unhygienic conditions are pervasive to the point where they are endangering \npatient health.  As a result of the extended water crisis, patients at Saint Elizabeths, all of whom \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185   Document 1   Filed 10/23/19   Page 3 of 23\nare committed to the District’s care and custody, are enduring inhumane, unsafe, and medically \ndangerous conditions that risk the health, mental health, and safety.   Patients cannot shower, \nwash their hands, or use the toilets regularly.  Fecal matter, urine, and menstrual blood are \naccumulating in the bathrooms.  Patients are only allowed to shower on a limited schedule, and \nmust shower outside in dirty and portable showers which are inaccessible to the many patients \nwith mobility disabilities. \n4.  This Class Action Complaint challenges the Defendant’s decision to keep Saint \nElizabeths operating during this extended water crisis without adequate protections for patients.  \nDespite the fact that there is no safe, running water, Defendants are continuing to admit new \npatients at Saint Elizabeths Hospital and to keep patients at Saint Elizabeths rather than \ntransferring them to other appropriate facilities or discharging them to community-based care \nwhere appropriate.  Defendants are not providing appropriate care and safety for Plaintiffs and \nother similarly situated patients in violation their due process rights and rights under federal law \nDefendant’s conduct in continuing to commit Plaintiffs in facility with no safe, running, water is \nso egregious as to shock the conscience. \nSubject Matter Jurisdiction & Venue \n5.  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this case under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 \nand 1343 because this action presents federal questions and seeks to redress the deprivation of \nrights under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983.   \n6.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. §1391(b)(2) because all of the \nevents giving rise to the claims took place in this District. \n7.  Declaratory relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. §2201.  A declaration of law is \nnecessary and appropriate to determine the parties’ respective rights and duties. \n8.  Injunctive relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. § 2202.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185   Document 1   Filed 10/23/19   Page 4 of 23\nParties \n9.  Enzo Costa is thirty-eight years old and is a patient at Saint Elizabeths Hospital in \nUnit 1C.  He is diagnosed with schizophrenia, dystonia, schizo-affective disorder, and anti-social \npersonality disorder.  He is indefinitely, involuntarily civilly committed to the District’s care.   \n10.  Vinita Smith is a fifty-six years old and is a patient at Saint Elizabeths Hospital in \nUnit 1F.  She is diagnosed with schizo-affective disorder that requires medication and therapy.  \nShe is indefinitely, involuntarily civilly committed to the District’s care. \n11.  Stefon Kirkpatrick is thirty years old and is a patient at Saint Elizabeths Hospital \nin Unit 2C.  He is diagnosed with psychosis disorder.  He is indefinitely, involuntarily civilly \ncommitted to the District’s care. \n12.  William Dunbar is thirty years old and is a patient at Saint Elizabeths Hospital in \nUnit 2A. He is diagnosed with paranoia schizophrenia.  He is indefinitely, involuntarily civilly \ncommitted to the District’s care. \n13.  Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated \npatients at Saint Elizabeths Hospital. \n14.  The named Plaintiffs and the members of the Plaintiff Class are persons with a \ndisability or perceived to have a disability, as that term is defined in the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (“ADA”), and are entitled to the protections of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. \n§12102(2)(A). \n15.  Defendant District of Columbia (“the District”) owns and operates Saint \nElizabeths Hospital, and is responsible for the services and supports provided to patients at Saint \nElizabeths.  Saint Elizabeths is the District’s only public psychiatric facility for individuals with \nserious and persistent mental illness who need intensive inpatient care to support their recovery. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185   Document 1   Filed 10/23/19   Page 5 of 23\nSaint Elizabeths also provides mental health evaluations and care to patients committed by the \ncourts. \n16.  The District of Columbia is a public entity as that term is defined in the ADA. 42 \nU.S.C. § 12131(1). \n17.  Defendant Barbara Bazron is the Director of the Department of Behavioral \nHealth, the District agency that oversees Saint Elizabeth.  She is sued in her individual capacity. \n18.  Defendant Mark Chastang is the Chief Executive Officer of Saint Elizabeths \nHospital.  He is sued in his individual capacity.   \nStatement of Facts  \nContaminated Water at Saint Elizabeths Hospital \n19.  Saint Elizabeths Hospital is the District’s public psychiatric facility and serves \nindividuals with mental illness who need intensive inpatient care. Saint Elizabeths is the \nDistrict’s only public psychiatric facility for individuals with serious and persistent mental illness \nwho need intensive inpatient care to support their recovery. Saint Elizabeth’s also provides \nmental health evaluations and care to patients committed by the courts. \n20.  Patients at Saint Elizabeths Hospital are entitled to a dignified, respectful and \nsupportive environment and generally accepted standards of individualized treatment, continuity \nof care, professionalism, and health and safety. \n21.  Saint Elizabeths has an average of 270 patients per day and approximately 700 \nemployees.  \n22.  Saint Elizabeths has not had safe, running water since at least September 26, \n2019.  Since September 26, 2019, the water supply at Saint Elizabeths has been either completely \nturned off or has been limited for sewage use only.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185   Document 1   Filed 10/23/19   Page 6 of 23\n23.  Despite the extended water outage and the inability to provide appropriate, \nrequired medical care and therapy, as described below, Saint Elizabeths is still accepting new \npatients. \n24.  The extended water outage and its effects cause a clear risk to the health and \nsafety of Saint Elizabeths’ patients, including Plaintiffs and class members.  The extended water \noutage and its effects creates an unreasonable risk of traumatizing patients and exacerbates \nsymptoms of mental illness. \n25.  The current conditions at Saint Elizabeths, as described below, will result in long \nlasting, if not permanent, damage to patients and their efforts at recovery.  \n26.  The current conditions at Saint Elizabeths, as described below, violate \nprofessional standards of care and treatment.  \n27.  On September 26, 2019, the D.C. Department of Behavioral Health (“DBH”) \nreceived preliminary lab results for a water quality test of Saint Elizabeths showing evidence of \npseudomonas and legionella bacteria in the facility’s water supply. \n28.  Legionella bacteria is known for causing Legionnaires’ disease, which can lead to \nsevere infections in people with weakened immune systems.  According to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, one out of four people who contract Legionnaires’ disease in a \nhealthcare setting dies because of it. \n29.  Pseudomonas bacteria can lead to severe infections for people with weakened \nimmune systems. \n30.  In response to the bacteria found in the water supply, DBH reportedly \nimplemented its “water emergency protocol” and turned the water off completely.  Upon \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185   Document 1   Filed 10/23/19   Page 7 of 23\ninformation and belief, the water has been turned on occasionally and for limited purposes since \nSeptember 26, 2019 but at no point has Saint Elizabeths had safe, running water. \n31.  At the end of September, Plaintiffs Ms. Smith, Mr. Costa, Mr. Kirkpatrick, and \nMr. Dunbar were abruptly told by staff that the water would be shut off because there was a \nwater problem. \n32.  Upon information and belief, DBH hired contractors to flush Saint Elizabeths’ \nwater system with chlorine, but testing following the “super chlorination” of the water system \ncontinued to show legionella within the facility’s water system. \n33.  According to Plaintiff Mr. Costa, as of 4:00 p.m. on October 23, 2019, the water \nremained shut off at Saint Elizabeths and upon information and belief, DBH has not given a \nprecise date that it will be turned back on. \n34.  At 5:45 p.m. on October 23, 2019, Councilmember Vincent Gray tweeted that he \nhad been informed by an unnamed source that “all bacteria has been eliminated” from the water \nsystem at St. Elizabeths Hospital and that “the process has already begun to restore full water \nservice to the hospital.”  According to Vincent Gray’s tweets, the “toilet are fully operational” \nand “[F]aucet heads are being reconnected now and that process should be fully completed by \ntomorrow [October 24, 2019].”  Vincent Gray has shared no supporting documents, water tests, \nor information from DBH or Saint Elizabeths Hospital on Twitter. \n35.  Each of the previous dates DBH communicated to patients, their attorneys, or the \npublic for when DBH expected to have safe running water has not been met. \n36.  This is the second time in three years that Saint Elizabeths Hospital has \nexperienced an extended water outage.  Defendants’ response to this second extended water \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185   Document 1   Filed 10/23/19   Page 8 of 23\noutage indicates that they do not have an appropriate Emergency Water Supply Plan to manage \nextended water outages at Saint Elizabeths Hospital. \n37.  Plaintiffs are all indefinitely, involuntarily committed to the District’s care and \nwill likely be committed at Saint Elizabeths for all or most of their lives.  For example, Ms. \nSmith has been committed to Saint Elizabeth’s for approximately 17 years. \n38.  As discussed below, the extended water outage at Saint Elizabeths that plaintiffs \ncontinue to suffer is irreparably harming the Plaintiffs and plaintiff class. Furthermore, even if \nthe clean water is restored in the near future, Plaintiffs and the plaintiff class will remain at risk \nof further irreparable harm until the Defendants remediate conditions at Saint Elizabeths, provide \nadequate mental health services to meet the current needs of patients, and establish an \nappropriate Emergency Water Supply Plan. Thus, even if the current crisis is ameliorated, \nPlaintiffs will still be at risk of further irreparable harm.  It is also far from clear that the \nwrongful behavior cannot be expected recur. \nDefendants Are Depriving Patients of Essential Medical and/or Mental Health Care \n39.  The extended water outage at Saint Elizabeths has prevented patients from \nreceiving appropriate and necessary care, including medical care, psychiatric care, and therapy, \ncreating an imminent risk of irreparable harm. \n40.  Because of the extended water outage, Defendants closed the Treatment Mall.  \nPatients remain on their locked wards and are not receiving appropriate group therapy, art \ntherapy, or exercise. \n41.  Staff, including psychologists and psychiatrists, are not regularly attending work \nbecause of the water crisis, forcing cancelations of patient team meetings and other \nappointments. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185   Document 1   Filed 10/23/19   Page 9 of 23\n42.  Defendants have severely curtailed or suspended the psychiatric care on which \npatients depend.  Patients at Saint Elizabeths, including Plaintiffs, are receiving fewer services, \nand less of the services they are still receiving, than normal.  The minimal services they are \nreceiving are not appropriate or tailored to their needs. \n43.  DBH has not explained how it is appropriately dispensing medication, particularly \nthose medications that need to be suspended in water. DBH has not made any statement about \nhow they are addressing patients’ medication side effects that are related to the lack of adequate \nwater or that need water in response, such as dry mouth and dehydration. \n44.  In addition to depriving patients of psychiatric care necessary on an ongoing \nbasis, Saint Elizabeths’ staff are failing to provide other types of health care.  Upon information \nand belief, staff are not performing routine checks of new patients for lice, bacteria, and other \ninfections. \n45.  Patients have no access to dentistry and podiatry care that is typically available at \nSaint Elizabeths. \n46.  Ms. Smith has had a toothache but cannot go to the dentist. \n47.  Mr. Costa’s ward administrator, psychologist, psychiatrist, and therapist have all \nmissed work during the time period while the water was shut off and have not been able to \nconvene his team meetings.  Mr. Costa has been unable to talk to his psychiatrist about switching \none of his medications since the water outage occurred. \n48.  Mr. Costa has not been able to access behavioral therapy, anger management \nclasses, group therapy, art therapy, or the gym since Defendants closed the Treatment Mall. \n49.  Mr. Costa normally gets 40 hours per week of therapy but Defendants are \nproviding him with just 2 hours per day (10 hours per week) currently.  The little therapy he is \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185   Document 1   Filed 10/23/19   Page 10 of 23\nreceiving is inappropriate:  it is a competency restoration group but Mr. Costa is already \ncompetent. \n50.  Because there was no water, Defendants have not provided Mr. Kirkpatrick with \ngroup therapy. \n51.  Defendants cancelled a Narcotics Anonymous meeting that both Mr. Kirkpatrick \nand Mr. Dunbar attend because there was no water. \n52.  Defendants have not provided Mr. Dunbar with group therapy or the opportunity \nto exercise since the water was shut off. \nThe District is Depriving Patients of Essential Hygiene and Endangering Patient Safety \n53.  Without safe, running water, patients and staff cannot flush the toilets regularly, \nwash their hands, shower, wash clothing, or drink from the water fountains.  Patients at Saint \nElizabeths are using bottled water, hand sanitizers, and personal care body wipes to care for their \nbasic hygiene.  Patients are permitted limited use of temporary portable showers and toilets.  \nClothes and linens are only washed periodically and must be sent outside of the facility to be \ncleaned.  \nToilets \n54.  Patients and staff cannot regularly and routinely flush the toilets at Saint \nElizabeths.  Saint Elizabeths has more than 70 operating bathrooms when the facility has running \nwater.  A limited number of toilets within the facility are in use when the water is turned off.  \nThese toilets must be flushed manually by pouring water into the tanks. Staff are only flushing \nthe toilets twice per day, leading to the accumulation of feces, urine, and menstrual blood.  The \ntoilets are overflowing and human waste is flowing onto the floors in some bathrooms.  There \nare also a limited number of port-a-potties outside the facility which were not provided until after \nthe water had been shut off for some time. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185   Document 1   Filed 10/23/19   Page 11 of 23\n55.  Ms. Smith did not have access to port-a-potties for several days after the water \nwas shut off.  While she was awaiting port-a-potties, she used the indoor toilets.  Staff would \nflush those toilets twice per day.  The indoor toilets were disgusting and unclean.  There were \nmenstrual products all over the bathroom. \n56.  Mr. Costa’s unit, Unit 1C, normally has six toilets.  Unit 1C houses 26 men.  \nCurrently all of the men on his unit must use one toilet.  That toilet is flushed manually by \npouring water into the tank only once a day.  The toilets back up and the smell from the toilets is \n“disgusting, pungent, sour, and strong.” \n57.  Mr. Costa did not have access to a port-a-potty until about a week after the water \nwas shut off.  The port-a-potties are outside and about 200 yards from his unit.  The port-a-\npotties are not clean and they smell. \n58.  Mr. Kirkpatrick’s unit has an average of two usable toilets for approximately 25 \npeople.  The toilets do not have running water and are flushed by staff or patients.  There is a \nbuildup of feces on the toilet and floor.  The bathroom smells. \n59.  Mr. Kirkpatrick did not have access to a port-a-potty until about 2-3 weeks after \nthe water was shut off. \n60.  Mr. Dunbar’s unit, Unit 2A, only has 2 usable toilets for approximately 27 people.  \nThe smell of the toilets is so nasty and strong that it makes Mr. Dunbar want to vomit.  Mr. \nDunbar is able to secure day passes to temporarily leave the facility and during this time he tries \nholds his solid waste until he can use toilets outside of Saint Elizabeths grounds. \nShowers \n61.  Patients cannot use the indoor showers at Saint Elizabeths.  Patients have to bathe \nin portable outdoor showers.  DBH secured eight portable showers for Saint Elizabeths’ entire \npatient population. The portable showers are clogged and dirty. The patients have to stand \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185   Document 1   Filed 10/23/19   Page 12 of 23\noutside in groups and take showers in rotation because they have to travel back inside the facility \nas a group.  There is no privacy in the showers. \n62.  Before the outdoor showers arrived, Ms. Smith had to use wipes to clean herself \nbecause she was not permitted to shower indoors.  She does not like using the wipes and does not \nfeel clean using the wipes. \n63.  Ms. Smith is only permitted to use the outdoor showers on Mondays, Wednesdays \nand Fridays, rather than showering every day.  She is not allowed to use the showers when it is \nraining.   \n64.  Mr. Costa did not have access to a shower until about a week after the water was \nshut off.  On his unit, only 8 individuals are permitted to use the portable showers per day.  His \nunit can use the portable showers on Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays, which means that he is \nonly able to shower one time per week. \n65.  One time that Mr. Costa was permitted to shower, the water was cold.  After he \nshowered he had to stand outside in the cold temperatures while waiting for everyone to finish \nshowering.  He got a headache as a result. \n66.  When Mr. Costa does not have access to a shower, he has the options to clean \nhimself with sanitary wipes or a five gallon bucket of soapy water and a wash rag.  The wipes \nmake his skin uncomfortable.  Washing with a bucket is degrading and Mr. Costa has not used \nthat option because it makes him feel like he is treated like an animal. \n67.  Mr. Kirkpatrick used a portable shower and had to stand outside in the cold while \nothers finished showering.  He got sick after using the portable shower, experiencing chills and a \nmigraine. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185   Document 1   Filed 10/23/19   Page 13 of 23\n68.  Mr. Dunbar did not have access to a portable shower for several days after the \nwater was shut off.  When he was able to access a portable shower, the water kept turning on and \noff. \n69.  The portable showers are not accessible for patients who use wheelchairs and with \nother mobility issues.  The portable showers have steps up to them.  The portable showers have \nnarrow passageways inside. Many older patients are unable to use them. \n70.  Ms. Smith’s knee gave out one day while walking up the stairs to the shower. \n71.  Upon information and belief, the portable showers are being overseen by male \nsecurity guards only. Many women at Saint Elizabeths are survivors of sexual assault and do not \nfeel safe using the portable showers. As a result, some of the women have not showered for more \nthan four weeks.  \nOther Essential Hygiene Needs \n72.  Ms. Smith cannot wash her hands.  She must use bottled water to brush her teeth \nand is not always given enough water to brush her teeth.  She has not washed her hair in three \nweeks.  She cannot do laundry in the hospital and when her cloths were sent out to the laundry, \nsome of them went missing.  She currently only has one clean outfit to wear.   Ms. Smith’s unit \nhas been unusually cold while the water has been shut off.   Ms. Smith’s unit smells like dead \nrats. \n73.  Mr. Costa cannot use the faucets to wash his hands, brush his teeth, or shower.  \nThe dirty toilets have attracted bugs and mosquitos that are biting him and others on his unit. \n74.  Mr. Kirkpatrick cannot use the water.  He cannot do laundry and does not have \naccess to a washer-dryer.  He does not know when he will be able to do laundry or obtain clean \nclothes again. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185   Document 1   Filed 10/23/19   Page 14 of 23\n75.  Mr. Dunbar cannot use the water and has to use bottled water to drink and to \nbrush his teeth.  Because the conditions in the bathrooms are so dirty and unhygienic, he does not \nfeel comfortable using the bathrooms or cleaning his teeth.  Some of the closed bathrooms in his \nunit have signs indicating that they are quarantined because of a bacterial infection. He has had \nhis laundry sent out only once in the last three weeks.  When his clothes were returned some had \nshrunk and they still felt dirty. \n76.  Mr. Dunbar is permitted to leave the facility on a day pass approximately two \ntimes per month. He normally spends time with his family.  Because of the unsanitary \nconditions, he worries about bringing home bacteria and spreading it to his family. \nThe District is Depriving Patients of a Safe and Therapeutic Environment \n77.  The lack of water has caused a tense and stressful environment among patients \nand staff.   Patients are confined to their units during the day instead of receiving therapy and \nrecreation.  Staff are not regularly reporting for work. \n78.  A restrictive psychiatric hospital setting like Saint Elizabeths must be safe, calm, \npredictable in its routine, and responsive to each individual’s needs for treatment in order to \nachieve its goals of preventing and ameliorating harm. \n79.  An environment that is chaotic, unpredictable, and unsafe, in which patients are \nnot receiving individualized, continuous, intensive treatment risks traumatizing people further \nand exacerbating the psychiatric needs that were the basis for their admission. \n80.  Delays in treatment of psychiatric illness in a psychiatric facility that restricts self-\ndetermination and integration into community-based settings, like Saint Elizabeths, can result in \nfeelings of isolation, hopelessness, and despair; and increased stress and anxiety. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185   Document 1   Filed 10/23/19   Page 15 of 23\n81.  Patients, including Ms. Smith and Mr. Costa, are unable to leave their units and \nrooms to receive treatments or recreate.  As a result, they and other patients are sleeping and \ndozing during the day.  \n82.  There has been an increase in fights and physical aggression between patients \nfollowing the water outage. \n83.  There has been an increase in the use of seclusion and restraint of the patients \nfollowing the water outage. \nThe District Bears Responsibility for the Conditions at St. Elizabeths \n84.  As the director of DBH, the agency that oversees Saint Elizabeths, Defendant \nBazron has the authority to “[s]upervise and direct the Department” and “[e]xercise any other \npowers necessary and appropriate to implement the provisions of this chapter.” D.C. Code § 7-\n1141.04. \n85.  These powers make Defendant Bazron the final policymaking authority with \nrespect to responding to emergencies at St. Elizabeths. \n86.  Defendant Bazron is responsible for the fact that, during the water crisis, Saint \nElizabeths has continued housing patients in unsafe conditions without adequate protections.  \n87.  Defendant Bazron informed reporters that she and her team were “very, very \ninvolved in making sure that we got the [water] problem solved.” \n88.  Defendant Bazron further demonstrated her responsibility for Saint Elizabeths’ \ndecision to keep patients in dangerous conditions without adequate protections by explaining and \ndefending that approach to the public through multiple statements to journalists. \n89.  For example, Defendant Bazron told reporters that DBH had procured “an \nextensive supply of bottled water” but had continued admitting patients and declined to move \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185   Document 1   Filed 10/23/19   Page 16 of 23\npatients to other locations.  Defendant Bazron also endorsed DBH’s response, stating that \n“[t]hings are really moving very smoothly. \n90.  Additionally, Defendants displayed deliberate indifference to the risk that the \nresponse to the conditions at St. Elizabeths would result in constitutional violations.  By shutting \noff the water at that facility, Defendants knew or should have known that they would drastically \ncurtail access to showers, toilets, clean clothing, and medical care, and create disorder that could \nexacerbate patients’ mental health disabilities.  The policy Defendants adopted in response to this \nrisk was not reasonably calculated to prevent it. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n91.  The named Plaintiffs bring this suit on their own behalf and on behalf of all \ncurrent Saint Elizabeths Hospital patients and all patients who will be admitted in the future \nwhile the water is shut off. \n92.  This class is so numerous that joinder of all members in impractical.  Saint \nElizabeths Hospital has approximately 270 patients currently.  Because the population changes \non a daily basis, it is inherently fluid and the class also includes future members whose names \nare not known at this time.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). \n93.  There are questions of law and fact common to all class members, including but \nnot limited to the Defendants’ deprivation of the class members’ substantive due process rights, \nthe Defendants’ failure to provide constitutionally safe and humane conditions to class members \nand the Defendants’ failure to provide appropriate medical care to class members, and the \nDistrict’s violation of the class members’ rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). \n94.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.  \nThey possess a strong personal interest in the subject matter of the lawsuit and are represented by \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185   Document 1   Filed 10/23/19   Page 17 of 23\nexperienced counsel with expertise in class action litigation in federal court.  Counsel have the \nlegal knowledge and resources to fairly and adequately represent the interests of all class \nmembers in this action.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). \n95.  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the \nclass in that Defendants’ policies and practices of violating the Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights \nhave affected all class members. Accordingly, final injunctive and declaratory relief is \nappropriate to the class as a whole. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \nNECESSITY FOR EMERGENCY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n96.  The Defendants have acted and, as of the time of filing, continue to act in \nviolation of the law as described above. The named Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent \ndo not have an adequate remedy at law. As a result of the policies, practices, acts, and omissions \nof the Defendants, the named Plaintiffs, and the class they seek to represent, have suffered, are \nsuffering, and will suffer serious, imminent, irreparable physical, mental, and emotional injuries.  \nSuch serious injuries are continuing and likely irreversible. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF: \n(Claim under 42 U.S.C. §1983 for violation of the Fifth Amendment—Due Process) \n97.  The Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause protects individuals in the District of \nColumbia from government conduct that deprives them of their constitutional rights because it is \n“so egregious that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.” \n98.  Individuals who are committed to the District’s custody, like the named Plaintiffs \nand other class members, have a protected constitutional right under the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fifth Amendment to be housed in humane conditions and to have the District take reasonable \nsteps to guarantee their safety. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185   Document 1   Filed 10/23/19   Page 18 of 23\n99.  Defendants’ actions are depriving class members of humane conditions by failing \nto provide running water which deprives them of basic sanitation including sanitary toileting, \nsafe and sanitary showers, and clean clothes and linens, as alleged in Paragraphs 22 and 53 \nthrough 76 and by failing to maintain an appropriate Emergency Water Supply Plan after the first \nextended water outage, as alleged in Paragraph 36,  Defendants’ actions and inactions shock the \nconscience and deprive class members of their constitutionally protected rights. \n100.  Individuals who are committed to the District’s custody, like the named Plaintiffs \nand other class members, have a protected constitutional right under the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fifth Amendment to be afforded adequate medical care, including mental health care. \n101.  Defendants’ actions in unilaterally ceasing or altering medical care, as alleged in \nParagraphs 26 and 39 through 52, departs from professionally accepted standards and/or \nappropriate professional judgement, and deprive class members of their constitutionally \nprotected rights. \n102.   Defendants’ policies, practices, acts, and/or omissions have placed and will \ncontinue to place the named Plaintiffs and the members of the class they seek to represent at an \nunreasonable risk of harm as alleged in Paragraphs 1, 24, 28, 29, 38, and 39.  \n103.  There is no reasonable justification for the Defendants’ actions.   \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF: \n(Claim against the District of Columbia under 42 U.S.C. §12131 et seq. for violation of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act) \n104.  Plaintiffs re-allege the allegations in all preceding paragraphs as though fully set \nforth herein. \n105.  The named Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class are individuals with disabilities \nwithin the meaning of the ADA. Their impairments substantially limit one or more major life \nactivities, including caring for oneself, concentrating, and thinking. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185   Document 1   Filed 10/23/19   Page 19 of 23\n106.  As adults who have been determined to require intensive inpatient care to support \ntheir recovery from serious and persistent mental illness by the District, the named Plaintiffs and \nthe Plaintiff Class are qualified to participate in Defendants’ behavioral health programs and \nservices. 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2). \n107.  The District of Columbia is a public entity as defined by Title II of the ADA. 42 \nU.S.C. § 12131(1). \n108.  The District of Columbia is failing to reasonably modify its system to avoid \ndiscrimination, including but not limited to by (i) failing to cease intakes and (ii) failing to \nconduct individual assessments of patients to determine whether other options exist in lieu of \ncontinued placement at Saint Elizabeths and (iii) failing to take appropriate action for Plaintiffs \nand other class members, including relocating within the District those patients for whom it is \nappropriate or providing reasonably modified services for those for whom relocating is not \nappropriate. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7). \n109.  The District of Columbia is utilizing methods of administration, including but not \nlimited to restricting all access to the Treatment Mall and thereby preventing planning team \nmeetings and suspending art and music therapy, vocational training, exercise, and socialization; \nproviding inappropriate and diminished group therapy sessions; restricting patient movement to \nthe patient’s unit;, intermittently shutting off the water; inappropriately restricting toilets and \nshower use, providing inaccessible portable showers; and suspending medically necessary \nservices such as dentistry and podiatry as alleged in ¶¶ 25, 30, 35, 36, 37, 40, 49, 65, and 73 \nabove, that have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the \nobjectives of Defendants’ behavioral health programs with respect to the Individual Named \nPlaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(ii). \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185   Document 1   Filed 10/23/19   Page 20 of 23\n110.  Defendants’ policies, practices, acts, and/or omissions violate the Americans with \nDisabilities Act.  42 U.S.C. §12131 \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nBased on the foregoing, Plaintiffs request that the Court: \n111.  Declare that Defendants violated Plaintiffs’ rights under the Fifth Amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution; \n112.  Declare that Defendants violated Plaintiffs’ rights under the Americans with \nDisabilities Act;  \n113.  Order injunctive relief requiring Defendants their agents, employees, and all \npersons acting in concert with or on behalf of Defendants to cease their unconstitutional and \nunlawful practices, including: \na.  During any extended water outage, immediate cessation of admissions at \nSaint Elizabeths to the greatest extent possible; \nb.  Within 48 hours during any extended water outage,, conduct individual \nassessments of patients by the Medical Director with input from the \npatients’ treatment team, his/her attorney, and/or other supportive decision \nmakers as determined by patient choice to assess the effects of the current \nconditions and determine whether other options exist in lieu of continued \nplacement at Saint Elizabeths;   \nc.  Implement recommendations from the assessments immediately: \ni  The assessment team must consider a full range of available \nalternative treatment options, including discharge to a community \nsetting. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185   Document 1   Filed 10/23/19   Page 21 of 23\nii  Under no circumstances should an individual be transferred to a \njail or nursing home. \niii  To the extent continued placement at Saint Elizabeths’ Hospital is \nthe only reasonable option, patients must receive medical care and \ntherapy as scheduled and specific steps should be taken to ensure \nthat each patient has timely and complete access to sanitation, \nclean water, safely prepared meals, and other basic requirements \nfor health, safety, and privacy. \nd.  Conduct independent testing to ensure that the water is safe for all uses; \ne.  Sanitize all Saint Elizabeths hospital facilities; \nf.  Restore sanitation services and other services that were discontinued or \ndelayed during the extended water outage; \ng.  Immediately resume providing all medical and mental health treatment \nservices, including but not limited to opening the Treatment Mall and \nproviding all previously available services; \nh.  Within 48 hours, conduct individual assessments of patients by the \nMedical Director with input from the patients’ treatment team, his/her \nattorney, and/or other supportive decision makers as determined by patient \nchoice to assess the effects of the stress and trauma of living without safe, \nrunning water in the conditions described above and the deprivation of \nappropriate mental health services has had on patients’ mental health \nstatus and determine if changes to individual patients’ treatment plans are \nneeded; \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185   Document 1   Filed 10/23/19   Page 22 of 23\ni.  Implement any changes and recommendations from the individualized \nassessments immediately; \nj.  Conduct regular, independent testing to ensure that the water is safe; and \nk.  Appoint an independent monitor to advise the parties and the court about \nthe implementation of any injunctive relief. \nOrder Defendants to develop and adopt an appropriate Emergency Water Supply \nPlan with input from community members and the District’s protection and \nadvocacy organization. \n114.

Amici identified numerous areas in which Defendants, despite earnest efforts, failed \nto comply with professional standards of care, including the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (“CDC”) Guidelines.  This violates the Constitution. \n  Amici have also confirmed that there has been an extraordinary curtailment of mental health \ncare at the facility—including a 98% drop in the amount of treatment provided. ECF 78 at 5, 15.  \nAmici also report that the Hospital has failed to implement its plan for telehealth or other alternative \ntreatment, and 90% of individual plans include treatments that the Hospital has suspended. Id. at \n16-18.  This fails to comply with professional standards and violates the Constitution. \nWhile Defendants have reduced the patient population, amici report that as of May 6, there \nare over 50 patients on the “ready for discharge” list.  ECF 78 at 8.  The continued detention of \npatients the Hospital has deemed “ready for discharge,” where such patients face heightened risk \nof  exposure  to  COVID-19,  fails  to  comply  with  professional  standards,  and  violates  the \nConstitution and the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”).  \n  This Court should convert the Temporary Restraining Order (ECF 83) into a Preliminary \nInjunction.  While the Hospital has modified certain practices in response to this lawsuit, these \nmeasures have not been enough.  Even if Defendants had fully complied with CDC Guidance—\nwhich they have not—or the terms of the TRO, the “court’s power to grant injunctive relief \nsurvives discontinuance of the illegal conduct, and because the purpose is to prevent further \nviolations, injunctive relief is appropriate when there is a cognizable danger of recurrent violation.”  \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 7 of 46\nU.S. Dep’t of Justice v. Daniel Chapter One, 89 F. Supp. 3d 132, 143 (D.D.C. 2015) (quoting \nUnited States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629 (1953)), aff’d, 650 F. App’x 20 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  \nIt is for this reason that courts around the country have recognized that temporary orders protecting \nindividuals in congregate settings from substandard conditions must be extended.  \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n1.  Saint Elizabeths Hospital and Its Patients \nSaint Elizabeths Hospital is the District’s only public psychiatric facility for individuals \nwith serious and persistent mental illness who need intensive inpatient care to support their \nrecovery. ECF 59 at 1-2; ECF 81 at 3.  It also provides mental health evaluations and care to \npatients committed by the courts.  ECF 81 at 3.  Prior to the COVID-19 crisis, Saint Elizabeths \nhad  an  average  patient  population  of  275,  ECF  59  at  2,  which  has  now  been  reduced  to \napproximately 199.  ECF 81 at 4.  It has 786 staff.  ECF 81 at 3.   \n2.  The 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Threat to Saint Elizabeths \n  As the Court is well aware, the COVID-19 pandemic is a serious threat to public health.  \nECF 59 at 2, ECF 39-1 at 6-9.  The CDC estimates that as of May 13, 2020, there are 1,364,061 \nconfirmed cases and 82,246 confirmed deaths in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.1  \nCOVID-19 is highly contagious.  Declaration of Dr. Marc Stern, M.D., M.P.H. (“Stern Decl.”) \n(ECF 39-3) ¶ 8; Declaration of Dr. Johnathan L. Golob, M.D. (“Golob Decl.”) (ECF 39-4) ¶ 13.   \n  Medical and mental health professionals have consistently made clear that individuals with \nmental health disorders require priority attention in this kind of emergency.  Golob Decl. (ECF 39-\n \n1 CTRS. DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION, Cases in U.S., https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-\nupdates/cases-in-us.html. (last visited May 14, 2020). \n2 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 8 of 46\n4) ¶ 14.  Mental health disorders like those experienced by Plaintiffs can increase the risk of \ninfections, including pneumonia, a leading cause of hospitalization and death among those infected \nwith COVID-19.2  Congregate settings like Saint Elizabeths enable and facilitate the rapid spread \nof COVID-19 infection.  Stern Decl. (ECF 39-3) ¶ 13; Golob Decl. (ECF 39-4) ¶ 13.   \n  When  patients  are  housed  in  close  quarters,  the  risks  of  spread  are  greatly,  if  not \nexponentially, increased.  Stern Decl. (ECF 39-3) ¶ 12; Golob Decl. (ECF 39-4) ¶ 14.  Because \npeople — including staff and contractors —constantly cycle in and out of Saint Elizabeths and some \nnew patients are being admitted (as required by orders of the D.C. Superior Court), there is an \never-present risk that new carriers will bring the virus into the facility.  5/7 Tr. 7, 24-25 (risk from \nnew admissions), 11 & 24 (risk from staff); ECF 81-1 at 1-2 (new admissions), 5 (staff). \nOn April 1, 2020, one patient and five staff members at St. Elizabeths were confirmed to \nbe COVID-19 positive.3  As of April 16, 2020, when the Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint \nseeking relief related to the COVID-19 outbreak at the Hospital, at least 33 patients, as well as at \nleast 51 of the hospital’s staff, had tested positive for COVID-19, and at least four patients had \ndied after contracting COVID-19. See ECF 39-1 at 11 & n. 30-31.   \nAfter expedited proceedings, the Court found that the conditions at the Hospital violated \nPlaintiffs’ due process rights and therefore issued a Temporary Restraining Order on April 25, \n2020.  ECF 59 & 60.  The TRO required discrete changes to Defendants’ practices regarding \nisolation and release from isolation, as well as reporting on compliance efforts. ECF 60.  The Court \n \n2 See Hao Yao, et al., Patients with mental health disorders in the COVID-19 epidemic, The Lancet, Vol. 7 Issue 4 at \ne21 (Apr. 1, 2020), https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanpsy/PIIS2215-0366(20)30090-0.pdf. \n3  Dist.  of  Columbia  Dep’t  of  Human  Servs.,  Human  Services  Agency  COVID-19  Case  Data, \nhttps://coronavirus.dc.gov/page/human-services-agency-covid-19-case-data (last accessed May 14, 2020). \n3 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 9 of 46\nthen appointed as amici curiae three experts to investigate and report to the Court about conditions \nat the Hospital. ECF 68. In response to the experts’ reports (ECF 78, 81 & 81-1) and with the \nnumbers of cases and of deaths among the patient population rising even after the TRO was \nentered, on May 11 the Court extended and expanded the TRO to require further testing and the \nreduction of staff movement among different treatment units. ECF 82 & 83. \nAs of May 13, 2020, at least 79 patients, as well as at least 84 staff, had tested positive for \nCOVID-19.4 An additional 56 patients were reported to be in quarantine due to exposure or \nsymptoms consistent with COVID-19.5  At least 13 patients and one staff member have died after \ncontracting COVID-19.6 \n3.  Conditions at Saint Elizabeths Hospital Before and After the TRO \na.  Medical Isolation and Quarantine Procedures  \n  When there are COVID-19 cases in a congregate facility, the CDC recommends grouping \nill residents with dedicated health care professionals, ECF 81-1 at 4-5, and medically isolating \npatients who may have been exposed.7  When Plaintiffs moved for a TRO, Saint Elizabeths had \nestablished only one unit with seven beds to quarantine COVID-19 patients.  Guzman Decl. (ECF \n39-9) ¶ 3a.  While that motion was pending, it established a second COVID-19 positive unit, and \na “Patients Under Investigation” unit.  Tu Decl. (ECF 42-5) ¶ 7.  As this Court found, however, \nDefendants’ quarantining practices and their standard for determining when to release individuals \n \n4  Dist.  of  Columbia  Dep’t  of  Human  Servs.,  Human  Services  Agency  COVID-19  Case  Data, \nhttps://coronavirus.dc.gov/page/human-services-agency-covid-19-case-data (last accessed May 14, 2020). \n5 Id. \n6 Id. \n7 CTRS.

ECF 59 at 13-16.  The resulting risk to Plaintiffs was \n“immediate and manifest.” ECF 59 at 14. \nThe Hospital currently has four COVID positive units, seven additional quarantine units, a \n“Patients Under Investigation” unit, and two units for patients not suspected of having been \nexposed to COVID-19.  ECF 81-1 at 2-4.  As amici note, there is considerable evidence that \nDefendants are still not satisfying CDC standards and “maintaining the integrity [of the known \ninfection, exposed, and symptomatic patients] has proven to be challenging.”  ECF 81 at 4.  As \nDr. Waldman summarized on May 7, the Hospital’s efforts to quarantine and group individuals \nwith similar status after the TRO had been executed “obviously imperfectly.”  May 7 Tr. 8.  See   \nalso Ex. 1 (Decl. of Ieshaah Murphy (“Murphy Decl.”) ¶ 4 (describing “Client A” using the \ncommunal bathrooms and watching TV and playing video games with other residents while \nawaiting COVID-19 test results, which turned out to be positive). \nb.  Screening and Testing \n  As discussed in the Court’s May 11 order, the CDC guidance for nursing homes states that \n“the first step of a test-based prevention strategy should ideally be a point prevalence survey (PPS) \nof all residents and all HCP [health care professionals] in the facility.”8 See ECF 82 at 6-7. \nWhen Plaintiffs moved for a TRO, patients were not being tested for COVID-19, even \nwhen  they  displayed  characteristic  symptoms  of  the  virus,  and  Defendants  reported  having \nconducted only 31 tests.

DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION, Coronavirus Disease 2019, Testing for Coronavirus in Nursing Homes, \nECF 55-1.  \n5 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 11 of 46\nSince the TRO was entered, Defendants conducted 87 tests of patients quarantined on the \nseven quarantine units on May 4-5.  ECF 81 at 4.  Twenty-one patients on these units refused \ntesting.  Id.  The Hospital has not been ensuring that staff are tested; rather that testing staff at the \nfacility as part of the virus management strategy, the Defendants have referred staff who choose \nto be tested to external testing sites.  May 7 Tr. 21-22.  Amici report that only 100 of the 786 staff \nhave been tested.  ECF 81-1 at 3, 6. \nIn extending and expanding the TRO on May 11, the Court found that Defendants’ \nfailure to test staff and failure to limit staff’s movements among the treatment units contravened \nCDC guidance and failed the professional judgment standard. ECF 82 at 6-8. \nc.  Distribution of Masks \nWhen there are cases in a facility, the CDC recommends that the facility should implement \nuniversal use of facemasks for health care professionals, encourage patients to remain in their \nrooms, and encourage patients to wear face masks and perform social distancing when they leave \ntheir rooms.9 \n  As the Court recognized in granting the TRO, at the time Plaintiffs filed for the TRO, \nDefendants had not provided masks to all patients or instructed or required patients to wear masks \nin a manner consistent with public health guidelines. ECF 59 at 13-14.  Amici reported that \nDefendants implemented a “universal masking requirement” on April 15, ECF 81 at 5, and that \nmost patients and all staff were observed as complying. ECF 81 at 6, 8.  Amici also noted, however, \nthat the staff’s reuse of masks was not in accordance with CDC guidance and presented a \n \n9 Id. \n6 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 12 of 46\n“contamination risk.”  May 7 Tr. 30, 34.  The CDC guidance provides that when masks are reused \nthere should be “a minimum of five days between each [mask] use.”10 \nd.  Psychiatric Treatment during the Outbreak  \n  Guidance from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration \n(“SAMHSA”) provides that state psychiatric hospitals like Saint Elizabeths should take steps to \naddress the psychological impact of quarantine and the disruptions the COVID-19 virus may \ncause, including preserving health care system functions and taking steps to provide alternatives \nto in-person and group therapy consistent with CDC guidelines on infection control and increased \npsychological  screening  with  “utilization  of  clear  clinical  indications  and,  when  applicable, \nvalidated psychiatric screening instruments.”  Ex. 2 (SAMHSA COVID-19 Interim Considerations \nfor State Psychiatric Hospitals at 3-4).11  \n  Prior to the TRO, Plaintiffs reported there had been severe curtailment of mental health \ncare,  including  closing  the  Treatment  Mall,  suspended  group  therapy,  suspended  anger \nmanagement classes and suspension of most competency restoration classes.  Smith Decl. (ECF \n39-8) ¶ 10; Costa Decl. (ECF 39-6) ¶ 9; Dunbar Decl. (ECF 39-7) ¶ 7. \n \n10 CTRS.

The SAMHSA guidelines recommend that facilities “preserve healthcare system functioning” and ”be \naware of the psychological impact of quarantine and major disruptions to everyday life…Patients at mental health \nfacilities are vulnerable both to the infection itself, but also to worsening anxiety, mood, or psychosis during this \ntime. Given the uncertainty and rapid change associated with the virus, anxiety and distress should be anticipated.” \n7 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 13 of 46\nRegarding mental health care, Defendants have claimed “much . . . remains unchanged \nduring the COVID-19 emergency,” ECF 42 at 12, and “each patient unit has a shared computer” \nto enable teletherapy.  Gongtang Decl. (ECF 42-2) ¶ 12.   \nTo the contrary, amici report that “Between February 2020 and April 2020 there has been \na dramatic decrease in the provision of mental health services at the hospital.” ECF 78 at 15 (noting \nthat hours of reported treatments fell from 6000 in February to less than 100 in April—a 98% \ndrop).  Amici found that the Hospital’s plans for “a limited telehealth program” have “been \ndelayed,” ECF 78 at 17, and that, even when implemented, the provision of “technology provided \nto individuals in care” will remain “very limited” because “each unit will get only one cart . . . \nwhich will significantly limit the number of groups which can be held.”  Id.  Plaintiffs have been \ndirectly impacted by the decreases in mental health services.  Plaintiffs have not participated in the \ntherapies  ordered  by  their  individual  plans,  including  Dialectic  Behavior  Therapy,  Anger \nManagement, Community Training, or Women’s Coping, since the TLC was closed.  Ex. 3 \n(Second Declaration of Vinita Smith (“Smith 2nd Decl.”)) ¶ 7, Ex. 4 (Second Declaration of Enzo \nCosta (“Costa 2nd Decl.)) ¶¶ 12-13; Ex. 5 (Second Declaration of William Dunbar (“Dunbar 2nd \nDecl.”)) ¶¶ 16-17.  See also Murphy Decl. ¶ 4. \nARGUMENT \nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, the moving party must establish that: (1) it is likely to \nsucceed on the merits; (2) it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; \n(3) that the balance of equities tips in its favor; and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest.  \nGordon v. Holder, 632 F.3d 722, 724 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  \n8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 14 of 46\nThe Court has authority to order relief to remedy unconstitutional conditions, including by \nrelease. The writ of habeas corpus, which “cuts through all forms and goes to the very tissue of the \nstructure,” Chatman-Bey v. Thornburgh, 864 F.2d 804, 807 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (en banc) provides \nauthority for release and also to order remedies for unconstitutional conditions of confinement, as \n“[h]abeas corpus tests not only the fact but also the form of detention.” Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d \n1023, 1033 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (quoting Hudson v. Hardy, 424 F.2d 854, 833 n. 3 (D.C. Cir. 1970)) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). The court’s remedial authority under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is \n“broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.” Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. \n678, 687 n.9 (1978); Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 15 (1971)).  \nThe Hospital has made certain modifications to its practices since Plaintiffs filed for a TRO.  \nWhile these measures have slowed the spread of COVID-19, they are not enough.  As amici noted, \nthe Hospital “continues to experience ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.”  ECF 81 at 2.  And \nthis Court found just three days ago that Defendants have continued to fail to exercise professional \njudgment consistent with CDC guidance in key respects. ECF 82 at 6-8. \nWhile Defendants have repeatedly cited their modifications as reasons why injunctive \nrelief should not be granted, ECF 42 at 1, 20; Apr. 22 Tr. 20; Apr. 24 Tr. 23-24 and ECF 74 at 6, \n10, the “court’s power to grant injunctive relief survives discontinuance of the illegal conduct, and \nbecause the purpose is to prevent further violations, injunctive relief is appropriate when there is \na cognizable danger of recurrent violation.”  U.S. Dep’t of Justice v. Daniel Chapter One, 89 F. \nSupp. 3d 132, 143 (D.D.C. 2015) (quoting United States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633 \n(1953)), aff’d, 650 F. App’x 20 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  “In the context of seeking injunctive relief, once \na violation is demonstrated, all that need to be shown is that there is some reasonable likelihood \n9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 15 of 46\nof future violations, and past unlawful conduct is highly suggestive of the likelihood of future \nviolations.”  Id.  “It is the duty of the court to beware of efforts to defeat injunctive relief by \nprotestations of repentance and reform . . . .”  United States v. Ore. State Med. Soc., 343 U.S. 326, \n333 (1952). \n1.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits of Their Claims \nIn issuing the TRO, the Court found that “Plaintiffs have established a likelihood of success \non the merits with respect to the two priority issues”—quarantining practices and releases from \nmedical isolation—raised at that stage.  ECF 59 at 16.  In extending the TRO, the Court found “the \nhospital’s pre-TRO efforts fell short in the specified respects, see Dkt. 59, and no new evidence \nsuggests that the Court’s finding was incorrect.”  ECF 82 at 5-6.  Plaintiffs remain substantially \nlikely to prevail on the merits.  \nNone of the patients at Saint Elizabeths are serving time after criminal conviction.  Under \nthe due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, “pretrial detainees (unlike convicted prisoners) \ncannot be punished at all.” Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2475 (2015); Banks v. \nBooth, No. CV 20-849(CKK), 2020 WL 1914896 at *6 (D.D.C. Apr. 19, 2020).  Pretrial \ndetainees can demonstrate that they have been “punished” if the actions taken against them are \nobjectively unreasonable. See Kingsley, 135 S. Ct. at 2473.   The government also “has an \naffirmative duty to ensure the safety and general well-being of an involuntarily committed mental \npatient.”  ECF 59 at 10 (citing Harvey v. District of Columbia, 798 F.3d 1042, 1050-51 (D.C. \nCir. 2015)).  Due process standards for civil detainees, like those for pretrial detainees, are higher \nthan  those  for  individuals  convicted  of  crimes:  “[p]ersons  who  have  been  involuntarily \ncommitted  are  entitled  to  more  considerate  treatment  and  conditions  of  confinement  than \n10 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 16 of 46\ncriminals whose conditions of confinement are designed to punish.” Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 \nU.S. 307, 321-22 (1982).  Among the most basic rights of civil and pretrial detainees are the right \nto  adequate  medical  care,  Youngberg,  457  U.S.  at  324  (1982),  and  reasonable  safety  in \nconfinement, see Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993) (holding that even convicted \nindividuals may not be subjected to “a condition of confinement that is . . . very likely to cause \nserious illness and needless suffering.”). The right to medical care includes the right to mental \nhealth care. See Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 506 (2011).   \nIf the Court finds that the conditions at the Hospital have been objectively unreasonable \nand/or fail to ensure Plaintiffs’ safety and well-being, then Plaintiffs and putative class members—\nall of whom are civil or pretrial detainees—have made out a Fifth Amendment claim regardless of \nDefendants’ subjective intent.  Darnell v. Pineiro, 849 F.3d 17, 35 (2d Cir. 2017) (“[T]he Due \nProcess Clause can be violated when an official does not have subjective awareness that the \nofficial’s acts (or omissions) have subjected the pretrial detainee to a substantial risk of harm.”).  \nLiability exists “when the decision by the professional is such a substantial departure from accepted \nprofessional judgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate that the person responsible actually \ndid not base the decision on such a judgment.”  ECF 59 at 11 (quoting LaShawn A. v Dixon, 762 F. \nSupp. 959, 994 (D.D.C. 1991) (in turn quoting Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 323). \nHere, the record evidence—in the form of the findings presented by amici, sworn affidavits \nfrom residents in Defendants’ custody, from attorneys and investigators from PDS who have \nwitnessed  first-hand  the  conditions  of  Defendants’  facilities,  and  expert  declarations—amply \ndemonstrates that Plaintiffs and putative class members are facing a “substantial risk” of serious \nharm that is unconstitutional because they are exposed to a “serious, communicable disease.” \n11 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 17 of 46\nHelling, 509 U.S. at 33, and because Defendants have failed to provide adequate mental health \ncare that comports with applicable standards of professional judgment. Youngberg, 457 U.S. at \n314, 323; ECF 59 at 11.   \nAs identified by amici and the record evidence, and held by this Court, ECF 59 & 81, \nDefendants unconstitutionally failed and continue to fail to protect the health and safety of \nPlaintiffs from the risk of COVID-19 in several critical areas, all of which represent substantial \ndepartures from accepted professional judgments.  Amici and the record evidence have also \nestablished that there has been an unconstitutional curtailment of mental health care, that patients \nsystemically are not receiving the care prescribed in their treatment plans, and that the Hospital is \ncontinuing to detain more than 50 people on the “ready to release” list even though keeping them \nin the Hospital exposes them to an unnecessary risk of contracting COVID-19, deprives them of \nadequate mental health care and violates their rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act to \nreceive treatment in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.  \na.  The  Defendants  Have  Substantially  Departed  from  Accepted \nProfessional  Judgments  in  Their  Efforts  to  Control  and  Prevent \nCOVID-19 Infections.  \n \nDefendants have unconstitutionally failed to protect the health and safety of Plaintiffs in \nseveral  key  areas,  all  of  which  represent  substantial  departures  from  accepted  professional \njudgments: (i) medical isolation and quarantine of patients; (ii) the stall in the effort to reduce \npatient census; (iii) cross-contamination by staff; (iv) inadequate testing and virus tracking; and \n(v) failure of Hospital staff to follow basic hygienic practices.   \n12 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 18 of 46\nThe interplay among these failings—each of which is well-supported by the record and is \ndiscussed separately below—helps to explain the continued increase in COVID-19 cases at the \nHospital. \n Since the TRO was entered on April 25, the number of confirmed cases among patients \nhas continued to climb—from 46 to 79, and the number of patients who have died has doubled—\nfrom 7 to 14.12  The following chart tracks the spread of COVID-19 among Hospital patients. \n \n \nThe circumstances of the post-TRO new cases reflect that (i) the isolation and quarantine \nmeasures have not complied with critical aspects of professional standards of care—as amici have \nfound, ECF 81 at 4—leading to continued risk of exposure to patients in the “Patients Under \nInvestigation” unit, ECF 81-1 at 3; (ii) the failure to continue to take measures to reduce head \n \n12 Dist. of Columbia Dep’t of Human Servs., Human Services Agency COVID-19 Case Data, \nhttps://coronavirus.dc.gov/page/human-services-agency-covid-19-case-data (last accessed May 11, 2020). \n13 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 19 of 46\ncount, which undermines the effectiveness of other preventive measures, ECF 81-1 at 1-2; see \nalso ECF 78 at 10 (Dr. Canavan’s recommendations to facilitate reductions in head count); (iii) \nthere has been potential cross-contamination by staff who work on both COVID-19 positive or \nsuspected units and other units, ECF 81 at 4; May 7 Tr. 11; (iv) Defendants failed to implement a \ncomprehensive testing regime to determine appropriate quarantine of patients in wards based on \ntheir status (positive, symptomatic/suspected, exposed, or otherwise) and otherwise track the virus \nspread, ECF 81 at 3-4 & ECF 81-1 at 5-7; and (v) preventive hygienic measures have been \ninsufficient, May 7 Tr. 30, 34; ECF 81 at 6 (“hand hygiene audit data . . . revealed compliance to \nbe <80%,” ongoing use of non-alcohol sanitizer).  In particular, since the TRO was entered: \n•  On April 30, Defendants reported new cases from individuals who had been \nhoused in the TLC unit, which is a makeshift unit converted from a classroom.  \nThis unit had been considered COVID-negative.  When testing occurred, 12 of the \n17 patients tested positive.  ECF 66. \n \n•  On May 7, amici reported learning of two new positive cases from Unit 1D, a unit \nthat previously had no known exposure.  May 7 Tr. 4.  This unit had a “quarantine \nperiod that ended April 29, 2020” and the positive cases “represent[ed] new \ntransmission without a defined exposure.”  ECF 81 at 4.  Thus amici had reason to \nbelieve that the exposed individuals “may very well have been infected by staff \nand not by other patients.” May 7 Tr. 11.   \n \n•  On May 8, Defendants reported 4 new cases from Unit 1G.  Again, there had not \nbeen prior cases on this unit.  Amici have identified a potential source of exposure \nas Hospital staff (“a behavioral health technician”) who worked on the unit on May \n4, and has subsequently tested positive.  ECF 81 at 4. \n \n•  The fact that patients on the “PUI” unit “whose test results are negative are \nreturned to the unit from which they were placed on PUI status” was also identified \nas a problem because such individuals may be “exposed” while in PUI and then \ninfect their prior unit.  ECF 81-1 at 3-4.   \n \n•  Head count has not dropped appreciably since entry of the TRO.  Based on \nDefendants’  census  data,  there  were  200  patients  on  April  29  (the first  day \n14 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 20 of 46\nreported), and 193 on May 13 (the latest day reported).13  Amici noted that the \nnumber of discharges “has decreased notably since the middle of April,” ECF 78 \nat 9. \n \nBecause of their likely contribution to continued spread of the disease in recent days and \nbecause of the Hospital’s failure to comply with CDC standards, each of the five conditions \nPlaintiffs have identified warrants continued injunctive relief, including both continuation of the \nrelevant provisions of the TRO through the end of the COVID-19 crisis, and expansion of the \nconditions to comply with the recommendations of amici. \n(i)    The  Hospital’s  Isolation  and  Quarantine  Policies:    Defendants  have  failed  to \nadequately isolate or quarantine patients, thus exposing them to an increased risk of contracting \nCOVID-19.  Prior to the filing of this suit, the Hospital was housing individuals with COVID-19 \nsymptoms together with non-symptomatic individuals.  Costa Decl. (ECF 39-6) ¶ 6; Dunbar Decl. \n(ECF 39-7) ¶¶ 5(a-b), 6; Tu Decl. (ECF 42-5) ¶¶ 7-8; April 20 Tr. 30; Murphy Decl. ¶ 4.  In and \nof itself, the Hospital’s failure to isolate and quarantine individuals with the virus or suspected of \nhaving the virus violated Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.  Cf. Helling, 509 U.S. at 34 (exposing \nindividuals to “infectious maladies” violates the Eighth Amendment).  Indeed, it was through \nDefendants’ practices of housing exposed and symptomatic individuals together that Plaintiff \nDunbar, who had tested negative for COVID-19 as recently as March 18, tested positive on April \n24.  4/24 Tr. 3-5;  see also Dunbar Decl. (ECF 39-7) ¶¶ 5(a) (noting that he had been housed with \nfour individuals who tested positive, two of whom remained on the unit after receiving positive \ntests), Dunbar 2nd Decl. ¶¶ 3-5. \n \n13 Defendants’ reporting of the census numbers does not include patients who have been admitted to area hospitals.  \nDefendants have reported seven fatalities and two new admissions since the TRO was entered.  Defendants also \nreported 5 releases on May 13. \n15 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 21 of 46\nDespite clear guidance from the CDC, Defendants only started a practice of “treating all \nunits as quarantined” after the TRO motion was filed. ECF 59 at 13.  As the Court noted in \nentering the TRO, even as revised, the Defendants’ practices still did “not satisfy CDC standards.”  \nId. (noting record evidence that “the Hospital has taken a less demanding approach [than the CDC \nrecommends] to enforce social distancing and mask use, that common areas are open, and that \npatients are not remaining in their rooms to the extent practicable.”).    \nAs amici note, there is considerable evidence that Defendants are still not satisfying CDC \nstandards for separating known, symptomatic, and exposed patients.  ECF 81 at 4.  One basis for \nthe TRO was Defendants’ failure to follow CDC guidance regarding quarantine, ECF 59 at 13-\n14, and as Dr. Waldman summarized on May 7, the Hospital’s efforts to quarantine and group \nindividuals with similar status even after the TRO had been executed “obviously imperfectly.”  \nMay 7 Tr. 8.   \n(ii)  Persistent  Patient  Head  Count  and  “Ready  to  Discharge”  List:  CDC  guidance \nrecommends measures to reduce the population of congregate settings,14 and amici emphasize \nthat reduction of the number of patients is important because “one of the best ways to continue to \nmove toward the elimination of the SARS-CoV-2 from the environment is to reduce the number \nof potential hosts.  This would allow for physical distancing to be practiced to a much more \n \n14 See, e.g., CTRS. DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION, Coronavirus Disease 2019, Interim Infection Prevention and \nControl Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Health Care \nSettings, ECF 54-1 (“If hospitalization is not medically necessary, home care is preferable if the individual’s \nsituation allows”); CTRS. DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION, Coronavirus Disease 2019, Preparing for COVID-19: \nLong-Term Care Facilities, Nursing Homes, ECF 55-1 (if “a facility cannot fully implement all recommended \ninfection control precautions, residents [with known or suspected COVID-19] should be transferred to another \nfacility that is capable of implementation”); CTRS.

They \ntherefore urge the Hospital to “reduce patient census to the extent possible,” ECF 81-1 at 1, and \nhave recommended specific measures to facilitate discharge.  ECF 78 at 10. \nAmici noted that the Hospital had released 57 patients since mid-March, which was a \n“significant accomplishment.”  ECF 78 at 9; ECF 81 at 3-4. But many of these patients were \nreleased only pursuant to court order and not because of the Defendants’ own initiative.  See Ex. \n6 (Superior Court May 8 Order).15 Consistent with this, amici noted, that the number of discharges \n“has decreased noticeably since the middle of April,” ECF 78 at 9, and that as of May 6, “there \nwere 56 individuals in care on [the] ‘ready to discharge’ list.”  ECF 78 at 8.16   \nAmici have recommended a number of concrete steps to reduce the patient census. ECF \n78 at 10 (including facilitating discharge planning meeting, subsidizing housing providers, and \neducating community providers); see also Ex. 7, Third Declaration of Elizabeth Jones (“Jones 3rd \nDecl.”) ¶¶ 8-11.  As part of preliminary injunctive relief, the Court should order Defendants to \nperiodically report on whether they are following these recommendations and their efforts to \nfurther reduce the patient census. Jones 3rd Decl. ¶11(b).   \n \n15The Order states in relevant part: “At the time of PDS’ initial filing one month ago, the Department of Behavioral \nHealth reported 45 individuals at St. Elizabeths Hospital held in competence proceedings on misdemeanor charges \nas well as 12 individuals held at the D.C. Jail in competence proceedings on misdemeanor charges. Since then, the \nCourt has released six individuals based on the pleadings submitted and held approximately 40 hearings where the \nUnited States government, Department of Behavioral Health and Department of Corrections were present – the latter \nin the cases in which defendants were incarcerated at the jail. As of today, of the original 57 misdemeanant \ndefendants who were incarcerated at either Saint Elizabeths Hospital or the jail, only eleven individuals are held. Of \nthose eleven, the requests of two who sought release were denied while the remaining nine, through defense counsel, \nrepresented that they no longer sought release. Of that group of eleven, nine are held at St. Elizabeths Hospital and \ntwo are held at the D.C. Jail.” \n16 On May 13, Defendants reported that they had released five patients (one conditionally). \n17 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 23 of 46\n(iii) Contamination and Cross-contamination Risk from Staff:  Prior to the COVID crisis, \nmany Hospital staff worked with patients on multiple units, and that continued to be the case as of \nthe amici’s report on May 11.  As the Court found, that is inconsistent with CDC Guidance, ECF \n82 at 7-8, which provides that when a facility “dedicates space in the facility to care for residents \nwith confirmed COVID-19” it should “assign dedicated [health care providers] to work only in \nthis area of the facility.”17   \nAs the Court has noted, “amici emphasize that infection control requires reducing ‘traffic \nwithin the hospital” and “were ‘emphatic in saying that while in the past this has not been \nrespected, there should be no mixing of staff between these units,” and that “amici posit that staff \nis the most likely source of continued infection spread at Saint Elizabeths.”  ECF 82 at 7. Amici \nhave recommended that “HCP and other staff should be assigned daily to only one unit.” ECF 81-\n1 at 5; see also ECF 81 at 8 (“contractual nursing and environmental services staff be assigned to \none unit consistently, if possible.”). As Dr. Waldman explained on May 7, the Hospital’s failure \nto implement this Guidance is a critical route through which the virus has spread through the \nfacility and “Staff really needs to – we need to pay a lot more attention to it.”  May 7 Tr. 10-14. \nAs amici elaborated in their report: “The greatest impediment to interrupting transmission \nof virus within the facility is the re-introduction of virus from the outside community . . . The \nhospital has established acceptable daily screening procedure for all visitors and staff . . . but the \npresence of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers of the virus can easily go undetected.”  ECF \n \n17 CTRS. DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION, Coronavirus Disease 2019 Nursing Homes & Long-Term Care \nFacilities, ECF 55-2; see also Ex. 3 (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Covid19:  \nInterim Considerations for State Psychiatric Hospitals, at 2)2.b https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/covid19-\ninterim-considerations-for-state-psychiatric-hospitals.pdf). \n18 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 24 of 46\n81-1 at 5.  Consistent with this observation, since the original TRO was entered, the number of \npositive cases among Hospital staff has increased from 69 to 84, as illustrated in the chart below. \n \n \nIn extending the TRO, the Court ordered the relief recommended by amici—that “to the extent \nmedically and psychiatrically practicable, health care personnel and other staff shall be assigned \nto only one unit.”  ECF 83 ¶ 3.  In entering preliminary injunctive relief, the Court should extend \nthese conditions through the duration of the COVID-19 crisis. \n(iv) Inadequate Testing: Prior to the TRO motion, the Hospital was not timely or routinely \ntesting patients with COVID-19 symptoms, or individuals who had been exposed to COVID-19.  \nCosta Decl. (ECF 39-6) ¶ 13; Dunbar Decl. (ECF 39-7) ¶ 8; Smith Decl. (ECF 39-8) ¶¶ 8, 11; Tu \nDec. (ECF 42-5) ¶ 11; 4/22 Tr. 52-53.  For example, as amici note, it took the Hospital 12 days \n(from March 20 to April 1) to test and receive results for the first suspected case of COVID-19.  \nECF 81 at 3.  After the TRO motion was filed, the Hospital announced that it had received certain \n19 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 25 of 46\ntesting units and planned to test the entire patient population, Apr. 22 Tr. 31, 32, Apr. 24 Tr. 18-\n19, but subject to the “policy of ‘immediately’ returning patients suspected of having the virus to \nthe general population after a single negative test result”; as the Court has previously noted, that \npolicy is “contrary to accepted professional standards,”  ECF 59 at 14-16, and ordered that \nDefendants conduct “clinical evaluations prior to releasing patients suspected of having COVID-\n19 (i.e., symptomatic patients) from isolation, and if ‘a higher clinical suspicion’ for COVID-19 \nexists, [to] administer test-based criteria of two negative tests, at least 24 hours apart, prior to \ndiscontinuing isolation.”  ECF 60 ¶ 1.  That order should be continued. \nSince  the  Court  ordered  this  relief,  there  have  been  two  important  disclosures  by \nDefendants concerning the scope of testing that indicate testing has not been universal.  First, \nduring the May 7 call, amici reported that “there was not testing internally at the facility of any \nstaff.”  May 7 Tr. 21.  Second, on May 8, Defendants advised Plaintiffs for the first time that they \nhad not tested all patients, and that slightly over 10 percent of the patient population (21 patients) \nhad refused to be tested.  ECF 81 at 4.  Plaintiffs have a pending information request with the \nDefendants since May 10 on where these individuals are housed and what preventive measures \nhave been taken, and may raise additional issues when this information is provided. \nBeyond these issues, amici have concluded that the testing regimen adopted by Defendants \ndoes not comply with CDC guidance and is inadequate to protect the patient population.  The CDC \nguidance for nursing homes states that “the first step of a test-based prevention strategy should \nideally be a point prevalence survey (PPS) of all residents and all HCP in the facility.”18  However, \n \n18 CTRS. DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION, Coronavirus Disease 2019, Testing for Coronavirus in Nursing Homes, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/nursing-homes-testing.html. \n20 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 26 of 46\nas amici note, Defendants did not conduct widespread testing until May 4-5, ECF 81 at 4, and that \ntesting was not a point prevalence survey, because it did not cover patients in the two non-\nquarantine “clear” units (2A and 2B), or Hospital staff.  ECF 81 at 4. \nThe  Court  has  now  acted,  in  part,  upon  amici’s  recommendation,  by  ordering  the \nDefendants to complete a baseline point prevalence survey by May 15 for staff and residents, and \na second survey by May 22.  ECF 83 ¶ 4.  This decision was warranted.  As Dr. Waldman stated \nthere needs to be “a much, much more aggressive testing strategy than has currently been in place \n. . . we’re not just starting now, we’re inheriting a situation that’s been allowed to develop to where \nit is at this point.”  May 7 Tr. 11-12; see also May 7 Tr. 22 (Ms. Hebden: “it would be ideal to sort \nof start from ground zero with . . . the point prevalence survey”).  \nAmici’s recommendation went further to provide that the Court should order, beyond an \ninitial re-test, “repeat testing of all patients and staff who have negative test results no later than \none week after the initial test.”  ECF 81 at 9; see also ECF 81-1 at 6; ECF 83 ¶.  In conjunction \nwith ordering further injunctive relief, the Court should add this condition and extend it through \nthe duration of the COVID-19 crisis. \nAmici also recommend changes to the Hospital’s testing protocols for the quarantine units \n(that testing “be done on a weekly basis until no patients have positive test results.  After all \npatients have tested negative ... a second test should be conducted 72 hours later”).  ECF 81-1 at \n3.   And amici recommend renewed focus on the “patients who refuse testing.” ECF 81-1 at 7.  As \nnoted above, once Defendants furnish the requested information for the patients who have refused \ntesting, Plaintiffs may seek further relief regarding this population. \n21 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 27 of 46\n(v)  Failure of Hospital Staff to Follow Basic Infection Control Practices: Prior to filing the \nTRO, the Hospital’s use of masks and other PPE was intermittent, as was direction to engage in \n“social distancing.” As the Court noted, “Plaintiffs have offered ample evidence that the Hospital \nhas taken a less demanding approach to enforcing social distancing and mask use, that common \nspaces are open, and that patients are not remaining in their rooms to the extent practicable.”  ECF \n59 at 13. Amici reported some progress on these measures. May 7 Tr. 26.  But amici also warned \nabout several troubling aspects of the implementation of infection control: \n•  Ms. Hebden stated that there was a “concern about how [masks are] being reused, \nbecause I think they represent a higher risk, a contamination risk potentially . . . \nthey have been putting them in a paper bag, and then they’re reusing them until \nthey’re damaged or soiled.  Well, that is not in accordance with what the reuse of \nN95s would be as dictated by the CDC.” May 7 Tr. 30, 34.  The CDC guidance \nprovides that when masks are reused there should be “a minimum of five days \nbetween each use.”19 \n \n•  Ms. Hebden also stated that “we really have to up the hand hygiene of all the \npatients, particularly the patients on the COVID unit.”  Noting that “the COVID \nunits do not have individual bathrooms,” she commented that “the bathrooms are \nnot being cleaned every single time that a patient goes in there.”  May 7 Tr. 38. \n \n•  Amici  noted  that  the  “hand  hygiene  audit  data  provided  to  amici  revealed \ncompliance to be <80%.”  ECF 81 at 6.  As Ms. Hebden observed, “I don’t think \ntheir hand hygiene data I’ve seen is as good as it should be for the staff. . . I’m \nrecommending there should be a use of a CDC observational tool for hand hygiene, \nwhich they can modify for their purposes.”  May 7 Tr. 42.   \n \n•  Amici also recommended the “removal of all non-alcohol sanitizer form [sic] the \nbuilding entry and patient units.”  ECF 81 at 6.  The CDC specifically recommends \nuse of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, warning that it “does not have a recommended \nalternative  to  hand  rub  products  with  greater  than  60%  ethanol  or  70% \nisopropanol.”20 \n \n19 CTRS.

In just under two months, there are already 163 confirmed cases of COVID-\n19 at the Hospital—84 staff and 79 patients. And, indeed, Plaintiff Dunbar has contracted the disease.   \nThis risk is intolerable. Cf. Helling, 509 U.S. at 36 (asking “whether society considers the \nrisk that the prisoner complains of to be so grave that it violates contemporary standards of decency \nto expose anyone unwillingly to such a risk.”). The available data from the CDC show that of \nAmericans generally who tested positive for COVID-19, nearly a third require hospitalization, \nmany of those require admission to the ICU, and between 1.8 and 3.4 percent of people die. From \na clinical and public health perspective, COVID-19 poses a risk of serious harm to anyone who \ncontracts it. Dr. Golob explains that this severe risk extends not only to the elderly, but to “younger \nand healthier people” for whom “infection of this virus requires supportive care, which includes \nsupplemental  oxygen,  positive  pressure  ventilation,  and  in  extreme  cases,  extracorporeal \nmechanical oxygenation.”  Golob Decl. (ECF 39-4) ¶ 5. \nThe very failures of Defendants in this case have been found to constitute deliberate \nindifference—a more stringent requirement than Plaintiffs need to meet—in like cases. For \ninstance, in Feliciano v. Gonzales, 13 F. Supp. 2d 151 (D.P.R. 1998), the Court found that the \ndefendant’s “inability . . . to properly isolate cases of active tuberculosis,” the “insufficient \n23 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 29 of 46\nmedical dormitory beds,” the failure to “fully screen incoming inmates,” and the failure to \n“provide for a sick call system that ensures access to care and that is capable of effectively \nhandling emergencies” constituted deliberate indifference. Id. at 208–09. In other cases, the \ndefendant’s inability to “adequately quarantine or remove inmates and support personnel known \nto have active tuberculosis” was found to constitute deliberate indifference. See Shimon v. Dep’t \nof Corr. Servs. for N.Y., No. 93-cv-3144 (DC), 1996 WL 15688 at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 17, 1996). \nAnd in Joy v. Healthcare CMS, 534 F. Supp. 2d 482 (D. Del. 2008), the Court found that the \nplaintiffs stated a claim under the Eighth Amendment where the warden “was aware that inmates \nwere  not  thoroughly  screened  for  disease  before  going  into  general  population  and  that \nCorrectional Medical Services does not have a policy in place to examine inmates before placing \nthem  into  general  population.”  Id.  at  485.  As  discussed  above,  the  record  is  replete  with \nDefendants’ failure to meet professional standards in a wide swath of areas, including their failed \nquarantine policy, failure to properly isolate staff, and ineffective screening procedures. \nDefendants’ failure to protect Plaintiffs and the objective unreasonableness of their conduct \ncan also be shown by reference to their failure to follow accepted standards.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. \nat 321-22.  The Court in Hernandez v. County of Monterey, 110 F. Supp. 3d 929 (N.D. Cal. 2015), \nexplained that “known noncompliance with generally accepted guidelines for inmate health strongly \nindicates deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm.” Id. at 943. Here, amici’s \nfindings make clear that Defendants are out of compliance in critical categories of the CDC \nguidelines for prevention and management of COVID-19 infection, including screening and \ntesting policies, social distancing requirements, medical isolation and quarantine protocols, and \nhygiene practices.  That Defendants efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 could qualify as \n24 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 30 of 46\ndeliberate indifference leaves no doubt that Plaintiffs are likely to carry their lesser burden of \nshowing that Defendants’ approach substantially departed from accepted  professional judgment.   \nb.  The  Defendants  Have  Substantially  Departed  from  Accepted \nProfessional Judgment in Their Provision of Mental Health Care  \n \nAs amicus Dr. Patrick Canavan reported, the COVID outbreak “has changed the lives of \nevery individual in care at the Hospital. Connections to staff and other individuals have been \nbroken, they have lost peers to the virus and they must manage their anxiety without the benefit \nof many therapies upon which they were dependent. The effect on these individuals will likely be \nlong lasting and the Hospital must be ready to address the effect for the long term.”  ECF 78 at \n27.  Patients in both units where Plaintiff Dunbar has been housed have died of COVID-19 in the \nlast few weeks, and he is scared.  Dunbar 2nd Decl. ¶14.  While Dr. Canavan commended Hospital \nstaff, he noted significant shortcomings in the provision of mental health care, particularly the \nsystemic failure to provide therapy or therapy alternatives called for in patient treatment plans and \nby the continued detention of patients who have been deemed “ready to discharge.”  \n(i)  Curtailment of Care:  Saint Elizabeths policy “requires that each individual in care have \na  current  treatment  plan,  called  the  Individual  Recovery  Plan  (IRP),  which  includes  goals, \nobjectives and interventions and which is updated at regular intervals .…  [T]he target number of \nhours of active treatment is 15-20 hours per week depending on the individual in care’s clinical \ncondition.”  ECF 78 at 5.  Saint Elizabeths’ own emergency plan provides that care should be \ncontinued as much as possible during a public health emergency.  ECF 44 Ex. A at 9-10.  This is \nconsistent with guidance.  Ex. 3 at 3 (Recommendation 4).   \n Prior to filing the TRO, each of the Plaintiffs complained about severe curtailment in their \ncare, including the closing of the Treatment Mall, suspension of group therapy, anger management \n25 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 31 of 46\nclasses, and competency restoration classes.  Smith Decl. (ECF 39-8) ¶ 10; Costa Decl. (ECF 39-\n6)¶ 9; Dunbar Decl. (ECF 39-7) ¶ 7.  Plaintiffs also noted that Defendants had not taken adequate \nsteps to compensate of the loss of this treatment, for example by using teletherapy or virtual \ntherapy. FAC ¶ 111.  Since the TRO was entered, Plaintiffs continue to report that they are not \nreceiving appropriate mental health services.  Smith 2nd Decl. ¶¶ 6-7; Costa 2nd Decl. ¶¶ 11-13 ; \nDunbar 2nd Decl. ¶¶ 15- 17.    \nAmici confirm that there has been a dramatic curtailment of mental health services.  As \nDr. Canavan wrote, “[d]ata provided by the Defendants reflecting treatment since April 1st show \na significant decrease, with fewer than 100 hours of treatment compared with the almost 6000 \nhours just two months earlier.” ECF 78 at 15.  That represents a 98% drop.  Amici observed that \nmultiple patients interviewed “reported very little, if any, treatment is occurring and that there is \nlittle for them to do on the units other than watch TV.”  Id. at 14.  Amici also noted that 90 percent \nof the treatment plans reviewed contained treatment components “that are no longer operating.”  \nECF 78 at 16.   And, they also noted that “[t]here has not been coordinated treatment delivery due \nto the administrative leadership decision . . . approximately 34 licensed, board-certified or \naccredited clinicians are currently not involved in direct care treatment but are assigned to perform \nnon-clinical  work  in  the  Hospital,”  id.  at  13,  “no  group  therapies  have  been  provided  by \nRehabilitation or TLC staff since mid-March,”  id. at 12, and that “group therapies have all but \nbeen eliminated during the COVID-19 outbreak,” id. at 19, event though they are the “linchpin” \nof treatment at the Hospital.  Id. at 11.21  Plaintiff Smith has not been able to participate in \n \n21 As Amici notes, “Group therapy is an important and proven treatment modality that provides numerous benefits \nfor participants. It helps an individual in care realize that there are other people who have similar issues and is useful \nin the development of interpersonal skills. In addition, the members of the group who have similar concerns can \nsupport each other and may offer support to address a particular problem that an Individual can use to respond \n26 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 32 of 46\nWomen’s Coping or Current Events group therapies. Smith 2nd Decl. ¶ 7. Plaintiff Costa has not \nhad access to Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Music Experience, Leisure Skills, Recreational \nEducation, Bible Study, Movement Meditations, or Anger Management. Costa 2nd Decl. ¶¶ 12-\n13. Plaintiff Dunbar has not had access to Community Training, Drug Education, Medication \nEducation, or physical education classes. Dunbar 2nd Decl. ¶¶ 16-17.    \n  Plaintiffs recognize that the crisis makes group therapy difficult; however, as amici and the \nHospital’s own policies make clear, patients must continue to receive adequate mental health \nservices, even during public health emergencies. Seven weeks into the crisis, that is still not \nhappening. As amici explain, the Hospital’s intentions to provide alternative treatment remain \nlargely unfulfilled.  EFC 78 at 17-18.  For example, Plaintiff Costa reports that the only group \ntherapy he participates in currently is Music Group, which means only that patients choose three \nsongs to listen to on YouTube in the unit lounge. Costa 2nd Decl. ¶ 13.  Equally concerning, amici \nnoted that the Hospital’s plans for “a limited telehealth program on each unit to allow for remote \ngroup  therapy”  have  “been  delayed.”    ECF  78  at  17.    Amici  also  stated  that  even  when \nimplemented, the provision of “technology provided to individuals in care” will remain “very \nlimited” with “each unit will get only one cart . . . which will significantly limit the number of \ngroups which can be held.”  Id. \nAccording to Elizabeth Jones, a psychiatric hospital administrator with over thirty years of \nexperience, the level of care described by amici “falls far short of what patients need to continue \ntheir  recovery  from  the  serious  mental  illness  that  necessitated  admission  to  a  psychiatric \n \neffectively to their own situation. It also provides a degree of socialization for individuals. It is for these reasons that \ntreatment at Saint Elizabeths has been heavily focused on group therapies. Unfortunately, group therapies have all \nbut been eliminated during the current COVID-19 outbreak.”  ECF 78 at 18. \n27 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 33 of 46\ninstitution”; and is “a clear risk to health and safety.”  The failure to provide appropriate care are \na “drastic deterrents to treatment, recovery and timely discharge; risk traumatizing patients and \nexacerbating  symptoms  of  mental  illness;  and  inevitably  will  result  in  long  lasting,  if  not \npermanent, damage to the individuals and their efforts at recovery.” Jones 3rd Decl. ¶¶ 3-4. She \nconcluded these circumstances violate professional standards of care and treatment.”  Jones 3rd \nDecl. ¶ 4. \nA facility “that deprives [persons] of basic sustenance, including adequate medical care, is \nincompatible with the concept of human dignity and has no place in civilized society.” Brown v. \nPlata, 563 U.S. 493, 510-11 (2011).  And, it is well-settled that the state must provide treatment to \nconfined individuals not convicted of a crime in accord with the purpose of confinement.  See, e.g., \nJackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 738 (1972) (\"At the least, due process requires that the nature \nand duration of commitment bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual \nis committed”).  Under Youngberg, the state must provide civilly committed individuals with, \namong other things, adequate mental health care.  See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315-16, 324.  \nInadequate mental health care will violate a due process when it “is such a substantial departure \nfrom accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate that the person \nresponsible actually did not base the decision on such judgment.”  Id. at 323.   \nHere,  Defendants’  actions  are  extraordinary  departures  from  accepted  professional \njudgment, practice, or standards, including their own guidelines and recommendations from the \nHospital’s own professionals.  Amici note that the Hospital policy is to implement treatment plans, \nknown  as  Individualized  Recovery  Plans  or  IRPs,and  to  provide  15-20  hours  per  week  of \ntherapeutic services.  ECF 78 at 5.  As early as late March, the “TLC and Rehabilitation Services \n28 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 34 of 46\n[staff] developed schedules for on-unit programming to begin . . . with limited and identified staff \nwho would be dedicated to a particular unit, but that plan was not approved by the Hospital \nadministrative leaders and, as a result, no group therapies have been provided by Rehabilitation \nor TLC staff since mid-March.”  ECF 78 at 12. Defendants are failing to provide treatment in \naccordance with the IRPs and, in fact, are barely providing any treatment at all.  ECF 78 at 15-\n17;  see also Smith Decl. (ECF 39-8) ¶ 10; Costa Decl. (39-6) ¶ 9; Dunbar Decl. ¶ 7; Smith 2nd \nDecl. ¶¶ 6-7, 11; Costa 2nd Decl. ¶¶ 11-13; Dunbar 2nd Decl. ¶¶ 15-17.   The Therapeutic \nLearning Centers, which are the “linchpin of the Hospital treatment delivery,” ECF 78 at 12, are \nclosed, and Defendants are failing to provide alternative services appropriate for the COVID-19 \ncrisis.  Id.   \nThe curtailment of mental health treatment is not the result of professional judgment about \nthe care Plaintiffs need, but rather the result of blanket closures of treatment areas and suspension \nof in-person therapy.  See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 323.  There is nothing in the extensive record \nindicating that Defendants exercised professional judgment to determine that the 200 individuals \ncommitted to the District for intensive psychiatric treatment all of a sudden needed almost no \nservices.  In fact, Defendants have failed to follow the professional judgment of the Hospital’s \ntreatment team, which recommended as early as late March a plan to provide comprehensive \nservices to patients in their unit.  ECF 78 at 12.   The clinical staff and treatment teams have not \nupdated patients’ treatment plans to account for the effect of the COVID-19 crisis.  ECF 78 at 16.  \nIndeed, as Elizabeth Jones states, “patients simply are not receiving the services that their \ntreatment teams determined were essential for recovery and acceptable alternative strategies have \nnot  been  substituted.”   Jones  3rd  Decl. ¶  5.   Even  in  light  of  the  COVID-19  emergency, \n29 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 35 of 46\nDefendant’s own policies and professional standards require an individualized assessment of the \ncare patients need and a strategy for administering that care during the crisis. Defendant’s own \nemergency plan prioritizes the delivery of services during the crisis. ECF 44 Ex. A.   The failure \nto provide adequate mental health services is no doubt a departure from professional judgment.  \nSee Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 323. \n(ii)  Patient Head Count and “Ready to Discharge”: As discussed above, the failure to \nreduce the patient census to the greatest extent possible has placed patients at a substantial and \nunconstitutional risk of contracting COVID-19.  Where, as here, an individual is institutionalized \nin  a  dangerous  environment  and essential mental health care is not provided, the balance of \nconsiderations must shift in favor of community-based and integrated treatment options. See, e.g., \nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 317 (person in custody has a constitutional right to treatment); O’Connor \nv. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563 (1975) (confining a person with mental illness who is no longer a threat \nto himself or others is unconstitutional even if the State seeks to protect the person from less \ndesirable  living  conditions).  The  Defendants  have  identified  patients  ready  for  community \nplacement. ECF 78; Ex. 8, Second Declaration of Wanda Rose (“Rose 2nd Decl.”) ¶ 6.  Given the \nrisks during the COVID-19 pandemic, keeping patients in the Hospital when the very treatment \nthey were institutionalized to receive, intensive inpatient psychiatric care, is not taking place, is \nobjectively unreasonable, fail to ensure plaintiffs’ reasonable safety, and therefore violate due \nprocess. \nThe continued hospitalization of patients ready for release also violates their rights under \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act.  As Dr. Canavan notes, discharge planning for patients \nshould be an ongoing focus of treatment.  ECF 78 at 6.  The Hospital maintains a “ready for \n30 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 36 of 46\ndischarge list” of patients for whom “the treatment team determined that the individual had \nprogressed sufficiently such that the treatment team could identify the level of care and housing \nneeds for the individual when discharged.”  ECF 78 at 7.  As of May 6, “there were 56 individuals \nin care on [the] ‘ready to discharge’ list,”  ECF 78 at 7, but Defendants have substantially reduced \ntheir efforts at discharge planning and execution.  ECF 78 at 8-9. \nThe ADA requires that persons with disabilities be provided services in the least restrictive \n \nsetting consistent with their needs. 28 CFR § 35.130(d). Confinement in an institution is justified \nonly where it is essential to meet the person’s treatment needs and there is no appropriate \ncommunity setting. Brown v. District of Columbia, 928 F.3d 1070, 1077 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (citing \nOlmstead v. LC by Zimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999)). ADA regulations require that “[a] public entity \nshall administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the \nneeds of qualified individuals with disabilities.” 28 CFR § 35.130(d). \nDefendants must serve persons with disabilities in community settings where it has been \ndetermined that community placement is appropriate and the transfer from institutional care to a \nless restrictive setting is not opposed by the individual patient. Brown, 928 F.3d at 587.  Defendants \nmay  rely  on  reasonable  assessments  of  their  own  professionals  in  determining  whether  an \nindividual “meets the essential eligibility requirements” for habilitation in a community-based \nprogram. Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 602.  While the government treating professional is not the sole \ngatekeeper of  whether a person  is in the most integrated setting,22  for  the  purposes  of this \n \n22 See, M.J. v. District of Columbia, 401 F. Supp. 3d 1, 12 (D.D.C. 2019) (because Olmstead “did not state that a \ndetermination by a State’s own professionals is the only way that a plaintiff may establish” community placement is \nwarranted) (citing Steimel v. Wernert, 823 F.3d 902, 915-16 (7th Cir. 2016) (whether community based treatment was \nappropriate could be demonstrated by allegations that the state had previously allowed plaintiffs more community \ninteraction). \n31 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 37 of 46\npreliminary  injunction,  external  evaluations  are  not  necessary.    The  Defendants’  treating \nprofessionals have determined that at least 56 patients at Saint Elizabeths “mee[t] the essential \neligibility requirements,” Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 602, for community placement by placing them \non the “ready to discharge list.”  ECF 78 at 7.  With rigorous and regular assessment, many others \nmay be added to the “ready to discharge” list or may show their eligibility to receive community-\nbased services in other ways.  See Jones 3rd Declaration ¶¶ 8- 10.  Defendants have failed to meet \ntheir obligations under the ADA to facilitate community placement for these eligible individuals; \namici  report  that  the  Defendants  have  largely  stopped  discharge  planning  with  community \nproviders and have not appropriately modified their discharge practices to respond to the COVID-\n19 outbreak.  ECF 78 at 7-10; Rose 2nd Decl. ¶ 6.   \nThe  housing  barriers  described  by  Defendants  to  amici  to  explain  the  backlog  in \ncommunity placements is insufficient to overcome Defendants’ ADA obligations. See Brown, 928 \nF.3d at 1070.23  Amici’s recommendations to modify the District’s program to increase the \ncommunity  placement  of  patients  ready  for  release  provide  initial  steps  the  District  can \nimmediately take to address the barriers to community placement: \n# 1: The DBH should immediately begin a program to educate community \nproviders about COVID-19 to calm fears over housing or serving Saint Elizabeths \nindividuals.  \n \n# 2: Hospital staff and DBH staff should immediately restart meeting twice a \nweek via video conferencing to review and update the “ready for discharge” list \nand address any new barriers that have been highlighted because of COVID-19, \n \n23 The burden is on the Defendants to show that a requested accommodation of community placement is \nunreasonable, even if it requires the modification of its programs or services.  It is notable that amici concluded that \n“there also have been fewer placements for individuals in care going to their own apartments since the COVID-19 \noutbreak as landlords tell social workers that they are leery of accepting referrals from Saint Elizabeths.” ECF 78 at \n9. Rose 2nd Decl. ¶ 6.  The refusal to rent to a person because of their disability is a clear violation of the District \nHuman Rights Act. D Code § 2-1402.21(a).  The Defendants cannot justify their inability to create a community \nplacement based on the illegal conduct of landlords and the District’s failure to enforce its human rights laws.   \n32 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 38 of 46\nso DBH can engage community providers and identify strategies to mitigate \nconcerns.  \n \n# 3: DBH should provide a short-term subsidy or other supports to providers who \naccept individuals from Saint Elizabeths in the near future.  \n \n# 4: DBH should expand housing options for older individuals in care or those \nwho need higher levels of care such as nursing home or intensive residence, as \nwell as individuals who have suffered from COVID-19 who may experience \nlingering effects and thus may be in need of more intensive community supports. \n \nECF 78 at 7-9.  See also Jones 3rd Decl. ¶ 11(b).   \nPut  simply,  failing  to  develop  and  implement  a  plan  to  facilitate  the  discharge  and \ncommunity placement of patients whom Defendants deem “ready to discharge” violates the ADA.    \n2.  Plaintiffs Will Suffer Irreparable Harm Unless Defendants Are Enjoined from \nFollowing a Policy that Will Allow them to be Housed in Unconstitutional \nConditions in the Future \n \nIn entering the TRO, this Court concluded that “Plaintiffs have satisfied the irreparable \nharm requirement for issuance of a temporary restraining order.”  ECF 59 at 17.  This remains the \ncase for the issuance of a preliminary injunction for two reasons. \nFirst, for the reasons described above, Plaintiffs’ constitutional and statutory rights are still \nbeing violated, and nothing more is needed to prove irreparable harm, because the deprivation of \nconstitutional  rights,  “for  even  minimal  periods  of  time,  unquestionably \nconstitutes irreparable injury.”  Mills v. District of Columbia, 571 F.3d 1304, 1312 (D.C. Cir. \n2009); see generally Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 511 (2011) (“Courts . . . must not shrink from \ntheir obligation to enforce the constitutional rights of . . . prisoners.” (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted)).   \nSecond, as the Court noted, “the imminent risk to [Plaintiffs] health . . . also constitutes an \nirreparable injury.”  ECF  59 at 16-17. Plaintiffs are individuals with serious mental illnesses, \n33 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 39 of 46\ninvoluntarily housed in a psychiatric hospital.  During the pandemic, they have been unnecessarily \nexposed to the coronavirus without adequate means to protect themselves, and Plaintiff Dunbar \nhas tested positive.  4/24 Tr. 3-5.  In addition to the physical risks of COVID-19 exposure, every \nday, Plaintiffs are being deprived of the mental health care that is the purpose of their commitment \nto the hospital.  Amici observe that the curtailment of mental health care at Saint Elizabeths has \nchanged the lives of patients at the Hospital for the worse:  “Connections to staff and other \nindividuals have been broken, they have lost peers to the virus and they must manage their anxiety \nwithout the benefit of many therapies upon which they were dependent. The effect on these \nindividuals will likely be long lasting[.]”  ECF 78 at 27.  See also Jones 3rd Decl. ¶ 4. \nWhile Defendants have taken measures to reduce these risks, the Hospital “continues to \nexperience ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.”  ECF 81 at 2.  Even if Defendants had \nsuccessfully eliminated these risks—which they have not—the “court’s power to grant injunctive \nrelief survives discontinuance of the illegal conduct, and because the purpose is to prevent future \nviolations, injunctive relief is appropriate when there is a cognizable danger of recurrent violation.”  \nU.S. Dep’t of Justice v. Daniel Chapter One, 89 F. Supp. 3d 132, 143 (D.D.C. 2015) (quoting \nUnited States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629 (1953)), aff’d, 650 F. App’x 20 (D.C. Cir. 2016); \ncf. Gray Panthers Project Fund v. Thompson, 273 F. Supp. 2d 32, 34 (D.D.C. 2002) (issuing \npermanent injunction even though the defendant acted “in compliance with the court’s preliminary \ninjunction”). \nIndeed, courts around the country considering substandard detention conditions in light of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic have recognized that temporary orders must be extended to prevent \nbacksliding. See, e.g., Mays v. Dart, Case No. 20 C 2134, 2020 WL 1987007 at *29 (N.D. Ill. Apr. \n34 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 40 of 46\n27, 2020) (converting TRO requiring improved response to COVID-19 at detention facility into \npreliminary injunction; court reasoned that “[a]lthough the Sheriff appears to have complied with \nthe TRO . . . there is at least a possibility that [the Sheriff’s actions] could slip to the wayside \ndespite the Sheriff’s best intentions, as he works to manage the complexities of the Jail during this \npublic health crisis”). \nGiven the continued spread of the virus at the Hospital and Defendants’ repeated failure to \nadhere to CDC guidance and their own policies, injunctive relief to protect the patients from risks \nof COVID-19 exposure and the deprivation of mental health care is not only warranted but \nindispensable. \n3.   Enjoining  Defendants  from  Failing  to  House  and  Treat  Involuntarily \nCommitted  Persons  in  Constitutionally  Adequate  Conditions  Will  Not \nSubstantially Injure Defendants or Others.  \n \nA preliminary injunction would impose no measurable harm on Defendants or third parties. \nWhen a government entity involuntarily commits persons to its custody, it has an obligation to \nprovide for their essential needs and to protect them from danger.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324 \n(1982).  Defendants are not harmed by meeting this obligation; in fact, Defendants have no legal \nright to confine Plaintiffs and others where they are exposed to a dangerous and life-threatening \nrisk.  \nNor  would  Defendants  be  harmed  by  an  order  requiring  them  to  comply  with  the \nintegration mandate under the ADA and facilitate community-based services for all patients who \nare  eligible  for  discharge.    Indeed,  it  is  Defendants’  affirmative  obligation  to  do  so  when \ncircumstances exist such that the isolation of individuals with disabilities is no longer justified.   \n35 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 41 of 46\n4.      A Preliminary Injunction  Will Serve the Public Interest.   \nAs noted above, the public interest is served when constitutional and statutory rights are \nprotected. ECF 59 at 17; Simms, 872 F. Supp. 2d at 105; accord Lamprecht v. F.C.C., 958 F.2d \n382, 390 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (“a [government] policy that is unconstitutional would inherently \nconflict with the public interest”).  Here, the public interest would be vindicated by honoring \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional and statutory rights and restoring basic standards of decency to the \ntreatment of Plaintiffs and other patients at the Hospital. And, as long as departing residents are \nheld in appropriate isolation, the risk to public health is much greater keeping them at Saint \nElizabeths than transferring them elsewhere or letting them out. \nREQUESTED REMEDY  \nThe Court should order injunctive relief of two sorts.  First, it should order the Defendants \nto follow professional public health standards for controlling the spread of COVID-19 at Saint \nElizabeths Hospital, including proper housing and infection control measures for patients, and \nincluding significantly reducing the patient population at the Hospital.  Second, it should enjoin \nDefendants  from  further  damaging  Plaintiffs’  mental  health  by  failing  to  provide  essential \ntreatment.  Amici have provided the Court with concrete, specific recommendations about what \nshould be ordered, tied to professional standards and based on their undisputed expertise.  ECF 78, \n81, 81-1.   \nAlthough the basis for Defendants’ constitutional violation is their failure to adhere to \nprofessional standards, and Plaintiffs request relief primarily aimed at rectifying those violations, \nthis Court may order more than mere compliance with CDC and other relevant professional \nstanards, because, “[o]nce invoked, the scope of a district court’s equitable powers ... is broad, for \n36 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 42 of 46\nbreadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.” Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 687 n.9 \n(1978) (quoting Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 281 (1977)).  Indeed, in Hutto, the Supreme \nCourt approved a prophylactic remedy that required a halt to a practice that was not itself \nunconstitutional but was part of a “comprehensive” remedy to prevent future violations. See id. at \n685-87. To similar effect is Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 531-33 (2011), in which the Supreme \nCourt affirmed a downsizing remedy in order to address unconstitutional conditions caused by \novercrowding—even though the Constitution does not directly limit the number of people a state \nmay incarcerate.  \nWith these principles in mind, and with the goal of protecting Plaintiffs’ health and safety \nby bringing the Hospital’s practices into compliance with CDC and other professional standards, \nPlaintiffs request the following relief: \n1)  The incorporation of current TRO directives, ECF 83, into a preliminary injunction.  \nDefendants have failed to adhere to professional standards, and, as this Court noted, the public \nhealth crisis at the Hospital is ongoing.  ECF 82 at 6.  Even if Defendants could demonstrate full \ncompliance with the TRO, which they cannot, “good faith and conscientious compliance with the \nCourt’s order does not demonstrate that extension of the order is unwarranted.”   ECF 82 at 5. The \nCourt should extend the first five paragraphs of ECF 83, regarding the treatment of exposed \npatients, the treatment of symptomatic patients, the assignment of staff, the point prevalence \nsurvey, and data management.    \n  2)   Reduction of patient census.  Significant downsizing of Saint Elizabeths Hospital is \nthe most effective way to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 among the patients and to \nprovide mental health care in the most integrated setting appropriate for patient needs.  ECF 81, \n37 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 43 of 46\n81-1; ECF 78; Jones Second Decl. (ECF 39-2) ¶¶8-10; Stern Decl. (ECF 39-3) ¶¶ 13-15; Jones \nDecl. ¶¶ 17(a) & 17(j)(ii). To facilitate an orderly reduction consistent with the psychiatric needs \nof the patients, the Court should order Defendants to: \na.  Evaluate every patient at least every 10 days to determine if they are “ready for \ndischarge” under Hospital policies. See Jones Second Decl. (ECF 39-2) ¶ 11.   \nb.  Develop a detailed plan to ensure timely discharge from St. Elizabeths during the \nongoing COVID-19 crisis that includes specific actions to incentivize \ncommunity-based provider agencies to participate in planning and implementing \ndischarges from St. Elizabeths; the provision of technical assistance; and \nresources for problem identification and remediation as discharge plans are \nimplemented.  Jones Second Decl. (ECF 39-2) ¶ 11; ECF 78 at 10.   \nc.  Report biweekly to the Court and Plaintiffs on the results of the evaluations of \npatients for the “ready to discharge” list and the discharge of patients on the \n“ready to discharge” list.   \n3.  Provision of adequate mental health care.  All patients at Saint Elizabeths are, by \ndefinition, in need of psychiatric care.  Yet during this crisis, Defendants have ceased providing \nkey  components  of  that  care  and  are  not  systematically  providing  alternatives  that  can  be \nimplemented consistent with COVID-19 public health guidelines, such as virtual or telemedicine \nalternatives.  See generally ECF 78.  To remedy this, and in line with amici recommendations, the \nCourt should order Defendants, by date certain, to “develop - and have the capacity to implement \nimmediately - alternative methods of providing group treatments as conditions change in the short-\n, medium- and long-term that allow for reduction or tightening of social distancing.”   ECF 78; see \n38 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 44 of 46\nalso Jones Second Decl. ¶ 11.  Defendants should also be ordered by date certain to conduct \nindividual assessments of each patient, with input from the patient’s treatment team, the patient’s \nattorney, and/or other supportive decision makers as determined by the patient, to determine the \nappropriate treatment plan given the COVID-19 crisis. Jones Second Decl. ¶ 11.  Finally, the Court \nshould order that all treatment plans should be implemented with fidelity and be tracked by the \nappointed monitor (see below). Id.   \nIn addition, the Court should order that Defendants immediately procure technology \nneeded to implement patients’ treatment plans in line with Amici recommendations, including \niPads or similar devices for each patient, laptops or similar devices for each clinician who treats \npatients; and 12 additional video conferencing devices and suitable AV carts so that two different \ngroup activities can occur on each unit simultaneously.  ECF 78 at 20-21.   \n4.  Other relief.  To the extent not otherwise required by the Court’s order, the Court should \nrequire Defendants to affirmatively consider implementing all recommendations of amici.  The \nCourt should order Defendants to report to the Court within 10 days which recommendations they \nhave adopted, which they plan to adopt with a timeline for adoption, and which they reject and the \ngrounds for rejecting them.   \n5.  Independent Monitor. An Independent Monitor will be important to ensure compliance \nwith the Court’s Order. The Court should therefore appoint a Monitor, to be compensated by \nDefendants who should be authorized to conduct such factual investigations as are necessary to \nmeasure the Defendants’ efforts at compliance with the preliminary injunction and Defendants’ \nefforts  to  implement  amici  recommendations.    The  Monitor  should  be  authorized  to  have \nappropriate access to the Hospital, its patients, its staff, and its records. The Monitor should be \n39 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 45 of 46\ndirected to file weekly reports until such time as the District reaches substantial compliance with \nall of the terms of the Preliminary injunction, and to file reports every 30 days thereafter.  \n5. Reporting by the Defendants.  To permit the Court and the Plaintiffs to assess whether \nimplementation of the injunction is effectively addressing the conditions at the Hospital, the \nDefendants should be required to provide to the Court, the Independent Monitor and the Plaintiffs \na biweekly report that includes (i) the daily census of patients, (ii) the number of admissions, (iii) \nthe number of patients assessed for changes to their treatment plans, (iv) the number of patients \nrecommended for change in treatment, as well as any instance where the treatment has not been \nimplemented, (iv) the number of patients the assessment team has assessed for placement on the \n“ready to discharge” list and the results of those evaluations (v), the number of patients discharged \nfrom the Hospital and where they were discharged to; (v) for any patients remaining in the facility, \ntheir  COVID-19  status  and  their  quarantine  or  isolation  status,  and  (vii)  summaries  of  all \ncomplaints reported to the Hospital’s patient advocate. \nCONCLUSION  \n  For the foregoing reasons, the motion for preliminary injunction should be granted. \n \nDated:  May 14, 2020       Respectfully submitted, \n/s/ John A.

My name is Ieshaah Murphy. I make these statements based upon my personal \nknowledge.  \n \n2.  I am a supervising attorney in the Trial Division at the Public Defender Service for the \nDistrict of Columbia (hereinafter “PDS”) and have served in this role since February 19, \n2017. Prior to working as a supervising attorney, I was a staff attorney in the Trial \nDivision at PDS. I have worked at PDS since October of 2012. PDS is a federally funded, \nindependent organization dedicated to representing indigent adults and children accused \nof crimes in the District of Columbia. My principal responsibility as a supervising trial \nattorney at PDS is to represent people in criminal proceedings in the District of Columbia \nSuperior Court and to supervise the practice of PDS’s trial attorneys. \n \n3.  As part of my duties as an attorney at PDS, I regularly conduct legal visits and legal \nphone calls with clients in the custody of the District of Columbia’s Department of \nCorrections, both at the Central Detention Facility (“CDF”) and at the Correctional \nTreatment Facility (“CTF”) and St. Elizabeths Hospital (hereinafter “Hospital”).  \n \n4.  While conducting a legal phone call with Client A, who is currently at St. Elizabeths, I \nlearned the following:  \na.  Client A had been living on the 1G unit at the Hospital since December of 2019. \nb.  Client A moved from unit 1G to the TLC unit on May 9, 2020 after testing \npositive for COVID-19. \nc.  Client A started to feel sick at some point in mid-April, 2020. Client A had a fever \nof 99.7, body aches, chills, vomiting, and headaches. Client A repeatedly \nrequested to be tested for COVID-19, but was told that Client A could not be \ntested because Client A’s fever did not go above 101 degrees. Around this same \ntime, there were at least six other residents who were also sick and denied testing \nbecause their fevers did not rise above 101 degrees. Client A eventually began to \nrecover from this illness.  \nd.  Client A was tested for COVID-19 on May 5, 2020. While waiting for test results \nClient A interacted with residents on the unit normally. Client A used the \ncommunal bathrooms, played video games, and watched TV with other residents. \ne.  Client A received positive COVID-19 test results on May 7, 2020. \nf.  Client A was moved from 1G to the TLC unit at around midnight on May 9, 2020. \ng.  Client A was told that Client A will remain on the TLC unit until at least May 18, \n2020. Client A will be tested for COVID-19 again on May 18, 2020.  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-2   Filed 05/14/20   Page 2 of 2\nh.  Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Client A used to do physical therapy, for \nCarpal Tunnel and a prior injury, about two times a week. Client A has not been \nable to get physical therapy for about a month and a half.  \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the foregoing is true \nand correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.  \n \nExecuted on the 13th day of May 2020, in Washington, D.C.       \n               \n \n \n_______________________________ \n              Ieshaah Murphy \n              Supervising Attorney \nPublic Defender Service for DC  \n633 Indiana Ave. NW \nWashington, DC       \n   \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-3   Filed 05/14/20   Page 1 of 5\n \nCovid19:  Interim Considerations for State Psychiatric Hospitals  \nUpdated: May 8, 2020  \nIndividuals with serious mental illness, particularly those who are older or who have chronic medical \nconditions, can be at higher risk for illness with Covid-19.  It is important that mental health facilities be \nprepared for Covid-19 to keep both patients as well as healthcare staff safe, and this may include proactive \nmeasures to reduce the psychiatric disease burden caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. While SAMHSA \nhas  preferentially  recommended  outpatient  treatment  during  the  COVID-19  crisis  as  telehealth \ntechnology and social distancing can be more effectively implemented, inpatient psychiatric care will \ninevitably be required for a number of patients. Psychiatric care on an inpatient service is typically \nreserved for the most severe conditions, and inpatient care at state psychiatric hospitals is typically \nreserved for the most refractory cases. \nState psychiatric hospitals have typically developed Disaster Plans that require the establishment of \nprotocols and relationships with other local government and healthcare entities. Each accredited facility \nshould have existing infection control plans that are designed to address scenarios such as for MRSA, HIV, \nHepatitis, and infectious diseases.  Plans to manage COVID-19 at the facility should now be in place at all \nof these sites. However, in contrast to general healthcare settings, psychiatric facilities may experience \nunique challenges in prevention and infection control. \n \nIn addition to consideration of infection control guidelines with the goal of minimizing spread, described \nbelow, it is also important to be aware of the psychological impact of quarantine and major disruptions \nto everyday life.  Healthcare workers already support the mental health of their patients, but they also \nneed to attend to their own needs and those of their families. i  It is important to provide access to \naccurate information sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).ii   The \nAmerican Psychiatric Association has resources on the mental health impacts of Covid-19.iii Others also \nhave studied and reported on the adverse effects of quarantine on individuals.iv Patients at mental health \nfacilities are vulnerable both to the infection itself, but also to worsening anxiety, mood, or psychosis \nduring this time. Given the uncertainty and rapid change associated with the virus, anxiety and distress \nshould be anticipated.v  \n \nIn  response  to  the  CDC  recommendations  for  all  healthcare  facilities,  SAMHSA  offers  further \nconsiderations specific to psychiatric hospitals. \n \n1)  Reduce morbidity and mortality: \na.  Many patients admitted to state psychiatric facilities have a number of health comorbidities \nthat increase their risk of developing severe symptoms from COVID-19 infection. These \ninclude the very high incidence of tobacco use with resultant COPD and lung disease or \nmetabolic syndrome with diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.  In addition to intake \nscreening and testing when appropriate, these patients should be informed of their elevated \nrisk and frequent follow up COVID-19 screening should be performed. These patients should \nbe segregated from new or symptomatic patients due to their higher stratified risk. \nb.  SAMHSA recommends that when possible all new admissions be segregated until COVID-19 \ntesting results are available for review.  For new and existing patients, all suspected and \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-3   Filed 05/14/20   Page 2 of 5\n \n \nsymptomatic cases should be immediately segregated and transferred, if necessary, to \nappropriate healthcare facilities with capabilities of treating more severely ill patients. \nAdvanced directives should be updated on all existing patients and should be completed for \nnew patients upon admission. Psychiatric hospitals may not have the capacity to respond to \nsevere respiratory infections. \nc.  Symptoms associated with psychotic illness, such as paranoia or anxiety disorders such as \nOCD may worsen during the COVID-19 crisis, and patients with these conditions may require \nadditional redirection as they are exposed to more negative news about the pandemic.  \n2)  Considerations when attempting to minimize disease transmission: \na.  Limit the movement of COVID-19 patients (e.g., have them remain in their room)  \n1.  Capacity of informed consent may be lacking for those admitted involuntarily. Individuals \nwith serious mental illnesses may have varying degrees of capacity to follow appropriate \ninfection control procedures, therefore it is important to establish the patient’s capacity \nor lack of capacity when developing the modified COVID-19 treatment plan. Those who \nlack capacity may not fully appreciate the dangers of exposure. The nature of the \ntherapeutic milieu may make minimal contact rules more challenging.  Patients without \ncapacity may require more frequent reorientation to the rules, more activities one on one \nwith staff, and an individual room. While restrictions of movement outside of their room \nwill be implemented for some patients, the presence of mental illness does not mean an \nindividual is incapable of practicing safe hygiene and social distancing practices. Staff \nshould make the assessment based on the patient’s capacity and behavior and carefully \navoid stigmatizing those with mental illness.  \n \n2.  Take steps to prevent known or suspected COVID-19 patients from exposing other \npatients.  \na.  It is advisable when possible to segregate the areas or individual floors as non-\nCOVID-19 and COVID-19. This may require further restrictions in movement and \naccommodations should be explored. For instance, the dayroom is often the \nlocation where patients congregate and receive the therapeutic benefits of the \nmilieu. Having an alternate dayroom location, when possible, could help to \nreduce a patient’s anxiety about exposure and maintain continuity. Also, those \npatients  with  severe  anxiety  disorder  or  paranoia  may  feel  some  relief  in \nsegregation as their risk of exposure is reduced.  \nb.  Identify dedicated staff to care for COVID-19 patients.  \nc.  Psychosocial  group treatment  sessions may  have  to  be  suspended  if these \nsessions cannot be safely modified with fewer individuals reliably practicing social \ndistancing  or  with  video  technology  available.  One  on  one  psychosocial \ncounseling sessions with social distancing can be considered. \n \nb.  Another important consideration is that most psychiatric facilities have restricted access with \nlimited visitation. This is stigmatizing in itself as these units are locked for the security of the \npatients and staff. During the COVID-19 crisis, visitation by friends, family, and various \nstakeholders may be curtailed. This necessary step to reduce exposure risk can leave the \npatients feeling more isolated. When visitation is restricted staff of all levels should be aware \nof this and take steps to reach out and check on patients more often.  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-3   Filed 05/14/20   Page 3 of 5\n \n \nc.  Often  family  members  and  community  support  are  vital  components  of  the  patients’ \nrecovery. These individuals are heavily involved in the patient’s lives and have traditionally \nparticipated in family meetings and therapy. When safely implemented, this important part \nof treatment should continue. Continuing these meetings by confirmed appointment in \ndesignated area, frequently sanitized between visits, can facilitate disposition planning, \nreduce recidivism rates, and improve patient satisfaction. Such dedicated spaces could also \nbe used for visitation with a schedule and protocol for safe interaction including social \ndistancing and sanitizing after each use. Alternative steps depending on resources could \ninclude setting up a computer with a webcam and microphone in another area within the \nfacility that can be cleaned between uses. This would allow patients and family members to \ncommunicate visually as well as via audio.  \n \nd.  Post visual alerts (signs, posters) at entrances and in strategic places providing instruction on \nhand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette. For patients with limited capacity \nfrequent reorientation to these is required.  \n \ne.  Observe newly arriving patients/residents for development of respiratory symptoms in an \narea designated for new patient evaluation. \n \nf.  Confirm or obtain psychiatric advance directives to facilitate medication and treatment \ncompliance in the event of change of capacity for informed consent. \n   \n3)  Protect healthcare personnel \na.  Ensure that staff are aware of sick leave policies, and staff should be encouraged to \nstay home if they are not feeling well.  \nb.  Limit visitors to the facility and perform screening on all who enter the facility. \nc.  Ensure cleaning and disinfectant supplies are available as well as tissues, waste \nreceptacles, and alcohol-based hand sanitizer.  \nd.  Ensure housekeeping and dietary personnel frequently sanitize and disinfect all areas \nwhere staff and patients can be found.  \ne.  Healthcare  workers  may  also  develop  symptoms  of  anxiety  during  this  crisis, \ntherefore supervisors and managers should perform more frequent meetings and \nchecks with frontline staff. Flexibilities when possible should be accommodated. \nOccupational  health  departments  should  now  be  actively  engaging  staff  and \nimplementing  plans  for  staff  that  are  experiencing  greater  stress  and  anxiety. \nResources  should  be  made  available  for  staff  experiencing  increased  stress, \ndepression, or substance use disorder relapse.  \n \n4)  Preserve healthcare system functioning \na.  As staffing shortages may become more common as healthcare workers also become infected \nand are quarantined, it is important that supervisors and managers establish contact with \noutside staffing sources to ensure continuity of care. More flexibility in task assignment may \nbe an option, for instance, the ability to “buddy team” with paraprofessional staff if regular \nstaff ratios are limited due to staff illness.  \nb.  As the anxiety and fear from COVID-19 can preclude improvement in the patient’s psychiatric \ncondition, providers should instruct staff to engage patients in more one to one activities and \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-3   Filed 05/14/20   Page 4 of 5\n \n \nshould be mindful of this consideration when ordering prn medications to keep the patient \nas  comfortable  as  possible.    It  is  important  to  note  that  these  measures  should  be \nimplemented in conjunction with the utilization of clear clinical indications and, when \napplicable, validated psychiatric screening instruments. For example increased screening for \nworsening symptoms may prompt detection earlier and inform changes to the treatment \nplan. These measures may prevent escalation of symptoms of agitation, psychosis, or loss of \ncontrol and thereby avoid seclusion and restraints. Additionally staff should be mindful that \novercrowding and restrictions can be potential triggers for behavioral instability. These \nseclusion events are stressful for staff and traumatic for both the patients and to those \npatients who observe such incidents. The significant negativity following such events can, in \nsome  instances,  temporarily  transform  the  nature  of  the  psychiatric  unit.  Therefore, \nidentifying and addressing issues prior to the outburst should be the goal. \nc.  Discharge planning may be more difficult. As many step down residential facilities and \noutpatient facilities are limiting intakes, social workers may find it more difficult to plan \ndisposition of patients. This may result in longer lengths of stay. The treatment team as well \nas utilization review staff should adjust with this expectation. Also, questions may arise about \nthe risk of the patient’s exposure to those at the receiving facility. Repeat testing for COVID-\n19 should ideally be completed prior to discharge as further reassurance for receiving \nfacilities. More resources from varied sources should be mobilized such as family, friends, \nassisted living, county resources, and local charity.  \n \nThere are a number of steps that healthcare facilities can take to be prepared should an individual \nbecome infected with Covid-19.vi Psychiatric hospitals should follow all infection control guidelines as \nstipulated by the CDC.  For general infection control guidelines, see \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/index.html. vii    \nDuring this rapidly changing situation, mental health providers should refer to the CDC website for the \nmost updated information.   Individuals with serious mental illness are at particular risk related to co-\noccurring medical conditions as well as challenges with accessing healthcare. Attention to proper \nprevention and infection control procedures as well as attention to the psychological impacts of the virus \nare important in reducing morbidity and mortality for this vulnerable population.     \n                                                           \ni Sustaining the Well-Being of Healthcare Personnel during Coronavirus and other Infectious Disease \nOutbreaks \nhttps://www.cstsonline.org/assets/media/documents/CSTS_FS_Sustaining_Well_Being_Healthcare_Pe\nrsonnel_du ring.pdf.pdf  Accessed March 17, 2020  \nii Centers for Disease Control, Coronavirus https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019- \nncov/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2Findex.html  \nAccessed March 17, 2020  \niii Covid-19 Mental Health Impacts Resources for Psychiatrist https://www.psychiatry.org/news-\nroom/apablogs/apa-blog/2020/03/covid-19-mental-health-impacts-resources-for-psychiatrists  \nAccessed March 17, 2020  \niv The Psychological Impact of Quarantine and How to Reduce It: Rapid Review of the Evidence.

I have over 35 years of experience managing the provision of services to people \nwith intellectual and behavioral health disabilities, including managing public sector psychiatric \nhospitals in Massachusetts, Maine, and the District Columbia.  My resume was filed with the \nfirst declaration I submitted for this case. I have drawn on my administrative experience to \nevaluate the actions described by the Defendants in this matter. \n2.  I have reviewed the report of Amicus Curiae Dr. Patrick Canavan, in addition to \nthe material I reviewed for my prior declarations.    \n3.  It is my professional opinion that the current level of treatment occurring at St. \nElizabeths Hospital, as described by Dr. Canavan, falls far short of what patients need to \ncontinue their recovery from the serious mental illness that necessitated admission to a \npsychiatric institution. As reported to Dr. Canavan, by multiple individuals in care, “very little, if \nany, treatment is occurring and…there is little for them to do on the units other than watch TV.”  \nThe documentation of treatment hours confirmed that fewer than 100 hours of treatment have \nbeen provided since April 1, 2020 in stark contrast to the almost 6000 hours just two months \nearlier. Only 53 individuals out of a current census of 209 individuals have been prescribed \nindividual therapy sessions, to be conducted via teleconferencing. Yet, this therapy is “on hold” \nfor nine individuals (17%) for various reasons. The Therapeutic Learning Centers are closed and \nboth the current and anticipated efforts to substitute alternative treatment modalities are woefully \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-8   Filed 05/14/20   Page 2 of 5\ninadequate.     \n4.   The conditions at St. Elizabeths Hospital, as described in Dr. Canavan’s report, \nare a clear risk to health and safety. They are drastic deterrents to treatment, recovery and timely \ndischarge; risk traumatizing patients and exacerbating symptoms of mental illness; and \ninevitably will result in long lasting, if not permanent, damage to the individuals and their efforts \nat recovery.  These circumstances violate professional standards of care and treatment.  \n5.  The standard expected practice at psychiatric hospitals, like Saint Elizabeths, is \nthat clinicians and treatment teams, along with the patient, develop Individual Recovery Plans \nthat are then implemented with fidelity.  Based on Dr. Canavan’s report, Saint Elizabeths is not \nimplementing its treatment plans and steps have not been taken to modify them in light of this \nhealth crisis.  Therefore, patients simply are not receiving the services that their treatment teams \ndetermined were essential for recovery and acceptable alternative strategies have not been \nsubstituted. \n6.  It is critical that patients at Saint Elizabeths receive adequate individualized \ncounseling and support to manage their mental health in response to the crisis, including their \nanxiety about the pandemic; grief counseling in response to peers or other friends and relatives \nsuffering from or dying from COVID-19; recreation time, including time each day to go \noutdoors (consistent with COVID-19 restrictions); and enhanced access to social support from \nfriends and family in the community.  Based on Dr. Canavan’s report, Saint Elizabeths has not \ntaken sufficient action to address behavioral health needs specifically arising from this crisis.  \nFor example, the report does not document any actions underway to assist each patient who is \nexperiencing the stress, isolation and restrictions created by this pandemic.  There is no \ninformation about the strategies for recognizing and ameliorating, to the greatest degree possible, \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-8   Filed 05/14/20   Page 3 of 5\nthe emotional toll of this crisis on each individual confined to this institution.  \n7.  Furthermore, Dr. Canavan’s report documented that it is unclear who is reviewing \nincidents of restraint and/or seclusion and the Medical Director confirmed that he is not \nreviewing incidents. This is not only contrary to expected practice but it raises serious concerns \nabout the lack of oversight and the status of effective treatment for those individuals \nexperiencing these restrictive practices.   \n8.  Finally, it is indeed very troubling, and contrary to expected practice, that Dr. \nCanavan’s report documents that the District of Columbia is failing to properly plan and timely \nexecute discharges from the Hospital. It is reported that the pre-COVID practice of reviewing the \n“Ready-to-Discharge” List at biweekly meetings with staff at the Department of Behavioral \nHealth ceased in mid-March. As a result, discharge barriers are not identified and remedied. \nContacts with representatives from the community sector are seriously curtailed. The failure to \nexpedite appropriate discharge to an individualized community setting is contrary to standard \npractice in the field and jeopardizes the individual’s recovery and emotional stability. As of May \n6, 2020, there were 56 individuals on the “Ready-to Discharge” List. In addition, the practice of \ndischarging to shelters should be immediately discontinued. According to Dr. Canavan’s report, \n16 individuals were sent to shelters from St. Elizabeths. This is flatly unacceptable and again \ndemonstrates the failure to plan and effectively implement expected discharge practices. \nPlacement in a shelter during this pandemic places the individual at serious risk of exposure to \ninfection.    \n9.  It continues to be my professional opinion that, based on the number of people on \nthe Ready- to- Discharge List, if concentrated efforts were made, the District could discharge \nthese individuals from Saint Elizabeths and place them in the community because they present \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-8   Filed 05/14/20   Page 4 of 5\nlow-risk and may have homes or housing where they can receive appropriate supports.  The \nDistrict’s lack of effort to effectuate these placements is troubling during the best of times, but \nparticularly concerning in light of the danger posed by COVID-19 exposure at the Hospital.  Dr. \nCanavan’s report clearly demonstrates that Saint Elizabeths is not the appropriate placement for \na significant number of patients in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.   \n10.  St. Elizabeths is part of the District of Columbia’s mental health system. It should \nnot stand in isolation from the wide array of community-based services and supports funded by \nthe District’s government. As other states are now demonstrating, individuals with a serious \nmental illness are being successfully supported and treated in the community during the COVID-\n19 crisis. These accomplishments are the result of systemic planning, flexibility in funding, \ncontinuing technical assistance, strong collaboration between community providers and hospital \nstaff, and oversight by the state agencies. The District of Columbia needs to promptly develop \nmore systemic strategies for coping with the demands of this crisis so that individuals not only \nreceive timely and effective treatment at St. Elizabeths while hospitalized but, equally \nimportantly, are discharged to appropriate community settings with supports as soon as clinically \nand programmatically possible. It is widely recognized in the field of mental health that \nindividuals should not be confined to a psychiatric institution if alternative community-based \noptions can be implemented.   \n11.  In order to address these deficiencies in treatment and discharge planning, I \npropose the following recommendations, in addition to the recommendations in my prior \ndeclarations: \na.  Saint Elizabeths Hospital should be instructed to develop a plan to implement \nIndividual Recovery Plans, with any appropriate modifications required for \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-8   Filed 05/14/20   Page 5 of 5\nhealth/safety during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.  The Medical Director at \nSaint Elizabeths Hospital should ensure updated individual assessments of all \npatients, with input from the patients’ treatment team, his/her attorney, and/or \nother supportive decision makers as determined by patient choice, to evaluate the \neffects of the stress and trauma of the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic \nas well as the clinical repercussions resulting from Defendants’ deprivation of \nappropriate mental health services.  The Medical Director should ensure that any \nnecessary changes to Individual Recovery Plans are implemented without further \ndelay. The recommendations included in Dr. Canavan’s report should be \nimplemented in order to improve the delivery of necessary treatment services \nand supports.  \nb.  It is strongly recommended that the Court continue to rely on the fact-finding \nand recommendations of its Amici Curiae or appoint a Court Monitor to provide \nindependent oversight until compliance with the requirements for health/safety, \ntreatment and timely discharge are met and sustained for a period of time \ndetermined by the prevalence of the COVID 19 virus in the District of \nColumbia. \nI declare, under penalty of perjury, that the forgoing is true and correct.

My name is Wanda Rose. I make these statements based upon my personal knowledge. \n \n2. I am a program developer in the Mental Health Division at the Public Defender Service \nfor the District of Columbia (hereinafter “PDS”) and have served in this role since \nSeptember 21, 2003. PDS is a federally funded, independent organization dedicated to \nrepresenting indigent adults and children facing a loss of liberty in the District of Columbia. \nMy principal responsibility as a program developer at PDS is to assist attorneys in my \ndivision with the social work aspects of their cases. \n \n3. As part of my duties as a program developer at PDS, I regularly speak to social workers at \nSt. Elizabeths Hospital (“SEH”). \n \n4. Since the pandemic began affecting hospital operations on approximately March 16th, \n2020, I have had the opportunity to speak with several social workers at the hospital about \noutplacement efforts. \n \n5. I have also spoken with group home providers and nursing homes during the same time \nperiod. \n \n6. From these conversations I learned the following: \n \nNursing home providers have had to decrease their bed capacity to comply with COVID-19 \ndistancing regulations. Most have no available beds. Some are dealing with virus outbreaks at \ntheir facilities. Some nursing homes have suspended all admissions for the duration of the \npandemic, even though the nursing homes admit having available beds.  \n \nSome group home providers I have spoken with have said they are not accepting people during \nthe pandemic. Other providers want assurances that individuals can be tested and receive results \nquickly. Most providers are asking for two negative tests prior to acceptance. Some providers are \nnot calling back after finding out that the individual seeking outplacement is from SEH. I have \nhad this experience and the social workers at SEH have reported to me that they have had the \nsame experience. I have had to call group home providers repeatedly to get them to call back \nabout scheduling an interview for an individual. Group home providers have said that the video \ninterview format is a hindrance and they were “not able to get a feel for the person” on video. I \nhave been told by group home providers that they are interviewing numerous people for each \navailable slot. I have seen the group home vacancy lists since the end of March 2020. Some \nopenings have not been filled and have been carried over onto the next vacancy list. \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 87-9   Filed 05/14/20   Page 2 of 2\nOn May 6, 2020, I spoke to Sophy Varghese, the Director of Social Work, at SEH. She told me \nthat the only discharges the hospital has had during the pandemic were those in which a provider \nhad accepted the individual prior to the pandemic. She said that while group home providers \nhave been willing to interview via videoconference, they have not actually accepted anyone. \nSophy Varghese also expressed concern about discharging patients at this time when services \nfrom Community Support Agencies (“CSA”) have been diminished due to the virus. I have been \nin WebEx treatment meetings with individuals who are currently seeking outplacement and no \nrepresentative from the CSA was present. \n \nI have also had opportunity to speak several times during the pandemic with Alvin Hinkle, the \nContinuity of Care Chief at the Department of Behavioral Health (“DBH”). He assists with \nfinding community placements for individuals at SEH and he works with group home providers.  \nI asked him if he would be able to talk to the providers about willingness to accept our clients, \nthose that SEH feels are clinically ready to leave and that they are actively seeking placement \nfor. Alvin Hinkle told me that providers are allowed to choose who they will accept. DBH does \nnot get involved in this. I tried repeatedly to ask him about some of our clients individually, but \nhe refused to answer and referred me back to SEH instead. I asked Mr. Hinkle if it might be \npossible to use crisis beds to help get individuals out of the hospital. He said he could not \nauthorize this, and that those beds were only for individuals in crisis, not as a step-down from the \nhospital. I have called the crisis beds at different points during this time, and was told that they \nhad available bed space. \n \nI have asked about using the quarantine hotel at Skyline as a way to help with outplacement. I \nwas told by a social worker at SEH that they have not been directed by DBH that they can refer \npeople there, nor have any other possible housing options been offered other than the group \nhome vacancy list.  \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the foregoing is true \nand correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. \n \nExecuted on the 13th day of May 2020, in North Beach, Maryland. \n \n \nWanda Rose \n____________________________ \nProgram Developer \nPublic Defender Service for DC \n633 Indiana Ave. NW \nWashington, DC \n  2 ",

Initially, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint to remedy \nDefendants’ failure to have in place an adequate emergency plan — a failure that interrupted the \nmedical care of Plaintiffs and other patients at Saint Elizabeths and placed these patients at risk by \nforcing them to live in unsanitary conditions without running water for 28 days after Defendants \ndiscovered that the water supply was contaminated with legionella and other bacteria.  Now, \nDefendants’ persistent apathy toward emergency planning has caused the rapid and deadly spread \nof COVID-19 among the patients and staff at Saint Elizabeths, already resulting in four deaths and \ndozens of confirmed infections.   \nTo curb this escalating danger, Plaintiffs seek a temporary restraining order requiring \nDefendants to take immediate steps, as set forth below, to ensure that patients are appropriately \nprotected and, where possible, released or moved to places where they may continue to receive \nmedical care in a safer and healthier environment. \nAs of April 16, 2020, at least 33 individuals in the care of Saint Elizabeths Hospital, as \nwell as at least 51 of the hospital’s staff, have tested positive for COVID-19.1  Four have died. \nAnd a far greater number of individuals are symptomatic – 74 patients are currently in isolation or \nquarantine due to exposure or symptoms, and 82 staff are out related to the virus.2   This is \nremarkable given that the District reported the first COVID-19 cases at St. Elizabeths on just April \n1.3  Like other “congregate” environments where people live, eat, and sleep closely together (e.g., \n \n1  Dist.  of  Columbia  Dep’t  of  Human  Servs.,  Human  Services  Agency  COVID-19  Case  Data, \nhttps://coronavirus.dc.gov/page/human-services-agency-covid-19-case-data \n2 Id. \n3 Id. \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-1   Filed 04/18/20   Page 10 of 43\nships,  nursing  facilities,  correctional  facilities), the  virus’s  exponential  spread  through  Saint \nElizabeths appears to be even faster than the spread that is happening locally, nationally, and \naround the globe.  The virus appears to be spreading fastest in correctional facilities like Rikers’ \nIsland in New York and Cook County jail in Illinois.  Indeed, as of April 15, 2020, the District of \nColumbia has reported 2,058 cases of COVID-19 and at least 67 deaths; the number of cases is \ndoubling approximately every six days.4     \n  The methods for containing the contagion have been well-publicized.  The Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and other public health experts have advised that the \nbest method to limit transmission of the virus is to avoid gatherings, practice “social distancing” \n(a minimum of six feet between people), engage in meticulous personal hygiene, expand screening \nand testing, isolate symptomatic and exposed individuals, and quarantine of known cases.  For \nindividuals in facilities like Saint Elizabeths, the CDC further recommends that if the “facility \ncannot  fully  implement  all  recommended  precautions”  residents  with  “known  or  suspected \nCOVID-19 . . . should be transferred to another facility that is capable of implementation”5  In \naccordance with that guidance, and in response to the increasing numbers of confirmed cases of \nCOVID-19 in Washington, D.C., Mayor Bowser has issued a series of executive orders that carry \nthe force of law and include criminal penalties for those who do not follow these basic public \nhealth practices. The Mayor’s orders relied, in part, on the following findings:   \nThis Order is issued based on the increasing number of confirmed cases of COVID-\n19 within Washington, DC, and throughout the metropolitan Washington region. \n \n4As of April 13, 2020, there were 554,704 cases and almost 22,000 deaths attributable to COVID-19 reported in the \nUnited States, and more than 1,773,084 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in 213 countries or territories \naround the world and 111,652 have died as a result.

Medical and public health experts agree that COVID-19 is easily transmitted and \nit is essential that its spread be slowed to protect the ability of public and private \nhealth care providers to handle the expected influx of ill patients and safeguard \npublic health and safety. . .. Because of the risk of the rapid spread of the virus, and \nthe need to protect all members of Washington, DC, and the region, especially \nresidents  most  vulnerable  to  the  virus,  and  local  health  care  providers  and \nemergency first responders, this Order requires the temporary closure of the on-site \noperation of all non-essential businesses and implements a prohibition on large \ngatherings. \n \n  In response to the burgeoning crisis at Saint Elizabeths, on April 15, Mayor Bowser issued \nOrder 2020-063, which requires health care facilities, including Saint Elizabeths Hospital, to take \ncertain steps to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.6  The Order details steps the facility must take \nto, among other things, maintain social distancing among residents, restrict visitors from entering \nthe facility, manage symptomatic staff, quarantine or isolate symptomatic or exposed patients, and \ndevelop a continuity of operations plan.7 To date, Defendants have come woefully short of \nperforming these steps. \nContrary to District of Columbia policy and despite CDC and D.C. Department of Health \nguidance, Defendants have failed to protect D.C. residents most vulnerable to the virus.  Medical \nand mental health professionals have consistently urged that individuals with mental disorders \nrequire “priority attention” in this kind of emergency.8 Members of the proposed class, some of \nwhom  suffer  from  psychiatric  conditions  such  as  schizophrenia,  often  have  compromised \n \n6 Extensions of Public Emergency and Public Health Emergency and Measures to Protect Vulnerable Populations \nDuring the Covid-19 Public Health Emergency, D.C.

In particular, “mental health disorders can increase the risk of infections, including \npneumonia”—a leading cause of hospitalization and death among those infected with COVID-19.9  \nIn addition, because of its failure to plan, St. Elizabeths patients are not receiving the \npsychiatric care and treatment that is the reason they are confined to the Hospital. This has short- \nand long-term implications for their mental health and the conditions may be traumatic for some. \nThe hazard of further institutionalization combined with the lack of treatment, weighs heavily \nagainst the further detention of patients who can safely be placed in community settings with \nappropriate supports. \nThere  are  practical  remedies  that  can  address  the  Defendants’  failure  to  protect  the \nconstitutional and statutory rights of the Plaintiffs: \n•  Conduct an individualized assessment of each patient to assess (i) the current effect \nof these conditions on the patient, (ii) to determine whether other options exist in \nlieu of continued placement at St. Elizabeths, including community placement, and \n(iii) whether changes to a patient’s treatment plans are needed. \n \n•  Cease all admissions to the Hospital until the density at St. Elizabeths is sufficiently \nreduced to allow for social distancing and patients at the hospital are no longer at a \nheightened risk due to COVID-19; \n \n•  Provide appropriate COVID-19 intervention and care at the Hospital, including (i) \nevaluating patients and where appropriate administering rapid COVID-19 tests; \n(ii) ensuring clinically effective isolation and quarantine for patients with \nconfirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases; and (iii) determining equipment needs \nand immediately providing masks for any individuals displaying or reporting \nCOVID-19 symptoms or exposure until they can be evaluated by a qualified \nmedical professional or placed in quarantine;  \n \n•  Ensure that each patient has timely and complete access to essential hygiene, \nincluding soap, hand sanitizer, and running water, and materials needed to \ndisinfect surfaces that may be contaminated; \n \n•  Develop capacity for patients, who are not infected and for whom release is not \npossible, to be housed in an auxiliary facility until the density at St. Elizabeths is \n \n9 Hao Yao, et al., Patients with mental health disorders in the COVID-19 epidemic, The Lancet, Vol. 7, Issue 4, at e21 \n(Apr. 1, 2020), https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30090-0. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-1   Filed 04/18/20   Page 13 of 43\nsufficiently reduced to allow for social distancing, and implement social \ndistancing in accordance with public health guidelines. \n \n•  Ensure robust education about COVID-19 for patients, including education about \nhow to identify symptoms, how to take preventative measures, how to contact \npatient advocates, and about any changes in policies and practices at the Hospital. \nThere should be sufficient opportunity to ask and receive answers to questions. \n \n   These are all measures that public and mental health experts say Saint Elizabeths can and \nshould implement.

Saint Elizabeths Hospital and its Patients \nSaint Elizabeths Hospital is the District’s public psychiatric facility and serves individuals \nwith mental illness who need intensive inpatient care. FAC ¶¶ 25, 30.  Saint Elizabeths is the \nDistrict’s only public psychiatric facility for individuals with serious and persistent mental illness \nwho need intensive inpatient care to support their recovery. FAC ¶¶ 25, 30; Ex. 1 Declaration of \nElizabeth Jones (“Jones Decl.”) ¶ 7.  Saint Elizabeths also provides mental health evaluations and \ncare to patients committed by the courts.  FAC ¶¶ 25, 30.  Patients at Saint Elizabeths Hospital are \nentitled to a dignified, respectful and supportive environment and generally accepted standards of \nindividualized treatment, continuity of care, professionalism, and health and safety. FAC ¶ 31; \nJones Decl. ¶ 8.  Those goals must be achieved through hospital settings that are safe, calm, \npredictable (in terms of the patient’s routine), and responsive to the needs of each individual \npatient.  Jones Decl. ¶ 9.  Where these conditions do not exist, there is a risk of further traumatizing \npatients and exacerbating their psychiatric conditions.

FAC ¶ 32.  On April 14, 2020, the patient population was 237.  FAC ¶ 32.  Saint \nElizabeths Hospital patients are committed to the care of the District. Patients may be committed \nin one of several ways.  Patients may have civil legal status, meaning that they are committed \nvoluntarily, or civilly committed, or committed on an emergency basis.  Patients may be committed \nafter being adjudicated in criminal court as not guilty by reason of insanity (“NGI”).  Patients may \nbe committed to Saint Elizabeth’s for forensic reasons, because they are awaiting a hearing to \ndetermine their competency to stand trial or to have their competency restored.  Patients in any \ncategory may be transferred from D.C. correctional facilities or other area hospitals.  FAC ¶ 34.  \nDefendants have the authority to (i) release any patients who are civilly committed or who are \ncommitted to the Hospital voluntarily, and (ii) evaluate and recommend release or continued \ncommitment for patients who are criminally committed or who are committed because of their \nNGI status.  FAC ¶¶ 23-36.  Saint Elizabeths Hospital patients are housed in one of 11 units, or \nhouses.  FAC ¶ 33.  The units consist of bedrooms and common spaces.10  FAC ¶ 33.  Houses are \norganized into three clusters: admissions, continuing care and geri-medical. Some of the bedrooms \nare single occupancy and some are double occupancy.  FAC ¶ 33. \n2.  The 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic \n  COVID-19 is the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus that has caused a global \npandemic.  FAC ¶ 37.

Risk of Infection at Saint Elizabeths Hospital \n  Medical and mental health professionals have consistently urged that individuals with \nmental health disorders require “priority attention” in this kind of emergency.  FAC ¶ 49; Golob \nDecl. ¶ 14.  Mental health disorders like those experienced by Plaintiffs can increase the risk of \ninfections, including pneumonia, a leading cause of hospitalization and death among those infected \nwith COVID-19. FAC ¶ 50.26  Congregate settings like Saint Elizabeths Hospital enable and \nfacilitate the rapid spread of COVID-19 infection.  FAC ¶ 51; Stern Decl. ¶ 13; Golob Decl. ¶ 13.  \nPeople live, eat, and sleep in close proximity. In such environments, infectious diseases that are \ntransmitted via the air or touch are more likely to spread. FAC ¶ 51.  Stern Decl. ¶ 13. This therefore \npresents an increased danger for the spread of COVID-19 once it has been introduced into the \nfacility.  FAC ¶ 51; Stern Decl. ¶ 13; Golob Decl. ¶ 13.   \n  To the extent that patients are housed in close quarters, unable to maintain a six-foot \ndistance from others, and sharing or touching objects used by others, the risks of spread are greatly, \nif not exponentially, increased.  FAC ¶ 52; Stern Decl. ¶ 12; Golob Decl. ¶ 14.  Because people — \nincluding staff and contractors —constantly cycle in and out of Saint Elizabeths Hospitals facilities \nand new patients are being admitted, there is an ever-present risk that new carriers will bring the \nvirus into the facility.

The spread of COVID-19 at St. Elizabeths Hospital could have a \ndevastating impact on public health far beyond the Hospital’s walls. Staff who enter and leave the \nfacility could transmit the virus to the broader community and demands for intensive care beds \nand ventilators could overwhelm local hospitals and health care providers. It is essential at this \ntime that all steps be taken to reduce infection and to “flatten the curve” to ensure that our health \ncare system does not collapse. FAC ¶ 54; Stern Decl. ¶¶ 14-17.   \n  Nursing facilities are similar congregate settings.  In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan is \nsending “strike teams” to nursing facilities that are at high-risk of COVID-19 because of the \nheightened danger to residents.  These strike teams will administer rapid tests; ensure isolation of \nsuspected COVID-19 cases and quarantine of confirmed COVID-19 cases; determine equipment \nneeds; and provide on-site care and medical assessment.27  Maryland’s response underscores the \npublic and individual health imperatives for immediate and decisive action for persons confined \nto congregate settings and provides a model for implementing such protective actions.  FAC ¶ 55. \n4.  The COVID-19 Outbreak at Saint Elizabeths Hospital \nPlaintiffs’ counsel wrote to Defendants and Defendants’ counsel on March 13 and March \n17, 2020 inquiring whether any protocols had been implemented to protect patients from COVID-\n19, urging Defendants to take immediate steps to reduce the patient population at the Hospital, and \nadvocating for every patient to be evaluated for community placement as soon as possible.

The response stated that \nno cases of COVID-19 had been detected among the patients or staff.  FAC ¶ 61-63. Since then, \ncircumstances have changed dramatically.  \nOn April 1, 2020, one patient and five staff members at St. Elizabeths were confirmed to \nbe COVID-19 positive.28  On April 2, Plaintiffs sent a follow-up letter to Defendants requesting \nan update and information about Defendants’ response and reiterating the request that Defendants \nevaluate every patient for community placement and take aggressive steps to protect patients who \nremain in the Hospital.  FAC ¶ 64.  On April 9, Plaintiffs sent a further follow-up letter.  Defendants \nacknowledged receipt but had not otherwise responded to either letter prior to the filing of the \namended complaint.  FAC ¶ 64.  Not until April 16 — moments after Plaintiffs filed their Motion \nfor an Emergency Hearing and for Leave to File an Amended Complaint (ECF No. 36) — did \nDefendants finally respond to Plaintiffs’ April 2 and April 9 letters.29 \nAs of April 16, 2020, at least 33 Saint Elizabeths patients, as well as at least 51 of the \nhospital’s staff, had tested positive for COVID-19.30 At least four Saint Elizabeths Hospital \npatients have died after contracting COVID-19.31 \n5.

The DBH reported 71 staff absences caused by \nCOVID-19 quarantine or isolation on April 15.39  \nARGUMENT \nTo obtain a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction, the moving party must \nestablish that: (1) it is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in \nthe absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips in its favor; and (4) that an \ninjunction is in the public interest.  Gordon v. Holder, 632 F.3d 722, 724 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citing \nWinter  v.  Natural  Res.  Def.  Council,  555  U.S.  7,  20  (2008)).  Courts  in  this  Circuit  have \ntraditionally applied these factors on a “sliding scale,” where a stronger showing on some factors \ncan compensate for a weaker showing on others. See, e.g., Davenport v. Int’l Brotherhood of \nTeamsters, 166 F.3d 356, 360 (D.C. Cir. 1999). The Circuit has suggested, but not decided, that \nan independent showing of likelihood of success is required. See Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, \n392-93 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citing Winter, 555 U.S. at 20-22). Under either approach, Plaintiff makes \n \n39Dist. of Columbia Dep’t of Human Servs., Human Services Agency COVID-19 Case Data,   \nhttps://coronavirus.dc.gov/page/human-services-agency-covid-19-case-data \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-1   Filed 04/18/20   Page 25 of 43\nthe necessary showing here. Standards for issuing a temporary restraining order and a preliminary \ninjunction are the same and can therefore be analyzed together. Singh v. Carter, 168 F. Supp. 3d \n216, 223 (D.D.C. 2016). \nAnd the Court has authority to order relief to remedy unconstitutional conditions, including \nby release. The writ of habeas corpus, which “cuts through all forms and goes to the very tissue of \nthe structure,” Chatman-Bey v. Thornburgh, 864 F.2d 804, 807 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (en banc), is \nflexible enough to provide both authority for release and also to order remedies for unconstitutional \nconditions of confinement, as “[h]abeas corpus tests not only the fact but also the form of \ndetention.” Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1033 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (quoting Hudson v. Hardy, \n424 F.2d 854 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (internal quotation marks omitted). The court’s remedial authority \nin an ordinary civil action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is likewise broad. As the Court has long \nrecognized in § 1983 conditions cases, “Once invoked, the scope of a district court’s equitable \npowers ... is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.” Hutto v. Finney, \n437 U.S. 678, 687 n.9 (1978) (quoting Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 281 (1977), in turn \nquoting Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U.S. 1, 15 (1971)); accord Citizens for \nResponsibility & Ethics in Washington v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 846 F.3d 1235, 1241–42 (D.C. Cir. \n2017) (reiterating this principle).  \nFinally, as to discrimination against individuals with disabilities, the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (ADA) grants broad remedial authority to the courts.  Title II of the ADA provides \nthat \"no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from \nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, \nor  be  subjected  to  discrimination  by  any  such entity.\"  42  U.S.C.  §  12132.  The  unjustified \ninstitutional isolation of persons with mental disabilities is properly regarded as discrimination \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-1   Filed 04/18/20   Page 26 of 43\nbased on disability, for (1) in findings applicable to the entire ADA, Congress explicitly identified \nunjustified segregation of persons with disabilities as a form of discrimination (42 U.S.C. §v \n12101(a)(2), 12101(a)(5)); and (2) recognition of such a rule reflects the evident judgments that \n(a) institutional placement of persons who can handle and benefit from community settings \nperpetuates  unwarranted  assumptions  that  persons  so  isolated  are  incapable  or  unworthy  of \nparticipating in community life, and (b) confinement in an institution severely diminishes the \neveryday life activities of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, \neconomic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment. Olmstead v. L. C. by \nZimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999). The court has additionally held that public entities violate the ADA \nwhen they “care for a mentally…disabled individual in [facility] notwithstanding, with reasonable \nmodifications to its policies and procedures, it could care for that individual in the community. \nBrown v. District of Columbia, 928 F.3d 1070, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 2019).  \n1.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits of Their Claim \nPlaintiffs and proposed class members are substantially likely to prevail on the merits of \ntheir claims. Under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, “[p]retrial detainees (unlike \nconvicted prisoners) cannot be punished at all.” Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2475 \n(2015); accord Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 n.16 (1979). Pretrial detainees can demonstrate \nthat they have been “punished” if the actions taken against them are either motivated by an intent \nto punish, Kingsley, 135 S. Ct. at 2473, or are objectively unreasonable, see id.  \nComparably, when a government entity involuntarily commits a person, “the Constitution \nimposes  upon  [the  state]  a  corresponding  duty  to  assume  some  responsibility  for  [that \nindividual’s] safety and general well-being.  Jordan v. District of Columbia, 161 F. Supp. 3d 45, \n53 (D.D.C. 2016) (quoting DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty. Dep't of Social Servs., 489 U.S. 189, \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-1   Filed 04/18/20   Page 27 of 43\n197, (1989), and citing Harvey v. District of Columbia, 798 F.3d 1042, 1050-51 (D.C. Cir. 2015) \n(discussing DeShaney in the involuntary commitment context) (alterations in the original)); Moses \nv. District of Columbia, 741 F.Supp.2d 123 (D.D.C. 2010). Due process standards for civil \ndetainees, like those for pretrial detainees, are higher than those under the Eighth Amendment for \nindividuals convicted of crimes: “[p]ersons who have been involuntarily committed are entitled \nto more considerate treatment and conditions of confinement than criminals whose conditions of \nconfinement are designed to punish.” Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 321-22 (1982).   \nIf the Court finds here that the conditions are objectively unreasonable and/or fail to ensure \nPlaintiffs’ safety and well-being, then Plaintiffs and class members—all of whom are civil or pretrial \ndetainees and none of whom has been convicted of a crime—have made out a Fifth Amendment \nclaim regardless of Defendants’ subjective intent. See id.; accord Darnell v. Pineiro, 849 F.3d 17, \n35 (2d Cir. 2017) (“[T]he Due Process Clause can be violated when an official does not have \nsubjective awareness that the official’s acts (or omissions) have subjected the pretrial detainee to a \nsubstantial risk of harm.”). The following analysis relies on due process cases under both the Fifth \nAmendment (which applies here, because the governmental actor is the District of Columbia, see \nBolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 (1954)) and the Fourteenth Amendment, because the due \nprocess protections under both clauses are the same, Doe v. District of Columbia, 206 F. Supp. 3d \n583, 603 n.11 (D.D.C. 2016); Plaintiffs also rely on Eighth Amendment cases because a non-\nconvicted detainee’s rights “are at least as great as the Eighth Amendment protections available \nto a convicted prisoner,” City of Revere v. Mass. Gen. Hosp., 463 U.S. 239, 244 (1983); see also \nCty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 850 (1998) (explaining that treatment that would \nviolate a convicted person’s Eighth Amendment right a fortiori violates a pretrial detainee’s due \nprocess right). \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-1   Filed 04/18/20   Page 28 of 43\nAmong the most basic rights of civil and pretrial detainees are the right to adequate \nmedical care, Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324 (1982), and reasonable safety in confinement, see \nHelling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993) (holding that even convicted individuals may not be \nsubjected to “a condition of confinement that is . . . very likely to cause serious illness and needless \nsuffering.”). Even for convicted individuals, the right to medical care includes the right to mental \nhealth care. See Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 506 (2011).  The record evidence — in the form of \nsworn affidavits from residents in Defendants’ custody and from attorneys and investigators from \nPDS who have witnessed first-hand the conditions of Defendants’ facilities, and expert declarations \nfrom infectious disease and mental health specialists — amply demonstrates the breadth and scope \nof Defendants’ unconstitutional actions and inactions in unreasonably failing to provide adequate \nmedical care and to protect the health and safety of Plaintiffs.  \nDuring the COVID-19 outbreak, St. Elizabeths has responded by housing symptomatic and \nCOVID-19 positive individuals together with asymptomatic individuals, potentially exposing \nindividuals who do not have COVID-19; the Hospital has also failed to isolate and quarantine \nindividuals with the virus or suspected of having the virus.  This is almost exactly the situation the \nSupreme Court described in Helling, where inmates in “isolation were crowded into cells” with \nindividuals with “infectious maladies.”  Id.  The Hospital has compounded this failure during the \nCOVID-19 crisis by failing to provide basic sanitation appropriate to the situation—in this case, \nample soap and hand sanitizer, increased cleaning and disinfection of areas.  See Williams v. \nGriffin, 952 F.2d 820, 825 (4th Cir. 1991); Walker v. Schult, 717 F.3d 119, 126-27 (2d Cir. 2013); \nGates v. Cook, 376 F.3d 323, 338 (5th Cir. 2004); McBride v. Deer, 240 F.3d 1287, 1291-92 (10th \nCir. 2001).  Significant deficiencies in hygienic conditions violate the constitutional rights of \nprisoners.  See Caldwell v. Caesar, 150 F. Supp. 2d 50, 64 (D.D.C. 2001). Notably, Plaintiffs do \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-1   Filed 04/18/20   Page 29 of 43\nnot need to show that they are currently infected or suffering “serious health problems” to show that \nthey face a “substantial risk” of serious harm that is unconstitutional. Helling, 509 U.S. at 34. On \nthe contrary, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that “prison authorities ... may ignore a \ncondition of confinement that is sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering \nthe next week or month or year.” Id. at 33. Even more specifically, the Court held that prison \nauthorities could not escape responsibility for preventing “the exposure of inmates to a serious, \ncommunicable disease on the ground that the complaining inmate shows no serious current \nsymptoms.” Id.   \nEssential mental health care has been severely curtailed during the COVID-19 outbreak.  \nLarge numbers of staff have called in sick, the Treatment Mall has been closed, and patients are \nnot receiving necessary care.  It bears emphasis that the CDC Guidance specifically instructs \ninstitutions to “plan for staff absences” including  making a “plan for alternative coverage by cross-\ntraining staff” and “develop[ing] a plan to secure additional staff.”40  The Hospital appears to have \nfailed to implement any of these measures. \nAmple  record  evidence,  expert  reports,  and  persuasive  decisions  from  other  circuits \ndemonstrate that patients at the Hospital face a substantial risk of contracting COVID-19. The \nrecord evidence shows that Plaintiffs and proposed class members face a “substantial risk” of \ncontracting  COVID-19.  Most  significantly,  according  to  Defendants,  there  are  already  79 \nconfirmed cases of COVID-19 in their facilities—51 staff and 33 patients. And 156 persons—74 \npatients and 82 staff are in isolation or quarantine.   \n \n40 CTRS.

Cf. Helling, 509 U.S. at 36 (asking “whether society considers the \nrisk that the prisoner complains of to be so grave that it violates contemporary standards of \ndecency to expose anyone unwillingly to such a risk.”). The available data from the CDC show \nthat  of  Americans  generally  who  tested  positive  for  COVID-19,  nearly  a  third  require \nhospitalization, many of those require admission to the ICU, and between 1.8 and 3.4 percent of \npeople die. From a clinical and public health perspective, COVID-19 poses a risk of serious harm \nto anyone who contracts it. Dr. Golob explains that this severe risk extends not only to the elderly, \nbut to “younger and healthier people” for whom “infection of this virus requires supportive care, \nwhich  includes  supplemental  oxygen,  positive  pressure  ventilation,  and  in  extreme  cases, \nextracorporeal mechanical oxygenation.” Golob Decl. ¶ 5. \nThe declarations of emergency from nearly every level of government is strong evidence \nCOVID-19 is a risk that society considers to be grave. In declaring a national emergency on March \n13, 2020, President Trump proclaimed that “[t]he spread of COVID-19 within our Nation’s \ncommunities threatens to strain our Nation’s healthcare systems.”41. Mayor Bowser’s Declaration \nof Public Health Emergency includes the finding that COVID- 19 “poses a significant risk of \nsubstantial future harm to a large number of people in the District of Columbia.”42  \n \n41 Exec.

Reg. 15337 (Mar. 13, 2020), available at \nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-03-18/pdf/2020-05794.pdf.  \n42 Mayor’s Order 2020-046, § I(C) (Mar. 11, 2020), available at \nhttps://mayor.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/mayormb/release_content/attachments/MO.DeclarationofPublicHealt\nhEmergency03.11.20.pdf.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-1   Filed 04/18/20   Page 31 of 43\nFor these and other reasons, many courts have recognized that COVID-19 poses a risk of \nserious harm. The Court in Basank v. Decker, No. 20-cv-2518 (AT), 2020 WL 1481503 (S.D.N.Y. \nMar. 26, 2020), pointed to “[a] number of courts in this district and elsewhere [that] have \nrecognized the threat that COVID-19 poses to individuals held in jails and other detention \nfacilities.” Id. at *3 (citing United States v. Stephens, No. 15-cr-95 (AJN), 2020 WL 1295155, at \n*2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 19, 2020); United States v. Garlock, No. 18-cr-418 (VC), 2020 WL 1439980, \nat *1 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 25, 2020)). The New Jersey Supreme Court, in approving an order resulting \nin the release of approximately 1,000 people from New Jersey jails, described “the profound risk \nposed to people in correctional facilities arising from the spread of COVID-19.” In the Matter of \nthe Request to Commute or Suspend County Jail Sentences, Case No. 84230 (N.J. March 22, \n2020). Even this Court’s own operations have been dramatically changed by the “pandemic,” in \nChief Judge Howell’s words, “reflecting the seriousness of the need to combat the community \nspread of the virus.” In re: Court Operations in Exigent Circumstances Created by the COVID-\n19 Pandemic, Standing Order No. 20-9 (BAH), at 1–2. \nTo recognize the gravity of the risk, the court need look no further than statements of the \nDistrict’s own officials, including Defendant Bazron. Mayor Bowser herself announced on March \n11, 2020, that COVID-19 “poses a significant risk of substantial future harm to a large number of \npeople in the District of Columbia.” Mayor’s Order 2020-046, § I(C) (March 11, 2020). And in \nresponse to a letter from Plaintiffs’ counsel, Defendant Barzon recognized “the significant perils \nposed by the highly communicable coronavirus.”  Defendant Barzon advised that on March 12, \nthe Hospital activated its Emergency Preparedness Plan. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-1   Filed 04/18/20   Page 32 of 43\nPlaintiffs and proposed class members are likely to prevail in showing that Defendants have \ndisregarded and continue to disregard the excessive risk to their health or safety. Ms. Jones notes \nthat the conditions at the Hospital are “a clear risk to health and safety.”  Jones ¶ 16.  \nThe very failures of Defendants in this case have been found to constitute deliberate \nindifference in like cases. For instance, in Feliciano v. Gonzales, 13 F. Supp. 2d 151 (D.P.R. \n1998), the Court found that the defendant’s “inability . . . to properly isolate cases of active \ntuberculosis,” the “insufficient medical dormitory beds,” the failure to “fully screen incoming \ninmates,” and the failure to “provide for a sick call system that ensures access to care and that is \ncapable of effectively handling emergencies” constituted deliberate indifference. Id. at 208–09. \nIn other cases, the defendant’s inability to “adequately quarantine or remove inmates and support \nstaff known to have active tuberculosis” was found to constitute deliberate indifference. See \nShimon v. Dep’t of Corr. Servs. for N.Y., No. 93-cv-3144 (DC), 1996 WL 15688, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. \nJan. 17, 1996). And in Joy v. Healthcare CMS, 534 F. Supp. 2d 482 (D. Del. 2008), the Court \nfound that the plaintiffs stated a claim under the Eighth Amendment where the warden “was aware \nthat inmates were not thoroughly screened for disease before going into general population and \nthat Correctional Medical Services does not have a policy in place to examine inmates before \nplacing them into general population.” Id. at 485. As discussed above, the record is replete with \nDefendants’ deficient performance in all of these categories, including their failed quarantine \npolicy, rampant medical delays, and ineffective screening procedures. \nDefendants’ failure to protect Plaintiffs and the objective unreasonableness of their conduct \ncan also be shown by reference to their failure to follow accepted medical standards—a showing that \nsuffices to meet even the Eighth Amendment standard that is more demanding than due process. The \nCourt in Hernandez v. County of Monterey, 110 F. Supp. 3d 929 (N.D. Cal. 2015), explained that \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-1   Filed 04/18/20   Page 33 of 43\n“known noncompliance with generally accepted guidelines for inmate health strongly indicates \ndeliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm.” Id. at 943. Here, Dr. Stern’s \ndeclaration makes clear that Defendants are out of compliance in critical categories, including \nscreening and testing policies, social distancing requirements, medical isolation, and quarantine \nprotocols. Stern Decl. ¶ 16. \nDefendants are also unnecessarily and discriminatorily institutionalizing patients who \ncould be served in a community-based placement because to date they have failed to evaluate and \ndevelop release plans.  While, under Title II of the ADA, a public entity may rely on the \nassessments of its own professionals in determining whether an individual \"meets the essential \neligibility requirements\" for habilitation in a community-based program, those assessments must \nbe reasonable. Olmstead v. L.V. by Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 602.Defendant’s actions, and inactions, \nin addressing the COVID-19 pandemic have created an unreasonable risk of harm to Plaintiffs’ \nmental  and  physical health  which  undermines  any  previously  existing  justification for  their \ninstitutionalization. Defendants’ failure to evaluate all patients for community placement does not \nallow the conclusion that plaintiffs isolation is currently justified. See Long v. Benson, No. 08-\n0026, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109917, 2008 WL 4571904, at *2 (N.D. Fla. 2008) (refusing to \nlimit class to individuals whom state professionals deemed could be treated in the community, \nbecause a State \"cannot deny the [integration] right simply by refusing to acknowledge that the \nindividual could receive appropriate care in the community. Otherwise the right would, or at least \ncould, become wholly illusory.\").  Plaintiffs are in danger of contracting a highly communicable, \npotentially fatal virus. The very treatment they were institutionalized to receive, intensive inpatient \npsychiatric  care,  is  not  taking  place.  Given  these  circumstances,  continued  segregation  and \ninstitutionalization of plaintiffs is not reasonable.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-1   Filed 04/18/20   Page 34 of 43\nIn short, even as to convicted individuals (which Plaintiffs are not), a facility “that deprives \n[persons] of basic sustenance, including adequate medical care, is incompatible with the concept \nof human dignity and has no place in civilized society.” Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 510–11 \n(2011).  Given the grave risk of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic, the conditions to which \nDefendants are subjecting Plaintiffs in Saint Elizabeths Hospital fall below basic standards of \ndecency, are objectively unreasonable, fail to ensure plaintiffs’ reasonable safety, and therefore \nviolate due process.  While Defendants may have had reasonable assessments justifying the \ninstitutionalization of plaintiffs in a functioning, safe psychiatric facility, the equities have shifted \nin light of the COVID-19 pandemic such that the risks to plaintiffs physical and mental health \noutweigh and limited benefit of inadequate mental health treatment they will receive for the \nduration of the public health emergency.   \n2.  Plaintiffs Will Suffer Irreparable Harm Unless Defendants Are Enjoined from \nFollowing a Policy that Will Allow them to be Housed in Unconstitutional \nConditions in the Future \n \nAs discussed above, Plaintiffs’ constitutional and statutory rights are being deprived, and \nnothing more is needed to prove irreparable harm, because the deprivation of constitutional rights, \n“for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”  Mills v. District \nof Columbia, 571 F.3d 1304, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2009); Mitchell v. Cuomo, 748 F.2d 804, 806 (2d \nCir. 1984) (“When an alleged deprivation of a constitutional right is involved, most courts hold \nthat no further showing of irreparable injury is necessary.”) (citing 11 C. Wright & A. Miller, \nFederal Practice and Procedure § 2948.1 (1973))); see generally Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, \n511 (2011) (“Courts . . . must not shrink from their obligation to enforce the constitutional rights \nof . . . prisoners.” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).  In Olmstead v. Zimring, the \nCourt was concerned with two distinct harms people with disabilities suffer when subjected to \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-1   Filed 04/18/20   Page 35 of 43\ndiscriminatory unjustified isolation. Olmstead v. L. C. by Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 600. First, the \nCourt was concerned with the stigma society places on individuals with disabilities when they are \nisolated and, secondly, the Court was concerned that individuals with disabilities so isolated have \nseverely diminished everyday life activities, including family relations, social contacts, work \noptions, economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment. Id. And even \nif Plaintiffs did not suffer constitutional injury, these facts demonstrate irreparable harm, as \ndiscussed below.   \nPlaintiffs are individuals with seriously mental illnesses, many involuntarily housed in a \npsychiatric  hospital.    During  the  pandemic,  they  have  been  unnecessarily  exposed  to  the \ncoronavirus without adequate means to protect themselves, have been grouped with individuals \nwho likely have COVID-19, and have not received adequate care when they exhibit symptoms of \nthe disease.  Every day, they are deprived of the soap, hand sanitizer, and masks to allow them to \nadequately mitigate their risk of infection.  Every day, they are being deprived of the mental health \ncare that is the purpose of their commitment to the hospital.   \nElizabeth Jones has over 35 years of experience managing the provision of services to \npeople  with  intellectual  and  behavioral  health  disabilities,  including  managing  public  sector \npsychiatric hospitals in the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, and Maine.  Jones Decl. ¶ 1.  She \nwas the Hospital Director at St. Elizabeths Hospital from February 1998 through April 2000 at \nwhich time she became Chief Operating Officer for the District of Columbia’s Commission on \nMental Health Services while it was under federal court receivership.  Id. at ¶ 5.  According to \nJones, delays in the treatment of a physical illness of a patient who has been institutionalized can \nresult in feelings of isolation, hopelessness, and despair, as well as increased stress and anxiety.  \nId. at ¶ 11.  St. Elizabeths’ failure to provide safety, security, predictability, and continuity of care \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-1   Filed 04/18/20   Page 36 of 43\nis counter to effective treatment and has resulted in fear and actual harm, including regression, loss \nof self-esteem, and exacerbation of distress and heightened instability, leading to longer lengths of \nhospitalization and the likelihood of more restrictive measures such as loss of privileges or the use \nof seclusion or restraints.  Id. at ¶ 12.  Jones has concluded based on her review of the statements \nof the Plaintiffs that the conditions at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital presented a clear risk to health of \nsafety and drastic deterrents to treatment, recovery, and timely discharge of the its patients.  Id. at \n¶ 16.  \nEvery day during the current crisis, Plaintiffs are being deprived of the essentials of the \ncare that the District is required to provide.  See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324.  As described by \nJones, irreparable harm is occurring with each passing day as the conditions at St. Elizabeth’s \n“inevitably will result in long lasting, if not permanent, damages to the patients and their efforts at \nrecovery” (Jones Decl. ¶ 16), demonstrating the need for the relief Plaintiffs seek here.   \nIn addition to the present danger, there is a serious danger of recurrent violation because \nthis is the third time in three years that patients at St. Elizabeths have been subjected to dangerous \nconditions of various kinds when, in the face of a crisis at the Hospital, Defendants failed to \nrespond with necessary measures to protect patients.  The Defendants’ Emergency Protocols have \nnow thrice failed to provide safe or humane conditions of confinement, or adequate mental health \nor other care during a crisis.   \n3.  Enjoining  Defendants  from  Failing  to  House  and  Treat  Involuntarily \nCommitted  Persons  in  Conditions  that  Meet  the  Most  Basic  Standard  of \nDecency Will Not Substantially Injure Defendants or Other Interested Parties  \n \nAs discussed, supra, Plaintiffs and others similarly situated, will suffer irreparable harm in \nthe absence of relief from this Court. In contrast, the injunction would impose no measurable harm \non Defendants. When a government entity involuntarily commits persons to its custody, it has an \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-1   Filed 04/18/20   Page 37 of 43\nobligation to provide essentials.  Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 324 (1982).  Defendants have \nno legal right to confine Plaintiffs and others where they are exposed to a dangerous and life-\nthreatening risk.  \nAs outlined in the relief section, there are measures Defendants can take to address the \nrisks of COVID-19 as well as patient and public safety that would allow Defendants to transfer \nPlaintiffs and other similarly situated individuals to other appropriate facilities or discharge them \n(where appropriate) to community-based care.  Indeed, it is Defendants’ affirmative obligation to \ndo so when circumstances exist such that the isolation of individuals with disabilities is no longer \njustified. The ADA seeks to prevent not only intentional discrimination against people with \ndisabilities,  but  also—primarily—discrimination  that  results  from  \"thoughtlessness  and \nindifference,\" that is, from \"benign neglect.\" Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 301 (1985); see \nH.R. Rep. No. 101-485(II), at 29 (1990). Thus, the law requires \"affirmative accommodations to \nensure  that  facially  neutral  rules  do  not  in  practice  discriminate  against  individuals  with \ndisabilities.\" Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d. 261, 275 (2d Cir, 2003); see also Tennessee v. \nLane,  541  U.S.  509,  511  (2004)  (\"Recognizing  that  failure  to  accommodate  persons  with \ndisabilities will often have the same practical effect as outright exclusion, Congress required the \nStates  to  take  reasonable  measures  to  remove  .  . .  barriers  to  accessibility.\");  42  U.S.C.  § \n12112(b)(5)(A) (defining discrimination to include failing to \"mak[e] reasonable accommodations \nto the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability\"). \nDefendants’ continued isolation of Plaintiffs due to their refusal to modify their evaluation and \nrelease policies in light of the COVID-19 pandemic is unreasonable and the risks Plaintiffs and \nPlaintiffs class are being subjected to in this case are even more egregious than the facts in \nAlexander v. Choate as Defendant’s indifference towards Plaintiffs is not benign, but subjects them \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-1   Filed 04/18/20   Page 38 of 43\nto an unreasonable risk of contracting a highly communicable, potentially fatal virus all while \ndepriving them of necessary mental health services. Defendants provide a wide array of services \nin  the  community  to  meet  the  needs  of  Plaintiffs  including  diagnostic/assessment  services, \ncounseling, medication, intensive day treatment and crisis/emergency services.43 Individualized \nbehavioral health services are supported by rehabilitation programs, peer supports, supportive \nemployment opportunities, housing assistance and a range of community housing alternatives to \nfacility-based care.44 These services are being provided by Defendants during the COVID-19 crisis \nand could be provided to Plaintiffs and Plaintiff class in the community.  \nAs  described  in  the  Jones  Declaration,  this  process  would  involve  conducting  an \nindividualized assessment of each patient by St. Elizabeths staff.  Jones Decl. ¶ 17(b).  This \nassessment could be made by the Medical Director, and would require consideration of whether \nother options exist in lieu of continued placement at St. Elizabeths.  Jones Decl. ¶ 17(d).  Because \nthe assessments could be made with current employees of Defendants and the costs of placing \npatients  in  community  settings  or  to  private  hospitals  are  roughly  comparable  (if  not  less \nexpensive) than housing the individuals at St. Elizabeths, there is no reason to believe that ordering \nthe requested relief will substantially injure Defendants. \nSimilarly, there is no reason why Defendants should not stop the admissions of new \npatients.  Individuals who would ordinarily be sent to Saint Elizabeths can be sent to a community \nsetting with support, or if supervision is essential, to a private psychiatric hospital in the District, \nand there is no reason to believe that ordering such relief will substantially injure Defendants.  \n   \n \n43 Dist. Of Columbia, Dep’t of Behavioral Health, Adult Services, available at https://dbh.dc.gov/service/adult-\nservices \n44 Id.  \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-1   Filed 04/18/20   Page 39 of 43\n4.      A TRO Will Serve the Public Interest.   \nThe public interest is served when constitutional and statutory rights are protected. “It is \nalways in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party’s constitutional rights.” Simms v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 872 F. Supp. 2d 90, 105 (D.D.C. 2012) (quoting Abdah v. Bush, No. 04-cv-\n1254, 2005 WL 711814 at *6 (D.D.C. Mar. 29, 2005)); accord Lamprecht v. F.C.C., 958 F.2d 382, \n390 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (“a [government] policy that is unconstitutional would inherently conflict \nwith the public interest”).  In the instant case, the public interest would be vindicated by honoring \nindividual civil rights and restoring basic standards of decency to the treatment of Plaintiffs and \nother patients at the Hospital during future crises. As long as departing residents are held in \nappropriate isolation, the risk to public health is much greater keeping them at Saint Elizabeths \nthan transferring them elsewhere or letting them out—inside the facility, they will continue to \nspread COVID-19 within the congregate setting and infect more staff, who will further infect the \ncommunity. Outside, they can self-isolate after quarantine just as the Mayor has ordered everyone \nelse to do. \nREQUESTED REMEDY  \nDefendant’s policies and practices have led to untenable conditions that have placed \npatients at Saint Elizabeths at an “imminent and heighted risk from COVID-19.”  Stern Decl. ¶ 12.  \nFurther, Defendants have deprived patients of necessary care and created a chaotic environment \nthat, if allowed to continue, will be “drastic deterrents to treatment, recovery and timely discharge.”  \nJones Decl. ¶ 16.  The Court should order emergency relief to accomplish two things.  First, it \nshould order the Department of Behavioral Health to follow public health guidelines for preventing \nand controlling the spread of COVID-19 at Saint Elizabeths Hospital, including, after conducting \nindividualized assessments, significantly reducing the patient population at the Hospital.  Second, \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-1   Filed 04/18/20   Page 40 of 43\nit should enjoin Defendants from further damaging Plaintiffs’ mental health by continuing lack of \nessential treatment.  \n1.  Significant downsizing of Saint Elizabeths Hospital is the most effective way to prevent \nand control the spread of COVID-19 among the patients.  Stern Decl. ¶¶ 13-15; Jones Decl. ¶¶ \n17(a) & 17(j)(ii).  To this end, the Court should order Defendants to: \na.  Cease all admissions to the Hospital until the density at St. Elizabeths is sufficiently \nreduced to allow for social distancing and patients at the hospital are no longer at a \nheightened risk due to COVID-19;  \nb.  Conduct an individualized assessment of each patient, within 48 hours, to assess \nthe current effect of these conditions on the patient and to determine whether other \noptions exist in lieu of continued placement at St. Elizabeths. This assessment \nshould be conducted with input from the patient’s treatment team, the patient’s \nattorney, and/or the protection and advocacy agency for the District.   \nc.  Evaluate all patients for community placement, conduct a risk assessment, identify \npotential community-based supports that build on existing systems of care, and \nthen, whenever possible, recommend release.   \nd.  Implement release recommendations from the assessment team consistent with \npublic health guidelines for quarantining and isolating patients who may have been \nexposed to COVID-19. \ne.  Develop a staffing contingency plan that includes employing sufficient qualified \ntemporary  staff  to  ensure  adequate  infection  control  and  that  patients  receive \nnecessary treatment and care in light of staffing shortages. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-1   Filed 04/18/20   Page 41 of 43\n  2.  To the extent continued placement at St. Elizabeths is the only reasonable option for \nsome individuals, the Court should order Defendants to: \na.  Provide appropriate COVID-19 intervention and care at the Hospital, including (i) \nevaluating patients and where appropriate administering rapid COVID-19 tests; \n(ii)  ensuring  clinically  effective  isolation  and  quarantine  for  patients  with \nconfirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases; and (iii) determining equipment needs \nand immediately providing masks for any individuals displaying or reporting \nCOVID-19 symptoms or exposure until they can be evaluated by a qualified \nmedical professional or placed in quarantine;  \nb.  Ensure that each patient has timely and complete access to essential hygiene, \nincluding  soap,  hand  sanitizer,  and  running  water,  and  materials  needed  to \ndisinfect surfaces that may be contaminated; \nc.  Develop capacity for patients, who are not infected and for whom release is not \npossible, to be housed in an auxiliary facility until the density at St. Elizabeths is \nsufficiently  reduced  to  allow  for  social  distancing,  and  implement  social \ndistancing in accordance with public health guidelines. \nd.  Ensure robust education about COVID-19 for patients, including education about \nhow to identify symptoms, how to take preventative measures, how to contact \npatient advocates, and about any changes in policies and practices at the Hospital. \nThere should be sufficient opportunity to ask and receive answers to questions.  \n3.  The conditions at Saint Elizabeths are also causing irreparable harm to the Plaintiffs.  \nAll patients at Saint Elizabeths are, by definition, in need of psychiatric care.  Yet during this crisis, \nDefendants  have  ceased  providing  key  components  of  that  care  and  are  not  systematically \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-1   Filed 04/18/20   Page 42 of 43\nproviding  alternatives  that  can  be  implemented  consistent  with  COVID-19  public  health \nguidelines, such as virtual or telemedicine alternatives.  To remedy this, the Court should order \nDefendants to conduct individual assessments of each patient, with input from the patient’s \ntreatment team, the patient’s attorney, and/or other supportive decision makers as determined by \nthe patient, to assess the effects of the stress and trauma of the current COVID-19 pandemic and \nthe repercussions that Defendants’ deprivation of appropriate mental health services has had on \nthe patient’’ mental health status.  If the assessment determines that changes to a patient’s treatment \nplans are needed, such changes should be implemented immediately. \n4.  Finally, the Court should order that the Defendants provide the Court and Plaintiffs with \ndaily reports to ensure that the measures laid out in the Court’s order are being followed.  To that \nend, the daily report should include (i) the daily census of patients, (ii) the number of admissions, \n(iii)  the  number  of  individualized  assessments  completed,  (iv)  the  number  of  patients  the \nassessment team has recommended released and the number of patients recommended for release \nor change in treatment, as well as any instance where the recommendation for release or treatment \nhas not been implemented, (v) for any patient remaining in the facility, their COVID-19 status and \ntheir quarantine or isolation status, (vi) the daily staff census, and (vii) all complaints reported to \nthe Hospital’s patient advocate. \nDated:  April 16, 2020      Respectfully submitted, \n/s/ John A.

I have over 35 years of experience managing the provision of services to people \nwith intellectual and behavioral health disabilities, including managing public sector psychiatric \nhospitals in Massachusetts, Maine, and the District Columbia. \n2.  I currently serve as the court-appointed Independent Reviewer in United States v. \n \nGeorgia, Civ. Action No. 1:10-CV-249-CAP, overseeing implementation of a federal consent \ndecree requiring the development of integrated community-based services and supports as \nalternatives to institutionalization for individuals with developmental disabilities and/or mental \nillness in the State of Georgia. \n3.  From 2004 until 2017, I served as the Court Monitor in Evans v. Bowser, Civ. \nAction No.  76-293, a federal class action lawsuit concerning the care and treatment of people \nwith intellectual and developmental disabilities in the District of Columbia. As Court Monitor, I \noversaw and reported on implementation of court orders related to the development of \ncommunity-based, individualized services/supports for former residents of the District- operated \nForest Haven institution (now closed) for children and adults with intellectual and/or \ndevelopmental disabilities. \n4.  From 2001 until 2004, I was the Senior Planner for the District of Columbia’s \nnewly formed Department of Mental Health, where I was responsible for planning systemic \ninitiatives that improve the quality of care/treatment for individuals with serious mental illness. \n5.  I was the Hospital Director for St. Elizabeths Hospital from February 1998 \nthrough April 2000. I then became the Chief Operating Officer for the District of Columbia’s \nCommission on Mental Health Services while it was under federal court receivership. \n  1 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-2   Filed 04/18/20   Page 2 of 18\n6.  I have reviewed the April 16, 2020 Amended Complaint in Costa v. Bazron, \nNo 1:19-cv-3185 (RMD)(DDC) and the declarations of Hadley Truettner, Ashley Guzman, \nWanda Rose, Penelope Donkar and Danielle Mason. \nPatients at St. Elizabeths Hospital \n \n7.  Individuals who have been admitted to St. Elizabeths Hospital have serious and \npersistent mental illness and have been determined by the District to need intensive inpatient care \nto support their recovery. \n8.  Admission to a psychiatric institution is a serious decision that seeks to prevent or \nameliorate harm; enable an individual to return to a productive life as a member of his or her \ncommunity; and provide a dignified, respectful and supportive environment characterized by \nstability, security, and generally accepted standards of individualized treatment, continuity of \ncare, professionalism, health, and safety.  Institutionalization should be a last resort when \ncommunity supports are not sufficient and as short as is necessary to provide treatment of care \nthat would permit the individual to live in a more integrated setting. \n9.  To achieve these goals, the hospital setting must be safe, calm, predictable in its \nroutine, and responsive to each individual’s needs for treatment. \n10.  An environment that is chaotic, unpredictable, and unsafe, and in which patients \nare not receiving individualized, continuous, intensive treatment risks traumatizing people \nfurther and exacerbating the psychiatric needs that were the basis for their admission. \n11.  Since institutionalization in a psychiatric facility restricts self-determination, \nfreedom of movement, curtailment of access to social networks and integration into community- \nbased settings and activities, delays in the treatment of a psychiatric illness in this setting can \nresult in feelings of isolation, feelings of hopelessness, despair and increased stress/anxiety. \n  2 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-2   Filed 04/18/20   Page 3 of 18\n12.  The failure to provide safety, security, predictability, and continuity of care is \ncounter to effective treatment and results in fear of harm and actual harm, including regression, \nloss of self-esteem, and exacerbation of distress and heightened instability, leading to longer \nlengths of hospitalization and the likelihood of more restrictive measures, such as loss of \nprivileges or the use of seclusion and/or restraints. \nEffects of Current Conditions at St. Elizabeths Hospital \n \n13.  As reported to me in the declarations cited above, patients at St. Elizabeths are not \nreceiving their regular psychiatric care. Patients are confined to their units and their rooms and \nare unable to attend regularly scheduled therapy. Patients have not been provided with any \nconsistent alternative virtual or telephonic therapy.   \n14.  It is my understanding that treatment planning meetings, observation of the \nimplementation of treatment plans, requisite documentation, and other expected activities and \noversight are not able to take place because of the chaotic situation created by COVID-19. \n15.  It is my understanding that patients at Saint Elizabeths Hospital are not able to \nmaintain six feet of distance between themselves and other people (“social distancing”) and are \nsharing common space with other patients and staff on their Units.  It is my understanding, based \non the documents I have reviewed, that patients are not being tested for COVID-19 rapidly; \nasymptomatic patients are not being quarantined or isolated from patients who have tested \npositive for COVID-19 or who have been exposed to COVID-19; and that there are large staff \nabsences from Saint Elizabeths.  \n16.  The conditions at St. Elizabeths Hospital, as described to me, are a clear risk to \nhealth and safety. They are drastic deterrents to treatment, recovery and timely discharge. They \nrisk traumatizing patients and exacerbating symptoms of mental illness and inevitably will result \n  3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-2   Filed 04/18/20   Page 4 of 18\nin long lasting, if not permanent, damage to the individuals and their efforts at recovery.  \nWithout a doubt, these circumstances violate professional standards of care and treatment.  \nRemedy \n \n17.  The current conditions at St. Elizabeths Hospital, as described to me, are \nshockingly unacceptable and immediate action needs to be taken to prevent further harm. Based \non my experience managing the provision of treatment to individuals with mental illness in the \nDistrict, including at St. Elizabeths Hospital, and elsewhere, I recommend the following steps be \ntaken: \na.  Cease all admissions to the Hospital until the density at St. Elizabeths is \nsufficiently reduced to allow for social distancing. \nb.  Ensure that each patient has a treatment plan to mitigate the trauma of the \ncurrent conditions. \nc.  The Medical Director at Saint Elizabeths Hospital should conduct \nindividual assessments of patients with input from the patients’ treatment team, his/her attorney, \nand/or other supportive decision makers as determined by patient choice to assess the effects of \nthe stress and trauma of the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, and the repercussions \nDefendants’ deprivation of appropriate mental health services has had on patients’ mental health \nstatus and determine if changes to individual patients’ treatment plans are needed and implement \nany changes and recommendations from the individualized assessments immediately. \nd.  The Medical Director at St. Elizabeths Hospital should conduct an \nindividualized assessment of each patient to assess the current effect of these conditions on the \npatient and determine whether other options exist in lieu of continued placement at St. \nElizabeths. This assessment should be conducted with input from the patient’s treatment team, \n  4 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-2   Filed 04/18/20   Page 5 of 18\nhis/her attorney, and/or the protection and advocacy agency for the District.   \ne.  The assessment team, as described above, should evaluate all patients for \ncommunity placement, conduct a risk assessment, identify potential community-based supports \nthat build on existing systems of care, and then, whenever possible, recommend release.  \nf.  In making this determination, the Medical Director must consider a full \nrange of alternative treatment options, including those currently or potentially available in the \ncommunity. \ng.  Some individuals may be able to be discharged to a community setting \nwith support, for example, from an Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) Team or other \ncommunity-based supports. \nh.  Action should be taken in each case in a timely manner. All assessments \nmust be completed within 48 hours and the recommendations from the assessments must be \nimplemented immediately. \ni.  Under no circumstances should an individual be transferred to a nursing \nhome or jail. \nj.  If continued placement at St. Elizabeths is the only reasonable option, then \nthe following should occur: \ni.  Provide appropriate COVID-19 intervention and care at the Hospital \nwith teams of medical professionals and infection experts who can: \na.  Develop, update, and implement best practices for reducing \nthe infection rates at Saint Elizabeths Hospital, including \nproviding appropriate and accessible guidance to staff and \npatients; \n  5 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-2   Filed 04/18/20   Page 6 of 18\nb.  Administer rapid COVID-19 tests for anyone displaying \nknown symptoms of COVID-19 or who has been exposed \nto someone with known symptoms or who has tested \npositive for COVID-19; \nc.  Ensure segregation of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 \ncases; \nd.  Determine equipment needs and immediately provide \nmasks for any individual displaying or reporting COVID-\n19 symptoms or exposure until they can be evaluated by a \nqualified medical professional or placed in quarantine; \ne.  Ensure that each patient has timely and complete access to \nessential hygiene; \nf.  Provide on-site care and medical assessment, including \nmedical care and therapy that is appropriate for each \nindividual’s needs. \nii.  Develop capacity for patients, who are not infected and for whom \nrelease is not possible, to be housed in an auxiliary facility until the \ndensity at St. Elizabeths is sufficiently reduced to allow for social \ndistancing, and implement social distancing in accordance with public \nhealth guidelines. \niii.  Frequently communicate with patients to provide information about \nCOVID-19, reducing the risk of transmission, and any changes in \npolicies or practices. \n  6 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-2   Filed 04/18/20   Page 7 of 18\niv.  Ensure robust education to patients, including sufficient opportunity to \nask and receive answers to questions about COVID-19, how to identify \nsymptoms, and how to take preventative measures. \nv.  Ensure expedited access to both independent and internal patient \nadvocates in order to address any patient concerns about their medical \ncare or the conditions in the Hospital.    \nvi.  Assigned dedicated staff to each Unit and do not move staff between \nUnits except to comply with public health recommendations regarding \nthe segregation of people with COVID-19 symptoms, exposure, or \npositive tests so that patients develop a relationship with the staff \nperson who is caring for them. \nvii.  Ensure patients are able to go outside daily and recreate while \nmaintaining appropriate social distance.   \n18.  Develop a staffing contingency plan that includes employing sufficient qualified \ntemporary staff to ensure adequate infection control and that patients receive necessary treatment \nand care in light of staffing shortages. \n19.  Provide daily reporting to the Plaintiffs’ attorneys about the number of patients, \ntheir COVID-19 status, their quarantine status, the number of staff who reported to work, the \nnumber of restraint and seclusion events (including medical restraint), and all complaints \nreported to the Hospital’s patient advocate. \n20.  The Court should continue to provide oversight until these damaging and utterly \nsubstandard circumstances have ended. A timetable should be agreed upon and penalties should \nbe assessed if the timelines are not met. \n  7 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-2   Filed 04/18/20   Page 8 of 18\nI declare, under penalty of perjury, that the forgoing is true and correct.

MARC STERN, MD MPH\n \nOn this 17th day of April, 2020, I hereby declare: \n \n1.  My name is Marc Stern. I am a board-certified internist specializing in health care \nfor incarcerated populations. I have managed health care operations and practiced health care in \nmultiple correctional settings. Most recently, I served as the Assistant Secretary of Health Care \nfor the Washington State Department of Corrections.  \n2.  My experience includes the delivery of health care services to prisoners \nwith serious mental illness and/or chronic medical conditions. The Washington State Corrections \ncurrently system has 19,000 prisoners. Each of its major institutions provides mental health \nservices. Several of the facilities in the system deliver temporary or short-term in-patient \npsychiatric care for crisis management and stabilization. If higher level chronic mental health care is \nrequired, it is provided in specialized residential mental health treatment units. \n3.  I received a Bachelor of Science degree from State University of New \nYork (Albany) in 1975, a medical degree from State University of New York (Buffalo) in 1982, \nand a Master of Public Health from Indiana University (Bloomington) in 1992. I am an Affiliate \nAssistant Professor at the University of Washington School of Public Health. \n4.  On a regular basis, I investigate, evaluate, and monitor the adequacy of \nhealth care delivery systems in correctional institutions on behalf of a variety of parties including \nfederal courts. My prior experience includes working with the Office of Civil Rights and Civil \nLiberties of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; the Special Litigation Section of the \nCivil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice; and state departments of corrections and \ncounty jails. \n5.  Through 2013, I taught the National Commission on Correctional Health \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-3   Filed 04/18/20   Page 2 of 18\nCare’s (NCCHC) correctional health care standards semi-annually to correctional health care \nadministrators at NCCHC’s national conferences. I authored a week-long curriculum \ncommissioned by the National Institute of Corrections of the U.S. Department of Justice to train \njail and prison wardens and health care administrators in the principles and practice of operating \nsafe and effective correctional health care operations, and served as the principal instructor for this \ncourse. \n6.  In the past four years alone, I have been qualified as an expert in several \njurisdictions on correctional health care systems and conditions of confinement. My full curriculum \nvitae is attached hereto as Exhibit A. \n \n7.  I am not receiving payment in exchange for providing this affidavit to the \nWashington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs regarding appropriate \nhealthcare measures during the COVID-19 pandemic for institutionalized populations. In light of \nthe emergency conditions occurring in institutions across the country, I am providing my services \npro bono. \n8.  I am familiar with the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 from a clinical \nperspective, including its causes and conditions, its transmission – especially in crowded and \nunsanitary conditions – and its ability to quickly spread through congregate settings. \n9.  In the context of a pandemic like the one we currently face, public health and \npublic safety interests are closely intertwined. When and if staffing challenges arise due to the \nneed for staff to quarantine, seek treatment, or care for dependents, managing internal safety in \ninstitutional settings becomes even more challenging. Understaffing is dangerous for staff as well \nas institutionalized people. \n10.  I have reviewed the April 16, 2020 Amended Complaint in Costa v. Bazron, \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-3   Filed 04/18/20   Page 3 of 18\nNo 1:19-cv-3185(RMD)(DDC) and the declarations of Danielle Mason, Ashley Guzman, Hadley \nTruettner, Penelope Donkar, William Dunbar, Enzo Costa, Vinita Smith, and Wanda Rose.  \n11.  I have also reviewed the April 15, 2020 Mayor’s Order 2020-063, Extensions \nof Public Health Emergency and Public Health Emergency and Measures to Protect Vulnerable \nPopulations During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency.   \n12.  Assuming the facts described are true, the patients and staff at St. Elizabeth’s \nHospital are placed at an imminent and heightened risk from COVID-19 due to dangerous \nconditions, including but possibly not limited to: failure to ensure safe distancing between \nresidents along with failure to provide them with masks, failure to provide adequate soap for \nhand hygiene, failure to place persons with suspected or proven COVID-19 infection in isolation \nor effective isolation, and failure to place persons who have had close contact with person \nsuspected or proven to have COVID-19 in isolation in a timely manner. \n13.  Institutional settings are congregate environments where people live, eat, and \nsleep closely together. In these environments, infections like COVID-19 can spread more rapidly. \nDownsizing institutional populations serves two critical public health aims: (1) targeting \nresidents who are at elevated risk of suffering from severe symptoms of COVID-19; and (2) \nallowing those who remain confined to better maintain social distancing and avoid other risks \nassociated with forced communal living. Because vulnerable populations are at the highest risk \nof severe complications from COVID-19, and because when they develop severe complications \nthey will be transported to community hospitals—thereby using scarce community \nresources (ER beds, general hospital beds, ICU beds)—avoiding disease in this population is a \ncritical contribution to public health overall. \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-3   Filed 04/18/20   Page 4 of 18\n14.  Thoughtful downsizing that weighs all the risks to the health of the individual as \nwell as all risks the risks to public safety and public health, should be implemented in tandem \nwith aggressive, responsive prevention measures that are developed and guided by public health \nand medical experts. Downsizing will help to “flatten the curve” overall—both within the \ninstitution and without. While prioritization should be given to those who are medically at-risk \nfor complications of the virus, release of any individual contributes to reducing viral spread, as it \nis becoming clear that younger individuals are not protected from severe complications requiring \nhospitalization and placement in intensive care. \n15.  Downsizing of any congregate setting will reduce the risk of spread of virus. \nGiven the aforementioned lapses in preventive measures, the value of downsizing is even greater. \n16.  At the same time authorities work to downsize the Hospital population where safe, \nit is critical that the D.C. Department of Behavioral Health immediately undertake or continue \nthe following prevention and planning measures, some of which are not covered by the Mayor’s \nExecutive Order 2020-063: \na.  Implement guidance from the Center for Disease Control regarding \nInfection Prevention and Control (CDC) for COVID 19.  The D.C. Department of \nHealth must continually update its practices to align with the current CDC guidance, \nmodified, as necessary to account for local conditions.. \nb. Immediate testing. Patients who require testing, based on public health \nrecommendations and the opinion of a qualified medical professional, should be tested for \nCOVID-19. \nc.  Immediate screening. Authorities must be required to screen each employee \nor other person entering the facility every day to according to current CDC or local health \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-3   Filed 04/18/20   Page 5 of 18\ndepartment guidelines A record should be made of each screening. \nd. Quarantine and Isolation. The Hospital must establish clinically effective \nquarantine for all individuals believed to have been exposed to COVID-19, but are not yet \nsymptomatic, and clinically effective isolation for those believed to be infected with \nCOVID-19 and potentially infectious. Any individual who must interact with those \npotentially or likely infected with COVID-19 must utilize protective equipment, including \nmasks, as directed by public health authorities. In short, every possible effort must be made \nto separate infected or potentially infected individuals from the rest of the confined \npopulation. Once individuals have been potentially infected, they should be quarantined \nfor an appropriate period of time and during that time period no new individual should be \nadded to the quarantined cohort.  Individuals requiring continued quarantine, isolation, or \nhealth care after release should be transferred from the institution to the appropriate \noutside venue. \ne.  Institutional Hygiene. The Hospital must be required to provide adequate \nsanitation of high use/high touch areas and rooms and bathrooms in accordance with \nCDC or local health authority guidelines. This includes a prompt way to dispose of \ntissues used by patients as well as staff. \nf.  Personal Hygiene. The Hospital must be required to provide hand soap, \ndisposable paper towels, and access to water to allow residents to wash their hands on a \nregular basis.  Hospital staff should be allowed to carry hand sanitizer with alcohol on \ntheir person, and residents should be allowed to use hand sanitizer with alcohol – under \nsupervision if necessary – when they are in locations or activities where hand washing is \nnot available. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-3   Filed 04/18/20   Page 6 of 18\ng. Access to treatment. It is critical that patients have rapid access to responsive \nmedical treatment. Those with a cough should be provided masks as soon as they inform \nstaff of this symptom or staff notice this symptom. \n17.  The measures I propose above are baseline steps to help slow the spread of \nCOVID-19 in all facilities. However, each facility has its own unique combination of physical \nstructure and layout, operations, policies, logistics, inmate characteristics, and staffing factors \nthat determine what additional measures may be necessary to minimize the spread of COVID-19. \nOnly a health expert who is able to review a particular facility firsthand can account for all of \nthose factors and provide a meaningful and facility-specific opinion about what additional \nmeasures are necessary to reduce the risk of transmission. \n18.  I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \n \n \n \n \n \nExecuted on April 17 2020 \n \n \n \n \nMarc Stern, MD MPH \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-3   Filed 04/18/20   Page 7 of 18\nMARC F.

Jonathan Louis Golob, declare as follows: \n1.  I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan School of Medicine in Ann \nArbor, Michigan, where I am a specialist in infectious diseases and internal medicine. I \nam also a member of the Physicians for Human Rights. At the University of Michigan \nSchool of Medicine, I am a practicing physician and a laboratory-based scientist. My \nprimary subspecialization is for infections in immunocompromised patients, and my \nrecent scientific publications focus on how microbes affect immunocompromised people. \nI obtained my medical degree and completed my residency at the University of \nWashington School of Medicine in Seattle, Washington, and also completed a Fellowship \nin Internal Medicine Infectious Disease at the University of Washington. I am actively \ninvolved in the planning and care for patients with COVID-19. Attached as Exhibit A is a \ncopy of my curriculum vitae. \n2.  COVID-19 is an infection caused by a novel zoonotic coronavirus SARS-COV-2 that has \nbeen identified as the cause of a viral outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China in \nDecember 2019. The World Health Organization has declared that COVID-19 is causing \na pandemic. As of April 2, 2020, there are over 800,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 \nworldwide. COVID-19 has caused over 45,000 deaths, with exponentially growing \noutbreaks occurring at multiple sites worldwide, including within the United States in \nregions like New York, New Jersey, Louisiana, Michigan and Illinois. \n3.  COVID-19 makes certain populations of people severely ill. People over the age of fifty \nare at higher risk, with those over 70 at serious risk. As the Center for Disease Control \nand Prevention has advised, certain medical conditions increase the risk of serious \nCOVID-19 for people of any age. These medical conditions include: those with lung \ndisease, heart disease, diabetes, or immunocompromised (such as from cancer, HIV, \nautoimmune diseases), blood disorders (including sickle cell disease), chronic liver or \nkidney disease, inherited metabolic disorders, stroke, developmental delay, or pregnancy. \n4.  For all people, even in advanced countries with very effective health care systems such as \nthe Republic of Korea, the case fatality rate of this infection is about ten fold higher than \nthat observed from a severe seasonal influenza. In the more vulnerable groups, both the \nneed for care, including intensive care, and death is much higher than we observe from \ninfluenza infection: In the highest risk populations, the case fatality rate is about 15%. \nFor high risk patients who do not die from COVID-19, a prolonged recovery is expected \nto be required, including the need for extensive rehabilitation for profound \nPage 1 of 4 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-4   Filed 04/18/20   Page 2 of 4\ndeconditioning, loss of digits, neurologic damage, and loss of respiratory capacity that \ncan be expected from such a severe illness. \n5.  In most people, the virus causes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. In high-risk \nindividuals as noted above, this shortness of breath can often be severe. Even in younger \nand healthier people, infection of this virus requires supportive care, which includes \nsupplemental oxygen, positive pressure ventilation, and in extreme cases, extracorporeal \nmechanical oxygenation. \n6.  The incubation period (between infection and the development of symptoms) for \nCOVID-19 is typically 5 days, but can vary from as short as two days to an infected \nindividual never developing symptoms. There is evidence that transmission can occur \nbefore the development of infection and from infected individuals who never develop \nsymptoms. Thus, only with aggressive testing for SARS-COV-2 can a lack of positive \ntests establish a lack of risk for COVID-19. \n7.  When a community or institution lacks a comprehensive and rigorous testing regime, a \nlack of proven cases of COVID-19 is functionally meaningless for determining if there is \na risk for COVID-19 transmission in a community or institution. \n8.  Most people in the higher risk categories will require more advanced support: positive \npressure ventilation, and in extreme cases, extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation. Such \ncare requires highly specialized equipment in limited supply as well as an entire team of \ncare providers, including but not limited to 1:1 or 1:2 nurse to patient ratios, respiratory \ntherapists and intensive care physicians. This level of support can quickly exceed local \nhealth care resources. \n9.  COVID-19 can severely damage the lung tissue, requiring an extensive period of \nrehabilitation and in some cases a permanent loss of respiratory capacity. The virus also \nseems to target the heart muscle itself, causing a medical condition called mycocarditis, \nor inflammation of the heart muscle. Myocarditis can affect the heart muscle and \nelectrical system, which reduces the heart's ability to pump, leading to rapid or abnormal \nheart rhythms in the short term, and heart failure that limits exercise tolerance and the \nability to work lifelong. There is emerging evidence that the virus can trigger an \nover-response by the immune system in infected people, further damaging tissues. This \ncytokine release syndrome can result in widespread damage to other organs, including \npermanent injury to the kidneys (leading to dialysis dependence) and neurologic injury. \nPage 2 of 4 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-4   Filed 04/18/20   Page 3 of 4\n10. There is no cure and vaccine for this infection. Unlike influenza, there is no known \neffective antiviral medication to prevent or treat infection from COVID-19. Experimental \ntherapies are being attempted. The only known effective measures to reduce the risk for a \nvulnerable person from injury or death from COVID-19 are to prevent individuals from \nbeing infected with the COVID-19 virus. Social distancing, or remaining physically \nseparated from known or potentially infected individuals, and hygiene, including washing \nwith soap and water, are the only known effective measures for protecting vulnerable \ncommunities from COVID-19. \n11. Nationally, without effective public health interventions, CDC projections indicate about \n200 million people in the United States could be infected over the course of the epidemic, \nwith as many as 1.5 million deaths in the most severe projections. Effective public health \nmeasures, including social distancing and hygiene for vulnerable populations, could \nreduce these numbers. \n12. In early March, the highest known person-to-person transmission rates for COVID-19 \nwere in a skilled nursing facility in Kirkland, Washington and on afflicted cruise ships in \nJapan and off the coast of California. More recently, the highest transmission rates have \nbeen recorded in the Rikers Island jail complex in New York City, which is over seven \ntimes the rate of transmission compared to the spread in New York City. To illustrate, the \nnumber of confirmed cases among inmates soared from one to nearly 200 in the matter of \n12 days. \n13. This is consistent with the spread of previous viruses in congregate settings. During the \nH1N1 influenza (\"Swine Flu\") epidemic in 2009, jails and prisons were sites of severe \noutbreaks of viral infection. Given the avid spread of COVID-19 in skilled nursing \nfacilities and cruise ships, it is reasonable to expect COVID-19 will also readily spread in \ndetention centers such as prisons and jails, particularly when residents cannot engage in \nsocial distancing measures, cannot practice proper hygiene, and cannot isolate themselves \nfrom infected residents or staff. With new individuals and staff coming into the detention \ncenters who may be asymptomatic or not yet presenting symptoms, the risk of infection \nrises even with symptom screening measures. \n14. This information provides many reasons to conclude that vulnerable people, people over \nthe age of 50 and people of any age with lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, or \nimmunocompromised (such as from cancer, HIV, autoimmune diseases), blood disorders \n(including sickle cell disease), chronic liver or kidney disease, inherited metabolic \ndisorders, stroke, developmental delay, or pregnancy living in an institutional setting, \nsuch as a prison, or jail, or an immigration detention center, with limited access to \nPage 3 of 4 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-4   Filed 04/18/20   Page 4 of 4\nadequate hygiene facilities, limited ability to physically distance themselves from others, \nand exposure to potentially infected individuals from the community are at grave risk of \nsevere illness and death from COVID-19. \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and \ncorrect. \nExecuted this  3  day in April, 2020 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. \nDr. Jonathan Louis Golob \nPage 4 of 4 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-5   Filed 04/18/20   Page 1 of 2\nDECLARATION OF HADLEY TRUETTNER \nSTAFF ATTORNEY AT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER SERVICE \nI, Hadley Truettner, certify under penalty of perjury that the following statement is true and \ncorrect pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746.  \n1.  My name is Hadley Truettner. I make these statements based upon my personal \nknowledge.  \n2.  I am a staff attorney in the Mental Health Division at the Public Defender Service for the \nDistrict of Columbia (hereinafter “PDS”) and have served in this role since January of \n1995. PDS is a federally funded, independent organization dedicated to representing \nindigent adults and children facing the loss of liberty in the District of Columbia. My \nprincipal responsibilities as a staff attorney at PDS are to represent both persons facing \ncivil commitment and persons committed to the Department of Behavioral Health as a \nresult of a not guilty by reason of insanity finding. \n3.  In the course of my work, I regularly speak to clients who are admitted to locked \npsychiatric wards in area hospitals, including Psychiatric Institute of Washington, \nUnited Medical Center, Washington Hospital Center and the Veteran’s Affairs Medical \nCenter and Saint Elizabeths Hospital (hereinafter “SEH”), their family members, their \nguardians, and their treating doctors and treatment teams. Through those conversations, I \nlearned the following:  \nDuring an April 9, 2020 email correspondence with a social worker in an area \nhospital, I learned my client’s treatment plan is to be transferred to Saint \nElizabeths Hospital for long term care.  Surprised that Saint Elizabeths would be \naccepting clients given the COVID-19 outbreak at the hospital, I inquired whether \nSaint Elizabeths is really accepting new patients.  The social worker responded, \n“They are accepting patients.”   \n4.  In a follow up email to Dr. Philip Candilis, Director of Medical Affairs at Saint \nElizabeths Hospital on the morning of Friday, April 10.  I explained that I have a client \nin an area hospital whom that hospital intends to transfer to Saint Es.  I inquired as \nfollows: \n“The social worker [from the area hospital] indicated that Saint Es is accepting \npatients.  Can you confirm?  Thanks very much.”  \nDr. Candilis responded later that morning: “Yes, confirmed.” \n5.   On April 13, 2020, I had a conversation with a different social worker at the same area \nhospital regarding another client’s long-term plan.  The social worker indicated that my \nclient will be transferred to Saint Elizabeths.  I wrote the following question: \n“Is Saint Es currently taking folks?”  \n  1 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-5   Filed 04/18/20   Page 2 of 2\nThe social worker responded, “Yes its [Saint Elizabeths] moving slowly but they \nare currently accepting.” \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the foregoing is true \nand correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.  \nExecuted on the 16th day of April 2020 in Washington, D.C. \nHadley Truettner \n______________________________ \nHadley Truettner \nStaff Attorney \nPublic Defender Service, MHD \n633 Indiana Avenue Ave, NW \nWashington DC 20004 \n  2 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-6   Filed 04/18/20   Page 1 of 2\n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-6   Filed 04/18/20   Page 2 of 2\n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-7   Filed 04/18/20   Page 1 of 2\n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-7   Filed 04/18/20   Page 2 of 2\n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-8   Filed 04/18/20   Page 1 of 1\n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-9   Filed 04/18/20   Page 1 of 3\nDECLARATION OF ASHLEY GUZMAN \nSTAFF ATTORNEY AT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER SERVICE \nI, Ashley Guzman, certify under penalty of perjury that the following statement is true and \ncurrent pursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1746. \n \n1.  My name is Ashley Guzman.  I make these statements based upon my personal \nknowledge. \n \n2.  I am a staff attorney in the Mental Health Division at the Public Defender Service for the \nDistrict of Columbia and have served in this role since April 2015.  PDS is a federally \nfunded, independent organization dedicated to representing indigent adults and children \nfacing the loss of liberty in the District of Columbia.  My principal responsibilities as a \nstaff attorney at PDS are to represent both persons facing civil commitment and persons \ncommitted to the Department of Behavioral Health as a result of a not guilty by reason of \ninsanity finding, and to consult with attorneys in various other divisions of PDS as a \nmental health litigation specialist. \n \n3.  In the course of my work, I regularly speak to clients who are committed to Saint \nElizabeths Hospital (hereinafter “Hospital”).  Specifically on April 15, 2020, I spoke with \nclients at the Hospital and through those conversations, I learned the following: \n \na.  I learned about conditions on Unit 2TR of the Hospital. I learned that Unit 2TR \nwas originally designated as the Hospital’s quarantine unit.  All patients on the \nunit tested positive for COVID-19. There are only seven patient beds on the unit.  \nHowever, once COVID-19 spread throughout nearly all of the other units in the \nHospital, at least one COVID-19 positive and symptomatic patient was \ntransferred to another unit in the Hospital.  The receiving unit houses patients who \nhave not tested positive for COVID-19.    Regarding the conditions of Unit 2TR, I \nlearned that all patients were provided with masks, but no other personal \nprotective equipment.  Patients were given new masks every day. All staff wore \nmasks and full protective suits. Bottles of hand sanitizer were provided to \npatients.  The patients were housed in their own rooms with their own bathrooms.  \nThe bathrooms were stocked with hand soap.  Staff did the patients’ laundry once \nper week. The common areas of Unit 2TR were sanitized daily, but the patients’ \nbedrooms and bathrooms were not.  Patients had to request to have their \nbedrooms and bathrooms sanitized. Patients were not provided with any cleaning \nmaterials to clean their own bedrooms and bathrooms.  Staff in full personal \nprotective gear delivered all meals and medications to the patients’ individual \nbedrooms.  During the day, patients were restricted to their rooms, but were \nallowed to go to Unit 2TR’s balcony once per day for up to thirty minutes.  Staff \npermitted only one patient on the balcony at a time. \n \nb.  I learned about the conditions on Unit 2B of the Hospital.  I learned that there are \nabout 27 patients on the unit.  Some of the patients on Unit 2B have tested \npositive for COVID-19, but not all.  Not all of the patients have masks to wear. \nAs of April 15, 2020, there were at least four patients without masks on the unit \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-9   Filed 04/18/20   Page 2 of 3\ndue to a mask shortage.  Patients are provided new masks only every three days.  \nAll staff on Unit 2B wear masks at all times, but no other personal protective \nequipment.  Unlike Unit 2TR, the patients are not provided with bottles of hand \nsanitizer.  There is hand sanitizer behind the nurse’s station, but the patients have \nto approach the station to ask for sanitizer.  There are a couple of hand sanitizer \ndispensers on the unit, but the dispensers are often low on sanitizer.  On Unit 2B, \npatients have to do their own laundry on specific days.  However, the laundry \nroom remains locked at all times, and often patients miss their days to do their \nlaundry.  The common areas of Unit 2B are sanitized daily, but the patients’ \nbedrooms are not.  The patients are not provided with cleaning material to clean \ntheir own rooms, and must request to have their rooms sanitized. There are at least \nthree bedrooms with two patients in each room.  All meals are served in the unit \ncafeteria.  There is supposed to be a limit of 10 patients in the cafeteria at a time, \nbut when there are new staff members on the unit, this rule is not enforced. On the \nmorning of April 15, 2020, new staff members allowed more than 10 people in \nthe cafeteria to dine.  There is supposed to be a limit of two patients per table, but \non the morning of April 15, 2020, staff allowed at least four patients per table. \nSince the COVID-19 outbreak, staff are allowing patients to eat meals in the \ncommon area.  In order to receive medication, the patients must approach a \nmedication window and receive medication from staff. During the day, COVID-\n19 positive patients are not allowed to utilize off-the-unit privileges, but they are \nallowed to freely walk around the unit and watch television in the common areas.  \nPatients who are not symptomatic and/or have not tested positive for COVID-19 \nare permitted to watch television in the common area and share a couch with \nCOVID-19 positive patients. Staff members are not enforcing social distancing \nduring the day. \n \nc.  I learned about the conditions on Unit 2C of the Hospital.  I learned that during \nthe week of April 6, 2020, at least one patient presented with cold-like symptoms, \nbut that patient was not tested for COVID-19.  I learned that none of the patients \non Unit 2C had been tested for COVID-19.  The patients are not required to wear \nmasks.  If a patient asks for a mask, and if a mask is available, the staff will \nprovide the patient with a mask.  The patients are not provided with any other \npersonal protective equipment.  All staff members wear masks every day, but \nmost do not wear any other personal protective gear.  Some staff members wear \ngowns.  Hand sanitizer is only available behind the nurse’s station desk, and \npatients have to approach the nursing station to request sanitizer.  There are no \nhand sanitizer dispensers on Unit 2C.  The patients on Unit 2C share bathrooms.  I \nlearned that often at least two days go by before the staff realize that there is no \nhandsoap in the bathroom.  The patients on Unit 2C must do their own laundry or \ndesignated days, and must request that the laundry room be unlocked in order to \ndo laundry.  The common areas of the Unit 2C are sanitized daily, but the \npatients’ bedrooms are not.  The patients must request to have their bedrooms \nsanitized, and are not provided with cleaning material to clean their own \nbedrooms.  At least three of the bedrooms on Unit 2C have two patients in each \nroom.  Meals are served either in the dining room or in the common area of the \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-9   Filed 04/18/20   Page 3 of 3\nunit.  Eight patients are allowed in the dining room at a time, and two patients are \nallowed per dining table.  When patients dine in the common area, social \ndistancing is not enforced.  Due to the number of patients on the unit, and the size \nof the unit, keeping six feet away from other patients is nearly impossible on the \nunit.

My name is Wanda Rose. I make these statements based upon my personal knowledge. \n \n2. I have a Masters in Forensic Psychology and I work as  a program developer in the Mental \nHealth Division at the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia (hereinafter \n“PDS”). I have served in this role since September 21, 2003. PDS is a federally funded, \nindependent organization dedicated to representing indigent adults and children accused of \ncrimes in the District of Columbia. My principal responsibility as a program developer at \nPDS is to assist attorneys in my division with the social work aspects of their cases. \n \n3. As part of my duties as a program developer at PDS, I regularly speak to  clients who are \npending civil commitment proceedings and those who are committed at St. Elizabeths \nHospital (“SEH”). \n \n4. On April 15, 2020, I spoke to Client A, at SEH on the ward 1-G. \n \n5. From this conversation I learned the following: \n \nClient A had heard that nine people throughout SEH were COVID-19 \npositive. Client A had not heard of anyone on their ward being positive, and \nwas not aware of anyone being in quarantine. All patients are confined to the ward. \n \nClient A indicated that the safety protocols are inconsistently followed. \nMasks are available to patients on the ward; however patients have to request them. Some of \nthe SEH staff are wearing them, some are not. Some patients are wearing them, some are not. \nThey are not required. Client A said that some people don't like the masks, so they do not \nwear them. Patients can get a new mask but they must request one. Client A said some of the \nmasks are homemade, and they have seen SEH staff making masks out of pajamas. \nSome staff are wearing gloves, some are not. Client A said that if a staff is going \nto give something (i. e., gloves, mask, medication) to a patient, the staff will put on \ngloves to do this. Client A said no staff are wearing gowns of any kind. \n \nClient A indicated that cleaning seemed adequate. Soap and hand sanitizer are available \nupon request. Laundry services are available for patients to use during the day.  Client A said \nthe ward is professionally cleaned twice weekly. Patients are given supplies upon request and \nare able to clean their own rooms. \n \nClient A indicated that social distancing is inconsistently practiced. Patients are allowed out \nof their rooms. Patients are still congregating in the common areas (i. e., the TV room) of the \nward, with inadequate room for social distancing. Medication is still being given out at the \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-10   Filed 04/18/20   Page 2 of 2\nnurses' station, with patients lining up and limited room to social distance. Client A said they \nwait to get their own medication until everyone else has already gotten theirs, so they don't \nhave to wait in the line. Meals are still in the dining room on the ward. Patients are limited to \ntwo individuals per table, down from the usual four per table. Tables have been moved to six \nfeet apart. \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the foregoing is true \nand correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. \n \nExecuted on the 15th day of April 2020, in North Beach, Maryland. \n \n \n \nWanda Rose \n____________________________ \nProgram Developer \nPublic Defender Service for DC \n633 Indiana Ave. NW \nWashington, DC \n  2 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-11   Filed 04/18/20   Page 1 of 2\nDECLARATION OF DANIELLE MASON \nFORENSIC PROFESSIONAL COUNSELOR AT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER SERVICE \n \nI, Danielle Mason, certify under penalty of perjury that the following statement is true and \ncorrect pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746. \n \n1.  My name is Danielle Mason. I am a licensed professional counselor in the \nDistrict of Columbia. I make these statements based upon my personal \nknowledge. \n \n2.  I am a forensic professional counselor in the Mental Health Division at the Public \nDefender Service for the District of Columbia (hereinafter “PDS”) and have served in \nthis role since August 20, 2018. PDS is a federally funded, independent organization \ndedicated to representing indigent adults and children facing loss of liberty in the District \nof Columbia. \n \n3.  As part of my duties as a forensic professional counselor at PDS, I frequently conduct \nvisits and maintain regular contact with clients in the custody of St. Elizabeth’s Hospital. \n \n \n4.  During the pandemic, I have spoken to clients. Through those conversations, I learned the \nfollowing: \n \na.  On April 15, 2020, I spoke with Client A at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, unit 2C. While \nmasks are available, I learned that patients must ask for one from staff and some \npatients do not wear masks. New masks are provided to patients when they ask; \nalthough, never more than once per day. Staff are wearing masks, but I learned that \nsome of the masks appear to be homemade. Staff on 2C have not been wearing gowns, \nor other personal protection equipment, since April 13, 2020. I learned that patients \nmust ask staff to use hand sanitizer. I learned that the patients of 2C eat meals in the \ndining room and day room. All patients eat at the same time. Approximately 10 patients \ncan eat in the dining room;  the remainder eat in the day room. Most patients try to sit \nsix feet apart, but one of the tables is set up in such a way that causes two patients to \nbe back-to-back. I learned  that patients spend most of their days in their bedrooms \nor in the day room. Some patients continue to play Wii video games, watch television \nin close quarters and sleep on the couch in the day room. I learned that medications \non  2C  continue  to  be  administered from the medication room. Patients line up \nshoulder–to-shoulder three  times per day to receive their medications. \n \nb.  On April 15, 2020, I spoke with Client B at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, unit 2A. There \nare  approximately 27 patients assigned to 2A. 2A patients presumed to be  negative \nfor COVID-19 will moved off the unit and into the gymnasium today. I learned that \npatients on 2A are provided with masks, which were described as  paper thin and \neasily tear. I learned that patients do not have access to hand sanitizer, but there is \nsoap in the bathroom. Housekeeping wipes down the unit approximately twice daily. \nClient B could not recall the last time that patient bedrooms were cleaned by \nhousekeeping. I learned that patients on 2A eat in the dining room. Approximately \neight patients are allowed to eat at one time and eating times are staggered. I learned \nthat patients on 2A continue to receive medications from the medication room. \nPatients are encouraged to stand six feet apart, but often do not. I learned that patients \nwith pending COVID-19 test results are not confined to their rooms and their \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-11   Filed 04/18/20   Page 2 of 2\nmovements are not restricted on the unit. \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the foregoing is true \nand correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. \n \nExecuted on the 15th day of April 2020, in Washington, D.C. \n \n \n \n \n   \nDanielle Mason \nForensic Professional Counselor \nPublic Defender Service for DC \n633 Indiana Ave. NW \nWashington, D.C. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-12   Filed 04/18/20   Page 1 of 2\nDECLARATION OF PENELOPE DONKAR \nSTAFF ATTORNEY AT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER SERVICE \n \nI, Penelope Donkar, certify under penalty of perjury that the following statement is true and \ncorrect pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746. \n \n1.  My name is Penelope Donkar.  I make these statements based upon my personal \nknowledge. \n \n2.  I am a staff attorney in the Mental Health Division (hereinafter “MHD”) at the Public \nDefender Service for the District of Columbia (hereinafter “PDS”) and have served in \nthis role since June 2015. PDS is a federally funded, independent organization dedicated \nto representing indigent adults and children facing the loss of liberty in the District of \nColumbia.  My principal responsibilities as a staff attorney at PDS are to represent both \npersons facing civil commitment and persons committed to the Department of Behavioral \nHealth as a result of a not guilty by reason of insanity finding \n \n3.  In the course of my work, I regularly speak to clients who are committed to Saint \nElizabeths Hospital (hereinafter “Hospital”), their guardians, and their treating doctors.  \nThrough those conversations, I learned the following: \n \na.  Client A is an individual in care at St. Elizabeths Hospital.  On April 11, 2020, I \nreceived a voicemail from Client A indicating that client was being admitted to a \nmedical hospital with a fever.  On Monday April 13, 2020, a physician at \nGeorgetown Hospital contacted PDS for Client A’s guardian’s contact \ninformation.  The physician indicated that the guardian’s contact information was \nnot sent by St. Elizabeths with Client A.  Additionally, St. Elizabeths had not \ncontacted Client A’s guardian to inform him that Client A was suspected of \nhaving COVID-19, that client had been exposed to COVID-19 on the unit, or that \nclient was being admitted to a medical hospital with COVID-19.  St. Elizabeths \nalso did not inform me about Client A’s medical status despite a properly \nexecuted HIPAA waiver previously on file. \n \nb.  Client B is an individual in care at St. Elizabeths Hospital.  Client B is currently \ninpatient civilly committed.  Client B was tested for COVID-19 last week. \nFollowing that test, the treatment team refused to provide information about \nClient B’s COVID status despite a properly executed HIPAA waiver. Client B’s \nguardian was not notified of the COVID-19 status of the unit or that Client B was \nbeing tested for COVID-19. Guardian discovered the existence of COVID-19 at \nSt. Elizabeths after talking with the guardians of other individuals. \n \nc.  Client C was a patient on Unit 1B of St. Elizabeths.  On Monday, April 6, 2020, I \nlearned that my client, Client C, had been sent to George Washington University \nHospital with symptoms of COVID-19 when I attempted to set up a video \nconference with him.  At that time, he was awaiting COVID-19 test results.  \nDespite having an executed HIPAA waiver for Client C, the treatment team did \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 39-12   Filed 04/18/20   Page 2 of 2\nnot give me updates regarding Client C’s status.  I did not receive an update about \nClient C until I received notice on April 10, 2020 that Client C had died at \nGWUH. \n \n4.  I have been attempting to track the status and location of MHD’s clients who have tested \npositive while at St. Elizabeths.  Doing so has been difficult because Hospital staff has \noften refused to provide updates or disclose basic information about our clients upon \nrequest, even when there was a properly executed HIPAA waiver.  Of the 18 MHD \nclients that I have identified as being positive or presumptively positive, it is my \nunderstanding that 11 still remain on various units at the Hospital. \n \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the foregoing is true \nand correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. \n \n  Executed on the 17th day of April 2020 in Washington, D.C. \n \n \n_____________________________  \nPenelope Donkar \nStaff Attorney  \nPublic Defender Service for DC  \n633 Indiana Avenue NW  \nWashington, DC 20001 \n               \n  2 ",

Indeed, four St. Elizabeths patients have died of COVID-19 as of \nApril 15, 2020. \n  COVID-19, a highly communicable and potentially fatal virus, is \nspreading rapidly around the world, in the United States, and in the District of Columbia. As of \nApril 15, 2020, there were 605,390 cases and over 24,000 deaths attributable to COVID-19 \nreported in the United States.1 The District of Columbia has reported 2,350 cases of COVID-19 \nand at least 81 deaths, as of April 15, 2020.2 The World Health Organization (“WHO”) estimates \nthat as of April 15, 2020, there ae 1,991,562 confirmed cases, 130,885 confirmed deaths, and 213 \ncountries, areas, or territories with confirmed cases.3  \n \n1 CTRS.

As of April 1, 2020, there were 5 positive cases of COVID-19 among Saint Elizabeths \nHospital staff and 1 positive case among patients. By April 16, 2020, the Department of \nBehavioral Health reported that four Saint Elizabeths Hospital patients have died of coronavirus, \nand 32 patients and 47 staff at the Hospital have tested positive for COVID-19.   \n  Patients at Saint Elizabeths Hospital are at a heightened risk of \ncontracting, and are, in fact, dying from COVID-19 because of Defendants’ failure to follow \nprofessional guidance and appropriately plan and manage the facility during this global \npandemic.   \n   Despite clear guidance from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the \nD.C. Department of Health, and the Mayor’s orders, Defendants-respondents (hereafter simply \n“Defendants”) are not ensuring that patients at Saint Elizabeths Hospital are properly protected \nfrom the risk of contracting COVID-19.  Specifically: \n•  Patients at Saint Elizabeths Hospital are unable to properly practice social \ndistancing.   \n•  Symptomatic patients are not tested at all, or not tested in a timely matter. \n•  Symptomatic patients are not medically isolated from other patients who reside in \ntheir Unit.   \n•  Known or suspected cases of COVID-19 have generally not been transferred to \nother facilities where they can receive appropriate treatment. \n•  Patients who test positive for COVID-19 are not quarantined from other patients. \n•  The Hospital has continued to be open for new admittances.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 4 of 53\n \nDefendants’ lack of emergency planning and poor crisis management has caused the rapid and \ndeadly spread of COVID-19 at Saint Elizabeths Hospital.   \n  This is not the first time that Defendants’ lack of emergency planning and \npoor crisis management also placed hundreds of patients at risk.  As recently as October 2019, \nDefendants discovered that the Saint Elizabeths Hospital water supply was toxic and shut off the \nwater to the Hospital for 28 days.   \n  Plaintiffs-petitioners (hereafter simply “Plaintiffs”) Enzo Costa, Vinita \nSmith, Stefon Kirkpatrick, and William Dunbar are four of approximately 270 patients with \nmental health disabilities at Saint Elizabeths Hospital who were left without safe, running water \nfrom September 26, 2019 to October 24, 2019 and thereby exposed to irreparable harmful \nphysical, emotional, and mental health consequences.  They still reside there and now face the \nthreat of contracting COVID-19 as a consequence of Defendants’ failure to take appropriate \nprecautionary measures. \n  The 2019 water outage was the second time in three years that Saint \nElizabeths Hospital experienced a major and extended water outage. \n  The extended water outage directly impacted necessary patient medical \ncare.  Defendants closed the Treatment Mall, the location at the Hospital where treatment \nplanning meetings are held and patients receive group therapy, art therapy, and music therapy, \nand they curtailed or suspended a wide variety of therapy and other forms of psychiatric care on \nwhich Plaintiffs and members of the class depend and need to manage and maintain their mental \nhealth.  Patients were confined to their units and their rooms and were unable to attend regularly \nscheduled therapy.  Patients could not access other forms of routine medical care. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 5 of 53\n \n  Unhygienic conditions were pervasive to the point where they endangered \npatient health.  As a result of the extended water crisis, patients at Saint Elizabeths Hospital, all \nof whom are committed to the District’s care and custody, endured inhumane, unsafe, and \nmedically dangerous conditions that risked their health, mental health, and safety.   Patients \ncould not shower, wash their hands, or use the toilets regularly.  Fecal matter, urine, and \nmenstrual blood accumulated in the bathrooms.  Patients were only allowed to shower on a \nlimited schedule outside in dirty and portable showers which were inaccessible to the many \npatients with mobility disabilities. \n  Despite the fact that there was no safe, running water in September and \nOctober of 2019, Defendants continued to admit new patients to Saint Elizabeths Hospital and to \nkeep patients at Saint Elizabeths Hospital rather than transferring them to other appropriate \nfacilities or discharging them to community-based care where appropriate.  Defendants did not \nprovide appropriate care and safety for Plaintiffs and other similarly situated patients in violation \ntheir due process rights and rights under federal law. Defendant’s conduct in continuing to \ncommit Plaintiffs to a facility with no safe, running, water is so egregious as to shock the \nconscience. \n  The original Class Action Complaint filed in this action challenged the \nDefendants’ failure during the October 2019 extended water crisis to provide adequate \nprotections for patients. \n  Although Defendants turned the water back on in October 2019, they have \nnot only failed to take adequate steps to avoid another predictable health crisis but have yet again \nfostered conditions to exacerbate the dangers to patients in their care.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 6 of 53\n \n  Defendants’ conduct in admitting new patients, failing to properly test or \nisolate symptomatic and exposed patients, failing to quarantine patients with COVID-19, and \nfailing to take other medically necessary precautionary measures is so egregious as to shock the \nconscience.  \nSubject Matter Jurisdiction & Venue \n  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this case under 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1331 and 1343 because this action presents federal questions and seeks to redress the \ndeprivation of rights under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983 and 28 U.S.C. § 2241.   \n  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. §1 391(b)(2) because all \nof the events giving rise to the claims took place in this District. \n  Declaratory relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. § 2201.  A declaration of law \nis necessary and appropriate to determine the parties’ respective rights and duties. \n  Injunctive relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. § 2202.  \nParties \n  Enzo Costa is thirty-eight years old and is a patient at Saint Elizabeths \nHospital in Unit 1C.  He is diagnosed with schizophrenia, dystonia, schizo-affective disorder, \nand anti-social personality disorder.  He is indefinitely, involuntarily civilly committed to the \nDistrict’s care.   \n  Vinita Smith is a fifty-seven years old and is a patient at Saint Elizabeths \nHospital in Unit 1F.  She is diagnosed with schizo-affective disorder that requires medication \nand therapy.  She is indefinitely, involuntarily civilly committed to the District’s care. \n  Stefon Kirkpatrick is thirty years old and is a patient at Saint Elizabeths \nHospital in Unit 2C.  He is diagnosed with psychosis disorder.  Mr. Kirkpatrick has displayed \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 7 of 53\n \nsymptoms of COVID-19 infection, but his request to be tested was denied and he has not been \nmedically isolated.  He is indefinitely, involuntarily civilly committed to the District’s care. \n  William Dunbar is thirty-one year old and is a patient at Saint Elizabeths \nHospital in Unit 2A. He is diagnosed with paranoia schizophrenia.  He is indefinitely, \ninvoluntarily civilly committed to the District’s care. \n  Plaintiffs bring this action for class-wide injunctive relief and for a class-\nwide writ of habeas corpus on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated patients at Saint \nElizabeths Hospital. \n  The named Plaintiffs and the members of the Plaintiff Class are persons \nwith a disability or perceived to have a disability, as that term is defined in the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (“ADA”), and are entitled to the protections of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. \n§12102(2)(A). \n  Defendant District of Columbia (“the District”) owns and operates Saint \nElizabeths Hospital, and is responsible for the services and supports provided to patients at Saint \nElizabeths Hospital.  Saint Elizabeths Hospital is the District’s only public psychiatric facility for \nindividuals with serious and persistent mental illness who need intensive inpatient care to \nsupport their recovery. Saint Elizabeths Hospital also provides mental health evaluations and \ncare to patients committed by the courts. \n  The District of Columbia is a public entity as that term is defined in the \nADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1). \n  Defendant Barbara Bazron is the Director of the Department of Behavioral \nHealth, the District agency that oversees Saint Elizabeth.

The Mayor’s orders relied, in part, on the following \nfindings:  \nThis Order is issued based on the increasing number of confirmed cases of \nCOVID-19 within Washington, DC, and throughout the metropolitan Washington \nregion. Scientific evidence and public health practices show that the most \neffective approach to slowing the community transmission of communicable \ndiseases like COVID-19 is through limiting public activities and engaging in \nsocial distancing. … Medical and public health experts agree that COVID-19 is \neasily transmitted and it is essential that its spread be slowed to protect the ability \nof public and private health care providers to handle the expected influx of ill \npatients and safeguard public health and safety. …. Because of the risk of the \nrapid spread of the virus, and the need to protect all members of Washington, DC, \nand the region, especially residents most vulnerable to the virus, and local health \ncare providers and emergency first responders, this Order requires the temporary \nclosure of the on-site operation of all non-essential businesses and implements a \nprohibition on large gatherings.19  \n  On February 28, 2020, Mayor Bowser ordered the activation of the \nDistrict’s Emergency Operations Center to coordinate responses to COVID-19, requiring \nDefendants to “remind their staff and constituencies” of “basic infection practices,” including to \n“[w]ash hands with soap and water” or an “alcohol-based hand sanitizer,” to “[a]void close \ncontact with people who are sick,” and to “[c]lean and disinfect frequently touched objects and \n \nsurfaces.”20 The Executive Order specifically requires that “[a]ll relevant District agencies shall \nreview their copy of the District Response Plan to evaluate the potential impacts of COVID-19 \n \n19 GOV’T.

Bedrooms and bathrooms on this Unit are not regularly cleaned \nand sanitized.   \n  The first confirmed case of COVID-19 at the Hospital was April 1, 2020.  \nDefendants did not begin to use auxiliary space within the Hospital to segregate asymptomatic, \nsymptomatic, exposed, and COVID-19-positive patients until on or about April 15, 2020.  As of \nApril 15, 2020, patients who are symptomatic, exposed, or COVID-19-positive are still housed \nin close quarters with shared common spaces with asymptomatic and/or unexposed patients.   \n  Mr. Kirkpatrick was symptomatic of coronavirus.  Mr. Kirkpatrick had a \nfever and respiratory symptoms, including cough and shortness of breath.  Mr. Kirkpatrick also \nreported loss of taste and smell, which is a symptom of COVID-19. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 25 of 53\n \n  After Mr. Kirkpatrick reported his symptoms on or about April 4, 2020, \nDefendants did not provide Mr. Kirkpatrick with a test to determine if he was COVID-19 \npositive. \n  Defendants did not treat Mr. Kirkpatrick as a patient suspected or \npresumed positive for coronavirus.  Mr. Kirkpatrick was not isolated from other patients, nor was \nhe transferred to another facility.  Defendants did not instruct Mr. Kirkpatrick to self-quarantine \nwithin his Unit.   \n  Defendants did not instruct Mr. Kirkpatrick to wear a mask or take other \npreventive measures to stop the spread of his illness.  Mr. Kirkpatrick’s symptoms improved but \nhe was not tested for COVID-19 and does not know if he had the virus. \n  Mr. Dunbar’s Unit, Unit 2A, has had four patients test positive for \nCOVID-19.  Two COVID positive patients were rehoused in the quarantine unit and two COVID \npositive patients remained on Unit 2A with asymptomatic and potentially unexposed patients.   \n  The COVID-19 positive patients who remain housed in Unit 2A are \ninteracting with other, asymptomatic and potentially unexposed patients in the common areas \nwhere they watch television or get refreshments. \n  Despite being exposed to COVID-19 positive patients in his Unit, Mr. \nDunbar has not been tested for COVID-19 or segregated from other patients. \nDefendants Are Depriving Patients of Essential Mental Health Care \n  There has been severe curtailment of mental health care and Defendants \nare failing to provide the mental health care that is essential for patient’s well-being. \n  Patients are not receiving the same or functionally equivalent mental \nhealth care that they received prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Defendants have closed the \nTreatment Mall, suspended group therapy, and suspended anger management classes and most \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 26 of 53\n \ncompetency restoration classes.  There are some individual therapy sessions, competency classes, \nand evaluations occurring virtually.   \n  Defendants have not taken steps to systematically compensate of the loss \nof group therapy or necessary classes or provided alternative or modified treatment plans, for \nexample by using teletherapy or virtual therapy.   \n  Ms. Smith, Mr. Costa, Mr. Dunbar, and Mr. Kirkpatrick normally receive \ngroup therapy.  None of them has received group therapy or a telephonic or other remote \nsubstitute for the past few weeks.   \n  Mr. Costa normally receives individual therapy but has not received \nindividual therapy or a telephonic or other remote substitute since Defendants ordered him to \nremain on his Unit. \n  Mr. Dunbar has not received any therapy, or a telephonic or other remote \nsubstitute, aside from a single treatment team meeting, since Defendants ordered him to remain \nin his Unit. \n  Ms. Smith has received only one therapy session via telemedicine with her \nusual therapist since Defendants ordered her to remain in her Unit.   \n  When patients with psychiatric needs do not receive appropriate mental \nhealth services, it becomes more likely symptoms will be exacerbated and patients will \nexperience regression and damage to their mental health.    \nDefendants’ Staffing Shortage \n  The total number of staff members employed at Saint Elizabeths Hospital \nis approximately 700. Large numbers of staff are not reporting to work. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 27 of 53\n \n  On March 31, 2020 Defendants reported that 5 staff members tested \npositive for COVID-19 and another 22 staff members were not reporting to the hospital because \nthey were quarantined due to possible exposure to COVID-19. \n   By April 16, 2020, 47 staff members were positive for COVID-19 and \nanother 23 were in quarantine due to possible exposure to COVID-19, for a total of 70 staff \nmembers absent from the hospital. \n  Mr. Dunbar reports that his unit, Unit 2A, is short-staffed.   \n  The CDC has issued Guidance on Strategies to Mitigate Healthcare  \nPersonnel Staffing Shortages including the recommendations that, at minimum, healthcare \nfacilities must understand their staffing needs and the minimum number of staff needed to \nprovide a safe work environment and patient care and be in communication with local healthcare \ncoalitions, federal, state, and local public health partners to identify additional health care \npersonnel, when needed.37  \n  Despite multiple requests from Plaintiffs’ Counsel, Defendants have \nprovided no evidence that they are following the CDC’s guidance.   \nThe Hospital’s Response to COVID-19 is Similar to Its Response to the 2019 Extended \nWater Outage \n \n  The Hospital’s approach to COVID-19 is similar to its approach to the \nextended water crisis when Saint Elizabeths Hospital did not have safe, running water from at \nleast September 26, 2019 to October 24, 2019.  During that period, the water supply at Saint \nElizabeths Hospital was either completely turned off or limited for sewage use only.   \n \n37 CTRS. DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION, Strategies to Mitigate Healthcare Personnel Staffing \nShortages, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/mitigating-staff-shortages.html (last \nvisited April 16, 2020).   \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 28 of 53\n \n  Plaintiffs are at a continuous risk due to the lack of appropriate emergency \nplans.  They are all indefinitely, involuntarily committed to the District’s care and will likely be \ncommitted at Saint Elizabeths Hospital for all or most of their lives.  For example, Ms. Smith has \nbeen committed to Saint Elizabeth’s for approximately 17 years. \n  The failure to develop a plan to deal with health emergencies has caused \nPlaintiffs and the plaintiff class remain at risk of further irreparable harm.  Fears at the time of \nthe water outage that Defendants’ wrongful behavior would likely recur have come to pass. \n  The October 2019 water contamination was the second time in three years \nthat Saint Elizabeths Hospital has experienced an extended water outage.  Defendants’ response \nto this second extended water outage indicates that they do not have an appropriate Emergency \nWater Supply Plan to manage extended water outages at Saint Elizabeths Hospital.  Defendants’ \ncurrent and ongoing failure to provide the most basic protections against COVID-19 for its \npatients and staff reflects that it continues to lack an appropriate plan to deal with health \nemergencies.   \n  The extended water outage and its effects caused a clear risk to the health \nand safety of Saint Elizabeths Hospitals patients, including Plaintiffs and class members.  The \nextended water outage and its effects created an unreasonable risk of traumatizing patients and \nexacerbating symptoms of mental illness. \n  The conditions at Saint Elizabeths Hospital during the 2019 water outage, \nas described below, caused long lasting, if not permanent, damage to patients and their efforts at \nrecovery.  \n  The conditions at Saint Elizabeths Hospital during the 2019 water outage, \nas described below, violated professional standards of care and treatment.  \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 29 of 53\n \nWater Outage Allegations As of October 23, 2019 (Initial Complaint, Dkt. 1) \n  The allegations in this section reflect the conditions as of the filing of \nPlaintiffs’ initial Complaint in this matter on October 23, 2019. \n  Saint Elizabeths has not had safe, running water since at least September \n26, 2019. Since September 26, 2019, the water supply at Saint Elizabeths has been either \ncompletely turned off or has been limited for sewage use only. \n  Despite the extended water outage and the inability to provide appropriate, \nrequired medical care and therapy, as described below, Saint Elizabeths is still accepting new \npatients. \n  The extended water outage and its effects cause a clear risk to the health \nand safety of Saint Elizabeths’ patients, including Plaintiffs and class members. The extended \nwater outage and its effects creates an unreasonable risk of traumatizing patients and exacerbates \nsymptoms of mental illness. \n  The current conditions at Saint Elizabeths, as described below, will result \nin long lasting, if not permanent, damage to patients and their efforts at recovery. \n  The current conditions at Saint Elizabeths, as described below, violate \nprofessional standards of care and treatment. \n  On September 26, 2019, the D.C. Department of Behavioral Health \n(“DBH”) received preliminary lab results for a water quality test of Saint Elizabeths showing \nevidence of pseudomonas and legionella bacteria in the facility’s water supply. \n  Legionella bacteria is known for causing Legionnaires’ disease, which can \nlead to severe infections in people with weakened immune systems. According to the CDC, one \nout of four people who contract Legionnaires’ disease in a healthcare setting dies because of it. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 30 of 53\n \n  Pseudomonas bacteria can lead to severe infections for people with \nweakened immune systems. \n  In response to the bacteria found in the water supply, DBH reportedly \nimplemented its “water emergency protocol” and turned the water off completely. Upon \ninformation and belief, the water has been turned on occasionally and for limited purposes since \nSeptember 26, 2019 but at no point has Saint Elizabeths had safe, running water. \n  At the end of September, Plaintiffs Ms. Smith, Mr. Costa, Mr. Kirkpatrick, \nand Mr. Dunbar were abruptly told by staff that the water would be shut off because there was a \nwater problem. \n  Upon information and belief, DBH hired contractors to flush Saint \nElizabeths’ water system with chlorine, but testing following the “super chlorination” of the \nwater system continued to show legionella within the facility’s water system. \n  According to Plaintiff Mr. Costa, as of 4:00 p.m. on October 23, 2019, the \nwater remained shut off at Saint Elizabeths and upon information and belief, DBH has not given \na precise date that it will be turned back on. \n  At 5:45 p.m. on October 23, 2019, Councilmember Vincent Gray tweeted \nthat he had been informed by an unnamed source that “all bacteria has been eliminated” from the \nwater system at St. Elizabeths Hospital and that “the process has already begun to restore full \nwater service to the hospital.” According to Vincent Gray’s tweets, the “toilet are fully \noperational” and “[F]aucet heads are being reconnected now and that process should be fully \ncompleted by tomorrow [October 24, 2019].” Vincent Gray has shared no supporting documents, \nwater tests, or information from DBH or Saint Elizabeths Hospital on Twitter. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 31 of 53\n \n  Each of the previous dates DBH communicated to patients, their attorneys, \nor the public for when DBH expected to have safe running water has not been met. \n  This is the second time in three years that Saint Elizabeths Hospital has \nexperienced an extended water outage. Defendants’ response to this second extended water \noutage indicates that they do not have an appropriate Emergency Water Supply Plan to manage \nextended water outages at Saint Elizabeths Hospital. \n  Plaintiffs are all indefinitely, involuntarily committed to the District’s care \nand will likely be committed at Saint Elizabeths for all or most of their lives. For example, Ms. \nSmith has been committed to Saint Elizabeth’s for approximately 17 years. \n  As discussed below, the extended water outage at Saint Elizabeths that \nplaintiffs continue to suffer is irreparably harming the Plaintiffs and plaintiff class. Furthermore, \neven if the clean water is restored in the near future, Plaintiffs and the plaintiff class will remain \nat risk of further irreparable harm until the Defendants remediate conditions at Saint Elizabeths, \nprovide adequate mental health services to meet the current needs of patients, and establish an \nappropriate Emergency Water Supply Plan. Thus, even if the current crisis is ameliorated, \nPlaintiffs will still be at risk of further irreparable harm. It is also far from clear that the wrongful \nbehavior cannot be expected recur. \n  The extended water outage at Saint Elizabeths has prevented patients from \nreceiving appropriate and necessary care, including medical care, psychiatric care, and therapy, \ncreating an imminent risk of irreparable harm. \n  Because of the extended water outage, Defendants closed the Treatment \nMall. Patients remain on their locked wards and are not receiving appropriate group therapy, art \ntherapy, or exercise. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 32 of 53\n \n  Staff, including psychologists and psychiatrists, are not regularly attending \nwork because of the water crisis, forcing cancelations of patient team meetings and other \nappointments. \n  Defendants have severely curtailed or suspended the psychiatric care on \nwhich patients depend. Patients at Saint Elizabeths, including Plaintiffs, are receiving fewer \nservices, and less of the services they are still receiving, than normal. The minimal services they \nare receiving are not appropriate or tailored to their needs. \n  DBH has not explained how it is appropriately dispensing medication, \nparticularly those medications that need to be suspended in water. DBH has not made any \nstatement about how they are addressing patients’ medication side effects that are related to the \nlack of adequate water or that need water in response, such as dry mouth and dehydration. \n  In addition to depriving patients of psychiatric care necessary on an \nongoing basis, Saint Elizabeths’ staff are failing to provide other types of health care. Upon \ninformation and belief, staff are not performing routine checks of new patients for lice, bacteria, \nand other infections. \n  Patients have no access to dentistry and podiatry care that is typically \navailable at Saint Elizabeths. \n  Ms. Smith has had a toothache but cannot go to the dentist. \n  Mr. Costa’s ward administrator, psychologist, psychiatrist, and therapist \nhave all missed work during the time period while the water was shut off and have not been able \nto convene his team meetings. Mr. Costa has been unable to talk to his psychiatrist about \nswitching one of his medications since the water outage occurred. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 33 of 53\n \n  Mr. Costa has not been able to access behavioral therapy, anger \nmanagement classes, group therapy, art therapy, or the gym since Defendants closed the \nTreatment Mall. \n  Mr. Costa normally gets 40 hours per week of therapy but Defendants are \nproviding him with just 2 hours per day (10 hours per week) currently. The little therapy he is \nreceiving is inappropriate: it is a competency restoration group but Mr. Costa is already \ncompetent. \n  Because there was no water, Defendants have not provided Mr. \nKirkpatrick with group therapy. \n  Defendants cancelled a Narcotics Anonymous meeting that both Mr. \nKirkpatrick and Mr. Dunbar attend because there was no water. \n  Defendants have not provided Mr. Dunbar with group therapy or the \nopportunity to exercise since the water was shut off. \n  Without safe, running water, patients and staff cannot flush the toilets \nregularly, wash their hands, shower, wash clothing, or drink from the water fountains. Patients at \nSaint Elizabeths are using bottled water, hand sanitizers, and personal care body wipes to care \nfor their basic hygiene. Patients are permitted limited use of temporary portable showers and \ntoilets. Clothes and linens are only washed periodically and must be sent outside of the facility to \nbe cleaned. \n  Patients and staff cannot regularly and routinely flush the toilets at Saint \nElizabeths. Saint Elizabeths has more than 70 operating bathrooms when the facility has running \nwater. A limited number of toilets within the facility are in use when the water is turned off. \nThese toilets must be flushed manually by pouring water into the tanks. Staff are only flushing \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 34 of 53\n \nthe toilets twice per day, leading to the accumulation of feces, urine, and menstrual blood. The \ntoilets are overflowing and human waste is flowing onto the floors in some bathrooms. There are \nalso a limited number of port-a-potties outside the facility which were not provided until after the \nwater had been shut off for some time. \n  Ms. Smith did not have access to port-a-potties for several days after the \nwater was shut off. While she was awaiting port-a-potties, she used the indoor toilets. Staff \nwould flush those toilets twice per day. The indoor toilets were disgusting and unclean. There \nwere menstrual products all over the bathroom. \n  Mr. Costa’s unit, Unit 1C, normally has six toilets. Unit 1C houses 26 \nmen. Currently all of the men on his unit must use one toilet. That toilet is flushed manually by \npouring water into the tank only once a day. The toilets back up and the smell from the toilets is \n“disgusting, pungent, sour, and strong.” \n  Mr. Costa did not have access to a port-a-potty until about a week after the \nwater was shut off. The port-a-potties are outside and about 200 yards from his unit. The port-a-\npotties are not clean and they smell. \n  Mr. Kirkpatrick’s unit has an average of two usable toilets for \napproximately 25 people. The toilets do not have running water and are flushed by staff or \npatients. There is a buildup of feces on the toilet and floor. The bathroom smells. \n  Mr. Kirkpatrick did not have access to a port-a-potty until about 2-3 weeks \nafter the water was shut off. \n  Mr. Dunbar’s unit, Unit 2A, only has 2 usable toilets for approximately 27 \npeople. The smell of the toilets is so nasty and strong that it makes Mr. Dunbar want to vomit. \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 35 of 53\n \nMr. Dunbar is able to secure day passes to temporarily leave the facility and during this time he \ntries holds his solid waste until he can use toilets outside of Saint Elizabeths grounds. \n  Patients cannot use the indoor showers at Saint Elizabeths. Patients have \nto bathe in portable outdoor showers. DBH secured eight portable showers for Saint Elizabeths’ \nentire patient population. The portable showers are clogged and dirty. The patients have to stand \noutside in groups and take showers in rotation because they have to travel back inside the facility \nas a group. There is no privacy in the showers. \n  Before the outdoor showers arrived, Ms. Smith had to use wipes to clean \nherself because she was not permitted to shower indoors. She does not like using the wipes and \ndoes not feel clean using the wipes. \n  Ms. Smith is only permitted to use the outdoor showers on Mondays, \nWednesdays and Fridays, rather than showering every day. She is not allowed to use the showers \nwhen it is raining. \n  Mr. Costa did not have access to a shower until about a week after the \nwater was shut off. On his unit, only 8 individuals are permitted to use the portable showers per \nday. His unit can use the portable showers on Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays, which means \nthat he is only able to shower one time per week. \n  One time that Mr. Costa was permitted to shower, the water was cold. \nAfter he showered he had to stand outside in the cold temperatures while waiting for everyone to \nfinish showering. He got a headache as a result. \n  When Mr. Costa does not have access to a shower, he has the options to \nclean himself with sanitary wipes or a five gallon bucket of soapy water and a wash rag. The \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 36 of 53\n \nwipes make his skin uncomfortable. Washing with a bucket is degrading and Mr. Costa has not \nused that option because it makes him feel like he is treated like an animal. \n  Mr. Kirkpatrick used a portable shower and had to stand outside in the \ncold while others finished showering. He got sick after using the portable shower, experiencing \nchills and a migraine. \n  Mr. Dunbar did not have access to a portable shower for several days after \nthe water was shut off. When he was able to access a portable shower, the water kept turning on \nand off. The portable showers are not accessible for patients who use wheelchairs and with other \nmobility issues. The portable showers have steps up to them. The portable showers have narrow \npassageways inside. Many older patients are unable to use them. \n  Ms. Smith’s knee gave out one day while walking up the stairs to the \nshower. \n  Upon information and belief, the portable showers are being overseen by \nmale security guards only. Many women at Saint Elizabeths are survivors of sexual assault and \ndo not feel safe using the portable showers. As a result, some of the women have not showered \nfor more than four weeks. \n  Ms. Smith cannot wash her hands. She must use bottled water to brush her \nteeth and is not always given enough water to brush her teeth. She has not washed her hair in \nthree weeks. She cannot do laundry in the hospital and when her cloths were sent out to the \nlaundry, some of them went missing. She currently only has one clean outfit to wear. Ms. \nSmith’s unit has been unusually cold while the water has been shut off. Ms. Smith’s unit smells \nlike dead rats. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 37 of 53\n \n  Mr. Costa cannot use the faucets to wash his hands, brush his teeth, or \nshower. The dirty toilets have attracted bugs and mosquitos that are biting him and others on his \nunit. \n  Mr. Kirkpatrick cannot use the water. He cannot do laundry and does not \nhave access to a washer-dryer. He does not know when he will be able to do laundry or obtain \nclean clothes again. \n  Mr. Dunbar cannot use the water and has to use bottled water to drink and \nto brush his teeth. Because the conditions in the bathrooms are so dirty and unhygienic, he does \nnot feel comfortable using the bathrooms or cleaning his teeth. Some of the closed bathrooms in \nhis unit have signs indicating that they are quarantined because of a bacterial infection. He has \nhad his laundry sent out only once in the last three weeks. When his clothes were returned some \nhad shrunk and they still felt dirty. \n  Mr. Dunbar is permitted to leave the facility on a day pass approximately \ntwo times per month. He normally spends time with his family. Because of the unsanitary \nconditions, he worries about bringing home bacteria and spreading it to his family. \n  The lack of water has caused a tense and stressful environment among \npatients and staff. Patients are confined to their units during the day instead of receiving therapy \nand recreation. Staff are not regularly reporting for work. \n  Patients, including Ms. Smith and Mr. Costa, are unable to leave their \nunits and rooms to receive treatments or recreate. As a result, they and other patients are sleeping \nand dozing during the day. \n  There has been an increase in fights and physical aggression between \npatients following the water outage. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 38 of 53\n \n  There has been an increase in the use of seclusion and restraint of the \npatients following the water outage. \nIn the Absence of Adequate Emergency Plans, the District is Denying Patients Essential \nMedical and/or Mental Health Care and Essential Hygiene and Endangering Patient Safety \n  During the COVID-19 pandemic and the extended water outage at Saint \nElizabeths Hospital, patients did not receive appropriate and necessary care, including medical \ncare, psychiatric care, and therapy, creating an imminent risk of irreparable harm. \n  During both the COVID-19 and the extended water outage crises, \nDefendants closed the Treatment Mall and failed to provide appropriate alternative or virtual \ntherapies.   \n  During both the COVID-19 and the water outage crises, staff, including \npsychologists and psychiatrists, were not regularly attending work, forcing cancelations of \npatient team meetings and other appointments. \n  During both the COVID-19 and the water outage crises, Defendants \nseverely curtailed or suspended the psychiatric care on which patients depend.  Patients at Saint \nElizabeths Hospital, including Plaintiffs, receive fewer services, and less of the services they did \nreceive, than normal.  The minimal services they receive are not appropriate or tailored to their \nneeds. \n  During both the COVID-19 and the water outage crises, Defendants failed \nto provide patients, including Plaintiffs, with essential hygiene.  During the COVID-19, as \ndiscussed above, many patients at Saint Elizabeths have not been provided with masks, and \ncontinue to be housed in a manner inconsistent with social distancing and medical isolation \nprotocols.  During the water crisis, patients and staff could not flush the toilets regularly, wash \ntheir hands, shower, wash clothing, or drink from the water fountains.  Patients were permitted \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 39 of 53\n \nonly limited use of temporary portable showers and toilets.  Clothes and linens were only washed \nperiodically and had to be sent outside of the facility to be cleaned.  \n  During both crises, the crisis caused a tense and stressful environment \namong patients and staff.   Patients were confined to their units during the day instead of \nreceiving therapy and recreation.  Staff were not regularly reporting for work and patients did not \nhave adequate staff to care of them. \n  A restrictive psychiatric hospital setting like Saint Elizabeths Hospital \nmust be safe, calm, predictable in its routine, and responsive to each individual’s needs for \ntreatment in order to achieve its goals of preventing and ameliorating harm. \n  An environment that is chaotic, unpredictable, and unsafe, in which \npatients are not receiving individualized, continuous, intensive treatment risks traumatizing \npeople further and exacerbating the psychiatric needs that were the basis for their admission. \n  Delays in treatment of psychiatric illness in a psychiatric facility that \nrestricts self-determination and integration into community-based settings, like Saint Elizabeths \nHospital, can result in feelings of isolation, hopelessness, and despair; and increased stress and \nanxiety. \n  Segregation of individuals with disabilities should be an option of last \nresort under the best of circumstances as confinement in an institution severely diminishes the \neveryday life activities of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, \neconomic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment.   \n  As described in this First Amended Complaint, patients, including \nPlaintiffs, are not receiving recommended therapy and treatment due to COVID-19 and are at \nhigh risk of contracting a highly communicable, potentially fatal infection.  Plaintiffs are at a \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 40 of 53\n \ncontinuous risk due to the lack of appropriate emergency plans.  To the extent that \nhospitalization was defensible prior to the COVID-19 crisis, Defendants cannot justify the failure \nto evaluate and place patients in the community with appropriate supports. \n  As described in this First Amended Complaint, patients, including \nPlaintiffs, did not receive recommended therapy and treatment due to the extended water crisis \nand were subject to horrific unsanitary conditions.  Plaintiffs are at a continuous risk due to the \nlack of appropriate emergency plans.  To the extent that hospitalization was defensible prior to \nthe extended water outage, Defendants cannot justify the failure to evaluate and place patients in \nthe community with appropriate supports. \n  Defendants provide a wide array of services in the community to meet the \nneeds of Plaintiffs. Services include diagnostic/assessment services, counseling, medication, \nintensive day treatment and crisis/emergency services. Individualized behavioral health services \nare supported by rehabilitation programs, peer supports, supportive employment opportunities, \nhousing assistance and a range of community housing alternatives to facility-based care. These \nservices are being provided by Defendants during the COVID-19 crisis and could be provided to \npatients, including Plaintiffs, in the community.38 \nThe District Bears Responsibility for the Conditions at Saint Elizabeths Hospital \n  As the director of DBH, the agency that oversees Saint Elizabeths \nHospital, Defendant Bazron has the authority to “[s]upervise and direct the Department” and \n“[e]xercise any other powers necessary and appropriate to implement the provisions of this \nchapter.” D.C. Code § 7-1141.04. \n \n38 Department of Behavioral Health, Adult Service, DC.GOV, https://dbh.dc.gov/service/adult-\nservices (last visited April 16, 2020).   \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 41 of 53\n \n  These powers make Defendant Bazron the final policymaking authority \nwith respect to responding to emergencies at Saint Elizabeths Hospital. \n  Defendant Bazron is responsible for the fact that, during the water crisis \nand COVID-19 crisis, Saint Elizabeths Hospital has continued admitting and housing patients in \nunsafe conditions without adequate protections.  \n  During the water crisis, Defendant Bazron informed reporters that she and \nher team were “very, very involved in making sure that we got the [water] problem solved.” \n  During the water crisis, Defendant Bazron further demonstrated her \nresponsibility for Saint Elizabeths Hospital’s decision to keep patients in dangerous conditions \nwithout adequate protections by explaining and defending that approach to the public through \nmultiple statements to journalists. \n  For example, Defendant Bazron told reporters that DBH had procured “an \nextensive supply of bottled water” but had continued admitting patients and declined to move \npatients to other locations.  Defendant Bazron also endorsed DBH’s response to the water \noutage, stating that “[t]hings are really moving very smoothly. \n  By shutting off the water at the facility, Defendants knew or should have \nknown that they would drastically curtail access to showers, toilets, clean clothing, and medical \ncare, and create disorder that could exacerbate patients’ mental health disabilities.  The policies \nDefendants adopted in response to these risks were not reasonably calculated to prevent the \nharms that Plaintiffs have alleged.  \n  Defendants’ inactions and specifically their failures to train and/or \nsupervise Hospital staff to ensure that the harms to Plaintiffs described in the Initial Complaint \n(realleged above at ¶¶130-188, 208) were prevented or ameliorated, caused those harms and \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 42 of 53\n \namounted to deliberate indifference because these harms were the obvious and likely \nconsequence of Defendants’ inactions. \n  Defendants are displaying deliberate indifference to the risk that patients \nface from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Defendants knew or should have known that failing to test \nsymptomatic patients for COVID-19, failing to transfer patients with known or suspected \nCOVID-19 to other facilities, failing to isolate symptomatic and exposed patients, failing to \nquarantine COVID-19 positive patients, and failing to create an environment where social \ndistancing is possible would result in the rapid spread of COVID-19 at Saint Elizabeths Hospital.  \nDefendants knew or should have known that this posed an unreasonable risk of serious infection \nand death among the patient population.   The policies Defendants adopted in response to this \nrisk was not reasonably calculated to prevent it, and did not in fact prevent it. \n  Additionally, Defendants, by failing to supervise and/or train staff to \nensure that they took full and appropriate precautionary measures, are displaying deliberate \nindifference to the risk that the response to the conditions at Saint Elizabeths Hospital will result \nin constitutional violations. Defendants’ failures are subjecting patients to the obvious and likely \nrisk of contracting COVID-19, which places Plaintiffs in serious danger of severe illness or \ndeath.   \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n \n  The named Plaintiffs bring this suit on their own behalf and on behalf of \nall current Saint Elizabeths Hospital patients and all patients who will be admitted in the future \nwhile the hospital operates without a sufficient emergency preparedness plan that protects \npatients from an unreasonable risk of harm. \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 43 of 53\n \n  This class is so numerous that joinder of all members in impractical.  Saint \nElizabeths Hospital has 2370 patients currently.  Because the population changes on a daily \nbasis, it is inherently fluid and the class also includes future members whose identities are not \nknown at this time.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). \n  There are questions of law and fact common to all class members, \nincluding but not limited to the Defendants’ deprivation of the class members’ substantive due \nprocess rights, the Defendants’ failure to provide constitutionally safe and humane conditions to \nclass members and the Defendants’ failure to provide appropriate medical care to class members, \nand the District’s violation of the class members’ rights under the Americans with Disabilities \nAct.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). \n  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of \nthe class.  They possess a strong personal interest in the subject matter of the lawsuit and are \nrepresented by experienced counsel with expertise in class action litigation in federal court.  \nCounsel have the legal knowledge and resources to fairly and adequately represent the interests \nof all class members in this action.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). \n  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to \nthe class in that Defendants’ policies and practices of violating the Plaintiffs’ constitutional \nrights have affected all class members. Accordingly, final injunctive and declaratory relief is \nappropriate to the class as a whole. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \nNECESSITY FOR EMERGENCY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  The Defendants have acted and, as of the time of filing, continue to act in \nviolation of the law as described above. The named Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent \ndo not have an adequate remedy at law. As a result of the policies, practices, acts, and omissions \nof the Defendants, the named Plaintiffs, and the class they seek to represent, have suffered, are \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 44 of 53\n \nsuffering, and will suffer serious, imminent, irreparable physical, mental, and emotional injuries.  \nSuch serious injuries are continuing and likely irreversible. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(Claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 28 U.S.C. § 2241 for violation of the Fifth \nAmendment—Due Process) \n \n  The Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause protects individuals in the \nDistrict of Columbia from government conduct that deprives them of their constitutional rights \nbecause it is “so egregious that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.” \n  Individuals who are committed to the District’s custody, like the named \nPlaintiffs and other class members, have a protected constitutional right under the Due Process \nClause of the Fifth Amendment to be housed in humane conditions, to have the District take \nreasonable steps to guarantee their care and safety, and to have adequate medical care, including \nmental health care. \n  Defendants’ actions and inactions have repeatedly deprived class members \nof their constitutionally protected rights to reasonable care and safety.  These instances have \nincluded when, as alleged in \na.   Paragraphs 2-5, 7, 14, 37-126, 189-199, and 201, Defendants failed to \ncreate and implement an appropriate Emergency Preparedness Plan that \nallowed Plaintiffs to practice social distancing, remain separate from \npersons who were COVID-19 symptomatic or COVID-19 positive, \nrestricted visitor and new patients, and appropriately and quickly tested \nsymptomatic individuals.  \nb.  Paragraphs 6-13 and 123-184, Defendants failed to maintain an \nappropriate Emergency Water Supply Plan after the first extended water \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 45 of 53\n \noutage, which caused Defendants to cut off running water and deprive \nPlaintiffs of basic sanitation including sanitary toileting, safe and sanitary \nshowers, and clean clothes and linens.   \nDefendants’ actions and inactions shock the conscience. \n  Defendants’ actions in unilaterally altering medical care at Saint \nElizabeths Hospital during the COVID-19 crisis, as alleged in Paragraphs 189-199 and 201, and \nduring the 2019 water crisis, as alleged in Paragraphs 9, 127, 132, 134-135, 147-161, 189-201, \ndepart from professionally accepted standards and/or appropriate professional judgement, and \ndeprive class members of their constitutionally protected rights. \n  Defendants’ policies, practices, acts, and/or omissions have placed and \nwill continue to place the named Plaintiffs and the members of the class they seek to represent at \nan unreasonable risk of harm as alleged in Paragraphs 1-7, 10-11, 37-77, 78-108, 127-148, 189, \n195, 199-200, and 209-211.   \n  There is no reasonable justification for the Defendants’ actions. \n  Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief and/or a writ of habeas corpus to \nrelieve them from unconstitutional confinement.   \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Claim against the District of Columbia under 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq. for violation of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act) \n  The named Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class are individuals with \ndisabilities within the meaning of the ADA. Their impairments substantially limit one or more \nmajor life activities, including caring for oneself, concentrating, and thinking. \n  As adults who have been determined to require intensive inpatient care to \nsupport their recovery from serious and persistent mental illness, the named Plaintiffs and the \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 46 of 53\n \nPlaintiff Class are qualified to participate in Defendants’ behavioral health programs and \nservices. 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2). \n  The District of Columbia is a public entity as defined by Title II of the \nADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1). \n  Defendants have discriminated against Plaintiffs by repeatedly failing to \nreasonably modify its system to reduce the segregation of Plaintiffs with disabilities from their \ncommunities of non-disabled peers during emergencies that threaten the physical and mental \nhealth and safety of Plaintiffs and undermine the clinical justification for such confinement. \nThese instances have included when, as alleged in \na.   Paragraphs 2-5, 7, 14, 37-126, 189-99, 201, and 210, during the COVID-\n19 crisis, they failed to cease intakes, conduct individual assessments of \npatients to determine whether other options existed in lieu of continued \nplacement at Saint Elizabeths Hospital, and failed to take appropriate \naction for Plaintiffs and other class members, including relocating within \nthe District those patients for whom it was appropriate or providing \nreasonably modified services for those for whom relocating was not \nappropriate. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).  \nb.  Paragraphs 6-13 and 123-184, during the 2019 extended water outage, \nthey failed to cease intakes, conduct individual assessments of patients to \ndetermine whether other options existed in lieu of continued placement at \nSaint Elizabeths Hospital, and failed to take appropriate action for \nPlaintiffs and other class members, including relocating within the District \nthose patients for whom it was appropriate or providing reasonably \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 47 of 53\n \nmodified services for those for whom relocating was not appropriate. 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7). \n  Defendants have discriminated against class members by repeatedly \nutilizing methods of administration that deprive Plaintiffs of equal access to the benefits of the \nmental health services provided by Defendants that other individuals in the community are \nreceiving. These instances have included when, as alleged in \na.  Paragraphs 109 and 111-115, during the COVID-19 crisis, Defendants \nfailed to provide for alternative treatment, such as teletherapy, virtual \ntherapy, telephonic therapy or another remote substitute.  \nb.  Paragraphs 9, 20, 110-115, 132, 149, 157-161, 185, 189, 194, 199-200, \nand 229, during the first extended water outage Defendants curtailed \nindividual psychotherapy, stopped or curtailed group therapy, stopped \ncompetency classes, restricted all access to the Treatment Mall and \nthereby prevented planning team meetings and suspended art and music \ntherapy, vocational training, exercise, and socialization; restricted patient \nmovement to the patient’s unit;, intermittently shut off the water; \ninappropriately restricted toilets and shower use, provided inaccessible \nportable showers; and suspended medically necessary services such as \ndentistry and podiatry.  \nThere is no reasonable justification for these failures.  \n  These failures have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing the \naccomplishment of the objectives of Defendants’ behavioral health programs with respect to the \nIndividual Named Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(ii). \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 48 of 53\n \n  Defendants’ policies, practices, acts, and/or omissions violate the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act.  42 U.S.C. § 12131. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nBased on the foregoing, Plaintiffs request that the Court: \n  Certify this case as a Class Action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2); \n  Designate undersigned counsel as attorneys for the certified class; \n  Declare that Defendants violated Plaintiffs’ rights under the Fifth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution; \n  Declare that Defendants violated Plaintiffs’ rights under the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act;  \n  Enter injunctive relief and/or writs of habeas corpus requiring Defendants, \ntheir agents, employees, and all persons acting in concert with or on behalf of Defendants to: \na.  Immediately cease admissions to Saint Elizabeths Hospital; \nb.  Issue a writ of habeas corpus ordering Respondent Chastang to release a \nsufficient number of patients to enable the remaining patients to practice \nadequate social distancing and to enable the staff to maintain the hospital \nin safe and healthy condition, including the provision of all necessary \nmental health treatment; \nc.  Immediately take all actions within their power to reduce the patient \npopulation at Saint Elizabeths Hospital; \nd.  Within 48 hours, conduct individual assessments of patients by the \nMedical Director with input from the patients’ treatment team, his/her \nattorney, and/or other supportive decision makers as determined by patient \nchoice to assess the effects of the current conditions and determine \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 49 of 53\n \nwhether other options exist in lieu of continued placement at Saint \nElizabeths Hospital.  The assessment team must consider a full range of \navailable alternative treatment options, including discharge to a \ncommunity setting and under no circumstances should an individual be \ntransferred to a jail or nursing home; \ne.  Implement recommendations from the assessments immediately; \nf.  Ensure sufficient space to follow all professional guidance on social \ndistancing, quarantining, and isolation for infected or suspected COVID-\n19 patients, including by creating auxiliary facilities and residents at the \nHospital at other District facilities or private facilities that can safely \nhouse patients.   \ng.  To the extent continued placement at Saint Elizabeths Hospital is the only \nreasonable option, for the patients who remain at Saint Elizabeths \nHospital, provide appropriate COVID-19 intervention and care at the \nHospital with teams of medical professionals and infection experts who \ncan: \ni  Develop, update, and implement best practices for reducing \nthe infection rates at Saint Elizabeths Hospital, including \nproviding appropriate and accessible guidance to staff and \npatients; \nii  Administer rapid COVID-19 tests for anyone displaying \nknown symptoms of COVID-19 or who has been exposed \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 50 of 53\n \nto someone with known symptoms or who has tested \npositive for COVID-19; \niii  Ensure segregation of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 \ncases; \niv  Determine equipment needs and immediately provide \nmasks for any individual displaying or reporting COVID-\n19 symptoms or exposure until they can be evaluated by a \nqualified medical professional or placed in quarantine; \nv  Ensure that each patient has timely and complete access to \nessential hygiene; \nvi  Provide on-site care and medical assessment, including \nmedical care and therapy that is appropriate for their needs; \nvii  Frequently communicate to patients to provide information \nabout COVID-19, reducing the risk of transmission, and \nany changes in policies or practices; \nviii  To the extent continued placement at Saint Elizabeths \nHospital is the only reasonable option, patients must be \nproperly quarantined and segregated per public health \nguidelines to prevent COVID-19 infection; \nh.  Develop a staffing contingency plan that includes employing sufficient \nqualified temporary staff to ensure adequate infection control and that \npatients receive necessary treatment and care in light of staffing shortages; \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 50   Filed 04/22/20   Page 51 of 53\n \ni.  Immediately resume providing all medical and mental health treatment \nservices as per CDC Guidelines; \nj.  Conduct individual assessments of patients by the Medical Director with \ninput from the patients’ treatment team, his/her attorney, and/or other \nsupportive decision makers as determined by patient choice to assess the \neffects of the stress and trauma of having experienced weeks safe, running \nwater in the conditions described above, the impact of the current COVID-\n19 pandemic, and the repercussions Defendants’ deprivation of \nappropriate mental health services has had on patients’ mental health \nstatus and determine if changes to individual patients’ treatment plans are \nneeded; \nk.

      "text": "Case 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 30   Filed 01/21/20   Page 1 of 16\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n \n   \nENZO COSTA, et al.,    \n  Case No.  1:19-cv-3185 (RDM) \nPlaintiffs,    \n \nv. \n \nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, et al., \n \nDefendants. \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \nPlaintiffs hereby move, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 for entry of an order determining \nthat this action may be maintained as a class action on behalf of “all current and future Saint \nElizabeths Hospital patients.”  The grounds for this motion are set forth below.  Plaintiffs also \nrespectfully request that the Court appoint their undersigned counsel as Class Counsel pursuant \nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g).  \nINTRODUCTION \nFor the second time in three years, Saint Elizabeths Hospital (“Saint Elizabeths” or the \n“Hospital”) was without safe, running water from September 26, 2019 through at least October \n23, 2019, exposing patients at the facility to harmful physical, emotional, and mental health \nconsequences.  Each of the individual plaintiffs (Enzo Acosta, Vinita Smith, Stefon Kirkpatrick, \nWilliam Dunbar (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”)) and many of the other patients at the Hospital \nexperienced unhygienic conditions and an interruption of their medical and mental health care.  \nWhile this matter has not yet proceeded to discovery, it is clear even at this early juncture that \nthis matter should proceed as a class action on behalf of the Saint Elizabeths’ patient population.  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 30   Filed 01/21/20   Page 2 of 16\nPursuant to Local Rule 23.1(b) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b), Plaintiffs hereby \nmove for certification of a Rule 23(b)(2) class, and request appointment of Plaintiffs’ Counsel as \nClass Counsel pursuant to Rule 23(g).  \nThe putative class consists of Saint Elizabeths’ current and future patient population.  All \nof the members of that population are persons with mental health disabilities who are, or who \nwill be in the future, committed to the Defendants’ care.  ECF 21-2 (Decl. of K. Singh Taneja, ¶ \n1).  All members were injured and likely to be injured by recurrent inhumane, unsafe, and \nmedically dangerous conditions at Saint Elizabeths and the lack of appropriate hospital \nadministration that led to those conditions in violation of Fifth Amendment’s Due Process \nClause,  and the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131.  \nThis action can fairly and efficiently be adjudicated as a class action and should proceed \nas a class for several reasons.  First, Plaintiffs’ claims that Defendants’ actions and/or inactions \nhave deprived class members of humane conditions and subjected them to harm in violation of \nthe Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause and the ADA raises common, class-wide questions, \nthe answer to which can be resolved through common evidence: why did the water outage occur, \nwhy do water outages keep occurring, why do the outages have such a negative impact on \nhygienic conditions at the facility, why has patient care been so severely impacted, why are \nDefendants’ policies for handling water emergencies so deficient, and why shouldn’t Defendants \nbe held responsible?   \nSecond, Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and each putative class member, seek a \ndeclaration that Defendants violated Plaintiffs’ rights under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 30   Filed 01/21/20   Page 3 of 16\nConstitution and the ADA and an injunction requiring Defendants’ agents, employees, and all \npersons acting in concert with or on behalf of Defendants to cease their unconstitutional and \nunlawful practices, as detailed at paragraph 113 of Plaintiffs’ Complaint.  In particular, it is clear \nfrom the outcome of the last two water outages that there are significant deficiencies in \nDefendants’ policies, including its “water emergency protocol” that can only be effectively \naddressed through injunctive relief.  That requested relief is exactly the kind of class-wide relief \ncontemplated by Rule 23(b)(2).  See Wal-Mart v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 361 (2011) (“Civil rights \ncases against parties charged with unlawful, class-based discrimination are prime examples of \nwhat (b)(2) is meant to capture.”) (citation and internal punctuation omitted).  \nPlaintiffs note that, per the requirement of Local Rule 23.1(b), this motion is being filed \nwithin 90 days of filing the Complaint.1  On January 17, 2020, Plaintiffs' counsel met and \nconferred with Defendants' counsel regarding this motion.  Defendants' counsel stated that they \nopposed the motion to certify the class. \nFor the reasons set forth below, the Court should grant Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class \nCertification. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS2 \nI.  PLAINTIFFS AND THE PROPOSED CLASS \nSaint Elizabeths is the District’s only public psychiatric facility for individuals with \nserious and persistent mental illness who need intensive inpatient care to support their recovery.  \n \n1 This motion is being filed prior to any discovery. \n2 To the extent necessary, Plaintiffs can submit declarations from each of the proposed class representatives attesting \nto the facts discussed in this section. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 30   Filed 01/21/20   Page 4 of 16\nCompl. ¶ 15.  The patient population of Saint Elizabeths are all individuals who are indefinitely, \ninvoluntarily committed to the District’s care, and each patient at Saint Elizabeths will likely be \ncommitted at Saint Elizabeths for all or most of their lives.  Compl. ¶ 37. \nThe individual Plaintiffs, like the class they seek to represent, are persons with a \ndisability or perceived to have a disability, as that term is defined in the ADA, are entitled to the \nprotections of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. §12102(2)(A), and are indefinitely, involuntarily committed \nto the District’s care.  Compl. ¶ 37. \nEnzo Costa is thirty-eight years old and is a patient at Saint Elizabeths Hospital in Unit \n1C.  Compl. ¶ 9.  He is diagnosed with schizophrenia, dystonia, schizo-affective disorder, and \nanti-social personality disorder.  Id.  He is indefinitely, involuntarily civilly committed to the \nDistrict’s care.  Compl. ¶ 37.  He was a patient at Saint Elizabeths when it was without safe, \nrunning water and was exposed to conditions with severe physical, emotional, and mental health \nconsequences.  Compl. ¶¶ 40, 42, 47-49, 56-58, 64-66, 73, 81.   \nVinita Smith is fifty-six years old and is a patient at Saint Elizabeths Hospital in Unit 1F.    \nCompl. ¶ 10.  She is diagnosed with schizo-affective disorder that requires medication and \ntherapy.  Id. She is indefinitely, involuntarily civilly committed to the District’s care.  Compl. ¶ \n37.  She was a patient at Saint Elizabeths when it was without safe, running water and was \nexposed to conditions with severe physical, emotional, and mental health consequences.  Compl. \n¶¶ 40, 42, 44, 55, 62-63, 69-70, 72, 81. \nStefon Kirkpatrick is thirty years old and is a patient at Saint Elizabeths Hospital in \nUnit 2C.  Compl. ¶ 11.   He is diagnosed with psychosis disorder.  Id.   He is indefinitely, \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 30   Filed 01/21/20   Page 5 of 16\ninvoluntarily civilly committed to the District’s care.  Compl. ¶ 37.  He was a patient at Saint \nElizabeths when it was without safe, running water and was exposed to conditions with severe \nphysical, emotional, and mental health consequences.  Compl. ¶¶ 40, 42, 50-51, 58-59, 67, 74, \n81.  \nWilliam Dunbar is thirty years old and is a patient at Saint Elizabeths Hospital in Unit \n2A.  Compl. ¶ 12.  He is diagnosed with paranoia schizophrenia.  Id.  He is indefinitely, \ninvoluntarily civilly committed to the District’s care.  Compl. ¶ 37.  He was a patient at Saint \nElizabeths when it was without safe, running water and was exposed to irreparable harmful \nphysical, emotional, and mental health consequences.   Compl. ¶¶ 40, 42, 51-52, 60, 68, 75-76, \n81.  \nII.  THE WATER OUTAGES AND IMPACT ON PATIENT CARE \nFor the second time in three years, Saint Elizabeths had an extended water outage from \nSeptember 26 through at least October 23, 2019.  Compl. ¶ 22.  During that period, Saint \nElizabeths did not have safe, running water, and the water supply at Saint Elizabeths was either \ncompletely turned off or was limited for sewage use only.  Compl. ¶ 22.  \nOn September 26, 2019, the D.C. Department of Behavioral Health (“DBH”) received \npreliminary lab results of a water quality test of Saint Elizabeths showing evidence of \npseudomonas and legionella bacteria in the facility’s water supply.  Compl. ¶ 26.   Legionella \nbacteria is known for causing Legionnaires’ disease, which can lead to severe infections in \npeople with weakened immune systems.  Compl. ¶ 27. \nIn response to the bacteria found in the water supply, DBH reportedly implemented its \n“water emergency protocol” and turned the water off completely.  Compl. ¶ 30.  The extended \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 30   Filed 01/21/20   Page 6 of 16\nwater outage and its effects presented a clear risk to the health and safety of Saint Elizabeths’ \npatients, including Plaintiffs and class members.  The extended water outage and its effects \ntraumatized patients and exacerbated symptoms of mental illness.  Compl. ¶ 24.  \nPlaintiffs and class members were denied appropriate medical care.  During the 2019 \ncrisis: \n•  The Water Outage caused a tense and stressful environment among patients and \nstaff. Compl. ¶ 77.  \n•  Because of the extended Water Outage, Defendants closed the Treatment Mall, \npatients remained in their locked wards and were not receiving appropriate group \ntherapy, art therapy, or exercise. Compl. ¶ 40. \n•  Staff, including psychologists and psychiatrists, were not regularly attending work \nbecause of the water crisis, forcing cancelations of patient team meetings and \nother appointments.  Compl. ¶¶ 39-41, 47-52, 77. \n•  Defendants severely curtailed or suspended the psychiatric care on which patients \ndepend. Patients at Saint Elizabeths, including Plaintiffs, received fewer services. \nThe minimal services they received were not appropriate or tailored to their \nneeds.  Compl. ¶ 42. \n•  Patients had difficulty receiving medications (particularly those that need to be \nsuspended in water) and addressing side effects (particularly dry mouth and \ndehydration). Compl. ¶¶ 43, 47.  \n•  Patients were confined to their units during the day instead of receiving therapy \nand recreation. Compl. ¶¶ 77, 81.   \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 30   Filed 01/21/20   Page 7 of 16\n•  There was an increase in fights and physical aggression between patients \nfollowing the water outage.  Compl. ¶ 82.  \n•  There has been an increase in the use of seclusion and restraint of the patients \nfollowing the water outage.  Compl. ¶ 83. \n•  Saint Elizabeths staff did not perform routine checks of new patients for lice, \nbacteria, and other infections.  Compl. ¶ 43. \n•  Patients had no access to dentistry and podiatry care that is typically available at \nSaint Elizabeths.  Compl. ¶ 45. \nPlaintiffs and class members were denied basic hygienic conditions.  During the water \ncrisis, patients and staff were not able to flush the toilets regularly, wash their hands, shower, \nwash clothing, or drink from the water fountains. Compl. ¶¶ 53, 72-75.  Patients at Saint \nElizabeths used bottled water, hand sanitizers, and personal care body wipes to care for their \nbasic hygiene. Compl. ¶ 53.  Patients were permitted limited use of temporary portable showers \nand toilets. Compl. ¶¶ 53-71.   Clothes and linens were only washed periodically and were sent \noutside of the facility to be cleaned.  Compl. ¶ 73.   \nBoth the interruption in health care and the unhygienic conditions negatively impacted \nthe patients of Saint Elizabeths as a class.  Moreover, because this is the second time in three \nyears that Saint Elizabeths had an extended water outage and there are no apparent procedures in \nplace to ensure that plaintiffs receive adequate health care and safe conditions, this harm is likely \nto reoccur. A restrictive psychiatric hospital setting like Saint Elizabeths must always be safe, \ncalm, predictable in its routine, and responsive to each individual’s needs for treatment in order \nto achieve its goals of preventing and ameliorating harm.  Compl. ¶ 78.  An environment that is \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 30   Filed 01/21/20   Page 8 of 16\nchaotic, unpredictable, and unsafe, in which patients are not receiving individualized, \ncontinuous, intensive treatment risks traumatizing people further and exacerbating the \npsychiatric needs that were the basis for their admission.  Compl. ¶ 79. \nARGUMENT \nI.  PLAINTIFFS SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 23(A) \nAs demonstrated below, the proposed class satisfies each of the four requirements in Rule \n23(a): numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \nA. The Proposed Class Satisfies Numerosity \nTo satisfy Rule 23(a)(1), a class must be “so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). “Numerosity is satisfied” with credible evidence that “a \nproposed class has at least forty members.” See Richardson v. L’Oreal USA, Inc., 991 F. Supp. \n2d 181, 196 (D.D.C. 2013); see also Frazier v. Consol. Rail Corp., 851 F.2d 1447, 1456 n.10 \n(D.C. Cir. 1988) (discussing appellate courts’ acceptance of the 40-member threshold). The \nproposed class meets this standard. \nThe named Plaintiffs bring this suit on their own behalf and on behalf of all current Saint \nElizabeths Hospital patients and all patients who will be admitted in the future. This class is so \nnumerous that joinder of all members in impractical. Saint Elizabeths Hospital has \napproximately 270 patients.  Compl. ¶ 92.  Because the population changes on a daily basis, it is \ninherently fluid and the class also includes future members whose names are not known at this \ntime. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 30   Filed 01/21/20   Page 9 of 16\nThe number of individuals in Plaintiffs’ proposed class therefore significantly exceeds \nthe presumptive forty-person standard. See Richardson, 991 F. Supp. 2d at 196.  Numerosity is \nplainly satisfied. \nB.  The Proposed Class Satisfies Commonality \nRule 23(a)(2) requires the existence of “questions of law or fact common to the class.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). “Commonality . . . requires the court to determine whether there is at \nleast one question of law or fact common to the class.” Moore v. Napolitano, 926 F. Supp. 2d 8, \n29 (D.D.C. 2013) (emphasis added). “Factual variations among the class members will not defeat \nthe commonality requirement, so long as a single aspect or feature of the claim is common to all \nproposed class members.” Id. As the Supreme Court explained in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. \nDukes, “for purposes of Rule 23(a)(2)[,] even a single common question will do.” 564 U.S. 338, \n359 (2011) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).   \nCommonality is satisfied for a due process claim where all members of the class would \nbe affected by resolution of the constitutionality of the policy as it was applied during the class \nperiod.  See Daskalea v. Wash. Humane Soc., 275 F.R.D. 346, 374 (D.D.C.2011).  Commonality \nis satisfied for a disability discrimination claim under the ADA where a plaintiff alleging \ndiscrimination against a class shows discrimination against a particular group of which the \nplaintiff is member, plus some additional factor that permits a court to infer that members of the \nclass suffered from a common policy of discrimination.  See Disability Rights Council of Greater \nWash. v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., 239 F.R.D. 9, 26 (D.D.C.2006) (internal quotation \nmarks and citations omitted) .   \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 30   Filed 01/21/20   Page 10 of 16\nA common question is one that “is such a nature that it is capable of classwide \nresolution—which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is \ncentral to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.” Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350.  What \nmatters to class certification is “the capacity of a class-wide proceeding to generate common \nanswers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350.  Where plaintiffs \nallege wrongdoing by the defendant, commonality is established where plaintiffs “provide \nsignificant proof that there exists a common policy or practice that is the alleged source of the \nharm to class members.” Thorpe v. District of Columbia, 303 F.R.D. 120, 145 (D.D.C. 2014) \n(internal quotations and citations omitted). \nAll members of the class were subjected to the inhumane conditions during the Water \nOutage as a result of Defendants’ deficient water emergency protocols and policies.  Plaintiffs \nhad limited opportunities to shower, were provided only with unsanitary toilets that did not flush, \nwere confined to their rooms and units where normal standards of cleanliness were not \nmaintained, and had their psychiatric and medical care severely limited. \nThe Defendants’ water emergency protocols and policies (or lack thereof) injured or will \ninjure each and every class member by virtue of their failure to implement an effective system of \nmaintaining a safe water supply, remediating problems in the water supply, and maintaining safe \nand sanitary conditions at the Hospital during a water outage. Thus, Plaintiffs’ claims raise the \nfollowing common questions: (1) why did the water outage occur? (2) why do water outages \nkeep occurring? (3) why do the outages have such a negative impact on hygienic conditions at \nthe facility? (4) why has patient care been so severely impacted? (5) why are Defendants’ \npolicies for handling water emergencies so deficient? and (6) why shouldn’t Defendants be held \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 30   Filed 01/21/20   Page 11 of 16\nresponsible? True or false, as held by this Court in Thorpe, “resolution of these common \ncontentions will generate common answers for the entire class and resolve issues that are central \n(and potentially dispositive) to the validity of each plaintiff’s claim and the claims of the class as \na whole.”  Thorpe, 303 F.R.D. at 146.  Commonality is plainly satisfied. \nC.  The Proposed Class Representatives Have Claims Typical of the Class \nRule 23(a)(3) “requires that the claims . . . of the representative parties be typical of the \nclaims . . . of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). “A plaintiff’s claims can be typical of those of \nthe class even if there is some factual variation between them.” Encinas v. J.J. Drywall Corp., \n265 F.R.D. 3, 8 (D.D.C. 2010). “Rule 23 does not require that the representative plaintiffs \nendured precisely the same injuries that may have been sustained by other class members, only \nthat the harm complained of be common to the class, and that the named plaintiffs demonstrate a \npersonal interest or threat of injury that is real and immediate, not conjectural or hypothetical.” \nJohnson v. District of Columbia, 248 F.R.D. 46, 53 (D.D.C. 2008). \nTypicality is therefore satisfied if (1) “each class member’s claim arises from the same \ncourse of events that led to the claims of the representative parties;” and (2) “each class member \nmakes similar legal arguments to prove the defendant’s liability.” Greenberg v. Colvin, 63 F. \nSupp. 3d 37, 44 (D.D.C. 2014). The Plaintiffs’ claims meet this standard. \nFirst, the Plaintiffs and each member of the proposed class were subjected to Defendants’ \nsame actions and inactions. All class members were, and are likely in the future, deprived of the \nbasic medical care and safe and sanitary conditions at Saint Elizabeths because of extended water \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 30   Filed 01/21/20   Page 12 of 16\noutages.  Accordingly, the “representatives have suffered injuries in the same general fashion as \nabsent class members.” Hardy v. District of Columbia, 283 F.R.D. 20, 24-25 (D.D.C. 2012). \nSecond, the Plaintiffs’ claims are shared by all the members. Each class member brings \nthe exact same claims under the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause and the ADA. Every \nputative class member relies upon the same basic theory of liability—that the water conditions at \nSaint Elizabeths and Defendants’ deficient response to those conditions have affected and \nexposed patients to irreparable, harmful physical, emotional, and mental health consequences. \nSee Compl. ¶¶ 19-83. Every putative class member seeks the same injunctive relief to order \nDefendants to cease their unconstitutional and unlawful practices. See id. This satisfies Rule \n23(a)(3)’s typicality requirement. \nD.  The Proposed Class Representatives and Class Counsel Are Adequate \nRule 23(a)(4) requires that “the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). This requirement contains two criteria: “‘1) \nthe named representative must not have antagonistic or conflicting interests with the unnamed \nmembers of the class, and 2) the representative must appear able to vigorously prosecute the \ninterests of the class through qualified counsel.’” Moore, 926 F. Supp. 2d at 31 (quoting Twelve \nJohn Does v. District of Columbia, 117 F.3d 571, 575-76 (D.C. Cir. 1997)). \nThe named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class. They \npossess a strong personal interest in the subject matter of the lawsuit and are represented by \nexperienced counsel with expertise in class action litigation in federal court. Moreover, the \nclaims of these individuals mirror the claims of the class. Therefore, the proposed class \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 30   Filed 01/21/20   Page 13 of 16\nrepresentatives’ interests are not antagonistic to the interests of absent class members. See \nThorpe v. District of Columbia, 303 F.R.D. 120, 150 (D.D.C. 2014) (finding “no real conflict of \ninterest, since the scope of the current litigation is limited to a systemic challenge”). \nIn addition, Plaintiffs’ proposed class counsel—the American Civil Liberties Union \nFoundation of the District of Columbia (“ACLU”), Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil \nRights and Urban Affairs (“WLC”), and Arnold & Porter LLP—can fairly and adequately \nrepresent the class.  Each of the three organizations have been appointed as class counsel in \nnumerous matters.  Moreover, ACLU, WLC and Arnold & Porter LLP have committed and will \ncontinue to commit substantial resources to prosecuting this case. Accordingly, Rule 23(a)(4)’s \nadequacy requirement in the instant action is satisfied. \nII.  THE CLASS SATISFIES THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 23(B)(2) \nTo certify a class, a plaintiff must also satisfy at least one of the three types of classes \ndescribed in Rule 23(b). Plaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(2). \nCertification under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate where “(1) the defendant’s action or \nrefusal to act [is] generally applicable to the class; and (2) plaintiffs . . . seek final injunctive \nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief on behalf of the class.” Taylor v. D.C. Water & Sewer \nAuth., 241 F.R.D. 33, 47 (D.D.C. 2007).  See also DL v. D.C., 860 F.3d 713, 723 (D.C. Cir. \n2017) (same).  That is the case here, and Plaintiffs’ requests for declaratory and injunctive relief \neasily satisfy both of those requirements. \nFirst, the water outage affected patient care and hygienic conditions throughout the \nfacility, and affected all of Saint Elizabeths’ patients.  All patients were exposed to conditions \nthat deprived them of, among other things, proper medical care, hygiene, and psychiatric care.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 30   Filed 01/21/20   Page 14 of 16\nThese injuries stemmed from Defendants’ adherence to a set of policies, procedures, and \nprotocols (including the water emergency protocol).  Thus, Defendants’ actions or inactions were \ngenerally applicable to the class for purposes of Rule 23(b)(2). \nSecond, the Supreme Court has stated “[t]he key to the (b)(2) class is the indivisible \nnature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted.” Dukes, 564 U.S. at 360 (internal \nquotations and citations omitted). Rule 23(b)(2) certification is allowed when “a single \ninjunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class.” Id.The \n \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief sought here is class-wide in nature, and would provide relief to \neach class member.  \nPlaintiffs seek a declaration that Defendants violated Plaintiffs’ rights under the Fifth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution and the ADA and an injunction requiring Defendants’ \nagents, employees, and all persons acting in concert with or on behalf of Defendants to cease \ntheir unconstitutional and unlawful practices.  \nPlaintiffs’ requested injunctive relief consists entirely of orders that would apply to the \nwhole facility and therefore to the entire class—including a restriction on admissions during \nwater outages (which affects the entire population’s access to services when those services are \nlimited), water testing, maintenance of therapeutic services and sanitary conditions, and \ndevelopment of an emergency protocol. See Compl. ¶ 113. Although phrased in terms of \nindividuals, the request for individualized assessments, id. at § 113(b), likewise constitutes \nclasswide relief, in that this releif would require Defendants to conduct an assessment for each \nmember of the class -- i.e., the entire patient population. That the results of individual reviews \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 30   Filed 01/21/20   Page 15 of 16\nmay vary does not dilute the across-the-board nature of the mandate to assess all patients. \nPlaintiffs are asking here for a classwide review, not for the Court to order Defendants to dictate \na uniform outcome for each review. Thus, this remedy, like the others requested, would provide \nrelief to the entire class. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully ask this Court to certify the proposed \nclass under Rule 23(b)(2) and appoint Plaintiffs’ Counsel as Class Counsel pursuant to Rule \n23(g). \nDated:   January 21, 2020      Respectfully submitted, \n            /s/ John A.

Civil Action No. 19-3185 (RDM) \n \nBARBARA J. BAZRON, et al., \n \n  Defendants. \n \n \nORDER \nFor reasons set forth in the accompanying Memorandum Opinion, Dkt. 95, the Court \nconcludes that Plaintiffs have established that they are entitled to some, but not all, of the \npreliminary relief they seek.  Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ motion for a \npreliminary injunction, Dkt. 87, is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.  It is further \nORDERED that:  \n1.  Exposed Patients.  To the extent medically and psychiatrically practicable, Defendants \nshall isolate individuals who have been exposed to COVID-19 in individual quarantine \nspaces and shall minimize movement outside of the isolation space.  When it is necessary \nfor isolated individuals to leave their rooms, Defendants shall require (to the extent \npossible and consistent medically and psychiatrically practicable) that the isolated patient \nwear a medically suitable mask.  Likewise, when it is necessary for another person to \nenter a room occupied by an isolated patient, that person shall (to the extent medically \nand psychiatrically practicable) wear suitable protective equipment, including a medically \nsuitable mask.  Isolation of a patient who has been exposed to COIVD-19 may \ndiscontinued after the patient receives two negative tests at least 24 hours apart or if the \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 96   Filed 05/24/20   Page 2 of 3\npatient is not symptomatic for 14 days.  Newly admitted patients who have tested \nnegative and who do not demonstrate any symptoms shall be considered “exposed” and \nsubject to the conditions set out in this paragraph.   \n2.  Staff Assignment Restrictions.  To the extent medically and psychiatrically practicable, \nhealth care personnel and other staff shall be assigned daily to only one unit.  If health \ncare personnel work overtime, they shall, if medically and psychiatrically practicable, be \nassigned to the same unit where they worked that day.  \n3.  Point prevalent testing (“PPS”).  To the extent they have not already done so, Defendants \nshall promptly complete the second point prevalence survey to determine the spread of \nCOVID-19 among staff and, to the extent medically and psychiatrically practicable, \nresidents at Saint Elizabeths Hospital.  A single test for each staff member or patient is \nsufficient for purposes of the PPS.  If a staff member is found to be COVID positive, the \nstaff member must be excluded from the Hospital for 14 days and until the staff member \ntests negative for COVID-19 on two consecutive occasions, at least 72 hours apart.  \nFollowing completion of the second PPS test, Saint Elizabeths shall complete an \nadditional PPS every two weeks pending further order of the Court.  Defendants shall \nprovide updates to the Court and to Plaintiffs’ counsel on the day following the \ncompletion of each further PPS.  When Defendants conclude that further PPS testing is \nno longer warranted in light of improved conditions at the Hospital, they shall meet and \nconfer with Plaintiffs and shall file a joint status report with the Court setting forth the \nparties’ respective positions regarding the termination of this requirement. \n4.  Additional Amici Recommendations.  In order to streamline further litigation in this a \nmatter, Defendants shall file a status report on or before June 8, 2020, indicating whether \nthey have considered implementing the recommendations set out by amici and detailing: \n(i) which, if any, recommendations they have adopted, (ii) a timeline for any \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 96   Filed 05/24/20   Page 3 of 3\nrecommendations that they plan to adopt, (iii) which recommendations they have rejected \nand the grounds for rejecting them, and (iv) which, if any, recommendations they require \nadditional time to consider. \n5.  Persons and Entities Bound.  This Order is binding on Defendants, their officers, agents, \nservants, employees, and attorneys, and on other persons acting in concert with them. \nSO ORDERED. \n                                      /s/ Randolph D.

Civil Action No. 19-3185 (RDM) \n \n \nBARBARA J. BAZRON, et al., \n \n  Defendants. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \nPlaintiffs Enzo Costa, Vinitia Smith, and William Dunbar, three patients who are \nindefinitely and involuntarily committed to the District of Columbia’s care and housed at Saint \nElizabeths Hospital (“Saint Elizabeths” or the “Hospital”), bring this action on behalf of \nthemselves and a putative class of similarly situated persons.  Plaintiffs allege that the District, \nthe Director of the D.C. Department of Behavioral Health, and the Chief Executive Officer of the \nHospital have violated the constitutional rights of patients at Saint Elizabeths by failing to ensure \nthat they are housed in safe conditions in the face of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and by \nfailing to provide them with adequate mental health treatment during the pandemic.  See Dkt. 50.  \nThey further allege that Defendants have continued to detain patients deemed “ready for \ndischarge” in violation of the Americans with Disability Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §12131 et seq. \nand the Constitution.   Dkt. 87 at 6.  On April 25, 2020, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a \ntemporary restraining order (“TRO”) in part, Dkt. 59, and ordered that Defendants adopt certain \ninfectious disease control and prevention measures and that they provide periodic reports to the \nCourt, Dkt. 60.  The Court later extended the TRO and expanded it in two respects relating to \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 2 of 36\ninfectious disease control and prevention.  Dkt. 83.  Plaintiffs now seek to convert the TRO into \na preliminary injunction and request that the preliminary injunction also include relief relating to \nthe Hospital’s provision of mental health services and the discharge of patients.  Dkt. 87.  \nDefendants oppose the motion.  Dkt. 90.  For the reasons explained below, the Court will convert \ncertain aspects of the TRO into a preliminary injunction but will deny Plaintiffs’ other requests \nfor preliminary relief.   \nI.  BACKGROUND \nThe Court has recounted much of the relevant factual background and procedural history \nat length in its earlier memorandum opinions, see Costa v. Bazron, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n73944, at *2–14 (D.D.C. Apr. 25, 2020) (“Costa I”); Costa v. Bazron, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n83565, at *2 (D.D.C. May 11, 2020) (“Costa II”), and will only summarize and add to that \nbackground as necessary for the pending motion. \nSaint Elizabeths is the District of Columbia’s “only public psychiatric facility for \nindividuals with serious and persistent mental illness who need intensive inpatient care to \nsupport their recovery.”  Dkt. 50 at 7 (Am. Compl. ¶ 25).  “The [H]ospital can support a census \nof 296 patients and has a workforce of 786 staff members.”  Dkt. 81 at 3.  The named plaintiffs \nin this case are three patients indefinitely and involuntarily committed to the District of \nColumbia’s care and housed at Saint Elizabeths.  Id. at 6–7 (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 19–22).  According \nto counsel for Defendants, each of the named plaintiffs was committed following a verdict of not \nguilty by reason of insanity, and each may be released only with a court order.  See May 22, \n2020 Hrg. Tr. (Rough at 38).   \nThe COVID-19 pandemic is, by now, well-known to all.  On March 20, 2020, Saint \nElizabeths “identified” the first case of COVID-19 at the facility “but obtaining the . . . test and \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 3 of 36\nthe [test] results [for that patient] was delayed until April 1, 2020.”  Dkt. 81 at 3.  On April 13, \n2020, less than two weeks after the Hospital publicly reported the first case, it reported that “28 \npatients and 43 staff had tested positive for COVID-19,” that “105 patients were in either \nisolation or quarantine,” and that “four patients ha[d] died.”  Dkt. 36 at 3.     \nWithin days of that public report,1 Plaintiffs moved for a TRO, asserting that the rapid \nspread of the virus at the Hospital was caused by, among other things, Defendants “failure to \nimplement CDC Guidance regarding testing of symptomatic individuals, medical isolation of \nsymptomatic individuals, [and] quarantine of persons who test positive for COVID-19.”  Dkt. 36 \nat 3.  Plaintiffs also argued that the Hospital failed to comply with CDC guidance with respect to \nsocial distancing, mask use, and hygienic practices.  See, e.g., Dkt. 39-6 at 1 (Costa Decl. ¶¶ 4–\n7); Dkt. 39-6 at 1–3 (Guzman Decl. ¶ 3a–c); see also Dkt. 42-5 at 5 (Pontes Decl. ¶ 10) (attesting \nthat staff does “as much as they can to ensure patients practice social distancing,” but reporting \nthat it “is difficult to enforce without impinging on patient autonomy”); id. at 6 (Pontes Decl. \n¶ 13) (attesting that patients have access to face masks upon request and that “[s]ome patients \nchoose to wear masks, others do not”).  Finally, Plaintiffs maintained that the Hospital had also \nfallen short in its provision of mental health services during the pandemic and, in particular, that \nthe Hospital was not taking steps to ensure that the patients received the mental health care they \nrequire (such as by providing remote alternatives for group and individual therapy); was not \nupdating mental health treatment plans to account for pandemic-related stress; and was not \nreleasing eligible patients into community-based programming.  See, e.g., Dkt. 39 at 33.   \n                                                 \n1  Although the motion for a TRO was filed on April 18, 2020, Plaintiffs had filed a motion for \nan emergency hearing two days prior, on April 16, 2020.  See Dkt. 36.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 4 of 36\nAfter expedited proceedings that focused on the most pressing issues, the Court granted \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order in part.  Dkt. 59.  Among other things, the \nTRO required Saint Elizabeths, “[t]o the extent medically and psychiatrically practicable,” to \nisolate individuals who had been exposed to COIVD-19; to “conduct clinical evaluations prior to \nreleasing patients suspected of having COVID-10 . . . from isolation” and, in cases involving \nheightened “clinical suspicion,” to “administer test-based criterion of two negative tests . . . prior \nto discontinuing isolation;” and to report to the Court and Plaintiffs’ counsel regarding \ncompliance with these requirements.  Dkt. 60.  As the Court noted in its memorandum opinion, \nby April 23, 2020, forty-three Saint Elizabeths patients had tested positive for the virus and \nseven had died—a mortality rate magnitudes higher than the rate for the District as a whole.  See \nDkt. 80 at 48 (estimating that the Hospital’s mortality rate was “40 times” that of the general \npopulation in the District).  \nFollowing the entry of the TRO, the Court appointed Dr. Ronald Waldman, Ms. Joan \nHebden, and Dr. Patrick Canavan as amici curiae to conduct an investigation and to provide \ninformation to the Court relating to a list of questions relevant to Plaintiffs’ claims.  Dkt. 68.  On \nMay 11, 2020, the amici filed their reports with the Court, summarizing their findings and \nrecommendations.  Dkt. 78; Dkt. 81.  That same day, the Court found that good cause existed to \nextend the TRO until May 22, 2020 because (1) the parties needed time to brief Plaintiffs’ \nmotion for preliminary injunction; (2) the public health crisis at the Hospital was ongoing; and \n(3) Defendants good faith efforts to comply with the TRO did not obviate the need for court-\nordered relief.  Dkt. 82.  The Court further found that the TRO should be expanded to require \nDefendants to conduct “point prevalence surveys” (“PPSs”) and to restrict cross-unit staff \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 5 of 36\nmovements—both CDC recommended measures that amici found the Hospital had yet to \nimplement in important respects.   \nPlaintiffs now move to convert the TRO into a preliminary injunction and to include \nadditional relief that goes beyond that included in the TRO.  Dkt. 87.  Defendants oppose \nPlaintiffs’ motion.  Dkt. 90.  The Court heard oral argument on the motion earlier yesterday.  To \ndate, thirteen Saint Elizabeths patients and one staff member have died from the virus. \nII.  LEGAL STANDARDS \n“Preliminary injunctive relief is ‘an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon \na clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.’”  Banks v. Booth, No. 20-849, 2020 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 68287, at *15 (D.D.C. Apr. 19, 2020) (quoting Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d \n388, 392, (D.C. Cir. 2011)).  To obtain a preliminary injunction, a movant “must establish [1] \nthat he is likely to succeed on the merits, [2] that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the \nabsence of preliminary relief, [3] that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] that an \ninjunction is in the public interest.”  Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1038 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  \nWhen seeking such relief, “the movant has the burden to show that all four factors, taken \ntogether, weigh in favor of the injunction.” Abdullah v. Obama, 753 F.3d 193, 197 (D.C. Cir. \n2014) (quoting Davis v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 571 F.3d 1288, 1292 (D.C. Cir. 2009)) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  Before the Supreme Court’s decision in Winter v. NRDC, \n555 U.S. 7 (2008), courts in this circuit applied a “sliding-scale” approach under which “a strong \nshowing on one factor could make up for a weaker showing on another.”  Sherley v. Sebelius, \n644 F.3d 388, 392 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  Since Winter, the D.C. Circuit has hinted on several \noccasions that “a likelihood of success is an independent, free-standing requirement,” id.  at 393 \n(quotation omitted), but it “has not yet needed to decide th[e] issue,” League of Women Voters of \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 6 of 36\nU.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  “In light of this ambiguity, the Court shall \nconsider each of the [four] factors and shall only evaluate the proper weight to accord the \nlikelihood of success if the Court finds that its relative weight would affect the outcome.”  Banks, \n2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68287, at *7. \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nA.         Likelihood of Success On The Merits \nThe Court must first consider whether Plaintiffs have established a likelihood of success \non the merits.   \n1.          Due Process \n“[W]hen the State takes a person into its custody and holds him there against his will, the \nConstitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety \nand general well-being.”  DeShaney v. Winnebago Cty. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 199–\n200 (1989) (citing Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982)).  Involuntarily “committed \npersons have a constitutional right, protected by the due process clauses of the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments, in the government meeting that obligation.”  Costa I, 2020 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 73944, at *16.  In Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982), the Supreme Court held \nthat because “[p]ersons who have been involuntarily committed are entitled to more considerate \ntreatment and conditions of confinement than criminals whose conditions of confinement are \ndesigned to punish,” id. at 321–22, the “deliberate-indifference standard” applicable to prisoners’ \nrights is not controlling in cases involving involuntarily committed persons, id. at 312 n.11.  \nInstead, “the proper balance between the legitimate interests of the State and the rights of the \ninvoluntarily committed” is reflected by a “professional judgment” standard.  Id. at 321.  The \nparties agree that the Youngberg provides the applicable standard for assessing Plaintiffs’ due \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 7 of 36\nprocess claims.  See May 22, 2020 Hrg. Tr. (Rough at 13) (“We agree that it is the Youngberg \nstandard.”). \nUnder the Youngberg standard, “liability may be imposed only when the decision by the \nprofessional [constitutes] such a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, \npractice, or standards as to demonstrate that the person responsible actually did not base the \ndecision on such a judgment.”  Id. at 323.  In assessing the choices made, it is not appropriate for \na court to “specify which of several professionally acceptable choices should have been made,” \nbut, at the same time, the court must “make certain that professional judgment in fact was \nexercised.”  Id. at 321 (quotation omitted).  Although an involuntarily committed person need \nnot show deliberate indifference to prevail, the Youngberg standard “requires more than simple \nnegligence” on the part of the State.  Kulak v. City of New York, 88 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 1996); \nsee also Patten v. Nichols, 274 F.3d 829, 843 (4th Cir. 2001) (collecting cases holding that \nYoungberg requires more than negligence but less than deliberate indifference).  This deferential \nstandard recognizes that judges are not “better qualified than appropriate professionals” to make \ndecisions relating to the physical and mental health of patients and that, to the extent possible, \n“interference by the federal judiciary with the internal operations of . . . institutions [for \ninvoluntarily committed individuals] should be minimized.”  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 322.  In \nassessing whether a decisionmaker exercised professional judgment, moreover, the Court must \napply the test in light of all of the relevant circumstances: here, the rapidly evolving demands on \nthe decisionmakers but also the devastation caused at the Hospital by the virus.  The Court \ncannot treat the prevalence of the virus and the number of deaths it has caused at the Hospital as \nprima facie evidence of a failure to exercise professional judgment, nor can it ignore that \ntroubling context. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 8 of 36\nPlaintiffs’ due process claims fall into two general categories: (1) infectious disease \ncontrol and prevention measures and (2) the provision of mental health care.  The Court will \nconsider each category in turn.   \na.          Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Measures \nThe Court has already issued two opinions analyzing Defendants’ infectious disease \ncontrol and prevention measures and has concluded that their response has, at least in certain \nrespects, substantially departed from accepted professional judgment.  The present motion does \nnot mirror Plaintiffs’ motion for a TRO, however, in four respects.   \nFirst, Defendants now point to evidence of their compliance with the Court’s orders and \nto improvements they have made in their efforts to stem the spread of the virus to suggest that \ninjunctive relief is no longer warranted.  See, e.g., Dkt. 90 at 46 (“[T]he District’s reports to the \nCourt confirm the Hospital’s continued compliance with the measures the Court has ordered.”).  \nAlthough the Court commends Defendants for implementing those measures, Defendants cannot \nclaim that the need for an injunction is now moot because the Hospital has “ceased its wrongful \nconduct,” Taylor v. Resolution Trust Corp., 56 F.3d 1497 (D.C. Cir. 1995), particularly where it \ndid so following the entry of a TRO.  A “‘court’s power to grant injunctive relief survives \ndiscontinuance of the illegal conduct,’ . . . because the “‘purpose . . . is to prevent future \nviolations.’”  U.S. Dep’t of Justice v. Daniel Chapter One, 89 F. Supp. 3d 132, 143 (D.D.C. \n2015), aff’d, 650 F. App’x 20 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting United States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 \nU.S. 629 (1953)).  If compliance with the terms of a TRO were sufficient to defeat entry of a \npreliminary injunction, few—if any—cases would make it past the TRO stage.  That is true even \nwhen, as here, a defendant has acted conscientiously and in good faith. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 9 of 36\nSecond, Defendants point to new evidence regarding the Hospital’s efforts to combat the \nspread of the virus, both before and after entry of the TRO.  In granting Plaintiffs’ motion for a \nTRO, the Court acknowledged that “additional development of the record might show that \nDefendants are taking sufficient precautions not evident on the current record.”  Costa I, 2020 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 73944, at *25.  Since the Court issued that opinion, the record has grown by \nhundreds of pages, including additional declarations and, importantly, the report of the Court-\nappointed amici.  The Court will discuss this evidence below in the context of each of the alleged \ndeficiencies in the Hospital’s response. \nThird, relying on the reports and recommendations of the Court-appointed amici, \nPlaintiffs seek to expand the scope of the injunction in certain respects.  Those reports and \nrecommendations, and the extraordinary efforts of amici more generally, have been of invaluable \nassistance to the Court and the parties.  The Court will address the additional measures \nrecommended by amici below in the context of considering each of Plaintiffs’ requests for relief.  \nFourth, Defendants conceded at the TRO stage “that Saint Elizabeths should be doing \nwhat is consistent with CDC guidance,” Dkt. 80 at 57, but they now offer a more nuanced \nposition.  Although they maintain that the Hospital has, in fact, complied with CDC guidance in \nall material respects, they also contend that the Youngberg standard does not demand compliance \nwith that guidance; rather, it requires only that the decisionmakers exercise professional \njudgment, which might not always track the guidance.  See Dkt. 90 at 25 (“[P]laintiffs are \nincorrect that a deficiency in care alone would establish a violation of their due process rights.”). \nIn the abstract, Defendants are correct that the failure to follow CDC guidance does not mean \nthat the Hospital failed to exercise professional judgment.  It is not difficult to imagine times, for \nexample, when the CDC guidance might be incompatible with the vital needs of a patient \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 10 of 36\nsuffering from severe mental illness.  But given the extraordinary threat to life and safety posed \nby the rapid spread of the virus among the Hospital’s patients, a failure to comply with \nsignificant CDC guidance raises the question why the guidance was not followed.  As noted \nabove, thirteen patients (and one member of the staff) have died and 79 patients have been \ninfected.  See Dkt. 87-1 at 9.  Although the population at the Hospital has declined over the past \ntwo months making mathematical precision difficult, roughly one out of every twenty patients \nhas died and more than one out of every three patients have been infected.  Against this tragic \nbackdrop, Defendants at least bear the burden of coming forward with some identified reason \nbased in professional judgment for failing to comply with CDC COVID-19 guidance.  See \nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 321 (observing that the Constitution requires that “courts make certain \nthat professional judgment in fact was exercised”).   \nAlthough Defendants are surely right that the “unfortunate circumstances” at the Hospital \ndo not, standing alone, amount to a constitutional violation, see Dkt. 90 at 29–30 (arguing that \nthere is no res ipsa loquitor principle for constitutional torts), the extraordinary circumstances at \nthe Hospital inform the baseline professional judgment against which to measure Defendants’ \nresponse.  At least with steps that could stem the spread of the virus at the Hospital, a failure to \ncomply with the CDC guidance requires some explanation grounded in professional judgment.   \n  With this context in mind, the Court now turns to the challenged decisions.  \ni.        Isolation and Quarantine Policies    \nThe parties (and amici) agree that the Hospital is now following many of the CDC’s \nrecommendations regarding isolation and quarantine.  See, e.g., Dkt. 81 at 14 (discussing the \npractices amici observed during on an on-site visit conducted on May 5, 2020 and remotely \nthrough video cameras).  But the parties draw different conclusions from the current state affairs.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 11 of 36\nIn Plaintiffs’ view, it was this litigation that led to the improved circumstances, and a preliminary \ninjunction is necessary to protect their safety so long as the virus remains present at the Hospital.  \nSee 87-1 at 6–7 (“While the Hospital has modified certain practices in response to this lawsuit, \nthese measures have not been enough.”).  Defendants disagree on two grounds.  They first assert \nthat there is no ongoing due process violation to remedy.  Second, they contend that it was never \nthe case that “Saint Elizabeths ‘was housing individuals with COIVD-19 symptoms together \nwith non-symptomatic individuals.’”  Dkt. 90 at 31.   \nDefendants’ first theory requires little discussion.  To the extent Plaintiffs are correct and \nthe Hospital failed to isolate symptomatic patients (who had not yet been tested) from non-\nsymptomatic patients until ordered to do so, mere compliance with the existing TRO does not \nobviate the need for preliminary relief.  See Mays v. Dart, No. 620-2134, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n73230, at *94 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 27, 2020) (converting a TRO that directed a prison to implement \nmeasures to protect detainees from COVID-19 into a preliminary injunction even though it \nappeared that the defendant had complied with the TRO);  see also Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., \n568 U.S. 85, 91 (2003) (“[A] defendant cannot automatically moot a case simply by ending its \nunlawful conduct once sued.”); United Air Lines, Inc. v. Air Line Pilots Ass’n, Int’l, 563 F.3d \n257, 275 (7th Cir. 2009) (recognizing that a district court has discretion to find that cessation is \n“not voluntary” where cessation occurs “only after a lawsuit has been filed”). \nConsideration of Defendants’ second theory, however, requires an understanding of the \nfactual record, as supplemented in the parties’ most recent submissions.  According to Plaintiffs, \nbefore they brought this suit, the Hospital was housing individuals with COVID-19 symptoms \ntogether with non-symptomatic individuals.  Moreover, even after symptomatic (and exposed) \npatients were separated from non-symptomatic (and non-exposed) patients, the Hospital did not \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 12 of 36\nquarantine symptomatic (and exposed) patients from one another.  Dkt. 87-1 at 20.  In support of \nthis contention, Plaintiffs cite several declarations.  They cite to Enzo Costa’s April 17, 2020 \ndeclaration, attesting that a “patient in [his] unit [was] symptomatic for COVID-19” yet was \nsimply “self-quarantining in his room” in the unit.  Dkt. 39-6 at 1 (Costa Decl. ¶ 6).  They cite to \nWilliam Dunbar’s April 17, 2020 declaration, which attests that until April 15, 2020, two \nCOVID-positive patients remained in his unit, with asymptomatic patients and potentially \nexposed patients, and continued to interact with other members of unit “in the common areas \nwhere they watch[ed] television or go water.”  Dkt. 39-7 at 1 (Dunbar Decl. ¶ 5).  According to \nDunbar, he was then transferred to the Therapeutic Learning Center (“TLC”), where a unit had \nbeen set up for exposed patients who were not symptomatic.  Dkt. 87-6 at 1 (Dunbar Supp. Decl. \n¶ 4).  Dunbar further attests that patients were “not tested for COVID-19” before being \ntransferred to the TLC and that it is his “understanding that most patients who had been moved \nfrom 2A to the TLC . . . ended up contracting COVID-19;” Dunbar himself contracted the virus \nafter being transferred to the TLC.  See id. (Dunbar Supp. Decl. ¶ 5).   \nPlaintiffs also point to the declaration of Yi-Ling Elaine Tu, the Infectious Control \nCoordinator for Saint Elizabeths, who notes that the Hospital had established the Patients Under \nInvestigation (“PUI”) unit for patients who were suspected of having COIVD-19 and who were \nawaiting test results, but who makes no reference to quarantining within that unit—that is, taking \nsteps to ensure that those suspected cases that were positive did not spread the virus to those \nsuspected cases who were negative.  Dkt. 42-5 at 4 (Tu Decl. ¶¶ 7–8).  Finally, Plaintiffs point to \nDr. Waldman’s conclusion that, even after the TRO was issued, the Hospital had accomplished \nthe cohorting of the patient population “reasonably well, but obviously imperfectly.”  Dkt. 77 at \n8. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 13 of 36\nIn response, Defendants also invoke Tu’s original declaration, which explained that the \nHospital had, prior to issuance of the TRO, housed “all of the . . . known positive COVID-19 \ncases . . . in two specific units . . . and that patients that exhibits symptoms [were] referred to the \nPatients Under Investigation Unit (PUI).”  Dkt. 42-5 at 4 (Tu Decl. ¶ 7).  To this, Defendants \nnow add a supplemental Tu declaration, which explains that the decision to house patients in the \nTLC was made “to minimize the transmission of COVID-19” and so that the Hospital could \ntransform unit 2A into a “COVID-19 positive unit.”  Dkt. 90-1 at 6 (Tu Suppl. Decl. ¶ 12).  She \nfurther attests that, prior to implementing that decision, she discussed it “via telephone and e-\nmail with Dr. Joel Selanikio from DC Health” and that, two days2 after the measure was \nimplemented, the CDC and DC Health visited Saint Elizabeths and “agreed with the Hospital’s \ndecision to move 17 asymptomatic patients from unit 2A to the [TLC] gymnasium.”  Id.; see also \nDkt. 90-2 at 4 (Selanikio Decl. ¶ 9) (attesting that he advised Tu that the Hospital could use the \nTLC to house asymptomatic patients “if necessary, to create a unit to cohort patients”).  On April \n24, 2020, a little over a week after the measure was implemented (and the same day the Hospital \nbegan receiving additional testing kits), “all patients on the TLC were moved back to a regular \nunit.”  Dkt. 90-1 at 6 (Tu Supp. Decl. ¶ 12).  Finally, Defendants cite to Dr. Waldman’s \nobservation that the Hospital “has made a remarkable effort” to quarantine and isolate patients \nbut that “[d]ue to delays in determining the viral status of all patients and [staff], along with the \nunavoidable mobility of [staff] into the community, maintaining the integrity of these units has \nproven to be challenging.”  Dkt. 81 at 4.   \n                                                 \n2  Dunbar attests that he was moved to the TLC on April 15, Dkt. 39-7 (Dunbar Decl. ¶ 6), and \nTu states that CDC and DC Health visited Saint Elizabeths on April 17, Dkt. 90-1 at 6 (Tu Supp. \nDecl. ¶ 12).  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 14 of 36\nThe flaw with Defendants’ response is that it does not address the principal ground on \nwhich the Court issued a TRO relating to the Hospital’s quarantining and isolation polices.  As \nthe Court explained: \nAccording to Defendants, the Hospital has already addressed the first pressing \nissue that Plaintiffs raise—the alleged failure to isolate patients exposed to the \nvirus—by treating all units as “quarantined.” . . . The problem with that assertion \nis that Defendants’ implementation of the quarantine does not satisfy CDC \nstandards.  The CDC recommends that long-term care facilities “[e]nforce social \ndistancing among residents,” “[e]nsure all residents wear a cloth face covering . \n. . whenever they leave their room or are around others,” and, if the virus “is \nidentified in the facility, restrict all residents to their rooms[.] \n \nDkt. 59 at 13.  Most importantly, Defendants fail to explain what “professional judgment” would \nsupport housing individuals exposed to the virus in the same space, without isolating patients \nfrom one another within that space to prevent those who were positive from infecting those who \nwere not.  Cf. Dkt. 55-1 at 6 (CDC LTCF Guidance) (instructing that “[i]f there are [COVID-19 \npositive] cases in the facility, [the facility should] restrict residents (to the extent possible) to \ntheir rooms except for medically necessary purposes”); see also Dkt. 39-3 at 3 (Stern Decl. ¶ 12) \n(declaration of Plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Marc Stern, indicating that the patients at the Hospital are \n“placed at an imminent and heightened risk from COVID-19,” if, among other things, the \nHospital fails “to place [a] person who ha[s] had close contact with [a] person suspected or \nproven to have COVID-19 in isolation in a timely manner”); see also id. at 5 (Stern Decl. ¶ 16) \n(“The Hospital must establish clinically effective quarantine for all individuals believed to have \nbeen exposed to COVID-19, but are not yet symptomatic[.]”). \nThe only evidence that Defendants offer that might controvert the Court’s prior findings \nthat the Hospital had substantially departed from professional judgment by not isolating exposed \npatients from one another is the declaration of Dr. Joel Selanikio, an epidemiologist with \napproximately 25 years of experience who served as a consultant for the D.C. Department of \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 15 of 36\nHealth’s “COVID-19 Response,” Dkt. 90-2 at 2–3 (Selanikio Decl. ¶¶ 2,6).3  He attests that \nbased on his conversations with Tu, his “understanding of Saint Elizabeths infections control \nmeasures, his own personal observations of the Hospital, and his conversations with CDC \npersonnel during his visit with them to the facility, he believes “that Saint Elizabeths practices \nrelated to the cohorting, isolation, and quarantine of patients at that time complied with CDC and \nDOH guidance.”  Id. at 4 ((Selanikio Decl. ¶ 11).  This conclusory assertion, however, neither (1) \nrefutes the premise that, before Plaintiffs moved for a TRO, the Hospital was not isolating \nexposed patients from other patients nor (2) demonstrates that such an evidently perilous practice \nwas a product of professional judgment.  Indeed, Defendants’ own representations suggest that \nthey only began treating all units “as though they are in quarantine” after Plaintiffs sought a \nTRO.  See 55-1 at 6 (CDC guidance recommending that all residents be isolated once there is a \npositive case); 53-2 at 2 (indicating, on April 23, 2020, that the Hospital had previously not \nplaced all units on quarantine but had now adopted that policy).   \nThe Court, accordingly, concludes that the foundation for its prior order relating to the \nneed to isolate exposed patients remains sound and that Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood \nof success on merits with respect to the need for this isolation (to the extent medically and \npsychologically practicable). \n \n \n                                                 \n3  Although the supplemental Tu declaration indicates that the Hospital was conducting some \nisolation for symptomatic patients prior to the TRO, see Dkt. 90-1 at 5 (Tu Supp. Decl. ¶ 8) \n(indicating that, as of March 30,2020, the Hospital was isolating two or three patients at a time in \nseparate rooms if they “exhibited potential COVID-19 symptoms”), it does not rebut Plaintiffs’ \nevidence that exposed patients were not being isolated.  It bears emphasis, moreover, that the \nexisting CDC guidance recommended that all residents, not merely symptomatic and exposed \npatients, be isolated once there is a case of COVID-19 in the facility.  See 55-1 at 6.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 16 of 36\nii.        Census Reduction          \nPlaintiffs next focus on the Defendants’ purportedly deficient efforts to reduce the patient \npopulation, sometimes referred to as the “census.”  Neither party disputes that reducing the \ncensus is recommended by the CDC and that it is “one of the best ways to continue to move \ntoward the elimination of the virus.”  Dkt. 81-1 at 1.  It is also undisputed that the Hospital has \nreduced the “census by 33%” since the pandemic began.  Dkt. 81 at 9; see also Dkt. 90-4 at 11 \n(Gontang Supp. Decl. ¶ 26) (“Since March 2019, the Hospital has successfully discharged 525 \npatients to the community.”).  Despite that “significant accomplishment,” Dkt. 78 at 9, Plaintiffs \nurge the Court to “order Defendants to periodically report on whether they are following \n. . .  recommendations [made by the amici] and [on] their efforts to further reduce the patient \ncensus.”  Dkt. 87-1 at 22.   \nIn support of their request, Plaintiffs contend that the bulk the patients that the Hospital \ndischarged were released “only pursuant to court order[s]” in the patients’ underlying \nproceedings and that “the number of discharges ‘has decreased noticeably since the middle of \nApril.”  Id. (quoting Dkt. 78 at 9).  In response, Defendants offer the declaration of Dr. Richard \nGontang, “the Chief Clinical Officer for Saint Elizabeths.”  Dkt. 90-4 at 2 (Gontang Supp. Decl. \n¶ 2).  He acknowledges that prior to the pandemic the Hospital met twice monthly with the \nDepartment of Behavioral Health (“DBH”) regarding the discharge of patients but that those \n“meetings have been temporarily suspended while both DBH and Saint Elizabeths focus on \nCOVID-19 pandemic response.”  Id. at 11 (Gontang Supp. Decl. ¶ 27).  He further reports, \nhowever, that the Hospital has continued to “work closely” with DBH to coordinate discharges \nand that the Hospital’s discharge rate in March and April was “consistent with pre-COVID \naverages.”  Id.   \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 17 of 36\nAs this evidence demonstrates, the discharge rate has “slowed” only relative to the \nHospital’s push to discharge a much-higher-than-usual number of patients at the onset of the \npandemic.  See Dkt. 78 at 4 (noting that “a substantial increase in discharges, has brought the \ncensus to historic low”).  In any event, even if the discharge rate has slowed, that would be \nunsurprising given that “[d]ischarge has become more difficult” due to conditions surrounding \nthe pandemic.  Id.  Indeed, guidance from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration (“SAMHSA”), which Plaintiffs have offered in support of their motion, warns \nthat in light of COVID-19 discharge planning may be “more difficult,” and it recommends that \ntreatment teams and staffs “should adjust with this expectation.”  Dkt. 87-3 at 4.   \nGiven these circumstances, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not established a \nlikelihood of success with respect to their challenge to Defendants’ census reduction efforts.   \niii.        Staff Cross-Contamination          \nAs explained by the Court-appointed amici, one of “[t]he greatest impediments to \ninterrupting transmission of virus within the facility is the re-introduction of virus from the \noutside community.”  Dkt. 81-1 at 5.  When staff return to the community after work, they may \nbe exposed to the virus; staff who then return to work and who are “asymptomatic or pre-\nsymptomatic carriers of the virus,” moreover, “can easily go undetected.”  Id.  Amici emphasize \nthat because of this risk effective infectious disease control requires reducing “traffic within the \nhospital”—specifically, that the Hospital must reduce staff movement between COVID positive \nand COVID negative units.  Dkt. 77 at 10–11.  Amici also underscore that the Hospital has “not \nrespected” this measure in the past.  Id.  Amici therefore recommend the Court require \nDefendants to comply with the CDC’s guidance that staff should “be assigned daily to only one \nunit” and, if staff work overtime, that they work “on the same unit they have been working [on] \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 18 of 36\nthroughout the day.”  Dkt. 81-1 at 5; see also Dkt. 54-1 at 10 (CDC recommending that facilities \nassign dedicated HCP to COVID positive or suspected units, meaning “HCP are assigned to care \nonly for these patients during their shift”).  At the same time, amici recognize that a psychiatric \nhospital is prone to “violent incidents [that] occasionally . . . require a hospital-wide response \nfrom . . . staff that may require rapid intervention to take place on a patient unit to which they are \nnot assigned.”  Dkt. 81-1 at 5.  In those circumstances, amici urge that “the physical safety of \nstaff and patients should be considered the highest priority,” even if it risks spreading the virus \nbetween units.  Id.   \nAgainst this backdrop, the Court has already concluded that the Hospital’s unexplained \nfailure to implement appropriate restrictions on staff assignments constituted a substantial \ndeparture from professional judgment.  See Dkt. 82 at 7–8; Dkt. 83 at 2.  Plaintiffs now request \nthat the Court extend this order “through the duration of the COVID-19 crisis.”  Dkt. 87-1 at 24.  \nDefendants, in turn, dispute that the “movement of staff across units runs afoul of CDC \nguidance.”  Dkt. 90 at 33.  Rather, they posit that the CDC guidance recommends only that \nfacilities “should” have units for COVID-positive residents with dedicated staff and that the \nfacilities should merely “consider creating a staffing plan” for those units.  Id. (quoting Dkt. 90-8 \n(the CDC Long-Term Care Facility Guidance Document)).  This argument misses the point.   \nAlthough the CDC recommendations may not mandate dedicated staff in all \ncircumstances, amici have made clear that it is critically important to reduce cross-staff \nmovement in the present context, and Defendants have offered no evidence that cross-staffing \nunder these dire circumstances is a product of considered professional judgment.  Amici’s \nrecommendation, moreover, was not merely an abstract suggestion about general best practices.  \nRather, after conducting an extensive and thorough assessment of conditions at the Hospital, \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 19 of 36\namici explained the reasons why staff are the most likely sources of reintroduction and further \nspread of COVID-19 at Saint Elizabeths.  See Dkt. 81-1 at 5.  Thus, even if CDC guidance does \nnot require dedicated staff in all circumstances, amici have persuasively explained why it is \nessential in the present context. \nDefendants own actions following the Court’s order support the conclusion that the \nexercise of acceptable professional judgment requires restricting cross-unit staff movement.  In \nparticular, Defendants have offered a supplemental declaration by Martha Pontes, “the Interim \nChief Nurse Executive for Saint Elizabeths.”  Dkt. 90-7 at 2 (Pontes Supp. Decl. ¶ 2).  She attests \nthat she “exercise[s] professional judgment in considering the need to properly and safely staff \neach unit to ensure patients receive adequate care and treatment.”  Id. at 3 (Pontes Supp. Decl. \n¶ 4).  She also explains that “[o]nce a shift begins, it is relatively rare that reassignment occurs” \nbut that she has “determined it is permissible in the following circumstances to ensure safe \nstaffing levels” on all units: (1) “when a patient experiences a behavioral emergency that requires \none-to-one staff supervision that could not otherwise be provided; (2) “when another staff \nmember suddenly falls ill or suffers an injury;” (3) “when a patient requires external \nhospitalization with one-to-one staff supervision;” and (4) “when patient behavior creates a \nsudden change in the acuity and risk to others on a unit.”  Id. at 3–4 (Pontes Supp. Decl. ¶ 5).  \nShe further attests that, whenever possible, “staff will be assigned for overtime on the same unit” \nbut that, if “necessary to ensure adequate staffing,” overtime may be approved “to work on a \ndifferent unit with the same COVID status or COVID-positive status.”  Id. at 4 (Pontes Supp. \nDecl. ¶ 6).   \nThree things are notable about the Pontes declaration.  First, it does not indicate—nor \ndoes any other evidence show—that the measures that Pontes attests are now in place were being \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 20 of 36\ntaken or even considered prior to this litigation.  Second, it offers no explanation about what \nprior policies existed or whether Defendants had exercised any professional judgment regarding \nthe need to restrict staff movement.  Third, it supports the proposition that, when Saint Elizabeths \nstaff did exercise professional judgment, it aligned with the recommendations set forth by the \nCDC and amici.  There is no evidence, however, that prior to this litigation a professional at \nSaint Elizabeths had exercised any considered judgment with respect to this issue.  \nThe Pontes declaration does support a finding that the Hospital is currently exercising \nprofessional judgment with respect to cross-staffing.  The question, then, is whether the \nHospital’s past failure to do so warrants continued relief.  Based on amici’s observations, it \nappears that the Hospital’s more cautious approach to cross-unit movement is a recent \ndevelopment.  Ms. Hebden testified, for example, that “[s]taff really needs to . . . pay a lot more \nattention to it” and that she “would like to be very emphatic in saying that while in the past this \nhas not been respected, there should be no mixing of staff between these units.”  Dkt. 77 at 11.  \nGiven this history, it appears that the Hospital’s efforts to limit cross-staffing were, at least in \npart, a product of this litigation.  As a result, even if Defendants are now restricting staff \nmovement, there is still a “cognizable danger of recurrent violation” sufficient to warrant further \ninjunctive relief.  Daniel Chapter One, 89 F. Supp. 3d at 143–44.  \nPlaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits with respect to cross-\nstaffing. \niv.        Testing  \nPlaintiffs contend that the Hospital has failed to exercise professional judgment relating \nto testing in three respects. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 21 of 36\nFirst, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants’ test-based release protocol was deficient prior to \nthis litigation.  At the TRO stage, the Court agreed, finding that Defendants had not followed the \nCDC-recommended protocol for returning symptomatic patients to the general population.  Dkt. \n59 at 16.  As the Court explained, Defendants had “offered no evidence that they [were] \nevaluating patients who ha[d] received a negative test for ‘clinical suspicion’ prior to release.”  \nId. at 15–16.  In briefing the instant motion, however, Defendants have now offered evidence to \nfill that gap—the supplemental Tu declaration.  Tu now explains that her original declaration \n“did not fully state the Hospital’s practice at the time.”  Dkt. 90-1 at 5 (Tu Supp. Decl. ¶ 9).  At \nthat time, she continues, “when a [patient under investigation’s (“PUI”)] result came back \nnegative,” a “general medical officer or nurse practitioner conducted a physical examination to \nrule out clinical suspicion of COVID-19 infection.”  Id.  “A patient would not automatically be \nreleased from PUI isolation if clinical suspicion was found.”  Id.  In light of this additional \nevidence, and in the absence of controverting evidence, the Court is no longer persuaded that the \nHospital’s release protocol was deficient.   \nSecond, Plaintiffs contend that before they moved for a TRO “the Hospital was not \ntimely or routinely testing patients with COVID-19 symptoms[] or individuals who ha[d] been \nexposed.”  Dkt. 90 at 24.  Defendants, in turn, have offered persuasive evidence that this \nshortcoming was not the result of a lapse in professional judgment.  Dr. Selanikio attests, for \nexample, that “[t]esting capacity for COVID-19 was severely limited through April 2020.”  Dkt. \n90-2 at 2–3 (Selanikio Decl. ¶ 8).  He also attests that Tu “often requested increased testing \ncapability for patients in Saint Elizabeths that went beyond the minimum recommended by the \nCDC and DOH.”  Id.  Likewise, Tu attests that she requested that testing kits be made available \nand that the Hospital “received its first 20 test kits” on April 9, 2020 “through the District of \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 22 of 36\nColumbia Department of Forensic Services.”  Dkt. 90-1 at 4 (Tu Suppl. Decl. ¶ 7).  She also \nexplains that, at that time, “DC Health recommended testing only patients with symptoms related \nto COVID-19 and who fit the criterion for testing, according to the then-current DC Health \nNotice.”  Id.  at 4–5 4 (Tu Suppl. Decl. ¶ 7). \nOn the existing record, Plaintiffs’ contention regarding the level of testing falls short in \nseveral respects.  To start, although resource constrains generally cannot “excuse constitutional \nviolations,” Birrell v. Brown, 867 F.2d 956, 959 (6th Cir. 1989), Plaintiffs have offered no \nevidence that the shortage in tests was the result of a decision attributable to Defendants rather \nthan a result of the nation-wide shortage in testing capacity.  Absent such evidence, Defendants \ncannot be faulted for not conducting more extensive testing.  Cf. Dkt. 92 at 12–13 (noting that on \nApril 9, when the Hospital received 20 testing kits, it reported “142 patients who were \nsymptomatic or exposed”).  At oral argument, when the Court asked Plaintiffs’ counsel about \nthis, counsel argued that Defendants had other avenues for testing these patients, such as \ntransferring them to local hospitals.  See May 22, 2020 Hrg. Tr. (Rough at 15).  But, even if that \nis right, it has no bearing on whether the Court should grant the preliminary injunctive relief \nPlaintiffs seek.  The Hospital now has the capacity to test all patients on the premises, so there is \nno need to issue an injunction that would require transporting patients to local hospitals for \ntesting.  Nor is there any reason to believe that the Hospital will, in the future, fail promptly to \ntest any symptomatic or exposed patient or that the Hospital obtained the in-house testing \nequipment only because of this lawsuit.  Finally, Plaintiffs have not shown that any patients who \nsatisfied the then-existing guidance for testing, which was evidently premised on the shortage of \ntesting capacity, was not tested.  The lack of adequate testing likely contributed to the early \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 23 of 36\nspread of the virus at the Hospital.  There is no evidence, however, that Defendants were to \nblame. \n Third, and finally, Plaintiffs request that the Court direct Defendants to adopt recurring \nPPS testing, which both the CDC and amici recommend.  As amici explain, the CDC \nrecommends PPS testing both residents and staff in facilities with new, confirmed COVID-19 \ncases to control the spread of the disease.  See Dkt. 82 at 6–7; see also CDC, Testing for \nCoronavirus (COVID-19 in Nursing Homes (Apr. 30, 2020), available at \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/nurding-homes-testing.html.  Initial and \nrecurring PPS testing is important because undetected, asymptomatic patients and health care \npractitioners often contribute to the further spread of the virus.  See Dkt. 82 at 6.  After \nconsidering that evidence and amici’s detailed explanations about the critical need for PPS \ntesting, the Court concluded that the failure to conduct PPS testing was likely a substantial \ndeparture from professional judgment.  Id. at 6–7.  As a result, the Court amended its TRO to \ndirect Defendants to follow the PPS testing recommendation.  Dkt. 83.  Following an initial PPS, \nthe Hospital identified twenty-one “employees who tested positive,” Dkt. 91 at 3, at least \nseventeen of which were “asymptomatic,” Dkt. 88 at 3. \nDefendants do not dispute that amici have correctly identified the urgent need for PPS \ntesting to stem the spread of virus as the Hospital; that the CDC also recommends PPS testing as \npart of a test-based infection control strategy; and that the initial PPS testing helped identify a \nsignificant number of asymptomatic, COVID-positive staff.  Defendants also do not claim that \nany resource constraints impede their ability to conduct additional PPS testing (although they \nmay be unable to test staff on leave and staff who are working remotely).  See May 22, 2020 \nHrg. Tr. (Rough at 34).  Instead, they note only that the CDC did not recommend PPS testing \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 24 of 36\nuntil May 2, 2020.  See Dkt. 90 at 31.  But given the tragic circumstances at Saint Elizabeths, \nthat does not explain why the Hospital waited over a week—and until after amici had impressed \non the Court the critical need for PPS testing for staff—before beginning to test staff.  \nSignificantly, Defendants do not claim that they had planned on conducting PPS testing of staff \nbefore amici urged the Court to require that they do so, and, unlike with respect to other \ninfectious disease control measures, Defendants have said nothing about their plans to continue \nperiodic testing after the TRO expires.  Cf. Dkt. 90 at 47 (indicating that Defendants “intends to \ncontinue the first three items in [P]laintiffs’ proposed order [even] . . . without Court-ordered \nrelief”); Dkt. 87-10 at 2 (Proposed Order ¶ 4) (“Point Prevalence Surveys.”).   \nAs amici explained, the need for PPS testing—and, in particular, testing staff who have \ncontact with the outside community—is essential to stemming the spread of the disease at the \nHospital.  Amici further opined that, given the other measures that the Hospital has taken, the \nmost likely source of the continued spread of the virus at Saint Elizabeths is staff.  See, e.g., Dkt. \n77 at 24 (“[W]e would expect that in light of the community prevalence of COVID-19 and the \nviral circulation, that we are going to potentially have introduction by staff.”).  That opinion, \nmoreover, proved prescient.  When the Hospital tested its staff, as amici urged, it identified \ntwenty-one COVID-19 positive employees, who were then placed on leave; most (if not all) of \nthese employees were asymptomatic.  See Dkt. 88 at 3; 93 at 3.  Without that testing, it appears \nlikely that some of these staff members would have unwittingly spread the virus to patients at the \nHospital, restarting the cycle of infection.   \nNotably, Defendants have offered no justification sounding in professional judgment for \nnot periodically testing all patients (with the exception of those who refuse to participate) and all \nstaff (who are not on leave or working from home) for the virus—at least while the crisis at the \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 25 of 36\nHospital continues.  The Court, accordingly, concludes that Defendants’ delay in testing all staff \nand their lack of a plan to continue testing all patients and staff constitutes a substantial departure \nfrom professional judgment.   \nv.        Staff Infection Control Practices \nThe final infection control issue that Plaintiffs raise is a general concern about staff \ninfection control practices.  Relying on Ms. Hebden’s observations that the Hospital staff was not \nproperly implementing infectious disease control in certain respects, Plaintiffs request that the \nCourt “order independent monitoring to ensure that Defendants are complying with amici \nrecommendations and CDC guidance regarding hygiene practices for the duration of the \nCOVID-19 crisis.”  Dkt. 87-1 at 28.  Although amici identified some shortcomings, the Court is \nunpersuaded that imposing the drastic step of appointing an independent monitor is warranted at \nthis time.  There is evidence that the Hospital is making ongoing efforts to train staff about \nproper infection control measures.  Tu attests, for example, that just last week the CDC provided \ntraining sessions and that D.C Department of health has assigned an “advisor that will be making \non-site visits.”  Dkt. 90-1 at 8–9 (Tu Supp. Decl. ¶ 19).  She also indicates that “on an ongoing \nbasis, . . . Nurse Educators will continue to offer the same training to all employees at the \nHospital.”  Id.  Tu also explains that due to a recent increase in the Hospital’s supply of N95 \nmasks the Hospital has now changed its “practices on respirator use,” and staff is no longer \nreusing masks in the way that Hebden had flagged as an issue.  Id. at 8 (Tu Supp. Decl. ¶ 20).  \nGiven these measures, the Court is not convinced that appointment of an independent monitor is \ncurrently warranted.  Should issues persist, Plaintiffs may renew this request. \n \n \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 26 of 36\nb.          Mental Health Treatment  \nThe next category of claims that Plaintiffs advance concern mental health treatment.  As \nPlaintiffs note and Defendants do not dispute, COVID-19 has had a significant impact on patient \nmental health, causing anxiety and stress to an already susceptible population.  See generally \nDkt. 78 (discussing Saint Elizabeths provision of mental health care before and during the \npandemic).  Plaintiffs contend that Defendants have not risen to the task of providing adequate \nmental health care in response to the pandemic.  See Dkt. 87-1 at 30–35.  They assert, moreover, \nthat Defendants have not taken adequate steps to address the “blanket closures of treatment areas \nand [the] suspension of in-person therapy.”  Id. at 34.  To remedy these shortcomings, Plaintiffs \nrequest that the Court order Defendants to “develop alternative methods” of providing group \ntreatments; to procure “iPads or similar devices for each patient,” along with other technology; \nand to “conduct an individual assessment” of each patient’s mental health needs.  Dkt. 87-10 at \n3–4 (Proposed Order).     \n  As a threshold matter, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing with respect to \ntheir mental-health-services claims because they “have not argued that the mental health care of \n[the non-party patients] could cause any injury to them in particular, and the relief they request \nwould require the Hospital to alter the individual treatment plans of nearly 200 patients who are \nnot parties to this case.”  Dkt. 90 at 37.  The Court must, accordingly, address standing before \nturning to the merits of these claims.   \nThe “irreducible constitutional minimum of standing requires: (1) that the plaintiff have \nsuffered an ‘injury in fact’—an invasion of a judicially cognizable interest which is (a) concrete \nand particularized and (b) actual and imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) that there be \na causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of—the injury must be fairly \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 27 of 36\ntraceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the independent action \nof some third party not before the court; and (3) that it be likely, as opposed to speculative, that \nthe injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 167 \n(1997).   \nAt oral argument, the Court asked Plaintiffs to address their standing to assert claims \nrelating to the Hospital’s general mental-health-treatment practices, as opposed to practices \ndirectly affecting their personal interests.  In response, Plaintiffs asserted that there is a nexus \nbetween the provision of mental health care to non-party patients and the named Plaintiffs \nbecause the named Plaintiffs require group treatment.  In other words, Defendants’ failure to \ndevelop alternative group treatment methods and failure to acquire the technology needed to \nimplement such measures are causing Plaintiffs harm because their well-being depends on the \navailability of group therapy.  Assuming that the failure to provide alternative group therapy \nmethods violates Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, which the Court must assume for purposes of \nassessing standing, see Cutler v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 797 F.3d 1173, 1179–80 \n(D.C. Cir. 2015) (courts must assume the merits of plaintiff’s claim in assessing standing), the \nnexus Plaintiffs have articulated is sufficient to establish standing, but only in a limited respect: \nPlaintiffs have standing under this theory but only to seek relief that might be required to remedy \nthe Hospital’s failure to provide the them with some form (perhaps by videoconference) of group \ntreatment.  \nThe theory Plaintiffs advanced at oral argument is not broad enough, however, to \nencompass the sweeping, Hospital-wide relief that they seek.  Cf. Inmates of Occoquan v. Barry, \n844 F.2d 828, 841 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (“[O]nce a right is established the remedy chosen must be \ntailored to fit the violation.”).  Plaintiffs have identified no theory of how Defendants’ alleged \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 28 of 36\nfailure to take individualized mental health measures as to every patient at the Hospital, the vast \nmajority of which are not currently parties to this case, even arguably causes Plaintiffs any \ninjury, nor have they explained why Hospital-wide relief is needed to redress their asserted \ninjuries.  Perhaps recognizing that they cannot establish standing to press the full breadth of their \nclaim, Plaintiffs request that the Court provisionally certify a class.  Dkt. 92 at 19.  But because \nthe parties have not briefed this issue, the Court concludes that it would be premature even to \nprovisionally certify a class.4  If Plaintiffs want to move for provision class certification, they are \nfree to do so. \nHaving concluded that Plaintiffs have standing to challenge any deficiencies in the \nmental health care that they are personally receiving (or not receiving), the Court concludes that \nthey have failed to meet their burden of establishing a likelihood of success on the merits.  \nPlaintiffs focus largely on the curtailment of care, “including the closing of the [TLC], \nsuspension of group therapy, anger management, and competency restoration classes,” and on \nthe alleged failure of Defendants to “adequate steps to compensate of loss of this treatment, for \nexample by using teletherapy or virtual therapy.”  Dkt. 87-1 at 30–31.  Although the Court \nrecognizes the pressing need to provide mental health care to Plaintiffs, it is not yet persuaded \nthat Defendants’ omissions violate constitutional proscriptions.   \nTo begin, Plaintiffs do not dispute that Defendants’ decision to shut down in-person \ngroup therapy was a sound professional decision, see May 22, 2020 Hrg. Tr. (Rough at 25), nor \ncould they.  As Dr. Gontang explains, before the Hospital saw even its first infection, it decided \n“to suspend group therapy in the Therapeutic Learning Center,” because it “would present \n                                                 \n4  At oral arguments, the Court asked Plaintiffs whether they were aware of any cases in which a \ncourt had agreed to provisionally certify a class where plaintiffs raised that request solely in a \nreply brief, and counsel was unable to identify any such case.   \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 29 of 36\nunacceptable infection risks both from the movement of patients through the hospital and while \ncongregated in the TLC.”  Dkt. 90-4 at 3 (Gontang Supp. Decl. ¶ 4).  It is that decision, \nmoreover, that is largely responsible for what Plaintiffs characterize as a “dramatic” reduction in \nproviding group therapy.  In addition, as amici report, there has been “only a slight decline” in \nindividual therapy.  Dkt. 78 at 16.  Consistent with that observation, Plaintiff Dunbar attests that \nhe has been unable to attend his usual group therapy sessions, which were held in the TLC, but \nhas “had sessions with [his] therapist on the phone each Thursday.”  Dkt. 87-6 at 2 (Dunbar \nSupp. Decl. ¶¶ 15–17); see also Dkt. 87-5 (Costa Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 11–13) (similarly reporting that \nhe is obtaining weekly therapy but that he has not attended in group therapy in the TLC).     \nAlthough much of the treatment that patients typically receive at the Hospital is not \nindividualized, see Dkt. 78 at 11 (explaining that the TLC was a “linchpin[] of the Hospital’s \n“treatment delivery”), Defendants have made efforts to develop alternative methods of providing \ngroup treatment.  As Dr. Gontang explains, even before the first COVID-19 case at the Hospital \nwas identified and weeks before Plaintiffs filed their motion for a TRO, Saint Elizabeths began \nto develop plans to continue group therapy, including an initial plan that “contemplated \nconducting smaller group sessions on individual units by both on-unit providers” and other \nstaff.”  Dkt. 90-4 at 3 (Gontang Supp. Decl. ¶ 5).  In addition, the Hospital developed a \n“telehealth plan, dated March 30, 2020,” which has been “approved by Hospital Management,” \nand which the Hospital has been working to implement.  Id. at 3–4 (Gontang Supp. Decl. ¶ 6); \nsee also id. (Gontang Supp. Decl. ¶ 7) (discussing how Dr. Gontang has worked with the \nHospital’s IT department); see also Dkt. 78 at 17 (“Recognizing the need to modify treatment \nservice delivery in the near term, the Hospital continues to plan a limited telehealth program on \neach unit to allow for remote group therapy”).  Although the telehealth program has not been \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 30 of 36\nimplemented due to funding and logistical hiccups, those issues have now been resolved.  See id.  \nThe delays, moreover, must be understood in light the Hospital’s “first priority . . . to protect \npatients and staff from COVID-19.”  Dkt. 90-4 at 5 ((Gontang Supp. Decl. ¶ 9).   \n  All agree that the Hospital has failed to provide patients with all—or even a fraction—of \nthe psychiatric care that they received prior to the pandemic.  On the present record, however, \nthe Court cannot conclude that the Hospital has substantially departed from professional \njudgment, understood in light of the enormous challenges posed by the pandemic and the health \ncrisis at the Hospital.  Undoubtedly more can be done—and needs to be done—to provide for the \nmental health needs of a uniquely at-risk population.  If the Hospital fails in its current efforts to \nprovide telehealth or other forms of mental health care to Plaintiffs, they can return to the Court \nto seek preliminary relief.  On the present record, however, judicial intervention is not yet \nwarranted. \n2.          Monell \nIn their opposition brief, Defendants raise a further merits defense, albeit one that does \nnot turn on the extent to which the Hospital has provided Plaintiffs with acceptable medical and \npsychiatric care.  They contend, in particular, that Plaintiffs have not shown a likelihood of \nsuccess because their claims cannot clear the hurdle to municipal liability established in Monell \nv. Dep’t of Soc. Servs. of New York, 436 U.S. 658 (1978).  See Dkt. 90 at 39–41.  In Monell, the \nSupreme Court held that “a municipality cannot be held liable solely because it employs a \ntortfeasor”—in other words, under § 1983, a municipality cannot be held liable on a respondeat \nsuperior theory.  436 U.S. at 691.  “Instead, it is [only] when execution of a government’s policy \nor custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to \nrepresent official policy,  . . . that the government . . . is responsible under § 1983.”  Williams v. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 31 of 36\nJohnson, 537 F. Supp. 2d 141, 154 (D.D.C. 2008) (citing Monell, 436 U.S. at 694).  “[C]ourts \nhave identified a variety of ways that a municipality may adopt a ‘policy or custom’ sufficient to \nsupport municipal liability.”  Lightfoot v. District of Columbia, 273 F.R.D. 314, 320 (D.D.C. \n2011).     \nIn their reply brief, Plaintiffs argue that a municipality may be liable “where the \nconstitutional harm [can] be tied to the actions of a municipal ‘policymaker,’ a category confined \nto those ‘persons who have ‘final policymaking authority [under] state law.’” Id. (quoting Baker \nv. District of Columbia, 326 F.3d 1302, 1306 (D.C. Cir. 2003), and then Triplett v. District of \nColumbia, 108 F.3d 1450, 1453 (D.C. Cir. 1997)); see also Thompson v. District of Columbia, \n832 F.3d 339, 347–48 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (noting that a “single action can represent municipal \npolicy where the acting official has final policymaking authority over the ‘particular area, or \n. . . particular issue’” (quotation omitted)).  Here, Plaintiffs continue, Director Bazron is “a final \npolicy maker for responding to emergencies at Saint Elizabeths,” and the “record reflects \nDirector Bazron’s personal involvement in the Hospital’s response to COVID crisis.”  Dkt. 92 at \n21–22.  In support of those contentions, Plaintiffs point to several provisions of the D.C. Code \nthat give Director Bazron final policymaking authority over Saint Elizabeths and to evidence that \nDirector Bazron has been personally involved in the Hospital’s response to COVID-19 crisis.  \nDkt. 92 at 21–22.   \nAt oral argument, Defendants did not dispute that Director Bazron has final policy \nmaking authority over the Hospital or that she has been personally involved in overseeing the \npandemic response.  Instead, they argued only that Plaintiffs cannot succeed because Plaintiffs \n“raised their Monell arguments for the first time in reply.”  May 22, 2020 Hrg. Tr. (Rough at 50–\n51).  That contention is unavailing for two reasons.  First, in their amended complaint, Plaintiffs \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 32 of 36\nhave alleged facts that, if true, plausibly satisfy the Monell standard.  See Dkt. 50 at 40–41(Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 202–211) (alleging that Director Bazron has “final policymaking authority” and has \ndemonstrated her responsibility for conditions at the Hospital).  Second, although Defendants \nraised the issue in their pending motion to dismiss the original complaint, they have not even \nmentioned the issue since then, despite multiple hearings and rounds of briefing since Plaintiffs \namended their complaint.  Because Defendants did not invoke Monell as it relates to the \noperative complaint and the facts currently at issue until they filed their opposition brief, the \nCourt is unsympathetic to their objection that Plaintiffs only responded in their reply brief.   \nMoreover, and more importantly, the Court is persuaded that Plaintiffs have offered sufficient \nevidence to show “an ‘affirmative link,’ such that a municipal policy was the ‘moving force’ \nbehind the constitutional violation[s]” at issue here.  Baker, 326 F.3d at 1306 (quotations \nomitted).  The existing record supports the inference that Director Bazron “knew or should have \nknown of the risk of constitutional violations.”  Id. \n3.          ADA \nThe final merits issue to address is Plaintiffs contention that Defendants’ “continued \nhospitalization of patients [that are] ready for release” violates the Americans with Disabilities \nAct.  Dkt. 87-1 at 35.  Defendants respond, once more, that Plaintiffs lack standing to assert a \nclaim of unlawful segregation and the failure to accommodate disability under the ADA.  Dkt. 90 \nat 42–43.  Defendants are partially right.  To the extent Plaintiffs seek to invoke the rights of \nother patients at the Hospital, they lack standing.  In other respects, they have standing.  But \nthose claims lack sufficient merit or immediacy to support Plaintiffs’ request for preliminary \ninjunctive relief. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 33 of 36\nFirst, to the extent Plaintiffs argue that they have standing to press an ADA claim because \nthe failure to discharge patients is relevant to reducing their risk of infection, the Court has \nalready concluded that Defendants efforts to reduce the census are not violative of Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional rights.  Second, to the extent Plaintiffs press this claim on behalf of non-party \npatients, that fails for lack of standing.  Plaintiffs have offered no plausible theory, other than \ninfection reduction, for how they might have standing to press this claim on behalf of others.  \nThis leaves only the question whether Defendants have violated the named Plaintiffs’ ADA \nrights.  But, as explained below, even if Plaintiffs’ individual ADA claims were meritorious, \nwhich is doubtful on the present record, Plaintiffs have failed to show that they are likely to \nsuffer an irreparable injury if denied preliminary relief.  See Jubilant DraxImage Inc. v. United \nStates ITC, 396 F. Supp. 3d 113 (D.D.C. 2019) (noting that an irreparable injury is “the sine qua \nnon for obtaining a preliminary injunction”). \n*         *         * \nIn sum, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed only with respect to three \nmeasures (1) the isolation of exposed patients, (2) PPS testing, and (2) restrictions on cross-unit \nstaffing.  \nB.         Irreparable Harm \nAs to irreparable injury, the parties press similar arguments to those they raised with \nrespect to the TRO.  Plaintiffs again contend that the deprivation of constitutional rights, even for \na minimal period of time, constitutes irreparable injury and also rely on the imminent risk to their \nphysical and mental health.  See Dkt.  87-1 at 38–39.  Defendants, as before, do not dispute that a \nconstitutional violation or the risk of contracting COVID-19 would suffice to establish \nirreparable injury and, instead, argue that Plaintiffs cannot show irreparable injury because they \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 34 of 36\nhave failed to show any constitutional violation and because the Hospital is already taking \nefforts, including efforts Plaintiffs request, to protect the patients’ physical and mental well-\nbeing.  See Dkt. 90 at 46–47.  As before, the Court is unpersuaded by Defendants arguments.   \nTo start, the Court has concluded that Plaintiffs have established a likelihood of success \nof portions of their constitutional claims, and they are correct that a Fifth Amendment violation \nis itself irreparable.  See Mills v. District of Columbia, 571 F.3d 1304, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2009).  \nWith respect to those claims, moreover, Plaintiffs have also shown an imminent risk to their \nhealth and well-being, and the consequences of contracting the virus are irreparable.  As before, \nthe Court is unpersuaded by Defendants’ contention that there is no imminent risk to Plaintiffs’ \nhealth because the Hospital is already implementing or has implemented the measures Plaintiffs \nseek.  As discussed above, Defendants have offered no assurances that they will continue to \nconduct PPS testing nor can the Court determine whether the Hospital will adequately implement \nthe restrictions on cross-staffing.  As amici emphasized, however, these are core measures \nneeded to prevent the further spread and reintroduction of COVID-19.  See Dkt. 81-1 at 4 (“It is \ncritically important to understand that in order to stop ongoing transmission of the virus within \nSt. Elizabeths, the circulation of all patients and staff within the hospital must be curtailed.”); id. \nat 5 (“Voluntary testing is no longer acceptable. All personnel need to adhere to a testing \nschedule to be developed between St. Elizabeths leadership and DC health authorities in \naccordance with the recommended stipulations below.”).  And, although Defendants may now be \nisolating all units, amici also explained that, if possible, they must not integrate newly admitted \npatients with those units as there is “the potential of recent exposure.”  Id. at 1 (emphasizing that, \nas possible, new admits should “be housed as separately from both COVID units (where they \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 35 of 36\ncould be at risk of becoming infected if they are negative) and non-COVID units (where they \nmight transmit virus if they are positive)”).   \nDefendants are correct, however, that Plaintiffs have not established irreparable injury \nwith respect to their ADA claim.  To begin, unlike with their due process claim, Plaintiffs cannot \nrely on the mere possibility that an ADA violation has occurred (and it is doubtful that one has).  \nMore importantly, Plaintiffs have offered little, if any, evidence that were Saint Elizabeths to \nevaluate their discharge eligibility, they would in-fact be released to a less-restrictive setting at \nthis time or even in the reasonably foreseeable future.  If anything, the current record suggests \nthat Plaintiffs are, for the time being, unlikely candidates for release into a less-restrictive setting.  \nAs Dr. Gontang explained, the Hospital keeps “a ready-for-discharge list that identifies those \npatients who meet the clinical standard for discharge,” and “[n]one of the [P]laintiffs . . . is on \n[that] list at this time.”  Dkt. 90-4 at 10–11 (Gontang Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 24–25).  Moreover, as \ncounsel for Defendants noted at oral argument (without contradiction by Plaintiffs), many of the \nplaintiffs have been patients at the Hospital for years and, to the extent Plaintiffs were \ninvoluntarily committed following a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, they can be \nreleased only with the approval of the trial court.  See May 22, 2020 Hrg. Tr. (Rough at 46).   \nC.         Balance of Hardships and Public Interest \n  When the government is a party to the suit, the final factors to be considered in granting a \npreliminary injunction—the balance of the equities and the public interest—“are one and the \nsame, because the government’s interest is the public interest.”  Pursuing America’s Greatness v. \nFEC, 831 F.3d 500, 511 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (emphasis in original).  The Court finds that the public \ninterest weighs in favor of granting temporary injunctive relief. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 95   Filed 05/24/20   Page 36 of 36\nDefendants contend that further injunctive relief weighs against the public interest \nbecause the burdens it would impose are significant and because there is a “public interest in \npermitting the government to carry out its authorized functions where doing otherwise would \nneedlessly upend its operations.”  Dkt. 90 at 50 (citing Benisek v. Lamone, 138 S. Ct. 1942, 1945 \n(2018)).  These arguments might carry more weight were the Court ordering the full scope of \nrelief requested by Plaintiffs.  But the injunctive relief that the Court will enter is substantially \nnarrower and, for the most part, will require measures that Defendants are already implementing.  \nMoreover, the Court will tailor its order to ensure that it does not interfere with the ability of \nmedical and psychiatric professionals to make decisions on-the-spot about the health and well-\nbeing of their patients.  Most importantly, by mitigating the spread of infection, “Defendants \nactually lessen the healthcare burden that they will be facing in the weeks and months to come.”  \nBanks, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68287, at *48.  Finally, of course, it is always in the public \ninterest to vindicate constitutional rights.  See Montgomery v. Comey, 300 F. Supp. 3d 158, 175 \n(D.D.C. 2018) \nThe Court, accordingly, finds that the balance of the equities and the public interest \nweigh in favor of granting injunctive relief. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons explained above, the Court will GRANT in part and DENY in part Plaintiffs’ \nmotion for a preliminary injunction.  \nA separate order will issue. \n                                      /s/ Randolph D.

In short, the majority of the \nmeasures plaintiffs seek are already in place. In light of this fact, plaintiffs cannot \ndemonstrate irreparable harm absent a TRO, which would not significantly alter \ncurrent operations at the Hospital. In addition, plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on \nthe merits of their claims under the Due Process Clause or the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (ADA), and they have not shown that the balance of the equities and \nthe public interest weigh in their favor.  \nThroughout this pandemic, Saint Elizabeths has implemented a variety of \npatient-protection  protocols  amid  a  fast-moving  informational  landscape  and \nevolving recommendations from public health experts nationwide. Given that the \nHospital is already implementing the majority of the measures plaintiffs seek, there \nis no preliminary relief appropriate for this Court to grant. Plaintiffs’ motion for a \nTRO should be denied. \nBACKGROUND \n \nI.  COVID-19 in the District of Columbia \n \nOn March 7, 2020, officials announced the District’s first confirmed case of \nCOVID-19, an infectious respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus that has \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 7 of 45\n \nspread rapidly across the globe since its first detection in humans in late 2019. See \nPress Release, Gov’t of the District of Columbia, DC Department of Health Confirms \nFirst  Coronavirus  Case  (March  7,  2020),  available  at \nhttps://coronavirus.dc.gov/release/dc-department-health-confirms-first-coronavirus-\ncase;  D.C.  Health,  COVID-19  FAQs,  available  at \nhttps://coronavirus.dc.gov/node/1464356.  Although  the  virus’s  sufferers  have \nexhibited a range of symptoms or none at all, severe cases have been known to cause \nshortness of breath, pneumonia and even death. Id. The World Health Organization \n(WHO) has declared the spread of COVID-19 a global pandemic. See “WHO Director-\nGeneral’s Opening Remarks at the Media Briefing on COVID-19 – 11 March 2020,” \nWorld  Health  Organization,  March  11,  2020,  available  at \nhttps://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-\nthe-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020. \nSince early March 2020, U.S. cities and states have ordered the closure of \nschools and non-essential businesses, banned large gatherings and recommended \nthat individuals who do not live in the same household abide by now-familiar “social \ndistancing” measures where feasible. See, e.g., Jesse McKinley and Michael Gold, \nBan on Large Gatherings in N.Y. as Coronavirus Cases Rise Sharply, N.Y. Times, \nMarch  12,  2020,  available  at \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-event-ban.html; \nDominic Fracassa, SF bans large gatherings as nation moves to confront pandemic, \nSan  Francisco  Chronicle,  March  11,  2020,  available  at \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 8 of 45\n \nhttps://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Mayor-London-Breed-bans-all-large-\ngatherings-15123312.php. The District is no exception. On February 28, 2020, more \nthan a week before the District recorded its first case of COVID-19, Mayor Muriel \nBowser issued an order preemptively activating the District’s Emergency Operations \nCenter and requiring all District agencies to ensure they had up-to-date plans for \nemergency operations. See Mayor’s Order 2020-035, February 28, 2020, available at \nhttps://dchealth.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/doh/page_content/attachments/202\n0-035-District-Government-Preparation-for-the-Coronavirus-COVID-19.pdf.  \nWhile the District prepared in earnest, events unfolded quickly. By March 11, \n2020, Mayor Bowser issued a Declaration of Public Emergency and a Declaration of \nPublic Health Emergency based on the WHO declaration of a pandemic, as well as on \nthe outbreaks seen in other cities throughout the world. See Mayor’s Order 2020-045, \nMarch 11, 2020, available at https://mayor.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/ \nmayormb/release_content/attachments/MO.DeclarationofPublicEmergency03.11.20.\npdf;  Mayor’s  Order  2020-046,  March  11,  2020,  available  at \nhttps://mayor.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/mayormb/release_content/attachment\ns/MO.DeclarationofPublicHealthEmergency03.11.20.pdf.  Both  Declarations  have \nsince been extended through at least May 15, 2020, and the District remains under a \nstay-at-home  order. See Mayor’s  Order  2020-063,  April  15,  2020,  available  at \nhttps://coronavirus.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/coronavirus/publication/attachm\nents/MayorsOrder2020.063.pdf. \nDespite federal, state and local government efforts across the country, COVID-\n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 9 of 45\n \n19 has continued to spread rapidly, generating immense demand for protective face \nmasks,  gloves,  hand  sanitizer  and  other  products  used  to  limit  transmission  of \npathogens; a shortage of all these items has resulted. See United States Conference \nof Mayors, “Shortages of COVID-19 Emergency Equipment in U.S. Cities: A Survey \nof  the  Nation’s  Mayors,”  March  27,  2020,  available  at \nhttps://www.usmayors.org/issues/covid-19/equipment-survey/  (noting,  for  example, \nthat 91.5% of cities surveyed do not have an adequate supply of face masks for their \nfirst responders). This case arises in the context of an unprecedented response to an \nunprecedented situation. \nII.  COVID-19 Response at Saint Elizabeths Hospital \n \nSaint Elizabeths Hospital, overseen by the District of Columbia Department of \nBehavioral  Health  (DBH),  is  the  District’s  only  public  psychiatric  facility  for \nindividuals with serious and persistent mental illness requiring intensive inpatient \ncare to support their recovery. Declaration of Philip Candilis (Candilis Decl.), Ex. 1 \n¶ 2. The Hospital is licensed to house 292 patients in 12 different units, with an \naverage daily patient census of approximately 275. Declaration of Rich Gontang \n(Gontang Decl.) Ex. 2 ¶ 6. Each unit at the Hospital generally houses no more than \n27 patients, and has bedrooms, common living areas, bathrooms and showering \nfacilities, and dining areas. Id. \nAssigned to each unit is a designated treatment team consisting of a variety of \nprofessionals devoted to the care of each patient in that unit. Gontang Decl. ¶ 11. \nEach treatment team consists of a clinical administrator that is responsible for \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 10 of 45\n \ncoordinating  all  care,  a  psychiatrist  responsible  for  psychiatric  treatment  and \nmedication, a social worker responsible for discharge planning, and a registered \nnurse responsible for daily nursing care. Id. Each unit also has a general medical \nofficer or nurse practitioner to assist with medical issues, and a psychologist. Id. \nOther  specialists  such  as  neurologists  are  available  throughout  the  Hospital  as \nneeded. Id.  \nSaint Elizabeths generally admits three categories of patients:  (1) pre-trial \npatients; (2) post-trial patients adjudicated not guilty by reason of insanity (NGBRI) \nin criminal court proceedings; and (3) civilly committed patients admitted through \nthe civil commitment process. Candilis Decl. ¶ 6. Since Mayor Bowser declared a \nDistrict-wide public health emergency on March 11, 2020, the population at Saint \nElizabeths has been significantly reduced; the population stands at 226 patients as \nof April 20, 2020, down from 277 on February 1, 2020. Declaration of Martha Pontes \n(Pontes  Decl.),  Ex.  3,  ¶  4.  This  reduction  has  been  the  result  of  both  reduced \nadmissions and increased patient discharges to the community. See Candilis Decl. ¶ \n7; Gontang Decl. ¶ 7.   \nSaint Elizabeths is unique among healthcare facilities in that it is foremost a \npsychiatric  treatment  facility  but  also  houses  pre-trial  defendants  and  shares \nsimilarities with long-term nursing facilities. Gontang Decl. ¶ 5. COVID-19 has thus \npresented  the  Hospital  with  unique  challenges.  Hospital  officials  have  been \ncontinuously evaluating Saint Elizabeths’s policies and practices, and as the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the District of Columbia Department \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 11 of 45\n \nof Health (DOH) have issued new guidance related to the pandemic, the Hospital’s \npolicies and practices have evolved to comply. See DBH Administrative Issuance \n#2020-001, Ex. 3 (effective date January 29, 2020, and updated no fewer than five \ntimes to provide additional guidance on managing the COVID-19 epidemic). For \nexample, in just this past week, the CDC issued new guidance on the recommended \nstandards of care for patients in healthcare settings and long term care facilities, \nincluding new recommendations on face coverings and visitor screenings.1 Then, on \nApril 14, 2020, DOH issued similar guidance recommending for the first time that \nface masks be worn by everyone—patients, visitors and personnel—in facilities such \nas Saint Elizabeths. See District of Columbia Department of Health, Letter to Long \nTerm  Care  Facilities  Administrators  (April  14,  2020),  available  at \nhttps://dchealth.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/doh/publication/attachments/DC_H\nealth_COVID-19_LTCF_Coverings_and_Masks_2020.04.14.pdf  (April  14  DOH \nLetter). The following day, Mayor Bowser issued Order 2020-063 mandating that \nspecific precautions be taken at Saint Elizabeths to protect the health of patients and \nstaff.  See  Mayor’s  Order  2020-063,  April  15,  2020,  available  at \n \n1   See Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Interim Infection Prevention \nand  Control  Recommendations  for  Patients  with  Suspected  or  Confirmed \nCoronavirus  Disease  2019  (COVID-19)  in  Healthcare  Settings  (April  13,  2020), \navailable  at  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-\nrecommendations.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcorona\nvirus%2F2019-ncov%2Finfection-control%2Fcontrol-recommendations.html  (CDC \nHealthcare Settings Recommendations); Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nPreparing for COVID-19: Long-term Care Facilities, Nursing Homes, available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/long-term-care.html  (Preparing  for \nCOVID-19). \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 12 of 45\n \nhttps://coronavirus.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-extends-public-health-emergency-\nstay-home-order-and-closure-non-essential. The Hospital has worked expeditiously to \nensure its policies and procedures conform to these new best practices and meet the \nHospital’s obligation to provide patient care in the least restrictive setting possible.2 \nCurrent practices and policies at Saint Elizabeths include the following.  \nA.  New Patient Admissions \nSaint  Elizabeths  provides  critical  services  to  some  of  the  District’s  most \nvulnerable residents, and the need for these services has not stopped during the \ncurrent public health emergency. Gontang Decl. ¶ 5. The Hospital has implemented \nthorough procedures to allow for the continued admissions of limited new patients \nduring the pandemic, while also protecting the patients already in its care.  \n  Saint Elizabeths limits admissions to court-ordered pre-trial individuals and \nonly those referred through the civil commitment process for whom (1) admission to \nthe Hospital is medically necessary, and (2) no less restrictive treatment option is \navailable. See Candilis Decl. ¶ 5. Since March 11, 2020, the Hospital admissions have \nbeen lower than the Hospital’s pre-COVID-19 average. Id. ¶ 7.   \n \n2   On April 17, 2020, physicians from the CDC and DOH visited the Hospital and \ntoured several different units to see the COVID-19 response measures. The CDC was \ncomplimentary of the Hospital’s efforts and stated no negative findings. Tu Decl. ¶ \n___.  The physicians  offered the  following  verbal  recommendations  for  continued \nimprovement in operations:  (1) prioritizing usage of PPE; (2) optional usage of head \nand shoe coverings; (3) minimizing staff rotation among units whenever possible; (4) \nminimizing groups of staff eating in the breakroom; (5) continuing to provide training \non correct usage of PPE; and (6) encouraging staff to make on-the-spot corrections \nwhen staff are not using PPE appropriately. Id. ¶¶ 9-10. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 13 of 45\n \nBefore arriving at Saint Elizabeths, most patients admitted through the civil \ncommitment process will have first received treatment at other area hospitals from \nwhich they are being transferred. Candilis Decl. ¶ 8. At the time of transfer, the \npatient will generally have been monitored in acute hospital care for over two weeks, \nwhich allows Saint Elizabeths to fully assess the need for admission and that the \npatient was properly screened for COVID-19 and is not exhibiting any symptoms. Id. \n¶¶ 8-9. Further, after arriving at the Hospital but before being placed on a unit, each \npatient is screened again for COVID-19 by Hospital staff. Id. ¶ 9. \nPre-trial patients also receive careful screening. Because pre-trial patients \noften arrive directly from the community and not from another healthcare provider, \nSaint Elizabeths is now requesting that the court order the District of Columbia \nDepartment of Corrections (DOC) to test pretrial patients for COVID-19 prior to their \narrival at the Hospital. Declaration of Martha Pontes (Pontes Decl.) Ex. 4 ¶ 15. The \nresults of their test will then dictate which unit they are placed into as described \nbelow.3 \nB.  Screening and Testing for COVID-19 \nSaint Elizabeth adheres to all CDC and DOH guidance on how to screen \npatients and staff for COVID-19.4 On March 30, 2020, the Hospital implemented \n \n3   Since March 23, 2020, only one pretrial defendant has been ordered to the \nHospital for a competency evaluation. Id. ¶ 7. That patient has been tested for \nCOVID-19 by DOC and will be housed accordingly pending the results of the test. Id.  \n¶ ___. \n \n4   See CDC Healthcare Settings Recommendations; Preparing for COVID-19. \n \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 14 of 45\n \nDOH’s Administrative Issuance 2020-001 requiring that every individual entering \nthe  Hospital—staff,  contractors  and  visitors—be  screened  before  admission.5 \nDeclaration of Yi-Ling Elaine Tu (Tu Decl.) Ex. 5 ¶ 13; DOH Admin. Issuance 2020-\n001.  Current  screening  includes  a  temperature  check  using  a  no-touch  infrared \nthermometer and, beginning April 20, 2020, a questionnaire to determine whether \nthe individual is at risk of having COVID-19. See Tu Decl. Ex. 5 ¶ 14.  Any individual \nwhose  temperature  reading  exceeds  100  degrees  Fahrenheit  or  whose  answers \nsuggest they may have COVID-19 is denied entry into the Hospital. Id. \nPursuant to CDC and DOH recommendations, all Saint Elizabeths patients \nreceive a daily screen for COVID-19 symptoms, which includes a check of the patient’s \nvital signs. Pontes Decl. ¶ 14. Patients are evaluated for testing pursuant to CDC and \nDOH guidelines, which do not recommend general testing of asymptomatic patients. \nId.. Any patient exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms that meet the guidelines for testing \nis screened, provided a mask if needed, transferred to a “person under investigation” \n(PUI) unit and tested. Id. Using test sample collection kits on-site, Hospital staff \ncollect a swab from the patient and send the sample to the District of Columbia \nDepartment of Forensic Services laboratory for testing. Id. Results are returned \nwithin 24 to 48 hours. Id.  The patient remains in the PUI unit while awaiting test \nresults. \n \n5   As of April 15, 2020, visitors allowed into the Hospital are generally limited to \nattorneys and interpreters. See Mayor’s Order 2020-063, April 15, 2020, available at \nhttps://coronavirus.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/coronavirus/publication/attachm\nents/MayorsOrder2020.063.pdf. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 15 of 45\n \nC.  Isolation and Cohorting \nIn response to the pandemic, Saint Elizabeths has implemented “cohorting” \npractices—housing COVID-positive patients together in units isolated from other \npatients—as recommended by the CDC. Tu Decl. ¶ 7; see also CDC Healthcare \nSettings Recommendations. On top of the patient units previously in operation, on \nApril 15, 2020, the Hospital converted an auxiliary programming wing called the \nTherapeutic Learning Center (TLC) into an additional housing unit to facilitate the \ncohorting process. Gontang Decl. ¶ 7. Currently, the hospital has two dedicated \nisolation units housing only patients who have tested positive for COVID-19. Tu Decl. \n¶ 7. In addition, the Hospital has one PUI unit where patients awaiting test results \nare housed. Id. Nursing and medical staff assigned to the isolation units minimize \ncontact with patients and staff members throughout the rest of the Hospital. Id.  As \nof today, the remaining nine units do not house any patients that have tested COVID-\npositive,  are  awaiting  test  results,  or  are  suspected  of  COVID  based  on  their \nsymptoms. Id.  \nD.  Patient Protections \n1.  Social Distancing \nBecause COVID-19 is believed to spread mainly from person to person, the \nCDC recommends that everyone practice social distancing. See Centers for Disease \nControl  and  Prevention,  Social  Distancing,  Quarantine  and  Isolation, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 16 of 45\n \n.html. To promote social distancing and reduce contact between patients, the Hospital \nhas suspended group therapies and other communal activities which previously took \nplace in the TLC, and, as explained above, converted the TLC into an auxiliary \nhousing unit. Gontang Decl. ¶ 17. Meal practices have been modified to reduce the \nnumber of patients present in the dining hall at any given time, including staggering \nmeals and allowing patients to eat meals in their rooms. Pontes Decl. ¶ 9. \nAll staff have been trained to practice and enforce social distancing, and staff \ndo as much as they can to ensure patients practice distancing safely. Id. For example, \nwhen  receiving  medication  at  their  unit’s  medication  window,  each  patient  is \ninstructed to approach the window one at a time to ensure patient privacy and, now, \nto maintain social distancing. Id. ¶ 10. If another patient approaches, staff will \nredirect the patient and remind them to maintain safe spacing. Id. While the physical \nspace in the various units is more than sufficient for patients to practice social \ndistancing, patient response to the social distancing guidance from staff has been \nmixed, and it can be difficult to enforce without impinging on patient autonomy. Id.   \n2.  Face Masks  \nOn April 14, 2020, DOH issued new guidance recommending all patients be \nprovided with a facemask when possible. See April 14 DOH Letter. As plaintiffs note, \nall patients currently have access to facemasks. Pontes Decl. ¶ 13; Guzman Decl. [33-\n9] ¶ 3. The Hospital has a sufficient inventory of surgical masks and receives regular \nreplenishments, which are then made available to patients who request them. Pontes \nDecl. ¶ 13; Declaration of Renee Bivins (Bivins Decl.) Ex. 6 ¶ 8. In addition, the \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 17 of 45\n \nHospital’s  Department  of  Recreation  has  made  and  distributed  cloth  masks  for \npatients that can be washed and reused. Pontes Decl. ¶ 13. Staff members all wear \ndifferent levels of face protection depending on the unit in which they are providing \ncare and according to CDC guidelines and recommendations. Id. ¶ 11. At minimum, \nas of April 21, 2020, each staff member wears a face mask and a face shield. Id. \n3.  Hand Hygiene \nAll patients have access to soap and sinks in the bathrooms to wash their \nhands as needed.6 Bivins Decl. ¶ 8. Housekeeping checks the bathrooms daily to \nensure that there is an adequate supply of soap and paper towels. Id. Patients can \nalso ask for soap at nurses’ stations in their units. Id. In addition, hand sanitizer is \navailable on all units, though on certain units, patients are required to ask nursing \nstaff to dispense the sanitizer for them.7 Id. \n4.  Additional Cleaning Measures \nAll parts of Saint Elizabeths, including patient rooms and bathrooms, are \ncleaned by professional cleaning staff throughout each day between 6:00 a.m. and \n11:30 p.m. Bivins Decl. ¶¶ 5- 6. The Hospital has also hired an additional ten cleaning \ncontractors to increase the frequency of cleaning. Id. ¶ 6. In addition to regular \nhousekeeping practices, cleaning staff now focus on cleaning and sanitizing “high \ntouch areas” such as rails and doorknobs. Id.  \nE.  Provision of Psychiatric and Medical Treatment \n \n6   Plaintiffs’ own evidence confirms this. See Rose Decl. [39-10] ¶ 5. \n \n7   Plaintiffs’ evidence confirms this, too. Guzman Decl. ¶ 3 ; Rose Decl. ¶ 5. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 18 of 45\n \nPatients receive a variety of treatment while they reside at Saint Elizabeths, \nmuch of which remains unchanged during the COVID-19 health emergency. While \ngroup therapies have been suspended based on CDC social distancing guidance, \npatients at the hospital continue to receive the psychiatric treatment, medicine and \nother services they received prior to the health emergency. Gontang Decl. ¶ 11. Each \npatient has a treatment team on the unit where they reside that consists of a clinical \nadministrator that is responsible for coordinating all care, a psychiatrist responsible \nfor psychiatric treatment and medication, a social worker responsible for discharge \nplanning, and a registered nurse responsible for daily nursing care. Id. In addition, \neach unit has a general medical officer or nurse practitioner to assist with medical \nissues,  and  a  psychologist.  Id.  Patients  continue  to  receive  appropriate  and \nindividualized psychiatric treatment, including medications, psychological support, \nnursing and social work services, as well as other specialty services they require. Id. \nThere has also been a documented reduction in the incidents of aggressive behavior \nby patients in the last month. See Gontang Decl. ¶ 14 (below average instances of \n“unusual  incidents  of  physical  assault”  and  “unusual  incidents  of  aggressive \nbehavior” in last 30 days). \nAlthough most group therapies and activities have been suspended during the \npandemic, Hospital staff are working to expand their telemedicine capabilities to \nfacilitate continuity of care for patients with outside providers and are monitoring \npatients to ensure these changes do not negatively affect each patient’s psychological \nstability. Id. ¶ 12. Currently, the Hospital has provided each unit with a computer \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 19 of 45\n \nand access to WebEx teleconferencing software that patients can use for teletherapy \nand telemedicine with outside practitioners. Id. On April 17, 2020, the Hospital \nreceived 14 new WebEx enabled devices to expand its telemedicine capabilities. Id. ¶ \n13. \nF.  Individualized Patient Assessments  \nSaint Elizabeths regularly conducts individualized assessments of all patients, \n“identifying potential for treatment in the least restrictive environment.” Gontang \nDecl. ¶ 7. This is the core function of the Hospital’s Department of Social Work at all \ntimes,  including  during  the  current  COVID-19  pandemic. Id.  The  Hospital  has \ncompleted  individual  assessments  of  each  patient  during  the  COVID-19  health \nemergency, assessing both their fitness for discharge and whether Saint Elizabeths \nremains the least restrictive setting for their continued care. See id. ¶¶ 7-10.  \nIn  response  to  a  recent  motion  filed  in  Superior  Court,  Saint  Elizabeths \ncompleted individual evaluations of all pre-trial patients charged with misdemeanors \nand made recommendations to the court. Id. ¶ 7; see also D.C. Code § 24-531.06. As \nof April 17, 2020, the court has ordered the discharge of 14 patients as a result. See \nId.  Saint  Elizabeths  has  also  completed  individual  assessments  for  post-trial \npatients. Id. ¶ 8. The Hospital, however, is required by statute to consider public \nsafety  and  the  risk of  dangerousness  and  recidivism  when  evaluating  post-trial \npatients for community release, and the Hospital cannot release any post-trial patient \nwithout Superior Court approval. Id.; see D.C. Code § 24-501(e). Finally, the Hospital \nhas completed individualized assessments for all civilly committed patients. See \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 20 of 45\n \nGontang Decl. ¶ 9. While some individuals were found eligible to receive treatment \nin the community, barriers such as the unavailability of safe and stable housing stand \nin the way of discharge for many. Id. ¶ 10. For example, most patients are not able to \nlive independently immediately upon discharge, and admissions to group homes or \nnursing  homes  are  severely  curtailed  because  of  COVID-19. Id.  DBH  generally \nrecommends  against  discharge  into  homeless  shelters,  which  may  not  have  the \nnecessary  support  services  for  successful  community  transition.  Id.  Successful \ncommunity discharge instead typically involves close coordination with a community-\nbased mental health services provider called a Core Services Agency (CSA). Id. But \nbecause CSAs cannot always provide services to a patient without stable housing, the \nlack of stable housing presents a barrier discharge. Id.  \nDischarge into the community is even more difficult during the pandemic \nbecause the threat of COVID-19 exists everywhere. Gontang Decl. ¶ 10. For example, \ngroup homes pose the risk of exposure among asymptomatic roommates, guardians \nand others that are free to travel in and out of the home. Id.  A vulnerable patient \nthat does not have the mental capacity to adhere to social distancing, cough etiquette, \nhand washing and other COVID-19 precautions in the community may be safer in an \nenvironment with ready access to mental health, medical and nursing care. Id. Saint \nElizabeths  nonetheless  continues  to  evaluate  patients  for  the  possibility  of \ncommunity transition.  \nG.  Staffing \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 21 of 45\n \nThroughout the pandemic, the Hospital has maintained adequate staffing to \nensure patients receive adequate care and treatment. Pontes Decl. ¶ 4. The nursing \ndepartment maintains a staffing matrix to ensure the proper number of nurses, \nnurses assistants and behavioral health technicians are present in each unit based \non the patient census on any given day. Id. ¶ 6. The Hospital has 760 staff, 83 of \nwhich are currently out because they are COVID-positive or symptomatic. Id. ¶ 4. To \nassist while staff members are unavailable, the Hospital has brought in 31 additional \nnursing  staff,  and  increased  the  number  of  contract  medical  personnel  at  the \nHospital. Id. ¶ 7. All contract medical personnel participate in a three-day orientation \nand onboarding process to ensure they are familiar with the platforms and procedures \nof the Hospital. Id.   \nH.  Personal Protective Equipment \nThe Hospital has adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) to comply \nwith CDC guidelines and recommendations, Pontes Decl. ¶ 11, and receives deliveries \nof PPE several times per week. Id. ¶ 12. In accordance with CDC and DOH guidance, \nstaff are required to wear facemasks at all times when they are present on patient \nunits. Id. ¶ 11. As of April 20, 2020, staff also don face shields whenever they interact \nwith patients on general units.  For PUI units, staff utilize gown, N95 mask, goggles, \ngloves  and  shoe  covers Id..  On  isolation  units, a  respirator  or  “PAPR  mask”  is \nrequired.  Id.  The  Hospital  has  conducted  WebEx  trainings  with  all  staff  on \nappropriate PPE levels and how to don and doff each type of PPE safely according to \nCDC guidelines, and has issued written guidance.

Plaintiffs’ Allegations and Procedural History \n \nPlaintiffs’  operative  complaint  only  contains  allegations  pertaining  to  a \ntemporary water outage that occurred at Saint Elizabeths in the fall of 2019. See \nCompl. [1] ¶¶ 1-4. Plaintiffs filed this putative class action on October 23, 2019, \nasserting two counts:  a substantive due process claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and a \ndisability discrimination claim under the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131, et seq. Id. ¶¶ 97-\n110.  Plaintiffs  sought  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief. See id.  ¶¶  111-17.  The \nHospital began restoring normal water usage the same day the Complaint was filed, \nand on December 16, 2019, the District moved to dismiss the case as moot. See Mot. \nto  Dismiss  [21].  In  response  to  the  motion  to  dismiss,  plaintiffs  moved  for \njurisdictional  discovery  on  December  20,  2019, see Pls.’  Mot.  for  Jurisdictional \nDiscovery [23], and the District opposed on January 3, 2020, see District’s Opp’n to \nMot. for Jurisdictional Discovery [27]. After oral argument on January 22, 2020, the \nCourt granted plaintiffs’ requests in part and plaintiffs served discovery requests on \nJanuary 29, 2020. The District provided responses on February 28, 2020. Plaintiffs’ \nresponse to the District’s motion to dismiss is due 14 days after the District produces \nthe requested documents. \nThen, on April 16, 2020, plaintiffs moved for an emergency hearing and leave \nto file an amended complaint, alleging that the District has not been taking proper \nmeasures at Saint Elizabeths to mitigate the risks of COVID-19 to patients. See Pl.’s \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 23 of 45\n \nMot. For Emergency Hearing [36]; Proposed Am. Compl. [36-1] ¶¶ 37-122.8 The \nProposed Amended Complaint includes new factual allegations related to the current \nCOVID-19 global pandemic and the District’s response. See Proposed Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 37-122.  On  April  16,  the  Court  granted  plaintiffs’  request  for  an  emergency \nhearing and the Parties appeared telephonically on April 17, 2020. The Court set an \nexpedited  briefing  schedule  for  plaintiffs’  motion  for  leave  to  file  an  amended \ncomplaint, and plaintiffs’ request for emergency relief. Pursuant to that schedule, \nplaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order on April 18, 2020, and the \nDistrict opposed by 4:00 p.m. on April 21, 2020. Any reply is due by 12:00 p.m. on \nApril 22, 2020. A hearing is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. on April 23, 2020. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n \nA temporary restraining order “is ‘an extraordinary remedy that may only be \nawarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.’” Sherley v. \nSebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 393 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, \nInc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)). “The same standards apply for both temporary restraining \norders and preliminary injunctions.” Experience Works, Inc. v. Chao, 267 F. Supp. 2d \n93, 96 (D.D.C. 2003). \nA plaintiff seeking a TRO must establish that:  (1) “he is likely to succeed on \nthe merits”; (2) “he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary \nrelief”; (3) “the balance of equities tips in his favor”; and (4) “an injunction is in the \n \n8   The District has opposed plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend their Complaint. \nSee District’s Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for Leave to Amend [40]. In addressing plaintiffs’ \nnew allegations and proposed claims below, the District does not waive the arguments \nmade in that opposition. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 24 of 45\n \npublic  interest.”  Sherley,  644  F.3d  at  392.  Because  injunctive  relief  is  an \nextraordinary remedy, a plaintiff seeking such relief must prove all four prongs of the \nstandard before relief can be granted. In re Navy Chaplaincy, 738 F.3d 425, 428 (D.C. \nCir. 2013); Winter, 555 U.S. at 22. The plaintiff bears the burden of doing so. Davis \nv. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 571 F.3d 1288, 1292 (D.C. Cir. 2009). \n“The usual role of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending \nthe outcome of litigation.” Cobell v. Norton, 455 F.3d 301, 314 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (quoting \nDist. 50, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Int’l Union, United Mine Workers of Am., 412 \nF.2d 165, 168 (D.C. Cir. 1969)); see also Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. \nEngland, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (CFGC) (same).  \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  Plaintiffs Fail To Show They Will Suffer Irreparable Harm. \n \nA TRO is fundamentally about establishing the need for immediate relief. For \nthat reason, the “failure to demonstrate irreparable harm is grounds for refusing to \nissue a [TRO], even if the other three factors … merit such relief.” Nat’l Mining Ass’n \nv. Jackson, 768 F. Supp. 2d 34, 50 (D.D.C. 2011) (citation and internal quotation \nmarks omitted); see also CFGC, 454 F.3d at 297 (observing that there is “a high \nstandard for  irreparable  injury”).  “[P]roving  irreparable  injury  is  a  considerable \nburden, requiring proof that the movant’s injury is certain, great and actual—not \ntheoretical—and  imminent,  creating  a  clear  and  present  need  for  extraordinary \nequitable relief to prevent harm.” Power Mobility Coal. v. Leavitt, 404 F. Supp. 2d \n190, 204 (D.D.C. 2005) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). If a party \nfails to make a sufficient showing of irreparable injury, a court may deny a motion \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 25 of 45\n \nfor preliminary relief without considering the other factors. CityFed Fin. Corp. v. \nOffice of Thrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738, 747 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  \nThe specific relief plaintiffs have requested makes clear that they will not \nsuffer irreparable harm absent a TRO. The primary reason is straightforward:  Saint \nElizabeths is already taking the overwhelming majority of the measures plaintiffs \nrequest. Treatment teams already monitor patients individually for potential new \nissues and needed changes to their treatment plans, see Pls.’ Proposed Order ¶¶ 2, 9; \nGontang  Decl.  ¶  11,  and  have  been  evaluating  patients  for  the  possibility  of \ncommunity placement, recommending individuals for release where appropriate, see \nPls.’ Proposed Order ¶¶ ; Gontang Decl. ¶¶ 7-9. Medical staff already monitor patients \nfor symptoms of COVID-19 and conduct tests according to CDC and DOH guidelines, \nisolate and quarantine individuals appropriately, and provide necessary PPE for \nsymptomatic individuals. See Pls.’ Proposed Order ¶ 5; Tu Decl. ¶ 7, 11; Pontes Decl. \n¶ 5. All patients already have consistent access to soap, hand sanitizer, and running \nwater,  and  regular  cleaning  and  disinfecting  services  are  provided  daily—and \nsometimes hourly—throughout the facility. See Pls.’ Proposed Order ¶ 6; Bivins Decl. \n¶¶ 8. Patients are already appropriately housed in isolation units, PUI units, and \ngeneral housing units based on the likelihood of whether they have contracted the \nvirus. See Pls.’ Proposed Order ¶ 7; Pontes Decl. ¶ 14. And staff already educate \npatients  on  COVID-19  symptoms  and  prevention  measures  through  individual \nhandouts, one-on-one conversations, coordination with the Patient Advocates Group \nand the Patient Advisory Counsel, and previously through community meetings. See \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 26 of 45\n \nPls.’ Proposed Order ¶ 8; Tu Decl. ¶ 5.  \nTwo requests for relief remain:  an order directing Saint Elizabeths to cease \nnew patient admissions and another directing Saint Elizabeths to provide the Court \nwith daily reports reflecting its ongoing compliance with specified measures and \nupdated information about the patient population. See Pls.’ Proposed Order ¶¶ 1, 10. \nAs to the first of these, even assuming the District could prevent the Superior Court \nfrom referring new patients (which it cannot), new patient arrivals are already well \nbelow normal, and the new-patient screening procedures currently in place ensure \nthe separation of positive and suspected COVID-19 cases from the general patient \npopulation. See Pls.’ Proposed Order ¶ 1; Pontes Decl. ¶ 15; Candilis Decl. ¶¶ 7-9. \nPlaintiffs have sufficient space to engage in social distancing at all times and will not \nbe housed in a situation that exposes them to an unreasonable risk of contracting the \nvirus. Pontes Decl. ¶¶ 9-10. As to the second, and based on the evidence presented, \nplaintiffs will suffer no harm if the Court does not order Saint Elizabeths to issue \nreports on what it is already doing.  \nNo harm will come to plaintiffs, let alone irreparable harm that is certain and \nimminent, if the Court denies their request for a TRO and Saint Elizabeths continues \nto carry out the measures it has put in place. This alone suffices to deny plaintiffs’ \nrequest for a TRO. See Nat’l Mining Ass’n, 768 F. Supp. 2d at 50.9 \n \n9   On April 20, 2020, Mayor Bowser also announced she had appointed a team of \n“health and operational experts from” the District government to “review, scrutinize, \nand, when appropriate, recommend changes to the policies and practices in place at \n…  Saint  Elizabeths.” See Government  of  the  District  of  Columbia,  Coronavirus \n(COVID-19)  Situational  Update  Monday,  April  20,  2020,  at  6,  available  at \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 27 of 45\n \nII.  Plaintiffs Cannot Show a Likelihood of Success on the Merits. \n \nDemonstrating  a  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  is  a  free-standing \nrequirement, Sherley, 644 F.3d at 393, and the failure to meet the burden on this \nprong “is alone sufficient to defeat” a motion for emergency injunctive relief, Smith v. \nHenderson, 944 F. Supp. 2d 89, 96 (D.D.C. 2013). The Court need not conclude that \nplaintiffs will definitely lose on the merits, only that they have not met the demanding \nburden of showing a clear entitlement to immediate, extraordinary relief. Sweis v. \nU.S. Foreign Claims Settlement Comm’n, 950 F. Supp. 2d 44, 48 (D.D.C. 2013). To \novercome this burden, it must be shown not merely that success is a “possibility” but \nthat it is “likely.” Winter, 555 U.S. at 20-22. Plaintiffs raise two claims for relief in \ntheir Complaint but ultimately fail to show a likelihood of success on the merits for \neither one. \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Due Process Claim Is Not Likely To Succeed.  \nThe record and plaintiffs’ own framing of the law show they are unlikely to \nsucceed  on  their  due  process  claim. See Proposed  Am.  Compl.  ¶¶  218-24.  The \nConstitution  prohibits  the  government  from  depriving  people  of  life,  liberty  or \nproperty without due process of law. U.S. Const., amend. V.10 This includes the \nguarantee of “substantive” due process, or the protection from “unjustified intrusions \non personal security.” Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 673 (1977). Although such \n \nhttps://coronavirus.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/coronavirus/release_content/att\nachments/Situational%20Update%20Presentation_new-04202020.pdf.  Plaintiffs’ \nrequest for ongoing reporting is especially unnecessary in light of this announcement. \n \n10   The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to the District. See \nBolling v. Sharpe, 34 U.S. 497, 498 (1954).  \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 28 of 45\n \nconduct “usually takes the form of affirmative state action,” the failure to act by \ngovernment officials can also implicate the due process clause in some circumstances. \nEstate of Phillips v. District of Columbia, 455 F.3d 397, 403 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  \nA well-established line of authority analyzes due process in circumstances such \nas these. In Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982), the Supreme Court recognized \nthat the Due Process Clause imposes on the government a “duty to provide certain \nservices and care” to “a person [who] is institutionalized—and wholly dependent on \nthe  State.” Id. at  317.  These  include  duties  “to  provide  adequate  food,  shelter, \nclothing, and medical care,” and “reasonable safety for all residents and personnel \nwithin the institution.” Id. at 324. Plaintiffs’ charge here falls under the rubric of \nYoungberg, to the extent they allege inadequate care.11 But their challenge cannot \nsucceed for two reasons. \nFirst, although plaintiffs identify isolated components of care that have been \nmodified  or  interrupted  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  plaintiffs  do  not  (and \ncannot) show that they are being denied “adequate” care or “reasonable safety.” See \nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 324. The record supports that Saint Elizabeths is providing \nresidents with adequate accommodations, medical and psychiatric care, and the \n \n11   Plaintiffs incorrectly attempt to frame this case under the legal standards \napplicable to cases involving affirmative actions by state officials. See Pls.’ Mem. at \n18-19 (citing Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2475 (2015)). The key case \nthey cite, Kingsley, addresses “the appropriate standard for a pretrial detainee’s \nexcessive force claim” under the Due Process Clause. See id. at 2473. Plaintiffs here, \nhowever,  do  not  allege  excessive  force,  nor  do  they  raise  claims  based  on  any \naffirmative acts taken by government officials. They instead allege inadequate care \nduring their involuntary commitment to a District-run psychiatric facility—in other \nwords, a claim based on the failure to act. \n \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 29 of 45\n \nitems they need to protect themselves from COVID-19 according to current public \nhealth guidelines. The Hospital has taken broad precautions related to the virus, such \nas making face masks readily available to all patients and separating residents into \ndedicated units based on the likelihood of whether they have contracted the virus. \nSee Pontes Decl. ¶¶ 13-14; Tu Decl. ¶¶ 7-8. Treatment teams continue to provide \npatients with individualized care, including psychiatric and medical care. Gontang \nDecl. ¶ 11. Although some therapy services have been paused based on CDC guidance \nto minimize in-person gatherings, id., hospital staff have set up computers and \ntablets for patients to take part in virtual individualized therapy sessions with \noutside providers, id. ¶¶ 12-13.12 Plaintiffs cannot show that they are being subjected \nto inadequate care, an unreasonable risk to their health and safety, or a deficiency of \nany other rights to which they are entitled under the Constitution. \nSecond, even if there were a deficiency in their care, plaintiffs are incorrect \nthat this alone would establish a violation of their due process rights. The Fifth \nAmendment does not establish a negligence regime by which any pre-trial detainee \ncan show a due process violation when any actions taken against that individual “are \nobjectively unreasonable.” See Pls.’ Mem. at 18-19. In numerous cases (including \nKingsley,  the  key  authority  on  which  plaintiffs  rely),  the  Supreme  Court  has \nemphasized just the opposite:  that constitutional due process violations require more \nthan  mere  negligence  by  government  actors. See Kingsley,  135  S.  Ct.  at  2472 \n \n12   Plaintiff Smith, for example, states that she has had “remote therapy via \ntelemedicine” once a week for the last two weeks. See Smith Decl. [39-8] ¶ 10. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 30 of 45\n \n(“[L]iability for negligently inflected harm is categorically beneath the threshold of \nconstitutional due process” (Court’s emphasis)); Davidson v. Cannon, 474 U.S. 344, \n347  (1986)  (“[T]he  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  is  not \nimplicated by the lack of due care of an official causing unintended injury to life, \nliberty or property.”); DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. \n189, 202 (1989) (Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause “does not transform \nevery tort committed by a state actor into a constitutional violation”).13  \nWhen, as here, a plaintiff alleges a deprivation arising from the failure to act, \nauthority is split on how to establish a due process violation. Under one line of \nauthority, applicable to plaintiffs in the government’s custody generally, a plaintiff \nmust first establish that officials exhibited “deliberate indifference.” See Farmer v. \nBrennan,  511  U.S.  825  (1994).  Under  the  other,  applicable  specifically  to \ninvoluntarily committed medical or psychiatric patients, a plaintiff must show that \nthe professionals entrusted with care made a decision that was “such a substantial \n \n13   Were excessive force at issue here, the Court in Kingsley held that an official \nmay be held liable under the Due Process Clause only where “the use of force [was] \ndeliberate—i.e., purposeful or knowing.” 135 S. Ct. at 2472. The official’s affirmative, \nphysical action must have been carried out deliberately, but the official need not have \nintended the force itself be excessive as long as the level of force was “objectively \nunreasonable.” Id.  at  2473.  At  most, Kingsley  stands  for  the  proposition  that \nexcessive force can rise to a due process violation even absent any intent to inflict \npunishment. That, however, is not at issue here because plaintiffs allege neither an \naffirmative action nor that anyone intended to (or did) punish them.  \nPlaintiffs also cite a Second Circuit case, Darnell v. Pineiro, 849 F.3d 17 (2d \nCir. 2017). Leaving aside whether a plaintiff can establish a likelihood of success on \nthe merits by pointing to an out-of-circuit legal standard, Darnell nevertheless still \nrequires  a  showing  that  the  official  in  question  either  “acted  intentionally”  or \n“recklessly failed to act with reasonable care.” Id. Either one would require a plaintiff \nto show more than negligence. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 31 of 45\n \ndeparture  from  accepted  professional  judgment,  practice,  or  standards  as  to \ndemonstrate that the person responsible actually did not base the decision on such \njudgment.” Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 323. See Jordan v. District of Columbia, 161 F. \nSupp. 3d 45, 57 (D.D.C. 2016) (collecting cases showing split across circuits on which \nstandard to apply). Although the D.C. Circuit has not resolved which one applies in \neach scenario, see Harvey v. District of Columbia, 798 F.3d 1042, 1051-52 (D.C. Cir. \n2015), courts have generally applied the professional judgment standard to cases of \ncivilly committed psychiatric patients. See, e.g., Jordan, 161 F. Supp. 3d at 58. \nPlaintiffs, however, cannot establish a due process violation under either standard. \n1.  The District Has Not Exhibited Deliberate Indifference.  \nOf the two possible standards, deliberate indifference presents a higher bar for \nplaintiffs to clear. See Jordan, 161 F. Supp. 3d at 57. Deliberate indifference occurs \nwhere an official has “subjective knowledge of the plaintiff’s serious medical need and \nrecklessly disregards the excessive risk to the plaintiff’s health or safety from that \nrisk.” Harvey, 798 F.3d at 1052 (alterations adopted) (internal quotation marks \nomitted) (quoting Baker v. District of Columbia, 326 F.3d 1302, 1306 (D.C. Cir. 2003)). \nDeliberate indifference cannot be established by pointing to facts only known with \nthe  benefit  of  hindsight;  the  key  inquiry  is  whether  the  officials  in  question \ndisregarded excessive risk to the plaintiffs “at the time the decisions were made.” \nKaucher v. Cnty. of Bucks, 455 F.3d 418, 428 (3d Cir. 2006); see also id. (finding no \ndeliberate indifference toward risk of MRSA outbreak in jail where facts showed that \n“[w]hen defendants recognized an increased number of MRSA infections, they took \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 32 of 45\n \nvarious  remedial  and  preventative  measures,  including  isolating  and  treating \ninfected inmates and distributing information to staff and inmates”). \nThe record demonstrates that the District has not recklessly disregarded any \nrisk to the plaintiffs amid the pandemic. Saint Elizabeths began taking thorough \nprecautions against COVID-19 as early as January 29, 2020, when the Hospital \ndisseminated  its  first  administrative  issuance  notifying  staff  of  COVID-19. See \nJanuary 29, 2020 Admin. Issuance4. The Hospital has since implemented “cohorting,” \nestablishing separate wards for those who have tested positive, those exhibiting \nsymptoms without yet testing positive, and all others. Tu Decl. ¶ 7; Pontes Decl. ¶ 14. \nOutside visitors have been significantly curtailed, and all remaining visitors, as well \nas all staff and contractors, get screened by having their temperature taken and \nfilling out a questionnaire, both of which must meet specified standards before entry \ninto the facility. Tu Decl. ¶ 14. Saint Elizabeths has hired extra cleaning contractors \nand has lined up extra nursing staff to ensure adequate staffing levels. Bivins Decl. \n¶ 6; Pontes Decl. ¶7. Residents have access to a steady supply of soap that is checked \ndaily so they can take proper handwashing precautions. Bivins Decl. ¶ 8; Rose Decl. \n[39-10] ¶ 5. As plaintiffs themselves describe, residents have access to hand sanitizer \nupon request. See Guzman Decl. ¶ 3; Rose Decl. ¶ 5. Residents and staff have \nconsistent  access  to  appropriate  PPE—which  plaintiffs  themselves  confirm. See \nGuzman Decl. ¶ 3a (patients in quarantine unit “were given new masks every day,” \nand “[a]ll staff wore masks and full protective suits”); Id. ¶ 3c (in non-quarantine unit \n“[i]f a patient asks for a mask, and if a mask is available, the staff will provide the \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 33 of 45\n \npatient with a mask,” “[a]ll staff members wear masks every day,” and “[s]ome staff \nmembers wear gowns”). Residents and staff receive education on precautions such as \nhandwashing and social distancing. Tu Decl. ¶¶ 4-5. And staff ensure residents have \nample space available to practice social distancing, even though some residents may \nchoose not to heed this guidance. Pontes Decl. ¶ 10.  \nAlthough  Saint  Elizabeths  has  suspended  group  therapy  and  other \nprogramming normally conducted in communal spaces, it has done so based on CDC \nrecommendations that healthcare facilities minimize opportunities for communal \ngathering—not out of any kind of disregard for patients’ needs. See Gontang Decl.¶ \n18.  The  hospital  has  taken  measures  to  ensure  patients  can  continue  meeting \nvirtually with therapy providers. Gontang Decl ¶¶  12-13. Saint Elizabeths continues \nto admit new patients—as required by court orders—with proper screening measures \nin place. Pontes Decl. ¶ 15; Candilis Decl. ¶¶ 8-9. With a current patient population \nof 226, and a rate of new admissions far lower than usual, hospital officials have \nconcluded it is still safe to accept new patients who require psychiatric care and might \notherwise have nowhere to receive the care they need. Gontang Decl. ¶ 5.  \nSaint Elizabeths has undertaken all of these measures precisely because of the \nserious risks posed by COVID-19. The District does not dispute that the pandemic is \na serious matter. Plaintiffs’ argument instead depends on factual assertions that are \nsimply not correct. Saint Elizabeths is not “housing symptomatic and COVID-19 \npositive  individuals  together  with  asymptomatic  individuals,”  has  not  “failed  to \nisolate and quarantine individuals with the virus or suspected of having the virus,” \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 34 of 45\n \nand is not “failing to provide basic sanitation appropriate to the situation—in this \ncase, ample soap and hand sanitizer, increased cleaning and disinfection of areas.” \nPls.’ Mem. at 20. It is no surprise that plaintiffs provide no citations for these \nassertions. They are inaccurate and, as described above, contradicted by many of \nplaintiffs’ own proffered facts. Their lone citation for the general assertion that the \nDistrict has disregarded the risks posed by COVID-19 is to the declaration of someone \nwho claims no personal knowledge of conditions in the Hospital and who has formed \nher opinion based only on the allegations in plaintiffs’ Proposed Amended Complaint \nand declarations that are themselves not based on personal knowledge. See Pls.’ \nMem.  at  24  (citing  Jones  Decl.  ¶  16).  Plaintiffs  simply  cannot  show  deliberate \nindifference in light of the numerous measures the District has taken. See Kaucher, \n455 F.3d at 428. \nSeveral cases plaintiffs point to as examples of deliberate indifference present \ncircumstances not present here. In Feliciano v. Gonzales, 13 F. Supp. 2d 151 (D.P.R. \n1998),  for  instance,  the  court  indeed  found  deliberate  indifference  toward  the \nunmitigated spread of various diseases in Puerto Rico prisons—but did so based on a \nfinding that “[t]he prison system in Puerto Rico … lacks isolation facilities,” id. at \n174, and based on an absence of equipment necessary to conduct screening for certain \nillnesses, such  as X-ray  machines  needed  to screen  for tuberculosis, id.  at  179. \nSimilarly, in Joy v. Healthcare C.M.S., 534 F. Supp. 2d 482 (D. Del. 2008), the court \nobserved that the prison medical contractor “[did] not have a policy in place to \nexamine inmates [for disease] before placing them into general population.” Id. at \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 35 of 45\n \n485. As described above, however, Saint Elizabeths screens new patients and ensures \nthat COVID-19 testing occurs consistent with CDC guidelines. See Pontes Decl. ¶ 14-\n15.  Other  cases  plaintiffs  point  to  simply  state—correctly—that  deliberate \nindifference is the requisite standard for assessing an alleged due process violation \nand can be established by certain factual showings. See Shimon v. Dep’t of Corr. \nServs. for the State of New York, Civil Action No. 93-3144, 1996 WL 15688, at *3 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1996) (due process liability possible “[i]f plaintiff can prove that [official] \nhad notice of a tuberculosis ‘epidemic’ and failed, with deliberate indifference, to take \nappropriate actions to prevent or address the problem”); Joy, 534 F. Supp. 2d at 485 \n(liability possible upon showing that prison officials were “acting with deliberate \nindifference” when exposing prisoners to substantial risk of harm). Although true, \nthat is not applicable given the facts here. \nPlaintiffs cannot show deliberate indifference by the District and fall well short \nof showing a likelihood of success on the merits. \n2.  No Action by the District Has Departed from Accepted Professional \nJudgment, Practice or Standards. \n \nPlaintiffs cannot make out a due process claim even under the lower of the two \nstandards, the professional judgment standard. Under this rubric, in cases involving \nthose involuntarily committed to the state’s care, due process “only requires that the \ncourts make certain that professional judgment in fact was exercised” by appropriate \nstaff,  without  mandating  that  any  specific  judgment  should  have  been  made. \nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 321. “[E]vidence establishing mere departures from the \napplicable standard of care is insufficient to show a constitutional violation.” Patten \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 36 of 45\n \nv. Nichols,  274  F.3d  829,  845  (4th  Cir.  2001).  Rather,  “decisions  made  by  the \nappropriate  professional  are  entitled  a  presumption  of  correctness  unless  it  is \nestablished  that  the  person  responsible  did  not  base  the  decision  on  accepted \nprofessional judgment.” Terrance v. Northville Regional Psychiatric Hosp., 286 F.3d \n834, 849 (6th Cir. 2002) (citing Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 323); see also Cameron v. \nTomes, 990 F.2d 14, 20 (1st Cir. 1993) (“Nothing in the Constitution mechanically \ngives controlling weight to one set of professional judgments.”). This deference to \nfacility administrators is derived from the requirement that courts must “balance[] \nthe plaintiff’s liberty interests against any relevant state interests, including fiscal \nconstraints and administrative burdens.” LaShawn A. v. Dixon, 762 F. Supp. 959, 994 \n(D.D.C. 1991) (citing Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 321); see also P.C. v. McLaughlin, 913 \nF.2d 1033, 1043 (2d Cir. 1990) (no substantive due process violation in institutional \nplacement of mentally disabled individual with violent history where state’s “decision \nwas prompted by the total lack of any viable alternative, and compelled by the \nnecessity to provide him with food, shelter, clothing and medical care”). \nPlaintiffs focus on the risk COVID-19 poses in general, see Pls.’ Mem. at 22-\n23, but do not specify any particular decisions they believe fall below Youngberg’s \nthreshold. To establish a substantive due process violation, plaintiffs must show that \na  “decision  by  [a]  professional  is  such  a  substantial  departure  from  accepted \nprofessional judgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate that the person \nresponsible actually did not base the decision on such a judgment.” Youngberg, 457 \nU.S. at 323 (emphasis added). They have not done so, and the record shows that the \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 37 of 45\n \nvarious procedures and protocols Saint Elizabeths officials have implemented in light \nof the pandemic have in fact been based on sound professional judgments, balancing \nthe need to provide appropriate care with the need to protect patients from the risks \nof COVID-19. See LaShawn, 762 F. Supp. at 994; McLaughlin, 913 F.2d at 1043.  \nPlaintiffs cannot point to any decisions that were not based on a professional \njudgment. As described above, Saint Elizabeths has made the decisions it has made—\nsome  of  them  difficult—based  on  the  need  to  balance  competing  considerations \nrelevant to providing appropriate patient care. Even under this lower standard, \nplaintiffs cannot succeed on the merits of their substantive due process claim. \nB.  Plaintiffs Are Not Likely To Succeed on Their ADA Claim. \nPlaintiffs also cannot show a likelihood of success on their ADA claim. See \nProposed Am. Compl. ¶¶ 225-31 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12131). Title II of the ADA \nprovides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such \ndisability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, \nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132.  \nA plaintiff must generally make a showing of three elements to succeed in \nclaiming that a public entity violated the ADA:  “(1) that the plaintiff is a qualified \nindividual with a disability; (2) that the public entity denied him the benefits of or \nprohibited him from participating in the entity’s services, programs or activities; and \n(3) that denial or prohibition was ‘by reason of’ his disability.” Jackson v. District of \nColumbia, 826 F. Supp. 2d 109, 125-26 (D.D.C. 2011) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12132). An \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 38 of 45\n \nADA claim generally takes one of three forms:  disparate treatment, disparate impact, \nor failure to make a reasonable accommodation. Seth v. District of Columbia, Civil \nAction No. 18-1034 (BAH), 2018 WL 4682023, at *10 (D.D.C. Sept. 28, 2018). A fourth \ncategory,  known  as  “unjustified  isolation,”  emerged  after  the  Supreme  Court’s \ndecision in Olmstead v. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999). Under this theory, the ADA \ncalls for institutionalized individuals to be placed in community settings “when (1) \nthe State’s treatment professionals have determined that community placement is \nappropriate, (2) the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting is not \nopposed  by  the  affected  individual,  and  (3)  the  placement  can  be  reasonably \naccommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs \nof others with mental disabilities.” Brown v. District of Columbia, 928 F.3d 1070, \n1077 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (quoting Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 587). Plaintiffs, however, cannot \nshow a likelihood of success on the merits of their ADA claim. \n1.  Plaintiffs  Have  Not  Raised  a  Cognizable  Theory  of  ADA \nDiscrimination. \n \nPlaintiffs contend that during the COVID-19 outbreak, the District failed “to \nreasonably modify its system to reduce the segregation of Plaintiffs with disabilities \nfrom their communities of non-disabled peers during emergencies that threaten the \nphysical  and  mental  health  and  safety  of  Plaintiffs  and  undermine  the  clinical \njustification for such confinement.” Proposed Am. Compl. ¶ 228; Pls.’ Mem. at 25. This \nappears to allege an ADA claim under the theory of unjustified isolation. See Brown, \n928 F.3d at 1077. But the facts on the ground do not support that theory. During the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, Saint Elizabeths has been continually assessing patients and \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 39 of 45\n \nconsidered, among other things, which patients might be appropriately placed into \ncommunity settings. Gontang Decl. ¶¶ 13-16. In fact, a number of patients have been \ndischarged into the community since the pandemic began. Id. ¶ 13. \nPlaintiffs highlight only one consideration, some confirmed cases of COVID-19 \namong  the  Saint  Elizabeths  patient  population,  in  concluding  that  “continued \nsegregation and institutionalization of plaintiffs is not reasonable.” Pls.’ Mem. at 25. \nBut that is not the legal standard. Community placement is appropriate only where \n“the State’s treatment professionals have determined that community placement is \nappropriate,” “the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting is not \nopposed  by  the  affected  individual,”  and  “the  placement  can  be  reasonably \naccommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs \nof others with mental disabilities.” Brown, 928 F.3d at 1077. Plaintiffs’ assertion that \nCOVID-19  renders  their  continued  hospitalization  unreasonable  ignores  this \nstandard, within which are embedded numerous appropriate considerations about \nwhether community placement will in fact be in any given patient’s best interest. As \nthe record demonstrates, Saint Elizabeths has evaluated and continues to evaluate \npatients for appropriate transfers to community-based placements, Gontang Decl. ¶¶ \n7-9, despite ongoing limitations such as a shortage of available spots in nursing \nhomes for elderly patients and the low availability of in-person community care, id. ¶ \n16. Plaintiffs have no basis for asserting an unjustified isolation theory of ADA \ndiscrimination and cannot succeed on the merits of their claim. \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 40 of 45\n \nPlaintiffs’  motion  does  not  raise  the  second  ADA  theory  stated  in  their \nProposed Amended Complaint, which alleges that the District has “discriminated \nagainst class members by repeatedly utilizing methods of administration that deprive \nPlaintiffs of equal access to the benefits of the mental health services provided by \nDefendants that other individuals in the community are receiving.” Proposed Am. \nCompl. ¶ 229. That theory, however, would fare no better.  \nAlthough couched as attacks on the Hospital’s “methods of administration,” \nthese  measures  amount  to  challenges  to  the  adequacy  of  services  provided—\ngrievances that are not cognizable under the ADA. The ADA does not “impose[] on \nthe States a standard of care for whatever medical services they render,” nor does it \n“require[] States to provide a certain level of benefits to individuals with disabilities.” \nOlmstead, 527 U.S. at 603 n.14. All the ADA requires is that states “adhere to the \nADA’s  nondiscrimination  requirement  with  regard  to  the  services  they  in  fact \nprovide.” Id.  \nIn any case, plaintiffs’ own proffered evidence alleges that even during the \npandemic, plaintiffs have continued receiving many services, such as individual \ntherapy, albeit in modified form. See Smith Decl. [39-8] ¶ 10 (Plaintiff Smith receiving \nteletherapy  once  a  week).  In-person  services,  especially  those  involving  group \ngatherings, have of course been modified or suspended to facilitate social distancing. \nSee Gontang Decl. ¶ 11. But communal gatherings, including group meetings, have \nbeen curtailed throughout the broader community—a fact true for disabled and non-\ndisabled people alike. See, e.g., Julia Pinney, “As 12-Step Meetings Halt In Person \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 41 of 45\n \nDue to the Coronavirus, Recovery Goes Online,” Street Sense Media (April 16, 2020), \navailable at https://www.streetsensemedia.org/article/12-step-meetings-coronavirus-\nrecovery-online/#.Xp0DZZkpBPY (Alcoholics Anonymous groups no longer meeting \nin person in the District because of pandemic). Plaintiffs cannot succeed on an ADA \nclaim  challenging  the  adequacy  of  services  where  they  cannot  show  actual \ndiscrimination. See Doe v. Pfrommer, 148 F.3d 73, 84 (2d Cir. 1998) (rejecting ADA \nclaim where plaintiff’s challenge to state-run vocational education program for the \ndisabled  challenged  “not  illegal  discrimination  against  the  disabled,  but  the \nsubstance of the services provided to him through [the program]”); Buchanan v. \nMaine, 469 F.3d 158, 175 (1st Cir. 2006) (individual shot by police could not sue state \nunder ADA despite years of state-sponsored mental health treatment where “claim \nwas not about discriminatory denial of services, but rather about the adequacy of \ntreatment”). This is not a cognizable ADA claim and cannot succeed on the merits. \n2.  Even if Their Claims Are Otherwise Cognizable, Plaintiffs Have Not \nShown a Deprivation “By Reason Of” Their Disabilities. \n \nAn ADA plaintiff must show “sufficient facts to establish that the complained-\nof discrimination was due to his disability.” Seth, 2018 WL 4682023, at *11 (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (quoting Howell v. Gray, 843 F. Supp. 2d 49, 59 (D.D.C. \n2012)). It is a plaintiff’s burden to allege “that the disability actually played a role in \nthe decision making process and had a determinative influence on the outcome.” Id. \n(internal quotation marks omitted). Simply put, the plaintiff must “show that the \ncomplained-of  discrimination  was  based  on,  or  based  solely  on,  [the  plaintiff’s] \ndisability.” Id.  \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 42 of 45\n \nRegardless of the services Saint Elizabeths has had to modify during the \npandemic, plaintiffs cannot show that the District deprived them of anything “by \nreason of” their disabilities. Plaintiffs’ own allegations make clear that all relevant \nactions taken by Saint Elizabeths were implemented as reasonable responses to an \nemergency situation. Plaintiffs have not shown any other plausible reason for the \nmeasures imposed. Nothing in the record or even alleged in the Proposed Amended \nComplaint suggests that the District took the actions it did because of plaintiffs’ \ndisabilities.  \nC.  Plaintiffs Have Not Argued They Are Likely To Succeed on Their Claims \nBased on Any Facts About the Fall 2019 Water Outage. \n \nAs noted above, the legal claims laid out in plaintiffs’ Proposed Amended \nComplaint allege actions from two separate events:  the COVID-19 pandemic, and a \ntemporary water outage that occurred in the Fall of 2019. See Proposed Am. Compl. \nIn their motion for a TRO, however, plaintiffs argue they are likely to succeed on the \nmerits only based on the events of the pandemic. See generally Pls.’ Mem. They do \nnot include any arguments or factual proffers about the water outage. Without raising \nany arguments about these events, plaintiffs cannot show they are likely to succeed \non the merits based on any facts relating to the water outage.  \nIII.  The Balance of Equities and Public Interest Counsel Against the Preliminary \nRelief at Issue. \n \nEven if plaintiffs could show a likelihood of success on the merits and that \nirreparable harm would result without a TRO, they must additionally show both that \n“the balance of equities tips in their favor,” and that “an injunction is in the public \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 43 of 45\n \ninterest.” Sherley, 644 F.3d at 392; In re Navy Chaplaincy, 738 F.3d at 428 (plaintiffs \ncannot use strong showing on some factors to make up for weak showing on others). \nThese two factors “merge when the Government is the opposing party” and are thus \nanalyzed together. Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives, 920 \nF.3d 1, 10 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). “[W]here \nthe Court has a less intrusive means” of ensuring legal compliance, “the public \ninterest would weigh towards choosing such options, especially where … the plaintiffs \nseek a mandatory (‘do this’) rather than prohibitory (‘don’t do this’) injunction.” \nGarnett v. Zeilinger, 313 F. Supp. 3d 147, 160 (D.D.C. 2018). \n  Because Saint Elizabeths is already doing most of what plaintiffs seek from a \nTRO, the only question is whether the balance of the equities and the public interest \nfavor the remaining two items:  ceasing all admissions of new patients, and providing \nthe Court and plaintiffs’ counsel “with daily reports to ensure that the measures laid \nout in the Court’s order are being followed.” Pls.’ Proposed Order ¶¶ 1, 10. As \ndiscussed above, the screening and isolation measures the Hospital has imposed \nadequately mitigate the risks of continuing new admission, especially at their slow \npace. Candilis Decl. ¶¶ 7-9; Pontes Decl. ¶ 15. In any case, ceasing admissions—\nassuming Saint Elizabeths could do this—would not be in the public interest. The \nHospital already limits admissions to court-ordered pretrial defendants and only \nthose civil commitments that are medically necessary and where no less restrictive \ntreatment option is available. Candilis Decl. ¶ 5. Courts commit individuals to Saint \nElizabeths to receive care they likely could not receive anywhere other than a public \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42   Filed 04/21/20   Page 44 of 45\n \nhospital dedicated to the intensive care of those with psychological disabilities. See \nGontang Decl. ¶ 5. Denying these individuals admission would force them either to \nstay at home—for those who have homes—without any care, or to be placed into \nanother kind of facility such as an acute care hospital. As plaintiffs themselves \nobserve, hospitals and other healthcare facilities face a crisis of capacity trying to \ntreat an influx of COVID-19 patients. See Pls.’ Mem. at 10. In addition, those who \nwould otherwise be placed into Saint Elizabeths pre-trial might instead be put in jail \nwhere the resources do not exist to provide the same level of psychiatric care Saint \nElizabeths provides. Neither of these alternatives would be in the public interest and \nweigh decidedly against an order halting all new patient admissions. \n  The same is true for the detailed reporting requirement plaintiffs propose. \nThere is a well-established public interest in permitting the government to carry out \nits  authorized  functions  where  doing  otherwise  would  needlessly  upend  its \noperations. See Benisek v. Lamone, 138 S. Ct. 1942, 1945 (2018) (finding lower court \ncould have reasonably concluded that ordering redrawing of electoral district map \nwould have contravened public interest where “injunction might have worked a \nneedlessly chaotic and disruptive effect upon the electoral process” (citation and \ninternal quotation marks omitted)); Garnett, 313 F. Supp. 3d at 160 (public interest \n“would disfavor the Court’s interference” in legal process of administering food stamp \nbenefits “in light of [federal agency’s] expertise and role” in carrying it out). This is \nespecially true for a public hospital attempting to adjust its patient care to fluid public \nhealth  guidance  amid  an  ongoing  pandemic.

I am over the age of eighteen (18) years, competent to testify to the \nmatters contained in this declaration, and testify based on my personal knowledge \nacquired in the course of my official duties. \n2.  I am the Director of Medical Affairs for Saint Elizabeths Hospital, the \nDistrict of Columbia’s only public psychiatric facility for individuals with serious and \npersistent mental illness requiring intensive inpatient care to support their recovery. \nSaint Elizabeths is overseen by the District of Columbia Department of Behavioral \nHealth (DBH). \n3.  I have worked at Saint Elizabeths Hospital since 2014.  As a life-long \npublic sector physician, I have served in a variety of roles, including Director of the \nForensic Psychiatry Fellowship here at Saint Elizabeths, the program providing \nadvanced training for physicians in psychiatry and the law. I assumed the role of \nDirector of Medical Affairs in late October 2017. I am Professor of Psychiatry at \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42-1   Filed 04/21/20   Page 3 of 5\nGeorge Washington University School of Medicine, Clinical Professor of Psychiatry \nat Howard University College of Medicine, and Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry at the \nUniformed Services University of Health Sciences. I also serve as President of the \nWashington Psychiatric Society. I am board-certified in both general and forensic \npsychiatry, have practiced psychiatry for over 25 years, and have had my work \npublished extensively in a number of academic journals and texts.    \n4.  As Director of Medical Affairs at Saint Elizabeths, I oversee medical and \npsychiatric care and am familiar with the Hospital’s daily operations, including \nmeasures that protect patients and staff from COVID-19.   \n5.  Saint Elizabeths Hospital’s policy generally limits admissions to court-\nordered pre-trial individuals and only those referred through the civil commitment \nprocess for whom (1) admission to the Hospital is medically necessary, and (2) no less \nrestrictive treatment option is available. The Hospital rigorously screens all new \npatients to prevent the introduction of a positive COVID-19 patient from outside the \nhospital.   \n6.  Patients admitted to Saint Elizabeths fall into three categories:  pre-\ntrial patients, post-trial patients deemed not guilty by reason of insanity (NGBRI), \nand civilly committed patients. Pre-trial and post-trial patients are often referred to \nas “forensic patients” because they are admitted by order of the D.C. Superior Court \nthrough  criminal  justice  matters.  Civilly  committed  patients  are  individuals \nhospitalized under D.C. Code § 21-501, et seq. upon being deemed a danger to \nthemselves or others as a result of mental illness. The Hospital’s current screening \n2  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42-1   Filed 04/21/20   Page 4 of 5\nprocedures  for  new  admission  vary  depending  on  the  category  of  patient  being \nadmitted because each presents different risks for COVID-19 exposure.  \n7.  Since  March  11,  2020,  the  Hospital  has  admitted  three  (3)  civilly \ncommitted patients, compared to an average 6-7 patients per month pre-COVID-19.  \n8.  The civil admission process includes robust screening measures. Civil \npatients are rarely admitted directly from the community. Rather, a civilly committed \npatient  will  normally  receive  treatment  first  at  a  local  emergency  room  or  the \nDepartment of Behavioral Health Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Program \n(CPEP) for one or two days and then transfer to a local area hospital for continued \nacute psychiatric treatment. After 14 days that include medical monitoring and \ntreatment,  the  hospital  treating  the  patient  may  request  a  transfer  to  Saint \nElizabeths Hospital. This occurs only in rare cases as most patients can be discharged \ndirectly back into the community. \n9.  Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, I have been personally involved \nin the screening of civil admissions to ensure that patients have been properly \nscreened at the local hospital, are asymptotic for COVID-19 and not experiencing \nrespiratory  symptoms.  I  make  this  assessment  by  speaking  with  the  patient’s \ntreating  physician.  If  the  patient  is  symptomatic,  the  Hospital  will  decline  the \nreferral. In addition, before any patient is admitted, a Saint Elizabeths general \nmedical officer or nurse practitioner conducts a thorough assessment to screen for \nany possible COVID-19 symptoms. The Hospital will follow this protocol for all \nsubsequent requests for civil admissions from acute care hospitals during COVID-19.      \n3  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42-1   Filed 04/21/20   Page 5 of 5\nI declare under the penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to \nthe best of my knowledge, information, and belief. \n \n____April 21, 2020_______                     \nDATED  Philip J.

I am over the age of eighteen (18) years, competent to testify to the \nmatters contained in this declaration, and testify based on my personal knowledge \nacquired in the course of my official duties. \n2.  I am the Chief Clinical Officer for Saint Elizabeths Hospital (Saint \nElizabeths), the District of Columbia’s only public psychiatric facility for individuals \nwith serious  and persistent  mental  illness  requiring  intensive  inpatient  care  to \nsupport their recovery. Saint Elizabeths is overseen by the District of Columbia \nDepartment of Behavioral Health (DBH). \n3.  I have worked at Saint Elizabeths Hospital since March 2008. I have \nserved in a variety of roles at Saint Elizabeths, including Director of Psychology \nTraining and Director of Psychology. I assumed the role of Chief Clinical Officer in \nApril of 2016.   \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42-2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 3 of 7\n4.  As the Chief Clinical Officer, I am in charge of the non-medical and non-\nnursing clinical disciplines at Saint Elizabeths, including psychology, social work, \nrehabilitation  services,  clinical  administrators,  volunteer  services,  and  the \nTherapeutic Learning Centers. Through my position, I am aware of Saint Elizabeths \nHospital operations on a daily basis to protect patients and staff from COVID-19.  \n5.  Saint Elizabeths  is unique  among healthcare  facilities  in that it  is \nforemost a psychiatric treatment facility but also houses pre- and post-trial patients \nand shares similarities with long-term care nursing facilities. The Hospital provides \ncritical services to some of the District’s most vulnerable residents, and the need for \nthese services has not stopped during the current public health emergency. The \nHospital has implemented thorough screening procedures to allow for the continued \nadmission of a limited number of new patients during the pandemic, while also \nprotecting the patients already in its care.  \n6.  Saint Elizabeths Hospital has the capacity to house 292 patients. Pre-\nCOVID-19, the Hospital’s population census averaged 275 patients. On February 1, \n2020, the Hospital census was 277. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the Hospital has \nsubstantially reduced its census. As of April 21, 2020, the Hospital census is 221. \nEach unit at the Hospital generally houses no more than 27 patients, and has \nbedrooms, common living areas, bathrooms and showering facilities, and dining \nareas. \n7.   For  patients  currently  in  Saint  Elizabeths’  care,  the  Hospital  has \nalways maintained an individualized assessment on all patients to identify potential \n2  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42-2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 4 of 7\nfor treatment in the least restrictive environment. This is a core function of the \nHospital’s Department of Social Work. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hospital \nhas individually assessed each patient to determine whether the patient can be safely \ndischarged from the Hospital. The Hospital’s authority to discharge patients depends \nupon their category. Pre-trial and post-trial patients are referred by the D.C. Superior \nCourt amid ongoing criminal proceedings. In response to a motion filed in Superior \nCourt, Saint Elizabeths completed individual evaluations of all pretrial forensic \npatients charged with misdemeanors and made recommendations to the court. Since \nMarch 1, 2020, the D.C. Superior Court has ordered 39 pretrial patients released from \nthe Hospital. The D.C. Superior Court ordered 5 patients discharged on April 15, \n2020, and 9 on April 17, 2020, and continues to hear individual motions from pre-\ntrial patients for release.  \n8.  Saint Elizabeths has also completed individual assessments for post-\ntrial patients, individuals who were found Not Guilty By Reason of Insanity (NGBRI) \nand committed to the Hospital by court order. By law, the Hospital is required to \nconsider public safety and the risk of dangerousness and recidivism in evaluating \nNGBRI patients for community release. The Hospital has evaluated all NGBRI \npatients for discharge, including the named plaintiffs in this case. \n9.  Civilly committed patients are those hospitalized after being deemed a \ndanger to themselves or others as a result of mental illness. We have completed \nindividualized assessments for all civilly committed patients.  \n3  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42-2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 5 of 7\n10.  A  patient’s  ability  to  safely  live in the community  remains  a  long-\nstanding challenge to discharging. Many of our patients do not have secure housing \navailable to them. Options such as homeless shelters lack adequate services and \nsupports for our patients and may lead to a return to inpatient setting. Successful \ncommunity discharge generally requires close coordination with a community-based \nmental health provider called a Core Services Agency, or CSA. CSAs typically provide \nin-home services, but this is difficult to provide if the discharged patient lacks safe \nand stable housing. An additional concern is that the threat of COVID-19 is prevalent \nin the community as well. For example, a patient residing in a group home risks \nexposure to asymptomatic roommates, guardians, and others that are free to travel \nin and out of the home creating risk of exposure. A vulnerable patient that does not \nhave  the  mental  capacity  to  adhere  to  social  distancing,  cough  etiquette,  hand \nwashing, and other COVID-19 precautions in the community may not be any safer \nwhen compared to the Hospital, with ready access to mental health, medical and \nnursing care.   \n11.  Some of our mental health treatment has been modified because of the \npandemic.  All  group  therapy  has  been  suspended  because  of  CDC  guidance  on \nminimizing  group  interactions.  However,  group  therapy  is  just  one  method  of \ndelivering one aspect of mental health treatment in the Hospital. Every patient has \na treatment team that consists of a clinical administrator that is responsible for \ncoordinating  all  care,  a  psychiatrist  responsible  for  psychiatric  treatment  and \nmedications, a social worker responsible for discharge planning, and a registered \n4  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42-2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 6 of 7\nnurse responsible for daily nursing care. In addition, each unit has a general medical \nofficer or nurse practitioner for medical issues and a psychologist for psychological \nservices.  Individual  patients  may  also  have  other  individual  needs,  such  as \nrehabilitation,  interpreter  services  (both  in-person  and  remote),  neurology,  and \naccess to external medical care. The Hospital has a neurology department with an \non-site neurologist who provides services to patients that require that level of care. \nWhile groups are temporarily suspended, all patients continue to receive appropriate \nand individualized psychiatric treatment, including medications, medical, nursing, \nand social work services, and any other specialty services that they require.    \n12.  The  Hospital  has  provided  WebEx  accounts  for  staff  to  conduct \nindividual telehealth consultations with patients for those that require individual \none-to-one therapy. Each patient unit has a shared computer, cleaned and sanitized \nregularly, that is dedicated to this purpose. Saint Elizabeths Hospital is monitoring \npatients to ensure this change does not negatively affect patients’ psychological \nstability.  \n13.  In the last 30 days, the Hospital has used its telehealth technology to \nconduct  treatment  planning  meetings,  individual  therapy,  discharge  planning \nmeetings, legal visits and court appearances for Mental Observation and Mental \nHealth Commission hearings. To increase its telehealth capacity, on April 17, 2020, \nthe Hospital received 14 more devices that will be used for telehealth. \n14.  In the last 30 days, there has been a documented reduction in aggressive \nand assaultive behavior among patients at Saint Elizabeths. Prior to COVID-19, the \n5  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03185-RDM   Document 42-2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 7 of 7\nhospital averaged 43 unusual incidents of physical assault and 69 unusual incidents \nof  aggressive  behavior  by  patients.  Since  mid-March,  the  Hospital  reported  24 \nunusual incidents involving physical assault and 63 unusual incidents of aggressive \nbehavior.    \nI declare under the penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to \nthe best of my knowledge, information, and belief. \n \n4/21/2020\n________________________          ____________________________________  \nDATED           RICHARD
