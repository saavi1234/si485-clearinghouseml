    "summary": "<p>On April 20, 2020, prisoners incarcerated in Massachusetts correctional facilities filed this class-action lawsuit against the Commissioner of the the Massachusetts Department of Corrections, the chair of the Parole Board, and the Governor. The prisoners, represented by Prisoners Legal Services of Massachusetts, sued on behalf of all prisoners incarcerated in Massachusetts prisons and jails, included two subclasses: (1) All prisoners who are at high risk for serious complication or death from COVID-19 due to underlying medical condition or age, and (2) all prisoners civilly committed to a correctional facility for treatment of an alcohol or substance use disorder. Under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, the plaintiffs alleged violations of the Eighth And Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution; they also alleged violations of the Massachusetts Constitution. They brought the case before Judge Elspeth Cypher of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court before proceeding before the full court.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought attorneys' fees and injunctive relief ordering the defendants to release putative class-members in order to achieve social distancing within the facilities. Concurrently, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunctive relief seeking the release of class members.The plaintiffs alleged that the state failed to enable social distancing in correctional facilities because the prisons and jails do not have the requisite space to comply with CDC-recommended guidelines. Additionally, the facilities were allegedly \"filthy and unsanitary,\" further exacerbating the risk of disease spread. While the plaintiffs sought release of all class members to enable adequate social distancing, those with underlying medical conditions or old age were particularly vulnerable to severe complications if they contracted COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>The state officials filed a motion to dismiss on April 24, 2020. Oral argument was heard before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court on May 7. The plaintiffs noted that 358 Massachusetts inmates had already tested positive for COVID-19 and articulated their request for population reduction, although they could not provide an exact number that would achieve the social distancing guidelines. The defendants, meanwhile, argued that they had already taken steps to limit the disease's spread and would continue to monitor the situation. Additionally, the plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment claim alleged that incarceration for substance abuse during COVID-19 violated substantive due process rights and did not advance the legislative goal of treatment.</p>\r\n<p>On June 2, 2020, the Supreme Judicial Court denied the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary relief. 484 Mass. 698 (2020). In an opinion written by Judge Gaziano, the Court noted the steps taken by the corrections facilities already including increased emphasis on sanitation, physical distancing where possible, testing, and quarantining. With regards to the plaintiffs' Eighth Amendment claim, the Court found that the objective component was satisfied, but said that plaintiffs failed to satisfy the subjective component of the test for liability--deliberate indifference-- because the plaintiffs could not identify how the correctional facilities were not in compliance with CDC interim guidelines for prisons and jails. Regarding the plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment claims, the Court found that the \"significant steps\" taken to lessen the risk of transmissions were sufficient to preclude a finding that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim. However, the Court did acknowledge that continued incarceration for substance abuse was questionable given pandemic. Therefore, the Court ordered that any individual who is committed pursuant to G. L. c. 123, &sect; 35 (Commitment of alcoholics or substance abusers) may file a motion for reconsideration of the commitment order. The Court did not decide whether class certification should be granted, but rather remanded the issue to the Superior Court for resolution.</p>\r\n<p>The same day, the Court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss. 484 Mass. 1059 (2020). The Court granted the Governor's motion to dismiss, finding that the Governor could not be held liable for things he had not done, and determining that the Court could not order the Court to utilize his emergency powers. The Court dismissed the claims against the parole board that related to the commitment of alcoholics and substance abusers, but denied the motion to dismiss for other claims against the parole board. The Court noted that, if the parole board failed to exercise its statutory authority to remedy a constitutional violation, the Court had power to order such action.</p>\r\n<p>The SJC docket page does not have live links to filings, but they are available <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/service-details/stephen-foster-others-v-carol-mici-commissioner-of-the-massachusetts-department-of\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>As of June 14, the case is ongoing before the state Superior Court.</p>",

This Complaint seeks the release of sentenced and civilly committed persons who \nby virtue of their age or medical condition are at imminent risk of serious illness or death if \ninfected by COVID-19. In describing the threat posed by COVID-19, the Supreme Judicial Court \nhas declared that “the situation is urgent and unprecedented, and . . . a reduction in the number of \npeople who are held in custody is necessary.” Comm. for Pub. Counsel Servs. v. Chief Justice of \nthe Trial Court, No. SJC-12926, 2020 WL 1659939, at *3 (Mass. Apr. 3, 2020).  \n\n2.  The Commonwealth’s prisons and jails are the perfect incubators for the disease, \nthreatening to consume vital health care resources and endangering the general public as well as \nthose incarcerated and correctional staff.  \n3.  Although Defendants have made attempts to mitigate the dangers posed by \nCOVID-19, they have failed to take steps that are readily available to reduce the incarcerated \npopulation to a reasonably safe level and protect the prisoners who must remain incarcerated.  \n4.  The Governor has made it clear that he does not intend to take any additional \naction to protect prisoners or correctional staff from infection. In commenting about the petition \nfiled by the Committee for Public Counsel Services (“CPCS”) and the Massachusetts \nAssociation of Criminal Defense Lawyers, he stated:  \nWe don’t buy as a matter of law, fact or policy that the argument that’s being made \nbefore the court is the correct one. We believe the correct position is for us to be continue \ndoing the things we’re doing to keep the people inside safe, and that’s gonna be the way \nwe play this one.1 \n5.  As the Supreme Judicial Court recently explained, “correctional institutions face \nunique difficulties in keeping their populations safe during this pandemic.” Comm. for Pub. \nCounsel Servs., 2020 WL 1659939, at *3. The risk is significantly higher than in the community \nin terms of risk of transmission, exposure, and harm to individuals who become infected. This is \ndue to a number of factors, including, among others, the inability to engage in social distancing, \nthe inability to isolate and manage known and suspected cases of COVID-19, and endemic \nproblems of hygiene and sanitation that plague Massachusetts prisons and jails. \n6.  COVID-19 is now spreading rapidly throughout the Department of Correction \n(“DOC”) and many county correctional facilities. Between April 5 and the April 13 report of the \n \n1 See Deborah Becker, Mass. High Court Considers Releasing Some Prisoners To Prevent COVID-19 Outbreak, \nNew England Public Radio (Apr. 1, 2020), https://www.nepr.net/post/mass-high-court-considers-releasing-some-\nprisoners-prevent-covid-19-outbreak#stream/0. \n2 \n\nSpecial Master in SJC-12926, the number of COVID-19 cases among prisoners, staff, and \nvendors across the state shot up from 30 to 243, and the number continues to rise steeply. In the \nfew days since then, that number has climbed to 319.2 At least five prisoners have died. Indeed, \nthe rate of infection inside the DOC is more than twice as high as in Massachusetts as a whole. \nThe actual number of cases in the DOC is likely far higher than the confirmed numbers because \nof the limited availability of COVID-19 tests and the fact that many people are asymptomatic. \n7.  Defendants are failing to meet their responsibility to enable social distancing in \nprisons and jails. Prisoners continue to be housed in close contact with each other in dormitory-\nstyle settings and double cells that do not meet the minimum space requirements established by \nthe Department of Public Health (“DPH”). Many prisoners are using common showers, common \ntoilets, and common sinks shared with an entire dorm or unit that are often filthy and unsanitary. \n8.  For example, a recent DPH inspection of the Massachusetts Treatment Center \n(MTC) found:  \nThroughout the facility, bathrooms and shower areas were observed to be poorly \nmaintained resulting in unsanitary conditions. The CSP is concerned with the increased \nrisk of disease transmission with the high number of inmates being exposed to such \nunsanitary conditions.3 \n \nNot surprisingly, COVID-19 is rampant at the MTC, with 41 cases and four deaths as of April \n13, 2020.  \n9.  In contrast to correctional officials in other states, Defendants have also failed to \nimplement readily available measures to reduce the incarcerated population, such as release to \nhome confinement, medical furloughs, enhanced good time sentence deductions, expedited \n \n2 ACLU of Massachusetts, Tracking COVID-19 in Massachusetts Prison & Jails: Total Positive Tests, \ndata.aclum.org/sjc-12926-tracker/ (last visited April 17, 2020) \n3 See Letter from Patrick Wallace, Environmental Health Inspector, DPH, to Lisa Mitchell, Superintendent of MTC \n(Sept. 26, 2019) at 22, available at https://www.mass.gov/doc/massachusetts-treatment-center-bridgewater-\nseptember-17-2019/download. \n3 \n\nparole hearings, review of clemency petitions, and a streamlined process to release the 300 or \nmore individuals who have already been granted parole yet remain in custody.4 DOC has not \neven been willing to identify obvious candidates for medical parole who are not competent to \ncome forward on their own. Defendants also continue to imprison more than 150 men who have \nbeen civilly committed under G.L. c. 123, § 35, for treatment of alcohol and substance use \ndisorders even though no such treatment is now available.  \n10.  Defendants’ failure to take reasonable measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 \nviolates the rights of prisoners under articles 1, 10, 12, and 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration \nof Rights and the Fifth and Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and the rights \nof pre-trial detainees and civilly committed individuals to substantive due process protected by \nthe Fourteenth Amendment and articles 1, 10, and 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.  \nPARTIES \n11.  Plaintiff Stephen Foster is imprisoned in the Old Colony Correctional Center. He \nis 43 years old with a history of numerous serious medical conditions—including heart failure, \ninfective endocarditis, septic emboli to the brain, lungs, spine, and joints, and serious ears, nose, \nand throat complications—that heighten his risk of death should he contract COVID-19. After \naccounting for his good conduct in prison (i.e., his eligibility for an early release due to “earned \ngood time”), Mr. Foster is scheduled to complete his 3- to 5-year sentence for assault and battery \nand related convictions in 2022, and he is eligible for parole in June 2020. A petition for Mr. \nFoster’s release on medical parole is pending with the DOC. \n12.  Plaintiff Michael Gomes is currently imprisoned in Massachusetts Correctional \nInstitution (“MCI”) Concord. He is 50 years old and had a liver transplant in 2016, which \n \n4 See Comm. for Pub. Counsel Servs., 2020 WL 1659939, at *3. \n  \n4 \n\nrequires Mr. Gomes to take daily anti-rejection medication that leaves him \nimmunocompromised. He is imprisoned for failing a drug test while on probation in August \n2019 after his sister, mother, and daughter all died within 90 days of each other and he relapsed. \nMr. Gomes is set for release in July 2021 and will be eligible for parole in May 2020. Currently, \nhe lives in a prison dormitory with over 80 other people who sleep in bunk beds just three feet \napart. \n13.  Plaintiff Peter Kyriakides is imprisoned in Pondville Correctional Center, a \nminimum security and pre-release prison run by the DOC. He is incarcerated on a probation \nviolation and is set to complete his sentence on June 1, 2020. Currently, he lives in a two-person \ncell that is five feet long and four feet wide, making it impossible for him to maintain six feet’s \ndistance from his cellmate. He is 52 years old and has asthma for which he is prescribed two \ninhalers.   \n14.  Plaintiff Richard O’Rourke is imprisoned in the Plymouth County Correctional \nFacility. He is 64 years old and has a history of respiratory conditions, including multiple \nhospitalizations for bronchitis and severe pneumonia. He has already served more than 14 \nmonths of his three-year sentence for operating a vehicle while under the influence, and he will \nbe eligible for parole in approximately seven months. \n15.  Plaintiff Steven Palladino is imprisoned in MCI Norfolk. He is 52 years old and \nhas insulin-dependent diabetes as well as kidney disease. He has served eight and a half years of \na 10- to 12-year sentence, plus two years on and after for committing non-violent financial and \nrelated crimes. He was participating in the dog training program at MCI Norfolk until the prison \nwas locked down due to the virus and the dogs were removed.     \n5 \n\n16.  Plaintiff Mark Santos was recently imprisoned in the Massachusetts Alcohol and \nSubstance Abuse Center (“MASAC”), which is located at MCI Plymouth. He was civilly \ncommitted to MASAC solely for treatment of his substance use disorder. Starting in mid-March, \nsubstance use treatment at MASAC was drastically curtailed, and in early April 2020 all \ntreatment at the facility was cancelled. Mr. Santos is 23 years old. He was released from \nMASAC on April 9, 2020, and now lives with his mother. \n17.  Plaintiff David Sibnich is imprisoned in the Pondville Correctional Center. He is \n61 years old and suffers from high blood pressure and a diagnosis of probable prostate cancer. In \n1982, Mr. Sibnich was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole for armed \nrobbery. The Parole Board approved him for parole more than a year ago, and he was scheduled \nto move to a long-term residential program in his home state, New York, in March, but he \nremains incarcerated at Pondville.  \n18.  Plaintiff Michelle Tourigny is imprisoned in MCI Framingham. She is 53 years \nold and suffers from serious medical conditions, including spinal stenosis, morbid obesity, a \nheart condition that requires a pacemaker, and a lung that has been surgically partially removed. \nMs. Tourigny is living in the Health Services Unit because of her medical conditions, which \nmeans she is in routine contact with sick prisoners as well as medical and correctional staff. She \nis serving a second-degree life sentence for killing her abusive boyfriend in 1998, and a petition \nfor her release on medical parole is pending with the DOC. \n19.  Plaintiff Michael White is imprisoned in MCI Concord. He is 35 years old and \nhas COPD as well as severe asthma. He is currently living in a dormitory with over 80 other \npeople, all of whom sleep in bunk beds and share just five lunch tables and two bathrooms. Now \nthat MCI Concord has been locked down, they are all always in the room together, and he is \n6 \n\noften within arm’s reach of others. He is scheduled to complete his sentence for unarmed robbery \nin July 2021. \n20.  Plaintiff Frederick Yeomans is imprisoned in the Barnstable County Correctional \nFacility for driving with a suspended license. He is 72 years old and has been diagnosed with \nheart disease and high blood pressure. Mr. Yeomans is eligible for release later this year after \naccounting for earned good time, and he would otherwise complete his sentence in October \n2021. \n21.  Plaintiff Hendrick Davis is imprisoned in the Massachusetts Treatment Center \n(“MTC”). Mr. Davis is 37 years old and suffers from stage-four kidney disease. He has served \nmore than four years of his five-year to five-year-and-a-day sentence. With good time, he will be \neligible for release later this year.  \n22.   Defendant Carol Mici is the Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of \nCorrection. By statute, Defendant Mici is responsible for the administration of all correctional \nfacilities in Massachusetts, including county correctional facilities and MASAC. See G.L. c. 124, \n§ 1. Defendant Mici maintains an office at 50 Maple Street, Suite 3, Milford, Massachusetts \n01757. She is sued in her official capacity. \n23.  Defendant Gloriann Moroney is the chair of the Massachusetts Parole Board. As \nsuch, she is the executive and administrative head of the agency. Her powers and duties include \ndeveloping and implementing the policies and procedures of the agency. G.L. c. 27, § 4; 120 \nCMR 101.02(3).

As of April 16, there were 32,181 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1,245 \ndeaths from the virus in Massachusetts. Roughly 3,400 patients are currently admitted to \nhospitals with either confirmed or suspected cases of coronavirus, including more than 970 in the \nintensive-care units. Nation-wide, over 650,000 Americans have contracted COVID-19 and more \nthan 31,000 have died—more than in any other country on the globe.  \n27.  Massachusetts prisons and jails are fast becoming an epicenter of the COVID-19 \npandemic as COVID-19 spreads quickly within them. The Department of Correction and \n8 \n\nSheriffs’ reports to the SJC’s Special Master reflect that, as of April 17, 319 prisoners and staff \nhave been diagnosed with the virus and five prisoners have died.5   \n28.  The number of COVID-19 cases is expanding rapidly with some prisons showing \nastonishingly high levels of infection. For example, on April 13, there were two confirmed \ninmate cases at the Hampshire County Jail and House of Correction; just two days later, 11 \nprisoners (7.2% of the population) and one staff member had tested positive.6 At MCI-\nFramingham, the state prison for women, 26 prisoners—13.2 % of all prisoners in the facility—\nhad tested positive by April 14, up from only four cases a week earlier.  \n29.  COVID-19 is a particularly contagious disease. According to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”), it spreads “mainly from person-to-person” \nbetween those “who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)” and from contact \nwith contaminated surfaces.7 A recent study showed that the virus can survive for up to three \nhours in the air, four hours on copper, up to twenty-four hours on cardboard, and up to two to \nthree days on plastic and stainless steel.8  \n30.  The most common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness \nof breath, but one need not present any symptoms to have the virus or be contagious. The \naverage incubation period (i.e., the time between exposure and development of symptoms) for \nCOVID-19 is about five days, and 98% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 12 \ndays. \n \n5 See ACLU of Massachusetts, Tracking COVID-19 in Massachusetts Prison & Jails: Total Positive Tests, \ndata.aclum.org/sjc-12926-tracker/ (last visited April 17, 2020).  \n6 Michael Connors, Hampshire jail reports 11 inmates with coronavirus, Daily Hampshire Gazette (Apr. 14, 2020, \n6:41 PM), https://www.gazettenet.com/More-inmates-at-the-Hampshire-County-jail-test-positive-for-COVID-19-\n33893116. \n7 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID): How to Protect Yourself and Others, CDC (Apr. 13, 2020), \nhttp://cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html. \n8 Novel Coronavirus Can live on Some Surfaces for Up to 3 Days, New Tests Show, TIME \nhttps://time.com/5801278/coronavirus-stays-on-surfaces-days-tests/ (last visited Mar. 31, 2020). \n9 \n\n31.  Older adults and people with pre-existing health conditions such as cardiovascular \ndiseases, respiratory diseases, liver disease, and diabetes are at increased risk for severe COVID-\n19 complications and death. Mortality from COVID-19 increases substantially with age: risk of \ndeath starts increasing among people in their sixties and then increases dramatically for each \ndecade of life thereafter.9 In Massachusetts, 99% of deaths due to COVID-19 have been among \nresidents over age 50.10 \n32.  Massachusetts prisoners are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 disease. The \nDOC has the highest percentage of elderly prisoners compared to all other states.11 According to \nthe DOC, 983 inmates (11%) were over 60 years old and 2,510 (29%) were over 50 years old in \n2019.12 This population bears a significant burden of chronic illness, including respiratory \nconditions, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and liver disease.13  \n33.  Persons who are incarcerated are at high risk of complications and death from \nCOVID-19 at a younger age than the general public. This is because they experience \n“accelerated aging,” meaning they develop chronic conditions and disability about 10-15 years \nearlier than the general population due to multiple layers of medical vulnerability (e.g., poverty, \npoor access to health care, and substance use). They also experience worsening of chronic health \nproblems due to the resource-constrained, high-stress environments of jails and prisons. \n \n9 Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General, World Health Organization, Opening Remarks at the Media \nBriefing on COVID-19 (3 March 2020), available at https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-\ns-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---3-march-2020. \n10 Andrew Ryan, Elderly residents continue to bear the brunt of coronavirus infection in Mass., data show, Boston \nGlobe (Apr. 9, 2020), available at https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/09/nation/elderly-residents-continue-bear-\nbrunt-coronavirus-infection-mass-data-show/. \n11 Matt McKillop & Alex Boucher, Aging Prison Populations Drive Up Costs: Older individuals have more chronic \nillnesses and other ailments that necessitate greater spending, Pew Charitable Trusts (Feb. 20, 2018). \nhttps://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2018/02/20/aging-prison-populations-drive-up-costs \n12 Massachusetts DOC, Inmate and Prison Research Statistics. \nhttps://public.tableau.com/profile/madoc#!/vizhome/MADOCJan1Snapshot/Jan1Snapshot. \n13 Maruschak LM, Berzofsky M, Unangst J.

Washington, DC: US Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statistics; 2015 Feb. \n10 \n\nAdvanced age and chronic health conditions such as these substantially increase risk for severe \nCOVID-19 complications, including death.14 \n34.  The CDC and other public health agencies have universally prescribed social \ndistancing—every person should remain at a distance of at least six feet from every other \nperson—and rigorous hygiene—including regular and thorough hand washing with soap and \nwater, the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer, proper sneeze and cough etiquette, and frequent \ncleaning of all surfaces—as the only ways to meaningfully mitigate the spread of this virus. \n35.  The CDC has issued guidance stating that “[a]lthough social distancing is \nchallenging to practice in correctional and detention environments, it is a cornerstone of reducing \ntransmission of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19.”15 The SJC also observed in Comm. for \nPub. Counsel Servs., supra, that “maintaining adequate physical distance, i.e., maintaining six \nfeet of distance between oneself and others, may be nearly impossible in prisons and jails.” 2020 \nWL 1659939, at *3. Indeed, a spokesperson for Bristol County House of Correction recently \nacknowledged, “Six feet apart is practically impossible in any correctional setting, in any jail, in \nany prison, in any state, in any county, anywhere.”16 \nConditions in Massachusetts Prisons and Jails Expose Prisoners to Serious Risk of \nContracting COVID-19 \n \n36.  Few of the recommended measures for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 are \nreliably available for persons confined in correctional facilities and for those who must interact \nwith them. Correctional facilities are inherently congregate environments, where large groups of \npeople live, eat, and sleep in close contact with one another.  \n \n14 World Health Organization (2014).

The DOC admits social distancing is virtually impossible for prisoners. In a letter \nto the Supreme Judicial Court dated April 2, 2020, the DOC wrote that approximately 72% of its \npopulation cannot maintain the six-foot recommended distancing while sleeping. Comm. for Pub. \nCounsel Servs. et al. v. Chief Justice of the Trial Court et al., SJC-12926, Dkt. 56 (Mass. decided \nApril 3, 2020).  \n38.  Most correctional facilities rely heavily on dormitory-style housing in which \nprisoners share space for sleeping, eating, and recreation and use common toilets, sinks, and \nshowers. Some dormitories hold over 100 prisoners, who sleep within 2 to 3 feet of one another. \nPeople in these units cough and sneeze on each other and are not provided masks.  \n39.  The use of dormitory-style housing in medical units and assisted living units, \nwhich house many of the most vulnerable prisoners, is particularly problematic. For example, the \nClinical Stabilization Unit (“CSU”) at MCI-Norfolk holds some sixteen prisoners, largely \nelderly, with medical conditions such as COPD and congestive heart failure, who live, sleep and \neat in close proximity to each other. The CSU at MCI-Shirley holds a similarly vulnerable \npopulation.  \n40.  Even where dormitories are not used, most prisons and jails rely on double- and \ntriple-bunking of cells, that do not comply with the minimum standards for cell and floor space \nset by the Department of Public Health. Where cells are double bunked, it is impossible to \nmaintain social distance because prisoners are locked into a small space together, and continue to \ndepend on nurses and correctional officers to meet their needs. Although many county facilities \nreport that prisoners in two-person cells are asked to lie at opposite ends of the bed (head-to-foot) \n12 \n\nto create six feet of distance, given the close quarters and poor circulation, this offers no \nmeaningful protection even if the prisoners stayed in bed all day. \n41.  On April 3, 2020, the Department of Correction instituted a system-wide \nlockdown, which means that prisoners are confined to their cells or dorms for at least 23 hours \ndaily. This is not a sustainable response to the inevitable spread of COVID-19. Indefinite lock-\nins will take too great a toll on the mental health of vulnerable prisoners, and will also not be \neffective at controlling the virus since it requires officers and medical staff to go cell to cell all \nday long, bringing food and medicine, as well as monitoring the health of prisoners. This is of \ngrave concern, as the design and staffing of such units do not provide for the frequent monitoring \nthat patients with this virus require. A patient’s condition can worsen dramatically in a matter of \nhours. \n42.  The DOC and some counties have quarantined individuals who may have been \nexposed to COVID-19 in the same housing unit as individuals with confirmed COVID 19 \ndisease. For example, a woman at MCI Framingham with severe COPD had tested negative for \nthe virus when checked at an outside hospital, but she was subsequently quarantined in a cell in a \nunit where the other prisoners had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. She has now also tested \npositive for the virus.  \n43.  Prisoners who need medication or medical care are often forced to be in close \nproximity to each other. Medical units are small, and prisoners who are called to these units for \nappointments will frequently wait together in small rooms where they cannot maintain distance \nfrom one another. Many prisoners receive medication in “medication lines” where they stand one \nright behind another while waiting to receive their prescribed medications. At MTC, for \n13 \n\nexample, a prisoner with a dry cough and a fever suggestive of COVID-19 was made to wait in \nthe same compact med-line as other prisoners, some of whom were also coughing. \n44.  Because of the lockdown, most prisoners now eat meals in their units instead of a \n“chow hall.” This does not eliminate risk of contamination or ensure proper social distancing. In \ndormitories, even prisoners who avoid communal tables and eat at their bunks are still within a \nfew feet of one another. \nSanitation and Hygiene Problems \n45.   The risk of contracting an infectious disease is also elevated in Massachusetts \ncorrectional facilities because they are not sanitary environments. People share toilets, sinks, and \nshowers, and often have limited access to soap, hand sanitizer, hot water, and other necessary \nhygiene items. Surfaces are infrequently washed, if at all, and cleaning supplies are in short \nsupply. \n46.  The bathrooms are cleaned too infrequently. One prisoner described the sinks and \ntoilets as sometimes being “clogged with fecal matter and toilet paper” despite cleaning once a \nday in the morning. At Pondville Correctional Center, the floor beneath a urinal shared by 50 \nprisoners is regularly covered with urine. Others have noted that showers are cleaned only every \nfew days, despite the fact that “[e]ven on a good day, you don’t want to accidentally touch those \nwalls.” Some showers are not even cleaned after they are used by prisoners quarantined for \npotential COVID-19 infection, which leads others in the facility to avoid using the showers \naltogether. \n47.   The Department of Public Health (“DPH”) inspects all Massachusetts \ncorrectional facilities twice per year to assess compliance with the health and sanitation \nstandards set forth in 105 CMR 451. These reports show that the DOC and county sheriffs \n14 \n\nroutinely fail to meet minimum standards that promote and protect the health and safety of their \npopulations, even under non-emergency conditions. According to the most recent inspections \nfrom late 2019 and early 2020, only one of the Commonwealth’s 35 correctional facilities had \nzero repeat environmental health violations at its most recent inspection; 25 of them (71%) had \n50 or more repeat violations; 11 (31%) had more than 190 repeat violations each.17 For example, \nthe most recent report for MCI-Norfolk, notes 475 repeat violations. Given the current strained \nstate of staffing in correctional institutions, it is virtually impossible to ensure virus-free surfaces. \n48.  The lack of social distancing is made worse by prisons’ and jails’ failure to \nprovide sufficient personal protective equipment to prevent the spread of disease. \n49.   Most facilities do not give prisoners masks. Most correctional staff have masks, \nbut some officers wear them irregularly, some not at all; officers do not always wear masks or \ngloves when handing out meals. Medical staff do not always wear masks and gloves, or change \ngloves between patients. Since the lockdown at MCI-Shirley, diabetic prisoners receive insulin \ninjections in their cells from nurses wearing the same gloves used when giving injections to other \nprisoners. \nInadequate Medical Care \n50.  Incarcerated people in Massachusetts lack access to timely, quality medical care. \n \nA federal court recently found that, even though “Massachusetts does not recognize capital \npunishment,” the DOC was “neither able nor willing to provide” for a prisoner’s medical needs, \nand that as a result of its “woeful disregard” for his well-being, the DOC was “slowly killing \nhim.” It therefore ordered the DOC to transfer the prisoner to a non-correctional health care \n \n17 The 2019 inspection reports are available here: https://www.mass.gov/lists/2019- correctional-facility-inspection-\nreports. The 2020 inspection reports are available here: https://www.mass.gov/lists/2020-correctional-facility-\ninspection-reports. \n15 \n\nsetting where he could receive constitutionally adequate care. Reaves v. Dep’t of Correction, 392 \nF. Supp. 3d 195, 200, 210 (D. Mass. 2019). \n51.  On January 9, 2020, the Massachusetts Office of the State Auditor released a two-\nyear audit of the DOC medical care, finding failure to comply with authoritative guidance for \nsick call requests, doctors’ appointments, health insurance coverage, and medications during \nreentry preparation under normal operations.18 The State Auditor wrote: \nSick Call Request Forms (SCRFs) were not processed or triaged within 24 hours (72 on \nweekends) and/or were not completely filled out by nurses and/or physicians, and \ninmates were not always seen by a qualified healthcare professional (QHP) within seven \ndays after they submitted SCRFs. Without timely treatment for physical and mental \nhealth issues, an inmate’s condition could worsen. \n52.   About one-third of people whose records were audited were not seen within a \nweek. At a time of pandemic, these existing deficiencies are only likely to worsen as more \npeople become infected and need urgent, intensive care.  \n53.  Similar limitations plague county jails. An in-depth investigation published by \nWBUR in March found that those who “suffered from dire medical conditions in Massachusetts \ncounty jails [] were often ignored or mistrusted, with fatal consequences. The sheriffs and for-\nprofit companies increasingly responsible for [incarcerated people’s] health care face little \noversight, and often have withheld the circumstances of these deaths from the public—even from \n[incarcerated people’s] families.”19 \n \n18 Suzanne Bump, Office of the State Auditor, Massachusetts Department of Correction Official Audit Report, pp \n11-12 (Jan. 9, 2020), available at https://www.mass.gov/doc/audit-of-the-department-of-correction/download. \n19 Christine Willmsen & Beth Healy, Dying on the Sheriff’s Watch, WBUR 4-part audio series, available at \nhttps://www.wbur.org/investigations/2020/03/26/jail-lawsuits-sheriffs-watch. \n16 \n\nReducing the Prison Population Is the Only Meaningfully Means to Prevent the Harm \nCaused by COVID-19 in Prisons and Their Surrounding Communities \n54.  Courts, public health experts, and corrections professionals agree that a significant \ndecrease in the incarcerated population is essential to combat the spread of COVID-19 among \nprisoners, staff, and the greater community.  \n55.  Reducing the incarcerated populations serves four critical public health aims: (1) \ntargeting prisoners who are at elevated risk of suffering from severe symptoms of COVID-19; \n(2) allowing those who remain incarcerated to better maintain social distancing and avoid other \nrisks associated with forced communal living; (3) helping to “flatten the curve” of COVID-19 \ncases among incarcerated populations and limit the impact of transmission both inside \ncorrectional facilities and in the community; and (4) reducing the burden on the correctional \nsystem in terms of treating critically ill patients, as well as the burden on the community health \ncare system where they may have to be hospitalized. \n56.  In order to meaningfully decrease the risk of COVID-19 infections, Defendants \nmust act to reduce the prisoner population sufficiently to ensure social distancing and permit \npersonal hygiene in compliance with CDC guidelines.  \n57.  Other state systems and the federal system have recognized and acted upon the \nimmediate and pressing necessity of reducing prisoner populations in response to COVID-19. \n58.  On April 3, 2020, Attorney General William Barr issued a memorandum \naffirming the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ “profound obligation to protect the health and safety of \nall inmates,” and recognizing that, despite “extensive precautions to prevent COVID-19 from \nentering [BOP] facilities and infecting our inmates,” those measures “have not been perfectly \neffective.” Accordingly, he ordered the BOP to take more aggressive steps, immediately, to \n17 \n\ntransfer prisoners to home confinement, even if electronic monitoring will be not be available.20 \nThe BOP has now released over 1,100 prisoners to home confinement.  \n59.  In Colorado, Governor Polis issued an executive order that suspended the caps \nand criteria Colorado places on the accrual of good time credits in order to allow the DOC to \naward earned time credits. Additionally, the Colorado governor suspended and relaxed the \ncriteria for individuals to be released to Special Needs Parole, which is similar to medical parole \nin Massachusetts. \n60.  In California, Governor Newsom announced his plans to accelerate the release of \n3,500 people from state prisons in an effort to reduce the population as COVID-19 infections \nspread. \n61.  In Illinois, the Governor Pritzker took numerous actions to reduce the prison \npopulation, including: reviewing and granting commutation petitions; suspending the required \n14-day notification to the district attorney for inmates released early as a result of earned good \nconduct credits; suspending the 14-day limit for medical furloughs and allowing furloughs for \nmedical purposes; and creating a population management task force for the purpose of \nprioritizing the review of individuals for possible release through statutorily permissible means, \nsuch as awarding 180 days of earned discretionary credits, and electronic detention. Illinois also \nidentifies all prisoners within nine months of their release date and conducts individualized \nreviews to determine whether they are eligible for early release. \n62.  The Iowa Department of Corrections has announced that it is expediting the \nrelease of about 700 prisoners, or 7% of its population, who are approved for parole or work \nrelease. \n \n20 Memorandum from Attorney General William Barr to the Director of Bureau of Prisons (Apr. 3, 2020), available \nat https://www.justice.gov/file/1266661/download. \n18 \n\n63.   In New York, Governor Cuomo ordered the release of more than 1,000 people \nwho are in prisons and jails across the state on the basis of a parole violation. \n64.  The Vermont Department of Correction has worked to reduce its population by \nreleasing people on furlough and probation. \n65.  In California, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation released over \n3,500 prisoners by doing things like expedited parole for prisoners with 60 or fewer days left to \nserve on their sentences.  \n66.  Other states, like Oklahoma and Wisconsin, have taken steps to reduce the \npopulations in prisons by halting new admissions from county jails into state prison facilities. \n67.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”), at the direction of the Attorney General, \nhas released over 1,1000 prisoners to home confinement, increasing home confinement by over \n40%. The BOP has been “aggressively screen[ing] all potential inmates” for eligibility.  \n68.  Unlike other states, Massachusetts officials have failed to take action to effectuate \nthe release of prisoners despite their clear authority to do so. The Governor has refused to act on \nhis near plenary emergency powers when it comes to the health and safety of prisoners, publicly \nconfirming his intention to stick with a failing status quo. There have been no commutations, no \nfurloughs, no increase in earned good times, no releases by the DOC to home confinement, little \nif any increase in the use of medical parole, and no effort by the parole board to streamline the \nparole process or modify the criteria for release in light of COVID-19.  \n69.   Both the parole board and the DOC informed the SJC at oral argument in the \nCPCS case that they had made no changes to their ordinary release practices. At that time, the \nboard told the Court that there were over 300 prisoners whom it had already approved for parole \nbut who remained incarcerated. Despite the Court’s Order, which urged the DOC and the parole \n19 \n\nboard to work together to effectuate releases, the Special Master’s April 12 report discloses that \nthe board has only released 58 people on parole since the Order issued.  \n70.  The Defendants’ meager efforts are illustrated by the fact that the DOC \npopulation dropped by only 111 between April 5-13, while the jail and house of correction \npopulations actually increased by more than 600 people. And there is no evidence that either the \nparole board or the DOC has released anyone in this period who would not have been released \nanyway.  \nCivil Commitment under G.L. c. 123 § 35 to Correctional Facilities for Treatment of \nAlcohol and Substance Use Disorders Cannot Be Justified Because the Facilities Are \nUnsafe and Have Ceased to Offer the Requisite Treatment \n71.  G.L. c. 123, § 35 provides that if a court finds that a person has an alcohol or \nsubstance use disorder and there is a likelihood of serious harm as a result, the court may order \nsuch person to be committed for a period not to exceed 90 days. Such commitments “shall be for \nthe purpose of inpatient care for the treatment of an alcohol or substance use disorder in a facility \nlicensed or approved by the department of public health or the department of mental health.” Id. \n72.  If there are no beds available in a DPH licensed or approved facility, or “if the \ncourt makes a specific finding that the only appropriate setting for treatment for the person is a \nsecure facility,” men—but not women—can be placed in a correctional facility designated by the \ncommissioner of the DOC.  \n73.  The DOC houses Section 35 men at the Massachusetts Alcohol and Substance \nAbuse Center (“MASAC”), located at MCI Plymouth. The DOC has also entered into a \nMemorandum of Understanding with the Hampden County Sheriff’s Department to operate a \nSection 35 facility in the Hampden County Correctional Center.  \n74.  Every year, over 2,000 men are committed to correctional facilities under \nSection 35. As of March 30, 2020, there were 103 men civilly committed to MASAC and 79 \n20 \n\nmen civilly committed to Hampden County. Almost all were placed in a correctional institution \nonly because there was no room in a DPH-licensed treatment facility. \n75.  Section 35 commitments are controversial even in ordinary times, especially \ncommitments to correctional facilities. In 2017, the Legislature repealed the provisions in \nSection 35 that allowed women to be committed to a correctional facility. In 2019, the \ncommission established by the legislature to evaluate Section 35 recommended that the \n“Commonwealth should prohibit civilly-committed men from receiving treatment for addictions \nat any criminal justice facility.” 21 \n76.  On March 20, 2020, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration (“SAMHSA”)—the agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices that leads public health efforts to address mental health and substance use disorders—\nissued guidance on how to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. It says: “For those with \nsubstance use disorders, inpatient/residential treatment has not been shown to be superior to \nintensive outpatient treatment. Therefore, in these extraordinary times of risk of viral infection, it \nis recommended that intensive outpatient treatment services be utilized whenever possible.”22  \n77.  The DOC policy and the DPH regulations mandate that persons committed under \nSection 35 be offered a minimum of four hours of treatment every day.23 Nevertheless, in mid-\nMarch, MASAC cancelled all classes and reduced treatment to one group per day. In early April, \nthe entire facility was placed in lock-down, and even that one group per day was eliminated. \nIndividuals civilly committed to MASAC for treatment now receive no treatment at all.  \n \n21 Section 35 Commission Report (July 1, 2019) avaibable at https://www.mass.gov/doc/section-35-commission-\nreport-7-1-2019/download. \n22 SAMHSA, Considerations for the Care and Treatment of Mental and Substance Use Disorders in the COVID-19 \nEpidemic (March 20, 2020), available at https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/considerations-care-treatment-\nmental-substance-use-disorders-covid19.pdf. \n23 See 105 C.M.R. § 164.133 (D)(2). \n21 \n\n78.  After admission, MASAC patients are housed in the “C Dorm” for detoxification. \nMany describe this unit as filthy and stinking of the vomit, urine, and excrement of patients in \nthe throes of cold-turkey withdrawal. This is confirmed by DPH sanitation inspections that \ndescribe plumbing in poor repair, mold on the ceilings, scum on shower walls, a missing door on \na bathroom stall, and “generally dirty” conditions.24  \n79.  Beds in the medical section of C Dorm are close together, making social \ndistancing virtually impossible, and do not comply with DPH standards regarding the minimum \nfloor space for each occupant.  \n80.   Other MASAC detainees live in units where two patients are typically housed in \ncells that were designed for one person. These cells also fail to comply with DPH standards that \ncall for each cell or sleeping area to contain at least 60 square feet of floor space for each \noccupant. \n81.  Since the lockdown began, MASAC patients have been confined to their cells all \nday. They are allowed to leave only to use the bathroom, go to medication line, or use the \ntelephone. \n82.  Because the cells are so small, social distancing is impossible if the patient has a \ncellmate. There is only one bathroom for each unit, and patients must stand in line close to each \nother to receive medication. Most are taking some kind of medication. \n83.  There is no soap in the bathroom and no hand-sanitizer anywhere for detainees. \nThey must bring their own soap to the bathroom. Although most correctional officers and staff \nnow wear masks, the DOC has not provided patients with masks. \n \n24 Department of Public Health, Bureau of Environmental Health, Community Sanitation Program Report (February \n11, 2020), available at https://www.mass.gov/doc/massachusetts-alcohol-and-substance-abuse-center-masac-in-\nplymouth-january-30-2020/download.  \n22 \n\n84.   Concerns about the safety of Section 35 patients are heightened because the \naverage stay is only 30-40 days, and the rapid turnover of the population makes it impossible to \nadequately screen newly admitted residents. \n85.  The Mens’ Addiction Treatment Center (MATC)—the only DPH licensed Section \n35 facility for men—is operating at only 70% of capacity as the number of Section 35 \ncommitments drops, and treatment is still provided there. Section 35 provides that these beds \nmust be filled before a man may be civilly committed to a correctional facility. \n86.  Section 35 requires the superintendent to review the necessity of the commitment \nof all MASAC and Hampden patients after 30 days, and every 15 days thereafter until the \ncommitment expires. It also authorizes the superintendent to release a patient at any time if she \ndetermines that release will not result in the likelihood of serious harm. On information and \nbelief, the superintendent has not conducted a release review for any patient prior to the \nmandatory 30-day review since the COVID-19 emergency began. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n87.  This action is properly maintained as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 of the \nMassachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure. \n88.  The named Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of all prisoners who are \nincarcerated at prisons and jails in Massachusetts, including two subclasses: (1) All prisoners \nwho are at high risk for serious complication or death from COVID-19 due to underlying \nmedical condition or age (the “medically vulnerable subclass”); and (2) All prisoners civilly \ncommitted to a correctional facility under G.L. c. 123 §. 35 for treatment of an alcohol or \nsubstance use disorder (the “Section 35 subclass”). \n23 \n\n89.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. The \nmedically vulnerable subclass has thousands of members as almost 30 percent of the DOC \nprisoners are over age 50, while many others have serious medical conditions that make them \nparticularly vulnerable to COVID-19. There are currently more than 150 members of the \nSection 35 subclass at MASAC and the Hampden County Correctional Facility, and over 2,000 \nindividuals are committed to correctional facilities under Section 35 each year. \n90.  Defendants have acted or failed to act in a manner that is generally applicable to \neach member of the putative class, making class-wide injunctive and declaratory relief \nappropriate and necessary.  \n91.  The questions of law and fact raised by the named Plaintiffs are common to all \nmembers of the putative class. They include, but are not limited to: \n●  Whether Plaintiffs and the putative class face a substantial risk of serious harm \nfrom COVID-19 while incarcerated in a Massachusetts prison or jail; \n●  Whether Defendants have taken sufficient measures to abate the risk of serious \nharm to Plaintiffs and the putative class stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic; \n●  Whether Defendants have taken sufficient measures to reduce the incarcerated \npopulation to a level that will ensure Plaintiffs and the putative class do not face \nan unreasonable risk of harm as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; and \n●  Whether confining patients civilly committed for treatment of alcohol and \nsubstance use disorders under G.L. c. 123, § 35, under conditions that pose an \nunreasonable threat to their safety, and without affording them treatment for their \ndisorders, violates their right to substantive due process. \n24 \n\n92.  The legal violations alleged by the named Plaintiffs and the resultant harms are \ntypical of those raised by each member of the putative class. The named Plaintiffs will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the class. There is no conflict between the interests of the \nnamed Plaintiffs and the proposed class. \n93.  Plaintiffs’ counsel are competent and experienced in class action and complex \ncivil rights litigation and have committed sufficient resources to fully litigate this case through \ntrial and any appeals. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFirst Cause of Action  \nViolation of the Rights of Incarcerated Persons As Guaranteed by Articles 1, 10, 12, and 26 \nof the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights \n(Alleged by all Plaintiffs incarcerated at Massachusetts state prisons and County \ncorrectional facilities on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated)  \n94.  Plaintiffs incorporate the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully set \nforth herein. \n95.  By incarcerating Plaintiffs under conditions that put them in grave and imminent \ndanger of contracting the COVID-19 virus, and failing to implement an effective mechanism to \nreduce the incarcerated population to a safe level, Defendants are violating Plaintiffs’ rights to be \nfree from cruel or unusual punishment and rights to substantive due process, as guaranteed by \narticles 1, 10, 12, and 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, and secured by G.L. c. \n231A, § 2. \nSecond Cause of Action \nViolation of the Rights of Incarcerated Persons under the Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments of the U.S. Constitution \n25 \n\n (Alleged by all Plaintiffs incarcerated at Massachusetts state prisons and County \ncorrectional facilities on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated) \n96.  Plaintiffs incorporate the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully set \nforth herein. \n97.  By incarcerating Plaintiffs under conditions that put them in grave and imminent \ndanger of contracting the COVID-19 virus, and failing to implement an effective mechanism to \nreduce the incarcerated population to a safe level, Defendants are deliberately indifferent to the \nsubstantial risk of serious harm suffered by Plaintiffs in violation of their right to be free from \ncruel and unusual punishment and their right to substantive due process guaranteed by the Eighth \nand Fourteenth Amendments, as secured by 42. U.S.C. § 1983. \nThird Cause of Action \nViolation of the Rights of Persons Incarcerated under G.L. c. 123 § 35, under Substantive \nDue Process Provisions of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and the U.S. \nConstitution \n(Alleged by Plaintiff Santos on behalf of himself and the subclass of all persons civilly \ncommitted to correctional facilities under G.L. c. 123, § 35) \n98.  Plaintiffs incorporate the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully set \nforth herein. \n99.  Confining individuals civilly committed under G.L. c. 123, § 35 to correctional \nfacilities is a massive curtailment of their liberty. \n100.  Confining Section 35 patients in a correctional institution that poses a substantial \nrisk of harm to their health and safety is a substantial departure from accepted professional \njudgment, practice, or standards. \n26 \n\n101.  Confining Section 35 patients in an unsafe correctional institution that does not \noffer treatment for alcohol or substance use disorders is not reasonably related to the treatment \nand protective purposes of Section 35. \n102.  The incarceration of Plaintiff Santos and all others civilly committed to a \ncorrectional facility under Section 35 therefore violates the substantive due process provisions of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and Art. 1, 10, \nand 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, and G.L. c. 231A, § 2. \nPRAYERS FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court grant the following relief:  \nCertify a class of all prisoners who are incarcerated at prisons and jails in Massachusetts, \nincluding two subclasses: (1) All prisoners who are at high risk for serious complication or death \nfrom COVID-19 due to underlying medical condition or age, (“medically vulnerable subclass”); \nand (2) All prisoners civilly committed to a correctional facility under G.L. c. 123 §. 35 for the \npurpose of receiving treatment for an alcohol or substance use disorder, (“Section 35 subclass”). \n1.   For the duration of the COVID-19 emergency, enjoin the Defendants, their \nagents, officials, employees, and all persons acting in concert with them from: \na.  Housing any prisoner in any correctional facility where the population \nexceeds the Design/Rated capacity of that institution;  \nb.  Housing any prisoner in a cell, room, dorm, or other living area that does \nnot meet the minimum size standards established by the DPH in 105 CMR \n451.320-322; \nc.  Housing any prisoner in a cell, room, dorm, or other living area where \nthey must sleep, eat, or recreate within six feet of another person; \n27 \n\nd.  Maintaining any Medical or Health Services Unit, or medication \ndistribution area, in which prisoners must wait for or receive treatment or \nmedication within six feet of another person, other than their medical \nprovider; or \ne.  Transferring any prisoner from a county jail to the DOC. \n2.  Enjoin the Defendants, their agents, officials, employees, and all persons acting in \nconcert with them from confining in a correctional facility the Plaintiffs or any other person \ncivilly committed under G.L. c. 123 § 35. \n3.  Order the Defendants to immediately reduce the number of people confined in \nprisons and jails by at least a sufficient number to ensure compliance with the relief requested in \nNo. 2 above, prioritizing release for Plaintiffs in the medically vulnerable subclass. Mechanisms \nfor population reductions should include but not be limited to: \na.  Expanded use of home confinement; \nb.  Expanded use of furloughs, including allowing furloughs for longer than \nthe 14 days authorized by G.L. c. 127, § 90A; \nc.  Maximizing the award of good conduct deductions, including completion \ncredits and “boost time” under G.L. c. 127, § 129D, and authorizing the \naward of more such deductions than is permitted by § 129D; \nd.  Identifying all prisoners who may qualify for medical parole, under G.L. \nc. 127, § 90A, taking all necessary steps to ensure that a medical parole \npetition is filed immediately, and granting medical parole to those who \nqualify as quickly as possible and in no event more than one week after \nthe petition is filed; \n28 \n\ne.  Maximizing the use of commutation and clemency; and \nf.  Maximizing the use of the Governor’s emergency powers and all other \navailable mechanisms to grant releases to all those who are vulnerable to \nserious illness and death from COVID-19 due to age or underlying \nmedical condition, and all those who are within one year of release, unless \nthere is clear and convincing evidence that such release would pose a risk \nto public safety outweighing the public health risk of their continued \nincarceration. \n4.  Order the Parole Board to: \na.  Exercise its authority under G.L. c. 127, § 130, and 120 Code Mass. Regs. \n§ 200.10 (2017), to make all persons serving house of correction sentences \neligible for early parole; \nb.  Consider the dangers posed by COVID-19 when it evaluates whether \n“release is not incompatible with the welfare of society,” as required by \nG.L. c. 27, § 130; \nc.  Presumptively grant parole to all parole eligible individuals unless it \nmakes a determination based on clear and convincing evidence that the \nperson cannot live at liberty without violating the law; \nd.  Expedite the actual release of all individuals who have been granted parole \nor medical parole contingent on approval of a home plan or satisfaction of \nsome other condition; \ne.  Ensure that no prisoner is held beyond his “release to supervision date” \nunder G.L. c. 127, § 130B; and \n29 \n\nf.  Conduct parole hearings for all parole eligible prisoners no later than 60 \ndays prior to their parole eligibility date, as required by G.L.c. 127, § 136. \n5.  Appoint the Special Master from Comm. for Pub. Counsel Servs. et al. v. Chief \nJustice of the Trial Court et al., SJC-12926 to oversee compliance and implementation of the \nCourt’s orders in this case. \n6.  Award Plaintiffs their reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs; and  \n7.  Grant Plaintiffs such other and further relief as the Court considers just and \nproper. \n \nDated: April 17, 2020         Respectfully Submitted, \n \n/s/ Bonita P.

Commissioner of Correction (No. 1), 484 Mass., (2020) (Foster [No. 1]), we denied the plaintiffs'\nmotion for a preliminary injunction and transferred the case to the Superior Court for a final adjudication on\nthe merits. In this opinion, we address the motions brought by the Governor and the chair of the parole\nboard (parole board) to dismiss the claims against them. For the reasons that follow, we allow the\nGovernor's motion and we allow in part and deny in part the parole board's motion.\nDiscussion.\n1. Allegations of the complaint.\nIn deciding the motions to dismiss, we accept as true the factual allegations of the complaint and the\nreasonable inferences that can be drawn from those facts in the plaintiffs' favor. See Iannacchino v. Ford\nMotor Co., 451 Mass. 623, 625 n.7 (2008). We do not address, let alone attempt to resolve here, the truth of\nthose allegations; that is, whether in fact the conditions of confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic\ncomport with State and Federal constitutional requirements, and whether the defendants have in fact \"acted\nor failed to act with deliberate indifference.\" Foster (No. 1), 484 Mass. at. Instead, our narrow focus is on\nwhether the plaintiffs' complaint adequately \"state[s] a claim upon which relief can be granted\" against the\nGovernor and the parole board,\"[4] Mass. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974); in other words, whether\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14004772816233227838&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 1/5\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\nthe allegations, if true, plausibly suggest an entitlement to any relief against these defendants. Iannacchino,\nsupra at 635-636.\nThe complaint alleges that, by confining the plaintiffs \"under conditions that put them in grave and imminent\ndanger of contracting the COVID-19 virus, and failing to implement an effective mechanism to reduce the\nincarcerated population to a safe level, [the] [d]defendants are deliberately indifferent to the substantial risk\nof serious harm suffered by [the] [p]laintiffs.\" They allege that each of the defendants is (1) violating the\nplaintiffs' right to be free from cruel or unusual punishment and their right to substantive due process, as\nguaranteed under the Declaration of Rights in the Massachusetts Constitution, and as secured by G. L. c.\n231A (count one); and (2) violating their right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment and their right to\nsubstantive due process as guaranteed by the Federal Constitution, and as secured by 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n(count two). Additionally, the plaintiffs allege that confining persons who have been civilly committed under\nG.L. c. 123, § 35, in correctional facilities violates those individuals' rights to substantive due process under\nthe Federal and State Constitutions, as secured by 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and G. L. c. 231A, respectively (count\nthree).\nBy its terms, the complaint seeks injunctive relief pursuant to G. L. c. 231A and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. In\nparticular, it seeks an order requiring the defendants, \"their agents, officials, employees, and all persons\nacting in concert with them\" to confine prisoners in particular ways; requiring certain medical and health\narrangements; prohibiting the ongoing confinement in correctional facilities of persons civilly committed\nunder G. L. c. 123, § 35; reducing the number of persons incarcerated in prisons and jails; and mandating\nthat the parole board take certain actions. The complaint also seeks an order \"[m]aximizing the use of\ncommutation and clemency\" by the Governor and \"[m]aximizing the use of the Governor's emergency\npowers and all other available mechanisms to grant releases to all those who are vulnerable.\"\n2. Governor's motion to dismiss.\nAlthough the complaint broadly alleges that the defendants have violated the plaintiffs' State and Federal\nconstitutional rights, the specific allegations against the Governor are notably few. The complaint alleges\nthat the \"Governor has refused to act on his near plenary emergency powers when it comes to the health\nand safety of prisoners.\" The plaintiffs seek to compel the Governor to use his authority to order a reduction\nin the prison population, because, absent his exercise of authority, \"[t]here have been no commutations, no\nfurloughs, no increase in earned good times, no releases by the [Department of Correction] to home\nconfinement, little if any increase in the use of medical parole, and no effort by the parole board to\nstreamline the parole process or modify the criteria for release in light of COVID-19.\"\nThe plaintiffs are not entitled to relief against the Governor under the declaratory judgment statute, G. L. c.\n231A, because the statute, by its terms, expressly does \"not apply to the governor and council or the\nlegislative and judicial departments.\" G. L. c. 231A, § 2. See Milton v. Commonwealth, 416 Mass. 471, 475\n(1993); Alliance, AFSCME/SEIU, AFL-CIO v. Secretary of Admin., 413 Mass. 377, 377 n.1 (1992), and\ncases cited.\nNor is their position enhanced by invoking, as they do, the inherent power of this court \"to say what the\nConstitution requires, when the question is properly presented.\" Bates v. Director of the Office of Campaign\n& Political Fin., 436 Mass. 144, 168 (2002), quoting Horton v. Attorney Gen., 269 Mass. 503, 507 (1929),\nand citing Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). Had they alleged that the Governor\naffirmatively took action that was unconstitutional, or that anything he has done actually caused harm to the\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14004772816233227838&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 2/5\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\nplaintiffs from alleged constitutional violations, the situation may well be different. But they do not challenge\nanything the Governor has in fact done; they only complain of what they allege he could have done but did\nnot. And they certainly do not contend that the Governor had any direct, affirmative involvement in causing\nthe challenged prison conditions. See Hannon v. Beard, 979 F. Supp. 2d 136, 141-142 (D. Mass. 2013) (no\ndirect connection between prison conditions and Governor's actions), and cases cited. See also Brown v.\nRhode Island, 511 Fed. Appx. 4, 5 (1st Cir. 2013) (dismissing claims against Governor where plaintiff did not\nchallenge any affirmative acts of Governor). Moreover, the Governor cannot be found liable based on a\ntheory of respondeat superior or vicarious liability, that is, on the theory that he is legally responsible for the\nconduct of those he appointed to government service or to the agencies they lead. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\n556 U.S. 662, 676 (2009) (vicarious liability not applicable in such actions); Brown, supra (respondeat\nsuperior theory of liability not available in such circumstances).\nIn short, the complaint claims that the Governor is liable for things he has not done. First, it alleges that he\nis responsible for failing to reduce the prison population by failing to exercise his executive authority to\npardon and grant clemency. Second, it alleges that he has failed to exercise his emergency powers to\nmitigate the situation. These are not actionable claims. With respect to the first alleged failure to act, it is\nwell settled that the Governor's authority to grant pardons and other clemency is exclusively an executive\nauthority. See Part II, c. 2, § 1, art. 8, of the Massachusetts Constitution, as amended by art. 73 of the\nAmendments to the Massachusetts Constitution (\"The power of pardoning offences. . . shall be in the\ngovernor, by and with the advice of council . . .\"). This court cannot compel him to exercise it. See District\nAttorney for the Suffolk Dist. v. Watson, 381 Mass. 648, 667 n.10 (1980) (judicial branch cannot control\nexecutive clemency).\nWith respect to the second alleged failure to act, viz., the Governor's failure to utilize his emergency powers\nto mitigate the situation, this court should tread lightly in telling any Governor when or how to exercise his or\nher powers. It is one thing for a court to order a Governor to cease engaging in action the court has found to\nbe unconstitutional; it is quite another for a court affirmatively to direct a Governor how to act. For that\nreason, among others, this court historically has been unwilling to order a Governor to act where the relief\nsought, if deserved, can be provided by means of a court order against some defendant other than the\nGovernor. See Milton, 416 Mass. at 475-476; Rice v. Draper, 207 Mass. 577, 579 (1911). Cf. LIMITS v.\nPresident of the Senate, 414 Mass. 31, 34 (1992). If the plaintiffs in this case are indeed entitled to a\nremedy at the conclusion of the case, it can be provided by an appropriate order or orders directed to the\nother executive branch officials in the case. See Milton, supra. See also Barnes v. Secretary of Admin., 411\nMass. 822, 822 n.2 (1992). As stated, there is no claim that the Governor himself, by any affirmative act he\nhas taken, has \"overstepp[ed] constitutional bounds.\" Horton, 269 Mass. at 507. And we are confident, as\nthis court always has been, that any declaration that we or the Superior Court may ultimately issue requiring\naction by any of the remaining defendants will be met with prompt compliance. See LaChance v.\nCommissioner of Correction, 475 Mass. 757, 765 (2016), quoting Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless\nv.Secretary of Human Servs., 400 Mass. 806, 825 (1987) (where declaratory judgment is directed to public\nofficials, injunctive order is \"generally unnecessary\" because Massachusetts courts \"assume that public\nofficials will comply with the law declared by a court\"). The Governor's presence is simply not necessary to\nprovide any relief that a court may order in this case.\n3. Parole board's motion to dismiss.\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14004772816233227838&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 3/5\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\nThe plaintiffs allege in their complaint that the parole board has \"fail[ed] to implement an effective\nmechanism to reduce the incarcerated population to a safe level,\" and that there has been \"little if any\nincrease in the use of medical parole, and no effort by the parole board to streamline the parole process or\nmodify the criteria for release in light of COVID-19.\" The complaint in essence claims that the parole board\nis failing to take steps that it is empowered to take to protect the plaintiffs from COVID-19, and that its\ndeliberate indifference to the plaintiffs' plight creates \"a substantial risk of serious harm to [the plaintiffs']\nhealth or safety.\" Foster (No. 1), 484 Mass. at. Accordingly, the complaint seeks an order requiring the\nparole board to exercise its authority under G. L. c. 127, §§ 130 et seq., and 120 Code Mass. Regs. §\n200.10 (2017) to make persons serving house of correction sentences eligible for early parole; to consider\nthe dangers posed by COVID-19 when evaluating, as the statute requires it to do, whether \"release is not\nincompatible with the welfare of society\"; to presumptively grant parole to parole eligible individuals; to\nexpedite the release of individuals who have been granted parole or medical parole; to ensure no prisoner\nis held beyond his or her \"release to supervision date,\" see G. L. c. 127, § 130B; and to conduct parole\nhearings for parole eligible prisoners not later than sixty days prior to their parole eligibility date, as required\nby G. L. c. 127, § 136.[5]\nAccepting the allegations of the complaint as true, as we must in considering a motion to dismiss, we\nconclude that the plaintiffs have alleged facts which, if proved, are sufficient to state a constitutional claim\nthat the parole board was deliberately indifferent to the risk of death and serious illness to certain prisoners,\nparticularly elderly and medically vulnerable prisoners. See Iannacchino, 451 Mass. at 636. See also Good\nv.Commissioner of Correction, 417 Mass. 329, 334 (1994) (Commissioner of Correction proper party\ndefendant where he had \"ability to prevent harm\"). The complaint alleges that the parole board has\nauthority to implement effective measures to reduce the incarcerated population by, for example, expediting\nparole hearings and releases and, perhaps, considering the impact of COVID-19 as part of its assessment.\nIf, as the plaintiffs contend, the parole board has been deliberately indifferent in its exposure of the\nprisoners to \"unreasonable risks from the COVID-19 pandemic,\" Foster (No. 1), 484 Mass. at, then the\nparole board's failure to act within, and to the extent of, its authority may, if such deliberate indifference is\nproved, entitle the plaintiffs to relief.\nWe recognize that the scope of the parole board's authority is defined by statute, see G. L. c. 27, § 4, and\nG.L. c. 127, §§ 130 et seq., and that \"the court's equitable powers may not be used to provide relief that is\ncontrary to statutory or constitutional requirements.\" McCarthy v. Governor, 471 Mass. 1008, 1010-1011\n(2015), citing Haverty v. Commissioner of Correction, 440 Mass. 1, 8 (2003). See Immigration &\nNaturalization Serv. v. Pangilinan, 486 U.S. 875, 883 (1988) (\"Courts of equity can no more disregard\nstatutory and constitutional requirements and provisions than can courts of law\" [citation omitted]).

I have worked for the Massachusetts Department of \nCorrection (Department) since 1987. The statements in this affidavit are based upon my \nown personal knowledge, my discussions conducted in the course of my professional \nduties, and my review of records maintained in the usual course of the Department.  \n2.  As Commissioner, I am responsible for administration of all state correctional facilities. \nM.G.L. c. 124, § 1. \n3.  The COVID-19 virus pandemic is affecting all levels of government. Here at the \nDepartment, our primary focus during this pandemic has been on the health and safety of \ninmates and staff.  \n4.  The Department, utilizing external and internal regulation and policy enforcement bodies, \nprovides a safe and hygienic environment for both staff and incarcerated offenders.  \n\n2 \n \n5.  As detailed more fully below, by utilizing the following agencies, units and staff \nmembers, the Department ensures that its diverse infrastructure and facilities are \nmaintained in such a manner as to provide a high standard of quality of life for \nincarcerated offenders and working conditions for its staff members. \n6.   The Department’s COVID-19 plans and procedures are frequently reviewed and updated \nto reflect the continual changes in this public health emergency situation. \n7.  The correctional institutions in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are subject to \nexternal and internal regulations that govern sanitation and hygiene.   \n8.  Externally, the Department of Public Health (DPH) inspects Department of Correction \nfacilities twice per year.   \n9.  These comprehensive DPH inspections are conducted by sanitation code compliance \nexperts. 105 CMR 451.   \n10. 105 CMR 451 contains standards for diverse operations such as food services, \nhousekeeping, living area requirements, washroom minimum requirements, etc.  \n11. At the conclusion of these inspections, each institution must submit a plan of corrective \naction addressing each deficiency cited in the inspection report.   \n12. These plans of action are submitted to DPH for review and acceptance.   \n13. Certain DPH regulations are recommendations and not requirements. Among these is 105 \nCMR 451.320, Cell Size: Existing Facilities, which suggests, but does not require, that \neach inmate cell be at least 60 square feet. \n14. In addition to the external inspections, each institution is required to have a trained \nenvironmental health and safety officer (EHSO).   \n\n3 \n \n15. Department policy requires that these officers conduct a comprehensive monthly \ninspection of the entire institution to identify and address sanitation and hygiene \nconcerns.   \n16. These officers are also tasked with training other institution staff members to conduct \nrequired weekly sanitation and hygiene inspections throughout the entire institution.   \n17. The Department conducts a comprehensive training course for all new EHSOs. \n18. Upon the declaration of a State of Emergency by Governor Baker on March 10, 2020, the \nDepartment began implementing its COVID-19 epidemic control plans. \n19. The Department also used the Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease \n2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities, issued by the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) on March 23, 2020 and March 30, 2020, as a \nguide to implementing procedures for preventing the spread of the virus in its \ncorrectional facilities. Exhibit 1. \n20. The Department had already implemented most of the recommendations contained in the \nInterim Guidance.  The Department has continued to adjust its operations during the \npandemic. Working with its medical providers, the Department has closely followed \nCDC recommendations, and adapted new procedures as needed. \n21. Since March 12, 2020, inmates and staff have received several directives regarding \nCOVID-19 and efforts to prevent its spread. \n22. On March 12, 2020, I issued an advisory to employees describing the coronavirus’s \nsymptoms, and who was most at risk of exposure. The advisory also provided the \nnecessary steps to be taken to prevent infection by the virus, as detailed by the CDC and \nthe Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH). Exhibit 2. \n\n4 \n \n23. On March 13, 2020, I issued a COVID-19 preparedness advisory (in English and \nSpanish) to all inmates and patients. The advisory assured them that all necessary steps \nwere being taken to provide them with a safe, secure environment. Among the \ninformation given to inmates and patients: the importance of frequent hand washing, \nsocial distancing, use of soaps and cleaning supplies, availability of additional \ninformation about the virus, additional cleaning plans, and access to medical providers. \nExhibit 3. \n24. On March 20, 2020, I issued a COVID-19 update (in English and Spanish) to all inmates \nand patients.  This update informed inmates that they would be provided two free 30-\nminute phone calls a week, that phone privileges for inmates serving a loss-of-phone \nsanction would be restored, that all medical co-pays were waived, the importance of \nsocial distancing, and letting them know that mental health services, as always, were \navailable to them. Exhibit 4. \n25. Also on March 20, 2020, I issued an update to all staff.  Among the steps taken by the \nDepartment to assist staff:  screening of all staff prior to entry in accordance with \nCDC/DPH guidelines; limiting of inmate transports and transports between facilities; \nauthorizing staff in areas with high risk of infection to wear personal protective \nequipment (PPE), based on specific evaluations of need; working with individual \nfacilities to ensure sufficient infectious disease plans are in place; upgraded \ncleaning/disinfection protocols; determining what staff might telecommute; and allowing \nstaff to bring in their own disinfecting wipes. The March 20, 2020 update also included \nflyers illustrating the CDC’s recommended infection control procedures and the proper \nuse of PPE. Exhibit 5. \n\n5 \n \n26. On March 27, 2020, I issued an updated memo (in English and Spanish) to patients, \nsupplementing my March 20, 2020 memo, informing them that: all staff are required to \nwear masks; PPE would be provided to inmates at the Massachusetts Treatment Center \n(MTC) working in infected areas; all persons entering DOC facilities would be screened \nfor health, including self-administered temperature checks; hand sanitizer would now be \nalcohol based; and attorney visits would continue; inmate transfers and releases would \ncontinue. Exhibit 6. \n27. Also on March 27, 2020, I issued an update to DOC staff regarding efforts to prevent the \nvirus. Among the steps: delivery of multiple gallons of hand sanitizer to all facilities; \nscreening tents being set up at most facilities; requirement that all staff wear masks while \nin areas where inmates are active; requirement that all staff take their own temperature \nbefore entering a facility; limiting inmate transportation details; upgrading of cleaning \nplans; and allowing staff to bring their own disinfectant wipes. Exhibit 7. \n28. On April 3, 2020, I issued another memo to inmates regarding a 14-day lockdown as a \nsafety precaution. Inmates were reminded that they should reach out to health \nprofessionals if they showed and COVID symptoms. Exhibit 8. \n29. On April 3, 2020, I issued a poster for staff outlining all the precautions that had been \ntaken to date to protect them and inmates at all facilities. This included PPE distribution, \nN95 respirators for security staff, screening tents outside each facility, and access to hand \nsanitizer. It also explained staff requirements such as wearing masks and self-\nadministered temperature testing. Exhibit 9. \n\n6 \n \n30. On April 10, 2020, I issued an information sheet in English and Spanish updating inmates \nand patients on COVID-19 prevention, including hand-washing, the availability of soap \nand hand sanitizer, and social distancing. Exhibit 10. \n31. In addition to the Department-wide memoranda and flyers, I also issued facility specific \nmemos to inmates and staff indicating the precautions being taken at each facility.  \n32. On April 1, 2020, in response to an inmate testing positive at MCI-Shirley, I informed \ninmates that the facility would be locked down for 14 days to prevent the spread of the \nvirus. The inmate testing positive, who contracted the virus while at an outside hospital, \nwas placed in quarantine. The inmates were informed that food and medicine would be \nprovided in housing units, showers and telephone use would be provided, and laundry, \nmail, and other services would not be interrupted. Additionally, I also reminded inmates \nof ways to prevent the virus, such as handwashing and social distancing. Exhibit 11. \n33. On April 4, 2020, I issued a memo to patients and persons served at Bridgewater State \nHospital (BSH) that movement would be restricted for 14 days to slow the spread of the \nvirus and prevent infection. Patients were also reminded to wash their hands frequently \nand to keep their living areas clean and sanitary. Exhibit 12. \n34. On April 3, 2020, Secretary of Public Safety Thomas Turco informed DOC staff that \npriority COVID-19 testing would begin on April 5, 2020 for correction officers who were \nexperiencing one or more specific symptoms of the virus. Exhibit 13. \n35. On April 7, 2020, Secretary Turco notified DOC staff that testing sites would assist \ncorrection officers, regardless of whether they had symptoms of COVID. Exhibit 14. \n36. On April 22, 2020, all inmates at MCI-Framingham and South Middlesex Correctional \nCenter were offered voluntary COVID-19 testing via mobile testing. Of the 191 inmates \n\n7 \n \nat MCI-Framingham, 123 agreed to be tested. At South Middlesex Correctional Center, \n46 of 52 inmates agreed to be tested. \n37. On April 24, I issued a memo to staff, alerting them that, beginning April 25, 2020, \nmobile testing sites are being set up at MCI-Shirley and then the Massachusetts \nTreatment Center. Voluntary testing will be available for all staff and inmates. Exhibit \n15. \n38. As of April 23, 2020, 136 inmates and 72 staff across 16 DOC facilities have tested \npositive for the virus. \n39. As of April 23, 2020, of those who contracted the virus, 10 inmates and 17 staff have \nrecovered.  \n40. Should additional inmates test positive, DOC has plans in place to designate additional \nareas for quarantine and isolation purposes. \n41. Additionally, the Department delivered a shipment of surgical masks to all \nsuperintendents this afternoon for distribution to the inmate/civil populations.  Each \ninmate/civil commitment will receive a mask. The receiving facilities (MCI Cedar \nJunction, MCI Framingham, and MASAC) will receive an additional 100 masks, each of \nwhich is intended to be used for any new admissions going forward. \nCOVID Prevention and Inmate Care \n42. Under procedures enacted in response to COVID-19, all persons entering a correctional \nfacility—whether employee, vendor, contractor, or attorney—must successfully pass an \nenhanced entrance screening prior to access being granted. Exhibit 7. \n\n8 \n \n43. Each facility has reduced access points to one Single Point of Entry (SPE).  The National \nGuard has assisted the Department at the SPEs by setting up tents, generators, lighting, \nand heaters to run the SPE. Exhibit 7. \n44. At the SPE, a staff member and a manager are assigned to supervise an entrance \nscreening of every individual seeking entrance into the facility.  \n45. Staff members assigned to the SPE are clothed in PPE consisting of gloves and a mask. \n46. Screening is based on CDC/DPH recommendations, and consists of a series of health-\nrelated questions and a self-administered non-intrusive temperature check for fever \nconducted by the employee, visitor, or vendor. Exhibit 16. \n47. Each person entering is required to fill out the questionnaire and a thermometer is \navailable for each employee to take their own temperature. The thermometer is \ndisinfected between each use. Exhibit 16. \n48. Completed questionnaires are handed to the on-site manager and upon review, the \nmanager makes the final determination to approve/deny the person entrance.  \n49. No person with a temperature reading above 99.9 degrees Fahrenheit is permitted to enter \nthe facility. Any person denied entrance is advised to consult with a medical professional. \nExhibit 16. \n50. All correctional and medical staff are wearing appropriate PPEs. Masks are mandatory \nfor all staff working in facilities. Supervisors and security personnel are monitoring PPE \nuse to ensure compliance by all staff. Visitors are also required to wear masks. \n51. All non-attorney visits were suspended, to prevent visitors from introducing COVID-19 \ninto the facilities. See Mass.gov/DOC. \n\n9 \n \n52. Due to COVID-19, all new inmate admissions are being quarantined for 14 days as a \nprecaution. \n53. Inmates suspected of COVID-19 infection are quarantined away from the general \npopulation, meaning they are placed in a separate housing unit set aside only for inmates \nwho have tested positive or who are suspected of having the virus. \n54. Inmates testing positive for COVID-19 are being housed away from uninfected inmates. \n55. Units housing COVID-19-positive inmates are quarantined. \n56. To the extent possible in correctional facilities, the Department is meeting its \nresponsibility to enable social distancing. In addition to the memos issued to inmates and \nstaff, I have discussed social distancing with the Assistant Deputy Commissioners of the \nnorth and south sectors, and issued a directive that superintendents were to remind \ninmates to socially distance from one another. \n57. Inmates in two-person cells are sleeping head to foot to limit exposure to one another, per \nCDC guidelines. \n58. Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is available for staff and inmates. Facilities receive regular \ndeliveries of hand sanitizer. \n59. Inmates are being served their meals in their cells to avoid gathering them in inmate \ndining halls. \n60. Medication lines have largely been eliminated. At most facilities, all medications are \nbeing provided either in cell or on a one-person-at-a-time basis in a common area. \nInmates must wear masks and stand at least six feet away from each other. All medical \nstaff wear appropriate PPE when interacting with others, as recommended by the CDC \nand other health officials. Exhibit 17.  \n\n10 \n \n61. Inmates requiring insulin are either injected by medical staff in their cells or individually \nin a private, secure area. Medical personnel change their gloves before injecting each \ninmate. \n62. Inmates continue to have access to timely, appropriate medical care, and may request to \nsee medical professionals at any time. The same is true of inmates’ mental health needs. \nInmates are frequently reminded that mental health care is available to them. \n63. Prison recreation areas, such as gymnasiums, have been closed to prevent close contact \nbetween groups of inmates. \n64. Wellpath providers are closely following CDC and DPH protocols for the prevention and \ntreatment of COVID-19. Exhibit 17. \n65. This includes procedures for PPE use, triage and quarantine for inmates who may have \ncontracted the virus, protection for health care and correction staff, and techniques for \npreventing COVID’s spread. Exhibit 17. \n66. These procedures include detailed instructions for health care providers regarding the \nproper way to use masks and gloves, and how to avoid potential contact with COVID-\ninfected areas. Exhibit 17. \n67. Based on its own testing and observations, Wellpath’s guidelines for returning potentially \nCOVID-positive inmates to general population are more stringent than those \nrecommended by the CDC. Exhibit 18. \n68. The CDC suggests that a person who shows no symptoms after 72 hours may be returned \nto population; Wellpath has determined that it will not return an inmate until 7 days after \nthey are asymptomatic. Exhibit 18. \n\n11 \n \n69. The mental health of quarantined inmates is a concern for both DOC and Wellpath, and \nprotocols have been initiated to ensure inmates receive optimum mental health care, as \nneeded, while quarantined. \n70. When an inmate is quarantined due to either testing positive or pending test results for the \nCoronavirus, the medical or mental health team leader immediately notifies the mental \nhealth director (MHD) or his or her designee. Exhibit 19. DPH is also notified. \n71. The MHD or designee conducts a chart review of the inmate, including whenever \npossible a triage with the inmate’s direct providers (e.g., primary care provider, assigned \npsychiatrist, medical staff who have interacted with the patient most recently, etc.) to \nestablish/update working knowledge of their diagnosis, risk factors, likelihood of \naccessing mental health if needed, and current mental status. Exhibit 20. \n72. Based on a triage with the MHD (or designated mental health leader), mental health staff \ndetermines whether an inmate needs an emergent mental health assessment. If the \ndetermination is indeed that this inmate needs to be seen emergently by mental health, \nmental health staff will provide an assessment, carefully observing safety protocols. \nExhibit 20. \n73. The on-site mental health department continues to monitor these inmates over the course \nof their quarantine/illness to provide ongoing clinical consultation and assessment for \nthem. For some inmates, the determination may be that they need more frequent \nevaluation while for others the determination may be that they can be seen per typical \ncrisis protocols until normal mental health operations resume. Exhibit 20. \n \n \n\n12 \n \nCleaning and Disinfection of Facilities \n74. Frequent cleaning of areas accessible to inmates and staff is among the most important \ndefenses against COVID-19, according to the CDC. \n75. As a primary mechanism to ensure sanitation, each correctional facility is required by \nDepartment policy to create a housekeeping schedule. \n76. These housekeeping plans outline cleaning schedules for all areas, instructions on proper \ncleaning, and specific assignments and duties.  \n77. Per the CDC recommendations, ongoing cleaning is happening at all facilities, with \ninmates and staff ensuring, as much as practicable, that sufficient amounts of bleach and \nother cleaners are used to kill the virus and prevent its spread.  \n78. Inmate showers, restrooms, and sinks are kept clean and sanitary. Each facility has \nimplemented protocols for frequent cleaning and disinfecting, during the day and after \nhours.  \n79. Additionally, at all facilities, inmate common areas and high-touch areas are frequently \ncleaned and disinfected with bleach and disinfectants. Facility staff is using sprayers to \nensure large areas are regularly disinfected, and Kaivac machines with high-powered \nsprays and disinfectants are used multiple times a week. \n80. At all facilities, high-touch areas are sprayed daily with disinfectant and correction \nofficers disinfect high-touch surfaces in the living units. \n81. Cleaning supplies are readily available to inmates daily for use in their cells. \n82. Cleaning supplies are available in all inmate restrooms and shower facilities, for inmates \nto use in cleaning after each use. Inmate workers are disinfecting showers and bathrooms \nevery evening. \n\n13 \n \n83. Inmates are required to clean phones with provided disinfectant before and after each use. \n84. Inmates are also being provided with bar soap, and are being told that they may request \nadditional soap as needed. Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is readily available to inmates \nand staff in all areas of the facilities. \nMASAC and Hampden County Treatment Facilities \n85. The Massachusetts Alcohol and Substance Abuse Center in Plymouth (MASAC), \nMassachusetts is operated by the Department of Correction.  It is a secure facility that \nhouses men civilly committed pursuant to G.L. c. 123, § 35 due their substance use \ndisorder. The Department of Correction has entered into a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding with the Hampden County Sheriff’s Department to treat and house \nSection 35 commitments from the counties of Hampden, Hampshire, Franklin, Berkshire \nand Worcester in two facilities operated by the Hampden County Sheriff, Stonybrook \nSpringfield and Stonybrook Ludlow (Hampden).  In 2019, the number of Section 35 \ncommitments to MASAC at Plymouth and Hampden totaled 1643.  \n86. Although the census at MASAC and Hampden was respectively 159 patients and 108 \npatients on March 13, 2020, as of April 23, 2020 there are 28 committed patients at \nMASAC, an 82 percent decline, and 46 committed patients at Hampden, a 57.5 percent \ndecline. Since March 13, 2020, there have been 14 new admissions to MASAC and 31 \nnew admissions to Hampden.  The courts, not the Department of Correction, determine \nthe secure facility to which a person is committed with the assistance of expert testimony. \n87. As of April 23, 2020, with unlimited testing capacity, no patient has had a positive test \nresult for COVID-19 at either MASAC or Hampden. \n \n\n14 \n \n88. Patients on each unit continue to have access to substance abuse groups, activity groups, \nand open recreation activities on a rotating basis. \n89. On March 30, 2020, the size of group programs was reduced to 15 patients per group to \nallow for social distancing.  This required a temporary reduction in structured substance \nabuse groups to two per day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.  In addition, \npatients were provided with homework and individual sessions with Substance Abuse \nCounselors or Mental Health Professionals.   \n90. Patients are seen individually on a daily basis by Substance Abuse Counselors and are \nroutinely seen by Mental Health Professionals as all patients are viewed as open mental \nhealth cases.  \n91.  During these sessions treatment materials are reviewed, reentry plans developed, and \ncoping skills learned.  \n92.  During the week of March 30 through April 3, 2020, patients had the opportunity to \nparticipate in a minimum of five hours of treatment each day. \n93. For a three-day period during the weekend of April 4 through April 6, 2020 there were no \ngroups held as a Department-wide lockdown took effect and a new operational plan was \ndeveloped.   \n94. On April 7, 2020, the size of group programs was further reduced to 10 patients.  That \nsame day group activity was restricted so that patients from different housing units did \nnot attend groups together to further reduce the risk of virus spread. \n95. The census continued to decrease, and as of approximately April 15, 2020, each patient \nwas able to attend four structured groups instead of two per day.  Patients continue to be \n\n15 \n \nprovided with homework packets containing materials related to substance use treatment, \nmental health, and wellness.   \n96. In addition to structured groups, daily individual appointments with Substance Use \nCounselors and routine sessions with Mental Health Professionals are provided.  \nIncluding all of these modalities, the current total treatment time provided per patient is \nseven hours per day. \n97. The Superintendent of MASAC monitors patient participation in groups and, based upon \nthe satisfactory completion of programming, as recommended by clinical staff, an \nadequate discharge plan determines whether a patient meets the criteria for release. \n98. Most civil commitments are currently released around the thirty day point of their \ncommitment. \n99. All correction officers will be removed from MASAC on May 10, 2020. \nMedical Parole \n100.  G.L. c. 127, § 119A permits inmates who are “terminally ill or permanently \nincapacitated” to petition for release from custody on medical parole. Per the statute, “[i]f \nthe commissioner determines that a prisoner is terminally ill or permanently incapacitated \nsuch that if the prisoner is released the prisoner will live and remain at liberty without \nviolating the law and that the release will not be incompatible with the welfare of society, \nthe prisoner shall be released on medical parole.” G.L. c. 127, § 119A(e). Exhibit 21. \n101. Upon receipt of a medical parole petition, the superintendent completes a public safety \nrisk assessment by reviewing the inmate’s file for criminal and institutional history, \nincluding circumstances of the crime, disciplinary and classification reports, and the \ninmate’s participation in education, work and recommended programming. At the same \n\n16 \n \ntime, the Department’s contracted medical provider, Wellpath, is asked to provide an \nupdated clinical review as to the inmate’s medical condition. \n102.  The medical parole statute contains definite timelines: the superintendent must issue a \nrecommendation to me “not more than 21 days after receipt of the petition” and “[t]he \ncommissioner shall issue a written decision not later than 45 days after receipt of a \npetition” (italics added). Exhibit 21.4 \n103.  These timelines only represent the outer limit of what is permitted; there is nothing \npreventing superintendents from exercising their discretion and making recommendations \nin less than 21 days; nor am I prohibited from rendering my decision in less than 45 days. \nDepartment staff typically expedites decisions on medical parole petitions if the inmate’s \ncondition is significantly dire.  \n104.  Pursuant to the statute, petitioner’s victims and District Attorney (DA) offices have the \nright to submit written statements or, where a murderer is under consideration, request a \nhearing. \n105.  In order to expedite the process, I am requiring victims and DAs’ offices wishing to \nsubmit statements for or against the medical parole, or to request a hearing, to respond \nwithin five business days of notification that the petition is under consideration. Since \nMarch 10, 2020, I have granted nine inmate petitions for medical parole. Of these, seven \ninmates have been released and two more are awaiting community placement. \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nSupreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth    Full Court:   SJC-12935      Filed: 4/24/2020 7:32 PM\nInterim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease \n2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities \nThis interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the transmission and severity of corona-\nvirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as of March 23, 2020. \nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this guidance as needed and as \nadditional information becomes available. Please check the following CDC website periodically for updated \ninterim guidance: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html.\nThis document provides interim guidance specific for correctional facilities and detention centers during the \noutbreak of COVID-19, to ensure continuation of essential public services and protection of the health and \nsafety of incarcerated and detained persons, staff, and visitors. Recommendations may need to be revised as \nmore information becomes available.\nWho is the intended audience \nIn this guidance\nfor this guidance?\n• Who is the intended audience for this \nThis document is intended to \nguidance?\nprovide guiding principles for \n• Why is this guidance being issued? healthcare and non-healthcare \nadministrators of correctional \n• What topics does this guidance \nand detention facilities \ninclude?\n(including but not limited \n• Definitions of Commonly Used Terms\nto federal and state prisons, \n• Facilities with Limited Onsite  local jails, and detention centers), \nlaw enforcement agencies that \nHealthcare Services\nhave custodial authority for detained populations (i.e., US \n• COVID-19 Guidance for Correctional \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement and US Marshals \nFacilities\nService), and their respective health departments, to assist in \n• Operational Preparedness preparing for potential introduction, spread, and mitigation \nof COVID-19 in their facilities.

The integration of these components presents \nunique challenges for control of COVID-19 transmission among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, and \nvisitors. Consistent application of specific preparation, prevention, and management measures can help \nreduce the risk of transmission and severe disease from COVID-19.\n• Incarcerated/detained persons live, work, eat, study, and recreate within congregate environments, \nheightening the potential for COVID-19 to spread once introduced.\n• In most cases, incarcerated/detained persons are not permitted to leave the facility.\n• There are many opportunities for COVID-19 to be introduced into a correctional or detention facility, \nincluding daily staff ingress and egress; transfer of incarcerated/detained persons between facilities and \nsystems, to court appearances, and to outside medical visits; and visits from family, legal representatives, \nand other community members. Some settings, particularly jails and detention centers, have high turnover, \nadmitting new entrants daily who may have been exposed to COVID-19 in the surrounding community or \nother regions.\n• Persons incarcerated/detained in a particular facility often come from a variety of locations, increasing the \npotential to introduce COVID-19 from different geographic areas.\n• Options for medical isolation of COVID-19 cases are limited and vary depending on the type and size of \nfacility, as well as the current level of available capacity, which is partly based on medical isolation needs for \nother conditions. \n• Adequate levels of custody and healthcare staffing must be maintained to ensure safe operation of the \nfacility, and options to practice social distancing through work alternatives such as working from home or \nreduced/alternate schedules are limited for many staff roles. \n• Correctional and detention facilities can be complex, multi-employer settings that include government \nand private employers. Each is organizationally distinct and responsible for its own operational, personnel, \nand occupational health protocols and may be prohibited from issuing guidance or providing services to \nother employers or their staff within the same setting. Similarly, correctional and detention facilities may \nhouse individuals from multiple law enforcement agencies or jurisdictions subject to different policies and \nprocedures.\n• Incarcerated/detained persons and staff may have medical conditions that increase their risk of severe \ndisease from COVID-19. \n• Because limited outside information is available to many incarcerated/detained persons, unease and \nmisinformation regarding the potential for COVID-19 spread may be high, potentially creating security and \nmorale challenges. \n• The ability of incarcerated/detained persons to exercise disease prevention measures (e.g., frequent \nhandwashing) may be limited and is determined by the supplies provided in the facility and by security \nconsiderations. Many facilities restrict access to soap and paper towels and prohibit alcohol-based hand \nsanitizer and many disinfectants.\n• Incarcerated persons may hesitate to report symptoms of COVID-19 or seek medical care due to co-pay \nrequirements and fear of isolation. \nCDC has issued separate COVID-19 guidance addressing healthcare infection control and clinical care of \nCOVID-19 cases as well as close contacts of cases in community-based settings. Where relevant, commu-\nnity-focused guidance documents are referenced in this document and should be monitored regularly for \nupdates, but they may require adaptation for correctional and detention settings.\nExhibit 1.2\n2\n\nThis guidance document provides additional recommended best practices specifically for correctional and \ndetention facilities. At this time, different facility types (e.g., prison vs. jail) and sizes are not differ-\nentiated. Administrators and agencies should adapt these guiding principles to the specific needs \nof their facility.\nWhat topics does this guidance include?\nThe guidance below includes detailed recommendations on the following topics related to COVID-19 in correc-\ntional and detention settings:\n√  Operational and communications preparations for COVID-19\n√  Enhanced cleaning/disinfecting and hygiene practices\n√  Social distancing strategies to increase space between individuals in the facility \n√  How to limit transmission from visitors\n√  Infection control, including recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) and potential alternatives \nduring PPE shortages\n√  Verbal screening and temperature check protocols for incoming incarcerated/detained individuals, staff, \nand visitors\n√  Medical isolation of confirmed and suspected cases and quarantine of contacts, including considerations \nfor cohorting when individual spaces are limited\n√  Healthcare evaluation for suspected cases, including testing for COVID-19\n√  Clinical care for confirmed and suspected cases\n√  Considerations for persons at higher risk of severe disease from COVID-19\nDefinitions of Commonly Used Terms\nClose contact of a COVID-19 case—In the context of COVID-19, an individual is considered a close contact \nif they a) have been within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time or b) \nhave had direct contact with infectious secretions from a COVID-19 case (e.g., have been coughed on). Close \ncontact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a common space with a COVID-19 case. \nData to inform the definition of close contact are limited. Considerations when assessing close contact include \nthe duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms \nof the person with COVID-19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk, as does exposure to a severely ill \npatient).\nCohorting—Cohorting refers to the practice of isolating multiple laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases \ntogether as a group, or quarantining close contacts of a particular case together as a group. Ideally, cases \nshould be isolated individually, and close contacts should be quarantined individually. However, some \ncorrectional facilities and detention centers do not have enough individual cells to do so and must consider \ncohorting as an alternative. See Quarantine and Medical Isolation sections below for specific details about \nways to implement cohorting to minimize the risk of disease spread and adverse health outcomes.\nCommunity transmission of COVID-19—Community transmission of COVID-19 occurs when individuals \nacquire the disease through contact with someone in their local community, rather than through travel to an \naffected location. Once community transmission is identified in a particular area, correctional facilities and \ndetention centers are more likely to start seeing cases inside their walls. Facilities should consult with local \npublic health departments if assistance is needed in determining how to define “local community” in the \ncontext of COVID-19 spread. However, because all states have reported cases, all facilities should be vigilant \nfor introduction into their populations.\nExhibit 1.3\n3\n\nConfirmed vs. Suspected COVID-19 case—A confirmed case has received a positive result from a COVID-19 \nlaboratory test, with or without symptoms. A suspected case shows symptoms of COVID-19 but either has not \nbeen tested or is awaiting test results. If test results are positive, a suspected case becomes a confirmed case.\nIncarcerated/detained persons—For the purpose of this document, “incarcerated/detained persons” \nrefers to persons held in a prison, jail, detention center, or other custodial setting where these guidelines are \ngenerally applicable. The term includes those who have been sentenced (i.e., in prisons) as well as those held \nfor pre-trial (i.e., jails) or civil purposes (i.e, detention centers). Although this guidance does not specifically \nreference individuals in every type of custodial setting (e.g., juvenile facilities, community confinement facil-\nities), facility administrators can adapt this guidance to apply to their specific circumstances as needed. \nMedical Isolation—Medical isolation refers to confining a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case (ideally \nto a single cell with solid walls and a solid door that closes), to prevent contact with others and to reduce the \nrisk of transmission. Medical isolation ends when the individual meets pre-established clinical and/or testing \ncriteria for release from isolation, in consultation with clinical providers and public health officials (detailed \nin guidance below). In this context, isolation does NOT refer to punitive isolation for behavioral infractions \nwithin the custodial setting. Staff are encouraged to use the term “medical isolation” to avoid confusion.\nQuarantine—Quarantine refers to the practice of confining individuals who have had close contact with \na COVID-19 case to determine whether they develop symptoms of the disease. Quarantine for COVID-19 \nshould last for a period of 14 days. Ideally, each quarantined individual would be quarantined in a single cell \nwith solid walls and a solid door that closes. If symptoms develop during the 14-day period, the individual \nshould be placed under medical isolation and evaluated for COVID-19. If symptoms do not develop, \nmovement restrictions can be lifted, and the individual can return to their previous residency status within \nthe facility.\nSocial Distancing—Social distancing is the practice of increasing the space between individuals and \ndecreasing the frequency of contact to reduce the risk of spreading a disease (ideally to maintain at least 6 feet \nbetween all individuals, even those who are asymptomatic). Social distancing strategies can be applied on an \nindividual level (e.g., avoiding physical contact), a group level (e.g., canceling group activities where individuals \nwill be in close contact), and an operational level (e.g., rearranging chairs in the dining hall to increase \ndistance between them). Although social distancing is challenging to practice in correctional and detention \nenvironments, it is a cornerstone of reducing transmission of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. \nAdditional information about social distancing, including information on its use to reduce the spread of other \nviral illnesses, is available in this CDC publication.\nStaff—In this document, “staff” refers to all public sector employees as well as those working for a private \ncontractor within a correctional facility (e.g., private healthcare or food service). Except where noted, “staff” \ndoes not distinguish between healthcare, custody, and other types of staff including private facility operators.\nSymptoms—Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Like other respiratory \ninfections, COVID-19 can vary in severity from mild to severe. When severe, pneumonia, respiratory failure, \nand death are possible. COVID-19 is a novel disease, therefore the full range of signs and symptoms, the \nclinical course of the disease, and the individuals and populations most at risk for disease and complications \nare not yet fully understood. Monitor the CDC website for updates on these topics.\nFacilities with Limited Onsite Healthcare Services\nAlthough many large facilities such as prisons and some jails usually employ onsite healthcare staff and have \nthe capacity to evaluate incarcerated/detained persons for potential illness within a dedicated healthcare \nspace, many smaller facilities do not. Some of these facilities have access to on-call healthcare staff or \nproviders who visit the facility every few days. Others have neither onsite healthcare capacity nor onsite \nmedical isolation/quarantine space and must transfer ill patients to other correctional or detention facilities \nor local hospitals for evaluation and care.\nExhibit 1.4\n4\n\nThe majority of the guidance below is designed to be applied to any correctional or detention facility, either \nas written or with modifications based on a facility’s individual structure and resources. However, topics \nrelated to healthcare evaluation and clinical care of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases and their close \ncontacts may not apply directly to facilities with limited or no onsite healthcare services. It will be especially \nimportant for these types of facilities to coordinate closely with their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial \nhealth department when they encounter confirmed or suspected cases among incarcerated/detained persons \nor staff, in order to ensure effective medical isolation and quarantine, necessary medical evaluation and care, \nand medical transfer if needed. The guidance makes note of strategies tailored to facilities without onsite \nhealthcare where possible. \nNote that all staff in any sized facility, regardless of the presence of onsite healthcare services, should observe \nguidance on recommended PPE in order to ensure their own safety when interacting with confirmed and \nsuspected COVID-19 cases. Facilities should make contingency plans for the likely event of PPE shortages \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCOVID-19 Guidance for Correctional Facilities\nGuidance for correctional and detention facilities is organized into 3 sections: Operational Preparedness, \nPrevention, and Management of COVID-19. Recommendations across these sections can be applied simulta-\nneously based on the progress of the outbreak in a particular facility and the surrounding community. \n• Operational Preparedness. This guidance is intended to help facilities prepare for potential COVID-19 \ntransmission in the facility. Strategies focus on operational and communications planning and personnel \npractices.\n• Prevention. This guidance is intended to help facilities prevent spread of COVID-19 from outside the \nfacility to inside. Strategies focus on reinforcing hygiene practices, intensifying cleaning and disinfection \nof the facility, screening (new intakes, visitors, and staff), continued communication with incarcerated/\ndetained persons and staff, and social distancing measures (increasing distance between individuals). \n• Management. This guidance is intended to help facilities clinically manage confirmed and suspected \nCOVID-19 cases inside the facility and prevent further transmission. Strategies include medical isolation \nand care of incarcerated/detained persons with symptoms (including considerations for cohorting), \nquarantine of cases’ close contacts, restricting movement in and out of the facility, infection control \npractices for individuals interacting with cases and quarantined contacts or contaminated items, intensified \nsocial distancing, and cleaning and disinfecting areas visited by cases. \nOperational Preparedness\nAdministrators can plan and prepare for COVID-19 by ensuring that all persons in the facility know the \nsymptoms of COVID-19 and how to respond if they develop symptoms. Other essential actions include \ndeveloping contingency plans for reduced workforces due to absences, coordinating with public health and \ncorrectional partners, and communicating clearly with staff and incarcerated/detained persons about these \npreparations and how they may temporarily alter daily life. \nCommunication & Coordination\n√  Develop information-sharing systems with partners.\nο  Identify points of contact in relevant state, local, tribal, and/or territorial public health departments \nbefore cases develop. Actively engage with the health department to understand in advance which \nentity has jurisdiction to implement public health control measures for COVID-19 in a particular \ncorrectional or detention facility.\nο  Create and test communications plans to disseminate critical information to incarcerated/detained \npersons, staff, contractors, vendors, and visitors as the pandemic progresses.\nExhibit 1.5\n5\n\nο  Communicate with other correctional facilities in the same geographic area to share information \nincluding disease surveillance and absenteeism patterns among staff. \nο  Where possible, put plans in place with other jurisdictions to prevent confirmed and suspected \nCOVID-19 cases and their close contacts from being transferred between jurisdictions and facilities \nunless necessary for medical evaluation, medical isolation/quarantine, clinical care, extenuating \nsecurity concerns, or to prevent overcrowding.\nο  Stay informed about updates to CDC guidance via the CDC COVID-19 website as more information \nbecomes known.\n√  Review existing pandemic flu, all-hazards, and disaster plans, and revise for COVID-19. \nο  Ensure that physical locations (dedicated housing areas and bathrooms) have been identified \nto isolate confirmed COVID-19 cases and individuals displaying COVID-19 symptoms, and to \nquarantine known close contacts of cases. (Medical isolation and quarantine locations should be \nseparate). The plan should include contingencies for multiple locations if numerous cases and/\nor contacts are identified and require medical isolation or quarantine simultaneously. See Medical \nIsolation and Quarantine sections below for details regarding individual medical isolation and \nquarantine locations (preferred) vs. cohorting.\nο  Facilities without onsite healthcare capacity should make a plan for how they will ensure that \nsuspected COVID-19 cases will be isolated, evaluated, tested (if indicated), and provided necessary \nmedical care. \nο  Make a list of possible social distancing strategies that could be implemented as needed at different \nstages of transmission intensity.\nο  Designate officials who will be authorized to make decisions about escalating or de-escalating \nresponse efforts as the epidemiologic context changes.\n√  Coordinate with local law enforcement and court officials.\nο  Identify lawful alternatives to in-person court appearances, such as virtual court, as a social \ndistancing measure to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.\nο  Explore strategies to prevent over-crowding of correctional and detention facilities during a \ncommunity outbreak.\n√  Post signage throughout the facility communicating the following:\nο  For all: symptoms of COVID-19 and hand hygiene instructions\nο  For incarcerated/detained persons: report symptoms to staff\nο  For staff: stay at home when sick; if symptoms develop while on duty, leave the facility as soon \nas possible and follow CDC-recommended steps for persons who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms \nincluding self-isolating at home, contacting their healthcare provider as soon as possible to \ndetermine whether they need to be evaluated and tested, and contacting their supervisor.\nο  Ensure that signage is understandable for non-English speaking persons and those with low literacy, \nand make necessary accommodations for those with cognitive or intellectual disabilities and those \nwho are deaf, blind, or low-vision.\nPersonnel Practices\n√  Review the sick leave policies of each employer that operates in the facility.\nο  Review policies to ensure that they actively encourage staff to stay home when sick.\nο  If these policies do not encourage staff to stay home when sick, discuss with the contract company.\nο  Determine which officials will have the authority to send symptomatic staff home.\nExhibit 1.6\n6\n\n√  Identify staff whose duties would allow them to work from home. Where possible, allowing \nstaff to work from home can be an effective social distancing strategy to reduce the risk of \nCOVID-19 transmission.\nο  Discuss work from home options with these staff and determine whether they have the supplies and \ntechnological equipment required to do so.\nο  Put systems in place to implement work from home programs (e.g., time tracking, etc.).\n√  Plan for staff absences. Staff should stay home when they are sick, or they may need to stay home to \ncare for a sick household member or care for children in the event of school and childcare dismissals. \nο  Allow staff to work from home when possible, within the scope of their duties.\nο  Identify critical job functions and plan for alternative coverage by cross-training staff where possible.\nο  Determine minimum levels of staff in all categories required for the facility to function safely. If \npossible, develop a plan to secure additional staff if absenteeism due to COVID-19 threatens to bring \nstaffing to minimum levels.\nο  Consider increasing keep on person (KOP) medication orders to cover 30 days in case of healthcare \nstaff shortages.\n√  Consider offering revised duties to staff who are at higher risk of severe illness with COVID-19. \nPersons at higher risk may include older adults and persons of any age with serious underlying medical \nconditions including lung disease, heart disease, and diabetes. See CDC’s website for a complete list, and \ncheck regularly for updates as more data become available to inform this issue.\nο  Facility administrators should consult with their occupational health providers to determine whether \nit would be allowable to reassign duties for specific staff members to reduce their likelihood of \nexposure to COVID-19. \n√  Offer the seasonal influenza vaccine to all incarcerated/detained persons (existing population \nand new intakes) and staff throughout the influenza season. Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to \nthose of influenza. Preventing influenza cases in a facility can speed the detection of COVID-19 cases and \nreduce pressure on healthcare resources.\n√  Reference the Occupational Safety and Health Administration website for recommendations \nregarding worker health.\n√  Review CDC’s guidance for businesses and employers to identify any additional strategies the facility can \nuse within its role as an employer.\nOperations & Supplies\n√  Ensure that sufficient stocks of hygiene supplies, cleaning supplies, PPE, and medical supplies \n(consistent with the healthcare capabilities of the facility) are on hand and available, and have \na plan in place to restock as needed if COVID-19 transmission occurs within the facility.\nο  Standard medical supplies for daily clinic needs\nο  Tissues\nο  Liquid soap when possible. If bar soap must be used, ensure that it does not irritate the skin and \nthereby discourage frequent hand washing. \nο  Hand drying supplies\nο  Alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol (where permissible based on security \nrestrictions)\nο  Cleaning supplies, including EPA-registered disinfectants effective against the virus that causes \nCOVID-19\nExhibit 1.7\n7\n\nο  Recommended PPE (facemasks, N95 respirators, eye protection, disposable medical gloves, and \ndisposable gowns/one-piece coveralls). See PPE section and Table 1 for more detailed information, \nincluding recommendations for extending the life of all PPE categories in the event of shortages, and \nwhen face masks are acceptable alternatives to N95s. \nο  Sterile viral transport media and sterile swabs to collect nasopharyngeal specimens if COVID-19 \ntesting is indicated\n√  Make contingency plans for the probable event of PPE shortages during the COVID-19 \npandemic, particularly for non-healthcare workers.\nο  See CDC guidance optimizing PPE supplies.\n√  Consider relaxing restrictions on allowing alcohol-based hand sanitizer in the secure setting \nwhere security concerns allow. If soap and water are not available, CDC recommends cleaning hands \nwith an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Consider allowing staff to carry \nindividual-sized bottles for their personal hand hygiene while on duty. \n√  Provide a no-cost supply of soap to incarcerated/detained persons, sufficient to allow frequent \nhand washing. (See Hygiene section below for additional detail regarding recommended frequency and \nprotocol for hand washing.)\nο  Provide liquid soap where possible. If bar soap must be used, ensure that it does not irritate the skin \nand thereby discourage frequent hand washing.\n√  If not already in place, employers operating within the facility should establish a respiratory \nprotection program as appropriate, to ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons \nare fit tested for any respiratory protection they will need within the scope of their \nresponsibilities.\n√  Ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons are trained to correctly don, doff, and \ndispose of PPE that they will need to use within the scope of their responsibilities. See Table 1  \nfor recommended PPE for incarcerated/detained persons and staff with varying levels of contact with \nCOVID-19 cases or their close contacts.\nPrevention\nCases of COVID-19 have been documented in all 50 US states. Correctional and detention facilities can \nprevent introduction of COVID-19 from the community and reduce transmission if it is already inside by \nreinforcing good hygiene practices among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, and visitors (including \nincreasing access to soap and paper towels), intensifying cleaning/disinfection practices, and implementing \nsocial distancing strategies.\nBecause many individuals infected with COVID-19 do not display symptoms, the virus could be present \nin facilities before cases are identified. Both good hygiene practices and social distancing are critical in \npreventing further transmission. \nOperations\n√  Stay in communication with partners about your facility’s current situation.\nο  State, local, territorial, and/or tribal health departments\nο  Other correctional facilities\n√  Communicate with the public about any changes to facility operations, including visitation \nprograms.\nExhibit 1.8\n8\n\n√  Restrict transfers of incarcerated/detained persons to and from other jurisdictions and \nfacilities unless necessary for medical evaluation, medical isolation/quarantine, clinical care, \nextenuating security concerns, or to prevent overcrowding.\nο  Strongly consider postponing non-urgent outside medical visits.\nο  If a transfer is absolutely necessary, perform verbal screening and a temperature check as outlined in \nthe Screening section below, before the individual leaves the facility. If an individual does not clear \nthe screening process, delay the transfer and follow the protocol for a suspected COVID-19 case—\nincluding putting a face mask on the individual, immediately placing them under medical isolation, \nand evaluating them for possible COVID-19 testing. If the transfer must still occur, ensure that \nthe receiving facility has capacity to properly isolate the individual upon arrival. Ensure that staff \ntransporting the individual wear recommended PPE (see Table 1) and that the transport vehicle is \ncleaned thoroughly after transport.\n√  Implement lawful alternatives to in-person court appearances where permissible.\n√  Where relevant, consider suspending co-pays for incarcerated/detained persons seeking \nmedical evaluation for respiratory symptoms.\n√  Limit the number of operational entrances and exits to the facility.\nCleaning and Disinfecting Practices\n√  Even if COVID-19 cases have not yet been identified inside the facility or in the surrounding \ncommunity, begin implementing intensified cleaning and disinfecting procedures according to \nthe recommendations below. These measures may prevent spread of COVID-19 if introduced.\n√  Adhere to CDC recommendations for cleaning and disinfection during the COVID-19 response. Monitor \nthese recommendations for updates.\nο  Several times per day, clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched, especially \nin common areas. Such surfaces may include objects/surfaces not ordinarily cleaned daily (e.g., \ndoorknobs, light switches, sink handles, countertops, toilets, toilet handles, recreation equipment, \nkiosks, and telephones). \nο  Staff should clean shared equipment several times per day and on a conclusion of use basis (e.g., \nradios, service weapons, keys, handcuffs).\nο  Use household cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants effective against the virus that causes \nCOVID-19 as appropriate for the surface, following label instructions. This may require lifting \nrestrictions on undiluted disinfectants. \nο  Labels contain instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product, including precautions \nthat should be taken when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure there is \ngood ventilation during use.\n√  Consider increasing the number of staff and/or incarcerated/detained persons trained and \nresponsible for cleaning common areas to ensure continual cleaning of these areas throughout \nthe day.\n√  Ensure adequate supplies to support intensified cleaning and disinfection practices, and have a \nplan in place to restock rapidly if needed.\nExhibit 1.9\n9\n\nHygiene\n√  Reinforce healthy hygiene practices, and provide and continually restock hygiene supplies \nthroughout the facility, including in bathrooms, food preparation and dining areas, intake \nareas, visitor entries and exits, visitation rooms and waiting rooms, common areas, medical, \nand staff-restricted areas (e.g., break rooms).\n√  Encourage all persons in the facility to take the following actions to protect themselves and \nothers from COVID-19. Post signage throughout the facility, and communicate this information \nverbally on a regular basis. Sample signage and other communications materials are available on \nthe CDC website. Ensure that materials can be understood by non-English speakers and those with low \nliteracy, and make necessary accommodations for those with cognitive or intellectual disabilities and those \nwho are deaf, blind, or low-vision.\nο  Practice good cough etiquette: Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow (or ideally with a \ntissue) rather than with your hand when you cough or sneeze, and throw all tissues in the trash \nimmediately after use. \nο  Practice good hand hygiene: Regularly wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 \nseconds, especially after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose; after using the bathroom; before \neating or preparing food; before taking medication; and after touching garbage. \nο  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth without cleaning your hands first. \nο  Avoid sharing eating utensils, dishes, and cups.\nο  Avoid non-essential physical contact. \n√  Provide incarcerated/detained persons and staff no-cost access to:\nο  Soap—Provide liquid soap where possible. If bar soap must be used, ensure that it does not irritate \nthe skin, as this would discourage frequent hand washing.\nο  Running water, and hand drying machines or disposable paper towels for hand washing\nο  Tissues and no-touch trash receptacles for disposal\n√  Provide alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol where permissible based on \nsecurity restrictions. Consider allowing staff to carry individual-sized bottles to maintain hand hygiene.\n√  Communicate that sharing drugs and drug preparation equipment can spread COVID-19 due to \npotential contamination of shared items and close contact between individuals.\nPrevention Practices for Incarcerated/Detained Persons\n√  Perform pre-intake screening and temperature checks for all new entrants. Screening \nshould take place in the sallyport, before beginning the intake process, in order to identify and \nimmediately place individuals with symptoms under medical isolation. See Screening section below for \nthe wording of screening questions and a recommended procedure to safely perform a temperature check. \nStaff performing temperature checks should wear recommended PPE (see PPE section below).\nο  If an individual has symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath):\n  Require the individual to wear a face mask. \n  Ensure that staff who have direct contact with the symptomatic individual wear recommended PPE.\n  Place the individual under medical isolation (ideally in a room near the screening location, \nrather than transporting the ill individual through the facility), and refer to healthcare staff for \nfurther evaluation. (See Infection Control and Clinical Care sections below.)\n  Facilities without onsite healthcare staff should contact their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial \nhealth department to coordinate effective medical isolation and necessary medical care. \nExhibit 1.10\n10\n\nο  If an individual is a close contact of a known COVID-19 case (but has no COVID-19 \nsymptoms): \n  Quarantine the individual and monitor for symptoms two times per day for 14 days. (See \nQuarantine section below.) \n  Facilities without onsite healthcare staff should contact their state, local, tribal, and/or \nterritorial health department to coordinate effective quarantine and necessary medical care. \n√  Implement social distancing strategies to increase the physical space between incarcerated/\ndetained persons (ideally 6 feet between all individuals, regardless of the presence of \nsymptoms). Strategies will need to be tailored to the individual space in the facility and the needs of the \npopulation and staff. Not all strategies will be feasible in all facilities. Example strategies with varying \nlevels of intensity include:\nο  Common areas:\n  Enforce increased space between individuals in holding cells, as well as in lines and waiting areas \nsuch as intake (e.g., remove every other chair in a waiting area)\nο  Recreation:\n  Choose recreation spaces where individuals can spread out\n  Stagger time in recreation spaces\n  Restrict recreation space usage to a single housing unit per space (where feasible)\nο  Meals:\n  Stagger meals \n  Rearrange seating in the dining hall so that there is more space between individuals (e.g., \nremove every other chair and use only one side of the table)\n  Provide meals inside housing units or cells\nο  Group activities:\n  Limit the size of group activities\n  Increase space between individuals during group activities\n  Suspend group programs where participants are likely to be in closer contact than they are in \ntheir housing environment\n  Consider alternatives to existing group activities, in outdoor areas or other areas where \nindividuals can spread out\nο  Housing:\n  If space allows, reassign bunks to provide more space between individuals, ideally 6 feet or more \nin all directions. (Ensure that bunks are cleaned thoroughly if assigned to a new occupant.)\n  Arrange bunks so that individuals sleep head to foot to increase the distance between them\n  Rearrange scheduled movements to minimize mixing of individuals from different housing areas\nο  Medical:\n  If possible, designate a room near each housing unit to evaluate individuals with COVID-19 \nsymptoms, rather than having them walk through the facility to be evaluated in the medical \nunit. If this is not feasible, consider staggering sick call.\n  Designate a room near the intake area to evaluate new entrants who are flagged by the intake \nscreening process for COVID-19 symptoms or case contact, before they move to other parts of \nthe facility.\nExhibit 1.11\n11\n\n√  Communicate clearly and frequently with incarcerated/detained persons about changes to their \ndaily routine and how they can contribute to risk reduction.\n√  Note that if group activities are discontinued, it will be important to identify alternative forms \nof activity to support the mental health of incarcerated/detained persons.\n√  Consider suspending work release programs and other programs that involve movement of \nincarcerated/detained individuals in and out of the facility.\n√  Provide up-to-date information about COVID-19 to incarcerated/detained persons on a regular \nbasis, including: \nο  Symptoms of COVID-19 and its health risks \nο  Reminders to report COVID-19 symptoms to staff at the first sign of illness\n√  Consider having healthcare staff perform rounds on a regular basis to answer questions about \nCOVID-19.\nPrevention Practices for Staff\n√  Remind staff to stay at home if they are sick. Ensure that staff are aware that they will not be able to \nenter the facility if they have symptoms of COVID-19, and that they will be expected to leave the facility as \nsoon as possible if they develop symptoms while on duty.\n√  Perform verbal screening (for COVID-19 symptoms and close contact with cases) and \ntemperature checks for all staff daily on entry. See Screening section below for wording of screening \nquestions and a recommended procedure to safely perform temperature checks.\nο  In very small facilities with only a few staff, consider self-monitoring or virtual monitoring (e.g., \nreporting to a central authority via phone). \nο  Send staff home who do not clear the screening process, and advise them to follow CDC-\nrecommended steps for persons who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms.\n√  Provide staff with up-to-date information about COVID-19 and about facility policies on a \nregular basis, including: \nο  Symptoms of COVID-19 and its health risks\nο  Employers’ sick leave policy \nο  If staff develop a fever, cough, or shortness of breath while at work: immediately put on a \nface mask, inform supervisor, leave the facility, and follow CDC-recommended steps for persons who \nare ill with COVID-19 symptoms.\nο  If staff test positive for COVID-19: inform workplace and personal contacts immediately, and \ndo not return to work until a decision to discontinue home medical isolation precautions is made. \nMonitor CDC guidance on discontinuing home isolation regularly as circumstances evolve rapidly. \nο  If a staff member is identified as a close contact of a COVID-19 case (either within \nthe facility or in the community): self-quarantine at home for 14 days and return to work if \nsymptoms do not develop. If symptoms do develop, follow CDC-recommended steps for persons who \nare ill with COVID-19 symptoms. \n√  If a staff member has a confirmed COVID-19 infection, the relevant employers should inform \nother staff about their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace, but should maintain \nconfidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act.\nο  Employees who are close contacts of the case should then self-monitor for symptoms (i.e., fever, \ncough, or shortness of breath). \nExhibit 1.12\n12\n\n√  When feasible and consistent with security priorities, encourage staff to maintain a distance of \n6 feet or more from an individual with respiratory symptoms while interviewing, escorting, or \ninteracting in other ways.\n√  Ask staff to keep interactions with individuals with respiratory symptoms as brief as possible.\nPrevention Practices for Visitors\n√  If possible, communicate with potential visitors to discourage contact visits in the interest of \ntheir own health and the health of their family members and friends inside the facility.\n√  Perform verbal screening (for COVID-19 symptoms and close contact with cases) and \ntemperature checks for all visitors and volunteers on entry. See Screening section below for \nwording of screening questions and a recommended procedure to safely perform temperature checks. \nο  Staff performing temperature checks should wear recommended PPE.\nο  Exclude visitors and volunteers who do not clear the screening process or who decline screening.\n√  Provide alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol in visitor entrances, exits, and \nwaiting areas.\n√  Provide visitors and volunteers with information to prepare them for screening.\nο  Instruct visitors to postpone their visit if they have symptoms of respiratory illness.\nο  If possible, inform potential visitors and volunteers before they travel to the facility that they should \nexpect to be screened for COVID-19 (including a temperature check), and will be unable to enter the \nfacility if they do not clear the screening process or if they decline screening.\nο  Display signage outside visiting areas explaining the COVID-19 screening and temperature check \nprocess. Ensure that materials are understandable for non-English speakers and those with low \nliteracy.\n√  Promote non-contact visits:\nο  Encourage incarcerated/detained persons to limit contact visits in the interest of their own health \nand the health of their visitors.\nο  Consider reducing or temporarily eliminating the cost of phone calls for incarcerated/detained \npersons.\nο  Consider increasing incarcerated/detained persons’ telephone privileges to promote mental health \nand reduce exposure from direct contact with community visitors.\n√  Consider suspending or modifying visitation programs, if legally permissible. For example, \nprovide access to virtual visitation options where available. \nο  If moving to virtual visitation, clean electronic surfaces regularly. (See Cleaning guidance below for \ninstructions on cleaning electronic surfaces.)\nο  Inform potential visitors of changes to, or suspension of, visitation programs.\nο  Clearly communicate any visitation program changes to incarcerated/detained persons, along with \nthe reasons for them (including protecting their health and their family and community members’ \nhealth).\nο  If suspending contact visits, provide alternate means (e.g., phone or video visitation) for \nincarcerated/detained individuals to engage with legal representatives, clergy, and other individuals \nwith whom they have legal right to consult. \nNOTE: Suspending visitation would be done in the interest of incarcerated/detained persons’ physical \nhealth and the health of the general public. However, visitation is important to maintain mental health. \nExhibit 1.13\n13\n\nIf visitation is suspended, facilities should explore alternative ways for incarcerated/detained persons to \ncommunicate with their families, friends, and other visitors in a way that is not financially burdensome \nfor them. See above suggestions for promoting non-contact visits.\n√  Restrict non-essential vendors, volunteers, and tours from entering the facility.\nManagement\nIf there has been a suspected COVID-19 case inside the facility (among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, \nor visitors who have recently been inside), begin implementing Management strategies while test results \nare pending. Essential Management strategies include placing cases and individuals with symptoms under \nmedical isolation, quarantining their close contacts, and facilitating necessary medical care, while observing \nrelevant infection control and environmental disinfection protocols and wearing recommended PPE. \nOperations\n√  Implement alternate work arrangements deemed feasible in the Operational Preparedness section.\n√  Suspend all transfers of incarcerated/detained persons to and from other jurisdictions and \nfacilities (including work release where relevant), unless necessary for medical evaluation, \nmedical isolation/quarantine, care, extenuating security concerns, or to prevent overcrowding.\nο  If a transfer is absolutely necessary, perform verbal screening and a temperature check as outlined in \nthe Screening section below, before the individual leaves the facility. If an individual does not clear \nthe screening process, delay the transfer and follow the protocol for a suspected COVID-19 case—\nincluding putting a face mask on the individual, immediately placing them under medical isolation, \nand evaluating them for possible COVID-19 testing. If the transfer must still occur, ensure that the \nreceiving facility has capacity to appropriately isolate the individual upon arrival. Ensure that staff \ntransporting the individual wear recommended PPE (see Table 1) and that the transport vehicle is \ncleaned thoroughly after transport.\n√  If possible, consider quarantining all new intakes for 14 days before they enter the facility’s \ngeneral population (SEPARATELY from other individuals who are quarantined due to contact \nwith a COVID-19 case). Subsequently in this document, this practice is referred to as routine intake \nquarantine.\n√  When possible, arrange lawful alternatives to in-person court appearances.\n√  Incorporate screening for COVID-19 symptoms and a temperature check into release planning. \nο  Screen all releasing individuals for COVID-19 symptoms and perform a temperature check. (See \nScreening section below.)\n  If an individual does not clear the screening process, follow the protocol for a suspected \nCOVID-19 case—including putting a face mask on the individual, immediately placing them \nunder medical isolation, and evaluating them for possible COVID-19 testing. \n  If the individual is released before the recommended medical isolation period is complete, \ndiscuss release of the individual with state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health departments \nto ensure safe medical transport and continued shelter and medical care, as part of release \nplanning. Make direct linkages to community resources to ensure proper medical isolation and \naccess to medical care. \n  Before releasing an incarcerated/detained individual with COVID-19 symptoms to a community-\nbased facility, such as a homeless shelter, contact the facility’s staff to ensure adequate time for \nthem to prepare to continue medical isolation, or contact local public health to explore alternate \nhousing options.\nExhibit 1.14\n14\n\n√  Coordinate with state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health departments. \nο  When a COVID-19 case is suspected, work with public health to determine action. See Medical \nIsolation section below. \nο  When a COVID-19 case is suspected or confirmed, work with public health to identify close contacts \nwho should be placed under quarantine. See Quarantine section below.\nο  Facilities with limited onsite medical isolation, quarantine, and/or healthcare services should \ncoordinate closely with state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health departments when they \nencounter a confirmed or suspected case, in order to ensure effective medical isolation or quarantine, \nnecessary medical evaluation and care, and medical transfer if needed. See Facilities with Limited \nOnsite Healthcare Services section.\nHygiene\n√  Continue to ensure that hand hygiene supplies are well-stocked in all areas of the facility.  \n(See above.)\n√  Continue to emphasize practicing good hand hygiene and cough etiquette. (See above.)\nCleaning and Disinfecting Practices\n√  Continue adhering to recommended cleaning and disinfection procedures for the facility at \nlarge. (See above.)\n√  Reference specific cleaning and disinfection procedures for areas where a COVID-19 case has \nspent time (below).\nMedical Isolation of Confirmed or Suspected COVID-19 Cases\nNOTE: Some recommendations below apply primarily to facilities with onsite healthcare capacity. \nFacilities with Limited Onsite Healthcare Services, or without sufficient space to implement \neffective medical isolation, should coordinate with local public health officials to ensure that \nCOVID-19 cases will be appropriately isolated, evaluated, tested (if indicated), and given care. \n√  As soon as an individual develops symptoms of COVID-19, they should wear a face mask (if it \ndoes not restrict breathing) and should be immediately placed under medical isolation in a \nseparate environment from other individuals. \n√  Keep the individual’s movement outside the medical isolation space to an absolute minimum.\nο  Provide medical care to cases inside the medical isolation space. See Infection Control and Clinical \nCare sections for additional details.\nο  Serve meals to cases inside the medical isolation space.\nο  Exclude the individual from all group activities.\nο  Assign the isolated individual a dedicated bathroom when possible.\n√  Ensure that the individual is wearing a face mask at all times when outside of the medical \nisolation space, and whenever another individual enters. Provide clean masks as needed. Masks \nshould be changed at least daily, and when visibly soiled or wet.\n√  Facilities should make every possible effort to place suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases \nunder medical isolation individually. Each isolated individual should be assigned their own \nhousing space and bathroom where possible. Cohorting should only be practiced if there are no other \navailable options.\nExhibit 1.15\n15\n\nο  If cohorting is necessary:\n  Only individuals who are laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases should be placed under \nmedical isolation as a cohort. Do not cohort confirmed cases with suspected cases or \ncase contacts. \n  Unless no other options exist, do not house COVID-19 cases with individuals who have an \nundiagnosed respiratory infection.\n  Ensure that cohorted cases wear face masks at all times.\n√  In order of preference, individuals under medical isolation should be housed:\nο  Separately, in single cells with solid walls (i.e., not bars) and solid doors that close fully\nο  Separately, in single cells with solid walls but without solid doors \nο  As a cohort, in a large, well-ventilated cell with solid walls and a solid door that closes fully. Employ \nsocial distancing strategies related to housing in the Prevention section above.\nο  As a cohort, in a large, well-ventilated cell with solid walls but without a solid door. Employ social \ndistancing strategies related to housing in the Prevention section above.\nο  As a cohort, in single cells without solid walls or solid doors (i.e., cells enclosed entirely with bars), \npreferably with an empty cell between occupied cells. (Although individuals are in single cells in \nthis scenario, the airflow between cells essentially makes it a cohort arrangement in the context of \nCOVID-19.)\nο  As a cohort, in multi-person cells without solid walls or solid doors (i.e., cells enclosed entirely with \nbars), preferably with an empty cell between occupied cells. Employ social distancing strategies \nrelated to housing in the Prevention section above.\nο  Safely transfer individual(s) to another facility with available medical isolation capacity in one of the \nabove arrangements \n(NOTE—Transfer should be avoided due to the potential to introduce infection to another facility; \nproceed only if no other options are available.)\nIf the ideal choice does not exist in a facility, use the next best alternative. \n√  If the number of confirmed cases exceeds the number of individual medical isolation spaces \navailable in the facility, be especially mindful of cases who are at higher risk of severe illness \nfrom COVID-19. Ideally, they should not be cohorted with other infected individuals. If cohorting is \nunavoidable, make all possible accommodations to prevent transmission of other infectious diseases to \nthe higher-risk individual. (For example, allocate more space for a higher-risk individual within a shared \nmedical isolation space.) \nο  Persons at higher risk may include older adults and persons of any age with serious underlying \nmedical conditions such as lung disease, heart disease, and diabetes. See CDC’s website for a \ncomplete list, and check regularly for updates as more data become available to inform this issue.\nο  Note that incarcerated/detained populations have higher prevalence of infectious and chronic \ndiseases and are in poorer health than the general population, even at younger ages.\n√  Custody staff should be designated to monitor these individuals exclusively where possible. \nThese staff should wear recommended PPE as appropriate for their level of contact with the individual \nunder medical isolation (see PPE section below) and should limit their own movement between different \nparts of the facility to the extent possible.\n√  Minimize transfer of COVID-19 cases between spaces within the healthcare unit.\nExhibit 1.16\n16\n\n√  Provide individuals under medical isolation with tissues and, if permissible, a lined no-touch \ntrash receptacle. Instruct them to:\nο  Cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when they cough or sneeze\nο  Dispose of used tissues immediately in the lined trash receptacle\nο  Wash hands immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not \navailable, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol (where \nsecurity concerns permit). Ensure that hand washing supplies are continually restocked.\n√  Maintain medical isolation until all the following criteria have been met. Monitor the CDC \nwebsite for updates to these criteria.\nFor individuals who will be tested to determine if they are still contagious:\n  The individual has been free from fever for at least 72 hours without the use of fever-reducing \nmedications AND\n  The individual’s other symptoms have improved (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) AND\n  The individual has tested negative in at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at \nleast 24 hours apart\nFor individuals who will NOT be tested to determine if they are still contagious:\n  The individual has been free from fever for at least 72 hours without the use of fever-reducing \nmedications AND\n  The individual’s other symptoms have improved (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) AND\n  At least 7 days have passed since the first symptoms appeared\nFor individuals who had a confirmed positive COVID-19 test but never showed symptoms:\nο  At least 7 days have passed since the date of the individual’s first positive COVID-19 test AND\nο  The individual has had no subsequent illness\n√  Restrict cases from leaving the facility while under medical isolation precautions, unless \nreleased from custody or if a transfer is necessary for medical care, infection control, lack of \nmedical isolation space, or extenuating security concerns.\nο  If an incarcerated/detained individual who is a COVID-19 case is released from custody during their \nmedical isolation period, contact public health to arrange for safe transport and continuation of \nnecessary medical care and medical isolation as part of release planning.\nCleaning Spaces where COVID-19 Cases Spent Time\nThoroughly clean and disinfect all areas where the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case spent \ntime. Note—these protocols apply to suspected cases as well as confirmed cases, to ensure \nadequate disinfection in the event that the suspected case does, in fact, have COVID-19. Refer to \nthe Definitions section for the distinction between confirmed and suspected cases.\nο  Close off areas used by the infected individual. If possible, open outside doors and windows to \nincrease air circulation in the area. Wait as long as practical, up to 24 hours under the poorest air \nexchange conditions (consult CDC Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care \nFacilities for wait time based on different ventilation conditions), before beginning to clean and \ndisinfect, to minimize potential for exposure to respiratory droplets. \nο  Clean and disinfect all areas (e.g., cells, bathrooms, and common areas) used by the infected \nindividual, focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces (see list above in Prevention section).\nExhibit 1.17\n17\n\n√  Hard (non-porous) surface cleaning and disinfection\nο  If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.\nο  For disinfection, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective. Choose \ncleaning products based on security requirements within the facility.\n  Consult a list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19. \nFollow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., \nconcentration, application method and contact time, etc.). \n  Diluted household bleach solutions can be used if appropriate for the surface. Follow the \nmanufacturer’s instructions for application and proper ventilation, and check to ensure the \nproduct is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other \ncleanser. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly \ndiluted. Prepare a bleach solution by mixing: \n-  5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water or\n-  4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water\n√  Soft (porous) surface cleaning and disinfection\nο  For soft (porous) surfaces such as carpeted floors and rugs, remove visible contamination if present \nand clean with appropriate cleaners indicated for use on these surfaces. After cleaning: \n  If the items can be laundered, launder items in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions \nusing the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and then dry items completely. \n  Otherwise, use products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 \nand are suitable for porous surfaces.\n√  Electronics cleaning and disinfection\nο  For electronics such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, and remote controls, remove visible \ncontamination if present. \n  Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. \n  Consider use of wipeable covers for electronics.\n  If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or spray \ncontaining at least 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid \npooling of liquids.\nAdditional information on cleaning and disinfection of communal facilities such can be found on CDC’s \nwebsite.\n√  Ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons performing cleaning wear recommended \nPPE. (See PPE section below.)\n√  Food service items. Cases under medical isolation should throw disposable food service items in the \ntrash in their medical isolation room. Non-disposable food service items should be handled with gloves \nand washed with hot water or in a dishwasher. Individuals handling used food service items should clean \ntheir hands after removing gloves.\n√  Laundry from a COVID-19 cases can be washed with other individuals’ laundry.\nο  Individuals handling laundry from COVID-19 cases should wear disposable gloves, discard after each \nuse, and clean their hands after. \nο  Do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air.\nο  Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. If possible, \nlaunder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely.\nExhibit 1.18\n18\n\nο  Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. If permissible, \nconsider using a bag liner that is either disposable or can be laundered.\n√  Consult cleaning recommendations above to ensure that transport vehicles are thoroughly cleaned \nafter carrying a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case.\nQuarantining Close Contacts of COVID-19 Cases\nNOTE: Some recommendations below apply primarily to facilities with onsite healthcare capacity. \nFacilities without onsite healthcare capacity, or without sufficient space to implement effective \nquarantine, should coordinate with local public health officials to ensure that close contacts of \nCOVID-19 cases will be effectively quarantined and medically monitored.\n√  Incarcerated/detained persons who are close contacts of a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case \n(whether the case is another incarcerated/detained person, staff member, or visitor) should be \nplaced under quarantine for 14 days (see CDC guidelines).\nο  If an individual is quarantined due to contact with a suspected case who is subsequently tested \nfor COVID-19 and receives a negative result, the quarantined individual should be released from \nquarantine restrictions.\n√  In the context of COVID-19, an individual (incarcerated/detained person or staff) is considered \na close contact if they:\nο  Have been within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time OR\nο  Have had direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., have been coughed on)\nClose contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a common space with a COVID-19 \ncase. Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited. Considerations when assessing close \ncontact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and \nthe clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk, as does \nexposure to a severely ill patient). \n√  Keep a quarantined individual’s movement outside the quarantine space to an absolute \nminimum. \nο  Provide medical evaluation and care inside or near the quarantine space when possible. \nο  Serve meals inside the quarantine space.\nο  Exclude the quarantined individual from all group activities.\nο  Assign the quarantined individual a dedicated bathroom when possible.\n√  Facilities should make every possible effort to quarantine close contacts of COVID-19 cases \nindividually. Cohorting multiple quarantined close contacts of a COVID-19 case could transmit \nCOVID-19 from those who are infected to those who are uninfected. Cohorting should only be practiced if \nthere are no other available options.\nο  If cohorting of close contacts under quarantine is absolutely necessary, symptoms of all individuals \nshould be monitored closely, and individuals with symptoms of COVID-19 should be placed under \nmedical isolation immediately.\nο  If an entire housing unit is under quarantine due to contact with a case from the same housing unit, \nthe entire housing unit may need to be treated as a cohort and quarantine in place. \nο  Some facilities may choose to quarantine all new intakes for 14 days before moving them to the \nfacility’s general population as a general rule (not because they were exposed to a COVID-19 case). \nUnder this scenario, avoid mixing individuals quarantined due to exposure to a COVID-19 case with \nindividuals undergoing routine intake quarantine.\nExhibit 1.19\n19\n\nο  If at all possible, do not add more individuals to an existing quarantine cohort after the 14-day \nquarantine clock has started. \n√  If the number of quarantined individuals exceeds the number of individual quarantine spaces \navailable in the facility, be especially mindful of those who are at higher risk of severe illness \nfrom COVID-19. Ideally, they should not be cohorted with other quarantined individuals. If cohorting \nis unavoidable, make all possible accommodations to reduce exposure risk for the higher-risk individuals. \n(For example, intensify social distancing strategies for higher-risk individuals.) \n√  In order of preference, multiple quarantined individuals should be housed:\nο  Separately, in single cells with solid walls (i.e., not bars) and solid doors that close fully\nο  Separately, in single cells with solid walls but without solid doors \nο  As a cohort, in a large, well-ventilated cell with solid walls, a solid door that closes fully, and at least 6 \nfeet of personal space assigned to each individual in all directions\nο  As a cohort, in a large, well-ventilated cell with solid walls and at least 6 feet of personal space \nassigned to each individual in all directions, but without a solid door\nο  As a cohort, in single cells without solid walls or solid doors (i.e., cells enclosed entirely with bars), \npreferably with an empty cell between occupied cells creating at least 6 feet of space between \nindividuals. (Although individuals are in single cells in this scenario, the airflow between cells \nessentially makes it a cohort arrangement in the context of COVID-19.)\nο  As a cohort, in multi-person cells without solid walls or solid doors (i.e., cells enclosed entirely with \nbars), preferably with an empty cell between occupied cells. Employ social distancing strategies \nrelated to housing in the Prevention section to maintain at least 6 feet of space between individuals \nhoused in the same cell.\nο  As a cohort, in individuals’ regularly assigned housing unit but with no movement outside the unit \n(if an entire housing unit has been exposed). Employ social distancing strategies related to housing \nin the Prevention section above to maintain at least 6 feet of space between individuals.\nο  Safely transfer to another facility with capacity to quarantine in one of the above arrangements \n(NOTE—Transfer should be avoided due to the potential to introduce infection to another facility; \nproceed only if no other options are available.)\n√  Quarantined individuals should wear face masks if feasible based on local supply, as source \ncontrol, under the following circumstances (see PPE section and Table 1): \nο  If cohorted, quarantined individuals should wear face masks at all times (to prevent transmission \nfrom infected to uninfected individuals).\nο  If quarantined separately, individuals should wear face masks whenever a non-quarantined \nindividual enters the quarantine space.\nο  All quarantined individuals should wear a face mask if they must leave the quarantine space for any \nreason.\nο  Asymptomatic individuals under routine intake quarantine (with no known exposure to a COVID-19 \ncase) do not need to wear face masks.\n√  Staff who have close contact with quarantined individuals should wear recommended PPE if \nfeasible based on local supply, feasibility, and safety within the scope of their duties (see PPE \nsection and Table 1). \nο  Staff supervising asymptomatic incarcerated/detained persons under routine intake quarantine \n(with no known exposure to a COVID-19 case) do not need to wear PPE.\nExhibit 1.20\n20\n\n√  Quarantined individuals should be monitored for COVID-19 symptoms twice per day, including \ntemperature checks. \nο  If an individual develops symptoms, they should be moved to medical isolation immediately and \nfurther evaluated. (See Medical Isolation section above.) \nο  See Screening section for a procedure to perform temperature checks safely on asymptomatic close \ncontacts of COVID-19 cases. \n√  If an individual who is part of a quarantined cohort becomes symptomatic:\nο  If the individual is tested for COVID-19 and tests positive: the 14-day quarantine clock for the \nremainder of the cohort must be reset to 0.\nο  If the individual is tested for COVID-19 and tests negative: the 14-day quarantine clock for \nthis individual and the remainder of the cohort does not need to be reset. This individual can return \nfrom medical isolation to the quarantined cohort for the remainder of the quarantine period.\nο  If the individual is not tested for COVID-19: the 14-day quarantine clock for the remainder of \nthe cohort must be reset to 0.\n√  Restrict quarantined individuals from leaving the facility (including transfers to other \nfacilities) during the 14-day quarantine period, unless released from custody or a transfer is \nnecessary for medical care, infection control, lack of quarantine space, or extenuating security \nconcerns.\n√  Quarantined individuals can be released from quarantine restrictions if they have not \ndeveloped symptoms during the 14-day quarantine period.\n√  Meals should be provided to quarantined individuals in their quarantine spaces. Individuals \nunder quarantine should throw disposable food service items in the trash. Non-disposable food service \nitems should be handled with gloves and washed with hot water or in a dishwasher. Individuals handling \nused food service items should clean their hands after removing gloves.\n√  Laundry from quarantined individuals can be washed with other individuals’ laundry.\nο  Individuals handling laundry from quarantined persons should wear disposable gloves, discard after \neach use, and clean their hands after.\nο  Do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air.\nο  Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. If possible, \nlaunder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely.\nο  Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. If permissible, \nconsider using a bag liner that is either disposable or can be laundered.\nManagement of Incarcerated/Detained Persons with COVID-19 Symptoms\nNOTE: Some recommendations below apply primarily to facilities with onsite healthcare capacity. \nFacilities without onsite healthcare capacity or without sufficient space for medical isolation \nshould coordinate with local public health officials to ensure that suspected COVID-19 cases will be \neffectively isolated, evaluated, tested (if indicated), and given care.\n√  If possible, designate a room near each housing unit for healthcare staff to evaluate individuals \nwith COVID-19 symptoms, rather than having them walk through the facility to be evaluated in \nthe medical unit.\n√  Incarcerated/detained individuals with COVID-19 symptoms should wear a face mask and \nshould be placed under medical isolation immediately. Discontinue the use of a face mask if it \ninhibits breathing. See Medical Isolation section above. \nExhibit 1.21\n21\n\n√  Medical staff should evaluate symptomatic individuals to determine whether COVID-19 testing \nis indicated. Refer to CDC guidelines for information on evaluation and testing. See Infection Control \nand Clinical Care sections below as well.\n√  If testing is indicated (or if medical staff need clarification on when testing is indicated), \ncontact the state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health department. Work with public health \nor private labs as available to access testing supplies or services. \nο  If the COVID-19 test is positive, continue medical isolation. (See Medical Isolation section above.)\nο  If the COVID-19 test is negative, return the individual to their prior housing assignment unless they \nrequire further medical assessment or care.\nManagement Strategies for Incarcerated/Detained Persons without COVID-19 Symptoms\n√  Provide clear information to incarcerated/detained persons about the presence of COVID-19 \ncases within the facility, and the need to increase social distancing and maintain hygiene \nprecautions. \nο  Consider having healthcare staff perform regular rounds to answer questions about COVID-19.\nο  Ensure that information is provided in a manner that can be understood by non-English speaking \nindividuals and those with low literacy, and make necessary accommodations for those with \ncognitive or intellectual disabilities and those who are deaf, blind, or low-vision.\n√  Implement daily temperature checks in housing units where COVID-19 cases have been \nidentified, especially if there is concern that incarcerated/detained individuals are not \nnotifying staff of symptoms. See Screening section for a procedure to safely perform a temperature \ncheck.\n√  Consider additional options to intensify social distancing within the facility.\nManagement Strategies for Staff\n√  Provide clear information to staff about the presence of COVID-19 cases within the facility, and \nthe need to enforce social distancing and encourage hygiene precautions. \nο  Consider having healthcare staff perform regular rounds to answer questions about COVID-19 from \nstaff.\n√  Staff identified as close contacts of a COVID-19 case should self-quarantine at home for 14 days \nand may return to work if symptoms do not develop. \nο  See above for definition of a close contact.\nο  Refer to CDC guidelines for further recommendations regarding home quarantine for staff.\nInfection Control \nInfection control guidance below is applicable to all types of correctional facilities. Individual \nfacilities should assess their unique needs based on the types of exposure staff and incarcerated/\ndetained persons may have with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases.\n√  All individuals who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to COVID-19 cases or \ninfectious materials (including body substances; contaminated medical supplies, devices, \nand equipment; contaminated environmental surfaces; or contaminated air) should follow \ninfection control practices outlined in the CDC Interim Infection Prevention and Control \nRecommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 \n(COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings. Monitor these guidelines regularly for updates. \nExhibit 1.22\n22\n\nο  Implement the above guidance as fully as possible within the correctional/detention context. Some \nof the specific language may not apply directly to healthcare settings within correctional facilities \nand detention centers, or to facilities without onsite healthcare capacity, and may need to be adapted \nto reflect facility operations and custody needs.\nο  Note that these recommendations apply to staff as well as to incarcerated/detained individuals who \nmay come in contact with contaminated materials during the course of their work placement in the \nfacility (e.g., cleaning).\n√  Staff should exercise caution when in contact with individuals showing symptoms of a \nrespiratory infection. Contact should be minimized to the extent possible until the infected individual \nis wearing a face mask. If COVID-19 is suspected, staff should wear recommended PPE (see PPE section).\n√  Refer to PPE section to determine recommended PPE for individuals persons in contact with \nconfirmed COVID-19 cases, contacts, and potentially contaminated items.\nClinical Care of COVID-19 Cases\n√  Facilities should ensure that incarcerated/detained individuals receive medical evaluation and \ntreatment at the first signs of COVID-19 symptoms. \nο  If a facility is not able to provide such evaluation and treatment, a plan should be in place to safely \ntransfer the individual to another facility or local hospital.\nο  The initial medical evaluation should determine whether a symptomatic individual is at higher risk \nfor severe illness from COVID-19. Persons at higher risk may include older adults and persons of any \nage with serious underlying medical conditions such as lung disease, heart disease, and diabetes. See \nCDC’s website for a complete list, and check regularly for updates as more data become available to \ninform this issue.\n√  Staff evaluating and providing care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases should follow \nthe CDC Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus \nDisease (COVID-19) and monitor the guidance website regularly for updates to these \nrecommendations.\n√  Healthcare staff should evaluate persons with respiratory symptoms or contact with a \nCOVID-19 case in a separate room, with the door closed if possible, while wearing recommended \nPPE and ensuring that the suspected case is wearing a face mask. \nο  If possible, designate a room near each housing unit to evaluate individuals with COVID-19 \nsymptoms, rather than having them walk through the facility to be evaluated in the medical unit. \n√  Clinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness (e.g., \ninfluenza).\n√  The facility should have a plan in place to safely transfer persons with severe illness from \nCOVID-19 to a local hospital if they require care beyond what the facility is able to provide.\n√  When evaluating and treating persons with symptoms of COVID-19 who do not speak English, \nusing a language line or provide a trained interpreter when possible. \nRecommended PPE and PPE Training for Staff and Incarcerated/Detained Persons\n√  Ensure that all staff (healthcare and non-healthcare) and incarcerated/detained persons \nwho will have contact with infectious materials in their work placements have been trained \nto correctly don, doff, and dispose of PPE relevant to the level of contact they will have with \nconfirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases. \nExhibit 1.23\n23\n\nο  Ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons who require respiratory protection (e.g., N95s) \nfor their work responsibilities have been medically cleared, trained, and fit-tested in the context of \nan employer’s respiratory protection program. \nο  For PPE training materials and posters, please visit the CDC website on Protecting Healthcare \nPersonnel. \n√  Ensure that all staff are trained to perform hand hygiene after removing PPE.\n√  If administrators anticipate that incarcerated/detained persons will request unnecessary PPE, \nconsider providing training on the different types of PPE that are needed for differing degrees \nof contact with COVID-19 cases and contacts, and the reasons for those differences (see Table 1). \nMonitor linked CDC guidelines in Table 1 for updates to recommended PPE.\n√  Keep recommended PPE near the spaces in the facility where it could be needed, to facilitate \nquick access in an emergency.\n√  Recommended PPE for incarcerated/detained individuals and staff in a correctional facility will \nvary based on the type of contact they have with COVID-19 cases and their contacts (see Table 1). Each \ntype of recommended PPE is defined below. As above, note that PPE shortages are anticipated in \nevery category during the COVID-19 response.\nο  N95 respirator \nSee below for guidance on when face masks are acceptable alternatives for N95s.

Below, verbal screening questions for \nCOVID-19 symptoms and contact with known cases, and a safe temperature check procedure are detailed. \n√  Verbal screening for symptoms of COVID-19 and contact with COVID-19 cases should include \nthe following questions: \nο  Today or in the past 24 hours, have you had any of the following symptoms?\n  Fever, felt feverish, or had chills?\n  Cough?\n  Difficulty breathing?\nο  In the past 14 days, have you had contact with a person known to be infected with the novel coronavirus \n(COVID-19)? \n√  The following is a protocol to safely check an individual’s temperature: \nο  Perform hand hygiene\nο  Put on a face mask, eye protection (goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and \nsides of the face), gown/coveralls, and a single pair of disposable gloves \nο  Check individual’s temperature \nο  If performing a temperature check on multiple individuals, ensure that a clean pair of \ngloves is used for each individual and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned \nin between each check. If disposable or non-contact thermometers are used and the screener did \nnot have physical contact with an individual, gloves do not need to be changed before the next check. \nIf non-contact thermometers are used, they should be cleaned routinely as recommended by CDC for \ninfection control.\nο  Remove and discard PPE\nο  Perform hand hygiene\nExhibit 1.26\n26\n\nExhibit 2.1\n\nExhibit 2.2\n\nExhibit 2.3\n\nExhibit 2.4\n\nExhibit 2.5\n\nExhibit 3.1\n\nExhibit 3.2\n\nExhibit 4.1\n\nExhibit 4.2\n\nExhibit 4.3\n\nExhibit 4.4\n\nExhibit 5.1\n\nExhibit 5.2\n\nThe Commonwealth of Massachusetts \nExecutive Office of Public Safety & Security \nDepartment of Correction \n50 Maple Street, Suite 3 \nMilford, MA 01757 \n   \nTel: (508) 422-3300   \nCHARLES D.

I am confident that our medical vendor Wellpath is prepared \nand ready to respond as appropriate.  The following steps have been taken to ease burdens and protect staff and patients, \nwhile maintaining normal operations as much as possible. \n  \n•  All staff and vendors are being screened before being allowed to enter the any DOC facility in accordance with        \nDPH/CDC recommendations. \n•  Non-essential entrance into the facility continues to be limited.  For those who do need to enter, a screening protocol \nhas been implemented to ensure that no one exhibiting any concerning symptoms is allowed in. \n•  In addition to the 2 free phone calls per patient per week. \n•  I have waived all medical co-pays until further notice. \n•  Hand sanitizer pump stations are installed throughout all facilities and pump stations are now being supplied with \nisopropanol (alcohol based) gel. \n•  Attorney visits remain unaffected at this time with the exception of the Massachusetts Treatment Center \n•  Patient releases have occurred without interruption. \n \nThe experts have emphasized the importance of social distancing.  While institutional settings may sometimes be challenging, \nplease do your part.  The shaking of hands, hugging, fist bumps, sharing of food/drink etc. should not be happening. \n \nWash your hands often; if you need more soap, it will be provided to you.  The use of soap and water should be the primary \nway of cleaning and disinfecting your hands and body. \n \nFeeling anxious during these times is normal; however, if you feel you need to talk with someone, I encourage you to reach out \nto our mental health professionals. \nThank you again for your cooperation during this time.  I will continue to provide weekly updates and ask that you continue to \nwork together toward our goal of maintaining a safe, secure environment for all.\n  Exhibit 6.1\n\nThe Commonwealth of Massachusetts \nExecutive Office of Public Safety & Security \nDepartment of Correction \n50 Maple Street, Suite 3 \nMilford, MA 01757 \n   \nTel: (508) 422-3300   \nCHARLES D.

This information has been communicated to the MA Department of Public Health and the \nlocal health departments with jurisdiction over affected prisons/facilities and they are taking necessary \nsteps.  In an effort to slow the spread of the virus and deter infections, Bridgewater State Hospital will \nbe placed on modified status where movement may be significantly restricted for 14 days, at which \ntime we will reevaluate the need to remain in a modified status, based on the number of infections \nand/or infection rates.   \n \nAll necessary precautions are being taken as the health of our staff and patients/persons served \npopulation continues to be of paramount importance. As a reminder, steps that you can take to \nprevent the spread of germs and protect yourself include: \n \n  Avoid  unnecessary  contact  with  other  patients/persons  served  to  as  great  an  extent  as \npossible, i.e. handshaking, hugs, etc. \n  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. \n  Alert a staff member immediately if you are feeling ill. \n  Cover your cough or sneeze. \n  Clean and disinfect your cell or living area with soap and water or cleaning products regularly. \n  Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to \nthe bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.  If you need \nmore soap, please ask unit staff. \n \nAdditionally: \n \n  While on modified status, you will receive food and medication in your housing units.  You will \nhave an opportunity to shower, clean your room and use the telephone, comfort rooms, and \nExhibit 12.1\n\ntreatment rooms on a rotating basis.  Laundry, mail, forensic evaluations and other required \nservices will not be interrupted. \n \nYou should self-monitor for symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, tiredness or shortness of breath).  If you \nhave symptoms associated with COVID-19, you should immediately alert correctional staff or a health \ncare provider. \n \nThank you for your anticipated cooperation during this very difficult time. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nExhibit 12.2\n\n \nThe Commonwealth of Massachusetts \n \nExecutive Office of Public Safety and Security   \n \nOne Ashburton Place, Room 2133   \n \nBoston, Massachusetts 02108 \n \n  Tel:  (617) 727-7775   \n  TTY Tel:  (617) 727-6618   \nCHARLES D.

Priority testing is critical to ensuring their safety and the \nwell-being of the people we serve. \n \nAs you know, the first priority testing site opened on Sunday at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough.  \nThis site will continue to operate from 9:00am to 5:00 pm, seven days per week.  Beginning on \nThursday, April 9, however, it will expand its services to asymptomatic personnel.  Members of \nyour agency will not need to be showing symptoms to be tested. \n \nAlso on April 9, we will open a second public safety priority testing site at the Big E fairgrounds in \nWest Springfield.  Like the Foxborough site, it will operate from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, seven days per \nweek, and will provide COVID-19 testing for public safety personnel, regardless of whether they \nare showing symptoms. \n \nEach site will conduct up to 200 tests per day.  Due to ongoing demand, this service will remain \navailable by appointment only, and appointments must still be scheduled by the chief executive of \nyour department or his/her designee.  Please ensure that your staff, including your designee, are \naware of this requirement.  The call center is currently scheduling appointments for the \nFoxborough site and will begin scheduling appointments for West Springfield on Wednesday, April \n8.  \n \nWe are deeply grateful to The Big E, Brewster Ambulance Service, the Department of Correction, \nthe Department of Fire Services, the New England Patriots, the New England Revolution, Wellpath, \nand Quest Diagnostics for their assistance as we expand this important service.  \n \n              Sincerely, \n \n              Tom Turco \n              Secretary of Public Safety and Security \nEOPSS Update 04.07.20 \n \nExhibit 14.1\n\n \nThe Commonwealth of Massachusetts \n \n \nExecutive Office of Public Safety and Security \n \n \nOne Ashburton Place, Room 2133 \n \nBoston, Massachusetts 02108   \n \n  Tel:  (617) 727-7775   \n  TTY Tel:  (617) 727-6618   \n  Fax:  (617) 727-4764  Thomas Turco \nCHARLES D.

Mici, Commissioner   \n \nDA:  April 24, 2020 \n \nRE:   Mobile Testing Units (COVID-19) \n \nAs we all continue to battle the impact that COVID-19 has had on both our professional and personal lives, \nI want you to know I am committed to working collaboratively with all employees, Unions, and vendor \nstaff throughout the agency. I continue to update the entrance screening form based upon nationally \naccepted practices for law enforcement agencies in order to appropriately screen all persons entering a \ncorrectional facility or other DOC building. \n \nThis week, the DOC began utilizing Mobile Testing Units in conjunction with the Department of Fire \nServices, Brewster Ambulance and Wellpath. The Mobile Testing Unit started at MCI Framingham and \nSouth Middlesex Correctional Center and will move to MCI Shirley starting Saturday, April 25, 2020 and \nthen the Massachusetts Treatment Center towards the end of next week.  The DOC is working with \nWellpath to strategically plan mobile testing at other sites as appropriate. Testing is for all staff and \ninmates; staff will be tested in a designated area in the facility, while inmates will be tested within their \nunits. I strongly urge you to avail yourself of this opportunity to be tested.  Each employee’s results are \nconfidential and there is no cost to you. The agency continues to study the evolution and effects of this \nvirus.  The  infection  can  be  spread  by  people  who  are  asymptomatic;  therefore,  any  one  of  us  can \nunknowingly spread the virus to co-workers, family and friends, and the inmate population.  \n \nPlease continue to adhere to the requirement of wearing PPE’s within the facilities or anytime you are \nwithin six feet of others, regardless of your work location within the agency. \n \nAll of these changes will go a long way to deter the spread of this insidious infection. \n \nI thank you for your professionalism, dedication and your anticipated cooperation as we work together to \nminimize the impact of this virus. \n \n \n \nExhibit 15.1\n\nVERBAL SCREENING AND SELF-TEMPERATURE CHECK PROTOCOLS \n \n \nName: ______________________________ Employee/Visitor/Vendor/Other:        \n \nAffiliation: _________________________________ Date of Visit: _________ Time: ________     \n   \nBased upon the Centers for Disease Control Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus \nDisease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities the following is required. \n \n  Vigorous hand washing \n  Social Distancing \n  Wearing of masks by all employees and visitors at all times. \n \nGuidance from the CDC recommends that all personnel self-monitor twice daily (both on and off \nduty) to identify any potential signs or symptoms.  \n \n \n1.)

17.7\n\nInfection Control Practices \n \nInterim Infection Prevention and Control \nRecommendations for Patients with Known \nor Patients Under Investigation for 2019 \nNovel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in a \nHealthcare Setting \nRelated Pages \nBackground \nInfection control procedures including administrative rules and engineering controls, \nenvironmental hygiene, correct work practices, and appropriate use of personal protective \nequipment (PPE) are all necessary to prevent infections from spreading during healthcare \ndelivery. Prompt detection and effective triage and isolation of potentially infectious patients are \nessential to prevent unnecessary exposures among patients, healthcare personnel, and visitors at \nthe facility. All healthcare facilities must ensure that their personnel are correctly trained and \ncapable of implementing infection control procedures; individual healthcare personnel should \nensure they understand and can adhere to infection control requirements. \nThis guidance is based on the currently limited information available about 2019-nCoV related \nto disease severity, transmission efficiency, and shedding duration. This cautious approach will \nbe refined and updated as more information becomes available and as response needs change in \nthe United States. This guidance is applicable to all U.S. healthcare settings. This guidance is \nnot intended for non-healthcare settings (e.g., schools) OR to persons outside of healthcare \nsettings. For recommendations regarding clinical management, air or ground medical transport, \nor laboratory settings, refer to the main CDC 2019-nCoV website. \nDefinition of Healthcare Personnel (HCP) – For the purposes of this guidance, HCP refers to \nall persons, paid and unpaid, working in healthcare settings engaged in patient care activities, \nincluding: patient assessment for triage, entering examination rooms or patient rooms to provide \ncare or clean and disinfect the environment, obtaining clinical specimens, handling soiled \nmedical supplies or equipment, and coming in contact with potentially contaminated \nenvironmental surfaces. \n \n \nExhibit 17.8\n\nRecommendations \n1. Minimize Chance for Exposures \nEnsure facility policies and practices are in place to minimize exposures to respiratory pathogens \nincluding 2019-nCoV. Measures should be implemented before patient arrival, upon arrival, and \nthroughout the duration of the affected patient’s presence in the healthcare setting. \n  Before Arrival  \no  When scheduling appointments, instruct patients and persons who accompany \nthem to call ahead or inform HCP upon arrival if they have symptoms of any \nrespiratory infection (e.g., cough, runny nose, fever1) and to take appropriate \npreventive actions (e.g., wear a facemask upon entry to contain cough, follow \ntriage procedures). \no  If a patient is arriving via transport by emergency medical services (EMS), the \ndriver should contact the receiving emergency department (ED) or healthcare \nfacility and follow previously agreed upon local or regional transport protocols. \nThis will allow the healthcare facility to prepare for receipt of the patient. \n  \n  Upon Arrival and During the Visit  \no  Take steps to ensure all persons with symptoms of suspected 2019-nCoV or other \nrespiratory infection (e.g., fever, cough) adhere to respiratory hygiene and cough \netiquette, hand hygiene, and triage procedures throughout the duration of the visit. \nConsider posting visual alerts (e.g., signs, posters) at the entrance and in strategic \nplaces (e.g., waiting areas, elevators, cafeterias) to provide patients and HCP with \ninstructions (in appropriate languages) about hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, \nand cough etiquette. Instructions should include how to use facemasks (See \ndefinition of facemask in Appendix) or tissues to cover nose and mouth when \ncoughing or sneezing, to dispose of tissues and contaminated items in waste \nreceptacles, and how and when to perform hand hygiene. \no  Ensure that patients with symptoms of suspected 2019-nCoV or other respiratory \ninfection (e.g., fever, cough) are not allowed to wait among other patients seeking \ncare.  Identify a separate, well-ventilated space that allows waiting patients to be \nseparated by 6 or more feet, with easy access to respiratory hygiene supplies. In \nsome settings, patients might opt to wait in a personal vehicle or outside the \nhealthcare facility where they can be contacted by mobile phone when it is their \nturn to be evaluated. \no  Ensure rapid triage and isolation of patients with symptoms of suspected 2019-\nnCoV or other respiratory infection (e.g., fever, cough):  \n  Identify patients at risk for having 2019-nCoV infection before or \nimmediately upon arrival to the healthcare facility. \n  Implement triage procedures to detect patients under investigation (PUI) for 2019-\nnCoV during or before patient triage or registration (e.g., at the time of patient check-in) \nExhibit 17.9\n\nand ensure that all patients are asked about the presence of symptoms of a respiratory \ninfection and history of travel to areas experiencing transmission of 2019-nCoV or \ncontact with possible 2019-nCoV patients. \n   \no   \n  Implement respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette (i.e., placing a \nfacemask over the patient’s nose and mouth if that has not already been \ndone) and isolate the PUI for 2019-nCoV in an Airborne Infection \nIsolation Room (AIIR), if available. See recommendations for “Patient \nPlacement” below. Additional guidance for evaluating patients in U.S. for \n2019-nCoV infection can be found on the CDC 2019-nCoV website. \n  Inform infection prevention and control services, local and state public \nhealth authorities, and other healthcare facility staff as appropriate about \nthe presence of a patient under investigation for 2019-nCoV. \no  Provide supplies for respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette, including 60%-95% \nalcohol-based hand rub (ABHR), tissues, no touch receptacles for disposal, and \nfacemasks at healthcare facility entrances, waiting rooms, patient check-ins, etc. \n2. Adherence to Standard, Contact and Airborne Precautions, Including the Use \nof Eye Protection \nStandard Precautions assume that every person is potentially infected or colonized with a \npathogen that could be transmitted in the healthcare setting. Elements of Standard Precautions \nthat apply to patients with respiratory infections, including those caused by 2019-nCoV, are \nsummarized below. Attention should be paid to training and proper donning (putting on), doffing \n(taking off), and disposal of any PPE. This document does not emphasize all aspects of Standard \nPrecautions (e.g., injection safety) that are required for all patient care; the full description is \nprovided in the Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious \nAgents in Healthcare Settings. All HCP (see section 3 for measures for non-HCP visitors) who \nenter the room of a patient with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV should adhere to Standard, \nContact, and Airborne Precautions, including the following: \n  Patient Placement  \no  Place a patient with known or suspected 2019-nCoV (i.e., PUI) in an AIIR that \nhas been constructed and maintained in accordance with current guidelines.  \n  AIIRs are single patient rooms at negative pressure relative to the \nsurrounding areas, and with a minimum of 6 air changes per hour (12 air \nchanges per hour are recommended for new construction or renovation). \nAir from these rooms should be exhausted directly to the outside or be \nfiltered through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter before \nrecirculation. Room doors should be kept closed except when entering or \nleaving the room, and entry and exit should be minimized. Facilities \nshould monitor and document the proper negative-pressure function of \nthese rooms. \nExhibit 17.10\n\n  If an AIIR is not available, the patient should be transferred as soon as is \nfeasible to a facility where an AIIR is available or discharged to home (in \nconsultation with state or local public health authorities) if deemed \nmedically appropriate. Pending transfer, place a facemask on the patient \nand isolate him/her in an examination room with the door closed. The \npatient should not be placed in any room where room exhaust is \nrecirculated within the building without HEPA filtration. \no  Once in an AIIR, the patient’s facemask may be removed. Limit transport and \nmovement of the patient outside of the AIIR to medically-essential purposes. \nWhen not in an AIIR (e.g., during transport or if an AIIR is not available), \npatients should wear a facemask to contain secretions. \no  Personnel entering the room should use PPE, including respiratory protection, as \ndescribed below. \no  Only essential personnel should enter the AIIR. Implement staffing policies to \nminimize the number of HCP who enter the room.  \n  Facilities should consider caring for these patients with dedicated HCP to \nminimize risk of transmission and exposure to other patients and other \nHCP. \no  Facilities should keep a log of all persons who care for or enter the rooms or care \narea of these patients. \n  Use dedicated or disposable noncritical patient-care equipment (e.g., blood pressure \ncuffs). If equipment will be used for more than one patient, clean and disinfect such \nequipment before use on another patient according to manufacturer’s instructions. \no  HCP entering the AIIR soon after a patient vacates the room should use \nrespiratory protection. (See personal protective equipment section below) \nStandard practice for pathogens spread by the airborne route (e.g., measles, \ntuberculosis) is to restrict unprotected individuals, including HCP, from entering a \nvacated room until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove \npotentially infectious particles (more information on clearance rates under \ndiffering ventilation conditions is available). We do not yet know how long 2019-\nnCoV remains infectious in the air.  In the interim, it is reasonable to apply a \nsimilar time period before entering the room without respiratory protection as \nused for pathogens spread by the airborne route (e.g., measles, tuberculosis). In \naddition, the room should undergo appropriate cleaning and surface disinfection \nbefore it is returned to routine use. \n  Hand Hygiene  \no  HCP should perform hand hygiene using ABHR before and after all patient \ncontact, contact with potentially infectious material, and before putting on and \nupon removal of PPE, including gloves. Hand hygiene in healthcare settings also \ncan be performed by washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If hands \nare visibly soiled, use soap and water before returning to ABHR. \no  Healthcare facilities should ensure that hand hygiene supplies are readily \navailable to all personnel in every care location. \nExhibit 17.11\n\n  Personal Protective Equipment \nEmployers should select appropriate PPE and provide it to HCP in accordance with \nOSHA’s PPE standards (29 CFR 1910 Subpart I)external icon. HCP must receive \ntraining on and demonstrate an understanding of when to use PPE; what PPE is \nnecessary; how to properly don, use, and doff PPE in a manner to prevent self-\ncontamination; how to properly dispose of or disinfect and maintain PPE; and the \nlimitations of PPE. Any reusable PPE must be properly cleaned, decontaminated, and \nmaintained after and between uses. Facilities should have policies and procedures \ndescribing a recommended sequence for safely donning and doffing PPE:  \no  Gloves  \n  Perform hand hygiene, then put on clean, non-sterile gloves upon entry \ninto the patient room or care area. Change gloves if they become torn or \nheavily contaminated. \n  Remove and discard gloves when leaving the patient room or care area, \nand immediately perform hand hygiene. \no  Gowns  \n  Put on a clean disposable gown upon entry into the patient room or area. \nChange the gown if it becomes soiled. Remove and discard the gown \nbefore leaving the patient room or care area. \no  Respiratory Protection  \n  Use respiratory protection (i.e., a respirator) that is at least as protective as \na fit-tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator \nbefore entry into the patient room or care area. See appendix for respirator \ndefinition. \n  Disposable respirators should be removed and discarded after exiting the \npatient’s room or care area and closing the door. Perform hand hygiene \nafter discarding the respirator. \n  If reusable respirators (e.g., powered air purifying respirator/PAPR) are \nused, they must be cleaned and disinfected according to manufacturer’s \nreprocessing instructions prior to re-use. \n  Respirator use must be in the context of a complete respiratory protection \nprogram in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration (OSHA) Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR \n1910.134external icon). Staff should be medically cleared and fit-tested if \nusing respirators with tight-fitting facepieces (e.g., a NIOSH-certified \ndisposable N95) and trained in the proper use of respirators, safe removal \nand disposal, and medical contraindications to respirator use. \no  Eye Protection  \n  Put on eye protection (e.g., goggles, a disposable face shield that covers \nthe front and sides of the face) upon entry to the patient room or care area. \nRemove eye protection before leaving the patient room or care area. \nReusable eye protection (e.g., goggles) must be cleaned and disinfected \naccording to manufacturer’s reprocessing instructions prior to re-\nuse.  Disposable eye protection should be discarded after use. \n \nExhibit 17.12\n\n  Use Caution When Performing Aerosol-Generating Procedures  \no  Some procedures performed on 2019-nCoV patients could generate infectious \naerosols. In particular, procedures that are likely to induce coughing; e.g., \nnasopharyngeal specimen collection, sputum induction, and open suctioning of \nairways should be performed cautiously and avoided if possible. \no  If performed, these procedures should take place in an AIIR, and personnel should \nuse respiratory protection as described above. In addition:  \n  Limit the number of HCP present during the procedure to only those \nessential for patient care and procedural support. \n  Clean and disinfect procedure room surfaces promptly as described in the \nsection on environmental infection control below. \n  Duration of Isolation Precautions  \no  Until information is available regarding viral shedding after clinical improvement, \ndiscontinuation of isolation precautions should be determined on a case-by-case \nbasis, in conjunction with local, state, and federal health authorities. \no  Factors that should be considered include: presence of symptoms related to 2019-\nnCoV, date symptoms resolved, other conditions that would require specific \nprecautions (e.g., tuberculosis, Clostridioides difficile), other laboratory \ninformation reflecting clinical status, alternatives to inpatient isolation, such as the \npossibility of safe recovery at home. \n3. Manage Visitor Access and Movement Within the Facility \n  Establish procedures for monitoring, managing and training visitors. \n  Restrict visitors from entering the room of known or suspected 2019-nCoV patients (i.e., \nPUI). Alternative mechanisms for patient and visitor interactions, such as video-call \napplications on cell phones or tablets should be explored. Facilities can consider \nexceptions based on end-of-life situations or when a visitor is essential for the patient’s \nemotional well-being and care. \n  Visitors to known or suspected 2019-nCoV (i.e., PUI) patients should be scheduled and \ncontrolled to allow for:  \no  Screening visitors for symptoms of acute respiratory illness before entering the \nhealthcare facility. \no  Facilities should evaluate risk to the health of the visitor (e.g., visitor might have \nunderlying illness putting them at higher risk for 2019-nCoV) and ability to \ncomply with precautions. \no  Facilities should provide instruction, before visitors enter patients’ rooms, on \nhand hygiene, limiting surfaces touched, and use of PPE according to current \nfacility policy while in the patient’s room. \no  Facilities should maintain a record (e.g., log book) of all visitors who enter patient \nrooms. \no  Visitors should not be present during aerosol-generating procedures. \no  Visitors should be instructed to limit their movement within the facility. \no  Exposed visitors (e.g., contact with symptomatic 2019-nCoV patient prior to \nadmission) should be advised to report any signs and symptoms of acute illness to \nExhibit 17.13\n\ntheir health care provider for a period of at least 14 days after the last known \nexposure to the sick patient. \n  All visitors should follow respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette precautions while in \nthe common areas of the facility. \n4. Implement Engineering Controls \n  Consider designing and installing engineering controls to reduce or eliminate exposures \nby shielding HCP and other patients from infected individuals. Examples of engineering \ncontrols include physical barriers or partitions to guide patients through triage areas, \ncurtains between patients in shared areas, closed suctioning systems for airway suctioning \nfor intubated patients, as well as appropriate air-handling systems (with appropriate \ndirectionality, filtration, exchange rate, etc.) that are installed and properly maintained. \n5. Monitor and Manage Ill and Exposed Healthcare Personnel \n  Movement and monitoring decisions for HCP with exposure to 2019-nCoV should be \nmade in consultation with public health authorities. \n  Facilities and organizations providing healthcare should implement sick leave policies for \nHCP that are non-punitive, flexible, and consistent with public health guidance. \n 6. Train and Educate Healthcare Personnel \n  Provide HCP with job- or task-specific education and training on preventing transmission \nof infectious agents, including refresher training. \n  HCP must be medically cleared, trained, and fit tested for respiratory protection device \nuse (e.g., N95 filtering facepiece respirators), or medically cleared and trained in the use \nof an alternative respiratory protection device (e.g., Powered Air-Purifying Respirator, \nPAPR) whenever respirators are required. OSHA has a number of respiratory training \nvideosexternal icon. \n  Ensure that HCP are educated, trained, and have practiced the appropriate use of PPE \nprior to caring for a patient, including attention to correct use of PPE and prevention of \ncontamination of clothing, skin, and environment during the process of removing such \nequipment. \n7. Implement Environmental Infection Control \n  Dedicated medical equipment should be used for patient care. \n  All non-dedicated, non-disposable medical equipment used for patient care should be \ncleaned and disinfected according to manufacturer’s instructions and facility policies. \n  Ensure that environmental cleaning and disinfection procedures are followed consistently \nand correctly. \n  Routine cleaning and disinfection procedures (e.g., using cleaners and water to pre-clean \nsurfaces prior to applying an EPA-registered, hospital-grade disinfectant to frequently \ntouched surfaces or objects for appropriate contact times as indicated on the product’s \nExhibit 17.14\n\nlabel) are appropriate for 2019-nCoV in healthcare settings, including those patient-care \nareas in which aerosol-generating procedures are performed. Products with EPA-\napproved emerging viral pathogens claims are recommended for use against 2019-nCoV. \nThese products can be identified by the following claim:  \no  “[Product name] has demonstrated effectiveness against viruses similar to 2019-\nnCoV on hard non-porous surfaces. Therefore, this product can be used against \n2019-nCoV when used in accordance with the directions for use against [name of \nsupporting virus] on hard, non-porous surfaces.” \n   \no  This claim or a similar claim, will be made only through the following \ncommunications outlets: technical literature distributed exclusively to health care \nfacilities, physicians, nurses and public health officials, “1-800” consumer \ninformation services, social media sites and company websites (non-label related). \nSpecific claims for “2019-nCoV” will not appear on the product or master label. \no  Additional information about EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims can \nbe found here: https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/guidance-registrants-\nprocess-making-claims-against-emerging-viral-pathogensexternal icon \n   \no  If there are no available EPA-registered products that have an approved emerging \nviral pathogen claim for 2019-nCoV, products with label claims against human \ncoronaviruses should be used according to label instructions. \n  Management of laundry, food service utensils, and medical waste should also be \nperformed in accordance with routine procedures. \n  Detailed information on environmental infection control in healthcare settings can be \nfound in CDC’s Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities \nand Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in \nHealthcare Settings [section IV.F. Care of the environment]. \n8. Establish Reporting within Healthcare Facilities and to Public Health \nAuthorities \n  Implement mechanisms and policies that promptly alert key facility staff including \ninfection control, healthcare epidemiology, facility leadership, occupational health, \nclinical laboratory, and frontline staff about known or suspected 2019-nCoV patients \n(i.e., PUI). \n  Communicate and collaborate with public health authorities.  \no  Promptly notify state or local public health authorities of known or suspected \n2019-nCoV patients (i.e., PUI). Facilities should designate specific persons within \nthe healthcare facility who are responsible for communication with public health \nofficials and dissemination of information to HCP. \nAppendix: Additional Information about Respirators and Facemasks \nInformation about Respirators: \nExhibit 17.15\n\n  A respirator is a personal protective device that is worn on the face, covers at least the \nnose and mouth, and is used to reduce the wearer’s risk of inhaling hazardous airborne \nparticles (including dust particles and infectious agents), gases, or vapors. Respirators are \ncertified by the CDC/NIOSH, including those intended for use in healthcare. \n  Respirator use must be in the context of a complete respiratory protection program in \naccordance with OSHA Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134external icon). \nHCP should be medically cleared and fit-tested if using respirators with tight-fitting \nfacepieces (e.g., a NIOSH-approved N95 respirator) and trained in the proper use of \nrespirators, safe removal and disposal, and medical contraindications to respirator use. \n  NIOSH information about respirators \n  OSHA Respiratory Protection eToolexternal icon \nFiltering Facepiece Respirators (FFR) including N95 Respirators \n  A commonly used respirator is a filtering facepiece respirator (commonly referred to as \nan N95). Filtering facepiece respirators are disposable half facepiece respirators that filter \nout particles. \n  To work properly, FFRs must be worn throughout the period of exposure and be specially \nfitted for each person who wears one (this is called “fit-testing” and is usually done in a \nworkplace where respirators are used). \n  Three key factors for an N95 respirator to be effective: \n(https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/KeyFactorsRequiedResp01042018-508.pdfpdf \nicon) \n  FFR users should also perform a user seal check to ensure proper fit each time an FFR is \nused. \n  For more information on how to perform a user seal check: \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2018-130/pdfs/2018-\n130.pdf?id=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2018130pdf icon \nA list of NIOSH-approved N95 respirators is located \nhere:  https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/n95list1.html \nPowered Air-Purifying Respirators (PAPRs) \n  Powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) have a battery-powered blower that pulls air \nthrough attached filters, canisters, or cartridges. They provide protection against gases, \nvapors, or particles, when equipped with the appropriate cartridge, canister, or filter. \n  Loose-fitting PAPRs do not require fit testing and can be used with facial hair. \n  A list of NIOSH-approved PAPRs is located on the NIOSH Certified Equipment List: \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/cel/ \nInformation about Facemasks: \n  If worn properly, a facemask helps block respiratory secretions produced by the wearer \nfrom contaminating other persons and surfaces (often called source control). \nExhibit 17.16\n\n  Facemasks are cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as \nmedical devices. Facemasks should be used once and then thrown away in the trash. \n \n \n \n \n \nInfection/Condition  Type of Precaution  Duration of Precaution  Precautions/Comments\nSARS  Airborne +  Duration of illness plus  Airborne preferred; \nDroplet +  10 days after resolution  Droplet if Negative \nContact +  of fever, provided  Pressure Room \nStandard  respiratory symptoms  unavailable.  N95 mask \nare absent or  or higher respiratory \nimproving.  protection; surgical \nmask if N95 \nunavailable; eye \nprotection (goggles, \nface shield); aerosol‐\ngenerating procedures \nand “supershedders” \nhighest risk for \ntransmission via small \ndroplet nuclei and large \ndroplets \n \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.  \nwww.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/appendix/index.html \nAccessed 1/28/2020 \nExhibit 17.17\n\n \n \n \n                                                                April 23, 2020 \nUpdated recommendations for clearing patients from \nisolation for confirmed or suspected COVID19 infection: \n   \nIn departure from CDC guidelines, we recommend longer isolation of inmates diagnosed with COVID19 \nbefore returning them to general population. Our own testing has shown that returning patients to \ngeneral population after just 72 hours of normal temperature as the CDC had recommended would not \nbe adequate. Currently our plan is to manage inmates diagnosed with COVID19 as follows:  \n  Afebrile (99.0 or below) for seven consecutive days, unless immunocompromised \no  AND \n  Resolution of cough, headache, myalgia, and malaise \n  Onset of symptoms at least 14 days ago \nTHEN:  test again for COVID19. \n  If negative, clear patient to general population \n  If still positive, keep the patient in isolation for another 7 days \n  Retest at day 21 \nIf negative, clear the patient to general population. \nIf still positive, keep the patient in isolation for another 7 days \n  Retest at day 28 \nETC \nAt this time, we do not recommend clearing any patient to general population unless a negative test has \nbeen achieved.  \nBefore moving any patient with a negative result back to general population, \nplease consult with your site’s ID case manager. \nThank you, \n \nSteven Descoteaux MD \nStatewide Medical Director \nWellpath \nExhibit 18.1\n\nwellpath  \n \nMental Health Protocol for COVID‐19 Notification \n \n1.

(a) As used in this section, the following words shall have the \nfollowing meanings unless the context clearly requires otherwise:—  \n''Medical parole plan'', a comprehensive written medical and psychosocial care \nplan specific to a prisoner and including, but not limited to: (i) the proposed \ncourse of treatment; (ii) the proposed site for treatment and post-treatment care; \n(iii) documentation that medical providers qualified to provide the medical \nservices identified in the medical parole plan are prepared to provide such \nservices; and (iv) the financial program in place to cover the cost of the plan for \nthe duration of the medical parole, which shall include eligibility for enrollment \nin commercial insurance, Medicare or Medicaid or access to other adequate \nfinancial resources for the duration of the medical parole.  \n''Department'', the department of correction.  \n''Permanent incapacitation'', a physical or cognitive incapacitation that appears \nirreversible, as determined by a licensed physician, and that is so debilitating \nthat the prisoner does not pose a public safety risk.  \n''Secretary'', the secretary of the executive office of public safety and security.  \n''Terminal illness'', a condition that appears incurable, as determined by a \nlicensed physician, that will likely cause the death of the prisoner in not more \nthan 18 months and that is so debilitating that the prisoner does not pose a \npublic safety risk.  \n(b) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, a prisoner may \nbe eligible for medical parole due to a terminal illness or permanent \nincapacitation pursuant to subsections (c) and (d).  \nExhibit 21.1\n\n(c)(1) The superintendent of a correctional facility shall consider a prisoner for \nmedical parole upon a written petition by the prisoner, the prisoner's attorney, \nthe prisoner's next of kin, a medical provider of the correctional facility or a \nmember of the department's staff. The superintendent shall review the petition \nand develop a recommendation as to the release of the prisoner. Whether or not \nthe superintendent recommends in favor of medical parole, the superintendent \nshall, not more than 21 days after receipt of the petition, transmit the petition \nand the recommendation to the commissioner. The superintendent shall transmit \nwith the recommendation: (i) a medical parole plan; (ii) a written diagnosis by a \nphysician licensed to practice medicine under section 2 of chapter 112; and (iii) \nan assessment of the risk for violence that the prisoner poses to society.  \n(2) Upon receipt of the petition and recommendation pursuant to paragraph (1), \nthe commissioner shall notify, in writing, the district attorney for the jurisdiction \nwhere the offense resulting in the prisoner being committed to the correctional \nfacility occurred, the prisoner, the person who petitioned for medical parole, if \nnot the prisoner and, if applicable under chapter 258B, the victim or the victim's \nfamily that the prisoner is being considered for medical parole. The parties who \nreceive the notice shall have an opportunity to provide written statements; \nprovided, however, that if the prisoner was convicted and is serving a sentence \nunder section 1 of chapter 265, the district attorney or victim's family may \nrequest a hearing.  \n(d)(1) A sheriff shall consider a prisoner for medical parole upon a written \npetition filed by the prisoner, the prisoner's attorney, the prisoner's next of kin, a \nmedical provider of the house of correction or jail or a member of the sheriff's \nstaff. The sheriff shall review the request and develop a recommendation as to \nthe release of the prisoner. Whether or not the sheriff recommends in favor of \nmedical parole, the sheriff shall, not more than 21 days after receipt of the \npetition, transmit the petition and the recommendation to the commissioner. The \nsheriff shall transmit with the petition: (i) a medical parole plan; (ii) a written \ndiagnosis by a physician licensed to practice medicine under section 2 of \nchapter 112; and (iii) an assessment of the risk for violence that the prisoner \nposes to society.  \nExhibit 21.2\n\n(2) Upon receipt of the petition and recommendation pursuant to paragraph (1), \nthe commissioner shall notify, in writing, the district attorney for the jurisdiction \nwhere the offense resulting in the prisoner being committed to the correctional \nfacility occurred, the prisoner, the person who petitioned for medical parole, if \nnot the prisoner and, if applicable under chapter 258B, the victim or the victim's \nfamily that the prisoner is being considered for medical parole. The parties who \nreceive the notice shall have an opportunity to submit written statements.  \n(e) The commissioner shall issue a written decision not later than 45 days after \nreceipt of a petition, which shall be accompanied by a statement of reasons for \nthe commissioner's decision. If the commissioner determines that a prisoner is \nterminally ill or permanently incapacitated such that if the prisoner is released \nthe prisoner will live and remain at liberty without violating the law and that the \nrelease will not be incompatible with the welfare of society, the prisoner shall be \nreleased on medical parole. The parole board shall impose terms and conditions \nfor medical parole that shall apply through the date upon which the prisoner's \nsentence would have expired.  \nNot less than 24 hours before the date of a prisoner's release on medical parole, \nthe commissioner shall notify, in writing, the district attorney for the jurisdiction \nwhere the offense resulting in the prisoner being committed to the correctional \nfacility occurred, the department of state police, the police department in the \ncity or town in which the prisoner shall reside and, if applicable under chapter \n258B, the victim or the victim's family of the prisoner's release and the terms \nand conditions of the release.  \n(f) A prisoner granted release under this section shall be under the jurisdiction, \nsupervision and control of the parole board, as if the prisoner had been paroled \npursuant to section 130 of chapter 127. The parole board may revise, alter or \namend the terms and conditions of a medical parole at any time. If a parole \nofficer receives credible information that a prisoner has failed to comply with a \ncondition of the prisoner's medical parole or upon discovery that the terminal \nillness or permanent incapacitation has improved to the extent that the prisoner \nwould no longer be eligible for medical parole under this section, the parole \nofficer shall immediately arrest the prisoner and bring the prisoner before the \nboard for a hearing. If the board determines that the prisoner violated a \nExhibit 21.3\n\ncondition of the prisoner's medical parole or that the terminal illness or \npermanent incapacitation has improved to the extent that the prisoner would no \nlonger be eligible for medical parole pursuant to this section, the prisoner shall \nresume serving the balance of the sentence with credit given only for the \nduration of the prisoner's medical parole that was served in compliance with all \nconditions of their medical parole pursuant to subsection (e). Revocation of a \nprisoner's medical parole due to a change in the prisoner's medical condition \nshall not preclude a prisoner's eligibility for medical parole in the future or for \nanother form of release permitted by law.  \n(g) A prisoner, sheriff or superintendent aggrieved by a decision denying or \ngranting medical parole made under this section may petition for relief pursuant \nto section 4 of chapter 249. A decision by the court affirming or reversing the \ncommissioner's grant or denial of medical parole shall not affect a prisoner's \neligibility for any other form of release permitted by law. A decision by the \ncourt pursuant to this subsection shall not preclude a prisoner's eligibility for \nmedical parole in the future.  \n(h) The secretary shall promulgate rules and regulations necessary for the \nenforcement and administration of this section.  \n(i) The commissioner and the secretary shall file an annual report not later than \nMarch 1 with the clerks of the senate and the house of representatives, the \nsenate and house committees on ways and means and the joint committee on the \njudiciary detailing, for the prior fiscal year: (i) the number of prisoners in the \ncustody of the department or of the sheriffs who applied for medical parole \nunder this section and the race and ethnicity of each applicant; (ii) the number of \nprisoners who have been granted medical parole and the race and ethnicity of \neach prisoner; (iii) the nature of the illness of the applicants for medical parole; \n(iv) the counties to which the prisoners have been released; (v) the number of \nprisoners who have been denied medical parole, the reason for the denial and \nthe race and ethnicity of each prisoner; (vi) the number of prisoners who have \npetitioned for medical parole more than once; (vii) the number of prisoners \nreleased who have been returned to the custody of the department or the sheriff \nand the reason for each prisoner's return; and (viii) the number of petitions for \nExhibit 21.4\n\nrelief sought pursuant to subsection (g).

Be  aware  of  situations  that  make  you  feel \nuncomfortable.    Trust your instincts. \n \n2.  If  something  feels  wrong  about  the  environment  or \nsituation you find yourself in, leave the area. \n \n3.  Don’t let your manners get in the way of keeping you \nsafe.  Don’t be afraid to say ‘NO!” “Stop it now,” or \n“Get lost!” \n \n4.  Walk and stand with confidence.  Many rapists choose \nvictims  who  look  like  they  won’t  fight  back  or  are \nemotionally weak.  Keep your head up and don’t avoid \neye contact. \n \n5.  Avoid  talking  about  sex  and  casual  nudity.    These \nthings  may  be  viewed  as  a  come-on  or  make  another \ninmate  believe  you  have  an  interest  in  a  sexual \nrelationship. \n \nAugust 2019    401 - 23 \nExhibit 22.24\n\n6.  Do not accept any food, clothing, or other gifts from \nother  inmates.    Being  in  debt  to  another  inmate  may \nlead to the expectation that you will repay the debt \nwith sex. \n \n7.  Avoid  secluded  areas  like  closets,  storage  areas, \nstairwells, isolated showers or unoccupied bathrooms.  \nPosition yourself in plain view of staff members. \n \n8.  If you are being pressured for sex, talk to a staff \nmember immediately. \n \n9.  If  you  become  aware  that  another  inmate  is  being \nsexually  abused,  report  it  to  a  staff  member.    Next \ntime it could be you. \n \n10.  Beware  of  inmates  who  offer  to  protect  you.  \nProtection frequently has a cost. \n \n11.  Do  not  give  out  information  about  your  family, \nfriends, or financial support. \n \n12.  Do not buy large quantities of canteen items. \nAugust 2019    401 - 24 \nExhibit 22.25\n\nAdjunto II \n \nACTO DE ELIMINACION DE VIOLACION EN PRISION \n(PRISON RAPE ELIMINATION ACT, PREA) \nMALA CONDUCTA SEXUAL/MALA CONDUCTA SEXUAL DEL PERSONAL \n \n \nA)   El Acto de Eliminación de Violación en Prisión conocido de \notra  manera  como  PREA    es  un  estatuto  Federal  que  fue \npasado unánimemente por el Congreso de los Estados Unidos y \nfirmado  como  ley  en  el  2003  por  el  Presidente  George  W. \nBush.

No  acepte  ningún  alimento,  vestuario,  u  otro  regalo  de \notros presos(as). Estar en deuda con otro preso(a) puede \nconducir a la expectación que usted pagará la deuda con \nsexo. \n \n7. Evite áreas aisladas como closets, áreas de almacenaje,  \nescaleras,  duchas  aisladas  o  baños  no  ocupados. \nPosiciónese a sí mismo(a) a plena vista de miembros del \npersonal. \n \n8. Si  usted  está  siendo  presionado(a)    por  sexo,  converse \ninmediatamente con un miembro del personal. \n \n9. Si  usted  se  da  cuenta  que  otro  preso(a)  está  siendo \nsexualmente  abusado(a),  repórtelo  a  un  miembro  del \npersonal. La próxima vez podría ser usted. \n \n10.  Tenga  cuidado  con  presos(as)  que  se  ofrecen  para \nprotegerlo(a). Protección frecuentemente tiene un costo. \n \nAugust 2019    401 - 29 \nExhibit 22.30\n\n11.  No  de  información  acerca  de  su  familia,  amigos,  o \napoyo financiero. \n \n12.

The provision of these services shall \nbe  outlined  in  procedures  written  by  the  contractual \nmedical  provider  that  meet  the  specifications  of \nDepartment  policies  103  DOC  604,  Outside  Hospital \nRelations, and 103 DOC 105, Department Duty Officer. \n \n2.  Each facility shall use the designation \"Code 99\" whenever \na life-threatening emergency exists. Each facility shall \nhave  a  written  Code  99  Procedure  applicable  to  its \nfacility as required by 103 DOC 622, Death Procedures. An \nemergency “Code 99\" or “red bag” will be available in HSUs \nfor  all  emergency  responses.  (See  attachment  E  for \nrequired contents of the Red Bag.) \n \n3.  The  Department's  Medical  Disaster  Plan  (see  103  DOC \n560.04) shall be implemented upon the authority of the \nDirector of Health Services, when s/he is notified by the \nCommissioner that a state of emergency has been declared.  \n \na.

Each facility is responsible to have a disaster box \nreadily available should a medical disaster occur. \nThe disaster box must be built for easy transport to \nany  area  of  the  facility.  It  will  be  sealed  and \nlocated in a secure, strategic and easily accessible \narea outside the medical unit. This box is to be \nopened  only  for  disasters,  drills  and  restocking \ncontents. \n \nThe contractual medical provider will maintain the \ndisaster box. A list of contents will be determined \nby  the  contractual  medical  director.  The  content \nlist, with expiration dates, will be affixed to the \noutside  of  the  disaster  box.  Medical  staff, \naccompanied by security staff, will check the seal \nand expiration dates on a quarterly basis, replacing \nexpired supplies as needed. (See attachment F for \nminimum contents requirements.) \n \n630.16  Intra-System Transfers \n \nThe  contractual  medical  provider  shall  ensure  that  the \ncontinuity and availability of health care is maintained when \ninmates are transferred between facilities. \n \n1.  The  Department's  classification  process  shall  include \nconsideration  of  inmates’  medical  and  mental  health \nstatus. \n \na.

Upon receipt of notification, contractual health and \ncontractual  mental  health  staff  will  initiate  a \nClassification Health Status Report (attachment I) \nby reviewing the medical record. \n \n      At facilities utilizing the Inmate Management System \n(IMS), the Medical Restrictions/Special Needs screen \nshall  be  updated  instead,  including  the  minimum \nhealth care coverage necessary. \n \nc.  If medically indicated the inmate will be examined \nby a psychiatrist or mental health clinician, and/or \nphysician,  physician  assistant  or  nurse \nNovember 2019                    630 - 16 \nExhibit 23.17\n\npractitioner. Current medical data will be obtained \nand reviewed. \n \nd.  At sites not utilizing the Inmate Management System \n(IMS), when all pertinent medical and mental health \ninformation is gathered, the Classification Health \nStatus Report form (attachment I) will be completed \nand sent to the facility classification supervisor \nprior to the scheduled appearance date. \n \n2.  Whenever  feasible  the  designated  contractual  health \nservice personnel shall be notified at least three days \nprior to the transfer of an inmate. \n \nNotification via Inmate Management System (IMS) is made by \nuse of the Notification screen and/or Institution Schedule \nQuery screen under Inter Institution Transfer. \n \n3.  At the time of transfer, each inmate will be accompanied \nby his/her medical record, as set forth in DOC policy 103 \nDOC 607, Medical Records. Also, the sending facility’s \nhealth service staff will make every effort to complete an \nIntra-system  Transfer  form  (attachment  J)  prior  to \ntransfer to send with the medical record. \n \n4.  If an inmate arrives at the receiving facility without the \nappropriate  records  and/or  medications,  the  sending \nfacility’s  health  service  staff  shall  immediately  be \nnotified. \n \n5.   All intra-system transfers shall be screened by health \ntrained or qualified health care personnel immediately \nupon arrival.  An inquiry of whether the inmate is being \ntreated for a medical, dental or a mental health problem \nshall be made.  There shall also be an inquiry as to \nwhether the inmate is presently on medication or whether \nthe  inmate  has  any  current  medical,  dental  or  mental \nhealth complaints.  Observation and listing of findings of \ngeneral behavior, physical deformities or any signs of \ntrauma shall be documented on the Medical Entrance Inquiry \nform  (attachment  K)  or  Intra-system  Transfer  form \n(attachment  J).  A  recommended  disposition  based  on \nobservations, inquiry and findings must also be included \n(i.e.  place  in  general  population,  place  in  general \npopulation  with  appropriate  referral  to  routine  or \nemergency health care services). \n \n    At  facilities  utilizing  the  Inmate  Management  System \n(IMS), disposition shall be updated via the Medical Orders \nNovember 2019                    630 - 17 \nExhibit 23.18\n\nscreen. Additionally, the Mental Health/Substance Abuse \nHistory, Medical Orders, and Medical Restrictions/Special \nNeeds screens shall be updated if necessary. \n \n630.17  Inmates in Segregation \n \nEach facility that maintains a segregation unit shall develop \nwritten procedures that require any inmate in segregation to \nhave access to health care services which are equal to that of \nthe general population. \n \n1.  Inmates who are segregated from the general population for \ndisciplinary  reasons  are  to  be  medically  evaluated  by \nqualified  health  care  personnel  prior  to  placement  in \nsegregation. \n \n  In  IMS,  medical  staff  will  enter  onto  the  SMU  Inmate \nInformation screen the name of the staff person conducting \nthe physical screening and check the applicable button. \nThe  date  of  the  screening  shall  be  entered  into  the \ncomment box by entering, “physical screening on” and the \ndate. \n \n2.  If security status precludes the inmate's attendance at \nsick call at the facility HSU, provisions shall be made \nfor the inmate to be seen by a qualified health care \nprofessional in the segregation unit. \n \n3.  In addition, a qualified health care professional shall \nvisit any facility segregation unit on a daily basis to \ndetermine if there are any unattended medical complaints. \nThese visits shall be recorded in the appropriate medical \nlogbook by medical staff. \n \n  In IMS, the daily visits will be entered on the SMU Daily \nLog screen by security staff. \n \n4.  Periodic  physical  examinations  shall  be  performed  for \ninmates in segregation units in accordance with section \n630.11 of this policy. \n \n5.  All inmates in segregation shall have access to mental \nhealth services pursuant to 103 DOC 650, Mental Health \npolicy. \n \n6.  If qualified health care personnel determine that a  \n  medical condition exists which is a contra-indication to  \nadmission  or  continued  placement  in  segregation,  this \ninformation must be documented in the medical record and \nNovember 2019                    630 - 18 \nExhibit 23.19\n\nimmediately communicated to the superintendent or his/her \ndesignee or shift commander during non-business hours, for \nappropriate action, and to the Health Services Director. \n \n630.18  Use of Therapeutic Restraints \n \nMedical personnel shall utilize restraints pursuant to 103 DOC \n650  Mental  Health  Services  and  only  as  a  last  resort  for \npatients who are determined to be of danger to self or others. \nUnder no circumstances shall therapeutic restraints be used as \na disciplinary measure or as a convenience for facility medical \nstaff. \n \n630.19  Refusal of Treatment at a Department Facility \n \n   Each facility shall have written procedures for circumstances \nin which an inmate decides not to follow the advice of a health \ncare professional.  \n \n1.  The following actions constitute examples of refusal of \ntreatment  by  an  inmate,  but  are  not  limited  to  these \nexamples: \n \na.  Refusal  to  take  medication  prescribed  by  a \ncontractual physician; \nb.  Refusal to keep a medical, dental, or psychiatric \nappointment  recommended  by  a  qualified  health \nprofessional. \n \n2.  Whenever an inmate refuses treatment as defined above, \ns/he  will  sign  a  \"release  of  responsibility”  form \n(attachment L). A qualified health care professional shall \nwitness the inmate’s signature. In the event that the \ninmate refuses to sign the form two staff members shall \nsign the form as witnesses; at least one of whom must be a \nmedical professional. \n \n3.  The completed refusal of treatment form shall be included \nin the inmate's medical record. In all cases of refusal, \ndocumentation shall be written in the progress notes and \non the release of responsibility form that the inmate was \ninformed of the medical risks and possible consequences of \nhis/her refusal. \n \n4.  In  any  refusal  situation  medical,  mental  health  and \nfacility staff should attempt to persuade the inmate to \nconsent to necessary treatment and clearly outline the \nrisks of continued refusals. In most cases, the inmate can \nbe persuaded to consent to treatment. \nNovember 2019                    630 - 19 \nExhibit 23.20\n\n \nThe  Department  and  contractual  medical  provider  shall \ncomply with all applicable statutes relating to informed \nconsent procedures (M.G.L. c.111 §70E). The Department, \nthrough the contractual medical provider, shall ensure \nthat the delivery of all health care is to be preceded by \nan explanation of the nature of such treatment. \n \nIn  such  cases  where  the  inmate  continues  to  refuse \ntreatment and a life threatening emergency does exist, the \nDirector of Health Services, or designee, will contact the \nDOC  Legal  Division  to  seek  a  court  order  for  forced \ntreatment. \n \n5.  When it is deemed by a qualified health care professional \nthat refusal of treatment will result in an immediately \nlife threatening situation, the facility shall notify the \ncontractual physician, on call where applicable, and the \nDirector of Health services or his/her designee. During \nnon-business  hours,  the  facility  shall  notify  the \ncontractual physician on call and the Health Services Duty \nOfficer in accordance with Department policy 103 DOC 105, \nDuty Officer. The Health Service Duty Officer will notify \nthe Director of Health Services. \n \n6.  Discharges from an IHSU cannot occur as a result of a \n“refusal  of  treatment”  by  an  inmate.    A  contractual \nphysician must deem that close observation/monitoring of \nthe medical condition is no longer necessary. \n \n630.20  Refusal of Treatment at an Outside Hospital or Outside Clinic \n \nThe contractual medical provider is responsible for scheduling \nand  arranging  for  outside  hospital  specialty  appointments \nand/or clinic treatment visits for inmates based on a medical \norder. \n \n1.  In  general,  if  an  inmate  wishes  to  refuse  an  outside \nmedical appointment he/she may do so only at the outside \nhospital or clinic (point of service). \n \n2.  Whenever  an  inmate  refuses  treatment  at  an  outside \nhospital,  s/he  will  sign  a  hospital  “release  of \nresponsibility” form as per hospital policy. \n \n  3.  The completed refusal of treatment form shall be included \nin the inmate’s hospital medical record and a copy sent to \nthe Health Services Unit at the receiving prison facility. \n \nNovember 2019                    630 - 20 \nExhibit 23.21\n\n  4.  In  any  refusal  situation  hospital/clinic  medical  and \nmental health staff should attempt to persuade the inmate \nto consent to necessary treatment and clearly outline the \nrisks of continued refusals.   \n \n  5.  In cases where the inmate continues to refuse treatment at \nan outside hospital, the attending or consulting physician \nshall  contact  the  contractual  medical  provider  to \ndetermine an appropriate course of action. \n \n  6.  Each  DOC  facility  shall  have  a  written  policy  for \ncircumstances in which an inmate attempts to refuse an \noutside  hospital/clinic  appointment  prior  to  being \ntransported to the hospital or clinic.  The policy shall \naddress the following: \n \n    a.  Procedures  for  notification  of  on-site  facility \nhealth staff by security staff that an inmate is \nattempting to refuse a scheduled outside appointment \nprior to transport. \n \n    b.  Procedures  for  notification  of  the  responsible \nmedical  director  or  designee  by  on-site  facility \nhealth staff that an inmate is attempting to refuse \nan outside appointment. \n630.21  Release Procedures \n \nWhenever  an  inmate  is  released  from  a  maximum  or  medium \nsecurity  facility,  the  inmate  shall,  whenever  possible,  be \ngiven a physical examination prior to discharge. At a minimum \nsecurity facility, the inmate's medical record will be reviewed \nand a health status report completed. \n \n1.  When an inmate is discharged from a facility with on-site \nmedical staff, a health status report should be completed \nby qualified health care staff, who should explain it \nfully to the inmate being discharged; a copy of the health \nstatus report should be provided to him/her. The original \nhealth  status  report  shall  be  placed  in  the  inmate's \nmedical record. If, after completing the health status \nreport, it is felt that a referral to an outside provider \nis  necessary  to  continue  medical  care  this  shall  be \ndiscussed with the inmate.  \n \n2.  When an inmate is being referred to an outside designated \nhealth  care  provider,  the  inmate  should  sign  an \nauthorization for release of medical records (see 103 DOC \n607, medical records, attachment A & B) and a copy of the \ninmate's medical record should be sent to the provider. \nNovember 2019                    630 - 21 \nExhibit 23.22\n\n \n    At  facilities  utilizing  the  Inmate  Management  System \n(IMS), referral information shall be documented on the \nRelease/Aftercare Plan screen. \n \n3.  Medications for released inmates shall be governed by 103 \nDOC 661, Pharmacy and Medications. \n \n4.  Additional information relative to an inmate’s release may \nbe  found  in  103  DOC  493  Release  and  Lower  Security \nPreparation Program policy. \n \n \nNovember 2019                    630 - 22 \nExhibit 23.23\n\n103 DOC 630 Attachment A \n \n \n \n \nDate \n \n \n \n \n \nDear \n \nEnclosed are release forms which are necessary to request consideration for an on site medical examination by an outside \nphysician in a Massachusetts Department of Correction facility.  Along with these releases it will be necessary for you to return \nto the Director Health Services, a written request for the on site examination stating specifically the nature of the examination \nyou are requesting.  Your request should include the name of the physician as well as his Massachusetts certification number. \n \nThis is also to advise you that only the Department's contractual medical staff determine when outside examinations or testing \nare medically necessary.  However, in accordance with established Health Services procedures, a medical examination on site \nat a facility by an outside physician may be arranged with the permission of the Director of Health Services. If approved, the \noutside physician will be allowed to perform a non-intrusive examination of your client and review his Department of \ncorrection medical record, provided your client signs the necessary release of liability and costs.  Please note that if approved, \nthe cost of such examinations is to be borne by the inmate, not the Department of Correction nor its contractual medical \nprovider. \n  \nFurther, any outside physician must also sign a waiver of liability and costs. Any outside medical consultation reports would be \nreviewed by the on site medical director.  Outside physicians may write their medical recommendations for treatment on \nconsultation forms, but they may not write any medical orders or notes in any part of the medical record.  Further, neither the \nDepartment of Correction nor its contractual medical provider is required to comply with any consultation recommendations \nmade by an outside physician. \n \nBy copy of this letter, the medical director will be made aware of your request for an outside physician examination.  If you \nhave any questions regarding the process, please feel free to contact this office. \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nDirector of Health Services \n \n \n \ncc:    Medical Director, (contractual medical provider) \nHSA, (appropriate facility) \nCounsel, DOC Legal Division \n \n \nNovember 2019                    630 - 23 \nExhibit 23.24\n\n \n103 DOC 630 Attachment B \nMASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION \nHEALTH SERVICES DIVISION \nRELEASE (Physician) \nOutside Medical Services \n \nI, ___________________________, agree to perform or cause to perform the medical services listed \nbelow on______________ an inmate in the custody of the Massachusetts Department of Correction.

I have been employed with the Massachusetts Department of Correction (“Department”) \nsince April of 1986. At present, I am the Assistant Deputy Commissioner (“ADC”) for \nthe Northern Sector, a position I have held since May 6, 2018.      \n2.  I began my employment with the Department as a correction officer and then later rose \nthrough the ranks to the positions of sergeant and lieutenant. I have also served with the \nDepartment in various management positions including as Director of the Central \nTransportation Unit, Director of the Policy Development and Compliance Unit, and as \nthe Deputy Superintendent of Operations at Bridgewater State Hospital, the Deputy \nSuperintendent of Operations at Old Colony Correctional Center, and the Deputy \nSuperintendent at Bay State Correctional Center.  \n3.  The statements contained in this affidavit are based upon my personal knowledge and \nreview of Department of Correction records that are maintained in the normal course of \nbusiness. \nJob Duties and Responsibilities \n4.  The ADC of the Northern Sector is a senior level manager who reports directly to the \n1 \n \n\nDeputy Commissioner of the Prison Division.  \n5.  Generally speaking, the ADC for the Northern Sector is responsible for supervising and \nmanaging the correctional facilities in the Northern Sector. These include: MCI-Concord, \nMCI-Framingham, MCI-Shirley, North Central Correctional Institution, Northeastern \nCorrectional Center, South Middlesex Correctional Center, Lemuel Shattuck Hospital \nCorrectional Unit, and Souza Baranowski Correctional Center.  \n6.  The primary focus of the ADC is to ensure the protection of the public by incarcerating \ncriminal offenders in a safe, secure, humane environment by overall planning, \norganization, direction, and supervision of staff and inmates.  \n7.  The ADC’s goals include establishing consistency in institutional operations, increasing \nefficiency, safety of institutional operations and promoting reintegration efforts. As the \nADC, I identify and resolve issues identified by the Commissioner, and support \nsuperintendents in their efforts to resolve problems common to facility operations.   \nMCI-Framingham \n8.  As discussed above, MCI-Framingham is one of the Northern Sector correctional \nfacilities that I oversee.   \n9.  I am aware that the plaintiffs in this lawsuit make a number of allegations regarding the \nDepartment’s response to COVID-19 at MCI-Framingham.  \n10. All showers at MCI-Framingham are cleaned daily after the last evening count by an \ninmate runner who wears Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) that consists of an N95 \nmask and gloves. In addition, the showers are disinfected after each use, and maintenance \nstaff utilize a Kaivac cleaning machine each week in each housing unit to ensure showers \nare clean at all times. \n2 \n \n\n11. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, staff at MCI-Framingham have been wearing \nproper PPE to minimize the likelihood of them contracting the disease or, conversely, if \nthey are asymptomatic carriers, from passing it on to others.  The Closed Custody Unit \n(CCU) has additional PPE to include gowns/suits and face shields for direct contact. \n12. The Department purchased three (3) bug sprayers for staff at MCI-Framingham to \ndisinfect high touch areas throughout the facility, which is done multiple times per day \nand night.   \n13. MCI-Framingham also supplies staff and inmates with hand sanitizer. \n14. Inmates at MCI-Framingham who were exposed to someone who is being tested for \nCOVID-19 are provided surgical masks and are considered in-cell medical isolation for \nfourteen (14) days in the CCU.  Exposed inmates are allowed out of their cells with \ninmates on the same status only and must wear their mask as a precaution whenever \noutside of their cell. \n15. All inmates in CCU have a surgical mask to wear at all times. Initially, exposed inmates \nin CCU were directed to wear masks whenever they were out of cell, but this has recently \nchanged to at all times. \n16. Inmate cleaning supplies are offered to each inmate every day for proper cell cleaning. A \ntracking sheet is now used to ensure that it is documented whenever an inmate refuses. \n17. All inmates who are double-bunked have been directed to sleep head-to-toe to minimize \nthe risk of spread amongst cellmates. \n18. Staff have offered inmates additional time out of cell and one (1) additional fifteen (15) \nminute phone call per week. This is on top of the other free phone calls that are given to \nall inmates on a weekly basis.  \n3 \n \n\n19. Laundry machines at MCI-Framingham are disinfected after each use, and inmates \nworking in the laundry are provided N95 masks and gloves.  \n20. At least one manager is making a round of housing units daily, including on weekends \nand holidays, to speak with inmates and address any COVID-19 concerns. \n21. Prior to the lockdown, staff at MCI-Framingham released one housing unit at a time for \nmeals in the chow hall to maintain social distancing. Since the facility has been on \nlockdown, all inmates are now fed in their cells. \n22. Since the lockdown, staff have closed the gym and other recreation areas to limit contact \nand encourage social distancing. Inmates are also prohibited from playing table games \nunless in cell with a cellmate prior to the lockdown.  \n23. I am aware that plaintiff Michelle Tourigny makes several allegations in the complaint \nabout the conditions of confinement at MCI-Framingham.  \n24. Ms. Tourigny alleges that she has filed a petition for release on medical parole. \nComplaint at ¶ 19. Ms. Tourigny’s petition for release on medical parole was received by \nthe superintendent’s office. Superintendent Ladouceur has submitted her \nrecommendation on this petition to Commissioner Mici. Commissioner Mici is currently \nin the process of rendering a final decision on this petition pursuant to the medical parole \nstatute, G.L. c. 127, § 119A.  \n25. I am also aware that the complaint contains allegations regarding the number of COVID-\n19 positive inmates incarcerated at MCI-Framingham. Complaint at ¶ 28. To date, sixty \ntwo (62) inmates at MCI-Framingham have tested positive. There have been no positive \nCOVID-19 tests at South Middlesex Correctional Center to date.  \n26. I am aware that the complaint alleges that staff at MCI-Framingham quarantined \n4 \n \n\nindividuals who may have been exposed to COVID-19 in the same housing unit as \nindividuals with confirmed cases. Complaint at ¶ 42.  \n27. The inmate referenced in paragraph 42 of the Complaint was housed in the Health \nServices Unit prior to going to an outside hospital by ambulance. She tested negative at \nthe outside hospital for COVID-19, and upon her return on April 5, 2020, was kept in the \nCCU single cell as a precaution due to her potential COVID exposure at the outside \nhospital. On April 10, 2020, she tested positive for COVID-19. \nMCI-Shirley \n28. As discussed above, MCI-Shirley is one of the Northern Sector correctional facilities that \nI oversee.  \n29. I am aware that the complaint alleges that diabetic prisoners at MCI-Shirley receive \ninsulin injections in their cells from nurses wearing the same gloves used when giving \ninjections to other prisoners. Complaint at ¶ 49. This is not accurate. \n30. Since the lockdown at MCI-Shirley, insulin injections are administered in the unit \nsallyport by the assigned nurse who is in full PPE equipment, masked and gloved. \nFurther, the nurse dons a new pair of gloves and gown between each insulin injection, \nand cleans the area before and after each inmate. \n31. I am also aware that Ariel Pena, an inmate at MCI-Shirley, has submitted an affidavit in \nthis case.  \n32. Mr. Pena claims that inmates in his unit are “not given cleaning supplies daily, or even \nevery few days to clean our cells.” Pena Affidavit at ¶ 4.  \n33. The F1 unit where Mr. Pena resides has two (2) biohazard inmate runners who clean after \nthe morning and evening major counts. These biohazard runners have been trained and \n5 \n \n\ninstructed by the EHSO on how to thoroughly clean and disinfect the entire unit to \ninclude, but not limited to, phones, kiosk, showers, tables, handrails and door \nhandles.  Cleaning and disinfecting is expected to be conducted throughout the day, to \ninclude between phases of inmates being let out of their cells.  \n34. The unit is equipped with mops, brooms, dust pans, mop sink, hot water, toilet brushes, \nsmall scrub brushes, as well as a shower swivel brush. The type of cleaning chemicals \nthat are provided are as follows: detergent/disinfectant, glass cleaner, and floor cleaner. A \nbleach/water solution (with the manufacturer-recommended solution mixture) was added \nin order to provide additional disinfectant.  \n35. Mr. Pena also states that the phones in F1 are very close together and are not sanitized in \nbetween uses. Pena Affidavit at ¶ 5.  \n36. At this time, only ten (10) F1 unit inmates at a time are allowed out of their cell one hour, \nwhich gives those ten inmates ample time to shower, clean their cell, and use the phone \nor any combination of those activities, while maintaining appropriate social distance from \none another.   \n37. There are eight (8) phones in F1 available for use at any given time by the ten (10) \ninmates who are allowed out. As phones become available, inmates can make a phone \ncall during their recreation time. Inmates are encouraged to stagger phone use by \nselecting the phones that are across from each other, which is at a minimum of eight (8) \nfeet apart. In addition, all inmates have access to cleaning products that they can \npersonally use to clean their cells and phone if they choose to during their recreation \nperiod.  \n38. I am also aware that Mr. Pena alleges that many staff do not wear masks. Pena Affidavit \n6 \n \n\nat ¶ 6. Contrary to this assertion, the Commissioner has outlined when masks or face \ncoverings should be worn, and compliance with the Commissioner’s directive is \nmonitored and vigorously enforced. \nNorth Central Correctional Center \n39. As discussed above, North Central Correctional Center (NCCI) at Gardner is one of the \nNorthern Sector correctional facilities that I oversee.  \n40. As of April 23, 2020, NCCI has no confirmed positive COVID-19 cases.  Additionally, \nthere are no symptomatic inmates at the facility. \n41. All persons entering NCCI continue to be screened according to CDC recommendations; \nthis includes temperature readings.  \n42. All NCCI staff must don a mask prior to entering the facility and continue to wear the \nmask when within six feet of any person. Administration and security supervisors \nmonitor this with frequent rounds and video surveillance. PPE have been acquired and \nare issued to staff as needed. \n43. Extraordinary cleaning measures have been instituted for NCCI.   \n44. Two-gallon pump sprayers for the units were purchased and continually sanitize all areas \nincluding walls, floors, showers, and rails. This starts in the morning and continues \nthrough the evening count.   \n45. Hand sanitizer is readily available in all NCCI units located centrally. Disinfectant and \nbleach mixtures are readily available to all units for personal cleaning. Disinfectant and \npaper towels are at each phone kiosk for constant cleaning. \n46. Medication lines are being done in each unit at NCCI. However, a ranking supervisor \noversees the medication lines to ensure that social distancing is being practiced. Sick slips \n7 \n \n\nare gathered at the medication line and are triaged by HSU staff, and inmates are seen on \nthe unit if possible.   \n47. Chronic care appointments at NCCI are held in the HSU, and inmates going to the HSU \nare escorted individually to the appointment.   \n48. Due to the physical layout of NCCI, and the timeliness of insulin and mealtimes, insulin \ninjections for diabetic inmates are done in the HSU.  No more than six (6) inmates from \neach unit are escorted to the HSU at any given time for insulin injections, and at all times \ninmates going to HSU must remain six (6) feet apart. While conducting insulin, each \ninmate waits in the waiting area practicing proper distancing; there are markings on the \nfloor indicating proper distance. \n49. All group activities at NCCI have been currently suspended, and all meals are brought to \nthe housing units.  \n50. While programs and education have been ceased, Earned Good Time opportunities are \nobtainable on the unit.  \n51. The gym and weight room at NCCI are closed, but inmates can request the law library \nand are brought one at a time for use.   \n52. Dormitory-style units share common areas on a set schedule to include cleaning between \nperiods.   \n53. Rounds are being done daily by a manager in all housing units to ensure that directives \nare being followed. The efficient and thorough screening process, coupled with the \ncleaning measures taken at NCCI, have to this date been successful. \n54. I am aware that Dana Durfee, an inmate at NCCI, has made a number of statements in an \naffidavit regarding the facility’s response to COVID-19.  \n8 \n \n\n55. Mr. Durfee claims in his affidavit that he is currently housed in G1 and that this unit \n“holds 71 other men and is approximately 24 feet by 40 feet.” Affidavit of Durfee at ¶ 2.  \n56. Department records show that Mr. Durfee is currently housed in G1, bed 30A. Unit G1 \nhouses 34 inmates, not 71.  \n57. The dimensions of the G1 living area are 66’ x 28’, with a ceiling height of 10.5’ – not \n24’ x 40’ as Mr. Durfee alleges. This equals 1,848 square feet of total living space, or \n54.35 square feet per inmate. \n58. This more than meets American Correctional Association (“ACA”) standard 4-4132, \nwhich states that rooms used for housing inmates should provide, at a minimum, 25 \nsquare feet of unencumbered space per occupant.  \n59. Mr. Durfee also insinuates in his affidavit that there are not enough toilets in the G1 unit \nat NCCI. Durfee Affidavit at ¶ 2. \n60. Unit G1 has one (1) urinal, four (4) toilets, and four (4) sinks, equating to 6.8 inmates per \ntoilet. \n61. ACA standard 4-4137 states that toilets should be provided to inmates at a minimum ratio \nof 1 for every 12 inmates in male facilities, urinals accounting for up to one half of the \ntoilets. Thus, G1 more than meets the ACA standards. \n62. Mr. Durfee also claims in his affidavit that there is “a line of people every morning to use \nthe limited number of toilets and sinks.” Durfee Affidavit at ¶ 2. I have had staff at NCCI \nreview video from G1 for the past several days with goal of determining whether there \nwas in fact a line during active bathroom times on the mornings of April 19-23, 2020. It \nwas reported that there were no waiting lines.  \n63. Mr. Durfee also claims that he observed many inmates playing cards in the dayroom and \n9 \n \n\nnot social distancing. Durfee Affidavit at ¶ 6. Staff at NCCI have given numerous \ndirectives to all inmates to observe social distancing practices. Unit officers conduct \nhourly rounds for which they have been directed to encourage social distancing when \npossible. \n64. Mr. Durfee also claims that many correction officers are not wearing the masks that have \nbeen issued by the Department. Durfee Affidavit at ¶ 6. All officers have been issued \nmasks and have been given the mandated directive from the Commissioner to don the \nmask at all times.  Staff at NCCI have been consistently wearing masks at all times, not \njust the recommended six foot CDC recommendation. The NCCI administration has been \nmonitoring video and addressing staff who do not comply.   \nSubscribed under the pains and penalties of perjury this the 24th day of April, 2020.  \n \n \n            /s/ James Ferreira   \n            James Ferreira \n            Assistant Deputy Commissioner, Northern Sector \n \n10 \n \n\nSupreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth    Full Court:   SJC-12935      Filed: 4/24/2020 7:32 PM\n \nCOMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS \nSUPREME JUDICIAL COURT \n   \nSUFFOLK, ss.

I have been employed by the Massachusetts Department of Correction (“Department”) \nsince September 1987. On May 6, 2018, I was promoted to Assistant Deputy \nCommissioner (“ADC”) for the Southern Sector, a position that I currently hold. Prior to \nbeing appointed ADC for the Southern Sector, I held various jobs at the Department, such \nas the Superintendent of the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Norfolk (“MCI-\nNorfolk”) from 2014 until 2018, the Deputy Superintendent of Operations at MCI-\nNorfolk from 2011 until 2014,  and the Director of Security at MCI-Norfolk.  \n2.  The statements contained in this affidavit are based upon my personal knowledge and \nreview of Department of Correction records that are maintained in the normal course of \nbusiness. \nJob Duties and Responsibilities \n3.  The ADC of the Southern Sector is a senior level manager who reports directly to the \nDeputy Commissioner of Prison Division.  \n4.  Generally speaking, the ADC for the Southern Sector is responsible for supervising and \nmanaging the correctional facilities in the Southern Sector. These include: Bridgewater \n1 \n \n\n \nState Hospital, Old Colony Correctional Center, Massachusetts Treatment Center, MCI-\nCedar Junction, MCI-Norfolk, Massachusetts Alcohol and Substance Abuse Center, and \nPondville Correctional Center.   \n5.  All of these facilities are accredited by the American Correctional Association (ACA). \n6.  The primary focus of the ADC is to ensure the protection of the public by incarcerating \ncriminal offenders in a safe, secure, humane environment by overall planning, \norganization, direction, and supervision of staff and inmates.  \n7.  The ADC’s goals include establishing consistency in institutional operations, increasing \nefficiency, safety of institutional operations and promoting reintegration efforts. As the \nADC, I identify and resolve issues identified by the Commissioner, and support \nsuperintendents in their efforts to resolve problems common to facility operations.   \nPondville Correctional Center \n8.  As discussed above, Pondville Correctional Center (“PCC”) is one of the Southern Sector \ncorrectional facilities that I oversee.  \n9.  I am aware that there are numerous allegations in this case concerning the steps that \ncorrectional staff at PCC have taken during the COVID emergency. \n10. Specifically, plaintiff Peter Kyriakides states that he resides in a 5’ x 5’ cell at PCC.  \n11. According to Department records, Mr. Kyriakides resides in Cell 209 at PCC.  \n12. According to Department records, Cell 209 is not 5’ x 5’ as Mr. Kyriakides claims. \nRather, Cell 209 at PCC is 7 ½’ x 10’.  \n13. I am also aware that the plaintiffs in this case allege that the bathrooms at PCC are \n“regularly covered in urine.” Complaint at ¶ 46.  \n2 \n \n\n \n14. The showers and bathrooms at PCC are thoroughly cleaned once a day by the assigned \nworkers. In addition, during this pandemic, cleaning supplies/materials and mops are \navailable in the bathroom for inmates to clean after uses. \n15. In addition, all inmates are offered cleaning supplies daily during the day shift and \nshowers and telephones are cleaned by each inmate after use. \n16. The Department also purchased compact sprayers for use at PCC. Throughout the day, \nstaff spray the showers, bathrooms and high touch areas with bleach and water mixture.  \n17. Moreover, a staff member is specifically assigned to clean door knobs at PCC with \nbleach and water throughout the day. \nMassachusetts Treatment Center \n18. As discussed above, at the Massachusetts Treatment Center (“MTC”) is one of the \nSouthern Sector correctional facilities that I oversee.  \n19. I am aware that the plaintiffs point to a Department of Public Health inspection report as \nevidence that the bathrooms and showers at the MTC were poorly maintained and \nunsanitary. Complaint at ¶ 8.  \n20. The MTC is cleaned and maintained throughout the year. In accordance with \ndepartmental policy, all DOC facilities, including the MTC, have developed house- \nkeeping plans approved by the reviewing authority.   \n21. After each DPH inspection, a plan of action is developed by the facility and submitted for \nDPH approval.   \n22. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a cleaning plan was established at the MTC. \n23. Under this plan, the Environmental Health and Safety Officer (“EHSO”) monitors the \ncleaning of the facility and ensures that all high touch areas in the common areas of the \n3 \n \n\n \nfacility are sprayed down with a disinfectant daily. The unit officers clean all high touch \nareas in the living units. \n24. Twice per week, the EHSO sprays down the showers and toilets throughout the facility \nwith a Kaivac cleaning machine. \n25. All living unit showers at the MTC are cleaned by the unit runners twice per day, and the \nunit runners are given masks and gloves. \n26. Additionally, cleaning disinfectant spray is available for MTC inmates to spray the \nshowers down after each use. At the end of the day, the showers and bathrooms are \nthoroughly cleaned again and sprayed down with disinfectant. \n27. In the modular unit of the MTC where there are shared toilets, the unit runners clean \nthem many times throughout the day.  \n28. I am aware that there are allegations in the complaint that MTC inmates who need \nmedication or medical care are forced to wait in medication lines, where they stand in \nclose proximity to one another. This is not accurate.  \n29. Medication at the MTC is dispensed cell to cell. In the modular unit, which houses six \nman rooms, the nurse is stationed on the tier and inmates are called out individually to \npick up their medication.  \n30. There is currently no lining up of MTC inmates in medication lines. \n31. I am aware that Ryan Duntin, an inmate in one of the modular units at MTC, has \nsubmitted an affidavit in which he alleges that he “stood in the medication line with ten \nor fifteen prisoners.” Duntin Affidavit at ¶ 4. While this may have been true prior to \nMarch 20, 2020, since March 20th, strict social distancing when dispensing medication in \nthe modular units is enforced.  \n4 \n \n\n \n32. Mr. Duntin also claims that staff at MTC are using “a cleaning solution that has no \nbleach.” Duntin Affidavit at ¶ 9.  While some bleach products are used at the MTC, most \nsurfaces are disinfected with Maquat 64, an extremely powerful disinfectant and \nsanitizer. Also, scented disinfectant called Respond is now being used. \n33. Mr. Duntin also claims that “no staff has cleaned the unit.” Duntin Affidavit at ¶ 12. \nHowever, the EHSO and inmate workers are cleaning the unit and bathrooms. The staff \nand inmates continue to clean daily. Twice a day, the bathrooms are cleaned and \nchemicals cleaning solutions are replaced.  \n34. Mr. Duntin also claims that correctional staff do not wear masks or some have homemade \nmasks. Duntin Affidavit at ¶ 15. All MTC staff have been issued N-95 masks; some staff \nuse cloth masks over the N-95 to preserve the life expectancy of the N-95 mask.  \n35. As of yesterday, only MTC inmates who are part of the cleaning crew were given masks \nand gloves, as well as inmates who are being transferred to outside hospitals.  \n36. Mr. Duntin also insinuates that he should be tested for COVID-19. Duntin Affidavit at ¶ \n2. However, the contractual medical provider determines who is to receive a test in \naccordance with DPH regulations. Many MTC inmates have been tested to date.  \nMCI-Norfolk \n37. As discussed above, at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Norfolk (“MCI-\nNorfolk”) is one of the Southern Sector correctional facilities that I oversee.  \n38. At MCI-Norfolk, the EHSO oversees all cleaning operations of the facility to include \ndelivery of cleaning supplies and chemicals to all areas of the facility. \n39. Cleaning/disinfecting is emphasized for showers, common bathrooms, high touch areas \nand areas where infection was identified. \n5 \n \n\n \n40. Hand sanitizer and soap is available to MCI-Norfolk inmates as well as staff. Both \ninmates and staff have been notified of the importance of hand washing.  \n41. I am aware that there are allegations in the complaint that the use of dormitory-style \nhousing in medical units at MCI-Norfolk is problematic. Complaint at ¶ 39. \n42. The Clinical Stabilization Unit (“CSU”) at MCI-Norfolk is a dormitory-style unit with a \ntotal of sixteen (16) beds, thirteen (13) in CSU and three (3) additional medical \nobservation beds. The hospital beds are close together; however, the count is not at \nsixteen inmates at this time, but rather eight (8) inmates. I am also aware that the \nplaintiffs in this case allege a poor record at MCI-Norfolk with respect to DPH violations. \nComplaint at ¶ 47. \n43. In accordance with Department policy, all DOC facilities have developed housekeeping \nplans approved by the reviewing authority.  After each DPH inspection, a plan of action \nis developed by the facility and submitted for DPH approval.   \nOld Colony Correctional Center \n44. As discussed above, at the Old Colony Correctional Center (“OCCC”) is one of the \nSouthern Sector correctional facilities that I oversee.  \n45. At OCCC, general cleaning using sprayers on areas such as railings, ramps and \ndoorknobs are conducted at least twice per day and evening shifts in all areas.  \n46. Housing units are sanitized every day and evening shift, and inmates are offered cleaning \nsupplies for their cells daily during the evening shift.  \n47. Since March 25, 2020, approximately 26 gallons of hand sanitizer has been refilled at \ninmate hand sanitizer stations at OCCC. \n \n \n6 \n \n\n \n \nSubscribed under the pains and penalties of perjury this the 24th day of April, 2020.  \n \n \n            /s/ Sean Medeiros     \n            Sean Medeiros \n            Assistant Deputy Commissioner, Southern Sector \n \n \n7 \n \n\nSupreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth    Full Court:   SJC-12935      Filed: 4/24/2020 7:32 PM\n\n\n\n",

McManus, BBO No. 673219 \nSpecial Assistant Attorney General (appt. pending) \nHEMENWAY & BARNES LLP \n75 State Street \nBoston, MA  02109 \n(617) 227-7940 \npmoore@hembar.com \nrmcmanus@hembar.com \n   \n\nGovernor Charles D. Baker moves to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims asserted against \nhim in this action.  The declaratory and injunctive relief sought by plaintiffs is not \navailable against the Governor under this Court’s settled precedent and article 30 of the \nMassachusetts Declaration of Rights.  In addition, even assuming the truth of plaintiffs’ \nallegations, they fail to state an actionable claim against the Governor.  The Governor \ntherefore moves to dismiss all claims against him pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) \nand Mass. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (insofar as they apply to proceedings before the Single \nJustice under Mass. R. Civ. P. 1) and under Mass. R. App. P. 15 (insofar as it applies to \nproceedings before the full Court). \nFirst, plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, \nG.L. c. 231A, et seq., fail as a matter of law.  By the plain terms of that Act, declaratory \nrelief may not be sought against the Governor.  G.L. c. 231A, § 2 (“this section shall not \napply to the governor”); McCarthy v. Governor, 471 Mass. 1008, 1010-11 (2015); \nAlliance, AFSCME/SEIU, AFL-CIO v. Sec’y of Admin. & Fin., 413 Mass. 377, 377 n.1 \n(“[D]eclaratory relief is not available against the Governor”).   \nSecond, the injunctive relief sought against the Governor is beyond the authority \nof this Court to award.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint does not seek to enjoin any affirmative act \nof the Governor but instead seeks to compel him to engage in affirmative conduct.  See \nDep’t of Pub. Utils. v. Trustees of N.Y., N.H., & H.R. Co., 304 Mass. 664, 671 (1939) \n(“Relief by restraining affirmative action ordinarily is given in equity by preventive \ninjunction.  But relief against inaction by compelling performance of a public or quasi \npublic duty . . . ordinarily is given at law by writ of mandamus.”).   This Court has long \nheld that such mandamus relief is unavailable against the Governor, even where only \nministerial acts are at issue.  Rice v. Draper, 207 Mass. 577, 579 (1911).  That precedent \n1 \n \n\nhas even more force where gubernatorial discretion is at issue.  See Town of Milton v. \nCommonwealth, 416 Mass. 471, 475-76 (1993).  Indeed, this Court has recognized \nconsistently that ordering the Governor to affirmatively undertake executive action \nwould raise core art. 30 concerns.  Id. (“Judicial unwillingness to order the Governor or \nthe Legislature to act is founded on separation of powers principles expressed in art. 30 \nof the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.”).           \nThird, even if the Court had authority to award the relief demanded against the \nGovernor, the Governor is not a proper party to a civil rights claim where the actions of \nother Executive Branch officials are at issue.  See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 676 \n(2009) (“Because vicarious liability is inapplicable to . . .  § 1983 suits, a plaintiff must \nplead that each Government-official defendant, through the official’s own individual \nactions, has violated the Constitution.”); Hannon v. Beard, 979 F. Supp. 2d 136, 141-42 \n(D. Mass. 2013) (dismissing Governor from challenge to conditions of confinement \nbrought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983).  A review of the Complaint illustrates this point, \nas only two of its 100-plus paragraphs even mention the Governor at all.  Any relief, if \nwarranted, is available from subordinate executive officers who have been named \ndefendants in this action.  And should relief be entered as to those officials, the \n“presumption exists that the Commonwealth will honor it[].”  Bromfield v. Treasurer \nand Receiver Gen., 390 Mass. 665, 669 (1983).    \nWith petitioners’ assent, the Governor requests leave to file a memorandum \nsupporting this motion at or before 4:00 PM on Wednesday, April 29, 2020.  As a basis \nfor that request, the Governor submits that the Court and the parties will benefit from a \nfull briefing of the remedial, jurisdictional, and constitutional issues implicated by \nincluding the Governor as a party to this action.   \n2 \n \n\n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \nGOVERNOR CHARLES D.

Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\nSTEPHEN FOSTER[1] & others[2]\nvs.\nCOMMISSIONER OF CORRECTION & others[3] (No. 1).\nNo. SJC-12935.\nSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, Suffolk.\nMay 7, 2020.\nJune 2, 2020.\nCivil action commenced in the Supreme Judicial Court for the county of Suffolk on April 17, 2020.\nThe case was reported by Cypher, J.\nJames R.

Practice, Civil, Civil commitment.\nGAZIANO, J.\nThe plaintiffs, incarcerated inmates serving sentences or individuals who are civilly committed under G. L. c. 123, § 35,\ncommenced this class action in the county court, alleging that their conditions of confinement expose them to unreasonable\nrisks from the COVID-19 pandemic. They claim, among other things, that the defendants' failure to take readily available\nsteps to reduce the incarcerated population to safe levels so as to permit adequate physical distancing within prison walls\nconstitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 26\nof the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, and violates substantive due process requirements guaranteed under the\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and arts. 1, 10, and 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.\nThe plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction enjoining the Department of Correction (DOC) from (1) housing any prisoner in\na facility where the population exceeds its design-rated capacity and (2) \"[h]ousing any prisoner in a cell, room, dorm, or\nother living area where they must sleep, eat, or recreate within six feet of another person.\"[4] To accomplish this, the\nplaintiffs asked that the DOC be ordered to reduce the number of incarcerated individuals such that the proper physical\ndistancing can be maintained in all facilities. They also requested that the parole board be ordered to expedite the release of\ncertain groups of inmates, consider the risks of COVID-19 in all parole decisions, and adopt a presumption of release on\nparole for all inmates who are eligible for parole.[5] In addition, the plaintiffs sought to enjoin the DOC from continuing to\nconfine individuals who are civilly committed pursuant to G. L. c. 123, § 35.\nThe single justice reserved and reported the case to the full court.[6] She also remanded the matter to the Superior Court\n\"for fact-finding that will enable the full court to decide the case in the first instance.\" A Superior Court judge, by special\nassignment, conducted a series of evidentiary hearings, took limited testimony from all parties over three days, collected\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4782763729452867400&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 1/23\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\naffidavits, and submitted his findings to this court. We also ordered the defendants to provide answers to additional\nquestions pursuant to Mass. R. A. P. 16(l), as appearing in 481 Mass. 1628 (2019).\nThe initial question before us at this stage is whether a preliminary injunction should issue. This in turn requires a\ndetermination whether the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims. See Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. v.\nCheney, 380 Mass. 609, 616-617 (1980).\nTo prevail on an Eighth Amendment claim, an individual must establish that the punishment is inconsistent with \"the evolving\nstandards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\" See Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 100-101 (1958). Prison\nofficials have a duty under the Eighth Amendment to protect inmates in their custody from the spread of serious,\ncommunicable diseases, including where the complaining inmate does not show symptoms of the disease, or where \"the\npossible infection might not affect all of those exposed.\" Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993) (\"We have great\ndifficulty agreeing that prison authorities may not be deliberately indifferent to an inmate's current health problems but may\nignore a condition of confinement that is sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering the next week or\nmonth or year\").\nThus, to be entitled to a preliminary injunction in their claims for unconstitutional conditions of confinement because of the\nrisk of spread of a disease, the incarcerated plaintiffs must show that they are likely to establish that the defendants have\nbeen deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of serious harm to their health or safety. See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S.\n97, 103-104 (1976); Torres v. Commissioner of Correction, 427 Mass. 611, 613-614, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1017 (1998).\nIt is undisputed, as we recognized in Committee for Pub. Counsel Servs. v. Chief Justice of the Trial Court, 484 Mass. 431,\n445 (2020) (CPCS v. Trial Court), that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the situation inside the Commonwealth's jails and\nprisons \"is urgent and unprecedented, and that a reduction in the number of people who are held in custody is necessary.\"\nNonetheless, on the record here, we conclude that the incarcerated plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their\nclaim for violations of the Eighth Amendment, and thus their motion for a preliminary injunction must be denied.\nAs to the plaintiffs' argument that commitment to a secure facility for substance abuse treatment during the pandemic\nviolates the substantive due process rights of the committed individual, on this record, the plaintiffs do not seem to have a\nrepresentative class member at this point, and thus are unlikely to succeed on their petition for a class-based preliminary\ninjunction. Nonetheless, some immediate relief is necessary with respect to those who have been civilly committed pursuant\nto G. L. c. 123, § 35. Under our supervisory authority pursuant to G. L. c. 211, § 3, we conclude that these individuals are\nentitled to a new hearing to enable a motion judge to take into account treatment limitations in the current circumstances,\nand to weigh the balance of potential benefits from treatment and the potential harms as a result of being held in wings of\nprisons and jails or other conditions of confinement during the pandemic.[7]\nBackground.\n1. COVID-19 in Massachusetts correctional facilities.\nDespite a massive, concerted global containment effort, COVID-19 has continued to spread, both around the world and in\nMassachusetts.[8] Few inhabited places worldwide have been spared from infections; the Massachusetts correctional\nsystem is not among them.\nFor many, the virus causes only mild symptoms. For others, particularly the elderly or those with preexisting conditions, the\ndisease poses a substantial likelihood of serious illness or death. Indeed, since February 29, 2020, the disease has killed\nmore than 100,000 people in the United States and more than 6,700 people in Massachusetts. The demographic distribution\nof severe cases is of particular importance here, because Massachusetts has the highest percentage of elderly prisoners\nrelative to all other States.[9] Prisoners also have been shown to age more rapidly than the general population, typically\ndeveloping the chronic conditions and disabilities associated with old age ten to fifteen years earlier than their\nnonincarcerated counterparts. According to estimates by the Commissioner of Correction (commissioner), fifty percent of the\ninmates under her care and control either are over sixty years of age or have an underlying medical condition that puts them\nat heightened risk for a severe course of COVID-19, should they contract the virus.\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4782763729452867400&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 2/23\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\nIn CPCS v. Trial Court, 484 Mass. at 456 (Appendix B), we appointed a special master and established daily reporting\nrequirements in order to monitor the populations of Massachusetts correctional institutions, and the progression of COVID-\n19 within them. As of May 25, 2020, the DOC reported 396 confirmed cases among inmates. The vast majority of these\ncases were found in three institutions: the Massachusetts Correctional Institution (MCI)-Shirley (160 cases) and MCI-\nFramingham (84 cases); and the Massachusetts Treatment Center (MTC) (130 cases). Five other institutions had at least\none case among the incarcerated, and the rest reported zero confirmed cases. The data do not reveal how many of these\nindividuals are actively symptomatic or how many have recovered from the disease. Eight incarcerated individuals have died\nof COVID-19.\nStaff at a number of correctional institutions also have tested positive for the virus.[10] As of May 25, 2020, 182 DOC staff,\nacross eleven DOC facilities, had confirmed cases of COVID-19. While MCI-Shirley, the MTC, and MCI-Framingham again\nhad the highest numbers of positive tests, the distribution of infections amongst staff is broader than that of the inmates. As\nwe noted in CPCS v. Trial Court, 484 Mass. at 437, infections among staff are of particular concern. They not only risk\nbringing the virus into prisons, thereby spreading it amongst a closely confined, captive, and especially vulnerable\npopulation, but they also risk spreading the virus from prisons into the broader community. Id. As with inmates, the data do\nnot reveal how many staff are currently symptomatic or recovered. Currently, no correctional staff have died of COVID-19.\nAs part of ascertaining how crowded these facilities are, the parties ask us to compare the total number of prisoners to\ndueling definitions of prison capacity: operational capacity or design capacity. Operational capacity is based on guidelines\nissued by the Association of State Correctional Administrators. CPCS v. Trial Court, 484 Mass. at 439 n.12. Design capacity\nrefers to \"[t]he number of inmates that planners or architects intended for the institution,\" as revised by a rating official from\nwithin the DOC. See Governor, Quarterly Report on the Status of Prison Capacity, Fourth Quarter 2019, 10 (Apr. 2020)\n(defining design capacity). In every facility in Massachusetts, the operational capacity is higher than the design capacity,\nsometimes significantly so. In the most pronounced example, the North Central Correctional Institution at Gardner (NCCI-\nGardner) has a design capacity of 568 inmates, but an operational capacity of 974 inmates.\nThe metric matters. As of May 25, 2020, no DOC facility was over its operational capacity, and five were operating at less\nthan fifty percent of operational capacity.[11] The DOC system as a whole was at approximately sixty-five percent of\noperational capacity (6,639 prisoners out of a total operational capacity of 10,209). By contrast, five institutions were over\ntheir design capacities, including NCCI-Gardner (medium security), which was at 160 percent of its design capacity. In\naggregate, the DOC was operating at approximately eighty-nine percent of its design capacity (6,639 prisoners and design\ncapacity of 7,492).\n2. Efforts at containment in correctional institutions.\nThis court and all parties agree that correctional institutions face unique difficulties in keeping their populations safe during\nthis pandemic. Because the constitutional adequacy of the DOC's measures to control the spread of COVID-19 in its\nfacilities is central to this litigation, we review them at some length.\na. Policy directives.\nWhen the Governor declared a state of emergency on March 10, 2020, the DOC began implementing its COVID-19 control\nplans. Beginning on March 12, 2020, the commissioner delivered a series of directives, memoranda, and advisories to both\ninmates and staff. These essentially weekly communications document escalating and responsive efforts to implement\nguidance from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Department of Public Health (DPH). The interim guidance by\nthe CDC itself recognizes that full compliance with best practices is not feasible in all facilities; therefore, the commissioner\nhas required each facility in Massachusetts to create its own compliance plan. See Interim Guidance on Management of\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities (Mar. 23, 2020) (Interim Guidance),\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/guidance-correctional-detention.pdf [https://perma.cc/MXY3-ETDL].\nFor example, the first memoranda issued guidance concerning proper hand-washing technique, sanitation, and questions\nused to screen potentially symptomatic staff and inmates. The advisory issued on March 20, 2020, limited transports\nbetween facilities, authorized staff to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) in high-risk parts of facilities, and upgraded\ncleaning and disinfection protocols. One week later, the guidance required staff to wear masks, provided PPE to certain\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4782763729452867400&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 3/23\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\ninmates in especially high-risk areas, and allowed alcohol-based hand sanitizer, something that previously had been\ndiscouraged in prison settings. On April 3, 2020, the commissioner initiated a system-wide lockdown. Since then, inmates\nwho live in cells have been spending twenty-three hours per day in their cells, while inmates living in dormitory-style housing\nhave been unable to leave their units.\nWhile the plaintiffs contest whether these various directives are sufficient ultimately to ensure inmate safety, it is difficult to\ndispute that they show ongoing attention — at least at the level of planning and policy — both to guidance from the CDC\nand DPH and to the evolving situation on the ground. Nonetheless, as the boxer Mike Tyson once said, \"Everyone has a\nplan until they get hit.\" That is to say, even the most meticulous and exceptional planning by the DOC still might not meet\nconstitutional muster if there are pervasive failures in implementation. We therefore examine the execution of these plans\nand procedures.\nb. Physical distancing.\nPhysical distancing between individuals (so-called \"social distancing\") has been a cornerstone of the public health response\nto COVID-19, both in the United States and around the world. See generally Interim Guidance, supra. The CDC defines\nsocial distancing as \"the practice of increasing the space between individuals and decreasing the frequency of contact to\nreduce the risk of spreading a disease (ideally to maintain at least [six] feet between all individuals, even those who are\nasymptomatic).\" Id. at 4. By following these practices, the goal is to slow the rate at which the disease progresses through\nthe population.\nSince the first case of COVID-19 was detected in a DOC facility, the DOC has taken steps to implement physical distancing\nwithin all of its facilities. Initially it banned contact sports, and later banned all use of gyms, weights, and prison yards. Some\ninmate beds were moved further apart, and, in accordance with CDC guidance, inmates were asked to sleep head to foot,\nso as to increase the distance between their faces. Meals now are served in cells or dormitories to avoid congregation in\ndining areas. Staff have attempted, apparently at times unsuccessfully, to reduce or eliminate medication lines.\nCertain aspects of prison design limit the degree to which physical distancing is possible. Due both to the fact that some\nsingle cells have been reserved for quarantining inmates and because of the underlying building designs, currently fifty-eight\npercent of inmates sleep either in a two-person cell or in a dormitory-style room. Since the lockdown, these inmates sleep\nand live within six feet of at least one other inmate, and sometimes many more. Approximately seventy percent of prisoners\neat within six feet of another prisoner.\nFor example, plaintiff Michael White resides in a dormitory-style room at MCI-Concord that contains bunkbeds for\napproximately eighty inmates. The beds are three feet apart, the sinks are one foot apart, and White generally eats within\narm's reach of at least one other inmate. White's account of attempting to maintain appropriate distance in a dormitory\nsetting is consistent with accounts by plaintiffs Ryan Duntin and Dana Durfee. Moreover, while the occupants of a dormitory\nmay be siloed from other groups of inmates in the prison (something the DOC calls \"cohorting\"), if an asymptomatic guard or\nother staff member were to introduce the virus, this type of \"cohorting\" would be ineffective to prevent the spread of COVID-\n19 to those housed in the unit.\nThe DOC argues that, even if those in double cells are unable to maintain physical distance from their cellmates, the\nconditions are consistent with physical distancing guidance provided by the CDC because each pair of cellmates is\nanalogous to a family unit in the broader community — not distanced from one another, but from every other set of\ncellmates. This argument has merit as far as it goes, but runs up against basic aspects of prison design: those housed in\ndouble and single cells still often must share showers, toilets, sinks, and telephones with those in other cells on their tier or\nin their block. Inmate testimony credited by the Superior Court judge consistently reported a lack of physical distancing with\nthose in other cells while individuals use these essential fixtures or await their turn to do so.\nc. Facility sanitation and personal protective equipment.\nThe DPH is statutorily required to conduct biannual inspections of DOC facilities for compliance with health and sanitation\nregulations and to report on its findings and recommendations. See G. L. c. 111, § 20; 105 Code Mass. Regs. §§ 451.401 et\nseq. The plaintiffs draw our attention to recent reports for each DOC facility showing that health code violations for most\nfacilities number in the hundreds. The plaintiffs emphasize violations of regulations that recommend a specific amount of\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4782763729452867400&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 4/23\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\nfloor space per prisoner, and point out that twelve DOC facilities house at least some inmates in cells that do not meet the\nDPH recommended standards. These violations are concerning generally, and all the more so under conditions of global\npandemic.\nWe note, however, that the mere number of violations only paints a partial picture. It does not distinguish between\nmandatory regulations (105 Code Mass. Regs. §§ 451.100, 451.200) and recommended standards (105 Code Mass. Regs.\n§§ 451.300). Furthermore, the violations vary significantly in severity. At MCI-Framingham, for example, violations range\nfrom a paper towel dispenser that was not stocked at the time of inspection and a dusty wall fan to evidence of a \"chronic\nrodent and insect issue in the food service areas.\" Counting the number of violations alone does not capture this distinction.\nSome chipped paint has little bearing on our analysis here; bathroom and shower areas at the MTC that were so poorly\nmaintained as to yield an \"increased risk of disease transmission\" are highly germane.\nIn March 2020, the DOC began ordering large amounts of PPE and cleaning supplies. Cleaning regimens at all DOC\nfacilities have been enhanced, and disinfectant cleaning supplies have been made available to inmates so that they may\nclean their own cells. As stated, the DOC also has begun to allow alcohol-based hand sanitizer, which it has distributed\nwidely across its facilities. Despite these efforts, both cleaning supplies and hand sanitizer periodically have run short. The\nprecise extent of these shortages varies by institution and remains the subject of some factual dispute.\nWhile initially PPE was provided only to correctional staff in specific, high-risk areas, its use has expanded as the pandemic\nhas progressed. Since March, staff have been required to wear masks at all times within the facilities. Between April 24,\n2020, and April 28, 2020, the DOC distributed surgical masks to all inmates. Not all staff have complied entirely with PPE\nmandates; likewise, some inmates have not followed the DOC's \"strong encouragement\" to wear the masks provided.\nSupervising officers have used video surveillance records to discipline officers who have failed to comply with PPE\nrequirements, including one officer who was suspended for five days when he and all of his staff were found not to be\nwearing masks.\nd. Entrance screenings and quarantines.\nTo prevent the introduction of the virus into its facilities, the DOC has limited access to prisons; it has allowed only staff and\nattorneys to enter, and has prohibited visitors and volunteers. Each facility screens all those who seek entry according to\nprotocols developed with reference to the guidance issued by the CDC and DPH. These protocols involve a questionnaire\nand self-administered temperature check; those with temperatures over 99.9 degrees Fahrenheit categorically are denied\nadmittance. The effectiveness of these screenings are limited by the fact that, as all parties agree, asymptomatic individuals\ncan spread the disease.\nIn every facility, the DOC has set aside areas to isolate and quarantine confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19, as\nwell as inmates who have refused to be tested. Individuals entering DOC custody are quarantined for two weeks. As of May\n1, 2020, there were \"many open cells in the quarantine unit[s]\" available should COVID-19 cases spike. Inmates who\nbelieve they are at heightened risk proactively may request isolation (being held in a single cell), subject to a medical\nevaluation, but there is not enough space to place all inmates at heightened risk, which would amount to one-half of the\nDOC population, in single cells. Moreover, both the commissioner and the plaintiffs share a concern for the mental health\nimplications of long-term single-cell isolation.\ne. Testing.\nThe DOC's testing strategy has evolved as the pandemic has progressed. The DOC conducted its first COVID-19 test on\nMarch 19, 2020, when an inmate at the MTC presented with symptoms. DOC reports that initially it followed CDC and DPH\nguidelines by deferring to the medical judgment of the medical providers at each facility as to the testing needed. This\ngenerally involved testing inmates who were symptomatic or who had been in close contact with someone who tested\npositive.\nOn April 22, 2020, large-scale mobile testing became available to the DOC, and it began administering tests to any inmate\nor patient who voluntarily agreed to be tested, facility by facility. As of May 25, 2020, the DOC had offered tests to all\ninmates or patients at thirteen facilities. According to the schedule it submitted in its Mass. R. A. P. 16(l) letter, all inmates\nwill be offered an initial test by the end of May. Any staff member may receive a test at any time upon request.\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4782763729452867400&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 5/23\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\nf. Decreasing population.\nThe plaintiffs seek an order requiring the defendants to reduce the population of incarcerated persons until no prisoner is\nhoused in a correctional facility where the population exceeds the design capacity of the institution or until no inmate is\nhoused in a cell that does not meet the DPH-recommended floor space regulations. It is unclear how many individuals would\nbe required to be released in order to meet these criteria. At the evidentiary hearing, the commissioner agreed that\ndecreasing the inmate population at DOC facilities could help contain the spread of COVID-19, and that measures to do so\nshould be taken, so long as they are lawful and appropriate in light of the over-all health and safety of the public.\nThe commissioner has several tools at her disposal to reduce the population in DOC custody, including medical parole,\ngood time credit, and furloughs. The Superior Court judge found that the DOC has taken multiple steps to expedite the\nmedical parole process, including shortening internal deadlines, reviewing home plans earlier in the process, and notifying\nMassHealth so that the inmate has medical insurance upon release. Since our decision in CPCS v. Trial Court, 484 Mass. at\n435-436, 456-457 (Appendix B), twenty-six individuals have been approved for medical parole; it remains unclear how many\nof those individuals actually have been released.[12]\nPandemic lockdown conditions effectively can lengthen sentences by limiting the opportunities by which inmates ordinarily\nwould be able to earn good-conduct sentence deductions, or \"good time credit.\" See G. L. c. 127, § 129D. The statute\npermits 7.5 days of good time credit per activity, and fifteen days total per month. See id. In response to the pandemic, the\ncommissioner awarded full good time credit for the month of March 2020 for anyone who had been earning such credit on\nMarch 1. She also established a journaling program by which inmates can earn 7.5 days of good time credit for the month of\nApril. Therefore, in April, inmates were eligible for one-half the good time credits they ordinarily would have been able to\nobtain. The commissioner indicated in her testimony that she was considering expanding these opportunities in May; the\nrecord does not indicate whether she has done so.\nThe DOC has not used furloughs since the 1990s, based on a belief that it is \"bad policy\" to release an inmate who later\nmust be reincarcerated. Accordingly, the DOC has not furloughed any inmates during the pandemic.\nThe commissioner does not believe that she has statutory authority to allow inmates to serve any portion of their State\nprison sentence under home confinement. We do not agree. See G. L. c. 127, §§ 48, 49, 49A; Commonwealth v. Donohue,\n452 Mass. 256, 265 (2008); discussion part 6, infra.\n3. Plaintiffs committed for substance abuse treatment.\nUnder G. L. c. 123, § 35, Massachusetts courts are authorized to commit an individual for involuntary substance use\ndisorder treatment upon a finding that the individual has a substance use disorder and that the disorder poses a likelihood of\nserious harm. See Matter of G.P., 473 Mass. 112, 120 (2015).\nGenerally, committed individuals are sent to unsecured treatment facilities licensed by the DPH or the Department of Mental\nHealth. See G. L. c. 123, § 35. If DPH informs the judge issuing the commitment that no such facilities are available, or \"if\nthe court makes a specific finding that the only appropriate setting for treatment for the person is a secure facility,\" the judge\nmay commit the individual to a secure facility designated by the commissioner. Id. Currently, there are three secure facilities\nin the Commonwealth. The DOC operates the Massachusetts Alcohol and Substance Abuse Center (MASAC), which is\nlocated at the MCI-Plymouth prison. The Hampden County sheriff, under an agreement with the DOC, operates the\nStonybrook Stabilization and Treatment Centers at Ludlow and Springfield, both of which are located at the Hampden\nCounty Correctional Center.\na. General precautions.\nBoth the DOC and the Hampden County sheriff's office have taken steps to protect their patients from COVID-19. All\npersons entering their facilities are screened for symptoms of COVID-19 and are held in a medical quarantine unit for\nfourteen days. Staff members are required to wear masks; for certain activities, they also wear gloves. The degree of\ncompliance with these requirements remains in dispute. A declarant and an affiant for the plaintiffs state that masks and\ngloves are not consistently used or changed between uses at MASAC. All patients have been given masks and soap.\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4782763729452867400&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 6/23\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\nMASAC does not provide soap in the bathrooms, so patients must bring their personal soap with them. At MASAC, a private\nvendor cleans and sanitizes the facility daily, including within patient rooms. Between March 13 and April 23, 2020, the\nMASAC population declined by eighty-two percent, and the Stonybrook population declined by fifty-seven percent. As of\nMay 25, 2020, MASAC held forty-three patients. This amounts to twenty-nine percent of its design capacity and seventeen\npercent of its operational capacity. Due to the low censuses, all patients have been given single occupancy rooms. On May\n23, 2020, MASAC reported that two patients tested positive for COVID-19. One MASAC staff member had also previously\ntested positive.\nb. Treatment.\nThe parties offer divergent accounts of the degree to which treatment has been interrupted by the pandemic; the Superior\nCourt judge did not make findings discrediting any of these differing reports. Plaintiff Mark Santos was committed to MASAC\non March 4, 2020. He avers that because MASAC went into a lockdown on April 3, 2020, he was required to remain in his\ncell, and could leave only to go to the restroom, make a telephone call, or receive medication. Santos states that most\ntreatment classes were canceled in mid-March, and he attended only one daily group session before the lockdown. The\nlockdown was still in effect when he was released on April 9, and Santos avers that he received no treatment during the\nlockdown. The DOC concedes that it instituted a lockdown at MASAC in order to make COVID-19 response plans, but\nmaintains that the lockdown lasted only three days.\nDeclarant Robert Peacock was committed to MASAC on April 24, 2020, and executed his declaration on April 28, 2020. He\nstated that he had been locked in his cell continuously since being committed, and could leave only to shower. He said as\nwell that he had received no counselling or any other type of treatment since his arrival.[13]\nThe DOC asserts that, for the first three days of their fourteen-day intake, patients are restricted to an observation room and\nassessed daily by clinical staff. After three days, patients who have been \"detox cleared\" are moved out of the observation\nroom but remain in the separate unit. For the remainder of the fourteen-day period, patients receive \"individual services\"\nfrom a substance use disorder counsellor. Thereafter, MASAC patients are moved to the general treatment unit, where they\nattend group sessions and other programming.\nThe Hampden County sheriff's office reports that new patients are provided substance abuse treatment while in their initial\nfourteen-day quarantine, and that, due to the lower population, patients currently receive more programing over-all than they\nwould have prior to the pandemic.\nDiscussion.\n1. Standard of review.\n\"A party seeking a preliminary injunction must show that success is likely on the merits; irreparable harm will result from\ndenial of the injunction; and the risk of irreparable harm to the moving party outweighs any similar risk of harm to the\nopposing party\" (quotation and citations omitted). Doe v. Worcester Pub. Sch., 484 Mass. 598, 601 (2010). \"In cases in\nwhich a public entity is a party, a judge may also weigh the risk of harm to the public interest in considering whether to grant\na preliminary injunction\" (citations omitted).

Class certification.\nIn their complaint and in their motion for injunctive relief, the plaintiffs purport to represent one over-all class of individuals\nthat also is made up of two smaller subclasses. They seek class certification for all classes. The broad injunctive relief\nsought by the plaintiffs is possible only if there is a class that may be certified.

P. 23(a), as amended, 471 Mass. 1491 (2015), members of a class may represent the class \"only if (1)\nthe class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the\nclass, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the\nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\" Additionally, the court must conclude that\n\"the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual\nmembers, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the\ncontroversy.\" Mass. R. Civ. P. 23(b). The plaintiffs bear the burden of providing \"information sufficient to enable the motion\njudge to form a reasonable judgment that the class meets the requirements of rule 23\" (quotation and citation omitted).\nGammella v. P.F. Chang's China Bistro, Inc., 482 Mass. 1, 12 (2019).\nWhile the precise contours of the global class that the plaintiffs ask us to certify remain somewhat unclear, they are clear as\ntwo specific putative subclasses: medically vulnerable individuals who are at high risk for serious complications or death\nfrom COVID-19 due to their underlying medical conditions or age, and those being held for treatment pursuant to G. L. c.\n123, § 35.\nWe conclude that the plaintiffs have shown a substantial likelihood that a class of medically vulnerable inmates who are\ncurrently serving criminal sentences, or who will begin serving such sentences in the future, can be certified. According to\nthe commissioner, nearly one-half of the DOC population is potentially at heightened risk of a serious course of the disease,\nleaving little question of numerosity. While there may be some variance between facilities, the legal claim and its basic\nfactual underpinning are common to all potential class members: that the increased risk of contracting COVID-19 caused by\nthe current conditions of the correctional facilities, in concert with the individuals' medical vulnerability, constitutes cruel and\nunusual punishment. Because this is precisely the claim of several of the named class members, they appear to be\nsufficiently typical and to have a substantial basis to show that they adequately and fairly can represent the class.\nAlthough the plaintiffs have shown that they are not precluded from establishing a substantial likelihood of success on the\nmerits in at least one of their requests for class certification, we do not have an adequate basis in this record to ascertain the\nproper contours of who qualifies as medically vulnerable. Nor, on this record, can we determine whether there is adequate\ncommonality in the named plaintiffs and the superclass of all incarcerated individuals the plaintiffs also seek to represent.\nWhile we understand the pressing urgency of this litigation, the Superior Court judge is better positioned to take expert\ntestimony and to determine the appropriate definition of medically vulnerable individuals for purposes of this litigation. See\nWeld v. Glaxo Wellcome Inc., 434 Mass. 81, 87 n.8 (2001), citing Carpenter v. Suffolk Franklin Sav. Bank, 370 Mass. 314,\n317-318 (1976) (unlike its Federal counterpart, rule 23 of Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure does not mandate early\nruling on class certification).\nThe second subclass that the plaintiffs seek to represent, those being held under G. L. c. 123, § 35, presents an entirely\ndifferent issue. As the defendants point out, Mark Santos, the proposed representative of this class, was released eight days\nbefore the filing of the complaint. He makes no claim that he is likely to be committed again. Thus, he would not be able to\nbring this claim on his own behalf because injunctive relief, preliminary or otherwise, would not redress his asserted injury.\n[14]See Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 102 (1983); LightLab Imaging, Inc. v. Axsun Techs., Inc., 469 Mass. 181, 194\n(2014). Because he could not bring an action on his own behalf, Santos cannot represent the purported class.[15] See Doe\nv.Governor, 381 Mass. 702, 704-705 (1980).\nThe plaintiffs' ability to locate a substitute class member seems virtually certain. Indeed, even this limited record contains an\naffidavit from Peacock, who was relatively newly committed when the complaint was filed, setting forth his concerns about\nlack of programming, the close to twenty-four hours per day he was held in his room, proximity to others when using certain\nnecessary facilities, and cleanliness of shared surfaces.\nIf, as appears virtually certain, the plaintiffs are able to obtain a suitable representative whose claims are typical of the class,\nwe anticipate that they will succeed in meeting the certification requirements. Multiple questions of law and fact are common\nto all putative class members, including issues regarding conditions of treatment and the risk of transmission in these\nconjugate settings. Based on the broad nature of the plaintiffs' arguments, the issues in common apparently predominate\nover those they may not share. The numerosity requirement almost certainly will be met because dozens of class members\nlikely exist, and new commitments are ongoing, rendering joinder of all members impracticable. See Gammella, 482 Mass.\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4782763729452867400&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 8/23\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\nat 11-12 & n.15. Lastly, adequacy exists due to the apparent lack of conflict between class members, and class counsel's\nability vigorously to pursue the action. See In re Hyundai & Kia Fuel Economy Litigation, 926 F.3d 539, 566 (9th Cir. 2019).\nThus, we defer the issue of certification to allow the plaintiffs to locate and substitute an appropriate representative. See\nGonzalez v. Commissioner of Correction, 407 Mass. 448, 451-453 (1990) (holding that named plaintiff's claims were moot,\ndenying defendant's motion to dismiss, and remanding matter to Superior Court with instructions to dismiss in set period of\ntime if substitute plaintiff could not be found). See also Mass. R. Civ. P. 15(a), 365 Mass. 761 (1974) (party may amend\npleading \"by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so\nrequires\").\nDespite the open questions of class certification that we remand for resolution in the Superior Court, we address the merits\nof the preliminary injunction, which has been briefed and argued before us. See O'Sullivan v. Secretary of Human Servs.,\n402 Mass. 190, 192 (1988) (reaching merits of case, despite mootness of named plaintiffs, because defendants did not\nargue mootness and because counsel \"apparently [were] prepared to pursue this action on behalf of [a substitute plaintiff]\");\nMassachusetts Gen. Hosp. v. Rate Setting Comm'n, 371 Mass. 705, 713 (1977) (no error where court ruled on merits of\ncase without ruling on class certification); Gooch v. Life Investors Ins. Co. of Am., 672 F.3d 402, 432-433 (6th Cir. 2012) (no\nerror where court ruled on preliminary injunction before class certification). The urgency of the claims raised convinces us\nthat delaying resolution of the motion would do an injustice.\n3. Constitutional claims.\nWhile the plaintiffs' briefs do not make this distinction entirely clear, because only inmates who have been convicted and are\nserving a sentence are subject to punishment by the Commonwealth, the Eighth Amendment claims are applicable only to\nthis group. Any relief sought by civilly committed individuals must be sought on the grounds of a violation of substantive due\nprocess rights; because they are not being punished, the Eighth Amendment's protections against cruel and unusual\npunishment do not apply. See Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 315-316 (1982).\nWe consider first the claims of the incarcerated individuals.\na. Eighth Amendment claims.\nThe plaintiffs contend that their conditions of confinement, and the defendants' failure to expedite the release of a greater\nnumber of individuals from incarceration, using any of a number of mechanisms, violate their rights under the Eighth and\nFourteenth Amendments and arts. 1, 10, 12, and 26.\nBecause we have not held that art. 26 provides greater protections with respect to conditions of confinement than does the\nEighth Amendment, and conditions for the civilly committed must be at least as good as for those who are serving\nsentences of incarceration, see Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 321-322, we consider first the plaintiffs' likelihood of success under\nthe Eighth Amendment.\n\"The Eighth Amendment . . . prohibits any punishment which violates civilized standards and concepts of humanity and\ndecency.\" Young v. Quinlan, 960 F.2d 351, 359 (3d Cir. 1992). As the plaintiffs observe, the Eighth Amendment applies to\nconditions of confinement that are separate from and independent of any condition imposed as a part of sentencing. See\nHelling, 509 U.S. at 32-33.\n\"[W]hen the State takes a person into its custody and holds him there against his will, the Constitution\nimposes upon it a corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety and general well being. . .\n. The rationale for this principle is simple enough: when the State by the affirmative exercise of its power so\nrestrains an individual's liberty that it renders him unable to care for himself, and at the same time fails to\nprovide for his basic human needs — e.g., food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and reasonable safety — it\ntransgresses the substantive limits on state action set by the Eighth Amendment . . . .\" (Quotation and\ncitation omitted.)\nId. at 32.\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4782763729452867400&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 9/23\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\nIn order to establish an unconstitutional condition of confinement, a claimant must show both an objective element and a\nsubjective element. Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 298 (1991). The objective element requires an inmate to show that his or\nher living conditions amount to a \"serious deprivation[] of basic human needs,\" Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347\n(1981), which can include denial of medical care for serious medical needs, Estelle, 429 U.S. at 102-105.\nThe subjective element requires an inmate to demonstrate that prison officials acted or failed to act with deliberate\nindifference. Id. at 106. See Torres, 427 Mass. at 614. \"[A] prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth\nAmendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official knows of and disregards an\nexcessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn\nthat a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he [or she] must also draw the inference.\" Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S.\n825, 837 (1994). While subjective knowledge is a question of fact that a claimant must establish, and it is necessary to\ndistinguish between obvious risks and a prison official's actual knowledge of the risk, where the risk is so obvious that a\nreasonable person would realize it, \"a factfinder may conclude that a prison official knew of a substantial risk from the very\nfact that the risk was obvious.\" Id. at 842.\nb. Risk of contracting COVID-19 in the Commonwealth's prisons.\nAs stated, an inmate asserting unconstitutional conditions of confinement first must establish, objectively, that the conditions\npose a \"substantial risk of serious harm.\" See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834, citing Helling, 509 U.S. at 35. See also Rhodes, 452\nU.S. at 347 (Eighth Amendment violation requires showing that living conditions amount to \"serious deprivation of basic\nhuman needs,\" including denial of medical care for serious medical needs).\nThe defendants contend that the incarcerated plaintiffs will be unable to establish the objective component of their deliberate\nindifference claim; they argue,\n\"No prisoner has been forced to endure an extreme deprivation or even an unreasonable risk to their health\nor safety. The measures mentioned above, such as increased cleaning and sanitizing operations, distribution\nof PPE to all inmates and staff, posting of educational and institutional flyers and memoranda, and\nencouraging social distancing as much as possible, rival that which is being done in the community to help\ncombat the spread of an insidious disease that all Americans, inmate or not, are at risk of contracting.\"\nWe do not agree. Notwithstanding the claim that no inmate has had to endure an unreasonable risk to health or safety as a\nresult of being incarcerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no real dispute that the increased risk of\ncontracting COVID-19 in prisons, where physical distancing may be infeasible to maintain, has been recognized by the CDC\nand by courts across the country.[16] See, e.g., Baez vs. Moniz, U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 20-10753-LTS (D. Mass. May 18, 2020)\n(\"There is, and can be, no meaningful dispute that COVID-19 presents a substantial risk of serious harm to health, to the\nproposed class of petitioners in this case as well as to members of society at large\"); Refunjol vs. Adducci, U.S. Dist. Ct.,\nNo. 2:20-cv-2099 (S.D. Ohio May 14, 2020) (\"The objective component of the inquiry is beyond debate. Nobody can dispute\nthat COVID-19 is a sufficiently serious medical need. . . .\"); Frazier vs. Kelley, U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 4:20-cv-00434-KGB (E.D.\nArk. May 4, 2020) (\"[I]t cannot be disputed that COVID-19 poses an objectively serious health risk to named plaintiffs and\nthe putative classes given the nature of the disease and the congregate living environment of the . . . facilities\").\nHaving concluded that the incarcerated plaintiffs almost certainly will succeed in establishing the objective component of\ntheir claims under the Eighth Amendment, we turn to consideration of the subjective component, i.e., whether the plaintiffs\nare likely to be able to establish deliberate indifference on the part of the defendants.\n4. Deliberate indifference.\na. Applicable standard.\n\"While Estelle[, 429 U.S. at 105-106,] establishes that deliberate indifference entails something more than mere negligence,\nthe cases are also clear that it is satisfied by something less than acts or omissions for the very purpose of causing harm or\nwith knowledge that harm will result.\" Farmer, 511 U.S. at 835. \"With deliberate indifference lying somewhere between the\npoles of negligence on the one end and purpose or knowledge at the other,\" courts frequently have described it as\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4782763729452867400&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 10/23\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\n\"recklessly disregarding\" a substantial risk of harm. Id. at 836, and cases cited. In other words, the subjective standard for\ndeliberate indifference requires the same showing of \"subjective recklessness\" as would apply in the criminal context. Id. at\n839-840.\nThis is not a static determination. In a suit for prospective relief, \"the subjective factor, deliberate indifference, should be\ndetermined in light of the prison authorities' current attitudes and conduct,\" including \"their attitudes and conduct at the time\nsuit is brought and persisting thereafter.\" Farmer, 511 U.S. at 845, quoting Helling, 509 U.S. at 36. In making the requisite\nshowing of subjective culpability, the prisoner may rely \"on developments that postdate the pleadings and pretrial motions,\nas [prison officials] may rely on such developments to show that the [prisoner] is not entitled to an injunction.\" Farmer, supra\nat 846.\nb.Analysis.[17] Following the United States Supreme Court's reasoning in Estelle, 429 U.S. at 106, and Helling, 509 U.S. at\n32-33, concerning prison officials' Eighth Amendment duty to take reasonable steps to protect inmates from the spread of\nserious communicable diseases, inmates across the country have brought a variety of actions successfully challenging the\npolicies, or lack of policies, of prison officials regarding the spread of contagious diseases and other conditions that threaten\nhealth throughout a prison. In Lareau v. Manson, 651 F.2d 96, 109 (2d Cir. 1981), for example, the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit applied this line of reasoning to hold prison officials liable for violating the Eighth Amendment\nwhen they made no efforts to screen incoming inmates for contagious diseases, despite significant overcrowding that further\nheightened the risk of infection. The court held that aggrieved prisoners need not demonstrate that \"an infectious disease\nhas actually spread in an overcrowded jail before issuing a remedy.\" Id. See, e.g., DeGidio v. Pung, 920 F.2d 525, 533 (8th\nCir. 1990) (prison officials were deliberately indifferent to inmates' serious medical needs by consistent pattern of reckless or\nnegligent conduct in failing to prevent and control prison's tuberculosis epidemic); Dunn v. White, 880 F.2d 1188, 1195 (10th\nCir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1059 (1990) (observing that prison's failure to protect incarcerated inmates from human\nimmunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection may violate Eighth Amendment); Smith v. Sullivan, 553 F.2d 373, 380 (5th Cir. 1977)\n(concluding that housing scabies — and gonorrhea — infected inmates with healthy prisoners violates Eighth Amendment).\nWhere the risk of serious harm is substantial, but prison officials have undertaken significant steps to try to reduce the harm\nand protect inmates, courts have concluded that there was no Eighth Amendment liability.[18] In Butler v. Fletcher, 465 F.3d\n340, 345 (8th Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 550 U.S. 917 (2007), for example, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth\nCircuit determined that the sheriff in charge of a county jail was not deliberately indifferent to the risk of a tuberculosis\ninfection within the jail where the county adopted \"policies [that] specifically acknowledged the risk and promulgated detailed\nprocedures for the diagnosis, segregation, and treatment of . . . inmates infected with active cases of [tuberculosis].\" See\nJohnson v. United States, 816 F. Supp. 1519, 1522-1525 (N.D. Ala. 1993) (applying reasoning in Lareau, 651 F.2d at 109,\nand concluding that inmate did not establish violation of Eighth Amendment from being housed in cell with patient who was\ndying from acquired immune deficiency syndrome, where prison officials' policies educated inmates on \"universal\nprecautions\" and prohibited type of high risk behavior that could result in HIV infection).\nWhile there are as yet no appellate court decisions on claims asserting a violation of the Eighth Amendment due to the\nincreased risk of exposure to COVID-19 in prisons, a number of Federal District Courts have considered the issue using a\nsimilar analysis. For example, in Baez, No. 20-10753-LTS, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\nconcluded that the inmate-petitioners had not established a likelihood of success on the merits. Given prison officials' \"many\nmeasures and policies aimed at keeping COVID-19 from entering the facility,\" and the \"meaningful actions\" undertaken\n\"aimed at controlling and mitigating against the spread of COVID-19 within the facility,\" the plaintiffs were unlikely to show\nthat prison officials had been \"obdurate, wonton, or reckless with respect to [the risk of COVID-19], or . . . otherwise failed to\ntake reasonable steps aimed at preventing or mitigating the risk that COVID-19 presents to those detained.\" Id. In Kevin\nM.A. vs. Decker, U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 20-4593 (KM) (D.N.J. May 1, 2020), the United States District Court for the District of\nNew Jersey concluded that, due to the \"numerous affirmative steps to try and stop the spread of COVID-19\" taken by jail\nofficials, and the \"protocols for individuals who exhibit symptoms,\" the inmate-petitioner had failed to demonstrate deliberate\nindifference, notwithstanding that he became ill with COVID-19 while in custody.\nTo combat the spread of COVID-19 as far as possible, the DOC has undertaken a number of measures, set forth in the\nappointed judge's findings of fact, many of which are stipulated to by the parties. These measures included lockdowns of the\nfacilities; prohibiting all outside visitors; restrictions and self-examination on entry to any facility; isolation of symptomatic\ninmates and those who have tested positive; requiring staff to stay home for fourteen days if they have any symptoms;\nmandating that staff wear masks when in contact with inmates; distribution of additional cleaning supplies to all inmates;\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4782763729452867400&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 11/23\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\nincreased cleaning of frequently touched surfaces; making alcohol-based hand sanitizer available to inmates in numerous\nfacilities; having inmates eat in their cells or housing units rather than at tables in larger groups; and instructions, posters,\nand information on COVID-19 and its spread, in both Spanish and English. To reduce inmates congregating in close contact\nwith each other, the DOC has eliminated most group programming, work release, and academic and job skills classes, as\nwell as outdoor recreation time and access to gyms and libraries, i.e., any activities where groups of inmates would be\ntogether.\nOver the course of this litigation, the DOC has obtained and distributed PPE to staff and, recently, all inmates. It has\nrequired that staff in contact with inmates, and all inmates who leave their cells or dormitories, wear masks at all times. The\nDOC also recently has instituted some limited amount of outdoor time for all inmates, in small groups approximately every\nfour days, so that physical distancing can be maintained.\nIn evaluating whether deliberate indifference has been established, courts often have examined guidelines and standards\nfrom professional associations and State codes. \"Published standards of medical care or adopted guidelines such as the\ntuberculosis manuals . . . do not establish absolute standards for measuring the constitutionality of official actions. But\nneither may they be ignored by [S]tate officials, however. Such standards and guidelines are useful measures for\n`determining whether contemporary standards of decency have been met.'\" DeGidio v. Pung, 704 F. Supp 922, 956 (D.\nMinn. 1989), aff'd, 920 F.2d 525 (8th Cir. 1980), quoting Ramos v. Lamm, 639 F.2d 559, 567 n.10 (10th Cir. 1980), cert.\ndenied, 450 U.S. 1041 (1981). See, e.g., Lareau, 651 F.2d at 106 (\"To inform itself of contemporary standards, the district\ncourt considered correctional guidelines and standards from a number of organizations\"). See also Williams v. Edwards, 547\nF.2d 1206, 1214 (5th Cir. 1977) (\"In the past we have affirmed findings of constitutional violations based in part on [S]tate\ncode violations. . . . Such a standard is a valuable reference for what is minimal for human habitation in the public view, thus\nserving as an indicator of evolving notions of decency\" [quotation and citation omitted]).\nAt oral argument, the plaintiffs were unable to point to any area in which they assert that the DOC is not in compliance with\nthe CDC's interim guidance on prisons and jails with respect to COVID-19. When questioned, the plaintiffs conceded that\nthe DOC in fact is in compliance with all CDC interim guidance for correctional facilities. While compliance with professional\nguidance is not enough, on its own, to establish constitutionality (or a lack thereof), see Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 543\nn.27 (1979), such compliance does provide useful indications to be considered in conjunction with other factors, see Ramos,\n639 F.2d at 567 n.10 (\"a variance from [S]tate standards or from standards promulgated by certain professional\norganizations does not establish a per se constitutional violation[;] it is a factor to be considered in determining whether\ncontemporary standards of decency have been met\"). The DOC's current compliance with CDC's interim guidance weighs\nagainst a determination that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims.\nAnother notable factor is the DOC's current widespread testing program. As stated, testing, contact tracing, and quarantine\nare considered the sine qua non of any effort to control the COVID-19 pandemic. See generally Interim Guidance, supra. On\nMarch 19, 2020, the DOC first tested a symptomatic inmate for COVID-19. Thereafter during that early period, only inmates\nwho presented as symptomatic, or, in a few cases, those who had been in close contact with an inmate who had tested\npositive, were being tested for COVID-19. When the plaintiffs first commenced this action, the special master in CPCS v.\nTrial Court, 484 Mass. at 456-457 (Appendix B), was presenting daily reports showing little to no testing for COVID-19 at\nmany facilities, and, in particular, no testing of inmates at facilities where a correction officer or other staff member had\ntested positive for COVID-19. Based on the special master's reports, the plaintiffs and the amicus American Civil Liberties\nUnion urged this court to conclude that there had been an Eighth Amendment violation due to an apparent lack of basic\ncontact tracing, testing, and isolation, as recommended by the CDC, and asked us to order testing of all inmates in DOC\nfacilities. At the same time, when the complaint in this case first was filed, and even after the matter was assigned to the\nSuperior Court judge for fact finding, the DOC was asserting difficulty in obtaining tests and a shortage of tests in all\nfacilities.\nSince that initial period of a few tests for symptomatic inmates, if a test was recommended by an individual clinician and as\ntests were available, the DOC has modified its testing strategies substantially. After oral argument in this case, and\nincreasingly throughout the month of May, the DOC has begun widespread testing of nonsymptomatic inmates, as well as\noffering testing to all correction officers upon request.\nAt oral argument, the attorney for the DOC stated that the DOC had access to 10,000 COVID-19 tests, and that the DOC\nwas planning a large-scale testing program. In response to requests by this court for additional information on the subject\npursuant to Mass. R. A. P. 16(l), the DOC clarified that, as of May 11, 2020, it had 2,073 tests in its possession, was using a\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4782763729452867400&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 12/23\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\nmobile testing van to conduct tests, had been assured that there was now no limit on the number of tests that it would be\nable to obtain, and had begun to implement a system-wide testing plan. Under this plan, all inmates and all staff at each\nfacility, regardless of whether they are symptomatic, will be offered tests, and all facilities will have been tested by May 31,\n2020, following a schedule of approximately two days of testing at each site.\nCurrent widespread DOC testing efforts, if continued as planned, will provide much of the testing relief that the plaintiffs, and\nthe amicus American Civil Liberties Union, urge this court to order. This further supports the conclusion that the plaintiffs are\nnot likely to succeed on the merits of their claims for violations of the Eighth Amendment.\nIn sum, on this record, it appears unlikely that the plaintiffs will be able to establish deliberate indifference on the part of the\nDOC regarding their conditions of confinement as a result of the pandemic. We turn to consider their claims for violations of\nsubstantive due process.\n5. Substantive due process claims for individuals committed under G. L. 123,\n§ 35.\nThe plaintiffs argue that commitment to a secured facility for substance abuse treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic\nviolates committed individuals' substantive due process rights.\na. Professional judgment.\nIn Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315-316, individuals who had been civilly committed based on intellectual disabilities brought\nsubstantive due process challenges regarding their conditions of confinement. The United States Supreme Court concluded\nthat, \"[i]f it is cruel and unusual punishment to hold convicted criminals in unsafe conditions, it must be unconstitutional to\nconfine the involuntarily committed — who may not be punished at all — in unsafe conditions.\" Id. Therefore, \"when the\nState takes a person into its custody and holds him [or her] there against his [or her] will the Constitution imposes upon it a\ncorresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his [or her] safety and general well-being.\" DeShaney v. Winnebago\nCounty Dep't of Social Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 199-200 (1989), citing Youngberg, supra at 317. See Williams v. Hartman, 413\nMass. 398, 403 (1992).\nRelying on these holdings, the plaintiffs maintain that commitment for substance abuse treatment during the COVID-19\npandemic creates unsafe conditions of confinement. Under Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 323, however, to establish a violation of\nsubstantive due process, it is not sufficient to allege only that conditions are unsafe. Rather, the test is whether a \"decision\nby [a] professional is such a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards as to\ndemonstrate that the person responsible actually did not base the decision on such a judgment.\"[19] See Hopper v.\nCallahan, 408 Mass. 621, 626-627 (1990), quoting Youngberg, supra.\nThe plaintiffs contend that commitment to a secured facility during the COVID-19 pandemic is so contrary to substance\nabuse treatment principles that it necessarily constitutes a substantial departure from professional judgment. They rely on\nthe COVID-19 guidance from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), an entity within\nthe United States Department of Health and Human Services, which states that residential treatment \"has not been shown\nto be superior to intensive outpatient treatment.\" Therefore, \"[b]ecause of the substantial risk of coronavirus spread with\ncongregation of individuals in a limited space such as in an inpatient or residential facility, SAMHSA is advising that\noutpatient treatment options, when clinically appropriate, be used to the greatest extent possible.\" SAMHSA, Considerations\nfor the Care and Treatment of Mental and Substance Use Disorders in the COVID-19 Epidemic (rev. May 7, 2020).\nContrary to the plaintiffs' characterizations, this guidance does not state that inpatient treatment is never advisable during\nthe pandemic. Rather, SAMHSA states that \"[i]npatient facilities and residential programs should be reserved for those for\nwhom outpatient measures are not considered an adequate clinical option[, such as] those with mental disorders that are life\nthreatening.\" Id. Commitment under G. L. c. 123, § 35, intended to be a \"carefully circumscribed . . . tool of last resort,\" by\ndefinition is limited to situations in which the individual poses a likelihood of serious harm. See Matter of a Minor, 484 Mass.\n295, 311 (2020). If outpatient treatment, or any other plausibly available option, would \"bring the risk of harm below the\nstatutory thresholds that define a likelihood of serious harm,\" a judge may not commit the subject of a petition to any facility,\nsecure or unsecure. See id. at 310, citing Matter of G.P., 473 Mass. at 128-129.\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4782763729452867400&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 13/23\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\nCommitment to a secure facility requires an additional finding that an unsecure facility is unavailable or insufficient. See G.\nL.c. 123, § 35. Once committed, the superintendent of the facility may release an individual early if there is not a likelihood\nof serious harm. See id. These restrictions, if followed, should limit commitment to individuals \"for whom outpatient\nmeasures are not considered an adequate clinical option,\" as recommended by SAMHSA.\nThe plaintiffs have presented no evidence of individuals having been committed in contravention of these requirements.\nNonetheless, the plaintiffs maintain that commitment for substance use disorder during the pandemic constitutes a violation\nof professional judgment in every case. Without a more complete factual record, and without expert guidance, we are not\nable to reach such a broad conclusion.\nb. Reasonable relation. The plaintiffs argue also that civil commitment for\nsubstance abuse treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic does not\nadvance sufficiently the treatment goals of G. L. c. 123, § 35, and therefore\nviolates their substantive due process rights. Due process under the Federal\nConstitution \"requires that the conditions and duration of confinement under\nthe [statute] bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which persons\nare committed.\" Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250, 265 (2001), citing Foucha v.\nLouisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 79 (1992). As the DOC notes in its opposition,\nhowever, under the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, civil commitment\nis subject to a higher level of judicial review, i.e., strict scrutiny. See Matter\nof a Minor, 484 Mass. at 309. Under strict scrutiny review, a statute cannot\nstand unless it is \"narrowly tailored to further a legitimate and compelling\ngovernmental interest and [is] the least restrictive means available to\nvindicate that interest.\" Commonwealth v. Weston W., 455 Mass. 24, 35\n(2009).\nBoth the \"reasonable relation\" standard and review under strict scrutiny require the government to identify a purpose for\nwhich a statute was enacted, and to show how the government action is connected to that purpose. Review under strict\nscrutiny, however, requires the government meet a much higher burden for both elements of the test. Rather than simply\nidentifying a permissible purpose, the government must show that the statute is designed to address a compelling\ngovernment interest. Otherwise put, here, rather than requiring only that the civil confinement be reasonably related to the\ngovernment's interest, the confinement must be narrowly tailored to that interest as well as the least restrictive means by\nwhich to accomplish the intended goal.\nBecause the plaintiffs presented their arguments to us under the Federal standard, we address it first. In Doe v. Gaughan,\n808 F.2d 871, 874 (1st Cir. 1986), the plaintiffs argued that, because they were committed to a correctional institution, rather\nthan a mental health facility, the nature of their confinement was not reasonably related to the purpose for which they were\nconfined. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit disagreed; the court concluded that the secure facility bore\na \"reasonable relationship both to the [S]tate's public safety needs and to the patients' own therapeutic interests in a secure\nenvironment.\" See id. at 878. Conversely, in Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 738-739 (1972), the United States Supreme\nCourt held that the confinement of an incompetent defendant for more than three years bore no reasonable relation to his\ncommitment because there was no substantial probability of his becoming competent.\nGeneral Laws c. 123, § 35, states that the purpose of commitment is \"inpatient care for the treatment of an alcohol or\nsubstance use disorder.\" This treatment is intended to promote the health and safety of the individual committed and others,\nas demonstrated by the statutory requirement that a committed individual pose a danger to him- or herself, or a member of\nthe community. See G. L. c. 123, § 35. Therefore, if patients are not receiving meaningful and reasonably effective treatment\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4782763729452867400&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 14/23\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\nfor substance use disorders, which advances their health and safety, their commitment violates Federal due process\nrequirements.\nThe DOC and the Hampden County sheriff's office report that committed individuals are held for the first fourteen days in a\nseparate unit and do not participate in group programming. The plaintiffs argue that, during those fourteen days, committed\nindividuals receive \"next to no treatment,\" and thus that their confinement bears no reasonable relationship to the purpose of\ncommitment. The DOC reports, however, that after an initial three-day observation period has ended, and the individual has\nbeen \"detox cleared,\" the individual receives daily \"individual services\" from a substance abuse disorder counsellor. The\nHampden County sheriff's office reports that individuals receive substance abuse treatment during their first fourteen days of\ncommitment. The record contains no information regarding the nature and extent of these services.\nWe agree that, if the first fourteen days involve no real treatment, or only minimal treatment, the plaintiffs would have a\nstrong claim. The DOC's deputy commissioner of clinical services and reentry avers that many individuals are released after\nthirty days of confinement. As the plaintiffs note, the first fourteen days of confinement account for almost one-half of the\ntotal period of commitment for those individuals. Without more information regarding the limited treatment provided,\nhowever, and without expert testimony regarding the efficacy of that limited treatment, we cannot conclude that commitment\nduring the pandemic bears no reasonable relation to the purposes of the statute.\nc. Strict scrutiny.\nAs stated, the plaintiffs' complaint and its arguments before this court rest on substantive due process requirements under\nthe Federal standard. Because civil commitment involves a loss of liberty, a fundamental constitutional right, however, we\nalso consider the plaintiffs' constitutional claims under the more stringent standard embodied in the Massachusetts\nDeclaration of Rights. \"In substantive due process analysis, the nature of the individual interest at stake determines the\nstandard of review that courts apply when deciding whether a challenged statute meets the requirements of the due process\nclause.\" Aime v. Commonwealth, 414 Mass. 667, 673 (1993). See R.B., petitioner, 479 Mass. 712, 717-718 (2018);\nCommonwealth v. Travis, 372 Mass. 238, 246 (1977).\nFreedom from physical restraint is a paradigmatic fundamental right, essential to a free society. See Pembroke Hosp. v.\nD.L., 482 Mass. 346, 347 (2019), citing Matter of E.C., 479 Mass. 113, 119 (2018). Civil commitment under G. L. c. 123, §\n35, thus is subject to strict scrutiny under the due process protections in the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.\nAccordingly, the statute \"must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest\" and \"also be the least\nrestrictive means available to vindicate that interest.\" Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. v. C.R., 484 Mass. 472, 489 (2020).\nHere, the question whether G. L. c. 123, § 35, could survive strict scrutiny review, absent a pandemic, is not before us. As\nnothing in the plaintiffs' filings or the record touches on the question of strict scrutiny, we assume without deciding, as we did\nin Matter of a Minor, 484 Mass. at 309 n.9, that the statute at baseline does not violate substantive due process.\nAccordingly, we examine whether the current public health crisis alters the strict scrutiny analysis such that commitment to a\nsecure facility during the COVID-19 pandemic must be unconstitutional.\nAs stated, the purpose of commitment for substance abuse treatment is to promote the health and safety of the committed\nindividual and others through such treatment. We have no evidence that the dangers of substance use disorders, or the\nneed for treatment, have diminished during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, issues regarding COVID-19 have no impact on\nthe question whether there is a compelling and legitimate government interest.\nThe pandemic, however, may affect whether commitment is narrowly tailored to that interest. If the commitment and\ntreatment do not promote effectively the government's interest in the individual's and others' health and safety, the\ngovernment action cannot survive strict scrutiny. See Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 333 (2003) (\"means chosen . . .\nmust be specifically and narrowly framed to accomplish [their] purpose\" [citation omitted]). In this regard, the increased risk\nof COVID-19 transmission in congregate settings is highly pertinent.\nAs we recognized in CPCS v. Trial Court, 484 Mass. at 436, \"confined, enclosed environments increase transmissibility\" of\nCOVID-19. \"[M]aintaining six feet of distance between oneself and others . . . may be nearly impossible\" in these settings.\nId. As with the jails and prisons at issue in that case, \"proper sanitation is also a challenge\" for the commitment facilities, as\nshown by DPH inspections in January and February of 2020, identifying dozens of repeat violations at MASAC and the\nStonybrook facilities.[20] Id. at 436-437.\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4782763729452867400&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 15/23\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\nAt the same time, these facilities have taken significant steps to lessen the risk of transmission of COVID-19. Staff members\nare required to wear masks when in contact with patients, as well as gloves for some activities, and all committed individuals\nhave been given masks. Newly committed individuals are placed in a separate unit for the first fourteen days and are not\npermitted to attend group sessions. All persons entering the facilities are screened for symptoms of COVID-19. Soap and\nhand sanitizer are widely available, and multiple other hygiene-related protocols have been instituted.\nAlthough the expert affidavits discuss the general risk of transmission in correctional facilities, they do not specifically\naddress conditions at MASAC or in the Stonybrook facilities. Nor do they address whether the pandemic changes the need\nfor or the efficacy of commitment to a secure facility for substance use disorder treatment. Moreover, on this record, the\nplaintiffs have not presented evidence indicating that a less restrictive alternative would have been sufficient to avoid a\nlikelihood of serious harm for any currently committed individuals. See Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., 484 Mass. at 483-484\n(\"record . . . reveals no realistic alternative\"). Given the limited record before us, we cannot say that there has been a\nfundamental change in the need for or efficacy of commitment.[21] We conclude that the plaintiffs have not shown a\nlikelihood of success on the merits. See Garcia v. Department of Hous. & Community Dev., 480 Mass. 736, 747 (2018).\nNonetheless, we see fit to address the situation under our supervisory authority. Going forward, a judge shall not commit an\nindividual under G. L. c. 123, § 35, unless the judge finds that the danger posed by the individual's substance use disorder\noutweighs the risk of transmission of COVID-19 in congregate settings. \"Given the high risk posed by COVID-19 for people\nwho are more than sixty years of age or who suffer from a high-risk condition as defined by the CDC, the age and health of\n[the individual] should be factored into [the] determination.\" CPCS v. Trial Court, 484 Mass. at 449. Additionally, the judge\nmust find that commitment is necessary notwithstanding the treatment limitations imposed by quarantine protocols. A\njudge's findings may be made in writing or orally on the record. These requirements will remain in effect for the duration of\nthe COVID-19 state of emergency, unless altered by further order of this court. These are additional, temporary\nrequirements beyond those imposed by G. L. c. 123, § 35, due process principles, and any other applicable law. See Matter\nof a Minor, 484 Mass. at 307-310; Matter of G.P., 473 Mass. at 120-122, 124-129.\nFurthermore, as with the bail determinations that were the subject of much of our decision in CPCS v. Trial Court, 484 Mass.\nat 434-436, current orders of commitment may have been made without consideration of the crisis currently ravaging the\nplanet. We therefore conclude that the risks of COVID-19 transmission constitute a \"material change in circumstances\" with\nregard to any order of commitment currently in effect. See Littles v. Commissioner of Correction, 444 Mass. 871, 878 (2005);\nCommonwealth v. Cronk, 396 Mass. 194, 196 (1985). See also CPCS v. Trial Court, supra at 435 (\"risks inherent in the\nCOVID-19 pandemic constitute a changed circumstance\" under bail statutes). Any individual who is committed pursuant to\nG.L. c. 123, § 35, at the time of the issuance of the slip opinion in this case may file a motion for reconsideration of the\ncommitment order. Hearings shall take place by videoconference or teleconference no later than two business days after the\nfiling of the motion. A decision on the motion shall be rendered promptly.\n6. Ongoing response to the continuing pandemic.\nConditions as a result of the pandemic, and society's response to them, are changing rapidly. The CDC's interim guidance\nitself states that it is subject to change and that individual guidelines \"may need to be adapted based on individual facilities'\nphysical space, staffing, population, operations, and other resources and conditions.\" Interim Guidance, supra at 1. While\nthe court acknowledges the DOC's significant efforts to reduce the risks for incarcerated individuals due to the pandemic, to\ndate the crisis generated by the pandemic continues worldwide. All of the defendants must remain vigilant in continuing to\nrespond swiftly to ongoing and changed conditions brought about as a result of the pandemic, while retaining the testing,\ncontact tracing, and quarantining policies they now have put in place, that the CDC recognizes as the heart of any plan to\ncombat the pandemic.\nMoreover, as the commissioner's counsel acknowledged at oral argument, while the pandemic continues, the lockdown\nconditions instituted by the DOC to prevent a serious risk of harm themselves risk becoming Eighth Amendment violations.\nThe CDC's interim guidance notes that measures taken by correction facilities to reduce transmission of COVID-19, such as\ncanceling activities and visitation, may be deleterious to the mental health of inmates. These effects necessarily will be even\nmore pronounced for inmates in solitary cells, who are segregated from all other humans for twenty-three or more hours per\nday. Solitary confinement, even when imposed for good reason, \"bears `a . . . terror and peculiar mark of infamy.'\" See Davis\nv.Ayala, 135 S. Ct. 2187, 2209 (2015) (Kennedy, J., concurring), quoting In re Medley, 134 U.S. 160, 170 (1890). \"\n[C]ommon side-effects of solitary confinement include anxiety, panic, withdrawal, hallucinations, self-mutilation, and suicidal\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4782763729452867400&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 16/23\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\nthoughts and behaviors.\" Davis, supra at 2210, citing Grassian, Psychiatric Effects of Solitary Confinement, 22 Wash. U.J.L.\n& Pol'y 325 (2006). \"Suicides, attempts at suicide, and self-mutilations are common among inmates thus confined.\" Ruiz v.\nEstelle, 503 F. Supp. 1265, 1360 (S.D. Tex. 1980), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 679 F.2d 1115, amended in part, vacated in\npart, 688 F.2d 266 (5th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1042 (1983). Thus, \"even the permissible forms of solitary\nconfinement might violate the Eighth Amendment if [i]mposed . . . for too long a period\" (quotations and citation omitted).\nJackson v. Meachum, 699 F.2d 578, 582 (1st Cir. 1983). See Hardwick v. Ault, 447 F. Supp. 116, 126 (M.D. Ga. 1978)\n(\"indefinite duration of confinement shock[ed] the conscience,\" especially in cell block \"where prisoners [would] go for\nseveral days without leaving their cell except briefly\").\nSimilarly, deprivation of exercise may be \"`reasonable' in certain situations, such as during a `state of emergency.'\" Thomas\nv.Ponder, 611 F.3d 1144, 1155 (9th Cir. 2010). Long-term \"deprivation of exercise\" on the other hand, \"may constitute an\nimpairment of health forbidden under the [E]ighth [A]mendment.\" Miller v. Carson, 563 F.2d 741, 751 n.12 (5th Cir. 1977),\nciting Estelle, 429 U.S. at 97. See Spain v. Procunier, 600 F.2d 189, 199 (9th Cir. 1979) (\"denial of fresh air and regular\noutdoor exercise and recreation [over period of years] constitutes cruel and unusual punishment\"); Ruiz, 503 F. Supp. at\n1367 (\"Even if accomplished according to appropriate procedures and for valid reasons, long term confinement of inmates in\nadministrative segregation, without opportunities for recreation, constitutes cruel and unusual punishment\"); Sinclair v.\nHenderson, 331 F. Supp. 1123, 1131 (E.D. La. 1971) (\"Confinement for long periods of time without the opportunity for\nregular outdoor exercise does, as a matter of law, constitute cruel and unusual punishment . . .\").\nAt this juncture, it appears that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to demand extraordinary, and coordinated, efforts by\nall parties, as well as the courts. This is so also with respect to the different entities within the executive branch. Even the\ncommissioner acknowledged at oral argument that reducing the number of incarcerated individuals being held in any given\nfacility, if it can be done lawfully, is a desirable goal for controlling the spread of communicable diseases such as COVID-19.\nIn their brief, the plaintiffs point to numerous measures that they assert have been undertaken in other States to reduce\nprison populations, among them release to home confinement, enhanced good time sentence deductions, and early parole.\nWith respect to one such measure, release to home confinement for those who have been serving a sentence, for example,\nthe commissioner asserted before the hearing judge that she believes the DOC has no authority to authorize such releases\nfor inmates who are serving sentences. We agree with Chief Justice Gants that G. L. c. 127, §§ 48, 49, 49A, and this court's\nholding in Donohue, 452 Mass. at 265, indeed would allow the commissioner to release certain individuals who currently are\nserving a sentence in a prison or house of correction to home confinement, under specified conditions, prior to the\ncompletion of their committed sentences, for certain educational, employment, and training programs. See post at.\nThe specific measures the defendants might choose to reduce the number of incarcerated individuals in DOC custody are\nnot as important as the goal of reduction, and not ordinarily for a court to decide. Nonetheless, the DOC's argument that,\ndue to concerns regarding separation of powers under art. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, this court would\nnever have authority to order a reduction in the prison population is unavailing; should the court conclude, at a later point,\nthat the defendants have held inmates under unconstitutional conditions of confinement, it would have authority to issue\norders necessary to remedy that situation.\nAs two justices of the United States Supreme Court commented recently with respect to the determination by a United\nStates Court of Appeals to stay a Federal District Court judge's order granting a preliminary injunction sought by a group of\nparticularly vulnerable incarcerated inmates due to their conditions of confinement, \"[i]t has long been said that a society's\nworth can be judged by taking stock of its prisons. That is all the truer in this pandemic, where inmates everywhere have\nbeen rendered vulnerable and often powerless to protect themselves from harm. May we hope that our country's facilities\nserve as models rather than cautionary tales.\" Valentine vs. Collier, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 19A1034 (May 14, 2020).\nConclusion.\nThe motion for a preliminary injunction is denied. The matter is transferred to the Superior Court, where litigation on the\ncomplaint shall proceed as an emergency matter, with due speed in consideration of the circumstances, before the same\nSuperior Court judge who was designated to make findings of fact with respect to the motion for a preliminary injunction. In\naddition to rulings on the merits, the judge shall resolve all questions of class certification, including any amendment of the\ncomplaint or substitution of parties.\nSo ordered.\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4782763729452867400&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 17/23\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\nGANTS, C.J. (concurring, with whom Lenk and Budd, JJ., join).\nThe essence of this case is summarized in a single sentence in the judge's findings of fact: \"Commissioner Mici\n[(commissioner)] believes that [the Department of Correction (DOC)] is doing the best it can to manage the COVID-19 crisis\ngiven the physical layout of the facilities and the inmate population.\" The record supports her belief that the DOC is doing\n\"the best it can\" to attempt to prevent the COVID-19 virus from entering prisons and to limit its spread within the facilities\nthat it has entered. And it is likely true that, for all practical purposes, the \"physical layout\" of prison facilities is a \"given,\" in\nthat it cannot be materially altered quickly enough to make a significant difference.\nBut even acknowledging that public safety would not permit a drastic reduction of the prison population, the inmate\npopulation is not a \"given.\" The commissioner herself recognizes, as do the World Health Organization[1] and the United\nStates Department of Justice,[2] that measures should be taken to reduce the inmate population and that doing so can help\nto contain the spread of COVID-19. To be sure, the commissioner makes clear that any such reduction should be done in a\nmanner that is consistent with law and appropriate in light of the health and safety of the public. I agree, and I write\nseparately from the court's opinion (with which I wholeheartedly agree) to make three points. First, there is considerably\nmore that the DOC and the parole board can do to reduce the inmate population, consistent with law and appropriate in\nterms of public health and safety. Second, as the pandemic drags on, it is even more important to press forward with such\nreductions because the current lockdown that is being used by the DOC to contain the virus cannot reasonably continue\nindefinitely. And third, although what the DOC and parole board are doing now may not likely demonstrate a reckless\ndisregard for the health and safety of prisoners arising from the risk of transmission of the COVID-19 virus, continuing\nunchanged along that same path in the months ahead might constitute reckless disregard, especially if we are hit with a new\nwave of COVID-19 cases.\n1. More can be done to reduce the prison population.\nIn 2019, approximately 600 inmates were released each month from DOC custody. Those releases were offset by 557\nadmissions per month, yielding a net monthly reduction of 43 inmates. However, as a result of the pandemic, the number of\ncriminal admissions has dramatically fallen, from 190 in January and 161 in February 2020, to 87 in March and 15 in April.\nGiven the sharp reduction in criminal admissions, one would expect that the over-all prison population would naturally fall,\nand it has by approximately eight percent between January 1 and May 21.[3] But the vast majority of this decrease arises\nfrom the drop in admissions; actual releases grew only modestly in April 2020 to 526 (compared to an average of 424 in\nJanuary through March 2020), with virtually all of the increase in releases arising from an increase in parole permits in April\nto 141 (compared to a monthly average of 52 in January through March 2020). In contrast, the county jail population, in\nlarge part fueled by our decision in Committee for Pub. Counsel Servs. v. Chief Justice of the Trial Court, 484 Mass. 431\n(2020), fell more than thirty per cent between April 5 and May 21, 2020. See May 21, 2020 Special Master's Report. To be\nsure, it is far easier to release detainees who have yet to be tried than sentenced prisoners. But the fact remains that more\ninmates can be released in accordance with law, without compromising public health and safety.\na. Home confinement.\nThe commissioner claims that she does not have the legal authority to allow any sentenced prisoner to serve any part of a\nprison sentence in home confinement. The commissioner is mistaken.\nUnder G. L. c. 127, § 48, \"[t]he commissioner shall establish and maintain education, training and employment programs for\npersons committed to the custody of the [DOC]. . . . Such programs shall include opportunities for academic education,\nvocational education, vocational training, other related prevocational programs and employment, and may be made\navailable within correctional facilities or, subject to the restrictions set forth in [G. L. c. 127, §§ 49 and 86F], at other places\napproved by the commissioner or administrator\" (emphasis added). Id. General Laws c. 127, § 49, provides:\n\"The commissioner of correction, or the administrator of a county correctional facility, subject to rules and\nregulations established in accordance with the provisions of this section, may permit an inmate who has\nserved such a portion of his sentence or sentences that he would be eligible for parole within eighteen\nmonths to participate in education, training, or employment programs established under [§ 48] outside a\ncorrectional facility . . . . In the case of a committed offender who participates in any program outside a\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4782763729452867400&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 18/23\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\ncorrectional facility established under [§ 48], the time spent in such participation shall be credited toward the\nserving of his sentence in the same manner as though he had served such time within the facility. . . . The\ncommissioner or such administrator shall make and promulgate rules and regulations regarding programs\nestablished under [§ 48] outside correctional facilities. Such rules and regulations shall include provisions for\nreasonable periods of confinement to particular correctional facilities before a committed offender may be\npermitted to participate in such programs and provisions for feeding, housing and supervising participants in\nsuch programs in such manner as will be calculated to maintain morale and prevent the introduction of\ncontraband to the facility.\"[4],[5]\nIn Commonwealth v. Donahue, 452 Mass. 256 (2008), we considered whether a sheriff had the authority under § 48 and §\n49 to release a prisoner from a house of correction and place him in home confinement under a global positioning system\n(GPS) monitoring program where the prisoner had an approved home and work plan and was monitored by a GPS bracelet.\nWe concluded that \"G. L. c. 127, §§ 48, 49, and 49A, provide specific legislative authorization for the GPS program and for\nthe placement of Donohue, or similarly situated inmates, in it.\" Id. at 265. We specifically rejected the argument that these\nstatutes did not permit home confinement, declaring that \"[t]o the contrary, the statutory scheme suggests a legislative intent\nto allow this kind of arrangement.\" Id. at 266. The commissioner has the same authority under these statutes to place\nprisoners in home confinement, monitored by a GPS bracelet, as part of an inmate's participation in an education, training,\nor employment program.\nGeneral Laws c. 127, § 49A, requires the commissioner to establish in each correctional facility a committee to evaluate the\nbehavior and conduct of inmates within the prison and recommend whether an inmate \"shall be permitted to participate in\nany program outside a correctional facility, exclusive of parole.\" There is nothing in the record regarding the activities of\nthese committees and no explanation as to why, especially at a time when the commissioner recognizes the need to reduce\nthe prison population, eligible prisoners who have demonstrated good behavior and conduct have not been approved for\nhome confinement to participate in education, employment, or training programs.\nb. Parole release.\nAs I have noted, the parole board has stepped up its pace of activity and has released nearly three times more prisoners in\nApril than it did on average in the first three months of this year. But there are at least two ways in which the parole board\ncan release more prisoners, consistent with its statutory obligation to release a prisoner on parole \"only if the board is of the\nopinion, after consideration of a risk and needs assessment, that there is a reasonable probability that, if the prisoner is\nreleased with appropriate conditions and community supervision, the prisoner will live and remain at liberty without violating\nthe law and that release is not incompatible with the welfare of society.\" G. L. c. 127, § 130.\nFirst, § 130 requires the parole board to make two determinations: whether \"there is a reasonable probability that. . . the\nprisoner will live and remain at liberty without violating the law\" and whether \"release is not incompatible with the welfare of\nsociety.\" Id. With respect to the second determination, it is appropriate for the parole board to consider whether the prisoner\nhas tested positive for COVID-19 and, if so, whether he or she could be safely quarantined and medically monitored or\ntreated upon release. But it is also appropriate for the parole board to consider the increased risk to the inmate, to fellow\ninmates, and to the general public of continuing custody in a prison where he or she is particularly vulnerable to an outbreak\nof COVID-19 given the close quarters and difficulties of social distancing in a prison. This consideration is most acute in\nprisoners who are at special risk of death or serious illness from COVID-19 because of their advanced age or compromised\nimmune system. In Christie v. Commonwealth, 484 Mass. 397, 401-402 (2020), we declared in the context of a judge's\ndetermination whether to stay a defendant's execution of sentence pending appeal:\n\"We also note that the health risks to persons in custody arising from this pandemic require that we adjust the\nanalysis applied to motions to stay the execution of sentence pending appeal. In ordinary times, in\nconsidering the second factor, a judge should focus on the danger to other persons and the community\narising from the defendant's risk of reoffense. See [Commonwealth v. Cohen (No. 2), 456 Mass. 128, 132\n(2010); Commonwealth v. Hodge (No. 1), 380 Mass. 851, 855 (1980)]. In these extraordinary times, a judge\ndeciding whether to grant a stay should consider not only the risk to others if the defendant were to be\nreleased and reoffend, but also the health risk to the defendant if the defendant were to remain in custody. In\nevaluating this risk, a judge should consider both the general risk associated with preventing COVID-19\ntransmission and minimizing its spread in correctional institutions to inmates and prison staff and the specific\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4782763729452867400&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 19/23\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\nrisk to the defendant, in view of his or her age and existing medical conditions, that would heighten the\nchance of death or serious illness if the defendant were to contract the virus.\" (Emphases in original.)\nA comparable adaptation to the pandemic should be made to the parole board's evaluation of whether \"release is not\nincompatible with the welfare of society\" under § 130.\nSecond, some inmates who are granted parole because they meet the criteria in § 130 do not promptly obtain the parole\npermits needed for release and must first obtain a transfer to a long-term residential facility or a step-down to a lower-\nsecurity facility before they can receive their permits. In this pandemic era, such a condition of release would prove a\n\"Catch-22\" situation for many inmates otherwise eligible for parole release: because all transfers among facilities have\nceased, such inmates could not meet the condition established for their release. The parole board should reevaluate all\nsuch conditions where they prevent the release of those whom the board has already determined will be unlikely to reoffend\nupon their release.\nc. Earned good time.\nThe majority of prisoners who are released from custody are released because they have completed their sentence. The\nDOC declares that it \"has no control\" over the completion of sentences. But to the extent that the commissioner has the\nauthority to grant good time credit of up to fifteen days per month under G. L. c. 127, § 129D, plus an additional ten days of\ncredit for the successful completion of a program, the commissioner has the ability to reduce a prisoner's sentence by\napproximately one-half (180 days per year if the prisoner receives fifteen days per month, and another ten days for each\ncompleted program). The pandemic put a temporary end to the programs that enabled inmates to earn good time, and the\ncommissioner deserves credit for allowing inmates to earn seven and one-half days per month by maintaining a diary. But\nwith more than two months having passed since the Governor's announcement that a state of emergency existed, it is time\nfor the commissioner to devise new programs that can be accomplished by inmates in the midst of a pandemic that would\nenable them to earn the full complement of possible good time, including completion credit, and reduce the over-all length of\ntheir sentences.\n2. Planning beyond the lockdown.\nTo prevent the COVID-19 virus from entering DOC facilities and to mitigate its spread in those facilities that already had\ncases, the commissioner initiated a system-wide lockdown on April 3, 2020. In practice, this means that inmates who are\nhoused in cells remain there for twenty-three hours a day, and those who live in dormitory-style housing cannot leave their\nunits. Inmates eat meals in their cells or units; use of gyms, weight rooms, and outdoor spaces is strictly limited; and work\nopportunities and classes have been suspended.\nThese stringent policies might have been necessary to quell the outbreak by reducing contact between inmates and by\nmaking it easier to conduct contact tracing when positive cases were identified. But while this may have averted a worst-\ncase scenario in the early days of the pandemic, the court's opinion notes that the DOC may soon face another challenge:\nthe mental health impact of an extended lockdown, with its own implications under the Eighth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution and art. 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.\nAccording to the DOC, this is the first time in recent memory that the entire Massachusetts prison system has been locked\ndown because of health risks. The longest recorded lockdown at any DOC facility lasted for four months in 1995 following an\nassault on a correction officer at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Cedar Junction. This system-wide lockdown\nhas already been in place for two months, but I believe that the DOC recognizes that it cannot reasonably continue for the\nmany months that will pass until a COVID-19 vaccine becomes widely available. The isolation arising from a lockdown over\ntime will have increasingly severe mental health ramifications, particularly in a population that already has a higher-than-\naverage prevalence of mental health issues. And if the lockdown were to continue, there may come a time when the\nlockdown itself raises serious questions about the DOC's deliberate indifference to inmate mental health.\nI do not profess to know what should be the next step beyond lockdown; I know only that there will be a need for a next step,\nthat it must be carefully considered by correctional, public health, and mental health professionals, and that, as we are\nlearning from our experience outside the prison walls, reopening to permit increased human interaction poses even more\nchallenges than the formidable challenges arising from sheltering in place. Soon, the DOC will have to develop protocols\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4782763729452867400&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 20/23\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\nthat are, to the extent possible, protective of both inmate physical health and mental health. And doing so will be easier and\nmore likely to succeed with a smaller prison population, which will provide greater potential for social distancing and give\nprison superintendents more flexibility in their use of available prison space, cells, and facilities.\n3. Planning ahead for a second wave.\nI recognize that, when it became apparent that COVID-19 had spread through Massachusetts communities, the DOC had to\nimprovise quickly and make adjustments to avoid rampant spread of the virus in its correctional facilities. But what is\nappropriate in reacting to an immediate and unpredictable threat might not be appropriate as the threat drags on over many\nmonths. Reducing the size of the prison population, especially the size of the elderly and infirm prison population, in a\nmanner that is consistent with law and public safety takes time, both to identify appropriate candidates for release and to\nensure that they have appropriate release plans. But there will be time before the fall to accomplish sensible reductions in\nthe size of the prison population, including the release or transfer to home confinement of many elderly and medically\nvulnerable prisoners, to give prison superintendents the better options to protect the physical and mental health of inmates\nthat come with fewer prisoners. With experts warning of a potential resurgence of COVID-19 in the winter, see CDC Director\nWarns Second Wave of Coronavirus Is Likely to Be Even More Devastating, Wash. Post, Apr. 21, 2020,\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/04 /21/coronavirus-second-wave-cdcdirector [https://perma.cc/3SVZ -BQCX],\nthe DOC has the opportunity and, indeed, the obligation to begin preparing for that possibility. Policies that pass\nconstitutional muster in the face of an unprecedented emergency may not be constitutionally sufficient after the department\nhas had time to consider and plan its response to a now-foreseeable threat.\n[1]On behalf of himself and all others similarly situated.\n[2]Michael Gomes, Peter Kyriakides, Richard O'Rourke, Steven Palladino, Mark Santos, David Sibinich, Michelle Tourigny, Michael White,\nFrederick Yeomans, and Hendrick Davis, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated.\n[3]Chair of the parole board, Secretary of the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, and the Governor.\n[4]The plaintiffs also asked that the Department of Correction (DOC) be enjoined from housing any inmate in a cell, dormitory, or other\nliving area that does not comply with the minimize size standards established by the Department of Public Health (DPH) as set forth in 105\nCode Mass. Regs. §§ 451.320-451.322 (2004); maintaining any medical services unit or medication distribution area in which inmates have\nto wait within six feet of each other; and transferring any inmate from a county jail to the DOC.\n[5]The parole board sought to dismiss all claims against it on the grounds that it is not responsible for conditions of confinement in DOC\nfacilities and has no control over them, and also that the plaintiffs' requests for relief exceed the bounds of the parole board's statutory\nauthority; that motion was denied. See Foster v. Commissioner of Correction (No. 2), 484 Mass., (2020) (Foster [No. 2]).\n[6]The Governor moved in this court to dismiss the claims against him on the ground of sovereign immunity; that motion was allowed, and\nthus, the Governor is no longer a party to this case. See Foster (No. 2), 484 Mass. at.\n[7]We acknowledge the amicus letters of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Association of\nCriminal Defense Lawyers; of the district attorney for the Suffolk district and Hon. Jon Santiago, pro se; and of Disability Law Center, Inc.\n[8]According to data published by the DPH, on April 17, 2020, the date the plaintiffs' complaint was filed, there were 34,402 confirmed\ncases of COVID-19 in Massachusetts. By the date of oral argument on May 7, 2020, that number had more than doubled to 73,721 cases.\nAs of May 29, there were 95,512 confirmed cases in Massachusetts.\n[9]As of May 11, 2020, thirteen percent of the prisoners in DOC custody (957 of 7,343) were age sixty or older and thirty-one percent\n(2,265) were age fifty or older.\n[10]In discussing staff, we include both those employed directly by the DOC and also vendors and subcontractors who work within\ncorrectional institutions.\n[11]The three institutions at which there have been the most significant COVID-19 outbreaks do not stand out as notably crowded. The\nMTC is at 80% of operational capacity and 94% of design capacity; MCI-Shirley (medium security) is at 81% of operational capacity and\n121% of design capacity; and MCI-Framingham is at 20% of operational capacity and 26% of design capacity.\n[12]See Robert Malloy & another vs. Department of Correction, SJC No. 12961.\n[13]The DOC maintains that Robert Peacock initially exhibited signs of withdrawal and confusion, and therefore was kept in an observation\nroom until April 28, 2020, when he was \"detox cleared.\" The DOC asserts that, on April 29, 2020, he met with a substance abuse\ncounsellor, who described the program, explained the expectations of patients, and gave him some written treatment materials.\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4782763729452867400&q=Foster+v.+Commissioner+of+Correction&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 21/23\n\n6/20/2020 Foster v. Commissioner of Correction, Mass: Supreme Judicial Court 2020 - Google Scholar\n[14]Our holding in Matter of a Minor, 484 Mass. 295, 299-300 (2020), that the minor's release from commitment did not render his appeal\nmoot, is inapposite. Santos does not appeal from the initial commitment decision. Cf. id. Rather, he argues, on behalf of the class, that the\nconditions of confinement during the pandemic render continued confinement unconstitutional.\n[15]Any anticipated future mootness of the class representative's individual claims should not preclude class certification, where the \"claims\nare so inherently transitory that the trial court will not have even enough time to rule on a motion for class certification before the proposed\nrepresentative's individual interest expires\" (citation omitted). See County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 52 (1991), and cases\ncited. See also Gammella v. P.F. Chang's China Bistro, Inc., 482 Mass. 1, 20 n.24 (2019); Gonzalez v. Commissioner of Correction, 407\nMass. 448, 452 (1990). Thus, had Santos been committed when the complaint was filed, his subsequent release would not have prevented\nthe class from being certified or Santos from continuing to represent it. Here, however, the issue is not mootness; rather, Santos lacked\nstanding from the start. See County of Riverside, supra at 51 (distinguishing mootness from lack of standing).\n[16]That the CDC interim guidance for prisons recognizes that in some instances it may not be feasible to maintain the recommended six\nfeet, and offers other guidance that may help to reduce the risk as far as possible in such circumstances, does not mean, as the defendants\nappear to suggest, that the CDC recommends maintaining a lesser distance among incarcerated individuals than among others; it clearly\nstates repeatedly that six feet or more \"ideally\" should be maintained between incarcerated individuals, including in housing arrangements.\nSee Interim Guidance, supra at 3, 4, 11, 13, 19, 20.\n[17]The plaintiffs urge that, rather than the objective and subjective components of deliberate indifference, this court apply the objective\nstandard used in Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2473 (2015), in evaluating their Eighth Amendment claims. This reasoning is\nmisguided. Kingsley involved a claim by a pretrial detainee under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, concerning the use of excessive force. The detainee\nasserted a violation of his substantive due process rights. Accordingly, to prevail, he was required to show only that the intentional use of\nforce was excessive or objectively unreasonable, and not that the official intended it to be so. This standard, however, is inapplicable to\nclaims of deliberate indifference under the Eighth Amendment.\n[18]Courts have relied on similar reasoning in considering prison officials' policies with respect to other widespread risks to health and\nsafety. See, e.g., Rish v. Johnson, 131 F.3d 1092, 1099 (4th Cir. 1997) (requiring inmates to clean up blood and bodily fluids without\nproviding them gloves); Wallis v. Baldwin, 70 F.3d 1074, 1077 (9th Cir. 1995) (requiring inmate to clean attic full of asbestos, known\ncarcinogen, without protective equipment).\n[19]In determining whether there was a violation of substantive due process, some courts have applied the standard of deliberate\nindifference to decisions made by nonprofessionals. See, e.g., Lanman v. Hinson, 529 F.3d 673, 684 (6th Cir. 2008). This court, however,\nhas rejected the application of the deliberate indifference standard to individuals who have been civilly committed because of their\nintellectual disabilities. See Hopper v. Callahan, 408 Mass. 621, 627 & n.4 (1990). Additionally, the United States Supreme Court's decision\nin Kingsley, 135 S. Ct. at 2473, casts doubt on the applicability of a subjective standard to claims challenging conditions of confinement for\nnonsentenced individuals. See Smith v. Washington, 781 Fed. Appx. 595, 597-598 (9th Cir. 2019), quoting Castro v. County of Los Angeles,\n833 F.3d 1060, 1071 (9th Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 831 (2017) (applying objective test to civil detainees).\n[20]The record here contains only the plaintiffs' summaries of what the DPH reports state, and not the actual reports. We have taken\njudicial notice of some of the publicly accessible reports, which are available for download on the DPH's website, and which are consistent\nwith the plaintiffs' representations.\n[21]These considerations apply as much to nonsecure, inpatient treatment facilities as they do to the secure facilities at issue here. The\nrecord is devoid of any information regarding the conditions present in nonsecure treatment facilities in the Commonwealth. Therefore, we\nhave no basis for determining whether COVID-19 transmission is more likely in secure locations, and accordingly are unable to make a\ndetermination on the plaintiffs' alternative request for transfers to nonsecure facilities.\n[1]\"Enhanced consideration should be given to resorting to non-custodial measures at all stages of the administration of criminal justice,\nincluding at the . . . post-sentencing stage[].
